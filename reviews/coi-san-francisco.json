It may be a little hard to find because there's no big sign and it fits into the buildings there.\nStreet parking is a little tough and especially since it's on a busy street. There is no valet either. \nInside is nice and quiet. Decor is modern and we sat in the outside, right when you walk in. I saw there was an inner room where the majority of people sat. The whole night there was only one other table next to us and I thought that was nice.\n\nOur supplement was caviar and worth every penny! I loved the presentation! Even though it looked like it was only a little, underneath the top layer was just a mound of caviar. What a pleasant surprise!\nAnother favorite was the Foie Gras tart with the strawberry inside. Although the foie gras was quite salty, the strawberry inside balanced it out very nicely. \nThis was my first time trying pigeon and it wasn't bad! The meat was very tender and there was no weird taste/smell to it. You are welcome to eat the head but I was too scared to! \nNormally I do not eat lamb but they cooked the lamb very nicely. I liked that the sauce was strong enough to cover the lamb taste. \nThe desserts were very yummy! The huckleberry cheesecake was very interesting. It was more like a deconstructed cheesecake, very creamy, and the berry sorbet paired very well with it!\nWe also received a special dessert in an egg shell placed in a duck's foot??? Most interesting presentation ever!! But this was my favorite dessert! Something lemon panna cotta but it was sooooo good! \n\nAt the end, they gave us the menus and monkey bread? on our way out. I have yet to try it but they said it pairs well with coffee. Overall a very pleasant experience at Coi and I am excited to continue with my Michelin mission!", "author": "Kristie L."}

Halfway into our meal, a Gentleman began making loud comments, speaking loudly to the restaurant employees and making a display of himself. He had a phone on a tripod and was making videos, taking pictures and behaving as though he were in his home. \n\nSome time later, another woman joined his party - at this point it got louder and louder yet. Then he and the kitchen staff took photos in the lobby. The gentleman and the staff were hooting and hollering while we are trying to finish our dinner. THIS IS A 3 MICHELIN STAR RESTAURANT?!\n\nWhat a disrespectful and rude disgrace. HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT YOUR DINERS LIKE THAT?????? \n\nOne of the wait staff members explained to me that the gentleman was with a famous Korean actress. So what does this mean? That I am no longer a paying customer who deserves my experience not to be ruined by their shouting in the restaurant????\n\n3 Michelin stars are awarded to the best of the best, places like Alinea in Chicago and the French Laundry. This sad, rude laughing stock of a restaurant does not deserve to be anywhere near that category. \n\nThe management \"comped\" my drink for the disturbance. So my entire experience was ruined and $40 was taken off of my $700+ bill. I was not looking for a discount but her way of rectifying the situation is insulting.

I came here for an anniversary and it was my second three star experience. I definitely thought Coi was the best non omakase Michelin experience I had in SF. The ambitious was nice, the service impeccable, and the food was tasty. What really elevated Coi from a one star to a three star, however, was the creativity. Rather than present solid basic dishes (think Gary Danko which I love) Coi had some of the most unique gels, puddings, soups, and all sorts of gastronomy. The dishes were perfect bites of heaven and I am such a sucker for interesting textures and ingredients. \n\nAll of the small bites at the beginning were well balanced and unique. I would say, however, the later dishes were not as good as the earlier dishes in the meal. One dish that I was meh about was the pigeon (where you could eat bird brain!)I am not such a bird brain person I realize...\n\nOne great aspect of Coi was that they accommodated my bf's dietary restrictions and specially prepared him dishes. He loved his dishes too!\n\nAlso, I have to give props for is that I have the lowest alcohol tolerance known to man kind so I don't really drink. Coi had interesting non alcoholic drinks WOOO!

Its a level of service that is so obsequious that it feels artificially exaggerated, yet somehow at the same time feels graceful and precise. Servers walking in straight lines through a small dining room to your table, and backing away after leaving the plate as if you have transformed into the Queen of England for the evening, and they are constitutionally unable to turn their backs to you. The sommelier who arrives at your table to describe your wine pairing in concise detail, as he pours with precision. \n\nThis level of service is truly an art form, and Coi does service with aplomb. \n\nThat said, with the exception of some remarkable wines, I wasn't wowed by our meal. We enjoyed a multi course celebratory meal and despite loving the ceremony of the experience, and the beauty and creativity of the plating, the taste of the food itself just didn't wow and despite multiple courses, there just wasn't enough of it. (The wine was the exception, it was well chosen & delicious.)\n\nI eat at these places so rarely, that it never gets old to watch the dance. I appreciate all that goes into service at this level. However, with a special meal like this, given all those Michelin Stars shining away (they got their 3rd star a month after we dined here) and raising expectations and that hefty price tag, the thing I want to feel when leaving a place like Coi is warm, happy and saited, with my mind blown. So it's disappointing to find myself hungry an hour later, as if I ate an impossibly small order of Chinese food brought to me by the most beautifully choreographed, impeccably mannered ballet troupe in the world.", "author": "Rachel H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-04-13", "description": "When the restaurant called me to confirm the reservation, I asked the lady on the phone how to pronounce the name of the restaurant. She said it's \"kwa\" and it's French for \"to be rendered speechless\".  That, plus the three Michelin stars, set really high expectations when I came here for dinner after a long week. \n\nIn terms of the food, I think the experience was near perfect - from the canap\u00e9s to the \"surf\" courses to the \"turf\" courses to the desserts.  Perfect execution on the food and the poultry dishes (duck royale and pigeon) were just spectacular.  I really appreciate poultry as the main \"turf\" instead of lamb or beef. The desserts also stood out as real highlights for the meal.\n\nThe only disappointing part of the meal, in my humble opinion, was the bread service. At this level of restaurant, the expectation is really high (this store bought bread is competing with the house brioche and wagyu butter from Atelier Crenn).  Also, the portions are petit which makes it even more important to have great bread.  The other suggestion I would give is that the menu feels like it is lacking a consomm\u00e9 dish (after the asparagus or between the \"surf\" and \"turf\" courses).  Lastly, I'm torn about the pigeon head - it's borderline inedible and I really didn't need to see that. \n\nThe ambiance is wonderful and the space is warm and intimate - it's fine dining but with a casual vibe.  Service was as expected at this level of restaurant.  The one thing I loved was that they had a tea pairing, which was perfect since I was recovering from a cold.  A copy of the menu and pairings is provided at the end of the meal, together with caramelized bread. This is as expected for a three Michelin star restaurant.\n\nOverall, this is a bucket list type of place.  I hope that the new chef can make some improvements here and hang on to the three Michelin stars. The competition at this level in SF is fierce.  Better bread service and a great consomm\u00e9 would go a long way.", "author": "Andrew S."}

However, no regrets whatsoever, this place is truly a gem.\n\nPresentation 5/5:\nI booked this place on a Wednesday evening. The lighting and conversation level was much more relaxed than the other Michelin Star restaurants I've been too. The tables, utensils, furniture, and even the decorations on the wall were all so simple, modern, yet had a touch of poise and elegance, as if Gianni Versace breathed on this place. \n\nCustomer Service 5/5:\nI'm so used to sliding into my seat that I was surprised when the waiters/waitresses were pulling out my chair and tucked the chair in when I adjusted myself accordingly. Never had that before and for the few hours I was here, I truly was feeling Upper Echelon. Though when that check came, that feeling drained out the window...\n\nAnyway, great recommendations. Water cup was never empty. Wine was always refilled before the last sip. Paired the perfect beer for the remaining dishes on the menu. And even offered to provide additional desserts, which we declined because we were  already full.\n\nWhen they saw us get up for the bathroom, they even hurried to open the doors for us. Don't get that everyday.\n\nMeal 6/5:\nCoi provides an incredible tasting menu. I have had everything on the menu before, separately but their take on the dishes was phenomenal.\n\nMy favorites:\nGeoDuck - caramelized duck cream, clams, and green onions\n\nPortion size is similar to teacup level so you really do need to enjoy this one.\n\nHalzenut - hen egg, parsnip, caramelized salsify, and puffed rice\n\nThis one is on par as far as taste level but man, the halzenuts to the salsify, to the rice, to the cream they pour over everything was to die for.\n\nBeef - black trumpet with fermented pepper toffee\nThe beef is imitation wagyu, it was that delicious and the sauce was amazing. Tasted like a $10,000 oyster sauce\n\n\nOverall, had an amazing experience. This place is somewhere you take someone, or even yourself, to be pampered. It is pricy ($250 a person) and there is an automatic 20% gratuity. \n\nPlease do your research before you come! The couple sitting in table next to us didn't.

Didn't go with any expectations, but left slightly disappointed. The entire meal took 4 hours which is unusual for my boyfie and I as we fly through tasting menus. I felt like the staff/chef did not time it well for each table individually... I assume they work with their own time in the kitchen? Anyway, the period between each dish was WAYYY too long to the point of boredom. In addition, some dishes were questionable in terms of taste. Wasn't a huge fan of the tasting menu, but appreciate what they offered and the art that went into each dish. \n\nThe two highlights:\n- DUNGENESS CRAB citrus leaves, black sesame, shinko pear, lily bulb\n- STURGEON roasted chicken, bay leaf, tarragon\n\nI'd give 3 stars for the food and 5 stars for the service.

The menu is different, with more game birds.  My sister said she likes it a lot more than the old Coi and the old chef, and she is actually full now.  LOL.  I think that despite the change of Chefs, it would keep its ranking as it was as good or better than other three star places I've dined at.\n\nIt might be that I love Asian flavors, French flavors, and duck, but I love the food.  There were many courses that blew me away--the duck and the sturgeon were amazing.  I also loved the asparagus with the grapefruit egg yolk sauce and caviar.  They had multiple fish and meat dishes, and were quite generous with the truffle and caviar.  The wine pours were also quite generous.  It might be that I also like to pair sweet and salty and experiment with fruit with my dishes, and this's chef does that!\n\nThe service was very warm and friendly, attentive but not stuffy.  The waiter proceeded to link arms with me to walk me to the bathroom to show that  \"chivalry isn't dead.\"  It was a zen and quiet setting, but still fun!\n\nThe the multiple desserts were amazing and the chocolate was perfect--not too sweet, not too bitter.  It wasn't an afterthought but one of the my favorite parts!\n\nI sometimes go against reviews.  Manresa has three stars, but I thought it was a one star.  Quince had a one star, and we thought it was three (people later agreed).  Many of my sister and I's one or two Michelin star favorites got elevated to 2-3 stars.  We seem to pick the up and coming places really well!  That is with the exception of Manresa (I still can't get over that experience!).  I believe that this Chef would become celebrated.  A lot of the downside reviews of Coi are no longer applicable.  The food was amazing and they did not skimp on meat, truffle, fois gras, and caviar.

You've earned it.\n\n-\n\nI came here with a good friend of mine at the end of March this year. It was my \"spring break trip,\" so to speak, and I broke my restrictive diet rules to enjoy the tasting menu.\n\nSkipping to my favorite dish--the stuffed shells, with bone marrow, rosemary, and romain. I found this to be the most flavorful of the dishes, and I was in the mood for soft-textured food. It was delicate and elegant, yet it was bold. It's a dish that makes you take pause and give a sigh of pleasure.\n\nAnother favorite of mine was the asparagus, with caviar, tangerine, and savagnin. The asparagus was cooked perfectly--by far the best I've ever had. Soft, but firm. The caviar added salt and interesting texture, and the tangerine sauce added a slight tanginess. Another wonderful visual composition, another spectacular combination of flavors.\n\nThe service here is stellar, so we tipped well. Our server was soft-spoken, but decisive, recommending his favorite pairings, but only if he was asked. \n\nThe restaurant is intimate, with likely less than 20 dining tables. It's beautifully designed and decorated, especially the bathroom. \n\nThe one thing I didn't enjoy about our experience was how awkwardly silent the place was. Awkward not for me or my friend, but awkward because this French woman eating next to us had a bit to drink, and was audibly talking to an associate on the phone. After she ended the call, she was watching us eat, and it was difficult for me to not feel self conscious.\n\nOverall, this restaurant makes the list of top five best restaurants I've ever been to.

After the meal, I usually have the grand plan of writing a lengthy detailed review and then I put it on the back burner and before you know it, it's several months out and I can't even remember. Sometimes I don't bother to review it anymore (as in the case of Benu or French Laundry), other times, I try to attempt based on what I remember (as in this case).\n\nMy partner in crime and I had decided that we were going to treat ourselves to a \"fancy dinner\" at a 2 Michelin Star restaurant. We were between Acquerello and Coi (and leaning toward Coi). But since we had heard that the 2018 Michelin announcement was coming out the next day (Oct. 25), I suggested that we hold off until we saw the new list. Upon the release of the 2018 list, it confirmed our choice, Coi. We were quick on Opentable and snagged seats the next night, Oct. 26. \n\nDespite being elevated to 3 stars, they were extremely nice and accommodating. My friend was coming from Los Altos and there were two major accidents on the way up which delayed her by 45 minutes past our reservation time. Coi didn't give us a hard time at all. The location in this stretch of North Beach that is full of strip clubs was a bit unexpected. My friend was also heading directly to the airport after our dinner and walked into the restaurant with a suitcase, which they helped her store.\n\nThe menu reflected a wide selection of seafood including sea urchin, oyster, loup de mer, abalone, octopus, and skate wing. The dishes were stunningly beautiful and in general, had a green hue. We started with a crispy chip with caviar before moving onto the rich sea urchin. The oyster tasted like the sea (in a good way). We were extremely impressed by the abalone dish, in which abalone was sliced into thin sheets, folded into a cone shape, and arranged around the plate with sea lettuce, celery, and Bartlett pear. It was so tender and completely different than what we think of (Chinese banquet) when we imagine abalone. At this point, the bread came out. Now, I've had better bread but I don't think I've ever had prettier butter.\n\nThe next few dishes were more substantial - black bass (perfect), octopus (very good), and skate wing (not my favorite type of fish but it was done well).\n\nAnd then the desserts! The first was the pear sorbet that was served with a crispy shell filled with chevre. That part of it was so tasty. Then, we were presented with chocolate mille-feuille. My friend noted that she doesn't like the combination of kaffir lime and coconut but that is one of my favorite flavor combinations that is common in Thai cuisine. While I liked the flavor of this dish, I didn't like how difficult it was to eat as it fell apart when I tried to cut into it. Although that was the end of the official menu, we given one last surprise. A box came out but it turned out to have several layers which were expertly arranged on the table in front of us to expose lots of little petit fours. Super cute!\n\nRestaurants have a tendency to change their prices after getting more stars but since Coi is in between head-chefs right now and the new menu has not been revealed yet, you can still try it at a very good price point of $250 (for its caliber) through the end of the year.", "author": "Yi Z."}

Many of the chef's attempts at out of the box cuisine failed to appeal to my palette such as the second course fish entree which had an unusually icy finish. Overall, the fish dishes were much better prepared than the meat ones. The foie gras tasted fattening and dense while the lamb and pigeon dishes were too cold by the time they got to my table. With that being said, the sun gold tomato entree with shelling beans and anchovy was absolutely delicious and I definitely could have done with another helping. Another suggestion of mine would be to remove the pigeon head from the plate as it was just as unappetizing as it looked. I enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. It was very beautifully lit and simply decorated to create a comfortable environment for its guests. I also appreciated that the chef came out during the last savory course of the meal to introduce himself and explain the components of the dish. In a video I watched of Daniel Patterson's, the former chef of Coi, I listened to him describe that his original vision of Coi had something to do with serving fine dining quality food while at the same time maintaining an appearance of cooking for close and intimate friends and family. I can see how Coi is attempting to make this vision a reality, but I cannot say that the overall pleasantness of the restaurant and staff was enough to make up for the underwhelming gastronomic experience.", "author": "Allison E."}

Everything is seafood based but it doesn't look like anything you would imagine. My favorite was the butter sculpture. I had multiple people ask me what it was after I posted photos because it doesn't even look like food. They will bring you more bread as well but its better not to eat it because you will leave insanely stuffed. I got most of the last dessert course to go because I could barely breathe. \n\nI opted out of the wine pairing because I get alcohol poisoning every time I do it.

I am not a huge meat eater but, I have had squab prepared insanely well at Tse Yang, this was not that. Additionally, the room, the space, the service (I can't say enough about the service, everyone should experience service at this level at least one in their lives) were all absolutely wonderful. I really like the space, a quiet, dark relatively small room with very beautiful flowers and the desserts were all out of this ( or another ) world. The chef clearly has a gift with food, I just wish the proteins would have been different, or better. For instance, I don't totally love oysters but the chefs preparation of that dish knocked my socks off, it was incredible. So, all in all, a killer dinner with excellent service, in a sexy space.", "author": "Christel T."}

I did enjoy the food but felt a bit underwhelmed at the end.  \n\nI did order a glass of Hourglass sauvignon blanc.   $22 for a glass of wine is ridiculous and that was one of the cheaper ones.

Usually people keep their voices down and maintain their composure. At Coi, while some people were like that, I found that the majority of the parties sitting around us got relatively loud and comfortable - and you know what, I liked that! Everyone was just out and having a good time, but they weren't overly loud and obnoxious, and the waitstaff played to that which greatly improved my experience there.\n\nWhile the overall experience was worth 5 stars, the food to me was at a solid 4. With multi course tasting menus, it's hard for every dish to be a hit with every guest, and for me - there were some personal misses, which I will say is due to my personal preferences and not because of the kitchen. Some of the dishes I felt that the ingredient and flavor combinations weren't for me, but the dishes that were a hit for me more than made up for it.\n\nMy favorites of the night were of course the oh-so talked about Loup De Mer (Sea Bass), the way it was finely diced was an amazing texture especially when paired with the crispy skin, and the honeydew sauce was completely out of left field but made this dish incredibly sweet and refreshing. God I wish I could go back to Coi for just that one dish... Other favorites of mine would also have to be stuffed shells, which is fine on it's own, but paired with the bone marrow broth really brought the dish together - incredible umami. The skate wing was also a favorite of mine since it contained some sweetbread, and that one appeared to be the most controversial at my table. And finally, as an self proclaimed \"not a dessert guy\", the box of sweets they presented at the end of the meal were all home runs in my book. Not too sweet, and a lot of citrus flavors were absolutely perfect for me.", "author": "Ron T."}

Restaurants of this caliber typically choose something custom, but the convenience I suppose is appreciated.\n\nOddly, there is a placard outside restaurant still reflects the restaurant's two Michelin stars, with a third written in using sharpie. The outside is otherwise beautiful and what you could expect in San Francisco. It is nice enough to fit in but not overly ornate.\n\nWhen you walk in, the hostess seems to expect you. The interior environment is interesting, beautiful, and somewhat sophisticated, hiding the small size of the restaurant through its vaulted ceilings and interesting touches. You walk past a small, long window gazing into the kitchen, though you ignore it on your way in as you peer into where you might be sitting. You are led to your table, which is slid out, along with the outer seat, to accommodate the booth-side guest. Service continues to be attentive throughout dinner, just a touch away but never overbearing or overstaying their welcome. If anything, it might be a touch on the cool side.\n\nCourses are immaculate as they come out, and many of them are presented by multiple people coming out of the kitchen at once, depending on the complexity. Consider that we're just a two-person table in a cramped space, and you can see the feat in this. The presentation involved in the dishes is equally appreciable. Each comes out very finely plated, and is extremely photographable, save for my own lack of skill.\n\nI won't go into too much detail on the individual courses, as when you order you have no choice over what gets presented to you - it's tasting menus, only.\n\nI think overall, many restaurants in this price range, including Alinea and The French Laundry, tend to have multiple courses you simply dislike in the course of the meal. It's a feat alone that Coi doesn't have one of those. While I can't say I really liked or loved all the dishes, I did enjoy the evening, and have no regrets going. The biggest disappointment perhaps is that we weren't served the famed Turbot - the dish Coi is known for.\n\nTIPS\n\nCome early - there are fewer people in the restaurant, and you have an element of surprise as each course comes out, as your neighboring table likely will be behind you in the progression. It's a minor detail, but one that makes the evening more fun. \n\nAlso pass on the fruity white wines. Just because you see a lot of seafood on the menu doesn't mean it's the right pairing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-01-28", "description": "We ate at Coi as our splurge meal in San Francisco earlier this month. I'd heard about it moving up the ranks of Michelin stars, but when I booked the reservation, I had not known that the executive chef had just changed. As such, we ended up eating at Coi on Erik Anderson's fifth night of presenting his new tasting menu. The ambiance of Coi is very subtle, with smoothly-cut wooden tables and a dimly-lit dining room that wasn't too large and was generally quiet for most of the time we were there. I was surprised to see a lack of patronage on a Saturday night - the restaurant was half-empty for most of the time we were there - and all I can say is that folks are missing out on a heck of a dining experience. The service was good and attentive, with one of our waiters talking about his past experience in the restaurant industry and common spots we liked in New York City - it certainly gave a much more personalized touch to the meal, particularly since many of the servers at these upper-scale restaurants can sometimes come off as a little more stiff and impersonal. There's plenty of drinks to be had as well, although I went with a large bottle of imperial brown ale from The Bruery that I nursed over the course of the entire meal, and it was absolutely delicious (if a tad pricey).\n\nThe menu was still under a bit of a trial period, so it's quite possible the meal we had wasn't repeated again afterwards - but nonetheless, I found it to be very good, with the highlight really on the seafood plates served during the meal. Every plate was presented beautifully, with portions probably on the smaller side of what you might expect. Nonetheless, this worked out well - we weren't stuffed by the end of the meal, meaning we were able to enjoy everything without running into that part of the meal where negative marginal utility runs rampant. The citrus marshmellow tart was a bright way to start off the meal, albeit not quite the direction I was expecting to go. That said, it was in line with the clean, bright flavors that the meal projected. I really enjoyed the next dish, a large clam presented in clam jelly (almost like gelatin) with duck cream - a mixture of the saltiness of the clam with the smoky fragrance of duck really worked well. This kicked off a run of fantastic seafood dishes, starting with the dungeness crab terrine with pear and dots of black sesame sauce. The crab is very fresh, and the presentation allows you to taste every strand of meat. The black sesame I could actually have used more of - the nuttiness pairs really well with the crab - while the pear, with a similar flavor profile, didn't quite do as much. Next up was a delicious course of caviar served with a hen egg, presented in a mushroom-infused soup of sorts, although the texture was more like a puffed cream...caviar with mushrooms and eggs always works well together, and this was no exception. Our last seafood course was a slice of sturgeon plated similarly to the crab, but served with a rich roasted chicken sauce that really complemented the fuller, firmer bite of the sturgeon with a hearty overlay.\n\nIn all, the seafood was definitely the star of the meal, but the meat dishes were pretty well-done too, if not quite as memorably as the fish. The duck was served in a more traditional French style - in a tourte with foie gras and a rich au jus infused with black truffle. I wouldn't say the duck was cooked as well as other spots, but the overall dish was very flavorful and very reminiscent of French cuisine. I enjoyed the beef quite a bit more, served with a richer au jus alongside black trumpet mushrooms and an airy peppermint toffee on top, giving it a dash of sweetness. It was then onto the sweets, where I really enjoyed 3 things immensely: the blood orange sorbet, which was covered with sliced-up pieces of frozen orange and citrus-flavored discs such that it looked like your sorbet was covered in carrots and other root vegetables - a fun presentation; the 'mille-feiulle' cake, which in this iteration was a very decadent chocolate cake presented with creams, fudge, and thinly-sliced chocolate separating each layer; and the truffled monkeybread that was an after-morning bite for us...I'd argue that the time overnight allowed the truffle to more deeply infuse itself into the bread, and for the brandy to glaze over just enough to give it a nice sweet overtone with each bite.\n\nEven with a new chef, Coi still earns its 3 Michelin stars, IMO. The food was absolutely fantastic, with the crab, caviar, and sturgeon dishes being comparable (if not better at times) to comparable bites at a seafood shrine like Le Bernardin. The main downside is price, which at $250 (before 20% gratuity) definitely feels like it's on the more expensive side. Nonetheless, the meal was worth it, and I'd encourage first-timers or previous diners to come here and enjoy some creatively delicious cooking.", "author": "Asuka N."}

Noteable dishes included the fluke with etrog and oscretra caviar.  \n\nLove the flow of the courses.  Most of the dishes have a subtle and refined taste.  I started off with a Kusshi oyster with sea lettuce and black truffle.  The truffle added a nice contrast to the light oyster.  However the truffle wasn't too overpowering as well.  On to what I loved the most, which with the fluke and caviar dish.  The flavors and texture of the fluke just melted in my mouth.  The crab afterwards was lovely as well.\n\nThe bread course offered a decorative butter sculpture.  The butter was also to die for as well.  I basically had butter with a touch of bread.  Afterwards you have a turbot and chicken, which didn't stand out to me.  The foie gras and lobster course pretty amazing as well.  The wine pairing on that was delectable.  \n\nOn to the dessert portion.  I was greeted with the most amazing pistachio ice cream.  The praline chocolate dish at the end was a punch of flavor at the end of the meal.  It was a bit too rich for me.  \n\nI thought the wine pairing overall was just average.  It didn't blend that well with the meal or had much remarkable selections.  There were surprising a lot of champagne choices in the pairing as well.  The last two dessert wines were just average as well.  \n\nI did like the presentation of the small sweets at the end.

We had an enjoyable dinner for sure.  The deficiency I see is portion size given the price.  Many of the dishes are literally bite-sized, and only that last round of desserts seems to try to fill you up.  Until the desserts came, we were tempted to hit In and Out on the way home since neither of us was full!  You could pay roughly the same price at Coi and eat at 3-Michelin Star Benu and have closer to 15 dishes of similar to better quality.  So for me, Coi is 3 Stars overall.  Others may like it more if you have a smaller appetite or just had a real heavy lunch.\n\nWINE\nHighly recommend the 2013 Riesling by the glass - smooth and sweet, and slightly chilled.\n\nFAVORITE DISHES\n* Dungeness Crab - As with many dishes, presentation was gorgeous and this was like an elevated crab roll. The two jelly shots of mango and crab consomm\u00e9 added a nice touch.\n\n* Turbot - I've never seen fish prepared this way - with multi-colored root veggies sliced to make scales.  Gently cooked too to get all that fresh fish flavor.  \n\n* Lobster - By far one of the better dishes - meat from both the claw (exceptional) and tail (good), but with foie gras wrapped with brussell sprout leaves and savoy cabbage topped with lobster roe.  The red wine-lobster broth sauce was excellent.  \n\nCoi definitely has the potential to get that third Michelin Star and can catch up to Benu - I think they should either add an additional protein dish and maybe slightly increase the portion sizes.", "author": "Daniel C."}

So hard to choose favorites, but I really enjoyed the ocean trout. The textures it came with complemented it so perfectly and didn't take away from the trout at all. Another one of my favorites was the dungeness crab, as it came sort of rolled up with some rouille - ingenious presentation. Talking about presentation, the butter itself came in a ribbon shape and I didn't even want to touch it because it was so beautiful. But screw that, of course I finished all the butter and ate all the bread.\n\nThe next beautiful dish was the the cod, as it was layered in a scale-like design with carrots, onions, etc. The fish was cooked perfectly and flaked off perfectly while still melting in my mouth. Presentation and taste very on point.\n\nSkipping to the dessert, everything was impeccable. All the desserts were simple enough, but with a small twist of creativity to make it blow my mind somehow. Our first dessert was a strawberry ile flottante - I love strawberries so I may be biased but the textures were all there for me. Then followed by bite sized pieces of vanilla cake filled with raspberry, pistachio, or rhubarb - the raspberry ones were my favorite. Lastly were the mignardises which consisted of coconut macarons, pate de fruits, matcha white chocolate, and a financier. Needless to say we were stuffed by the time these surprises came out, and the restaurant was nice enough to let us take them to go.\n\nOverall, a very solid restaurant and would highly recommend.

We had a phone conversation that was equally, if not more unpleasant than my experience at Coi. The condescending Mr. Page used the call as an opportunity to assert that I was wrong, and thinly veiled it as an attempt to \"make things right\". \n\nHe proceeded to tell me that they did remove the cake from its box, and accused me of making fictitious statements. Anybody with a modicum of common sense would understand that the box is an irrelevant detail. Box or no box, the bottom line is that their poor judgement ruined a very special occasion. \n\nIn addition, he argued that I did not provide specific instructions that a cake would be brought in. He did, however, acknowledge that I called the restaurant asking if it was okay to bring in a cake. Apparently, that phone call was not enough indication for the Neanderthals that run this place. Even without prior notice, I would expect the staff at an establishment of this caliber to think on their feet. \n\nHe further stated that \"the chef does not like putting candles in his food\". If true, they should have informed me at the time I called to inquire about the birthday cake, when I handed it to the hostess, or when I made the reservation and clearly stated that it was a birthday. It is appalling that they were unable to handle something this simple. \n\nThe very passive-aggressive Mr. Page issued an insincere apology and a partial refund for his terrible lapse in judgement. While we do appreciate the refund, he totally missed the point - it was never about the money. The special occasion that these clowns ruined is invaluable, and no sum of money could bring it back. What I would have appreciated is a simple apology, not accompanied by a fifteen-minute lecture from a smug, unprofessional charlatan about how I am in the wrong. \n\nThis series of unpleasant interactions is clear indication that Coi is undeserving of its two stars.

There are not too many tables, so it keeps the dining experience intimate. I love the dimmed lights, they really set the mood and you feel like you are the only ones in the restaurant.  We sat at a table with a view of the kitchen, which was amazing!!! \n\nService: 5 stars. Creme de la Creme, cream of the crop, best of the best! You truly are paying for an entire dining experience.  The moment you walk into the restaurant you feel like nobility.  They take care of you.  Ten courses accompanied by amazing explanations of each dish being served.  Our server(s) were attentive, charming, knowledgeable, personable, and lovely.  The service was so exceptional, I cannot stop talking about it.   \n\nFood:  What you all have been waiting for.  Seafood heaven.  If you do not like seafood, this is probably not your place. Ten Courses of art.  Ten courses of perfectly plated heaven.  Ten courses of flavor explosion in your mouth.  I also did the wine flight, which did not disappoint.  The champagnes were my favorite.  Pure bubbly heaven.  The quality, presentation and freshness of the ingredients were remarkable.  This was 4 hours, pleasing every one of my senses.  The smells, the presentation, the amazing taste....my mouth just salivates writing this review.  The plates come out and as they explain all the ingredients and how everything compliments each other, it is unreal.  My mouth hurt from smiling so much.  Listening to them talk about the food was a pleasure within itself, and then eating the food.....I died and went to heaven.  You'll just have to go and try it out yourself.  A way to end every perfect meal is with dessert or desserts in this case.  The desserts just kept coming out, I loved it.       \n\nPrice:  Yeah, about that.  Just spoil yourself, or your loved one(s).  You deserve it.   \nThe tasting menu for two and the wine flight was over the hundreds mark.  Dine here, great company and great food, something you will never regret.   \n\nLast Remarks: If it's good enough for Anthony Bourdain, it's good enough for me.", "author": "Adrianna P."}

Worth every penny... that I did not have to fortunately pay.\n\nFood: Ten Courses of careful crafted, perfectly plated and amazingly tasty works of art... yes, I am referring to each and every plate that was on the menu that night. The quality of the ingredients used was superior from the slices of protein to the pieces of fresh produce and even garnishing items! Because the menu changes more often than not, I will not go into details on the food we had, but what I noticed between all of the plates we had was that each and every plate painted a different picture for us. Each plate was very different from the others, each plate was robust in flavor and each ingredient that was on that plate carefully complimented the others to create a small plate of food art that was larger than life. The attention to detail is more than meets the eye. At first it seems so simple, but spend a mere amount of seconds focusing on each component of the plate and you'll realize they really put in a lot of thought when deciding on how the plate would be presented. The experience truly heightened all of my sense, especially my sight! I ate with my eyes so much throughout the three hour experience. It was honestly hard to eat each course as everything was so perfect and lovely. We had tons of desserts, it felt like we had a pre-dessert, dessert and a post-dessert. The final dessert was a combination of many desserts, including rich and decadent matcha chocolate (my favorite!) that came in little compartments. We also had tasty and buttery macaroons too! \n\nAmbiance: Classy, elegant and romantic environment. The dimmed lights really set the mood and allow parties privacy with their choice of company, though we had two parties beside us, we were able to converse on a personal level without feeling like others around us were eavesdropping or without us being able to hear what others around us were talking about. We enjoyed this romantic experience as the occasion was my birthday.\n\nService: The best of the best! Of course, we are paying a ton to dine here, so it's obvious that the service should be exception, however, we truly enjoyed the fact that our server made the experience so personal by constantly calling us by our first names and repeatedly educating us and giving tips on how to eat certain plates. He did all of this while attending other tables too! Really an awesome dining experience, I wish all experiences were this way. From the moment you walk into Coi you are greeted and treated like royalty! They take very good care of customers and ensure you enjoy the experience and get your moneys worth. \n\nPrice: Let's just skip this part. Dine here with only the best company and you'll never regret how much you spent..\n\nOverall: I'm not a Michelin critic, but I can see why Coi received two Michelin stars.

The roommate went ahead and bought us tickets for dinner on Tuesday, December 1st at 6:15pm. Tickets were $220 each +tax and 20% service charge = $574.20.\n\n*CALIFORNIA BOWL: puffed brown rice cracker, sprouts, avocado\n*SNO-CONE: niabell ice, wild bay salt\n*CALIFORNIA STURGEON CAVIAR: egg yolk, creme fraiche, chive\n*OYSTERS UNDER GLASS: radish, yuzu, rau ram\n*INVERTED BEET/GOAT CHEESE TART: rye, dill\n*PUMPKIN-APPLE BROTH: turnip, charred onion, monterey cypress\n*MONTEREY BAY ABALONE: nettle-dandelion salsa verde, spicy breadcrumbs, wild fennel flowers\n*CELTUCE: just-dug potatoes, comt\u00e9, burnt hay, tarragon\n*POACHED AND GRILLED LAMB: chard leaves and stems, garum, rosemary\n*COCONUT MOCHI BUN: kiwi, shiso\n*GRAPEFRUIT: ginger, black pepper, anise herbs\n*COFFEE BABA: hazelnut, persimmon, yogurt\n*SOFT NOUGAT COVERED IN DARK CHOCOLATE\n\nMy favorite dishes were the caviar, abalone and lamb. The egg yolk was creamy with a custard like consistency. Went well with the salty caviar. The abalone was a fun play on textures with the crunchy breadcrumbs and chewy abalone. I did find this dish a bit salty though. The lamb was cooked perfectly. I did wish it had more of a char and the fat was cooked a little more.\n\nI know Coi focuses on local, fresh ingredients, but for the price of the tasting, I wanted more. More food, more flavor, more luxurious ingredients. It would have been nice if there were a couple more protein courses and maybe an ingredient like truffle to make the meal feel more substantial.\n\nAlso, the roommate doesn't eat lamb, so they gave him a choice of chicken or cauliflower in place of that course. He ended up getting two tiny pieces of chicken. I know lamb isn't widely loved by everyone, so I'm surprised they didn't offer a beef dish in place of the lamb.\n\nI strongly disliked the celtuce course. I love green vegetables. But the stem of ancient lettuce? I have no idea what that's supposed to taste like, but I found it too green and too soft. The roommate was surprised as I almost always finish my vegetables. He also couldn't eat that course or the pumpkin soup. He would have walked away hungry had he not had a huge late lunch before our meal.\n\nWine pairing ($135):\n*2012 Schramsberg, 'Blanc de Blancs', Napa Valley, California\n*2014 Ameztoi, Txakolina, Spain\n*2014 Radio-Coteau, 'Platt Vineyard' Reisling, Sonoma Coast, California\n*2013 Meyer-Fonne, 'Kaefferkopf' Pinot Gris, Grand Cru, Alsace, France\n*2014 Vocal Vineyards, 'Alfaro Vineyard' Gruner Veltliner, Santa Cruz Mountains, California\n*2013 Tyler, 'Zotovich Vineyard' Chardonnay, Sta. Rita Hills, Santa Barbara County, California\n*2012 Chateau Samion, Lalabde-De-Pomerol, Bordeaux, France\n*2013 Schafer-Frohlich, 'Felseneck' Spalese Gold Kapsule, Nahe, Germany\n*2008 Royal Tokaji Company, 'Aszu 5 Puttonyos' Red Label, Mad, Hungary\n\nThey also offer a Cellar selections pairing ($250) and a Tea pairing ($75), but I just got the standard wine pairing. I'm definitely more of a red wine girl. Even though they only gave me one red, I actually enjoyed the pairing. Everything paired perfectly with the flavors of each course. Our pairing also had a standard +20% service charge on our bill.\n\nService was excellent as can be expected. Very attentive without being overly hovering. They also gave us an extra dessert for celebrating a special occasion: Stuffed brioche with white chocolate sauce.\n\nI can appreciate what Coi is trying to do with their dishes, but everything comes down to taste for me. At this price point, I just expected more. At $220 per person, no one should leave hungry. I've dragged the roommate to many a coursed meals and by far, I think this has been the most disappointing.

All of the food tastes bland with the exception of a few really good ones. \n\nThe good parts of the meal would easily be the poached egg and the poached pear dessert. Everything before and after was only all right. The poached egg is of course is their staple. It was absolutely amazing that the egg had the texture of a custard and the flavors were smokey. The pairing with the creme fraiche was classic. \n\nSome of the other dishes I had no idea what I was supposed to taste. I love beets and goat cheese, but I had never tasted them in such a way. I could see that the crispy piece on the top was supposed to balance everything, but there was just so much mush underneath. The goat cheese and beet mixture had this mushy, almost slimy texture. \n\nMost of the courses were okay to eat. The only other one that I really couldn't even finish was the celtuse. Maybe this ancient Chinese vegetable was meant to stay in the ancient ages. And the apple-pumkin broth lacked so much depth. \n\nOverall, I was disappointed. The meal started off without us being checked-in properly and just kinda tumbled along until the end.\n\nService was pretty good. Less rehearsed than I would have imaged, but suitable and knowledgable. \n\nI'm not coming back but I'm glad I got to check this place out and enjoy that egg.", "author": "Tina Y."}

The food display was like art work and so delicate.  The food was too rich, and too consistent all the way through the desserts.  I didn't feel like there was ever a break in the rich flavors.  They asked me if it was too rich and I said yes.  But being in a public place, I felt the need to keep quiet and not ruin it for other close by patrons.  Additionally, our table was right by the entrance.  They tried to tell me it was the most covetous table but it was extremely distracting with all the traffic flow.  Valet parking was absent but we tried to be understanding.  However, with all the elements that were a miss, it just continued to add to an unpleasant experience.  The next day, I wrote to the restaurant explaining our disappointment.  They basically invited us back!  Without any mention of a comp meal.  And by the way, you should know it's mostly fowl and poultry so if you think it's a seafood place, you will be disappointed.  My suggestion is save your money.

It's a very refreshing take on seafood, which I have loved well in Seattle but have had trouble finding in San Francisco. \n\nThe service here is exquisite, plating is mouthwatering, and the seafood is fresh and sweet. Desserts were a show stopper! Favorites included the crab, mussels (JUICY), sea lettuce bread, and lobster dishes. Vegetables were used to highlight the stars of the show, and provided creative colors to each dish, as you'll see on the Turbot fish and geoduck clam. \n\nI believe that Coi can take a lot of pride in its ingredients, innovation, service and playfulness -- it's difficult to compare an almost exclusively *New American* seafood menu to other Michelins in the city, so I'm sad to see so many 'meh' reviews here. \n\nVery low light ambience, feels very intimate and hidden from the outside :)", "author": "Kathy Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-04-18", "description": "4/15/16\n\nSo long Daniel Patterson, hello Matthew Kirkley! The new Exec Chef at Coi is outdoing his mentor in a major way. It's crazy to see all the mixed reviews from previous dining experiences here and a big reason I've never eaten at Coi before. However as of late, this place is at the top of it's game, well deserving of 2 Michelin stars and in my opinion, bordering on 3. Are you ready for this review?! Good, because it was top 3 fine dining meals of my life. \n\nUpon arrival the staff greeted us with a smile and I handed my three bottles of wine to the sommelier. Those included: \n\n- 1982 Baron Philippe de Rothschild Chateau d'Armailhac, Pauillac, France\n- 2010 Radio-Coteau Vineyards Alberigi Pinot Noir, Russian River Valley, USA\n- 2012 Brewer-Clifton Gnesa Vineyard Chardonnay, Santa Barbara County, USA\n\nArmed with silly wines, we were escorted to the private dining table in the back of the restaurant. The staff promptly informed us of \"what they do\" at Coi and what to expect for the evening. Pure elation. \n\nHere were our courses (spring menu): \n\n1. Geoduck Clam, Lardo, Bibb Lettuce, Buckwheat - texture, spot on.\n2. Asparagus, Oscetra Caviar, Yuzu Anglaise - technically speaking, the most beautiful dish I've ever eaten.\n3. Ocean Trout, Citrus Confit, Chartreuse, Fines Herbs - the herbal notes from the Chartreuse paired perfectly with the fish and citrus. Crazy.\n4. Turbot, Root Vegetables, Beurre Cancalaise - look at my picture. Turbot (pronounced Turbo) isn't a particularly scaley fish. Those \"scales\" in the picture are tweezered root vegtables made to look so. Insane! \n5. Cod, English Pea, Cockles, Mint - the English peas are so flavorful right now and worked so well with the seafood.\n6. Abalone, Bone Marrow, Artichoke, Black Truffle - i can't describe this any better than the description itself. \n7. Grapefruit, Pastis, Black Pepper - a great palate cleanser. \n8. Coconut Cannoli, Rhubarb, Hibiscus - the Italians should take a few notes ;) \n9. Almond Cake, Preserved Lemon, Amaretto Caramel - perfection. Not too sweet, just balanced almond amazingness. \n\nThe service was impeccable, attention to detail unlike anything I've experienced before. No one hovered or stayed too long, they were funny when needed to be and timed everything to perfection. Well done. \n\nAfter a perfectly executed meal, still the highlight of my night was the company. My friends. Loved Ones. Meals like this put big picture stuff into perspective...I'm a very lucky person and I try not to take that for granted. \n\nNothing short of a brilliant evening.

Luckily we arrived at 7:00 on the dot, after enduring traffic for 2 1/2 hours, and the staff calmly greeted us as we practically ran inside the door. From the outside, you probably wouldn't be able to tell that Coi is a Michelin star restaurant. The atmosphere inside was very quiet, proper, and upscale, with servers wearing 3-piece suits, who walked back and forth and stood on each side of the room looking around and checking on everyone. There was also one guy who constantly refilled our waters. I felt like royalty! \n\nOur server Andrew arrived & greeted me happy birthday. He was personable and made us feel comfortable despite the formal environment. He asked us if we had any allergies or anything, so my boyfriend reminded him we wouldn't be drinking alcohol, so Andrew recited a list of non-alcoholic beverages that we could try. We ended up deciding on sparkling rose lemonade - wow it was delicious! \n\nThe menu included 8 courses, but Andrew informed us that there would be a few surprises here and there from the chef. In total, we had 13 items! They were all very small portions, but that was perfect because it allowed us to have enough room to finish each item and try numerous things. \n\nWe started off with puffed brown rice crackers served with avocado puree. It was a perfect start to the delicious courses to come. Then, our server brought out a bowl of blood orange ice mixed with pink peppercorn & black lime - meant to be a palate cleanser. It was such an odd thing to be having a \"palate cleanser..\" that's when you know you're fancy!\n\nI should note that after each course, they were very quick to take away any dirty plates and bring brand new utensils each time. \n\nNext up was my favorite dish of the night: California sturgeon caviar! It included caviar on top of a 2-hour poached egg yolk, creme fraiche, and chopped chives. I've never had caviar before, but it was DELICIOUS. The saltiness of the caviar was perfectly paired with a creamy egg yolk and the creme fraiche.. My mouth is salivating as I think back about this dish..\n\nOkay back on track. Next dish was the geoduck topped with radish slices and salad burnett...in simple terms, beautiful tiny little flowers. The geoduck tasted just like fresh clams. The flowers threw me off, as I don't even like the smell of flowers, let alone eating them. They did pair well with the fresh flavor of the clams. Next was chilled pea soup topped with larger nasturtium flower petals. I loved the presentation of this one, but it was my least favorite taste of the night. I blame that on my dislike of peas and flowers though - nothing to do with the actual creation of the dish. I felt like a terrible person if I didn't finish but luckily my boyfriend enjoyed that one.\n\nNext, we had a stuffed and baked artichoke topped with a thin lardon layer and fava beans. They brought it out then poured olive oil right in front of you, another beautiful presentation touch. It was a nice small bite right before the next larger dish: morel- encrusted trout, served over sliced asparagus and a brown butter/sorrel juice sauce. Now let me tell you, I'm not a huge mushroom or fish fan, but WOW this course was amazing! The trout melted in your mouth, almost reminiscent of a sashimi taste. \n\nThen, we had steamed tofu mousseline, yuba, mushroom dashi. It smelled & tasted like miso soup.  There was a creamy aspect which really added a lot of flavor. After, we had aged grilled duck with spring greens and a fermented duck broth vinaigrette. This was also a very hearty dish with a bigger serving. \n\nAnother surprise from the kitchen to start off the dessert course: black sesame mochi with strawberry and rhubarb. It was so beautifully presented too..a common theme of the night if you haven't noticed. Luckily we had more dessert coming our way: frozen whipped rhubarb. It was served with cilantro - such an odd combination but it really worked. Who knew? Our next desserts were coconut pandan cake, served inside a dark chocolate ball that you break with your spoon, and apple filled brioche with a hazelnut creme, a birthday dessert from the kitchen. That was probably my favorite dessert! Then they brought out the check with two hand-pulled taffies in miso and lemon-hibiscus. \n\nOverall the menu had a very fresh theme and it was very nature-like. Everything was cohesive, full of flavors you wouldn't expect to work, but it did! Although I didn't know half of the things on that menu (I used google a lot while I wrote this review, don't judge me), I've learned that when you come to these upscale restaurants, you have to have an open mind & open palate, or else you won't enjoy your experience.

He will be turning the operation over to Matthew Kirkely at the end of the year. I wanted to visit Coi one last time before Patterson moves on and we had an amazing experience. The chef was personally serving birthday cakes to patrons on this Saturday evening.  It was a nice personal touch.\n\nThe cellar wine pairings were unique and delicious, I enjoyed the chat with the somm about the pairings and the background information on the wine and winemakers.

Reading phrases like \"tasted bland\" or \"I didn't want lamb, so they gave me chicken - I expected beef\" are just surreal. This is literally the best restaurant I've been to in almost a decade.\n\nFirst, if you go to a restaurant that emphasizes an ultra-modern tasting menu, you should know how they operate. Their menus are rarely the same for long because they use what's \"best\" that day, week, or season. They spend literally man-hours of time preparing each meal, and each one is a work of art as much as it's an actual food. Even the plate under the food is carefully chosen - for one dish that was a bit hard to scoop onto a spoon, it was served in a dish with a short (so you can get your spoon over it) but narrow-diameter lip (so it's close to the food you need to scoop up) and a wide, flat rim rather than a deep bowl. I'd be surprised if there were more than a few dozen restaurants in the world that pay attention to details that minute.\n\nAnd if you don't want something on the menu, you take what they have in the fridge. You don't complain about their not choosing beef.\n\nOur meal was filled with dishes that all had clever twists. We didn't care for one or two of them, but even those were perfectly prepared and plated. Here are two examples of tiny details that are just so critical in a top-shelf presentation:\n\n1. An early dish in the set was asparagus topped with Oscietra caviar with a Yuzu Anglaise. I wish I had taken a picture, but you can Google it if you want. Asparagus is usually a mix of textures - a thick chewy stalk, a slender, more tender end, and then a very bushy, broccoli-like tip. This dish was served with three centers precisely cut to be tender but also the same width, so the texture was even in every bite. But BEYOND that, the tip was cut off, then a thin slice was cut out of the center of it and placed back ON each stalk, which matched the texture of the tip to the rest of the stalk. This is a very clever twist - basically, disassembling and re-making the asparagus into something still TOTALLY recognizable, but definitely a cut above throwing a few steamed stalks down next to a steak.\n\n2. When dessert was served, there was a chocolate element. The top of each chocolate piece was tiled and smooth - beautiful to look at. But there was a candied fruit topping as well - on the BOTTOM of each piece. This made for a beautiful presentation while at the same time putting the additional element against your tongue as you bit into each piece - where it belongs.\n\nI was a little confused during the meal about who was serving each role. We asked for wine advice (which is a little unfair - I know exactly what I want - I just like the experience) and somebody who I thought would have been the sommelier worked his way through a few comments about my choice. But another gentleman who I had pegged as the head waiter spent plenty of time with us throughout the meal chatting about other wines, and actually seemed a lot more knowledgeable. This is a pretty opinionated topic.\n\nIn case you're curious I chose a Chassagne Montrachet, of which they actually had two selections (Ramonet and Niellon - I went with Niellon). Coi's menu is very heavy on fish and shellfish, and this wine paired very well with everything except the appetizer and dessert. You could do a lot worse than a French White Burgundy in a seafood meal, and at $157/bottle this was actually reasonably priced for an in-restaurant purchase (I've paid $85 online for the same bottle and year). I do believe their port prices are a little high considering the selection - I expect to pay double for an in-restaurant purchase... but not quadruple...\n\nI expected to pay through the nose for the experience and am not complaining about the prices. But I would definitely echo another reviewer - they add a 20% service charge automatically, and it is VERY subtle on the receipt. Unlike the other reviewer I DID miss this until we were literally walking out, which means I tipped like 45%. That's a hell of a tip. I wrote it off because it was a hell of a meal from a hell of a team - honestly, it was worth EVERY penny. But just pay close attention to yours.\n\nI would definitely come here again - we spent 4 wonderful hours here and had just a DELIGHTFUL time.\n\nOh, one more thing - we were DECIDEDLY under-dressed for our visit. We were wearing pretty ratty tourist clothes, T-shirts, that kind of thing. Our visit was a spur-of-the-moment thing and we were actually staying in Los Gatos. There was no way we were trekking back and forth to change. I know SF is the kind of place folks like Zuck wander around in hoodies - but just want to say the wait staff didn't even blink - we didn't feel unwelcome or awkward at all.", "author": "Chad R."}

I can't even imagine how it was created. like miniature painted food. every dish had us oohing and aahing. it's a tasting menu and the servings seem tiny, but so much flavor in every bite. by the end, it was definitely enough food. \n\nI think all four of us liked the Dungeness crab plate the most. I'll upload pictures because I can't do justice to the platings with words.\n\nthe service was perfect. the whole staff was friendly and were able to describe the dishes and answer questions. it's so nice to see staff who are clearly happy in their job and love to talk about it. so refreshing, especially when staff at other 2- and 3-star Michelin restaurants put on haughty airs and do not treat the customers with respect. \n\nthe space is beautiful. elegant, clean and understated. very few tables, maybe 15(?) in the main dining room. there's a window where you can peek into the kitchen and see the magic being created.\n\nwine is exorbitantly priced. I think they might do this because they don't want people drinking too much so they can concentrate on the food. for example, a half bottle of Billecart-Salmon rose, which retails for about $37 is $125. I'm not even sure if they have a liquor license, maybe just wine. corkage is $40 for the first bottle and $80 (!) for the second. wine pairing adds $180 to the price per person, but to be honest, I think I would pay for that next time. the wines in the pairing were all excellent and trying to find one or two bottles that would pair well with the meal would be difficult (well, except champagne, which would have gone well with every course last night). they also offer a tea pairing for $70 which one person in our party had and it was a very interesting way to taste different teas during the meal. all the teas were from a shop in SF and sourced from Taiwan and China. it's almost too much tea for one person, but I would bet they'd split it, especially if you were buying wine too :)\n\noverall, a wonderful experience. very expensive, but worth every penny", "author": "Bob U."}

Overall it was very mediocre, no dish wowed me at all and I don't feel like coming back again. \n\nThe ambiance was very good. \n\nThe service appeared to be good but there were two things to mention. If you order a beer, they'll pull half into your glass and tell you they put the rest in fridge for you at back. And later they totally forgot about that and just take your glass away after you finish that half bottle. Second They charge a 20% tip automatically and if you don't read the menu and receipt carefully you may end up paying double tip.\n\nThe food was very very good looking but the taste was very plain. There was nothing bad but also nothing so amazing. We started with seafood appetizer then seafood mains but ended with a very strange pigeon main with a pigeon head, heart and one feet on the plate. I'm Chinese and I still found it a bit disgusting. The pigeon meat was really greasy too. We ended with three desserts which were nothing special. \n\nPhotos attached.", "author": "Grace Z."}

Too frequently there is a point in a tasting menu where you feel overwhelmed with food and just want to call it a night. This does not happen at Coi. The food, primarily seafood, is light and paced very appropriately. Not so fast that you get stuffed and not so slow that you become bored. And most importantly, the execution of the dishes is about as close to perfect as I've ever seen. \nThe environment is very simple but also very warm and inviting. \nWe visited all four of the 3-star Michelin restaurants within the city limits in the past week and Coi is a strong number 2, possibly number 1. \nIf we get the opportunity to visit San Francisco again, we will definitely go back.", "author": "David F."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-02-18", "description": "I never got around to trying this place before Daniel Patterson's departure, but I had the opportunity to check out Chef Kirkley's new opening menu recently. \n\nThe daily tasting menu is seafood-focused and comprises 12 courses ($225/person). Each dish was certainly tasty but some were more memorable than others; highlights included the ocean trout and the turbot. Presentation was creative and top-notch - the turbot featured \"scales\" made of round slices of vegetables, for example. \n\nThere are wine pairings available, in addition to a non-alcoholic tea pairing, which I thought was unique. They also offer quarter-bottles of wines using the Coravin system; I certainly liked the pinot noir ($98) that I tried but ultimately wasn't sure if it was worth the premium over the regular (and much more reasonably-priced) options. \n\nService was professional and polished, as you would expect - a tad on the colder side though. The minimalist/modern decor made for a pleasantly relaxed yet upscale experience. \n\nWhereas tasting menus at many other restaurants avoid the fine dining clich\u00e9 of tiny portions, the courses at Coi are relatively small and while I didn't leave hungry, I felt the meal should have been more substantial. For that reason, I found myself attempting to justify our dinner by looking at it more as a gastronomic experience rather than an actual meal. To that end, it was definitely a delightful dining experience and I wouldn't mind coming back in the future.", "author": "Oliver L."}

We had a great time and everything looked and was very nice until we left the restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-16", "description": "My boyfriend and I wanted to try Coi out since it was highly rated and was different from most restaurants we frequent, being that Coi doesn't give you the option to order your own selections.  \n\nWe had to book our reservation about 2 months in advanced, so I figured this place must be worth the price of the 12 course meal.\n\nWhen we arrived, we were seated shortly after right at the doorway.  I am not sure where the rest of the restaurant was since all we were able to see were about 5 tables in the room we were in.  The ambiance was very dark and mysterious.  It also had a cold, timid atmosphere that wasn't too inviting.  I felt like we had to whisper because the tables were close to each other and the vibe was so quiet.\n\nWe always order a bottle of wine when going out to eat and we settled on a Pinot Noir that I am assuming the Sommelier wasn't pleased with.  He never came to our table to introduce himself; however, when he asked us what we were going to order to drink and we told him, he said, \"Have you ever had this before?  Are you sure you want to order this?  This is not a good choice\".  We stood firm to our decision due to the impolite nature of the man's attitude towards our wine selection and we were completely embarrassed by all of the stares with everyone thinking that we didn't know how to choose wine.  My thoughts are this....if the wine is on a restaurant's menu, that wine should be good enough to be ordered.  Otherwise, it shouldn't be on the menu to begin with.\n\nThe man brought out the wine and before we could taste it to see if we liked it or not, he swept it away and said he was going to bring something different.  I must admit that the wine he did bring out was a lot better, but we would have appreciated his recommendation a lot more had he treated us with more respect and explained why this wine was better instead of ridiculing us.\n\n We were brought out all 12 courses back to back by different servers each time.  The dinner was so impersonal since we didn't get a chance to connect with any of the 5-6 servers we had that brought the food out.  The servers would bring out a plate, whisper what was on it, and walk away.  It was the most bizarre serving experience I've ever seen.\n\nThe best of the night was the Wild King Salmon.  It was rich with flavor, yet light and delicate to the taste and touch.  Unfortunately, of the other 11 courses, nothing I ate wowed me or met my expectations of what I thought would be served.  I was highly displeased.\n\nAfter racking up a $650 dollar bill for just two people, I can 100% say that it was not a good experience at all.  The food was mediocre at best and the service was so below par that I wouldn't revisit Coi regardless of anything else.  \n\nI feel that there are tons of better restaurants out there that you can walk out feeling good that you came, full with happiness, and not regretful.", "author": "Lily M."}

To make a long story short, I didn't realize I'd be eating there until the morning of my reservation, but I'm so glad I kept it and trekked up to San Francisco - I had a fantastic evening here (and sat at the table next to Mark Zuckerberg)!\n\nDaniel Patterson is known for his vegetable-centric menus and touches of molecular gastronomy. Over the years, those personal stylings have winnowed a bit but are still visible in the tasting menu at Coi. Obvious talent and time was required for each of the fantastic dishes presented to us, and each dish burst with its own unique flavors. \n\nAmuse bouches consisted of puffed brown rice chips, a blood orange & peppercorn shaved ice, and a smoked sous-vided egg with caviar and creme fraiche. These were each lovely starters that demonstrated bits of molecular gastronomy while not being over-the-top or compromised in flavor or texture. 4/5\n\nGrilled spot prawn, fermented carrot juice, cucumber, opal basil: I thought I loved spot prawns before but this blew me away. I was initially disappointed to see that they were so small, but delighted when they were tender with no tough sinews or small veins. These were warm, perfectly grilled, and uniform in texture despite one being straight and one curly in everybody's bowls. The fermented carrot juice added a mild acidity to the prawns, and I loved the herbal opal basil. 5/5\n\nAsparagus cooked in its juice, wheatgrass pur\u00e9e, sprouted rye berries: This. Was. INCREDIBLE! It didn't even taste like a vegetable. Crisp but whole, almost like it was made up of a single vegetal cell. It was refreshing, minimally acidity, and almost savory. There's no doubting that this was the single best vegetable I've ever had. 5/5\n\nAndante fresh buffalo milk cheese, beet, endive, honey, mint: I like any water buffalo cheese for its lighter, milder flavor. The vegetables, honey, and mint components made for a tasty tiny cheese course. 4/5\n\nDungeness crab and ham hock soup, spring vegetables, ginger, lemongrass, cilantro: While I loved the crab, the broth was really deep and too smoky for my tastes. I loved the lemongrass and ginger that gave it a bit of a Thai taste to it. But overall it wasn't my favorite dish of the night. 3/5\n\nSteamed morel-potato dumpling, braised lettuce, green garlic, thyme: The amount of time and labor that went into this dish stuns me. It's like a lasagna of scalloped potatoes and mushroom mousse. For the mousse, the morels were boiled down for a day, strained, reduced some more, and then whipped. The potato slices seemed to have been soaking in cream for a long time and were very rich and tender. The chef had to \"frost\" these mini dumplings like a layered cake and then tweeze the florets of more morels on the top to give it a nice lacy look. The light sauce was a nice brown butter, green garlic, and morel broth that just further enhanced the earthy sweetness of the dumplings. This is definitely not a dish you'll find anywhere else, and we loved it!! 5/5\n\nEmigh Ranch lamb, chard leaves and stems, garum, rosemary: The rare lamb was perfectly executed in that it had full flavor but none of the stringiness or sinewy textures that are often found in rarer racks. It was crusted with pepper and rosemary, which clung like a skin to the meat. And the garum sauce that was very subtly brushed onto it was a great flavor enhancement. A great dish, but it was too big compared to the other courses (about 8 oz). 4/5\n\nCoconut mochi bun, kiwi, shiso leaf: These were a show-stopper. The mochi were made from the flour of sweet rice (rather than the typical glutinous rice) and coconut meat, making for a delectably sweet, almondy outer wrap that reminded me of sugar cookie dough. The kiwi and shiso were light flavorful touches that gave the dessert extra Japanese edge. Doughy, sweet, and tasty! 5/5\n\nGlazed Strawberries, black sesame licorice, wild fennel sherbet: Each component was full-flavored and strong, but managed to come together for a lovely dessert course. 4.5/5\n\nSteamed vanilla cake, rhubarb, hibiscus: The texture combinations were fantastic. The cake had a spongey consistency like a Hostess while the rhubarb had been boiled down and cooled into a jelly. Lots of great tastes and textures. 4.5/5\n\nYuzu marmalade marshmallow dipped in valrono dark chocolate: The weakest bite of the night. The yuzu flavor was very minimal, and the smoky dark chocolate was really the only note I could taste. 2.5/5\n\nPortions were comparable to most tasting menus, with the exception of the gigantic rack of lamb. The service was spectacular and I didn't want the meal to ever end. I will be back in the future!", "author": "Jennifer B."}

Pair that with their list of vintage wines, the grandest ambience and the nicest staff - I'm not surprised one bit that this is a two-Michelin starred restaurant. Now I'm going to obnoxiously list out each item we had the pleasure of trying from the tasting menu, it's only right since I've already spent hours and hours wondering about how these amazing dishes came to be.\n\n+Geoduck clam: This was actually the dish I was least impressed with, but that's because I'm really not a fan of clams. The impressively thin, tiny buckwheat crepe was so cute though! Definitely got me excited for what was coming up next... \n+Asparagus with soo much caviar and yuzu: mmmm, this was so flavorful! I love caviar, and the yuzu sauce provided the perfect citrusy punch to dip with the asparagus. \n+++Ocean trout: this is when you know you're in for a treat, and that you're life is about to get better. I had never heard about citrus confit, and plain kumquats will never taste as fabulous anymore.\n++Turbot: I've never had turbot before, so I was really excited to try this fish! Apparantly, turbot doesn't naturally have scales but the chef \"added\" scales using grated vegetables to decorate the fish. It made for such a beautiful dish, and delicious, crunchy texture with the soft fish - loved this dish! \n+++ At this time, we were given beautifully constructed butter that was shaped like ribbon with bread (a surprise treat outside from the tasting menu!) We proceeded to drop everything and just eat this charming, delicious whipped butter. For my Indian readers, this is the first time I had butter in America that reminded me of India's Amul, yummm. \n+++Cornish hen: I was sadly super stuffed by this time, so I couldn't enjoy this dish as much as I knew I would have at any other moment. Beautifully constructed hors d'oeuvre-like dish. So good, insanely difficult to describe - guess you will need to just try it yourself so stay hungry for this one (; \n+++ And right when I was done eating for the next few days, we started the sweet portion of the tasting menu. I guess there's always room for dessert - three different kinds of desserts, in fact. Those little matcha chocolate bars, almond cookies (that the server was kind enough to give us seconds of), the pistachio and rhubarb layered mini cakes - I was in heaven.

It once stood as the only SF 2 star Michelin restaurant flanked by Cyrus to the north and Manresa to the south. When i first started eating here, chef Patterson was very into the way scents affected taste, and he worked with Mandy Aftel, her essential oils and one of the dishes required  you to wear a perfume wile you ate a dish. Back then you could also eat in the lounge area, with a separate menu (which i never tried unfortunately) being able to get two different dining experiences. \n\nCut to present day, the space has been remodeled, there's no lounge anymore and a 4 day a week tasting menu is de facto now. Ive been to many winery and guest chef dinners and can safely say, Coi has evolved into a great ingredient driven restaurant. Chef Patterson is also a great leader in pushing SF cuisine beyond it's farm to table only safety net.  Ive had many fascinating and challenging meals here. As some who is always looking for new dining experiences, Coi continues to surprise me. The staff have also always been great at taking care of us and as i continue to go, it's more and more comfortable. It's great to see the current crop of innovative 2*'places in SF now, in which Coi helped pave the way for.", "author": "Kim N."}

The dishes were one noted, lacking the complexity and surprise I'd come to expect for a restaurant in this category. There was no delight or joy on the palate, just befuddlement (geoduck tasted fishy, caviar and egg was just pedestrian, and every dish that came out just fell flat with exception to the cherry tomatoes. That was the only highlight to this otherwise depressing meal). Utterly underwhelmed for a price tag of $215 plus 20% service charge per person. The incessant upscale for beverage pairings (asked no less than four times) was annoying. Get yourselves tickets to Lazy Bear or go have a relaxing meal at Quince. Your money will be much better spent there.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-08-11", "description": "This place has been on my list for a long time. Finally went tonight to celebrate a birthday. Unfortunately, I think my hopes were set too high way before I even set foot in their door. \n\nAmbiance: tastefully decorated, earthy theme with stones and foliage throughout. dinnerware (silverware, plates/bowls, wine glasses) were nice. Not too crowded and can easily have a conversation. \n\nWait staff: attentive, extremely so...but lacking in intimacy and true sincerity (at least thats the vibe I got)...almost well rehearsed and robot like at times (though this is not every single staff)\n\nFood: $175 for the tasting menu. 8 official courses, but really you get 12 if you count the first 3 and the last 1. Of the 12, 4 were exceptional, the other 8 were just okay (which is not a good sign for a michelin star restaurant). Overall, it left me wanting more. (-1 star)\n\nWine pairing: $115 for 8 pairings. They pour you enough wine for 2 sips, and I'm not even exaggerating. The manager poured one of our glasses, and he poured more (maybe enough for 4 sips). The pairings did not stand out for the most part, they seemed hastily put together...except for the last dessert dish (gooseberry baba). You might be better off ordering a bottle. (-1 star)\n\nCleanliness: at least 3 fruit flies constantly circled our table and landed on wine glasses a few times. Waiter apologized for the fruit fly presence once, but didn't seem to care enough or able enough to do anything about it. This took away a lot from the experience, and I was definitely not expecting to find fruit flies in this restaurant. (-1 star)\n\nvalue: damage was 750 for 2 people, NOT WORTH IT!\n\nThe dishes that hit the spot were the dessert dishes. With that said, the chef may be better off opening a pastry/dessert shop. While there was nothing to complain about, I was expecting a lot more given their publicity and michelin caliber. Money, value, palates will enjoy Benu a lot more than Coi (funnily enough, the waiter asked if we've been to benu...seems that they might compare themselves to benu...not really a comparison, two entirely different leagues). \n\nSee below for the breakdown of each dish. \n\n1. brown rice chips with avocado puree: fresh tasting avocado, the chips didnt add much to it though\n\n2. plum sorbet: essentially frozen and finely shaved/crushed ice made from plum juice. Creative. \n\n3. smoked egg with caviar and creme fraiched: this was one of the four dishes that were done well. the egg yolk was prepared to perfection, with a very interesting texture. the caviar contributed to the flavor and the creme fraiche topped everything off. \n\n4. live shrimp with compressed watermelon: the shrimp was fresh, melons fresh...thats about it. \n\n5. beets: beets were sweet (but they generally are), overall bland...but seriously who would serve beats just by itself as one of the courses (especially given the michelin star and the price for the tasting menu)\n\n6. eggplant soup with chickpea puree: this dish was beautiful to look at. but it was too powerful and salty. \n\n7. cherry tomatoes with seaweed: see my comment about the beets. \n\n8. steamed wild salmon with cucumber salad: fresh tasty salmon, the sauce and cucumber salad went well together. \n\n9. dry aged beef: comes with a small slice of beef fat, the beef was wonderfully cooked and had great flavor. BUT, I think the cut of steak had more to do with the quality, and not really the chef. This dish was solid, but it was not really inventive (aside from the beef fat). \n\n10. strawberry glazed with pectin: sweet strawberries, the pectin only complimented it. Wonderful yet simple. This was one of the 4 dishes that were done well.\n\n11. whipped coconut: another one of the dishes done well, the coconut was delicious.\n\n12. gooseberry baba: essentially white cake soaked in gooseberry juice topped with some kind of icing and honeycomb. this was my favorite, and the last of the four dishes that stood out. Also came with an excellently paired wine.\n\n13. chocolate ganoche: wonderful flavor, almost like Dibs ice cream.", "author": "Long C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-12-07", "description": "***While I do not love Coi as much as Saison, Atelier Crenn, Manresa, or Benu, Coi's food can be both delicious and impressive; in a city full of innovative restaurants, Coi's utilizes seasonal, local produce to create several simple but very pure and enlightening courses that are hard to top***\n\nI did not love my first experience at Coi.  There were several great plates of food, but Coi just did not measure up to other highly regarded restaurants in the area like the unique gem Saison.  Coi underwent a re-design a year or so ago and the restaurant looks great.  The room is much more contemporary now and the dining room's unique location within the building provides an intimate and exclusive feeling experience.\n\nCoi is still doing a single tasting menu only approach though I enjoyed the presentations more on this visit and the food felt more vibrant.  The food was still on the dainty side, but there was just too much delicious and one-of-a-kind food here to ignore this restaurant's greatness.\n\nMy favorite plate of the night was the soup course, which was a reinvention of the fall classic butternut squash soup.  Instead of just having a thick and sweet soup, their soup combined a creamy, rich and sweet butternut squash custard that was topped with a warm and comforting butternut squash and apple consomme, crisp and tart apples, and crunchy pumpkin seeds.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#4Fiac5CzwblEGtL8dOG2nw\n\nI also really liked their Santa Barbara uni course, which was very refreshing.  Sweet and creamy uni was paired with a risotto-like mix of kohlrabi, crisp radishes and bright yuzu.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#TTd21eNNOjmrUkrOTxnyiQ\n\nA traditional caviar flavor combination was made more special by the smoking of egg yolk in olive oil; the smoked flavor was prominent alongside the salty and briny caviar, the light creme fraiche, and the chives.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#oguKOcvDxC6SoNfN0gVQJg\n\nThe beet was good too with a meaty but soft center contrasted against a crispy and petrified-like skin.  I liked the garnish of mustard greens though the miso sauce did not stand out much.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#K5yHY9lZ9cuY0q37FGXlJQ\n\nNon-protein dishes really shined.  I loved the silky potato and pine needle puree topped with perfectly grilled matsutake mushrooms.  The ability of the kitchen to achieve so much textural and flavor depth in the mushroom was impressive as you can feel and taste each mushroom and biting into the mushroom allowed the squishy rubberiness of it to shine; it also allowed its flavor to develop and change.\n\nSome of the more substantial courses were still light.  Seasonal and warm dungeness crab was wrapped in celtuce and then paired with bitter greens and a fragrant tarragon puree.  There is definitely a lot of simplicity here as Coi tries to achieve a purity in the ingredients' flavors as opposed to showcasing assertive seasoning or sauces that take over the plate.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#XSa1AQnz3VsUkmeaEcFoBg\n\nI did feel the New York Strip could have used a more assertive approach though.  It was the most substantial course and it was a little boring to eat as the flavors were not as great as the other courses that preceded it.  The seaweed encrusted beef was nicely cooked; it was tender and moist.  I really liked the fragrant parsley puree as well as the brown butter and bone marrow roasted cauliflower, but I wish the steak had a stronger beef flavor.\n\nDesserts had bright spots like a caramelized cake, a perfectly poached pear and a crunchy and nutty pistachio tuile, but I wish there was one dessert that matched the great things the kitchen was able to achieve with the savory courses.\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/coi-san-francisco?select=76lIRThFzVDmAVjrT6khGg#s6MdzdQ84xh7JW4VRRvdrQ\n\nService was excellent.  The food came out at an even pace while the staff was professional and polite but still personable and welcoming.\n\nPrices are high and portions are small, but Coi serves several impressive, elegant and unique courses that you will not find at many restaurants in the U.S.\n\nI was significantly more impressed with this trip to Coi than my first visit a few years ago.  It could be the season (this trip was during the fall while my last trip was in spring or summer), but I actually think the team and kitchen has evolved more as the food has become more vibrant.  The restaurant's point of view too--its goal to achieve and celebrate the purity, flavor and texture of each ingredient--came across much more on this visit and really illustrated how unique this restaurant is in an area filled with many innovative fine dining restaurants.\n\nMetered street parking is available.", "author": "Anthony N."}

Poached and grilled lamb was the signature also my favorite for the night. It was served with chard leaves and stems, garum, rosemary. Overall, 85% of dishes were pretty good and I did enjoy them. However, I personally think this place is TOTALLY overpriced because when I was in L'Atelier de Jo\u00ebl Robuchon, I thought Robuchon was pricey but it was worth ittotally because the foods there were SO GOOD.  \nI won't go back to Coi again. 1st of all, it is too overpriced; 2nd, the food is ok good only, of course except the lamb. 3rd, some wine didn't pair well with the food.

At L20, at least 5 dishes had foie, and the crab dishes were his best. I understand adopting to local ingredients, but don't abandon your go to items.

Coi really is an uber foodie experience because every dish highlights the main ingredients versus hiding them in sauces and foam. \n\nThe food is near flawlessly executed, beautiful presentations, perfect pacing, service...all the things you expect for $$$$.  That said, we came away a little sleepy near the end, where we felt the progression of the 12 courses was just a tad disjointed.  Herein is the challenge with a multi-course pre fix meal, where people are going to react differently based on their particular tastes.  Maybe we didn't quite get the theme, or was it purposely a little summer and a little fall?  It was on our drive home, reflecting back on the meal and particular dishes that we said 'wow' that was amazing in hindsight.\n\nWe also had a chance to chat with Chef Daniel Patterson when he came out to deliver my special dessert (since I can't eat melon), about his appearance in Japan, where top chefs from all over the world converge to make a dish based on what they can forage from the countryside and inspired by a hand-made ceramic plates.  Even asked our opinion of the special dessert, that was in development for future menus.  The sense of ownership and enthusiasm for his restaurant and craft really shows.  It really doesn't get much better than this.\n\nI highly recommend Coi, but be prepared and in the mood for a very food focused experience.  Many nicer restaurants in SF follow the bar-lounge trend, big open kitchens, lots of noise, conversation....very lively.  Coi on the other hand insulates you from the street, it's hushed, elegant while still comfortable.  It's all about the food and service, you feel pampered without any sense of intrusiveness.  Ask any question about the food or wine and get knowledgeable responses.  It's not your weekly dinner out, for most of us, but worth the splurge for a special occasion.", "author": "Tom S."}

Well not quite...I would say overall 3.5 stars.\n\nHubby decided to take me here for my bday dinner this year. Although the food was good, there were only a few courses that i thought were great. Definitely none of the dishes left me \"ooing and ahhing.\" I guess the problem with California cuisine, the emphasis is on vegetables and foraging and local ingredients....which is really awesome, but not if the bulk of the dishes is mainly veggies. I mean i'm all for vegeterian food as I don't eat red meat (but that's why they offer a veggie menu). Out of the 14 dishes, only 3 dishes consistent of any type of meat. There was the spotted prawn dish, the abalone dish, and then a lamb dish. I mean for all the $$$$ you're forking out, you expect to get top notch seafood, meat, poultry, the whole works. I had a similar experience from Commis in Oakland.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the service and the presentation of the food were great, but for me, the most important thing is the flavor. My favorite dishes of the night were the inverted fromage blanc tart, the celtuce, and the peaches and cream dessert. I felt there were too many dessert dishes. I didn't enjoy the frozen lime marshmallow dish, and our server took note and actually offered us a different dessert in addition to a bday dessert for a total of 6 desserts! At this point i was full beyond belief, but felt pressured into eating (at least a few bites) as i didn't want to offend. \n\nFor a 2 michelin star restaurant, and the cost, i really expected more. Call me jaded...but I'm really beginning to dislike these tasting menus. The french laundry ruined me forever.", "author": "Gina N."}

Sure, at this pricepoint, customers demand attention to every detail. I get why some of the prior Yelp reviews are mixed - people have very high expectations. All I can say is that our experience was flawless. Truly spectacular. \n\nThe private room was lovely - I'm not sure why they offered it to us (we're just regular folks splurging on a nice meal to celebrate a special occasion) but we jumped at the chance. \n\nCoi is in a, shall we say, \"transitional\" area. The strip clubs around it are an odd but colorful neighbor for fine dining.  We'll call it part of the experience. I was invited in to one of the clubs as I walked by, before the dancer on the patio saw my wife just behind me. \n\nOk, so the name Coi is a little pretentious, but in a charming personality enhancement kind of way.  I probably should be embarrassed but before our visit I was (incorrectly) referring to the restaurant [phonetically] as \"coy\". Upon entering I was diplomatically corrected - it is \"kwah\". Ok, the French pronunciation. Got it.  Now let's talk about the food.\n\nEvery bite was special. We started (consecutively) with a brown puffed rice cracker and a grape ice with salt - both were interesting teasers for the variety set to come. I liked the caviar on the poached egg yolk - one of my favorite bites of the night. The geoduck was a particular treat. I'd never had geoduck before, although I knew it as the alien outer-space looking curveball ingredient from Top Chef and other cooking shows. The cherry tomatoes from the Chef's garden, lovingly peeled, and served in olive oil was another highlight - so simple but so perfect. Our salmon dish was cooked perfectly but didn't seem crazy innovative. Still, it was phenomenal. The summer corn served in broth was interesting as one of 11 dishes but I'm not sure I would have ordered it on its own.  I was looking forward to the potato dumplings but this was the one dish that I didn't quite get. It was beautiful and elegant and delicate but I did not love the flavors. I thought the pastured beef in the seaweed powder with cauliflower, pickled cauliflower and parsley pur\u00e9e was superlative-worthy. I thought it was absolutely fantastic. I preferred the raspberry to the melons and I loved the frozen dark chocolate with the infused marshmallow inside. It was crazy how when I bit in, I tasted the chocolate and the marshmallow and then maybe a full second later I was hit with a citrus explosion - how did they do that? \n\nWonderful meal. Loved it. My wife did too - great birthday. Thank you, Coi!", "author": "Michael S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "KenScale: 8.5/10\n\nCoi has long been one of the stand-out institutions in San Francisco, headed by legendary chef Daniel Patterson known for his seasonal cooking that opened the way for a new term \"California cuisine.\" His use of fresh ingredients from nature have won him numerous praises, and Coi has been the primary lab where his magic has been happening. I had very high expectations stepping into the quiet and modern dining room. The tasting menu at Coi (running at around $195 per person) was indeed a very good demonstration of chef Patterson's philosophy. On the other hand, perhaps because of my goal of eating meals I would probably not be able to in NYC, the dishes from Coi seemed somewhat repetitive to other fine dining places I had been to. Don't get me wrong: a meal at Coi is great, but the level of originality and inventiveness I was expecting may have been lacking a bit.\n\nThe meal started with a series of snacks. I was both a fan of the light grace ice accompanied by wild bay salt as well as California sturgeon caviar that came with egg yolk, creme fraiche and chive. While the display of live Santa Barbara sea urchin was pretty impressive, I was expecting a surprise in its flavor and texture (still a very good dish). An assortment of vegetables (chicories and young leeks) somewhat felt flat, and I wish the beet's texture was slightly juicier. Dungeness crab and beef tendon soup came with flavor of Asian pear and cilantro that created pretty unique sensation, but it didn't work as much I had expected. Other dishes were definitely a lot more successful. I enjoyed every bite of black trumpet-sunchoke dumpling whose texture was sensational. I couldn't stop thinking about the lamb loin wrapped in herbs and cabbage. Flavored with mustard and miso, the perfectly cooked lamb was a pure delight and worked harmoniously with the vegetable wrap. Desserts were also mostly very delicious. Burnt grapefruit and spiced coffee cake (which came with dried plum, walnut and mascarpone) were not overly sweet, yet offered a complexity of flavor that I cherished every second.  \n\nCoi has a unique ticketing system where you can purchase tickets online (other leading American restaurants like Alinea has adopted this concept). Make sure you check early to see if there is an opening. The restaurant seems to advertise itself as a fine dining institution, but I felt the services were somewhat not to the standard you would normally expect in similar fine dining places such as server overlooking my plate to see if I was done or taking away my wine glass before I was finished once I ordered another glass. Otherwise, the dining experience was very pleasant accompanied by a glass or two of California wine, and I was offered a quick tour of the kitchen and even had a chance to talk and take photos with chef Patterson himself! I was absolutely too starstruck to say anything much but remember asking him if he has thought about opening a new restaurant in NYC (right now, he seems too preoccupied with conquering the Bay Area, with a new restaurant in Mission named Aster opening soon). Coi probably doesn't have that flash of brilliance that will wow you over and over, but I really liked the faithful execution of the meal that used a combination of fresh ingredients. It is an iconic restaurant in San Francisco that is worth visiting.", "author": "Ken S."}

I simply wasn't \"wow'ed\" by the overall experience. Will you get a good meal here? Absolutely! Is it worth the hefty price tag? Meh... I'm not so sure.\n\nMade reservations for the BF's birthday a few weeks ago. Diners can do so easily via OpenTable with a credit card. Note: If you cancel within 72 hours, your card is charged a fee. Makes sense, they're holding a table on your behalf, which is worth a pretty penny! The staff will call a few days before your scheduled meal to confirm your reservation and check for any food allergies. Really nice, personal touch.\n\nParking nearby is also pretty easy, especially on weekends. The restaurant is tucked away in an unassuming part of North Beach/Telegraph Hill. Tons of free meters after 6 pm. There's also valet parking if you'd prefer not to hoof it up a SF hill. \n\nOur table was ready when we arrived. The decor is simple, with lots of natural wood and lots of textures in with the fabrics (sofa, pillows). We sat near the front of the restaurant, I guess you could call it the lounge? As many of the diners nearby noticed, the tables in this area are incredibly uncomfortable. I'm a pretty small person and found the leg room lacking. Plus, I kept hitting my knees on the legs. My parents have a very fancy dining table with the same problem.\n\nSeasonal menu cost $195/person, plus we each opted for the small wine pairings at $95 each. That means wine with every other course. Mind you, it's a very small dribble of wine. Not that I need an entire jug of White Zinfandel to be happy, but come on... Yes, it's fancy vino and a tasting at that, but it's a very small amount of wine. You're better off purchasing a bottle or bringing something special and paying a corkage fee.\n\nHere's what was served:\n+ Sno-Cone: blood orange ice, pink peppercorn, black limento do sagiergg\n+ California Sturgeon Caviar: egg yolk poached in smoke oil, creme fraiche, chive\n+ Grilled Oyster: seaweed bread, wild greens\n+ Asparagus Cooked In Its Juice: sour orange, almond\n+ Andants Fresh Buffalo Milk Cheese: beet, honey, mint, flowers\n+ Dungeness Crab Soup: spring vegetables, lemongrass, cilantro\n+ Steamed Black Trumpet-Sunchoke Dumpling: braised lettuce, brown butter, mushroom dashi\n+ Dry Aged Pastured Beef: Meyer lemon kosho, cabbage\n+ Coconut Mochi Bun: kiwi, shisho\n+ Grapefruit: ginger, black pepper, tarragon\n+ Vanilla Cake: rhubarb, hibiscus\n\nMy favorite dishes included the sturgeon with egg - it was divine! I also loved the buffalo milk cheese - the flavor was superb! The other dishes were fine, the presentation very lovely, just nothing that I fell in love with. Daniel Patterson even came to our table and brought us our plates for one of the courses. He's incredibly humble and understated, even though everyone know's he's a pretty big deal.\n\nMy biggest complaint? The pacing was pretty swift. With all of the courses listed above, we were in and out of there in a little over two hours. No one rushed us out or anything, we were simply done. There were also open tables inside the restaurant, so it's not like anyone was dropping hints that we needed to leave. If you're dropping serious bank (or at least a lot of money in my opinion) on a meal, I guess it should take longer than that?\n\nYes, I've dined at nice restaurants before. Nice restaurants that offer seasonal tasting menus. Seasonal tasting menus that are pricey. This just isn't the seasonal menu that I loved. At least not $800 loved, but hey, that's me.", "author": "Abby S."}

I never knew what to expect at eating at a Michelin Star restaurant. I had a four course meal at La Folie. Each dish at La Folie was presentable and filling. Being satisfied and stuffed I was impressed with my eating experience at La Folie. The experience exceeded all expectations and blew me away. The 5 star Yelp rating at La Folie was well deserved. After eating at La Folie I had an epiphany - a quest to eat at one Michelin Star restaurants. \n\nI haven't eaten at every one Michelin Star restaurants in the Bay Area. However I knew I would eventually eat at a two Michelin Stars restaurant. The problem was which ones to choose as my first 2 Michelin Stars restaurant. (The main advantage is there are fewer two Michelin Stars restaurants than one Michelin Star restaurants in the Bay Area.) \n\nThere were four reasons why I choose Coi for my first 2 Michelin Stars restaurant: 1) Anthony Bourdain has high praise for Daniel Patterson. 2) Coi was named as one of the Top 50 Restaurants in the world by Gayot. 3) Daniel Patterson just won James Beard for Best Chef in the West. 4) Most importantly Jennifer B, a fellow Yelper, invited me for dinner.\n\nLast Saturday night Jennifer and I ate here for dinner. One of our highlights for dinner was that Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook sat to my left. Instead of listing every course I will highlight the courses that stood out. The Sno-Cone was a play on the candy pop rocks with a slightly spicy bite. The slow cook egg yolk is a refined version of an egg tart yet it had a slight sweetness to it similar to an egg custard bun. The grill spot prawn was far away the best prawn or shrimp I ever had because it had the meatiest taste. This one, small prawn had the flavor and taste of 10 shrimps combined. The asparagus cooked in its own juice tasted so clean because it didn't have the earthy taste. If vegetables tasted as good as the asparagus I would eat more vegetables. The sweetness of the Dungeness crab and the saltiness of the ham hock soup mixed with vegetables had a texture of a refined Vietnamese soup pho, but without the noodles. One of the most pleasantly looking dishes was the steamed morel-potato dumpling. There were distinct layers of potato and morel that looking far away from a distance appeared like a refined dessert. Did it taste good? As Andrew Zimmern said if it looks good eat it. The layers of this dumpling presented contrasted depths of flavor. Another aspect of this dish was the brown butter broth because it accentuated the mushroom flavor. Even though most of the dishes are refined in portion the biggest portion of the meal was the lamb. The lamb was cooked like how I like most of my red meats rare. There were four dessert dishes. Out of the four the coconut mochi bun stood out. After the steamed morel-potato dumpling this was my second favorite dish of the night. In fact this dessert dish is one of the top 4 desserts I ever had at a fine dining restaurant. I loved the floury texture of the coconut mochi bun. I commented to Jennifer that after dinner we should go to Chinatown to get some mochi. \n\nNot only was this my first time at a two Michelin Stars restaurant but also my first experience with a tasting menu. With a tasting menu the large portions are substituted with smaller portions. It's all about the flavor of each dish. If done well the flavor of the dishes are strongly enhanced that it manipulates your hunger. At the end of your meal you should feel full. More than half of the dishes at Coi provided that feeling for me however not all the dishes were like this. I felt the brown rice crisp from the California Bowl was bland. The buffalo milk cheese didn't excite me. After having the coconut mochi bun the next three desserts the glazed strawberry, vanilla cake with rhubarb, and yuzu marshmallow couldn't match the elated joy I had with the coconut mochi bun.\n\nSince I didn't enjoy every dish I couldn't give Coi a perfect 5-star rating. In addition since this was my first experience at a two Michelin Stars restaurant I was wondering if my experience at Coi could match my first experience at a one Michelin Star restaurant La Folie. This is just me but my experience at Coi fell short to the euphoria I had at La Folie. My dining experience at Coi was really good, but not exceptionally outstanding as compared to La Folie. \n\nOverall from sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg, accompanying Jennifer, and eating dinner I had an entertaining evening at Coi. Thanks Jennifer B for including me on your reservation. Off to the next Michelin Star experience.", "author": "Gerald R."}

For a 9-course menu with wine pairing for 2 that costs $858, we are expecting a little more. Compare Coi to other notable restaurants like Benu, Gary Danko, and Michael Minna in our great city, I would skip it. Some courses in the menu is interesting but the protein dish is disappointing. They feature beef as their protein dish and offer to substitute with other protein, a grill chicken just seems too pedestrian. \n\nWhat is the most irritating part is the table has legs that makes it impossible not to hit your knee against it for the person who sits  close for the wall.

Frozen Mandarin Sour - Angostura Bitters, Kumquat, Satsuma Ice\n\nA light & wispy start; delicately shaved ice infused with bitter & salty kumquat flavors. The precision & quality made it much more impressive than your everyday snow cone. Amazing. \n\n2. Clam - Geoduck and Manila, Bull Kelp, Meyer Lemon, Wild Fennel\n\nChunks of raw clam adorned with kelp & some gelatinous concoction in the same shape & design as the kelp. Little sprigs of fennel provided a delicious contrast to the strong flavors of the sea.\n\n3. Pasture - Beets Roasted in Hay, Fresh Cheese, Wild Sprouts and Flowers\n\nOh sweet divine! The beets were crushed into a paste & mixed w/ mild farm cheese w/ chunks of beet to add texture. Garnished w/ edible flowers & leaves, some of which had stems with a strong bitter flavor to compliment the lightness of the beet mixture. Indescribably perfect!\n\n4. Crab Melt, California Style - Steffan's Lardo, Wheatgrass\n\nI thought nothing would beat #3, but this crab melt was just so rich & savory that it met the challenge. Distinct & creamy crab flavor fused onto a small piece of toast with ideal crispness. Delicate sprouts placed on the plate selectively & wheatgrass puree was lightly poured in a circle around the offering--this proved invaluable for dipping and balanced the creamy values. Wow.\n\n5. Farm Egg - Cauliflower, Nettle-Dandelion Salsa Verde\n\nAt this point we said, \"That's it. They can't beat what's been served.\" The next dish was a fried egg on top of vegetable salsa w/ croutons. When the fork entered the white of the egg, we realized it had actually been whipped into a creamed foam with amazing gastronomical properties. As I do, I saved the yolk for the end by first carefully enjoying the tangy dandelion salsa (crucial bitter accents). The yolk was softer than soft-boiled egg yolk--almost raw. As I sucked it in, I got a little misty at this sacred experience.\n\n6. Earth and Sea - Steamed Tofu Mousseline, Mushroom Dashi, Yuba, Fresh Seaweed\n\nReminded me of a soup we'd had in Kyoto in a kaiseki meal, except the flavors were a bit stronger (suited to a Westerner's palate). Tasted like dry tofu skin that's added to many Chinese soups. The mushrooms were soft & supple. A light & refreshing entree.\n\n7. Savory Wild Mushroom Porridge - Crisp Root Vegetables, Cress, Sherry\n\nA rich & buttery brown porridge w/ mushroom base. Cress garnish--the sherry was a foam that engulfed the entire dish & resembled dish-soap suds. The sherry bubbles were a light & tangy contrast to the rich porridge. The crisp root vegetables looked like little oddly shaped potato chips, similar consistency, but not oily. This was either to be eaten like chips or added to the porridge.\n\n8. Prather Ranch Beef - Potato, Coastal Grasses, Monterey Cypress\n\nA sublimely tender piece of beef trimmed to perfection. No visible marbling, but holy crap it didn't need it. Perfectly tender & rich--everything that a piece of steak should be. Served with little mounds of creamy foam that were actually potatoes whipped with cream and olive oil. Delightful. The coastal grasses were also bitter leaves, a perfect compliment to the dish. A favorite.\n\n9. Grilled Cheese - Tomme D'ossau, Rye, Onion, Pickled Daikon\n\nTiny grilled cheese sandwiches on rye--bold & flavorful cheese. The daikon pickle was an interesting choice, and there was a little sauce that turned out to be onion marmalade. Yum.\n\n10. Fennel Sorbet - Ruby Grapefruit, Campari, Pomelo\n\nAs we'd had fennel ice cream at Chez Panisse, we assumed lack of creativity, but then this fennel sorbet kicked the trash out of Chez Panisse's--tiny & bold (fennel sorbet beats fennel ice cream), flanked by slightly saltly grapefruit ice (similar to the opening dish but a different citrus) & chunks of actual grapefruit, which I was expecting to be quite sour in contrast to the sorbet, but they had been doused in some kind of sweet perfumed liquor which tasted Arabian. Fabulous. Would made a nice perfume. Film of gelatinous substance draped on top. Bravo.\n\n11. Coffee Cake - Medjool Date, Raw Milk Ice, Lime\n\nNot terribly heavy, the coffee cake was drenched in a dark caramel sauce and adorned with wafers that tasted like Ritz cracker pie. The raw milk ice was the creamiest milk-flavored ice cream I've ever tasted. Undeniably delicious.\n\nAll in all:\n\nWe've been to many fine dining establishments over the years, all very good, but somehow none have topped our experiences at Gary Danko--we assumed Coi would be the same way. Starting with the beet dish, however, we knew it would be a close call. By the end, we had concluded that while Gary Danko's service & quantities are greater, the courses we'd had that evening at Coi were the best we'd ever tasted in our lives.

We've been to Alinea and a couple of European Michelin star places, and this is absolutely comparable.\n\nHowever, to be absolutely clear, this is a Michelin star restaurant - so this is not your normal fine dining restaurant! If you want to have great food and normal fine-dining prices - go somewhere else! Expect to pay ~200-300$pp. \n\nIt doesn't look special from the outside - but the kitchen is fantastic! The perfect place to celebrate a special event (in our case my graduation). \n\nWe got seated in the entrance room, which was a bit weird at first because every guest entered through this room. That's the only thing they could do better. Although I guess it's a bit difficult to rebuild the entrance entirely. \n\nHowever, because we had a rather late table after a while there were less and less people and it got very personal and quite. Some people said in their review that it was too quite for their taste. But I didn't mind it. I'd rather have a room for myself than a loud one.", "author": "Claudia R."}

I wish I had looked over the menu profile before agreeing to go. Although everything seems super fancy and does have the wow factor when it comes out, each and every course left something to be desired - that satisfactory \"mmm\", interesting, delicious, extraordinary \"I'd love another one of those.\" Instead, after I finished each course, I kept thinking, \"wow I can't wait to get to the really good stuff, the entrees, something more complex, something more umame, a hearty bite, SOMETHING!\" Alas, by the end of ALL the courses I was still waiting for more. I was yearning for some proteins, for the exquisite meats, and didn't want any more pea soup or turnips or any simple organic veggies processed into cool things that don't fill me up and fleetingly taste \"interesting. \n\nAt the time, I thought it wasn't terrible but I have since visited many other restaurants of similar or greater caliber and I can easily say that this was very disappointing.

Thank you in advance.\n\nMy lady friend and I came here for her birthday. We had dinner at The French Laundry the night before, and Chez Panisse the night before that, so there was a bit of expectation that Coi wrap up the week with happiness and full bellies and high fives. Coi delivered.\n\nWe had to wait about 30 minutes to sit at our table, which was OK by me but my lady felt that we deserved something for that. She was right. Along with the free champagne we were served while we waited in the lobby, we also got a few free white wine pairings to go along with our first few dishes. One of them was AMAZING and I had to get the name of it so I could find it at home. It was a white Rioja. I fell in love. I would tell you the name of it but then you might try to go find it, and rob me of these beauties. So, too bad. It's mine. All mine.\n\nThe decor is fairly spare and I guess modern. It was nice and comfortable. The bathroom has a pile of rocks in the sink. Alright.\n\nFrom the moment we walked in the door to the moment we walked out, the little hand passed the 12 at least three but not four times. We had a 9pm reservation and got back to the hotel - the St. Regis, just down the street - at 1:02am.

Fresh peas blended sublimely smooth poured over a tiny garden of leaves and flowers)\nArtichoke heart with fava leaves (another fave- tender, warm artichoke)\nPoached oyster, asparagus, wheatgrass (I don't usually love cooked oyster but it was great in this dish)\nSteamed tofu in mushroom dashi (umami heaven)\nDuck breast with wheat berries and radishes (the perfect taste, texture, and temperature medley)\nBlack sesame mochi bun with strawberry kumquat and shiso (seriously why has no one thought of this before.. although shiso leaf would make me want to eat anything)\nFrozen whipped rhubarb, olive oil,  spring herbs (the cilantro was mind blowing)\nCoconut cake with dark chocolate (sounds simple but it was actually a soft subtle cake encased in a solid chocolate orb)\nVanilla bean & yuzu salt water taffy (I'm gonna pretend we didn't have this- yuzu is another Favorite Thing Ever but it was melted to the paper)\n\nNotes: they have moved to a ticket system so you're paying up front, about a month out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-16", "description": "My husband and I had dinner at Coi to celebrate the launch of my second novel. I think I have to sell over 350 hardcovers just to recoup the cost of this meal--it was the most enormously expensive date we've ever been on, and I'm of two minds about it. I don't know that it was quite worth it, but there's no denying it was an excellent dinner.\n\nWe made reservations well in advance, and a reservationist called to confirm and ask about allergies and aversions. My husband Matt B. is a picky eater, and I had a five minute conversation in which I conveyed he could eat everything but the soup. I was surprised, given the Michelin swank, that we had to wait outside the dining room for ten minutes, and that our server had to ask about allergies and aversions, necessitating a repeat of that phone conversation. Anyway, these are minor things that wouldn't have bothered me if this weren't the most expensive meal of my life. Otherwise, the service was fantastic. Large staff:customer ratio, with people coming by to check on us with just the right frequency. The dining experience was top quality, the restaurant chic and beautiful, the atmosphere calm and upscale.\n\nWe had a full wine pairing with our dinner (which accounted for a big chunk of the check), and I thought this was worthwhile. Including the complimentary glass of champagne when we sat down, we had nine glasses of booze. Most were wines, but we had a Ferran Adria beer with one course. I can't honestly comment on each glass of wine, but we enjoyed them all, and they were thoughtfully chosen. The quantity was high enough that we had to be on our game to avoid a pile-up of wines.\n\nThe food was lovely, the menu fixed and several courses long. We started with the California bowl, a snack bowl of crispy thin brown rice chips garnished with herbs, with a creamy avocado puree for dipping. Two more amuse bouches followed. First was the sno-cone, a tart, refreshing granita of plum ice with black lime. Second, a smoked egg yolk with California sturgeon caviar,  cr\u00e8me fraiche, and chives. This was sensationally good, maybe the best bite of the night. The yolk was gorgeous, rich and gelatinous with a subtle smokey flavor that went well with the tang of the cr\u00e8me fraiche, the bursting salt of the caviar.\n\nThe first formal course of the night was the seared spot prawn, presented with cucumber and opal basil in a light watermelon broth touched with oil. The prawn was meaty and sweet, perfect with the cool cucumber and watermelon. A great end-of-summer dish. The cherry tomatoes came next, over a pur\u00e9e of grilled zucchini and wheatgrass, with a gorgeous sprinkle of miniature herbs and flowers on top. This was a real showcase of careful cooking, with each tiny tomato brought to just the right firmness. The chilled, spiced eggplant soup came next, along with a substitution of carrots roasted in coffee bean for Matt. The soup was creamy and wonderfully seasoned, poured over pole beans, charred okra, fermented chile, and flowering cilantro. The carrots were conceptually similar to the tomatoes, with small segments of roasted carrots, flavored with coffee bean, mandarin, and Roman mint. At some point around here, we got bread service. Bread with sunflower and millet seeds, served with good butter.\n\nThe second act of the meal was made up of three dishes that could pass, if tripled in size, as hearty entrees. The wild king salmon was one of the best dishes of the night, a perfect piece of silken salmon, gently cooked, sashimi-bright. It came in a salty, concentrated crayfish bordelaise, sprinkled with tarragon and fennel pollen. The steamed chanterelle-potato dumpling was an innovative dish. I expected something like gnocchi, but the potato offered a pleasant bite that suggested it hadn't been reduced to mash. It was layered with delicate chanterelle, with brown butter, lovage, and shells of new onion on the side. The last savory dish was the Emigh Ranch lamb, a phenomenal lamb chop, juicy and flavorful, cooked to a buttery tee. It was served with chard leaves and stems touched with garum and rosemary, with a puddle of jus as a sauce.\n\nDessert was its own show, starting with a little bun of coconut mochi wrapped around kiwi and shiso. Clean, light flavors and great texture in that mochi bun. Next came a small bowl of ha'ogen melon, tiny balls of it with a quenelle of holy basil sorbet, all in a shallow pool of olive oil. I could've eaten several bowls of this. The most substantial dessert was a round peach tart in a dense pastry crust, with caramelized honey, candied ginger, and a layer of yogurt on top. It was sweet, tangy, and just right. The meal ended with a final, memorable treat: a pair of frozen dark chocolate-yuzu marshmallows, tart and bittersweet.\n\nIn short, not much to complain about. We had a grand, delicious meal. That said, it wasn't my best this year, and I wouldn't go back or even necessarily recommend it for the money. Still, no regrets.

I love being able to SEE my food.\n- Excellent service. We asked for the background on our courses & got great stories on where the ingredients came from & how they were cooked (there's so much science & thought behind every step). I was cold & my server kept bringing me glasses of hot water (perfectly mixed w/ cold water to come out to a nice lukewarm).\n- Each course was SO well presented - like a piece of art. \n- Very accommodating w/ dietary limitations.\n- 10 of 11 dishes were hits. The dishes are very buttery & rich. Delicious, but filling. Faves: Clam, Pasture, Crab Melt, Unrefined Sugar. \n\nCONS:\n- Way too overpriced. Only one course had meat. Only affordable b/c my friend charged part of the meal for her business trip ($180pp bill turned into an affordable $60).\n- Earth & Sea was just not worth any amount of money. It tasted like miso soup w/ some fancy ingredients that didn't add to the flavor. \n\nTHE FOOD:\n* Frozen Mandarin Sour (angostura bitters, kumquat, satsuma ice) - Very interesting! The ice salty was (& the salt comes from a riverbed in Australia!) & cold, paired w/ slightly bitter/tart & chewy kumquat was a really great way to start off the meal. \n\n* Clam (geoduck & manila, bull kelp, meyer lemon, wild fennel) - If you love seafood, you will love this (otherwise - seafood overkill). The geoduck clam had a really interesting chewy texture &it was interwoven w/ kelp & another type of clam manipulated to look like kelp. Sprinkled w/ fennel - perfect.   \n\n* Pasture (beets roasted in hay, fresh cheese, wild sprouts & flowers) - An unexpectedly sweet dish, thoroughly enjoyed! The beets added just enough flavor so the sweetness of the goat cheese wasn't overpowering. There was a hint of smoky flavor from the hay. The wild sprouts/flowers had a hint of bitterness like an onion bulb!\n\n* Crab Melt, California Style (staffan's lardo, wheatgrass) - Very well done, rich, interesting use of textures/ flavors. I'm not usually impressed by crab appetizers but this really won me over. The lardo made it very rich & filling & was chewy, there was a crunchy layer underneath. The wheatgrass puree tasted funny by itself (bitterish) but went great w/ everything else.\n\n* Spring Allium Soup (soyoung's etude, smoke, almond) - Amazing. Rich. Delicious. Onion bulbs & scallions added that slight bitterness, crunch, & fresh flavor. It countered the saltiness of the soup perfectly. Almonds came in huge chunks though - sliced smaller would be better. \n\n* Earth & Sea (steamed tofu mousseline, mushroom dashi, yuba, fresh seaweed) - Major disappointment. Like miso soup, or any other generic Asian broth, except they added some yuba (which they went to great lengths to describe, but it's just tofu skin which my family cooks at home all the time). \n\n* Savory Wild Mushroom Porridge (crisp root vegetables, cress, sherry) - Another incredibly rich but wonderful dish! I usually don't like mushroom to be the main ingredient in any dish as it's got such a dominating flavor but they really make it work here. Maybe the porridge absorbs some of it. This was just so savory, thick, & full of flavor. The chips added some texture to your liking, & actually made the porridge lighter. They were great to eat on their own too.\n\n* Prather Ranch Beef (potato, coastal grasses, monterey cypress) - Tenderloin beef - so incredibly tender & soft! The potato puree just tasted odd. The sauce & the greens went well w/ the beef though. My boyfriend had chicken as a replacement - I found it a tiny bit dry & the sauce overly salted (it just didn't go as well w/ chicken as w/ beef) but he really enjoyed the texture, had no complaints.\n\n* Carrots Cooked on Coffee Bean (creme fraiche, green olive oil, cilantro) - Very interesting! I would've preferred the whole baby carrots sliced as their flavor overpowered a bit. If you got a bite w/ plenty of coffee bean & sweet granola, you hit the jackpot. Creme fraiche was great. But most bites were mostly carrot.\n\n* Fennel Sorbet (ruby grapefruit, campari, pomelo) - An amazing light dessert. Bitter grapefruit, cold sorbet, tart pomelo = perfect combination.  \n\n* Unrefined Sugar (moscavado cake, medjool date, raw milk ice, lime) - I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THE DATE CAKE!! It was spongy, moist, delicious, and warm. The raw milk ice was amazing, smooth, & was basically a cold burst of the best milk I've ever had. The granola-ish sweet sprinkles added texture. Just the crackers were a little TOO sweet - I had a bunch leftover at the end because too much tended the ruin the flavors of everything else.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

Having gone and enjoyed our experience a few years ago, we were excited to return. All in all, it was a fair experience. The food was delicious, our server was pleasant, and the service was on point...except for the beverage service. \n\nWe started with two glasses of brut rose...that is how we stated our order (we were \"starting with\"), and our server replied that it was a great choice for a start. We were planning to do more wines by the glass throughout the meal, but after our initial drink, we were not asked again as to whether we wanted anything more. Not by the sommeliers roaming the floor nor by our server. We have dined at many Michelin-starred establishments all over the world and thought this was very strange and unexpected. Finally my husband asked for a wine list, which was brought promptly, but then it was quite awhile longer (after he had closed and set aside the wine list) before anyone came to see what we wanted to order. \n\nIt puzzled us as other tables all around us were enjoying their attentive wine service. What initially struck us as strange and perhaps a fluke became upsetting about half way through our meal. If we were at the neighborhood wine bar and service was lacking, we would have just flagged down someone and called it a day. With Coi's reputation, however, at these prices and compared to other fine dining experiences, we expected more. We thoroughly enjoyed the food but the wine service left much to be desired. We sincerely hope that this unfortunate incident was accidental and preventable in the future for other patrons.\n\np.s.

I didn't mind since the table was huge and made speaking to my fianc\u00e9 difficult anyways, so we moved; our waiter promptly brought out two glasses of bubbly on the house as a token of thanks. Great gesture. \n\nMajority of the courses served were seafood/veggie dishes, with the main being a duck course. I loved almost all of them, particularly since I'm a bigger seafood fan than meat; everything was delicately flavoured so that the natural flavours of the fresh ingredients were really drawn out and not drowned by seasoning, presentation was sophisticated, and the timing of courses were good as well. My fianc\u00e9 is more of a meat lover, but he really enjoyed his entire meal as well.\n\nService was attentive but not overbearing, as is to be expected from a Michelin star restaurant. \n\nThe reason I'm shaving off one star was due to one course that had yuba and steamed tofu in a mushroom broth - again, presentation and flavour was on point, but after a few bites I noticed there was what seemed to be small residues of sand still in the broth....nothing that was visible when you looked at it, but you could feel the grains in your mouth. Maybe they used clams to season the broth, and they didn't purge all of the sand from the clams, and some small grains ended up in the broth... It wasn't a complete deal breaker since everything else was great, and if they were a more casual restaurant I may have not minded as much, but I was surprised that a restaurant of their caliber would make a mistake like that. \n\nGiven how great everything else was, I'd be willing to give them another try, but only after trying other comparable restaurants in the area.", "author": "Anna H."}

We were very excited as we were treating out of town guest and looking forward to the evening. Not disappointed from the very start. My wife was thrilled because they have a kitchen viewing window and she was giddy as she watched the staff working on their culinary magic, using tweezers to complete their masterful creations.\n\nAfter four, or maybe five servings, the lights went out! The diners and staff were all taken surprised but didn't think much about it. The staff delivered extra candles to each table and they continued to perform as expected.\n\nTurns out that the whole block, if not more, was without power. A PG&E issue that was out of Coi's control. We took it in stride, as we usually do, and just enjoyed the company and food. The General Manager came to our table and explained the situation and promised that Coi would do their best to continue as best they could, but they were told that it might be until 10:00 pm before power could be restored, which was almost 2 1/2 hours!\n\nWe had already finished our bottle of Chardonnay and were looking forward to the Phillip Togni Cab when we were told that Coi could not continue to serve because of reasons relating to food preparation safety. They asked, twice, if they could assist us with making alternative dinner plans. Rather than burden them, I declined and I used Open Table to make a reservation somewhere else.\n\nOur server was at our table yet again and asked us if she could pour a complimentary glass of wine.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-05-27", "description": "As one of the few Two Michelin Star restaurants in San Francisco, Coi (pronounced \"Kwah\" as I found out during my meal) exhibits an amazing dichotomy of reviews.  The astronomical tasting menu prices, mandatory 18% gratuity, and marathon dining session (4+ hours) polarizes diners as much as their creative and beautifully presented food and impeccable service.  \n\nFor myself, as a fan of savory \"bang for your buck\" food and more substance and portion size over style and presentation, I wasn't sure what I'd think of the school of molecular gastronomy that Coi considers itself a member.\n\nIn fact, I'll be honest, I was largely expecting to be disappointed and, even worse, worried I'd leave hungry.  But dining is such a subjective experience and I would never call myself closed minded with respect to food, so I was game to experience and share a meal over great conversation and with a loved one and a friend, knowing the whole time I'd pay dearly with the wallet -- That's why they call these \"special occasion\" restaurants or \"once in a lifetime dining experiences.\" \n\nLocated on the edge of North Beach, Coi is a hidden and smaller venue restaurant than I would have expected.  $8 valet parking is offered in the area but we were able to find convenient street parking.  \n\nThe interior is dimly lit and divided into a more casual lounge area that reminds one of a trendy bar as well as a second room that comprises the main dining room.  The tasting menu is offered at both locations, but I've been told the attraction of the lounge is that they offer a more affordable, yet equally delicious, casual menu as well.  \n\nThe tasting menu ($165/person) is offered in both a standard and vegetarian version and consists of 11-12 courses.  As one would expect with the number of courses, portion size is small, but it's definitely enough to enjoy and savor the dish.\n\nAs it is Spring, the theme of the menu revolved around vegetables and only a handful of items were meat or seafood based.  As a self-confessed meat-a-holic, my worries about leaving hungry reared their ugly head once again but I whispered to myself to be open minded even as I joked with the table about eating McDonald's or won ton noodles after dinner.\n\nWith the meal and beverages ordered, our dining experience began.  To be honest, I lost count after five or so dishes and by the end of the meal was sure that we had way more than eleven or twelve dishes.  Service was truly impeccable.  They present all dishes at once, remove silverware with each course, and are never obtrusive.  They also explain each dish (something that I've found lacking at some restaurants) and were always friendly and quick to refill water.  For me, it  was a NYC caliber service experience.  \n\nThe food comes out at a reasonable pace and I would say I never felt like there were long periods of time without food.  That being said, serving that many courses does take time and it's no surprise that the dinner service was way over four hours.  Given how few seatings they have, perhaps it's not surprising they charge as much for their tasting menu as they do (I'm not saying I like the prices, just postulating) and I feel sorry for the couple that started their meal at 10:30.  Key: bring great conversation.\n\nOf course, that leads me to the star of the meal, which is clearly the food.  I'm not a fan of gimmicky food (foams, essential oils placed on your wrist) and while there was some of that, it was very minimal.  The overriding thing for me when I describe the food is that everything is gorgeously presented, but much more importantly for me, is that all of it tasted delicious, new, and varied.  Even with the small portion sizes, the intense flavors that intermingled in many of the dishes between sweet, salty, and sour all enhanced the item being presented.  Standouts for me include the cold pea soup (and I hate cold soup) simply because it tasted so flavorful and all the peas tasted fresher than any peas I've ever had and definitely the duck prepared two ways.  The first duck was cold but perfectly cooked and incredibly tasty.  The second was seared and almost Asian style with a tiny beautiful piece of bok choy with a wonderful slightly fatty duck breast.  \n\nThere were some misses as well, but mainly due to flavor combinations of sour that I didn't particularly like.  The slightly overcooked abalone (no one prepares abalone better than Chinese) and sour week old cheese dessert both come to mind.  Even with the misses, it was often food that I've never had and I still finished everything.  \n\nOverall, I left Coi both happy and full.  It was a truly novel dining experience like none I've had recently and everything tasted really good, irrespective of how prettily it was plated.  Were there minuses?  Yes, but given all the polarizing reviews, they were much less than I expected and, with perhaps muted expectations, I was glad to have checked Coi off my dining list.\n\nCoi accepts all credit cards including Amex.", "author": "Randy F."}

This is not a place I would go every month, or even every year, but more like once a decade. The price alone is prohibitive, and the food itself isn't something I'll start craving, say, tomorrow night. \n\nNow that's out of the way, I can say that I had an amazing time at Coi. The service was incredible, I've never experienced anything like it. We had at least 5 servers waiting on us throughout the meal. They were classy, polite and attentive, but not in a way that made me feel awkward (sometimes too much service makes me uncomfortable!) My boyfriend and I had just gotten engaged that morning, and they gave us each a glass of champagne on the house in honor of the occasion, which was very sweet! And the champagne was probably the nicest I've ever had...\n\nThe meal itself is pre-fixe and runs upwards of $200/person. Before we started they asked us if we had any dietary restrictions or aversions. There was once course with mushrooms which I absolutely abhor and they said no problem, we have something else for you. That was a great sign as sometimes I think the super nice restaurants can get a bit snobby and refuse any substitutions. The meal consisted of 14 courses - that's not an exaggeration, I counted. Each course is quite small, but when you add it all up, I left the restaurant feeling full and satisfied. I honestly don't know what my favorite was, but a few highlights were the smoked egg yolk, the salmon, the shrimp, and the eggplant soup. There was some sort of berry concoction for dessert which was also divine. We brought our own bottle of wine (the corkage is $40 I believe) so I can't speak to their wine menu (or how expensive it is). Overall I would say their menu has a vegetable focus, which was great for me, because even though I'm not a vegetarian I don't eat much meat. That means pre-fixe menus can cause me some trouble. But at Coi, there was only one meat course out of the 14 and it was lamb. I tried a bite and it wasn't for me, but that's not because I think they didn't do it well, I just really don't like lamb regardless.\n\nThis was my first michelin star restaurant and I loved it! After tax and tip we paid around $600 for the two of us, so again, not something to do every week.

I left disappointed and wanting more...which is, in a way, a good thing in a sense (but it also means I left hungry).\n\nI have eaten many stars, in several locales around the globe. I have eaten many of the stars in the SF/Bay area. The food at Coi absolutely competed with any of them...but there was just something missing in the experience. Portions were remarkably small, and though delicious and beautiful, it was almost absurd how small some of the courses were. Now, if this were a true 12+ course menu, they would have been spot on for size. But, for a relatively short tasting menu and with such a high price tag, I would have expected more courses for the price, and they threw in less of the 'extra' courses and freebies I often associate with this type of tasting menu.\n\nWine pairing was good, they brought out some cool and funky wines. Maybe throwing in a real show stopper or two would be nice, but, it was a fine pairing.\n\nService was fine, I have had better, but no real complaints. Though I do think the service level was not fully up t par with the two and three star places I have eaten at.\n\nSo, unfortunately, though I love DP's food and will still frequent his other restaurants in the bay area, I am sorry to say it's very unlikely that I will return to Coi.

We were very excited to come here but walked away more disappointed than I could have imagined. The bad experience began as we entered the restaurant. You enter into a small room with a bench and a view of 2 of tables in the restaurant. It forces you to venture into the restaurant to find someone if nobody is there waiting for you, as was the case for us. We waited for more than 5 minutes, wondering if we were in the wrong entrance. Then we walked outside to see if there was indeed another entrance but couldn't find one. Finally we returned to the first entrance and waited a few more minutes before one of the wait staff was escorting out other patrons and noticed us. Strike 1. And for a 2 Michelin star restaurant Strike 2 as well. We were offered a welcome glass of champagne. A nice touch, until we received our menus and saw that we were just given a glass of champagne we hadn't asked for which we would now be charged $25 / glass. Strike 3. The first small course was great, so our spirits lifted slightly. The next few courses were too fishy, and all were too small. We ordered one bottle of wine with our food and left the restaurant feeling hungry and tipsy. Strike 4. Obviously the bill was huge, almost $1,000. I won't count that against them since I knew about it going in, but leaving a $1,000 dinner feeling hungry is completely unacceptable. Had we not booked through Open Table and been required to guarantee payment of the tasting menu we would have simply left the restaurant a multiple points.

At this price, Coi isnt catering to people like me.\nMy guess is their clientele are uber rich folks who need a reason to spend atrocious amounts of money on tapas.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-05-19", "description": "I've been to two restaurants that cost more than $800 (with parings) for two people, Coi and Benu. Maybe it's not fair to compare, but the differences were so extreme, and Coi was so consummately sub-par by comparison, that it was striking.  Coi was a total waste of money, I very much regret eating there and would never recommend it to anyone.  \n\nHere's the deal: if you're going to charge me an exorbitant price for dinner, the food needs to be truly next level.  At Benu, each of the ~20 courses you receive is like a work of art, pushing your expectations and taste buds far beyond what you're used to.  Coi, on the other hand, is often very pedestrian, and while the food is done well, it's generally in line with something you've seen before.  I believe they served us only eight (tiny) courses at Coi, and not one of them was particularly memorable. \n\nNor was any of them particularly filling, and we left the restaurant anything but satiated.  Particularly irritating was the treatment we received as pescatarians.  At Benu, they swapped out meat courses with fish courses, for the most part.  At Coi, the \"entree\" for the night (that is, the one dish that was bigger than a few bites) was duck, but the replacement they brought us was CAULIFLOWER.  Literally, a few pieces of cooked cauliflower with some non-descript, mostly flavorless sauce.  I imagine the other diners were satisfied with the duck breast they received, but how can anyone with a straight face replace a high-end piece of duck with  steamed cauliflower?  It was offensive--$800 for a meal, and you're giving me straight-up cauliflower for my entree?  A side-dish?! That was cooked in such a common and everyday fashion that I could have gotten it at a steakhouse by the mall?  My god, it was lame.\n\nOur waiter was attentive enough, but was also very cocky and came off like a wannabe Jersey wiseguy.  Whereas at Benu the sommelier was the guide to our meal, and kept our glasses topped-off (almost to a fault), the sommelier at Coi could barely be bothered with us (we only purchased the $100 \"normal\" wine parings, and not one of the more fancy and expensive offerings), and his pours were anemic by comparison.  Frankly, by the end of the meal I wanted to slap the guy, because every time he came to the table he seem to be more smug and dismissive.  My wife tried to ask questions; it was like he was being forced to talk to a commoner.\n\nCoi is truly an \"emperor has no clothes\" situation.  They have the pedigree, and they're certainly charging the big-ticket prices required of a Michelin star, but in this city of fantastic, inventive and satisfying high end restaurants, it absolutely did not deliver the goods.  I left with a bad taste in my mouth, not just because of the haughty staff, but also because the food simply wasn't that good.  Most definitely isn't worth $800--I'm still pissed at myself for paying it.  Avoid.", "author": "Cody V."}

Patrons are not super dressy, but I would still recommend wearing something fashionable and less grocery shopping. \n\nAll wait staff are nice and knowledgeable. We have our own preference for wine, so we opted out of the wine pairing. They can do half wine pairings. I thought that was very reasonable and cool considering not everyone likes to drink 8 different wines in one night or finish 8 full glass for that matter. Our server was able to recommend a wine close to the one we usually get and yet still something different we can try out. \n\nEach dish was as expected, beautifully designed and tasted delicious. I am not a lamb person. Personal preference - It taste way too gamey and mask the flavors. However, miraculously they were able to make it medium rare, bone in and still very good. There was a slight hint of gamey-ness that I can tell it's lamb, but not so overwhelming that I can't eat it. There was one mushroom dish that tasted so good I almost wanted to lick the bowl. \n\nSo yes, please do try this place out if you are looking to spoil someone, treat yourself to something good.

The food alone is 3.5- 4 stars.The food is fresh and the rooftop garden is great but the service is definitely lacking...\n\n1. There was a fruit fly hovering around our table. Wow. At a 2 Michelin star restaurant??!\n\n2. Service and no greeting. The restaurant is nice, but almost none personable staff, even thought they were knowledgeable about the dish. I felt uncomfortable from the beginning. Should have been a sign...\n\n3. My boyfriend told me that he had called to remind them that we were celebrating a birthday. I never received a birthday dessert, Happy Birthday, or something special at the end of the meal :(\n\nThe experience: I have been fortunate enough to go to other fine dining restaurants in the city with at least 1 Michelin star, so I don't quite understand why this place has 2 stars. My boyfriend surprised me for my birthday, and I was super excited, as this has been on my list.\n\nWhen we first walked in, we were confused if we went in the entrance or the back way because no one greeted us and it was dark. We continued to walk through the dining room confused, and I even asked, \"Was that the entrance?\" The gentleman then greeted us as we stood in the dining room. It was a bit awkward. Our table wasn't ready since we got there a bit early, so he said it would be a minute. There we stood in the dining room. Again, awkward. So, my boyfriend and I made our way to the dark entrance to wait. We sat down, still confused. It took awhile for us to receive our menus. As the waitress explained the menu, another waitress brought out the grain chips and dip. We didn't know what it was because as our waitress was talking about the menu, the dish was placed on the table. So we waited until she came back to ask. Again, we were confused.\n\nAs the meal progressed we had some great dishes, and not so exciting dishes. The salmon was my favorite dish, the chicken was done VERY well, and the desserts were great. The waitress asked us if we wanted a taxi cab, and we said yes. As she brought our coats, thanked us for dining, and walked us to the exit, we asked if the taxi was there already, since we didn't want to wait outside in the cold. She said that she would check, and went outside. If we didn't ask, we probably would have been left alone. \n\nFor a place rated so highly and with a $$$$ price tag, I expected it to be nearly flawless. The small details are important, and unfortunately Coi doesn't have it down. I have had exceptional service at 1-starred places so for a 2 Michelin-star rated establishment, I was disappointed.\n\nSide Note: Just last month, we celebrated my boyfriends' birthday at Keiko a Nob Hill. The service was outstanding. We were greeted by the owners, the host made conversation with us, such as \"You two look nice, what are we celebrating tonight?\", and they brought out the birthday dessert for my boyfriend, that I called in advance about.\n\nCoi: My advice to you is to see what your fellow restaurant counterparts are doing and learn from them.", "author": "Nadia M."}

The pacing was fast and they were quick to clear plates (even though I was dining alone).\n\nWine: The Ridge wines were nice, and their rep (Christina Donley) was willing to have a frank and open discussion about them. Unfortunately, the flagship wine of the evening, a 1999 Monte Bello, felt short of my expectations and was in fact a bit closed.\n\nOverall: This was a pleasant dinner and I'm glad I got the chance to dine at Coi.

Like many of the 1 star reviews explain, we too walked in and there was nobody there. We were about to leave when the hostess decided to grace us with her presence. This and the fact that it's next to a strip club should have been a sign to leave but no such luck. We stayed curious and that was our downfall.\n\nThe dishes were salty, as many many reviewers have stated, and laughable. The waiter staff were sad and seemed to have a telemarketer stance as in we know we are doing you wrong but it's a job we have. Plate after plate of unfinished food was taken off our table. As a chef you always look at the plates coming back so I mean they got direct feedback. One dish was basically cut up beats on ice as I recall, again laughable...an expensive joke, right? At one point I looked up at this tiny sort of screened window that is up high and goes into the kitchen and thought...am I being punk'd nad that's a camera? I should go into more detail but suffice to say yes it was salty, yes the portions were small and yes we did not finish a lot of the dishes. The one high note was literally a bowl of chips we were served early in the meal.\n\nThese are the Questions that haunt me:\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n\n1) How in the world can this place receive 2 TWO Michelin stars? wow crazy\n\n   I mean Danko, Quince, SPQR, Sons & Daughters all have only 1 ONE star! Do you really in your wildest dreams think Coi deserves the same rating as Atelier Crenn or Benu? no of course not\n\n2) An 18% service charge is included?\n\n  I can see why, otherwise people would never tip that much. I ordered an extremely expensive bottle of wine that was already marked up 800% and you want me to pay 18% on top of that? I mean I picked it out myself because the sommelier wasn't available...I can only assume it was he who cooked our meal then.\n\nThis place should be re-named Le Sham. People are being paid off...everywhere is my best guess.\n\nI sincerely hope someone reads all the 1-star reviews here and understands:\n\n1) I go to a lot of nice restaurants\n2) I am a decent cook in my own right.\n3) I worked in the industry of fine dining after college for 7 years\n4) I know what good food is, what's fair and what's poorly attempted food\n\nyelper, I am here to tell you, stay away.\n\nYou have been warned.", "author": "Stephen S."}

First time it was under Daniel Patterson`s helm and while it was not my favorite by far I was impressed by creativity, taste and menu progression. Current reincarnation of Coi left me cold and regretful over wasted money. Dinner for two with one drink and one tea pairing was over $700 and the tea pairing was the only memorable part. Food was poorly balanced and monotonous with lack of any progression or buildup. They bill themselves as seafood restaurant but it felt like they were trying to push seafood on little spoiled brats who hate seafood. In my view, the focus at Coi is elaborate presentation and high profit at the expense of taste and quality. Some comments on 9-course tasting menu:\nRadish Tartelette - beautiful but tiny and rather boring thing, can work as amuse bouche but rather unworthy as a dish;\nGeoduck Clam - something tiny, looks cute but no taste except salt; I am trying to remember more but I can't\nOcean Trout - little cubes of lightly cured trout were rather good and tasted fresh;\nDungeness Crab - salty and reminded me of fake crab meat from some plastic package;\nLittle boring bread with elaborately constructed butter, a bit salty and not very fresh tasting\nThis first 4 courses are all cold, on salty side with unrefined muddy taste and no bright notes of acidity. One maybe ok but 4 in succession feel repetitive and boring.\nTurbot - I liked this one, good piece of fish cooked well \nCod - the most awful dish of the dinner for me. Poor cod was shaped into some kind of sausage like form and put on top of some green broth with minty taste both cloyingly sweet and salty. Maybe the chef was trying to make me forget that I am eating fish?\nCornish Hen - probably my favorite dish of the evening (and I came for seafood), good plump juicy chicken done well with some prawns\nDessert - 2 courses of something tediously boring with some white fat, sugar and a little fruit.\nThe real high of the evening for me was tea pairing. I have to compliment them for this rather unusual, creative and well executed attempt. High quality oolong teas mostly from Taiwan served both cold and hot did their best to break monotonous succession of uninspiring dishes.

At I was a bit sceptical about the location (Especially at $135 a head). In fact we were seated in a private room and all of us joked that in its past life it was probably the \"champagne room.\" \n\nBut in all seriousness although the location is kind of out there the inside is very nice (look on the bright side it is easier to find parking). \n\nWe had a group of 6 and were seated in this intimate dim lit room in the back. Our server was excellent and our sommelier was full of great suggestions. \n\nFOOD--- \nThe great thing about a set menu is that you don't have to make any decisions. Just sit back eat and enjoy the organic local goodness. \n\nEach of the 11 courses is served at the same time by what we called the \"gourmet mafia\" aka servers wearing dark suits placing food on the table in almost perfect unisen. \n\nFor the sake of time I am going to highlight my favorite and not so favorite things. Everything else was just good. \n\nFavorites: \nThe Bread: They are like tiny roles of yummyness. Be careful on the intake of these great things, just remember 11 courses and bread is not one of them. \n\nULTIMATE HIGHLIGHT: The Beet and Goat Cheese Tart (broken, inverted). Me and my Man loved it so much we ordered a couple extras to share before dessert (thank you Mr. Server for breaking the NO a la carte rule to satisfy the table!). \n\nOysters Rockafellar, California Style: Mmmm... no seriously...mmm... \n\nDungeness Crab Soup: great! \n\nChicken/Egg: just plain amazing! \n\n\nNOT so Favorite: \n\nWinter Pastrol: Boo! Tasted to earthy even for me. \n\nWater Glasses: They are just too tiny. \n\nDECOR--- \nI was in love with the great art on the walls. As I had been guessing all night the art was fruit, well X-Rays of fruit. The concept is that each fruit or veggie simulates a part of the human body (ex: pomegranate brain). Before we left I went into the main dining room to check out all of the art. Unlike our room which was dim and intimate the main dining room was bright and airy yet super zen. \n\nThe Bathrooms: \nI loved them! The individual bathrooms had sinks filled with beautiful rocks. And the mirrors are straight cosmetic counter status (you know the kind that are perfectly lit to make you look amazing). When our waiter saw me anxiously waiting outside the bathroom labeled \"W\" he informed me that the one next to it labeled \"M\" was exactly the same. Which I think is totally funny because M and W are the same flipped upside down and had I been a bit more tipsy my dyslexia would have kicked in and they would have looked the same to me. :)", "author": "Caro S."}

All most every dish just gave me an orgasm!\n\nKeep in mind I only had the lounge experience but the last time i heard they converted it to extend the dining area. The lounge menu was VERY reasonably priced.\n\nVenue: Small but sophisticated restaurant. Dim lighting. Modern decore. Probably need reservations.\n\nService: Very attentive servers. Made sure we were happy.\n\nFood: \n- Crab Melt (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=HR3Szyrtlx-t9lXjF4eP8A) - Dungeness crab placed on a thin and crispy piece of toast with some wheatgrass and pea shoots. crab tasted tender and creamy. \n\n- Crab Soup (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=D4lzE8GDTPDYvbP3Hm6a9g) - This tasted very similar to the crab melt but in soup form without the toast. Creamy dungeness crab soup with veggies.\n\n- Farm Egg (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=1vWqLF8W1wTZpem3UXVt0Q) - The egg was very creamy which i loved! great dish.\n\n- Pature Beet Salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=GvEP1IfmwTquLhTl4xecyg) - This one was surprisingly really good! Hay roasted beets with cheese. slightly sweet and slightly savory. It was perfect!\n\n- Grilled Cheese Sandwich (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=XmVGDwUEukj46mR_aFT9Hg) - Perfectly crispy bread with perfectly melted cheese in between. probably one of the best grill cheese you can get.\n\n- Savory Chanterelle Porridge (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=v_Olc92V7uMAYRxCceiJaA) - This was an OMG my life is complete kind of dish. The rice was tender yet soft. Kind of reminded me of risotto. With great flavor of chanterelles topped with soft form and cripy veggie root.\n\n- Prather Ranch Beef (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=GNPKg-i9XHd0ig_RZSmm4w) - A tender tenderloin with puree potatoes. mmmm...\n\n- Pork Belly (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=aPsMsQyPoUfN6uDfqq7VHg) - Juicy and fatty pork belly did not disappoint me. Was very good.\n\n- Poached Chicken (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=oMLorL287EuuMz20AZd8oQ) - Who would have thought a poached chicken can be soooo flavorful, sooo tender and sooooo juicy. I LOVED this dish. its also crusted with some kind of crispy flakes. I had a huge orgasm eating this one.\n\n- Dessert - I tried all the dessert on the menu but the one that stands out the most was the Bread & chocolate (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=IOdEPKSkjlE5wwksAQxsTQ). This one had a lot of different texture on one plate. you got the soft chocolaty moose, the chewy yet cripsy caramelized brioche, brioche ice cream and pistachio pudding. Rocked my taste buds!\n\nPrice: VERY reasonable. Ended up paying around 30 bucks per person.\n\nOverall: Very good and unique dishes! I would come back anytime to try the full dinner experience.

I know it's a little obnoxious, but since Coi's menu changes in a regular basis, I think it's prudent to show what we had for each course:\n\nmandarin sour (mandarin ice, frozen meringues, angostura bitters) \noysters (wild greens, asian pear, finger lime) \ninverted beet and goat cheese tart (dill and walnut pesto, rye tuille) \ndungeness crab (sheep sorrel, chickweed, butter crab broth) \nbrassicas and new olive oil (dandelion, charred onion broth) \nsalsify (black trumpet mushrooms, lichen vinaigrette) \nmonterey bay abalone (heirloom chicories, shellfish sauce) \nlamb (raw almond and wheatgrass, grains, seeds) \n'partita' (sunchoke, quince, sunflower seeds) \noro blanco (ginger ice cream, epizote) \nchocolate (chicory, olive oil, malted milk foam)\n\nIt should be noted that I have a HUGE fear for the unfamiliar, and am very selective in terms of what I want to try.  I'm not a huge seafood fan, so the fact that oysters, abalone, and crab showed up in the menu was mildly concerning.  After trying all three dishes (and paired with AMAZING wine!!!), I loved each one!  I always like to think that any place that can get me to like items that I'm largely adverse to trying deserves at least 4 stars.  My favorite dish of the evening was the brassicas and new olive oil.  I could have eaten an entire plate full of these wonderful little broccolis.  Like myself, my boyfriend isn't a fan of broccoli, but absolutely LOVED this dish.  His favorite dish was the salsify.  The dessert was fantastic, but I had gotten full with everything else it was hard to appreciate the wonderful work of chocolate/olive oil/malted milk foam.  I highly recommend getting the dinner and the wine pairings if you ever make it out there.  My boyfriend and I were debating as to whether we should just get one bottle for the whole evening, but after being exposed with the wonderful selection Coi had for dinner, I think we both agreed that it was the best decision.  \n\nThe decor was wonderful, and the service we received from Coi puts it above and beyond. Our waitress was incredibly friendly, and each dish was explained to us thoroughly with the specific details, and answered the questions we had about certain ingredients.  It was an absolute treat to be able to eat at Coi, so a big thank you and I love you to my boyfriend, and to Coi for making it the best Valentine's dinner I've ever experienced :)", "author": "Lisa I."}

Trainwreck from beginning to end. \n\nThis was a wine pairing dinner with wines from Failla. Pretty nice winery. \n\n1. beats - tasty beats. hard to screw that up. 4/5. \n\n2. Grains soup. nothing special. 3/5\n\n3. morels, kale, and toast topped w/ mussels and chorizo. best dish of the night, but just painfully small portion. 4/5\n\n4. peppered beef shortrib and a baked carrot. \n\nOk this is the course that really frustrated me. This is supposed to be the climax of the night. Instead what we get is a dried piece of beef and a carrot. really. They were trying to make it sound special by saying the carrot was done in the spirit of a \"baked potato\". \nYou baked a carrot and sliced it in half. This is Denny's level food at this point. C'mon. 0/5 stars\n\n5. dessert course w/ whipped coconunt and olive oil. Lets just say no one at the table liked it. 1/5 stars. \n\nWorst part about the meal was also the lack of discussion on the wines by the servers. They didn't even mention what wines were being served and why was it being served. We had to prompt them to inform us on details. Pairings were overall haphazard. \n\nTotal damage, $200.

Someone reading this 2 months from now I'm sure will have a completely different menu.\n\nYes, most of these restaurants have beautiful presentation and yes, rare / exquisite ingredients.  But the two things I do look for in a fine dining experience is the thoughtful play of textures (more of a focus in Asian cuisine) and salt levels.  I tend to share my wine pairings (being the DD) so that's why these two are important.  The textures were always present and in balance.  The salt levels were spot on, except for 1 dish, which was the main lamb course.  The lamb itself was perfectly prepared but the accompanying sauce was I believe (and again 1 man's opinion) a little over the top.  Enough for each of the party members to state the same thing.  But a slightly salty sauce never hurt anyone, just use less of it per bite.\n\nWent the Sat of Thanksgiving weekend.  Was placed in the private dining room (which was good, since we tend to get pretty loud at our dinners).

The slice of lamb was impeccable--very rare but with perfect texture, no stringiness or annoying sinews.  And whipped coconut dessert was better than any ice cream I'd ever had.\n\nBut other than that, the rest of the meal was not very memorable.  The abalone dish was good, but I've had better at Chinese restaurants for much less.  The blueberry dessert was odd.

We arrived early and our host, who was friendly and accommodating, seated us in the lounge while our table was being prepared.  We took this opportunity to look over the impressive space before we were seated.  We noticed that the restaurant was separated into three small rooms: one which was a darkly lit lounge, another was a dining room, and an additional room was designated for small private parties.  The room we were seated in was towards the back of the restaurant, which was minimally decorated with soft lighting and natural toned decor throughout. I found the overall ambiance to be quite calming and conducive to a relaxing dining experience. It was also nice that the room had limited seating, which helped with minimizing the noise factor. Our waiter/sommelier Brian, came out soon after we were seated and proceeded to welcome us to the restaurant and provided us with a little history on the chef, which was nice.  He was very polite and helpful with explaining our various dinner courses and subsequent wine pairings, as well. \nWe had the 11 course meal (which was the only choice in the dining room at the time) with the wine pairing.\nThe menu items for the evening:\nFrozen mandarin sour - This frozen treat was a whimsical play on the popular cocktail, which had the most delicate and delightful Mandarin orange gelee i've ever tasted! It was smooth and a pleasant addition to the dish. I could taste the various citrus flavors with a pleasant blend of sweet and salty, from the Angostura bitters, as the shaved ice melted on my tongue. The sparkling saki pairing, gave the dish a bright and effervescent finish!\nOysters under glass - reminded me of the Izakaya I've had in Japan. A very simple dish in presentation yet complex in flavors and texture. I must admit, however, it wasn't my favorite. I prefer my oysters chilled, unfortunately, these were served room temperature. \nPasture - Beets roasted in hay. Herbaceous with a nice blend of clean & earthy flavors. Presented much like a beef tartare. Textures were smooth, rich and surprisingly sweet. The German Reisling had a sweetness that paired well with the naturally sweet flavor of the beets. It also brought out the herbaceous aromas of all the fresh herbs on the plate, as well. \nInterestingly, we were served our bread after the first two courses.  Mind you, this was done deliberately. In any case, the breads were served nice and warm.  The addition of homemade unsalted butter with a side of course sea salt was a nice touch.\nCrab Melt (California Style) - Magnificently presented! The crab itself was prepared in an almost pureed form , which was rich, creamy and flavorful.  In contrast, the crust was crisp and light. Easily one of my favorite dishes. \nFarm egg - Cauliflower was creamy and blanketed the egg perfectly. The breaking of the yolk was so much fun and it was even more fun to eat! The Chardonnay pairing added a pleasant dimension of flavor that rounded out the flavors of this rich dish perfectly!\nEarth & Sea - Steamed tofu mouselline, mushroom dashi, yuba and fresh seaweed.  The soup base tasted very similar to a miso, but the moussline added an interesting textural twist.\nPorridge - Earthy, rustic and hearty. The Chanterelle mushrooms acted like the protein in this dish, which gave it a pleasant flavor and aroma. The crisp root vegetables added some nice crunchy texture, as well.\nPrather Ranch Beef - Savory, smooth and melted like butter in my mouth. Potatoes were served like creamy horseradish. Very interesting presentation.\nReblochun - The cheese was very creamy, smooth.  It also had a light nutty flavor, which worked well with the mixed chicories on the plate.  \nLime sherbet - Pleasantly tart and the meringue chips were light and crisp! All the various flavors and textures were surprisingly harmonious in this inspiring dessert.\nBread & chocolate - Chocolate was rich, creamy and smooth, much like a pot de creme or mousse. The brioche croutons were buttery and soft like little sugar cookies.  The pistachio dusted on the plate added a nice balance of flavors and the wine pairing added a sweet finish to this decadent dessert!\nWe were given a complementary dessert with our check which was  Firecorn berry gel dessert with pine nut chocolate crisps - The Firecorn berry gel was sweet and flavorful.  The texture was much like a sugar coated fruit gel, but much more tart and less cloyingly sweet. The pine nut chocolate crisps were delicate, rich and delicious.\n\nOverall, our server/sommelier Bryan was amazing! Each dish came out at a good pace with wine presented just before the courses were served.\nHis service was truly spot on from start to finish! This was a phenomenal experience with many pleasant surprises!\n\nTwo Michelin stars for Coi, Five well deserved stars from Moi :)\n\nHappy Eats!", "author": "Kent D."}

We did feel a bit rushed through each dish though, they came out rather quickly one after another so it was hard to register each flavor into our pallets.

To be fair, we did come during the changing of seasons (November - late fall/early winter) and I know their menu changes every week according to what is in season.  Maybe if we came in the warmer summer months, the available fruits and vegetables would have been more vibrant.\n\nDefinitely a nice restaurant to try out, but for the kind of $ we've spent of this meal, there are plenty of other fine restaurants in the city I would rather pick over this one.", "author": "Janetto L."}

I was lucky enough to book at Coi and what I was left with was an adventure seating for 1. My review consist of their chef set menu for the month of April. The service is top notch with an explanation of every dish served. I will talk about just a couple of the dishes since the menu does change often. 1st item that blew my mind was the sous vide egg yolk that had the consistency of a thick custard. Dressed with creme fraiche and a dollop of sturgeon caviar. This one plate out of the 10 items blew my mind for the night. The 2nd item would be the filet mignon cooked rare with braised lettuce and pickled red cabbage. The red cabbage added the perfect amount of acidity to the fattyness of the meat. Lastly the cheese dish was over the top. The cheese is prepared by the same cheese lady at French laundry . The cheese is a buffalo cheese surrounded by wild flowers of which the buffalo actually graze on. The cheese had some amazing notes without even eating the wild flowers. \n\nThis place is fantastic and I would suggest you go when you can. It's not cheap but being the top 50 restaurant in the world means it ain't going to be cheap. It's got 2 Michelin stars for a reason. Lastly you will be full by the end of the meal I promise. There are ao many dishes and so many different breads to try you will be plump after it all.", "author": "steven l."}

Eating at Coi helped me hone unchartered territory. \n\nVery minimalist interior and a bit bright for my liking. \n\nThe most ZEN part of the evening: apply an essential oil to the skin while enjoying a course. \n\nThere is only 1 menu, so expect to pay at LEAST $145/pp w/tax + tip & it'll be a dry nt. \n\nPresentation and service is EXCELLENT, I was especially blown away by the diminutive courses & how elegantly they were arranged.\n\nPotties: One for men and another for women, they are lax about the gender distinctions. Check out the in-sink decor. \n\nReally not much meat on the menu, but all elements were a surprise and flavors really popped in the mouth. Favorites of the evening were the globular honey amuse that exploded in our mouths, the 4 tiny potatoes that were fantastically seasoned, the interesting texture/taste of the olive tuille, the perfectly smooth pea soup w/crushed ice, the sublime Asian inspired bean curd soup, and the balsamic sprinkled leaves paired w/slivers of cheese.

Pretty yummy creative dinner, marred by only 2 things: an overemphasis on citrus (I think almost every dish had some element of something citrus-y in it!), and also by the servers forgetting to bring us the bread course.

Yes, it hit the mark for most Michelin requirements -- consistency of the dishes, impeccable service, pompous ambiance, etc. However, the food was surprisingly underwhelming. Some dishes were overly complex and the overall taste was compromised for the sake of adding in another texture or flavour profile (undying pursuit for a \"balanced\" dish) -- I don't need every single one of my dishes to have something acidic, sweet, bitter, crunchy, and soft in it. Ultimately, while no dish tasted particularly bad, I would have rather had a burger from Shake Shack instead.", "author": "Eric Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-29", "description": "The flavor palate at Coi is unlike any other restaurant that I've experienced, and I don't fault them for attempting interesting, challenging food. Be forewarned that many of the plates are much more acidic than one normally finds. At times, this was jarring; at others, intriguing. But generally, I enjoyed my food.\n\nSo why two stars? Although I found some of the food to be quite good, there was nothing that I think that I'll remember (and some things that I thought were misses), and for a restaurant of this caliber and price point, I want it to be a memorable experience. Add to that the miscues in service-which again are unforgivable at a restaurant of this caliber, especially since they charge a mandatory gratuity which they then charge tax on-and I must say that I've experienced better at this price point (most notably at Willows Inn just last week).\n\nSome highlights:\n-Inverted beet and goat cheese tart. Visually, I thought I was eating raspberries topped with cream and a pastry cracker, but in reality, I enjoyed the light sweetness of the beats combined with the tang and acidity of the goat cheese, a hint of dill, and the textural contrast of the tart wafer.\n-Sunchoke soup. This was like the sweet corn soup at Gary Danko that people rave about, but so much better. I don't know if I could identify all of the delicious things hidden in the soup (hazelnuts? chanterelles?), but they provided wonderful contrasts to the savoriness of the soup.\n-Spiced baba. Not at all what I was expecting from a dessert. Complex flavors and textures for a dessert, again with acidity coming from the yogurt layered within.\n\nSome lowlights:\n-Radish salad with yuzu. Maybe I'm just not the biggest fan of yuzu, but this was a lot of acid and citrus after a faux-aperitif of citrus and salt.\n-Glazed tofu on grains. This was the most disappointing dish of the night. The grains were fine (although had been repeated from the abalone dish of the previous course of the regular tasting menu), but the tofu was not at all interesting. It was just tofu. I'm actually rather shocked that they would serve grilled tofu at a restaurant like this.\n\nFinally, the service leaves much to be desired. The two most unforgivable mishaps: 1) they forgot a course, which only came after I asked about it, and 2) the water service was so bad that at one point, I had to ask them for a larger glass since it seemed to be too hard for them to keep mine full (in one instance, we had two different servers visit our table to clear our plates, provide new ones, and pour wine, and neither server was capable of noticing our empty water glasses). Granted, the service seemed to get better after I pointed out that they had forgotten to give us a course, but that shouldn't have been necessary. I recognize that these are major first world problems, but when you're spending this much on food and they effectively charge a ~20% gratuity (since they tax their mandatory gratuity), I think it's reasonable to have high expectations on service.\n\nAnyway, do I think Coi is worth the visit? Yes. Would it be the first place I recommend to a friend visiting SF or for a friend looking for a place to celebrate a special occasion? No. For that, I still think that Commis is my top choice in the Bay Area (and it's at roughly half the cost of Coi...)\n\nNote: They apparently DO NOT do anything special for birthdays any more. Or at least they didn't last night for my dining companion's birthday, even though I told them twice that we would be celebrating his birthday at their restaurant.\n\nMore notes: People came in all sorts of dress. Very few in formal attire. Wear what you will. Yes, the neighborhood is sketch, and it's next to strip clubs. Probably easiest just to pay for valet parking. Dining room is nice and not crowded, unlike Gary Danko. Surprisingly empty for most of the time that we were there from 7:30 to 10:30 on a Friday. It was clear that they didn't fill every table. Easy to have a conversation. Music was weird combination of 90s easy pop with bad elevator music.", "author": "Edward C."}

I am still ambivalent, and think it is 2.5. Basically, I wouldn't go back.\n\nI am not sure where to go with this, yet.  I will write down the courses and wine pairings, but I realized why I wasn't excited to write a review, and why it was going to take a bit to work up the energy....  and that simple reason is because I came out of the experience, *immediately* with passive ambivalence.  After a meal like that, and a check like that, there should be nothing but active raving.  But it's almost that I wanted it behind me....  it was fantastic, beautiful, and delicious... \n\nThe product here is so unbelievable in the Bay Area, the execution matters so much more.... all the product is the best in the world, in this area, so plating is vital.  All the chefs go to the same markets, they are using the same products from the same farmers... so unless you grow stuff yourself (which so many chefs are doing), there is no real way to differentiate yourself beyond the plating and execution..... therefore we find more insecurity, and too much flourish, capping the SF food scene - people jockeying for position with little daring maneuvers and attempts.\n\nCoi was taking simple, beautiful, accessible products and making them uppity with no real depth, or too inaccessible, favoring art over function.  It was not disappointing, but I should be raving.\n\nThis one sentence sort of explains it....  I just wrote it to a chef friend:\n\n\"Daniel is epic, and art is fun, but when the form goes so far over function, that the beauty on the front end is tempered by the fact you are just eating fancy veggies, the bill gives you a sticker shock that makes you forget about the plating.\"\n\nThat is as simple as I could put it.  When getting into multi-coursed stuff, maybe I want something a bit more traditional, or maybe I like artistic food to match it's visibly distinguished exterior, but in the end it just felt like fresh veggies that were played with for a bit too long.  It was delicious, and the product was solid - but making such obviously simple stuff into expressively pretentious plates fell far shorter to my mind than the final bill did.\n\nI am waffling on making this a 2... so I leave it 3 hoping the review speaks for itself, and I don't have to court negative energy with that yellow looking star rating. =) (ED NOTE: the more I ruminate on this experience, the angrier I get.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-13", "description": "The basics:\nWednesday, December 8, 2010, 9pm reservations. We had the 11-course tasting menu without the wine pairing.\n\nThe pictures:\nhttp://picasaweb.google.com/ethanteng/DinnerAtCoi?feat=directlink\n\nThe menu:\nFrozen Mandarin Sour - Angostura bitters, kumquat, satsuma Ice\nOysters Under Glass - Marin miyagi oysters, yuzu, rau ram\nPasture - Beets roasted in hay, fresh cheese, wild sprouts and flowers\nCrab Melt, California Style - Steffan's largo, wheatgrass\nFarm Egg - Cauliflower, nettle-dandelion salsa verde\nEarth and Sea - Steamed tofu mousseline, mushroom dashi, yuba, fresh seaweed\nSavory Chanterelle Porridge - Crisp root vegetables, cress, sherry\nPrather Ranch Beef (substituted with chicken) - Black garlic, carrot, sudachi, spinach, cilantro\nGrilled Cheese - Beaufort, rye, onion, pickled daikon\nCheesecake - Goat cheese, graham cracker, niabell grape, nasturtium\nCinnamon Smoked Apples - Iced buttermilk, hazelnut\n\nThe atmosphere:\nThe decor looked like it came straight out of the Room & Board catalog. And maybe I'm just used to noisy restaurants in San Francisco, but since the restaurant isn't that large and doesn't seat many people, it felt eerily quiet, especially since there wasn't any ambient music playing, either. In general, I'd describe the ambiance as rather sterile and cold; I really never felt at ease the entire time I was there, and was literally shivering a bit towards the end. Seriously, someone needs to turn up both the heat and the lights -- the lighting was, if possible, too soft in there -- and put on some Philip Glass. (I don't know why Philip Glass; he just seems to go with the place.) And some punches of color wouldn't hurt, either. Accent pillows, anyone?\n\nThe service:\nMuch like the ambiance: extremely professional yet sterile. Each dish was brought to our table with the standard introduction, but no one ever followed up to ask if we enjoyed them or if we had any questions. I did ask a couple of questions over the course of the evening and our server was happy to answer them, but generally I got the impression they were really trying hard not to be intrusive, which I usually appreciate. However, with the already cold ambiance, I was slightly put off by the forced distance; I didn't really feel like I was actually welcome to ask questions. To their credit, they did ask without any prompting towards the end of our meal if we were there for a special occasion (we were) and sent out an extra dessert for us.\n\nThe Frozen Mandarin Sour:\nI'd rate this as one of my top 3 dishes that night. I loved the iciness and bitterness. It also quite unexpectedly salty, which I couldn't decide was something I liked or not. But that debate helped make the dish memorable.\n\nThe Oysters Under Glass:\nThis was also a favorite. It tied in very well with the Frozen Mandarin Sour. A lot of the flavors - sour and salty - was carried over into this dish but with a completely different texture, which I thought was interesting.\n\nThe Crab Melt:\nOut of all the dishes, I think this was really the only one I didn't care for. I know it's supposed to be crab, but it had a strong fish smell which put me off. I got used to it towards the end, but I can't say I enjoyed the overall experience. The wheatgrass also confused me; I just didn't get the pairing of flavors.\n\nThe Farm Egg:\nGuess where the cauliflower is in this dish? It's the ring of foam around the egg yolk! How cool is that? And extremely yummy, too.\n\nThe Earth and Sea:\nThis dish was wonderful. The tofu was amazingly creamy and light.\n\nThe Prather Ranch Beef:\nWe opted out of the beef since we don't eat red meat. The kitchen substituted it with chicken which was unfortunately not successful. I'd say it was only slightly better than the chicken you'd get on an airplane. (Ouch, harsh!) But the side dish that came with it was beautiful and extremely tasty.\n\nThe Cheesecake:\nUsually I'm not a huge fan of \"deconstruction\" but this was quite yummy. I quite liked the grape sorbet; it was a really unexpected flavor.\n\nThe Last Taste:\nI unfortunately don't remember what the official name of this dish was, and it wasn't listed on the menu. But it was basically gelatinous beets. Sweet and salty to end the evening.\n\nThe Final Word:\nI would say the food was consistently great except for the crab melt, though the menu did get a bit heavy over the second half of the meal. In general, the experience lacked any peaks or valleys; nothing was exceptionally wonderful or unforgivably awful. Because of that, I know I won't remember this meal in 6 months.

They did take the time to explain the setup with two different dining rooms, and asked us if we had a preference.  We had no preference, and were led to the back dining room when we arrived - the host seemed to have lost his voice the night we were there.\n\nThere's a menu.  And a vegetable option.  That's about all the choices you get.  We elected to receive menus at the end, and dined not knowing exactly what was to come next.  There are also a couple of wine pairing options - a glass per course, or approximately half as many.  Fearing for our lives, my companion chose the smaller option.  They are generous with re-pours, but often neglect to mention exactly how many courses one should expect to have a particular wine for.  Our pairing contained two glasses of sake in addition to wine, but no beers.\n\nThe food was all very good - flavors clear, platings creative and beautiful.  Tofu and tomatoes, a raw spot prawn, a duck tongue and abalone salad that seemed out of place in a fine dining menu, a lichen encrusted beef tenderloin.  Quite a lot of Asian inspiration, actually.  A few courses that fell a little flat - a celtuce and potato dish was uncomfortably salty, a fromage blanc was sort of bland and a toasted marshmallow-like substance in one of the desserts was more burnt than carmelized.  Overall, though, these are small gripes, and the meal was very, very good.\n\nService was friendly and properly descriptive.  Not everyone knew every detail, but when they didn't know the answer to a question about the food, information was quickly sought and returned.\n\nThe check included an 18% mandatory service charge with space for additional gratuity.  ( I do not know if this policy was stated on the menu, but since we were offered and accepted the option not to see the menu, we could not have known ahead of time. )  We were left conflicted - though pleased by the service to such an extent that we would naturally have tipped much more, we make it a matter of policy never to provide an additional tip in such cases.\n\nIn our minds, Coi stands with Benu and Altelier Crenn as a restaurant doing modern fine dining right.  The dishes are fresh, seasonal and flavorful.  The service we received was very good.  We regret not having tried it sooner.", "author": "Albert H."}

It's an 11 dish menu. of the 11 dishes, only 3 weren't vegetarian. This was a disappointment. Not even one fish dish. All in all lots of vegetables and broth - but no main center piece to each dish. \n\nWe also took the full wine pairing. All wines were nice, but nothing was so special, I just waited to get home to buy myself a case of it. \n\nThis dinner was a huge disappointment. I won't recommend it. It also come to something like $660 for a couple, including the full wine tasting and the service.

Where does one begin after such a fine evening of dining?! \nShort trip to San Fran, but I knew I wanted to eat here. \n\nDaniel Patterson has recently been named best chef in the west by the James Beard Foundation, has 2 Michelin Stars; and very recently named the 49th best restaurant in the world by the San Pellegrino 50 Best Restaurant List. I was expecting great things...and I was not disappointed. \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is very minimalistic and has an outdoors type feeling with fresh cut wood tabletops and driftwood hanging from the ceiling. The service is on point and never over-attentive. The serving vessels are all handcrafted pottery and are all very wonderful in appearance. \n\nNow, on to the main attractions - great, sophisticated, manageable wine list that would please most anyone. The sommelier was very knowledgeable and helpful. \nThe food! Oh the food! \n\nThey tell you they have a set eight-course menu. However, there were multiple additional offerings that were highly exciting in their own right. I ended up being served 14 courses! Brown rice crisps started the show and were paired with a delicious tart avocado puree. Next I was served a simple, but sublime plum ice with black lime shavings - what a perfect palate cleanser. This course almost seemed to dissipate on the tongue leaving a wonderful taste. Next was a delicious earthy-tasting chilled spiced eggplant soup. Out came the next dish that was almost a show stopper for me! They served a \"smoked\" egg yolk with cr\u00e8me fraiche that was topped with California Sturgeon caviar. This dish was awesome - very rich and smoky yolk with a perfect consistency topped with very wonderfully salty caviar - such a good dish. Out came the seared spot prawns in a wonderful fermented purple carrot juice with tart cucumber slices! Subtle prawn sweetness bathing in incredibly light, but powerful flavors! Some of the next courses were cherry tomatoes with puree of grilled zucchini, broken and inverted beet and goat cheese tart (this was a close favorite), red trout cooked in lemon leaf broth, and an interesting and earthy porcini mushroom and potato dumpling. The main protein course was a grilled pigeon with tart cherries. Very interesting as I do not have pigeon often - but I have to say it was delicate and delicious. The pairing with the cherries helped to make it \"pop\". I don't know what I had next, but it was called a coconut mocha bun and it was soft, chewy, and awesome - it was like a taco with a soft coconut shell surrounding a piece of kiwi! So cool and delicious! For dessert I was served glazed strawberries, which were great, but made amazing by the fennel sorbet they were served with - oh so delicious! Lastly, they served a blueberry and violet dessert with a vanilla cake that was soft, sweet, tart, and perfect! The final offering was a wonderful citrus yuzu marshmallow covered with frozen dark chocolate! Every course was perfect. Not all were my favorite, but put out as a while meal - this was most memorable and sublime! I feel lucky to have dined here.\n\nIf you are ever in San Francisco and want to experience true culinary greatness, do not miss COI.", "author": "Caleb Y."}

Unfortunately it was not. \n\nOf the 11-course, there were def some great dishes of the bunch which included the abalone dish which was quite perfect in flavors and presentation. There were also some dishes that were like \"did I really just pay for this?\" Prime example was the popcorn \"grits\" which was grounded up popcorn mixed with butter that tasted like grits.

I still to this day recall the amazing things they did with salsify, taking a quite an ordinary vegetable (which at other places tastes like the inside of the stem of broccoli) and renders it into something that could take on filet or foie grois (ok, I love both of those, so that may be slightly an exaggeration, but hopefully you get the point).", "author": "Vijay P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-12", "description": "Truly an experience, that's definitely worth a visit.  Coi differentiates itself from traditional fine dining restaurants in the prolific use of simple ingredients by the chef.  You won't find the customary high end staples such as foie gras, lobster, caviar etc. on the menu.  The emphasis is placed on the preparation and unique presentation of each dish.\n\nGiven that they stress the importance of individual flavors, the portions for each course are quite small.  I believe they deliberately do this so you don't fill up on any one course and have room to fully appreciate the following courses.  While a great concept, we actually would not have been full if we did not order the wine pairings to accompany the meal.  So don't expect to come here and stuff yourself, just be prepared to accept quality over quantity.  \n\nIn a way, the 11 course tasting menu is too restrictive.  To truly enjoy the food here, you have to have absolute zero food allergies and can't be picky about what you eat. They do ask if you have allergies, but the substitution in our experience was sub par.  My friend who doesn't eat seafood was basically given all cucumber salad as a substitution for the geoduck and cucumber salad course. Obviously the geoduck costs a lot more than cucumbers.  \n\nMy favorites on the tasting menu were the geoduck and cucumber salad, chilled split pea soup, butter roasted morels and steak tartar.  Each were prepared and executed well, with the accompanying garnishes really bringing out the flavor of the central focus for a particular dish.  \n\nIf you are adventurous and are willing to spend 300+(with wine pairings) a person for dinner for a special occasion, give Coi a try.", "author": "Wei K."}

Some better than others but it was all delicious. Below are the three dishes that I felt were standouts.\n\n1. The \"nest\" with the slow cooked egg yolk was a smooth and creamy like a custard. Delicious. \n2. The monterey bay abalone - delicious. Perfectly cooked. Soft yet chewy.\n3. The silken white chocolate with kiwi - awesome!\n\nEvery dish was well prepared. Perfectly seasoned. And service was attentive but not stuffy. The host explained every meal and everyone (8 people) was served at the same time. \n\nThe dishes had nice contrasting layers of flavor and texture. Almost every dish had a \"crunch\" element to it. I am a big fan of texture as an element of flavor so I was impressed.\n\nAnd now the bad:\n\n11 course tasting menu = 4 hours. Yeup....  expect to enjoy your whole night here.\n\nPortion size is very small. Yes very small. The photos shown in the Yelp gallery are not to scale. If you think the food portion size in the gallery is small (which I did) you are in for a surprise (I was). At $200+/pp you expect to be full not stuffed but full. Nope. I felt every dish could easily be double the size. I'm not looking for cheesecake factory size Texas portions but comeon!\n\nPerfect example: The lamb dish cooked two ways. The tartar used a ring mold with a 5 cm diameter. Yes 5 cm (not inches)! And the loin = two pieces! Yes, two pieces the size of a kit kat. Wait.... I think a kit kat is longer... correction the size of one kit kat broken in half. That is your two course protein dish plus a small bowl of the best abalone you have ever ate.\n\nThe meal ends with a complimentary almond brittle that was delicious. But again one piece per person. \n\nNo amuse bouche. Bread service was one slice per person. The slice of a baguette not a real loaf. No bread cart. No extra special treats in the end. \n\nIn between the wait I found myself in the bathroom enjoying the rocks in the sink (that's probably what makes a restaurant go from 1 to 2 Michelin star) and mapping which of the pizza joints in North Beach I wanted to go to afterwards to get a slice of pie to complete my meal.\n\nI would recommend Gary Danko (more attentive service, well rounded meal, better portion sizes, better price) or the House right up the street on North Beach (more casual but nicely prepared meals at a great price).", "author": "Tom L."}

I thought the next dish was ready to be served, but we waited more than five minutes.  Our sommelier was  the worst. When he opened a bottle for us, he poured some for the tasting.  At the first glance, it was murky, thus I clearly showed my concern on my face, but the sommelier just ignored as if nothing happened. In addition, he didn't pay attention to serve the rest for us, I had to ask the server to fill up my empty glass.  Eventually, I had to enjoy the last glass without meal.  As we could imagine, they started to bring sweets while I still enjoy wine.  At the end of the meal, they brought the bill with 18% service charge \"included\".

Well now I can say that I have.  A sweet butternut squash custard topped with, yes, BLUE BOTTLE COFFEE bits, then served with a pouring of a creamy apple soup.  The tartness of the apple blended strangely well with the sweet squash.  \n\nCourse 6: Popcorn Grits\nDefinitely an innovative take at popcorn, humorously served side by side with actual movie popcorn.  The waiter described the process in making the grits in great detail (popped corn that's mashed and the residue that is strained seven times over to reach grits consistency) - which I appreciated since end of the day i was eating a spoonful of grits with some popcorn.  The grits tasted heavily of butter popcorn, and had a thick layer of butter coating it.  Haha yum but can we say greasy?\n\nCourse 7: Celtuce (hay ash, tarragon, comte)\nThe ancester of our more commonly-eaten lettuce, but more of a stem than leaf vegetable.  Served in thin slices over a thin slice of parmesean-like cheese and some potato.  Refreshing and not heavy... probably good after that popcorn grits.\n\nCourse 8: Abalone (chicory, meyer lemon) \nOh, Abalone, how I love thee.  Chewy as it was not served in the usual thinly sliced fashion (at least in Western cuisine), rather in mini chunks that seemed to be seared/grilled.  Tasty, but quite chewy.\n\nCourse 9: Beef (lichen crusted, porcini, new zealand spinach, native spices) \nPerfectly cooked little bite with a very dark colored, thin crust. Finally some protein!!!!\n\nCourse 10: Citron (lime marshmallow, gin) \nI liked this dish a lot. Sliced candied lemons with a small candy that bursted open upon putting it in your mouth... not too sweet, not too sour, just refreshing enough.\n\nCourse 11: Chocolate/Chicory\nA mousse/cake like dessert topped with gooey milk chocolate \"kisses\".  MmmMmm.\n\nTo be honest, I was surprised that I was full after even 11 dishes as each one was quite small in portion, but I did appreciate not leaving feeling stuffed and really gross.

The kumquat added texture.\n\nI really enjoyed the beets, the pea soup, the second duck course, the goat tart, fried egg not fried, and both desserts. The chef is not afraid to use a full spectrum of flavors, including some challenging ones, like wheatgrass. The artichoke with delta crawfish was good, but somehow the crawfish flavor didn't stand out when combined with the other ingredients. I liked the presentation of the oyster and asparagus, and the asparagus was cooked perfectly, but the oyster wasn't amazing. The abalone dish was tough - one of our neighbors refused to eat it since she couldn't cut it, but I though it was fine. We both loved the marshmallow lime thing. Our favorite wine was a sparkling wine (fior d'arancio moscato) paired with the marshmallow. The coffee comes in an interesting flask, and was very good.

Service was great with teams working together seamlessly to change silverware, clear dishes, etc.  The food was innovative and tasty, but I feel like the experience was more of an experience than dinner.

Spoke to the servers at Per Se and this is the restaurant they'd come to sample food when in SF. So it got good endorsement. I do prefer just a bit more of a substantial food though Coi served up. For a three hour eating affair, I think it's worth it, but I am going to have to give it 4 because it's not quite 5. Pricy yes but it's good I'm looking forward to my other 2 star Michelin adventure this year to give it a proper comparison. note that French Laundry gets a 3. So this is one step below.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-01-06", "description": "I visited the restaurant a couple of weeks ago and was looking forward to a true 2 star experience. Afterword, I really wondered how Coi even managed 1 star let alone 2. The atmosphere is simple, but quite nice and we were greeted warmly. We were seated a bit early due to our early arrival which was a nice touch.  I will say, the service was great and the dishes were well paced.  The majority of the great service came from the busser staff and less on our actual waiter which is fine, but that didn't lend itself to asking more questions about the dishes. The menu only had 6 courses with a couple of small amuse bouches at the beginning. For the massive price and tiny portions, I would have thought there would have been a couple of more courses offered. We decided to go with the parings as we always tend to do that with any starred restaurant. \n \nThe food:\nThe food was nicely presented, but it just didn't hit the mark on execution. The food was underwhelming except for the smoked egg yolk and caviar dish which was great. The rest of the dishes seemed uninspired and lacked any punch that one would expect from a 2 star Michelin restaurant. Even for the egg yolk dish, while good, we have had similar versions in other restaurants. While I'm all for letting the ingredients speak for themselves, like the oyster we were served, I feel the kitchen didn't put forth much effort into the creativity of the dishes. For $195.00 per person I expect a lot more than an oyster with Myer lemon and apple, or a blood orange granita served in a shot glass. Pure evidence of uninspired \"go through the motions cuz we're Michelin rated\" type execution.  \n\nThe wine parings were ok, but heavy on lighter whites with only one red served which I thought lacked research and attention. If you're a red drinker, just go with a light pinot and you will be able to get by just fine with the menu without the paring. The wine director seemed competent and was attentive, but not once did he crack a smile or engage other than just pouring the wine and giving a short description. We felt that took away from the overall experience. \n \nBottom line:\nCOI was not worth the extreme inflated costs and the 2 star Michelin rating. I actually felt duped, and not to mention in need of a sandwich after we left the restaurant.  If in the South Bay, get your 2 star fix by going to Manresa. The food and wine service at Manresa is by FAR more inspired and creative.", "author": "Daniel P."}

It has moments of brilliance but at other times it shoots itself in the foot.\n\nThe food at our recent dinner was very good and inventive.  And expensive.  One of the prices that Coi pays for charging premium rates ($175 per person for the tasting menu before any drinks) is that there is no room for error.  They have to be perfect every time and with every dish.  There were several amazing dishes -- spot prawn with watermelon, eggplant soup, roasted beets, lightly cooked salmon.  But most of those weren't truly innovative or challenging.  There was a smoked egg yolk course with caviar that was very innovative but the yolk was too much and overpowered everything else on the plate.  All in all, I would give 4 stars for the food.  Very good, but for the price, not in the top group in SF.\n\nService is where they lose the other stars.  There was a long delay between a couple courses, but they noticed the delay and apologized for it, so that wasn't a deal-breaker for me.  But the wine service was simply bad (not the sommelier, mind you, he was helpful).  Here, when you order a bottle of wine, they keep it on a little shelf at the end of the room.  Incumbent on them, with that philosophy, is to notice when your glass is empty and re-fill it.  I am a wine fan, and love to enjoy great food and wine together.  We unfortunately had to continuously flag down servers to get them to pour our wine into our empty glasses.  It was comical at times.  Though we had no wine in our glasses for the last 20 minutes of the meal, turned out we still had a third of the bottle left sitting on their wine shelf after I paid the tab.  We had assumed the bottle was empty and only found out because we asked the server to double-check to see if there was a drop left for us as I was paying the tab.\n\nSad that poor service can leave such a negative impression, because on food alone, I'd give it four stars.", "author": "Zac A."}

I'll be quick and say that Coi certainly stands up to them (and even came close to the 3-starred places I've been to). \n\nThe food was really amazing.  It's vegetable-centric, but you won't end up missing the meat. For example, the cherry tomato dish (with some zucchini/wheatgrass puree) was outstanding, and one of the best vegetable dishes (and the best tomato dish) I've ever had.\n\nAlthough speaking of meat, the Emigh Ranch lamb was pretty amazing--perfectly cooked with lots of melt-in-your-mouth fat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-23", "description": "My love affair with Coi began roughly one year ago, when I stepped into the serene dining room and proceeded to have one of the best meals of my life. After 2 more tasting menu extravaganzas, I quickly realized that maintaining such a regular schedule at one of the most notable, expensive restaurants in SF was sheer madness, and a cloud of sadness crept over me. Until I discovered one of San Francisco's best-kept secrets: the Lounge at Coi.\n\nFirst - important to note that that lounge closes April 1st and gives way to more dining room seating, but I wanted to write about it anyway. Coi's lounge is quite simply one of the best deals in this city. It offers its own special menu AND you can order any item off of the tasting menu! With all plates priced under $20, I clearly thought it was too good to be true. \n\nLuckily, it's not too good to be true. It's real. And my two dining experiences in the lounge have turned into my favorites in a long line of memorable meals. But it was Chef Patterson's ability to convey a genuine, clear sense of place in every dish that made my most recent visit truly the most impressive.\n \nThe Geoduck and Manila CLAM was the perfect way to start the meal. By combining the clam's hints of subtle sweetness with the geoduck's fish-fragrant flavor of the ocean, and adding in refreshing bites of bull kelp which suggested the presence of coastal waters, this dish brought the sea to the plate. \n\nThe dish that followed, which Chef Patterson entitled \"Pasture,\" caught me by surprise. Described as \"BEETS Roasted in Hay, Fresh Cheese, Wild Sprouts, and Flowers\" I expected a simple, semi-firm roasted beet on a plate. However, what arrived was more of a thick beet pur\u00e9e, with the fresh Andante cheese combined with the mashed red beets to form a soft, creamy puddle on the plate. Simply topped with a smattering of wild sprouts and flowers, I felt like the best fed horse in the history of the world.\n \nThis was followed by a taste of the California coastline: a CRAB MELT with Steffan's Lardo and Wheatgrass. I was suddenly transported back to the local farms of California with the next dish: the FARM EGG with Cauliflower and a Nettle-Dandelion Salsa Verde. The egg's gooey richness, the cauliflower's firm but succulent flavor, and the freshness of the greens were in perfect harmony and communicated the unique location of these ingredients.\n\nThen came yet another surprise: Savory Chanterelle PORRIDGE with Crisp Root Vegetables, Cress, and Sherry. The last time I saw porridge on the menu was on a visit to the Three Bears' House, and even though I thought that the bowl I had there was just right, I was wrong. The warm, comforting, coziness of this earthy dish absolutely blew me away. Despite my initial reservations, this was not only my favorite dish of the meal, but one of the most memorable dishes I've experienced at Coi.\n\nAnd although there's never much meat on Coi's menu, every time they do it, they do it to perfection.  The taste of the Prather Ranch BEEF, with Potato, Coastal Grasses, and Monterey Cypress was so pure and cleanthat it would almost be unfair to other restaurants if Coi offered multiple meaty selections on the menu.\n\nFinally, in my mind putting a GRILLED CHEESE sandwich on the menu is taking a big risk. I quietly thought to myself, \"Okay Patterson. Bring it.\" Oh, and he brought it my friends. Oh yes...he brought it. As skeptical as I might have been, that grilled cheese sandwich, with house-made pickles, was just about as close to flawless as a sandwich can get.\n\nI left thinking two things. The first: \"Wow. I can't believe I just fell in love with porridge.\" But more seriously, my second thought was that Coi, which I've regarded as the best fine-dining restaurant in the Bay Area for some time, is only getting better.

I, personally, don't like having the same dish twice because it ruins the surprise and anticipation so it is best to go once a season.  Been here two Christmas Eves ago for the prix fixe in the main dining room when I didn't Yelp or live in San Francisco and was impressed even then.  Most recently I enjoyed my first Coi meal as a resident in the lounge area which gives you full access to the prix fixe items \u00e0 la carte as well as a host of large portion items only available there.\n\nFrozen Mandarin Sour: What a way to open up the palate!  The tart and bitter flavors awoke my senses and even the wine I was drinking tasted better.  Love the use of mandarin juice as well as peel in the dish.\n\nBeet & Goat Cheese Tart (Broken, Inverted): Tart is a very loose term.  It's basically dill pur\u00e9e topped with goat cheese topped with minced beets topped with a crunchy rye wafer.  I've never had beets that tasted so fresh and so earthy.  The dill was in short supply, so only added a hint of flavor.  The rye crisp was just enough to give texture without the carb overload of  a proper pasty shell.\n\nSunchoke Soup: A very under appreciated tuber, the sunchoke tasted so smooth and nutty in the creamy soup.  The cocoa nibs were a great bitter contrast to the mellow soup.  The pear was ok for texture but didn't add much flavor since it was so overpowered by the rest.  I enjoyed how the mint came in very thin slices so not to dominate.\n\nWinter, Pastoral: This is probably one of those dishes you either really love or really hate.  It's only a handful of really tender tiny carrots infused with hay flavor.  The aroma and taste does bring up notions of a barn.  It's hay-ey like scotch is peaty, so you don't completely feel like Mr. Ed eating it.  The hay agar was extremely weird, but I appreciated the attempt at creativity.  Barely noticed the cheese since the dish was really all about the carrots.\n\nGrilled Cheese: Hands down the best grilled cheese I've ever had!  The bread was some sort of whole wheat that had an extremely crispy/buttery outside and soft bready inside.  The gruy\u00e8re was pungent and melting over the sides.  Puzzled about how the outside could be so crispy and the cheese so melty, without making the inner bread hard, I had to ask.  Answer = Pan Sear then bake to melt the cheese.  Finally, something from this joint I can make at home!\n\nIt's Almost It: It's almost 1/4 the size of It's It.  The oatmeal is soft, almost melt away.  The chocolate and ice cream are obviously a world of complexity above the convenience store product.  Loved the fresh blood orange contrast on the side.\n\nYuzu Sorbet: A lot of Yuzus must have gone into this sorbet because it was potent!  With those lemons being so full of seeds, I was happy to have a dish made primarily from that short supply juice.  Dare I say, even better than the Meyer Lemon?", "author": "Adam B."}

We went to this meal about three days before we went to The French Laundry for the first time, and we had mentioned to people that we were going (as this meal involved replications of some of Thomas Keller's famous dishes). A couple of people there told us that we should go to Coi because it's better and you can get in easier.\n\nWell, it was easy to get in. We booked a table for six I think and had the private dining room. Which was really quite nice. We all got the tasting menu and the wine pairings. Unfortunately, Coi just didn't do well at all. First at least half the courses were salty. And not just salty, but palate overwhelmingly salty. As in all you could taste was salt. It was disappointing. There were a few really nice courses, including a carrot soup, that were pretty spectacular, but that wasn't enough for the many salty courses.\n\nAlso, the wine pairings just didn't make sense. They all just seemed to have no relation at all to the food we were eating. Not that it was bad wine, it just seemed like the pairings had been developed for a completely different tasting menu.\n\nIt was a disappointment. When you go to a two Michelin star restaurant, you expect top quality, not over salted food. Maybe we just went on a bad night, but again, should a Michelin star restaurant really have a bad night?

Chef Daniel Patterson's hot spot and remaining 1 of the hottest fine dining and only 2 Michelin spot in San Francisco as of now!\n\n          With only 20 some seats at the lounge with beautiful walnut tables, over-sized pillows, and small modified menu featured some of the coolest dishes with vegetables, fish and meat.  In the tiny cove-like dining room, rice paper draped ceiling, and some tiny X-ray like of fruits and  veggies pictures, make this resto very enjoyable, relax, and \"tranquil\" just as the name has it, definitely compliment their tasting menus. \n\n         I've been followed his foot step from Elisabeth Daniel, then Frisson, Coi & then his latest spot PLUM in Oak Town! His creations are simply amazing.\n\n         Every meal at Coi begins with Amuse Bouche on a spoon beautifully! Chef Patterson is well-known for using the lesser known ingredients and makes them quite interesting, fascinating, but tasty at the same time! \n\n         We got to try these few outstanding dishes and all were exquisitely executed! All dishes were elegant, modern decorated, and surprised us again and again. \n\n- Panna Cotta,\n- Filet Monk Fisk, \n- Lamb Turnip,\n- Hamachi sashimi,\n- Rib Eye cut\n- And plenty more vegetable dishes in between!\n         \n           My mom got a little cake for her special occasion. My folks enjoyed the experience, but not the FAV in San Francisco. If you expect a lot of explaining of the dishes, you won't find it here, although the menu is detail enough for you. The wine list got upgraded since the last time we were here, more extensive, and decent mark up! The staff were friendly and attentive to us the whole evening. This is a trendy spot, modern decor venue, unpretentious. \n\n           Looking forward to his new spot, rumor has it in the work now!\n\nOverall: 5 stars\nFor value: 5 stars\nFor Food: 5 stars\nFor Service: 5 stars\nAmbiance: 5 stars\nFor Location: a few doors down from the busy North Beach, literally a block from Show Girls! valet parking available!", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

Expectations for a restaurant that charges a fixed price (nearly $400 for 2) are way, way high.  And the reality check was like a brick to the head.\n3.  The area we were seated in looked about as nice as the waiting room of a dentists's office.  \n4.  No one told me it was a set menu with a set price on Fri-Sun.  WTF?!  This is important information for me because I don't just go out and eat a 12 course meal without fasting the day before.  I just wanted an starter and a main.  Plus, I wasn't expecting to pay $400 for a meal in a restaurant that is next door to a strip club.\n5.  The first dish tasted like marmalade ice shavings with small pieces of marshmallow in it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-03-31", "description": "One of the better meals I've had (but not as good as French Laundry, Le Bernadin, Taillevent) ... came here for my birthday with my husband earlier this month.  Love the intimate nature of the restaurant.  However, the lack of any host stand/desk is a bit confusing if it's your first visit ... you walk into a room with tables and basically look around for someone with whom to check-in.  Coi (pronounced like the French \"quoi\") is an esoteric French term for tranquil, which describes Chef Patterson's demeanor (at least in our interactions) and, remarkably, the tenor of his kitchen during service.\n\nCan't find our menu, otherwise I'd rave about most of the dishes (including a most amazing brown chicken broth with Korean gochujang (and other ingredients)), a delicious crayfish stuffed chicken wing, and the duck (according to my husband).  I will says that 2 dishes left me flat -- the sea water coagulated tofu with trout roe and a green (grassy) sauce, and the asparagus (1 large spear, with again a grassy taste) with oyster dish (although the citrus component helped a lot).  Also, 1 component of my chicken dish (the chicken, itself, was outstanding), the barley accompaniment they put together on the fly, didn't come together very well.  The abalone in one our dishes was just a little tough ... though that is consistent with my only other experience with farmed abalone ... once had freshly (and legally) caught wild abalone and it was incredibly tender.  The radish dust with the tender, sweet young carrots was tasty and unique.\n\nDidn't do the wine pairings, so can't comment on whether they make sense.\n\nAll of the desserts were great, particularly the last one (which was in lieu of an earlier beet course) which had a chocolate exterior and a frozen interior that had been whipped with a pacojet (a $4,000 device, that you, too, can own in your home) ... divine.\n\nSeeing other reviews, I will say that we didn't find any over-seasoned or overly-acidic dishes.  And, at the end of the meal, we felt satiated.  The menu was a bit light on the meat proteins, but that suited me and my husband just fine.  The presentation of every dish (except my chicken) was exceedingly artful.  We didn't see repetitive use of ingredients or flavor profiles (except for the grassiness of the sauce with the tofu and the asparagus).\n\nI did find it a bit puzzling that they seemed to not know upon arrival that I didn't eat beets or red meat (which includes duck) when I'd returned their call earlier in the week asking for dietary restriction information.\n\nOutside of the initial dietary snafu, the service was outstanding.  We were told that there would be a film crew coming in to take a few shots (apparently having to do with the making of Chef Patterson's new Phaidon Press published cookbook (a first for an American chef)) and were asked whether that would be be a problem ... I said \"no, would you like to see my SAG card?\"  The maitre d' hesitated, laughed, then said \"I think I'll pull that one of the film crew ...\" as he walked away, \"you don't really have a SAG card??\" ... \"no\" ... smiles ....", "author": "Dana R."}

For the same price ($500 for 2 people) you can go to Manresa and get some of the most innovative food in the Bay Area or to Cyrus and receive some of the best service. Coi really has neither going for it.\n\nHere is my take on the details:\n\nFood -- the food here is hit or miss. Around 3 of the dishes in our 11 course tasting were great, others however ranged from tasty but not memorable to please take this away, finishing the micro-portion isn't even worth the calories. There was little diversity across the tasting either--4 courses were soups! \n\nService -- The staff while competent enough was a bit standoffish-holier -than-thou.  Yes, I know its SF...but still its a friggin 2 star. Nothing about the service really makes you feel special, again, for the price, there are other places that really make you feel like royalty or the night. Not here.\n\nAmbiance -- Fair. We sat in the lounge area which has a nicer feel then the monochrome dining room. But, as there is no bar people waiting for tables congregate in the lounge. By 8:00 there were a bunch of people standing behind our table waiting for us to finish (we were only on course 5). This did not make for a relaxing meal.\n\nOverall -- There is way better dining around. Again if you are willing to venture out of the city there is Manresa, Cyrus, French Laundry, etc. Even in the city, I think Aziza and Masa are examples of places that offer better food plus better setting and staff. Cheaper too...\n\nI know all you foodies will go to Coi just because its Coi and thats fine. If however its a special occasion splurge you may want to try another restaurant that will provide an experience that is a bit more memorable.", "author": "alana d."}

The ambiance has potential, but the lighting in the main dining room is too white and harsh, a little yellow light could help warm the sleepy earth and grey tones. \n\nFood was generally good (though why are they still foaming their soups?) and on par with many of the middle-to-upper tier restaurants in the city. That said, the cost is simply outrageous. I'm not overly price sensitive, but they are asking you to pay Gary Danko prices without being Gary Danko. Dining at Coi requires you select between either a $75 prix fixe dinner or a $105 tasting menu. Perhaps more annoying is the mandatory 18% gratuity, this is simply ludicrous. Do you really think I'm not going to tip? That is a direct affront to your customers, bad form and in bad taste.\n\nIf the restaurant offered ala carte, dropped prices by 50%, and redesigned their dining room it could be a thriving SF staple. Will that happen? I'm not holding my breath.", "author": "Jeremy S."}

We sat in the soothing private dining room and had a grand time.\r\n\r\nDaniel Patterson's cooking seeks to challenge as well as to seduce. As a result dining at Coi is an artful experience - sophisticated and yes, not always easy; for that I'm grateful. How exciting that San Francisco has a dining room of this caliber to finally lay claim to.\r\n\r\nMenu and commentary below.\r\n\r\nPINK GRAPEFRUIT ginger, tarragon, black pepper - \r\nsalty and fragrant, a pale orb of foam concealed pink grapefruit floating in a tarragon infused syrup. This dish was interestingly presented with a dab of fragrance along side with which we were encouraged to anoint our wrists with. Nothing like a little dining room theater to go with the amuse course...\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA OSETRA CAVIAR sauteed bone marrow, beet gelee - \r\nAbsolutely delicious, a voluptuous and decadent combination. The bone marrow in this dish proving a rich and surprising companion for the caviar.\r\n\r\nSEA BREAM SASHIMI white soy, yuzu, chives -\r\nThis was perfectly balanced, the yuzu and white soy serving to frame the fish without overwhelming it. An excellent example of just how difficult it is to execute true simplicity well.\r\n\r\nSOFT COOKED EGG YOLK spicy onion relish, bacon,Parmesan foam - \r\nThis dish elicited moans of delight from the entire table. So good I was tempted to lick the eggshell (that it was presented in) clean.\r\n\r\nDELICATA SQUASH SOUP walnut brittle, cippollini onions,\r\ncocoa mascarpone - \r\nThis soup was full of whimsy, the cocoa mascarpone adding an exotic and savory element, and the onions a delightful sweetness. If anything, the brittle was a little bulky in it's granularity in proportion to the soup, but it's bitter sweetness and crunch was a playful surprise.\r\n\r\nYUBA 'PAPARDELLE' coconut milk, curry spices -\r\nSilky and squeaky. This dish felt a little flat to me this evening, perhaps even a little under seasoned, but the Yuba was perfectly cooked and made the two vegetarians we dined with very happy.\r\n\r\nSEARED SCALLOPS sunchokes, brown butter, caper berries - \r\nButter and sweet scallops, such a happy union. This dish was no exception, but it was perhaps the least inspired combination of the night.\r\n\r\nROASTED SQUAB endive, sauce of hibiscus, foie gras and vanilla -\r\nCooked sous vide and then finished in the oven, the squab was a triumph. The vanilla and foie combining with the bird to form something far more exulted than the sum of it's parts.\r\n\r\nROLF BEELER GRUYERE TART wild arugula -\r\nwarm Gruyere melted over caramelized cippollini onions and served atop a pate brissee, this was a charming reinterpretation of a cheese course.\r\n\r\nHUCKLEBERRIES tapioca, maldon salt - A vivid spectrum of flavors contained in a soup-spoon. It tasted like the color purple and of eating fruit in the summer sea.\r\n\r\nWARM CHOCOLATE-BRIOCHE PUDDING lap-sang souchong,\r\npickled mango - \r\nI am not usually a fan of fruit and chocolate, preferring my cocoa to come unadorned. This dessert however dispelled my usual prejudice. A graceful marriage made of the fruit and fine dark chocolate, gently encouraged by the hint of lap-sang souchong tea.", "author": "Stellah D."}

Whether it was the frozen drink, the pea soup, the duck, or any of the other nine courses, each item was quintessentially simple and proud--like the Venus de Milo of food. It sounds almost anticlimactic, but our reaction to many dishes was to feel as if we'd never truly tasted a piece of asparagus, a beet, or whatever before. \n\nI've been to two other local Michelin-starred restaurants, Commis and Cyrus; compared to Commis, Coi's 12-course pre fix was more decadent (and priced thus), though it would take a trained pro to distinguish between the quality of the preparations. Cyrus, while equally symphonic in presentation, was more of the classical French style dishes with lots of butter and dense sauces. \n\nAs a final note, a small thing which a staff member did for us immediately upon arrival conveyed to us the commitment to a superlative guest experience at Coi: he asked us where we'd parked, and when we said right out front (but we needed a few more quarters for the meter). So he got quarters from the restaurant and went out and fed our meter himself, so we didn't even have to leave our table. \n\nThat's class.", "author": "Nate D."}

It shouldn't even be a 1 star.  \n\nFood:  Almost all the dishes had some citrus in it and acidic.  For multi-course, you'd want some variety.  The tastes were also too strong instead of subtle.  For one dish, it was so salty, we returned it.  Some were too sour and we ended with one bite.  I drank a lot of water.  The abalone and veal, the ingredients weren't fresh or they were overcooked, so there was no flavour.  The carrots were overcooked and were bending down like some noodle.  While the ingredients were entertaining and I give them kudos for trying something different, there wasn't a single dish that was amazing.  \n\nWine:  They need a new sommelier. The wine selection wasn't that great, and we ended up leaving the glass almost full.  Paring was off too.  For a delicate abalone, a stinky earthy red was paired and completely overpowered the food.  \n\nService:  They need some serious training.  We walked into the restaurant for our reservation, and there was noone there to greet us.  We waited and looked around for some sort of help.  When we asked ingredient questions, they couldn't asnwer them.  Given that these folks only serve 12 dishes/day and nothing else, you'd expect they know the ingredients.  The server also gave us a 1 liner of the wine when he poured it, but he wasn't a sommelier so he couldn't answer any question regarding the wine.  We had to ASK for the sommelier.  Food was served and retrieved from either side at the same time.  Perhaps they know their service isn't great, because we were unpleasantly surprised that the bill came with 18% gratuity already included and then taxed on that total.  \n\nAmbience:  This was the most decent part.  Entryway and into the dining is pleasant.  But, music was overpowering a bit as opposed to a nice background music.  I felt like our conversation was getting cut off by Norah Jones.\n\nFor $300pp and 2 star Michelin restaurant, I would have expected much better.  My neighbourhood restaurants, do much better.

You'll only love it if you have a passion and appreciation for food as an art form. Not the place for hub-like meat and potato folks--only die hard foodies need apply. Move over Picasso--these masterpieces are edible! \n\n4.5 stars cause of lowlights\n\nCost to worth it ratio: 2.7 stars (menu was fair: $110; wine pairings spendy: $95)\n\nHighlights:\n- Food style: artsy is the predominant word that comes to mind. Not hearty, not associated with a particular nationality or core ingredient, but deeply tied to art. Ultimate creativity was shown in the presentations and opposing somehow turned to balanced flavor combinations. The chef masterfully took several ingredients and up-leveled them into a greater whole, without anything outshining or being out of place with another. Besides that, high quality ingredients were key including the freshest herbs I've seen in their natural form. We may be used to basil and cilantro, but here cardamom sprigs and anise flowers were included.\n- Wine pairings: mostly white, as the food is on the lighter side, but diverse in countries of origin and types. It started with some sparkling pink with hibiscus tea in it, incorporated a peach beer in the middle, and ended with a mixed aperitif.\n- Menu: small portions within 11 courses: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=8BiiLs8vtt0LToWaEGmDYA. In order of preference:\n-- Tomatoes: caprese in a different form. Tomatoes in a glass filled with olive oil and a bit of basil accompanied by a mini flaky crusted soft cheese sandwich. Super sweet tomatoes, delicate olive oil, and decadent bread--a true elegant winner.\n-- Squash soup: room temperature--somehow simple and complex at the same time. Soup was light yet velvety enough to coated the spoon, squash slices were thin and pure, and subtle Indian spices filled the bowl. I'm amazed at how harmonious this dish was with all of the ingredients.\n-- Corn: like a rich corn soup made bread pudding style using brioche--my favorite bread. One of the more rich and tasty dishes.\n-- Gazpacho: deconstructed in the most beautiful way. I wish I had brought my camera to share this plate with you. The tomato base was spread out along the bottom in a square perimeter, a cucumber salad with almonds lay in the middle, and a black gel\u00e9 lined tube was the anchor filled with milled rice. Are you kidding me? Each part was great and together it was absolutely incredible.\n-- Grapefruit: grapefruit sorbet w grapefruit pieces encapsulated in a white foam layer. Very refreshing but I didn't taste the pepper, ginger, and tarragon as noted in the foam. Unique participation points for having a dollop of coi scented oil on the plate to rub on your skin and smell.\n-- Egg: runny but a thicker texture due to slow cooking. Popped open and mixed with the browned butter and Parmesan sauce was delightful for this egg-lover.\n-- Cod: ethereally light and tender. Beet color made the colorless fish pop.\n-- Melon soup: pretty setup in the center of the bowl before the liquid was poured on tableside. Elegant presentation and the white chocolate shavings surprisingly worked, adding just a touch of sweetness.\n-- Amuse: looked like a magnified dew drop. Once in your mouth you get a burst of milk and honey. Fine dining's version of the pop rock experience.\n-- Abalone: thin slices throughout mixed with seaweed but the highlight being the thin, wide, glass-like colored mushroom dashi noodles \n-- Milkshake: vanilla bean with a swirl of olive oil. Not too hard, not too runny and paired with a delightful warm soft cookie topped with a hidden salt crystal you only notice after you eat it.\n-- Cheese: wedge of mix of goat and sheep's milk counterbalanced by figs on top of a gorgeous set of balsamic reduction dots\n-- Sardine: not my thing, but I was impressed by the lack of fishiness\n\nLowlights (my flip side to highlights):\n- We opted to share the wine pairings due to the amount of courses and my friend not wanting more than a few sips. Even though I had read others yelpers did the same, our waiter seemed to scoff at this saying we wouldn't get 2 glasses and the pours were very minimal. I didn't appreciate the attitude to start off the evening. At a upscale place like this I expect the staff to make every attempt to accommodate their guests. They had us share one glass which I just placed in the middle of the table and we found the amount perfect for us.\n- Raviolo: although I appreciate the pasta skin being made from soy milk, I didn't care for the texture or the bitter spinach filling.\n- Cramped feel: not too bad, but relatively close tables where you overheard all conversations and low ceilings that made me feel like I was on the bottom level of a small boat.\n\nAn experience where artistry and beauty of food is paramount. I enjoyed it and am in awe of the chef's skills and imagination--I was thrilled when he came out to greet us.", "author": "Eve K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-21", "description": "The 11-course, $145 tasting menu is the only option available in the dining room (a la carte is available in the lounge). Interestingly, the menu is devoid of any of the usual suspects one might expect to find at a restaurant like this; lobster, foie gras, caviar, and truffles are nowhere to be seen. Instead, the restaurant's focus is largely on local and seasonal produce of the highest quality. Only 3 of our 12 dishes would contain any meat or fish.\n\nFROZEN MANDARIN SOUR - This first course was an apertif of sorts. A vodka mandarin gel was topped with satsuma ice. This was slightly salty and slightly tart; the citrus was definitely strong, and some kumquat/satsuma rind added a little bit of texture.\n\nOYSTERS UNDER GLASS - Two large oysters were placed underneath this \"glass,\" which was a yuzu flavored gelee.  The oyster was good, and the citrus (a classic accompaniment) was applied in the form of this gelee, which had a little bit of an almost al dente texture to it. Pretty interesting.\n\nPASTURE - Colorful presentation here. Beets roasted in hay? Hm, never heard that one before. The beets were mixed in with cheese, creating a slightly sweet, yet savory combination. The sprouts provided just a little bit of welcome texture for this interesting and enjoyable dish.\n\nCRAB MELT, CALIFORNIA STYLE - Next was this California style crab melt. Dungeness crab was placed on a thin, crispy piece of toast with some wheatgrass and pea shoots. The crab was tasty and worked well with the earthiness of the pea shoots and wheatgrass, while the toast added just a bit of crunch. However, we stumbled upon 5 pieces of crab shell within 2 of the portions - definitely a problem; this took away a lot from the enjoyment. Nevertheless, this was a delicious dish. \n\nSUPPLEMENTAL DISH - Because of the crab shell error, we were given an extra dish here. If you're ever indecisive about ordering soup or salad, this might be the dish for you. This was kind of a soup/salad combination - various vegetables were placed in a warm, soup-like vinaigrette. The waiter spoke at length about the quality of this olive oil and how it was the first pressed oil of the year. The bold, fruity flavors of the oil were apparent, and I enjoyed the variety of textures from the vegetables - fresh, clean flavors.\n\nFARM EGG - Next up was this dish highlighted by the slow-cooked farm egg. The yolk was beautifully runny and gushed out when broken. It was a tasty egg for sure, and I liked the mini croutons for their texture.\n\nEARTH AND SEA - The steamed tofu mousseline was topped with a delicious mushroom-dashi broth that screamed 'umami.' The tofu mousseline had ginger and lime overtones, and the custard-like consistency was nicely balanced by the pickled radish and slight chewiness of the yuba.  \n\nSAVORY CHANTERELLE PORRIDGE - Best dish of the night. This porridge took on a risotto-like consistency with the bold flavor of chanterelles. Absolutely delicious. The cress added a slightly herbaceous quality, while the crispy root vegetables added texture. Superb.\n\nPRATHER RANCH BEEF - This was the lone meat dish of the night. The beef was perfectly cooked, leaving it tender and rather flavorful for tenderloin. I enjoyed the potato puree accompaniment as well as some of the leafy greens; however, the vinaigrette was a little overbearing with the vinegar.\n\nSALAD - We substituted the cheese course for this simple salad. It was fine.\n\nLIME SHERBET - This was the first of two desserts. More of a palate cleanser, the lime sherbet was pretty good. I didn't need the tartness of the frozen yogurt as there was already enough with the lime.\n\nBREAD & CHOCOLATE - The chocolate had good chocolate flavor which paired well with the brioche ice cream and pistachio pudding. The pistachio crumbles were fantastic, adding some nuttiness and texture. The caramelized brioche, like sweet croutons, were another source of texture, and were very good on their own too.\n\nLastly we were presented with a few petits fours. Pinenut bread with chocolate and firethorn berry jellies were on offer this night. I thought the bread/chocolate combination was a little repetitive given the last course, but the jelly was very good. It had a very supple texture and a gingerish, tangerine-like flavor.\n\nCoi put together one of the most interesting and unique menus I've had in a while. It's sure to expand horizons and definitely give anyone something they've never had before.  For the most part, the dishes were pretty light and \"healthy\" feeling - I was waiting for something meaty, rich and filling for much of the meal. However, no one left hungry.", "author": "Darin L."}

You won't leave feeling heavy and stuffed.\n\nI especially loved their beet with rose water shavings...

Yes, you read that right, they want us to sip a beer like it was cognac or something.  It was the \"Duchesse de Bourgogne\" Flanders Red Ale.  A nice Belgian ale, to be sure, but not if you only get half a mouthful.

I'm a bit of a Michelin hound and I was very excited to dine at Coi as that would complete my set of 2 star restaurants in the Bay Area. I even went as far as to change a flight when I found that Coi were shutting down for a summer break on the original day of my arrival in San Francisco.\n\nCoi was the first restaurant on my week of fine dining in the Bay Area. I was honoured to have local Yelper Tammy C join me and she also brought along 2 of her friends.\n\nAs usual, I did arrive a bit early at the restaurant and decided to wander round the area to get a flavour of the surroundings. Well, I soon discovered that Broadway is the red light district and I beat a hasty retreat back to the restaurant. In fact, Tammy C's cab did try to drop her off in front of the strip club next door and she got him to move forward to Coi's front door!\n\nDaniel Patterson is reknowned for turning fresh produce into interesting and unique combinations in his nightly 11 course tasting menu, the only option.\n\nThe calm interior of the restaurant soon blocks out the garish neon outside and you soon feel cocooned in an atmosphere of salivatory excitement.\n\nService was efficient as plates came and went, each announced in the expected Michelin way.\n\nSo, as you can see, I've given Coi 4 stars when really, a 2 Michelin star place should score 5 stars. Why was this?\n\nI did enjoy the flavours and flavour combinations that the food imparted but I did find that the 11 courses were very similar. About halfway through the meal, I did start to worry slightly that the dishes seemed to be all carriers of flavour with little foundation. My palate was crying out for a bit of texture, some crunch, something to chew on as a contrast to the overload of flavour. Also, all the dishes were served cold or at room temperature.\n\nSadly, this pattern continued for all 11 courses. I so wanted to love the food at Coi but it felt all too much molecular with too little gastronomy. What I did eat was tasty but afterwards, I hankered for a burger with some onion rings - something hot to chew on and something crunchy.\n\nFor the record, the dishes were:\n1. Milk & Tea - sheep's milk ricotta, wild chamomile, lemon\n2. Geoduck clam, cucumber, almond, cilantro\n3. Earth & Sea - new harvest potatoes, fresh seaweed, McEvoy olive oil\n4. Chilled yellow squash soup, buttermilk, nasturtium, lime\n5. Morel porridge, Englsih pea, coyote mint\n6. Young carrots roasted in hay, sprouts, radish powder, pecorino\n7. Slow cooked farm egg, brown butter, buckwheat, shitake\n8. Cook It Raw - Prather Ranch beef tartare, Douglas fir\n9. Abbaye de Tamie cheese, spring greens\n10. White chocolate pudding, blueberries, lemon verbena\n11. Cake & Ice Cream - caramelised chocolate cake, raw milk ice cream\n\nMy favourite dish was probably the geoduck where I would have never guessed that it went so well with cucumber, almond and cilantro. The slow cooked duck egg was also interesting as it was cooked at 60 degrees - Tammy and I had a chance to eat other slow cooked eggs later that week, cooked at other temperatures!\n\nIt wasn't a bad start to the week; it just didn't hit the heights of other 2 Michelin star places I've been to. My advice would be to rethink some dishes - within an 11 course menu, there must be place for some hot, crunchy and more substantial dishes.\n\nP.S. Please check out Tammy C's review for photos of the food. She's much more conscientious about food photography than I!", "author": "Yee Gan O."}

Everything here is subtle.  There is nothing that will shock your tastebuds or senses... but much that will impress.  The first few amuses/ courses were witty and elliptical -- I liked the milk and honey gelee balls, topped alluringly with a tiny alyssium flower; the signature \"Pink Grapefruit\" sorbet served with an essential oil to dab on your wrist; I have to admit that the \"Shiny Beets\" didn't wow me, but the Miyagi Oyster under glass was the definite start of \"wow\" as the meal progressed.  Each course just kept getting better and better with flavours, textures and nuances becoming more and more sophisticated and complex.  This is a dinner that will make you think. \n\nThe 11-course tasting menu had 4 instances where one had to make a choice -- for the 7th course, for example, one could have either the sauteed Monterey Bay Abalone, or the Matsutake Mushroom grilled a la Plancha. Later we learned that we could have opted for both if we had wanted, making our degustation menu a 12 or even 13-course one.  As it turned out, right before our cheese course, one of our servers asked us if we were interested in an extra course or two.  Since we had both wanted to try the Matsutakes, we chose that dish, only to discover that we would not be charged for this \"extra\" at the end of the evening.  \"We wanted to make sure you didn't leave hungry,\" our server smilingly told us when we enquired.\n\nI've been, over the years, to Chez Panisse, The French Laundry, Fleur de Lys, Aqua, Manresa, Michael Mina... many exceptional restaurants in the Bay Area, and the service at Coi is possibly the best I've ever had.  The servers here are consummate professionals, sincere without being too earnest; warm without being too forward.  Every single person who brought our dishes knew exactly it components and could answer questions regarding a particular treatment (what was in that froth, for instance, or what were the spices in the broth...).  The sommelier in particular was wonderfully helpful -- though Danny usually opts for the wine pairing with tasting menus, both of us were feeling a bit under the weather that night.  We explained that we wanted her recommendation for a wine that would work well with many dishes and she chose for us a wonderful Gruner that was dry and crisp and mineral.\n\nHighlights among the courses: Abalone, the \"Crab Melt\" (served underneath a thin slice of lard), the Steamed Tofu Mouselline (served with seaweed and tofu skins), and the Prather Ranch Loin cooked in its own fat and served with bone marrow.\n\nWe are eager to return during another season.", "author": "Claudine C."}

It's definitely not in the best location -- right beside a big strip joint on North Beach. The exterior was inconspicuous, you'd drive through without noticing it was even there. But as soon as we entered, we felt like we were whisked away into the cozy world of Daniel Patterson. \n\nYou can sit at the lounge area where you can order items a la carte, but we wanted the full \"Coi\" experience so we went ahead with the 11-course menu. We even added an additional 2 courses (just in case the servings where the size of my pinky finger!). The tasting menu also included 2 amuse bouches.\n\nOf the 13 courses, only 1 was a meat dish, but we hardly noticed it (and we're meat lovers!). Daniel is a true California chef who celebrates local produce -- the ingredients were so fresh, it seemed like he just picked them out of a garden in Sonoma!  The menu changes daily, but the definite standouts were the staples like the pink grapefruit mousse and the slow cooked farm egg -- both of which showcased his technique and passion for the ingredients itself.  We also loved the \"Abstraction of Garden in Winter\" (it's a salad!), the parsley root garlic soup and the sauteed abalone.  \n\nI think the real testament to how good the food and service here is that by the time we stepped out of the restaurant, we were surprised to see that we just spent 3.5 hours there.  We came out $400 poorer, but the experience was worth every penny.", "author": "Dawne L."}

I don't say that lightly.\n\nSome of the reviews here make me writhe in my chair, spitting venom at my screen, deforming pixels.  Some of these people would get the Hope Diamond as a gift and complain about its \"odd shape.\"  Bad taste has no boundaries.\n\nHere's a hint to Yelp reviewers:  don't complain about a place being overpriced or a long series of courses when you know damned well in advance what the price is, and what the courses are.  The menu is in front of you.  Do you think the price is there for show?  Do you think the \"18% gratuity added\" is just for fun?  That the many courses are all going to be the size of Outback Steakhouse entrees?\n\n$##$#$@!\n\n*deep breath*\n\nHere's my objective take on Coi:\n\n1.  The menu is vegetable heavy, almost to an extreme\n\nAnd almost without fail, the vegetables are executed perfectly.  One of the true hallmarks of great cooking.\n\n2.  There's always a slow-cooked egg.  \n\nI had it before with some crispy chicken skin and loved it.  Last time it was presented more in a scrambled format and it wasn't so great; it was supposed to be in chicken jus but it seemed like egg whites purely in dashi.\n\n3.  The menu is incredibly flexible if you sit in the lounge\n\nHow many two-star places let you order a la carte from the tasting menu AND get a selection of a lower-cost lounge menu?  They are my favorite \"two-michelin-star noodle bar.\"\n\nThe little gems salad always blows me away.  It's like the Sistine Chapel of salads.  It's dressed to perfection, with perfect little croutons.\n\nThe suckling pig I had here once with the lentils and miso was, without a doubt, the best pork dish I've had anywhere.  And I have dreams about great pork.  Dirty dreams.\n\nThe inverted cherry tomato tart is something special.  \n\nOne of my very favorite beef dishes of all time, if not my absolute favorite, is the Prather Ranch beef cooked in its own fat.  My only complaint about Coi is they don't send Daniel Patterson to my house to personally cook this for me every night.\n\nI could go on and on.\n\nThe service is impeccable.\n\nYou can even hit up a strip club or two on your way out (kidding!  or not ...).\n\nI love Coi.", "author": "J W."}

But the food isn't nearly as good as they seem to think it is.\n\nThe first thing to know about Coi is that you are not in control here. The second you've been seated, it's time to succumb to the will of the chef. 11 small courses will be brought to you over the next three hours, and you will eat them. You may be tempted to skip lunch before dining here, because 11 courses sounds like a lot. However, the portions are small, and food is brought slowly. My advice: don't arrive too hungry.\n\nCoi's ambiance is bizarre. Walking through narrow, dark lounge feels like walking through a tunnel. As you arrive in the dining room, the thick walls and low ceiling make you feel as if you've emerged from this tunnel only to enter a cave. Now, this cave has expensive furniture, so you know it's supposed to be fancy. However it still feels like a cave. A few times during the night, I couldn't help but wonder if this is what dinner with Osama bin-Laden would feel like. \n\nThe food was all presented quite beautifully, which appears to be Coi's specialty. Unfortunately, for many of the courses I couldn't help but feel like the chef was putting lipstick on a pig--trying to make this food appear fancy. The most laughable course was \"Young Carrots Roasted in Hay\" -- I kid you not, it was three baby carrots on a plate. \n\nSome dishes were delicious: the oysters rockefeller had an exquisite mignonette sauce, and the slow egg was pretty fantastic. \n\nI also tried the beverage pairing. (Note that I did not say *wine* pairing) On the plus side, all of the beverages paired with respective courses very well. On the negative side, it was extremely overpriced, especially considering that more than half of the pairings were rather inexpensive types of drink: sherry, sake, muscato, hefeweizen, reisling, aloe vera and pale ale.\n\nNow, let's get to the price. Warning: it's scary. It was $600 for two people. Now, I knew Coi would be expensive, but I figured the experience and food would be better. Looking back among the 11 courses, we have: 3 dessert, 1 cheese, 5 vegetable, and 2 uncooked meat (raw oysters and steak tartare). That seems extremely off-balance in the direction of vegetables, some of which were pretty laughable (New Onions is an entire course?). And I was pretty disappointed that we weren't fed any cooked meat. \n\nStrangely, the restaurant automatically added 18% gratuity to the bill (our party was only 2 people). That's just plain tacky. My only guess is that otherwise people tend to skimp on the tip because the price of the meal is so outrageous and they feel ripped off. Rather than enforcing an 18% tip, maybe the restaurant should rethink its pricing.\n\nAll in all, it was a memorable meal. I'm glad I've been to Coi once. I'm not even slightly tempted to visit again.", "author": "Matt P."}

I have the longer review, complete with descriptions of each course and accompanying photos on my blog at www.hungryhungryhooker.org if you want more detail but in a nut shell it was very disappointing. \n\nThe menu is mostly vegetarian (three dishes out of maybe twelve included an animal protein) and with each new course that came out showcasing flavor profiles and ingredients  that bore a striking resemblance to the last dish.. and the one before that.... and the one before that., I felt more and more irritated about the price of the meal. Most of the food wasn't horrible, but there also wasn't anything really good and definitely nothing I'll be dreaming about late at night. Lots of root vegetables and citrus that often overpowered the dish with too much acidity. For $165 a person before booze (plus a mandatory 18% service charge) I expected it to be tasty and memorable and there are much better restaurants serving New American/California cuisine in the same price bracket in San Francisco (Atelier Crenn to name one). Even though the dishes included dairy, most of the meal really had the feel about it of a chef trying to make fancy food for vegans, and ya know what? If I had eaten this at Millenium and it had been $80 I would have felt it was decent foor for what it was meant to be (grass, roots, seeds and other rabbity food). Hey, at least it was healthy (except that I was still hungry and had to supplement dinner with a late night snack from Giant Burger).\n\nThe service was fine the second time I ate here, but the first time I felt it to be lackluster, awkward and worse yet, rude (again, more details about this on my blog) with poor communication between the staff. \n\nThe dining space is beautiful (modern, dark and sexy with a touch of woodsy ambiance, particularly the front room which feels a bit \"midsummer night's dreamy\" in a good way). That is about the only part of the experience I can really get excited about; I don't know about you, but I'd rather sit at a formica table on a folding metal chair eating something delcious off a styrofoam plate than sit in a gorgeously decorated room, unhappily pushing my food around on an expensive plate.\n\nThough hesitant, I may come try this place once more when the menu changes for Spring or Summer and see if the two nights I came were just horrendous flops, but I have an unfortunate inkling that this place has gone downhill, losing quite a bit of altitude permanently.

I have read some of the negative reviews of this place saying it is pretentious and snobby.  It might be true to some extent however this isn't sunday night dinner with mom.  The  food is spectacular and dishes always seasonal. \n\nFor me if i want to treat myself or someone special, A restaurant like Coi is a perfect fit for me.", "author": "Jason S."}

We were just amazed at how much work went into each of the tasting menu dishes: whisper-thin caper berry slices sitting on top of perfectly pink grass-fed veal. Absinthe encased in little clear sugar candies that pop in your mouth and release the potent liquid as you gently bite down. Exquisite cheeses wrapped in housemade fruit and veggie leathers. And housemade rolls that have the softest insides. LOVE!", "author": "Kat C."}

Loved everything about it from the food to the service to the ambiance. The food was very abstract and all very good. I don't eat lamb and they were nice enough to supplement that with veal which I really appreciated. However, I was not a big fan of the goat cheese but that's more so a personal preference. The entire dining experience took about 3.5 hours. We probably didn't leave the restaurant until close to midnight. The service was superb and they don't hover nor rush you at all during this experience which made it even more memorable.", "author": "John H."}

First I would like to start with the location. It shares a wall with the strip club, Centerfolds and is accross the street from another.  The place is very small with a very tired looking lounge with worn out throw pillows that may have been stylish at some point.  I know this sounds harsh, but when a meal costs more than $200 a head, this place should have it going on! \n\nI have been to many fine restaurants from SF to NY and have been much more satisfied. There were 11 courses, only one meat dish and two fish which were quite good. The rest were vegetarian and in most, the citrus and salty subset was overhwheming and I just felt like they tried to hard for what the dishes actually were.\n\nOverall, this place was HIGHLY overrated. With so many fine restaurants in San Francisco, I would definitely try somewhere else.", "author": "Felicia G."}

This review will rate Coi on the quality of the food, their service and overall value/satisfaction.\n\nFood - assuming Coi offers only a tasting menu, the 11 courses were prepared with very similar techniques with recurring ingredients.  8 out of 11 courses were preparing of fresh, young vegetable or root in custard or soup form.  A citrus/tangy undertone was consistent throughout all 11 courses, even in some that, in my opinion, do not go well with a citrus note like sorrel mushroom porridge.  Only not vegetarian items were the pork shoulder, abalone and small pieces of beef.  The presentation with little white flower also got old after the first three courses.  \n\nService - not horrible but definitely not like other 2-stars establishments I have been.  We arrived 5 minurtes earlier and we were told to \"hang around the bar area until table is ready\".  Can they say something like \"Would you like to make yourselves comfortable in the bar area and we will come get you once your table is set?\"\nAfter we were led to our table, the host and wait person were staring at me, crossing their arms.  It took me 10 seconds to figure out I should be pulling my own chair.\nWhen I asked our wait person to tell me more about the cheese course which consisted of a single slice of cheese, the answer was \"cow's milk\".\n\nOverall value - I do recognize Coi is here to make a profit but for 2-Michelin star rating and $135/person, I would expect more than 3 thin slivers of red abalone, 2 small pieces of pork belly and a few slices of beef.

There's a $7 prosecco and a pretty varied a la carte menu for mostly $10.  Honestly I think it's the chillest, coolest (small!) lounge for drinks after work or whenever.  Cool downtempo a la Moby and Thievery Corp. Lots of sunlight, minimalist cozy design, furry pillows.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-04", "description": "I was here quite some time ago but never got to finish the review... here goes. Random notes from dinner:\n\n- The small dining room has only nine tables that I could see (not including the tables in the lounge area). There was only one table for five people and we had it. Thus, reservations must be made well in advance.\n\n- Interior decor and food presentation was minimalist and elegant - very coy.\n\n- The service is calibrated to be an experience. Too often you will encounter snobbishness at this level, but not here. Our group was quite chatty and each time food arrived the servers patiently waited for us to notice them, finish our sentence and then apologized for interrupting.\n\n- We informed the staff of dietary restrictions (two of us were lactose intolerant) when making reservations, and after we sat the servers walked them through each of the substitutions. Some of them were better than the dish they were substituting!\n\n- Everything we ate was beautiful and delicious. Some highlights: \n\n\"Beet and Goat Cheese Tart (Broken, Inverted)\"\n\"Monterey Bay Abalone Grilled on the Plancha\"\n\"Savory Porcini Porridge\"\n\"Chicken/Egg\" (slow cooked egg + crispy chicken skin)\n\"Caramelized White Chocolate Parfait, Semi-Frozen\"\n\nIt's interesting to read the reviews and see mostly 4 and 5 star reviews and a handful of diners who weren't impressed or thought it was too expensive. Well, cheap it ain't, but there is some truly amazing culinary art going on here. Coi won't satisfy everybody, but try going in with an open mind and hopefully you'll be pleasantly surprised.", "author": "Andrew L."}

I consider myself a foodie and look forward to opportunities like this quite a bit.  And though my wife and I had a really wonderful time with two of our favorite dinner companions at Coi, that good time was much more related to our conversation than the food or the entire dinner.\n\nAt over $200 per person (and note, we brought our own wine!) there were three dishes, out of eleven, that earned a unanimous \"this is absolutely delicious\" from our table: warm morrel mushrooms prepared simply in butter to perfection; a dish of geoduck served beautifully with almond; and a tiny, salty chocolate cake at the end.  \n\nI actually couldn't finish one small dish:  carrots roasted in hay.  These poor little carrots were cooked until they had no taste left and maybe I do too much dog walking these days, but the obvious analogy to the size, shape, and remnant texture was just too, um, strong.\n\nDo you know how many time zones there were in the former Soviet Union, at its height?  One, two, three... ELEVEN.  That's how many courses you have here if you eat in the dining room.  We are a pretty normal group of four people, but we were all kind of dreading the last two courses.  We felt stuffed and two of us needed to get home to relieve a baby-sitter.\n\nAnd the final summary for me is that they were batting three for eleven last night.  That might start in the Giants lineup, but for less than 30% of the meal to hit their price point?  A fundamental problem is the confusion of weird with good.  We all love new tastes and preparations, but above all, we love things that taste amazing.  I advise the curious to spend 1/4 the money at RANGE in the Mission, where they have a much better per-dish average and an elevated slugging percentage.\n\nLoved seeing our friends and spending time with them, but we felt  a little shook down by the end of the night.

Coi is using as many fresh, seasonal, local ingredients as possible and it was very interesting to hear about all the details about the dishes.\n\nThe 11-dish menu has been covered in reviews since October, so I will not go into details of that. Our highlights were\n- Chelsea Gem Oyster on Ice\n- Monterey Bau Abalone grilled on the Plancha\n- Farm Egg\n- Prather Ranch Beef\n\nWe also had the wine pairing, which was good, but not exceptional. The Domaine Skouras Moscofilero (Greece 2009) with the Chilled Fennel Consomme should have been a Gruner Veltreiner (they had ran out of it), and the Delarche Boutieres Pernand Vergelesses (France 2008) - a Pinot Noir - did not go very well with the Pan Grilled Matsusake (something white a crispy, instead, maybe?).\n\nHowever, some things happened that I would not have expected in a Michelin Star restaurant (and would normally not be as picky about)\n- We ordered (good) champagne to get started, but the 1st dish with the wine pairing was brought to the table before that\n- knives and forks left in \"V\" position, but dish was taken away\n- my wife is very allergic, so they basically shifted some dishes (or minor changes)- but kept the same wine pairings that we had (planned for other dishes)\n\nAll in all, it was a very nice evening and as a proof of that we spent almost 5 hours (!) there.

Within 15 minutes he was pinging me that we MUST have dinner here one evening at the upcoming conference we'd be attending.  He promptly phoned and made reservations around our schedules.\n\nOnce we arrived, we were promptly seated and introduced to the staff for the evening who were pleasant and accommodating.  When I mentioned that I have an aversion to cheeze, she spoke wth the Chief who said that would be no problem.\nThe interiors of Coi are a softening warm mix of woods, mood soft lighting and contrasting colors designed to emphasize and accentuate - well done.  The dining area has just a few tables which were filled as the evening progressed.  The exterior wall has a small horizontal slit window which baths the area in the setting sunlight without being too bright.   \n\nFor dining the 11 tasting course is the reason we were here but we omitted the wine parings.  Once the meal started, we were taken on quite a journey for the evening with a blend of textures, flavors, hot/cold, sweet/sour which on summary was the most varied menu I have ever experienced - being in the 99% that is...  \n\nHere's a brief rundown of the menu we had: \n\n1) Earth and Sea - Tofu coagulated with ocean water, tomato and fresh seaweeds - Nicely done as an opener for the evening \n \n2) Live Spot Prawn - Cucumber, watermelon and lemon flavors - tasty. \n\n3) Carrots Roasted in Coffee Beans - mandarin, new onion and roman mint - tasty. \n\n4) Chilled Spiced Ratatouille Soup - oregano and cliantro - one of my favorites of the evening - a blend of colors and creaminess that's hard to top. \n\n5) Celtuce - burnt hay, new harvest potatoes, comte - hmm burnt hay I though oh my but it was tasty\n\n6) Monterey Bay Abalone Grilled on the Plancha - nettle-dandelion salsa verde, spicey breadcrumbs - Again awesome! \n\n7) Emigh Ranch Lamb - chard leaves and stems, garum, rosemary - This one I did not care for because I am not a fan of very rare meats.   It was good, just not my favorite.   \n\n8) Grapefruit Sorbet - wow, not sure how this was prepared but it was wonderful combination of a foamy exterior and cold solid interior without being too tart and biting. \n\n9) Frozen Lime Marshmallow - coal toasted meringue  - wow.  I never dreamed a marshmallow could taste THIS good!   \n\n10) Peaches and Cream - nasturtium - nice, simple dish.   \n \n11) Silken White Chocolate - kiwi, coffee - splendid blend with the kiwi's tangy edge and this translucent wafer of white chocolate - wow! \n\n12) Candied Raspberries  - cleared the palate and topped off the evening. \n\nOverall, visiting Coi is about experiencing unique combinations of flavors, textures and even colors which one likely has not likely encountered.  The Chief's creativity is the master ingredient which coagulates these dishes into a meal worth  remembering.  The only detriment I will give Coi is the price.  So if I could rate it 4.5 stars I would but in this case I must round up rather than down for a 3 hour food adventure!  \n\nIf you are venturing to Coi expecting the bill to be less than $200 / person - don't go.  If you are venturing to Coi expecting something other than the unique experiences as I and others have described - look elsewhere.  If you are seeking out Coi to enjoy a meal which is uniquely assembled, executed and delivered by exceptional staff then this is the place on your must do list in San Fran.  I walked away not feeling stuffed after 11 courses but satisfied that I had just had the best meal of my life and not because it was exorbitantly expensive - but because it was that good.

With a chef as talented as Daniel Patterson, I'm not understanding the one-star ratings. However, that said, I'm writing this review after just having eaten at Benu two nights ago, so in comparison, Coi falls in its shadow. Had I written this review last year right after our dining experience at Coi, I might have rated it higher.\n\nCoi is one of those restaurants that you either get, or don't get. It's unique, interesting, and sometimes downright strange. The people I've talked to that have eaten here either love it or hate it. While I enjoyed our meal, I can't say that I absolutely loved it. But, I definitely appreciated it. The meal was a balance of common + uncommon ingredients prepared in surprising methods, yielding flavors that I'd never experienced. For that, I appreciated the journey that Patterson took us through during our dinner.\n\nThe items I especially enjoyed:\n- Broken beet/goat cheese tart, rye, dill (sweetness of the beet plus savory goat cheese and crunchy rye topping were perfection together)\n- Monterey bay abalone grilled on the plancha, nettle dandelion salsa verde, spicy breadcrumbs, lemon zest\n- Savory porcini porridge, bone marrow, garlic confit, wood sorrel (my favorite dish of the tasting, everything blended together nicely)\n\nThe items that I didn't particularly love, but I appreciated the interesting flavors/preparations:\n- Oysters under glass, Marin miyagi oysters, Yu zu, rau ram\n- Sunchoke-buttermilk soup, hot/cold, Asian pear, cocoa nib, mint\n\nThe items I 'didn't get':\n- Frozen mandarin sour, satsuma ice, angostura bitters (was this a palette cleanser to start the meal?)\n- Young carrots roasted in hay, sprouts\n\nIn sum, definitely worth a try, but keep an open mind through the experience and you'll enjoy it more.", "author": "Kel S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-05", "description": "Since leaving San Francisco no review has loomed over me more than the one I have to do for Coi. I have been debating for weeks now what score to actually give the place, because I know it should be a 5 star restaurant, the problem is they don't live up to that potential in any way, at least as far as I'm concerned. Finally, I decided to go with how I truly felt as I left the place, the one restaurant I was most excited to visit on my week long trip there, a 2 Michelin star restaurant that is inventive, playful, and skilled, but which somehow left me with the biggest sense of disappointment and wteffery that I have experienced from a restaurant in perhaps as long as I can remember. Where the hell is all the protein?\n\nI need to take a brief moment before going into the food to talk about the service, because that was just as memorable, if not more, in a very bad way. Our waitress was completely dull, lifeless, and somewhat robotic. She never once engaged us other than to give a brief description of the food, and she talked down to us through most of the night. It honestly felt like we were on some kind of interview, and it was not going well. This is a shame, because I absolutely loved the setting of the restaurant, which was probably my favorite aspect of the entire night. They also include 18% tip regardless of your party size here, which is good for her, but bad for the customers, as they have zero incentive to have a personality. Now, on to the food, which is done as a single tasting menu for the entire table(NOTE: please look at my pictures for full course descriptions):\n\nAmuse Bouche: caramelized pear and root beer - This was a nice start to the meal, it got me going with a solid combination of flavors and texture, and I was really looking forward to what would be coming for the rest of the night.\n#1: frozen mandarin sour - Just ok, an interesting play texturally, but considering all the elements involved I really expected a lot more flavor out of this, and basically all I got was the bitter part.\n#2: geoduck clam - I was pretty stoked to try this, as I had never had geoduck, but I had seen it used many times on TV and always wondered how it would taste. The flavor is intense shellfish, but in a very primal way, and the yuzu does an excellent job of bringing it alive. It was one of my favorite courses of the night, and I really loved the combination of the clam w/ the bean sprouts.\n#3: beet and goat cheese tart - What is it about beets that makes them so damn popular at fine dining establishments? Personally, I've never cared for the flavor, regardless of what chefs do to them, although I must be honest and admit this was one of the better versions, which I'm sure had something to do with my fondness for goat cheese.\n#4: sunchoke-buttermilk soup - They present you with a hot version of the ingredients together, and then pour the cold version over the top. I wish they had just given me one or the other, as the mixing of the two really is not very pleasant, no matter how creative it's trying to be.\n#5: \"fall, pastoral\" - A total waste of a dish in my opinion. There are so many better ways to represent fall in California than a few sad looking carrots. This dish pretty much exemplified my feelings of the night.\n#6: Monterey bay abalone - As most of the other reviewers have agreed, this is the best dish of the night. The abalone is prepared beautifully, and the flavors just sing. The citrus pops, and the crunch is a delightful surprise. More of this, and the night would have been hard to beat.\n#7: savory chanterelle porridge - When I tasted this dish I had the feeling I should be out hunting something. It has this overall feeling of woodsy-ness to it that is really hard to capture in words. Texturally, it was a bit of a mess, with just a little too much going on.\n#8: \"chicken/egg\" - This was interesting, neither great nor awful, but in some flux between, depending on which bite you take. For some reason I was hoping for some actual chicken in this dish, but alas it failed to appear.\n#9: tomme d'ossau cheese - About as boring and devoid of any distinct characteristics as cheese goes, especially for something supposedly aged 10 months, and the joke of a salad beside it was equally as pointless.\n#10: steamed kobocha squash cake - I'm not sure why this is called a cake, as it was much more similar to a mousse. This was another one of those dishes that was ok, with decent flavor, but nothing to blow you away.\n#11: caramelized white chocolate parfait - This dessert was fabulous, and really the only one that was necessary. The textures and flavors of this dish were exactly what I would want from a dessert, a little cold, and a little crunchy, lots of sweet and some sour.\n\nThe bread w/ the sea salt was pretty good and they gave us a few homemade mint chocolate cookies with the bill, but aside from that did very little to stand out outside the menu like other Michelin quality restaurants do.", "author": "Justin C."}

It was one of the best restaurants I've been to.\n\n The reviews for Coi seem to be very polarized and I think a lot of the negative reviews went into Coi with wrong expectations. So to be clear. Coi is very expensive. The portion sizes are very small. The tasting menu is about 11 dishes, so dining is a long experience, i.e. around 3 hours. Don't go to Coi with the expectation of comparing it to most other restaurants. It's gastronomy and a tasting menu so expect that. The only other restaurant I've been to like this is Tetzu in Sydney which was equally as good as Coi. Coi is more about the experience and very different, new flavors and dishes, more an experiment / art show nearly as far as food goes.\n\nSo if the above sounds good to you, then you will love Coi.

This in itself isn't that bad, except that when a good dish comes, you are left wanting more of it.\n\nThe 11 courses were split up into 9 appetizers and mains, and 2 desserts.  Of the 9 courses, we were all shocked that only 1 was meat, 1 was seafood and the rest were vegetarian.  At the end of the meal, we would have all left hungry if it wasn't for the 3 bread rolls we each ate.\n\nI compare this to other Michelin star restaurants I've eaten at, and the food pales in comparison.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the wait staff -- service was impeccable.  they were attentive, friendly and came at all the right times.\n\nUnfortunately, fantastic customer service cannot save a restaurant where you come expecting an incredible meal.", "author": "Trevin C."}

After all,  I rationalized to myself, my palette, as a self professed \"supertaster\", is infinitely more discriminating than the barbarian hordes that post on Yelp.   How wrong I was.  Regrettably, my experience confirms recent 2 and 3 star reviews point for point.\n\nApparently there may be a back story to all of the bad reviews Coi has earned of late.   The kitchen has acquired new staff - it is in some kind of transition - at least according to a reporter in the Chronicle.\n\nOnly 3 out of the 11 courses were Michelin-worthy.  I am in complete agreement with recent revewers:  the goat cheese tart was satisfyingly complex (the flavor and texture evolved over time); the sunchoke-buttermilk soup was soothing and rich; and the grilled abalone was punchy and flavorful.  All other courses; however, could be rather generously classified as \"intellectually interesting\", pretentious, and emotionally hollow.   If I were to summarize:  the meal lacked soul.  \n\nCost control seemed to rule the thinking behind this particular menu.  \n\nOnly 2 out of the 11 courses incorporated any protein - unless you include the rather one-dimmensional chicken/egg savory finale with its \"crumble\" of chicken skin conservatively sprinkled over a slow cooked egg.   \n\nOne course consisted of two small slices of matsutake mushroom with a watery potato-pine puree.  Apparently, just demonstrating that one can prepare this difficult to master ingredient is enough to warrant putting it on the table.  Another low point was the \"fall pastoral\" which consisted of young carrots resting in a base of hay and sprouts.  And, you know what ?  It tasted *exactly* like carrots resting in hay with sprouts.  This is what I pay big bucks for.\n\nQuite a few reviewers were lavishing praise on Coi's deserts.  By the end of the savory phase,  I was desperately looking forward to ending the meal on a high point - to recover my prior losses, so to speak.\n\nUnfortunately, this did not happen. The deconstructed squash cake had a nice complexity, particularly as my now flavor-starved mouth, crunched down on the occaisional pomegranate seed.  But the Faux-Souffle offered up few rewards other than its base of average chocolate, capped with a dry, foamy, flavorless, fluff.\n\nI must say that the service was excellent.    The ambiance is subdued, comfortable, and keeps your attention where it should be: on the food.\n\nThe problem lies in the kitchen.  It takes ego and hubris to put out a meal like this.  It is extremely cynical to charge so much ($550 for two with wine pairing), and yet offer up so little in return.   On the night I was there, I noted that the chef served foie gras and sweetbreads to the table on my immediate right.  This table featured a restaurateur who ordered from the same fixed menu I did.  I realize this is simply professional courtesy on the part of the chef (apparently a typical gesture), but it perhaps explains the great reviews in the press and in the various food guides.   The chef apparently makes an effort when it is in his direct interest to do so.\n\nThe rest of us, however, have to remain contented with hay, sprouts, baby carrots, and slow-cooked eggs.  \n\nI left the restaurant feeling angry and guilty for letting myself be influenced by the hype.", "author": "Craig H."}

COI is in complete contrast to the glitzy, flashy strip clubs that surround it. The  restaurant is a very simple yet elegant decor (not feeling the shaggy pillows however). \n\nWe sat in the small intimate main dining room that only had about 8 tables. The service was fantastic. Very attentive staff and I absolutely loved the Sommelier. Not only did he recommend a wonderful bottle of RICHTER Riseling 'Brauneberger Juffer' Spatlese from Mosel, Germany but he had a great sense of humor and was very entertaining. One of the servers was also extremely attractive which gave me something nice to look at in the transition period between courses. \n\nThe 11 course meal had some standouts and some so-so not too impressive offerings. My absolute favorites were the cauliflower in the  bone marrow foam and the parfait. I was not very impressed with the carrots, abalone or the beets (mainly because beets taste like dirt to me).

Important thing to mention is that, each dish is served in bit size so flavor is not continuous and bold, as if you were having a full entree. \n\n11 course dinner in appx. 3 hours isn't impossible. If you been to the east coast then you can enjoy nearly 30 courses in 7 hours. Priced at $120+ (excl. drinks), it's an experience for visual presentation and gastronomy appreciation than anything else.\n\nChef uses seasonal and local ingredients so the menu is constantly changing. Some dishes also incorporate oil scent and flowers to amplify your senses before tasting,i.e, lavender oil on the back of palm. \n\nMy visit included some Asian ingredients as well as techniques, which others would've appreciated more.

However at the price point it's at, it's has to be on point all the time.\n\nA childhood friend from France was visiting my spouse for the first time in years and it was just the excuse we needed to try out a new hot culinary hot spot.\n\nWe wanted to eat in the dining room but since one of us doesn't eat food legged creatures and there are no substitutions to the tasting menu in the dining room so we ended up in the lounge area. In the end we were the only people in the lounge and so it was like we had our own dining room which was lovely since we planned on being there for a couple of hours.\n\nWe ended up order about half our meal off the dining menu and about half off the lounge menu. The server who was a total sweetheart warned us that the dishes off the dining menu would be tiny and he wasn't kidding. Most the plates were four bites at the most but they were tasty tasty bites.\n\nThe lounge menu was larger but the plates were still much smaller than most Americans would expect. I can understand why Europeans would appreciate this food more perhaps than many americans. The flavours are more subtle than at many restaurant including those at the same price point and culinary level.  Because the flavours are subtle, people could assume that it is a rather bland dish but we really enjoyed the complexity that did exist even if it was brash.\n\nWe ordered about 12 dishes for the three of us and we probably could have ordered a couple more but we wanted to save room for dessert. I had to try their version of an It's its, which is probably one of my favorite San Franciscan foods especially the mint ones. I have to say they did an excellent job mimicking  the taste but I still prefer the original. \n\nThis is not a place to go if you don't truly enjoy experimenting with your food and are willing to pay more than a 100 dollars a person.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

As a surprise, I was treated to dinner at the lounge and was extremely impressed by every single detail placed into the design of the restaurant, the service, and of course the cuisine. This is not a place to go for huge portions and great value. Dishes are small, yet executed with utmost creativity and precision, not to mention beautiful presentation on artisan ceramic dishware. Every single dish was unlike any other dish I've had. While everything was amazing, a few special standouts include the icy amuse (looks simple though filled with unique and complementing flavors), inverted cherry tomato tart, foie gras with toasted brioche, and the Soul Food Farm chicken. Desserts were just as amazing. \n\nMy dining companion and I stuck with wine by the glass, however, the wine list at Coi is impressive and well-curated. It is obvious that the wine director/sommelier placed very careful thought into the list. We even had an opportunity to peek into the surprisingly calm, controlled kitchen. The cooks were hard at work and Chef Patterson even shook our hands and thanked us for visiting. COI - I look forward to another wonderful meal in the near future.", "author": "Kadie C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-20", "description": "Probably my new favorite restaurant, but certainly not one I can afford often.  The food here is just really special.  Each ingredient plays such a distinct role, yet everything maintains perfect balance.  And they are not \"keeping it in the fairway\" either.  The courses are creative and sometime bold and your palate is kept on its toes, so to say.\n\nOf course, with this philosophy, at least one of the eleven courses - this is the standard and there are no choices - is bound to not strike your fancy.  At our table each person did not prefer a certain dish, mine being the one with grapefruit.  Then, someone did not like the carrot dish, and I thought it was fabulous.  The ten courses were worth it.\n\nMy favorites were probably the clams, the spring soup (you would never guess such flavors could come from this), and the crab melt.\n\nThe atmosphere was really nice - a modern but simple and comfortable feel with the right amount of lighting and not too much noise.  The service was impeccable all around.\n\nIf I had to recommend an area for improvement it would be the wine pairings.  For this type of meal I would have paid a bit more to step it up a notch, or perhaps they could also offer pairings for a portion of the dishes.  That might also go over better with some patrons who would like paired wine but not three glasses over the course of the meal.", "author": "Matt C."}

The chef serves a 11 course tasting menu featuring fresh local ingredients.\n\nThe Food:\n  The food here is definitely worthy of 2 stars. All of the dishes on the tasting menu were prepared artfully and absolutely delicious. My favorite was the tomato tart. It was a perfect balance of savory and sweet with a touch of tartness. There was once dish however that didn't really stand out, the chicken egg dish was nothing special in my opinion even though it was good. Other dishes were also fun to eat and different from ordinary fine dining dishes.\n\nThe Decor:\n  The place is small and cozy. The lighting is not too dim. it feels like a upscale Vegas bar. Very comfortable.\n\nThe Service:\n  The service is nothing different you would find in a typical fine dining estblishment. Very courteous and professional.\n\nThe Summary:\n  I love it here.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-14", "description": "Came into Coi with very high expectations after hearing the praise I'd heard about it from the people at Manresa. And I must report that I was disappointed. There were some extremely good dishes, and on the flip side some rather bad ones. Not only was I disappointed by the food, I was vastly underwhelmed by the service, and the pretentiousness that came with it. Do I care that it is in the middle of the strip clubs, no not at all. I came into Coi really hoping and wanting to like it, thinking of it as something new and exciting finally building upon Chez Pannisse. \n\nThe Food: One thing that Coi did very well was the Wine Pairing. The Sherry and Hefeweizen mixed pairing was quite a creative pairing with the \"Calcots\". Props to the Sommelier for that pairing. Another Smart pairing was the Tandem Chardonnay with the Beautifully made Savory Wild Mushroom Porridge. Those two dishes and pairing's were the only \"wow\" experiences I got at Coi. \nSomething that had never happened to me at a two Michelin star restaurant happened to me at Coi. I flat out hated a dish. The Young Carrots Roasted In Hay was revolting. It tasted like some half cooked baby food carrot puree cooked in grass.\n\nThe Service: The Service was as normal as I'd expect it at this level of a restaurant until the dishes started arriving. No explanation on how the dish was made or what its intricacies were, just the same description as on the menu and walk away. To add to insult, When I inquired about Daniel Patterson I was only told very snootly that \"Yes he is here every night\". No offer to meet the man behind it all or a tour of the kitchen. From the way David Kinch at Manresa spoke of Daniel I was very shocked and dissatisfied at Coi, and their front of house service.\n\nMaybe I came into Coi with too high of expectations. I'm not sure. I know of the complaints of hardly any meat on the menu, that honestly didn't bother me. It was just the miss of more than a few dishes and the pretentiousness of the place that killed it for me.

My fianc\u00e9 took me here for my birthday after he read about Ferran Adri\u00e0's experience there only weeks earlier.\n\n(For the record, we dined there on Saturday, November 5th.)\n\nPositives:\n* The decor is contemporary but warm and inviting. Very romantic. Comfortable seating and a great modern-styled use of old wood throughout.\n* The food itself was exquisite. There's obviously a great amount of skill and pride in culinary achievement, and their use of textures, complimentary flavors, color and presentation were all top-notch. Modern, scientific-minded approaches with enough nods to old-world cooking to stay well-rounded.\n* The wine pairings were excellent, and their pourings were very generous.\n* They gave me a neat little printed list of courses and accompanying wines in a custom envelope at the end of the meal at my request.\n* We were given an extra teensy bite of a sort-of cheesecake in honor of my birthday. They also poured a nice champagne in honor of our engagement.\n\nStandout courses included:\n* inverted tart of fromage blanc with fennel five ways\n* warm apple soup with squash\n* red beet \"rose\" with rose ice and yogurt\n* the dessert course of chocolate discs layered in a napolean (with a flavored cream and accompanying ice cream that I can't recall)\n* black olive & caraway bread. I raved about it and they gave me a half-dozen extra slices in a carry-home box at the end. Nice touch.\n\nNegatives:\n* Coi has neither its name or street address displayed on the outside of the building, making locating it in the dark a bit of a challenge.\n* We had an early seating, but the parking valet wasn't yet there. I had to send my partner inside to flag down a hostess to 1) find out if it was in-fact Coi, and 2) what to do with my car. Despite the fact that I parked my car in a place where it was actually left for the meal by the valet, we were still charged their standard fee. Now, I'm not gonna get upset over $8 and a tiny tip, but he didn't actually have to do anything with my car; he merely held my keys for me.\n* We were rushed through our meal, finishing the [10?] courses in barely two hours. This was after we had already had a pleasant discussion with the server about not being in a hurry, having plenty of time, and wanting to take it slow so I could enjoy the wine pairings and still drive home safely. Despite that, they would bring out the next course within 90 seconds of clearing our plates. Finally after the first two or three courses I had to merely taste the wine pairings and give back the rest, which I felt terribly ashamed about. I had three partially-drained wine pairings stacked in a neat little row at one point, and the server came to pour another. He noticed the row of glasses and almost looked disappointed as he took them away.\n* The service isn't consistent amongst the staff. Our primary server (Don) was very nice and pleasant, knowledgeable and charismatic. At the same time he knew to be a bit more formal and old-world-butler with the French tourists seated next to us. After him, though, the service dropped off a bit. At a restaurant of this caliber, no one should ever ask \"Are you still working on that?\" -- that's for Denny's or Bob's Big Boy. Also, one of the women on staff kept popping her head around the corner to glance at our table. What did she keep checking on, I wonder, and couldn't she have made her surveying a little more incognito?\n* The tasting menu on November 5th was very, very vegetarian-friendly. There were only two proteins that I can recall: A small medallion of beef in their main course and 2 petite oysters in an early course. Both plates were lovely, but as expected, both were very small. Where was the poultry or fowl, the fish or seafood?\n\n\nOVERALL: I can kinda overlook the whole vegetarian-friendly menu despite really craving more proteins, especially since my partner is a vegetarian and he was entranced by the meal. What they put in front of us was expertly made. However, they rushed us through the meal so fast that I couldn't drink the wine pairings that we, frankly, wasted our money on. There's no excuse, and I even told them we were in no hurry before the meal and during to no avail. Unacceptable.\n\nThe bill, for two people, came out to $600 with gratuity, which I normally wouldn't blink at for a top-end luxury restaurant. However, this one was regrettable; I would take it back and go elsewhere if I could. I didn't tell my partner about this because he was very proud of his research and his plan, and frankly, he should be proud. He did a wonderful thing taking me out for such an incredible meal.\n\nNext time, however, we'll go elsewhere.", "author": "Ben W."}

We don't take the selection of the restaurant lightly. After having read many great reviews and receiving recommendations from friends about this place, we reserved a dinner here with much confidence. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted warmly by the host and seated immediately. We opted for the wine pairing to ensure the best experience possible.  First off, I typically enjoy both red and white wine. We were served mostly whites; most of which were too tart or fruity for my palette. Now the food, there was not one dish that stood out for me as I was not able to finish any of them. To be honest, many of the dishes in our opinion, were overly seasoned and the geoduck had a very strong fishy flavor. To magnify our anticlimactic meal, the servers kept trying to take away our dishes when clearly my gfs were still working on their plates, i.e. still chewing their food when servers attempted to clear the table. I'm glad I had the opportunity to dine at Coi because I now can cancel this restaurant from my fomo (fear of missing out) list. Oh and the $300 pp after tax and tip didn't help the food go down any easier:/", "author": "Tee N."}

This way, you can order the prix fixe on a course-by-course basis and also order off a more substantial, cheaper lounge menu. \n\nThe best part about this meal was the service - the people who work here are simply incredible, zero pretension, totally down to earth, so helpful, and they know their shit. BEST SERVICE I'VE EVER HAD to date, hands down awesome. The waiter gave us his three fave courses from the prix-fixe (farm egg, and pasture, crab melt), we ordered these, plus the braised pork-belly entree, and the house made duck pate platter, all to be served in courses and to split - after two hours and three dessert courses (two of which were on the house!) - we were stuffed. \n\nFor the wine, the sommelier recommended something that wasn't even on the list!! - a 2001 super unique Rioja that was simply stunning, highlight of the meal. For this he charged us $40 (a little hook up perhaps!) - seriously the waiter(s) and sommelier were freaking incredible. \n\nSo why not 5-stars????? None of the courses were really stand out, they were all good, but none spectacular - we left feeling like we had an incredible dining experience, with fantastic wine, great service...but just ok food. Interesting certainly, well presented, absolutely, but the incredible, delectable tastes were no where to be found in any of it. \n\nWe did about as cheap a meal as possible in this place (if you want to do it right!) and spent $144.00 after tax and tip. Not insane, but still a very pricey endeavor in a city where $60 can get you epic meals for two at endless establishments here. \n\nAgain though, wonderful experience, fantastic wine, and unparalleled service!", "author": "Ben B."}

Coi recently called to inform that that they mistakenly accepted my reservation for a night they were actually going to be closed.  After hearing of my situation, they immediately volunteered to refund the gift card, make me a reservation at another restaurant (one that the chef himself thought to be a suitable replacement) and offered to pay for our entire meal at the other restaurant.

After taking a look at the menu for the night, I spotted a lot of things I didn't think I would want to eat.  Pine needle and potato puree?  Ick.  White chocolate and anise in the final dessert course?  Ewww.  Plus, our amuse was a house-made shot glass of root beer.  I hate root beer.  And then the waiter accidentally poured my friend's red Coi cocktail all over her. \n\nSo, how the hell does this place warrant 5 stars?  Everything was f'ing delicious, service was great, and I left satisfied but not stuffed.  Every flavor combination I questioned tasted wonderful once I ate it.  \n\nSnafus happen and they dealt with the spill really well.  The staff immediately cleaned everything up (including my friend), moved us to another table, took 10% off our final bill, and the manager personally came over to apologize and told my friend that the restaurant would pay for all the dry cleaning costs.  Another example of great service - Daniel Patterson himself helps serve two of the courses.  He was so shy, too.  When I told him how much I was enjoying his food, he seemed happy yet embarassed to be recognized.  \n\nA wackadoodle lady at a neighboring table was miffed that the waiter had removed her plate of food while she was outside for a 10 minute cancer stick break.  After she cried and whined about it, the waitress apologized profusely and offered to bring her out another plate of it.  WTF?  Maybe the service is a little too accomodating!\n\nYes, I can understand why this place can rub people the wrong way.  Don't come here if you are expecting the standard tasting menu, replete with the requisite luxury items (e.g. lobster and foie gras), where the progression of courses gets heavier and heavier until you are stuffed silly.  If you go into it thinking that you are going to get a really amazing meal with lots of interesting, delicious flavor and texture combinations AND leave the restaurant just the right amount of full, you will love it.

The design is subtle and engages your more intuitive and primitive senses.  You are allowed to wind down instead of feeling the need to wind up.  The entire team does their best to let you know you are in their hands now and you can just sit back.\nThe service is exactly what you would expect from a rest of this caliber however I must add that the servers are more natural unlike the stiffness of Benu and more precise than the dudes at Saison...they walk that fine line between very professional while not being to stiff or overly trying to seem to friendly.  Think Atelier Crenn.\n\nThe lighting is excellent and I really appreciated tho use of fabric throughout.  One is given the sense that all that matters is in that room and is not reminded of the world outside, at all.\nThe food.  I think I can say hands down that Daniel Patterson is the most intelligent, talented, experienced and current Chef in California.  You can skip Meadowood, Saison, Benu etc and just come here. Its almost like he has a special contract with the food he engages.  I tasted flavors that I have never before.  The beet with the sheep cheese is still influencing my mouth days later.\nMany mention the lack of animal protein in their reviews and yes indeed there are few animal proteins used/served however it is in service of you, the diner.  Anyone can take a fine cut of meat and cook it for you however very few can make a piece of broccoli or any other vegetable sing.  Seriously, that is the art.  If you stop and think about the real cost of real veggies, from farm to a table at Coi, its more expensive than a slab of cow...plus its better for you, for anyone in your life, the planet etc needless to say...its the way of food and he is one of the few that can make a vegetable tastes as good as he does.", "author": "Kate S."}

MELON AND CUCUMBER aroma of mint  was accompanied by a juice that was also salty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-01-11", "description": "Sometimes you fantasize about going to a particular restaurant (or... I do, at least...) for so long, that you start to wonder if it will ever be able to live up to the expectations you've built up. Coi was definitely that kind of place for me. Being a fan of chef Daniel Patterson's other establishments (and the fact that he is a self-taught chef, which is incredible), I had yet to go to the 2 Michelin Star mothership that is Coi. That changed on New Year's Eve, and the whole experience was near-perfect, with food that approached magic. \n\nThoughts:\n- The tasting menu ended up totaling around 15 dishes, which is more than the website says. I can't believe anyone would still be hungry after this (according to some of the reviews here), although it is deceptive. Around course 5/6, you definitely are still hungry and wondering if you're going to get full. But around course 10, it all hits you (including all of the wine), and you start to wonder if you'll be able to get out of there in one piece. I can put the food away too. It knocked my wife out (she couldn't finish the last few dishes), and I left with my pants feeling a bit tighter.\n- When you have that many dishes, it's going to take some time. Our whole experience was just under four hours. Loved that though. With food this intimate, it was great to be able to take the time to bond with the flavors on each dish.\n- The service was top-notch, yet warm and approachable. We had great interplay with our server (we asked him, jokingly, if we could get some of that abalone to go, and he responded \"sure!  that would be $400!\" haha), and you get the kind of multi-person service and attention that make it clear you're at a 2 Michelin Star restaurant. Daniel Patterson himself even brought out two of the dishes, which was a nice touch... and it left me a little star struck.\n- You will likely get drunk. We didn't do the wine parings, but we bought a bottle of wine there (SA Prum Riesling Kabinett, and excellent recommendation from the staff), and brought one of our own as well (they wave the corkage with the purchase of another bottle). Those, along with a glass of dessert wine, and complimentary champagne at the outset, we were flying pretty high at the end. Wine parings across the tasting menu would likely get you at least as buzzed.\n- The food tasted and looked incredible, and expressed a singular point of view. Highlights included the goosebump inducing \"Dungeness Crab\" - dungeness crab in it's own consomme, in brown butter crab broth, the Tart\" - an amazing, inverted fromage blanc (which was light & airy, so unique) tart with wheatgrass, fennel, chervil, \"Oyster\" - oysters with wild greens broth, asian pear, finger lime, \"Duck\" - aged duck breast with stuffed cabbage, roasted beets, horseradish, dill, duck giblet p\u00e2t\u00e9, and the \"Mandarin Sour\" - mandarin ice, frozen meringues, angostura bitters. All fantastic with some innovative techniques that served the function of enhancing the flavor and overall experience of the dish. \n- Even a dish like the \"Brassica/New Olive Oil,\" which wasn't my favorite, still had enough unique flavor going on that you were glad you tried it. \n\nI think the coolest touch was not getting the menu until the conclusion of the meal. Sure, the dishes were described to us when brought out to the table, but not having anything to reference while eating really realigns your expectations, and adds a unique mystery and sense of discovery to the meal. Even then, the menu you get at the end contains one word descriptions of each dish, heightening that even more. This really is at the core of what Coi is all about. \n\nA perfect welcome to 2012.", "author": "George C."}

We'd debated back and forth about it for weeks before finally going. Is it like \"kwa\" similar to the French word, \"quoi,\" or more like the fish, \"coy.\" Turns out that Suma was right all along and in fact you say \"kwa.\" Now that that's out of the way...\n\nCoi is really stylish right now. Their site explains that they attempt to create a Northern California menu with a sense of place. They use lots of local ingredients including the-fancy-restaurant-thing-of-the-moment, foraged foods.\n\nThis is fine dining without as much pretension as you might see at other places. Here there was no caviar and champagne carts, wild cocktails, ornate gold plated mirrors, soup poured at table from silver kettles, ponderous cheese trays and endless amuse bouche bites. Instead the d\u00e9cor is very restrained and elegantly simple: the walls are covered with a textured grass paper, the seats with a soothing uncomplicated fabric; the art is subdued with an emphasis on stacks of stones. There was no bar at all (Coi is not licensed for spirits). The colors are all sandy earth tones with splashes of dark. The tables had brilliant white cloths, gleaming silver flatware and sparkling stemware but the plates, bowls etc. were all stoneware, contributing to the casual grace. One of us said, \"It wasn't visually stimulating.\"\n\nThere were five of us the night that we went. We'd notified Coi of our pescatarian diets ahead, which they easily accommodated. The meal was eleven courses. Yes, eleven. One Open Table reviewer described Coi as \"a slow, luxurious dining experience.\" It certainly was that.

It wasn't quite as laid back as I was expecting, but it worked.  As far as I know, the lounge doesn't take reservations, but we didn't have any trouble getting a table.\n\nIn the lounge, you are able to order off of both the tasting menu and the lounge menu.  The portions on the lounge menu are a little larger and priced slightly higher.  For example, we ordered the Steak Bearnaise (sort of) off the tasting menu and it was a 3 oz portion of beef.  The slow-cooked Prather Ranch pork shoulder off the lounge menu was 5 oz.  The meats were expertly prepared.  The pork still had a pleasant chewy quality to it, not totally cooked to death like some falling-apart-slow-cooked meats.  The steak had delectable bits of marrow on top - all the more satisfying.\n\nMy favorite of the night were the abalone with asparagus and the foraged mushroom porridge.  I wished they had the slow cooked farm egg that seems to be a signature.  I know a lot of chefs have abivalent feelings towards signature dishes, but it's what keeps people coming back... and I probably won't come back.  Overall, nothing really jumped out at me from the menu.  There are nice touches here and there, homemade butter and fresh flowers in the ladies room, to name a few.\n\nThe service was great, I even earned a wink from our straight-laced server after asking about the unique tables.  But alas, if they're going to include an automatic service charge (like they do in Europe) than I'd rather them include it in the price (like they do in Europe).\n\nCoi is a unique experience and I would categorize it as 'hyperlocal'.

We had the following:\n\nSUMMER, FROZEN IN TIME \nfrozen meringues, yogurt, plum ice \n\n- I did not love because the description was \"perfect combination of sweet, salty and cold\" and honestly I only tasted salt and the portion size was more then I would think one would want to cleanse their pallet.\n \nCUCUMBER/MELON \nnew harvest potato, creme fraiche, california caviar, shiso \n\nINVERTED CHERRY TOMATO TART \nblack olive, basil\n\n CHILLED EGGPLANT SOUP \nfresh pole and shelling beans, preserved lemon, cilantro MONTEREY \n\nBAY ABALONE GRILLED ON THE PLANCHA \nnettle-dandelion salsa verde, spicy breadcrumbs, wild fennel flowers \n\nWILD BLACK COD SMOKED OVER BEET CHARCOAL \ncreamed leeks, beet-red flame grape sauce, dill, horseradish \n\nCHICKEN/EGG \npoached scrambled egg, grated radish, seaweed powder, chicken jus \n\nSLOW-ROASTED SONOMA COAST LAMB \nchard leaves and stems, garum, rosemary ANDANTINO (SOYOUNG SCANLAN)early summer greens \n\nPOACHED SUNCREST PEACH \nhoney-coriander sorbet, pound cake croutons CARAMELIZED WHITE \n\nCHOCOLATE CREAM \nraspberries, cocoa nib, sorrel\n\nEverything was bold, flavorful and on point. I do not fully understand why some have commented saying this was not filling? I was definitely at my limit around course #6. Also to appreciate what they are doing here you really should understand fine dining and what an 11 course meal entails. This was a slow meal and definitely an experience to remember. \n\nThe one thing I loved was really not needing to think or be concerned about the meal- no need to think of what to order and the service was wonderful as they anticipated our needs the entire night. \n\n11 course\n1 Kir royal \n1 Kiuchi Brewery Hitachino Nest 'White Ale' Japan \ncorkage\n18% gratuity automatically added on for the staff to share\ntotal $381.00\n\nI thought the price was very reasonable and on point for the experience, quality of food and wonderful service. Its not often that you find such a upscale, unique restaurant with such a warm and comfortable environment that has such a inviting staff.", "author": "Alexa V."}

I don't consider my palette to be refined but I just know when I like food that's yummy. With that being said, this place was pretty yummy. We ate here for boyfriend's birthday. He wanted a place that served foam, something on the molecular gastronomy tip so I Googled places in San Francisco that fit the criteria. I came across Coi. The website looked cool and there were lots of articles written on the cuisine. I read someone's blog post about how they had all these wonderful MG treats at Coi. I think that post was really old because it wasn't on the menu when my boyfriend and I ate there. \n\nThe food was good regardless. Everything tasted very fresh. We ordered a la carte from the lounge & dining room menu which you can only do in the lounge and not in the dining room. If you sit in the dining room, you must order the prix fixe. We were there in the beginning of July and to my recollection, consumed the following:\n-Grilled artisanal gruyere sandwich (greasy)\n-Udon noodles (delicious broth)\n-Soul Food Farms Chicken\n-Summer Frozen in Time (very refreshing, tasted like Summer indeed)\n-Inverted Cherry Tomato Tart\n-some kind of onion soup (way to salty for me)\n-dessert and a few other dishes which I don't remember the name of\n-2 kir royales, glass of wine, another cocktail\n\nOne of the best parts of the meal is the service. Everyone was dressed all snazzy in their suits. Our main server was very nice, he didn't make us feel intimidated or stupid because we didn't order the prix fixe!\n\nThe entire bill came out to around $230. We ate here early so parking wasn't bad.

There wasn't one thing I didn't love.. except the Chicken/Egg dish... which to me was just scrambled egg topped with furikake sitting on dashi/udon soup. I suppose something about that is novel for non-asians?\n\nI really do like how their wine pairings were from around the WORLD... not just from France or Napa. I was especially impressed that one of them was Japanese sake. Otherwise, nothing much I can say about the food that others haven't said before\n\nI did encounter a reservation problem though. I made reservations for dinner about a month in advance through opentable. Everything seemed ok, the receptionist called 2 days before the day of to confirm, and left a VM (\"calling to confirm 8/13 reserv at 6pm\"). The following day she calls to confirm my \"9:30pm\" reservation on 8/13! What the hell?\n\nI had to forward her my opentable reservation confirmation that stated 6pm, and she was still trying to get me to eat in the lounge area because the space in the dining room was unavailable. Yeah right. I even have the VM from her a day ago confirming the correct time! And she's trying to blame me for their screw up? F that. I told her NO, I am sitting in the dining room. I guess they had to scramble to figure something out, and in the end, they offered me a spot in the dining room at 6:30. I was very annoyed, to say the least. A restaurant of this caliber should not be making simple reservation mistakes. \n\nUltimately they sat us at 6pm even though we agreed to a 6:30pm slot (note: nobody was there! I don't even know why it was a problem to get our original 6pm reservation back), and they gave us the roomiest 2-person table in the dining room (corner spot). Plus, the food was exemplary, so the 5 stars, despite a slight slip up initially.", "author": "Mari K."}

THANK GOD NOT EVERYONE WAS A JERKOFF LIKE THE GUY WORKING THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT. (there was actually two guys working the front, one slightly bigger than the other. the jerkoff was the skinny guy)\n\nupon entering, i thought i might have made a mistake. the guy that greeted us had a huge stick up his ass. i thought, oh great, coi is one of those places. \n\nwe came early, i believe you should always be early. \n\nperhaps that was the grave error we committed. (insert sarcasm here)\n\nwe sat in their lounge area and of course, we ordered a few drinks. when the same guy returned with our drinks, he just plopped them on and walked away. i thought that was a bit off, but thought to myself, forget it, hes probably having a bad day, and even though anyone working at this level should never have an \"off day\", im pretty understanding of things. \n\nwhat i didnt realize till later, was that not only did he rudely plop our drinks on the table and not tell us what they were, but he spilled some of the my companions drink on her. in itself, its not a terrible thing. mistakes happen, but when you make a mistake, you should address it, especially when you spill something on a $1,800 dollar pair of shoes. he didnt even bring a napkin when he brought the drinks, let alone when the drink was spilled. we had to ask a server helping another table for one. \n\nwe both determined that the guy just does not belong at a place like this. at this level of service, these things are not acceptable, but we we not going to let that ruin our night. \n\nthis same guy never once came back to check up on us. 30 minutes later, 15 minutes after our reservation, i flagged him down and asked when our table will be ready. he said \"how about now?\"\n\nTHANK GOD the rest of the evening went off beautifully. \n\nthe meal itself was extraordinary.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-10-15", "description": "I had the sheer joy, pleasure and delight of experiencing Coi several weeks ago.  The choice of the word experiencing was deliberate.  Coi is so much more than dining, it is an experience.\n\nAfter reading several of the reviews here, I had to pause and think whether I built Coi up in my head or did I really enjoy it as much as I thought I did.  After some thought, I can enthusiastically say Yes, Coi is among the top restaurants in which I have dined.\n\nMany have detailed the different courses of the tasting menu - I will forgo that as the menu changes frequently and this will likely be out of date in a few weeks, if not sooner.  Instead, let me tell you why I had to disagree with some of the other reviewers.  \n\nFirst and foremost, Coi is the new measuring stick by which I will judge fine dining establishments.  My wife and I were having dinner at a restaurant considered to be fairly upscale in Boston (she was not with me at Coi) and the entire meal I found myself comparing to the quality of Coi.  I am so excited to bring her to San Francisco to share this with her.  For me, as a foodie, that tells me, this is the exactly the right spot for me to give a 5 star rating.  \n\nSecond, did every dish make me have an orgasm in my mouth? No.  In fact, some were not enjoyable for me but I can appreciate the inventiveness and creativity that the chef employs.  \n\nFinally, the ambiance of Coi was perfect.  Muted and understated.  A perfect place to bring a business associate/client, an intimate group of friends or a special significant other.  If you bring a first date here, you are a fool because you are trying too hard. \n\n2 points I want to make on others reviews.  Yes, it is expensive.  The tasting menu is published online @ 165/person.  If you have to factor that into your review, perhaps you should consider a restaurant where the prices more align with your budget.  Second, the portions are small.  That's the point of 12 courses.  I am a fairly big eater and found myself very content after the meal.", "author": "Tony S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-06", "description": "Like at Michael Mina, you can dine in the formal dining room or in the lounge at Coi. In the dining room, you have to get the 11-course tasting menu. The lounge has a separate menu but you can also order any of the tasting menu items a la carte. Personally, I like to be able to choose what I eat, so I went for the lounge. And compared to the stuffy dining room, the lounge had warmth and personality, complete with fuzzy throw pillows! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=2KYqIt3vgl9uFKK_Iun5hQ) The tables are carved from a single black walnut tree and each had a unique shape and size. It was like being in a ski lodge! \n\nWe ordered most of the items on the lounge menu and picked several from the tasting menu. I was impressed with the service. There was a minimal wait between dishes and they split most of them into two plates since my mom and I were sharing everything. I also loved the free sparkling water, warm bread, and soft butter :)\n\nThe SUGAR SNAP PEAS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=_-KlxhnpQmyxl8ed7B_Maw) were nicely seasoned and there was just a hint of horseradish. The chilled CUCUMBER SOUP (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=MoVo28b-O_1AmuEblObrpw) had a nice acidity to it and was very refreshing; the croutons also added a good crunch. The CALCOTS (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=WUVNkKvg3dDBqVNVC4ehZg) weren't that special, but what made the dish so spectacular were the squid ink bread crumbs seasoned with smoke and spice - I've never had anything like it! It was even better mixed with the creamy hazelnut puree. The MOREL RAVIOLI (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=AdZ3H_xxwOiHHSTFvcV33g) were also good. I barely noticed that these dishes were all vegetarian!\n\nUp to this point I've devoured everything that was put in front of me. The turning point was the greasy toast. ALL the toast is oiled with a very heavy hand. I would've like to eat the PIG'S HEAD TERRINE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=gW4BxqkbNvd7EoH3VrDKEg) with the accompanying toast but they were so oily I could only stomach one. The GRILLED CHEESE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=HgcC6vuAsB31H4u_sX4Qzg) would've been awesome if the bread wasn't so greasy. And I would've enjoyed the perfectly SLOW-COOKED FARM EGG dish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=DypSYdRkf9Up0v_jXaeRTQ) a lot more if it wasn't for the oily croutons. I was also disappointed with the UDON NOODLES (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=n43yT_WynXqNPJxJf9h1pQ), which looked and smelled a lot better than it tasted. I would've been better off getting the traditional stuff from a Japanese restaurant for half the price!\n\nI loved all the protein entrees though. The BEEF TARTARE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=_umyqmgQqnhbBm5onb8kIQ) was spectacular! It was different from any tartare I've ever had - very light and the Douglas fir tips added a pine-y aroma. The CHICKEN (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=ZGM6MCoD-GIoP0x3QuVNsw) was expertly cooked and the skin was so crispy. The breast portion was a little tough but the dark meat was amazing. The LAMB (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=Kj8UHDf83_-FLURNwg3LxA) was divine - so fresh and cooked to perfection.\n\nFor desserts we had the LIME CURD & MERINGUE (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=lZZqhiY7y1QrjN-2HunFnQ) and GOAT'S MILK ICE CREAM with tres leches cake (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/HG5cvtfUcpMojb2RyB2ZJQ?select=EuDxGDrz383_M8oIF4p4jQ). Both were so delicious! I especially loved the shiso meringue (wished there were more!) and how its sweetness balances the tartness of the lime curd. The goat's milk ice cream was very unique but not too \"goat-y\".\n\nPS. Coi is pronounced like \"qua\", not \"coi\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-03-16", "description": "Recommended to the boyfriend and I by a chef friend as a good spot for a nicer than usual birthday dinner, we ventured out to Coi's LOUNGE.  Amid the strip clubs and decrepitude of North Beach, we arrived at the dimly lit, suavely decorated lounge part of the restaurant and were seated at a great table close to the windows.\n\nPro: Lovely decor and beautiful tables made from lacquered cross sections of tree trunks, although I can't understand the practicality of faux fur pillows at an eatery.\n\nCon: Hostess and servers full of pretense.  Nothing against them, as I'm sure they're perfectly agreeable people outside of a job that tells them to treat customers like breakable heirlooms rather than people.\n\nAt this point, I should probably mention the fact that we are not Coi's target market.  We are a young couple who love good food, good drink, and trying new things, but ours is not the generation of social niceties and parti pris.  We arrived casually dressed, looking forward to good food and expecting to be made comfortable, unaware of the sky high pretension associated with Coi.\n\nWe knew that this was a restaurant known for its molecular gastronomy (ie. incredibly small \"tastings\"), so we ate a late lunch, which was essential to our not leaving hungry and cranky.  This is what we ordered to the best of my knowledge, since some of the menu has apparently changed since Saturday night:\n\nPork rillette with cornichon, grain mustard: Maybe rillette just isn't for me, but given the texture and the lack of flavor, I couldn't help feeling like a well fed house cat.  In its favor, the mustard and the cornichons were a nice balance to the pork, and this dish was only mildly salty.\n\nChicory salad with balsamic, black pepper: I hardly touched this one.  Chicory is a leafy vegetable not meant for salad, in my opinion.  I thought the price was a bit much for a small plate of bitter greens tossed in balsamic.\n\nAsparagus and nettle soup with edible flowers and ravioli: Can't find this one on the menu...I liked the presentation -- a soup plate arrived with three mini ravioli sprinkled with flowers, and a pitcher of the soup was poured over it before me.  Aesthetics are important, especially when you're paying out the ass.  This was a reasonably sized dish, for a change, and the ravioli had a sweet lemony taste that went well with the sharp citrus flavor of the flowers.  The soup was okay at best.  It reminded me of a Jerusalem artichoke soup I had somewhere else, only not as good and way too salty.\n\nSteak cubes with bone marrow jelly and cauliflower puree: Not on the menu either... I can't recall what cut the beef was, so I apologize if I'm mistaken (having been a vegetarian for four years, I'm not very good with identifying cuts of meat).  Two 1\" cubes of rare beef with a tubular blob of marrow jelly on top of the puree.  The meat was top quality, but too salty.  The marrow jelly was interesting, if not my favorite, and did compliment the beef.  The cauliflower puree, which we did not even see until most of the beef was gone, was incredibly salty, and tasted more like an undiluted vegetable consomme than anything else.\n\nBlood orange curd with Douglas Fir ice cream, black and red walnut crumble: My favorite dish of the evening.  I do have a sweet tooth, but above all, this dish was my favorite because of the nostalgia it created for me.  I grew up in a rural farm-filled area where the air smells like evergreens and there's a citrus-y smell in the summer.  This dish tasted like what home smells like, and I liked that.  The flavors went well together and the presentation was nice.  If not for my personal associations, I don't know if I'd love it as much, but all food is personal, isn't it?\n\nOne out of five isn't very good in my opinion, but I still would've given them three stars if it weren't for the atmosphere and this:\n\nThe couple seated next to us showed up with an SLR set up on a tripod.  After having just read the SF Weekly article about doting restaurateurs and finicky yelpers, I was curious as to how they would be treated differently, if at all.  I can't say for sure that I know how much they ordered compared to how much they received, but there seemed to be a disparaging difference.  I understand that not all diners are created equal in a restaurant's eyes, and perhaps he wasn't even a yelper, but I feel that the staff did very little to hide the fact that their dining experience was vastly more important than anyone else's that night, which only added to the feeling that we were not up to par as diners.\n\nCall it unrefined, Ghetto Gourmet, or what you will, but I would much rather have a great meal for the same price somewhere I can kick back, have a laugh, and not feel like someone might put me on time-out for enjoying myself too much.", "author": "Melissa T."}

It then took another 5 minutes before the menus could be delivered.  Then we enjoyed the most amazing 3 hour, 11+ course meal (with 10 pairings).\n\nCareful consideration and focus on an individual vegetable.  The first dish, a refreshing collection of frozen yogurt, meringue, and fruit sorbet.  Cucumbers and melon, with a side of cucumber soup and the scent of mint (nowhere to be found, just smelled).  Roasted cherry tomatoes under a tomato foam and olive crisp, on top pesto.  Perfect little potatoes with flowers and the teeniest bit of caviar.  Onion soup with slow poached egg and Parmesan foam, saffron croutons.  Spectacular thought goes into each dish, ingredients are peerless, and execution is top, top notch.  \n\nSome dishes were not my favorite.  Rice porridge with wheat-grass, seeds, and mushroom gelee.  (They called it risotto on the menu.  Big mistake, setting my expectations wrong.)  My first tasting of geoduck, which I can't fault the chef for; I just don't like it.  \n\nNot a single prestige dish or ingredient in the mix.  No truffles, foie gras, sweetbreads, etc.  Very little meat was served (just a cod dish and the clam with pork).  \n\nThree desserts.  One with berries.  The next, a salted chocolate bark on top of a marshmallow/foam, on top caramel, on top hazelnut ice cream, on top crushed hazelnuts.  A major hit.

If you can appreciate one-of-a-kind presentation (and unconventional taste), this place might be worth considering a look-see.\n\n\n\nWe went with the 11 course tasting and it was definitely unique and creative.  The dishes here are by far the most beautiful things I've eaten... a beet carved into a vibrant, red flower... presentations that I could have as mini-sculptures on display at my house.\n\nThe flavors, however, were too abstract for my tastes... and I believe that the best of the best combine beauty in presentation and in flavor to any given diner.  I'm not saying all dishes were not to my taste, but there were more misses than hits.\n\nI can admire this venue for its culinary daring and artful presentation, and can admit that my tastes may not be refined enough for the 11 course tasting, but the other aspects of the dining experience such as service, and ambience prevent me from rating this place higher.\n\nAn uncomfortable tone was set at the beginning of the meal when we declined drinks/ wine with our meal.  The waiter said, \"Oh,\" in a way that both my girlfriend and I found curious.  It was subtle and by no means blatant so one could argue if it was offensive or not, but I think of myself of having thick skin and it registered on my radar.  My gf, though, says straight-up that he's a snob.  Other interactions were brief and some seemed rushed.  Maybe we had the wrong server having a bad day.  This kind of service is something I wouldn't worry about normally, but I hold Michelin stars in high regard.  Again.... maybe a server having a bad day.\n\nThe ambience was average in my opinion.  Lots of silver and gray.\n\nOne could argue the price justifies the presentations and the thought and creativity.  There's no doubt that these are the most beautiful and detailed creations I've ever eaten and I guess that makes me feel kinda-OK about parting with my dollars here.", "author": "MICHAEL P."}

Our waiter was great - we told him our \"can't have's\" and he came up with a 6 course greatest hits for us.\nFreaking amazing food.\n6 courses, just enough to be comfortable full- walked out not crying!!\nAll white men working there - except one girl - and they were all humorless.\nAnnoying: only other table in the lounge was douchebags talking about \"a turd in the punchbowl\" while STARING REALLY HARD at one of us... Ahh, riffraff. Usually that is us being loud and boisterous!!\nCheese plate was just that - 3 small slices of cheese on a blank plate. We had to ask for training wheels.

So for his birthday, we'll be going wherever I want to go.\n\nThe dining room is beautiful. It's how I imagine my private jet will look.\n\nWe ordered the tasting menu, and the first course was awful. It tasted overwhelmingly like lavender. Neither my bf nor I finished it. When one of the waiters asked how we liked it, we were honest. And she replied in a condescending tone, \"Well, we'll see how the rest of the evening goes,\" implying that perhaps we didn't understand the concept. I'm not gonna say we're huge fans of molecular gastronomy, but we've been to Dufresne's WD-50 in NY and my man owns every El Bulli cookbook, so we got it. The first course just tasted bad. (Flowers don't taste good.)\n\nThe second course: I wish I'd taken a picture. It was one slice each of three different colored beets with an Indian spice mixture and oil. It was tasty and I don't really like beets. But it looked like a caricature of pretentious food: literally three quarter-sized slices of beets. Tasty, though.\n\nThe soup with lemongrass tofu at the bottom was the most flavorful tofu I've ever had and was awesome; the blood orange gelatin was also good. The fried chicken consomme, was like boullion-flavored jello in bread crumbs, not bad, but not as good as it sounded.\n\nI feel bad giving them only two stars. The servers were attentive and the food did get better after the first course. But it wasn't better than real food. We paid $460 for two tasting menus, my bf had the alcohol pairings and I had water. At that price, the food should have been impressive, not just over-manipulated. If we'd paid half that price I'd have given three stars.\n\nBut I wouldn't go back to a three star place, there are too many 4's and 5's.

I couldn't figure out what it was but it tasted very earthy, almost like dirt.  Therefore I feel that the misses were only misses to ME because that earthy/dirt flavor does not fit my palette.  My taste buds completely rejected it.  So take my review with a grain of salt because perhaps your taste buds will not reject whatever it was my body was rejecting.  The chef certainly must not have thought it tasted bad, otherwise he would not have served it!\n\nOverall:  Would I recommend it?  I think it is worth a try if you have a special occasion to celebrate and if you have the money to spend.  You certainly do feel special when you're there.  But it is not a place I would rave about to anyone.

Because I realized that I couldn't cancel my spot anymore, I just decided to go.  Glad I didn't pass it up! I did not get wine pairing that night because I was planning on studying more after dinner, but of course I had to take sips from my SO and order a few glasses for myself. With that said, all of the wine pairings went well together and defintely enhanced the flavors of all the dishes.\n\nAmuse-bouche: We started with a milk and honey bubble thing. It burst in your mouth and was extremely interesting.\n\nPink Grapefruit (Ginger, Tarragon, Black Pepper): I believe this was the course with a drop of essential oil to accentuate the taste of the grapefruit. I guess it wasn't that memorable because I don't really remember--other than the oil that I rubbed on my wrist.\n\nShiny Beets (Citrus Scented Gel, Vadouvan): I love beets and I made a beet-hater into a beet-lover that night (one of our dining partners did not like beets prior to this meal). The curry-like flavor of the Vadouvan was delicious with the beets. Loved it.\n\nInverted Andante Dairy Goat Cheese and Black Olive Tart (Chicories, Green Apple, Mint): I don't remember...\nYoung Artichokes Poached in New McEvoy Olive Oil (Fennel, Puntarelle, Rose Finn Apple Potato, Rangphur Line): I don't remember...again.\nOR\nParsley Root-Green Garlic Soup (Braised Snails, Padron Chile Flakes, Radish): I loved this so much. So fresh and light--I really didn't want to trade it off for the artichokes.\n\nAbstraction of Garden in Winter (Root Vegetables, Cocoa, Wild Greens and Herbs): Ohh, I loved this one. So fresh and light and the cocoa nibs really added to the flavor. Very delicious.\nOR\nCrab Melt, California Style (Dungeness Crab, Staffan's Lardo, Wheatgrass, Spouts): Lacked flavor. Not sure where the wheatgrass fit in.\n\nEarth and Sea (Steamed Tofu Mousseline, Yuba, Fresh Seaweeds, Mushroom Dashi): Glorified version of miso soup. Delicious, but not that inventive.\n\nNettle-Ricotta Cannelloni (Wild Mushrooms, Oxalis Flowers): Very interesting. I loved the presentation. Didn't WOW me.\nOR\nSauteed Monterey Bay Abalone (Escarole, Caper Berry-Fresh Konbu Vinaigrette): This was pretty good, too, but not memorable.\n\nSlow Cooked Farm Egg (Green Farro, Erbette Chard, Brown Butter-Parmesan Sauce): YUMMY YUMMY! Definitely a must. Very good.\nOR\nPastured Beef, Pure Form (Prather Ranch Loin Cooked in Its Fat, Marrow, Roasted Cauliflower): Very VERY good. The marrow was delicious and the loin was cooked to perfection.\n\nTwelve Month Cheddar (Soyoung Scalan) Rye Bread, Arrowhead Cabbage, Grain Mustard: Yummy! I can't remember too much of it either...but, I know it was good.\n\nBlood Orange Curd (Douglas Fir Ice Cream, Black and Red Walnut Crumble): I LOVED this dessert. This was the most memorable dish for me. The Douglas Fir ice cream i could've done without, but with the blood orange curd, it went well.\n\nChocolate-Mesquite Cake (Smoked Pepitas Praline, Squash Sherbet): I couldn't taste the mesquite flavor so much, but this was just ok. I definitely liked the blood orange better.\n\nOverall, I guess it wasn't a memorable meal to me. The company was fantastic, so that's what I enjoyed more. If I don't remember much of the flavors, textures, smells, and taste of the food, then I don't think it's worthy of so many stars.

I never heard of it before I read about it from one of my friends on Yelp.\n\nCoi (pronounced ... kwa) is a wonderful and intimate place to dine. It is one of those very special places where you are having a dining event rather than just a meal.\n\nWe went this weekend for our Friday night date night and we splurged on the tasting menu with wine pairings. \n\nChef Daniel Patterson and his very experienced staff presented us with course after course of delightful delicacies. Adding aromas and essential oils took our dining experience to a new level. We really liked  the creativity and tastes of each dish presented. \n\nEach of the 11 courses was paired beautifully with wine. The 2001 Reuscher-Haart Riesling with the chilled English pea soup and the 2002 Barberani Orvieto Classico paired with the farro-chard agnolotti were delicious. Some of the wines they chose I would not normally order so it was a nice education as well.\n\nKeith was our server and he was fantastic. 5 stars for Keith!

Each course is about 3 bites.  The food tended to be eclectic.  I felt like it tended to be a bit weird just for the sake of being weird.  Food was good but not great; certainly not worth the very high price tag.\n\nOne negative is that it takes forever to get through the meal.  We arrived at our 5:45 reservation and didn't think there would be any challenge making an 8pm show that was nearby.  We were only about 5 courses in and it was 7:30, so the last few courses were rushed.  Staff was a bit pretentious and uptight, you would have thought we had threatened the server's first born when we said we had to get out of there in 20 minutes.  The dessert was the best course.  One very annoying thing is that they included an automatic service charge/tip.  We were a party of two, which I don't think I have ever seen an automatic service charge in that case.  To me, if you're going to take away the risk of receiving a small tip, you don't get the reward of an above average tip.", "author": "David F."}

(not Quoi, and not Koi Palace ...)\r\n\r\nOur meal here was characterized by delicate and light flavors punctuated with reductions, rare oils and fermented salts.  \r\n\r\nYou need to be in a subtle mood to dine here - that applies to the food, wine as well as the decor.  Perhaps you can take your in-laws or one of the Nobel Prize Laureates in Economics.  Then again, it's down the street from Centerfolds and the Hungry i, so maybe not . . . \r\n\r\nThey  serve a beautiful artisan cheese which I have to say knocks the socks off of any locally produced cheese that I've ever had.\r\n\r\nI think we felt a bit claustraphobic in a few ways:  \r\n\r\n1)  The staff were on us, and literally didn't give us a chance to read the menu or discuss wine selections amongst ourselves.  I imagine they were just trying to be helpful and friendly.  But being a control freak in many ways (and definitely when it comes to food) I was feeling like my acid trip had gone a little wrong.\r\n\r\n2)  The space - decor is spartan, very zen japanese-moss growing on a log with neutral textured wall-paper going on.  Great.  But when you have to stare at that same log for like the next 2.5 hrs... you start wondering what will happen if you take the candles on the table and attempt to set fire to the moss.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion:\r\n\r\nWhile Coi was amazing with respect to the food, I think I will have to bring my abnoxious self only after I've:\r\n\r\na) meditated in a cave for a few months \r\nb) refined my palate to the point that i've given-up pizza and jagermeister at 2am\r\nc) learned how to be demure and lay off the crack.\r\n\r\nThank you Coi, for am amazing gastronomical experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-05-29", "description": "We were NOT impressed with Coi. I had wanted to visit this restaurant for some time, and I had hoped that this restaurant would offer an exciting and fresh approach to food not often available in the Bay Area. I must admit, with some sadness, that it fell quite flat.\n\nOur reservation for four was on Friday, May 25, 2007, at 8:45PM. Due to some residual Critical Mass mayhem we called and alerted the restaurant that we would be a little bit late (thankfully we were able to avert most of the mess at the last minute!). A star goes to the hostess for being quite polite each time I interacted with her.\n\nThe space is every bit as claustrophobic as people have reported in the past. The windowless dining room is washed in neutrals, and is rather brightly illuminated. My dining companions, including my boyfriend, felt as though it was too bright: I noted that, while yes, it was bright, the room would have felt like a cave otherwise. Point duly noted. We also took note that this small dining room never filled - there were a number of unused tables during our stint.\n\nThe service started out fairly friendly and professional; however, as the evening went on (we arrived at 9, and left the restaurant at 11:30), the service became increasingly curt and sloppy. This was clearly a case of staff wanting to go home. If a restaurant insists on offering late seatings, diners cannot be made to feel as though they're an inconvenience and that they're \"keeping\" the staff from going home. We weren't even offered coffee or any type of after-dinner drink (though two people then asked for coffee, which was brought out begrudgingly).\n\nAs for the food, I had:\n\nPINK GRAPEFRUIT ginger, tarragon, black pepper\n\nSCALLOP AND CALIFORNIA OSETRA CAVIAR 'RAVIOLO'\nsea urchin, chive\n\nZUCKERMAN'S ASPARAGUS meyer lemon sabayon,\nmcevoy olive oil\n\nCARAMELIZED ENDIVE TART herbs, black olive vinaigrette\n\nWARM MARIN SUN FARMS PIG'S HEAD breadcrumbs,\nyoung cabbage, radish\n\nYUBA 'PAPARDELLE' baby fava beans and leaves, harissa\n\nTRUFFLED RICOTTA PUDDING english peas, spring onions\n\nMARIN SUN FARMS RIBEYE yuzu kosho, fresh cippollini onion confit, sage\n\nAGED GUFFANTI PECORINO LUCANO pink pearl apple, rooibos\n\nThe desserts were not as represented by an earlier online menu. We received a molten chocolate cake with ice cream, and then a dulce de leche milkshake shot and sugar cookie.\n\nThis is where I will be most harsh. Given that Daniel Patterson went on a bit of a tirade claiming that SF chefs (and, frankly, US chefs in general) were not offering exciting menus, I was expecting him to wow us with new techniques and flavors. If using foams (and in SEVERE excess) and cooking one item sous-vide is revolutionary, I apparently set my expectations too high.\n\nI frankly only enjoyed ONE savory dish - the ribeye. While it was in no way inventive, the flavors at least worked and it was well prepared. I noted that often the individual components of dishes were either good on their own and just didn't mesh well when combined with others, or - more often - lacked much flavor at all and were more decoration than substance. Tisk!\n\nThe pink grapefruit dish frankly bordered on vile - the foam was so incredibly laced with essence that it covered any trace of grapefruit flavor. The essential oil I was supposed to rub on my wrists prior to tasting had evaporated almost completely before being brought to the table. Trendy, but no substance. For what it's worth, there's no way I could have continued to \"smell\" the oil while consuming my course; that is, unless I held one wrist in front of my nose while I ate using the other hand.\n\nI was frankly offended by the asparagus dish. ONE stalk of asparagus?! This dish wasn't even remotely exciting - and, thank you, Daniel... but I can steam asparagus at home. The yuba 'papardelle' was incredibly bland. Mind you, this COULD have been an exciting dish if it was executed well. *sigh*\n\nI will give credit to the pastry chef. While the desserts weren't necessarily exciting, they DID taste good. Given the disappointing savory courses, dessert was practically revered (hence the two stars).\n\nWe brought a bottle of Peter Michael Chardonnay with us, and ordered an August West Pinot from the rather pricey wine list. Corkage was waived because of the purchase.\n\nThe total for four was approaching $800. We did not leave anything in addition to the included 18% gratuity. I usually feel that this mandatory gratuity concept has the potential to negatively impact what servers can make - I've noted on many occasions that, even with excellent service, some people don't feel the need to leave anything extra. In Coi's case, the servers lucked out.\n\nMaybe there's a reason Daniel Patterson has had so little luck maintaining restaurants in SF. *scoff* I, for one, will not be going back to Coi.", "author": "Jesse H."}

We have other pretenders to the crown weighing in with their own gastronomic inventions. Young chefs playing with science and cuisine for full effect. Sometimes it is a small miracle, sometimes it is a disappointment.\n\nIn San Francisco there's nothing quite like the rich experimental fields of Chicago, perhaps because the produce, meat, fish, and dairy are so much better for so many more months during the year, and little is needed to make them shine.\n\nCoi is one of the rare - perhaps becoming less so now that the gadgets and starches are easily available - San Francisco joints that openly experiments with thought, science, and food. It is the intellectual gastronomy that can both delight and dismay the diner. \n\nI suppose I'm lucky in that I was exposed to the magic of El Bulli in the mid 90s, when an enthusiastic chef forced us all to understand and appreciate what was going on outside of Barcelona. When Grant Achatz took over Trio, I was living across the street, and had the chance to sample his fits and starts as he taught himself the basics without the kitchen staff that a truly overwrought dish needs to reach its full flower. When he opened Alinea, I was there, fork in hand, ready to dig into whatever he threw at me. And I went back again and again, curious to see what he would dream up next.\n\nSo that's my history. You can't shake off your past. Experience is something we reference as we live in the moment...at least I do, as I eat. \n\nAs I sat down to eat at Coi, I was immediately comforted by the warmth of the dining area. The color palette is soft and earthy, the lights are just right, the service is friendly. There's something much more casual about Coi than its Midwestern cousins. Casual and laid back.\n\nI'm a fan of experiential dining. I like action verbs. I like sniffing and smelling and rubbing and experiencing with all of my senses. I find that a meal that engages multiple senses is relaxing and a vacation from the everyday. I suppose that isn't typical, and I know some who find that sort of complexity an appetite suppressant. \n\nCoi puts a lot of thought into the mechanics of eating there. Use what? Smell this. Eat this like this. I've been through it before, many times, and I enjoyed it. But the preparations weren't revelatory. I wasn't moved in the way that a meal at Alinea can move me. It was certainly less intellectual than other meals I've had but had more soul and heart than those same meals. But the execution wasn't polished. There was an olive oil puff with savory ice cream. It was playful but incomplete. And each course that followed felt the same to me...playful but missing something. \n\nI'll go back.

Out of 5 points, the starters were a 4, the middle dishes were a 2 at best, and the desserts were a 5.  Without the desserts, I would have asked for my money back.  \n\nAnd, they have the audacity to automatically include an 18% service charge.  Ok, I normally leave 20% in a nice restaurant, but I do it based on merit, not as a tax.  Plus, the 18% charge WAS taxed.  Ugh. \n\nPINK GRAPEFRUIT ginger, tarragon, black pepper\n- Holy tart suck your lips off, batman!  but tasty.  Easily would fit in a single spoonful.\n\nSHINY BEETS citrus scented gel, vadouvan\n- Beets (plural) meant 3 1/8\" x 1\" disks of beet, barely enough to taste.  Again, easily would fit in a single spoonful.\n\nFROMAGE BLANC TART early girl tomatoes, mcevoy olive oil, verbena\n- Great flavor from the tart, but served cold?  And again, a teaspoon wouldn't be stressed out containing this entire dish.\n\nCauliflower with SMOKED AND SEARED BONE MARROW \n- Ok, this was freaking tasty.  Loved the flavor of the smoked marrow, but damn, 1 sprig of califlower cut into 3 pieces?  I might've gotten 2 bites out of this.\n\nSPINY LOBSTER SALAD radish, bramley's seedling apple,fennel, chervil \n- Again, very yummy.  The apples were 1/4\" balls that were bursting with flavor... but I think they bought one single lobster to feed the entire nights worth of guests.  At this point I'd eaten 5 rolls with butter.  \n\nSAUTEED MONTEREY BAY ABALONE escarole, parsley-caper vinaigrette\n- This was easily the worst preparation of Abalone I've ever had.  Tasted very similar to driving over a rotting cod, and serving the tire after marinating it in sewer water for a couple of days.  I struggled to cut through it with a serrated butter knife.  My teeth had even less success.  This was fail #1\n\nFail #2 was a tofu dish, cooked japanese style, but tasted again, like ass.  \n- Marinated cardboard.  At least they gave me 5 or 6 spoonfuls.  My starving stomach made me eat the whole thing and regretted it, deeply. \n\nSLOW COOKED FARM EGG \ngreen farro, gold chard, brown butter-parmesan sauce \nor\nSEARED BIG VALLEY RANCH BISON gold turnips and their greens, black olive\n- I had the egg, and my wife had the bison.  I have to admit that the Bison was tasty, but who ever thought of serving it on a bed of turnip greens that tasted like last weeks lawn clippings after composting?  The turnip greens were like ripping the bison flavor out of my mouth and replacing it with clorox. the Farm egg was a single egg, with a semi tasty foamy broth on it, with these awful chewy bits of barley, like a bowl of thrown up breakfast cereal after fermenting in an upset stomach.\n\nCheese course - FIGARO (SOYOUNG SCANLAN) halal dates, walnuts, peppercress\n- This was an awesome awesome cheese course, the dates were picked young and were crispy but with a seriously sweet honey flavor.  Perfect contrast to the walnuts and the flavorful but not overpowering hard goat cheese.\n\nQUINCE PARFAIT huckleberry, almond, thyme\n- One of the best desserts I've ever had.  Nice large serving, heavenly creamy with an intense citrus/berry flavor, clean finish and a perfect contrast with sweet/salty almost brittle.  \n\nMICHEL CLUIZEL \"CONCEPCION\" GANACHE seascape strawberries,\ncocoa nib, violet ice cream\n- Fantastic chocolate dessert.  The chocolate and the sweet violet ice cream emphasized each other's flavors and left us wanting more. \n\nVanilla/olive oil milkshake + chocolate chip cookie truffle\n- Both were amazing, I've never had such intense vanilla flavor, and the olive oil gave it an extremely rich touch.  Yum.", "author": "Kit W."}

They nail it, very attentive, team approach yet  casual, even playful but still very knowledgeable.\n\nThe 11 courses were a good mixture, but somehow left me feeling like I had seen it all before.  Props to the fresh current ingredients.  Overall Menu a 4 of 5.\n\nSome dishes used salt to highlight flavors and pairings, but the effect was just salty.   And all in all if you judged food on technical preparation, 5 of 5, but unfortunately the flavors were just lacking. Overall, there was one out of 11 where the flavor and quality \"blew my hair back.\" (Props to Heather for coming up with that assessment). For flavors 2 of 5. \n\nThe decor was surprisingly boring, it felt like West elm has designed it, and had wisps of being inside a tube of a large airline compartment, it is rectangular room with tables lining the long sides and no windows.  Not bad, just not much, 3 of 5.\n\nSo am I being critical, YES, more than other places, YES.

That is the first thing that popped into my head when I read \"Douglas fir ice cream\". \n\nSF has always focused on the bounty that nature has blessed us with. Other regions have to coax the best of less than stellar ingredients with innovation, invention, creativity. Our chefs in the Bay Area, while incredibly talented in their own right, just need to not mess up our perfect raw ingredients. \n\nI'd been curious to dine at Coi (pronounced \"kwa\" - so deliciously pretentious) because they decided to marry the innovation and cutting edge technique with the finest ingredients. They dared to try to improve upon our local perfection of vegetables, fruit and meat. \n\nCoi is a dining experience, with an emphasis on experience. Don't expect to get fed/nourished/sated in a purely physical manner. Coi is about stimulating all of your senses to engage you with the food. \n\nOur first course was the Pink Grapefruit which comes with a drop of the signature Coi oil blend that you dab on your wrist before you try the actual dish. The more I thought about the dish, the more I was intrigued by the process - you touch, smell, absorb the flavors of your food before you can actually taste it. Coi is telling us that eating is a holistic process that can be enjoyed with all your senses.  Since your skin reacts uniquely to fragrance you get a personalized experience with the food. Brilliant. \n\nThe other memorable parts of the meal was the root, green garlic soup, goat cheese mousseline tart with the most perfect cubes of sweet apples, slow cooked farm egg, the Intermezzo of kiwi soda, Douglas fir ice cream (so refreshing, it captured the essence of taking a deep breath in the middle of a forest in the dead of winter when the air is pure), vanilla milkshake with olive oil (the little shot they gave me was NOT enough, I could have devoured an entire glass). \n\nThe talent level of the chefs is incredible - I was in awe of the precision of their knife skills. The service was professional, knowledgeable yet, gracious and courteous. \n\nThere were a few dishes I didn't care for and were not memorable enough for me to mention them here. \n\nMy advice is do not wear a black suit here lest you be mistaken for the staff. Clear out the evening - we started eating at 8 and didn't finish til 11.", "author": "Monica L."}

We started with the fava bean salad and one other starter.\n\n We got the mushroom stew which was more like a loose mushroom ravioli. It was good and different, but not stew. it was miss titled and misleading but good none the less. \n\nWe got the carrot cake with celery sorbet and one other desert. The sorbet was ingenious and perfect. \n\nAll in all, everything was amazing, but really, just TOO small. It was a good taste but not enough to get into it. It was unpleasantly small. It was annoyingly and ridiculously small dishes. And in saying that I guess I would go as  far to say that it was overpriced, given the food per dollar ratio.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-05-24", "description": "Amuse. Milk & Honey. A mouthful of concentrated milk flavor and honey flavors. Lovely.\n\n1. Pink Grapefruit. This is the opening dish, served with the essential oil and paired with the Coi Cocktail. No change and still a nice palate cleanser for what is to come.\n\n2. Earth and Sea. New harvest potatoes, cucumber, borage, sea beans, ice plant flowers. Served with [i]Domaine de la Fruitiere Muscadet, France 2006[/i]. An interesting dish which was colored with squid ink. Creamy potatoes and grassy greens were brightened with the ice plant. Fabulous wine, but I'm not sure it did anything for the dish.\n\n3. Inverted Andante Dairy Goat Cheese Start with black olive, vadouvan, preserved lemon, and wild arugula. Served with [i]Gutzler Blac de Noir, Germany 2008[/i]. This was a beautifully-prepared dish and exciting to eat. The vadouvan was barely detectable as the goat cheese predominated in flavors. Creamy and well-complemented with the tang of the preserved lemon, the paper-think black olive start provided an exciting crunch. The wine pairing was too strident to work well with the goat cheese.\n\n4. Winter Into Spring. Chilled English pea soup with buttermilk snow and mint. Pired with [i]Ostatu Rioja Blanco, Spin, 2007[/i]. Heralding spring, what could be better than a bright green, clean pea soup? The soup itself was delightful but it was studded with almost frozen fresh peas. I thought it distracting and masking the flavor of the peas. They did \"pop\" in the mouth, which I imagine is what Chef Patterson was striving for, but I think it shut down the flavor of the peas. The buttermilk snow added a nice tang and was light enough to not fight the creaminess of the soup.\n\n5. Fried Chicken Consomm\u00e9. With artichokes, fava beans, radish, and green garlic. Paired with Coenobium Blanco, Italy, 2007. This was a very odd dish; four round fried \"fritters\" which I can only assume was aspic. Breaking one open, I half expected it to be liquid on the inside, but it was not. Not a very memorable dish for me and the wine pairing made the entire dish taste a lot more earthy than I believe was intended.\n\nIntercourse - Tofu Mousseline with Mushroom dashi, yuba, kelp, pickled daikon, and ginger. Paired with [i]Hitachino Nest White Ale[/i]. The last time I had Chef Patterson's yuba, I was not that thrilled as it was a bit too thick and gummy. He has certainly got it down significantly better, but I found the dish a bit overall too salty. There was barely any detectable ginger and I never did find any tofu mousseline. The pairing was spot on and made me chuckle a bit; the only other time I've had this ale was at a pairing at Bin 8945, by David Haskell.\n\n6. Saut\u00e9ed Monterey Bay Abalone. With Escarole, caper berry-sea lettuce vinaigrette. Paired with [i]Domaine Tariquet, France 2007[/i]. My dining companions made a point of saying that Chef Patterson Twittered about getting the abalone that day so they were excited about the dish. I found it intensely mediocre; chewy and unbalanced, it tasted incredibly salty and almost unfresh in its overt \"bottom-of-the-ocean\" flavor. \n\n7. Morels with burnt rice, ash, smoke, and pine. Paired with [i]Louis Latour Marsannay, France 2006[/i]. I was most excited by this dish as I am quite the mushroom fan. And, sadly, it was the most disappointing dish of the evening (with the abalone a close second). In an opportunity to showcase morels in their whole, glorious state, they were chopped up in to small bits. The rest of the ingredients provided no color so the dish was muddy looking. The texture was pasty and many at the table indicated that the dish was too reminiscent of Campbell's Cream of Mushroom Soup -- thick and gloppy. Great wine though!\n\n8. Marin Sun Farms Goat in Different Forms with sprouted seeds, nuts, beans, and wheatgrass. Paired with [i]Chateau Rayas 'La Pialade' France, 2005[/i]. Very well executed protein; rare and tender, showcasing the gamy quality of the goat. Quite frankly, though, I'm not sure how preparing the meat four different ways really showed off Chef Patterson's talent or the ingredient, as they were all piled together on the plate. We had no way of knowing which piece was prepared in which fashion.\n\nNot enough room to write about the desserts (except that they were a highlight), But I did want to offer this: Now, reflecting on this meal a few days later, I am more unimpressed than impressed. It is the mediocrity of the abalone and the morels that I am remembering more than the successes (which, quite frankly, were the desserts). By and large the meal was too heavily salted and a bit ponderous in its seriousness. There seemed no attempt at levity in the intent of showcasing fresh, raw ingredients; uncooked items were mere garnishes or -- in the case of the peas -- frozen as a \"trick.\" Too many bells and whistles without letting the ingredients speak for themselves.", "author": "Carolyn T."}

Thanks for having me.\n\nAnyway, this place is trying way to hard to make their food special that they lost focus on making things edible.  I knew once they asked me to put this perfume on my wrist and use the aromas to enhance the flavors of the dish that it was going to be a long night.  We sat down at 6, and left there at 9:30.  A long night is not bad if you're enjoying your meal, but after our third bowl of foam I was getting a little annoyed.\n\nOlive foam?  It's a salty pudding like textured mush.  Perfume?  Get away from me.  11 courses of badness.  The shrimp sashimi was tasty, the duck was nice, pork bellies were pork bellies, but all other 7 or 8 dishes were trying way too hard.  I couldn't eat the deserts, the dried pistachios were dry, salty and added nothing to the ice cream they accompanied.  The goat cheese was too funky for all but 1 of our 8 eaters at the table to consume.  The last desert was pretty much a milkshake like concoction with olive oil, not awful, but pretty rich.\n\nAll in all, for the price I had high expectations and Coi fell WAY short.   It's not the money as much as it's the 3.5 hours of my life I want back. There are so many better ways to eat.  I'm all for experimenting, and I'll eat pretty much everything, but this was nothing short of bad.  Too many concoctions trying way too hard.\n\nMAYBE we caught them on an off night, they do change the menu daily, but I was a huge seller of this cult-like experience.  I'm not a believer.

YES its pricey so if you feel uncomfortable about that upfront, do yourself a favor and go to Zuni or somewhere else. I went purely for some intereting fare, and really got that.

I can say that the staff is as courteous, professional and informative as you are likely to ever encounter.  If there can be one positive takeaway from this experience it is that professional service in SF is not dead.\n\nWhat about the negatives?  \nTacks\nThe partition screen between the bar and dining room was affixed to the wall with a thumb tack.  This following word isn't normally in my lexicon and please pardon the pun, but I found this tacky.  I'm not OCD by any definition, but in this environment paying roughly $500 for dinner, I expect more.  \n\nPaparazzi\nAnd what's up with Yelpers (and Chow Hounders too, I suppose) basically treating their dining experiences as a preparation for the real experience of writing the review?  At the tables adjacent to us were a total of 6 individuals with either pen and paper or digital recorders and their own camera.  There were so many flashes throughout the meal I thought the paparazzi had cornered Britney Spears behind me.  It's not entirely Coi's fault, of course.  We've had the same experience in Orson, WD~50, and Bouchon.  It just rubbed me the wrong way here.  \n\nDrinks\nAnd what establishment at this level doesn't have a liquor license?  Are you kidding me?  This doesn't convey that the chef values the taste of his food and doesn't want it sullied by grain spirits.  It says that his backers are cheap and wouldn't spring for the license. \n\nMeat\nAnd the greatest sin they committed?  Not enough meat.  If my ovo-lacto-pescatarian friends will eat it, it's not meat.  More importantly and more often than not it's not for me.\n\nRegarding our dinner, we happened to eat within a few days of Carolyn T.

D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu apparently owns half of the North Beach now.  Trying very hard not to use the word \"stripper\" in my review!\n\nWifey and I were here for my b-day.

Perfectly portioned, prepared, and spaced throughout the evening.  For the price you pay, I feel like the experience should be amazing on all levels--food, drink, service, and ambiance, so I'm knocking off two stars for the following:\n\n-- There were several fruit flies in the private dining room we reserved.  They were easily seen because the room is dark except for a huge low hanging lantern in the middle of the table.  I noticed them when we sat down, but thought nothing of it at first.    Then, we starting seeing more.  We had to start waving them off the appetizers.  Finally, one started drowning in my glass of wine.  We told our server and he apologized profusely and quickly replaced it with a new glass.  Great.  There were still fruit flies in the room.  During the serving of the next course, the manager also was in the room helping serve the food, at which point he asked how everything was going so far.  We said great, and told him about our fruit fly problem in as nice a way as possible--like, we know you can't just ask the flies to leave or have your people running around this tiny room swatting at them, but just as an FYI.  While some of the other servers had the apologetic reaction you'd expect, the manager came off like an asshole.  He responded with \"Oh yeah? Ok.  Thanks for letting us know, we'll see what we can do about THAT,\" and walked out.  He sounded sarcastic and irritated, as if we were trying to get something out of the situation, which was even more aggravating to me at that point than the goddamn fruit flies.  This manager would also stand just near the doorway listening to our server talk about each course.  While I can kind of appreciate this attempt at quality assurance, I also found it distracting because it made our server nervous and sound more scripted.  \n\nUltimately, if we wanted to eat amongst fruit flies landing in our food and drink, we would have had gone out for some bahn mis in the Tenderloin. As an asian person, I have a certain tolerance for fruit flies, weird smells, etc. as part of certain dining experiences, but there's a time and a place and a PRICE for it--this dinner was $3,000. This was on a weeknight, and the place was nearly empty when we were done.  Did the manager come out and say goodbye or thank  you or apologize that our dining room felt like we were eating at Lee's Sandwiches with all the lights dimmed? Nope.  I don't want to say \"fuck this place\" because the food was outstanding and EVERYONE else except that manager was really nice, but it is unacceptable to have your party brushed off and made to feel berated for politely addressing a glaring issue with the dining experience.\n\nAfter posting this, I happened to come across other reviews that also mentioned fruit flies!!!

Another friend said that it was really good.  I've always wanted to check this place out and so did my hot date, so we finally decided to go the night before my date left for NY and decide for ourselves how this place is.  The host there said that they're known for their 11 course dinner, so that's what we each ordered at $135 per person.  Wowzers!  We were both very excited to taste the 11 course dinner, so when the 1st course came, it was some strawberry root beer soda.  After my date and I drank it, I said \"Ok, this is a really bad start to an 11 course meal\", 2nd course came, 3rd course, and so on was ok, and nothing spectacular to wow us.  The only thing we both liked was the poached and seared duck breast, which I think was the 9th course.  The last 2 were desserts and they weren't impressive at all.  So that's 1 out of 11 dishes that I can say is good.  That's 8.33% success rate, which is terrible! \n\nConclusion: 1 out of 11 courses was good, but may have been stained from the other 10 mediocre tasting courses.

It's not the Central Office of Information (UK) because I went to that site and there was nothing about the confusingly enjoyable mousse with eau de some menage of herb oils on my plate (and subsequently, wrist) that I had at Coi.\r\n\r\nIt's not a misspelled version of Koi.  Been there.  My friend says - in an email - \"Let's go to Coi, it's supposed to be great!  It's the guy from Elizabeth Daniel.\"  I'm thinking \"Great! I love Japanese food, but how did the guy get from Elizabeth Daniel to...\"\r\n\r\nAnyway aside from the initial trek of misunderstandings to be cleared up at a later date (I forgot to ask at dinner), I had a wonderful dinner at this relatively new restaurant.  It was, however, very disconcerting.  The lounge has very clean lines and is pleasant and surprising in that it has a familiarity to it.  Then it hits me, this is what IKEA has been trying to do with their frankenfurniture in all their ads.  Shit!  I knew that company was going to spoil something for me by crawling into our collective subconsciousness, it was just a matter of time.  Secondly, the colors.  I grew up with these colors in the days of earth shoes and nylon pretending to be natural fibers, except at Coi, it really is natural fibers.  The look works really well in a clean, simple fashion. \r\n\r\nThe dining room is a calmer (!) version of the lounge.  It looks like an earth tone version of the cabin filmed at the beginning of 2001:A Space Odyssey.  It feels a bit claustrophobic until I sit down.

Now tied in my book with Manresa for Best Restaurant Evar.\n\n* Carlos A: Same price range as Manresa?\n\n* Danny D: Same price range, possibly a little cheaper. We saved money on wine because we're both still kinda sick. Tasting menus were $120pp for 11 courses, and when we were still interested in other dishes that weren't included in our menu, they gave them to us free anyway, because they \"didn't want us to leave hungry\".\n\nIn my opinion, Manresa has amazing food with very good service, while Coi has very good food with amazing service. Note that my use of \"very good\" indicates that they're better than almost any other Bay Area restaurant.\n\nAlso note that this isn't In-N-Out good, or Little Star Pizza good, or even NoPa good, When I want those places, this won't do. This is an entirely different type of experience. A better comparison would be \"more worth it than the Opera\" good, or \"better than the ballet\" good, or \"skydiving or nice dinner?\" good. These are places where the food comes together with the service, the ambiance, and the company you bring to create a memorable life experience.\n\nAs guy sitting at the table next to us put it: \"This isn't a first date place.

The Crispy Chicken and Egg and Steelhead Trout dishes from Kinch were the winners of the night, really amazing textures going on here, and really, the best fish I've ever had in my life.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-11-09", "description": "I started off my night at Coi a little disapointed with both the service and the food but as the night went on everything improved--the food went from disappointing to EXCELLENT, the service went from rigid and slow to fluid and FRIENDLY.  I loved my experience at Coi but since it had its \"misses\" in service and a couple of dishes I gave it 4 stars, not 5.\n\nCoi is more than  just dinner its a \"dining experience.\" The 11-courses tasting (mandatory in the dining room) is like a roller coaster- exciting, thrilling, sometimes a little disappointing and scary, but altogether a great ride. I love that chef Patterson is risky and innovative in his menu. \n\nThe decor is very contemporary and upscale, minimalist, and definitely set for a special occasion.  When you first walk in you'll see a lounge area where people can order bites and drinks.  The dining room is separate and seats about 40 people.  My first impression was that I liked the decor alot, though some would say its a little sterile (grey and brown all over).  I like the cool rice paper-ish ceilings and the  funky fuzzy pillows which makes the place a little more hip. Very New-York-ey (good in my book).\n\nThe tasting menu started out really disappointing to me, but as the courses went on they got better and better. The first couple of courses were really weird and kind of gross actually. I thought that the milk and honey capsule amuse bouche (see picture with 2 spoons) looked really cool but tasted pretty gross. When you bit into it this surprising burst of milky sweet liquid gushed out and I didn't like the taste at all. The pink grapefruit granita had WAY too much ginger in it, though the texture and concept were kind of cool.  The shiny beets were good, but just good- simply cooked beets with a good olive oil and some herbs. So far I was disappointed. \n\nThen the meal turned around--Oysters Under Glass- by far the BEST OYSTER I have ever had--medium-size oyster seasoned with yuzu sweet and sour vinaigrette and what tasted like crunchy shallots. It was beautifully presented with a \"glass\" cover--some gelatinous clear sheet place delicately over the delicious oyster. I could have eaten 10 of those. Roasted Cauliflower Soup with bone marrow was creamy, smoky and delicious, had a nice foam on top--I licked my bowl clean. The Kabocha Squash soup was silky smooth and good, but I'd say too much ginger.  The Earth and Sea tofu soup was pretty disappointing b/c it tasted like some chinese restaurant corn starch soup. It was ok, but nothing I'd expect at a restaurant charging $120 per person.  Abalone was pretty good, Matsutake Mushrooms with Pine Needle Puree was interesting- extra points for innovativeness (pine needle extract was used to make the puree), but I didnt  like the pine needle puree at all.  Slow Cooked Farm Egg--very good (same as other's reviews of it).  Chicken Stuffed with Sweetbreads and Pig's Feet- this was THE BEST CHICKEN ever, it almost tasted like pork b/c it was so juicy, and the skin had a nice layer of gelatin and fat on it. \n\nThe BEST DISH OF THE NIGHT- Quince and Huckleberry Parfait- OH MY GOD this dessert was absolutely perfect!!! The bottom was huckleberry puree, hucklberry granita, and almond brittle. Cold, fruity and crunchy. The top layer was a light, sweet, whipped cream/milk. The creaminess and crunchiness offset each other perfectly. I would go back to Coi just to order this (you can do this at the lounge area).\n\nThe presentation of all the dishes was beautiful and flawless.\n\nThe service was fine and pretty formal--napkins folded when gone, all the usual fine-dining etiquette but I would have appreciated a little more friendliness. Sometimes I couldn't even get a smile from the waiter. Perhaps this is all part of the image Coi is going for but just because you are at a fine restaurant doesn't mean you have to have stiff service. The service did improve as the meal went on. The sommelier was awesome, really friendly and recommended some great wines to us.\n\nI agree with the other Yelpers that there was TOO much salt on some dishes, and the ginger flavor was overwhelming in some dishes. But considering how innovative and risky Chef Patterson is in his menus, I would expect that sometimes there will be some not-perfect dishes. I'd definitely go back.", "author": "amy k."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-20", "description": "I first heard about Coi 4 years ago when I moved to SF. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it. To me, it was simply a drop of water in an ocean of SF restaurants that I had to venture to. As the years passed, I heard more and more positive reviews from friends and other Yelper and gradually formed the opinion that Coi was a must-try. Add to that the growing reputation of Chef Daniel Patterson as the closest thing that SF has to \"molecular gastronomy\" and Coi's crowning achievement of two Michelin stars. Even then, somehow the stars never aligned for me and Coi to meet until tonight. Well, it was worth the wait.\n\nI came here with a couple friends as a bon voyage dinner for one of those friends who was moving away. So it was a bittersweet occasion. When I first walked in, I was greeted by the host in the lounge area. The restaurant was smaller than I expected, seating about 20 in the lounge and about 30 in the main dining room, yet it was very warm and cozy. The d\u00e9cor was minimalistic and reminded me of Benu's d\u00e9cor a bit. Coi definitely embraces the concept of California cuisine: daily rotating menu, fresh ingredients from local vendors, and artisanal products ranging from the cheese to the full assortment of Heath ceramic tableware. My friends and I sat down and prepared ourselves for the 11-course tasting tour we were about to embark upon. Suffice it to say, we were excited.  \n\nThe first course was the \"Childhood Memory of Harvest\"--Coi's homage to the Fall harvest. It consisted of vegetable leathers (think of it as fruit roll-ups but made with onion--tastes much better than it sounds!), a walnut tuile, a beet \"pillow\", apple, nuts, and a complimentary glass of pear cider. And we're off to a great start! Next up, \"Marin Miyagi Oysters\" on diced wheatgrass and lemon ice served in an ice-chilled bowl--an excellent and unique combination of flavors that brought the freshness out of the oysters. Plus, I never thought wheatgrass could taste so good! Batting 3rd was an \"Inverted Cherry Tomato Tart\" that looked more like a Napoleon pastry than a tart.  The top layer was a black olive crisp that sandwiched fresh cherry tomatoes sitting on a bottom layer of basil sauce. Delish! The 4th dish was probably the most interesting: \"Chilled Fennel Consomm\u00e9\" with sea urchin and purslane. The broth was light and smooth and complimented the saltiness of the sea urchin well. The purslane provided some texture to balance out the sponginess of the sea urchin. All in all, a really good soup.\n\nNow, bring on the meats! The \"Monterrey Bay Abalone Grilled on the Plancha\" was a tad on the salty side for my tastes but was executed well enough to not have the \"fishy saltwater\" taste I normally associate with abalone. Not my favorite dish of the night, but solid nonetheless. The \"Wild Black Cod Smoked over Beet Charcoal\" came with creamed leeks, beet-red flame grape sauce, horseradish, and dill. A contender for dish of the night. The cod was luscious and almost melted in my mouth. A second contender was the \"Pan Grilled Matsutake.\" That's a mushroom btw (I didn't know what it was at first either). It was served on top a bed of potato-pine needle puree.  That's fancy talk for a REALLY good mash potato. Again, the mushrooms were a bit overly-salted but, man, did they taste good! Rounding out the meats was the \"Prather Ranch Beef\"--a tenderloin and some beef cheeks terrine. The tenderloin was, well, tender and flavorful and you can't really go wrong with beef cheeks.\n\nNow, on to my favorite part of any meal--the dessert! Starting the dessert portion was a lovely Cavatina cheese. I sure do love cheese!! And this Cavatina sure was lovable! Rich, creamy, aromatic...some sprigs of wild arugula paired with the cheese quite nicely. I then looked at the menu to see what was next: cheesecake. Ok, I love cheesecake! But, cheesecake made of goat cheese?! I was skeptical at how good goat cheese would be in a cheesecake. Boy, was I wrong! First off, it wasn't really a cheesecake in the traditional sense at all. It was more like a deconstructed cheesecake: goat cheese \"foam\" + grape sorbet + graham cracker tuile=dessert heaven and my favorite dish of the night! If that wasn't enough, there was one more course: \"Apples Scented with Burnt Cinnamon\". Take baked apples, iced buttermilk, and hazelnut and you've got a recipe for deliciousness. Top it off with a fresh cup of Blue Bottle coffee and the night is set!\n\nOur 11 course tasting adventure ended with 3 happy (and full) adventurers! Eating at Benu had temporarily soured my desires for long dinners but the 3 hours at Coi didn't seem that long and the dishes were paced appropriately. There wasn't a single dish that stood out as a \"superstar\" dish but the 11 courses together created a great overall dining experience. Coi doesn't quite topple Gary Danko from the top of my SF list but it's up there with Chez Panisse, Commis, etc--maybe top 5 all Bay Area, definitely top 10.

It would have been forgiveable, since anything this experimental is bound to have some mis-steps, but three of my courses were soups.  I'm really sorry, but I don't think in an 11 course tasting menu should have 3 soup courses.  It was weird.  One was a dessert soup, but still.  Enough with the soup already!  \n\nFor this amount of money, I would have preferred one of a handful of any other restaurants in San Francisco.  To be fair, I went to the restaurant a couple of months ago, but Michael Bauer's new rating that came out today really inspired me to add my two cents.  I appreciate the attention-to-detail and artistry that went into these dishes, but I really don't feel like this restaurant was in the same league as the other four star Chronicle restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-10-25", "description": "This place seems to be a place you will either *love* for the culinary experimentation, or hate because (as some people have put it) they feel unsatisfied by the portion size.  I found that the flavors that Coi chose to combine in some of their more daring dishes was stuff i would have never thought would work together and did, and in the things that seemed more like crowd-pleasers (like the frommage tart and the milkshake), the flavors were all amplified and in your face.  \n\nIn essence, you should only come to Coi for an adventure in eating, not a buffet all-you-can-eat.  And that is what you'll get.  Is it expensive, yes!  Is it worth it?  yes.  \n\nWe went on a Friday night, and the subtleties of good serving etiquette were honored to a \"t.\"  We decided to do the pairings of alcohol, just to see what the chef had in mind for us.\n\nWe started with a milk-honey ball, which is an amazing culinary creation using science.  Also delicious.  None of the texture of honey, but enormous flavor of honey.\n\nPINK GRAPEFRUIT ginger, tarragon, black pepper\nthis was an amazing taste flavor amazement.  But you have to like grapefruit and be into having sweet, salty, bitter, and sour all attack your mouth at the same time with a little pepper to match.  The ginger, tarragon and pepper were all in foam and mush form on the top and a touch salty, and tasted fantastic.  This dish came with a little fragranced oil that one was to smell while tasting the dish.  It added something totally amazing to the experience, because the nose is the key to your tastebuds....Add to this a sparkling pink wine (i didn't catch the name).  I don't even like sparkling wine, but with this dish, it's fan-freakin' tast\n\nSHINY BEETS citrus scented gel, vadouvan (fermented curry)\nThis was a rather small dish and i don't adore beets, i'll be honest.  My first experience with fermented curry, and it's super strong and delicious.  The pairing was a peach l'ambic served just a touch too cold, but which worked incredibly with the meal.  \n\nFROMAGE BLANC TART early girl tomatoes, mcevoy olive oil, verbena\nDeliciously strong cheese flavor (like a gruyere-brie combo), and delicious crust.  The beans were delicious with a tomato vinaigrette. This was served with a Leth Roter Veltliner.  Not one of the stronger pairings for my taste.  \n\nCARROTS AND ARTICHOKES BRAISED IN BUTTER\nSome of the most delicious vegetables i have ever eaten.  Paired with a listless von H\u00f6vel Riesling.\n\nSPINY LOBSTER SALAD radish, bramley's seedling apple,fennel, chervil\nAbsolutely fabulous and served with my favorite wines of the night, a 1997 Riesling from Richter that was deliciously minerally and less sweet than most whites.  \n\nSAUTEED MONTEREY BAY ABALONE escarole, parsley-caper vinaigrette\nI haven't yet had a good experience with abalone.  The first bite was good, with a wave of different flavors from the citrusy craziness of capers and vinaigrette to the buttery taste of the abalone and oil.  Further bites were disappointing.  Paired with a Japanese lager that was -meh.-  \n\nMATSUTAKE WITH POTATO PINE-NEEDLE PUREE\nTasty delicious mushroomy mushrooms.  Paired with a Verdelho that gave it a little something more with each bite.\n\nSLOW COOKED FARM EGG\ngreen farro, gold chard, brown butter-parmesan sauce\nThis thing was fascinating and delicious.  Perfectly cooked, and witha rosemary foam on the top that was delicate and bursting with flavor, along with some beautiful buttery quinoa.  The chard was slightly bitter and added a nice contrast.  Paired with a Peay Chardonnay, which may make me like white wines....\n\nSEARED BIG VALLEY RANCH BISON gold turnips and their greens, black olive\nThe dude who complained about these two dishes clearly doesn't like bitter veggies.  I get it.  However, i felt the amazing contrast between these flavors:  the buttery non-gamy taste of the bison that was cooked absolutely to perfection that it nearly melted in the mouth with the super-bitter of the turnip greens helped one appreciate both.  Paired with the Bachannal Cab which was a typical good CA cab.\n\nCheese course - Etude (goat cheese) halal dates, walnuts, peppercress\nDelicious cheesy goodness.\n\nQUINCE PARFAIT huckleberry, almond brittle, thyme\nFreaking amazing.  Berenlesser Steiner dessert wine (passable).  I want to eat this for dessert every stinking night.  Came with a creme foam with a subtle touch of almond flavor.\n\nMICHEL CLUIZEL \"CONCEPCION\" GANACHE seascape strawberries\nAbsolutely freaking amazing!  Served with a delightful Cordova Sherry and CA sweet vermouth that added an extra umpf that made the chocolate ganache crazy delicious.\n\nVanilla/olive oil milkshake + chocolate chip cookie truffle\nI love dessert and all of these desserts made me a little wet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-04-14", "description": "When I first saw mention of Coi in the Gayot SF News section, I was intrigued. Daniel Patterson (of Frisson and Elisabeth Daniel) had thrown down the gauntlet that California Cuisine hadn't fully evolved past what Alice Waters was doing decades ago at Chez Panisse - and to a large part, I agree.\r\n\r\nThe Chez Panisse era of \"California Cuisine\" took its inspiration from Southern Europe - playing with French and Italian flavors and combining them with the abundant fresh food products available in the Bay Area to create something unique. Since then, this style of cooking has become rote... and boring.\r\n\r\nIn the Bay Area today, flavors are bold and heavily influenced more by Latin and Asian sensibilities than Italian, and you're more likely to find North African infused Spanish than French. When you do find French, chances are it leans more towards Basque than classic Gallic Parisian.\r\n\r\nAs Bob said, \"The times, they are a-changin'\" and it's time to challenge everybody who thinks that Chez Panisse sits in the center of the Northern Californian solar system. Enter Coi.\r\n\r\nTonight was the soft launch of Coi - and I think that my wife and I might have been the only non-industry folks in the restaurant.\r\n\r\nSo, as you read this review, take into consideration that it was their first night of real operation.\r\n\r\nI spent many an afternoon in Coi back when it was Great Water, but honestly, as I was sitting in the tiny dining room (and I mean tiny - 30 people maximum could fit back there, and it would be really cramped), I couldn't even imagine how that bar (which was unchanged from the older Bierhaus days) could be transformed into something like this. With soft ambient music, rich chocolate walls and an abundance of texture ranging from the horizontal weave of the wall coverings to the beautiful diamond embossed tablecloths, it woke the senses up.\r\n\r\nTonight, the choice was simple - the four course tasting menu, which was the only thing available. The meal started with an amuse bouche (whose contents escape me) followed by an exceptional pre-appetizer avocado panna cotta - delicate citrusy avocado served next to creme fraiche and topped with black caviar. The balance of flavor was perfect, and the caviar, which is typically not a favorite of mine, was fantastic. \r\n\r\nThe first of my ordered courses was the Crisp Pig's Feet - which was a cross between southern trotters and a Japanese korokke, or croquette. The flavor was rich and gelatiny, and the accompanying frisee with bacon vinaigrette was just superb, but I am a big fan of bacon vinaigrettes. If you're not into trotters, which can really be an acquired taste, there were two other options. One small detail point, trotters are very hard to make, as they require so much attention to convert all of the connective tissue into tasty gelatin, and occasionally, you'll get a small piece of gristle. In this large appeitzer, I only got one small piece the size of a pin head, which shows the kitchen's skill in preparing the trotters, but if you hate getting any gristle like this in your food, skip this and pick something else.\r\n\r\nThe trotters were followed by the monkfish, served in a beautiful black pepper and yuzu (a Japanese citrus) broth with a little chinese broccoli (like rapini or broccoli rabe). Monkfish can have a funky texture if prepared improperly, but in this case, it was quite exceptional.\r\n\r\nThe third ordered course was quail, deboned, flattened, covered with a \"crepinette\" and sliced into three long strips. It's hard to imagine it, but you can see that this was certainly a nod of the head towards the great fried poultry dishes of the world ranging from southern fried chicken to Japanese chicken kara-age... and the accompanying roasted endive and olive tapenade were perfect accompanyments. One small point, during the deboning, a small piece of a socket joint was left in the meat, so there was a moment of casual dabbing of the lips and expelling the offending piece into my napkin. Not what I expected, but I'm willing to let slide this once.\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a palate cleanser of ginger sorbet with a rhubarb-mint sauce, topped with cilantro. The experience was just perfect, ranging from the texture of the sorbet, the flavor of the sauce all the way down to the fact that the bowls were chilled to ensure that the sorbet would remain solid while you finished the dish.\r\n\r\nThe dessert I chose was my biggest risk - a date terrine with Vietnamese iced coffee gelato. The risk paid off - a warm spicy cake with a gelato that could stand up to the best in Italy (don't lose that pastry chef)! As we concluded the meal with a press-pot of Cafe Trieste, Daniel himself came out to thank us, as he did with every table. \r\n\r\nI could go on and on, but suffice it to say, the meal was great and the 5th star is certainly within reach.", "author": "Avery G."}

We had our best culinary experience of our life last Saturday at Coi restaurant celebrating my birthday  and we've been trying restaurant with Michelin star in Bay area and all around the world. For the whole duration of our dinner we couldn't stop talking about the food that we were eating, hoping this experience would never end. My husband said that chef Patterson is Picasso of culinary art which I think it is a perfect comment to sum up his talent. His food is beautiful, creative, modern, crazy delicious.  His attention to details is impeccable! The other awesome thing is that he changes his menu every week so when you experience his food once you can't stop thinking what would he come up with next. We would definitely recommend dining at Coi for anybody who lives or visits Bay area. You will not be disappointed!", "author": "Noura A."}

Well, Coi is like doing that- only is a relaxed and gorgeous atmosphere. \n\nI took my BF and some friends for a birthday weekend in San Francisco. He got to choose any restaurant and, being the foodie he is, my guy chose Coi. \nIt was obviously the perfect place for a special event because every other table (there are only about 6 of them total) seemed to be celebrating a birthday or something. And, the service there was friendly and accommodating about this - even bring an additional dessert with a candle. \nI should say now, this is a FOODIE place. If you are looking for a casual evening or wanting to do some business- forget it. You won't want to chit chat, you will want to focus on the food a discuss it. Otherwise you may as well take a lighter and burn a couple hundred dollars just for fun.\n\nWe did the 11 course tasting menu and were amazingly pleased. The food was extremely adventurous and unusual- and luckily I got to try everything! There were a few \"this or that\" menu options. The server was kind enough to offer that my BF could do one option and I could order the other- this way we could taste both. This is rare and usually not acceptable in fine dining. But, he offered it up, so that's what we did! \n\nIt was the right choice because a few of my favorite things on the menu were choices I never would have made. The \"Root Salad\" for instance, did not sound that amazing, but it was one of my more favorite courses. There were some unique flavors and some interesting indian spices with coco. Very lovely and lingering. \n\nAlso, the goat was very much a must-have. It was a small sampling prepared three ways and each had a different taste - rare to dry/smokey. Very lovely. \n\nThe squash soup with pomegranates also a favorite of everyone at the table. So many different flavors and yet something very \"comfort food\" about it. \n\nIn the end, we ended up with way more than 11 courses because the chef really like his amuses. We were VERY full and not at all expecting more. Truly a wonderful experience and something that everyone should try at least once.", "author": "Allis M."}

Of course I had favorites among an eleven course dinner, but there was not one course that I would have left anything on the plate.\n\nHere are some of my favorites that I had, but I'm not naming them all, as you need to experience it yourself.\n\nThe Bread, it's truly wonderful. Forget about diets, enjoy three or four pieces with the creamy butter and sea salt.\n\nThe \"Crab Melt,\" similar to a dim sum dish, but more beautiful. It was crab on a very light toast. I could have ate at least ten of these, possible more.\n\nThe tofu and vegetable soup. I hate tofu and I could have ate a pot of this soup. Wonderful.\n\nThe Abalone. How often do you have this on a menu? Beautifully prepared.\n\nThe Beef, perfectly cooked and so tender, you could cut it with a butter knife with a bone marrow companion. \n\nThe Huckleberry dessert. I was full, but I loved it.\n\nThe Chocolate molten cake with sorbet, wonderful. It's not your usual, it's almost savory, yet sweet and perfect size.\n\nAlso, I did have the wine pairings, which I don't usually get, as I like to pick, but they had a balanced selection. If I am lucky enough to go back, I think I will just have champagne all night.\n\nSo, I suppose I did name a lot. This restaurant is not a place I could dine every evening, as I would gain a lot of weight and be broke. For a special occasion, date, or the family member from New York who wants to be impressed, this is ideal. \n\nNote: This is not in the best neighborhood, if you approach from North Beach, but if you drive or walk from the Embarcadero, it's more pleasant.", "author": "Christopher W."}

Nothing wrong with trying a concept like the leathers, but if they simply don't taste good, then concept shouldn't be allowed to triumph over taste.  Still, we were all in a good mood, laughed off the leathers and hoped for better.\n\nUnfortunately, while the other courses were more or less ok, I can't say there was anything that was really good and certainly not great.  \n\nI will say, however, that we received excellent service from all of the staff.  And the dining room and bathroom facilities were all first rate.  Also, we were happy to find a most excellent Italian wine on their wine list.\n\nBut considering this place amongst other multi-course venues in San Francisco, it simply is outclassed by much better food at The Dining Room at Ritz Carlton, Fleur de Lys, or even Masa's.

I was rapturous over the amuse bouche of blanched English peas in a sheeps milk lemon verbena foam....but I was sincerely confused by the extremely salty and unpleasant shot of pea soup that accompanied it. In fact, salt is a real motif here which sometimes is wonderful but just as often throws me off. (I do enjoy the contrast of salt on a chocolate, I don't love it in a vanilla milkshake. Maybe this is the point, which I appreciate but that sort of point I would prefer a touch less of.)\n\nSome standout dishes were \n\n* caviar served on a slow cooked egg yolk covered in creme fraiche - a comforting and extremely satisfying textural pleasure\n* heirloom potatoes in olive oil with a mini salad - again, all about the perfection of texture. these perfect little slices of potato with grainy salt were wonderful\n* zucchini terrine - i don't even like squash and i couldn't get enough of this. rich, herbaceous, and obviously crafted with enormous attention and care\n\nAll in all, I had a lovely (if long) evening.

So hesitant that I almost canceled my reservation at the last minute for Michael Mina instead. But Coi had been at the top of my list for awhile, I'd already been to Michael Mina, and really, could Michelin and Zagat both be so wrong?\n\nCoi is the most avant garde restaurant I've been to in SF. \n\nThe service is impeccable without being pretentious, from the valet who offered me an umbrella for the 5 steps from the cab to the front door, to the sommelier, to the servers - our wine and water glasses were never empty and our silverware was changed for every course.\n\nThe wine selection is excellent and offers choices for every price level.\n\nThe food - there are 11 courses, four of which you get to choose between two offerings. We ordered differently so we could try everything:\n\n- the amuse bouche was marinated sunchoke and a chilled sunchoke soup. The marinated sunchoke was quite tart but good; the chilled sunchoke soup was a little funky - haven't made up my mind on whether I liked it or not.\n\n- pink grapefruit pieces covered with grapefruit sorbet and grapefruit foam, served with a dab of their signature perfume which you can dab on your wrist and sniff before you eat the dish. I liked the smell of the perfume -reminds me of a spa. I'd use it as a home fragrance, but not for myself. The sorbet was good but the foam had a slightly weird flavor that I didn't really like.\n\n- roasted and marinated beet (2 tiny slices) was ok. Just tasted like beets with olive oil and a bit of tartness. \n\n- scallop tartare on a wheatgrass creme fraiche topped with sturgeon caviar was excellent\n\n- caramelized endive tart is a rectangular piece of buttery puff pastry topped with a wilted half endive. Very yummy.\n\n- cauliflower almond milk soup was creamy, lemony and very cauliflowery. I did not like this at all, and I usually like cauliflower.\n\n- artichoke and puntarella salad on a bed of farro. YUM!! I wanted to steal my dining companion's, but his plate was scraped clean.\n\n- yuba pappardelle is long paper thin pieces of tofu/soy skin in a perfectly seasoned dashi broth with tiny pieces of brussel sprouts and other vegetables. \n\n- grilled abalone with fennel and radish was excellent - flavorful, smoky, seasoned perfectly.\n\n- wild mushroom raviolo was earthy and delicious\n\n- roasted black cod in oxtail jus is a generous slab of silky cod with a delicious crispy skin\n\n- slow-cooked farm egg with wheatberries and chard - I loved the silkiness of the slow-cooked egg and the chewiness of the wheatberries - a creative and delicious combination\n\n- guinea fowl with a side of spinach and turnips marinated with bacon was delicious. The fowl is moist and buttery, the wilted spinach and bacon is rich, salty and satisfying\n\n- Cantal (herve mons) with wild greens. I love cheese but I was too full to really enjoy this! Excellent cheese and I really liked the salad that came with it\n\n- Comice pear and chestnut mousse with crumbled star anise cookies. YUM YUM YUM. I was SOOOOO full by this point but this was delicious. My dining companion was pleased when I couldn't finish mine so he could scrape my bowl clean.\n\n- Confit banana on a bed of chocolate cookie crumbs and coconut sorbet. TOO FULL to eat this. Can't really remember - when you're that full, all food starts tasting the same.\n\n- petit fours included a curry chocolate truffle, milk jelly dusted with sugar and a fois gras financier. The fois gras financier was buttery and sweet with a hint of the nutty earthiness of fois gras. Yum, they should sell those by the bag.\n\nAll in all, I thought it was a unique and enjoyable experience. It's special occasion dining and although I think once was enough for me, I'm glad I finally got to try it and would definitely recommend it as a fine dining option.", "author": "Deb I."}

To the bowl's left lies a grapefruit, ginger, and tarragon aroma that the server suggested I dab on my wrist.\n\nThe beet dish looked like a snapshot from an air hockey game where the saucers were preparing to carom off a rail.\n\nThe inverted goat cheese salad was simply beautiful. Insofar as flavors and textures, they were spot on - peppery chicory, creamy goat cheese, a crisp black olive wafer, and crunchy granny smith cubes.\n\nThe viscous parsley root and green garlic soup developed a verdant green after a gentle coaxing. \n\nThe thin layer of pig's head on top of the sturgeon imparted a smokey bacon flavor. \n\nThe tofu mousseline left me floored, for how could each vegetable maintain its structural integrity with the soup's scorching temperature. \n\nPatterson's take on paella - a black and white rice porridge with abalone, mussels, and clams, - was delicious. \n\nThe beef was cooked perfectly pink and was as smooth as their in-house butter. \n\nHad they ended with the cheese course, I would have been wholly content. The barrage of desserts - kiwi shooter, blood orange curd, jasmine custard, chocolate truffle, and vanilla milkshake - were a bit too sweet by half.

There was a thin veneer of attitude when I moved a chair from one table to another without asking permission. We cooled our heels until 9:40 and yes, we were charged for the single glasses of wine we each had while waiting.\n\nThe decor was disappointing. I could see what they were going for...Asian contemporary...but the wallpaper was seams were visible and obvious leaving the feeling that attention to detail was lacking.\n\nWe were seated and noticed on the menu that a gratuity of 18% was automatically added to the charge. I don't mind paying well for excellent service but let me make that decision. We both decided to choose from the four-course dinner menu rather than the tasting menu. I started with the Winter Vegetable Salad aged sherry vinegar, mevoy olio nuovo and my dinner guest went with the Dungeness Crab,  local spinach, pomelo, coriander vinaigrette. The salad was lovely and incorporated a wild lettuce that is only available several weeks during this time of year. The crab was tender and flavorful.\n\nWe ordered a wine at the suggestion of the sommolier...a big red...Gemstone...he opined that this was the best red produced in the US and that he was involved in the blending and choice of grapes. He decanted and poured. It remained a bit tannic (a 99) and while flavorful was more an $80 bottle than the $200 we paid. \n\nThe next course brought the Cauliflower-Almond milk Soup with  young garlic, green olives and marcona almonds for my guest while I had the Roasted Atlantic Cod with manila clams, chard, borlotti beans, preserved lemon served in a covered pot. The Cod was slightly undercooked, that is, it was cooked correctly. The dish was perhaps a bit bland and could have used a bit more assertive ingredients to bring it to life.\n\nEntrees up next. I ordered the Wagyu beef with Potato foam (at a $30 premium). My guest ordered the Glazed Trumpet Mushrooms with cracked wheat 'risotto', rabe. The risotto was excellent...great texture and pungency. The beef was appropriately fatty but the potato foam was nothing more than whipped starch with a bitter taste. I tasted it and left it.\n\nDesert came next but the Meyer Lemon Meringue Pie was gone (no doubt due to the 40 minute wait we started with). My guest had a Rum Ice Cream float and enjoyed it. I went with the Warm Chocolate Custard Cake with glazed bananas, licorice ice cream andbalsamico tradizionale. The licorice ice cream was a real treat and the dish worked well.\n\nAll in all the meal was just OK but given that we spent over $500 I thought there were far better meals I could have eaten for far less. Given the reputation of this place, the attitude, the forced tip, the somewhat intrusive service...I can't recommend this place and I wont go back any time soon.", "author": "Gary C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-29", "description": "So let's start where they fell short: when the bill arrived they had added an 18% gratuity for our party of 2.  What? Are you kidding me?  For larger parties I get it.  But at this level of restaurant you need to trust your patrons to tip at an appropriate level.  Or just put the service charge in the prices and discourage tipping altogether.  It is just rude to add the service charge without informing customers up front- and even then it is wrong since gratuities are supposed to be based on the perceived level of service --- sorry, customer perceived level of servivce.  In an otherwise great evening it was a truly tacky moment.\n\nMy key complaint among higher priced restaurants in San Francisco is that many of them use their prices as a part of the experience rather than giving patrons an experience worthy of the high prices.  That is not the case here.  Coi offers a great culinary experience, supported by excellent service in an environment that suits the service and food.  \n\nIs the meal worth $145 per person?  If you can accept the idea that Coi is conveying the answer is an easy 'yes.'  The meal is built around giving you 11 creative experessions of local, seasonally appropriate food.  Each course offers truly unique combinations of ingredients to deliver, in our case, either a savory or sweet flavor experience.   And we were actually surprised that portions were large enough to appreciate each flavor completely- a couple could have been smaller and we would have been fine.\n\nTo make the meal perfect there is an optional wine pairing.  But if you don't want to pay for that there are many very reasonably priced wines by the glass or half-bottle. We chose 2 glasses of wine after consulting with our waiter.  When it looked like the first would not last, he topped it off so we wouldn't run out too soon.  That was such a great sign that it was not about upselling the patrons but really ensuring the experience was a good one. \n\nThe service, as you can tell by the above, is as good as the food.  There is never a hint that turning a table is on their minds.  Take the time you need to appreciate the meal- we were there almost 3 hours.  Not a problem.", "author": "William H."}

For one, it's a new restaurant I've been wanting to try and two, I've been reading rave reviews about this place.\n\nThe ambiance is very elegant and contemporary. Although the dining room is small, I felt like our dinner was very private. The menu offers either a 11 course tasting or a 4 course. After reviewing all the menu selections, we decided to do the 4 course. \n\nFirst of all, the service was wonderful. The staff was very professional and eloquent. I was treated like a princess throughout the entire evening.\n\nThe presentation of every dish was beautiful. I started my meal off with the Earth and Sea roasted beets spread in layers with a delicate side of cauliflower and sea beans. It was very light. Next, I had the stew of morels and nettles. I really enjoyed this dish. The morels had a good bite and the sauce was creamy, but not too rich. The third course was my main, which was lamb loin. I enjoyed this dish the most. The lamb loins were very juicy and flavored very well with a sauce that had a hint of curry.\n\nThe pacing of dinner was perfect, however, what I didn't really like was that I had my entree portion dish during the right course, but my friend had his salmon (which was his entree) for his second course. Since my second course was faster, I watched him eat his entree. And vice versa, as I ate my entree, he watched me because his portions for his third course was a lot smaller. In my opinion, our courses should have been the same portions so we are eating at the same pace. \n\nFor dessert, there were only two choices, so of course, I got to try both. I had the cherve cheesecake with caramel and strawberry sorbet. I was a bit disappointed that it was all cheese and no cake. Since I'm not a huge cheese fan, I didn't care for it too much. I really enjoyed the other dessert though. It was a warm chocolate pudding cake with malt ice cream. It was really good. The cake was so moist and decadent, but not too rich. I loved the malt ice cream.. yummy.\n\nOur meal ended with a tiny chocolate Madeline and a shot of malt flavor milk shake. That was delicious!!\n\nOverall, I thought the food was good, but not fabulous like all the reviews. For the $$, I had a lot higher expectations. Although the service was great, I didn't think the food warranted the price. I think Coi is a great experience, but I probably won't go back.", "author": "Denise L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-03-23", "description": "I went to Coi last week and found it to be extremely disappointing.  At the price point, I expected a great dinner or at least, a very good one.  Instead, I found that the meal was lackluster, uninspired, and unsatisfying.\n\nSERVICE & AMBIENCE\nThe restaurant itself is cozy and stylish, with beautiful cushions, some nice paintings, and good lighting.  Coi is also extremely small, which helps creates a refined, intimate experience.  The lack of windows in the dining room may be somewhat oppressive, but it helps mask the fact that passersby are headed to the strip joint at the corner of the street.  Service at the restaurant is acceptable but not great, especially given the price point and the hefty mandatory service charge.  We arrived before our table was ready, and the hostess left us standing around for several minutes without offering us seats at the bar, even though it was completely empty.  Our waitress was friendly, but not particularly attentive.\n\nFOOD\n\nAlthough the tasting menu featured 11 courses, this was somewhat deceptive.  Most of the dishes came out the size of amuse bouche, including one dish which consisted of two thin slices of cheese, a dish that featured a few thin carrots in a citrus seasoning, and a small bowl which had maybe four tablespoons of runny panna cotta.  My dinner mates and I filled up on bread throughout dinner to compensate for the tiny portions, but even so, found ourselves driving to grab a quick dinner right after we left Coi.  Warning to the hungry:  $135 here won't fill you up.\n\nThere seemed to be two themes of the dinner that night:  wild flowers and sour flavors.  More than half of the dishes were sprinkled with various types of flowers, including edible flowers in some dishes, sourgrass bits in another dish, and one dish garnished with a twig of cherry blossoms.  In addition, I counted strong vinaigrettes in four dishes, lemon juice in three other dishes, and strong sour flavors in almost all of the remaining dishes (except the second dessert, an oatmeal ice cream cookie that thankfully was not sour).\n\nIt seems like Coi's dishes were exercises in palate-cleansing.  Other than vinegar and citrus, the dishes did not have a lot of rich flavors.  And although the tartness was initially fresh, it quickly wore thin.  In the first dish, the sour mandarin juice was refreshing even though it felt more like a teaser than a real course.  A subsequent oyster dish, however, was so vinegary that I could barely taste the oysters themselves.  By the fourth dish, a buttermilk panna cotta faintly reminiscent of spoiled yogurt, the tartness was getting old.  Bits of sourgrass ruined what would have been an otherwise acceptable mushroom soup.  And the cheese course comprised two thin slices of an unpasteurized cow's milk cheese and maybe six tiny shreds of butter lettuce drowned in pungent vinaigrette.  What is the use of having eleven courses if they all end up tasting the same?\n\nI was also surprised that the restaurant decided to charge such a high premium for extremely common ingredients.  Other than the raw oyster dish and another dish consisting of slivers of deep fried abalone (again, with in a tart dressing), the rest of the ingredients seemed commonplace and cheap.  I understand that their vegetables are largely local and organic, but other similar restaurants with an emphasis on fresh foods, such as Chez Panisse and Manresa, have cheaper options and feature fewer but much larger, more satisfying portions.\n\nI can imagine that Coi appeals to a very small subset of people:  Those who appreciate small and generally cold portions of bland, tart and mostly vegetarian fare.  However, considering the dining room only has a single set menu every night without any flexibility to choose your own dishes, you better make sure that you fit that palate profile before you book your reservation.\n\nOVERALL RECOMMENDATION:\n\nIf you eat like a bird, then Coi might be the place for you.  But for us, $135 plus tax and service was far too much for lemons, vinegar, and flowers--even if they do happen to be organic.", "author": "Michael W."}

I stopped here for a quick bite (read: apps in the lounge) and wine before heading to a party. Our waiter was great except for the fact that when we asked him what he recommended on the menu, he just read off every selection and described in more detail. Uhhh no favorites?\n\nAnyway, we just shared a few plates, so without trying the tasting menu, this review doesn't quite do it justice. I'll need to go back for that. The cod was great, steak dish was good although not memorable and the tomato tartine was so boring to me - just a few cherry tomatoes in between two little, albeit yummy, crackers. Tried a chenin blanc that was great. The chef also prepared a little amuse bouche of frozen organic yogurt, frozen beet and frozen meringue, which tasted like flowers! Not my style. My friend's drink also tasted like flowers. And not in a good way. Ew.\n\nI'll have to go back to be fair, and see if the flower theme continues.

We've loved the food at Elizabeth Daniel and enjoyed going out to Frisson so I looked forward to dining at Daniel Patterson's latest venue. While it's a good looking space, and the service was attentive, at $105/person for the tasting menu, the food would need to be off the charts to warrant that pricing. 10 courses later (plus two amuse courses) we have a couple of observations:\n\n(1) Daniel Patterson loves scents. (He wrote a cookbook called Aroma.) I believe he's so enamored with different aromas that his dished are over-scented. A lavender/rhubarb frappe in a shot glass was overpoweringly lavendery. Tasmanian ocean trout with vanilla (flown in fresh from Tasmania daily) was exotic, but \"overvanilled\". The kumquat/fennel salad along with it was great however. The vebena foam (aka bubblebath) over the veal was just too much.\n(2) I just didn't like several of the dishes. The chilled spiced ratattouille soup was left untouched. The pappardelle chanterelles with coconut milk and kiefer lime was overpoweringly salted. Daniel loves salt. It's used almost too liberally.\n(3) Coi adds 18 percent in as a tip. Automatically. I wonder whether they don't trust us as diners or whether they don't trust their service level? I frankly was underwhelmed with the service. They were nice enough to bring a scoop of ice cream with a candle to celebrate the occasion, but then we noticed another $4 on the bill for the gesture. I guess at 30 seats you have to extract every last dollar.\n\nMy verdict? Go for a few of the dishes in the lounge area. Peek into the tiny dining room. And next time you want to spend $400 on dinner, go to Masa's or one of the true 4 star dining establishments in SF. This is trendy food, in a trendy venue but unfortunately priced at 4 star pricing.

I qualify this statement below, but it's definitely true if you are looking for a unique food experience.\n\nThe service is as good as it gets. The presentation of the food leaves nothing to be desired.\n\nThe decor is stylish, even though in a slightly 70s James Bond kind of way. Sitting towards the wall, I couldn't help but notice the slightly bent-out-of-shape light cover. I also noticed the very cool vegetable CAT scans.\n\nDon't expect to be fed. The courses are tiny, and even though they are many, you will leave hungry if you come hungry. That is not a bad thing, but be warned.\n\nNow that we covered the basics, here's the important part:\n\nYou don't have much choice here, there are some options on the prix fixe menu, but not too many. The hardest choice you'll be facing is the wine (if you don't go with the wine pairing). The wine pairing was good, if unorthodox (including a beer, which I personally enjoyed). \n\nCoi has a thing about essential oils in food. The first course comes with a drop of perfume to use on yourself. In some courses, essential oils are quite obviously used for flavor, while in others, they were too subtle to discern (at least for me, or maybe there were none). Whether or not you agree with using essence of anything in cooking is up to you, but the concept worked for me. \n\nOtherwise, the food is in the tradition of molecular gastronomy. Yes, I know it's sooo 2003 and yes, putting milk and honey in jelly skin to suspend it in a ball doesn't change the fact that it's still just milk and honey. I for one really enjoy the inventiveness, and I value it more than just the perfect execution of a traditional dish. If you want the latter go to Michael Mina (but stick to the classics), or Gary Danko (for the cheese). I feel that the food at Coi is as well executed, and more interesting. \n\nFinally, some details:\n\nThe bread that is served is terrific. Try to discern what it tastes like. I couldn't pin it down. I was underwhelmed by the lamb. It seemed generic after what I had before, and would have afterward. The cold pea soup was great. The absolute highlight of the evening though was the poached sturgeon. The menu has probably already changed, so all of this won't be very helpful to you.\n\nIn summary: Go there and eat.

Before coming to COI, the Restaurant at Meadowood had been our best meal - it has now been surpassed (though perhaps by only a hair).  \n\nAtmosphere - Definitely sit in the lounge as opposed to the dining room because 1) you can order off both the tasting menu and regular menu (more food choices) and 2) the atmosphere is very chill.  Definitely none of the pretentiousness you find at Masa's or Gary Danko.  Note that OpenTable only takes reservations for the dining room, so for a reservation for the lounge you will actually have to call the restaurant.  And yes, the location in the midst of strip club row sucks - but once the food started rolling out, it was impossible to even remember that we were on that nasty section of Broadway.\n\nService - excellent.  Our server was sweet and friendly. They don't ask you how you're enjoying the meal every 15 minutes (when you are doing an 11-course tasting menu, this gets annoying).  The bf had ordered the tasting menu and I ordered 3 separate things off the menu, but they ended up bringing me another 3 full dishes off the tasting menu on the house (at least $40 worth of food) - very unexpected and great.  \n\nFood - the cucumber/melon dish (second item on the tasting menu) is out of this world.  Cucumber, potato, creme fraiche - I still can't get it out of my mind.  What really made COI stand head and shoulders above the other fine dining restaurants is this: there were some truly amazing seafood dishes which rocked my world, and I don't even like seafood! The grilled abalone was delicate yet complex.  The smoked black cod over leeks and beet reduction was probably the singular best piece of fish I have ever tasted.  The cod brandade (ordered at the bf's request despite the fact that he was already getting the tasting menu) was so good I didn't even want to share it.  It's basically a creamy puree'ed cod dip baked with perfectly spiced bread crumbs - who would have ever thought that puree'ed fish could be good?  Additionally, we practically wanted to lick the plate of the white chocolate cream / cocoa / raspberry dessert - and neither of us like white chocolate.  There were two dishes that we did not care for: the mushroom flan (texture is too smooth) and the cheese plate.  This was the first restaurant where I have ordered a \"cheese plate\" and received literally cheese on a plate and nothing else.  I could have walked over to a cheese store and replicated that at home, so it's pretty inappropriate to have a dish like this at a Michelin-rated restaurant.  We were at Frascati (Russian Hill) last week and they offered a $7 cheese plate that is paired with various fruits, nuts, and jellies - that is how a cheese plate is supposed to be done.  Still, in a meal of no less than 16 separate dishes (including a fabulous amuse of strawberry root beer soda), the fact that I have only 2 criticisms to the food (which is the most important metric in a restaurant review) is an accomplishment.  In sum, the food here was memorable because 1) it is objectively incredible in its own right and 2) it was incredible despite the fact that we/I usually don't care for some of the main ingredients that were used.  \n\nPrices - Extremely reasonable for a restaurant of this caliber.  11-course tasting menu: $135.  A la carte items: between $10-25.  Corkage: $25.  Note that 18% gratuity is added to the bill regardless of party size. \n\nCOI gets 5 stars for its outstanding food, great service, good atmosphere, and very decent prices for what is being delivered.

The lounge is quite comfortable and still serves food- just a limited menu- so we enjoyed some of their distilled fruit and herb waters while we waited.

We were a little curious about the delay- but the sommelier and the matre d' both visited our table at regular intervals to assure us that we'd be taken care of shortly. \n\nSomehow the 25-35 minutes in the lounge passed pleasantly and quickly and I barely noticed I was kept waiting.  The sommelier kept the Capichera flowing.  About 40 minutes after our reservation time, the matre d' came over and apologised and said that just after we arrived, she had asked a couple seated at the bar if they were Cameo et.al, and they had said \"yes\" and had been seated at our table in the main dining room, and since they just had a last minute cancellation of the private dining room, would we mind if we were seated in the there and given our own private wait staff in recompense for our wait?\n\nWe were quite happy at this turn of events and were subsequently seated in this beautiful room, tastefully decorated and well-turned out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-17", "description": "This is more of a dining experience than a \"eat to get full\" meal.  The 11 course were well proportioned and well thought out.  I do believe that they use the freshest local ingredients from farmer's markets when they say it.  It should be 4.5 stars but I'll round up.  I subtracted half a star because I would actually prefer more poultry or seafood dishes.  Of course the menu changes accordingly so I would probably return for a more protein rich season.  My friends and I went during the spring/summer season so most of the dishes leaned toward the vegetarian side.\n\nLet's start with (I believe was) the ricotta cheese.  It was rich and creamy, not to strong or sharp.  I'm not a big fan of plain cheese but this was very memorable to my pallate.  Next on the list was the geoduck.  The cucumbers bring a cool flavor to the geoduck.  Not everyone enjoys it, but I found the flavors to be refreshing.  The next dish was potatoes served in a rich sauce.  This dish didn't really excite me, but it had an intriguing taste.  I don't quite remember what was in it, but it was presented very uniquely.  Next up is the English pea soup.  This distinctive dish was sweet and rejuvenating.  The soup consistency was not too thick and not too watery.  Up next was a mushroom dish.  It was a bit on the salty side and not to memorable.   The sixth dish was a baby carrot salad.  I didn't expect much from this dish, but the mix of spices actually brought out a lot of flavors.  I could taste a bit of cayenne and paprika.  Onto the next dish:  what seemed to be a soft boiled egg in a ramen-like mushroom sauce.  This dish is one of my favorites, yet it gave me strong cravings for  ramen later that night.  The next dish was the steak tartar.  The beef was tender and rich with flavor from the onions and spices.  The ninth dish was another cheese.  This was a much sharper cheese but did not overpower with the vinegary taste usually associated with sharp cheeses.  Onto the desserts!  First up was the unpasteurized vanilla ice cream accompanied with fresh blueberries and carmelized sugar.  I really enjoyed this dish.  The icecream was not too sweet and very smooth.  The blueberries matched very well with the sweetness of the icecream.  And onto our final dessert was a chocolate cake with more unpasteurized vanilla ice cream.  This chocolate cake leaned toward of dark chocolate than of semi-sweet morsels usually used to make cakes.  It was more bitter and richer though.  I didn't mind because I prefer dark chocolate.\n\nThe service is great and the furniture was very contemporary.  The restrooms were very peaceful and serene.  The lights are dim and they even have aroma-therapy stones in the sink!  It's so sensual I almost got romantic with myself in there.  Bahahaha.\n\nIt's a very excellent experience and I would love to try their current menu consisting of : tomato tarts, onion soup, black cod, abalone, chicken, lamb", "author": "Ricky H."}

For a hefty price, Coi provides an 11-course meal of the some of the best dishes you've never had.  Almost nothing on this menu felt familiar and everything that I loved was tremendous because it reminded me of almost no other dish I've tasted.  While this avant-garde culinary art doesn't meet its lofty goals with every dish, most of the dishes were very memorable and totally made up for the dishes that didn't succeed.\n\nThe experience is designed around the full tasting menu.  To miss out on this meticulously ordered experience by going with the 4-course a la carte option is to miss out on the whole reason to go to Coi.  Each dish is very small (and often served in pointlessly large ceramic dishes that dwarf the food) and contains a world of flavor condensed into a small package.   \n\nI loved my experience here, though if you have trepidation about spending over $300 for dinner for two and aren't looking branch out your tasting experiences too far, the other ultra-fancy restaurants in the city (Michael Mina, Gary Danko, etc) might be safer bets.  But if you are interested in food that is like no other, not just food that is better than others, Coi provides this in spades.\n\nThe service was very impressive.  The wait staff was affable and familiar without being too casual and very helpful in helping us navigate a menu filled with entirely unfamiliar options and ingredients.  It has a quite interior with very comfortable seats, even if the chairs have a strangely austere grey fabric.\n\nA few dishes had flavors that required some acclimation, and with portions this small you don't get the opportunity to acclimate your palate, but most new flavors tasted terrific on first bite.  And two dishes in the middle were pretty disappointing, but a few dishes that don't work is a small price to pay for all the successful risks amidst the rest.  And if you are interested in food for thought, almost every dish serves as perfect think piece.\n\nSince Yelp limits you to 5,000 characters and my full review with menu item descriptions is around 10,000 characters, you can check out my full review on Menuism if you want detailed info on each item:\nhttp://www.menuism.com/reviews/57350-unprecedented-culinary-experience\n\nBent Spoon Marshmallow - with avocado and kumquat\n4 stars\n\nValencia Orange - with green olive sorbet\n5 stars\n\nCalifornia Osetra Caviar - slow-cooked farm egg yolk, crme fraiche, chives\n4 stars\n\nGazpacho Parfait\n3 stars\n\nFull Bellied Heirloom Potatoes - with olive oil\n1 star\n\nCorn-Brioche Custard -  huitlachoche foam\n3 stars\n\nYuba 'Papardelle' - English peas, fava leaves, basil\n4 stars\n\nAji and Japanese Turnip - with roman fermented anchovy sauce\n2 stars\n\nPoached And Seared Guinea Hen - vadouvan, fresh and shelling beans\n4 stars\n\nFizzy Casaba Melon Soda\n4 stars\n\nPoached Fig - with lavender honey and cheese\n4 stars\n\nChilled Strawberry-Watermelon Soup - rose geranium, long pepper ice cream\n5 stars\n\nOlive Oil Milkshake -  with Caramelized Cookie, cocoa nibs\n5 stars\n\nWarm Chocolate Cake - with avocado ganache, lemon grass coconut foam\n4 stars\n\nPlum Pate de Fruit - with mini pistachio cakes\n4 stars", "author": "Tom W."}

I started with the fava beans, which were delicious, and had just a little bit of kick, but not too overwhelming. I followed up with the chicken, which was simple, but cooked PERFECTLY. I have never seen such a beautiful piece of chicken. Seriously. My boyfriend had the duck...the portion they gave him was absolutely ridiculous! I'm not a huge eater, but I would have been starving after finishing that thing. We finished up with the bourbon ice cream. Bourbon ice cream...yeah, it rocked my world. \n\nThe interior is absolutely beautiful...quite the sanctuary off of Broadway. Service was professional and friendly. LOVED the sommelier.

Just rub a little oil on the hand that you eat with and as you lift your food to your mouth, utensil optional, you can whiff the oil as you taste your food which in my case was a weird, but awesome experience.\n\nThe wine paring is also a bit spendy ($95), but shit, you're already committing 120 for dinner, why not get drunk while you're at it?", "author": "Mike T."}

The dishes were excellent and the service was even better. We were served by all the wait staff as it is a group effort at this restaurant but our favorite was Thomas, the assistant sommelier. Incredibly knowledgeable about wine and wine pairing, funny, charming and cute! A very winning combination. \n\nThere is another option for dining here if you don't want to spend about 3 hours drinking and eating. There is the front lounge area which is incredibly cool looking and super confortable. Here you can order a la carte and wines by the glass. Pay close attention to what your order though.

I expected an experience on par with GD & M2, and the other great restaurants of the area, and was left with a massive bill, and the odd note of hunger pains in my stomach.\n\nIt's simple really, when I pay just under $600 (for o'girl and I with wine pairings), I expect an experience worthy of $600.\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Service - Nothing short of spectacular.  They employ a small army (at least in comparison to the size of the dining room) and they are constantly attending you, even when you hit the restroom!\n-The Goat Cheese/Beet Dish - This was the dish that I thought the whole meal would be like.  Complex flavors, interesting textures, incredible presentation.  But unfortunately it was not to be.\n-The Abalone Dish - Fantastic.  Hands down the show stopper.  But that's the problem, at that point you have like 5 or 6 more dishes, and there really isn't anything else to compare.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n-The Bill - My God.  I knew what I was getting myself into, and if it had been one of those transcendent experiences, then I would have gladly paid, but.....it just wasn't.\n-The Overall Menu - 2 Desserts, A shaved ice starter (really?), and a bunch of veggies or faux proteins (I hardly count the egg as substantive).  The mushroom dish consisted of 1 slice of mushroom.  Seriously?  A dish of carrots.....seriously?  2 measly oysters?\n-The Wine Pairings - This was potentially the most disappointing part of the night.  Though they went OK, with each dish, there was never that Wow factor.  You know when the wine and the food complement each other in ways you never expect?  It simply didn't happen once.  Not to mention, the pairing skips the cheese dish, and then you are left with 2 dessert wines.  I'll admit, I really am not a dessert wine guy, but gah, it just was the perfect topper to a super disappointing evening.\n\nSoooo disappointing.........", "author": "Andrew M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-05-27", "description": "In my view the good restaurant consists of good ambience, not too overly attentive waiters, quality of food that collates to the price.  From that point of view, Coi was ok.\n\nIt started as a mere curiosity... I did a story on Michelin guide in Tokyo, and in my view it is very very parochial, and not necessarily reflect the real quality of the restaurant.  Yet, Tokyo has the second most three-start restaurants next to Paris... \nAfter much  disappointment by SF restaurants, I decided to try Coi, the only two-star restaurant in SF.( I do not think I will visit French Laundry... it is too far to somebody who does not drive... and of course it is REALLY expensive.)  My parents were visiting and my father tried every three-star restaurant in France...\n\nAmbience is nice, of course, not surprised by this kind of restaurant, except for its location... RED LIGHT DISTRICT.  I thought customer per waiter ratio was higher than any other restaurants.  The waiters were knowledgeable of what they were serving, too, which of course if expected in this kind of restaurants.\n\nAs for food... I would have to say it was interesting.  It was a similar experience that I had in Wakiya, a french nouveau infused restaurant in Tokyo...Each potion was very small, I would not say too small, because they had many dishes.  Surprisingly, many dishes were influenced by Japanese food.  Seaweed, Tofu, almost raw food... I would have to say that the quality and freshness of material, especially vegetables, were no comparison to any other restaurants in  SF.  But which makes me question... Is it something hard to do in our home.  I liked asparagus.  I liked salad... But the problems is I cannot remember the detail of the food, which I usually do if I really liked the restaurant... My mother, the best cook ever, probably emulate some of the dishes if she has fresh enough material.\nMaybe this kind of restaurants are novel to Americans or some French    Michelin evaluators, however, it is still a conundrum for me why it has gotten two stars from Michelin.  I did not say the portion of the dishes are not TOO small, because it has calculated each meal meticulously so that the guest will have satisfactory dining experience with many fresh ingredients, which is plausible.  So after finishing the full course, there was a medley of comfortable experience. \nIt is quite difficult to rate this restaurant, because I did like it. But I do not think I would return.  It was just too expensive.  It cost almost $800 for three people...well it was a graduation dinner for me... \nIt was an experience, but for two-star, I am not sure it is worth it... I mean my family would pay anything to have any food that are super good with justifiable price, but still the experience at the restaurant was merely interesting not sensational as some people say, and convinced that Michelin stars should not be trusted...I hate myself still curious about the restaurants based on the stars, knowing it does not really tell anything... \nIf you are a curious foodie who are not deceived by mere starts, you should visit this interesting restaurant and judge it yourself.  If you are a person who pretend to be a foodie, this place is a great place to boast to your friend just because you dined there.", "author": "Ayako M."}

I teetering between giving Coi three or four stars, but went with three because although the food was good, it wasn't as memorable as some four star meals I have had.\n\nWe ate in the lounge so I didn't actually see the dining room.  The lounge area is both retro and modern looking at the same time.  It was decorated with lots of wood and earthy colors.  The booths had shaggy pillows on them.  The tabletops resembled thinly sliced tree stumps.  I think the lounge is better suited for couples or tables of four or less.  There is a large window overlooking Broadway.  \n\nWe started out with a great bottle of the Sadie Family Columella from South Africa.  I'm not a fan of red wine myself, but my friends thought it was pretty amazing.  Later in the evening, we ordered a bottle of the Clos del Rey Cotes du Roussillon which my friends didn't like as much as the first bottle, but still thought it was very good.  Coi has a pretty extensive wine selection so wine lovers should keep this place in mind.\n\nI liked dining in the lounge because you can order from both the lounge menu and al la carte from the dining room menu.  The dining room serves a prix fixe menu so I was glad to be able to pick and choose with any restrictions.  The prix fixe is $115 per person (4 courses is $85) so the dining room would have been a pretty pricey affair for a random Tuesday night.\n\nI ordered the corn brioche custard ($12) which was fantastic!  It was very unique and everyone at the table liked it.  The udon with mushroom broth ($12) was good, but nothing special.  The pork rilettes ($10) was interesting as I had never had something like it before.  It reminded me of chunky pate.  Since I love pate, I loved this dish.  We also ordered a couple meat dishes:  the Niman Ranch slow cooked pork ($17) and the Prather Ranch sirloin.  Both were well cooked and juicy.  I could tell Coi uses some high quality meats.\n\nI really liked the desserts.  We split the chilled strawberry watermelon soup ($10) and some sort of chocolate cake ($10).  The cake was fine, but the soup was amazing!  It was very light and refreshing.  This dessert came with some pepper ice cream which contrasted the sweetness of the soup.  I thought it was very unique and highly recommend it!\n\nOverall, I thought the food at Coi was good and I liked being able to sit in a more casual setting while still ordering fancy food.

I found the effusive and passionate staff mostly endearing and infectious albeit at times provincial.  The were, however, accommodating with their menu and skilled and enthusiastic with menu progression and pairing.  I started with the Dungeness Crab Salad, far less interesting than my companion's Scallop Tartare--at least in description.  While, the salad was fabulous, the tartare was a huge disapointment.  It was obscure, imbalanced, and overly citrused (probably to keep the avocado mousse from browning) overpowering the delicate scallop tartare.\n\nFour our next courses, I had the Hokkaido Scallop while my friend had the Yuba Papardelle.  Again, I had the winning dish; the scallop was flavorful and sublime but the papardell over-seasoned and uninteresting.  My dessert course was probably the highlight of my meal: Meyer Lemon Meringue Pie, ginger snap, celery sorbet.  The meringue pie was lovely and celery sorbet was beautiful subtle.  My friend chose a mascarpone item off the tasting menu that was puny and disappointment, particularly juxtaposed next to my dish.  She wanted to work her menu around this item and while the waiter was gracious in suggesting pairings, he really should have dissuaded her from culminating in this two bite dish.\n\nA couple of final \"gifts\" from the chefs came -- all lovely-- but my favorite was the hot milk and chocolate.

The decor is all textures in a soothing brown pallette.  The small dining room is intimate and you can actually have a conversation.  The bar area out front is attractive and designed for interaction.  Service was very good but with a couple long pauses in between courses.  The table next to us sat down at the same time we did and finshed about 20-30 minutes before us.  We would be on the same course, but they would have their dishes and finish while we would be waiting.  Anyway, minor quibble but you don't expect it at a place like this.  Also the wait staff should give at least some explanation of the complex food.  Often they would speak quickly in a hushed tone and I couldn't make out a thing.  \n\nThen on to the food.  We did the 11 course tasting menu.  This is a restaurant that wants to push the envelope and be on the cutting edge.  I respect that.  But to be on the cutting edge just to be on the cutting edge doesn't quite work for me.  Sometimes the food just seemed needlessly complex as if that was what Daniel Patterson was going for.  The foams, the deconstruction, the this the that, it was a little bit much.  Don't get me wrong the quality is top notch and much of the food was exquisite.  But occasionally there were misses such as the grey foam that made one dish look like something on the menu at SF General.  Then there was the sea salt which, while good, was used on just about everything.  \n\nMy take is they are trying too hard.  For this price range, I'm happy going to Gary Danko and Michael Minna.

I had an amazing and most memorable birthday dinner here 2 years ago.   \n\nCoi is another one of those hidden, yet known about gems in the San Francisco's restaurant treasure chest.   My then boyfriend kept saying \"Daniel Patterson\", \"Daniel Patterson\", \"We have to go check out Daniel Patterson's Restaurant Coi\".  Now there are a lot of chef personalities we have just had to go out and check out, but Coi truly has taken the cake - or better yet - the early girl tomato.  \n\nThe menu was whimsical, clever, and well thought out.  We took a wine flight that was hosted by the most suave Sommelier, in possibly the finest suit I have ever seen a man wear.  Daniel Patterson?  I'm sure we came here to meet a \"Daniel\", and I think our wine was served by \"The\" Daniel Craig himself.  I recall \"early girl tomatoes\" being an ingredient on one of our dishes.  Now I shop at the Berkeley Farmer's Markets and know an \"early girl\" varietal tomato like a good buddy.  However the magic that is Coi turns something such as a tomato and turns that tomato into something completely unexpected (like a clear colored gelatin)  where this tomato note comes back to remind that you saw it somewhere on your menu \"earlier\".   Simple or Complex, these flavor notes are going to reveal themselves to you with originality.   Coi's menu is just flat out creative.  Course after course the dancing delights just kept coming, Chef Daniel Patterson is whispering something in your ear.  There is a subtle story this food will tell you, if you listen closely.   \n\nI'd say dining at Coi is an experience you have to at least try once in your life, and if you'd be most fortunate have a second.

I wouldn't come here unless you wanted a true dining experience.  If you want a decent quantity of food for the same amount of money, go elsewhere!  I came to Coi expecting the worse, but left very pleasantly surprised & throughly enjoying our evening.  The food is highly innovative, the decor is earthy & soothing, & the service is impeccable.\n\nWe did the 11-course dinner, which took 3 1/2 hours.  Thankfully, the 11 courses were relatively small, but extremely tasty & different.  My personal favorites were the yuba, suzuki, & guinea fowl as well as the desserts (chilled strawberry soup & chocolate cake), but all the plates were beautifully presented & delicious.  My husband personally liked the corn brioche, which was good, but I had to eat around the grey-blue mushroom foam since I'm not a huge fan of mushrooms.  Between courses the servers walk around with bread, which I more than ate my share of!\n\nService was excellent!  The sommelier made (according to my husband) excellent wine recommendations--a 1997 white burgundy & a 2002 red burgundy, & he was very accommodating to my pregnancy, offering a very yummy peach & thyme soda that the chef had whipped up for the evening.  Our servers perfectly timed each course & even politely waited for us to finish up our conversation before they described each course.\n\nOverall, it was quite the unique dining experience.

While I would not say $75 is an inexpensive meal (pre tax/tip, beverages), I think it is a very fair value given the quality of the food and the service.\n\ni found the service professional, helpful and although this sounds mega stuffy \"appropriate given the ambiance\".  Sometimes, I'm kinda annoyed by overly casual service - (eg: a waiter says \"too full to finish, huh??\" when they clear away 1/2 eaten dessert plates.  It's awkward to say \"no, just not all that great) and at the same time, I hate feeling like a meal is so formal it is not fun.\n\nCoi has a good feel and the food is really special. I feel very happy for this chef, to have found a place that seems to fit him so well.\n\nIt's nice that some of the \"far out\" pieces of the meal - eg; the special oils you rub on your wrists to elevate the experience - are given gratis as amuse bouches (of which there are several).  That way, you get to experience the funky touches that make this place unique, without feeling \"ripped off\".  You can actually just sit back and enjoy the eccentricities.  \n\nThe menu changes pretty often, it seems, but if you go soon and see any of the dishes below, I highly recommend them all!!\n\n- Ratattouille Soup (a very creamy, 3 colored soup.  elegant and delicous)\n- tuna and tomato tartarte - if you've given up on this dish, you may consider trying it here. \n- Glazed trumpet mushrooms on cracked wheat risotto - this is a very delicious dish but if you are sensitive to butter, don't get it.  If you do, lap it up.\n- Suckling pig\n- Cheese course with several Adante Dairy selections\n\nCorkage is a reasonable $20/bottle, no limit, waived for every bottle purchased.

All of the dishes were solid, and some (e.g., the scallop raviolo, the pig's head, the salmon, and the chevre cheesecake)  were fantastic.  The pistachio marshmallow amuse bouche was amusing.  And the salmon was tender and done just right.  \n\nThe service was competent and friendly -- not at all snooty.  We actually preferred the wait staff at Coi to that of the French Laundry on our last visit, which struck as stiff and too into the food.\n\nSo why 3 stars?  Two reasons:  price & ambience.  For $115, one should not finish the 11-course prix fixe meal feeling hungry.  (Actually, no one ever should feel hungry after 11 courses anywhere.)  Add the $85 pairing, you're looking at $200 a head and $500+ for two -- as gratuity is a mandatory 18% minimum.  (The wine list is surprisingly reasonable, though, and the sommelier was friendly and did not try to push the priciest wines.)\n\nThe ambience also is a bit odd.  From the outside, you would think that Coi was a bar.  From the inside, you wonder at first whether you were seated in the overflow dining room -- and then you realize that it's the only dining room.  The room is small, with a low ceiling and without windows.  This isn't a ding on the designers -- the space has inherent problems.  \n\nThe price/food quantity issue is easy to fix:  Increase the starch quotient in a few of the dishes to increase the calories, and pass out some petit fours gratis when you leave the check.  The ambience issue is harder to fix, though.", "author": "Rich H."}

And though I subscribe to nearly every foodie magazine out there and salivate at the spectacular-sounding dishes that are served in establishments like Coi, I wouldn't have dreamed of eating here even two years ago. I would have been too scared of what would show up on the menu.\n\nFalling in love with Unbuntu last year helped me prove to myself that I could overcome all manner of squishy, mushroomy, quail egg-y food hurdles, so when my best friend suggested we toss Coi on our list of \"try these\" restaurants, I agreed. And that brings us to last night.\n\nAfter reading what seems like a gazillion reviews and articles, I assumed that Coi would be an interesting experience with above average food at an astronomical price. Two out of three ain't bad! It was, indeed, the most expensive meal I've eaten in recent memory. And it was, indeed, an interesting experience (as others have noted, the scented oils, minimalist decor, swarm of servers attending to my every whim). But the food far exceeded my expectations.\n\nPretty much everything on the 11-course tasting menu was astonishing in it's own way. The one low point was the abalone, which raised the hair on my neck with its chewiness and was bathed in a...tart? grassy?...some kind of sauce that didn't really do it for me. Everything else, though. Woah.\n\nThe milk & honey amuse-bouche was both adorable and delightful. With the exception of one wine with a funky nose I just couldn't get past, the pairings were perfect. (The group at the table next to us LOVED the same wine.) The \"baked Alaska, reconsidered\" was mind-bogglingly good, its almond crumble and burnt sugar being things I will dream of for days. I scarfed down foams and flowers and seeds and goat and all manner of crispy, crunchy bits -- and was sad to consume the last bite of each.\n\nI can't wait to go back in the fall and see what appears with a whole new set of fresh ingredients for Chef Patterson to play with.

Restaurants hate it (Coi owner/chef Daniel Patterson was rather vocal about his distaste for V-Day patrons on his Twitter, in fact), and maybe it shows.  While I had a good experience at Coi, it wasn't the damn near perfect dining experience I was anticipating.  But, let's start with the good stuff...\n\nThe atmosphere: Excellent.  The decor, the lighting, the tableware and flatware were all top notch.  The vibe of the place was really quiet and mellow and all around wonderful.  The little gift of the Coi fragrance was also a nice touch.\n\nThe food: Great.  I don't think there was anything that completely blew my mind (and there were a couple of duds (I didn't love the tofu mousseline)) but the food was on the whole delicious.  The pairings (which included a lovely Belgian ale (I always appreciate non-wine pairings)) were good, though not great (Gary Danko still gets my vote for best pairings in the city).  As for the food, the douglas fir ice cream was delish, the soup with braised snails was so good (if you've only eaten escargots, you need to try snails not slathered in garlic and butter), and the beef was amazingly high quality and cooked to perfection.\n\nNow the stuff I wasn't thrilled with: I called a week before my reservation to ask if anything was going to be different for Valentine's Day.  I was assured it was business as usual.  However, when we arrived, we saw the tasting menu was $55/per person more than on a regular night.  Boo!\n\nThe service: Not the best.  We arrived a few minutes early and sat in the lounge.  We were brought a drink menu and proceeded to wait...and wait...and wait...all while two or three staff members (including the person who brought us the menu) walked past us, made eye contact, and walked on.  Okie dokie.  Bummer.  Also, there were some slip-ups during the meal itself.  Twice we were brought the wrong dish.  Once they realised before they put the dish down.  The second time they put the little pot down, opened the lids, and then realised...and then proceeded to take them directly to the table next to us.  Whoa.  Also, despite a fair bit of time between courses, they forgot to bring the wine before the dish once.  Not huge things, generally speaking, but in a two-starred restaurant, it's sort of unacceptable.  It didn't hinder my enjoyment of my meal, but it's worth mentioning.  The staff was very efficient and businesslike.  There was no real chit-chat or relaxed vibe from any of the servers, which, to me, is always a bummer.  They were very helpful getting us a cab at the end of the night and not rushing us, as we were the last party in the restaurant, though.\n\nSo, after the $55/person surcharge and tip, the meal came out to over $700 for two.  That's damn near French Laundry price!  I'd say on a regular non-V-Day night the price would be worth it, though.", "author": "Cristina S."}

The stuff I didn't like as much was pretty delicious (someone got a little wayward with the salt in a couple of things, throwing off the delicate balance of flavors). And the stuff I did like (almost everything) was beyond words. This is a great trek for a foodie or a nice place for a special occasion with an adventurous eater. Plan to take your time. The eleven course meal took us almost four hours to get through. There were also extra offering both to begin and end the meal, so there were really thirteen small courses in the offering (three desserts yeah!). The menu is veggie heavy, with some seafood and only one red meat offering (lamb). MY favorite dish by far was an asparagus panna cotta that was silky and scrumptious. The top layer of coconut cream hid a creamy pale green delight spiked with cilantro and lime. Who knew eating your vegetables could be so fun! The nettle soup was equally delightful. Poured at the table, it included a dumpling made of ricotta enrobed in lemon gelee and oxalis flowers. Another major highlight was the criolo chocolate confection that featured tiny glazed strawberries and a licorice Crme anglaise. Red meat eaters will love the lamb (cooked two ways), served with spinach and caramelized baby turnips. One warning though, at $120 per person--not including tax and gratuity--the restaurant's not cheap. It is worth it. So if you are a lowly nonprofit drudge (like me) or a civil servant, plan ahead a bit. If you want to do the wine pairings, add another $95 (and include an 18% gratuity). Most of what we had is currently listed on the website, but the actual menu changes daily.  If you want to select your own wines, the sommelier is really helpful (and amusing). In terms of service, it's excellent (think old school French). The setting is serene (lots of beige, with modern art and Asian accents). The music was a bit disjointed (Radiohead and Louis Armstrong), but nothing that will interfere with the actual dining experience. They also have cheap ($8) valet parking. I will definitely go again, when I've had a chance to save up. Next time, I'll do the wine pairings. \n\nP.S. You can always try the lounge and the lounge menu. It has some of the regular menu offering and some offerings of its own at more wallet friendly prices. You'll still impress your date and have a chance to do something else fun that evening.", "author": "Nicole M."}

This is a very modern take on the traditional French tasting menu set in a beautiful minimal setting.\n\nOverall I give the service a perfect 5 stars!\nGreat staff, we were very well attended to, and the presentation and timing was spot on.  Never an empty water glass, wines brought right on time with each dish, all wines and dishes well described, and the amuse bush was in front of us after 3 minutes at the table.  Perfection.\n\nFood I give a 4.3\nSome of the dishes were truly out of this world but would then be followed by a dish that left me a little flat.  I feel that a tasting menu of this caliber should be a blast of flavor, then a pallet cleanser, then another blast of flavor, and pallet cleanser..each section should slowly build and build (like sex) till you peak and then cool your taste buds down on sweets.  The food did the blast and cleanse dance perfectly but just barely failed to build to a place where I felt like I had gone on the roller coaster.\n\nWines I give a 4.7\nExcellent wines!  Excellent pairing choices.  I agreed with all of the choices but knew of a few wines I would have rather seen in front of me to balance or counteract the dish at hand.  The Carignane (10% Grenache) was a perfect choice to transition from the whites to the reds.\n\nPrice I give a solid 4\nI knew exactly what we were getting in to prior to going.  At $115 a person for food and another $85 for wines, plus gratuities and valet the entire thing came out to $530 for 2 people.  You are paying extra for the service and the organic local products, I get that.  I just wish (going back to my 4.3 on the food) that the food experience evolved more than it did.\n\nAll and all I loved this place, but I didn't $530 love it...$350-$450 for sure.  That said, I have ZERO regrets about going and having that experience and I recommend it to anyone who has a little extra cash to blow on a truly unique dining experience.

We also had to ask them to put the bottle on ice, as they just set it on the bar to let it warm up.  Room temperature mediocre sake?  No thanks.\n- Lack of vodka.  This is just personal preference, but I like to start out my Friday night with a nice strong martini- shaken, not stirred.  Shame on me for assuming that this 2 star Michelin restaurant actually served cocktails.\n- 11 course tasting menu- wayyyy disappointing.  There were maybe 2 dishes that were great, but 4 that were awful and the others I can barely remember.  I know this changes regularly and I appreciate the chef's attempt to use 'locally-sourced' ingredients, etc. but I was really disappointed with the taste (not the quality) of the food.\n- Ambiance- we had reservations for the lounge since we didn't want to BOTH get the tasting menu (we supplemented with a few a la carte items, but nothing even worth mentioning here).  The lounge was fine except for the two people next to us were in jeans and sweatshirts and a grungy hat.  I don't mean to be snobby, but if you're dining out on a Friday night, can you at least put on a comfy tee in lieu of your grungy sweatshirt?  Ah, only in SF.  Oh also- the \"sheepskin\" pillows in the lounge looked like they hadn't been washed in FOREVER and the brown one reminded me of the dreadlocks on the homeless man I saw asking for money on Market St.\n- All in all, a big disappointment.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-27", "description": "Pronounced Kwa, the name means \"serenity\" in old French.  The interior certainly plays into that.  The decorations feature a lot of weathered stones and natural fibers.  When you come up to the place from Broadway you just never imagine a place like this could be found by looking at the buildings around it.  As our sever explained the philosophy of the restaurant, he explained that the chef's menu is meant to be cerebral.  I have to agree that the food overall while good, is geared to the \"food geek\".  This is not an outpost for molecular gastronomy mind you, but the names and the techniques the chef chooses are as much about trying to go somewhere different as they are about tasting good.  \nWe were started off with a grapefruit and fennel soda that had this intense citrus aroma and savory taste, nice palate  cleanser.  After that we went on a 11 course tour with the chef.  Highlights included a geoduck and cucumber salad was topped with chopped almonds for texture.  A dish called \"Earth and Sea #5\" composed of tiny potatoes in a squid ink sauce that was hard to describe except to say I wanted to lick the plate.  Another dish called \"Morel Porridge,\" a Pea \"porridge\" with butter poached morel mushrooms.  \"Cake and Ice Cream,\" a crispy, slightly salty chocolate cake topped with a raw milk ice cream.  The only dish that really missed for us was the \"Young Carrots roasted in Hay,\" young roasted carrots served on a bed of greens and a jelly made from hay stock.  The baby carrots could have been cooked better (they had little texture and flavor to match) and the radish powder that surrounded the plate while smoky at first became overwhelmingly bitter as we ate more of it.  We ended with a small jelly like candy (think Sunkist fruit gems but much softer) that was made with grapefruit and fennel (like the soda to start our meal).  It made for a really nice bookend to the meal.  If you look at the menu you will notice that there is not a lot of protein but you should still leave full.  \nThey offer a wine pairing with the meal (10x1-2oz. pours) which for the most part worked although there was one that I just did not get at all. The servers were pleasant and while they do tell you about each dish they have a large reserve of information about each dish to draw on if you have any questions about the ingredients or techniques implemented.  I think they did a great job of explaining what we were having in a general overview.  Then when I wanted more information they were more than capable and happy to give it to me.\nIn the dining room, the chef's dinner menu is served exclusively and can fit larger parties while the lounge has small tables and serves an a la carte menu that includes the dining room menu.  Overall we liked the place but I can't say I'd recommend this place to everyone I know.  I think some of the people I know just would not get the menu.", "author": "Steven C."}

(If you split the wine tasting that goes along with dinner rather than each have your own. If you don't, then it's more. And you do want a wine tasting.) Coi teaches you something about food, so it's educational. it challenges you to think about different type of parings, ie., what vegs might go with others. It shows you sauces you haven't thought of. It makes its own butter.  The staff know everything and are perfect. \n\nBut remember: $500 for a dinner for two. I had an insight: I simply won't pay that for dinner. It just shocked me back to reality. No, it really isn't worth it. In the end, it is just a very, very good dinner. It's better than all the great Valencia street places, but it is not $300 better for a dinner for two. (Range? Is it $300 worse? I don't think so.) You lose your sense of community in Coi. I feel connected on Valencia St. You finish dinner and you walk into a bustling street with many things to see. At Coi, I felt apart from the real world. Even the immediate neighborhood: it was dead, it didn't feel like a neighborhood, though there were neighborhoods on all sides. The place doesn't seem to belong anywhere: it's block is as nondescript as they come in SF. \n\nThe best part of this place is that it asks you to consider what kind of a person you really are.

The decor is lovely both at the upstairs bar and in the downstairs dining room -- sophisticated and urban, yet warm and comfortable.  When we first arrived, the service was a bit overwhelmed, and it took them a little while to take our drink and food orders, but once they got to us, the wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable, and attentive without being obtrusive (ie. they noticed that one of our dining party was not eating the beet and goat cheese amuse bouche that they had brought because he does not like beets, and they quietly brought him an alternative amuse bouche - very nice).  \n\nThe food was tasty and flavorful, though a couple of the dishes were not particularly unique or interesting (asparagus appetizer), and that is the reason this restaurant gets 4 stars from me and not 5.  The 6 of us all opted for the 4 course dinner menu, where we were able to pick one dish out of 3 choices for each of the 4 courses (appetizer, fish, meat, cheese/dessert), and everyone seemed happy with their food.  \n\nThey are also flexible with the menu and allow diners to request dishes typically reserved for the 9 course tasting menu as one of their choices on the dinner menu.  For my meat course, I opted for the foie gras marinated squab which was from the tasting menu side of the menu, and found the dish to be delicious and the portion generous (much larger I'd imagine than the tasting menu portion).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-08-22", "description": "Hubby and I celebrated our belated anniversary dinner here last Friday. Given Coi's two Michelin stars, we definitely had high expectations, and it didn't disappoint.\n\nWe started off with a \"soda\", which of reminded me of Commis (they had a similar starter).  I was hoping for more than one amuse as I've had in other restaurants, but the later courses more than made up for it.  \n\nThe first course, \"summer, frozen in time\", was probably one of their more \"molecular\" courses. I thought it was ok, maybe a bit on the tart side, but the texture was unusual and it was a fun dish.  The cucumber melon with the caviar was much better, just loved the flavor of the caviar against the creamy creme fraiche and refreshing cucumber.  Next was the inverted cherry tomato tart.  This was one of the standout dishes...the tomatoes were just so perfectly juicy with such tender skin that the whole thing almost melts in your mouth.  The only other place where I've had such a good tomato was at Chez Panisse, but they do a lot more with it here than just put it on a plate.  The accompanying basil sauce and olive wafer (or whatever that was) complimented the tomatoes perfectly.  The chilled eggplant soup was also very good, and you can see the progression with the flavors getting bolder with each course.\n\nOur first hot course was grilled abalone.  It definitely had a different texture than what I was used to, sliced very thinly and a bit crisp on the edges...still very good though!  It came with a Merry Edwards Sauvignon Blanc...I'm normally not a white wine person but this was one of my favorite wines of the evening.  Next course was smoked black cod.  The fish was just cooked perfectly, with slivers of the fish just sliding off, nice and tender.\n\nThe next course was the chicken/egg.  I was expecting the poached scrambled egg to be a bit softer and less cooked, but it still had great flavor and I loved the chicken jus.  This course normally pairs with a white wine, but after we mentioned to our server that we prefer reds, we got a substitute red wine pairing.  Finally, our main meat course was the lamb chop.  It was a pretty decent sized portion, especially for an tasting menu.  It was super-tender, perfectly medium rare, and probably one of the best preparations of lamb (if not the best) that I've ever had.\n\nThe cheese course was not supposed to have any wine (which puzzled me a bit why they would not pair w/ the cheese, but provide pairings for the 2 dessert courses).  However, we requested to get a pairing anyway, as I just have to have wine with cheese...the red they picked out went perfectly, and they didn't even charge us for the extra pairing!  The cheese was heavenly...creamy and slightly runny.  I can probably eat a whole wheel of this stuff.  The greens that came with it went really well, so did the red wine that the sommelier chose to pair with it as we requested.\n\nThe first of the two desserts was peaches with pound cake croutons...I'm not a big fruity dessert person, but those pound cake croutons really made this dessert!  This makes me want to go make some pound cake and toast little bits of it just so I can put it on all sorts of desserts. The last course was caramelized white chocolate cream...which was good for the hubby since he doesn't like real chocolate.  I thought it was light and not a bad way to end the night.  Finally they gave us a couple little candies at the end of the meal...I probably would have preferred chocolate, but they were good.\n\nSome courses impressed more than others, but they were all tasty, and the portions were larger than what I expected for an 11-course tasting menu.  It was nice that we still managed to be surprised and discovered new preparations that we haven't seen before.  The wine pairings were also impressive, and managed to surprise us with unusual wines that we've never had before.  \n\nThe service ultimately puts it over the top, on par with the best we've had...you can tell the staff is just really well-trained.  We really appreciated the attentiveness of our captain to our preference for red wines that we got three red wines instead of the one we normally would have gotten. The wine pours were very generous overall...we definitely appreciated it as one of my pet peeves is really stingy wine pairings.  I usually tip very well (~20% if the service is good), so built-in service charges (18% in this case) normally annoy me to the point that I never add any extra on principle.  However, they really did deserve a bit extra this time since the service was really that good. \n\nOverall, it was definitely a great dinner...and we actually spent less than 2/3 of what we spent on French Laundry the previous year.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone celebrating a special occasion in the city.", "author": "Arlene M."}

Normally out of our league, The Sweet took me here for our engagement dinner. We hardly said a word to each other because we were wrapped up in the flavors and textures of the courses. Yes, it's outrageously expensive, and perhaps a bit too precious in its \"our chef just foraged this on his morning walk at an undisclosed location!\" But hey, it was amazing. The group before us was late, so they settled us in the lounge to wait with a free bar tab the whole evening. The waiters probably recognized we were a bit out of our element and patiently explained everything (sometimes twice), completely unpretentiously.

I honestly can't think of much else to say (but I will, don't worry). \n\nThis was an incredible experience and I cannot wait to go back. From the zen-like dining area to the fabulous waitstaff to the outstanding meal...my time at Coi was simply fabulous.  \n\nWe went for our anniversary...and were damn excited to be in the City after a long hiatus (when you have young kids and you live in the South Bay, SF becomes a very distant memory). Anyway, my husband selected the restaurant so I had no clue what to expect. \n\nI have to confess, it took me a little while to warm up to the food. Sadly I won't be able to list a blow-by-blow of our meal (it's been three weeks since my visit) but I can tell you that Coi seems to specialize in very avant-garde dishes. Clearly the chef is into pushing boundaries and forcing the diner to go places he/she might never choose to go on his/her own. As I said, it took me a while to get used to the flavor and texture combos...I did resist for the first few dishes...but once I let go of my expectations and allowed myself to simply enjoy the experience, everything fell into place and I had one of the most unique and delicious meals of my life. \n\nMy recommendations:\n- Do order the wine pairing but be sure to have a designated driver or taxi lined up to take you to your next destination. Also, be warned the wine pours are VERY generous and you just might, as my poor husband did, find yourself getting ill as a result of far too much alcohol. Think about it: 11 courses and roughly the same number of wines. That's a lot of wine.\n- Do skip lunch or a late afternoon snack before arriving. While the portions are small, they do add up. I left feeling pleasantly full but I shudder to think how my stomach would have fared had I snacked prior to our arrival.\n- Don't read the menu, especially (or only) if you are the slightest bit picky or have general \"food\" issues. It's easy to form a good or bad opinion as to what something might taste like based on the menu description. Best to just let it happen and experience it in the moment rather than building up positive or negative anticipation. Personally, I've never been an abalone fan but boy I sure am now! Same goes for oysters. \n- Do expect to pay more than you may have paid at a restaurant, ever (unless of course your income is on par with that of Larry Ellison or Bill Gates, in which case, don't worry about it).", "author": "Jennifer M."}

I was a little bummed about the food because we had a lot of courses for the tasting menu and the only one I remember was the steak with the bernaise sauce because it was the only meat dish of the 11 courses (unless you count a sliver of raw fish?). It was no doubt delicious as the steak was perfectly cooked and the sauce was flavorful and creamy. It was great to see an assortment of local vegetables cooked and paired in fancy unique ways but I just wasn't in love with the flavor combinations to actually remember them. I'd like to give Coi another try as I know their menu changes, but perhaps their style just isn't what I prefer.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-05-03", "description": "100% the worst ever restaurant experience I've had in San Francisco. No, anywhere on Earth. No wonder it was the only place in the city that had a Saturday 8:30pm reservation ten minutes before!! \n\nAfter arriving to a completely empty lounge area, we were greeted by a very gracious hostess. She got us our glasses of yummy wine (no liquor here) and rose infused water. Our guests joined us and the four of us were taken to the dining room. Someone thought long and hard about the interior, you could tell. If they were going for Phillips Morris offices circa 1973 minus the good jokes, they got it dead-on. Drab, boring, trying hard to be chic.\n\nHere's a tip if you are insane enough go to Coi: there is no laughing allowed (or aloud). Every time we so much as giggled that evening the wait staff looked at us strangely. I guess this is not a sound they're used to. Got that? No laughing. Or smiling. In fact, go when you're in a really bad mood and you'll fit in perfectly.\n\nThe amuse bouche was some berry thing. It was ok. Very ok. So completely ok that I it did not amuse my bouche at all. Not even a little.\n\nMy hubby asked if he could order dishes a la carte from the lounge menu. Our pocket-sized waitress replied, \"Yes, but then you have to sit in the lounge.\" Oh my gosh! Thank you, tiny dancer, for this rude, unhelpful, completely idiotic suggestion! Now shut up and go get me my $5 billion dollar tasting courses.\n\nCourse #1: Completely inedible. So salty that my tongue immediately retracts into my mouth. Grumpy waiter picks up four completely untouched plates and does not even bother to ask why there is not more than a teaspoon missing from each plate. \n\nCourse #2: Completely inedible. So salty that I can feel my blood pressure rise from the suddenly-doubled amount of sodium in my body. This time, Grumpy Waiter #2 picks up our plates. Two out of four are untouched. He bears down on me and haughtily asks if there is some remote possibility that there was something wrong with my dish. I say, \"Yes, I couldn't eat it because it was very salty just my like my last dish.\" He stares at me for 10 seconds and walks away. No, literally, HE WALKED AWAY. He didn't even pout in sympathy, let alone apologize profusely and offer me something else or at least a glass of freaking water to wash out the salt stalactites forming in my mouth.\n\nI won't bore you with courses 3-8. They sucked. I kid you not, even the dessert was salty. I swear! I don't care how many sabayons you make out of how many different types of Japanese citrus fruits you can find. Stop adding salt. Stop it. Put the salt away. And when people don't eat your food, ask them why. When you hear the answer, apologize, offer some sort of alternative even if the customer doesn't want it. Pout, cry, get down on your knees and beg for forgiveness. Because if you don't, Coi will cease to exist for more than 18 months before people revolt and NEVER go there again.\n\nI called the next day and spoke to the hostess. I explained how my husband and our guests left the night before feeling completely violated, slightly nauseous and very hungry. She was very apologetic and told me that the manager would call me back in 30 minutes. But, he never did. He did his dirty work through the hostess who told me that they were unable to comp our meal, but that we could come back and have a meal in the lounge on them. When I explained that no one from my party wanted to come back to relive the experience, she said she would get her manager to call me. But, he never did. Again, his hostess called me back and said that the manager was willing to have us back for a meal in the dining room. I told her that this was not a negotiation, just a chance for Coi to explain that their standards are higher and this should have never happened. She said the manager was sorry I felt that way and that they hoped we would be back soon. \n\nWell, Coi, if you'd like an answer: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I will not be back to your awful restaurant to eat awful food and get awful service and I hope no one else will either. \n\nGo to Jardiniere to eat beautiful food in a beautiful atmosphere and receive beautiful service. \n\nAnd when someone asks you if you've heard anything about Coi, slap them in the face, shove a cup of salt down their throat and say, there, now you've experienced Coi.", "author": "Mekhala I."}

There was something on it that was no larger than a kernel of corn, but packed enough taste (and smell) to fill me with more than just anticipation.  Five stars based on originality, creativity, ambiance, exciting flavors and memorability.  From these measures, Coi might rank as the best restaurant in SF ive been to.  \n\nDaniel Patterson is clearly from another planet (he even seemed somewhat awkward when he came out to say hi after the meal) but if this is his intergalactic peace offering, I think we should accept it gracefully.   \n\nOn the other hand he might just be a more highly evolved human.  Here's why:  DP is clearly obsessed with scents and aromas (one course involves actually putting on perfume before eating) but this is far from a gimmick.  I think he has claimed that he is looking to push the evolution of California Cuisine. Consciously or not, he may be doing way more than that.  He may be helping pave the way for human evolution itself.  That's because the next phase of our evolution as a species will be characterized by our olfactory sense.  First came the age of muscle and physicality, then came reason and mind, now, welcome to the next episode ...  smell.  I don't have room here to fully elaborate, but don't turn up your nose at me just yet.  I'm not alone in this thought.  I'm dying to go back and ask him whether he has read Tom Robbins' Jitterbug Perfume.  If he hasn't, he should.  So should you.  A tidbit:\n\nThe aroma of flowers, from which we have borrowed our perfumes, while extremely powerful, has been from the beginning entirely seductive in its intentions. A rose is a rose is a rogue. Perfume, fundamentally, is the sexual attractant of flowers, or, in the case of civet and musk, of animals. Squeezed from the reproductive glands of plants and creatures, perfume is the smell of creation, a sign dramatically delivered to our senses of the Earth's regenerative powers--a message of hope and a message of pleasure.  TR.\n\nBack to Coi.\n\nThe food is downright sexy.  You may find yourself thinking impure thoughts - possibly even making \"inappropriate\" noises or comments at times.  Its not your fault.  It's Dan's.  See above.  \n\nI, for one, think Mr. Patterson is a genius.  And you don't have to be a genius to recognize one. If you did, Einstein would never have gotten invited to the White House.  I cant even cook. \n\nI wont go through all eleven or so courses that were served but will say the scallop and the squab (homing pigeon) were very good.  My favorite, however, was hands down the warm soft egg yolk served in its shell with little bits of bacon and covered in a salty foam.  Orgasm number 1.  It was not alone.  \n\nThe service was at times spotty, and several of the criticisms other yelpers have leveled are legitimate.  Very salty, very small portions, and dinner takes forever.  This just means yelp needs more stars.  And SF needs more restaurants willing to take a risk.  I might not rush out to spend my own coin here every week, but if you have the chance to experience this place on a business dinner, take that opportunity and don't plan on forgetting it soon.  \n\nFor those of you out there who are seduced by food, highly evolved or just curious to see a restaurant try to do something more, come to Coi.  Who knows, take a whiff, have a taste and Daniel Patterson may even make you come multiple times.", "author": "Brad C."}

The focus here was more about exciting your palate with inventive flavors and less about getting full on tasty, comfy food.  I'd recommend it for special occasions.  The 11 course menu was heavy with vegetables and less with proteins.  I personally prefer to have more protein than vegetables in my meals; with that said, all the dishes were very tasty and created exciting conversations about the new flavors.  \nWine Pairing: \nServes about 5-6 pairings, approx. an ounce each.  Total, its equivalent to 3 glasses of wine.  To me, it wasn't really worth it.  I think I could of done three different half bottles and paired them myself, since you have visibility to the fix menu when you sit.  \n\nFood:\n1.  Frozen mandarin sour- what a way to start your tasting menu. Many taste buds were awaken with this little dish...your very own pre-party \n2. Oysters Rockefeller, CA style- the oysters were silky and the clear jelly-like blanket made it fun to eat\n3. \"Calcots\": new onions, black breadcrumbs, hazelnut-almond puree- must of been my favorite dish.  the onion bulbs were smokey and tasted like bbq \n4. Spring-chilled pea soup- \n5. Asparagus steamed in its juice with lemon sabayon- good asparagus but nothing new in flavors\n6. Young carrots roasted in hay- tasty, but nothing new in flavors.  I guess there aren't that many ways to prepare carrots\n7. slow-cooked chicken egg- So delicious, I was expecting just a poached egg over grains but I was wrong. The dish left me guessing the ingredients that gave the party in my mouth it's second wind.  \n8. prather ranch beef tartare- just as good as the last amazing tartare I've had\n9. Cadence-wild greens- hmmmm...tasty but can't put a finger on why\n10. lime curd & meringue- makes your cheeks tingle\n11. cade and ice cream- light and refreshing\nEvery dish was tasty, some more memorable than others, and they left you wishing for more.\n\nDress code:  The lounge area seemed business casual.  I saw some folks wearing denim in the lounge.  In the main area, where we ate, there were 8 tables and the guests were all dressed casual elegant.

I had heard good things about it from a couple of friends.\n\nValet out front is $8, and they conveniently don't always have exact change in their pockets.  \n\nThe space is very cleanly decorated, with tables spaced far enough apart.  Everything is in colors of accented neutrals, with cool textured walls.  The lounge area seems nice for a smaller meal, but we were in the main dining room.  The noise level was enough so that you could feel free to have your own conversation, but it wasn't too loud that it was disturbing.  Everything looks very clean, and it has sort of a zen type feel without being cheesy.\n\nThe cuisine is new American with some slight Asian touches. They're very accommodating about dietary aversions and/or allergies and will substitute courses as needed.  The local sources of foods are listed, an ingredients are indeed fresh, unique, and all paired well.\n\nSome things that stuck out in my mind:\n- grilled abalone with nettle: it reminded me a bit of grilled calamari, but it was done very well, with a nice slighly charred flavor.  I don't usually like abalone, but the texture was not too rubbery, and it had just the right amount of lemon to balance it out.\n- pork: very tender, but flavor-wise reminded me of the pork in Chinese soups.  What was most disappointing, though, was that mine was extremely undercooked (not just pink, but with some red inside), and when I pointed it out to the server, she said she agreed.  However, no apology, no offers to re-do it, no compensation whatsoever...\n- carrots over lightly toasted rice - I enjoyed the rice a lot - it seemed slow cooked and had a light charred undertone without being over-burnt.  The carrot puree underneath was also very natural and sweet.  Unfortunately, the pickled shaved carrots on top were overpowering.\n- Asian broth with vegetables: smelled very strongly of dashi.  It was pretty salty, but it was mostly a soy sauce base.  The vegetables were also cut in awkward shapes that made it a bit harder to eat\n- dessert: very well prepared meringue with a thin bruleed top and a slightly salted light caramel bottom with the crunch of peanuts beneath.  Texture and flavor wise, this dessert really stood out and was one of the highlights of the meal.\n\nThe complimentary strawberry root beer to start was unique, and the apricot puree at the end was very clean and refreshing.  My main complaints would be a bit too much pickling in the dishes (lots of dishes with heavy acidity that overpowered more mellow flavors) and also the lack of response to the pork complaint.  In a place where you pay $400 for 2 people, you'd really expect more response for that.  I'm not concerned about Trichinosis or anything, but it just wasn't palatable.\n\nOtherwise, service was very attentive, with water always being refilled quickly (sparkling or flat is included), and the introductions to dishes were appropriate.  The pacing of everything was timed well, from removal of dishes to service of the next.\n\nWith the exceptions listed above, it was an enjoyable experience.  Dishes are very innovative, but I wasn't blown away.  I guess I have pretty high expectations when I pay this amount for a meal.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

Originally I was going to give Coi a higher rating but I really can't. As noted Coi offers a fixed 11 course menu. I will not bother with the lengthy description of dishes as other reviewers have covered the sufficiently. You will leave Coi full but not stuffed. You will leave Coi thinking it was a good dining experience. But then when you get home you will start comparing Coi to all the other tasting menus and fine Michelin rated restaurants and reconsider the experience. I was going to give kudos for accommodating my dining partner's lactose intolerance by substituting a few dishes as we were told in advance and by the waiter that \"we are well prepared for that at Coi\", but that only lasted until we saw the substitutions. Several were o.k. but one missed the mark by leaps and bounds. When we arrived at the \"grilled cheese\" course which was a small square of grilled rye with cheese, my partner got a few lettuce leaves with vinaigrette. What? How is that a reasonable substitute? Now there's no substitute for cheese, granted. However they could have done a grilled sandwich of some sort with a meat item (pancetta, foie, duck, beef, or whatever) as a substitute. Disappointing. Their \"preparedness\" that they seem proud of falls short. That being said the experience was acceptable but certainly no where near the top of my list.", "author": "B J."}

We stood at the entrance for a couple minutes before anyone acknowledged us, so I felt slightly unwelcome.  It will never get the 3rd Michelin if every detail isn't attended to.   Ok that was the bad.   The service was spectacular, our waiter/sommelier was able to give us our tasing menu and wine pairing at a slightly rushed pace in order for us to make it to the new years fireworks at the embarcadero. The wine pairing was excellent, Chef Pattersons unique style was enhanced by the wines chosen for each course.  So far the best pairings I've had to         date.   Not a vegan tasting menu at all yet the way these fresh produce is used is beautiful to see and just as amazing to eat.  The oysters were unique in flavor to the pacific although I'm partial to my Florida panhandles ( but that's my personal preference). The portions are beautifully modest and visually pleasing. If your goal is to eat yourself until you feel, bloated, gassy with the task of holding in painful farts, this isn't the place.

(COOL bathroom - with rolled up dinner napkins for your washed hand - instead of paper.

I loved my perfectly stewed dish, the tender string meat came apart with my SPOON.  Good stuff.

Finally made reservations in the Lounge area, which is a great option for value and if you are not ready to for an 11 course meal.\n\nHighlights: The service was incredible: attentive, knowledgeable, discreet and actually friendly. We got a table in the lounge, which was not crowded and was actually really comfortable. The lounge menu boasts more comfort food items plus the option to order a la carte items from the dining room section: Best of both worlds! You can mix and match (and mismatch) as you please. The lounge menu, I have to say, was just as good as the on in the dining room and the portions tend to be a little larger although never really even close to that of a regular restaurant.  The food item that I loved the best was the cauliflower sou--I know I am weird. But it was delicate, subtly accented with nuts and maybe some truffle oil of some sort and edible flowers in top. Just great! The wine list is IMPRESSIVE. I just had a sherry and sipped the generous serving all night. Blue bottle coffee rounds the whole experience and sends you home feeling satisfied and happy.\n\nLowlights: Perhaps I was expecting to be knocked off my feet and I was not. \n\nBut in retrospect, it was great meal with excellent service (you pay 18% instantly--shared by all service staff) in a quiet atmosphere. I would definitely recommend for oenophiles, foodies and great ambiance. And of course, the lounge area for incredible value offering.", "author": "Florencia P."}

I had enjoyed a meal at Elisabeth Daniel years ago (which was most memorable for brandy soaked prunes served with epoisse cheese from Bourgogne). \n\nI like that Patterson is out there, willing to publicly challenge the Alice Waters school of cooking in the p.c. Bay Area. I also like his focus on deep flavors and the whole El Bulli chemical/cooking experiments even if they don't always work. My issue with Patterson is he seems to be missing a practicality gene. Elisabeth Daniel failed because of location. I suspect Coi will too. It's not the Broadway corridor that's the problem (though can you think of any good restaurants that have made it on Broadway?? The Black Cat was popular for a time, but fizzled). The dinner room at Coi is tiny therefor requiring two seatings at most and high prix fixes. I wonder if Patterson can even breakeven at near full occupancy. Similarly, I was glancing through his cook book (Aroma) while waiting for the rest of my party and while I dig his culinary reach, I can't say much of it is practical for the home chef (...who's going to stock dozens of $$$ esoteric flavored oils???).\n\nAs for the food, it was all very good. I enjoyed seeing an Elk chop on the menu (to me if was like a gamier beef). I really liked the scallops tartare though the avocado mousse paired with it was interesting but not super tasty. The sea bream was also cooked nicely and paired with pork bellies. The celery ice cream had only a hit of flavor but was a nice contrast to the meyer lemon tart. \n\nOverall, a high quality meal (as one would expect for a four course at $75!). I so want Patterson to succeed and I applaud what he's trying to do but I'm not sure the food was \"out of the park\" enough to sustain a small number of covers/night in this tough restaurant town.", "author": "John H."}

It's situated next to Centerfolds in North Beach.   Coi (pronounced \"kwa,\" not \"coi\") is divided into two spaces:  the main dining area with a $120 fixed price menu and a lounge area with an a la carte menu. \n\nFood:  4 stars.   Executive chef/owner Daniel Patterson, formerly of Elisabeth Daniel and Frisson, continues to impress with an innovative menu that aims to please all the senses.  We ate in the main dining area and had the 11-course prix fixe menu, which included the following:  pink grapefruit, asparagus panna cotta or kampachi sashimi, redwood hill dairy fresh goat cheese, nettle soup, warm salad of shaved artichokes or long and bailey suckling pig head, hodo soy yuba \"pappardelle,\" local wild mushroom stew or sauteed madara, slow-cooked farm egg or bellwether farm lamb, acapella, carrot cake, and confit banana.  The pink grapefruit started off the meal as an impressive presentation of Daniel Patterson's innovative techniques:  he combines aromatherapy and foams to tantalize the senses of smell and sight, while subtly mixing in the tart flavors.  The asparagus panna cotta was innovative creamy goodness and outshone the somewhat bland kampachi sashimi.  The goat cheese, supplemented with dill, beets, and caramay, was delicious, as was the nettle soup and warm salad of shaved artichokes.  I tried pig head for the first time and actually thought it was pretty good.  The \"pappardelle\" ended up being an Asian soup that tasted like any other soup I could find at a Chinese restaurant.  The most difficult point in the meal was having to choose between the mushroom stew and the sauteed madara.  Both dishes were phenomenal - I was happy that I strategized with my friends on what to eat so I could try everything.  The slow cooked farm egg was interesting, but unfortunately the lamb fell short in terms of flavor.  The acapella, carrot cake, and confit banana were nice, playful dishes that served as perfect bookends to the meal.\n\nService:  5 stars.   The quality of service at Coi is what you would expect at a high end restaurant.  The servers were very professional, accommodating and attentive, but never stuffy.  You definitely feel like a VIP at Coi no matter how ghetto you really are.\n\nAtmosphere:  5 stars.   It's no surprise that Coi means \"tranquil\" in French.  The modern interior feels almost zen-like, with clean lines and earthy brown tones.  The restaurant attracts a good-looking crowd, which is generally in their late 20's to 30's.    \n\nHits:   Asparagus panna cotta, local wild mushroom stew, sauteed madara, confit banana.\n\nMisses:   Kampachi sashimi, hodo soy yuba \"pappardelle\", bellwether farm lamb.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like: French Laundry, Ame, Gary Danko, Jardiniere", "author": "Keith C."}

It's nestled right next to all the strip joints on Broadway which is a little funny and endearing but not that sweet when you are somewhat buzzed and trying to find a cab.\nThe actual restaurant is quite nice. I really like the lounge area and the table we were sitting at in the corner (the first time I went). The dining room is minimalistic and cute. The place is small though so definitely need reservations, even for the lounge. On my second trip, had the chance to dine in the private dining room which I highly recommend if you've got a smaller group (we were 5). It was great (though be aware it will not be a cheap meal).\nFirst experience - service was great. We ate in the lounge area, had some cocktails and champagne and a few dishes off their pre fixe menu and bar menu.  The cod and the beef (from their lounge menu) were both quite good. The other dishes were ok.\nSecond experience - 11 course tasting menu. We decided not to go with the wine pairings cause they can be hit or miss. Instead the sommelier helped us pick several bottles of wine as the meal progressed. The first bottle of pinot was phenomenal and I don't even like Pinots. I also had a beer pairing with one of my courses which was amazing (pretty sure it was the onion soup).  \nAs far as the food, you'll love the dish or you'll probably hate it but credit to Chef patterson for taking risks. A large chunk of their menu is vegetarian which is interesting (and more challenging) too. There are a lot of flavors and ingredients that are featured that you don't see at a lot of other restaurants. I'm so used to seeing the tuna tartare, foie gras, kobe steak,... all delicious but not particularly risky.

The only dish I didn't really love was the pork belly.\n\nThe experience here is completely different than a place like Gary Danko, which is both good and bad.  I thought the presentation and variety of what ended up being three times as many courses (but much smaller) as GD made it quite unique.  If I'm going to continue comparing it to Gary I would point out that the service wasn't quite as stand out and endearing. GD's service, in my opinion, is the best in the business.\n\nAnyway... Coi is a culinary experience like no other and I recommend it if you have the chance.", "author": "Derek B."}

We chose to sit in the lounge area which was sleek, modern, but warm and inviting. We had the choice of the lounge menu and also Ala carte off of the $120 tasting menu, both menu's were exciting to choose from. \n\nWe had: Grapefruit with black pepper,tarragon which was very interesting because I have never tasted those components together before so my palate was freaking out a bit. There was a slight bite of Cognac, and the essential oil that we were instructed to apply to our wrist and hand took it to another level successful dish. \nnext, and we can't forget the bread baked in house with house made butter served with coarse grain salt... yea it was good. I had ordered the Sturgeon poached in smoked oil, with pig's head and caviar, wow the texture of the fish was out of this world, buttery,smooth, perfect execution, aI wished there was a little more heat on the dish temp not spice, but amazing none the less. I will have to say at this point the service was outstanding, professional, informative, cordial, it was like she cooked half of the food she knew so much. This tells you that Daniel Patterson has his stuff together. the nettle ricotta cannelloni I could have done without... everything was so suttle, it was screaming for some salt, acid, something. Presentation of everything was nice. Next was the beef dish cooked in it's own fat... with bone marrow and roasted cauliflower, amazing, by far the best component of the night (the roasted cauliflower I mean), again I was really needing some more temperature on the dish. \n\nI had the cheese course... who doesn't love straight no BS well made cheese. And Claudia had the chocolate cake with squash sherbet's nice. \n\nI will be back to experience the whole tasting menu, with wine pairing an extra $95, which I will gladly pay.", "author": "stevo A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-10-26", "description": "My husband and I ate here this past weekend.  Coi has two areas in which to eat:  the dining room, where your only choice is an 11-or-so course tasting menu for $125;  or the lounge, where you can individually order any item from the tasting menu as well as from a separate lounge menu of small to mid sized plates.\n\nWhile both experiences are somewhat formal, the lounge is certainly less so, both in tone, ambiance, experience, and most importantly, accessibility - more on that later.\n\nNow, while I could go on about specific dishes, others have already done that and done it well.  Also, the menu changes constantly, especially at this time of year, so such specific reviews probably wouldn't be all that useful.  Suffice it to say the food we ate was delicious. \n\nChef Patterson obviously puts a hell of a lot of thought into his dishes and his menu.  Although we ended up sampling a good 2/3's or so of the menu, I think it will take more than just one visit to begin to figure out some of his common themes.  However, there were a few basic ones that seemed pretty clear:  \n1.  This is a guy who loves his vegetables - half the courses were either wholly vegetarian or had negligable meat content.  \n2.  The salt was perfect and constant in every dish.  Every bite had the same amount of salt.  The intensity necessary to achieve this is astounding.  \n3.  His citrus notes were also perfect, and you could really tell how much care was going in to getting it just right.\n4.  Concentration - I almost got the sense, especially with the smaller dishes, that smallness of the portion was almost purposeful:  a way to get you to savor and think about the bite more carefully.  I felt, on these dishes, that I was being asked to really think about what I was eating rather than just passively experience it.\n\nOne of the things I found most interesting about this restaurant set up was the element of accessibility.  Not everyone wants to spend $125 and 2-3 hours on a tasting menu.  Not everyone can.  But because you can access the full menu, with individual items ranging from $10-$20 or so dollars, that menu is accessible to virtually everyone.  You can get a sense of what this guy is about whether you are prepared to spend $40 or $400.\n\nIn terms of price point, again, I thought things were perfectly reasonable.  Although the portions on each of the courses definitely tended to be small, after essentially splitting a tasting menu, my husband and I were definitely full.  And again, at this kind of restaurant, you need to judge value based on food quality, not food quantity.  That being said, I reiterate that we left pleasantly full, so the portion sizes were definitely dead on for the number of intended courses.\n\nIn terms of service, we really had a nice time.  Although it is definitely a more formal atmosphere, especially in the main dining room, I don't think it was onerously so.  Our server's demeanor was initially more reserved, but he was more than happy to help us devise our own tasting menu, gave insightful advice, and was adept in taking demeanor cues towards us based on our demeanor towards him.  In addition to our server, we probably had an additional 2 or 3 staff members helping to keep us well served during the evening.  All in all, I'd say there is a real push to pamper the customer here, but in a very respectful, non-pushy way.\n\nHonestly, it was exciting.  Some of the dishes blew me away, some I merely liked, and one or two, though I appreciated, just didn't do it for me.  But every dish had me interested.  We'll definitely be looking forward to heading back and trying the dishes we missed on this last visit as well as keeping up with new dishes as the menu changes.", "author": "Daniel M."}

The 11 course prix fix was a spectacular mix, from start to finish. I had the \"wine\" pairing which included one course with Belgian beer, and another with Sake. All the paired wines were European, save for one California Sauvignon. I liked everything, including the elaborately carved beet through the savory 'soup.\" The service was perfectly executed with each person attending to the table fully knowledgeable (and articulate) about each and every course. The only small item to note is that the sommelier--if that's what he was--seemed to amble about indiscriminately in an underdressed costume detracting from the overall service ambiance. Although he is not alone in his peculiar, somewhat condescending attitude that diners know nothing about wines and/or other beverages, he should look to improve his customer interactions since some might just know a little more than he. Fortunately, we are able to avoid him for the most part. Our native French waiter and bus persons were first class. Thanks for an enjoyable meal!", "author": "Remy M."}

Although oddly situated at the end of strip club row on Broadway, you would never know it once you walk through the door. The interior, with it's fluffy pillows and muted earthtones, makes you feel as though you've stepped into a sanctuary for those who appreciate fine dining and excellent service. The hostess had a calm and welcoming demeanor as do the servers who seem incredibly well informed about the menu.  Looking very smart in a colorful array of suits, they managed to deliver a breadth of information and remain attentive to us even on what seemed to be a very busy night for them. With the cost of the menu (it's all fixed price: dinner, $75; tasting $105), I imagine they must make a killing working there. But I was surprised that they apply an automatic gratuity of 18% (which I found both unusual and yet uncharacteristically low by San Francisco standards) to every check in the house. \r\nThe food was outstanding on the whole. I was concerned about the portions at first, but trust me, after the nine or ten courses on the tasting menu, you will not leave hungry. I loved the Caviar, the Chanterelles with pappardelle and the Suckling pig, but I found the fourm d'ambert icemilk rather questionable. The blue cheese flavor was fine (although I'm sure that particular flavor is hit or miss with folks) but the textures just didn't do it for me in combo with the riesling gelee. Not to worry though, the desserts make up for it. The chocolate tart is delightfully paired with a lime yogurt around the base of it, (Who other than Patterson would have thought to make such a match?). \r\nThe lounge, the more casual \"first come first serve\" side of the restaurant which serves food a la carte (and a la less expensive) will be my next stop. It looked like the folks sitting in there were having a jovial time, enjoying their wine and beer (Coi does not serve cocktails), and what looked and smelled like a tasty stew of some sort....mmmmm. I highly recommend Coi to any type of person looking to branch out and try something new.", "author": "Regina P."}

as well. if you like mushrooms, this dish refines them for a delicately flavored course. plenty of interesting textures as well. \n\nslightly rare, the MARIN SUN FARMS GOAT (sprouted seeds/nuts/beans, wheatgrass) was surprisingly healthy (and not gamey at all) for a meat dish. tender meat, delicately prepared, with crunchy nuts and beans. a combination of perfectly runny yolk and buttery foam, the bf's SLOW COOKED EGG (farro, chard, brown butter)--a meatless sub--was quite good too!\n\nafter the previous courses, the few slices of COMTE with lightly coated lettuce leaves was a bit underwhelming, although the cheese was good. \n\nthe intercourse of BEET juice puree atop a creamy powder was sweet, slightly tart and salty\n\ncouldn't taste the olive oil in the OLIVE OIL SHORTCAKE (strawberry-rhubarb, lemon balm, long pepper), but the combination of fruits were prominent in flavor--sweet, tart, salty\n\nthe WHITE CHOCOLATE SEMI-FROZEN (brooks cherry, lime thyme) is a creamy white pillar accented by soft little thyme leaves, tangy sweet cherries in syrup, and crumbly cake\n\nthe crunchy cookie crumbles coating the CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES were the dominant texture and flavor. texture was more interesting than flavor. along with the truffles, we ended our meal with OLIVE OIL VANILLA bean milk shake. the olive oil added another layer of creamy complexity.\n\nhealthy, light, earthy, the cuisine at coi seems the kind of food forest elves would eat. some looked strange, but the flavors were familiar, often combining savory with sweet and tartness. some flavor combos were better than others, but none were off. each course delicately crafted.\n\nthey only offer a tasting menu-no a la carte & small portions. for me, grazing on ten courses over three hours was sufficiently filling, but i don't recommend coming here starving. kudos for cloth towels in the bathroom & interesting artwork on the walls, which appeared to be photograms of cross-sections of food in black and white. excellent service. more silverware than you know what to do with. \n\nfood porn: http://tinyurl.com/ozl6y6", "author": "Dao N."}

I scored a reservation in the lounge, however, the full menu is served there.   The place is sleek, cool, with the exception of the hairy pillows, which seem utterly misplaced.  Service is as cool as the setting, even detached.  However, compliment a plate of food and the servers melt.  \n\nI go for the full tasting menu.  It is possible to order every dish from this menu ala carte.  This would be a mistake, as you would miss a real experience, and also many plates are very small and highly priced.  A recipe for dissatisfaction.\n\nGrapefruit, ginger, taragon, and black pepper is accompanied by a cologne that you rub on the back of your hand to produce a scent of the plate as vivid as the taste.  Wonderful.\nThree small rounds different beet varieties, unmarinated, are topped with citrus gels.  Nice.\nFromage blanc tart is a miraculously thin pastry within which is some cheese and cheese foam that tastes deeply of dairy.  It is sided with pole beans, little gem lettuce and a tomato vinaigrette.  Miraculous.\nThree tiny bits of poached spiny lobster are just barely cooked through.  Almost sushi.  But the radish that accompany the bits of beast are both assertive and sweet at the same time.  Also on the plate are apple, fennel and chervil.  The fennel flowers are beautiful, the plate a visual masterpiece. \nA roasted floret of cauliflower tastes deeply of the garden.  It is served in a broth laden with picked red onion.  A foam above the broth tastes deeply of fatty bone marrow.  How did they conceive and pull off this minor miracle of taste?\nI don't particularly care for seaweed.  However, tofu mousseline, yuba, seaweeds and mushroom dashi has me rethinking.  This dish is remarkable for the contrasts of taste and texture.  Another big winner.\nMatsutake grilled mushroom accompanies a potato-pine needle puree.  I am disappointed that this plate is only very good.\nSeared bison is blood red, tender, and has that taste of real meat.  It is accompanied by turnip greens that are akin to horseradish.  The turnip itself is tender and almost a palate cleanser.  Great food. \nEtude cheese comes with some chunks of yellow barhi dates and black walnuts. Very nice.\nAs desserts come so increases the size of each plate.  First, quince and huckleberry parfait is light and the huckleberry ice is wondrous.  Next, chocolate ganache with violet ice cream.  Very good.\nFinally, two sweet amuse bouche.  First, a chocolate chip cookie truffle.  Beautiful.  Next a vanilla ice cream shake.  Deep, deep taste of vanilla.  Great.  \n\nMy only criticism, aside from the pillows and somewhat uncomfortable seating in the lounge, relates to the progression of the meal.  All of the savory courses are very small.  In fact, the staff asked twice if there was adequate food.  The sweet courses that followed were much larger and then followed by two sweet amuses.  Better to up-size a savory course and hold back a bit on the sweets. \n\nEvery plate of food can't wow you.  We all have different preferences.  However, even those that I only liked were of real interest.  The number of wow courses recommends this place.  Visit at least once and then decide how often to come back.", "author": "David D."}

Coi is a gem of a restaurant in the edge of North Beach that delivers an entertaining meal in the form of a eleven course tasting menu.  \n\nThis night saw the kitchen putting out dishes like a \"salad\" of grapefruit and tarragon with some sort of foam, along with a drop of a grapefruit-tarragon fragance to enjoy with the dish; coconut and kaffir lime panna cotta with shaved asparagus; a goat cheese number in a caraway shell served with beet puree; a delicious poached egg with morel mushrooms; an interesting tofu dish; a cold english pea soup with home made ricotta; and lamb two ways.\n\nThe whole meal hung together like a well made pearl necklace. This said, I must admit that I found few individual dishes extraordinary. The exceptions to this were the desserts.  I found the celery sorbet that was placed on top of the carrot cake to be fantastic.  And both my companion and myself thought the vanilla milkshake with salt and olive oil we had at the end was the best dish of the whole meal.  It was an excellent way to end the night.\n\nService was good.  The staff was incredibly accommodating of my companion, who somewhat intolerant of wheat and much sugar.  They allowed her to substitute some dishes for dishes that normally you'd have to choose one of two.  The staff was also very knowledgeable about the food, wines and the excellent Brazilian coffee we had at the end.\n\nThe night was not without a few hiccups.  They mixed up one of my orders, delivering a tofu dish rather than the abalone I had ordered.  I kept the tofu as it was tasty as well.  We also wished the pace between dishes was a little faster and that there were a byte or two more per dish, so as to enjoy it more.  In addition, while we found the staff most friendly and enjoyable, it did seem like we had to catch their eye once or twice to get their attention.  At this price range, that should not be necessary.\n\nNonetheless, this was an excellent meal and we look forward visiting again to see what new dishes the kitchen generates.", "author": "E L."}

I wasn't really let down, although I think my expectations were a bit too high. The decor is nice; the dining room is slightly dim with a simple design but I think it suits the restaurant well because your food is anything but simple! I thought the waiters were quite helpful and friendly and I didn't have any problems with the timing of the dishes coming out. I definitely have to say that the food is different/experimental, things that I have never eaten before or even really thought about eating to begin with. While I felt physiologically full at the end, I didn't necessarily feel satisfied by the food, but that might be because I'm not used to eating such a multitude of tiny, tiny dishes.

It is fancy but without the snobbery.  I had just finished getting tattooed for the past 2 hours and had reservations at Coi right afterward.  The tasting menu was well thought out and prepared to perfection.  All fresh, seasonal ingredients were meticulously presented.  Everything tasted light and effortless and the service was on point without being overdone.  I don't think I have ever seen such creativity with food without it being complicated.\nI made the mistake of ordering a half bottle of wine when I really should have signed up for a full bottle.  After I finished the first half bottle, I had to purchase another one as it was so good - which ended up costing more than 1 full bottle in the long run.\nThis amazing dining experience came with a hefty price tag, but it was worth every penny.

Despite its proximity to the 'clubs' of North Beach (you know the ones), once you walk in the door, the atmosphere is calm and upscale.  The lounge area is comfortably furnished, and a bar menu (with many of the same items that are offered in the dining room) is served a la carte.\n\nCherry blossom arrangements warm up the sleek space, and the detail that went in to the ceiling and wall treatments makes for a very unified look.  In the dining room, menus are prix fixe - a four-course menu with 3 choices per course, and a 12-course chef tasting menu.  The meal started with 2 amuses - a cepe gelee with a strip of candied watermelon, followed by a dollop of minced roasted beets with a citrus sorbet.  Both were simply presented and absolutely delicious.  The portion sizes for the 4 course meal were relatively small, so we left feeling satisfied but not uncomfortably full.  Presentations were artful, and usually the items were separated on the plate, so you can enjoy the tastes separately or combine them if you wish.  Unique ingredients and preparations include a fennel and kumquat salad, trout sashimi, potato foam (basically the lightest whipped potatoes you've ever had), short rib served as steak medallions.  The wine list is varied, with many selections from Spain, France, Argentina, Washington State, etc. (nice to see a wine list in San Francisco that isn't entirely focused on Napa Valley cabs).  Wine prices are high - it was difficult to find a decent bottle under $50.  They only serve wine and beer --- liquor will come eventually, which should help the lounge scene.\n \nThe staff were friendly and welcoming.  The service was perfectly timed, attentive but not obtrusive, and everyone was polite and polished (well-dressed, too!).  The staff was subtle, but we were never lacking for water, wine, or the proper utensils.  Our waiter was very passionate about Daniel Patterson's creations.\n\nFor the price, this won't be a frequent haunt - but for a splurge, I would highly recommend giving it a try.", "author": "Julie L."}

The waiter insisted on bringing me an alternative - the slow cooked egg, which was absolutely divine!\n- Gorgeous presentation! \n- The service was outstanding. I think it was the best service I have experienced so far in San Francisco (though at times a bit slow). The waiters knew all sorts of details about the food and could answer all the questions I asked without referring back to the chef. The attitude was great - at the start of the meal they noted down our food likes and dislikes (my husband won't eat certain spices and goat's cheese), and adapted the menu accordingly. At the cheese course, I had the divine rocotta and rhubarb on the menu and they brought my husband a wonderful aged Comte, which he raved about (it took him back to his childhood in France - yes, he's French)!\n- A wonderful and unforgettable culinary adventure!\n\nThe lows:\n- The price - this is the most expensive restaurant I have been to in SF - more expensive than Michael Mina and Gary Danko. Having said that, for the price you are getting a 3 hour eating 'experience'. . . \n- The whole experience took 3 hours. This was actually a feature for a first visit, when everything is so fun and exciting. I think that if I went back I would find this tedious.\n- The goat course (this is personal - the people on the table next to us loved it!).

It comes as something of a surprise, then, that an elegant and upscale-- if unpretentious-- restaurant has slipped in under our noses. The lower Broadway establishment is named COI , French for tranquil. The chef and owner, Daniel Patterson comes to this new venture after the much lamented demise of his former restaurant, Elizabeth-David which had been one of my personal favorites. \n\nStill an under-the-radar gem, COI, lives up to its name from the moment you walk through the door. The walls are painted milk chocolate and papered with earthy grass cloth, almost emitting an aroma of its own.  The subtle art work, flowers, upholstered chairs, dropped faux ceiling of hand-made paper all flow together exquisitely.\n\nThe menu is prefixed, with a $75 Dinner and a $105 Tasting Choice. If you think the meal pricey, consider the cost of a good seat at a major theatre for three hours of entertainment. On both our visits to \n COI, the presentation and meal took three hours, and the experience was as dramatic as a fine play. \n\nThe courses come quickly and time flies by. You are never bored. I wondered about the 18% gratuity, shared by the entire wait staff, but the friendly crew seamlessly glided from table to table, taking orders, explaining the menu, replacing silver and tending to every detail it takes to make a great meal ebb and flow.\n\nThe nine course Tasting Menu at first seemed intimidating, but the portions are very small, focusing on original combinations of foods, oils, herbs and other ingredients. The California Osetra Caviar portion was no bigger than two fifty-cent pieces but the flavor was a million dollars. Imagine sauted bone marrow, topped with a dollop of caviar and beet gelee. I looked around to see if anyone was looking, as I wanted to run my finger across the plate for the last taste of beet. Unbelievable! Then the Sea Scallop Sashimi arrived, with minutely shaved avocado, radishes, and baby nasturtiums topping it. The scallop melted on my tongue and when I started to chew, a tiny piece of sea salt exploded in my mouth. Sitting back, I let the flavors meld before I took another bite. The first spoonful of the Chilled English Pea Soup, which was poured around a cluster of raw, fresh peas with ricotta yogurt, led me to close my eyes in sensual appreciation. The fresh mint in the puree transported me back to my childhood in my mother's garden. Each of the following dishes was a joy to look at and more of a pleasure to eat.\n\nThe deserts are seasonal, with a few favorites left on the menu. There is a great variety for everyone's taste from creations of fresh fruit, with sweet and tart flavors, to creamy chocolate that tastes like velvet on your tongue. On my first visit to COI, I sampled the lemon, three layered, pie in a tall tubular shape. It was beyond outstanding. I felt like crying when it wasn't offered on the second visit. \n\nFor those disinclined to rob Fort Knox or take out a second mortgage on their home, there is another way to visit COI.  One can enjoy the lounge menu without confronting the dining room prices. I have yet to have this experience, but some say the food is even better.\n\nChefs of San Francisco, stand at attention. Daniel Patterson has a winner here, and in my opinion, it is the best restaurant in San Francisco. And it is right here in our neighborhood!\n\n    \n\n     \n     COI, 353 Broadway, 393-9000", "author": "Carol P."}

After trying most of the usual restaurants in san francisco, we decided to give this one a heads up. Eating here is one of the best dining experiences i have had in quite a while. The lounge area simply put, left me estatic. The decor and the wine menu there made it worth us spending most of our late evening there.  The tab did get to be on the higher side of the scale, but given the prompt service and outstanding ambience we could not have asked for anything more.

The waiter had no idea what wine or food he was serving.  \nThe food was so heavily vegetarian that I was still hungry after the meal.  We had the tasting menu, which consisted of about 8 courses, and I honestly can only remember the meat dish, and perhaps that is because it was only meat dish among a sea of bite-sized vegetable medleys.  Needless to say, I was not impressed.\nWhile the presentation was good, it was not the best I've seen.  This meal was for me the definition of form without substance, presentation without flavor, and pretentiously finicky.  \nThe waiter boasted about having worked at Gramercy Tavern, but I found that very difficult to believe.  I've eaten at Gramercy on many occasions and never have I encountered a waiter there who knew as little about the food he was serving than this man.  Perhaps he meant to say he worked at Gramercy for a day before he was fired for being incompetent.", "author": "A J."}

The second, expensive. We did the tasting menu which included 11 courses and nothing really stood out. Just about everything came with some kind of a twist. For example, we got a tiny vanilla milkshake with a few drops of olive oil and surprisingly it was good. One thing I didn't like was the dish that came with 3 quarter sized beets. There just wasn't anything special about it. Service, overall was OK. They did a great job at explaining everything and were on top of most things. One thing I didn't like was that in the beginning of the meal you are supposed to get a spoon with some kind of honey amuse busch and we didn't get it for some reason although everyone else seemed to get it. Another thing I didn't like was that although the table of 2 next to our table of 3 got there when we were into our third course finished well before we did and it had nothing to do with how fast/slow we ate cause seriously...how long does it take to consume a tablespoon of food? For some reason they started to get everything like 5-10 minutes before we would get ours so we had a lot of down time which was a bit annoying at times. Overall, it was an interesting experience and something everyone should do at least once in life. Is it worth the $120+ price tag? Absolutely not but I don't regret doing it. I probably won't be coming back anytime soon. I'd much rather drop $500 on a dinner at a place like Michael Minna or Viognier than this spot.", "author": "Diane M."}

After reading so many great revues, my wife and I were expecting a wonderful dining experience.  We are from out of state and had dined at Ubuntu, Meadowood, and Gary Danko the consecutive evenings before our experience at COI.  COI will go down in our dining history book as the most expensive worst  dinner ever!  When we drove to COI, there was no name on the front of the building.  After being seated, there was no menu and our server explained the 11 course menu.  I had to ask the price of the tasting and paired wines.  We elected to do the 11 course with a bottle of wine from their wine list.  Next our server brought two wine glasses that were hot to the touch.  A bottle of not very cold white wine followed with appologies for the temperature.  Hindsight says that we should have left before they opened the wine.  Service was prompt and attentive by servers that had the personalities of zombies.  All had stone faces and displayed no personalities.  The courses were beautiful in presentation.  Three of them were very very salty.  Three of the eleven were good.  The other five courses were mediocre at best.  If I were Michelin, I would revaluate any stars for this restaurant.  At the end of the meal we were presented with our check and noticed that an 18% gratuity was automatically added to the bill.  I resent being forced to tip by the restaurant.  I normally tip 20% for an outstanding meal.  In retrospect they could not pay me to return.", "author": "Robert M."}

The restaurant is well-designed, in the modern, yet comfortable decor everyone is doing right now.  The lighting is pleasant and flattering and the seats were very comfy.  The service was good and everything the group ordered was well executed and very good.  My only warning is that it is over-priced, especially if you are ordering in the lounge, as we did.  I ordered a \"taste\" portion of something and got exactly what I expected, but one of my dining companions ordered a full version of the same thing and paid twice as much but we couldn't tell the difference between the portions.  I think they put one or two more bites on her plate than on mine and we actually asked the waiter to confirm she got the full portion.  She did.  Yikes.

I didn't like the lighting at all.\n\nService: Very well polished but slightly cold until the end of our experience when the dining room started to clear out a bit. There was a little bit of a mistake with the wine pairings. They asked if I wanted them and I said no but they marked our table for them anyways. I reminded them I didn't want them the waiter apologized and offered a glass anyways. And silly me I thought that meant I was getting a free class of wine for their small mistake. ( In which case I would have been impressed) but alas when my bill came their was my delicious Riesling. So anyways I ended up paying for 4 glasses of wine ( 2 courses for 2 people) all together that I didn't really want but at least they were delicious.\n\nFood: I contimplated just writing Slow Cooked Farm Egg on this review. Yes it was that good.. great... amazing... perfect. Quite possibly the best dish I have ever had. Between the runny yolk and the green farro and the savory tasting foam I was in heaven. And then when I looked down at my empty plate a horrible wave of sadness... it was over.... So obviously there were dishes I loved. But in all honesty despite our first amuse which was delicious there were only 4 dishes that really stood out as great on an 11 course tasting menu. Those being Shiny Beets, Abstraction of Garden in Winter, Earth and Sea, and Slow Cooked Farm Egg. And then there were a couple dishes that I was just unimpressed with all together. These being the almost tasteless Crab Melt, the Nettle-Ricotta Cannelloni, and Pink Grapefruit but to be honest I keep going back and forth on that one. Between me and my date we tried every dish on the menu 15 dishes all together. Meaning Four were great and I would happily go back and eat them if only they had a ala carte menu. 3 where not horrible but I would definitely use the meh to describe them. And  8 dishes that were ok to good. Now I am sure I went in there with higher expectations being it was a 2 michelin star rated restaurant but for  me I didn't really get it. I am the first to admit the chef there is very talented but I just felt slightly disappointed when I left. If not for that Slow Cooked Farm Egg which my lame self occasionally has dreams about I would have been pretty upset.\n\nCost: Another factor is I by no means have enough money to eat here. I work in the industry and save until I can go somewhere. This also might have put a little extra pressure on Coi to impress. For 2 people the total cost was $350 plus tip. Thats two tasting menus (their only option) and 4 glasses of wine.\n\nOverall: If you have the money go. It's always worth the experience if you really love food and the restaurant industry. Besides Slow Cooked Farm Egg! I think it made the list of 100 things to do before you die?!!? It's incredibly amazing 2 of those stars go directly to it!!", "author": "Meryl K."}

Perfect one or two bites depending on how big your mouth is.  Outstanding wine list, but no cocktails...they do not serve hard alcohol so if you wanted to start off with a martini you are S.O.L The menu is changed almost daily and from my experience and others that have been there it is mostly vegetarian with some seafood and one meat dish which was peking duck when i was there... let me say that it was perfect, crisp, flavorful skin, fat was rendered perfectly.  They also were somewhat accommodating to a guest who came with us that was pregnant, which was nice.  atmosphere is extremely stuffy though, i guess that is what you get at a $165 a person dinner, believe wine pairing is an extra $135 or so.

If you want that, go to Masa's or the Dining Room at the Ritz. No, this is much different from that. More about textures and smells and unusual combinations of unusual ingredients. Doesn't work 100% of the time, but everything is very interesting. We had a couple of really standout courses, a few really good ones, and a couple that we could have done without. You need to have a open mind and no particular expectations. Price for the 11 courses is normal for the genre, though wine pairing seems a bit expensive (but some interesting ones and overall well-paired). The space is modern; a bit spare, more casual feeling, if anything (and there were various levels of dress here, from rolled up shirtsleeves to jackets, for men). Music was eclectic. Service staff are professional and alert and their interaction with you seems more based on your interaction with them; i.e. they're quite discreet if you don't pay them much attention, but are friendly if you are to them first. This from our own experience where we started out not really paying any attention to them, other than to acknowledge their service with a \"thank you\"; but when we said a few things to them about a particular course, they were much more openly friendly.

Still, the first experience did leave a nasty after taste, and for that I can only give it 3 stars.", "author": "Justine J."}

So intimate everyone can here each others convos LOL. But really, no one minded because most were too distracted with the great food and great wine. We ordered a bottle of white wine, that had a name too long and complicated too remember, that I randomly picked from their list of 350 options. But boy did I pick right. The wine was so crisp and smooth it went with everything we ordered. We ate light since we decided to save our bellies for more alcohol consumption afterwards. We ordered the crab meat, abalone, chicken stew and sirloin. Our server thought my date was ordering all that for himself and warned us that was a lot just for one. However, we initially wanted to share and we laughed silly when the food came with it's tiny portions. Not a bad thing though since that is what this restaurant is all about. Expensive small tasty portions. Would definitely come back to try the tasting menu and get the full on experience. Maybe some other time when I've got $400 extra to spend.", "author": "Liss E."}

I finally was able to reach someone and got reservation for the date and time I wanted but at the lounge area instead of main dining room.  The lounge chair was comfy but the space/table was very small.  We were sitting at the table facing the door so I was getting blinded with every car's headlights stopping at the signal.  It was a bit annoying.  I should have brought my sunglasses with me.  The food was amazing. Flavor was great but was very light with small portions.  We had tried many fine dining restaurants but this was the first time we walked out feeling \"not\" satisfied...it's hard to believe after an 11 course dinner and a pretty hefty bill!  I think it needed more protein dishes. The service was great.  I do have one complaint though.  There were little fruit flies flying around while we were trying to enjoy our meal.  My husband chased and killed one.  I had one landed right on my bread that I had to return it. The waitress didn't really acknowledge my complaint.  I guess maybe it's a common problem.  For $125 pre-fix meal, I think they should fix the problem.  Overall it's good food but not an enjoyable atmosphere.", "author": "raiderslum L."}

Still, i was in bliss all night and had an amazing date with my boyfriend before continuing on to a fabulous play we opted for over the lap dances. but i wanted to tell my gracious boyfriend (who thinks this place is the shiznit)  \"darling, don't waste your money on coi!\".", "author": "little gem z."}

I make it a point to eat at most all notable new restaurants and was looking forward to COI.   Although the presentation was beautiful I had to return my first course (scallop tartare) as the citrus flavor was so overpowering.  The replacement crab course I received though was quite enjoyable.  I would have returned to cod entree also as it was too salty, but decided perhaps I came on an off evening.   My friend who ordered the guinea hen entree and it was was quite good and balanced.  The food was creative, such as the refreshing celery ice cream, but I think the menu misses more times than the hits.  There were 3 of us who ordered different courses and less than 1/2 of them were repeaters.   I agree with the reviewer who said if the prices were cut in half and they tried to stick to some basics instead of trying to make every course a masterpiece this restaurant would fare better in my book.  As a note to the people who work there...Patrons can hear you talking about them from the ladies restroom!!!!", "author": "Bay Area G."}
