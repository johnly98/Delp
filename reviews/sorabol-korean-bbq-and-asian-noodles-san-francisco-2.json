I haven't been here in a long time, but I remembered that they had a small food court here before. Out of all the options, Sorabol stood out to us so we decided to check it out.\n\nUsually the food at mall food courts isn't very good. I also didn't want to pay a huge amount of money for not-so-good food, especially considering I always spend $15+ at the Westfield food court, but the prices here are actually pretty affordable for SF standards. I decided to get the BBQ chicken with half sweet potato noodles, half white rice, and some broccoli and kimchi. It was so ridiculously good! I actually don't like sweet potatoes, but the noodles were great and filling. I also felt a bit better knowing they are a bit healthier than regular noodles.

Times have changed since Bay Street was built in Emeryville.\n\nThen I found Sorabol in Sun Valley Mall, and it was a let down because it was different and it disoriented me for a bit. \n\nNow there is this Sorabol in the new Metreon Food Court. It has some of the same items and flavors, like the chicken bowl, etc., but has its own twist to what I remember way back when. \n\nI guess it is a franchise chain trying to bring fast food concepts to Korean food. Or is it Korean Food to fast food concepts? \n\nIt hasn't found the secret formula Asian fast food success, like Panda Express has, but they have been at it longer. This is more like the Pho franchise of Pho Hoa, you know, those with the green and red colored menus. It is a franchise too. You didn't know that? Not sure what sort of support in exchange for a royalty payment Pho Hoa gives, but it is looser than Panda Express, which may be company owned, not franchised. I am not sure. \n\nBut Sorabol gives you a hint of Korean flavors with their meat bowls, optional kimchi, and their \"sauce\" they poor on your meat and rice. \n\nThe thing that is similar with all of them, is that they always seem to have a large grilled filled with chicken cooking on it. \n\nThere was one older Korean lady, presumably the owner working here, other wise, there were young people from all sorts of background working here. So I guess the franchisee can hire who they want. Whereas every Panda Express I have ever been in, they have Asian women serving you, and Latino men frying in all up in the wok.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

I'd say out of all the vendors at Metreon's food court, their BBQ Chicken Bowl is one of the best 'bang for your buck' deals for under $10.  You get a big bowl with a generous amount of BBQ Chicken over a bed of rice or japchae (I usually ask for half and half) topped with House BBQ Sauce, steamed broccoli, and kimchee.  That's plenty of food to hold me over during those long wait times for advance screenings.  I haven't really tried anything else from them other than their bulgogi, but I don't think there's a need for me to since their BBQ Bowls are good enough for me and they've been pretty quick to put it together.

I usually go to the Sorabol location inside Westfield's, but I was at the Metreon for a movie, so I gave this place a try. My first visit there was kind of rushed, it was around 5:45-6 and the employee was asking, \"what would you like to order, soup?\" I wasn't going to try a soup because I had a movie at 6:30, but she seemed very enthusiastic about selling the soup, so I ordered the spicy beef soup. I asked if this was the tofu stew, and she said I could add tofu for $1 or so, so I didn't the tofu. The food came pretty fast, they boiled the soup and poured it into the plastic bowl. The soup comes with a medium sized Chinese takeout container of rice and small container of kimchi. There was SO much rice and a huge bowl of soup! I am super pleased with the portion size, but the price was ($9.73 +tax). I left in about 8 minutes. I mean, I saved half for the next day as lunch. The soup was a little more salty than I had wanted, but the taste is of a more Americanized type of Korean food. I kinda expected that when there weren't any Korean people working there. I was craving Korean food so I went back to this same location. This time I ordered the 2 item combo with glass noodle, rice, chicken and beef stew in a bowl. I actually love their plastic bowls, it's a decent size (7\" diameter). The noodles tasted good, but it only contained noodles, I thought this was jap chae with onions and some vegies, but nope, just seasoned noodles. The chicken was decent \"food court\" chicken, not bad but not the best either/kinda dry. But I love the beef stew! All the items except the rice was a little more salty than I usually eat, but the stew was amazing! They gave me two big scoops and the meat was tender, salty and sweet. The total for the 2 item combo was 10.82 +tax. Just like last time, I had plenty of leftovers and saved the rest for lunch the next day.

The broccoli was decent but didn't have much flavor. The man working there was really nice too :)", "author": "Alexandra W."}

It was really flavorful, and seemingly low carb. There was beef, bean sprouts, egg and onions. The option for rice was available, but I declined. The best part was that they made it right on the spot...not this morning, not last week. Right there! I would definitely go back. I gave it 3 stars because the staff seemed unorganized and confused about the whole ordering process....like it was the first time they had done it before or like it was their first day in business.", "author": "Gina T."}

It was fairly cooked in a good amount of time. Meat was tender and juicy. The kimchi was not too spicy. The little anchoives are my favorite. \n\nSERVICE: Service was okay. There were some that had to ask another colleague what item was what or how much it was...doesn't training require to know your items on the menu? \n\nPRICE: way too expensive! The one item meal is about $8...which I expected, but if you wanted to add more of those little side dishes that usually come with korean bbq they're about $1.50 each! I might as well go to another korean bbq place where it comes with the meal for free...\n\nOVERALL: If I am desperately in that mood of korean bbq, I'd go back. Otherwise, if I need my asian fix, I might as well go back to Coriander. The food was great. It's more of the pricing and service I'm not too keen on. Try it yourself. Perhaps you will get a different experience.", "author": "Isabel N."}

Spicy BBQ chicken was nice and spicy, noodles were pretty good, brown rice was cooked well.  Doesn't compare to real Korean BBQ by any means,  but not a terrible choice if you're looking for some quick Korean food while at the Metreon", "author": "Bill R."}

Overpriced food, they should not even be allowed to call this Korean food. This sorry excuse of a fast food joint could be the reason why North Korea is building a nuclear bomb to use against us.", "author": "Steve M."}

Ive been dying to get my hands on some Korean grub for 3 months! What a dissapointment. I went for the Soondooboojeegae. Tofu soup. And it tasted like pure Korean spicy paste and was wayyyyy too salty. no eggs or side dishes ew", "author": "Sady C."}

It was shockingly tough and gristly.  \n\nI had eaten there before and gotten the grilled chicken both times, and enjoyed it both times.  And the noodles, broccoli, and kimchi are all great.  Love that you can get brown rice instead of white.\n\nHowever, the beef I had today was unacceptably bad.  Hopefully this was just an off batch of meat, or maybe they can change the cut they use... but something's gotta change.", "author": "Angie B."}

My boyfriend got the 2 item combo plate with the spicy chicken and spicy beef. While it was a great deal of food for $9.95, there wasn't any flavor. I opted for the tofu/veggie noodle soup in miso broth and it tasted like steamed veggies in boiling water :( Service with a smile, but wouldn't recommend the food.", "author": "Tori M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-04-20", "description": "Looks like the Metreon is on its way back...in that it always had a spirit of a place that was one time pretty cool...but sort of lacking...but with a few new businesses it looks like the metreon is on the way up! Sorabol just opened...like a few hours ago.  And it didn't even seem to have any first day issues...everything went smoothly...food was decent (think mall food) but the giveaway was that there was no menu sign.  So everything was a bit of a mystery.  Apparently it was overlooked as everyone was just focusing on the construction.  Rest assured its on its way...would i make a trip to the metreon for this place.  No...but is it a good choice if I happen to be there to see a movie and I have a limited time and perhaps a limited budget...absolutely.  The staff was super friendly too!", "author": "Kierstan G."}

There was huge line as Oracle World is in town.  The line moved very quick and the service was fast and friendly.  I had the to 2 entree special, Spicy Bar-B-Que Chicken and the Beef Rib Stew, with brown rice.  It also came with Kimchi which was a little bland.  The spicy chicken was was very good, nice tangy sauce and the chicken was cook just right.  The Beef Rib was OK, the beef was over cooked and a little chewy.  The sauce and the veggies where fine.  Overall a decent meal but a tad bit expensive for lunch $12.00 which included organic mango Oolong tea.  Yes for location and access to the great outdoors in the middle of SF!", "author": "Prescott R."}

Worst yet is the unfriendly attitude of their servers.  It's too bad that the whole food court has suffered after Borders moved out, but, really, you have to do better on food and service to keep people coming.  Plenty of other better Korean options.", "author": "Jim W."}

This place service of some of the most generous portions of tasty Korean morsels this side of Seoul.  Really like seeing many of the Korean side dishes that I love so much.   They did a nice job remodeling the Metreon food court and the free wifi is a plus.   Spicy Pork and grilled chicken are incredible.   Run don't walk to this place.", "author": "Sven B."}
