It was my first time at a Korean BBQ and this place was wonderful!  We ordered Dinner B; Kalbi, Sang Sun Jun, Jap Chae, Man Du Guk, Pan Fried Tofu and Dried Seaweed. All this on top of the array of ban chan (and rice). Dinner for two was enough to feed a family of five. Staggering! There was a mound of kalbi and it was cut differently than I expected; the bones were cut out and the meat was sliced thickly. The excellent house marinade made the meat absolutely delicious grilled. The rest of the food was good, but it all seemed to be there to add contrast to the wonderful kalbi.\n\nManager Tony was extremely attentive and helpful (without being obtrusive) during our meal, ably backed up by our server, Kim.\n\nI adore the slow food style of eating; leisurely cooking, tasting, drinking and resting with conversation. This place was perfect for people with a lot of time, it's practically an event!\n\nThe place is clean, but the decor, etc. is a little dated and too bright to be romantic. Ir's more of a \"friends and family\" sort if restaurant. Excellent meal, but next time we'll bring along another couple to share our dinner for two.", "author": "Toki N."}

In summary- mediocre items at a higher price point that just isn't worth it- and I won't be back again soon.\n\nAcross the street from Japantown, it's definitely a convinient location to attract a lot of people into getting Korean food. Came with a date and we were both attracted by the 'KBBQ' sign out front, and the fact I was in the mood for Korean. And boy, did that KBBQ sign deceive me. First off, it's not AYCE. Secondly the meats that they do offer are just eh, and for the price tag it's at, I expect MUCH better.\n\nBBQ Bulgogi ($22) - I mean this was fine for what it is. Good bulgogi for what it is, but not super mind blowing or amazing. But if you happen to be here getting KBBQ, I'd choose this over the next menu item I got.\n\nBBQ Kal bi ($29). The Kal Bi was dry. Like there was no actual moisture/taste left in the meat, and on top of that there were a couple of fat bones on top thrown in. I mean I don't know about you, but I can't eat just a solid bone, so that was odd. Definitely would not recommend getting this.\n\nAlso they were VERY insistent that they do the cooking for us at the grill, which I guess was a polite gesture but the lady who ended up cooking for us slightly overcooked the meats somewhat and it left them a lot drier than what I would have liked. I would have wanted to cook the meats ourselves but she was VERY insistent that she did it, so in the end we let her do her thing.\n\nService was alright. It could be much better though. The old woman who helped us was nice.\n\nI'd give New Korea House a very, VERY, very weak 2. The only reason why it's not a 1 at this point is that it wasn't the worst thing I've had, but I can't really recommend it here nor will I be back.

They could of put it away from the dining area.\n\nThe first thing we got were the rice and your typical Korean condiments. They only gave 6 condiments, your typical kimchee, sprouts, potatoes, but no greens....boring selection and it didn't taste clean. Next we got our entree and soup. The short rib we ordered was okay, but the portion was very small (for one person). Most other places we been to is good amount of meat for two people. It's overpriced at $16. The vegetable beef soup we got had barely any meat, mostly just vegetable and just enough for two bowls. Again, other places would have enough for a Third bowl.\n\nI've been to many Korean BBQ restaurants.

Dinner\n\nIt's a fact that there isn't enough competition or demand to drive down the prices of Korean BBQ down in San Francisco. There are well-established Korean restaurants in town but they are not in the league of the ones I have in LA.\n\nSo...you just have to own up to the choices you have here without spend an arm and leg. New Korea House serves very decent BBQ for the prices they charge. The menu is almost identical to that of Seoul Garden in side the Japan Center.\n\nMy BF never had Korean BBQ so this time we only ordered meat. Their appetizers are pretty good. The Haemul Pajon ($19.95) is a savory pancake with shrimp, squid, and clam is my favorite. If you want something of a smaller portion, get the Mung Bean Pancake ($3) and nosh over Soju.\n\nFor the evening we tried beef and chicken. At New Korea House, you can BBQ yourself with two or more orders of meat.\n\n*Bulgogi ($20.95): very tender and tasty marinated ribeye. I recommend bulgogi for first-timer. Beef sliced very thin with a tiny but of fat on the edge, making the grill sizzle when you cook. It takes only a few minutes to BBQ half a batch. Eat with rice or wrap the beef with the lettuce.\n\n*Ro Su Gui ($20.95): this is the same sliced beef but not marinated, served only with sesame oil and salt. If you're getting the bulgogi, try to eat the unmarinated beef first.\n\n*Dak Gui ($19.95): lackluster compared to the beef. Boneless chicken breast strips marinated with soy. Since chicken has to be fully cooked, after bring BBQ on the grill for a while, chicken became dry. BF agreed we can skip the chicken next time!\n\nThe overall meal was very sumptuous, with all-you-can-eat ban chai. Kimchi, sweet potato, pickled radish, bean sprouts, glazed nuts, seaweeds and jasmine rice. Service is attentive enough. Price is reasonable.\n\nThey don't take reservation, so get there early on weekends.

Pause for beaming. Anyway, old or new, Korea House strikes me as a rather bland place. The Korean barbecue places out in the Richmond make you reek of smoke, and you can count on some guy in a wife-beater carrying a bucket of coal to your table.\n\nHere at Korea House, it feels downright suburban, a family-friendly place like a Denny's in downtown Seoul or a Soulless Denny's, take your pick. I noticed no one was getting their fire hole lit up here probably because it's a safety hazard with all the toddlers running riot. We went predictable. Jamie ordered the standard-regulation $13.95 Bi Bim Bop, which mixed slices of marinated ribeye, veggies and an already fried egg on top of rice (see photo). It was a mistake because it came lukewarm. For only a dollar more, I got the Dol Sot Bi Bim Bop, which came with the same ingredients in a sizzling stone bowl (see photo).\n\nThe egg was raw, which I prefer, and the crust that develops on the rice at the bottom is worth savoring. As a starter, we ordered a couple of the $3 Bean Dae Duk, which are mung bean egg pancakes that came with a sweet dipping sauce (see photo). Given how bland the pancakes were, they tasted better with the red chili paste. And as with any Korean restaurant worth its salt, we were served ten little dishes of banchan, bite-size appetizers of just about everything that can be pickled (see photo). Service was nothing to complain about. They were attentive despite the growing number of tables that were filling up.

The only good thing was the stir fry clear noodle, dumpling soup, and the kimchi radish. Funny cuz they're side dishes. Anyways, poor service. No one came to ask us how we were doing and I had chase down this lady for a glass of water. The water was in a little glass cup. Also, the waiting line grew longer and it took 30 or more minutes for anyone to notice those people waiting for a table.

(Highly doubt anybody would've got that, unless you are a Kpop fan :P LOL). \nAfter walking about 2 miles to Japan Town my friend and I were pretty famished so I was SO HAPPY to stumble upon Korean House Restaurant right across the street from J Town. I was a happy girl for sure. \n\nKorean House Restaurant is such a homey place, great for an authentic Korean meal. We were welcomed in Korean and I just wished I knew a bit more Korean to correspond back. The ban chan that they served was delicious!  I had a few bites, but Celiacs should be aware that most Korean food contains wheat, at least what they serve in restaurants. The hot pepper paste does contain wheat from the soy sauce and the malt or barley powder that they use. \nI ordered the Dolsot Bibimbap which comes served in a stone clay pot and it was piping hot! As long as you don't add the Gochujang sauce the dish is naturally gluten free. \nThe Bibimbap was so delicious the crusty rice that forms at the bottom of the clay pot gets super crispy and flavorful as you mix all the meats and veggies together with the raw egg! I was so excited to dig in that I forgot to take a picture when it was first brought to the table, hence, the crappy picture. \n\nMy friend ordered the Japchae which is traditionally made with lots of soy sauce so I just took some pictures of the deliciousness", "author": "Tiffany L."}

In one Sunday Night, you had Valentine's Day, Chinese New Year and Tet, all falling on President's day weekend, where a lot of people were out on a Sunday like it was Saturday. \n\nConsequently, you know a lot of restaurants would be crowded. All the Chinese and Vietnamese would have families celebrating, all the fine dining spots of French, Nouvelle, Steakhouse and similar places would be packed with couples, so where to go?\n\nI headed for Japan Town. All of the restaurants there had waiting lines, too. So I went to an old stand by, a restaurant I used to go to a long time ago late at night after partying in the city because they were open until 3:00 am on Saturdays, and that was Korea House. \n\nKorea House is a popular name for a KBBQ place. Before i used to go to the one in Santa Clara, which burned down, and years later the owner reopened in Concord under the same name, and is one of my faves. But before there was a New Korea House downstairs, I used to go to this one, up the flight of stairs to a room full of hooded tables and in table cooking grills. \n\nIt hasn't changed much. I am not sure if it is open real late still, but the rest is as I remembered it. It is cheaper than Seoul Garden in the J-Town mall and just as good if not better.\n\nWe ordered Bulgogi (marinated beef $19.95) and Sam Gyup Sal (pork bellies $19.95). Out came a mountain of appetizers, 11 Banchan in all! We started with a large plate of pickled. non-spiced napa cabbage. Raddish soup. Then 10 banchan. then a large plate of chopped Romaine lettuce, and two platters of meat. \n\nAlthough the side dishes were impressive, the meat wasn't particularly. The Bulgogi was good, but I have had more meat, better marinade, and better tasting. The Sam Gyup Sal wasn't the best, either, as I have had much better down in K-Town in LA or the OC. And down in SoCal there is a price war going on, so it is cheaper.\n\nService was good, but there were only 3 people working including the cook, so they were pressed to keep up with nearly a full house.  \n\nKorea House is still a reliable go to KBBQ house in Japan Town after all these years.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

The prices for the meat dishes aren't the cheapest but the servings are a decent size and the banchan are plentiful so I always factor this into the price. The restaurant has good gas BBQs built into the table and the staff always ask if you want to cook or have them do this. I like this because some diners don't like to handle the fire but I prefer to take time to cook and enjoy the drinks and conversation. The BBQ and the dumplings are pretty good but the best thing here is the soon doobu - spicy soft tofu. Service is attentive and food comes out fast; good for a mid week date.", "author": "Amaya B."}

New Korea House is my favorite Korean restaurant in SF.  I first went to NKH a few years ago based on a friend's recommendation and have returned often because of the clean atmosphere, great food, and even better service.  It's the perfect place to catch up with friends, while enjoying delicious, well-prepared food.  Regardless if I am with my Korean or non-Korean speaking friends, the wait staff consistently treats us with friendly, prompt, and attentive service (unlike some of the other not-so-friendly, and dingy Korean places in the Richmond).  Several times the the owner (a really nice Korean lady) has come out to give us a free dish, simply as a courtesy.  Talk about \"service\"!\n\nI recommend the spicy pork and naegmyun.  The kalbi is always really great too (make sure you cook the bones too so you can give them to your dog :)).  They use very good quality meat and the marinade / flavor is highly addictive!  I've lived in both NY and LA, and NKH certainly rivals the best BBQ places in those respective KTowns.  One added benefit: parking is very convenient.  It's located right across the the street from Japantown.  You can watch a movie at Kabuki or get ice cream afterward... although just a warning:  you might not have room for that ice cream after a delicious and filling meal from NKH.", "author": "Catherine D."}

Korea House is one of two on the block.  I've never been to the other one.  No sure why but I always choose KH because I find the \"look\" of the dining area appealing.  Nothing special about it; just the normal layout of BBQ tables on each side of the room with a couple of large tales for big groups.\n\nI almost always go to Korean restaurants only for the BBQ.  So, I can't speak about any other dishes. but I the BBQ is very good.  KH also has very good fans over the grills; you don't smell like BBQ when you leave and a decent selection of banchan w/unlimited refills.  Oddly, they charge extra for seaweed ($2) and lettuce ($4) which is a little steep but they give reasonable refills if you run out.  \n\nHad kalbi ($29) and chicken ($20) on the trip tonight.  They precut the kalb for you rather than giving you a long strip attached to the bone (which is ok by me) but they still leave the bones on the plate for you to grill (if you like) as I like to do.  The kalbi is nicely marinated as is the chicken.  The beef was a little tough but the chicken was really tender after cooking.\n\nService is always responsive and efficient.  Ask for something and you get it right away.  No complaints.  KH isn't much different that the Korean places on Geary but it's a novelty in J-town and, if you're visiting the mall or taking in a movie at the Kabuki, it's really convenient to eat hear especially if you're parked in the lot.  \n\nIt can get pretty busy on a weekend evening but if you get there early you shouldn't have any problem  getting a table right away.

While I've definitely had better Korean food, I feel as though what I eat here is definitely above average.  A few of the items (such as the Daeji Bulgogi) are not as spicy or flavorful as I'm used to, but it's still tasty.\n\nA typical meal here involves Japchae and an assortment of cooked on the grill items, such as bulgogi, daeji bulgogi, chicken, and shrimp.  There is also a tripe soup that is excellent.  Service here is fairly good and I can tell that the food is fresh.  I can't really complain.\n\nI did happen to notice that service can sometimes be a little less than attentive, but I understand that they get busy and might be understaffed.", "author": "Ian M."}

At one point, they came over to close off our private room with the accordion partition - like those things will reduce noise! Maybe we were too embarassing for the other patrons to look at... THOSE CLAZY YERPERS!! \r\n\r\nThanks to Hen A. who acted as our Korean ambassador of Yelp. He ordered us a plentiful amount of Korean beer, soju (and Hen even brought Calipco flavored drinks to mix in - GON-BEH!), a variety of meats for us to grill, and too many side dishes to fit on our tables. \r\n\r\nThe spicy tofu (soon du bu ji gae) was brought out to each table in a piping hot clay pot and that was delicious. The chapjae noodles, which is typically complimentary with your meal, was ok - a bit soggier than usual. The meats were just so much fun to grill... food always seems to taste better when you're in charge of cooking it.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you should accidentally turn off your flame, try not to relight it yourself - ask them to do it! Although one of our guys took the liberty of lighting it himself with his lighter, we all moved 5 feet away for fear of an explosion... you'd guess that we'd all run OUT of the room! It was all good though, but our flame got really high without us realizing it and I guess our grill got really nasty really quick... didn't know this until Hen came over to point it out!

Came here from out of town with my gf to visit SF and decided this place because I wanted to grill the meat. Ordered two plates of meat as mentioned in order to grill...but the waitress came out with our meat fully cooked. \n\nApparently there was a misunderstanding or something, because I wanted to grill. If I knew that I was not able to grill the meat, I would've ordered something a little cheaper from the menu. \n\nThe portion was too small to be $20 a plate, considering I ordered 2 plates and not being able to grill. In my hometown, I can get a buffet of Korean BBQ meat for $20/person. However, being the nice person that I am, I just brushed it off thinking that they were too tired to deal with the grill for me and my gf. \n\nLastly, the customer service wasn't that bad, but wasn't great either. The waitress could've been a little more friendlier. I gave it a 2 star because the marinated beef and chicken were delicious. Moral of the story?

No matter what you order you get tea, a sweet rice dessert drink and a generous array of banchan.  So generous that I can't remember all the different types so I won't even try to review them.  We only ordered two dishes so it may not be representative, but both had flaws that kept me from rating this any higher than just ok.\n\nYuk Hwe: I wanted so much to like this dish because I'm a huge fan of French steak tartare.  The presentation took me off guard: udon shaped beef logs instead of finely chopped cubes.  There was still the familiar raw eggs to mix into the already seasoned beef which had tastes of soy and sesame.  Asian pear slices took the place of bread crostinis to offer a crisp, fresh contrast to the raw meat.  Now where it fails: the beef was partially frozen!!!  Tartare is best at room temperature, but for health concerns, I can understand if it's fresh out of the refrigerator.  However, I didn't sign up for beefsicles!  The thinner pieces that had thawed were of decent quality, but chewing into crunchy half-frozen beef in the rest of the dish was so unappetizing!\n\nDolsot Bibimbap: Crispy rice that is way better than \"snap crackle pop\"!  The standard vegetables are in the mix.  A bottle of hot sauce is given to the table to spice to taste which seems like a blessing to spice lovers, but is really a curse.  The whiniest mild palated person at the table will inevitably complain and prevent you from spewing half a bottle... in which case you would have been better off to have the kitchen make it normal Korean spicy to burn that complainer!  The beef was not that great, it was too thick and well done.  I prefer when the beef is raw or partially raw so it cooks alone with the rice.", "author": "Adam B."}

My sister was wanting to find a good Korean restaurant and this is the only one mentioned in the Food Lovers Guide.  So we went here for her birthday dinner.\n\nAll the food was delicious!  Dinner comes with loads of kim chi dishes.  I would estimate like 10 different ones.  The best are the miniature pancake like things.  You can easily fill up on this alone.  Bearing this in mind, the waitress tried to tell us that the bbq was 1 person portions.  For $20 I thought it was a bit steep.  But don't worry, 1 order of bbq easily feeds 2 people.  Unfortunately for us, we believed the waitress and ordered another dish as well.  So we felt compelled to roll out of there - couldn't exactly not eat the other dish, could we?\n\nThe only nitpicky thing about the bbq was that it didn't come with the lettuce and stuff to wrap it in.  The meat did come out with lettuce on the same plate but given it was sharing space with raw meat I looked upon it as decoration rather than food to eat.\n\nThe other dish I ordered was the tofu chi gae (sp).  Basically slightly spicy tofu soup with some shrimp and oysters.  This was really really good and welcome departure from the usual bbq and bibimbap.  You take the soup and soup some over the rice (in a separate bowl) and eat it with chopsticks.  You could drink it like regular soup but I've never seen it done that way by any Koreans.\n\nI didn't have any bibimbap but other people at the table did.  Looked good and I liked the sizzling stone tureen you can get it in.\n\nThe only bad thing was that even though it was half empty it was still difficult to wave down waitresses for water.\n\nBike Parking: no designated bike racks.  I locked up to a lamp post in Jtown plaza.", "author": "Jean K."}

The little appetizer thingys they bring out in the beginning were all really good - the fishcake, the potatoes, kimchee...yum.  The meats were also delicious, and it was presented in a little \"raw meat roll\" that we unraveled to cook (unfortunately, we had to cut it ourselves...but the presentation was nice!).  The kim chee chi gae was just okay - not as pungent and flavorful as others I've had.  \n\nWhile Korean restaurants are typically known for their high-touch service, it was hard for us to get anything - lettuce for our meat, water, rice, etc.  There weren't many patrons at the restaurant so the inattentiveness was puzzling.

The flavor is not strong or tasty, just plain. Don't order the bulgogi. It's not worth it, even though the amount of meat you get is decent.\n\nSoggy service --\nFirst the service is okay, we went mid-afternoon on a Saturday. This happened to be the same day as the Asian Heritage Festival in Japantown. Although, we ended up seating ourselves since it was so quiet and no one came around to seat us. We didn't get water or tea refills. We waited a while get the check since none of the staff were even walking around checking on tables. It wasn't crowded, only about 3-4 other tables of two around.\n\nLocation --\nThis place is upstairs, I didn't see any windows, not sure if there is an elevator, pretty big and you can grill your own, if you want to.

Otherwise food safety is out the window. \n\nThe Korean bacon was different but pretty good. The Kal Bi was very good. (They even cooked the bone part in the kitchen for us.) And the soup? Uh, no thanks. Our table, our peeeps, we like to fill up on rice not soup. Thank you very much. \n\nSo what if they looked at us funny when we all asked for another chawan of rice.

I told Connie that this is the last time they will let Yelp in ... no holiday parties.\n\nThe food is standard bbq, and each table got platters of chicken, beef, and pork maybe?  You grill it yourself ... but be careful not to turn it off.  SOMEONE did at our table, and we were wondering why the food was not cooking.  Maybe the grill is cold because it's .... HAUNTED???   No, it was not haunted, but it was turned off in an attempt to turn it up.  (Sorry!  but I forgot your name.  I will not remember your name, but will know your face if we cross paths again!)  \n\nAlso with the meal ... I have to give a big thanks to Hen for ordering for us.  You get lots of picked veggies like red kimchee, which could have been spicier, cucumbers, jicama, and lots of other side dishes served family style.  There was some spicy tofu soup that was pretty good too, and comes to the table in a contraption that keeps the soup boiling hot.  Also on the menu was a \"pad Thai\", ala Korean style.  That was really good.\n\nBTW ... what was the name of that noodle dish??  I want to order it again, but my deaf ears could not pick up exactly what it was.\n\nOH ... the sogu!  Great stuff!  How is it flavored??  I think Hen was in charge of this too.  People said I had a lot of sogu, but I didn't feel anything.  \n\nIt's a great place to go in Japantown, but be sure to wear something that you won't mind smelling like BBQ.

It was quite empty for a weekend, and our server was very quiet and didn't say much to us. We ordered and was basically left on our own for the most of the evening.\n\nThe seafood pancake (don't remember the name) was good and came in a very large portion. 3 of us couldn't finish it!  All the bbq meats were also good, and I enjoyed it the best. We can cook as we eat and took our own time.\n\nWe also ordered a blue crab soup thing (don't know the name) and it was the spiciest soup I have ever had in my entire life!!!! Wwhooooo!!! All our mouths were on fire!!! It was ridiculously spicy, I couldn't handle it.

The waitress didn't speak English very well, but she was also very polite. My friend and I are both servers, so we were impressed with the service compared to most other Korean restaurants.\n\nThe selection of food looked pretty awesome. At first, it seemed pricey, but we were hungry. I got the cow's tongue and my friend got the kalbi. We were also impressed that the menu had Japanese translations as well, but some of the words were wrong, haha.\n\nThe side dishes were really good! I've had the Korean side dishes at many different places and I like how each has their own taste, but I especially liked it here. Kinda small, but not a big deal, just get another one. The spicy side dishes weren't very spicy though.\n\nThe portions were a lot bigger than we thought! Woo, it was fun grilling at the table. The cow's tongue was kinda hard and difficult to chew, but still tasty. The kalbi was also really good, but since they were thick cuts, it was a challenge to get the insides cooked. We both got a second bowl of rice because there was so much meat!\n\nOverall, a really awesome restaurant.

My friend and I weren't particularly ravenous, so we went for the seafood sundobu, 1 order of Kalbi, and some chap chae (yes, I've been practicing my korean, can't you tell?) Since we only ordered 1 order of barbecue, the kitchen prepared it for us (thereby sparing us of said body-permeating food smell). The meat was juicy and tender, the chap chae was as expected, and the sundobu, predictably, burned a hole in my mouth with the right amount of spicyness.\n\nMy biggest gripe is the slow service. There were only 2 staff members at around 8:30 which was when we had asked for the check.  I'm sure it was  quiet night (although a large party checked in not long after), but it took forever to flag down someone to take our credit card, and then forever to get the card back.

It seemed we didn't have to worry since they had plenty of large, round tables that could seat big groups. We ordered bul go gi, daegi bul go gi, kal bi, and mushrooms to grill. We also got the add on that comes with the lettuce and rice, and we also ordered the seafood egg pancake/omelet, bi bim bap, mandu, and steak tartare. \n\nEverything was so tasty! The food came out super quickly, the meats were all well marinated and fun to cook, the bi bim bap wasn't drowning in sesame oil like other places, the mandu tasted homemade to someone, and all the little side dishes were great (bean sprouts, fish cake, tofu, kimchee, etc). \n\nDefinitely a great place for large or small party.

As is the case for Chinese food (no, San Franciscans, R&G Lounge is mediocre if you've ever eaten in the southland pockets for c-food ), if you want good Korean food, it's in L.A.  I was born and  raised in L.A. and enjoyed fabulous Chinese, Thai, and Korean food for half my life as I suffered the smog, pretentiousness, traffic and sprawl that comes with living there.  But I always had KoreaTown and my bi bim bap.  Seriously, there is no Korean and Chinese food here in the city.  New Korea House suffices for some Korean food when the cravings overtake me but I have to blank out all memories of my nights of bi him bap runs in L.A. while I'm eating it here.  Or else I am a sad, grouchy bitch as I sit with my head sunken in disappointment while snarfing NKH.  It's not a knock on NKH; I haven't found any better yet.  I'm still searching and open to suggestions.  I've taken lately to asking random local Koreans I meet if they can make good bibimbap and if so, whether I can pay to have some if they make it. Yeah, I'm a pathetically desperate gal. So my review of NKH is basically favorable if you haven't ruined yourself already with the mental imprint of what good Korean food tastes like.  That sounds facetious but it is not meant to be.  Helpful review it's likely not but that 6 hour drive doesn't sound that bad right now for a weekend soon.", "author": "Liz K."}

It's clean.  There's a grill on every table.  The service is very efficient, it took a whole 2 minutes after we put in the order for all the 50 dishes of panchan (side dishses with all the yummy goodies like cucumber kimchi, cabbage kimchi, radish kimchi, bean sprouts, potatoes, spinach, gelatin, etc...) to come out then 2 minutes later they brought out the BBQ meat then 2 minutes after that they brought out the other dishes we ordered.  They are very very efficient here.  They also hooked us with a free dish.  If you didn't know this about Korean restaurants is that hooking customers up with a free dish is a customary thing.  Or maybe I pulled the Korean hook up by attempting to order in my broken somewhat decent Korean.  \n\nBut anyways, the food was great.  The service was great.

The standout dishes to me was the jap chae and grilled chicken. There was nothing really special about the chicken, it was just cooked well. The jap chae was warm and flavorful but not worth 15 dollars, especially for the small plate.

Thankfully, my craving for spicy tofu stew was satisfied by a quick $10 cab ride to Japantown and NKH.\n\nMy first reaction was one of alarm: given the high ratings that I'd seen for NKH on Yelp, I was slightly concerned that there was only one other table filled in the whole restaurants. Maybe Tuesday is meatloaf night at home for all of San Francisco. No matter. My craving beckons.\n\nThe service was swift (and it better be, with only other table!), and the banchan arrived before me in minutes. I proceeded to dip everything in the delicious and glowing-red hot sauce of the pickled cucumbers. I was less impressed with the seafood tofu stew itself, which bubbled for a full 2 minutes after being brought hot to the table. However, the stew tasted quite bland to me, and the promise of seafood was realized by only 1 tail-on shrimp, 2 oysters, and assorted bits and pieces of shrimp-like protein in the cast iron pot. All in all, it was something of a let-down.\n\nThe tab for the stew and a coke came to $20, which seems a bit excessive given some of the other Korean restaurants I've visited in the East Bay.

Quick steps up the stairs. Brief pause as we waited to be seated. Menus opened just for the sake of it... we three already knew why we were here. \n\nI had been there two other times: once in high school, I took my foreign exchange student friends there (won't go into the mischief we caused that night!) and the last time with a date who hadn't tried Korean food previously. Wasn't that impressed so I continued to go to my usual, Han Il Kwan. But tonight was different.\n\nWe came to Korea House for their samgyeupsal, only discovering they served it once I read Miriam W.'s review. Lot of pressure since my two accomplices depended on me for the Korean hook-up. We were not disappointed. \n\nThe deets: 2 orders only (cannot order just one). Cook at your own table (can control how crispy you want it... ya ya, it's a gas grill, suck it up). Be careful of cross contamination (they'll give you metal tongs to place on the grill, but once you're ready to eat, use your chopsticks to plate). Served with a sweet dipping sauce. I ate it dipped in the sauce and then wrapped in a lettuce leaf with a bit of kimchi or hot paste).\n\nBanchan:\nAll the little sides were great except for the gak du gi (spicy pickled radish... overripe which made it mushy). Kim chi was perfect. A few sides were different from the usual array one gets at a Korean restaurant: slightly sweet soy radish, soy sauce potatoes, green leaf lettuce salad with slightly spicy vinegar-sesame dressing).\n\nCustomer service was excellent (though I will mention there were only two other tables when we first walked in):\nWe originally tried to order one samgyeupsal, one ojingo bokum (spicy sauteed calamari), and one kimchi chi gae (spicy kimchi stew/soup) but once we found out we had to order two samgyeupsals to get it, we decided to pass on the calamari. The lady took our order and went back to the kitchen. After a few seconds, she came back and said she'd throw in the kimchi chi gae for free if we still wanted the calamari... of course, we took her offer.  Much better than the fried fish we'd get for free from Han Il Kwan. And when we asked for refills on the sides, we got them no problem and with a smile. Only gripe was every other table got green peppers (not too spicy) to eat with the hot chili paste and we didn't get any! Guess I could have asked but only realized this once we were almost done. Also, helps if you speak Korean, but not necessary.\n\nPrice: \nThink we each put in $22  for dinner and tip. I think it's a great value and could have probably fed a 4th person with the amount of food we had left over (all the samgyeupsal was gone, though).\n\nMeal ended with cantaloupe slices, rather than the sickly sweet shik-kai (my friend loves to call it \"dirty rice water\"). \n\nWill definitely go back to try their nang myon (cold noodle in a vinegary broth... perfect for hot summer days) and dol sot bi bim bap (hot stone bowl bi bim bap).", "author": "B W."}

That is the justification to call this tofu dish seafood!  The clames tasted from frozen. I am paying $12.95 for this dish and I expect more sea food in this if you call it seafood item.  The quantity was larger than a small bowl.  There was no egg offered for this dish like most Korean restaurants would offer.  Either the chef was too stingy for one egg or the chef decides that I did not need it since I did not ask for one lousy egg.   Yes you get small dishes with this order.  But the dishes were not plain and cheaf and not very tasty.  two daikon (white radish) dishes: one sweet and vinegar daikon, one kimchi daikon.  We did not see any seaweeds, fried croakers, potatoes and etc.", "author": "Way L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-12-09", "description": "Thank you, Yelpers, for another great recommendation! I've always gone to Brother's but thought I'd check Yelp to see if there was a better place. I've grown tired of the poor quality meat, rude service, and overwhelming smoke at Brother's so I decided to give Korea House a try after reading the Yelp reviews and hearing that it's the favorite place of a Korean friend. They have a rather odd location in Japantown, which probably accounts for the fact that I had no problem getting a table without reservations at 6:30pm on a Saturday night. I ordered the Kal Bi BBQ. The meat was of fair quality (that's why only 4 stars), a few pieces were not edible due to being like rubber, but most of them were tasty and tender. The bone parts were undercooked and the meat near the bone was raw so I couldn't enjoy the flavor of crispy meat on bone. Note, I was eating solo, so the BBQ was prepared for me in the kitchen rather than self-cooked at the table. Why do they get 4 stars, you may be wondering? The service was friendly and efficient and the kim chi was the best I have ever had in my life!!! I'd go back again just for the kim chi. I was given the usual set of 10 or so kim chi dishes and they had the most incredible mouth-feel ... a bubbling euphoric feeling that came from the active fermentation of the bacteria in the kim chi. They were really alive, fresh, incredibly flavorful. I've tried a lot of Korean food over the years and this kim chi beats anything I've ever had, even in Korea.", "author": "Eater S."}

Not being Korean I wouldn't know how authentic Korean food would taste like, but it seems like it would definitely be close to it. I don't like spicy food, so I chose to have rib eye, kalbi, bul gol gi, marinated chicken barbeque dishes, which were fantastic and great to share. I love trying out the side dishes (the potato one is great, I asked for more, and they brought back lots of it). It's great to have lunch with friends in here, it's never busy when we're in here which is great! They served us complimentary pancakes (which I thought we were special, but it turns out everyone gets them, but they're super good). Soup is good, rice is cooked perfectly! When I'm craving Korean food, I always stop by! Prices are reasonable!", "author": "Lily L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-04-22", "description": "In terms of decor and ambience, the New Korea House has a modest charm. Where the taste and quality of the food is concerned, however, New Korea House leaves much to be desired.  The kalbi and jigae dishes at New Korea House impart a taste that I associate with mass-produced food. The flavor is passable but far from distinctive.  \n\nYou can discern a great deal about a Korean restaurant by the variety and quality of its side dishes. On the plus side, NHK offers a variety of side dishes. Unfortunately, this abundance does not make up for their rather lackluster quality. The care taken in preparing dishes is invariably reflected in taste, and the NHK side dishes conform to this view. I would cite the fact that NHK serves its bean sprouts with the roots attached as one example. Since the norm in Korean cuisine is to detach the roots of each individual sprout, I was a bit turned off by, since neglecting to detach the root is considered somewhat unsanitary, since the roots were entrenched in the dirt when harvested. I was also less than impressed with the fact that some of NKH's other side dishes tasted less than fresh. In particular, the bindae-duk was hard and brittle, rather than soft, which indicated to me that it had perhaps been made on a previous day, rather than made and served fresh on that occasion.\n\nThere are certain culinary niceties that derive from being Korean and eating Korean food throughout one's life, so I suspect that the niceties that I've mentioned will go unnoticed by most non-Korean diners.  NKH is a notch above Brothers, since NKH's food is less greasy, but the overall difference in quality between NKH and Brothers is slight and thus doesn't support the disparity in price, since eating at NKH is twice as expensive as dining at Brothers.\n\nNKH and Brothers are both decent, but both places pale in comparison to the quality, taste, and authenticity of the food at Seoul Garden. SG is a more pricey than NKH, but the dishes at SG reflect a meticulous attention to detail that is undeniably reflected in the taste and flavor of the entrees. In fast-food terms, I would posit Brothers as analogous to Jack In the Box, NKH as akin to Burger King, and Seoul Garden as tantamount to a delectable, albeit more pricey hamburger that one might be served at a posh hotel or resort. In retail terms, Brothers is the equivalent of Gap, as NKH is to JCrew, and Seoul Garden would be to Bloomingdales.", "author": "John O."}
