They were raving about this place literally for weeks or months before they took me here for my birthday and admittedly I was skeptical \"yeah yeah it sounds great\" because usually when someone hypes something up too much whether it's a movie or a dining experience, it's almost always something of a letdown. \n\nBut not The Richmond though, they do not disappoint! I honestly can't think of anything I have been more impressed with in a very long time. Every single item on the menu that I tried was superb and five star caliber. The chef and owner who is very friendly and personable spends a lot of time at each table and makes you feel special; almost as if your table is the only one and your group are the only guests in the restaurant while there are other tables separated by curtains he is also attending to with personal care and attentiveness.  \n\nWhen my then 7 year old niece Lauren craved Apple Cider, he informed us that unfortunately they did not have apple cider, but get this! he sent one of his employees out to the store to buy a chilled bottle of Martinelli's sparking cider just for her. Now that is wonderful service! \n\nI rarely go into detail about the actual meal when writing about a restaurant on Yelp but I can vividly remember everything I had even though this was my birthday back on August 10th. First thing they served was warm sliced baguette with three different types of soft butter, one was regular butter, another one was Olive butter and the third was butter with herbs and chives, all three and the warm baguette pieces were delicious. they then brought a bowl of butternut squash soup, so good and so much better than that French onion soup they serve you at a lot of other places. The next thing was a huge scallop over braised sirloin and polenta; everything about that was done to perfection and I really wanted another one after finishing the first. seriously the tastiest scallop I ever had. \n\nMy duck with potatoes and vegetables was the best I ever ate! Even my dad who thinks that only Germans know how to make duck and goose right said his duck was excellent. I ordered the Peach Crisp which was seasonal and replaced the usual apple crisp but they surprised me with an 'on the house' complimentary birthday dessert before my peach crisp with vanilla ice cream even arrived. They brought me a panna- cotta .. (not sure why it's auto correcting \"panna cotta\" No I did not have Panda cotta! I gave up panda years ago), Seriously though, I never eat things like Veal or Foie gras or even caged eggs, but the food here is so good that I might have tried one of those if someone were offering me a sampling. I did try small potions of what others were having and everything here is delicious!  \n\nIf the food wasn't amazing enough, what has everyones mind blown is the more than reasonable price! Compared to a comparable place like Chapeau on Clement street which we have frequented for many many years; and the food here is far superior in my opinion, the bill is somewhere between 25-30% less expensive. Just incredible! For a party of six, (including my niece who had her own adult meal), appetizers, entrees, desserts, bread, several glasses of wine, beer etc was around $300 before gratuity. My friend Bryan who has also tried The Richmond based on the recommendation from my brother said \"Wow! that's the first time in my entire life that I have ever been sticker shocked in the opposite way\" Just an amazing value.\n\nIf I can find anything to complain about, it's very difficult to find a parking space around here and no valet parking service to my knowledge. The waitress took unusually long intervals of time before noticing us when needing something from her and it was difficult to flag her down but if that's the only complaint I can even think of, this restaurant still deserves all five stars and more.", "author": "David A."}

Chef owner, John, gives each guest personal attention and makes the fabulous food even more special with his warmth and kindness.\nThe pace is slow...you can relax here and enjoy yourself. It's a small, intimate space cleverly separated by curtains to reduce ambient noise. We had the 3 course tasting menu and were there for about 2.5 hours. When John learned that we like to share from each other's plates, he made a point to split one of the appetizers and one of the desserts for us.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-01-08", "description": "Very unassuming but food and service was good and love the intimate atmosphere!  We came here Thursday (12/7/17) for a date night at 8pm.\n\nVenue: very unassuming from the outside and slightly dark.  However, what is rather unique is that most of the seats are surrounded by curtains, providing a very intimate setting, especially if you are on a date.  The curtains are great because not only do they make your table feel more private, but they also absorb some of the sound so you don't hear too much of other tables' conversations.  It can at times feel like it can be a bit crowded in the areas between tables / curtains.  \n\nService: even with the curtains making you feel like you might be missed by the staff, the service was pretty good.  They came into your little booth often enough to check in and see if you need anything / take plates away.  Was worried you'd be forgotten, but that wasn't the case here!\n\nFood: they offer a three course tasting menu, choosing an appetizer, entree and dessert, all for $37.50 per person; each course offers 3-5 choices.\n-- Crab Cake + Summer Squash Salad (squash, pine nuts, piave, watercress & herb vinaigrette) - crab was greatly seasoned, and the outside was nice and crispy.  Lot of chunks of crab so you know its crab and not too heavy!  The squash salad was also a good counterpoint with its lightness and acidity.  \n\n-- Bone-In Pork Chop with Mashed Potatoes (seasonal vegetables) - I don't eat a lot of pork, but decided to give this a try.  The pork chop was seasoned simply, but the deep, rich sauce made up for that.  Pork chop itself was cooked well- not too dry and still moist inside.  String beans were slightly overcooked but otherwise liked this dish.\n\n-- Apple Crisp (roasted apples, streusel & vanilla ice cream) - The streusel added great texture to the softened, slightly acidic apples and smooth ice cream.  The streusel was also not too sweet, so you didn't feel like you will get too much of a cavity.  \n\nMy date similarly loved two of his dishes (braised short rib + scallop and braised duck), but we both admit that the panna cotta dessert he ordered was just WAY too sweet.  \n\nAll in all, this is a perfect date spot / dinner place if you want a bit of privacy.  Food was overall decent (minus a few bad choices) and service was good.  A bit far out for me to want to go to frequently, but worth a visit at least once.", "author": "Audrey H."}

The five courses looked delicious but I'm glad I picked three because again I was so stuffed! \n\nThe only thing that bugged me was that they had lighting up where all the bulbs were out except for one.. perhaps just take it down if only one bulb is working.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-06-23", "description": "We were walking around the neighborhood and noticed this attractive little restaurant. We were taking a look at the menu when the owner took notice and waved & smiled. Little did he know, we already had reservations for later that evening. When we returned, we were once again greeted with a warm welcome. As we entered through the front door, there was a small bar that seats about 4 or so people. We were then led past a set of red velvet curtains into the dining area, where an accent wall was decorated with wood panels from wine crates. Very nice touch.  \n\nOur server, who I presume is the owner, first brought out an amuse bouche of puff pastry w/ ham & cheese. It was simple, simply tasty. The golden brown layers puffed up nicely and formed into 2 miniature cheese sandwiches.\n\nThe wine list was surprisingly lengthy for a small family-run restaurant. Most of the glasses were under $10, so you can actually enjoy a drink or two, while staying within budget. The owner discussed several of his favorite wines, so I told him to go ahead and surprise me, to which he replied, \"I have something you will love.\" No more than a couple minutes passed when he returned and apologized for keeping us waiting. I was confused ... what wait? Of course we said \"No worries.\" To make up for the 'wait,' he said he would take the wine off of our bill. That was totally unnecessary and very generous of him, but hey, I'm not one to argue!\n\nNext we received a fresh loaf of warm bread w/ parsley & chive butter, salted butter, & olive butter. Everything was delightful and we hadn't spent a dime yet.\n\n$10.95 Crab Cake w/ spinach salad:\nThis crab cake was warm and moist inside with a crunchy, thin exterior. Most crab cakes don't do it for me, because I don't love shredded crab, but this one was pretty good. I could have eaten another one. Maybe it was because it was served hot and fresh. The spinach salad on the side consisted of simply a few spinach leaves with a creamy dressing. \n\n$10.95 Whisky Braised Oxtail & Maine Diver Scallop on creamy polenta:\nThe oxtail was delicious and juicy. The thick scallop sat on top like a medallion with a nice char on the outside. The polenta was indeed creamy and did not have any gritty texture, partially because it was sitting in the braising liquid. I could have had two orders of this and it would have been an excellent meal.\n\n$20.95 Braised Duck Leg in Port Wine Sauce w/ mashed potatoes & vegetables:\nThe juicy and savory duck meat nearly came off the bone. The mashed potatoes, zucchini and carrots were nice accompaniments and went well with the braising liquid, too.\n\nMr. Joy ordered a steak, medium-rare, which was served over a bed of arugula. It was also very nice and juicy. The steak juices balanced out the bitter greens very well. \n\n$6 Coffee Semifreddo w/ coffee ice cream, coffee granite, almond brittle:\nAnother simple, but very good dish. I always enjoy coffee ice cream. The coffee granite helped to lighten up the richness. The almond brittle was crushed over the top, which made it very easy to eat.\n\nOverall, the food was just delicious without being pretentious, like you'd expect grandma's home-cooking to taste. That is, if your grandma cooks traditional meat & potato dishes with somewhat of a European flair. Combine that with the home-y ambience, and it really does feel like your favorite neighbors invited you over for a nice dinner. The Richmond emulates the idea of a 'neighborhood gem,' because it's not easy finding braised duck leg or hanger steak in the Richmond district that is done so well, and it's nearly impossible to find upscale dishes at such affordable prices these days. Most of all, the service was just so nice that it left us in good spirits.", "author": "Joy W."}

I didn't ask many questions about the food but I'm sure he's very knowledgeable about the ingredients and sources. \n\nThe pre-appetizer was a delcious potato soup that came with warm bread (surprisingly hard to find nowadays) and 3 types of really interesting but good butter.

I don't remember the per person cost pre-tax, but I'm assuming in the low $60ish range. They do have a menu posted online with prices, but it's a little out of date. Either way, it's still a good price for a 5 course tasting menu, especially given the portion size. I've had tasting menus where the portion size was miniscule, like a sliver of meat the size of my thumb tiny, and that is definitely not what you're going to get here. Each dish could pass as a full size meal at another restaurant. On top of that we were given not just one, but two amuse bouches, making this a 7 course meal.  If you're looking for good value, then The Richmond should be on your list of stops. They also have a three course prix fixe and a la carte options if you don't want to go all out on the 5 course. \n\nDecor:\nI rarely give much thought to decor, but this restaurant had an interesting set up. Each table was surrounded by curtains, which essentially turned each table into its own semi-private dining room. It's pretty effective at making a meal feel more intimate. One of the other striking things about the set up is the space between tables. I've dined at my fair share of San Francisco restaurants that have packed as many customers in as possible. I've grown accustomed to the idea that bumping elbows with the table to me is a normal part of SF dining. I was pleasantly surprised by how much space there was here between tables. \n\nFood: \nFood here was excellent. I knew we were off to a good start when we were brought bread with three types of butter. Our amuse bouches consisted of a salad and a soup. The 5 course tasting menu included a roasted beets salad topped with goat cheese wrapped in phyllo dough, foie gras on brioche, a salmon dish, shortrib and scallops, and a coffee semifreddo. Everything was well executed and delicious. \n\nI rarely repeat restaurants. There are just too many good options in San Francisco to explore, but I would be willing to give The Richmond a second go.

We all very much enjoyed the three course dinner, and everything (literally EVERYTHING) we had was absolutely delicious.\n\nThe highlights for our group included the crab cake, the scallop and short rib, the roast pork (this dish was my favorite of the night, and in my opinion blows NOPA's pork chop out of the water), and the peach crisp and chocolate/peanut butter torte desserts.\n\nMy girlfriend proclaimed The Richmond her favorite restaurant in the city, and we will definitely be returning soon.", "author": "Justin H."}

Maybe it would be amazing food or location. Perhaps some other esoteric ego stroking event....maybe they have an algorithm for that? \n\nFor me it has to be a combination of quality of food, service, ambiance, and of course wine list.\n\nThe Richmond has been a steadfast bastion in the culinary darkness that is Balboa Street (Lord I haven't eaten here since my pre-yelp days). I believe one yelper called it the street where restaurants go to die.\n\nThe Richmond is an unassuming looking restaurant from the outside: One could easily drive by without even giving it a notice. However, where can you find a three course meal for $36 dollars ( okay try and get a table at Trestle...pshaah). Let me clarify that: Where can you get a three course meal for 36 dollars, that is mostly locally sourced, served by the warm and friendly owner, that is generously portioned, delicious, in a warm cozy environment??? In San Francisco not many....many places have entrees in the 30 dollar range.\n\nPrice is one thing...but the food is really good:\n\nMy Crab Cake with Spinach Salad was a lovely large crab cake with mostly crab...light on the breading. Light and crispy with a wonderful crab flavor...the spinach with bacon salad complimented the softer texture of the crab.\n\nMy entree Bone-in Pork Roast with a Honey-Mustard Glaze with mashed potatoes & seasonal vegetables was insanely good ( A very generous pork chop). The meat was tender, succulent, and really flavorful. I assume leaving the bone in adds to this tenderness. The mashed potatoes were lightly whipped...not heavy on butter nor cream...and dam tasty. All of the veggies were Al dente.....and a pleasure to eat as well as a compliment to the chop.\n\nPerhaps the least impressive part of the meal was my dessert: A Warm Chocolate & Peanut Butter Torte ...more a chocolate lava cake than Torte. The dessert tasted very pre-made and just lacked that je ne sais quoi. It was okay but lacked flavor and texture.\n\nI must also add that both of my dinning partners are pain in the ass eaters....and they loved every single course that they partook of.\n\nThrow in a wine list with a great range of nice wines....from 30 dollar bottles to 500 buck cult wines.....John will help you choose as he is very proud of the collection.\n\nSo back to my original question: what makes a 5 Star Yelp restaurant? A place like the Richmond restaurant that serves you an amazing meal, served with heart and soul, in a warm and comfortable environment, at a very very reasonable price!", "author": "David G."}

Layout of the restaurant is quite interesting as well with the table and seating sectioned off via curtains giving each table a private booth like experience. \n\nThe best part however was our general experience with both the service and the food. When I placed my reservation I had explained that I had food allergies (seafood/shellfish), but still wanted to proceed with the 5 course tasting menu, which did include salmon and scallops. Upon arrival, John Ha, the head chef/owner greeted us at our table personally and explained to me that he have made a custom modification to my part of the menu to accommodate me and my needs. He was very pleasant to talk to and was extremely respectful. In fact, throughout the night we saw him entering and exiting the kitchen greeting all of his other guests in the same manner we were received. \n\nThe food? Very contemporary and very very delicious. There was a balance to every dish and everything was simply perfect. In fact, we were presented with more than the 5 course meal we had expected. The chef had given us some complimentaries with our meals including the Beets and carrots salad and the butternut squash soup. Talk about going above and beyond and exceeding our expectations. Tony and his niece who was the waitress, was very attentive and did their best to provide us the best possible experience.

I've had this restaurant bookmarked for about a year.  You can totally miss The Richmond when you drive by Balboa as it's around a laundromat and residences.  I made reservations well enough in advance for the Richmond via phone for our Valentine's Day dinner at 6pm.  This is a family run business, with the chef/owner coming out to take your order and his niece helping out as hostess/waitress.  \n\nWe were the second couple to arrive, but within our stay they started to fill it up but pacing appropriately.  The restaurant is also a little bigger than it seems on the outside.  I love the curtains and wine displays; it's quite charming.  They had a lot of pre frix menu options, and let you customize it as well upon asking.  So, we both did the three course and for $10 more he added on the foie gras for his appetizer.  For his main he had the beef and the coffee semifreddo for dessert.  For my dinner I went with the braised shortrib with seared scallop, duck leg and the apple crisp.  He had a red and I also had a glass of Riesling.  \n\nEverything was paced very well and for our amuse bouche a ham and cheese puff pastry was served.  It was nice and flaky and the perfect thing to get our appetite going.  The bread was fresh and crusty.  Loved the butters it was served with - traditional with sea salt, olive, and chive.  The foie gras was magical!  He said it was probably his favorite foie gras dish that he's had.  It was seared and served on pain perdu with diced apples.  The sweet, savory, salty combinations were amazing!  The shortrib and scallop appetizer was a huge portion of tender beef and that scallop melted like butter.  The duck leg easily came off the bone and was served in a delicious wine sauce with buttery mashed potatoes and fresh veggies.  He loved his hunk of beef as well.\n\nWe forced ourselves to finish our entrees and lastly dessert came around.  The apple crisp was not overly sweet, as the tart flavors from the apple married well with the sweet crisp and cold vanilla ice cream.  His semi freddo had great texture from the coffee granite.  I also tasted some alcohol in it as well.  \n\nThe Richmond is a wonderful restaurant serving food you would expect at a fine dining establishment at more affordable prices.  Our whole meal pre-tip was around $100.  We can't wait to come back to try their other dishes..and for more foie gras.  Get there early to try to find parking in this hard area!  It took us about 10 minutes of circling around and getting lucky.  I would give it a 4.5 rounded up.", "author": "Cat C."}

I'd walked by it hundreds of times and always thought, \"That place looks fancy, better find a special occasion so I can go there!\" And I did! \n\nService:\nMy boyfriend and I stopped by (without a reservation) on a Thursday evening. We were met with a bit of apprehension since the wait staff is only the owner and his wife, but they let us sit and I can tell you it was maybe the best service I've received in the city in terms of timing and personal touch, and I've dined at some pretty amazing places (Boulevard, Perbacco, Absinthe, Kokkari, North Beach Restaurant, RN74, Chapeau and more) thanks to a job in advertising. That should speak volumes for how attentive this husband and wife duo were, especially knowing they were pretty full that night. I feel the need to applaud the service even more because as a young couple my boyfriend and I have certainly experienced age-ism from wait staff at other establishments--that was not the case here at all and has certainly put The Richmond on our list of Romantic Meals in the city.\n\nFood:\nWe were treated to a delicious soup and bread spread with three tasting sauces on the house, very generous wine pours, and DELICIOUS entrees. Honestly, every bite and sip was exquisite. We ordered the prix fixe three-course menu. I had the beet salad, duck, and apple crisp, and my honey had the beet salad, pork roast, and chocolate peanut butter cake. The duck was divine--the meat fell off the bone, perfectly moist. \n\nAtmosphere:\nOh my goodness the atmosphere in this place is SO intimate and romantic. Each table is sectioned off with floor to ceiling velvet fabric, and the walls are covered in best-in-class wooden wine boxes, and a couple large multi-media landscape paintings (think: real branches that protrude from the canvas). It was quiet so you can hear your date and have a lovely conversation, with light music in the background and those velvet curtains to keep out outside conversation. They do have tables that seat about 6-8 as well if you are thinking of having a low-key  celebration with friends. It's 100% indoor seating, which is fine since the neighborhood is usually chilly.\n\nPrice:\nAt ~$35 for an exquisite three-course meal (excluding wine), this is a GREAT value. Wine selection is impressive as well. \n\nIf you are looking for an intimate experience, delicious cuisine, fantastic value, and supporting local business, this is the place for you.", "author": "Ashley P."}

Wife and I made a reservation here for 5:30 PM on a Saturday but phoned to change it to 6 PM.  I received a call back from the owner asking if we could come earlier than 6 PM as he would be very busy cooking and serving single handedly six tables at 6 PM.  Curious, we did make it by 5:30 PM when it was just opening. We were the first customers and indeed, there were only six tables which were partially partitioned with curtains providing extra intimacy.  We were greeted by a lady who seems to be the owner's wife and were seated promptly.  The Richmond has two sets of tasting menus - a three course dinner with choice of appetizer, entree, and dessert ($40, wine pairing $35), and a fixed five course ($75, wine pairing $45).  Everyone at the same table must have either the three or five course menu. We opted for the five course because it had seared foie gras, my favorite.  We also had wine pairing. The owner came with complimentary pinot grigio which was crisp and dry and very satisfying and an amuse de bouche potato and leek soup which was delicate and delicious.  These were followed by two more appetizers and entrees which were outstandingly delicious with wonderful sauces and blends of flavors.  Particularly memorable were the shrimp fritters, seared foie gras, and oxtail/mushroom ravioli.  The dessert, coffee semifreddo was inventive and satisfying both as dessert and coffee.  Wife thought the owner/chef must have been trained in France but learned that he was \"self-taught\" and had never been in France.  Perhaps France should invite him to teach!  What makes the restaurant even more outstanding is that even when all the six tables were filled as they did toward the end of our meal, there was very little noise and the gentle background music (mostly oldies- e.g. Nat King Cole) was conducive to a satisfying dinner, as was the friendly and solicitous server couple.  It should also be noted that for the quality and esthetic presentation of each course, the price is more than reasonable, and the wine pairing is certainly a bargain!  This will be one of our favorite restaurants for a quiet, satisfying dinner.\n\n\nAttachments area", "author": "Hoyle L."}

I first brought my father here in early 2016 as a stumble-upon option with a notably quiet ambience. He's not a fan of yelling over a meal, no matter how delicious. John was able to accommodate us night-of with no fuss about lack of notice. Since that initial, exquisite experience with my dad, I've been meaning to take my foodie husband to The Richmond. This year for his birthday he mentioned the venue as an option to book in advance; his birthday fell on a Friday, which arguably can be more competitive than other weeknights. We booked it and the birthday boy agrees: this is not only a very special, delicious restaurant, it's also an intimate experience. Chef-owner John not only prepares the menu, he confirms reservations, takes tables' orders, makes spot-on wine recommendations - who knows, he might even cook & plate every last dish that gets served.

We appreciate the intimate seclusion, John, who is the head chef and owner of The Richmond!\n\nWe opted for the 3 dishes from the tasting menu with wine pairings and it was splendid!  They are surely generous with their wine pours and the taste of each one of them, surely enhances the palate.\n\nStarting out with their Amuse Bouche of the day, which consisted of chopped fruits, was a sweet and refreshing opening cleanse.  Then, olive butter and chives with parsley butter as well as regular butter, was served with their loaf of toasty and soft on the inside bread.  The chives with parsley butter, was quite captivating to continue eating on.\n\nI loved their savory appetizer with the perfectly grilled and browned scallop, creamy polenta and tender short rib!  (Must order!)  Their bacon bits, avocado meshed crab cake with spinach salad thousand island dressing that we chose as an appetizer, was all creamy rich. \n\nThe entrees time!  Boyfriend ordered the duck leg braised in port wine sauce (as if wine pairing isn't enough wine already) and I ordered the Top Sirloin Roti.  The braised duck in wine sauce, complimented well with the mixed vegetables, but I liked my Sirloin wrapped around Italian sausage better! \n\nBy the time the desserts arrived, we had plenty of wine glasses still remaining on the table - they surely do generous pours!  Their Pain Perdu and fresh berries reminded me of a strawberry shortcake, but the cake was substituted in a form of buttery toasted warm bread.  I preferred their Chocolate and Peanut Butter Torte with Vanilla Ice Cream.  It was my ideal favorite of warm fudge chocolate with ice cream!

When we arrived we saw that they didn't have the burger on the evening's menu (I'm not sure if that is a permanent thing). But the tasting menu looked so delicious we decided to stay.\n\nAnd we are so glad we did. The chef, John, came out to greet us and to introduce each course. He also brought us our wine pairings and discussed why he had picked each one.\nThe ambiance with the hanging curtains struck a great balance of fancy, comfortable, and \"mom and pop\". It was great to go to as a couple, but I think would also be great for a small business dinner as well. \n\nAnd the food and wine choices were simply delicious. The duck, scallop, and tomatoes were all very good, but the salmon with shrimp fritters was especially tasty. It's shrimp reduction was really amazing and it was hard to believe it wasn't cream based. Also, for all the food and wine we received I think the price was quite reasonable.\n\nAll in all, it's a place I do plan to return to - and bring friends :).", "author": "Dave R."}

Great value for the price and everything was so tasty especially the appetizers. For the appetizer, the short rib with scallop was so soft and delicious!!! \n\nEntree- I had the steak medallion and my friend had the duck. Get the duck. Its really good and has a lot of juicy sauce and veggies to go along with it. \n\nDessert- loved the chocolate peanut butter torte with ice cream. Also tried the panna cotta and coffee ice cream. They were good but do you want good or the best? Get the best!! \n\nAte dinner with 5 of us so instead of the wine pairing, we got 2 bottles of wine and 2 a la carte orders of foie gras (off menu) you can also choose to have that as an appetizer but we chose to share it and get our own apps. The foie gras was AMAZING! I know, it's against your morals, etc. I think as long as you don't overdo it, it's ok to indulge sometimes and to share with others! \n\nService was fantastic and we got to try a few different wines with very generous pours! Thanks The Richmond for a fantastic dinner. We really felt like VIPs and loved the value and deliciousness of our meal. I would highly recommend this place :) \n\nPs: ask for bread! great date spot.

This place deserves Michelin recognition!\n\nWe went on Wednesday night last week to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday and The Richmond made the evening so special and unforgettable. First, from an ambiance standpoint, you should know that it's very small and intimate. Each table is sectioned off with draping that prevents you from seeing (or hearing much) of other diners. I loved this, as it really makes it feel special and you can have a true conversation with who you are with.\n\nSecond, the food. AMAZING. We did the 5 course tasting menu. Each course was visually beautiful and everything was delicious. Portions are generous and Chef John also included two additional courses at no cost; I would call them amuse bouches except they were more than just a bite or two, they could definitely have stood alone as courses. It felt more like 7 or 8 courses than 5. You WILL leave full which is always nice when you are spending a good amount on dinner. I always hate when you go somewhere more upscale, pay a lot, and then leave slightly hungry - that won't happen here!\nIt's really hard for me to pick my favorite course, I loved the foie gras as well as the braised oxtail/scallop dish, but really every dish is unique and well executed. \n\nThird, the WINE. If you choose to do the wine pairing and have no self-restraint, Chef John will make you incredibly unproductive the day after your meal, because he sure is generous with his pours. Not only did all 5 courses have pairings, he also included wine with the bonus courses, and then even gave us an \"extra splash\" of our favorite towards the end of the night before the bill because he didn't \"want us to feel rushed\" (we had one of the last reservations of the night). He made us feel so welcomed (and intoxicated) with these extra touches. \n\nFinally, Chef John and his wife make a dynamic team. They are so friendly and you can tell that they truly have a passion for food and wine. Chef John was impressively knowledgeable about all of the wines he served us, and he was more than happy to indulge our curiosity about how certain dishes were prepared. \n\nBottom line of this novel of a review: This is truly a special dining experience and you should go!", "author": "Anna J."}

Every time I checked for a reservation on Opentable a few days in advance, there were never any openings. Luckily, it's easy to know what day my birthday is going to be so my wife and I made a reservation way in advance for earlier this week.\n\nWhat a treat! It's a very cute restaurant, not very big at all. It's just very quaint, and the staff there from the hostess to the bartender were all very friendly and welcoming.\n\nThe menu has some nice variety to it, but I like places that don't give you too many options, and The Richmond is exactly that, with there probably being five options for mains, five for appetizers, etc.\n\nTo start, I ordered the scallop and short rib appetizer. I'm not sure what my wife got, but it was good. But before the appetizers came, they delivered us each a small puff pastry from the chef to start the meal. Nice touch - then when they brought out some fresh bread, it came with three different butters. The presentation for everything before our main course was quite nice, and the flavor was wonderful.\n\nOur main courses were good. I had the braised duck, and my wife had the crepe dish. Both of them were really prepared with care, and i was just impressed by how nicely everything was presented.\n\nFor dessert, you HAVE to get their peanut butter chocolate torte thing. I may not have the exact name right, but picture a cross between a chocolate lava cake a peanut butter cup. With vanilla ice cream. Really good.\n\nSo not only did we find the food quality to be top notch, but the prices were also reasonable. It's not going to break the bank to have a nice dinner for two here. This is just a really great spot for two people to come to dinner. I would definitely get reservations in advance, though. The place is so small. There really were only a handful of tables.

I hung out in this neighborhood and still frequent all the shops in the Richmond, and never had an inkling that this gem was so close to my office!\n\nCelebrating my birthday last night was even more special thanks to the chef and his wife, service, ambiance, food, quantity and price!  San Franciscans have the unique advantage over other cities because our palates are pretty spoiled.  My thoughts of food around the world are clearly biased and based on my experiences of food tasted in my home town.  With that said...\n\nThis place is the BOMB!  \nWe ordered the appetizer: foie gras with small custard cake(slight surcharge but worth it-not included with the three course meal), scallop and beef, crab cake.  all delightful- melt in your mouth morsels. Never had better seared foie gras,  and better crab cake in my life!\nAmuse bouche -soup- was served not in a thimble or a Chinese soup spoon,  but in a classy demitasse which we sopped up with the exquisite baguette bread and butter sides.  We had to stop ourselves from breaking the owners bank by ordering multiple dishes of bread and butter spreads!\n\nEntrees:  Pork chop- bone in with mashed potatoes, hanger steak, and duck. \nAll dishes perfectly cooked and seasoned, vegetables were not an afterthought as in other restaurants that I have frequented.  baby book choy mixed in with other sweet veggies really showed a flair for presentation as well as a umami mix.  Portions about 50% larger than I expected for such a \"foo foo\" place.  After all this is not the usual greasy spoon places where quantity takes a back seat to quality and ambiance.  Its a \"Grey Poupon\" kind of place!  Not that you need it.\n\nDesserts:  Chocolate \"lava\" cake with peanut butter and ice cream, Apple tart with ice cream, coffee ice cream three ways, grilled angel food cake with lemon and fruits.  My favorite was the lava cake and the apple tart but everything was certainly made with love and tasted it.\n\nIf I still drank wine, I would have loved to taste the recommended pairings with the food from what I experienced in the past, the wines were really well priced and even tempted me with the thought process put into the suggestions.  \n\nIf you want to get on your \"Bougie\" without the major throw down, this is the place!\n\nI could eat here every day given that the service, ambiance, prices, and food is \"off the hook!\"  But I won't because I want to keep this place for the special occasions.  10 out of 10 on my spectrometer for shedding light, intensity and another level of gastronomical heaven that I had not experienced before.\n\nMake reservations because this place serves european style.

Soft music in background, last night it was early Beatles!\n\nMenus arrived with a teeny coffee mug of potato leek soup, just a couple sips to whet the appetite, then the small loaf of crusty warm bread with 3 butters: chive, olive, sweet.\n\nWe decided on the 3 course tasting menu, prix fix...and actually affordable at $37. each. We eschewed the paired wine tastings, at $28 since we each had an hours drive home, just had one glass of a tasty zin.\n\nWe shared everything: 2 apps: beet and cardomom carrot salad with a thinned goat cheese drizzle, and olive oil drizzle...this was the only dish that was not top notch...carrots and drizzles were wonderful, but the beets were overcooked to the point of mushy. 2nd app was the beef shortrib (off the bone) and scallop on bed of polenta. Sublime. I would never have thought of such a pairing...the beef had been cooking all day, tender and flavorful. The scallop perfectly cooked. \n\nEntres: Salmon on quenelle of shrimp mouse with a shrimp bisque sauce...amazing infusion of shrimp flavor...wonderful. Duck leg atop mashed potato with broccoli, mushroom sauce. Again, the duck leg was falling off the bone, but not at all dry...fabulous.\n\nDesserts: before the desserts arrived, the waitress/owner brought in a tiny cup of apple crisp with equally tiny scoop of vanilla ice cream with a little lit candle, she had overheard my friend wishing me a happy birthday. (no singing, thank. you.) Very very tasty crisp. Then, here comes the 2 included desserts, we had chosen the coffee semifreddo and the chocolate and peanut butter torte. Nice balance of flavors for all 3, not excessively sweet, intense chocolate and coffee flavors, fresh apple flavor.\n\nWe had arrived at 6pm, as we were finishing up dessert, my phone signaled a text...checked the time...it was 930!!! How leisurely this dinner was, non-stop gabbing, alternating with bites, and sips...I would have never guessed so much time had passed...service never felt slow, as the husband and wife owners/chefs/waiters alternated bringing our plates and clearing away.\n\nIt was really delicious, the private tables made us feel as if we were the only ones being served, the leisurely timing allowed us to really enjoy the food...if we had been hurried along, we would never have been able to eat so much! \n\nHighly recommended. Great for date night, with those romantic private tables. But also great anytime conversing with your friends is more important than being seen and people watching.\nThe owner told us that they are planning to replace the a la carte menu with only the 3 or 5 course tasting menus sometime soon. If I go again, I would take advantage of the a la carte, because as wonderful as the food was, I really ate a little too much.

Shortly after we arrived that couple seemed to have some sort of tiff regarding vegetarian items and the woman patron stomped out, leaving her embarrassed dinner companion to eat his giant hamburger by himself.\n\nThe owner, his wife and niece all provided service.  We chatted and introduced ourselves.  I kept wondering how the food was getting cooked since John (owner/chef) presented almost every dish and poured every glass of wine.  It was a lovely touch, though, and made us feel pampered.\n\nWe got the Chef's tasting menu and the wine pairing, both incredibly values at $50 for the food and just $25 for the wine (3 oz pours, but they warn you and that's enough when having 5 glasses).  John brought us one extra glass of chenin blanc when we sat down so we wouldn't be sitting there with nothing to drink/eat while we awaited the start of the meal.  Very nice touch:\n\nAmuse bouche 4.5: \nthe cutest little ham and cheese sammy ever -  a tiny piece of brie wrapped in thinly sliced ham in between two pieces of puff pastry.  It was about one inch square, no more, and would have been perfect if the cheese were just a tad softer/warmer.\n\nExtra course, just because he was trying out a new recipe 4: \n Butternut squash soup - let it be know, I am not a fan of any of those large baking squashes or pumpkin.  Despite that, this soup was very good, incredibly silky, gorgeous color, and the top off of earthy, crunchy, toasted pumpkin seeds went a long way to offset the sweetness of the gourd.\n\n Roasted Beets & Cardamom Carrot Salad topped with Laura Chenel goat cheese in phyllo pastry 4.5: \nWell my husband, who never eats beets liked them, and I, who am not terribly fond of goat cheese thought the little chevre purse was delightful.  The two of us, who mostly like our carrots raw, thought in this preparation with cardamom they were delicious\n\nSoftshell crab set on a spinach salad 4.5: \nThe menu called for a crab cake, but John said he had softshell crab and wondered if we'd like to try it.  Well he didn't have to ask twice, since we're both big fans.  These crab were perfectly cooked and tasted so fresh and wonderful.  He said he was still perfecting the recipe, but I think it was already there!  One small change I'd make is to leave out the pieces of hard cooked egg in the spinach salad.  They made it a little too rich; maybe better with the crab cake.\n\nWhisky Braised Oxtail & Maine Diver Scallop on creamy polenta 5:\nI've seen similar combos before, and frankly I think I'd prefer either one or the other.  The oxtail (it actually seemed more like a piece of short rib to me, but doesn't really matter) was deeply flavored and perfect texture - wonderfully tender, but not at all stringy.  The scallop was well cooked too, but a little overpowered by the rich meat sauces, and the polenta was creamy, but still had a little bit of texture - loved it\n\nBraised Duck Leg in a Port Wine Sauce 5:  I'm a big duck fan, especially the crispy skin.  Well this preparation was obviously not crispy, but left the duck meat with a silky and earthy. As my dear departed mom used to say, just ducky!\n\nPalate cleanser 3.5: raspberry granite with fresh strawberries- cleansed the palate, but had very little flavor.  Pretty color though\n\nCoffee ice cream, coffee granite, coffee cream, & almond brittle 4.5:  More elaborate than most semiffredo, liked the brittle.  This was a great way to end the meal.\n\nWe enjoyed ourselves immensely, but felt sorry for the poor deserted diner, who was standing out on the sidewalk when we left.  I guess his date took the car as well as spoiling the dinner.\n\nFood:  37/40\nService 20/20\nAtmosphere/Intangibles: 17/20\nValue: 20/20\noverall:94/100!", "author": "Diane B."}

A couple of things to note:\nThe menu rotates, so if you see something online and do not get your heart set on it. It may be there. It may not.\n\nOne trait I liked about this restaurant is it is slow paced and relaxed in a way that they actually want you to stay and enjoy your dinner. They are not concerned with having people dine and then cash out immediately. \n\nWe opted to do the three course meal which was a great deal if you plan on doing apps, entrees and dessert. \nOnce you order, they will bring out a sampling size of soup. \nI had the pear/walnut/blue cheese salad. I really like tart salads. \nFor dinner I had spice rubbed chicken. I personally loved the chicken. It had a crispy outside without that really fried and breaded chicken taste but wasn't dry or overcooked. \nMy dessert I ordered because the woman at the table next to me raved for seriously 10 minutes to her dinner guests. I wasn't in love with my dessert the way she was. It was a sort of mousse with blended ice and almond brittle. I just thought the ice it in was distracting and took away from the mousse. But different strokes for different folks. \n\n$22 for a bottle of wine. Three course meal was $35 each. Decent prices for the amount of food we ate. Check this place out!", "author": "Kim S."}

We had the 3 course tasting with a wine pairing and everything was absolutely delicious.  If you're hungry and enjoy food that is on the rich side, you will LOVE your meal - we did. The place seems to be run completely by two people alone (including the chef), and they really do treat you like you're in their home - incredibly sweet, welcoming, considerate and attentive as they can be.  The pacing is a touch slow because of the lack of staff, but we certainly didn't mind - we had plenty of food and wine to hold us between courses.

When we arrived for our reservation, there were parties before us who were finishing up after dining for over 3 hours. So the owners offered us some complimentary summer wine at the bar as we waited for our table to free up. That's fine with a wait like that and the owner was chatting with us and keeping us entertained. I was excited to try the food after great ambience and treatment so far. Menu is refined and options are all so yummy. We had the choice of 3 ($50) or 5 ($65) course menu--not bad for fine dining and multiple course meal including an appetizer starter, entree and dessert. We had a cute window seat table in front in this relatively small restaurant as it is. That's what makes it cute and quaint. :) Owner apologized for front part as they have plans to renovate the wine cellar, but we didn't even notice anything sore to the eyes upon entry. Back to the food, took a little while to come out because they were busy. It was worth the wait! The starter scallops and short rib on top of mash was delicious! My girlfriend even ordered an extra dish of that with her 3 course...lol I can see why. The crab cake salad was good, but rather so-so compared to the scallop and short rib. Main entree we had the duck and steak medallions that rocked...so flavorful and tender. I had tried the pork chop and it was huge! I personally didn't like the flavorful profile of this one compared to the other dishes and I got tired of eating it after a whole because the portion was just a bit too big for me personally. If you like pork with a bone and hungry, try this one out. :) As for dessert, all the ones we ordered were delicious. We had the chocolate lava cake with peanut butter inside and a scoop of ice cream (great for chocolate lovers; bit on the sweet side for me but the ice cream helped balance the chocolate), fruit parfait (refreshing fruit and light cream), and the coffee cup crisp (very interesting textures of crunch and soft cream blend for a yummy coffee flavored dessert).\n\nKeep in mind, the owner and chef would modify the menu according to what is seasonal and best ingredients available the time of the year. It is what makes this place special. :) I would highly recommend and plan to spend some time enjoying your dining experience here as it would probably easily take you about 3 hours well spent here.", "author": "Christine N."}

Because of babysitting needs, we came for an early dinner, and we would have walked except for the hard rain so we drove.  We found parking across the street, which I know it was a stroke of luck, we live in the neighborhood so we know how difficult it can be to park.  Can't fault a neighborhood restaurant for the lack of parking.  You can't have the cake and eat it too!\n\nThe ambiance is very intimate and cozy, making it the perfect spot for a date, a romantic evening with your special one.  It is not the perfect place for a group dinner, or loud revelers.  It has a small bar, so it can double up for a drink with the wife sans the meal in the future.  \n\nThe food was excellent, quite scrumptious actually.  Very reasonably priced, for the quality and the small size.  I believe I saw only one entree starting with a 2.  We had the rib and scallop and the crab cake appetizers.  I had the duck leg for entree, and my wife just had the crab cake and seasonal vegetables as her entree (not a big eater).  The crab cake was served in a bowl and a sauce, which made it a bit soggy, although it tasted great.  This is the only issue we had with the meal.  The rest was fabulous, and we appreciated the flexibility to carve out the seasonal veggies, which are part of another entree, to special serve them to my wife without the rest of the entree.  \n\nThe wine list presents a surprisingly affordable selection.  Expensive bottles are at hand if it is your preference.  But where else in San Francisco do you find a restaurant that only doubles the retail price instead of tripling it?\n\nService was impeccable.  We will be back.", "author": "Massimo M."}

Siblings and I reassured him that we weren't in no rush.\n\nWe got seated in the 2nd room...folks... this is a major DATE place! Almost everyone around us that night were either a couple or they were on their first dates (ie: the couple behind us b/c the lady was all decked out!)\n\nAnyway... service was prompt and friendly...\n\nSiblings and I got the following:\n\n- Seared Sonoma Foie Gras with apple sauce & pain perdu = by no means that this compares to La Folie... but it was decent... I ended up ordering this b/c my sis said it would go perfect with the Cristal that she was going to order. Me: why yes, of course dear sis... I shall get it. And the sis knows me well - it was indeed perfect. Bite of this... a sip of the Cristal... heightened taste palate indeed! My bro had it and his response: \"Oh my gosh, that just melts in your mouth!\" Needless to say... he finished half of it.\n\n- Wild Pacific Salmon (with ratatouille & tomato cream sauce) = I wasn't feeling the rest of the entree choices so I opted to go light with salmon and it didn't disappoint... it was tasty - well seasoned and fresh. The veggies were an added bonus.\n\n- Fresh Cream Panna Cotta with apple cream topped with lemon curd & streusel = DELICIOUS! By far my favorite panna cota and trust me when I say that... every time I have dinner with the siblings we're always on a mission to find the best and I think this was the winner.

There weren't any loser dished, everything was cooked brilliantly and perfectly, true mastery in the kitchen. Highlights are the sweetbread apps (makes fried chicken seem boring), the beets, the heirloom tomatoes (how do they always get the perfect tomatoes) and the scallop/shortrib combo.

This challenge may have dampened our enthusiasm a bit, but the brisk walk in the cold was definitely good for our cardios.\n\nWe were the first to arrive at this very cozy place, it was nothing fancy but we felt comfortable. Both the busboy and the waiter seem relatively new, very friendly and attentive.  I was a little disappointed that the menu was shorter then what's on the website, they removed the oysters and replaced ox tail with short rib. The crusty bread and flavored butter were very tasty.We had a harvest salad and short rib with scallop for starters, both were delish especially the scallop I was hungry for more.\n\nOur mains were the hanger steak and salmon; both dishes were decent but on the salty side for our tastes. The steak was good but a little chewy, hubby didn't enjoy the cubed potatoes and cream spinach came with the steak. in hindsight perhaps we should pay $5 more for the NY. The salmon was grilled to perfection. I also liked the mushroom slices and string beans.

I have to say that it was quite a pleasant experience. It was located in a cute little restaurant with a nice atmosphere.\n\nWe decided against the tasting menu and chose to order individual items instead. We started with the crab cakes and braised oxtail with scallops. We thought that they were excellent, but the portion size was rather small. The complimentary bread is fantastic here though, and it comes with a few nice spreads including an olive spread, butter, and a pesto spread.\n\nFor our main course, we shared several entrees:\nCrispy Skin Pan Fried Chicken: The chicken was quite tender and the crispy skin was very flavorful. This dish was very delicious, definitely one of the better chicken dishes that I've had.\nWild Pacific Salmon: The salmon was quite moist and cooked very well. I thought that it could use more seasoning though, as there wasn't that much flavor.\nLinguini and Clams: This is probably one of the best linguini and clams I've ever had. The flavor of the sauce on the linguini complemented the noodles well. Also, the noodles were cooked to a perfect tenderness.\nHanger Steak: This steak was rather bland and tough. I would recommend paying the extra $5 for the NY Steak, which is substantially more tender. I would recommend going for the steak cooked medium, or more undercooked if you're a fan of that. \n\nWe ended our meal with the Warm Chocolate and Peanut Butter Torte. It was quite delicious as well! Definitely worth the wait if you're a peanut butter fan, there's a little bit of peanut butter in the center. It's rather dense and heavy for a concluding dessert, but had a pleasant sweetness to it.\n\nOverall, the food was quite good and reasonably priced. In addition, the service was excellent as well. It's a cute shop that I would definitely consider revisiting. Sadly they don't seem to have any specials for birthdays, which would have been nice.", "author": "Michael L."}

If they ever serve lunch, we would go in a heart beat too.  The owner John takes orders, explains everything on the menu, and honors special requests.  Then he goes to the kitchen to make sure all dishes are cooked as ordered.  His charming wife brings out the food and helps cooking and plating in the kitchen.  We often order the $36 per-person prix fix menu (choose 1 from 5 appetizer options, 1 from 5 entree options and 1 from 4 desert options).  We love the following dishes:\n\nAppetizers\nCrabcake with spinach salad\nBeet salad\nBraised short rib in creamy polenta\nCorn brioch pudding\n\nEntree\nNew York steak\nDuck with mashed potatoes\nSalmon (he changes up the style and it is good anyway he does it)\n\nIt is hard to get a reservation at the restaurant because John never overbooks his tables.  He makes sure each party has at least 2 hours of gastronomic bliss.  He strives for quality over quantity.  Therefore, my family love to eat here twice monthly.

I still don't get why our server couldn't take our order when we told her we were ready multiple times. \n\nThe food was mediocre, nothing to rave about. The highlight was probably their butter spread, but even that was kind of cold and frozen. The weird thing was how my friend's iced tea came out toward the end of the dinner, and it tasted like metallic. \n\nIt was really hard to get our server's attention throughout the meal. Hence, the late iced tea. She comp'd it, but that was probably because it tasted like liquid metal.

If you're looking for something French, The Richmond is the place to go. Though not really French cuisine (more on the fusion side), the food is superb and well prepared.\n\n6PM Reservation: an associate had called me 2 hours before service regarding our reservation, and he was genuine over the phone - which is always great to hear. \n\nWe were promptly seated on the western side (The Richmond occupies two store/spaces). The ambiance is great, with low lighting, velvet red/blackish drapes, and we sat near a beautiful painting (which I uploaded to YELP) with extruding molded tree branches.\n\nOriginally we went in wanting a large meal, but because my friends aunt fed her snacks prior to meeting up (Chinese families never know when to stop feeding their guest), so we opted to each order a main course, and an appetizer to share (we both love to eat, and so this was an experience).\n\n*A bowl of citrus juices and carrot juice/slivers were served as a palette cleanser. It almost resembled a gazpacho, and I wanted more!\n\n1. Crab Cake (portion was on the bigger side, but there was only one [I would have liked a second], super fresh crabs with celery and citrus of lemon]. I loved my crab cake without anything on it / my friend drizzled some lemon juice for added moisture.\n\n2. Braised Brisket in red wine sauce, diver scallop, and a bed of polenta (superbly delicious, melts in your mouth, simply falls off, scallop cooked perfectly, and polenta was an excellent pairing). I almost wished that this be a meal itself.\n\n3. We both ordered: Duck Leg in red wine sauce, medley of vegetables and mashed potatoes (wow, the duck leg fell off the bone without any force from my fork, and I loved the sauce on the mashed potatoes just as I do with turkey and gravy). My friend and I sat there with moments of silence because we were deeply intertwined with our food.\n\nA dessert menu was brought to our attention after the clearing of plates. On YELP (unfortunately, an out dated menu) listed Panacotta as a dessert option, of which we both wanted. All of the other dessert seemed delicious, but we really wanted Panacotta, and so left dessert out for the night.\n\nFine dining is a must, and The Richmond lives up to its praise.

Something was clearly going on behind the scenes because the chef waited on us and the waitresses were just kind of wandering around a mostly empty restaurant. Drinks took forever and he said he was giving us a glass of wine on the house. \n\nThe next thing we know, we heard the chef full on SCREAMING at the staff in the kitchen. It went on and on and on about how the servers were fucking up and how they obviously didn't care about \"their futures\" and how things were finally \"going good\" and the staff was fucking it the fuck up. \n\nWhat made it even worse was that there were only a few parties in there at that point, and everyone was just kind of awkwardly waiting around for their food, which for us took about an hour for a cheeseburger and a vegetable turnover. One poor woman had been waiting to pay for awhile, and she ended up having to go into the kitchen to hand off her credit card, which only incited more screaming from the chef. \n\nThe future here seems bleak, Chef, if you treat your staff like that and don't seem to care if your customers overhear your rage. \n\nOh, and we were charged for that glass of wine anyway.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-03", "description": "So unassuming...so unexpected...so good! \n\nWhen one of my buddies suggested The Richmond for dinner one night, I really didn't know what to expect.  Without the benefit of reading some reviews beforehand, I was only able to go with what I skimmed through on the ride there - great quality for the money, terrific service, and they served foie (sold!).\n\nWalking in, the place is rather quaint.  Modest but not small, not busy but not dead...just the way I like it.  Seated at a table by the door with a curtain draped around it, it was pretty nice to have a semi-secluded area to ourselves.  If only I was there on a date instead of with a couple of my childhood friends...\n\nAfter skimming through the menu, I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly prices - appetizers averaging around $9 (not counting the foie) and entrees for $20?  Fair prices and good food make the best combination of all.\n\n- Bread with Regular, Chive, and Olive Butter (free) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1KbZaqEdZkn6LHlA55M64g?select=1xEIzijgxhJ6OXPg9dI-SQ#8dLcrpiMf18yqf3odx0fQQ) - not a huge part of the meal, but it was pretty different.  The olive butter was okay (not a huge fan of olives), but I liked the chive butter a lot.\n- Julienne Carrots and Mango with Cilantro and Carrot Juice Amuse-bouche (free) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1KbZaqEdZkn6LHlA55M64g?select=1xEIzijgxhJ6OXPg9dI-SQ#fab2IPo6G7l9epu1aTi-8A) - Simple, but I liked the crisp, refreshing flavor.  A nice way to cleanse the palate before the main part of the meal.\n- Seared Artisan Foie Gras with a Foie & Chicken Mousseline Raviolo and Black Truffle Sauce ($17) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1KbZaqEdZkn6LHlA55M64g?select=1xEIzijgxhJ6OXPg9dI-SQ#4Hv-jf4ZPrFH05TTb3qKuQ) - my favorite of the night, partly because foie was everywhere.  The piece of foie gras was a little small, but it was seared nicely and had just the right richness.  The raviolo was terrific - I never knew foie and chicken made for such a delicious pair!\n- Pork Tenderloin & Swedish Meatball Roti with Potato Puree ($19) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1KbZaqEdZkn6LHlA55M64g?select=1xEIzijgxhJ6OXPg9dI-SQ#RFyeZBCUCGOSBVLot0wA8w) - if meatloaf and turducken had a child, this would be it.  The meatballs wrapped inside the  tenderloin were juicy and flavorful (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1KbZaqEdZkn6LHlA55M64g?select=1xEIzijgxhJ6OXPg9dI-SQ#7T1twZ3FCo-i3GoF01Jcng), while the pork exterior stayed tender and moist.  A little meat heavy, but it was good.\n- Coffee Semifreddo (Coffee Ice Cream, Coffee Granite, and Almond Brittle) ($6) (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1KbZaqEdZkn6LHlA55M64g?select=1xEIzijgxhJ6OXPg9dI-SQ#oyEqOY5cYGoBlfPGNecyWg) - the first few bites were filled with ice crystals, but they melted away soon enough.  I really liked the coffee flavor and how the brittle added some crunch. \n\nBeyond the food, the service at The Richmond is just as impressive.  Our waiter and the owner were very friendly and came by often to check on us.  Even the chef came by our table after our entrees were served just to see how we liked the food.  While it can get lost amongst the other restaurants in the area, The Richmond shouldn't be overlooked.  FOUR AND A HALF STARS for the food, but rounding up for the service.

It was a great way to excite my taste-buds. A very festive shot of warm apple cider with hints of cinnamon that really warmed the heart. \n\nRoasted Beet Salad - [http://s3-media3.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/eNojl4S8pfBeXpZWOucwdg/l.jpg]\nI'm not sure if I was suppose to eat this or admire it's beautiful placement because it looked like a work of art, and for a salad, there was nothing GREEN about it! However, the beet salad wasn't too much to rave about.. carrots, wafer, beets, moreover just more memorable by the presentation.\n\nSonoma Foie Gras - [http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/yVxUp323bijXbKT5ZAcfzg/l.jpg]\nOkay, I'm not much of a foie gras fiend but OMG, this single-handily won me over. \nAnother beautifully executed dish, a nice sear on the foie gras, and the crisp of the maple brioche perdu all together just melted in my mouth.. Make me an entree out of this because this is ridiculously delicious! \n\nBacon-wrapped New York Steak - [http://s3-media1.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0vuGpI2H3iOpPcgNd6JLMw/l.jpg]\nNew York steak? wrapped in bacon!? simple yet genius! I love my beef bloody on the inside so I had it cooked medium rare and med-rare is what I got -- superb. It was a large steak, nearly 3/4th covered in crispy bacon, which laid atop of a bed of flavorful bok choy and diced taters. My steak was very juicy and still bloody when I took my first cut and the fusion of crispy pig and juicy cow all became one. \n\nCompliments to Chef John!\n\nThe Richmond is definitely a keeper in my book. It won't burn a hole in your pocket dining here (unless you love expensive wines) and it does have that quiet candlelight atmosphere, which is perfect for dates, but the restaurant itself isn't very big nor spacious within. For bigger groups, having someone get up just so another could go to the restroom was a little bothersome, but it wasn't that big of an issue for us. Our waiter, Rudy, was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations for wines, while maintaining professional tact while dealing with us.. (we were quite belligerently intoxicated off the wine).

I would've never assumed this place was a restaurant, when I  pass by it in the car.  We made reservations and knew we all wanted to start with the foie gras.  The foie gras pairing was similar the the one I had at Chapaeu.   It was still pretty good and it wasn't over cooked .  And the size of the foie gras was pretty decent.  I do love the bread they have here. It comes with 3 different types of buttery spreads. regular butter with sea salt. olive and chive.  All the spreads were pretty good, but i think my favorite was the chive one.  However, I did not like my entree which was the Pork tenderlion with Swedish meatballs.  It was very tough and wasn't as tender as i hoped for. I wish i can give you four stars, but i really can't.", "author": "Belinda C."}

Despite for years having scoured the Richmond for food of all kinds, I'd never heard of this place. How could a restaurant with 4.5 Yelp stars and an affordable tasting menu have flown under the radar?\n\nTurns out it's for both good and not-so-good reasons that \"The Richmond\" isn't as hyped as other comparable restaurants.\n\nThe good is that the food is good. We ordered tasting menus all around, which consisted of the following courses:\n\n1. Roasted beet and carrot salad with goat cheese pastry\n2. Heirloom tomato salad with corn salsa\n3. Seared scallop over something\n4. Oxtail and oyster mushrooms over polenta\n5. Some dessert I can't remember\n\nThe goat cheese pastry, heirloom tomatoes, and oxtail were especially good. Plus, each individual tasting menu item can be ordered individually a la carte, which is a nice option.\n\nWe also ordered a Shake N' Bake chicken entree which was deceptively great.\n\nThe bad is that, for a \"nice\" restaurant, the setting is kind of a mess. The restaurant is dark inside and small yet somehow not especially intimate. Our hostess was very kind but also dressed in jeans and a t-shirt, in contrast to the wait staff who wore black uniforms. Also, the restroom is under significant renovation, which I suppose isn't a flaw per se but it's more than a little jarring to walk behind the curtain, open the restroom door, and see concrete and no ceiling and a bunch of paper signs slapped onto the walls.\n\nSo, no plans to return anytime soon, but might be worth keeping an eye on any changes to the restaurant that might make it more of a fine dining destination.", "author": "Albert L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-08-18", "description": "My boyfriend found this little gem through Zagat. Rated 25, this place fits into its neighborhood in San Francisco. It looks like a hole-in-the-wall, didn't even realized we passed by until my boyfriend was already inside. \n\nFirst thing I saw when I walked in was a wine bar, the table complete with a collection of different wine crates and a beautiful and cozy wine cellar leading to the back.  However, I thought the atmosphere was kind of stiff.  It's definitely for the older crowd.\n\nI ordered the scallops for appetizer.  I honestly don't like scallops that much, but the fact that they were braised in oxtail sounded especially pleasing so I had to try it. They were so delicious that I didn't want to give my boyfriend any...but did anyway so I could try his foie gras (also amazing!!!!!).  I would probably return and order those scallops again.  I ordered the Wild Pacific Cod with seafood chowder...a dish that was super delicious. The Richmond definitely had its sauce down!  I tried my friend's porkchop -- probably everyone's favorite for the night. My boyfriend had the seared hanger steak, which was pretty good, although everyone really did love the porkchop the most. Another friend of mine ordered the burger, and it was massive. It came with interesting sauces, including this one red vodka sauce (in place of ketchup perhaps?) and some home-cut french fries.  \n\nOur waiter kind of reminded me of Justin Timberlake! He didn't pour our wine in proportion (there were 6 of us), but to make up for it he served the last two people 2 extra (and complimentary) wine glasses!  \n\nI'd really like to give this place 4.5 stars, but I can't.", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-11-16", "description": "Official rating: 3.5 stars. \n\nI went here for my three year anniversary with my boyfriend. The service started off a little lacking; I had made reservations, but when we walked in, no one was there to greet us for at least five minutes. Don't be put off though--service quickly picked up after that however and was fantastic for the rest of the night.\n\nOur waiter was extremely helpful with the wine selections (and they do have a very large wine list). He recommended a variety of wines and allowed us to taste many of them; he also brought two tasting glasses so that both of us could try the wines. The bread provided was also really yummy with the different dipping sauces. \n\nFor the starter courses, we had the crab cakes and the whisky braised braised oxtail. The oxtail was the best dish of the night for me--it was tender and delicious. The crab cakes were decent, but nothing special. For the entrees, we ordered the hanger steak and the braised duck leg. Neither dish was especially out of this world; both dishes were technically cooked perfectly, but lacked creativity. The hanger steak was a perfect medium rare and the duck leg was fall-off-the bone, but both dishes seemed a bit uninspired--your standard meat dish with red wine sauce (something, that if I really wanted to, I could make at home). For dessert, we ordered the coffee semifreddo and the panna cotta. Again, both desserts were yummy, but nothing particularly special.\n\nOverall, I thought that the food was good and cooked very well, but did not have much imagination. I'll admit, this is probably because I came in with VERY high expectations--4.5 stars out of 418 reviews led me to believe that this place was going to be mind blowing. The chef was clearly very well trained, but for the prices and taste, I didn't think that the food was original enough to warrant 4.5 stars. The restaurants itself is very small and intimate (great place to take a date), but the decor was a little bland and did not add much to the dining experience. While the service ended up being very helpful and the food cooked perfectly, I was disappointed that the food was not more imaginative. Generally speaking, the Richmond did not live up to my expectations of an upscale restaurant.", "author": "Angela T."}

Tucked away in San Francisco's \"New Chinatown\" (Inner Richmond), The Richmond serves upscale New American fare at recession-friendly prices.  \n\nLast Monday, 4.11.11, my friends and I (party of 4) came to The Richmond for dinner. We arrived for our 7 PM reservations and were promptly seated.\n\nW I N E:\nThe Richmond's wine list focuses on small family wineries. Most of the wines by the glass were $6-$8 and bottles ranged from $14 - $750, so there's something for everyone. Corkage fee is $20/bottle. \n\nI started with a glass of the 2008 Ramsay Pinot Noir, North Coast ($7) which was rich and medium bodied with prominent strawberry notes and a touch of spice. \n\nF O O D:\n(Sorry, no food pics since they didn't transfer onto my new phone.)\n\n*AMUSE BOUCHE - Deviled Egg: THE PERFECT SMALL BITE! \n\nRich, creamy and smooth with a slight tang to awaken your taste buds.\n\n*SEARED FOIE GRAS w/ Apple Sauce & Pain Perdu ($15.95): DELISH!\n\nThe perfectly seared foie gras crowned a slice of crisp and soft pain perdu (French bread) with a surrounding dollop of apple sauce. Crisp around the edges, the foie gras gently crumbled and melted like butter in my mouth. Although buttery, the crisp and fluffy pain perdu was the perfect canvas for the foie gras since the subtle sweet tartness from the apple sauce helped to balance the rich flavors. \n\n*HANGER STEAK w/ a Pancetta, Potato & Brie filled Crepe ($19.95): DELECTABLE!\n\nThe hanger steak was grilled and sliced with a warm pink center. Hanger steak can be tough and chewy if not cooked properly, but the hanger steak at The Richmond was tender, moist and juicy. It was perfectly seasoned to bring out its natural beefy goodness. The crisp crepe was rich and savory; the brie added a milky richness, while the pancetta added a hint of porky saltiness. \n\n*PANNA COTTA w/ Lemon Curd & Streusel ($6.00): THE PERFECT SWEET ENDING!\n\nVelvety smooth and thick, the panna cotta was rich and milky and the lemon curd added a burst of citrus punch and the streusel a sweet buttery crisp.\n\nS E R V I C E:\nFriendly and attentive. We were constantly being checked on so service was a bit on the \"too\" attentive side. Our water glasses were always filled like clockwork which we appreciated. \n\nWhat really surprised us is when the Chef came out to tell my friend that he had overcooked her steak a bit. He didn't want to serve the steak not properly cooked to her liking (she requested it rare), so he brought her a crab cake while he grilled her a new steak. We thought that was such a nice gesture and that the Chef really went beyond the call of duty. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R:\nUpscale, yet casual with crisp white linen tables, mellow yellow walls and abstract artwork. It can get very quiet and tables are well spaced out so The Richmond is ideal for intimate dinners. \n\nP A R K I N G:\nEasy street parking on the weekdays before 6 PM. Difficult street parking thereafter and on weekends. There are no nearby parking lots. \n\nIf you're looking for a quaint date place with beautifully presented food that tastes as good as it looks and that won't break the bank, The Richmond IS the place!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

So I was psyched when my fiance took me here for my birthday dinner.\n\nThe place didn't look much from the outside, but the wait staff made us feel welcome right as we stepped in. We were seated in a cozy little corner by the street-facing window, and made us feel very private. \n\nTheir menu isn't huge, and changes periodically. There is a prix fixe 5-course tasting menu for $49.95 a person (excl. drinks) but we opted to go a la carte since our tummies have shrunken from our recent healthier diets (yay). \n\nEverything brought to our table was delicious! The bread & butter trio consisting of parsley chive butter, kalamatta olive butter, and sweet cream butter was a nice treat. I was good and indulged in only 2 pieces of bread; but I smothered the parsley chive butter ALL over my bread. So tasty! The palette cleanser of citrusy amuse bouche was interesting and refreshing. \n\nFor appetizer we ordered the Roasted Beets & Cardamom Carrot Salad and Whisky Braised Oxtail with a Maine Diver Scallop. The beets salad was incredibly delicious, as was the braised oxtail and the scallop. The oxtail was full of flavor and of perfect texture, and the scallop was excellent and fresh. The creamy polenta upon which the oxtail and scallop sat tasted great with the oxtail sauce. Yummy!\n\nWe got the Braised duck leg, mushroom sauce and mashed potatoes and Hanger steak for our mains. My duck leg was tender and slide off the bones! The flavor was perfect, just enough duck and not overboard. I tried the hanger steak as well and it was meaty and satisfying. The portions were very generous and with all the apps, I only finished half of my entree! Finished off the memorable meal with a coffee semifreddo on the house. The almond brittle was a real wow and the crunch was tremendous.  \n\nI had a perfect night with my amazing fiance.

The hand cut fries were really crispy and savory, and the burger was great, too -- my only flag was that the burger was a bit too big for my liking (1/2 lb), and due to the size, it soaked through the bun as the meal went on, and became a bit difficult to eat.

But usually there is some sort of apology and/or explanation but neither was offered.  We got the same reaction when my friend asked if they had a black napkin because the white one was leaving a lot of lint on her black pants.  It's ok to not have black napkins but a \"sorry\" would be nice.  \n\nThe food (beet salad, butternut squash soup, crab cakes, salmon, short rib and scallops, chocolate peanut butter torte) was all fine but nothing special.

I've seen eight lavishly-dressed adults seated comfortably not far from a table of four energetic kids and 3 parents, all enjoying themselves with my friend and I just six feet away ... the acoustics are surprisingly accommodating.  \n\nWe've eaten here five times and it is a pleasure to be treated to the free, surprise appetizer; good bread with three varieties of butter; thoughtful, palate-awakening first and main courses that are downright generous in proportion considering that one may easily pay double for half that gorgeous amount at more upscale addresses.\n\nI selfishly hope The Richmond will not move to a larger, high-end space with which this dining experience could deservedly pair.

It was an honor to get to eat at this local treasure in San Francisco for my boyfriend's birthday. We both hadn't eaten this fancy in awhile and decided to go all out - this place was never a disappointment.\n\nBrush up on your table manners before you get here so you don't look silly when they change your forks, etc. ;)  It is definitely a complete dining experience - especially if you order their tasting menu. My boyfriend and I opted for the 5 course tasting menu including wine pairing - so worth it! \n\nTo start off as a 'palate cleanser' we were given melon and watermelon. Their bread comes with three choices of butter - sea salt, olive and herb (the herb/green butter was my favorite!). The bread comes out fresh but gets a little hard - but don't feel like you have to fill up because a number of plates are to come...\n\nNext we were given a soup that was a mix of squash and topped with some roasted pumpkin seeds and fresh cream - tiny cup of delicious. \n\nTo start off the tasting menu was the beet and carrot salad topped with a phyllo pastry stuffed with cheese - thought I am NOT a huge fan of beets, this was very pleasant and offered very different flavors at one time. The Chardonnay to pair was light and good even by itself. Their heirloom tomato salad had some of the BEST corn I have ever tasted (which sounds weird but you just had to try it) - Pinot Gris was not my favorite but went well with the dish. \n\nThe Oxtail was really to die for and their polenta was cooked to perfection. It is served with a beautiful Pinot Noir (my FAVORITE wine of the night). By the Oxtail I was almost full already but truly enjoyed the petite Lamb with potato, and I ALWAYS enjoy a good Cab ;) \n\nBy the time dessert came I was already stuffed, but the coffee semifreddo was unlike  anything I have eaten before. It is literally served with some flavored ice but the cream and the almond brittle plus ice cream blend together \n\nI could go on and on but a couple things I want to hit on:\n1. Service is superb and you see the dedication of the owner as he visits your table.\n2. The wine pairing is WORTH it.

I love how the bread comes with three kinds of butter: parsley chive (my favorite), kalamatta olive, and sweet cream. \n\nI ordered the halibut with white wine tomato sauce and braising greens. That dish was pretty good, but it did not blow me away. I think the fish was cooked a bit too long but the white wine tomato sauce was delicious. I also tried the seared hangar steak and lamb. The hangar steak was my favorite dish. It was cooked perfectly and  melted in my mouth. It was accompanied by a brie filled \"brick dough\" crepe, which is a like a crispy philo-dough hot pocket filled with brie and potato. Delish!! The halibut and hangar steak were under $20 and the lamb was ~$24 - very reasonably priced for the quality. We also got crab and cream cheese filled fried wontons as an appetizer compliments of the chef! I tasted real crab meat, not the imitation stuff.\n\nFor dessert, we tried the warm chocolate & peanut butter torte (it's like a slice of heaven - takes 15 minutes to prep, but worth the wait!), fresh cream panna cotta, and coffee semifreddo. All three were really good, but the torte was my favorite (it's surprisingly not overwhelmingly sweet or rich).\n\nBetween the 7 of us, we paid about $40 each (one entree per person, 2 bottles of wine, and 3 desserts).

I was later greeted by a very friendly waiter. He was late by about ten minutes and he sincerely apologized. \n\nI was started off with a ham and cheese puff pastry. It was served cold but the pastry part was still light and flakey. The cheese and ham together proved a bit too salty for my tastes. Next, the bread was served three different kinds of gourmet butters: plain, green chive, and olive flavored. I would recommend the green chive  out of the three. The bread itself was warm and fresh. Next, I received the scallops and braised short rib with polenta. The scallops were seared to perfection and the short ribs would come apart with the slice of a fork. The polenta complimented both meats perfectly. They also had a crab cake served with spinach salad, eggs, and bacon bits. The breading was crispy and the filling was tasty. Although if I had my choice I would go with the scallops any day. Next was the salmon. It was beautifully served with an orange-colored cream sauce with vegetables. The middle was left raw, which by my standards, was preferable. For other people, I'm not so sure. I got to try their braised duck which really caught my attention. It was cooked amazingly and served up with green beans and mashed potatoes. To finish up, I ordered their coffee dessert. It featured a rather strong coffee flavor with caramel brittle bits and whipped cream. But they also served a peanut butter lava cake with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which I actually ended up liking more. \n\nAll in all, a very pleasant and memorable dining experience.

We originally arrived sans reservations at about 8:15PM, and the hostess choked on her words and ran for assistance because I suppose nobody ever has the audacity to show up without reservations.  The place was completely empty, but the server assured us they were booked and people would be arriving soon.  The earliest spot available was 9:00PM.  We put our name down and walked around the neighborhood, passing up several opportunities to eat elsewhere.  After Yelping the place for himself and seeing that I was intent on going to this place, we came back at 9:00PM, seated, and happy as a clam.  \n\nWhat a phenomenal meal.  We got the beet salad to start.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and both of us mopped up as much sauce as we could.  The puff pastry was so light and flaky, they really have it down to a science.  The bread was warm and the butters delicious, particularly the olive and chive ones.  They also gave out complimentary crab rangoons to the patrons that night.  The dollop of filling in the center was tiny, but delicious.  I ordered the hanger steak and he the 1/2 pound burger.  Neither of us were asked how we wanted our meat cooked, but luckily our food came prepared with adequate pinkage.  \n\nThe hanger steak also came with a crepe, filled with potatoes and cheese.  I'm glad they had some greens with this entree (spinach I think), but this was no light faire.  Neither was my friend's burger, which we both concur, might be one of the best burger deals in town.  A whopping 8oz. of scrumptious burger in a bun with all the fixings, fries, and fancy condiments (Dijon mustard, spicy ketchup, garlic aioli) included for $9.95?!  Why get a burger anywhere else if you're even remotely in the area?!\n\nThe servers were very kind and attentive, always keeping our glasses full.  The head chef even came out once or twice to thank the patrons for attending and getting some people their to-go boxes.  Even though this is a \"fancy\" establishment for the area, any feeling of pretension is primarily brought in by the guests themselves, not so much the people who work there.\n\nWe were so full, there was no room for dessert.  Absolutely none whatsoever.  The both of us kept pestering the other to not let our glass of pinot go to waste.

Are you too lazy to innovate? Not creative enough to keep up?\n\nThis is why when I saw the Richmond's menu which consist of a small list of classic dishes like burger and fries, steak or salmon, I was highly suspect of the rave reviews on yelp. Not to mention, the name \"the Richmond,\" is so nondescript that it makes you wonder if the restaurant had any imaginations at all. But this place turns out to be a very pleasant surprise, because it does the classic dishes so well.\n\nAs we have learned form Yelp, they provide 3 types of butter for the bread. I liked the olive and chive ones, but honestly the traditional one with sea salt was my favorite. It just tasted more, buttery. \n\nMy friend loved her foie gras and our crab cakes were good. It's interesting that the cakes were perched on top of what tasted like a thin layer of clam chowder. The tangy greens on top added a nice layer of acidity to the dish.  The restaurant was kind enough to split the dish into two plates of crab cakes that are easier for sharing. \n\nI ordered sea bass as my entree and it looks like a hefty half-pounder. The fish was moist and the snow peas and carrots underneath were tasty.  I especially liked the green and yellow purees that had a nice subtle flavor that went well with the delicate fish.\n\nEven though we were full, we shared the chocolate cake and pan perdu for dessert. Can't go wrong with chocolate cake and buttery toast! Again, very classic but well done.\n\nIt's not a cheap place and the ambiance isn't trendy or loud.

I will start by saying that my boyfriend and I had a great time during our visit to the restaurant this weekend - the ambiance is quaint and interesting, the wine, recommended to us by our waiter, was reasonably priced and uniquely delicious.  The Richmond does a wonderful job of making you feel welcomed and provides special touches, such as providing a complimentary amuse-bouche before dinner, serving an entire mini-loaf of fresh bread with three kinds of butter and delivering tiny, tasty cookies to the table in an adorable little container at the end of the meal.\n\nI ordered the Whisky Braised Oxtail with a Maine Diver Scallop and the Seared Sonoma Foie Gras.   Both were very yummy and the flavors were there, but the oxtail was slightly overly chewy.   My boyfriend ordered the House Ground Half-Pound Cheeseburger & Hand Cut French Fries which he did not enjoy and described as generally not tasty - more of a blob of flavorless meat on a bun.  We had also in the past had bad experiences with the restaurant's Hanger Steak - which was not cooked consistently, chewy and served with a  weird cheese pastry thing that just didn't add much deliciousness to the plate.\n\nI actually feel terrible writing these bad things about the food but I hope that the chef/owner reads these and sees the trend on certain dishes.  On the Whisky Braised Oxtail with a Maine Diver Scallop - delicious, keep this one but make sure the meat portion of the dish is always tender.   The Seared Sonoma Foie Gras - nailed it.   The burger:  start over to produce a good burger and get better fries.  The hanger Steak:  create a new dish (ditch the pastry thing and make sure the meat not too chewy and is consistently cooked).  \n\nBecause I actually do want to come back.....", "author": "Holly L."}

Upon entering, the down-at-the-heels former store front gives way to a minuscule bar and immerses patrons in a cozy dining room with several tiny curtained alcoves that encourage romantic dining.\n\nWhile the number of selections is limited, the menu reminds guests that it is not quantity, but quality, that counts.  At The Richmond, the beautiful presentation is overshadowed only by the explosion of flavors in every bite of every dish.\n\nAn amuse bouche of fried won ton stuffed with creme fraiche and crab was the perfect way to start a dining experience.  While the slices were slightly too thick, the beef carpaccio with aioli, asparagus, and fried capers was tender and delicious.  Accompanied by Laura Chenel goat cheese wrapped in phyllo, the roasted red and yellow beets were sweet and tender.  The roasted squash and celery root soup featured slight anise overtones that served as the perfect foil for the creamy sweetness of the base, prompting a guest to ask, \"Is it wrong to want to pick up the bowl and lick it?\"  With a tomato and white wine sauce, the sea bass with snap peas and carrots was flavorful and rich.\n\nThe friendly and attentive service showed superior attention to detail:  shared dishes were split in the kitchen and the pacing of courses was relaxed, but not slow.  At the end of the meal, the chef visited the table to ensure that everything was satisfactory.  \n\nThe wine list offers a myriad of reasonably priced \"everyday\" selections as well as the requisite bottles of California cult Cabernets.  With many establishments wringing every penny out of diners' wallets by jacking up margins in their beverage programs, it is nice to see a little restraint from The Richmond.\n\nOffering a sophisticated dining experience that in other parts of The City would warrant prices close to twice as great, The Richmond is indeed a neighborhood gem.", "author": "CJ G."}

I'm not sure whether I'd go back.\n\nHere are the details:\n\n- Heirloom tomato salad with corn/avocado salsa ($11) was good, but the sweet sauce it was served with was too sweet for my taste.\n\n- Pork Tenderloin & Swedish Meatball Roti with Potato Puree ($19) was flavorful, but I thought the meatball might have been slightly undercooked. Very good flavors though. \n\n- Wild Pacific Salmon with ratatouille & tomato cream sauce ($20) was perfectly cooked and quite delicious. \n\n- Fresh Cream Panna Cotta topped with lemon curd & streusel ($6) - OK panna cotta is one of my obsessions and it's also a great test of a chef. So I have to go into a bit of detail here:\n\nA good panna cotta should hold it's form on the plate, but when you put it in the spoon it should start to collapse, and when it's in your mouth it should turn into thick cream: there should be no trace of rubberiness or, god forbid, chewiness. This means that the chef has to measure his gelatin perfectly -- too little and the panna cotta will not stand up -- too much and it will become rubbery. \n\nWhen I saw that this panna cotta was served in a glass I thought two things: \n\n1) Aha, he's cheating! No need to put in a lot of gelatin because it doesn't have to stand up on a plate. \n\n2) At least it will be really creamy, since he doesn't need put in a lot of gelatin to make it stand up on a plate.\n\nUnfortunately, it still had too much gelatin and was rubbery rather than creamy. Why? I can't understand why?!\n\n- Coffee Semifreddo ($6): OK again, what is a semifreddo? It's not ice cream, it's thicker and has a different texture, like a frozen mousse. In Italy, it's generally served as a slice about 1/2\" thick on a plate. It doesn't melt quickly because it has less water content. \n\nThis dessert is just ice cream. It's good ice cream, but why call it a 'semifreddo' if you're not going to actually make a semifreddo? \n\nTo sum things up, I think the prices are very reasonable, the attempt is being made to produce high quality food, but it fell short too often for me to give more than 3 stars. Perhaps it's unfair because if my expectations hadn't been raised so high, I'd probably give 4 stars.

The server came over and told us they didn't have change and that they would have to owe her the money (wait, what? how is that even possible?) We told her we only needed $4 change and the rest would be tip. The server responded that it was too busy to go get change and told us to figure it out on our own. After waiting another 15 minutes thinking she'd come back she never did and we decided our time was more important than the $4 - we had been there for almost 3 hours at this point. Sure, they were busy and it was quite easy to hear someone in the kitchen yelling at the staff nearly the entire time so I can understand why she was stressed.

Sloppy Joes quite good, and the bread didn't get soggy.  They must have used a stick of butter for the puff pastry filled with mushrooms.  The soup was quite good, very filling.  And, when they found out that I wasn't eating meat, but didn't like mushrooms, they made me a very good vegetable crepe.  Oh, and the cinnamon ice cream, wow!\n\nAmbiance: Much quieter than most with quiet music in the background: Steely Dan, Keb Mo, ....\n\nMore than anything, The Richmond stands out because of their attention to details: Table already set, coffee was brought in a pot that was left at the table, special vegetarian crepe prepared, chef visited the table.\n\nTotal with a $37 bottle of wine and tip: $126 for two.\n\nI would definitely recommend, not overly romantic but appropriate.

It is surely the most delicious food I have had. \n\nMy boyfriend took me here for our anniversary. It was the first time we had tried the place, so it was a bit of a risk, but it ended up being amazing. He made a reservation; we were an hour late, but they had no problem. It turns out they hold the table all night, and I don't think they even charge a fee for it!  It is pretty dressy (like, cocktail-dress level), and they have linen tableclothes and all that, which I like. But it's small, so it's still intimate. And we got to eat by the window, in a little nook. \n\nWe started out with wine. They didn't have the wine I like by the glass, only by the bottle, but the waiter was very nice to bring me a taste of what I wanted to try, and then I ordered that. \n\nThen we ordered the goat cheese, beet, and cardamom salad. Literally one of the best salads I have ever had. The salad also came with a warm triangle of phyllo dough stuffed with goat cheese. AMAZING! \n\nThen I had the pan fried chicken, substituting mashed potatoes for the scalloped ones. The waiter was really nice about explaining all the dishes, and about substitutions. I hate when stuffy places don't allow substitutions. You just know they are pretentious and think they know more about what pleases the palate than the person eating it does. Food is subjective. It kind of makes me think they make it beforehand instead of making it to order. Anyway, the chicken was seasoned perfectly. And I am a serious chicken lover, so I've had it almost everywhere. It was so good, even the next day, when I ate my leftovers. The other awesome thing about the restaurant is that the entrees were actually big enough to fill us up, not tiny, as some higher-end restaurants' plates are. And the prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity.\n\nFinally, I have to applaud the service. They did take a little while to fill our water glasses, but I drink water faster than most people, so I don't blame them. But they were very attentive and understanding. They were okay with explaining anything, and didn't make us feel dumb for not knowing. Also, when we started getting warm, they were quick to open up the windows for us. And even though we were the last ones out, they didn't hurry us at all. \n\nTheir menu changes seasonally, so I would suggest you hurry on over to try what they have now.

The staff consists of the owners (hubby as the chef and wife as the hostess) and an extremely friendly server.    A great added touch is that the chef acts as a co-server as away to introduce himself.\n\nThe menu is limited (about 6 main entrees that gets switched up every so often) but when you still have a hard time deciding what to order because everything sounds so darn good, then it's not a problem!

I called around 3pm that day and was psyched to hear they had one rezzie left that evening for 9:30.  Perfect for us!  I'd heard this place was exquisite from various people who had eaten here years ago, so I was pretty excited to finally try it out.  Plus, I love supporting my neighborhood restaurants.\n\nWe had a lovely table near the door, but thoughtfully arranged velvet curtains protected us from any door drafts.  We ordered a few rounds of appetizers (crab cakes, sweetbreads and the potato leek soup) and some wine.  All was well.  My tummy was ready for this. So ready! \n\nThe food arrived in a very timely manner, but really lacked anything special.  The sweetbreads were difficult to taste under all the pepper (way too much pepper) and coating, and they weren't very crispy as their description stated.  I love sweetbreads (who doesn't love the tender thymus?!), but these were quite....meh.  The crab cakes were ok, as was the soup, but again nothing really stood out in the dishes that made them special or memorable. They just tasted like dishes I could have had at any restaurant.  And I'm not sure what all the hype is with the bread and spreads. It was just....bread. Maybe I've become a bread snob since I rarely eat bread anymore.  Just tasted like average bread.\n\nSo I was hoping for bigger things with our entrees.  I had the burger, bf had the salmon.  Maybe this is my fault for ordering a burger at a nice restaurant, I dunno.  When I ordered it, I wasn't asked how I wanted it prepared.  I let that slide since I trust a good restaurant to know how to prepare it.  But when it came out, the middle of my patty was SUPER raw.  Like, sticky-moist-ground-beef-fresh-from-the-butcher-paper raw.  I kept double checking it as I picked at it with my fork, thinking maybe the lighting was making it look redder and more raw than it actually was.  Our server saw my distress and came over to ask if everything was to our liking.  I pointed out my raw burger and she said \"Yeah, our burgers are cooked to medium rare.\"  This looked a little more raw than medium rare, and maybe some people like challenging their intestinal fortitude with burgers this rare, but after multiple bouts with e.coli poisoning in my lifetime, I don't roll the dice on ground beef and prefer it mostly cooked.  So I asked if she could throw it back on the grill for a medium-well finish, which she happily did.  But when my burger returned for round two, I picked it apart again and found it just as raw as round one! Surely the lighting was playing tricks on me (you know how restaurants dim the lights and cast a red tint to it to make everything more appetizing? I thought that was happening here).  My bf took out his iphone and we hit the flashlight app to really get a good look.  But seriously, the meat still looked so raw that I just wanted to be done with it.  I asked the server to just box it up (at this point, I'd rather just cook it at home myself).\n\nAfter returning home, I opened the box up under our revealing white kitchen lights to make sure I wasn't overreacting.  Sure enough, I wasn't. RAW. REALLY raw. \n\nExcept for the burger incident, the food wasn't bad (I would have given it  three stars were it not for the raw patty).  It was just really underwhelming for \"finer dining.\"   Maybe we came on an off-night or something. But I'm not inclined to return since there are tons of wonderful options in the area. .", "author": "Summer E."}

Parking was slightly challenging so when I came running in while by boyfriend parked, the chef-owner poured me a glass of wine to 'take the edge off.' Much appreciated. They did not care that we were a few minutes late because this restaurant only seats each table once/night--not in a pretentious way, but because they don't want to rush you. I really enjoyed that courses were served slowly. I love going out for dinner and sitting a few hours without feeling rushed. We ordered asparagus with Caesar, croutons, shaved parmesan, toasted capers and prociutto; the short rib & diver scallop over polenta (YUM); corn and brioche pudding (AMAZING) and duck (perfectly cooked in a port sauce that tasted like mole). The wine was tasty and oh so reasonably priced. The chef took so much pride in his food and was gracious to every person in the restaurant, which created an overall sense of gratitude from all parties in the restaurant.

The wine selection is fantastic, and the prices for a bottle are surprisingly low. My date and I went with the Firehouse Red, which I would highly recommend. Apparently one of the house favorites.\n\nYou're started off with a complimentary amuse-bouche of deviled eggs. You are also given fresh bread with an assortment of butter-- salted, blueberry, and parsley infused butters.\n\nI ordered the bone in pork chop with potato puree and fresh veggies. My date ordered the steak with a brie cheese crepe. We also tried the crab cake salad as an appetizer. The salad was great, with a somewhat mexican flair to it. An avocado puree with a salsa-like salad on top of a very fresh crab cake-- yum! I enjoyed my bone in pork chop, and almost thought I wasn't going to be able to finish it as it was such a large cut of meat. But I did. My date didn't so much enjoy his steak, as he said it was quite rubbery, but he enjoyed the restaurant very much and noted that he might have just ordered the steak on an off night.\n\nThe staff was extremely friendly, and personable. Our waitress was quite entertaining, and fun to talk to. Service was incredible. We never had to pour our own wine, or worry about having too many empty plates on our table.

However it turned out to be a delight. It was great to be able to catch up and hear one another, and my gluten allergy was elegantly accommodated.

The five-course prix fixe menu here is a steal at $49.95.   You certainly won't leave hungry- the portions are generous, and when you throw in the amuse bouches,  fuhgeddabout it.

So if you love beets, you might want to think twice about ordering.  If you hate beets--you'll probaly love this salad.\n\nSalmon:  disappointment.  First of all, the sauce-rainbow-o-colors have got to go.  Secondly, the salmon was bland bland bland.  As were the lentils.  A very boring dish that made me wish there was more salted butter for the bread.\n\nLamb chops:  a bit gamey.  Not overwhelming, but definitely gamey.  Veggies were very good, potatoes with chive were alright.  Did I mention that the Lamb chops were wee gamey?", "author": "Nobody M."}

On our walk over, my boyfriend even said, \"Hey, if we like this place, it can be our new go-to place to celebrate!\"  I liked the cozy setting, but we were kept waiting for what seemed like forever to order wine and food.  Our reservation was for 8:15, and it wasn't until nearly 9 that we got our amuse bouche.  I had to ask for bread because I was so starving by that time.  It definitely seemed like the restaurant was understaffed, as any request took forever to get any follow up.  \nIt took a while for our appetizers to come out, and both were just luke warm when they did.  I wonder if they had been ready for a while, but sat because the staff was too busy to bring them.  At that point I was too hungry to sit any longer and wait, so I didn't send them back.  We ordered the crab cakes and the oxtail.  The crab cakes were the highlight of the evening--great texture and taste!  I wish they and the sauce it sat in had been hotter.  I was disappointed by the oxtail, as the scallop was overdone and the oxtail was underwhelming (and nearly cold).  For our entree, my boyfriend had the bacon wrapped steak.  He said it was ok, but nothing spectacular.  I got a meat dish as well (I apologize, the name escapes me!  It came highly recommended by the waiter).  I got half way through it before starting to feel sick to my stomach, so we packed everything up and left.\nAS A DISCLAIMER--I really wanted to like this place, and it seems like a lot of other people had a good time.  I would hope to have a better experience another time, but honestly it was so disappointing that I can't see it being worth my time or money to try it again.  The Good:  cozy atmosphere, reasonable wine prices, friendly staff.\nThe Bad:  extremely long wait time, cold food, underwhelming flavors.   While I appreciate the good, I just can't reconcile it with waiting a very long time for luke-warm food that doesn't taste that great.", "author": "Annika M."}

His requests: something different, new (not the same old Italian, Chinese or Mexican place) and that wouldn't break the bank, because although it was his birthday, he was taking 5 of us out for dinner. \n\nThe Richmond was perfect! I called ahead of time and talked to the host about pre-ordering and paying for a bottle of wine to be set on the table for when we arrived. He was extremely accommodating, asking me what my dad liked in wine, food, etc. I settled on a bottle: 2007 Patricia Green Cellars from Willamette Valley (we ended up getting 2 we enjoyed it so much!)\n\nThe ambiance is great inside, its small but still functional, no one is on top of each other, and we had a nice little alcove section to ourselves.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-30", "description": "My friend Richmond and I had ran the San Francisco Full Marathon a few days before we ate here with a group of friends. We were both 26 years-old, running 26.2 miles, on the 26th of July - weird, right? Why do I bring this up? Well, he decided to keep this triple-theme going by having his birthday dinner here. Yes, that's right: Richmond's birthday dinner at The Richmond in the Richmond District. I suppose when you turn the incredibly old age of 27, you try to come up with stuff like that to make things more exciting. I wouldn't know about that though - I'm staying 26 FOR-EH-VER. (c)Squints in The Sandlot.\n\nWe had a table for eight reserved at 7:00pm and called to let them know we'd be about 30 minutes late. They gave us no trouble and even bragged that they were saving the best table in the house for us. They must've heard that my non-Yelp-Elite ass was coming over and that I was going to write one of my craptastic reviews. Or maybe they were just an incredibly cool staff. I was delighted to see it was the latter... or possibly both.\n\nThis restaurant is tiny. Their restroom is so small, you don't have any room to walk in it: you step in, you piss, flush (please do), do a 180, wash your hands (please, please do), do a 45, open the door, and walk out - it's so convenient! It's also very clean. *thumbs up* They have these little nooks where you can be seated and (what I think were red velvet?) drapes you can shut for an extra dose of privacy. Upon entrance, we were greeted warmly and were brought to the biggest nook of the place, and it was perfect for the eight of us.\n\n We started by looking at the wine list, which had about 8 - 10 choices of each type of white and red. We decided to go with the Woop Woop (yes, like Bub Rub and his whistle-tips) Cabernet and the Ramsey Pinot. Both weren't pricey at all and went great with our food.\n\nThey started out by bringing us crusty bread with three types of spread: olive butter, herb butter, and some type of cheese. They all tasted fine with the bread, and the waiters were quick to bring us more bread everytime we ran out. That was followed with samples of their potato-leak soup: it was so smooth, clean, and tasty. I might have to order that to start next time. A few of us shared the Foie Gras while others had the Heirloom Tomato Salad. No complaints on the appetizers here - it was all fresh and delicious.\n\nMost of us got the special of the night: a generous cut of Rib-Eye with a Toasted Brie Crepe with Potatoes and Onions. It was great - the crepe was a great compliment to the rib-eye. However, the only reason I can only give this place 4-stars is that my rib-eye was very rare when I ordered it medium-rare. The meat was quality nonetheless, and I enjoyed it a lot (that's what she said). During our meal, the chef greeted us and made sure everyone was satisfied.\n\nI had the coffee and had a bite of the Apple Tarte to end our meal. Not bad!\n\nMy friend Ralph brought me a bag of durian candy straight from his stay in Singapore, and I opened it to give everyone a piece - BAD IDEA. This stuff was foul and so much like real durian that it stunk up the place. Luckily we were the last party left. The chef was all smiles and even accepted a piece since he said his wife loved durian.\n\nThis place is definitely a gem - very intimate, great staff, decent prices, and good food all tucked in a very quiet part of the Richmond District. I'll definitely be back. Maybe I'll come back for my 26th birthday this year... or maybe my 26th birthday next year.", "author": "Len L."}

Loved the deep red velvet curtains.  They added just enough accent and separation for privacy between parties.  We had a table right in the front window, so plenty of space, yet confined enough for my husband and me.  We ordered the 5 Course Tasting Menu.  And it was absolutely beautiful.  I caught my husband several times eating with his eyes closed to better determine flavor as well as savor each bite.  Service was also amazing.  As my husband commented, Steven was just the right amount of attentive.  He was helpful and knowledgeable and we sure did appreciate him.  We were also never left with empty dishes long at all.  The whole meal flowed beautifully.  They even added a small candle to the corner of our dessert dishes for our Anniversary.  The small things really do make a difference.

We arrived for our 7 p.m. reservation, only to find that due to a computer glitch, it had been canceled. At first, we thought all hope was lost, but the chef and staff - who were very apologetic - rallied and made it work. They sat us at the bar with a gratis bottle of champagne for our trouble. 15 - 20 minutes after our original reservation time, we were seated at a table.

The salmon was perfectly cooked, the foie gras a decadent treat, and the panna cotta for dessert was light and not overly sweet.

Nice little bar, nice decor - though hubby did have a 'distance' issue with a piece of 3D art that was hanging right over our table.  Way too close to have tree branches sticking out of the canvas...\n\nAnyway... onto the food.  Started off with a \"sloppy joe\" style flat bread.  Surprisingly delicious - but how can you go wrong with something topped with Italian sausage?   Hubby had a yummy salad with a vinaigrette (he's so good).  \n\nEntrees, I had the short ribs.  Wonderfully fork tender, over a mashed potatoes and greens.  Hubby had ravioli with sauteed chicken.  Mine was better (heh, heh).\n\nNo room for dessert.  Very friendly service.  Our waiter was on it - always checking in on us.  Dishes were cleared almost immediately - but not in a rush to get you out.\n\nA very nice evening.  We'll be back.", "author": "Denise M."}

The Richmond is more than good, it was great!  We opted for the 5 course tasting menu: Roasted Beets & Cardamom Carrot Salad, then Crispy Crab Sweetbreads, Braised Wild Pacific Seabass in a White Wine Tomato Sauce,  then a leek soup, and finally Seared Rib Eye Stuffed with Mushroom Duxelle.  The food was paired very nicely with 3 local small local wines.  Of course the chef gave us a lemon sorbetto to cleanse the palette prior to coffee semi-freddo dessert which was paired with a really smooth grappa. Everything was excellent. I told Chef John that we appreciated his food not being overly seasoned and we were just pleasantly surprised by the affordable food with wine.\n\nSo, if you want high quality, upper end dinner,  without the upper end price, go here. It's a bargain! What I mentioned above is a $74 per person without tip. That's $50 for the tasting menu, plus $24 for the wine pairing.", "author": "Al G."}

We had the potato leek soup and foie gras to start, they both were excellent. One of the best foie gras I've ever had (and I've eaten a lot of them.) The potato leek soup was nice and tasty too. For entrees we had the skirt steak and pork chop. I'm normally not a fan of pork chops but they've taken it to another level. It was tender and juicy in every bite, I think I would only eat pork chops here :) Our server was very friendly and courteous too, we told her we were in a hurry and she managed to serve everything in a timely manner.

That's one big reason why this place only gets three stars. If I'm paying about $200 for a family of four for dinner, I expect my food to be cooked properly, which this wasn't. In addition, I wasn't a huge fan of the spice rub or marinade they put on it. It was tender, but it wasn't what I expected or ordered. If you want to order it, make sure you order it medium if you normally get it medium-rare and ask the waiter what the steak is seasoned with.\n\nAnother reason why this place gets three stars is because of the service. Our waiter was extremely polite and was more than willing to offer his suggestions, but the overall service was ridiculously slow. After we were seated, it took about 20 minutes to get our bread, 45 minutes to get our starters, and an hour-and-a-half to get our entrees. All in all, we were probably there for close to 3 hours.\n\nFinally, a minor gripe about the wine -- it should have been decanted. There was quite a bit of sedament in the bottle and in our glasses ... not very good.\n\nTo be honest, this place was on the border of two stars. But with how great the Apple Cider, the bread with the compound butters, the \"Sloppy Joe\" starter, the Chicken Ravioli, and the Chocolate-Peanut Butter cake were, I can't justify a two-star rating. \n\nThis place is good if you know what's good.

As anyone who has planned a wedding reception can attest, if you don't have 200 people, a lot of money and a love for undercooked salmon there aren't a lot of options out there. If I could have imagined the ideal place for my wedding reception, it would have been the Richmond. When my husband and I went for our first meeting, he was totally sold and said \"its perfect\" and I said \"I know!!!\" John is really wonderful and has such passion about what he does. We and our friends are really into food and wine, and my husband and I just wanted to have an intimate \"dinner party\" with good food and wine where we didn't have to do the dishes.  \n\nJohn was very flexible and accommodating and customized the menu and the evening just as we wanted it. We had a blast at the tasting and were very impressed with the food.  From the moment we arrived to set up the flowers in the afternoon until the moment we left in the wee hours (sorry John!) everything went smoothly. It was like being in our own home. The staff was so friendly and helpful. The pacing of the meal, wine selection and the food itself was top-notch!\n\nThis is a true hidden gem. To have a meal, let alone a private reception, of that caliber and service without spending a fortune in SAN FRANCISCO is unheard of! And frankly, even if we did spend a fortune, I doubt we would have had the service and fun that we did with John and his staff or as tasty and elegant a meal.\n\nOur friends and family report it was the most fun they ever had at a wedding reception and the BEST FOOD they ever had a wedding reception for sure!\n\nBraised Short Ribs, Crab Cakes and Beet Salad are standouts!\n\nThanks to John and his staff for making our night so very special.

Because of the ban on foie gras is looming we ordered 3 orders of the seared foie grad as an appetizer and they were all delicious. And at only $16.50 a pop it was beyond worth it! They served bread with 3 types of delicious butters and an amuse boush  before the appetizers. One nontr though, the crab cake was very spicy. Luckily the Man who ordered it loves spicy but had I ordered it it would have been too much. We had the cod, the salmon and the fried chicken. All were really amazingly delicious but the fried chicken was unanimously the favorite. It was done perfectly. We ended the evening with the warm chocolate and peanut butter dessert which was great. \nNow a note on the staff and atmosphere. All are very unassuming, but kind, knowledgeable and go above and beyond. 15 minutes after arriving the power went out on the whole block. They handled the situation with grace and, because of gas burners, were able to get food out still. The chef came out to assure that he was still cooking and that service wouldn't be stopped. The lights came back before the main course and it all made for a fun experience. We were also the last to leave, per usual with my family, and they didn't mind at all. It took some time to get a cab out there so they just chatted with us while we shared some drinks and waited. It was the most surprisingly pleasant experience we've had in the city. 5 stars all around!", "author": "Avery H."}

I always love it when the chef/owner comes out to introduce himself/herself and to talk about his/her passion for cooking.  It really adds a great touch to the whole dining experience.\n\nI honestly think this restaurant can be better.  They are a little slow on the service.  The seating capacity is probably around 40 and they only have one waitress and one busboy. The food is a little dated and they can definitely use a face lift on the menu. Overall, it was still good. The ambiance is very quaint.  They have a lot of draperies around the whole restaurant and they do have candlelighting on their tables.  They also have a wine room.  The bathroom is coed and is not handicap accessible. \n\nThis is what we had.\n\nWe decided to make our own 3 course meal.  We split the burger and fried soft shell crab for appetizers.  My buddy had the pork chops with macaroni and cheese and I had the arctic char with rice a roni.\n\nThe burger.............the best 9 dollar burger I ever had.  They have their own home made ketchup. dijon mustard, aioli, and hot sauce.\n\nThe soft shell crab and salad was awesome.  I just love the freshness of everything.  A little over seasoned.  (side note...........they don't have salt and pepper shakers on their tables.  A little pretentious but all the food really didn't need any reseasoning.)\n\nThe pork tenderloin and macaroni and cheese.  The pork was very tender.  I really didn't like the macaroni.  They could've done it with mash potatoes instead.\n\nThe arctic char was cooked to perfection.  They used a medley of brocollini, carrots, and string beans.  I always love a restaurant when they use brocollinis. \n\nThe whole dining experience will last around 1 1/2 hour.  The total cost for this meal was 66.00.  What a deal!!!  They had this one dessert on their menu that we wanted to try but it took 15 minutes to make.  I think the waitress should've told us this when we ordered our entrees.

They were:\n\n1.) Sports playing on the TV. If your companions are willing to sit at the bar up front you can watch football.\n\n2.) Trumer and Prohibition Ale on tap.\n\n3.) An awesome burger on the menu. Moist premium beef & cheese on a bun from Schubert's bakery, and some perfectly done shoestring fries. The ketchup is also made in house, and has notes of basil and dill; AK and I decided it was a little better than the ketchup at The Front Porch and that's saying something.\n\nThe Richmond does well as a wine bar, especially since you can eat burgers and drink beer and watch football there.", "author": "matthew r."}

The staff was extremely nice also.\n\nSince we weren't that hungry and we spent the night before (Halloween) binge drinking, we did not load up on the drinks and food.

The spreads were butter, an olive spread, and some other herb spread, but like I said, the bread was amazing! Light and crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. \n\nThey ALSO brought over this sweet fig/raspberry sauce/yogurt thing that was different and pretty yummy, but WHERE THE HELL DID IT COME FROM??? We hadn't ordered it, so we looked at each other and were like, \"ok.\"\n\nThen, they ALSO brought over two green salads for us. It was some sort of arugula blend with a sweet vinaigrette, but once again, where the hell did it come from??? When we finally gave the server a weird look saying \"we didn't order these\" she said they were all complimentary since the kitchen was a little behind on our entrees. Amazing!

The Richmond was exactly the double dose of civility and taste that Basi and I needed after the Mr. Toad's Wild Ride experience of Dia De Los Muertos at the De Young. \n\nSince I've been kind of a nightmare train wreck of a friend and significant other lately, I thought I'd treat my two favorite ho's to some cheap(ish) wine and tasty snacks. I was shocked to see many, many bottles on the wine list for less than $40. We shared a $29 bottle of Pinot and were extremely satisfied. I know my wine pretty well and this was definitely a great buy. \n\nOn to the food. I really have a problem with itsy bitsy portions served on enormous, cave-man sized plates. This is what happens at The Richmond. The food, though high in quality, is served in painfully sparse portions. The cheese plate was no more than 4 or so paper thin slices of manchego (served with an overly salty pecan butter), another light cheese with a delicious berry compote, and a generous pile of bleu cheese (nothing special) under some lightly dressed greens and roasted apples. This was $12 and would not have been satisfying for one person, let alone three. Basi and I are cheese fiends and I would not recommend ordering the cheese plate. We also got the beet and carrot phyllo dish, which was delicious but equally sparse and probably best for one person, especially if that one person really likes beets and has a hard time sharing :) \n\nThe real standouts were matthew capital r's burger and fries. I have never in my life enjoyed eating off of his plate more than I did last night. With every handful of fries that disappeared from his plate into my hand, I was getting closer and closer to God. The ketchup is house made and smacks of basil and dill. It is on par with Front Porch's ketchup and they were very generous with it. The housemade aiolis, mustard, and butters (parsley-chive, salted, and kalamata olive) are all divine and are clearly made with love. \n\nThere was only a short wait to belly up to the 4 person bar but they recommend reservations for any night, as the space is teeny-tiny.

I went there with some friends after a happy hour at the De Young Museum on a Friday night, it's about three blocks away, which is pretty cool and convenient.\n\nThe Richmond is definitely redefining neighborhood cooking, and the clientele - typically in their 30-50s - tends to be a regular and appreciative crowd. The organic Californian menu changes enough to keep things interesting but you can rest assured you'll always get something delicious. An indication of the attention to ingredients comes with the bread plate, which comes with three different types of butter to taste. One item that is a consistent fixture is their half pound cheeseburger hamburger and fries, which, as with all good bistros, is done to perfection. \n\nThe service is great, if a little casual, and on our visit the owner/chef lingered around our table to explain some of the dishes we were having. A well thought out wine list complete the overall experience.\n\nI'd recommend The Richmond for a quiet dinner with friends, or perhaps an intimate date. In either case, any foodie in your party will be duly impressed and will surely marvel at the idea of finding such a culinary experience seemingly in the middle of nowhere.", "author": "Nish N."}

Sure, perhaps a visit or two to Rainbow Grocery... or those artsy shops in the Mission/Hayes Valley... but on a regular basis, dining at most places in the city is usually an anonymous experience- sometimes you get to meet the chef, sure, but the chef isn't always the owner- the owners are sometimes a group of investors with deep pockets.... here, it's an elegant family-run neighborhood restaurant that deserves a try- perfect for a romantic dinner for two, or a night out with friends. \r\n\r\nAs the other reviewers have mentioned, the Chef John made it a point to visit and chat with the tables (and it's been 15 months since they opened..) He made sure everything went well (our dining experience was wonderful) and he even entertained our curiosity about parallels to real-life cooking and 'hell's kitchen', the tv show... (now that's a nice guy!) \r\n\r\nThe restaurant supports sustainable organic and LOCAL farming and gets its produce from five small Californian farms- and it shows! The menu is seasonally changed based on the freshest ingredients available. \r\n\r\nOur table had the Halibut, Vegetarian Tofu dish (mm... not what you think, not 'flavorless' at all!), Chicken, and another Alaskan Fish that I can't remember... but it was all well-seasoned & beautifully presented!\r\nThe appetizer portions are just perfect, not too large so that you'll spoil your appetite for the main course... \r\n\r\nIt was difficult to choose from the dessert choices- I wanted to sample each of them... but we all shared the banana dessert (sadly, my memory fails me) topped with an ice cream that was just a few notches short of that of Joe's Ice Cream on Geary! \r\n\r\nTheir coffee is served in those wonderful french press pots, the tea in those beautiful cast iron teapots, and the china they use is simply gorgeous- Villeroy & Boch- my faay-vorite! (I was impressed as soon as I sat down, to be honest.) \r\n\r\nI think we even witnessed a marriage proposal.. Awwwww...... \r\n\r\nCheck it out! You won't regret it! \r\nTheir menu changes seasonally, so check out their website for an idea of their menu- but be aware that it might be a little different. \r\nOpentable.com!", "author": "M'ia K."}

It said elegant without being ostentatious.  We had great service all night, and the food was absolutely spectacular.  The bread was awesome.I did love the three butters, I love having options, I think most people do.  I could rave about many of the courses, the cheese course of Humboldt fog and rhubarb chutney, the perfectly cooked duck breast, and of course the seared Foie Gras with pain perdue The Foie was the best dish of the night, I would highly recommended this dish to any Foie Gras fanatic.

When we all arrived, we were ushered into a back area where it was more private.  Instead of one table for 10, two tables for 6 and 4 were made so that the server could get better access - however, dividing made it feel like two parties instead of one. We had to insist on joining the tables together. Insist meaning that the server would not do it, but the owner had to come out and explain to us how their service would be hindered. We thought it would be okay for the server to do a little reaching - after all, they are going to come over and reach maybe 8 times during the dinner at most, while we will be sitting as two parties for 2 hours?  [Strike 1]\n\nImmediately, we noticed that the menus were not the same as they were on-line; slightly disappointing because we were anticipating specific items. Oh well. The other asterisk was that if one wants the tasting menu, then the entire party MUST order the tasting menu no exceptions. Needless to say, not everyone wanted to eat the same thing, so that idea was out the window. [Strike 2] \n\nThe meal itself was good, but not spectacular nor particularly outstanding; it wasn't super expensive either.  To top it off, because they knew it was my birthday, they provided a candle, but no cake (not that we were expecting anything).  What was the candle put on? The bottom of a coffee cup.  I don't know if they had meant it to be a joke, but it sure was!  Not only that, but what is the COST of a slice of cake compared to the bill on a party of 10 (~$500), about 0.3%?  I don't get it, don't even bother - that move just screams \"CHEAP\". [Strike 3]", "author": "Alan Y."}

It was closed, but we glanced through the windows and were looking at the menu.  As we were looking, the door opens and John, the aforementioned owner and chef invited us in to take a look around.  We declined, but had a nice conversation about the restaurant, the food and the wine.  John was so nice to us even though the restaurant was closed and he was there just to work on the books.\r\n\r\nA few days later we decided to actually eat there.  Our expectations were bouyed by all of the glowing reviews here at Yelp, and we were not disappointed.\r\n\r\nFirst, we made a reservation via Open Table to get the points.  But we didn't need to on this Wednesday night.  We were the last people seated that night and they were very gracious.\r\n\r\nShortly after we ordered, our waiter brought out an amuse bouche for us.  A little sample of one of the main entrees.  Yummy.\r\n\r\nThen there was the bread.  Yes, there were three types of butter.  And yes, they were each unique and fantastic.  We loved the berry butter.  (Curious, you have to come and try it!)\r\n\r\nOur appetizers were delicious.  I had the soup and she had a salad.  The waiter thoughtfully gave us two soup spoons since we were planning on sharing.\r\n\r\nWe each ordered burgers and while a little thing, both were cooked exactly to our liking.  Sometimes a place will get lazy when you order two steaks or burgers cooked differently, and they both end up coming the same way.  No, not here.  \r\n\r\nAs we were enjoying our dinner, John came out and asked us how the food was.  Delicious!\r\n\r\nI saved room for dessert and it was probably the most pedestrian of the whole meal.  That's not to say it wasn't good becaues it was.  Compared to the rest of the meal though, it just seemed okay.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the whole experience was wonderful and it's great knowing that if we want to get dinner at a nice restaurant, that there's one nearby.", "author": "Ben C."}

We were certain this had to be amazing so we were stoked when we could finally make a reservation that would work. \n\nWe got in and the place is definitely small and hard to have a conversation at a normal voice without the acoustics lending it to an automatic and inadvertent eavesdrop session for everyone else. The bread was amazing, 3 types of butter and perfectly warm! We started with the foie gras which sat on some french toast. The foie gras was so rich and delicious that we both liked it better with the table bread and by itself. It needed something to counter the texture and a soppy piece of toast and syrup didn't pair as nicely as we thought. \n\nMy cousin got the pork chop with potato puree and I got the hanger steak. The pork chop was very nicely plated with a good portion size however upon cutting into it we realized that it was so fatty that half of the chop was fat. We both know that some fat is perfectly normal and almost necessary for a fine pork hop but there were heaping piles of it on the plate by the time we were done with it and it was kind of gross. The hanger steak was ordered medium rare, however it arrived medium. Whatever was used to season the steak was entirely too salty, especially when arrived plated with a crispy brick filled with brie, potatoes and onions. It was a healthy portion that was already cut up for me which was nice however there was brine (which I was disappointed in finding) and the flavor disappointed me. We didn't order wine but we walked out of there with a $65 tab which I suppose could have been much worse.\n\nThe service was the saving grace besides the bread with a 2 person team (one handling the bar in addition to waiting tables) and their tact and attention for a small environment.\n\nOverall, I probably will stick to the downtown FiDi, SoMa areas for that price point and food fare.", "author": "Kristen R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-13", "description": "I had insanely high expectations upon visiting The Richmond for dinner last week. It's fairly normal to have a certain level of expectation for an upscale, American-style restaurant (that comes with high ratings) since there are so many to choose from in San Francisco. But due to a few key circumstances, it was going to take more than your average 4- to 5-star experience to impress me. The pressure was on.\n\nKey circumstance #1: It was my birthday. And if there's any one day out of the year to act like a princess and expect to be treated like a princess, this is it. And it's these years that I'd like to remember the most when I'm reading 'More' magazine and attending the Vagina Monologues on my birthday in thirty years.\n\nKey circumstance #2: The boy was taking me to dinner. Normally such high expectations would not be put upon him (clearly, I felt lucky to have such an amazing guy to take me out) although for this particular night I'd made a couple suggestions and was knocked down--twice--for his choice, so the \"yeah, this better be worth it\" phrase was dancing in the back of my head. If this seems bratty, please refer to the \"princess\" philosophy noted in key circumstance #1.\n\nKey circumstance #3: I had unwillingly been working from 8AM-7PM and was yearning for a relaxing, comforting and delicious, wine-inclusive experience. \n\nThe waiter sat us at a table for 2 near the window, and although we were in the \"main room\" (which only has about 4 or 5 small tables in total) we felt very secluded and private. The warm low-lit atmosphere was enhanced by frosted ceramic candle holders etched with scenes of Italy at each table (available at Macy's for 50 bucks each, or to steal from the tables at Aqua, according to the waiter.) Beautiful oil/mixed media scenes of Napa Valley vineyards hung from the walls. The crowd was a late 30s and 40s mix, looked like a bunch of old friends and dates catching up and enjoying food and wine on a casual Thursday evening. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of the Morgan 'Twelve Clones' Pinot Noir from Monterey (Santa Lucia Highlands), mostly because we liked the name and it was under 40 bones ($37). Besides the funny name, it was a great wine, served at the perfect temperature and went well with both our dishes.  Later we looked up the retail value and learned they only marked it up by $7, which was amazing that it wasn't listed as a $50 or $60 bottle, like any place could easily charge.\n\nFor starters, we shared the crab crepe over greens, and the \"Happy Boys Farms\" organic salad.  Crab was fresh and crepe was crispy; I probably could have eaten 8 more. Salad was extremely simple, although I'm not sure I would have added anything else. Wish they sold bottles of the light herby dressing the greens were mixed with. Although in my opinion, the best starter (and accompaniment to our meal) was free. The warm, crunchy french bread and variety of butter was a surprisingly delightful treat. Among the 3 kinds of buttery goodness was an olive tapenade, euro-style with sea salt, and chive and parsley (my fav) sampling. \n\nNext up, I ordered the hangar steak that came with red potatoes infused with goat cheese over greens. I asked for medium rare, and I got it. It was beef-tastic, and along with the cheesy potatoes, rich and flavorful. Portion size was surprisingly substantial, I gave the boy almost half and was still quite full. The boy got the crispy cod with beans and I think it came with rice. To be honest, I was so obsessed with my dish I can't recall the full details of his--I had a couple bites but it wasn't enough to distract me enough from my dish, or ask for more.\n\nAt dessert time, it was a toss up between the panna cotta and a warm, gooey chocolate and peanut butter brownie cake thing served with creamy vanilla ice cream. We went with the latter, and it was a good choice. For my birthday, the waiter came out and melted the bottom tip of the candle and stuck to the side of the plate. I'd never seen this done before, and thanked him (not only for the candle but not sticking that piece of wax in my sweet dish, god forbid I mistake candlewax for the flavor of the chocolate).\n\nDespite all the circumstances, and my judgmental, uncompromising attitude, this place blew me away, I would have given it 6 stars if I could, as the atmosphere, service, food, and price (I'm sure you can have a similar experience in excellence at an establishment that will cost you twice as much). On the downside, I think my meal ruined my ability to enjoy good steak anywhere else for a least a couple months.", "author": "Kelly R."}

Small, pungent, hearty, and alive.  The Maine scallops, though small, were sweet and seared to perfection - the middle was still raw (perfect).

Had that upscale soul food joint like the old Powell's in Hayes valley - hardwood floors, dull and generic colorful paintings, and high ceilings.  Great place for good friends or a romantic date.  No loud music, patrons dined courteously, and it did seem very exclusive.  The flatware was superb, cloth napkins were nice, and eye-pleasing professional glassware were charming.  \n\nDessert was cheesecake with a raspberry puddle.  It was good, light, and sold as home-made.  It was good.  The coffee was fantastic.   Hot and generous as they left a handsome silver coffee pitcher on the table - YOU get to control the coffee.  NICE TOUCH.\n\nThe owners and servers were all very warm and caring.  Most patrons looked like they've been here before or are actually regulars, as they were on first named basis with the owner.  At one point, I saw the owner (in his chef attire) sit down and share a glass of wine.\n\nThis place is definitely worth another look.  If the service was more attentive and the food actually warm, it'd run a 4.5 star, hands down.  But let's keep it real.", "author": "Isaac L."}

It's not fancy shmancy like downtown places, the restaurant is small, and parking is minimal. But really those are the only things to complain about. \n\nTheir food is top notch and sophisticated. Chef/owner John Owyang does a great job of keeping it simple, while delivering high quality gourmet experiences. Their menu is diverse for carnivores and vegetarians alike. You must absolutely get the whiskey braised oxtail with seared diver scallop over polenta appetizer. You heard me correctly... all that yummy goodness was offered in an appetizer for only $9.95. That brings me to my second point... their prices are amazing. You get huge portions for VERY GOOD PRICES. Their wine selection is pretty amazing for such a small restaurant and there are a couple really good values in there (I'm not telling which ones). To top it all off, the chef personally came to our table and spoke with us for several minutes about the menu, his philosophy, and cooking techniques. \n\nThe Richmond... what a place!!!

I had the crab crepe to start - I didn't really like it because it had potatoes in it even though it didn't say in the description.  My entree was the pork loin, my friend had fish.  The loin was solid but not amazing, same with the fish.  The wine list looked pretty good but by the glass selections were a little wanting.  The decor could use some work (FYI., the waiter said they had just finished a major remodeling and were still finishing up) and the tables were a little cramped.  \n\nOverall, I rate this as a good but not outstanding restaurant.

The food and service blew me away- all in a wonderfully intimate setting.\n\nThe Richmond was a suggestion at the Fun Committee meeting at work.  We met to begin preparation for our Staff Appreciation Luncheon for 45 people.  I called and spoke directly with the chef and owner, John Owyang.  He was very courteous and to my pleasant surprise, he offered a tasting.  What a nice change from working with restaurants that hardly give a shit about your business.  ahem:::Magic Flute:::ahem\n\nThe tasting was AMAZING.  In chronological order:\n\n-amuse bush of creamy potato leek soup- everything you love about it.\n-cesar salad- standard and always delicious.\n-bread with three types of butter: chive, sea salt, olive- so warm and fresh!\n-white wine (I seriously can't remember the types of wine we sampled...sorry!)\n-yellow split pea with bacon crumbles- so creamy that it makes my mouth water at this very moment.\n-braised oxtail and scallop on creamy polenta- Incredible!  If I had a last meal, this would be present.\n-white wine\n-seared yellowtail with oyster mushrooms- very fresh and perfectly seasoned.\n-red wine\n-seared hanger steak on phyllo dough filled with brie and pancetta- seasoned well and a huge portion.\n-chocolate marquise- if you love chocolate, you will love this!\n-fresh cream panna cotta- smooth and creamy with a touch of lemon tartness.\n\nI have to mention that between each course, the staff reset all of our silverware and removed all the crumbs from the table- such great service!  On that note, The Richmond is only open for dinner but exclusively for our party, John Owyang opened for lunch.  I also have to admit that I missed some entrees from the tasting- it was a lot of food!  Let's just say that I remembered the great ones! \n\nI have been here about 5 times and it always impresses me.  The food is always comforting and the service is extraordinary.\n\nP.S. Parking is a little tough, so I would suggest taking a cab or the bus.  Also, for a large party, I would say that it would only fit about 38-40 in the main dining room.

It's nice to see there were families there as well - added rather than detracted from the ambiance (&I hate kids).  It managed to balance friendly/neighborhood & intimate. \n\nI would qualify the food as very good, but not mind blowing.  highlights included the potato leek soup w/ a truffle oil garnish, the ravioli sauce (salsa?), and the panna cotta.  The wine list was great as well and they clearly take care of their bottles.\n\nI appreciate the in house nature of the dishes.  I had the chicken & mashed potatoes, which was literally swimming in gravy - not my favorite way to eat.  The potatoes were good & mushrooms had wonderful flavor.  The chicken was tender enough to fall apart & flavor was kept in with the skin remaining.  The bacon wrapping was unfortunately soggy, probably due to the abundance of gravy/sauce.  If I have something bacon wrapped, I like the bacon to be slightly crisp.\nBF had mushroom/sausage ravioli which had a suprising kick in the sauce or filling (I couldn't tell from one bite).  Nothing major, but I am glad I didn't get it as I planned; I am not a fan of heat in my food.  The ravioli filling was nice, the ravioli seemed a little too al dente for my taste.  BF finished it all off though.\nCoffee was amazing!  Rich & dark - mmm.  Dessert was delectable.\n\nOverall a very good experience & I'd return to try some of the other fare, but I would be sure to ask questions about the preparation etc.\nOne other nick - the online menu is not up to date & I was really looking forward to foie gras! :(  For others culinarily inclined, sweetbreads seem to be the foodie replacement on the apps.", "author": "laura g."}

The restaurant is super cute and romantic but the service and some of the food were not so great.  We made a reservation though it was completely unnecssary since the place was empty the whole time we were there.  I think this worked as a disadvantage for us because we were being eyed the whole meal by the chef.  He seated us.  Then he came by when bread was put on the table by our server to ask, \"You guys have been here before, right?\"  We hadn't and we told our server that when he asked us 5 minutes earlier.  The chef brought out a complimentary amuse bouche which was a little odd tasting (fig and cream cheese) but nice because it was free.  The whole time the boy and I are talking and trying to enjoy the evening, the chef was standing there, looking at us.  So uncomfortable. \n\nI got the seared tuna.  It was ok but nothing special and I didn't care much for the super heavy cream sauce all over it.  The chef came by to ask how everything was.  We told him it was all great and he walked away.  I ate half of my dish since I was full from the appetizers and wanted to take the rest home.  The chef came by again to ask if I was SURE I liked everything as he nodded over to my half full plate.  Seriously, there's attentive service and there's overbearing slightly creepy service.  This was creepy.  \n\nI felt kind of bad for our server because a)  he was actually very pleasant, knowledgeable and just the right amount of attentive and b) we were his only table for at least 2 hours.

The chef was kind enough to send 3-4 appetizer plates for us so we weren't starving which was perfectly fine by us. A nice leisurely meal with good friends is never a bad thing.  We had the following appetizers: whisky braised oxtail with Maine diver scallop, Sloppy Joe's, salad with pear vinegarette dressing and carpaccio.  Oh, we ate several plates of their warm crispy French bread with flavored spreads - tapenade, pesto butter and salted butter.  I had their rib eye steak special.

They had 2 other seating areas that can be fully covered by the curtains for privacy.  \n\nOne odd thing was they kept putting the food on the main table (they split us in a table of 6 and 4).

First off, parking in this neighborhood is terrible.  Since I live so close, I could walk, but luckily for Hue L. and our non-yelper friend, they didn't have to look for parking and just parked in my driveway.  Our reservations were for 8pm, but we had to wait maybe 15 minutes by the tiny bar.  Apparently, there was a birthday party that night that was taking up 3 tables and there were 2 other tables that just wouldn't leave.  The owner did offer each of us a glass of wine (on the house) to compensate though.  The place is super tiny and poor Hue L. kept getting in the way of the waiters.  \n\nAs for the food, we started with the Seared Sonoma Fois Grois, which was good, although I think we actually liked the bread with the 3 different varieties of spreads better.  I don't remember what Hue L. or or our non-yelper friend had for their entree, but I had the Whisky Braised Oxtail with Maine Diver Scallops.  The oxtail was very tender and I really love scallops so I had no complaints about that.  We all split the chocolate cake for dessert.  The menu says it needs 20 minutes to make, but I don't remember having to wait so long.\n\nThe entire dinner took a couple hours and I could see how the place can get busy, but one of the waiters told us that they're planning on expanding their space in the near future.

Intimate ambiance, simple decor, and great food.\n\nDespite making the rounds from Geary to Balboa in search of a walkable parking spot, the Richmond is the perfect  place for a quiet, weekday dinner. Went with a couple girlfriends for a birthday and had the following:\n\nBraised Short Ribs with Potato and Celery Root Puree- good size portion(slightly on the fatty side for me) but still slipped right of the bone\n\nHangar Steak with Crepe- Seasoned well, not so sure about the crepe though. Seemed more like a glorified, french inspired eggroll\n\nChocolate Torte- Everyone does a chocolate souffle/cake/tart dessert served with ice cream/gelato/whipped cream. What make the Richmond's exceptional is that salty peanut butter surprise inside. Who knew a little Jif could do the trick?\n\nOverall, attentive service, clean flavors, and local ingredients. Great place to take your parents or a second date. Make sure to turn the Parking Karma or better yet cab it.", "author": "Rachelli M."}

The service was a little slow and uneven, but the food was very good to excellent. We had the seared foie gras (a moderate portion at $16, should have come with more toast), a salad, and two portions of arctic char. Arctic char is a rarely seen salmon-like freshwater trout and I was excited to find it in SF. It was prepared with a seared crust and soft, juicy flesh - not overcooked. Based on this one sample I'd tentatively say the chef knows how to cook fish, which is a rarity.\n\nThe wine list is large for such a small place (30-40 seats) and there is a wide selection of inexpensive under $30 bottles.\n\nThe bread came out slowly (at least 10 minutes) although the salad and foie gras followed relatively quickly thereafter.\n\nThe presentation of the foie gras and our entrees was awkward - the foie gras came on a large clear plate that was actually a little hard to see (where do I put my fork?). Not sure what the idea there is. The fish was served with no veg or starch and was a little difficult to eat - it was moist and slippery and kind of hard to get a fork on at times. It would have been nice to have pilaf or a higher rim on a smaller plate to push the meat against.\n\nGordon Ramsay would appreciate the small menu - roughly a half dozen starters and a half dozen entrees. I suspect that the restaurant may be regularly understaffed. However, with relatively simple dishes it might be slow on a busy night but shouldn't become a complete meltdown.\n\nA final note - I understand that some people think it's nice to hear personally from the chef, but I don't. He served our appetizer and appeared a couple of other times in the dining area. I think that during service hours, the chef's time is usually best spent in the kitchen.\n\nAnyway - food, excellent. Service, good. Glitches to work out. We will go back and perhaps it could become a regular stop.", "author": "Joseph H."}

Our waitress was great, and although we basically only waited 1 minute for our table, they apologized and gave us some extra wine and appetizers \"complements of the chef.\"  The chef even came out later to check on everyone!

Windy, wet, musty - the perfect evening for a savory squash soup. \nBut I was grumpy and had nothing in the kitchen, and I didn't want to cook.  So what did I do?  I called every restaurant I could think that might have some kind of squash soup.  Firefly - nope potato chedder. Zazie - nope, tomato eggplant. Q Cafe - bluh - italian sausage.\nThen lo & behold, in a blind search on Yelp for what Firefly was labeled as - \"American (New)\" - what the hell does THAT mean? - I found a hit - The Richmond.  And they had a pumpkin puree soup with toasted pumpkin seeds. DING DING DING DING!!\nAnd it was perfect - rich, savory, sweet, hot, with crunchy texture contrast from the seeds.  The other menu offerings looked very promising too, though not super extensive - maybe 5-6 options for apps or entrees. American (New) looked a lot like old French, with a sprinkling of other influences.   \n'Course I had to be persnickety and decide the one thing I wanted to try was off their 5-course tasting menu. Not having worn stretchy pants, or wanting to spend $55 - I bugged the waiter to see if they'd let me order the sweetbread course a la carte.  Being a quiet night with the rain dropping outside - they were chill about it and served me up some perfectly seared pieces basted in a rich gravy & accompanied by wilted greens and a ravioli.  It. Was. Excellent.\nFunny how a good meal can just make a crappy evening totally disappear from mind. And the quiet neighborhood is so much more accessible than other heavier dine-out areas.

Upon entering, we were seated promptly, even though we were late for our reservation.  The area we were seated in was very cozy so it'd be nice for a date or a group of four.  Service was great, waiter was very attentive and paid attention to when we needed more time/privacy.\n\nMy sister and I shared the soft shell crab salad, which I really liked.  I had the halibut and my sister had the artic char.  My halibut was okay, I wished the outside was seared more for crispier texture and wished the inside wasn't cooked as much.  It wasn't moist/juicy enough.  The flavoring was also lacking, nothing stood out.  It was served with a 'rice-o-roni' type side and that was only ok, it really tasted like the rice-o-roni from the box.  Make this a risotto and we'd be in good business.  The arctic char was better, the sear on the outside was crispy and flavorful.  The mushrooms served with it was also tasty, although some were really salty.  We didn't order desert, so the verdict's still out on that.  We both ordered coke and it came in the glass bottle (old-fashioned kind).  It was cold and fizzy, just the way I like it.\n\nOverally, the food wasn't that impressive but the service and restaurant was very nice but I'm not sure if I'd recommend it or go back.", "author": "Winnie L."}

It has a casual, comfortable vibe and is relatively quiet, even when filled to capacity.\r\n\r\nThis is the sort of neighborhood restaurant you'd expect to find in Pacific Heights or maybe the grown-up end of the Marina.  The food is natural Franco-California/San Francisco cuisine:  starters typically include duck confit, blue cheese salad, foie gras, a soup and a few others; for the mains, a few fishes, several meats and the famous 1/2 pound burger.\r\n\r\nDinner started with an amuse bouche--a tiny salmon sandwich cookie.  I ordered an appetizer but my wife did not, so the restaurant split my \"Pan Seared Diver Sea Scallop & Whiskey Braised Ox Tail (on a bed of creamy polenta).\"  Splitting the dish seemed presumptuous but I believe the kitchen doubled it's size too--so certainly no complaints.  And it was sweet, delicious scallop.\r\n\r\nMy main was a tasty lamb stew with a lamb loin wrapped in crispy pastry, like a spring roll.  My wife enjoyed the burger, which was served with small crispy fries and included two types of ketchup--one made by the restaurant, one not.\r\n\r\nFor dessert, we split a cinnamon ice cream with a stick chewy date truffle.   Our dinner, with a glass of wine, was about $55.\r\n\r\nWe'll be back soon..\r\n\r\nOr so I've been told.

It wasn't that busy and the place doesn't hold many tables.  I think there are only about 8 tables in the place, and with three waiters, a front door lady/owner there really isn't an excuse for lost orders.  \n\nFood - the foie was nicely cooked but had an overall sweet taste.  The oysters were a little tougher than I thought they should be.  Grass-fed beef, i think, didn't have as much flavor as it could.  Very tender but when it's near purple/raw, what's not tender?  I asked for medium rare - no biggie.  I like raw things.  But I think it should have more pink than purple.  The yellow-tail had a wonderful flavor.  Possibly overly firm/about to be dry. It was close to being not good.  The panna cotta was flavorless on its own but went well with the lemon curd on top. I swear, I 've had panna cotta with flavor before.  \n\nIt's a little on the pricey side for this level of service and near misses.  They never forget my order at Outback.

We asked the waiter and he explained it's some kinds of melons, fruits.... whatever... we did not really care, if it's tasty.  But, honestly, it was kind of plain in taste and small in portion.\n\nThen, the burgers came and they looked delicious.  Yes, it was, juicy and tasty, just a little small in portion, especially for the men.  Overall, the place is very nice and the waiters are nice.  But, with the price charged, I would consider the portion too small.

Our experience couldn't have been better, as the food was terrific, the service friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere cozy and intimate.  Nevertheless, I think I can see how on a busy night things could get overwhelming for the kitchen and staff, and perhaps that's the source of some of the problems that have led to The Richmond's mixed reviews to date.\n\nWe started by splitting an appetizer of fried oysters with frisee and miso vinaigrette.  One of the standout features of this place is the way in which dishes present strong, distinctive flavors of individual ingredients that balance against one another quite harmoniously.  My wife's entree of petrale sole (apparently a substitute for the standard menu's yellow tail), oyster mushrooms, sunchokes, and watercress and celeriac puree was fantastic, particularly for the interplay of tastes between the mushrooms, fish, and celeriac puree.  My duck breast was served with a duck confit hash that was simultaneously down home and sublime,  and worked great in combination with the duck breast and a winter squash puree. \n\nI wasn't too impressed by the wine list, but did think the selections offered were very good, and the prices quite reasonable.  In fact, overall the prices at The Richmond are quite reasonable for the quality of both food and service.\n\nWe were well taken care of by the service here, which was very low key and very personable, although not as highly polished as in some larger establishments.  I can see how this could get disjointed under busier circumstances, and for that reason you may want to be careful about dining here at traditional peak hours.  Another factor to keep in mind is parking, and this area has the double curse of too many cars for too little street parking along with virtually no paid lots available nearby.  We lucked out by being offered by the proprietor to park in front of the driveway next to the restaurant, a very welcome and appreciated gesture, but not one that more than one or two diners could ever count on for any evening.\n\nThe Richmond is a winner, but be careful about choosing a day and time where you can really appreciate the best it has to offer.  The warm, small space, outstanding food, and individual service helped make the evening romantic and truly enjoyable.  We'll definitely be back.", "author": "Hugh B."}

I saw white table clothes and stemware on the tables and thought - what is this place?! Finally got to try it out and really enjoyed the food. It wasn't outstanding but it was good and I liked the comfortable atmosphere and affordable wine list. And I can wear jeans. There was someone even in there with a t-shirt and jeans. I love it.\n\nStarted with the beet salad and oxtail and scallops for appetizers. The salad was very good and the oxtail and scallops was good but the scallops a wee bit overcooked.\n\nEntrees were the hangar steak and petrole sole and beef cheeks. Yeah, I had a surf and turf for both of my dishes. The sole was awesome. A little oversalted as was the oxtail but very good.\n\nDessert was the panna cotta. This is a lot - I finished it because I am a pig and stopped eating my entree to have room. There was a raspberry sauce (I think it was raspberry) and there was lots of it. Maybe too much, I would have liked to have the sauce on the side or just dribbled over the panna cotta but I still ate it all.\n\nThe service was spotty but there was only one person on that night and he was doing all he could. Our bill came out to close to $100. In addition to the food we had three glasses on wine and should have just had ordered a bottle but I wanted white and my husband wanted red. What are you gonna do.\n\nI think this is a great neighborhood restaurant. Cozy, good food and before I forget the bread! I love bread and finished almost a whole loaf on my own. The three spreads were all good. Can't wait to go back for more and the $9.95 hamburger. For a couple of bucks more than the Hamburger Haven I can get a hamburger in style with some wine.", "author": "Wendy B."}

For a party of five, we arrived right on schedule after trying for a long time to find a parking space!\n\nIt's a small venue, so there isn't a host stand waiting for you. We stood for a few minutes before a waiter appeared to take us to our table. Matt was friendly. Water service never ended...I was a bit water logged by evening's end. The Bordeaux blend ($9) glass of wine was tasty, and the bread with three butters (olive, sea salt and chive) was delicious. The butter should have been thawed a bit more, but overall was quite good. \n\nThe potato leek soup with crab dumplings was superb, and my main entree of pork tenderloin was excellent, if a bit salty, and had to be sent back to be cooked a bit more, as it was too pink for my taste.

The place was practically empty and she just didnt deliver, maybe she was having a bad day, i dunno.

I'm sure that's a great place too, and I'll try it one of these days, but this really turned out perfectly for us, so I have no regrets.\nFirst, this place is great for a romantic meal-- quiet and cozy/tiny and pleasantly atmospheric, curtained alcoves and candles on the table.\nWe decided to splurge and go for the five-course tasting menu, although the a la carte stuff looked great too-- small menu, heavy on the meat, just one vegetarian entree. The entrees seemed to hover just under the $20 mark, which I would say is pretty good for the quality of the place. My husband was sort of tickled to note they had a cheeseburger on the menu for $9.95, alongside the pricier options.\n\nWe got: \n*FANTASTIC bread. Crusty outside, moist tender yeasty sourdough inside, with three different types of butter. Hard to stop eating it.\n*An amuse bouche of potato-leek soup, with a distinct fennel or anise taste to it. Milky and mild, nice but maybe a little bland.\n*Beet salad with goat cheese sauce and cardamom carrots, and a cheese-filled puff pastry. Well presented, simple and tasty. \n*Sweetbreads, nicely browned, with spinach and gravy and a sort of ravioli/dumpling at the bottom that was probably unnecessary to the dish. Very rich and flavorful. I was starting to worry by this point if I was going to be able to get through all the courses.\n*Seabass with greens and a creamy orange colored sauce that we couldn't quite identify- tomato? Pumpkin? (can't recall what the menu said) But it was good, rich and a little tangy, and the fish was moist and well cooked. \n*Ribeye steak with potatoes cooked with onions. Rare and tender and wonderful, if I go back I might very well just eat nothing but this.\n*Coffee semifreddo for dessert with a nice toffee crunch and whipped cream topping.\nMiraculously, the portion sizes turned out to be just about perfect-- I was very full at the end of all that, but not in pain.\nService was very attentive-- they seemed to switch off, so that all four people working in the restaurant at some point stopped by our table. But it worked out just fine, aside from one minor glitch when a server tried to give us wine (I'm pregnant and not drinking right now- my husband just doesn't drink much). \nDefinitely recommend, and it's nice to have something like this in the neighborhood.", "author": "Sara G."}

The curtains used to create rooms and privacy from the outside seems amatuerish and the muted TV at the bar seems out of place. The paintings/photos on the wall don't seem to connect to each other or any theme. There is mini wine cellar in the back with a good choice of wines. The dinner menu is very limited with almost every entree in the $19.95 range.\n \nIf you go, you should get a reservation. My girlfriend and I were lucky to be able to squeeze into the schedule without a reservation. Other people were turned away as we waited for our table.\n \nThe meal started off with this complimentary tiny cream cheese thing with nuts and a fig on top. Not bad. Their complimentary bread was warm and comes with 3 kinds of butters ... olive, regular with sea salt, and cucumber. The cucumber one is pretty good. \n \nFor an appetizer, we had the salad with cranberries, walnut, bleu cheese, and pears with pear vinegarrette. That actually was pretty good and for sharing they gave pretty big portions.\n \nFor the main course, we had their burger which is well worth the 9.95 price tag. The bread is a Schubert roll. I'm not sure what that is but it has these nice crunchy textures at the top of it. It comes with a tomatoe and this white cheddar cheeze melted on it. I had the patty cooked medium rare and it was very soft and juicy for the most part...one end of the patty (10% of the burger) seemed a little dry. \nThe burger is accompanied by shoe string fries, dijon mustard and their own homemade ketchup and aioli. The ketchup tasted a lot like a light tomato sauce to me though.\n \nOverall a pretty good burger but it doesn't beat the ones in NYC, IMO.

Both were divine. The salad had just enough dressing and the polenta with the scallop was immensely scrumptious. We were almost fighting over the last morsels of the scallop dish.\n\nOn to the main dishes.\n\nThe boyfriend had the hanger steak. He was highly impressed when they served it they way he wanted it, medium rare. It wasn't bloody and it wasn't overcooked-at all. His comment was \"this is the best steak I've had in a long time.\" It also came with a crepe filled with pancetta, potato, onion fennel & Brie, which was so good. Thank goodness we share our meals.\n\nI had the Rack of Lamb with bacon, onion, cabbage, pave potatoes & yogurt sauce. The potion was good and the taste was heaven. I'm very picky about my lamb and when bit into the juicy meat, I was utterly impressed. The vegis were cooked but not overcooked and the potatoes with bacon...oh my. \n\nDid I mention dessert?\nWe had the panacotta with raspberry sauce.

The server was also the owner and he was the NICEST person.  They really accommodated two pregnant ladies, one breast-feeding vegetarian who brought her newborn baby, and one other Mom.  The server gave us an out of the way table that he told us they used to use when his baby was just born and that they are very family friendly being a family member himself.  Well we found this unusual but were thankful!  I guess the Richmond also prides themselves on being a neighborhood restaurant even though they seem very upscale.  I mean it isn't Applebee's.  None of us ladies could have alcoholic beverages so I had hot decaf tea and everyone else stuck with water.  The Richmond had some tasting menus that we all decided to try, and the server said since it was slow he could accommodate us if we wanted to switch anything out.  I started with the polenta and scallop, and I also ordered an extra salad of pear, blue cheese and greens because I could not choose!  The other option was the crab cake and I don't know how I didn't order that as well.  I was very impressed with both my appetizers!  My main course was duck in a port wine sauce I think with some vegetables and mashed potatoes.  By now I was very full but I wanted to eat so much of this!  The duck literally fell off the bone as soon as I touched it slightly with my fork.  I am not kidding the duck just fell apart at the slightest nudge.  I had my entr\u00e9e wrapped up for me as I wanted to save room for the dessert of chocolate cake with peanut butter.  I of course really liked this but was still full.  I was really doing pregnant women everywhere a disservice with how full I became so quickly.  The server/owner later brought down his daughter who is now 10, and she shyly said \"hi\" to us.  What a cute and nice little girl!  I absolutely loved this place and it's a shame I don't live nearby.  If I lived close I would frequent this place a lot.  Service and food were equally amazing.

The lasagna used many different types of vegetables, including broccoli, squash, and mushrooms, so it had a great variety of textures. My girlfriend really liked her pork and mac & cheese. From my taste the pork was tender and sweet.\n\nFor desert we had a raspberry custard of some kind, which was wonderful. Tart raspberry sensation washed cooled down by the cool custard.

We started of with some amazing bread with olive butter and chive butter, and it was so delicious! Such a nice touch. In between courses they brought out teeny tiny \"palate cleansers,\" which all were very tasty. The food was delicious, and the server was excellent. The chef came out to thank us for our patronage. There are only two complaints, both rather significant but not enough to make me not like the place. While the food was delicious, the portions were TINY. I am not sure of the tasting menu is the only thing that comes with small, I mean SMALL, portions, but for 50.00 I feel like it was kind of a rip off. I am not for huge portions, but I think this was a bit ridiculous... it was almost funny when they brought them out. The other thing is that we got there at 8pm, and left at 10:30pm, because the courses were taking forever to come out. When the chef came out he thanked us for our patience, so maybe this isn't a normal thing. If we were on a schedule it would have been annoying.

In the past, I've also had the chicken and a beef dish (not what's currently on the menu), and both were superlative. The potato and leek soup was about as creamy as you could imagine, and all of their salads rock, too. Desserts are not an after-thought, though not the main reason to go here. The wine list covers the cheaper end well (the Benton Lane oregon pinot is a great deal) and though I'm not a wine snob, I'm told the selection they have at the higehr end is to die for. Can't see dropping $300 on a sauternes for dessert anytime soon, but if I do get a yen to do that, I'm coming here first. \n\nThey always have a great amuse-bouche too -- nothing where you're cracking up laughing at the logistics you think you need to eat it, and nothing as 'ok, i guess we gotta do this' as Nopa's radish and butter --- it's always been a perfect curtain-raiser.\n\nFinally, the burger. That's what I just had tonight. For less than $10, you get a perFECT half-pound burger, with a great sharp cheddar on a perfect brioche bun. You get a 'large' order of julienned fries (REAL fries are friggin' cut-up potatoes in hot oil -- whatever motherf***er decided we couldn't handle that and figured they needed a coating to be 'special' should be forced to eat hot-dog-and-curly-fries smoothies forever and ever, amen) . You get three small dishes of condiments, all house-made -- a great aoli, a spicy ketchup and a dijon mustard. THIS IS THE BEST DEAL IN TOWN. It's my lock of the week...\n\nA perfect reasonably priced Friday night date? Go to the DeYoung Museum (now $5 on Fridays), watch the sun set from the observation tower, then head over 2 blocks to The Richmond. Split a salad, have 2 burgers, a glass of wine each and split a dessert. If this doesn't make low-cost magic for you, then you, my friend, may already be dead and stiff.\n\nI ate here when they first opened up, and I was worried -- there were a lot of empty seats. But it's now tough to get a reservation. Don't say I didn't tell you.", "author": "T C."}

I do remember for main course I had the Bavette Steak and it was VERY well prepared. I remembered thinking what a prefectly prepared piece of beef it was. We tasted a few of the appetizer choices and each were delectable. The one thing that I really liked was the wine list offers a full spectrum of choices from affordable to break the bank which I think shows some serious depth. Not all places have a varied selection like this and I really think that is nice. \n\nService was decent yet not overly special but the atmosphere itself well but made up for it.

Plus two entrees (I got the burger....a serious Zuni competitor for less $), and a dessert (we shared their chocolate ice cream sandwich), a beer, a drink and a coffee (french press...the good stuff)...and the grand total was somewhere in the $63 range. An incredible deal for the quality of food and the impeccable service we received. While the space is small, the way it's set up (two dining rooms joined together), you could definitely rent one room out for a group dinner. On a side note, one of the most unique beer lists I've ever seen.

We even got to sit at the private, curtained-off table by the window. I brought my own bottle of wine (for sentimental reasons) and our waiter was happy to decant it. We shared two appetizers: crab cakes, and oxtail with scallops and polenta. Both were delicious! The crab cakes were very flavorful, crunchy on the outside and flaky on the inside. But the braised oxtail was amazing! The combination of the tender meat with the chewy scallops, fused together with a delicious sauce over a creamy polenta was heavenly. Onto the entrees, he had the bacon wrapped steak and I had the spinach and mushroom stuffed quail with potato hash. The quail was juicy and tender, and very filling for such a small bird.

To wit: we went to The Richmond for dinner last night, and while sipping our second bottle of wine and just having finished our amuse bouche of brie with apple on a little biscuity thing, she launches into a story about the bachelorette party she hosted last weekend.  Now, keep in mind that The Richmond is *small* and it being a Wednesday night was not very crowded.  Even a whisper can be heard by those sitting around you.  Suffice it to say that the last thing I needed to hear going into the appetizers was about a bunch of 30-something women (Lumberjack included) playing pin the cock on the hunk and a guessing game involving the penis sizes of their significant others.  Suffice it to say that what I needed to hear even less (now going into main entrees) was an argument that broke out amongst the girls as to what defines a small, average, or large penis size and then being asked how I would define it.  This is my sister.  She's asking me about penis size.  Can we say uncomfortable? \nLuckily for me, two bottles of great wine, great apps and entrees, not to mention some *really* great desserts, will always help ease the awkwardness that the Lumberjack sometimes puts me in.

I don't know what kind of potatos they use, but I swear, they're the most flavorful fries I've had.  I love that they are presented with homemade ketchup and mayo.\nThe homemade bread, as a lot of other people have talked about, are heavenly ... made all the more special with the three kinds of butter that they're served with.  I believe they are plain with gray seasalt, parsley butter and olive butter.\nJohn usually comes up with inventive and upscale version of food that I'd never thought to serve together.  His surf & turf (not what he calls it, but my own interpretation) included braised rib (a little boneless ball of the most succulent meat) and perfectly pan seared scallops on creamy polenta.  I'm drolling just thinking about it.\nAnd his dessert ... if you'd never had their homemade ice cream.  You must!\nThe wait-staff is always knowledgeable and patient.

However, this was my least favorite visit of all of my visits.  I will admit that this was to a quicker meal, so we avoided starters and just ordered the main course.  We also ordered wine and have to say that they really have tweaked their wine list for the current economy.  You can get very reasonable wines but can also splurge if you want.  However, after ordering we sat there for at least 30 minutes.  We received little attention from the waiter and were never given the bread and three option butter that they provide all the tables until we asked right before the meal was brought out.  I went with the flank steak, chefs choice.  Though tasty, it was way to chewy.  This was a 5 star on prior visits.  This time a 3 star, so now I have to settle for 4.", "author": "Markus S."}

After landing a new job, my boyfriend took me here to celebrate. We originally wanted a Sunday night reservation but they were all booked, but had a last minute cancellation that Friday nite, so we took it. This is not your known franchise of fine dinning restaurant, more like a gem in the quiet Richmond neighborhood of San Francisco, owned by John Owyang and his wife. \n\nEverything from the butter to the dessert was incredible. They serve the typical bread that most restaurants serve, but what's amazing is that they serve the bread with 3 different kinds of butter. Now, I normally try not to eat too much bread before my meal, but the butter was so good...I couldn't help it. Then we got my typical appetizer, Foie Gras. I pretty much try Foie Gras at every single restaurant that I've been to...and this one is up there...definitely leaves you wanting more. We also had the Crab crepe appetizer, another tasty dish. For our main course, we had the pork chop and braised chicken. Normally, I'd go for steak rather than pork, but my boyfriend had recommended it...so I tried it. It was the most tender, mouth watering pork chop I've ever had. It was soo juicy! Now, that's a talented chef. Most pork chops are a little on the dry side...but not this one. I recommend it if you happen to go on the week that they serve it...as their menu change weekly.  Their wine list is amazing. We had a bottle of the 1996  Silver Oak, and it was the perfect choice for our meal. And my favorite part... DESSERT! Try the Chocolate Souffl. So moist. So good! : )   And I love restaurants with chefs that cares about what their customers think....John came out after our meal to see how it was.  The waiter was also very nice, we were the last couple there... it was near 11pm but he was very nice about it. He chatted with us and didn't rush us out of there at all.\n\nFood, Service, Staff, Atmosphere, and last but not least company = 5 star! \n\nDefinitely will come back.", "author": "Kim D."}

The \"muse bouche\" was deviled eggs... so based on past experience I thought, \"these won't be like deviled eggs from the Joy of Cooking/ a la 1950s Americana, these will be some take-off on deviled eggs that really wows me.\" Nope- they were Americana and boring. Then I had the cod with fish chowder- a good match for the deviled eggs- it was mushy, flavorless, and drenched in boring chowder. My husband had the steak wrapped in bacon.

The host knew we were just getting wine, but he offered us a table (even though the place was filling up quickly and is pretty tiny) rather than immediately seating us at the bar. We decided to sit at the bar anyways and he offered to pour tastings of any of their wines by the glass. After deciding on wine, he sent us out these delicious little crab rangoons compliments of the chef. While we were drinking our wine the chef/owner came out of the kitchen to make sure we were okay. We were only here for 45 minutes and spent $20 but felt completely appreciated and taken care of, more so than at many restaurants where I've spent $200 on 5 course meals.

Might be it was not a good day in the kitchen, but though it was a very good experience unfortunately it wasn't the case of WOW. \nThe ambience was nice, cozy and lovely (big + was the quietness @ 5:30pm when we've been there, though the few tables were busy). The service was very good and attentive.\nThe problem is we were not VERY impressed with the food (as we hoped to be).\nWe had: a) Fried wontons (looked good, but the middle of them was still cold and not tasty as it could be if it would be heated enough, though we appreciated the offering), & bread with 3 varieties of batter (which we liked a lot) as amuse b.\n              b) Roasted beets & cardamom carrots salad + Whisky braised oxtail & scallops for appetizers (good but not great, puff pastry in the salad was cold and impression was it was pulled out of the fridge instead of freshly baked, and 2 scallops were not big or tasty enough to impress) as appetizers.\n              c) Seared Hunger steak (was OK just not memorable) + Wild Mushrooms stuffed in Puff Pastry (now THAT was the dish I will remember because it was delicious) for entrees.\n               d) Panna Cotta for dessert was just OK (I would like it better with some kind of sauce or fruit compote, it was too \"dry\" for me).\n               e) Wine suggested by the waitress was very good.\nThe best feature of the restaurant is the value: very reasonable prices and a lot of offerings.\nSo all together experience was good, but there is some room for improvement I guess. Is it a neighborhood gem? YES! Is it a foodies place? We'd say not yet, but it has a potential.", "author": "Tatyana M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-26", "description": "My rating is closer to 3.5 stars than 4. Bottom line is that the food is good but not great. All of the dishes were tasty but nothing really stood out. Our party ordered the short ribs in wine sauce, the pan fried chicken and the bacon wrapped New York steak (which turned out to be the prettiest dish).  For appetizers, we ordered the foie gras which I tried the tiniest piece of as I'm not a big fan and the hot dogs three ways.  The hot dogs three ways was unique as it featured a mini corndog, a mini chili dog and a mini pig in a blanket.  Unique in that I've never seen it before but the taste was similar to a full sized one.  I would have expected this restaurant to put it's own twist on it but unfortunately there wasn't.  One last thing I wanted to note was that Yelp reviewed raved about the pork which wasn't on the menu so I will have to come back again when they have it on the menu.  Hopefully I can upgrade this rating to a 4 when I do try that dish,", "author": "Dan W."}

I don't know how many times I've walked by this place without glancing at the menu (insert \"idiot\" from napoleon dynamite). Anyhow, the atmosphere is nice, definitely a good spot for a date. There were three of us and they sat us down at a nice table. There was a party of about 5 women behind us and I don't know what the deal is with the place but somehow I felt as though I could hear everything they were saying, from gossip to shopping...Anyways the wait staff were friendly. The menu was good (i.e. they had a flank steak dish, pork loin, your typical seared ahi dish, a cod dish, a burger and something else...). We were eating on the cheap and split the cheese plate which was fine I ordered the flank steak, asked for medium and it came out great (i used to order medium rare but have had some bloody beef in the past). We ordered the cheapest red wines (I honestly forget which ones, again, we were eating on the cheap, some bottles there go for like six hundo, pretty expensive...). One thing that did occur (but i could have cared less), was that when it came to delivering the food, they totally messed it up (i mean, that's a small error). They gave my cousins dish to me, then after they gave it to my cousin, they gave me my brothers dish (I found it humorous if anything). Anyhow, I enjoyed my meal (good presentation) and was totally satisfied. Cheers to The Richmond!", "author": "Cameron R."}

Friendly staff, cozy atmosphere, and classic, well-prepared food are all reasons why the Richmond is a great restaurant.  The chef comes out every time to check that everything was prepared to your liking. Sometimes free desserts show up at the end of the night- never a bad surprise!  Great wine list.  Not a huge menu, but changes seasonally and always is diverse enough to please all.  Moderately fancy, I'd say, with white table clothes, but not the pretentious attitude.", "author": "Stephanie H."}

I made the reservation for 6:30pm and was told to call back later in the week if I wanted  to see if my party could be seated at 7:00pm instead.  When I called back on Thursday, I was told that they could not accommodate my group which was a total surprise to me.  Shocked and Indignant,   I asked the guy, at what point where you going to call me to let me know?  Previously, I had given them my phone number and no one called or even bothered to leave a message that they were not honoring our reservation.   My husband and I have  eaten in many fine restaurants and to date, we have never experienced this type of low class/shabby treatment, a restaurant canceling our reservation without the decency and courtesy of notifying us.  After this unfortunate experience, we would never consider The Richmond.  Fortunately, we were able to get a reservation at Tommy Toy's Chinoise Restaurant to accommodate my daughter's family birthday celebration.  Maybe I should have listened to my brother before I booked the reservation because when I called to tell him where the birthday celebration was being held, he said that he ate at The Richmond  on 2 separate occasions and he said the food was only okay.  If you're planning a nice dinner for a large party, I would advise you to seriously look elsewhere.  Even if you're able to make a reservation, the question is whether The Richmond will pull the rug out from under your feet without notice and leave you totally stranded.", "author": "May N."}

I made reservations via Open Table (although I don't think we really needed them on a Wednesday night).  We got there early - they sat us no problem, and we got a seat right next to the window in a cozy little corner. The Chef came by while we were selecting our wine, asked what we liked and told us he had about 40 wines not on the menu. He then asked our price range and red or white and we left it up to him. He came back with a wonderful bottle for a reasonable price which complimented our meal wonderfully. The service was very attentive, the staff very friendly, and I loved the interaction with the chef.  It's a small restaurant, but quite charming and it could be a new romantic spot for us. The music filled the room, but I could still have a converstaion although a party of six behind us starting gabbing about politics - and I could have done without that! So I just drank my wine a little faster! ha!  They started us with a deviled egg (How did the waitress know I love those!) - and then some bread with a sea salt butter, kalamata olive spread and a parsley spread. Nice.  He had the Potato Leek soup - which was great. The salad, Good. The food fantastic. We had no room for dessert and we definatly felt they gave us our space and let us enjoy - some places you go to in SF they try and turn and burn you - this is no such place.  The pricing was reasonable - about 80 dollars for both of us (this includes a bottle of wine) and we will definately go back.", "author": "J S."}

The fact that the tables were not even all full at the time we arrived (and there are probably only about 10 tables total in the house) made it all the more problematic.  It took over 30 minutes for us to get some bread on our table, and this was only after we asked for it because I was about to pass out from hunger (the bread plate is actually cool, comes with three types of butter, and served with a side of deviled eggs).  So minus one star for all that.  The food was actually good.  We ordered the seared sonoma fois gras, crispy skin arctic char, and cheeseburger.  The fois gras was served on a french toast type of bread, and it was rich and very tasty.  Although, I should mention that I consider fois gras such an indulgence and don't think I have ever had it bad.  The char was like a salmon, served on a celery-type puree, and it was very fresh.  There were also oyster mushrooms and sunchokes which I think made the dish.  The cheeseburger was good, not stupendous.  The fries were soggy though.    Overall a decent dining experience, and I would go again, but definitely not on an empty stomach!", "author": "JoKr M."}

My husband and I went here for our anniversary (we just kind of picked a few places out of Zagat's, and this one seemed to appeal to us the most and they were open on a Monday!), so we didn't know what to expect. The food was wonderful- the small menu had several things that we were interested in trying, and plenty for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians. It's small, cozy, and informal, but the quality of the food was certainly fit for a more upscale place. The combination of flavors was interesting and delicious! Even better, we shared two appetizers, two entrees, and a bottle of wine, and our bill was under $100! The wine list was excellent (one of the reasons we chose to come to The Richmond)- there were lots of high end bottles on the list, but the lower end bottle we chose was delicious. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive. When they found out it was our anniversary and we were too full to order dessert, they brought us a complimentary serving of their lightest dessert- it was strawberry sorbet, which was wonderful (and I don't normally like strawberry desserts very much!)\nThe chef came out and said hello to us, and showed us their new menu, which looked great.

We were not disappointe at all.  This was one of the best meals we have had in a long time.  It is small but cozy neighborhood restaurant.  Going on a weeknight we were able to get a table without a reservation.  We ordered our dinner and while we waited the waiter brought out a sampler of their potato leek soup which was delicious and on a somewhat cold evening hit the spot.  We were then brought what I would call a bread course in which they brought out homemade french bread that was outstanding with 3 different kinds of spreads (butter).  All were delicious.  Our actual starters were salads.  I have their harvest salad with mixed lettuce, gorgonzola, walnuts , dried cranberry--typical of what many restaurants serve but this was a cut above.  Dressed well, and plenty of ingredients put in the excellent category.  My wife had the heirloom tomato salad with corn salsa and avocado and it was also excellent. For our main course I had Pork Tenderloin with Mac and Cheese, and vegetables.  Very good portion, everything on the plate cooked to perfection--very successful entree.  My wife had a Chicken Scallopine with Chicken Ravioli--different type of dish but excellent.  She loved everything about it and of course we shared both dishes.  I thought the ravioli was exceptional.  For dessert we ordered their apple spice cake with homemade Vanilla Ice cream.  Because it was near closing time they also brought us an extra dessert (no charge) that they were featuring on their tasting menu.  Both desserts were excellent.  I should mention that every item was presented in a very artistic manner and added a lot to our enjoyment of the meal.  Last, the service was excellent.  Our waiter was very informative, attentive but not over board and brought everything in a timely manner.

I had the potato leek soup which was good; smooth and creamy.  The heirloom tomato salad w/corn, roasted sunchoke and avocado was good also.  I had the burger and fries since I didn't want chicken and am allergic to fish.  It's a good burger but am hoping that the next menu change will have something else for me to try.  The chocolate tart w/choc crust and pulverized almond streusal was okay.  It came with a whipped cream flavored with cream of cacao and there is something about aeration like seltzer which at first to me made the cream taste like it had spoiled until the chef came out and said that was just the process to make it and it was supposed to taste and feel like that.
