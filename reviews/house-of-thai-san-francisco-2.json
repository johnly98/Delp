The neighborhood is a little sketchy but the restaurant itself is nicely decorated and spacious\n\n2. The food is tasty but truly depends on what you get. I personally got a soup based dish with fish (I forgot the name :c). It tasted like homemade food back in South Korea, which was great and heart warming. My friend got a vegetarian stir fry which tasted like a typically Chinese/Thai restaurant stir fry. So the taste really depends on what dish you get.\n\n3. The interior is nice. Nicely lit and cozy yet modern. The bathroom is located upstairs where you have to take the stairs to get up there. So not immobile friendly. \n\n4. The service is okay. They are not rude but I didn't sense the extra effort to be warm and friendly with the customers. It also took a really long time to get the waitress attention at one point. \n\n5. The prices are reasonable. They are not overly expensive or extremely cheap. I think the prices are fair for what they provide. \n\nOverall, I would recommend this place to someone who is looking for a place to eat in the area. I don't think this is the 'go-to' spot for someone who is visiting SF, but I would go again. I really did like their soup based dish with fish.", "author": "Shin L."}

I've ordered from this place dozens of times and not once was I let down.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-06-25", "description": "We went here on Pride weekend on a Sunday around 7:10pm. \n\nCommunication: 2/5 stars\nA worker inside asked us for our name, wrote it down along with some other people's names for the people around us and quoted us a time of 10-20 min and asked us if we wanted a menu so we could look at it while waiting. After looking at it for a while, my friend and I chose our items and continued to wait a little. I then noticed that another lady worker started asking the people around us for the name of their party. She then came up to us and asked you if we were waiting for our food. I told her no, we were waiting to be seated and the other lady got our names already.\n\nThis showed me that there's a clear disconnect between workers because she didn't appear to know that we were waiting to be seated, even though someone already got our names like 15 min ago. She even seated some people that came after us... This kind of irked me since I'm thinking- why did that other lady get our name then?? Luckily, they had a table free so we didn't have to wait any longer...\n\nFood: 4/5 stars\nWe ordered 3 items. Now, just to get a heads up, I like Thai food, but I'm very weak against spicy food so I tend to get stuff that's not really spicy at all. We decided on three items.\n\nSalad Neur Sun $13: 4/5 stars\nTender beef put on top of a \"salad\" composed of lettuce, 3 slices of tomato on the side, and raw onions with some type of special sweet salad dressing/glaze. You kind of have to mix up the salad, since parts of the lettuce doesn't have any dressing on it. The beef was very tender, and the glaze in the \"salad\" was pretty sweet and tasty.\n\nPad Kee Mao with beef $11: 4/5 stars\nSince I'm weak against spice, I asked if we could make this mild spice level and the server said it was OK. This tasted like a spicier version of Pad See Yew. Now, I really like Pad See Yew, so I really liked this dish as well, although their mild spice level is still pretty damn spicy to me. If I were to order this again, I would make sure to say I wanted no spice. However, the beef in this was pretty dry, and was definitely of lower quality than the beef in the above-mentioned salad.\n\nGang Dang with pork $13 a la carte: 4/5 stars\nThis is basically like panang curry but the sauce is definitely more watery. I also chose to have mild spice level and this was also a bit too spicy for me. We ordered a side of Jasmine rice for $2, because you can't get curry without rice. They also gave a smaller version over rice for $11, but I wanted the full size. This also tasted yummy, although spicy. The pork was also too dry.\n\nService: 3.5/5 stars\nThere was a male server that went around refilling people's water, but when I wanted water due to the spice level, he was nowhere to be seen. The other servers were also a bit less attentive. We called one server for water, but she never came back. When we asked for a check and a box, we got those pretty quickly. We didn't have to wait too long the food to be served. \n\nI didn't use their restroom so I'm not sure how clean it was...\n\nWould I come again? Yes, if I'm in the neighborhood, but maybe I'll try dishes with tofu or chicken to see if it's better with those options instead...", "author": "Gilda W."}

Their bathroom is located up the stairs and is a little bit cramped-- the stairs going up are a little bit small and cramped as well so be sure to take your time. The restaurant space is wide and open which can make the noise level a little high during certain times, but we were still able to enjoy our meal and conversation regardless of the noise around us. \n\n  Food - I had the Pad Thai (Pictured) and it was delicious! I love the Thai peanut sauce they use along with the pan-fried rice, stick noodles with shrimps, egg, fresh tofu, green onions, beans, sprouts, and ground peanuts. All in all it made for an amazing Pad Thai dish and not too spicy because I got moderate. \n\nService - I would've given this place a 4/5, but their service was very very very slow... We were sitting there for a long time before someone actually came and took our order, got us more water, gave us a receipt, or even checked up on how we were doing.

Ask for a spice rack if you don't think it's spicy enough. The pad gra-praw was a good level of spice however I wished there was more vegetables. We finished the rice that came with it pretty quickly so it was difficult just eating that pork all on its own. The gang dang (red curry) was delicious as well.

Food was very average. Maybe below average actually. If you're a fan of sweeter palates for Thai food, House of Thai might be up your alley. A lot of Thai spots I've been to tend to be on the sweet side, but I found both dishes that I ordered here to be overly sweet and couldn't even compare to the authentic food I've had in Thailand.\n\n* SOM TOM PU ($10) - 3/5\n[salted crab, shredded green papaya, green bean, tomatoes, garlic, fresh chili, lime dressing]\nA lot of people judge Thai restaurants based on pad thai, but I like to use papaya salad as a basis for comparison. Theirs was way too sweet for me and was missing the complex flavors I like in papaya salads. No acidity and not that spicy. The only saltiness came from the salted crab. I usually get papaya salad with shrimp but decided to try the crab version, and I think I'd stay with the shrimp version in the future. I wasn't really fond of the crab so I ended up not eating it. \n\n* KA MOO ($11) - 3.5/5\n[pork leg stew, served w/ spicy secret sauce, jasmine rice]\nSeeing ka moo on the menu reminded me of an amazing plate of pork leg stew I had in Thailand a few years ago and made me crave it again, especially since I don't see it a lot at Thai restaurants. Like the papaya salad, their ka moo was on the sweet side, but the pickled mustard greens gave it some tangy flavor. The pork was a little dry/overcooked in some parts and it was probably half meat, half skin/fat. The rice is definitely needed to soak up all the fat.", "author": "Jessie L."}

The beef was tender but the potatoes were a tad too soft to my liking.  The beef with sticky rice was really good!  It came in three big pieces so we had to cut them.  It went really well with the sticky rice--something I would order again.  At the end, we ordered mango with sticky rice and this was a tad disappointing because the portion was extra small, lol.

My boyfriend always gets the Red Gang Dang Curry with Chicken every time we go. It's delicious and they add quite a bit of spicy kick to the dish. I'm personally not a fan of bamboo shoots but I love how their coconut curry sauce tastes and the flavors of the Red Curry meld very well. \n\nDepending of what i'm in the mood for, there are many other good things on their menu. My go-to curry is their Pumpkin curry and I always add either Chicken or Beef. I'm a sucker for butternut squash/pumpkin and the flavors always balance out nicely because they add garlic and basil and bell pepper. Whenever i'm in a noodle mood I always go with the Pad Se Ew or the Pad Thai, as you can't really go wrong there. Their Yum salad with Beef is also delicious, their spicy lime dressing is really refreshing and the beef is seasoned well and not overcooked.

Our hotel was right in the heart of downtown, so I was determined to find some of the best Asian cuisine in the area... and lucky me, first try.  Shout outs to Yelp and Location Tracking.\n\nI walked in with my friend on Sunday around 6.  Pretty busy, but not super packed.  It was a lot bigger than I thought it was going to be.  The kitchen is open in the back, so you can see and hear all the cooking going on.  The menu is huge -- there are well over 100 options to choose from.  I'm a huge fan of Tom Yum, so I got the Tom Yum Noodle Soup.  You can ask for a spice level 1-5 -- 3 is the threshold for me, and I like a good kick to my food.  I also got a Thai Tea, which was refreshing.\n\nThe Tom Yum Noodle Soup was delicious.  I think that this place has the perfect noodle to soup to meat ratio -- a lot of other places I've been to have either too much broth or not enough meat.  Another thing to note is that you get a lot of food for the price you pay, which is a stark contrast from many other Thai restaurants I've been to.  For $10, I was definitely satisfied.  \n\nThe waiters and waitresses are nice and are really on top of it all -- they give you water in really small cups, but I never ran out even once.  Another thing I like about this place is how casual the atmosphere is -- it's an awesome place to gather as a group or just go with a friend.  They had the Warriors game on and played today's hits on the radio.\n\nMy friend and I liked our meal so much on Sunday night that on Tuesday night, we came back... and brought 6 others with us.

Well we definitely felt it was a quality thing as my fianc\u00e9 couldn't stop taking about how good it was. Skeptical, I took a bite. Yup, pretty damn good!

The squid, cuttlefish, shrimp, etc was NOT overcooked, rubbery, tough, etc. Well the mussels were a bit chewy, but all else was perfect. Flavor? Outstanding. Enough to go back again.

I actually ordered my food at the spiciest level because I'm used to other restaurants being weaksauce when it comes to that... but I promise you, House of Thai WILL deliver the spice you ask for and they do NOT hold back.\n\nMy friend and I came here because I was craving Tom Yum Noodle Soup. This is what I ordered at the spiciest level (with regret) but it was okay regardless. Way too sweet for my taste. Large portions, though... so you will definitely be full by the end of the bowl. We also ordered the Larb with minced duck, which I was also not a fan of. For dessert we got the Mango with Sweet Sticky Rice which was AMAZING. Favorite part of the meal and a great way to counter all the spiciness consumed prior. \n\nThe service here is fast and excellent. The food is fresh and affordable, but it's just not my favorite place to get Thai food in SF.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

I found this spot on Yelp and it seemed to be having good reviews so you know I had to give it a chance.  I was staying at a hotel in downtown SF and my family and I were to lazy to go out.  Thank goodness this place had free delivery too for orders over $20.  The lady over the phone was super nice and didn't rush you.  I ordered the usual shrimp pad Thai noodles, beef pad see-ew and some crispy chicken wings with Thai chili dipping sauce!! We ordered at 9pm on a Thursday night and got our food delivered to our room 9:30!! This was awesome because our food was still hot and the wings were really crispy!!! The pad Thai was really tasty not to sweet and not to much egg in there!! The pad see-ew had nice size cuts off well marinated beef in them and the Chinese broccoli was nice and crispy! The chicken was nice and crispy with about 6 pieces.  No negatives here! I want to eat in the restaurant to see if they are truly a 5 star!

What else is important? Well, prices, atmosphere, and customer service. House of Thai scores big in all of these areas, too. The food and prices are like a hole in the wall place, but for once the facilities are well cared for and inviting...love this combination. \n\nWe got the Panaeng curry beef, the pad thai, and the sweet basil chicken. Simply bursting with flavors. It was a pretty generous portion, too, so I probably could have taken some home - but I didn't want to! It was way too tasty; I had to keep eating. \n\nThis area in particular seems to be rife with thai places - there are probably 5 or 6 within a 6 block radius.

No, I'm not your long-lost Chinese grandmother who head-butts you on MUNI to get a seat. I just happened to like steamed chicken with a little minced garlic and ginger oil for dipping. I'm finally recognizing that I prefer it at old-school Chinese restaurants where I can get a whole chicken cut up and served that way versus Thai restaurants where they make it with less conviction, something that became clear when I tried this place out on the busy corner of Larkin and Geary in the Tenderloin. It's a bustling place in the early evening, but I managed to secure a table quite easily.\n\nGetting service once I sat down was more challenging, but the menu is fairly comprehensive so it took me a while to peruse it. I decided to order the $7 Por-Pier Sod, which sounded like a more carnivorous version of a spring roll since the thick rice paper wrapped Chinese sausage, egg, tofu and cucumber. I liked it enough since it had a nice crunch, although the gloopy sweet and sour tamarind sauce was ladled on far too thick to enjoy (photo: http://bit.ly/1cCGTGL). A proper peanut sauce positioned for optional dipping would have suited me just fine. For my entree, no surprise, I went for the $11 Kao Mun Kai. What is it, you ask?\n\nWell, it turned out to be slices steamed white chicken on a mound of garlic and ginger rice. It was accompanied by a soy bean chili sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1H6lnSJ). The reality was that there was little if any garlic or ginger in the brown rice, and the chicken was a bit dried out from being in the steamer too long. There are plenty more Thai dishes to consider here, so I wouldn't dismiss this place entirely based on my experience. It's just that based on the two dishes I had, they should consider tasting them again to continue refining the flavors. After all, the competition is pretty fierce in this neighborhood for good-tasting Thai. Lers Ros anyone?\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...pretty average Thai dishes with steamed chicken that left me feeling meh\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...fairly spacious for a 'Loin restaurant with a nice view of the passing derelicts\nSERVICE - 3 stars...fast and barely there\nTOTAL - 3 stars...when is a house not a home?...when it's House of Thai, I guess", "author": "Ed U."}

I've tried many other Thai restaurants across the Bay Area, but none come close to this one. \n\nThey have a terrific menu that's generally standard Thai fare that you do find everywhere else (though I wish they had dishes that featured oyster sauce, which I've come across at other places). \n\nThough I've tried many different menu items over the years, my favorites are the pad prik khing  with pork (pork & string beans in a spicy red chili sauce), any of the fried rices, and the tom yung goong soup (seafood lemongrass soup). They don't play around with their spices here, and I LOVE spicy food, so when you order Thai medium, just know that it's going to have a definite kick and that you'll want your water glass nearby.\n\nTwo small downsides to this place: 1) it's in sketchy area that has gotten somewhat better over the years, but is still a little gritty. No one will bother you at all, but you may have to step over a few unfortunate souls who may be in various stages of inebriated or passed out; 2) the prices have been creeping up over the years, so what actually used to be a good bargain in years past is becoming typically SF-expensive (e.g. if my large bowl of soup or rice had been around $9-$10 when I first moved here, now it's more like $13-$15).

When we saw the extensive menu, it is very surprisingly that there is so many types of foods choices in a Thai restaurant in United States. \nWe ordered moo ka (pork leg) and stir fry egg plant with beef.\nThe moo ka is fantastic! Lots of tender meat and fats that melt in your mouth! Very delicious, hence I give this restaurant 4 stars.\n\nThe stir fry egg plant with beef is not delicious though. The beef is tough as leather and the dish was over and heavily seasoned. It is very very oily, salty and sweet. Just too much to take. We do not like that dish but love moo ka dish! \nWill come back and try the stir fry basil chicken and other dishes since they look very delicious.", "author": "Am T."}

The standard Pad Thai is flavorful with just the right amount of sweetness and tamarind flavor.

So, let me break it down for you: \nFood: 4 Star\n- H O T Combo ($12): I really like this plate because you can try a variety of the appetizers. Normally, Thai restaurants don't do a sampler. Each appetizer was very unique and presentable and it also taste very good.\n- Shrimp Pad Thai (11ish): Was average. Just like any other Thai place that has it.\n- Tom Yum Noodle Soup ($11): This was really good. I got medium spicy. The broth was sweet and spicy. \nService: 2 Star\nWhy was the service two stars, you may ask\nWell, we just sat down for two minutes and the waitress came and ask what we want already. I felt kind of rush because the two waiter and waitress kept coming by and asking to take our plate, when we still have food on it.\nEnvironment: 3 Star\nThe moment you open the door, a weird smell hits you. When you get seated there are gigantic flies flying around you the whole time. The restaurant although was very big, it was also very empty.", "author": "Irene Z."}

This popped up on Eat24 and I thought it would be a most excellent idea. (It was.)\n\nI ordered two curries - chicken and pumpkin. I foolishly didn't read that the chicken curry was a rice plate and accidentally ordered two extra boxes of rice. This ended up working out in the long run, because I had enough curry to last for two days and needed the rice anyway.\n\nThe curry isn't like any of the usual Thai places I go to, which leads me to believe that other Thai places are actually Americanized Thai places, which is fine. The curry here doesn't seem as creamy as others, so if that's not your thing, well, there you go. The chicken in my curry was lovely and fell apart easily from just a spoon! It wasn't the red curry I was expecting, but it was very comforting and quite filling.\n\nThe best part was that it was definitely cheaper than sushi, and the boyfriend and I had food for at least two days for just ~$30. Not bad! I'll be ordering from here again for sure.", "author": "Robbin A."}

Definitely recommend if you're looking for quick lunch or dinner because the food is quick but yet fresh and tasty. \n\nI had the pork leg stew. I didn't know what thai pork soup is and thought it was going to be similar to chinese pork soup but I was wrong, thai pork soup is much more spices and thick and full of flavor. I actually enjoyed this bowl of noodles. It had plenty of meat, noodles and vegetables. I am excited to come back and try different dishes. \n\nBad thing that might have costed one star less was because they ran out of the taro in coconut milk dessert!!! I was so excited when I saw this on the menu, but sad when they told me they ran out);", "author": "Wendy T."}

This place seemed a little fancy cause people claimed that they made reservations and all. However, it was nice that they took us in since they had an opening. The food was really good. I got the pad kee mao, which was very flavorful although it wasn't as spicy as I expected. Many places make pad kee mao hecka salty but this place made it just right. We got satay chicken as an appetizer, which I personally think it was a bit bland, not much flavor. We had to dig in the peanut sauce for some flavor in there. The service was okay. Overall, my experience was good.", "author": "Katelyn N."}

Again, with the star count - I don't understand! :(\nI stopped by here a couple nights ago with my boyfriend, hungry and ready to try a new Thai spot. The place was pretty busy when we walked in - we got seated and waited way too long for a server to arrive, and even longer to order a drink. We were surprised to see the only tea thy had to offer was hot Thai tea but I will give their minted lemonade 5 stars! Delicious!\n\nThen we move along to our food. I ordered a cucumber salad & drunken noodle. The cucumber salad came and the dressing tasted a bit off and was a little room temperature... But what really made me disappointed was the drunken noodle (which my boyfriend also ordered). It was swimming in sauce! I mean really it was like drunken noodle soup - way to heavy - I felt so nauseous from it actually in the middle of eating it. We had to chase down our waitress to get the bill. I've had way better food and service. Sorry guys, it's a pass for me!", "author": "Callan B."}

As much as I love Lers Ros, it sucks that they're always so busy!\n\nGiven how my friend sold me on House of Thai's typical lack of lines, it was quite ironic that we ended up having to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table (it was an abnormally busy night downtown/in the TL).  Not a big deal, but it seemed like the rest of the service went a little slow.  In particular, there was a drag before our first plate came out.  Then again, maybe we were just that hungry...\n\n- TOONG GYEN YUNG - Minced Chicken, Onion, Carrot and Potatoes wrapped in a \"Golden Bag\" with Cucumber Salad...$7.00\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-thai-san-francisco-2?select=JTOkkAc_mEeocpOAh_zbWA#irdePvDg5INkeflnlVwMAQ)\nMy friend ordered it for the table to share since it's one of her favorites.  The \"pouch\" is essentially a dumpling skin that's been tied off and baked.  Kind of a neat idea, and it really was tasty, but it's not something I would crave for either.  \n\n- KAO KA MOO - Pork Leg Stew over Rice with Special Secret Sauce...$8.00\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-thai-san-francisco-2?select=JTOkkAc_mEeocpOAh_zbWA#0luta6DtQBDq9NyJ5k8raA)\nWhile the dish looked great (albeit seemingly smaller than in the photos on Yelp), I have mixed feelings.  The pork was amazingly tender, and the taste was pretty good.  However, it was a little heavy on the herbs, and the dipping sauce was very sweet.\n \nAlthough I wasn't as impressed with the Pork Leg Stew as others, I did get to try their Chan Pad Poo (spicy crab noodles) and it was pretty solid.  The flavors were spot on, and they weren't kidding when they said it was spicy - just the way I like it!\n\nStill, until I get the chance to try more of their food, I'm rounding down from THREE AND A HALF STARS for now.  The menu certainly has potential, but I feel like I can get some of these dishes elsewhere (Amphawa on Geary has a similar Chan Pad Poo, and it's both closer and easier to park by).  Plus, since I don't frequent the TL often, I'd rather head over to Lers Ros to make the trip worthwhile.", "author": "Mike L."}

Ok, am I the only one admitting to watching a movie with JLo?? So be it. Bidi bidi bom bom y'all! \n\nI order delivery at least once a week from here because it's so freaking good. When they say hot, it is \"holy duck my mouth is on fire and will be for the rest of the night\" hot. I'm a creature of habit, so if any potential kidnappers are reading this please pick from these options: wontons, wonton soup, Pad Gra-Praw and Pad Kee Mao. I'm kind of obsessed with the pad gra-praw to be honest. It definitely has the potential to be oily, so be sure to mix it up. The wonton soup here is the best I've had since moving to SF, although I wish they'd ixnay the roast pork and endless cabbage. Sometimes simple is better. \n\nDelivery to my 'hood (FiDi) sometimes takes a while, and my belly starts grumbling, and then I make bad life choices by eating cheese curls but I promise it is worth the wait.

I can eat spicy, but this was straight up fire water and highly lacking in flavor.

Nothing wrong with this dish, but could have used some spice or something.  Little bit too sweet.\n  - Got the rolls as appetizers.  Not great, not terrible.  \n  - None of the food was spicy (maybe I could specifically request some spice?)\n  -   Thai iced tea was good, really creamy.\n\nOverview: Most of the food was middle of the road for Thai, not one dish was standout.

We have eaten there, picked up orders, and had deliveries.\n\nThis evening we were subjected to non-apologetic rudeness and apathy by not one, but two employees at House of Thai.\n\n1.  After receiving the order confirmation from Eat24, I noticed it would be  2 hours before they could deliver.  Realizing I would have to leave before then, I immediately telephoned House of Thai.\n2.  I got the usual woman who answers the phone yet barely speaks or understands English.  I patiently tried to explain I needed to have the food delivered to the other family address.  She, as usual, was rude and curt.  I asked for the manager.  Spoke with a male staffer who assured me the address would be changed.\n3.   I wrote to Eat24 and explained I had changed the address.  All of this within the first couple of minutes of placing the initial order.\n4.  Eat24 also contacted House of Thai and were assured that the updated address was noted.\n5.  After waiting over two hours, no food.\n6.  I phoned House of Thai.  Got yelled at and berated repeatedly that their driver was at the original address and there was no answer.  *sigh*\n7.  Instead of acknowledging that both Eat24 and I had contacted them, and that they had indeed confirmed the address change with both of us, the again non-able-to-communicate-properly woman was unprofessional and rude.  I asked for the manager, and she continued to yell at me.  Then she kept repeating loud enough for me to hear and making fun of my voice,  \"I want the manager now\".  That's not how you treat people lady!  Its not my fault you don't speak or understand English properly, and its just plain rude to make fun of people, especially when you are the one who erred.  Everyone in this family has been more than patient and understanding despite your many, many mess ups of orders.  You see, we believe in the adage \"treat people the way you want to be treated.\"\n8.  A different person, calling herself the manager then came on the phone and continued berating me for not being at the first address.  She was even ruder.   She said the place was busy and noisy and she couldn't hear me.  When I suggested she go to a quiet part where she could hear, it made her even more irate.\n9. The order for tonight was a large, expensive one.  Now, thanks to your rude employees, we will not be ordering, coming in, or suggesting your restaurant again.  There are many wonderful Thai places in our fine city.  You have lost our loyalty.\n10.  And finally, we fully understand that not everyone speaks English.  Not everyone in our family does either.  Our diversity of people is one of the things that help make America such a great nation.  You should not have a person who cannot adequately communicate by phone (both with lack of language skills and unprofessional behavior) ever answering the phone.", "author": "Alex C."}

But House of Thai is *convenient*.

In addition to all the usual Thai restaurant staples, this place has a few slightly less common options on the menu, such as khao soi, khao man gai, and phad pong garee (try it with shrimp or catfish).\n\nMost entrees can be ordered as a rice plate for $10+, in a lunch-sized portion, or a la carte for a couple of bucks more (larger portion, but doesn't include rice).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-23", "description": "My first Thai food meal and review in 3 years. You can tell many of you know I'm not a Thai food eater. I guess I know why many of my admirers simply would not go out with me, because I am an \"extremely fussy\" eater! \n\nWhat makes me decide to eat Thai cuisines? My date loves Thai food!\n\nAlso, if she jumps off the bridge, I join her too. \n\nBut when I do crave for Thai food, it would be curry. I ordered the #45:  Pumpkin Curry with a choice of meat. I chose chicken. The featured $10.00 entr\u00e9e had a thick pumpkin puree mixed with Thai spices, basil and bell peppers. I also get a side of Brown rice with my entr\u00e9e. I love this entr\u00e9e very much. But you know, I infrequently eat Thai food and know little of other places that can make a better dish than here. My meal: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vKBW6SWFrIYXW1kIOFY_Ng?select=P6sv788Nl5IKGZ1DUiX-Ug#P6sv788Nl5IKGZ1DUiX-Ug\n\nMy date ordered the popular Pad Se Ew. The $8.00 pasta dish has stir-fry thick rice noodle, chicken (or your choice of meat or vegetarian), Chinese broccoli, eggs, soy sauce, scramble egg and spices. She noticed a funky taste on the Chinese broccoli. And that funky taste that I tasted was the bad batch of the vegetable. She scraped all the vegetables aside and ate the rest of the dish.  Her dish: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vKBW6SWFrIYXW1kIOFY_Ng?select=P6sv788Nl5IKGZ1DUiX-Ug#ASiG8zxw1oifbjTwZKVMvg \n\nI also ordered the Strawberry Soju Mojito. For $5.00 the drink has a strawberry puree mixed with the Korean wine with a mint-leaf garnish. This is a very refreshing drink and good enough to get the night going with your date =P \n\nMy drink: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/vKBW6SWFrIYXW1kIOFY_Ng?select=P6sv788Nl5IKGZ1DUiX-Ug#qA-EqR5ksNaY-B-JjsFoSg\n\nDespite the restaurant is located in the jagged Tenderloin location, this restaurant is somewhat clean. The cute lady workers were very nice to us. Joe Cool did a good job in not eyeing the lady workers often. \n\nMy first Thai food in many years did not disappoint. I would definitely come here again for the curries and hopefully the workers would correct the minor problem with my date's dish.", "author": "Matt G."}

At 4 stars with over 800 reviews I thought it seemed solid. I read a review where someone was complaining about the delivery person and I thought, someone had a bad experience and may be over exaggerating. He was not. \n\nThe delivery guy called me as he was about to arrive-\"this is delivery, please come downstairs and meet me, I am almost there\", I responded with \"uh no you can call the keypad and I will buzz you in\" he let out a ugh and a sigh but agreed. Dude, I already tipped you 15% on my order and you are going to make me come down in my pajamas? Ever wonder why people order delivery sometimes? Because they don't want to go out in the world. \n\nHe calls again once he is here. This time he is claiming the buzzer doesn't work. I said to him \"nope, it works, try again\". Thankfully someone was leaving at the moment so he got in. The keypad is not anything state of the art by any means...\n\nWhen he gets out of the elevator he hands me my food and I tell him \"you know, when people tip you, you shouldn't make them come down to you. It's rude\" he looked at me like he couldn't believe that I actually said something to him. He was shocked. And I am never ordering from this place again. I really don't want to have to deal with that BS every time I want to order from them. \n\nThere are plenty of other Thai spots in the city. \n\nLastly, my green curry had good flavor but the veggies were cooked down to mush and the chicken was dry, dry, dry.

When we called back, she said we couldn't cancel because our food was already ready. Then she said our delivery was going be delivered  in half an hour. How could our 4 dishes be ready that quickly and then be waiting around for delivery? Were they planning to deliver us cold food? And how did the delivery time change?

Our food came out quick. The ambiance isn't much, in fact it feels a little corporate and strip-mally, but I don't hold that against them.\n\nSince you have to make hay while the sun shines, we split this dish before going on to dinner number two, so I wish I had more to go off of.

As for customer service, they definitely deserve the 5 stars.

Unfortunately, their wait for delivery seems to be about the same - I believe it was an hour and 15 minutes.  The papaya salad was good but smaller and not quite as spicy as I'm used to.  Pumpkin red curry was tasty and came with plenty of veggies and pumpkin.  It could definitely have been spicier tho.  Overall I think Lers Ros is better and given the comparable wait times would choose the former in a heartbeat. \n\nCaveat- this place is way better than your average Thai restaurant in SF or other cities - I am just spoiled when it comes to Thai food.", "author": "Andrea L."}

There are plenty of other Thai restaurants in the area, and a few that are really good.  This is one of the few restaurants where a large majority of the menu items are really good, however, there are a few dishes that really stand out.\n\nOne of those dishes is Kanom Jean.  There are actually many variations of Kanom Jean, but House of Thai serves only Kanom Jean Nam Ya.  This is only the second place I've seen in the Bay Area that serves this dish and it's far better than the other place.\n\nThe dish is essentially a coconut milk-based curry seasoned with lemongrass, fish paste, and several other spices, and contains fish balls.  The dish is typically served with the curry sauce in a bowl and the other components on a plate.  The other components being a type of rice noodle (kanom jean), cut green beans, dried chili peppers, pickled mustard/cabbage?,  raw cabbage,  bean sprouts, and basil.  Of course, depending on where you go, they may have more or less items.\n\nAnyhow, if you truly enjoy Thai food, this dish is worth trying.  Quit getting only Pad Thai or Pad See Ew already.  Seriously, if that's your main/only benchmark for a good Thai restaurant, I pretty much don't care what you think.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

At first, I was secretly mourning the fact that the boy didn't get my favorite, pad see ew, but this was a welcome surprise!

It was quite possibly the best dish of the entire meal.\n\nThe wonton soup was humongous - a clear soup bursting with flavors supporting a flotilla of healthy cabbage leaves and gobs of wonton. I was a tad disappointed that the wonton fillings tasted a little weird and did not meet the expectations set by my first slurpful of the soup; but it was still good!\n\nFor the main course, us two greedy dudes, to horribly translate an (India) Indian proverb, \"our eyes were bigger than our tummy,\" decided to go for the Green Chicken Curry, the Five Spice Duck, and steamed Jasmine Rice (don't ask me why I am needlessly capitalizing the words).\n\nThe Green Chicken curry was really good; the green sauce being one of the best that I've had in quite a while, unlike some of the joints that totally rely on the richness of the coconut milk to mask and ameliorate their lack of talent in harnessing the rich range of herbs and spices at their disposal. The loads of vegetables in the curry were a little visually distracting but once you devour them, they aren't so distracting anymore.\n\nThe Five-Spice duck was pretty good with a soy based sauce but my benchmark \"roasted duck on rice\" at Chao Praya (in Novato) is yet to be surpassed.\n\nHaving been taught a lesson in overindulgence midway through the meal, we decided to box the remaining 2/3rd and 1/3rd of the green chicken curry and five spice duck respectively; It made for three more meals (yep, ~I~ took them all! heh heh)\n\nThe check came to less than $40 for the two of us after all that we had.

Though I've never actually been inside House of Thai. Being the lazy and apartment dwelling bum that I am I get House of Thai delivered.\n\nFavorites include:\nPo Tak Soup - Jam packed full of sea critters. I get it almost every time. It's especially perfect on a cold day, or when you're sick.\n\nLarb Salad - Get it with duck, you won't be disappointed. I love this one!\n\nPla Mauk Tod - Perfect appetizer, I always ask for a 2nd sweet and sour sauce and one time I even got one!\n\nNuer Kem - All dat protein. This is the kinda thing I add to my order just to meet the delivery minimum but then it makes a perfect snack later or the next day.\n\nMint Lemonade - So good! And if you're the type to booze, it mixes really well with vodka. \n\nThai Iced Tea - It's Thai iced tea\n\nWhile these are my favorites I always add something like Pad Thai, Pad Se-Ew, Fried Rice, the Pork Leg Stew Noodles Soup, etc. Also, their crispy pork belly is good but not as good as Ler Ros.

The sauce was amazing, and the chicken and potato were good as well. The pieces were big, but easily cut into, even with a fork. \n\nMy only issue would be that you have to be very specific what you're ordering. (My Thai is nonexistent, and the server's English was passable.) I thought I was getting the manageable yellow curry portion that came with rice. But I wound up with the large portion and having to order rice separately. It was a bit much, and there was some potato and rice left over. (I decided that such delicious chicken should not go to waste, and crammed it down.) \n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food quite a bit, and would call it one of the better yellow curries that I've had. There just needs to be a little more work on the occasional language barrier.", "author": "Br. S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-27", "description": "The five stars is for the Ka Moo here. The rest of the dishes are around 3-4.\n\nKa moo is a perfect trinity of stewed pork shank, served over rice, with pickled mustard greens on the side.\n\nEach spoonful of this tender meat, stewed in a base of soy sauce and star anise further deepened by the pork shank, is barely held together by the collagen that has already slightly thickened the broth. This is further enhanced by the vinegary spicy dipping sauce, a piquant high note cutting through the undertone of sweetness and fattiness. The rice, rich from soaking up all the stewing juices, dulls the spiciness of the dipping sauce, and the pickled mustard provides a welcomed textured contrast to the rest of the dish.\n\nIf one pork dish is not enough for you, there's also the Moo Tod, golden-crispy outside and tender inside, with a sweet-sour dipping sauce.\n\nAll the fried rice are good, but I have a special fondness for the shrimp paste fried rice. Not everyone's thing, but if you like shrimp paste, you might want to try this.", "author": "C C."}

Your mouth and tongue will experience an excruciating and extreme burning sensation.\n\nJust thinking about the naked ladies makes my tongue burn with the residual memory of the spicy hotness of the Thai chili peppers.  If you order naked ladies, you'll get some raw shrimp covered with minced garlic, onions, and other garnishments, drizzled with the chef's spicy lime dressing.  There's also a side of this dressing served on the side, in case you really want to feel the burn, and perhaps ruin your ability to eat anything else.  They use Thai chilies that have a slow, long burn.\n\nNOTE, however, that you can ask them to tone down the hotness.  Friends of ours arrived after us, and ordered the naked ladies, but asked that they make it not as spicy after watching us guzzle down glasses of water (and for one friend, multiple glasses of water, and finally a glass of milk).  Their naked ladies weren't as spicy.\n\nAll the other food we ordered was good.  My Pad Kee Mao noodles were perfection.  The rice dishes were just so-so, but I can't give an accurate review of the other dishes because my tongue was still burning after the naked ladies for most of the meal, and right after the naked ladies, it actually kinda hurt to put food on my tongue.\n\nAll in all, I will come back for some more naked ladies.

A bit sketchy and intimidating, but get over it and it's well worth it. We came in around 7 and got seated right away. Place was a bit more full upon leaving around 8:30, but not sure there was a wait then even. \n\nService was phenomenal, refilling water before our glasses were even half empty, and thanking us after doing so; very friendly all around. As soon as we were ready to order, someone was upon us to take our order, and similarly with finishing plates and our meal, with the check (though not in a pushy way). We ordered 2 entrees between the two of us, and being hungry, I was starting to regret not ordering an appetizer or salad as I looked jealously around, and then our food arrived in about 5 minutes anyway, wow. So fast.\n\nWe got:\n- Koo Kao Moo (pork leg stew over rice), with garlic rice: pork was incredibly tender and soft, easy to cut through with a fork. Fairly fatty, and quite a bit of skin, but well worth the indulgence. Almost ordered the dish as a noodle soup, but the waitress said this version was actually more famous, and no regrets. Garlic rice was new to me, and I loved it; very moist and flavorful. Came with a nice little sweet and spicy sauce too, which was spicier than it looked. \n- Broccoli with salted fish: Mostly broccoli, and only a little bit of salted fish, but damn was the salted fish good. Not much to say, but very salty and quite savory, each piece really melting in my mouth. A little sad with how little fish there was, but the pork serving was pretty generous, so didn't leave me too hungry. Broccoli was well done too, with some nice leaves, and the stems cut nicely into good-size pieces, and kept fairly firm, but flavorful, with a fairly light soy-like sauce. Garlic rice from the pork was great for soaking it up. \n\nPrices were pretty reasonable; not cheap, but not expensive. Maybe slightly pricier than other things in the immediate vicinity, but we're talking $2-3/dish, so not much. Only thing keeping me away is the location really, being a bit out of the way for me. Lots of salads, appetizers, and other dishes I would happily return to try. Wish I'd had a bigger party or more stomach space for it this time around.", "author": "Kris K."}

Compared to Chinese chive pancakes at dim sum places which are not vegetarian (it has dried shrimp). Just a tip for any veggie fan readers.\n\nThe larb pedd (minced duck salad) is too salty for my taste. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/dYZ5i05kqreT3OXdgSVHNQ/l\n\nKao mun gai (steamed chicken over garlic rice) is a simple good dish. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/XF3ho4jKNzFy9PInhRbBWg/l\n\nPork leg stew noodle soup is very popular. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/tVCqx8A-ozDwpBNL3WemAQ/l\n\nPork leg over rice, is less fatty than LRT's version. This is the same as \"pig knuckle\" from the Roli Roti cart, but without the bone and stewed. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/X5bUfMgi_Qumagq_M1j0gg/l\n\nRad na - choice of meat, Chinese broccoli, and flat noodles with gravy. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/I-E38Gey_Iy0NfOT8wYmIA/l Just FYI, Pad see ew is the non-soupy version of this dish.\n\nOn the specials menu - grilled skirt steak with house sauce. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/hoZvqE_pf3nXhnoqrDkyUw/l\n\nThere are 2 fried banana desserts, one with ice cream and one with honey and peanuts. I like the latter one best. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/wTAitRUOyy9ALVq1K4jO2A/l\n\nI don't think the roti dessert is that great, it's deep fried and oily. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/7mP8WusxNe2Jc7_YEMx8Rg/l Not bad, but Roti Kaya from Banana Island restaurant is best (that's the only item I recommend from that place).

Seriously. I am a huge curry fan and it was perfect. I have never had pumpkin curry before, so it was a pleasant surprise. Huge, dense, tender pieces of pumpkin, perfectly cooked veggies, and big pieces of chicken. The curry itself was delicious--a red curry that I ordered mild, and it was the perfect amount of spice. I found out last week that I was allergic to dairy, so I've been feeling a bit deprived in terms of good food. Seeing as this is made with coconut milk, as is traditional, I wasn't robbed of delicious comfort food. It hit the spot and the portion, for me at least, was huge! I was able to have it for lunch for two days afterward! Love, love, love.\n\nMy boyfriend was thrilled with his Pad See-Ew. It's his go-to dish at thai restaurants, so he's had it many times in many different ways. Here, however, he had the option to order it with a \"hot\" heat level... and his reaction was priceless!

What a find -- the food is awesome.\n\nPad Thai is probably the best I've had in the city.  It even has pieces of tofu that are soft and fresh -- not overfried, like so many places seem to do.  And they also used very fresh white meat chicken -- white-meat-chicken-snob that I am, it made me very happy.\n\nOddly, they don't have chicken satay here (she said they don't have there right cooking area for it(?)), so instead I had the crispy beef appetizer -- which was excellent. \n\nI liked it so much I went back two more nights.  First night I had their mild yellow chicken curry.  The curry was great -- but, for some reason, they used dark meat for the curry, so everything ISN'T white meat, like I had thought (so those like me, take note -- or maybe you can order the curry with white meat?).  \n\nThe time after that I had their beef chunk red curry (pa nang nuer).  Very good, although I have to say that this is one dish that I like better at Cha Am on Folsom, despite the fact that almost everything else on their menu doesn't hold a candle to Thai House Express.\n\nThey also have some cool drinks.  Thai Iced Tea, of course, with its usual greatness; but they also have mint lemonade, which is AWESOME!, very freshly made, and lychee iced tea, a cool variation.\n\nAnd finally, this place has a great-looking staff.  The women, the men, both on the serving floor and in the kitchen are all nicely dressed and well-coiffed, as well as  being geniunely friendly.\n\nBe forewarned that if you plan on eating here. it's NOISY!!   They need some soundproofing on the walls and ceilings.\n\nBut for a big Thai food fan like me, I was really happy to find this place.", "author": "Merrick W."}

The other places I've tried thus far when I've ordered \"medium\" curry, I've wound up with \"not at all spicy\" curry. This was much closer to what I would call medium, although perhaps a smidge on the mild side still. What really surprised me was the beef. I tend to be hesitant to get things with beef as a lot of the time it winds up being low quality and chewy/stringy. This was not at all the case! The beef was incredibly tender on the level that I normally associate with slow cooker or stew beef. It was great!\n\nThe one thing I'd improve is that there wasn't much curry sauce, but I think that might be because it splashed into the rice partition of the container and got absorbed.\n\nEither way, I really liked it and will definitely be ordering from here again.", "author": "Emily F."}

Good comfort food. Eating here is like having a long-lost friend find you, and give you a big hug. \nI should warn all of you that spicy here is VERY spicy. I usually order spicy food from all the Thai places I go to, but they take it to another level here. I was literally crying when eating my Tom Yum Soup, although that may be because it was the best Tom Yum Soup I have ever had. \n\nThings to Try:\n- Tom Yum Noodle Soup! Oh wow is this good. I have gotten this soup about five times now and it always leave me satisfied. As i mentioned this dish is ridiculously spicy but it is the perfect thing to get if you are feeling a bit sick. It comes with loads of shredded pork, pork balls, and your choice of noodle. There are quite a few choices when it comes to the noodles, but I usually get the wide rice noodles. Yum.\n\n- Pumpkin Curry! I have tried pumpkin curry at other places and this is my favorite. Nice big pieces of pumpkin, and I just love drizzling that curry sauce over everything I order. \n\n- Pad See Ew! A bit saucier than most places, but that is just the way I like it. Definitely a guilty pleasure for me. \n\n- Drinks! I went in there with my family and they accidentally brought us this minty/lemonade sort of thing and it was delicious. I have no idea what it was but I would get it again if I could figure out what it was. I think it is on their cocktail menu. They also have a few different types of wine too, if that is your thing. \n\nDid I mention that this place is open till midnight? I have called at 11:30pm before and they took my order, and even greeted me with a big smile when I picked it up.

I recently ordered from this place through EAT 24\n\nThey have either sent me the wrong items or made excuses that someone \"else\" packed up the food. Tonight when I ordered the food, I made all attempts to make sure that they had the \"right \"order. Not only was the food over 1 hour and 20 minutes late- the driver hands me a leaking, dripping, finger burning bag of food. I hadn't realized that it was dripping until I turned to go into my apt. The tom yum soup  I ordered has been poorly packed so it has spilled out all over the entire bag, ruining the contents of the rest of my meal. I have fish sauce smelling soup spilled all over my shoes, the hall way and my clothes. My amazement pertains to the driver- he had to have seen the dripping as it now stains the hallway leading to my apt door.  \n\nI am further amazed by the lack of customer service from the restaurant itself. When I called to complain about the late food and the damage,  they stated that they were late because they were busy and its raining, okay- I can understand that. The soup leaking- well someone must have packed it wrong- you think? That's your response? Its not his fault, but someone else's?\n\nNot, I am sorry that your dinner has been ruined and that your personal property is now damaged, what can we do? No, they tell me that Eat24 has to fix it and that they can't do anything. I presume they mean that they won't give me my  money back. \n\nAt this point I've gone from frustrated to just pissed off. Take ownership and even if its just empty words- just say it.... \"I'm sorry that you didn't receive the level of service you should have received, what can we do to make it up\" That alone would have diffused the situation and I would have probably chalked it up to an honest mistake.\n\nNow, I am just disgusted and annoyed and need to vent on YELP.

We wanted something yummy before the show and House of Thai was right outside our Motel 6 window....read the reviews and immediately called in our order. The lady was very nice on the phone and got everything down correctly. 10 minutes later we walked in, picked up our food (which was expertly packed for take out) trotted back to the motel and commenced to GRUB DOWN. The restaurant itself was clean and bright, with your standard import store decor. \nWe ordered the Pad Thai with chicken (the dish had tofu and shrimp in it by default--we wanted chicken too and there was lots of it!) I forgot to say \"medium heat/spice\" on the phone so i wasnt sure if it would be hot or not. It was NOT spicy--not even a little. Next time I'll definitely ask for a little heat, but its better to error on the side of \"not enough heat\" than to have a dish \"too spicy to eat\"....\nThe pad thai had great flavor and the tofu was very tender but kept its shape in nice little cubes. The chicken was sooooo tasty and the egg was AMAZING too (i love the egg in my pad thai--one of life's little perks!) Fyi, i didnt eat the shrimp--gave them to the BF. There were 3 big shrimp and he said they tasted good. The bean sprouts were placed on top of the dish--fresh and crunchy. (This was helpful, as i only like a few bean sprouts so i hate it when the sprouts are mixed with the pad thai noodles so I must rummage around my dish, pulling out sprouts. Its time consuming and looks janky...)  Props to House of Thai for putting them on top!! The sauce was great and stuck to the noodles, which were cooked perfectly. The pad thai gets a solid '4 stars'. I knocked off a star because i had to add chicken ($) and there was no spice.\nWe also got the #1 Golden Bag appetizer which was my fave thing about the meal. There were 5 deep fried, crunchy bags of goodness each tied with its own little deep fried tie wrapped around the top. The presentation was cool. I should've snapped a pic but ate those little fuckers pretty quick. They're made with minced chicken with excellent flavor, tiny potato cubes and green onion. YUUUMMMMERS.\nThese golden bags get '5 stars' as they were the highlight of the meal. \nAlso ordered a side of jasmine rice and sticky rice--- upon recommendation from another reviewer,  we got a side of peanut sauce to dip the sticky rice into. Jasmine was okay--not great--and the sticky rice was tasty. Btw, i think this was your standard thai sticky rice. They also had mango sticky rice on the menu, but, I'm fairly certain this was not the mango variety.  It was very good dipped in the peanut sauce.\nOne note about the peanut sauce: i was expecting a usual little side of peanut sauce. What i got was a container of sauce which i actually saved for the next day. I think it was around $4. Next time I'll either get more things to dip or pour the sauce over, OR I'll ask for just a couple little condiment-sized peanut sauce containers, rather than a CUP of sauce. \n(*Note* I would've loved some chicken skewers to go with the peanut sauce but i didnt see it anywhere on the menu and forgot to ask.)\nThe bill came to $28 and change (tipped $6) so...$35 out the door: a bit pricey for one main dish, one appetizer and 2 sides of rice BUT i did add chicken and of course, my small vat of peanut sauce.\nNext time we're near the Loin and craving some quick, tasty morsels, I'll definitely remember House of Thai and make a few small adjustments to my order. Overall, a nice thai experience", "author": "Lanie S."}

The wide range of exotic spices and flavors in our dishes were exciting. I enjoyed every bite here.\n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n1. Por Pier Sod (Fresh rice paper rolls stuffed with Chinese sausage, egg, tofu, and cucumber, topped with sweet and sour tamarind sauce): $7\n**LOVED this appetizer!! This was my favorite dish of the meal.\n\n2. Sai Oou (Deep-fried homemade Thai-style sausage served with Thai fresh chili, fresh ginger, peanut, cabbage, and red onion): $7\n**Interesting presentation. We ordered this because we were curious and it was recommended by our server. However, we didn't know how to properly eat it at first, so we had to ask our server =P. The sausage, chili, ginger, peanuts, & onions were arranged separately on the plate. I guess you're supposed to use the cabbage leaves and wrap all the ingredients together to create your own \"cabbage wrap\" (similar to \"lettuce wraps\"). The taste was interesting and VERY good, but it was too cumbersome to prep for eating.\n\n3. Pad Pak (Wok fried Mixed Vegetables w/side of Jasmine rice): $8\n**DELICIOUS! We added chicken to this stir fry. Soooo good. \n\n4. Thai House Beef (Marinated beef broiled to order; served with cilantro-tangy sauce over rice): $9\n**Tender, flavorful, thinly sliced beef. Loved the tangy cilantro sauce with the meat and rice.\n\n\nWe finished allllll the dishes!!! I was beyond full, but still wanted to eat because the food was just so good.\n\nStellar and attentive service. Our waiter checked up on us frequently and constantly refilled our waters & soft drinks when needed. Very nice staff.\n\nI definitely want to come back again the next time I'm in SF area!", "author": "Juliet Rachel C."}

Tasty.\n\nYup, those 3 words on the menu pretty much sum up Thai House Express!\n\nCame here STARVED after rushing around all day and I had another appointment in 2 hours :t Basically, I just wanted something filling, delicious, and fast that I could eat between appointments. Thai House Express to the rescue!!\n\nI got Pad King with chicken (sauteed with ginger, onion, bell pepper, carrot, jalapeno, and black fungus). EXACTLY what I needed to satisfy my growling belly! I literally waited less than 10 minutes and BAM! Food! Loved the flavors (ginger yum!!).\n\nThe workers here are so nice! I also really like the laid-back atmosphere here. Even though it seems like a restaurant-y place, there were actually a lot of people just sitting by themselves, reading the newspaper, working on papers, reflecting on life (?) Usually I get that kind of feeling from cafes, but I really liked that Thai House Express had a similar atmosphere. It can be awkward (and intimidating) going into a restaurant alone, but not here! :)\n\nYay! I need more Thai House Express in my life!", "author": "Kei H."}

And I would have to say that this is even BETTER than Rod Dee's. \n\nThis bowl of soup is the most perfect concoction and epitomizes why I love thai food. It's spicy, sour, fragrant, and even toasty at times, with an amalgam of textures of crunchy peanuts, ground pork, spongy fish cake, fresh sprouts and slippery noodles. (Yes, I did just use the word \"amalgam\")\n\nIt's not just a bowl of noodle soup, it's an experience. It's takes your senses for a delicious ride to Thailand and back. (My 4th grade teacher would had given me an \"A\" for this last cheesy sentence).\n\nThe reason it's better than Rod Dee's is this is even more balanced as far as the spicy and sour, and there is a toasty note in there at times - not sure what it is - toasted garlic, lemongrass or peppers perhaps? Whatever it is - it pushes it over into awesome-ville. \n\nOnly downside is I didn't feel like there were enough noodles - had about 3 slurps of noodles and the rest were sprouts.\n\nNevertheless, even that wasn't enough for me to take away a star. If you're a Tom Yum Noodle Soup fan, I highly recommend checking it out. It's definitely worth the trek through the loin'.", "author": "Bonnie H."}

The place was pretty packed, but the waitress immediately seated us by the corner. They had a TV with the giants game playing, which was definitely a plus for many.\nI found the menu to be solid, with your typical Thai restaurant dishes. We opted for the Spicy Green Curry and a Pad Kee Mao. They were very accommodating and allowed me to switch the bamboo shoots in the curry to eggplant. I really appreciated that.\nThe food came out promptly and portions were decent. I loved how there was enough of a kick to both dishes. The curry had plenty of meat and vegetables. We also ordered a thai iced tea, which was made well too. Not like the watered down ice teas that you get at some other thai places. \nOverall, I had a really good experience at Thai House Express, and I would definitely come back again to sample more of their dishes.", "author": "Helen Y."}

It's a comforting soup and feels very healthy, with light silver noodles and lots of veggies. The broth wasn't the most flavorful, but was mild and soothing for me. I ordered it with ground pork and liked the garlic flavor. It's good as a light meal if you want something warm. My bf ordered the pad see ew, which was very flavorful and just the right amount of saltiness. They were actually pretty generous with the veggies as well so I felt like it was a pretty well-balanced meal. I would say the portions aren't super huge and most people could probably finish it if they're hungry. The only downside is that the service is kind of lacking, since the place is so huge and the servers are just running around everywhere.", "author": "Jacqueline K."}

The first thing you will notice is the quality of the meat, it is unlike any other thai place I have ever patronized in any other city. The beef is juicy and cooked to perfection, the pork melts in your mouth and the seafood feels exquisitely fresh.\nThe noodle dishes and curries are consistently incredible. My favorite is the Pad See Ew with beef or the Red or Yellow Curry with chicken. The noodles are cooked perfectly and the combination of sauce, veggies and beef sings on your palate.\nThey are open late, inexpensive and good for groups. If you just want a quick meal after a long day they also do takeout and free delivery.

After studying abroad in Thailand, I admit I've become pretty picky about my Thai food.  In fact, I've simply avoided eating it for the longest time.  \n\nOn this particular day, my friend ordered the Pumpkin Curry while I ordered the Khao Soi.  Ever since I fell in love with it while in northern Thailand, since that is their specialty, khao soi has become something I order every time I see it on a restaurant's menu and no place has been able to recreate that same magic moment for me.  Even here.  I appreciate the attempt though.  All the ingredients were authentic in the dish but it just didn't taste the same.  Nevertheless, it tasted all right.  One note though: the crispy noodles on top were not crispy at all.  Moving on, the pumpkin curry that my friend had was what REALLY reminded me of what I had a in Thailand.  I had one taste and bam!  I was like, \"This is exactly what the curry tasted like when I had it on the streets in Thailand!\"  Spicy but sour with a funky kind of pungency.  Not how I like my food but definitely authentic.  \n\nI didn't have a chance to taste the other food, as the portions are generous.  But I still thought $10 for the pumpkin curry (w/o rice) is a little steep, while an order of plain jasmine rice is $1.50.  My khao soi was $8, which I thought was reasonable.  Overall, the meal was enjoyable.  Service could've been better as it was hard to get the waiters' attention when we were just one of two tables at the restaurant.  One final note: The prices on the website are not accurate.  Assume maybe a $.75 increase for some of their items.", "author": "Vanessa C."}

(More on the non-authentic noodles part later)\n\nMy friend and I stopped by today around 2:30 for a late lunch. I agree that 2:30 is rather late for lunch, but it's not too incredibly late. Anyway, they close at 3 (we didn't know that). We asked if we could still dine there since we had 25 minutes till 3:00 and they didn't look too busy. The waitress told us that they'd wait 5-10 mins for us if we didn't finish our meals before 3. Really, just 5-10 mins?!?! Granted this place is under a new management team, but come on here! We took our business down the street to Ler Ros Thai. Great food with great service there! The waitress at H.O.T. needs an attitude adjustment.\n\nAs for the authenticity part? Thai Boat noodles is usually made with a broth that is infused with herbs and blood. The blood gives the broth its depth and cloudy texture. I love the flavor of the soup and the noodles, but am not a fan of the blood. It doesn't taste like blood, but it's mind over matter I suppose. LOL.

My favorite is the pork belly, not a lot of places have this.\n\n\n\nPortions are kinda small IMHO.\nI think it's an expensive restaurant relatively speaking. A take out meal which is fairly small runs around $10. Plain rice. It probably makes more sense to eat in, with friends or a date and try different stuff, but then you have to consider that it's on the corner of Larkin and Geary. \n\nSo, that being said, there are lots and lots of festivities going on which make this an interesting dining experience. You'll see drug dealers, drug addicts, hookers, transsexual hookers, tweakers, drunks, even a midget hooker all walking by. You'll have to dodge them on your way in too, that corner being particularly gnarly, probably the gnarliest on Geary st. \n\nMind, its far from being dangerous,  it's in fact, very sad. \n\nHomeless people urinating and defecating in front of me while I eat aren't really my thing, i kinda feel sorry for them and i lose my appetite.\nIMHO the TL should be more about \"it's cheaper to eat out than make it myself\" restaurants, because no one want's to step into human excrement on their way to a fancy dinner, and have people take a dump on the sidewalk inches away from their plates right? Wrong, this is San Francisco. \n\nMy idea of a restaurant in an area such as this is Tu Lan. \n\n\n*Update\n\nCompared to other Thai restaurants, this one is actually really good.

After seated dived into ordering.\n\nPortion is a good size; I guess you can say average size, but definitely more than than your healthy serving size, haha! I ordered the pad see ew (go-to Thai noodle dish all the time, boring I know). \n\nOrdered my dish with tofu, added chili paste and I was good. Unfortunately there wasn't enough greens for me - I was kind of sad. Not sure if their tradition is more carbs than greens but yeah... Not enough.\n\nThe quality of the dish is great! Our dishes came out one-by-one within a 15 minute time frame, which was awesome! Instant, quality taste and price wasn't too shabby! \n\nIt's more expensive than most Thai places I been to, especially in SoCal but I know the living conditions are pricier here than LA.

A block or two (or more) down, I can understand. The corner of Geary and Larkin is quite busy and vibrant. If you're at any of the colorful bars in a 1 block radius, Thai House Express is one of the go to places to grab a bite in between drinks or even order delivery to the bar. Yes, it's also on the regular delivery rotation for bartenders in the area who are hungry while tapping the kegs or pouring stiff vodka tonics (and trying to get you to buy them a shot). \n\nMost of the food I've tried there is among the best Thai food I've had. I'll put it this way - I never even liked Thai food that much when living in New Jersey or New York City. Thai House Express and the other Thai places in the area have changed all that.  I tend not to venture too far from the same few dishes so I'll give the rundown of what I've had:\n\nPad Gra-Praw (w/ chicken) - One of my favorites. It's better with chicken than with beef as its more tender. I get the mild, which the average person would still consider spicy. I'd ask for extra mild but I'm Korean and it's already a blow to the ego to ask for mild. \n\nPad See Ew - Another favorite. I can't say it stands out head and shoulders beyond any other Pad See Ew I've had but it's definitely good.  I've always thought of Pad Thai and Pad See Ew as introductory dishes for those just getting to know Thai food. \n\nI've tried several of the curries and they've all been delicious.\n\nPineapple fried rice- another good choice. Not the best but worth ordering.\n\nTom Yum Soup - Probably one of the best places I've had Tom Yum Soup at.", "author": "Bern H."}

Yelpers seem to like them better than the one in Castro.\n\nFirst off, the servers looked really tired and unhappy. I don't think I saw any one of them smile. Maybe they had just gone through lunch rush (this was about 2pm) but yeah I felt all sad. Our server brought us water.. and mine just happens to have a piece of long hair in it. Already it's a great start. \n\nNo matter. It's just hair.. it's organic! We order the calamari for appetizer. It tasted fishy and was too chewy. One of the worst I've ever had. For main dish, my partner had the Pad Thai. It was one of the better Pad Thai's I've tasted, so yay for that. I had the Kao Pad Nam, fried rice with cured pork sausage and chinese broccoli. The sausage was .. different. Not my favorite dish. It was too spicy for a medium spice so all I could taste was hot not other flavors (except for the distinctive sausage). \n\nThere are just too many other Thai places in this area of town and in SF generally.

However, since I yelp a lot on my free time, I heard plenty of good things about Thai House Express so we were more than happy to dine here for dinner. Coming to this area (Tenderloin) is already a dangerous adventure itself - so we were hoping our taste buds would be on a better on.\n\nMy friend ordered #41 ($7.95): rice noodles topped with fish and shrimp balls, tofu, squid, and shrimp on a bed of spinach. Overall, this dish was just ok. The sauce was a thick, light pink sauce that had a hint of tomato; it was too sweet and slightly salty for my taste. And if I remember correctly, there was only one shrimp in the dish. -_-\n\nI ordered #68 ($7.25): pan-fried noodles with chicken, egg, squid, and peanuts. I wanted to try something new, but it resembled very similarly to pad see ew. I was not too excited about this dish, because there was barely any squid or chopped peanuts. It tasted just like pad see ew, without the broccoli. I would have been better off ordering a noodle soup dish or pad thai.\n\nThe food wasn't bad - we both just kind of wish we ordered different dishes. The service isn't the best either, but they did refill our cups of water every twenty minutes or so. Last but not least, this place can get a bit loud. Is it just me or was my voice echoing off the walls of the restaurant? I found myself talking above \"in-doors voice level\".\n\nBrownie points for being authentic. They write in Thai!

Finally decided to pay this place a visit.  We got there early, around 6pm - place was empty, but we didn't mind.  \n\nAgain, we ordered Yelp recommended dishes:\n\n(1)  Pork leg stew/soup with noodles - it comes with pickled vegetables, bean sprouts.  Taste-wise it was kinda unique, just because it's a bit sour, but salty at the same time without either being too overpowering.  I was disappointed though the soup was warm, and not hot.  IMO, the soup should always be hot especially when served with noodles.  You can have a choice of noodles, and we chose the flat rice noodles... I must say that the noodles came out broken (not good).  The pork leg was tender and fell off the bones, but beware, it's very fatty.\n\n(2) Pad Thai - they claim on the menu that they have the best Pad Thai, voted by the Bay Guardian, so I had to give it a try.  I must say that their Pad Thai is one of the best I've tasted.  The taste was just perfect - best yet, was that the noodles were moist, not dry and full of flavor.  It was not oily, not too sour - perfectly done!  I really loved their Pad Thai.  \n\nTheir portions were not that big so believe it or not, we were still hungry after eating the 2 dishes, so my hubby ordered a Pad See Ewe to go, just in case we get hungry later on.  Their Pad See Ewe was not as great as the Pad Thai. First of all, it was very burnt, and very, I mean VERY oily.   I've had better Pad See Ewe in King of Thai than this place... \n\nOverall, if you go there, just ordered the Pad Thai.

Came here for a midnight snack after rock climbing with coworkers, and would definitely come back!\n\nUpdate 9/2016:  Cross-posting dish reviews from my \"House of Thai 2\" review:\n\n---- DRY NOODLES ----\n\nPad See Ew:  5 stars\nYummy, they have the sweet sticky soy sauce down! Reminiscent of the best fried carrot cake dishes in Singapore.\n\nPad Thai:  4.5 stars\n\nKao Soy:  2.5 stars\nI just really didn't like the texture of these steamed egg noodles, perhaps it's just personal preference.  The curry sauce was okay but chicken strips were dry.  The best part of this was the crispy noodle bits they served on the side.\n\nRad-Na:  3 stars\nWide flat rice noodles in lots of gravy, but the gravy is so salty!  I would've loved to drink all the sauce otherwise.  And the chicken (cut in thin strips) was pretty dry.\n\n---- NOODLE SOUPS ----\n\nBeef Noodle Soup:  3.5 stars\nDelicious beef balls, lots of other fatty beef and organs.  Good for when I'm ill and need a hearty soup.  Asked for reduced salt.\n\nDuck Noodle Soup:  4 stars\nI asked for reduced salt / MSG and it still turned out super flavourful.  Duck meat was delicious and juicy, we couldn't stop though we were stuffed.  They give so much duck meat, this lasts me two meals when I order it delivery.\n\nPork Leg Stew Noodle Soup:  4 stars\nDelicious soup and fatty pork leg!  Again, reduce the salt.\n\nChicken Noodle Soup:  5 stars\nOkay, HOLD UP.  How have I been ordering food from here for over 2 years and this is my first time getting this?  If you have eaten in the hawker centres / food courts of Singapore growing up, you will recognise this familiar, pure chicken broth taste it is amazing and reminds me of home.  Many Thai / Vietnamese / Americanised Chinese soups I've tried skew too sweet or too salty, but this has the perfect balance and the chicken flavour shines through.  The chicken is just boiled chicken but still better than the chicken that comes with rice and noodle dishes.  Gosh I would eat this every week--when I'm craving a legitimate Asian flavour, when I want something light, when I'm feeling under the weather.  It's more \"bland\" than the other noodle soups so if you want something really salty, get the Duck Noodle soup and if you want a punch of flavour get the Tom Yum soup.  But if you know what's up -- get this chicken noodle soup.\n\n---- OTHER SAVOURY DISHES ----\n\nChicken Satay:  3.5 stars\nSurprisingly good and tender, but not as flavourful or chewy as Singaporean marinated satay of course.\n\nPed Yang: 3.5 stars\nTheir duck is fantastic, but why get this when you can get the duck noodle soup?\n\nKao Pad Gang Khew: 4 stars\nGreen curry paste fried rice. Yummy and flavourful rice, but the chicken strips were a bit dry.  Their pork in general is better than their chicken.\n\nYellow Curry Chicken:  3.5 stars\nStandard.  Satisfying.\n\nPineapple Fried Rice:  4 stars\nPineapple chunks, cashews, egg, onions, even raisins and carrots up in your rice.  Sometimes you're just craving it.

It is duck so there are certainly fatty pieces, not for those on a strict diet!\n\n* Kao Soy - One of my favorite dishes. Simple yellow chicken curry over egg noodles and mustard greens, topped with crunchy noodle strands. They don't skimp on the curry here and there's plenty for extra egg noodles that can be added to the order.\n\n* Beef Noodle - The nice and strong flavored broth made this a delicious comfort food.

Some of their delivery staff are fine. Some have a habit of making you come downstairs to the front door of the apartment building to get your food. One of the better delivery servers told us that the reason they do this is out of laziness; plus, the more places they can deliver to, the more money they make.\n\nFinally, we started to leave special instructions with the restaurant for the delivery people to call us from the keypad downstairs and we would buzz them in.\n\nTonight, in spite of our instructions, the delivery person called from a cellphone. We told him to hang up and call from the keypad downstairs. He ignored us and called on the keypad again. We decided not to leave a tip, whereas we ordinarily leave 15%, which I understand is the standard for delivery.\n\nI went downstairs and looked around and there was no one around. I went back upstairs. The delivery person called again using his cell phone. I went back downstairs and got the food, not leaving a tip.\n\nShortly after, the delivery person called us again, asking if we had made a mistake not tipping him. I explained to him why we had not tipped him. He told me he had had to move his car because the police were about to ticket him, that he needed the money because he had a new baby, etc, and that he wouldn't be delivering to us anymore.\n\nNow, the average customer would no doubt consider it the height of gall to threaten lack of future service for not tipping, but I don't necessarily. I was in the restaurant business for 20 years, as a busser, as a waiter, and even as a delivery person. If our delivery person had followed instructions and called from the keypad and delivered the food to our door, and I had not tipped, my opinion is that he would have been justified in complaining. That's how the guy makes his money and he deserves to be paid...IF he does his job. My problem with this guy is that he doesn't want to do his job and he still wants to get paid.\n\nWe called the restaurant to complain but there was no manager to speak to.\n\nI am writing this review in the hope that the restaurant owners will properly train their delivery people in the future to avoid losing business.", "author": "Michael K."}

It was just very sour, which could be good or bad depending on what you like.\n\nI thought the Pad Thai was pretty good at first, but then I tasted a weird aftertaste. I realized after a few bites that it was a really fishy aftertaste. I've NEVER tasted fishyness in any Pad Thai dishes from Thai restaurants I've ordered from, and this first time was not pleasant!! It was gross!!\n \nPortion-wise, I think it's decent for the price you pay. Not the best, but not bad either. I was filled up when I was done with my Pad Thai, but I can get full easily and I ate a snack not so long before I ate dinner.\n\nService was great.

They serve some Lao dishes, such as papaya salad and laab. However, one day I saw a sign at the door, written in Thai, that says \"Red shirt supporters not welcomed.\" I was horrified that this restaurant would say such a thing. \n\nIf you are not familiar with the red shirts and yellow shirts situation, allow me to summarize it here. The red shirts make up mostly of the rural Thais who are the majority in Thailand. They elected a very popular Prime Minister (Taksin) . However, the yellow shirts (the color of the King), who make up of mostly Bangkok elites; benefit from the system and are tied to the royal court, did not like that the rural people actually have a say. The yellow shirts believe that the red shirts are \"poor\" and \"uneducated\" country bumpkins not worthy of making the right decisions, thus the red shirts should not allowed to vote. \n\nThe yellow shirts blocked Bangkok airport for a week, ousted Primister Taksin with the support of the army and replaced him with Mr. Abisit. The red shirts were not happy with the military-supported new Prime Minister, so they staged a peaceful protest in the middle of Bangkok. The Military arrested their leaders, openly shot at the unarmed villagers. It was a massacre that many western countries, including the US, turned a blind eye. \n\nThe media has been censored. All media outlets: radio and tv stations, newspaper and websites of the red shirts have been shut down, while the yellow shirts' media outlet could run freely.  Not sure what will happen next, election? Unlikely because the red shirt will vote someone into power again. \n\nDO NOT SUPPORT THIS ESTABLISHMENT for wanting to take democracy away from rural Thai people.

Pretend you can't finish it all (you don't want to seem like a hungry pig even though you actually are) and take the rest home in a box. Get in your apartment door and finish the rest post haste. \n\nSo far, Thai House Express has won me over as my favorite Thai place in SF. Plus, this location is in the TL so if you get a seat by the window you will get a free show as well. I think the show is called \"This is why you should avoid drugs in rock form or in needles.\" Yeah, long show name but you get my point.", "author": "Liz M."}

The service is great and the food comes out quick. It's now open later too. It's clean and decor simple but modern.\n\nWhat I order if it's a group or just me and a friend (I gotta get it all in!) :  thai ice tea, Tom yum soup, pad Thai, green salmon curry, papaya salad, sometimes larb, beef penang, pineapple fried rice, fried pork, and for dessert, roti with coconut ice cream and fried bananas with vanilla ice cream. To die for!\n\nBeware now, this place is in the tenderloin which means you have to be cautious. At night all the prostitutes and drug dealers come out. Frankly, it's scary!

In San Francisco, I always recommend Thai House Express.  The food is fast, authentic, delicious, and as spicy as I want it to be.  \n\nI went there last week with my wife, brother, and parents, and Thai House Express delivered again.  We ordered a variety of Thai dishes and the food was out within 5 minutes, even though the restaurant was pretty full.  The Larb Duck salad was the perfect combination of sour, spicy, and salty, and the duck was not too fatty, like at some places.  I didn't have the raw-ish shrimp salad, but my family members enjoyed it.  \n\nWe also shared the Yen Ta Fo (Thai red soup) and Duck Noodle soup, which were both delicious.  The red soup is not something you can get at most Thai restaurants, but it's a family favorite.  We also had the basil chicken (my wife's favorite), the basil crispy pork (my favorite) and the Gai Kua noodles (my dad's favorite).  The first two dishes were nice and spicy, just like we asked for it, and exactly what we were looking for.  My dad has never found a better version of those noodles at any other Thai restaurant in the Bay Area. \n\nThe service was great, the food was amazing, and we left with leftovers.  I will not hesitate in continuing to recommend Thai House Express in the future.", "author": "Pilan C."}

This was EXCELLENT.  The rice paper had the perfect texture...not too flimsy or too hard from being undercooked.  I was initially hesitant on the tamarind sauce but it was light and sweet--usually it's too sour.  I definitely recommend that you get this.\n\nBeef Noodle Soup (noodle soup with sliced beef, beef balls, beef strew & tripe) - This was ok.  I probably wouldn't order it again.  The bf thinks there might be some MSG in it.  With noodle soups, you can get them with flat rice noodles, rice stick noodles, vermicelli or egg noodles.  I got flat rice noodles for both this and the dish below and they were great.\n\nTom Yum Noodle Soup (hot spicy noodle soup with ground pork, slice pork, pork balls and peanuts) - If you are pretty good with spiciness, GET THIS IN MEDIUM.  This was my favorite dish out of all the ones we ordered.  It has such a deep and rich flavor.  And the peanuts and cilantro make the noodles smell so fragrant.  I'm normally not a fan of anything tom yum but this has changed me forever.\n\nKao Ka Moo (special pork leg stew over rice) - Very similar to my dad's Chinese style pork feet dish!!  The only difference is that incredibly spicy chili sauce that comes on the side.  Use the sauce but do NOT eat the chilis--my mouth was burning for 5 minutes straight and I almost cried when I realized I had no milk in my fridge.  This is a huge portion--lots of pork and lots of rice--so be hungry.  It comes with a side of pickled veggies.\n\nThai House Beef (marinated beef broiled to order; served with chef's secret sauce) - The \"secret sauce\" is actually cilantro based and almost belongs in a Mexican restaurant.  It does go well with it.  The beef was tender and I'm thinking it would've tasted better in the restaurant; our 30 minute drive home probably dried it out a little.\n\nOrdering and getting take-out only took about 15 minutes total!

Take out is a great way to skip the line and the (reasonably) slower service during dinner when the house is packed. \n\nTheir new weekend breakfast menu (7-10:30AM, Sat/Sun) isn't strictly Thai, but rather a mix of American, Mexican, and a little Thai.

Strong, rich, and awesome, unexpectedly perhaps the best coffee aside from Philz. \n\nCareful with ordering dishes spicy, they're not kidding around with that.

The papaya salad is delicious -- very flavorful, and no holding back on the shrimp flavor. They do spicy just right. Just note their level of spicy starts on an Asian not Western level, so order medium or mild if you can't handle it.\r\n\r\nMy favorite dish is the Tom Yum soup with thin rice noodle. They really do it right here, and give this soup the kind of attention given to Vietnamese Pho. The broth, levels of flavor and garnishes are sublime. Order this dish when you're craving noodle soup on a crisp day. \r\n\r\nTheir dried beef appetizer is also very good, as are the fish cakes. Steer clear of the chive dumpling -- pretty unexciting. And don't bother ordering Chinese style dishes on the menu, go for their specialties and Thai dishes. I've seen many Vietnamese and Thai restaurants add Chinese style dishes to their menus to appease the kind of customer that equates most Asian cuisines to Chinese food.\r\n\r\nA good sign of a restaurant is checking out the patrons. Thai House has a good number of Asian customers mixed with in-the-know Westerners. The restaurant is stylish, clean and spacious, considering the busy Larkin & Geary corner. And if it matters, the bathrooms are always clean. \r\n\r\nNext to Sai Jai on O'Farrell, Thai House is my go-to Thai in this neighborhood.

I grew to enjoy this place having lived in the neighborhood the past few years.  The food is consistently of good quality, the service friendly, and the restaurant clean.  Often, I get takeout from here. My favorite dishes are Gang Garee Gai (chicken and potatos in a coconut curry) and the Barbeque Chicken.  It used to be this was pretty dry and over-salted, but they seem to have juiced up the recipe and it is much tastier.  I usually get the a la carte as it comes with 5 pieces of chicken (a leg, a wing, thigh and two breasts).  I also like the Cucucmber Salad for 3 bucks.  \n\nThey did raise their prices a year ago or so, which had me miffed.  Over $10 for Asian take out just doesnt seem right.  Now, I concede inflation has taken a hit on everything so I guess that is the world we now live in.  \n\nI do wish they served Angel Wings (stuffed chicken wings) but apparently they take alot of effort to make.  For that, you can go down to O'Farrell and check out Sai Jai Thai.  Overall, my experience has been consistently good.", "author": "Ethan R."}

Its yummy thai comfort at its finest. \nPrices I think are reasonable, portions are also at least to me really good, but it depends on what you order. \nAnd you cant beat the location, right in the middle of Tenderloin Heights where if you get a window seat, you can see drug dealers, hookers, escaped mental patients,  homeless people ( and on a lucky day , they will walk into the restaurant and greet you !) \nBut fear not, the Police cars are always there, and if they're not, its because they are eating at Little Henry's, one short block away\nGreat Thai food in one of the most active parts of San Francisco.

Thai House Express is a favorite.  They have great food and had really late night hours (they close at midnight now - boooooooo!).  I brought my last boyfriend here and he loved it.

They make a really tasty Larb (I like chicken best).  #40 Kao Ka Moo - Pork Leg Stew over Rice - I am a sucker for braised meat and this is fantastic!   Along the same lines is #43 - Kao Moo Dang which is roasted pork over rice with this yummy gravy saucy stuff.  My most favorite thing is #72 Kao Pad Nam - the waitress might try to persuade you not to order this dish as it features a Thai sausage that apparently most American eaters do not like.  .do not listen to her. . .it's so delicious!

In the case of choosing where to have dinner last week, #1 necessitated that the restaurant be somewhere near Nob Hill, #2 ruled out any of the fabulous Indian/Pakistani restaurants in the area because that could have spurned some awkward DYL encounters, and #3 pointed me to Yelp. My weird ESP thing must have kicked in because I was drawn to Lainie L's review of Thai House Express. Based on some of the review's recommendations and our own cravings, we ordered:\n\n- Tom Yum Goong: this traditional Thai soup was most definitely hot (if this was \"medium,\" I think my tongue would have fallen off for \"hot\") and sour, additionally flavored with lemongrass and galanga. . Thai House Express is quite generous with the prawns and straw mushrooms, which is always a plus. \n\n- Larb Pedd (duck salad): listed on the Specials whiteboard, not on the regular menu. Larb is a meat salad usually made with ground chicken, pork, or beef and seasoned with chilis, onions, cilantro, and a tart dressing usually made of lemon and fish sauce. Larb pedd switches things up with minced roasted duck (including the skin!). Larb is one of my favorite Southeast Asian dishes because it embodies the intense complexity of flavors that can spring from the amalgamation of very simple ingredients. Thai House Express delivered the promise of hot, sour, savory, cool, crunch. The duck was especially delightful as the backdrop because it added an extra layer of complexity with the fat and crisp of the duck skin. In terms of spiciness, we ordered it medium and THE did not insult us by giving us the toned down version of \"medium.\" Yowza!\n\n- Pad Thai: okay, okay. So, pad thai is one of those dishes that foodies scoff at plebians for ordering at Thai restaurants. But it is also one of those things that can serve as a measuring stick across restaurants because it's guaranteed that they will all have it! Not to mention that the menu noted that THE's pad thai was voted the Best of the Bay by the SFGuardian. I normally am very skeptical of these accolades (especially in Boston; never trust \"Best of Boston\"), but my preconceptions were proven wrong! This was some DAMN good pad thai...the noodles just the right firm texture, the chicken tender and plentiful, the bean sprouts providing a refreshing contrast, the peanuts giving a nice salty crunch, and most importantly - the not-too-sweet sauce completely coating the whole package. This was no wimpy, half-assed pad thai. Amen.\n\n- Fried Roti w/ Coconut Ice Cream: ahh, the Clincher. Sooj O. recounts the experience with this dessert much better than I could. But let me reiterate that we started out with one order and proceeded to devour a second after the obligatory \"Oh, I don't know...should we?\" Interestingly, the roti's texture was different with each serving (one was much more flaky, while the other was more chewy - indicative of differences in the frying time). However, it was still freakin' good and that coconut ice cream was so rich and creamy that I was completely oblivious to the possible lactarded consequences.\n\nFive stars for the excellent food and the excellent prices. Extra snaps to Thai House Express for the SUPER FAST, friendly service and for being one of the few clean, spacious places in Lower Nob Hill/Tenderloin. If you, too, are a lazy Yelper in search of a place to go, I hope that you used your minimal energy to read this review and trust my judgment enough to get out to Thai House Express!", "author": "Steph P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-23", "description": "I have become all about this restaurant these last few weeks.  It's a new favorite.  I still particularly adore the Tom Kha Gai.  As a child, I ate tons of this stuff called Lucas.  It's a little shaker full of chili powder, citric acid, salt, and a little sugar.  The overwhelming sour/salty flavor gave me this visceral flavor high when I ate it.  Same with the Tom Kha Gai.  The intensity is almost too much, but it's exquisite.\n\nPad Kee-Mao (#66, spicy noodles with Chinese broccoli) is another favorite of mine.  The Pad King (#76, choice of meat with ginger, carrots, jalapeno, and black fungus) is great for anyone who loves ginger.  I just tried the Gang Panang Nuer (#52, beef in red curry) last night.  It was fantastic and may be my new favorite curry.  The beef had zero fat or gristle.  I've also tried the Roti dessert with ice cream.  It was flaky and wonderful, but I thought the ice cream didn't really mesh with the pancake.  I think it would have been better with some sweetened creme fraiche or as an appetizer with curry dipping sauce.  On its own, however, the coconut ice cream totally rocked.  I've only tried about five different varieties, but this was the best.  \n\nI do have to mention the Por-Pier Sod (#2, rice paper rolls stuffed with sausage, egg, tofu, and cucumber, topped with crab meat and sour tamarind sauce).  It was actually revolting.  I expected a regular cool, refreshing rice paper roll.  What I got was two giant rolls served side by side like a couple of burritos, cut into slices crosswise.  They were served warm (!?!) and were drenched in this gross sweet gravy.  They were disgusting and impossible to eat.  I also dislike their Por-Pier Pak (#4, vegetarian egg rolls).  And their Peak Gai Tod (#9, fried chicken wings) just tasted weird.  Boyfriend joked that maybe they were from Thai chickens and while absurd, it rang true.\n\nEven though I disliked those three dishes, I still adore Thai House Express.  And it's like magic- even though most their dishes cost the same $7-$8 that many other places do, the bill always comes to surprisingly little.  I don't want to know how, I just want to enjoy it.

Remembering the admonishments of Librarian Bella, I didn't start a new thread but actually used the search function and found a thread on best restaurants in the Tenderloin.  Based on that, we narrowed it down to two Thai restaurants.  Seeing Pengrin's photo of the fried roti, I knew we had to eat here.\n\nAs usual, it's great to hang out with Steph.  And the jolliness was made jollier by Kainani visiting SF.  What a gal!  She's rocking SF (I am too old...can't keep up with her).  I was way too full from my mega lunch pho, and could only try little bites of the main courses which were duck salad and chicken pad thai.  The duck salad was amazing, absolutely delightful little bits of duck, red onion slices, and a spicy hotness that builds up and permeates the palate.  I give Thai House Express credit for making one of the least gloppy and more interesting Pad Thais I've had in my life thus far.\n\nThe dessert: okay, so despite my pho-fullness, I was doing all my efforts to digest so that I could eat the dessert.  And am I glad I held back on all the other courses.  Soooo goooood.  Fried roti, crispy with the sort of nice texture that comes sometimes from fried sweet rice.  I am not sure what they made their roti with, but that's what it reminded me of.  And the coconut ice cream went so well with it.  Originally we had ordered one to share...midway through:\nSteph: I could eat more of this. \nMe: Should we order another?\nKainani: I can stop eating it now (putting down her spoon).\nMe: I want more.

The Gai Yang was probably the least tasty of the four because the chicken was pretty dry.  The Pad Se-ew was okay, as was the red curry chicken.  The best dish of lunch was the Moo Prig King, which was absolutely awesome- the chili paste added just the right amount of heat to the sauce and the green beans were tender yet crisp.

When the last item came\nout it was wrong, instead of green curry we got red. After about another minute we asked just to cancel because we didn't want to wait anymore. Approached manager or something who was curt and said it was coming in two minutes, and they already re-fired our order so just wait. OK, except she proceeded to tell us how we ordered wrong, my husband eats at this place about 3 times a week and always orders the same thing- green salmon curry. So I told the woman, no actually the server got it wrong she is proceeded to wave her arms and got real angry and told me no and she wasn't going to talk about it. Salmon comes out seconds later, they basically just re-plated the red sauce one, which is fine because it still tasted ok, but if you are gonna tell me you re-fired my order when you just replated it what else are you doing with the food? Salmon overcooked and didn't taste fresh but the eggplant was excellent. Also sever never brought our change was like a war or attrition we just said forget about it and left. Sad because this place was convienient for hubby but he did say the service was always kinda lame but this was last straw.", "author": "Charla R."}

First off, thai food is my favorite kind of food. I love all food, but thai is that perfect combination of spicy, tasty, comfort and just pure contentment and satisfaction.\n\nThis is not the best thai I've ever had, but it is the best I've had in SF. Incidentally, the best thai food I've ever had (outside of bangkok, thailand) was in Ithaca, NY and Fairbanks, Alaska and not in places like New York City or LA! \n\nFor food this place definitely beats out other SF favorites Thep Phanom, Osha, Yukol Palace and Marnee. That said, it is in the Tenderloin and as a result has a gritty bare bones ambience. My favorite dishes are any of the curries (especially the green), the stir fries (minced chicken with basil, peppers, and green onion), and the pork leg stew which will make you feel oh-so-cozy...as good as hot chocolate by a warm fire! I'm not a huge soup fan, but I've tried them here and they're good too.\n\nThe lack of the fifth star is for the lack of ambience and the slightly sketchy location; but this adds to the character. Besides, this food isn't associated with posh or loungey decor anyway. I go out of my way to get take out here at least once a week. \n\nGive this place a shot if you want intensely flavored, tasty thai food.", "author": "Alexander S."}

Hmm...\n\nBut reaching Thai House Express was like finding a \"diamond in the rough\" as that saying goes. The place was fairly quiet since we arrived roughly around 6:30; I'm convinced now that most San Franciscans choose to eat out for dinner around 7 or so. Anyway, we were promptly seated, our orders were taken, and food was served in less than ten minutes. But it wasn't like they were trying to usher us out quickly; the atmosphere itself is mellow and relaxing. Dim lights, moderate level of noise. We stuck around for around an hour or so (our usual time to eat dinner and sit and chat), and the servers didn't seem to be in a hurry to get us out the door.\n\nThe food was pretty good; piping hot and full of flavor. We ordered Chan Pad Poo (#38), which is stir fried spicy Thai noodles with Dungeness crab meat, egg, and green onions. I was able to choose how spicy I wanted the noodles, and I opted for \"hot\"; wasn't as spicy as I'd like it, but it still had a good kick. We also ordered Gang Ga-Ree Gai (#50), which was sliced chicken in a mild yellow curry paste with potatoes. The curry sauce accidentally splashed on my shirt a little, but that was fine with me (yay for Thrift Town clothes!). We were both scarfing down the food pretty quickly, due to both our hunger and how delicious the food was.\n\nThai House Express's menu itself is pretty extensive: over 100 menu items, with a good selection of appetizers, salads, soups, noodles, and even a decent sized selection of vegetarian dishes. Prices are a little more on the \"expensive\" side of Thai food, but two people can still manage to polish off a meal (with dessert) at $25 or so.\n\nDessert was either Roti (Thai sweet pancake) or the ever-popular, ever-common Fried Banana with ice cream. We opted for the Roti with Coconut ice cream, which was a good choice to sweeten and round out the meal. We both left Thai House Express feeling very satisfied with our meal.\n\nI certainly wish Thai House Express was not located in the TL though, since I usually prefer not to dine in that area of town.....oh well, at least I wasn't dining alone. =)", "author": "Helene K."}

Pity.\n\nNow, I'm not expecting fine-dining, white-tablecloth service at a place like this. Far from it. But it could be described here as lackadaisical at best. I wasn't given a menu when I sat down, and waited and waited for one to appear. Finally, I gave up and got one myself. My water glass sat empty for a long time, and nobody ever came back to check on me once the food came out. All this in a near-empty establishment. \n\nI ordered the Pra Ram, which is a dish that comes with vegetables, peanut sauce, and your choice of meat. I ordered the chicken. Unfortunately, it was very unappealing visually. The chicken had been cut into thin strips and then boiled, which lent it a disturbingly pale and rubbery appearance. On top of these snowy white strips was a gluey, orange-brown sauce. A few vegetables hid beneath the chicken. I took a bite and was overwhelmed by the sweetness of the peanut sauce. I had to add heaping teaspoons of dried chili flakes to make it tolerable. Obviously, I ordered the wrong thing here.\n\nThe final straw came after I'd eaten maybe one-third of it and found a hair in my food. Blech.\n\nNot wanting to start any kind of hassle - clearly, the staff here could care less about my experience - I paid the bill and left. \n\nSo here's the deal. Anyone who knows me knows that my mom is Thai. I was born in Bangkok, and have spent a lot of time in Thailand. While that doesn't make me an expert by any means, perhaps I'm more critical than some. Besides the obvious fact that there was a hair in my food (and let's be fair, it happens sometimes), I didn't like my dish at all.\n\nThai House Express earns an extra star because I'm guessing that it was all just a fluke.

The Thai beef jerky was an incredible surprise, and if you're looking for something basic, i'd go with the Pad Kee Mao. It comes super spicey, so if you're not into that, make sure to ask for mild. The Larb is amazing as well. \n\nI also highly recommend the mint lemonade. But be prepared to order two, and at around $4 if you're on a budget, I'd just avoid them all together.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-22", "description": "Thai House was a bit of a disappointment.  Four stars?  I don't think so.  It's more like a Thai diner than it is a restaurant, with an inhospitable dining room, loud and echoey, cold and complacent.  Given the mediocrity of most Thai restaurants in the Bay Area, Thai House is better than many of them, but that doesn't make it exceptional.\n\nOn the positive side, I didn't detect MSG -- which is not to say they don't use it, but if they do, it wasn't overbearing.  It's also open until midnight, which may have something to do with its loyal ratings considering that there aren't many options at that time of night in San Francisco or beyond.\n\nThe food was okay.  It wasn't great, but it wasn't terrible.  I ordered the vegetarian spring rolls as an appetizer, which were full of a variety of vegetables and noodles.  They were also nicely plump, more of a hybrid between a Chinese spring roll and a Thai one.  The flavor was a little funky, though, and I would attribute it to the possibility of over-used oil.  Nothing rancid, mind you, but influenced by the flavors and aromas of what came before.  \n\nMy entree was a red salmon curry, Thai spicy.  The salmon was overcooked.  The red curry was flat, with no zest or body.  It was not spicy either.  When I order a Thai curry, I usually ladle the curry over whatever rice I have left to enjoy the remaining richness.  Here, I was not so inclined.  No brown rice option either, and while I usually love white Jasmine rice (even though I always opt for brown, if available), this tasted more like Uncle Ben's.\n\nThe service was terrible.  While the food comes out quickly -- very quickly -- the servers were neither attentive nor responsive.  It took about fifteen minutes to flag a waitress to take my order, and despite several requests for my bill, no one brought it.  \"Anything else?\"  -- \"Just the check.\"  But then they'd go about their business as if I weren't there.  Weird.\n\nThe ambiance doesn't exist.  \nThe service -- or what one would call what I observed -- was terrible.\nThe food was okay, but certainly nothing to write home about.\n\nIf I were writing only about the food, it'd be 2. stars.\nAmbiance is 1 star.\nService is 1 star.\n\nOverall:  1.5 stars.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

I am rating it solely on the food, because if I were to take into consideration the location and the scary local population, the score would drop slightly, as it is located in the unsavory Tenderloin. But the food always brings me back.\n\nI have only ever eaten maybe three different main courses because what they do well, MAN do they do it well. Their Tom Kha soup is delicious, spicy and smooth. I like to get it with tofu rather than chicken because I think the texture works better, and the tofu absorbs the coconut milk and matches well with the straw mushrooms, cabbage, and greens. \n\nWith it, I always get the Chan Pad Pu, which used to only be on the specials menu, but is now integrated into the regular menu, and I would like to think it is because it is absolutely transcendent. I usually prefer the chow fun noodles, but this is cooked with the thinner Pad Thai style noodles in a kind of creamy tamarind sauce, and it has LUMP CRAB MEAT in it. I believe it's Dungeness crab, and every single time I have ordered it (which is many, many times), there have been giant pieces that are sweet and moist and exquisite.\n\nI have also have a variety of their appetizers, all of which have been good. Their naked shrimp are interesting, and I enjoy their fried egg rolls, though they are nothing special. Their papaya salad is pretty tasty, as is their squid salad, and they cook their squid very well. \n\nI have never experienced rudeness among the waitstaff, and although they are a bit brusque, they have never said anything rude to me, and my food always came out in a timely manner. I wish it would just move to a safer location because it's always a little harrowing to walk there either from BART or my car.", "author": "Mea H."}

The work required to get meat out of the small shelly sections of crab leg is daunting but worthwhile.\n\nPork leg stew rice plate: The meat was taken off the bone, very tender, some flavorful skin but more would've been nice. Served with a crazy-delicious garlic chili oil for dipping, which pushes it slightly ahead of the version I had at Da Nang (also in Albany). Apparently there's a noodle soup version of this on the specials board sometimes: the Holy Grail of noodle soups.\n\nEach dish was about seven bucks. So which is better, Ruen Pair or this?

That alone should make you get your ass to Thai House Express. Now I know there are a plethora of Thai places to choose from in The City-many of them in this precise area, however, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't stop here at least once. It's a perfect restaurant to stop in before a show at the Great American or a night of boozing at the Ha-Ra.\nHonkies beware! When you order 'spicy' they don't fuck around. You may want to go with medium spice, but hey it's worth it if you like the burn.

When I first saw the name, I would never think that it's something close to...say, Marnee on 9th ave. But since it's recommended by my boy and his foodie friend, I gave it a try finally. And the result : nodding my head non stop.\n\nThe green curry was SOOOO good!! Spicy, sweet, coco-milky, tangy, with lots of different veggies. For some reason the bamboo shoots taste great in the curry. The flavors of different ingredients blend so well in the dish that's so much fun to eat! However, it's SOOOOO SPICY!! Boy stopped eating after like the 3rd bite, I took over, as someone who are pron to spicy food. I had to stop about half of the bowl. Sooooo good. But we were both gassy and uncomfortable the rest of the day, not because there's anything wrong with the food, it's so good that we couldn't resist it. \n\nThe Pig's feet noodle soup that's recommended by a friend was pretty good too. It hit the spot on a cold day. The flavor of the soup is mild, but still flavorful. I'd like to have more of the soft, gummy, tendon stuff from the feet though.\n\nThe dessert: sticky rice with coconut milk and fresh mango was very nice too. Perfect dessert if you were only 70% full, but still perfect if you are 99% full like we were. It just that good that your stomach will make space for it.", "author": "Yuchi C."}

We walked and walked around Larkin street in SF and found very few restaurants anywhere.  It was my second date with this girl and not knowing where we could go was definitely embarrassing.   I had my iPhone with urbanspoon but it wasn't much help to find a place very close.  We found several strip clubs but I figured that's not what she had in mind. (Oddly enough, I read in the SF Chronicle a day later and there was a murder at one of the strip clubs on the night we walked past it.)\n\nFinally we found the Thai House at Larkin and Geary, which emerged almost like an oasis in the desert in my eyes.  Even at 10 PM it was busy.  Their menu has practically 500 different items which is really bad for me since I feel the need to read about all of my options.  I ordered the BBQ chicken fried rice and my friend ordered the pad thai.  It took a while for us to get our food and they delivered my friend's food about 5 minutes after they served me -- definitely tacky.  But the chicken was awesome.  It had a 'slow roasted' smokey flavor and tender texture made the entree really unique.  I can't remember exactly how much our meal cost but the prices were reasonable.  The wait staff was somewhat aloof but I'd definitely recommend this place if you're wandering around aimlessly in SF one night.", "author": "James K."}

It was different than I expected, was thinking I was getting a kinda murky soup with noodles (tawainese style beef noodle soup). This was a clear and bright broth with melt in your mouth, fall apart pork. The slight crunch of steamed bean sprouts and crisp fat bits provides a perfect balance of flavors!\n- Pad Kee Mao (spicy rice noodle stir fry) - Good flavor, a lot of other places serve this dish and it's bland. \n- House Thai beef - Beef cut on bias with addictive chimmichurri type sauce. Comes with rice, the sauce really makes this dish\n\nLowdown: Definitely order the pork leg stew noodle soup, it's all that!  The other dishes we had were above average.

Green papaya salad and pad kee mao ordered spicy have left my lips burnt in that hurts so good kind of way. I think medium spicy to spicy is the optimal range.

Though some friends beg to differ, there's something about the thrown-together ambiance of the tenderloin location's interior (not to mention all the lovable aspects of the tenderloin itself) that completely wins me over.\n\nThe food is amazing.  If you order a dish that's meant to be spicy, it's spicy.  I don't know when the default became serving dishes mild unless asked otherwise, but I'm not a fan.  And I'm pretty weak as these things go, so I feel like my opinion should count.  My favorite dish, chicken pad see ew, is done excellently--plenty greasy, and plenty delicious.  The curries are good, the salads are good, the soup (at least the tom yum) is good good good.

I probably wouldn't have thought to review it until I took some friends there last weekend.\n\nIt was a weekend night and busier than usual, so we're waiting a few minutes for a table.  While near the cash register, I happen to see a recent health inspection notice just barely peeking out from behind another piece of paper.  78!  (\"78,\" I laugh to myself. \"But I eat here all of the time!\")  Not wanting to look like a jerk who takes their friends to less than clean spot in their 'hood (what can you expect in the 'loin?) I don't say anything to my dining companions.\n\nNot ten minutes later I was desperately trying to dilute my hideously sugared mint lemonade with my water while biting into a hot, tasty string roll.  Yes, I know what you're thinking:  it's SPRING roll, Holly, not STRING roll.  Perhaps you'd like to share that sentiment with the chef.  I pulled a generous length of twine from the shredded veggies tucked into said \"string roll,\" and quickly called over our waiter.  \n\nOur waiter didn't seem terribly concerned but dutifully gathered up my plate and disappeared into the kitchen.  He came back a few minutes later and said the string rolls would be on the house.  There was still one roll remaining on the table.  I looked at my friends and dared them to take it.  I told the waiter we needed a minute to decide if we wanted the rest of our order and he walked off with no apologies or other offers. \n\nI'm well aware that there are many worse things to find in one's food than string, but the couldn't care less attitude of this place is striking (at least appear sorry -or shocked!- and appropriately compensate your patrons for a mishap.)

(side note: Im done with the 's for now b/c I broke my right pinky playing bball the day before I came to san fran and I cannot deal with having to type the ' with my ring finger anymore, same with a lot of capitalization...but not to worry, ill keep spelling for the most part!)\n\nSo my mom and I ordered the pork leg stew thing with the rice, shrimp pad thai (b/c 1. all the comments about the pad thai on yelp and 2. b/c it also had a best in san fran award albeit in 2005...so maybe that's why it wasn't so good? Unless you cant win twice?), and the basil chicken on the waitress' recommendation....im glad we decided on 3 entrees and an appetizer for the two of us haha\n\nThe pork leg stew was the rice was soo tasty.  The meat was so soft and tender and the flavor was good.  Haha as my mom said, \"its kind like ma ma's hong shao rou (but still not as good), it's so tender\".  The pork leg stew comes with some sour sauce that has garlic in it, but we didn't use it with the pork.\n\nMy mom decided to get the chicken basil b/c she said that's basically what she uses for her san bei ji (Three Cup Chicken).  We got it with mild spiciness, which was still spicy enough to realize that it's spicy.  The chicken was chopped to tiny pieces and full of flavor.  We got it with brown rice, but it didn't look like it b/c it looked like red bean rice, but it was still good.  \n\nThe shrimp pad thai was really disappointing.  It was orange and overly sweet.  It was just one solid flavor with this sweet sauce that was too thick.  Ive tried my friends pad thai at Nonya (? I think its like a chain of Penang) in NYC, which was really good, full of flavor and very colorful.  That one had lots of green onions, eggs, and a little spiciness (and some other stuff that I didn't really care for haha)  This one had almost no eggs, not enough green onions, or shrimp.   \n\nNow...for the TRIPLE THREAT!  More than halfway thru our meal, I was telling my mom about the pad thai I had in nyc and how it had been spicy, when all of a sudden, I was like OH the basil chicken is spicy!  Let's make it chicken shrimp pad thai!  So, we mixed in the rest of the basil chicken and the brown rice (b/c there wasn't much of it left),  which gave it a bit of a spicy taste.  I wish I had thought of it earlier b/c we had SO much pad thai left over that the spiciness was much less noticeable (but not absent).  Then my mom thinks to pour in the sour sauce with the garlic b/c it's too sweet...\n\nThe triple threat pad thai might best be put this way.  I knew we were going to have leftovers, and I was not looking forward to eating the original pad thai b/c it was bland/overly sweet and I couldn't bear to waste a plate of noodles.  I was actually excited to wake up in the morning and eat this for early lunch/late bfast.\n\nThe Triple Threat.  Shrimp pad thai + chicken basil with brown rice + sour garlic sauce from pork leg = More texture, flavor, and a little spicy, sweet and sour pad thai.  TRY IT.  \nWe told one of the guys (he seemed to know a lot about the dish, he was like Ohh yea?! The combination of garlic and spice!  Hmm!) there about it...I hope they make it a new dish haha.  \n\nSeeing how long this is, not sure if ill be writing many more", "author": "Anna Z."}

The four toong gern yeung -- minced chicken and vegetable balls wrapped in rice paper -- resembled stuffed, savory, meaty, deep-fried ball sacs. I greedily downed all four.\n\nAround an hour into our meal, I began to feel...Strange. Uncomfortable. My stomach was starting to distend. At first I thought it was heartburn, so I took a break and hoped it would pass. It didn't. Unable to finish my pad thai, I had it boxed up and decided to call it an early evening.\n\nMaybe a little exercise would help me digest. I walked home.\n\nAs soon as I entered my front door, I rushed to the toilet and proceeded to puke uncontrollably, BLEEEAARRRCGGHHHHH! BLEAAAAARRRCCCHHH! So violent was my purging that the toilet water splashed up into my face. As my knees knocked and the toilet water dripped from my nose and I trembled and felt my heart palpitating, I inspected what I had puked up, it's something I do, I like seeing what was lingering in my stomach, plus I'm still looking for that dental dam I 'accidentally' swallowed months ago. And while fingering the noodles and peanut bits I noticed that some of the minced chicken from the toong gern yeung was FUCKING UNDERCOOKED AND PINK!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-07-07", "description": "This is the most authentic Thai restaurant that I have found in the United States period.  I have visited Bangkok two times; and Chiang Mai in the North of Thailand once.  I thus  got to eat at the famous street food vendors, and mom and pop restaurants that proliferate these cities; and since both Bangkok and Chiang Mai are the food centers of Thailand, folks who have been to or lived in these two cities know what makes Thai food great.  Thus, Thai House Express is the most authentic Thai restaurant as it is very comparable to Thai food you'll find in Thailand.  \r\n\r\nFor example, the Green Curry Chicken is well balanced and alive with flavor in the coconut milk, and spices.  This reminded me of the green curry chicken I had prepared by a master chef in a cooking school in Chiang Mai (Northern Thailand).  Secondly, there is a southern thailand regional dish called 'Kha Nom Jeen' which is my favorite. It is fish curry with preserved vegetables over soft vermicelli rice noodles.  That dish reminds me everytime of the well reputed Siam Square food courts  in Bangkok.  Totally authentic, and every flavor as it should be.  Keep in mind that 99% of Thai restaurants in the US do not carry this dish.  So for a Thai food lover, this is a special treat! \r\n\r\nA third dish that I like is the grilled chicken with sticky rice.  This dish is particular to the Northeast region of Thailand; Isaan; and it is marinated with honey sauce.  Thai House Express makes this grilled chicken superbly and truly like the one that I had in an Isaan specialty restaurant  in Bangkok.  Not surprisingly, Thai House Express is frequented by Thai students, and American men  who bring along their Thai wives. (Actually I should say it's the opposite; it's the Thai wives who drag their husbands to this restaurant because the food is so much like home).    So, to see so many Thais at this restaurant tells you something about how authentic this place is.\r\n\r\nI also like the fact that they do not make the food overtly spicy.  It is moderate/medium in spiciness; and you can add chili powder or green/red chilli sauce over your dish if you so prefer.  Highly recommended; and you'll save yourself the $900 flight ticket  to Thailand.", "author": "Harry C."}

It wasnt bad but they didnt go above and beyond. I did have to wait awhile for refills and so I was a little annoyed for having to wait.

Thai House express gets the flavors right.. although I think the spice level is made for us farang.  I prefer that the chicken be bone in the way it is done in northern Thailand  - the skin on drumstick is quite tasty. Here it is cut pieces of chicken that are a bit dry but nevertheless, the flavors are quite nice.

They have a few more inventive dishes than most places, and the execution is superb.  I particularly love the combo seafood soup, duck salad, pad see yew, and any crab special they may have.  I've only been 4 or 5 times, so I still haven't tackled half the menu.\n\nMy only HUGE gripe is that the staff has ZERO understanding of timing.  If you're like me, and want your dishes staggered so as to create courses, then make sure you order them one at a time.  Otherwise you're bound to get your soup after your noodle dish, with your \"appetizer\" of chive cakes somewhere in the middle.   Don't even try to tell them everything at once, asking them to space things out, thinking that this will happen.  Trust me, I've tried it.  To my dismay, the waitress went to the kitchen (which you can see from the dining room) and proceeded to call out the entire order, which as usual showed up in a jumbled mess of plates on the table, all out of order.  OK, so I'm a little OCD about this, but I like to enjoy things one or two at a time, and with correct temperatures, etc.  They don't understand this concept, so to counteract, you have to literally order one thing at a time, and fight to keep your menu.  But once you have this down you're set.\n\nOh yeah, and remember, spicy means SPICY!  I love spicy, and usually just go with \"medium\" here knowing that I can add spice in one of 3 different ways with the condiments.  However, the last salad I asked for \"medium\" burned holes in my tongue, while the pad see yew \"medium\" was super gringo non-spicy.  Hmmmmmm.", "author": "Pedro, aka Burgundy M."}

Thai House Express was a huge disappointment, and probably one of the worst Thai food experiences I have had for a while.  How can this place have earned a 4-star average?  My friend ordered #47: Kao Pad Ka-Na Pla Kem (Fried rice with egg, salted fish, and Chinese broccoli), and I ordered #61: Sukiyaki (soup version).  After one bite of the Kao Pad Ka-Na Pla Kem, my friend was already groping for spices.  Turns out the fried rice was too bland, the Chinese broccoli overpoweringly bitter, and the salted fish gag-inducing.  She literally spent the next 20 minutes separating the Chinese broccoli and bits of salted fish from the rice, bit by bit.  And after this exercise in culinary archaeology was over, she just ate the rice, adding more and more spices to each progressive bite.  Skeptical, I took a bite just to try to prove that she was being too picky, only to discover that she was absolutely right.  I had to close my eyes and go to a happy place.\n\nAs for my Sukiyaki soup, I thought that I had mistakenly ordered #200: Bowl of Pink Vomit.  It smelled faintly like turned fish, but I hunkered down and started to eat.  The flavor was predominantly sweet with a bit of sourness.  But there was no underlying savory body, no umami.  It felt like I was eating a bunch of seafood boiled in Thai ketchup.  The one-dimensional flavor got old fast.\n\nI'm still flabbergasted by our experience.

You are seated right away and the waiter promptly brings you menus and water shortly after. Two items that I frequently get are the five spices duck noodle soup with flat rice noodles and the kao pad goon-chiang (fried rice with Chinese sausage, egg, carrot, dice green bean, and onions). The items on the menu are very reasonably priced and the portions they give are very generous. I almost always have left overs! For drinks, I usually order a Thai iced tea (sometimes it's a little too sweet) or fresh coconut juice, which is absolutely delicious. The coconut juice tastes exactly like juice straight out of a fresh coconut. Also, they include thick slices of coconut in the juice, which you can eat after!", "author": "Jonathan C."}

Clearly functional, and not much more than that.\nBut the food is cheap!  Curries are about $7, and the most expensive of the specials tend to be about $13.  I had a 3-flavor salmon, which struck me as more of a Chinese flavor than Thai - the sauce was very strong (fairly tasty, but strong), and it entirely overpowered the mound of crispy basil, which was very sad because I absolutely love the taste of basil.  It's one of the reasons I'm a Thai food addict.  On the plus side, though, it was basically an enormous, tasty slab of salmon which was very cool.  I've been too many places where the \"green curry with salmon\" is green curry, with perhaps 4 small bits of salmon, if you're lucky.  This was like 1/2 pound of salmon, on a plate, covered in crispy basil, and smothered in a rich sweet/hot/acidic sauce.  You get your money's worth.  I need to go back and try the curries.\nThe Thai iced tea was also quite pleasantly large.", "author": "Don H."}

It wasn't too noisy so we could talk and hear ourselves. There were four of us with good appetites and we ordered family style.  We ordered the papaya salad with dried shrimp, beef panang curry a la carte, hot and sour coconut soup with tofu, and Thai House Noodles and steamed rice.  All medium spicy. After the meal, I think I could have done with hot spicy. The papaya salad is always one of my favorites.  I had hope for a little more tartness in the salad, but we gobbled it up like we didn't have anything else on the table.  Peter, the one who recommended we come here, told us to try the Beef Panang Curry. These are delicious soft chunks of beef stew meat in a very rich sweet red curry wit basil.  And they didn't skimp on the beef either.  I continously ladled the curry on to my steamed rice, forgetting that I'm supposed to be low-carbing it. The coconut soup was pretty good and I would order it again with chicken.  The Thai House Noodles were clear vermicelli noodles served under ground meat and veggies.  Pretty good and good noodle consistency, but not as spectacular as the beef panang curry. Overall, the portions were good, and the food very good.\n\nThe only annoyance was that the table seemed too small for the serving plates and everything else on the table. The wait staff was prompt and nice.  The restaurant was clean and they were quick to clear off our table after our meal (which I like).  Water service was good and no one had to ask for refills at all!  I would go back again to try some other delicious yummies!", "author": "Betty L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-10", "description": "So my friend Jas and I were on our merry way to the Tenderloin for what reviewers were calling \"the most authentic Thai food in San Francisco.\" We had Doris Day parking karma and found a spot 20 feet away on Larkin when we arrived.\n\nThe decor is really non-descript but the smells coming from the kitchen were fab. After reviewing many ChowHound and Yelp reports, here's what we ordered from the blogs recos: Kao Ka Moo (Stewed Pork Leg over Rice), Shrimp Paste Fried Rice and the House Special Pumpkin Curry with Chicken (which was a special that day).\n\nStewed Pork Leg Over Rice (3 stars out of 5)\nOverall, I enjoyed this subtle dish. It's very similar to the one my mom makes except she cooks with pork hock (read pigs feet). Me thinks this is really an Ethnic Chinese dish as it's prevalent in Chinese deli places all over SoCal. It is stewed with dark superior soy, ginger, garlic, sugar and star of anise. The skin has a deep complex flavor with that smokey soy and unmistakable flavor that only comes from star of anise after countless hours of stewing. It's served over rice with a clear broth that's been mixed in with the stewing liquid. The issue I have is that the broth was bland and really dumbed down the stewing liquid since they added too much of it. But I think I'm hardcore cause the version my mom makes is 10 times more flavorful and would give mainstream eaters an aneurysm.\n\nShrimp Paste Fried Rice (2.5 stars out of 5)\nOK, maybe I'm a food snob but I was disappointed with this dish because the name is misleading. Jas and I both agreed that the quality of the ingredients were really fresh and it was nicely presented. However, we could not taste any hint of Shrimp Paste in this dish! It was good \"Shrimp Fried Rice\" but where's the friggin' paste? And it was a tad greasy to boot (unforgiveable for good fried rice). Shrimp Paste is one of those things that if you cook with it, your entire apartment building will know because it will smell like you picked up a beached whale and it's been sitting in your hot humid apartment for a good month or so. But oh, the taste! It's one of those Stinky Tofu experiences - if you can relate. If you can't, ping me and I'll take you for some stinky tofu. Next time, if we order it, we'll ask for extra shrimp paste. I think it was dialed down for the Western audience. \n\nChicken Pumpkin Curry (2.5 stars out of 5)\nI never had Pumpkin Curry with so much Lemon Grass before. And they used white meat. Sorry, we don't know any \"authentic\" Asian restaurant that uses white meat. The meat was so dense, overcooked and fat-less that it just can't absorb the flavor of the sauce or curry.  I think it was fine but OSHA's version is much better. Smokey and complex with a million grams of fat from the coconut milk. I'm not a huge OSHA fan unless I'm expensing it but they do a couple of dishes really well like the Pumpkin Curry and Crispy Pork.\n\nOVERALL:\nI think this is a good Thai restaurant. They have some dishes that just do not exist on other menus but I think it's very overhyped. If I lived in the Tenderloin, I would totally come here for quick take-out.", "author": "Tai K."}

So far, this place still qualifies as his fave in the city. And I think it's pretty great, too. Definitely a cut far above the average amid the ubiquitous Thai joints in this town.

Fast, inexpensive, terrific friendly service and extremely tasty food.  You know it's good when the place is filled with Thai people.  Try the Pad See Ew with beef or the Gai Ga Prow.  I'm not a big duck fan but they have a plum duck dish where the duck is actually deep fried in an egg batter and then served with mushrooms and other vegetables in a plum sauce.  The way it was prepared really toned down the gamey duck taste and it blended well.  Very impressive.  My mother in law specifically requests that we take her to this restaurant every time she's in town from San Diego.  Don't walk, RUN to this place!", "author": "Jon B."}

I like the Pad Seau here bc they use Chinese broccoli and they put a good amount of sauce in it. It's a few cents cheaper than other Thai places and they give you more. The Phad Thai is pretty good too but pretty standard. The people are always pretty nice too.", "author": "JeF m."}
