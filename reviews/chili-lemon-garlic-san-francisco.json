Instead of wasting minutes trying to contact me, the restaurant could and should have contacted Doordash directly to confirm my order. They didn't and I was without lunch for the day. Their ineptitude lost them a potential repeat customer, hopefully this review resonates with you and you decide to go elsewhere.\n\nUPDATE: Here's my response to the owner's comment for transparency: \n\nI ordered through doordash and the driver was sent to pick the order up just as I have hundreds of times before. When the driver showed up, your restaurant claimed there was no order made and that I cancelled it. The driver called me to confirm the order and I spoke to your staff and they wanted me to call Doordash to confirm my order.

Despite the many times they have messed up my girlfriend and my takeout orders, and made us walk back to have them remake it, we continued to go back. We eat there 3 times a week, if not more.\nLast night we were there having our usual dinner, we had finished ordering, paid for the meal and sat down to wait for the food to be made. They came to our table and said they forgot to charge us for the $3 shrimp add-on. They asked if we had cash to pay for the shrimp, which we did not. We offered to either pay again with our card or not have the shrimp added to the meal. They declined the offer and said not to worry about it. We thought it strange that they even asked since they had already charged our card.\nWe returned again tonight, ordered our usual and when we received the bill they told us that they were going to charge us for the $3 shrimp that they forgot to charge us for from the previous night.\nIf this had been any other restaurant it wouldn't be a big deal, however with how many times they have messed up our orders, we have been incredibly gracious and always tipped them, even when we have had to walk back for them to fix our orders. It seems extremely petty to add the $3 shrimp a day later from their mistake. We were loyal, daily customers, but after tonight I will be very surprised if we return.

Well, it can be hot and miss most admittedly. Today was a bit of a miss. The place was actually busy at noon, with only one young lady waiting on tables and take-out. Not sure how many cooks, but orders seemed to come out slowly - and the waitress would occasionally forget a drink order or leave a soup on the counter too long. Could definitely use a second person when busy. Still, the good was good as always - and we weren't in a hurry so all was good. Started with spring rolls and Tom Yum soup. The spring rolls were hot and crispy ... soup was orphaned for a while but was still steaming when delivered. The entrees showed up before soup and rolls were even half finished so they were not as hot as when delivered when we started on them. Timing is important here, but a wait staff needs to communicate with the kitchen and I think it was too much for the single person there today. I had Pad See Eu but subbed mock chicken for the meat (pricey at $3 additional, but as a veggie I do get tired of just tofu, so it's a nice treat - and I don't often find mock meats offered in places, either!  The Thai Spicy Pan Fried with flat rice noodles (think a lighter fun noodle) was a hit as well - both were large servings, and with spring rolls and soup we left sated and happy !  \nWill be back, but have learned to expect a slow paced meal - at least until a two-person crew is brought in for lunch rush.

They're shady as hell and I told them as much after I confronted him about his lie.\n\nHalf an hour later, after we've already ordered food from a more reputable Thai restaurant, the delivery driver for Chili Lemon Garlic shows up at our door. I tell him we've already canceled our order after waiting 2.5 hours. The driver, in a huff, asks if I was the one who canceled the order and asks if I'd like to step out to fight him.\n\nHe wants to fight me.\n\nNo, I'd rather order food from a legitimate business that takes service seriously. If you want good food, delivered to you without an attitude, then you're ordering from the wrong place. The only thing going for them is that seamless advertises their business. And if seamless cares about customer satisfaction, they'll stop advertising for this terrible business.", "author": "Elliot E."}

One appetizer dish is $7.50 (and this was a order of fried spring rolls! **shocked face**). Why is one appetizer dish the same price as a main dish?! RIDICULOUS! \n\nSecond, the service kinda sucks. We came in, sat down, and 5 mins we were ready to order. Waitress didn't come for another 5 mins and this was after giving her numerous eye contact to let her know we were ready (note: there was only three other tables in this small place and most of them were eating or finishing their food... so she wasn't that busy). Finally, she came to our table and took our order. I ordered the Thai Boat noodle soup (close to $8). My co-worker ordered Seafood noodle soup (also close to $8) and we shared an appetizer. He asked the waitress which dish was better, angel wings or fried spring rolls... she said spring rolls and so we ordered that. \n\nI was getting over a cold and needed water to drink, so I asked her for water. Water did not come till 20mins AFTER we had sat down. Our appetizer came BEFORE I got my water! You should have seen my face.... I was NOT happy. \n\nI started eating the spring rolls.... it seriously was meh, nothing special about them to be worth $8 bucks. I did have their Angel Wings at this place before, and that was good. I should have made my co-worker order angel wings, way WAYY WAYYY better than the fried spring rolls we got. \n\nThen my noodle soup came out, and I was even more disappointed. The small bowl of noodles for $8, ARE YOU KiDDING ME?! If there was pho place close to my work, I know for a fact, I can get a extra large sized bowl for $8 bucks topped with hella meat and veggies! \n\nThai boat noodle soup: Rice noodles and special combo of slices rare beef, beef stew, beef balls in spicy soup. It was not spicy, it was just very rich and very sweet. I had to add chili paste to make it spicy and even that didn't help dull the sweetness. This dish was really rich in beef broth, noodles were not over or under cooked, but when you read the description of a dish, you expect that the description should live up to the actual dish. When it says spicy soup, I expect spicy soup... not sweet. It didn't even have a kick of spiciness to it.  The meat in this dish was not all that good. The chunks of beef cubes in my dish was way too dry and the meat balls tasted so fake. \n\nMy co-worker's seafood noodle soup was sad. Everything in it was all imitation seafood pieces. Imitation crab meat, imitation fish balls, just imitation everything! Ok, there was one piece of real shrimp and one piece of real squid.. but that was about it.", "author": "Erica T."}

When I unwrapped everything and noticed that a dish was missing, I called them and even though they said they made it, they took my word on the situation and made and delivered another order to me. I appreciate the customer service.\n\nWe ordered \nPad Thai - good flavor and consistency\nYellow Curry - good portion, just the right amount of spice and texture\nBBQ Beef - nicely cooked, tender and juicy\nCashew Chicken - just ok, breast meat a tad dry\nThai basil Pork - spicy but good flavor\nLarb with Pork - loved the spicy and sour flavor\nChicken Satay - nicely cooked but way small portion\n\nSo counting the food, service and delivery, I would have given 4 stars but they have 2 negatives going for them. ONE, the portions are way small. For example the chicken satay at most places are 5 skewers. Here it is three. All the other dishes, save the curry, were on the small size also. Now that in itself isn't such a big unless..... TWO, but they are expensive too. The satay was $7.50, all other main dishes were around $10. Most other Thai places with similar items would be in the $8 range. But I guess the soma district just likes to have higher prices.\n\nSo small portions and expensive (for what you get) equals minus one star.

This place is not far from my work so I ocassionally go at lunch with some coworkers. This place fills up fast and is not very big so go at or before noon and don't go if you have a 1PM meeting. :)\n\nEverything I've tried here has been good! Their pad thai is AWESOME which is sometimes rare at SF thai restaurants. Theirs is the right amount of flavorful and tastes delicious.\n\nMy other go to here is the pineapple fried rice. Very good. Comes with both chicken and shrimp unless you specify.\n\nThe curry is very good as well, but kind of a small portion compared to a lot of other similar places in the city where you get two meals' worth of food for the same price.\n\nThat being said, I like the feel of this place. Somewhat hole-in-the-wall yet classy enough. Good thai iced tea. \n\nWorth a visit.", "author": "Courtney A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-20", "description": "This was quite possibly some of the most expensive Thai food I've ever ordered.  The appetizer I ordered was very good, but the noodle dish that I ordered left me very unsatisfied. \n\nI noticed this restaurant a few days ago situated about four and a half blocks from my workplace.  The restaurant is on Bryant Street near Third Street; that is a busy area for vehicular traffic but not pedestrian traffic.  Actually, it was the cool restaurant name that caught my attention.\n\nOn the afternoon that I visited there was only one other diner inside.  Given that specific location I wasn't surprised.  The waitress seated me and handed me a paper take-out menu.  I was surprised that they had no regular menus printed up.  The first thing I noticed was the higher than normal prices.  The waitress left me sitting there for quite some time before she returned to ask if I was ready to order.  I ordered the deep fried Shrimp Rolls and the Pad See Eu with chicken.  I asked for a glass of cold water.  The waitress brought me a fancy glass of water, but it wasn't cold.  It was room temperature.  I ordered a soda instead.  $2.00 for a 12 ounce can of soda!\n\nThe Shrimp Rolls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/63brNArytTTX9Gi4cJjFqA?select=2iEkG65jUSqIQiPffcGVXw) arrived first served in a big porcelain boat with some sweet and sour dipping sauce and a small salad of iceberg lettuce and shredded carrots with a mildly sweet dressing.  The shrimp, each wrapped in an egg roll skin then deep fried, was perfectly cooked.  The dipping sauce was the perfect consistency, not too runny and not too thick.  I even liked the simple salad that accompanied the five rolls.\n\nNext came the Pad See Eu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/63brNArytTTX9Gi4cJjFqA?select=GLYm0oyujcJgZkU2VR1z5w), and I immediately noticed the ingredient substitution.  Instead of Chinese broccoli as specified in their own menu, I got American broccoli and thick squares of cabbage.  Neither vegetable was cooked thoroughly and both were hard and crunchy.  I'm used to nice big chunks of rice noodle, but the rice noodles were all broken up as if they had stuck to the pan and had to be scraped off.  By appearance I couldn't tell which was the noodle and which was the fried egg.  They also added crunchy carrots to the dish; that is another ingredient that was not printed on the menu.  The chicken pieces were white meat and very dry.  All of this combined in a sickening sweet, black soy sauce.  I love noodle dishes, and it is rare when I leave any of it behind, but I threw out half of CLG's Pad See Eu because it just didn't taste good.\n\nWould the delicious, crunchy Shrimp Rolls bring me back for more?  Don't bet on it.  I'm sorry ... been there, done that!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Service was good and attentive - and one server was attending to a full cafe of hungry patrons. Good flavoring - but I wish it was a tad bit spicier. San Francisco lacks a strong Thai joint, but this spot was a solid Thai place from what I've seen. \n\nDined with a first-time Thai food eater so we stuck to the basics. We split several appetizers. First, we had the satay skewers and tom yum soup to start. They had an ample amount of peanut sauce that was very well-crafted on the chicken skewers. The Tom Yum could have been loaded with more vegetables, and was a bit on the bland side. The lemongrass and citrus came out, but there is certainly room for improvement. \n\nI had the pad see ew, and my friend had the chicken cashew rice dish. We were both very pleased with our entree selections. Pad see ew is not hard to mess up, and CLG did a great job with it. If they kicked up their flavors a notch, it would be a solid sell. It was simple, their menu was basic, but had all the traditional callings of a Thai place. Pricing was fair, and the staff was actually Thai (a good sign). The server was very busy, but very sweet. Will go back for more.\n\nThey also deliver, do take-out and their is Wi-Fi.", "author": "Tammy H."}

So that was an acceptable trade-off.\n\nI went on reviews and also got the crab fried rice which I don't think I've ever had before. It was very tasty.\n\nThey took my delivery order at 10 minutes before closing with no complaints, which normally I wouldn't be that person but this place is only a couple blocks from my house (I'm sick and didn't want to go outside). The delivery guy was very nice and it was very fast and hot. WOW, that sounds weird! I'll add that one to the bucket list.\n\nSo that's all I have for the food, I would give it 4 stars on food this time but I'm knocking it down to 3 for having to season the food myself.\n\nDelivery was a 5 (that's what HE said).

At $8.50 for this appetizer we thought we might get, oh, at least 4?  So $4.25 per wing.  I was mad when I saw the dish being delivered to our table.\n\n- Some spicy beans and beef sautee that was a lunch item.  The lunch item was $8.75 but we opted for the entree that was an additional $1. (Total: $9.75)  The dish that arrived was tiny for an \"entree\".   I swear it was approximately 2 measuring cups of food scooped into a small oval dish.\n\n- Since we ordered the entree, we also ordered 1 serving of white rice: $2.  For $2 this was really jacked up -- it was approximately 1 measuring cup of rice.\n\n- 1 water (free) and 1 soda: $2.\n\nWe tipped our waiter (in full - since none of this could be blamed on her).  \n\nTotal: $28 for a light lunch.\n\nNever again.\n\n(Wow, I just read my previous review and nothing has changed.. shame on me for making the same mistake twice.)", "author": "Spicy T."}

If you want bland food, go to Chuck's House of Bland Midwestern Cuisine.  Some of us are actually craving a dish that has pepper in it, as opposed to merely waved in the general vicinity.  I have a general problem when going to \"ethnic\" restaurants, which is that the servers take one look at the white guy and decide that I can't handle spicy food; as a result, no matter how much spice I order, I usually wind up getting something that almost approaches thinking about the consideration of approximating a mild tang.  I have even had this problem with Chili Lemon Garlic when dining in, but I've discovered that, when I've ordered online, it's impossible for them to discern my ethnicity.  Rejoice!\n\nIn any case, I am generally a fan of the overall flavor and portions of the food.  My most recent dining experience, in which I ordered panang nua Thai spicy, blew me away.  Many Thai restaurants in San Francisco will present panang nua as a lot of beef in overly-sweet peanut sauce with a few sad slices of red bell pepper.  This curry was done right:  spicy, with a nice assortment of veggies included with the beef, and by \"spicy,\" I mean sweat was rolling off my brow and my endorphins were surging in a way I have not experienced in far too long.  I couldn't stop eating the sauce even though my mouth was rebelling and warning me of dire consequences.\n\nOne can get better Thai food in terms of flavor balance and quality of ingredients, but Chili Lemon Garlic really hits the spot when you want a potent, flavorful dish, and I'd much rather patronize it than a place like Osha which tempers its food to appeal to the hipster crowd.", "author": "Bitter J."}

When there's a full house inside, you might feel a bit claustrophobic.\n\nSo I gave this place my Pad See Ew test, and it passes.  Unfortunately, it took them a longer time than normal to cook, for some reason.  At least the bowl and wooden chopsticks that they give you were a nice touch.\n\nThe price was a bit more than I expected also, but I wouldn't say that it was expensive, as you do get just enough value for the food.\n\nI suppose I'll come back here to try their other stuff, like their soups or rice dishes.", "author": "Marlon E."}

Apparently, it came with the wrong sauce too. But despite these minor confusions, I give this place a 3-star because it's pretty decent. I'm glad there's another dining choice around my office, because I was getting tired of the other options. \n\nThey have a decent selection. I ordered the fried chicken over fried rice, because I'm a sucker for anything fried rice. The chicken was standard, juicy enough, and not over fried. The rice... \"ok.\" I've had better fried rice, but it's also much better than many places I've been to. Their duck noodle soup also smelled really good - that's probably what I'll be eating next time. Their portions are not super XXL sized, and not diet-sized, so I say just right for lunch. \n\nIf you've never been, and are looking for different places to try around the area, I say it's worth the shot.", "author": "Kevin T."}

I decided to try this place since it was close to my work and since it was quiet at the time,  I knew the food would be prepared quickly. I ended up ordering Pad Thai and a Thai Ice Tea. It ended up costing me around $15 with tip. The Pad Thai looked delicious when it arrived but it is definitely not the best I've had. It was bland for my tastebuds but I still enjoyed it.  Maybe they didn't add the MSG or something which is nice considering that I hate the MSG additive but sadly, I had a mediocre Pad Thai. I would probably come here again but I would suggest adding some hot sauce or something to the Pad Thai to give it an extra kick. The food isn't exactly cheap either....and it's not in a prime location... but then again SOMA is not a relatively cheap place to dine so it wasn't that big of a problem for me.", "author": "Jonathon C."}

Those were some of the yummiest shrimp, despite the labor of having to take all their little shells off (which would normally be a real turn-off for me).\n\nAs I was grumpily figuring out what my plan B was my heart sank, realizing that THE BEST SOUP EVER was no longer within my easy reach.  Their Kang Jerd soup - awesome little pork meatballs, and sweet sweet cabbage and onions, floating in this most amazingly seasoned broth.  I have no idea what spices were in there, but I've never had anything like it.  Very mysterious, and freakin delicious.\n\nNow I'm just depressed.\n\nI don't know if their menu (or their food) has changed since their move, but I would definitely recommend picking up some Kang Jerd or some Dancing Prawns next time you're there.  If they're even close to how yummy they were before then you should be pleased.\n\nWhy only 3 stars, if I'm so enamored?  Well, I also used to LOVE their Pad See Eu, but it became somewhat hit or miss, along with some of their other dishes I got regularly.  So that was starting to bum me out.  \n\nAnd they lose another star for moving away.  Although since it was apparently not their fault I should probably give it back.

I normally go to Bangkok Noodle at Union Square.\n\nI ordered noodle soups; 1). with fish balls and minced pork, 2). Yen-ta-foh which is a seafood noodle soup in the red bean curd sauce.  They turned out to be great disappointment in many ways.  Seriously these are so easy to make, how could you not have the right ingredients.  Everything that was put in these dishes were wrong.  \n\n1). Fish ball and minced pork noodle soup - Starting from the missing minced pork, so I only got fishballs and noodles....really?  \n\n2). Yen ta foh only came with 2 little shrimps, 1 little block of imitation crab and a couple of leaves of greens.  This soup normally comes with calamari, fish balls, shrimp, and maybe imitation crab.  On top of that, the soup tasted like they put the red tamarind sauce that's used for pad thai in my noodle as a supplement to the red bean curd sauce.  Again....really...are you kidding me?  \n\n3). The portion - the portion is half of what you normally get at Thai House Express or Bangkok Noodle but it cost more at CLG.  I understand that everything in the Loin is cheaper and I wouldn't have complained about the portion if it at least was done right..... but it wasn't.\n\nSorry to complain but this blew my mind.  I guess they were expecting to not cater to real Thai people so you wouldn't know what was supposed to be in each dish.  I wonder how they got 4 & 5 stars from some reviewer.  Maybe they're good at some dishes and not at others.  If that's the case....they should just drop the \"others\" that they're not so good at.\n\nSoooo disappointed!!!!!!
