There's usually a least a few people hanging out by the chips waiting for their sandwiches to be made.\n\nAnd the sandwiches are good! Definitely the craft cocktail equivalent of a sandwich. All of the meats are hand carved, individually toasted or heated up ingredients, and the bread isn't just some bag of stuff they got from Safeway down the street. You get a decent size sandwich too.\n\nAs for the corner store selection, they have pretty much everything you need. Ice cream, wine, household stuff, muffins, etc. Most stuff has a price listed. Aside than the chips, could never figure that one out.\n\nService is fine. Sometimes they have two guys making sandwiches during the busy times. Only downside is sometimes they close the sandwich shop down early. There's also a tip line on the receipt, which is strange if you're just buying a pack of gum, but hey if you're feeling tipsy go for it.\n\nOverall it's convenient. And the sandwiches are pretty good quality. Just come in at a normal time and you'll be fine.\n\nPROTIP: There is a frequent sandwich program. Buy 10 or so and get one free.", "author": "Joel L."}

I'd recommend the Dutch crunch or wheat. I'm pretty sure all of their \"house\" sandwiches come toasted, but make sure they throw yours in the oven too. The Darlicous is probably my favorite and go to when I'm in a hurry.

The Latin gentlemen making sandwiches  is not only rude and seems as if he does not want to be where he's at but he also picks and chooses who to be attentive too, highly unprofessional. I've been here numerous times, recommended this please and the feed back I hear is same attitude but the sandwiches are good. This store is no longer getting my business and I will definitely pass the word along. Zero stars if it was possible.", "author": "Edward F."}

Of all the nooks and crannies in the city, this little corner is idyllic and fairly full-service. A Travelodge, a vacuum repair shop, a few bars and restaurants, a dentist, a holistic healer.\n\nAnd of course a functional neighborhood must have a liquor store, and these lucky people have the Golden Gate. (Lucky because they live at Lombard and Lyon, not that the store is especially out of the ordinary.) \nIt's pretty standard; a good place to pick up a bottle of water after running the Lyon street stairs, or enhance your Curbside French-bistro experience with a pack of cigarettes. \n\nThey also have a giant flashing red arrow pointing toward their front door, mounted on the bay window above. I always think about the people living upstairs, who've maybe decorated their perfect little living room in Pottery Barn and can't just sit in there and read without the constant flashing red light.
