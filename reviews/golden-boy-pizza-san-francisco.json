I consider myself a bit spoiled since I live around the corner and can grab a slice whenever I want. Not many people are that lucky. Expect LOOONG lines as the inside space is super small but trust me, your slice is going to be well worth it. I've tasted almost every single slice they have and as a Pizza Purist the regular cheese pizza has my heart. \n\nMy ranking for the slices goes:\n1. Cheese\n2. Pepperoni\n3. Sausage\n4. Combination\n5. Veggie\n6. Clam & Garlic (This is their most famous slice. I'm not a fan of clams so it's at the bottom of my list.)\n\nNo matter which one you try, it will be a doughy cheesy perfection.\n\nTOP TIP - They are CASH ONLY! They do have an ATM inside :)", "author": "Inci A."}

Honestly the wait wasn't too bad. About 35 mins that passed pretty quickly. There's some bar seating inside where you order then snag a spot. The space is tight like a lot of other spots in the area.\n\nWe ordered the clam and garlic pizza for $4.25. It's a decent size slice and like many people have mentioned it's carby so it'll fill you up. Like I said I'm not a huge thick crust person but I was pleasantly surprised. The crust was delicious and crispy. The bottom-most layer had a crisp but firm crunch and the carb layer above that had that smooth chewy doughiness. As an overall bite the flavors were pretty balanced. I felt like I got a good amount of clams and garlic to live up to the base. I was also pleasantly surprised that the clams weren't gummy canned monstrosities. The ratios are still a bit off for me though because I really wanted more cheese and a more robust sauce. However it was solid slice.\n\nOverall, I wouldn't wait 35 mins for this again but earlier when I passed by I saw a short maybe 5 minute wait right around 6pm on a Saturday so there's definitely times the line isn't crazy. If that's the case, I'd consider stopping for another slice.", "author": "Vivian C."}

It's the one with a bit of clams, garlic, parsley, and maybe basil? If you like garlic like I do, that's the pizza you never knew you needed in your life. MMMMMM. I also got a slice of the everything supreme, which was good, but paled in comparison to the flavorpacked green pizza.

Of course the main attraction is the garlic clam pizza, which IMO is good but every time I've had it it's been a bit salty. I feel like it needs to be paired with a beer or something. Good thing it's a lot a bar. All the other slices are pretty good too. You get a thick squared slice of pizza and it's roughly around $4 depending on the slice you get.\n\nThe line is usually out the door but the moment you step in, that's where you order. It moves relatively quick because all they are doing is heating up the slices that you order. You can see the slices of pizza from the store front window.

When I came up to show my in-laws around the Bay Area, I planned to meet him here for some pizza and to catch up. Unfortunately my in-laws were exhausted so we weren't able to meet up. I was quite disappointed because I wanted to have my first experience here with ERR. Looking on the brighter side of things, we went to dinner at Sotto Mare and Golden Boy Pizza is like 30 seconds away. At least I can stop by after dinner this trip. \n\nI got ERR's recommendations (Clam & Garlic if it was my first time and Combo or Pepperoni) prior to going. He sold me on picking up two slices to snack on after dinner. I'm so glad I listened! He also warned me of a line but it does move relatively quickly. The guy who takes orders has this system and I gotta say, it was impressive how he remembered all the orders while still being a cashier. Very efficient! Best part was he was super friendly and calm the entire time. 5 stars for him! \n\nThe first slice I ordered is the Clam & Garlic pizza because it's their most popular. It's good but a little too much garlic for me. If you like garlic then this is your pizza! The second slice was their Combo and I loved it! It had sausage, tomato, mushroom, pepperoni, zucchini and cheese over their pizza sauce that was amazing! Crust was very good and held up well with all the ingredients. Even after eating a full dinner at Sotto Mare, I polished this slice off after eating 1/3 of the Clam & Garlic slice prior. \n\nThis pizza spot sells by the slice and is legit. With so many options in Little Italy, it's hard to decide but I urge you to check this place out. They have been in business since 1978 and are still around for a reason. Some things to note is that they are cash only. They also have chili flakes and parmesan cheese in take out packets if you ask for it. No oregano unfortunately but that's all good because they give you an opportunity to add anything you like prior to them packing it for you. Great slices of pizza at amazing prices. 4.5 stars!", "author": "Daniel C."}

I've never regretted waiting in line for this pizza, and it's always fresh and immensely satisfying. Of course, the earlier you go the better as they'll probably have a larger variety and more reasonable wait times.

But fair warning, chew some gum after eating the clam/garlic one! \n\nI also just want to throw it out there that two pizzas are more than enough to get full. Slices are pretty big and they run from $3.25-4.25 a slice. We were ambitious and got three slices each person but I guess the remaining two slices we couldn't finish was good for my lunch the next day. Word of advice though, try not to have it as leftovers.

Copyright infringement, perhaps?\n\nAnyways, Golden Boy Pizza's original location is still in the heart of North Beach where a lot of hungry, drunk people go to a \"quick\" bite to eat. Line is out the door, especially late at night on weekends and you might get hangry while waiting in line. It won't help if you'll stare at the window at the fresh batch of wonderful, smelling pizza straight from the oven as it will only make it worse. Get ready to suffer and drool until it's your turn at the front of the line.\n\nTheir pizza selection is cheese, pepperoni or sausage, clam / garlic, pesto / vegetarian and combination. A slice cost $2.75 and sheets go from $35.00, $41.50 and $48.00 depending on the type. You can also mix it up and get half and half, which is what we ordered. \n\nI'd also recommend eating these bad boys on site as they are still hot and you can see the strings of melted cheese stretching as far as North Beach to Baker Beach. Really, that's not an embellishment, I tell ya. \n\nYou can also watch the show inside as you can see how the staff communicate and work during a busy night. It's quite a production to marvel at, and the efficiency and the speed with how they operate is probably comparable to the best assembly line of any factory.\n\nYou might also dig the graffiti and stickers that has evolved throughout the years with layers and layers of patrons leaving their mark...literally speaking.\n\nDrunk or not, the pizza is a knockout!", "author": "John G."}

With 6 slices and a bottle of water, it was only $25 and I was very pleased with the price.\n\nWe tried combo, cheese, pepperoni, sausage, pesto veggie, and clam garlic. My favorite was clam garlic. It was garlicky with an unique taste, but it wasn't exactly clam. Very addicting. Least favorite was actually the combo. I guess I just didn't care for zucchini on my pizza even though I liked it on the pesto slice.\n\nOverall, I loved everything. Service was fast and friendly, and the pizza was delicious.

Although we were looking for parking for a good 15~20 minutes, our walk from our spot to GBP turned out to be less than 10 minutes (whew). It was freaking cold (let me tell you). And, it ain't safe at night on these mean streets (getting too dramatic eh?)\n\n\nBut yes, after breathing a huge sigh of relief after finally parking, walking swiftly amongst other pedestrians and aggressive drivers, and bracing the cold in our not-too-ready-for-this-situation jackets, we reached GBP.\n\nUpon arriving, we discovered two things:\n1) People (I mean a lot of people) eat pizza after normal hours (after 9:30pm).\n2) GBP is \"cash only.\"\n\nThank the Lord that we both had enough cash on us, AND we were at the front of the line after about 15 minutes of waiting. During our sweet waiting, we almost witnessed a fight between a bartender and a customer down the sidewalk, but thankfully it just ended with \"Pay for your damn drink\" and \"Watchu gonna do about it?\" And some angry faces and some unnecessary comments from people in line at GBP...And then there was this half-sober/half-drunk guy who walked down the GBP line saying \"Happy Saturday\" and tried to get high-five's from everyone. When it came to our turn, we initially didn't respond but were like \"what the hell, he won't leave till we give em' a high-five.\" By this point, even the smell of the pizza was becoming slightly unbearable.\n\nAnyways, once we entered the narrow door, I ordered a single slice of the following:\n-Clam and Garlic\n-Cheese (poured pepper flakes all over)\n\nYUM. Must I say more? The slices were piping hot, the ingredients were fresh, and the toppings were magnificently flavorful.\nAnd, the individual slices go from $3.25~$4.25. \n\nI also just wanted to give props to all the employees...they were all so efficient, and two of the guys (the one taking orders at the front and one of the \"pizza makers\" were so amazingly quick and accurate at what they did and were friendly all at the same time).

They were about the size of my hand (my hands are not too small!). They were very cheesy and the toppings were cooked very well. \n\nThe crust was just ok and tasted kind of plain. The taste reminds me of a typical baguette even though it did not look like one. It was very crunchy though! Whenever I order pizza, I usually go for the slices that have large crusts. I think tasting every part of the pizza is important. In some pizza places I have been to, the crusts would be seasoned well. Some would be stuffed with cheese and sauce while others would have a lot of herbs on them. \n\nAs weird as it sounds, I felt a little nervous walking into the bathroom. There were graffiti and stickers everywhere and made me feel like the place was unclean even though it wasn't (it was the exact opposite!). I ended up just washing my hands and figuring out how to turn off the faucet for a couple of minutes since water kept dripping out... My boyfriend thought I was walking into a janitor's closet and did not see this bathroom door at the first or second glance.\n\nOther than that, I think I can imagine myself coming back.", "author": "Kristina M."}

I live in the mission district and go out of my way to come all the way to north beach, and wait in what is usually a 10-15 min wait for some of the best pizza I've ever had.. that says a lot about golden boy!\n\nWhat I like most about golden boy is it's straight and to the point. They have 5 different types of pizza ready for the taking; Cheese, pepperoni or sausage, clam/garlic, pesto/vegetarian and a combination. My personal favorites are the clam/garlic and surprisingly the cheese! Simple but you can't go wrong with the cheese slice here.\n \nWhat makes the pizza so good, aside from the bomb cheese and toppings is the focaccia bread that it's baked on. It's thick, but not too thick, always crunchy and most importantly super tasty! \n\nWhen ordering they give you the option to eat it as is (which is already cooked and sitting under a heat lamp), or they can heat it up for you in an oven they have. I prefer it a little more hot and crispy so I opt for the oven. The customer service is always on point and polite, and they always have a good way of attending to you all while keeping the line moving in order to serve everyone. \n\nA must visit when in San Francisco and when in the mood for a little trip to north beach for some pizza! \n\n5/5 burritos!!", "author": "John James M."}

When I got there, around 11:50am, there was already a line extending outside of the restaurant. This line may be daunting, but it's pretty fast moving since it's a slice place after all. The pizzas are on display at the front window too so go ahead and figure out what you want before going in. \n\nThe menu is very straightforward with just a few options (cheese, pepperoni, supreme/combo, clam & garlic, and pesto & vegetarian). The seating can be limited, but thankfully most people in line were getting takeout. \n\nI went with the cheese pizza... at first (more to this later). My god was it delicious. The crust was crunchy, and the cheese to sauce to dough ratio was perfect. The sauce was well balanced. Typical carryout pizza joints tend to be too tart for my taste. Back to the point, I luckily got a corner piece, and I would recommend for you to do the same. I enjoyed this cheese slice so much that I went back and got a pepperoni one. It was amazing too. I normally prefer toppings on my pizza, but if I were to do it again then I'd recommend just getting the cheese slices.

Or shall, I say; Golden Boy! This here pizza is probably the closest that you're gonna get to Chicago Style in the Bay Area. That, or you'll just have to take a flight out to Chi-town to get the real thing. In the meantime, Golden Boy will appease your pizza cravings to the fullest. \n\nIt's thick, a little greasy, cheesy, and packed full of flavor. Perfect for anytime of the day, but especially popular with the late night crowd. You know greasy pizza helps to sop up all of that late night alcohol and Golden Boy's Pizza does just that.

I knew this review was something I had to sleep on and really try to grasp my experience before taking further action. My husband and I enjoy the pizza here but unfortunately the service last night was terrible due to a specific employee. It was so bad, we lost our appetite for our pizza and ended up tossing it out. I had too much adrenaline running through me, not from the usual excitement of delicious pizza. But, from the anger of seeing what i normally see on social media happen right in front of me.\nWhen you pay for something at a restaurant you not only pay for the pizza, the pasta, the burger etc. You also pay for the service, and I don't care if the restaurant is a 4 or 5 star rating. If the customer service is terrible, I don't care how good the food is, it is not worth my money. \nWhenever we are in SF, Golden Boy Pizza has been our go to pizza joint. We know the routine of waiting in long lines for minutes on end and some times chatting it up with our fellow pizza consumers. A good sign the foods good, usually has a long line outside. We stand in line outside for about 20-25 minutes give or take. So, my husband and I make small talk with a group of 3 male senior citizens. They were just a ball, their humor got us through that line. One of the men had an east coast accent so, we knew he was not originally from SF. After short conversation, he gave my husband a tip on a restaurant in NY from a famous Seinfeld episode. \nThe senior admitted that this is his FIRST time tasting Golden Boy Pizza and that he was not sure what to get. So we briefly walk them through what they normally have and what we like to get. \nWe all get to the counter. The senior citizen was next to us, trying to put in his order. Mind you, this man could be roughly in his late 70's to early 80's. He asks the employee , \"What do you got over there?\" Pointing at a specific pie.  This employee snappishly diverts his question with \"which one? I don't know which one you're talking about\" without even looking, all while she continued on with finishing our order. Than, she follows with, \" Read the menu. That's why there's a menu.\" She repeats that 3 times. Meanwhile, the senior citizen was very calm and collected. He ignored her obvious irritation, and continued to ask her more questions about the types of pizzas that we're available. She then adds, \"You had 30 minutes in line to think of what you wanted to order so look at the menu, that's why there's a menu .\" \nThat's where I stepped in, and I told her. \"He's asking you what pizza is there because this is his first time. This is new to him. You do not talk to him like that. \" \nAfter coming to his defense. Our 2 slices of pizza we ordered, one sausage and one clam garlic were basically thrown on to a sheet on a counter like it was for animals. Wrapped up like they were leftovers. \nFor anyone who is familiar with Golden Boy Pizza, there are usually 6 types of pies. I repeat 6, and at this time there were only 3 types left to choose from. Whatever's left, that's what you get or you have to wait for more. Shocking that this PIZZA restaurant employee couldn't help a senior customer in choosing a slice of pizza to buy. If that's how Golden Boy Pizza treats a NEW PAYING CUSTOMER than they just lost our business. There is nothing laborious you have to do but utter words, not prepare and cook the pizza so this type of disregard is outrageous. I will never stand by when an ignorant, ill-mannered, impudent person shows no respect to a fellow senior/elder.\nI work in the medical field and I have a lot of experience with caring for senior citizens. And i have learned some invaluable things from them. I never forget that baby boomers played a huge part in paving the way for Our economy, and for our rights. So, with what ever humanity is left out there, I can't turn the other cheek or standby when someone gets bullied or treated wrong. \nI saw this senior man wait patiently with the rest of us in line anticipating our turn to get a slice of pizza. Even one of his friends that was waiting with him went to Tony's pizza instead just up the street and tried to convince his group to try Tony's. But instead, they waited patiently for GBP. \nThe level of DISRESPECT and RUDENESS that this fellow senior citizen received was APPALLING! No one deserves this type of treatment, ever. \nI took a picture of this employee to make it clear who she is. This employee should be reprimanded or fired because she obviously doesn't like her job. But, unfortunately, there's this thing where we label a person who is fully grown or developed an adult. But the moment an ADULT loses their morals or manners they fall into the category of a ignorant CHILD. So to that fellow employee, I wish you well.

They are displayed in the window and replenished often, and there is no way to say \"hold the olives\" on the veggie pizza. A slice is pretty filling enough, and very satisfying. \n\nThere's always a line, and it sometimes does not move that fast, so be prepared to wait at least a half hour. But then the slice is ready right away, so you'll be ok.\n\nIf you want to dine in, you grab a spot at the bar or counter (first come, first served) and maybe order a cheap glass of wine or beer.\n\nOR, if the weather's nice, take your slices to Washington Square Park and enjoy a little picnic! Grab your beer and wine at a corner store beforehand, and enjoy a drink while you wait in line and afterwards at the park :)", "author": "Roya B."}

I stopped by mid-afternoon and either there are a lot of day drunks around, or the reputation that this has of just being a late night after-bar stop is highly exaggerated. The lady in front of me was picking up a sheet for the office, the two girls behind me looked to be on and food photography quest, and I just wanted to finally try the place that has been eluding me every time I'm in the neighborhood.\n\nFinally, after many trips to this part of town I did slide in and grab a slice... er.. square. I was wandering the streets up here, as I tend to do when I'm visiting. I had all afternoon before needing to head to work meetings, and I was food touristing the city a little. You just head to your set destination and then follow your heart/Yelp app. My heart took me to truffle town and the app to pizza (and also a bakery, and also homemade pasta, and also gelato... wouldn't you have loved to come along on that adventure?) and the whole afternoon was *almost* perfect.\n\nThe clam pizza seemed like the right answer, and I honestly dunno how much it costs per slice because it was a cash situation and I handed the guy a fiver and felt like that was just fine. They throw them in the smallest of ovens, blaze up the heat, and then pop it into the checkered paper. He offered to wrap it up for me as I was eating and walking, but you can stay and occupy one of the cramped seats in the narrow entry or back area if you want.\n\nNow, I won't deny that this is probably a 17 star joint when you're coming out of one of the neighboring watering holes. You're going to soak up the fizzies with the cheese and crust. Every town -- shoot, every neighborhood -- they need a late night divey pie stop.

The veggie pesto had a light pesto taste (this is always a complaint though, I like to layer on that stuff) and the cheese was also piled on.

It was so fun to eat! Each flavor was great but I think my favorite was the sausage.", "author": "Iris H."}

The line goes by sorta quickly during the late night hours but this place is sure worth the wait! Safe to say I was sober and still thought this place was worth a try! \n\nEach slice is $4.25 and one can mix and choose different slices to go into their box. The garlic clam is one of their most well known and is super duper garlicky YUM. The Italian sausage and pepperoni was also a second favorite. \n\nMake sure you check your exact change cause the guy at the window forgot to give me back an extra $10!!!

Golden Boy is like that- a dump of a pizza place in one of the most competitive dining areas in the West Coast, especially for Italian food. So with nearly no seating, an often crusty staff with a sharp attitude, and a fairly dirty and seedy atmosphere, what keeps the line out the door every night? Exactly those traits, coupled with amazing pizza. The pesto is powerful, rich with basil and balanced with generous mozzarella. The meat pizza is a heart condition in edible form, and worth it. But my favorite, as a Norwegian, is the clam. Salty, rich, the kind of pie that you and your friends will remember for hours as the taste lingers on your palate and on your breathe.\n\nDon't bother to come if you're looking for clean, or nice, or fancy. This is serious pizza, and it's a slice of SanFrancisco.", "author": "James N."}

I was told that around 6pm the line starts to form and goes around the block, so I took some initiative and went around 3pm. There was no wait and most of the seating was open - I walked by later in the evening around 8pm and there was definitely a long line outside. I got two slices: one cheese, and one sausage. They are heated up in the oven and brought out to you - you can also get the slices to go. All of the seating are stools and the bar doesn't have much depth to it: I found myself turning sideways to feel comfortable enough to eat. The slices were really good (but I am partial to Sicilian pizza) and I was impressed with the quality. Nice crunchy bottom, thick but not dense, and just the right amount of cheese. I was watching the guys make and spread the dough - they use special square pans that help to create that golden buttery crunch - spread the sauce - both green and red - and toss on the cheese. I would recommended this place to anyone and the only reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because they only accept cash.", "author": "John C."}

Then Golden Boy Pizza is the place for you. They been serving their signature square slices on Green Street in San Francisco's North Beach for forty years! I finally got the chance to experience this well-known landmark on a late Wednesday evening after a group movie outing at the Metreon and although the food didn't disappoint, the service and the fact that they still, after all these years, only take cash made my first time less enjoyable. \n\nI came with a trio of friends after walking around the North Beach neighborhood to see what we wanted to try out. Despite it being late on a Tuesday evening there were many options to choose from, but we were surprised that the only fast casual option in the area was in fact Golden Boy Pizza. It's in and out at Golden Boy as the lines stretch out to the front of the store mainly because the order counter and cash register is right in front right next to the front door. Talk about bad feng shui or good business as it seems they are always busy, which technically they are not, as you can get through their line in speedy order.\n\nThis time around my friend was smart and decided she wanted to try one of each they had displayed. So it was Cheese ($3.25), Pepperoni ($3.75),  Sausage ($3.75), Combo ($4.25), Pesto Veggie ($4.25), and Clam & Garlic ($4.25). All told the total bill was 24 dollars for six square box, which in hindsight is not a bad deal considering the size of the squares. Unfortunately our fun only-in San Francisco experience was ruined by the fact that our server was really brusque in attitude and made our make a decision on what we were going to order much faster than we would have liked. But nonetheless we ordered away and the slices in the window are already pre-cooked, once you make your decision, they heat it up in their re-heating contraption right next to the front counter area. Although my friend wanted to bring most to her slices home to her famished family, she nice enough to be willing to share in one of her slices so I could get a sample of what to order in the future. We split the Pesto Veggie slice, and although it was warm to the touch, it was also rather a greasy piece of pie. A full five napkin adventure for even half a slice.\n\nGolden Boy Pizza has been serving focaccia style pizza since 1978 so to be in business at the same location for forty years, they deserve our respect and praise for sticking it out after all these years in a competitive environment. The pizza could be a smidge better, but it you're looking for an affordable option in what is normally a highly trafficked tourist location, they you could do much worse. I still plan on returning one evening in the future especially when I have those hunger pains late at night.", "author": "Jason F."}

Their crust didn't have any of those burnt ashes/ blackness on the bottom of their pizza and also I liked how it wasn't too oily like many pizzas are. \nI also appreciate that the table has extra chili peppers and other seasonings to put on the pizza because I am a spicy kind of girl. \nOverall, the pizza slices are worth its price because I was pretty full after one slice and the wait time isn't that bad either. \nWould recommend coming here.", "author": "Kochamon S."}

Yup, pretty much 2,500+ reviews and a 5-stars rating says a lot about this place! It's everything a 5-stars rating should be, not boringly perfect by any means, but before I get carried away and your mind goes drifting off to shirtless golden boys dancing to relax don't do it... hey, this is a legit pizza place in North Beach, aka Little Italy! To me, and obviously many others, it's a 5-stars rating because:\n\nThe Golden Boy vibe: It's old school to the core. I mean it's been on the corner of Green street since the disco days of 1978. That greasy spoon vibe, 40-years of layers of stickers on the walls, the decor that screams \"original\" is what's it all about. Expect old stools, dim lighting, and loud music! \n\nThe Golden Boy value: I mean you could buy other things here, but it's all about the pizza, yo! The mouth watering pizza! By the slice, or by the pie, you won't stop at only one. The best part is for $5 or less you can get a killer slice of the tastiest pizza your tongue has ever touched. It's hella tasty and damn it's guido cheap too! I highly suggest at least two slices to compare, y'know what I mean, son? \n\nThe Golden Boy Taste: Tell me your best pizza spot on the planet and then try a Golden Boy slice. Go ahead compare it! I do know not everyone sees pizza the same way, some take the gourmet route, some will take the freezer burn route, but if you want a legit pizza with goo and dripping everywhere, taste buds savoring every old school bite... you'll be in love. Not with little Danny, or big Tony, but you'll love your slice, home slice! \n\nLastly, there's some unsaid \"Golden Boy house rules\" that are legendary to those in the area, but in all honesty it's mostly urban legend. No silly, no big ass Tony will bounce you from the place if you look at his baby sister the wrong way... we've come a long way since the guido stereotype days. Just know this... Golden Boy is CASH only, it's straight forward ordering (pointing works too), and it's no fancy restaurant, so don't expect fancy or special treatment and you'll love it! Expect a little and get a lot in return is my motto. Any slice is a good slice at Golden Boy, but if the garlic clams is available grab a slice! The everything combo is killer too!

Worth waiting in the line out the door on a chilly SF night and so deserving of the praise. \n\nHeard about Golden Boy from a list of 'must eats' in the city. I was skeptical at first because it didn't seem like anything special. I'll admit it, I was wrong! \n\nGB pizza is no frills, located on Green street just a block off of North Beach (aka SF's Little Italy) thoroughfare Columbus Ave. Easy to find with it's kitschy neon sign pointing to the door. You may have to search a bit for street parking depending on what time you go. This is a popular spot so anticipate crowds during peak times. Don't worry the line moves quickly!\n\nGBP whips up pan after pan of tasty pies. The scent of Italian herbs, marinara, cheese, and garlic wafts out their door and will get your mouth watering. This is a straightforward pizza place with a few varieties available by the slice (about $3-4 each). Most are standard- cheese, pepperoni, sausage, combo, and veggie. But a standout is their garlic and clam!!  Firstly their pizza is unlike any other I've tried, it's fairly rectangular slices, with a thick, plush dough and crust, the mozzarella is ooey-gooey wonderful (they'll pop your slice in the oven once you order so you get that molten cheese glory).  The clam & garlic was very, very garlicky (which I love) not at all \"fishy\". Highly recommend! The pesto on the veggie slice was ridiculously delicious and made for a rich, sumptuous slice. \n\nThere's not a whole lot of seating available inside, bar style seating, kind of half to luck out with timing if they are busy to snag a stool, but they will deliver your order with real silverware! I recommend taking advantage of this as this pizza is thiccccck. At each seat they've got all you need - grated Parmesan, red pepper, garlic powder, black pepper, and seasoning.  If you need a drink to pair with your meal they have a good beer selection available by pint or pitcher. \n\nNot a fancy spot, it's cramped and loud, but it's delicious, filling, and satisfying pizzas are incredible.

Inside, the walls are covered with stickers, postcards, graffiti and random things customers stick to their walls. The restrooms are even more insanely decorated with more of the same. (not a good place for drunk people, you might get disoriented)\n\nOnly counter seats are available, on a tall stool w/o a back, so watch your little kids. The process is simple if you haven't been yet. Check out their options by the window, walk inside (or wait in line) place your order and pay. Hopefully you'll fins a seat and they'll call you when your pie is heated & ready. \n\nLike most of the people that come here, I got the clams & garlic and a combo. The c & g was a little light on taste. I had it at other places before and it was bursting with garlic flavor and had piles of clams. Golden Boy's lacked that burst of flavor and some bites lacked clams. I had to add basil and red pepper to liven things up. The combo was not terribly generous with the sausage. Both were good, but neither had me craving it when thinking back about my visit. \n\nPerhaps it was the heightened expectations from all the great reviews and never-ending lines, but my experience gets a 3 star.

I tried the clam and garlic - AWESOME! plus the plain cheese (also delicious). \n\nCouple things to know:\n+ CASH ONLY! \n+ Take out or eat in. The eat in vibe is very divey with limited seating. Their bathroom was straight out of a dingy dive bar. I LOVED IT. \n+ Anticipate lines. There was a short line outside when we came. Don't fret. The main reason for the line is that you order as soon as you walk in so it's kind of normal that a line forms. It is also pretty popular. \n+ I only saw metered parking outside.", "author": "Maria E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-27", "description": "When I think about what a great pizza tastes like, I think of Golden Boy's pizza. To be specific, their clam and garlic pizza is among the best I've ever had, and it's great that its available as single slices instead of having to buy a whole pizza for it. The clam and garlic is my go-to pizza whenever I come here and I usually get two slices. Nothing better than two warm slices of garlicky goodness during a cold evening. They have other types of pizza, but the clam and garlic pizza is what they're famous for.\n\nThe clam and garlic pizza are plentiful in chopped clams and garlic, and it's pretty cheesy. It's peppered with herbs on top and the crust is crunchy, and I would recommend trying to get one of the side slices for the crust. What enhances the flavor is some little chili flakes on top, gives it that nice spicy kick. \n\nThe only con that I could think of is that its cash only, which isn't that big of a deal. Usually, I would see some kind of short line outside, most likely waiting for the clam & garlic pizza so that might be a slight con. Golden Boy Pizza is basically a hole in the wall bar that serves excellent pizza, and in my opinion, hands-down one of the best pizza places in SF. Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for great pizza and a place to chill.", "author": "Nelson X."}

Like my fellow Yelper, Ann S., said in her review, there are windows that you can look through where the pizzas are displayed for you to look at and choose which one(s) you want.\n\nFacts:\n\n* Seating in here is pretty limited and, seeing as they're open super late, I wouldn't be surprised if there's nowhere left to sit on a late night.\n\n* Don't expect to come here and order a personalized pizza or to have a menu with a million different kinds from which to choose.  There are only five or six kinds of pizza on their menu.\n\n* You can either order by the slice or by the sheet.  If you order by the slice, they'll warm your pizza up in the oven before they give it to you.\n\nI ordered a garlic and clam slice and a cheese slice to-go.  The garlic and clam, from what I understand, is their signature pizza.  It was AMAZING.  There was a lot of garlic yet it was not overwhelming and it was straight-up delicious.  Also, it wasn't dripping with grease as I initially thought it would be.  The cheese slice was damn good too.  \n\nDon't be surprised if there's a line out the door when you go.  This place is popular and for good reason.  My advice if you're going for lunch: get there around 11:30-11:40 as there isn't too much of a line around then.\n\nMinus one star because they gave me my to-go order in a paper bag and with each slice wrapped in paper.  This caused some of the cheese to get stuck to the paper and come off when I unwrapped it.  They do have have boxes from what I saw so I'm not sure why they couldn't box mine.\n\nIf you're a pizza lover and in San Francisco, come through.

I'm not sure if Golden Boy classifies themselves as a Sicilian pizza joint, but this was the best Sicilian pizza I've ever had. The problem with Sicilian pizza is that it can be unpleasantly doughy if not done right. Golden Boy is very different. The pizza is a little thinner, and has a crispy and buttery underbelly that is absolute worth the calories. \n\n2. The establishment itself is very charming. There is a pickup window for to-go orders and some stools for eaters in. Very low key and cash only.\n\n3. The famed clam pizza was absolutely the best pizza I've had in a long long long time. I've been to New York and had Joe's, Lombardi's, Bleeker street...there's something about this pizza that makes it so satisfying even though it's not my usual favorite fold over NY slice. The dough is phenomenal. The clams are whole little clams and actually have a satisfying chew and paired with the cheese, garlic and parsley, it's definitely one of the best slices I've ever eaten.\n\nIf you are in SF, please find this slice, you won't regret a single bite!

Waited for ~20 minutes in the line of said obnoxious drunk people. 100% worth it for the garlic and clam pizza. First of all, the slices are huge. One square slice is probably the equivalent of 2 normal slices. They re-heat it your choice(s) of pizza for you, so it's nice and crispy. \n\nThe garlic and clam pizza is my favorite. So garlicky and pungent and everything you want in a greasy late night pizza.

I visited around 11:30pm and there was a line out the door, but it moved pretty fast. I ordered a slice of the 'famous' clam and garlic pizza and then a slice of the combo to share with my boyfriend. There's only bar seating inside since it's a small space, but we were lucky enough to find two seats at the counter. The stools were rather small and uncomfortable and the counter was too high up. There also aren't any hooks to hang bags so I was clutching onto my bag while trying to eat my pizza and not fall off the stool at the same time. \n\nAs for the pizza itself, I really didn't think it was as amazing as people say. The clam and garlic pizza looked and smelled good, but as I was eating it, I barely tasted any clam or garlic flavors. The combo pizza tasted like a less oily, less toppings, but better crusted Costco pizza. I'm sorry if that comparison offends some people (lol) but as I was eating it, that's what I was thinking. I put so much parmesan and red pepper on my pizzas but it still didn't satisfy my tastebuds. I kept thinking about adding Tabasco, tbh. At $4.25 a slice, it's pretty decently priced, but I don't think it was worth standing in line for.", "author": "Cecille W."}

The line is always long past midnight. If you're out and about and REALLY want one of these slices, get there around 11-11:30pm...you might even get a seat inside! After midnight though, the doors to the restaurant closes and they only open up their window to serve you the slices. \n\nThe pizza always comes out toasted (unless they literally brought the tray out 10secs before, then they won't reheat it).  \n\nFYI, Golden Boys even serves some alkie. The cutoff time for the alkie to be consumed is SUPER SUPER strict though. We got there just before 11:30 and the cashier said we could get a pint, but it HAD to be finished by 11:30. No exceptions. True to his word, he came by 5mins later waiting for us to finish chugging our beers. \n\nAside from the unplanned beer drinking contest w my friend, the entire experience is always truly SF to the core. Quick sassy staff, amazing food, and probably a few too many drunken ppl screaming up and down the street (and the line). \n\nNew trays of pizza come out every 20ish mins. WAIT FOR A SLICE OF THE FRESH CLAM PIZZA. No lie. You musttttt get it. \n\nPS they have a sister sit down restaurant in SSF. Shocking, right?! And it's the cutest sit down Italian restaurant ever! The BFF's dad happens to be BFF's w the owner of Golden Boy and Bertolucci's. Look it up.

And it's shaped in a square slices, which I like. Since I was going to SF to visit my gf I had to check this spot out! The inside is very small and slender. More of come in eat your slice or pick up your to-go and leave. I loved the vibe though.  A small mom and pop kind of store that has that edgy look. It was pretty hot inside. It was not a huge menu, very simple, about 4 different kinds of pizza and they served beer as well. I believe it was CASH ONLY!\n\nThe slices are huge! We pretty much tried one of each, since my gf and I both got 2 each. It's pretty cheap and you get a whole lot of it, so I'd say it's a good deal. I did not know at first, until I went to the bathroom, but there was a few more seating in the back. \n\n_Combo ($4.25) Mushroom, zucchini, tomato, onion, pepperoni and sausage. You can never go wrong with a combo. This was pretty darn good. All the yummy saltiness from the meats, and the veggies were great. The pizza crust was a bit on the thicker side and dough like in the middle. And the slices are huge so it's more on the thicker side, rather than thin. Either way this is a solid must!\n_Pesto Veggie ($4.25) I wanted to try this since it's different and l love pesto. This was very good, you really get that deep flavor of earthy pesto flavor. The veggies zucchini, mushrooms, onions, olives and tomatoes. The crust was also perfectly crisp. The cheese just melts and oozes as you bite into it. Because they are huge and they add a generous amount of toppings it's easier to cut it with a knife and fork, and you get more in the middle than use your hands and get in that bad boy!\n_Clam and Garlic ($4.25) I had to try this seems this is one of those rare kinds. And it was pretty popular on yelp. Definitely not for those whom aren't too crazy about garlic. I can smell the garlic right away. As soon as you bite into it, you get that potent flavor and aroma from the garlic, and the sea like flavor of the clam. A good mix, but after a few bites it got a little too rich for me. The garlic was just very overpowering. I felt bad for my gf since she's allergic to garlic, I probably reeked so bad hahah. But I'm glad I got to give it a try. \n\nAlthough I prefer thin sliced pizza, and less doughy, this was a nice change to try.

I'm on vacay though I took the L on that one. The guy lets me know he'll bring it over to me. He puts the two regular slices down and it's clear, this is not two regular slices. Maybe I should have asked for plain slices? It's all square pizza with all sorts of stuff on it. I honestly couldn't tell you what this thing had on it. I was too tired to ask or care. I proceed to eat. When you're hungry--as I was--anything you bite into is usually heaven, but it wasn't anything special so I'm surprised by all the reviews here. Cheese wasn't especially good. Sauce was like something out of a college kitchen. Crust was ok.\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend going here. I thought the price was high and the pizza not only didn't live up to the hype, but seemed more like college kitchen pizza than anything. The folks here are pretty nice though.", "author": "Miguel C."}

Plus the experience was awesome despite the place being really busy.\n\nI had gotten here a little before they opened, watching from the outside as the view at the window opened up for the pizzas to see. I also parked like a few blocks away on a Saturday which was probably a stroke of luck on my part.\n\n*side note: a lady saved me from being runover at the corner too, also possibly a stroke of luck. Or by proximity she didn't want blood on her, one of the two. \n\nSince they had a veggie option among the multiple pies, I grabbed that one. The size is quite good for the price, and the sauce is pesto. I'd say this would be one of the best applications of a pesto sauce I've had on a pizza since it was strong enough to be in every bite but not overpowering where you'd lose the taste of the veggies or the cheese. Plus I like a lot of pesto. If I wasn't trying a bunch of places that day, I probably would've taken one home for good measure. Maybe even a whole pie if I lived close enough. I also liked the crust for it more than the other places I went since it was thicker and had more flavor to it in comparison.\n\nI contemplated a beer and the guy at the front recommended a fieldwork ipa. Worked really well with the meal. I continued to banter with the people over beer at the front til it got really busy. Friendly, cool people. Kinda wish it wasn't so busy at times but what can you do.\n\nI'd certainly come by again for the whole experience, and hopefully when I'm not battling the crowd.", "author": "David C."}

Each slice is around $4 BTW.\n\nFun Facts:\nGolden Boy Pizza has been around since 1978 and expanded to several locations before scaling back down to just the O.G. location in North Beach. Arguably, their most famous pizza is the clam and garlic.\n\nAnd it makes total sense. Think about when your order linguini with clams and garlic or garlic butter saut\u00e9ed clams at a restaurant? Soon enough, you will be dipping that complimentary bread into the broth and asking for more like Oliver-freaking-Twist. Golden Boy simply combined all that together atop a handheld device called a focaccia pizza. \n\niPizza.\nGolden Boy - pure genius!\n\nThe pairing of clam and garlic goes together like love and marriage ahem or a horse and carriage. However, I need to point out, why no love for the special 3rd ingredient? Parsley! \n\nSince one of my many mottos is \"three is never a crowd\", let's take a moment for the chopped up parsley that is used as an herb as it should be and not as a useless fancy dinner plate ornament, capiche?\n\nSo I will call Golden Boy's \"numero uno\" pizza that knocks down all the other girlie rival pizzas like \"dominos\" [drumroll]... CPG. Clams. Parsley. Garlic. Who needs CPK anyway?\n\nThe CPG is simply delicious. It's a focaccia-style square-cut pizza so it's not too thin and not too thick. Like Goldilocks, Golden Boy is just right. But I think the golden refers to the perfectly golden crust on the bottom of each slice.\n\nThey do offer a few other options like pepperoni, sausage, and vegetarian but don't be a square, get at least one slice of the CPG.

I stumbled upon Golden Boy Back in 2014 and have been going here every time I'm in San Francisco. The pizza slices are big squares filled with flavor. My favorite is the combo or sausage pizza. I recently went here with my mom and we ordered two sausage slices and one pepperoni slice. My mom ordered a beer and they gave her a different sample of beer so she could try them. The workers were very helpful and nice. The atmosphere of this place is great, especially if you go at night. They are open late and only accept cash. This is my favorite place to get pizza and hangout. The ambiance is lively. The bathroom and walls are filled with a variety of cool stickers. Definitely make a stop here when you are in the area!", "author": "Ismael P."}

We were trying to not spend an arm and a leg for meals yet enjoy something local.  We selected Golden Boy off of Yelp without reading too much and I am so glad we did it this way.  The decor was not something we would normally pick when we are with our kids (ages 10, 15 and 16) yet none of that mattered and we all enjoyed it.  Actually, the decor added to the entire experience.  The staff was friendly and helpful as soon as we walked in (order at counter as soon as you walk in).  We then spent a bit walking and waiting to find some seats as there are not a lot of seating areas and the place stayed packed and busy.  Since turnover of customers keeps moving, we were able to grab some seats in time for our pizza.  THIS WAS DELICIOUS!  Even my husband who is from Chicago and has lived in NY loved this pizza.  Do spend some time reading the menu posted on the wall behind the counter too, it is great!  We loved the pizza so much that we almost went back for a second meal even though we had limited days to enjoy various places.  Can't wait to return to Golden Boy Pizza!", "author": "Stephanie D."}

I miss it so much. I never had seafood on a pizza, but this was a great introduction. The pesto is not overwhelming, and compliments the clams to add a bit of freshness to the slice. I'm dreaming of a tv night with a bottle of white wine and just this pizza. If you have PC pizza you don't need a girlfriend. \n\nVEGETARIAN PIZZA WAS GOOD\nNot as memorable as the PC, but how can you top that? The onions on this are slightly caramelized, and make this worth the trip for any veggie person. \n\nEach slice is roughly 4-5 inches squared and it's about $4.50/slice.

They serve pizza by the slice, which I think is pretty cool. They are open pretty late, which I also like a lot. I am not from San Francisco, but it seems like this is a go-to spot for people after a night of drinking. The first time I came here, it was around 1am on a Saturday, and the line was hella long. I got a couple slices of cheese pizza, and it was probably one of the best cheese pizza's I've ever had. I normally don't get cheese pizza, but that was all they had at the moment, and I didn't want to wait for Pepperoni or Sausage.\nThe pizza style is a little different than at most places since it seems to be made on focaccia bread. The slices are also cut up into rectangles.\n\n\nTHE BAD: The location is very, very small. This pizza spot pretty much looks like a bar. There is actually just a bar as the sitting area inside. The line pretty much starts out the door since the only register is right at the door. Getting your pizza during busy times is awkward since you have to squeeze back out the door that has a long line of people trying to order. Plan on taking your pizza to-go since the location has very limited seating available.\n\n\nBOTTOM LINE: You should definitely try this pizza place out. I've come back multiple times when I'm in the area, and the pizza has always been really good. I would also say that the pizza is relatively well priced.", "author": "Daniel A."}

When in Rome, do as the Romans do so on my first trip I got a slice of the Clam and Garlic pizza.  I don't particularly love clams or garlic but I did really enjoy this slice of pizza which also has wilted spinach or pesto on it - something green.  Neither the clams nor garlic were overpowering and the meal reminded me of a linguine with clam sauce.  On the next trip I tried the veggie pizza and really enjoyed that too. Because Sicilian pizza is thick many people eat it with a knife and fork.  But if utensils aren't for you, I found it easy to eat with my hands by slicing my square piece into thin strips.  BF used a knife and fork to enjoy his pepperoni pizza.\n\nGolden Boy kinda feels like a trendy, dive bar that serves pizza.  You order just inside the door and then the restaurant (using that term loosely) is dark and the walls are cover with corrugated metal and then wallpapered with stickers.  I really like the stickers that are interesting and tell a tale about who sat on the stool and enjoyed pizza before me but some of the stickers seemed more like vandalism and less like a fun form of pop art.  \n\nI think if I got the pizza to go or came here for late night drunk chow, I would give this place five stars. I just might not be cool enough for the funky wall d\u00e9cor.", "author": "Courtney K."}

Definitely not for us! We prefer to not waste our calories on food that probably tastes better when drunk (as more than half the line was)- save the time and save your money, spend a bit more and get some real (good) pizza that doesn't taste like the crust was made with a Pillsbury dough boy roll-out dough.", "author": "Jessica K."}

Seeing the tiny little storefront and a barely fitting line out the door, I was a little concerned because I had my mom and dad with me. As we finally wedged our way through the entrance, I glanced at the freshly baked trays of pizza displayed near the window. You order at the register (cash only, ATM in the back) and they bring the pizza to you. The employee was friendly and despite being busy, still managed to bring us water and food promptly. I also like how you can watch them swirl, knead, and make the dough!\n\nThe interior of the restaurant is TINY. There are maybe only about 6 stools with a slim counter for seating. Coming with just 1 friend may have worked but I came with two older folks - the stools were also kind of awkwardly placed for me because there isn't a bar to rest your feet on and you can't pull them out. They're shoved almost too inward. There's also a strange shelf that blocks the already dim lighting on about a third of the already slim 10\" counter. If they allowed for unfixed stools that might have made it more comfortable. The residual heat from the ovens also made it really hot inside.\n\nThe selections were pretty good but I wish they had hamburger/beef or chicken as well. We opted for the clam and garlic, vegetable, and cheese pizzas. A single slice is $3 - $4. A slice and a half would be a good meal for me. The slices are piping hot and about 6\"x6\". The clam and garlic was very fresh and perfectly salty. I also appreciated how it wasn't fishy tasting. The thicker crust is simply perfect - crispy on the outside, doughy, soft, and breadlike on the inside. The vegetable and cheese pizzas were also solid. \n\nThe food was pretty good, but the discomfort from the seating, lack of options for payment or toppings made me take some stars off :*( I would definitely recommend doing takeout!", "author": "Anita N."}

Don't get me wrong - it's still good and definitely worth a try. But coming here again isn't worth spending 25+ min looking for street parking and getting yelled at from other drivers because Erick T. was pretending to be an Uber driver parked in the middle of the street with his blinkers on. Guess it was reasonable for him to get yelled at because he was was the source of traffic while I ran inside and ordered to go. I'd totally pay $$$ for a parking lot but there was unfortunately none nearby. I guess this is what needed to be done in order to simply grab a slice of the famous Clam Garlic pizza.\n\nThe Clam Garlic pizza. Sounds so unique and so interesting... well, it did taste very unique and interesting just like you'd imagine. There was surprisingly tons of garlic on the pizza which I absolutely loved because I love garlic, but I prefer to have clams and garlic with my pasta or soup dishes. Or maybe it's because the clam was room temperature so my pizza wasn't really hot? As you all know, the best pizza is always really hot with stringy cheese after each bite. Yum. :0) Dunno, but a regular italian sausage combo pizza from Pizza My Heart would've probably fulfilled my pizza craving for that night. \n\nRestaurant is extremely small - maybe about 10 bar style seats. Expect to doggy bag your pizza and eat it at home, which TONS of people do! Maybe you can throw it in the microwave too.\n\nP.S. Check out the bathroom! Sort of dark for my liking but sort of cool!", "author": "Christina L."}

The smells coming from this place are intoxicating and being that I live about 30 steps from this place I always find myself fighting a battle of should I grab a slice or not-no lie. \n\nThey don't make it any easier by having fresh pizzas sitting on display through a glass window. It's kind of a quick stop and go place. You basically pull up, say what you want, get out the way, and wait for them to either warm it up for you or immediately wrap up a fresh slice if you're on the go.\n\nIt's limited seating inside and I've only gotten to-go orders so I can't speak on how it is on the inside. The pizzas are great! I've had the veggie and combo and they're bomb. I love the bread to filling ratio- not too much bread and just enough filling. I'm not a big bread fan, so the slices here are perfect for me. \n\nIndividual slices will run you under $5 but they're a decent size for the price you pay. ALSO, it's CASH ONLY, which is probably my only complaint, but do what you do. \n\nWill I be back? I'll probably get some at the end of the week, so yes.", "author": "Michael T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-06-24", "description": "If you're looking for a quick slice, or something inexpensive and filling, Golden Boy Pizza is the place for that. It's a small, old-school pizza counter that can easily be missed, but slightly more noticeable at night when the neon-lighted hand with index finger pointed towards Golden Boy is lit up. The pizza is displayed by the window. The interior is a long narrow bar with very busy graffiti & tin-wall decor. \n\nMr. Joy & I once got a few slices here for V-Day, because pizza sounds so much more satisfying than a boring prix fixe menu. \nPlus, we both like focaccia, especially when it's fresh, fluffy, and warm. I haven't had too many Sicilian, or focaccia-style pizzas, but Golden Boy's pizza does execute well. The thick crust has a nice crunch. It is also quite fluffy and not too chewy, so it doesn't end up feeling like you're chewing on a lot of bread. \n\nI've tried the Pepperoni, Combo, & Clam & Garlic. Each slice or square is pretty big and can feel heavy pretty quickly.\nPepperoni is always good. \nThe Combo is not bad, but the vegetables could use more roasting time and a little more seasoning. \nThe Clam & Garlic pizza is covered with chopped cilantro. A lot of people mistake it for pesto at first glance. It seems like a lot of people point to the Clam & Garlic and refer to it as 'pesto.' Sometimes the person working the counter gets pretty annoyed repeating, 'That is the clam & garlic' all day long. I would be annoyed too, but can't they just make signs? \nAnyways, it's good to try, but not great. Sometimes, it tastes more like garlic & cilantro than anything else. On the plus side, the clams are nice & savory, and are covered in cheese, so that prevents them from tasting too chewy. \n\nThere's also a pretty nice beer selection. Bummer that they do not accept cards. Cash-only is inconvenient, but for about $3-$4 a slice, I guess I can't complain too much.", "author": "Joy W."}

The pizza is hearty and although thick, I love that the outer crust is crunchy & seasoned.. almost tasted like garlic bread. One square slice of the pizza washed down with Stella on tap was more than enough for me. And to think I actually debated ordering 2 slices. I'll definitely be back to try the garlic clam pizza!\n\n-- Update: I returned for the garlic clam pizza and it was delicious!

And let me just say this much I made the big mistake of just getting once slice, I should of gotten two, especially at the price of ($4.50). This place has definitely left an impression on me, one that has me torn between the other two North Beach pizza restaurants I like. But, this place isn't the \"Golden Boy\" for no reason. Let me rant about this place for a little bit....\n\n2 - 28 - 16\nMy Mission : To grab something quick to eat and finish watching the Oscars. I was wanting to get back in time to see if Mr DiCaprio was going to take home that best male Oscar....anyway as to not stray so far away from the point of the review. I asked my bartender at Grant and Green..\"Yo I need something to grub on to balance my buzz level\" he said \"Golden Boy Pizza Kid\" so me being a the Yelper I am I stepped outside G&G (Grant and Green) and as I was about to type the place in on Yelp I just looked to my left and seen the small line and then the amazing smell.....yea no need to \"Yelp it Out\" at that moment \"I saw the sign, I opened up my eyes and saw the sign\" Golden Boy Pizza, even the finger pointed to where it was at.....cleaver!\n\n5/5 stars for the way they displayed their product....fresh and hot pizza in the window which just made you want to crack the window and steal some slices and run! Man I was in shock to see the pizza leaving faster than they could replace it in the window. I was hoping the greedy people ahead of me hurry up because I was hungry, buzzing and wanting to see if Leo was going to get that Oscar. All the slices they had looked amazing but one stood put in particular as I pulled out my phone and checked out some reviews and pics of this place, as well with checking in. The Clam Garlic Pizza seemed to be the star attraction, based off reviews and the two dudes in front of me talking about it. I like, Pizza, Clams, and Garlic soooooo my mind was made up.\n\nI finally got in and the fast moving cleark greeted me with a \"Man that's a dope chain\" and I smile and thanked him and said....\"I want that Clam Garlic Pizza Slice Yo!\" he nodded and gave me a nice and piping hot slice, it had just been replaced so I came at a good time :D I hurried back to G&G with my slice and \"The Oscar for Best Male went too.....\" Leonardo DiCaprio just as I had hoped it would and in the midst of the cheering I took my bite into the pizza slice.....\n\nThis pizza is unlike any seafood pizza I've ever had let me tell you. The crust was buttery, light and surprisingly not to greasy,  it had a nice crisp to it yet it had that nice chew to it. SF Focaccia bread style pizza, the perfect balance! The clams wasn't over cooked, and the garlic wasn't overbearing, everything complimented each other nicely, over all this was a nice slice of pizza and I honestly regretted not getting two. Because when I ran back the dude said it was going to be a wait for the next pizza....dang I had somewhere to be so waiting wasn't really an option at that moment.\n\nWill I be Back?\n\nUmm..Yea! This place makes bomb pizza and propabubly moves to \"First\" in my favorite North Beach pizza joints. This place is like the \"Gold\" standard when it comes to pizza now in my book. This place is small, but has a lot of character and judging by the consistent action and the quickness of the pizza moving here, I'm not ths only person that things this place is special.\n\nAs always, Yelp your own experience if you come here, take a snapshot and get a slice of that Clam Garlic Pizza!", "author": "Tre S."}

After my umpteenth failed attempt of trying to eat at Tony's, I figured there had to be a legit alternative. Cue Golden Boy, the answer to all my pizza prayers. \n\nThis place is my holy grail of Sicilian style pizza, not to mention that it just oozes cool. We arrived on National Hangover Day (aka New Years morning) about 15 minutes before opening and there was already a motley crew lined up. \n\nThe whole process went a little something like this: drool at selection of pies through window, order the combo and garlic & clam, make the bf and friend order all the other types (cheese, pepperoni, veggie), pay and find a seat in the small bar-style area, listen to Depeche Mode and Bowie, share hot pizza, die of happiness and watch my soul drift into pizza heaven. \n\nPerfect crispy crust, just the right amount of cheese and fresh toppings, beer, good service, and cheap prices. Could not ask for anything more, other than a clone of this place down in LA.", "author": "Kate K."}

I don't want to hear about San Francisco is not a pizza town, or how that Tony guy has a bunch of award winning pies near by, or how this isn't classic NYC thin crust preparation, or how you have to ascend into a tourist trap to acquire it, or blahblahblahblahblah. It's PERFECT.\n\nI can't think of a better Sicilian-style pizza I've had on the West Coast. Maybe Lamonica's in Westwood, CA rivals Golden Boy for taste but that place is a drag to spend any time in. In contrast, Golden Boy is awesome to hang around here, have a couple of slices of pepperoni or sausage, have a beer and take in the mostly dive-y atmosphere they've been hosting for several decades. I can't really comment on the clam pizza because gross but people I know who enjoy that sort of thing think it's pretty tasty.\n\nWhat's not to like?

This Sicilian-style square pizza is doughy and the toppings are fresh and tasty. I love the combo, it has great veggies and meat! This place also has an amazing assortment of beer (and root beer) on tap. The Fieldwork IPA is my current favorite, and the root beer is actually incredible.  You can grab a slice to-go, which I now do pretty much anytime I visit the North Beach neighborhood.

Although the pieces of the clam are not super present, the combination with the garlic and cheese creates a nice a savory bite.  \n\nCombination:  I enjoyed it but it was hardly anything special.

All varieties of pizza are great if clams don't float you boat.\n\nNow for those of you are from out of town, I do have a bit of a warning.

Lines are outrageously long (anytime of the day) and if you're looking to cut your wait time, I'd suggest calling ahead, ordering a sheet, and finding some friends to share it with.  When you do that, you don't have to wait in the long line and it'll probably take about 20 minutes before you a get a fresh sheet.  That's exactly what we did.  So after the many times where I've only experienced Golden Boy the day after warmed up, I finally had the opportunity to try it fresh from the oven.\n\nI will preface that I'm not a pizza connoisseur and I'm not a huge pizza enthusiast but I'll have a slice once in awhile.  Golden Boy is good, but not 30+ minute wait long good.  At that point, I'd be happy with a slice of Pizza Hut.  Anyways, I've tried slices of the combination, sausage, and garlic clam.  My favorite being the garlic clam followed by the combination.  Some people find shellfish weird on pizza, but if you're into it, it's quite tasty. If you want to play it on the safer side, the combination would be my second favorite.\n\nI'd probably lean more towards a 3.5 than 4, but I rounded up cause it is some of the better pizza joints I've tried.  Def not worth the long wait though just to get a slice.  20 minutes for a sheet though?  Yeah, sure why not.", "author": "Carena N."}

The flavor was kind of bland in my opinion and there are not much of a texture from the pizza. When you think of eating a clam, you would be able to taste the clam and its kind of chewy but not rubbery texture. But you cannot find the seafood flavor or the texture from the clam.

Actually, whenever anyone in my family ventures to SF it's pretty much a requirement to bring Golden Boy or some other kind of food back to Sac! Anyways, if you want good square pizza, go here. They display it sitting in the window, but crisp it up deliciously for you to consume. The reason I like this Sicilian pizza better than others is because I'm not a huge fan of tons of bread when I eat pizza (I usually prefer NY style). However, Golden Boy does Sicilian style pizza the right way. It's perfectly crisp, and expertly seasoned. \n\nWhether you're sober or lit, check this place out. It's open late-the only drawback is parking, but you can pay in a little lot right up block on the opposite side of the street if you don't want to waste awhile trying to grab free street parking. \n\nThis pizza is also great to go, but take it somewhere where you can heat it properly!", "author": "Chelsie H."}

Back of the line, buddy. \n\nInside is a little cramped, but only because it was crowded, and that makes sense, because the pizza was incredible. We got some kind of combo pizza; veggies and sausage -- that sort of thing. My buddy got a veggie pizza because he thinks plants can't feel. \n\nEverything was delicious. Best pizza I've had in a long time. Not too greasy. Not too much bread. Perfect. \n\nPro tip: if you don't wanna wait inside, the large window near the entrance opens.

I'm glad I did.\n\nFirst, I would say golden boy compared to Tony's is spokes to oranges as a comparison because Tony's is while pie sit down and golden both is by the slice and a bar.\n\nSecondly, food wise golden boy versus Tony's is again a draw in my book as both are excellent but it depends on what type of environment you are looking for.\n\nGolden boy only does Sicilian style and you can see the pizza from the window outside. Dinner may think this means the pizza is not fresh but oh no no! The pizza here moves fast.\n\nI went with two slices of pepperoni and one slice sausage.

IF you like pizza.\n\nFirst of all, it's called Golden Boy. Don't you just trust a name like that?  Then, there's often a line outside, which might be off-putting... if you didn't see how excited and enthusiastic and UNRELENTING all those faces in line are. Instead of turning away, you're convinced of the goodness that awaits and determined to stand there until you get your slice. It doesn't take long before the wafting smell hits you, and suddenly you don't mind standing in line at all - you're happy just to bask in the garlic-oregano aroma.\n\nIt doesn't matter what you order when you get to the front, as long as you have the cash to cover it (and you don't need much, the slices are quite reasonable and just one would make a meal... but trust me, you'll want two). Surprise bonus: plenty of beers on tap, including seasonals like my personal favorite the Deschutes Fresh Squeezed IPA. Does it get any better? \n\nIt does. The whole thing is the right balance of bad-ass and best-in-class.\n\nBeastie Boys on the stereo. Cheerful, yet snarky bar staff. A bathroom completely covered in the signatures of pizza-eaters past. Bumper and band stickers line the ceiling and the walls. The list of rules (which you'll likely only notice after it's too late) entertains you, and warns you, \"if you don't see it, don't ask for it.\" Next time you'll know... and there WILL be a next time. And you will 'do the clam.'\n\n(Disclaimer: In case you're wondering why I give this a four and not a five, there are two super small reasons. One: I'm kind of mozzarella intolerant, so I wish there were an option with low or no mozz, or that I could ask for one... but the rules state I cannot, and rules is rules. Two: if you need to take one or two slices to-go, they wrap it in red and white paper - which is charming, but impractical.)", "author": "Catie F."}

Whenever I am out in this area with friends, we usually end up at Golden Boy when our night ends (it's open until 2:30 AM on Fridays and Saturdays...clutch.) I agree with most of the other reviews on this place - no frills, cash only, pick up your slice at the window and eat on the go pretty much. I've had a bite of the clam garlic that this place is known for, and it was pretty darn good. Pretty unique and nothing I've ever had before. The garlic balances out the seafood-y taste of the clams well, and the herbs and cheese bring it together. I usually get a slice of the veggie pizza which is loaded with a good amount of veggies. But what I like most is the pesto sauce on the veggie slices - yum! \n\nHighly recommend this place. Minus one star because it's cash only. The wait can also get pretty bad here, but I've only ever been late at night on Fridays and/or Saturdays. So you can imagine with the popularity of Golden Boy in conjunction with indecisive, incoherent, drunk humans, the wait can get very long.

Already made, the pizzas are lined up and ready to eat. Topped with tomato sauce, cheese, and a variety of other ingredients. \n\nOnce you enter, you can tell that's it pretty much all about the pizza. Grungy, dark, bar table seating, no frills; this place has an edgy, cool, I don't give a damn type of feel. Just gimme my food, yo. \n\nIf I had my way, I would've probably ordered one slice from each pizza, but I contained myself and settled on three separate slices. \n\nOne for brekkie, lunch, and dinner. That's my idea of meal planning. \n\nSo, my first slice was combination. It consisted of sausage, pepperoni, zucchini, tomatoes, and mushrooms. My favorite slice by far.\n\nI also ordered a slice of the clam and garlic. For those who really like seafood flavor this would be a great choice. The clam flavor was really pronounced and was an equal component to the garlic. I looooove seafood, but I'd have to say that this one was a tad bit overpowering for me.\n\nThe third slice was good ol' pepperoni and cheese. Who could ever go wrong with such a classic combination? Hit. The. Spot. So good. \n\nIf you're a fan of thick crust, you'll love it here. The bread is so soft, moist, chewy, and delicious. They even heat it up right before serving so you'll get it piping hot.\n\nThis place is cash only, but there are plenty of banks in the area for ATM use. Pizzas are roughly $2-4 per slice. \n\nTheir hours are prime for those who like to have a drink at the local bars and in need of munchies afterwards.

It is very hole in the wall type business with a long and narrow interior. Lots of cool stickers and tagging along the bar seats and bathroom. It's really cool to stare at while chowing down. I recommend bringing a sharpie so you can make your visit a little more memorable. Who knows, maybe one day you'll be bringing your kids here and can point out the tag from the first visit you made. \n\nIn a really great walking area of North Beach/Little Italy.

The pizza came out to be $4.75 for a SMALL ASS RECTANGULAR SHAPED SLICE. For almost $5, I expected this pizza to be much larger by the slice and for it to be good quality. The first few bites around the edges were good- they were baked to crisp which I love. But then once it got to the middle, I felt like I was eating a pool of grease. IT WAS DISGUSTING. Not to mention the service I received from the man with the glasses re heating my pizza was very rude with an attitude (that's probably why they don't get as much tip and had to put it on their wall to remind customers to tip their servers).

It was somewhat close to our hotel on Sutter, took a walk there and noticed the night life around the area.  The line was long, out to street long.  Then again, the ordering area is by the entry door, so the line is understandable.  It was rather chilly out, and I hoped the pizza would be worth the wait.  Well, 2 slice of cheese, 3 slice of sausage was $22.  I guess that's normal in San Fran.  They were square pizzas, with really thick dough, maybe around 5\"x5\" per slice.  It was pre-made, sitting behind the glass shelve.  It goes into the oven for a quick reheat, so it's not exactly fresh.  It wasn't great as I hoped.  The dough was too thick for me, and too little cheese and too little sauce.  The g/f thought it was the best thing ever, then again, she believes the hype of anything from anybody.  Inside, there were no heating, the door was open for the people waiting outside, so the cold breeze just kept on drafting in.

However, it must be noted that I'm just not that into Sicilian style pizza (the thick dough, square cut pizza). I much prefer a traditional thin NY slice. \n\nNow, if that's your preferred style, you may like this place. It's definitely Californian style, where as in they do interesting toppings.\n\nI just thought the dough was too chewy and kinda underbaked? It's more bread than pizza. Also, it's not that cheap. I'm from the East Coast, home of the $1 slice (okay, I'd rather pay a bit more for better slices, but still....). CA pizza ain't cheap and it's a gripe of mine. \n\nAlso, there's often a long wait and I like hot out-of-the-oven fresh pizza. This is the type of place that it's already been baked and then they have to warm it up for you again. \n\nIn Yelp's perfect words for a 2 star review, \"Meh...I've experienced better\"", "author": "Rebecca G."}

However, Golden Boy is like that friend that you have not seen for years but can pick up right where you left off.  \n\nI love myself a good slice of Sicilian pizza which was one of my slice of choice back in Jersey but with deep dish and attempts at NY slices being more common, Sicilian style seemed to have taken a back seat in the Bay Area.  It was probably 10 years before I had a slice of Sicilian the way I remembered it.  Bad news is it was down in San Diego.  As I lamented to the owner of Sicilian Thing that it took me so long to find a comparable slice of Sicilian but yet they are still a plane ride away, he pointed me to Golden Boy in SF for a closer slice.  Between $3-$4 for a slice of goodness, you can grab a seat inside, eat it standing outside, or take it to go.  If to go, pop into an oven or toaster oven at 350 for about 10 minutes to refresh and it is just as good.  Just don't microwave it as the crispiness of the Sicilian style doesn't stand up well.   We happened to find a space right around the corner so bought 12 slices to go between us for lunch the next day and to share.  You may find a choice of combo, cheese, pepperoni, vegetarian, clam and garlic, and sausage so something for everyone! \n\nNote:  It is cash only here and you need to order minimum of 3 slices to get a box to go.  Line up, order, pay and either take a seat inside or wait outside where they slide you your pizza box through the window.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

They also serve beer at this joint which was totally up our alley! The staff was a little cold at first but totally opened up to us by the end. They just needed some of the charm our group had to offer! The gal that helped us was having a baby on Christmas Day so if she reads this, an early CONGRATULATIONS!\n\nFor my slice and beer, I got the clam and garlic slice for $4 and a PBR pint for $3. The beer was cold and refreshing. Now the pizza sounded pretty weird but OMG, it was such an awesome sliced! It was more of a deep dish style but not a true deep dish. The bread was thick however they also packed on the toppings to balance the bread. Along with the garlic and clams was cilantro. This pizza was packed with flavor, perfectly crispy and soooo delicious! I can't wait to return for another slice. \n\nDo yourself a favor and get down to this place.

Let me just say that it's probably a good thing I live on the other side of the country because I would be here all the time. For those of you who know me, this would be my Harbor of the West!  I was only in town 6 days and I ate here 3 times! \nOne night I went with another Yelper and it was the first time in the restaurant for both of us. Boy were we pleasantly surprised! The pizza is just way beyond anything I anticipated! We were able to sit once we ordered, and if your only getting a couple slices and drinks it's really cheap. The pizza is amazing of course, and I really like the atmosphere of the place. I also had a good experience with all of the workers. They were all very nice and helpful even when it was packed. This is a pretty small restaurant with limited bar seating, but it's so cool! Even with the long line you will normally see here it's really not that hard to find a seat because the few times I was there I noted people who sit don't hang out too long. They sit and eat then leave. I did sit next to a few people who were very friendly and didn't mind chatting while they ate.\nI noticed the pricing board and whole pizzas are a little expensive, but if I lived in the area I would never mind paying because I would know I'm getting a great pizza! It's too bad I could not bring any pizza home with me, so I did the next best thing and bought one of their t-shirts. You just need to ask for one and its $20.  I was very happy to bring a bit of Golden Boy Pizza back to New Orleans with me, and I can't wait to get back to San Francisco for more pizza!\n \n(A side note... Once you order and sit you can order more pizza or drinks from your seat if you just catch the attention of a worker and this is a cash only operation)", "author": "Kate D."}

We both had the cheese pizza and ordered to eat in since we were lucky that 2 barstools had just opened up at the otherwise full counter (max seating 20ish). Excellent service (very funny too) and delish food. We were served from a new pie straight out of the oven and piping hot...no reheat needed even though they will heat up the ones in the window for you if you are served from there. One relatively fair size 'slice' which is really a 4inX4in deep dish square was $4.  A full tray of cheese was $40. Cash only. TOTALLY WORTH IT.

Pizza is an example of a food that should be kept as simple as possible to bring out each individual topping. When done right it is an example of great comfort food in addition to being quite the tasty way to get rid of alcohol in the system.\n\nNo1DP requested to eat a good pizza the next time he saw me because there isn't good pizza anywhere in Japan. I combined his desire of pizza with wanting to explore the North Beach part of SF.\n\nThe restaurant, though small, shows a bit of character. As you eat your pizza you can see what other patrons leave behind in the form of stickers. The No1DP and I had a good time deciphering what the stickers were trying to advertise. \n\nGood beer selection but there were more IPAs offered than other types of beer. I told my server that I wasn't too fond of IPA's but was recommended a beer that still had IPA on its name. When I tried it the beer was not too hoppy.\n\nNo1DP ordered the cheese pizza ($2.75). His philosophy on pizza is that he likes to keep the toppings to a minimum so that the main ingredients can shine - mainly the crust, tomato sauce and cheese. A sign of a good cheese pizza is that the cheese immediately falls when separated from the pizza. He enjoyed his pizza and is comparable to what he's had in Chicago.\n\nI had the Clam and Garlic ($3.75). I enjoyed the thick crust on the pizza as well as the generous amounts of garlic and clam. It was generous enough that I downed my beer so that I wouldn't have to ask for mints. No1DP tried my pizza and liked it as well.\n\nThis place is good if you like your pizza with a thick crust and for SF travelers on a budget: you can get a good slice of pizza and beer for less than $20.", "author": "Isabella B."}

Actually doctors probably don't drink or eat late, and it probably wouldn't be pizza. \n\nI knew they closed at 11 on Thursdays so didn't expect to get a slice then but sure enough I was just walking by around 12 and saw they were still selling slices out the window. \n\nIt was a take what you can get type of situation. I got one slice and needed it too. It was someone's \"great\" idea to start drinking at 3 o'clock (Moron!) and I was getting bit tipsy.\n\nNice crunch to an airy sicilian slice which hit the spot quite well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-19", "description": "NEW YORK THIN CRUST, CHICAGO DEEP DISH, SAN FRANCISCO FOCACCIA (CLAM GARLIC)\n\nSeveral years ago when I travelled to Italy I had a nirvana experience eating pizza. The importance wasn't toppings as they are emphasized in the US, but the crust. Without a great crust the toppings don't matter. The crust supports the toppings not the other way around. Have you had an experience of eating a pizza when the toppings were great but the crust was stale? If you did then you know what I'm talking about.\n\nI believe in this country there are three regions that have a distinct style of crust of a pizza: New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. While New York and Chicago are known for their thin crust and deep dish pizzas I really had to think about what San Francisco pizza known for. I concluded San Francisco pizza should be known for its usage of focaccia bread as a crust even though focaccia bread originated in Italy. The usage of focaccia bread as a pizza crust is what attracts people to Golden Boy Pizza in San Francisco. The first time I went to Golden Boy Pizza was several years ago at the North Beach Festival. I noticed the long line at this pizza joint and wondered why. After eating the focaccia bread crust I was hooked. That focaccia crust was crispy yet light. Normally I would only eat one slice of pizza because the crust was dense and stale. However I ate four slices of pizza at Golden Boy Pizza. Ever since then I was hooked.\n\nThere's a saying \"think outside the box\". Whereas pizza joints these days still focus on the same geometric figures of a circular pie and triangular slice, the pizza at Golden Boy Pizza is distinct with its own geometric features of a rectangular sheet of pizza with rectangular slice. In a sense Golden Boy Pizza is thinking outside the box by having a pizza shape like a box. If the pizza is sitting on the tray for a while the slice of pizza is heated again where you get that slightly charred crust that makes the crust light. There are only six toppings at Golden Boy Pizza. I'm not a vegetarian, but the pesto vegetarian is tasty. The sausage is my second favorite pizza because the sausage isn't thinly sliced in a small ball. However my favorite topping at Golden Boy Pizza is the clam garlic. This is somewhat similar to garlic fries in presentation but instead of fries you get diced clams. \n\nSome of the food that originated in San Francisco has made great contributions to American cuisine such as crusty sourdough French bread, Mission-style burrito, and fortune cookie. So what is San Francisco pizza? Since clam garlic is somewhat similar to garlic fries, which originated in the San Francisco Bay Area, and the usage of focaccia bread as a pizza crust is distinct from other regular crust I believe the \"official\" San Francisco pizza should be clam garlic on focaccia bread at Golden Boy Pizza. Which city has that specific pizza? I rest my case.", "author": "Gerald R."}

This City believes in yelp. Being from Atlanta our average restaurant is a couple hundred reviews, SF has thousands!! We did our whole trip on yelp. Lets talk about this awesome whole in the wall- \n\nAmbiance: This place is a dark seedy place with about 10 places to sit, its all ovens inside. Really a cash only to-go concept to me. Fresh pizza in the window, cramped space. I have to say, its what it says it is. Couple bar seats and maybe one or two tables. 4 stars, would have liked to not bump into people the whole time. \n\nFood: Pizza isn't what I expected, but it was awesome. They do a square cut pizza that's crunchy and delicious. We had a slice of pepperoni, cheese, \"everything,\" and the Clam and Garlic pizza. I would consider this a great lunch spot, but with so much in the North Beach area I would go somewhere else for dinner. 4 Stars. \n\nService: Exactly what they market. They had the pizza out in maybe 5-7 minutes. Nothing spectacular just fast service. 3 stars- right in the middle. \n\nLooks like the judges have voted and its 4 STARS!

I found a parking spot right at the door, I guess if I like it I'll be returning at 10 pm on Sundays because this seems too easy for a top reviewed place. Um, no line? Walked in and ordered right away from the braided beauty behind the counter. I had intended on ordering every available slice choice but it's a cash only joint and I wasn't about to pay their fees from the ATM in the back. I settled on a cheese and a pepperoni slice since I only had $8. I got it to go so it was wrapped in two pieces of checkered paper and stuffed in a bag. I was expecting a small box but no big deal. The dough is a thick pan style with a soft bottom crust. The only crunch you'll get is from the crispy cheese edges. It's doughy but not chewy. I'm pretty sure what gives this pizza the great flavor is the sauce. The dough is good, the cheese and seasonings are great, but the sauce is awesome! It makes the pizza. I'll be back, on a Sunday night at 10, with cash..", "author": "Staci C."}

Served with a knife and a fork, the pizza was toasted to perfection with a nice ratio of crust to cheese to toppings. We passed our slices around so we could try a bit of each.\n\n1. The combo - pretty much your typical combo pizza, nothing extraordinary, but a solid slice.\n2. The vegetarian pesto - a slight pesto flavor, but they could add more.\n3. The clams and garlic - probably my favorite of the three. It had a nice herb seasoning on top that made it unique and tasty.\n\nThe place has a nice casual feel with counter service and to-go options (good for those drunken nights when you HAVE to get a slice of Golden Boy or you're just on the go). They also have a nice beer selection. The employees are nice and attentive.\n\nBoxes are 50 cents, but bags are free.

I've tried their Clam and Garlic + Combination. C&G is better but the major fault is that the thick crust is just sloppily made. It is too flour-y, not crispy at all. I may have unrealistically high standard as I've tried Sicilian Pizza in Italy too but even compared to Escape from New York here, the size is double for the same price and it is at least equally good. \n\nAnd as always, for any \"hot\" and \"hip\" place, there is a long line and services aren't the best.

The slices are light on crust, big on flavor and they disappear down your gullet with a dangerous amount of ease. To optimize your pizza tasting, plan on ordering at least a slice of each flavor and split each slice into two, they are big enough to do so.\n\nYou are likely to encounter a line that goes out the door and down the block but don't be discouraged.

The cashier seemed pretty unmotivated to be friendly let alone show a bit of personality. One thing that really turned me off was how she lacked the skills to accommodate my friend being a vegetarian wanting to add ingredients to a cheese pizza. Her response was \"you have to order a whole pizza if you want to customize it...\". They have the ingredients to add to the pizza plus they reheat the pizza in the oven when you order by the slice. Why not go the extra mile for your customers to be happy, we would of paid for any extra charge it didn't even matter.

We didn't get 4.5 star pizza as the reviews suggest. Oh no. What we got was a warmed sandwich without the top. Yep. The dough was not pizza dough whatsoever. It was something that tasted like French bread. There was almost no red sauce on the sausage and little on the pesto. What makes pizza pizza is mainly the bread and sauce. The toppings were OK. They need to learn to make pesto like Hot Lips in Portland makes. But I guess that doesn't matter because their doing quite well per the reviews, and the long line we waited in. Well, the line wasn't too long actually, it was how long it took for each person to get their slice. Also, the bread is too thick, not just for a low carber which I am not, but for anyone.", "author": "Betsy B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-09-02", "description": "I've read the Yelp reviews and tried the pizza multiple times but honestly, I never understood the hype with Golden Boy.   The pizza is just meh and the only reason I can think of for the grand Yelp reviews is that the place is open late (until 2:30am on weekends) and everyone is either drunk or high when they're eating here and, well, we all know that everything is yummy when you're out having fun and under the influence.  I mean, really, I don't get the rave reviews otherwise.  \n\nGiven that it is a thick dough pizza, cooked in rectangular sheets and cut into squares, I guess it can be best described as pizza al taglio style.  I love thick dough pizza.  I like all styles of pizza but I especially love thick dough so you would think this pizza would be right up my alley but meh, it's not.  Although the clam and garlic is interesting, there's nothing really special here.  \n\nBut the most annoying thing about this place is their lack of reliability and it's that lack of reliability that makes this place a less than average experience for me.  For example, just today, I picked up an order for a work function.  Because the pizza was for a small seminar that my company was hosting and we needed to make sure we got the pizza when/how we wanted it, 2 days prior to the event (on a Monday), I phoned in the order (one sheet of pizza: half veggie and half clam) and was told that an advance order is not needed for a single sheet of pizza and to call back the day of.  I called about noon the day of and was told that the order that I wanted (for a 5:15pm pick up) could not be done because they pre-sauced all of the pizza dough and couldn't make a pizza that was half one sauce and half another and if I had only ordered at least a day in advance, they might have been able to accommodate.  Ok, first of all, really?  I tried to order in advance and was rejected!  Secondly, it was a Wednesday and this place was open 11:30am to 11:30pm that day.  By noon, they sauced all the dough for the entire day (12 hours)?  Where are they keeping all this pre-sauced, dried out dough (I mean, once it's sauced, you can't really cover the top without making a mess so this dough has to be laying out somewhere)? That's just gross and is probably part of the reason their pizza sucks.  \n\nSo, in response to their dumb, contradictory policies, I change my order to half pepperoni and half cheese - not at all what I originally wanted but at least the sauce matches.  I ask them to cut the pizza into smaller pieces and they agree.  At 5:15, I arrive to pick the pizza up.  The box is lukewarm and has obviously been sitting out for awhile.  Why did they make it so early and not at least bothered to keep it under a heat lamp?  Oh well, don't have time to deal with it now so I pay the $39 for the pizza plus a tip and start walking back to work.  While walking, it dawns on me that I should have checked the pizza before leaving so I look for a table and open the box - the pizza is cut wrong and we need it cut right because of the way we were planning to serve it.  So I walk back to get the thing re-cut and by the time they cut it and give it back, the pizza is already cold.  If this was purchased for personal reasons, I would have been disappointed but would have just re-heated it and chalked it up to the \"Golden Boy\" experience but this was purchased for a work function and their poor service resulted in us serving cold pizza late.  I might be a \"whatever, stuff happens\" kind of gal when it comes to my own personal pizza needs but I can't be that way when I'm representing my company.

My youngest gave me a bite of his slice so I could experience the pizza here and it was really good. The crust was well seasoned and the quality of the ingredients was good.

We stumbled in while waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant.  Upon walking in, they take your order, and yes, they are CASH only.   The most intriguing pizza was the garlic and clam --- and it did not disappoint.  The slice was gently warmed in the oven and served.  The crust had the perfect crunch, but the rest of pizza was fluffy (yes, I said fluffy).  It's an amazing combination. The garlic was pungent but not overpowering, and there was a uniform distribution of clams. \n\nThe menu and decor are entertaining, to say the least.

I got three different slices and I actually think the simple pepperoni was the best , it really allowed me to taste the sauce and it was great!

The slices are all way below $ 5.00 for all the pizza slices most ranging about $ 3.00 to $ 4.00 per slice. My boss and I went for lunch time and I had never been so Golden Boy Pizza it was. Since I work in North Beach we frequent many of the restaurants and eateries in North Beach. Who doesn't love pizza right? \n\nSince it was lunch time during the work week the vibe was calm and laid back. We went up and sat at the bar to watch all the wonderful pizzas come out. I knew I wanted to try the infamous Clams and Garlic pizza and I also selected the combination as well. The slices are quite large and packed with toppings the crust was flavorful and had a thicker crust. The combination came from straight out of the oven which was one of the reasons why I chose it. \n\nYou can rest assured the pizza doesn't \"sit\" as they sell pizza pretty rapidly so it is fresh,tasty, and hot. For me the infamous clam and garlic lived up to the hype! It was the right amount of garlic to clam ratio. It was quite good and filling. The combination was also delicious with plenty of toppings. I felt two pizza slices were plenty for me. They also have a good selection of beer to wash down that pizza with!  \n\nThe space inside was small but as I said we went for lunch during the week so it was busy but far from packed! With one beer and two slices of pizza my tab was under $ 10.00! Not bad at all for lunch! The service was quick and friendly too. The young lady and guy who was tending to my boss and I were efficient and fun. I would come back since I work in the area and after hours as well.

They did not seem to mind my pickiness about which slice I wanted (I'm all about that corner slice). You can take the slice to go, or you can seat yourself at the bar or one of the tables and dine in.

The mere thought of anything remotely fishy made my stomach churn. However, my friend had been raving about Golden Boy's for some time and we were suppose to go the night before after clubbing (closes at 2:30 AM on weekends) but it was another one of \"those\" nights and we (I) never made it there. \n\nWith a little convincing, I decided to give it a go. At least I was sober and would be able to enjoy the food rather than my usual drunktard etiquette of face shoveling...\n\nAs I walked into Golden Boy's, the mere sniff of the garlic that permeated into the air enticed me enough to want to order a slice of the Garlic Clam along with a Combo even though I was still hungover. \n\nGolden Boy's Sicilian style pizza is showcased at the front window and the menu is Drunktard Friendly. Can't talk straight? It's simple, just *point* at one of the 5 Choices: Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, Clam Garlic, Pesto and Combo ($2.75-$3.75). \n\nAfter several minutes of heating up in the oven, our slices were brought to us piping hot with ooey goeey cheese and vibrant toppings.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/PTFxtXS47ZVRCdZIrEWvGw?userid=eKUGKQRE-Ywi5dY55_zChg\n\nI must note that I HATE Focaccia with a passion. Something about the oily and dense texture is just very off putting to me. However, Golden Boy's focaccia pizza completely changed my mind. Fyi, the pizza slices are pretty hearty, so one square should be sufficient.\n\nCLAM GARLIC: MOUTHWATERING!\nThe focaccia's caramelized bottom crust was super crunchy with a flakey-like texture and the inside was doughy and chewy, but not too heavy. The garlic clam topping was PACKED with bold flavors; pungent and extremely garlicky with a sweetness from the clams (not fishy at all), saltiness from the cheese and a burst of freshness from the parsley. SOOOOO EFFEN GOOOD!\n\nCOMBO (Sausage, Pepperoni, Zucchini & Onions): GOOD!\nAfter having several bites of the Clam Garlic, the Combo was pale in comparison in terms of flavors which was to be expected. Although it was salty, savory and smoky from the sausage and pepperoni, it was nothing like the Clam Garlic which packed a big punch. \n\nWhether you're sober or drunk, if you come to Golden Boy's you MUST get the Clam Garlic pizza!

They have squared-shape slices instead of the traditional triangles. Their about $4-$5 each and they usually have cheese, pepperoni, vegetarian, combo, sausage and the infamous clams with garlic. I've tried them all and thought they were all pretty good. However, I must say, the clams and garlic slice was super garlicky. The garlic overpowered the entire slice which made me feel a bit disappointed. As for the interior, it's more of a bar-scene. But there are plenty of stools you can hop on. The restroom is pretty crazy. The walls are covered with stickers and graffiti. I'm not complaining though.\n\nWould I still come back? YOU BET.", "author": "Laura T."}

My taste buds are always on point even if I may have been slightly intoxicated due to Santa Con festivities. Plus you can never go wrong when you stand in line for literally 45 minutes to get a slice of delicious pizza.\n\nSo where do I start. the first thing you will notice about this place is the shape of the pizza. SQUARE BEEZY. That's right. It's no longer a triangle. This place said screw the 3 corners, I'm rolling with 4. And so the square pizza began and man oh man was it good.\n\nI had the supreme topping one which included almost everything. The pizza here is gooey and crispy at the same time. The crust is amazing (not too hard, not too soft), but just right. This is starting to sound like goldilocks, but it's the truth. So going back to the pizza. They have lots of different kinds and you can't go wrong with any of them. Slices are pretty pricey though if you are used to dollar pizzas in nyc. It's around $4-5 but the square isn't even that big. Though I will say that I will gladly pay for a slice. So do yourself and your tastebuds a favor and hit it up.", "author": "Nathan L."}

If you get there around 1am, you won't find much of a line.  Either way, I think the wait is worth it. Their pizza is made on focaccia bread so you really can't go wrong there. The crust was delicious, fluffy, thick, crispy on the outside soft on the inside. I had the veggie pesto slice and it was pretty large all for $4; the pesto sauce on that pie is deeeelish. The guy taking orders at the counter was friendly and efficient which I appreciated because it can tough dealing with the late night rowdy crowd!

We stood about 30 minutes in line; I think we were considered \"lucky\" - by the time we got our pizza, the line was at least double what it was when we first got there.  At least we got some extra entertainment waiting in line by watching those that were obviously a little too intoxicated - one girl somehow toppled over the homeless guy's guitar case and broke it.  Her BF proceeded to pay him off with some \"herbs\" from a sandwich baggie.  Only in SF I suppose.\n\nGal took our order from the walk-up window; we ordered our pizza by the slices.  These are square, sicilian style slices of pizza - just the right amount of thickness.  They'll grab your slices and toss it into the oven for a nice reheat.  There were about 4 or 5 selections to choose from - combo, cheese, pepperoni, and clam.  We didn't have enough clam to go around, so I took a slice of combo.  It's good pizza - tasty and it was fresh.  Just the right amount of crunch on the crust and not overly greasy.  The cheese was good and wasn't heavy.  \n\nRoughly $4/slice.

Service is great, I condone all of the people who work there for the late night crowd... that is never easy to deal with. There is almost always a line but it moves really fast. They have a bunch of different flavors so just peak in the window to see what delicious piece you want! \n\nColumbus Cafe next door will usually let you bring your slices in with you as well which is nice. If  you spend more than a few hours drinking there you are most likely going to notice those sweet sweet aromas of golden boy creeping through the front door... you cannot resist. Basically if you are in North Beach, you must go to Golden Boy. No need to wait an hour for a sit-down fancy shmancy pizza when you can get this on the go!", "author": "Mandy A."}

A friend suggested it and convinced me to make the trek to try \"the most amazing pizza\". Obviously, I can't pass up an opportunity to try the most amazing anything, so I decided to give it a try. The line was out the door and decently long, so the first thought that came to mind was \"it must be great. why else would people wait on such a long line\".\n\nAfter a long wait, I was finally able to try \"the most amazing pizza\". I was really hungry so I ended up getting a plain slice and the pesto slice. I started with the plain slice and immediately I knew I had made a mistake. The pizza was incredibly plain and it seemed that Golden Boy had no concept of proper proportions. 90% of the pizza was this greasy, average bread. The rest consisted of a drop of sauce and a layer of hard, flaky cheese. The pesto slice was more or less the same, a greasy unappetizing mess.\n\nThis is easily the worst pizza I have ever paid money to consume. The pizza served in primary school cafeterias is better. Oven pizza you buy at Walgreens is better. Dominoes and Papa Johns are on a completely different level. I would eat this pizza if I needed it to survive, but otherwise... no thank you.

From my understanding, Golden Boy is a prime drunchies spot, but my friend has crowned it her favorite pizza of all time, so we came for a lucid dinner. The store front is next to Chubby Noodle and is quite small.\n\nGolden Boy serves satisfying foccacia bread pizza. It's \"baked-to-order,\" which means they reheat the slices in an oven for a fresh, quick aroma. I got a slice of the garlic and crab ($4) and my friend got her favorite, the combination. The breading is fluffy and soft (\"Just like Pizza Hut!\" in my friends' words. I'm not going to put myself on record that Pizza Hut is quality pizza, but there is admittedly something about that dough...). The garlic can be a bit overwhelming if you had more than one slice, but I thoroughly enjoyed this affordable dinner.

That's something to go out of your way for. \n\nIt's certainly nothing fancy, possibly even a bit grubby, but welcoming nonetheless. The joint has a small capacity and is covered in stickers and scribbles. I've come here a handful of times at night and ordered from the window that displays the tempting sheets of hearty foccacia-like pizza. If you want to sit there and eat, your options are limited to a stool at the bar. The alternatives are noshing curbside or taking it to go. It's an ideal spot for a late night bite to soak up the libations of the evening. \n\nIf you're expecting some cutesy flat bread type of pizza with pretentious toppings, you have come to the wrong place. They serve a range of Sicilian style pies - plain cheese, pepperoni, sausage, vegetarian pesto, clam garlic, and the combo. Always a chewy crust, a generous amount of cheese, tasty sauces, and plentiful toppings. The thickness of the crust makes it really easy to eat without much of a mess or a landslide of cheese. \n\nSide note, if you're going to be kissing anyone, skip the clam garlic. No gum or mint will remedy the dragon breath. I'm dubious that anything but a good swish of listerine will do the trick. \n\nBring cash money, a guilt free attitude, and aim for an extra crispy corner piece!", "author": "Ruby G."}

And a few people told me about how awesome this place is. errrrrr not so much. \n\nI have been enjoying the lovely happy hours at columbus cafe, maggies, and many other awesome North beach locations. A few of my friends and co workers like to stop by and grab some pizza after or even during bar hopping. \n\nThere even tends to be a line. Skip to the pizza! Ive tried the combo, sausage, cheese only and pepporoni!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nITs super crispy and reminds of little ceasars when they use to have those big giant blocks. Kinda taste like it too.

I wouldn't put too much into it though...in terms of quality and freshness, its there, but how it breaks down is as follows....\n\nServed in square pizza slices but like the 5 dollar deal you get at little Caesars...\nRoughly 3-6 dollars per slice if i remember correctly depending on which slice..\n\nThe clam/pesto/veggie in particular lacks the actual clams in portions but you get that aroma you would expect from enjoying clam chowder or mussels from an italian restaurant.. (-1)\n\nCash only...(-1)\n\nGiven how the interior looks a bit gloomy but old fashioned, I'm not sure whether the sodas from their machine being pumped is fresh or not...meh i don't need to feel the tummy any time soon.\n\nIts thicker in slices compared to benchmark/cheeseboard in Berkeley.\nBut lacks the depth in overall flavor and heartiness you can find at places like \nBobby G's, Benchmark or Little star in east bay...\n\nI think Golden Boys pizza is a place to go just out of sentiment than for preference.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-10-06", "description": "Sit at the long metal counter and take your pick of six different kinds of pizza.  It's thick crusty pizza served in large squares, with hot pies coming out of the oven every few minutes or so.  The big metal pans sit in the window and you can take your pick.  You can start with simple cheese and pepperoni for those who demand it or go for some greater culinary variety.  Try the combo with veggies and sausage, or the pesto garlic clam for some stand out flavors.  Now take a bite and savor it - the crust is thick and chewy but the toppings and sauce complement each other nicely.  It's a unique style of pizza, and one that is not often found elsewhere.  They have a bunch of great local beers on tap, so get a pint of that 6% hoppy IPA to complement your delicious pizza.  Be nice, chat with your neighbors and offer a friendly nod to the fast and efficient waitstaff who never fail to attend to your needs. Tip them well because they do their job very efficiently, and because they have to put up with more inebriated and demanding people later in the evening.  Then eat your slices (with a knife and fork) while watching the Giants play on the big screen overheard.  Pay up (in cash only) and head out into a cold North Beach evening.

It's easily the most talked about slice of pie on their menu, but I swear, every time I hit Golden Boy for a quick bite after sashaying through the neon-lit streets of North Beach, they never have it available. Wamp, wamp, wamp. But when the elusive clam pizza goes ghost and your mind is already set on devouring a cheesy piece of Sicilian-style comfort, I always end up setting on the second string, and it's not necessarily the worst thing in the world. \n\nI can't say that if I were stone sober in the middle of the day I'd crave a slice of Golden Boy's goods, but for late night food with a bit of a buzz rattling the dome, it's hard to argue there's any better option in all of San Francisco. Typically, by-the-slice pizza joints around town are utilitarian at best, with little to no thought being put into taste or ingredients. The only goal is to feed the zombie apocalypse of drunken twenty-somethings before complete anarchy ensues, but here, things are different. It's more than a calorically-dense sponge intended to soak up the liters of Fernet flowing through your veins, it's actually a quality bite time after time. For that reason alone, Golden Boy is king. \n\nDo your best to avoid during absolute peak hours, as the line has a tendency to grow 20 deep.

OH DEAR GOD! It was the perfect amount of salty and garlic-y. The sauce was nice and tangy, and they had the perfect amount of too much (I'm the type of person that dips their pizza in a metric shit ton of extra marinara sauce). Totally worth burning off the roof of my mouth.\n\nThe clam pizza was meh to me, but that's because I don't like parsley, and man was there parsley all up in this sucker. the clams defiantly had a nice chewiness, and there was so much garlic Gilroy would be jealous (I love garlic). \n\nOn a scale of 1-10 they get a solid 9 (points taken away for being so goddam hard to get to).\n\nNow excuse me as I sniff my bag because it is super saturated with Golden Boy Pizza smell.", "author": "Maria D."}

It was fresh and hot out of the oven and it was topped with fresh parsley, loaded with garlic and clams. I would not recommend getting this pizza if you have a hot date later in the evening, it is a breath killer, but totally worth it.\n\nFor my 2nd piece I had a slice of the vegetarian pesto pizza. This was also really good, covered in veggies and black olives.\n\nLastly my friend and I split a piece of their cheese pizza. Very simple with just cheese and some seasonings. \n\nI will be coming back to Golden Boy again in the future, probably for my next hangover because the pizza definitely did the trick.", "author": "Stephanie T."}

Pizza in the window all cut into squares. About 6\"x6\" in size. All you have to do is point and say, \"That one!\". The best part about this place is the cost. $3.75 for a combination. CASH ONLY. But don't fret, there are at least four banks near by. Generally at Tony's By The Slice down the street will charge you about $6 per slice. So you pick out your slice and then they stick it in the oven to heat up. The crust has the taste and the texture like focaccia bread. So pretty much you are getting focaccia bread with all the fixins for just $3.75.\n\nThere are seats inside along the bar. Beer and all the other thirst quenching drinks are available. Generally what I do is have the pizza to go, walk down to Caffe Greco, order a Vanilla Latte, sit outside on the parklet, and eat and drink in the sun. A perfect way to relax and enjoy in North Beach.    \n\nSo the pizza ever so yummy and so is the price. Please try. You will not be disappointed.\n \nMangia!!!", "author": "William M."}

At one point we looked up and noticed a line of people standing outside this tiny unassuming building. Coupled with the amazing smell wafting from the door we joined them immediately without knowing what was in store or what we were waiting for. Needless to say, I'm glad we did. \n\nBe advised it's cash only but there's an ATM in the back if you forget. The pizza comes out in sheets, hot out of the oven it's cut into generous squares, and each one is heated for you before being tossed on a wicker plate along with a fork and knife (the only way to eat this pizza). It is my strong belief that the fork and knife method is to keep you from attempting to fit the whole slice in your mouth at once. \n\nThey have plain cheese, pepperoni or sausage, combo, pesto veggie, and clam and garlic. Not a single topping falls flat in my book. The crust is PERFECTION and I am VERY particular about my pizza crust. This is what pizza is supposed to be like!They also serve great beer on tap. \n\nI have tried every slice more than once now and none of them fall short of amazing.

Definitely a hipster/indy feel to with random stickers and writing all over the place (including the bathroom mirrors). \n\nFood: It looked like you can only get what they have out, which isn't necessarily a bad thing since all the pizzas looked great! they're decent-sized square slices of thin crust pizza with awesome combinations of sauce/toppings (the kind I would normally have to special order). It was really solid pizza, but nothing extraordinary or unique in my opinion. They have a pretty good draught beer selection too! Lots of local stuff which is always a plus ($5 for a pint).\n\nService: The cashier/bartender was extremely nice and patient with us when we were deciding. Pizza only took less than 5 minutes.\n\nValue: Eh, I would say it's slightly overpriced for what you get. I get that it's SF, but given their popularity I think they could afford to make it slightly cheaper per slice. Just my opinion though, definitely not crazy overpriced though so don't get me wrong!\n\nOverall: This definitely hit the spot for my pizza craving and I dug the combinations of toppings. The service was great too! I try to save my 5-stars for places that are super unique and knock me down with awesomeness. But this place is pretty good and I would come back again (maybe closer to dinner time so I could try more than one beer).", "author": "Brad M."}

We were half way through the slice when he realized it and we  wanted to just finish the slice. He then told us that everyone at the bar thinks we are rude (ironic since we'd only been there in the front and long enough to just order and get one slice) and told us to get out. As we were leaving, he even encouraged the patrons to mock us as we left, forcing us out in an old-school bullying way.

I was hesitant between the garlic clam pizza and the combo and decided to play safe by getting the combo pizza. The crust is very thick and the toppings are very fresh. Also they have a good selection of beer on tab. Must be a favorite Sunday spot to grab pizza, drink beer, and watch Giants baseball on their flat screen.

I've only been here once, but I'm dying to come back!\nI ordered the combo slice last time which has a combination of meat and veggies, and WHOLE veggies of that. I've never had a slice of pizza that had equal ratio of veggies to meat so it was a nice surprise to not eat fattiness dripped in oil. There's standard cheese, pepperoni and the interesting pesto clam! (which I want to try sooo badly) The best part of this place is that theres a glass window that lets you see the slices of pizza right in front of you. You can definitely see the difference between pipping hot-out-of-the-oven pizza versus stale-been-out-there-forever pizza. The slices are also not triangular shape but nice little squares. This means that you can be lucky and get the crust or some may prefer the gooeyness of the inside slice that falls right off. Anyways, I am totally salivating as I am writing you this because it is THAT good. It is open late, cheap than other gourmet pizza places and quick!!! The only downside is that it's a bit pricier than I normally pay for a slice.

Leo said \"well, at least we know it'll be fresh!\", so we tried to be cheery.  \nThe crowd here was loud, and a few seemed to be drunk... like out of their mind drunk, and this was accompanied with a strong smell of weed, so the 40 minutes wait was really unpleasant. \n\nI was disappointed by the pizza too.  The pizzas are already made, and are reheated in an oven.

They also heat your slice up in the oven. Crispy yumminess!\n\nParking is sometimes hard but if you drive around or park far enough you'll eventually get a spot. You'll need quarters as most of the meters are still the old ones that don't accept credit cards.\n\nThis is a bar.  I've had a beer here before and it's fun with the TV's but I usually prefer to get my pizza to-go.

I ain't tipping you lady! \n\nMy (probably not needed but will say anyway) advice for Golden Boy: \n \n1. Realize that you sell pizza by the slice and that it is okay to sell one slice at a time. \"Rome wasn't built in a day,\" has never rang truer!\n\nI stopped by Golden Boy to grab a slice after a day of touring SF's other culinary treasures because I truly love you. \n\nWhere's that great service I read about in another yelper's review saying they'll even cut your slices into smaller pieces so you can share?!\n\n2.

For me to not remember the name of a restaurant or in this case, a pizza joint, indicates trouble ahead...\n\nMy friend and I came here during a sunny, yet windy day. We really wanted breakfast food but the line at Mama's Restaurant was ridiculously long. I've heard amazing things about this pizza joint so we decided to walk over and grab a slice to eat. I ordered a slice of the veggie pizza with pesto sauce while my friend ordered a slice of the combination. Total cost came out to be about $8. Because the pizza are typically left out at room temperateure in the window display, the worker had to pop our pizza slices into the oven to reheat them. It was the longest five minutes of my life. My mouth salivated as I built up high expectations in my head about how orgasmically-delicious the pizza will taste. Luckily, a SF Giants game on one of their TV screens distracted me from the growling of my stomach.\n\nWhen the pizzas finally came out of the oven, my eyes widened! ...but slowly drooped back down. The cheese wasn't bubbly. It looked rather plain. I took a bite. Hm, it was lukewarm. I added a sprinkling of Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes. Nope, it didn't add any extra pizazz to the pizza.

I enjoyed the restaurant's stool-only slap-dash counter seating; very informal w/a diner-type vibe (half of the 20 or so seats were available during the late lunch period).  The young woman server was comely, personable and efficient.  All good good good.  Not only did the pizza come more or less fresh from the oven, but the ingredients were of high quality, provided a wonderful chewy consistency, and they absolutely do NOT scrimp on either the clams OR garlic (much to the probably dismay of some workmates after I returned).  I had a second piece of a sausage only pizza, and although it was good enough on its own, it simply didn't hold a candle to the G&C slice.  BTW, I'm not sure where else one can purchase slices-only of a garlic & clam pizza so that made GBP extra spectacular.  I had a couple of glasses of their house red which I thought to be a nice accompaniment (but I'll have the ubiquitous beer next time just for the tradition).  While the slice was large enough, I wasn't enamored with the rectangle shape -- obviously they make trays instead of round pans of pizza.  This didn't lend itself as convenient to eat the pizza with my hands (although I did here and there) -- I've had pizza in Naples before, but we're NOT in Italy.  Only because of that and the relative inferiority of the sausage slice compared to the G&C, I demoted a single star to an otherwise exemplary pizza experience but of course I WILL be returning (from here in the FiDi) THIS workweek.

My first slice was the Veggie pizza, and I could remember as a kid biting into it. And immediately my taste buds were overloaded by it. Where to begin!?!\n\nPROS\n+Good Cheese - Follows you. No Pizza hut cheese here.\n+Good Dough-Texture- Every bite, there's a CRUNCH from the dough they use. I've experienced this same kind of crunch but it was with much thinner pizza, and as a trade off it was less filling. But this is just WITCHCRAFT! Crunch in every bite and it's filling. (i think it's from a the second baking the slice gets when you order it)\n+Fresh Ingredients (Fresh veggies on their veggie pizza, they used canned clams for the clam pizza, still amazingly delicious though)\n+A very cool place to eat. The place is essentially a bar. With a plasma hanging near the door showing the latest sports game. There's seating in the back, but up front is mainly bar stools. \n+Bartender does double duty serving pizza. But whoever you get, they are usually super friendly and will strike up a conversation with you.\n\nCons\n???\nidk, maybe they don't have your favorite greek, Hawaiian, etc specialty pizza. They have Cheese, Pepperoni, Sausage, Combo, Veggie, or Garlic Clam. There is a part of their menu that says \"If you don't see it, don't order it.\" which is pretty funny.\n\nI re-discovered this place with some friends last week and i ordered 1 slice of Combo and 1 slice of Clam pizza.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-03-18", "description": "While visiting a cousin in San Francisco, she pointed out Golden Boy Pizza, stating the she heard it's \"the best\" pizza in the North Beach area.  On the hunt for grub after a busy day of solo walking and sightseeing, I popped in to grab a slice.  It's a small place, and apparently often very busy, with a line stretching out the door.  However, my visit was on a Wednesday night around 6 pm, and there were only a few other patrons there at the time.  I sidled up to an empty bar stool, and it was on.\n\nI did not have the famous clam pizza, so I can't attest to it's degree of deliciousness, but if the plain cheese was any indicator of overall quality, I assume it lives up to its reputation.  The bartender will serve up drinks and big, fat squares of Sicilian style pizza, crunchy and doughy at the same time (served with knife and fork, if you're so inclined).  If I ever get back to SF, I'm going to make a point to get back to Golden Boy.", "author": "Christine S."}

It is seriously one of North Beach's highlights. \n\n- Crust is essentially a deliciously tender yet firm Focaccia bread\n- The variety of pizzas here are unique and worth exploring \n- The sausage pizza with red pepper flakes is OFF THE CHARTS! \n- Open into the wee hours of the night (until 2am) for drunken cravings, workaholics, post-dinner snacks, you name it. \n- Yes, there is almost always a line but I'm always impressed by the efficiency and friendliness of the staff \n- Giant square slices - you need only 1 on a normal day and maybe 2 on a gluttonous day\n\nThe reason I knocked off a star is because sometimes, when the pizza has been made an hour or so ago, the pizza slice is reheated for you. And it really doesn't taste as good as it does when it's freshly baked. \n\nBut nonetheless, give this place a try and I guarantee your taste buds will love you and your abs will hate you.", "author": "Priya S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-07-13", "description": "Sensational slices of Sicilian pizza here. I was hyptonized first by the fact that Golden Boy has a window display of piping hot pizzas from their deck ovens. Walking past the narrow bar stool alley and situating myself in the rear while I waited for my friends, I was further hypnotized by the two chefs in the back going through the tedious routine of preparing dough, rotating pizzas currently in the oven, and slicing up finished pizzas. \n\nThe dough preparation had a beautiful cadence to it, and a good sign that this is pizza worth a damn. When not preparing dough, the preparers would use nothing but a chef's knife and a towel to rotate the scorching hot pizza pan without so much of a though at burning their hands. Given my fear of burning myself in a toaster oven, I would fail miserably at this feat. \n\nAt last, my party joined me and we prepared to indulge in some slices. After watching the preparers for the good part of 10 minutes like some starving creep, I proceeded to order 4 slices, doubling up on the works and rounding out my order with a pepperoni and a pesto slice. Why only 4? I had eaten dinner only two hours prior, and despite declaring myself as \"stuffed,\" one snack during into a second dinner. \n\nWell, screw any remorse, because after my server provided me with four fresh slices of pizza and I took my first bite, holy hell was I in heaven. First of all, the Sicilian is just the perfect canvas for some quality low-moisture mozzarella, and Golden Boy matches that perfectly. The cheese marries the golden, crispy and doughy crust and sends you into pizza bliss, with each bite taking you closer to a culinary climax leaving you wanting more. \n\nThe pepperoni was exceptional, with the perfect amount of sliced, rounded meat in every bite. The works was phenomenal too, just bursting with flavor without stealing the show from the marvelous cheese or crust. As for the pesto, I expected a little more basil flavor, but still enjoyed it enough to dream of my return to Golden Boy. Next time, I'm ordering a full pan and will eat it all.", "author": "Amir H."}

Clam and garlic pizza, is there anything else to say?! \n\nWhere in the city can you get this in SQUARE form and on focaccia?! Nowhere (that I know of)!!!\n\nMy sister said she got two slices the last time she came here, so I happily ordered two slices for myself. She failed to mention that she only finished one and took the second slice to go! They are pretty large slices and they are hearty so it filled me up easily. \n\nThe clam and garlic pizza was SO delicious. I mean you have to be a fan of clams and garlic or it'll be completely disgusting, but it wasn't to me! It was incredibly delicious. \n\nWe got the sausage, pepperoni and combo slices as well. The Combo is totally worth it. They toss everything on there. The pepperoni and sausage were pretty laughable, only because the number of pepperoni on her \"pepperoni\" slice was 4 and her sausage slice also had four sausages as well. Why so skimpy on the meat but yet the combo is FILLED completely with toppings? So weird. \n\nOtherwise, the parking sucks here... it's North Beach/borderline Chinatown so what do you really expect?

I don't think the idea of clams on a pizza sound appealing to most of the people I've raved about the pizza slice from heaven about. But trust me!!! It's amazing....so amazing I want some more, just thinking about it makes my mouth water. I am soooo sad that I can't have it any time soon since I don't live in SF.

After hitting the bars in North Beach my friends and I would wonder over for a thick, yummy slice and recount the evenings antics.\n\nLast Saturday night I convinced my boyfriend (who already despises North Beach anyways) to go for Golden Boy Pizza before going home.  I was nostalgic.  We'd been out late at 83 Proof (Best Bar Ever, btw), and nothing was open in the area.\n\nGolden Boy, we even took a TAXI to come see you.\n\nWe waited in line, patiently.\n\nThen we saw your employees nearly assault a customer.  He was behind us, in line, when the woman who was working slammed the door, shutting us all out.  We didn't know why she had closed the door, or if she intended on doing window service (she had not opened the window at that point.)  The guy behind us asked if we knew what the deal was, and when we didn't, he stuck his head in the door (as another customer was leaving) to ask.  We heard her yell at him and slam the door, on his FINGERS.  He yelled and flailed, and they told him to get lost.  He walked away (after yelling and cursing at them, as anyone would do, right?)\n\nIncredible.  But wait...there is more.\n\nWe continued to wait for pizza, and when we got to the window, a very drunk, very sloppy woman pushed passed us to get to the window.  We told her that she couldn't cut, the EMPLOYEES of Golden Boy gestured her over to the door, opened it, and let her in!  I guess it's ok for them to treat anyone else with contempt, but their drunk, rude friend was allowed inside.\n\nBut still, I waited.  When I got to the front of the line, I tried to explain what had happened to the guy who got his fingers smashed.  They totally dismissed me, saying that he was \"out of control.\"\n\nSo this is what I learned, Golden Boy.  Your employees are jerks.

Though I didn't really taste the garlic nor the clams.  The pesto veggie was far too cheesy.  So much so, the cheese overwhelmed the taste of the pesto sauce.\n\nI prefer pizza with more flavorful sauce & less cheese!\n\nThere is a good selection of draft beer. \n\nThey do not accpet credit cards, so bring cash.\n\nSo if you like cheesy pizza, with limited size selection, loud rock music, & sitting on bar stools...this is the place for you.", "author": "Saul M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-06", "description": "Stumbled upon Golden Boy pizza while taking a friend on a tour of SF based off the recommendation of a sweet lady at the flower shop. Golden Boy pizza is pretty unremarkable on the outside, just a small red tent that says Golden Boy pizza. As you get closer, you know it's different from the rest, though. The pizza at the window is still fresh, the cheese still melting off it. Rock music blasts throughout the small bar-esque seating area, a myriad of stickers and signatures of patrons past adorn the walls, the oven's heat makes the environment warm but not to the point of being uncomfortable. \n\nThe process at the cashier is simple: order your pizza, either by the slice or by the sheet (it's square pizzas here, kids). Slices range from 3-5 per and sheets, if I remember correctly, were 48 per. Pricy, in my opinion, but the slices are worth it. I had a Clam and Garlic slice and a Combo slice. At first, I was worried since it seemed like the Clam and Garlic was pretty unpopular - the sheet was still completely full save for one slice. The Combo, on the other hand, was already ravaged through halfway. Oh yes, another note: this place is Cash Only, no cards. Not sure if there's an ATM around. \n\nAnyways, seating is simple. Swiveling bar stools line the walls and you simply choose your seat. Kinda hard to mess up. Seating is definitely limited, so during rush hour I'd imagine it to be very difficult to get a seat inside. On to the pizza. \n\nClam and Garlic had what I think was the Garlic adorned all over it. It had this beautiful green look to it. The garlic taste was surprisingly rather subtle for a pizza with garlic as a star in the dish. Clams, as you can imagine, were equally subtle since no pizza store can afford to throw on tons of clams onto a pizza. So, I felt like I was kinda just eating a regular cheese pizza with little bits of clams and garlic. But, the real star of the whole slice was the dough. This goes for the Combo pizza as well. The dough has all the features of a thin pizza crust: light, airy, crisp, yet it's a thick crust. It was amazing. The magic of the dough might have something to do with the fact that it's made in house. \nCombo pizza was great, it had onions, tomato, sausage and a few  other toppings I can't remember. The sausage had a great bite to it, definitely not your regular pizza hut sausage. Tomatoes and onions were nice and refreshing as well. I didn't add any red pepper or parmesan cheese since it just didn't seem appropriate to adulterate a pizza slice so good. \n\nAll in all, four out of five stars. The pizza is in a class of it's own here, skip all those other pizza by the slice places. Clams and garlic could've stood out a bit more, so minus the one star. Really more like half star though, but no option for that. Its grungy, yet entirely at ease atmosphere makes for easy conversation and the pizza is outstanding. It's a great second date place where the conversations can flow freely and the meal is still wholly satisfying. Or, maybe even a first date place if you really want to come out of left field and leave an impression.", "author": "Eric T."}

Though I'm convinced you can't really beat  a quick NY slice with any slice on this left coast, I am beginning to appreciate the different styles and interpretations of pizza out here.  Golden Boy specializes in the doughy, almost focaccia-like, Sicilian-style slices.  There is no formal crust, but definitely ask for a corner edge since the texture contrast is way better than a floppy middle slice.\n\nCheese: Crispy edges with a slight butteryness where it had touched the pan.  Thick, bready dough.  A light smear of tomato sauce and tons of gooey cheese.  Light compared to the other slices and a great example of Sicilian-style pizza without the noise of toppings.\n\nClam & Garlic: Let me just disclose that I love clam & garlic pizza.  So this was a predestined win in my book, but proved even better because there was tomato sauce!  Perfect combo, don't know why most clam & garlic pizzas don't do this.  The parsley was a little bit overwhelming though, they should moderate a bit.\n\nVegetarian Pesto: Probably my least favorite slice.  The pesto is subtle so the thin smear gets lost amongst all the bread, cheese and toppings.  The veggies consisted of mushrooms, black olive slices (presumably from a can) and a lone zucchini slice.  None of them really had much personality making a pretty bland experience.", "author": "Adam B."}

I've tried Patxi's (gave it 3 stars) and next on my list is Little Star, but so far Golden Boy is my favorite. Golden boy only serves the napoleon style (box shaped) pizza, they do 4-5 different topping combinations and are cash only. You'll notice a long line coming out of their small restaurant but that's partly because they put their cash register at the front of the restaurant which automatically generates a long line outside. So don't let the long line deter you. \n\nI love the casual/fun environment of the place, their service and of course their pizza. I've tried the supreme (I think they call it the combo pizza), cheese, pesto, vegentarian, and their garlic/clam. My favorite by far was the garlic/clam pizza. I'd recommend that to people even if they don't like seafood cause I didn't think it tasted too seafood-y. The service is great here too. The gal at the register is a machine. She asks very succinct questions when you reach the front so there's no dilly dallying which got us through the line quickly. \n\nAs I was finished my first round of pizza's, I was thinking to myself, I'd love 2 more slices but I don't want to get back on that line. The other gal working there must've telepathically heard me and asked me what I wanted!

Throw some parmesan, chili flakes and oregano, and you are about to get down to business!\n\nThe prices are between $3-4 per slice, which I think is pretty fair.

As far as the Pesto Veggie and Garlic Clam, we were served a piece from the pie that was sitting in front of the window. The gentlemen helping us put those into the oven to heat them up. We sit down and have our fresh Combo slice. It was good, but I didn't think it even compared to Round Table's Combo.\n\nFinally, the two that I really wanted to try came out and we dove into those. Disappointment. Both were dry and tasted bland. Maybe because they were reheated, the sauce dried up? I don't know, but I got cotton mouth with each bite.

The counter person was cheerful and efficient, but not in any hurry. \"Hey, there's a huge line of people standing out on the sidewalk, let's get in line and see what the wait is for.\".", "author": "Steve R."}

It was easier to grab and in a lesser portion size - perfect for me since I wanted to try a little bit of everything!\n\nThe dough is soft and fluffy, with just the right amount of sauce and cheese.  I hate it when pizzas don't have a good ratio between the sauce and cheese.  My favorite was the combo.  It looked a little weird to me that this was a combo since it looked more like a veggie, but with small pieces of sausages.  I would say it's one of the better combos I've had so far.  It came with onions, zucchini, tomato slices and few pieces of sausages on each slice, making it a lighter slice of pizza rather than the overpowering on numerous of toppings on other combo pizzas.  \n\nMy slices were a bit cold when I got to eat them, but it was still very good.

He would introduce me to his favorite meal at the place he deems makes it the best and I would take him to my spot for dinner.  It was President's Day weekend and what better way to absorb the beautiful weather and long weekend than with good food, and a walk on the Golden Gate Bridge to burn it off.  \n\nI had been hearing him talk about Golden Boy Pizza almost to the point where he was beginning to sound stubborn.  Hahaha.  No other pizza could match up, in his opinion.  I never heard anyone talk about pizza the way he did and even dismiss other beloved pizzas joints here in the Bay.  I thought, geez this pizza better take me over the moon and back.  So he is super excited as we're walking towards GBP and it's nice to see that someone other than myself can get so giddy over something like food.  \n\nUpon entering the place is small and there are a handful of people in front of us.  The menu is pretty small as well with only several options:  Cheese, Pepperoni, Veggie, Combination, and Clam and Garlic.  No slice over $4.  Oh, and its all square slices which I never had before.  The pizzas were already made and waiting for you in the window.  You choose what you want and they reheat it for you and bring it to your seat.  If you're not too hungry, one slice will do ya.  But, if hungry, two slices would be perfect.  I chose (2) Clam and Garlic since I gave a few things up for Lent.  After Lent, I'll come back for the others.  \n\nIt took a while for me to get used to the seats and the counter space as it didn't leave much room to maneuver around.  Seats are not movable so I can only imagine someone much bigger than me trying to sit on there.  Anyways, that's beside the point.  Its a no frills place and you definitely aren't coming here for the ambiance.  Our slices made its way to us and yes, I had tasted pizza heaven.  They use focaccia bread and that makes a huge difference.  I was worried the clam and garlic (2x) would make me a vampire's nightmare, but not so.  I thought it would be overwhelming to eat, but it wasn't.  The crust was great, the garlic was diced up finely enough that you didn't feel as if you were swallowing whole pieces.  Every bite tasted great and I can see why a lot of people, especially my friend, loves it here.  The Clam and Garlic was a great choice and very delicious.  The crust helps to make the pizza and the ratio of crust to toppings are perfect.  I enjoyed so much I actually told my friend that we have to go back again soon.  I'm already looking up reasons why we need another cheat day.", "author": "Heizel M."}

You walk in, you order your pizza and drink and you take a seat on one of their comfortable thick-cushioned bar stools.

The crust is very similar to focaccia, but not quite as oily.  The bread is firm and soft, and the bottoms are usually crispy.  They use a tangy tomato sauce here that actually stands out.  I've noticed that the amount of cheese varies depending on the topping.

The guy was some kind of twisted genius.  His short story \"The Golden Man\" (which was turned into an entertaining although entirely unfaithful movie staring Nick Cage) about a semi-retarded but physically adept mutant who can see about 30 seconds into the future was always one of my favorites.  Every time I think of Golden Boy Pizza I think of The Golden Man and his shimmering coat of thin gold fur, and amazing prescient ability to avoid capture, by about 30 seconds.  But I digress.\n\nThe first time I ever came to San Francisco was Spring Break, 1987.  I came with a bunch of friends, and one of our \"grown up\" friends back home told my buddy Matt (still my BFF to this day) and me to check out the pie at Tomaso's.  Sadly, when we got there and looked at the menu we realized that she had been woefully deluded about the budgetary means of college students.  $20 for a pizza?  In 1987?  When I didn't really even have a job?  You've got to be fucking kidding me.  \n\nSo Matt and I kept walking - having walked all day long.  We were hungry.  We were tired.  We were frustrated and discouraged by the mere concept of a $20 pizza.  We wandered up Grant street, took a random left down Green, and suddenly saw Golden Boy pizza by the slice!  Yesssss!\n\nNow, back in Madison at that time there was a local chain (it's probably still there) called Rocky Rococo's.  They sold pseudo-Chicago-style deep dish slices, cut square.  Their table top Galaga machine ate thousands of my quarters when I was in high school.  I was a Galaga addict, and a Galaga demi-god as far as that goes.  Another amusing thing was that the fancy label on the bin where the sausage and mushroom slices came up said \"S&M.\"  We always got a laugh out of that - every time.  I am easily amused. But I digress.\n\nWhen Matt and I, back in spring of 1987, randomly stumbled into Golden Boy and saw their lovely deep-dish square-cut pepperoni slices for I suspect about $1.50 a slice back then, we were in affordable comfort food heaven.  \n\n21 years later, 19 of which I've lived in San Francisco, I still love Golden Boy for a quick lunch slice, a post-North-Beach-boozing slice, or just generally, a slice.  Or two.  It's good pie, it's affordable pie, it's a cool joint that has hardly changed in any way in the last 20 years, and god damn it, I love that.

This pizza is good and the staff is so friendly.  We came here one night when we couldn't get in to Tony's Neopolitana (around the corner).  We got a couple slices fo cheese and a sausauge and we were able to get a couple counter seats (that's all they have).  It's small in there but the music is great (ex: punk, rock but not the annoying/aggressive) and it's great pizza.  The dough is thick and cooked well and tastes great, it really picks up the seasonings they use (standard salt/olive oil, garlic, oregano, basil).  It's more along the lines of a thick crust pizza, great tasting cheese and the sauce is not overwhelming, it's just a great slice.  Enjoy!", "author": "J P."}

Yeah that's right - sQUARE.\n\nThis little place is a great stop in North Beach for a fast slice of pizza - you basically stand in the doorway and choose a piece, they put it in the oven for a minute or two, and you get a big cheesy square of goodness!  The regular cheese slice was okay, but I especially recommend the Italian sausage.  I personally like the slices with crust - since the tray is rectangular there are a bunch of \"middle\" pieces with no edges.  But that's just me - my boyfriend prefers the crustless pieces because of the larger ratio of cheese and greasiness.  Definitely a must-try.", "author": "Laura W."}

The crust on Goldenboy's pizza is exceptional, and all the ingredients tasted fresh. I really enjoyed my visit and would go back again!\n\nI do have specific reasons though for giving Golden Boy \"4 stars\" rather than \"5 stars.\" First, the pizza was good--better than your average pizza place---but it wasn't near the best I've had. I live on the East coast now (and maybe I'm spoiled by the pizza there) but this just isn't 5 stars for me. And for 3.75 a slice, I'd argue it's a little pricey for what it is. If I include Golden Boy in a comparison of all the different types of pizza in SF, I'd prefer to go to Zachary's or Blondie's instead.\n\nMy second caveat with Golden Boy is that this is a definitive late night, college co-ed pizza joint with little to no seating and a hipster vibe. That means Golden Boy serves a specific demographic, and there's a specific experience of the restaurant. As a UC Santa Cruz graduate, Golden Boy felt homey and bohemian in all the right ways.

Maybe they will open another one in a more out of the way spot :)?\n\nContrary to all the stuff here about lines out of the door, I've usually managed to come here on lazy afternoons with some friend visiting the city. After a couple of hours stomping around the city, its great just to kick back with something warm and slippery sliding over the back of the tongue. You just sit there, sun streaming in the open door in this little sun trap, drinking great SF beer, eating this lovely pizza and watching life go by. Really, as life moments go, these times have been fantastic.\n\nI havent been in a while, but when I started going, the price was about $2 - now I read its closer to $4. Sad, but understandable.\n\nMy recommendation is to head there in the afternoon, in the sunshine, although last time I went they didnt have the clam and garlic in the afternoon - and yes, this is my favorite all-time pizza ever. Yes, its oily. How do you think you get a fried-crisp bottom you hear a glassy crunch through as you bite?  Take some time, you and a buddy, when the place is half-empty and chilled out. Watch the motes flit in the sunbeams. Remember you are in North Beach, and that maybe some famous writers munched here. Then forget it as the huge gob of half-masticated parsley, cheese, clams and loads of garlic slides into your throat and oblivion.\n\nIf you go at rush time, you're just getting the pizza - stlll good, but you're missing out on the existential experience.\n\nNot for yuppies, preppies, or other people who insist on clean floors, walls and toilets, foot-long pepper grinders in their face, and constant enquiries as to whether you're enjoying your food by underpaid waiters.", "author": "Sard O."}

It's not so heavy that you need to be in the mood to handle it (a la Chicago Style) and the dough is not too crunchy/thin that the pizza loses most of the doughiness (Neapolitan/NY). It's got a nice buttery crunch that gives way to a soft chewy dough.\n\nGolden Boy does this style very well. They focus on the strengths in its dough and they don't overpower it with too much sauce or overload it with cheese. It's very balanced. We had three slices: Clam Garlic, Pepperoni, and Pesto Vegetarian.\n\nPepperoni - Can't go wrong. It was my favorite, simple and cheesy; exactly what you want from a slice of Sicilian pepperoni.\n\nClam Garlic - I had never had this combination of toppings before and I was very pleasantly surprised. The garlic really jumps out at you. My only complaint was towards the end of the slice the parsley was a bit overpowering.\n\nPesto Vegetarian - As fresh and light as this particular brand of pizza could be the pesto really was a nice change of pace from the other two types. Liked the combination of toppings.\n\nI think Sicilian pizza does not get enough play when it comes to delicious pies but if you head to Golden Boy I'm pretty sure you'll be a believer.\n\nCheers!", "author": "Andrew B."}

Sicilian is my favorite and Garlic Clams is a close second (although its a bit too salty in my opinion).\n\nPizza is pizza, but it takes a really good pizza place to put it over the marks  of average and that is exactly what Golden Boy does. \n\nThe only negative about this place is the wait (took about 30 minutes) just for a slice of pizza and parking is pretty difficult, especially on a weekend. But if you are around and have time to kill, have a slice over at Golden Boy's.", "author": "David W."}

Last year we wanted to save some fundage on our trip and looked for lesser-priced alternatives when eating out. We fell in LOVE with Golden Boy Pizza. It reminded me of days when I visited Queens, NY and my friends and I would hit the all-night pizza joints for a slice or two of awesome pizza. The place is small, so don't expect to bring in a party of 8 and get a table. At the most you'll stretch out across a small bar facing a wall, but that wall is fabulous with its vast sticker collection ranging from Kurt Cobain's mug to Beatles lyrics. \n The day we went a young woman was the barmaid/waitress/pizza guru and she was perfect. Took our order (2 combos, one with 2 slices of pepperoni and the other with 1 clam/garlic one cheese). She made sure everyone in the joint was comfortable, had drinks in front of them and even talked sports with the locals. \n The pizza was amazing! The garlic clam pizza has left me dreaming of my return this July. I cannot recommend it enough. GET.IT.\n Do yourselves a favor and try it out.

Unfortunately, I don't live right in the city and can only come occasionally, but it's worth traveling for. It's a small, unpretentious place that always seems to have a line. Among other things, this means the pizza is always fresh from the oven. One of the main problems with average pizzerias is that you get stale slices that have been sitting around for a while. That never happens here. I generally prefer plain cheese, but they have a variety of other kinds as well, such as pesto, vegetable and various meat toppings. The only bad thing I can say about a place like this is that it makes ordinary pizza, which you get in most places around the country, harder to tolerate.

The prices are fine...but SF is strange about their acceptance of Credit Cards.  \n\nWe sat at the counter and ordered from there.  Slices ranged from $3.25 - $3.75 depending on which slice you get.  I had a slice of Supreme and Pepperoni and it was plenty filling.  There were about 6 beers on draft and they were reasonably priced at about $4.00 / pint.  The slices are light on sauce...so maybe that's just a personal preference...but they were more so average as opposed to the 4 stars this place is receiving.\n\nThey had 1 employee attempting to serve about 30 people and put slices in the oven at the same time.  Ultimately...I think you'd be better off being drunk eating here after the bars and not going there sober.", "author": "Chris R."}

The pizza is delicious and served up hot, a treat! \n\nI went to Golden Boy this past Tuesday with a friend and while the place is a dive it is really a great place to get good pizza. \n\nIt is NOT a tourist place. It is a place for locals. The place is clean and well kept. And it is good to be around everyday people. The rock music is good. But sometimes the staff can play it a bit too loud. \n\nOr maybe, that's just me as I am getting older. Still I think the place is fun and service is friendly. Prices are a bargain. \n\nOn this visit I had the pesto vegetarian. I was surprised because I expected the pesto to be really overpowering. But it for me it was subtle with a nice balance of flavor. \n\nI also had an Italian lemonade soda. It is very satisfying, not too sweet. And, with a fresh hot pizza it is a real treat. For the two of us, we had a large square slice of pizza and a lemonade soda. Total cost $10.00 even. That's a real bargain! \n\nOh and guess who I spotted as I was leaving Golden Boy! \n\nThe veteran local journalist Warren Hinckle was leaving the pub next door to Golden Boy and was and about to step into a taxi. \n\nFor those of you who do not know who Warren Hinckle is, he has been an established journalist who used to write for the SF Independent and other papers for years. \n\nI almost did not recognize him. He was wearing shorts and green knee high socks. If it was not for his trademark eye patch and faithful dog, I would have missed him. I approached him respectfully and introduced myself. \n\nAge has slowed him down. But with those knee high green socks I guess he is still the outgoing and fun raising character. \n\nIncidentally, at one of the places near Golden Boy Pizza, the legendary Carol Doda sings and entertains. \n\nPerhaps, next time I visit Golden Boy who knows, maybe I will run into Carol Doda or some other colorful character that makes San Francisco a fun and fascinating city.", "author": "Jonathan F."}

They have 6 options: cheese, pepperoni, clam, pesto vegetarian, vegetables and sausage. And it's cheap. Period. \n\nAfter yoga and some grocery shopping this evening, the thought of cooking dinner was unbearable. I walk past Golden Boy and think \"Why not? Cheap and easy\". I walk in. The place, like many reviewers already mentioned, is a hole in the wall. I remember eating in just once, when I had just moved to SF, and never again feeling tempted to repeat it. I was reminded today the reason why - the service just sucks! That just kills it for me!\n\nI order my pizza, the guy barely acknowledges me, as he is in a conversation with another customer about why his alter-ego is 'mayor Giuliani\". He warms up my pizza, asks me if it's 'to go', then when he takes it out of the oven, he asks me if I want him to wrap it up. What I am supposed to say?!?!?! It's TO GO!!! OF COURSE!!! Argh!!! \n\nI wrap it up, regretting stopping by to buy it, and having a total deja-vu - service ALWAYS sucked when I went there before and that's why I never came back!

You're out late after a night of drinks and taxiing around from Rick House to Tunnle Top to Ambassador and then back to North Beach. It's late and you just want to get home, but suddenly your mesmerized by the glow of the giant finger pointing down to your new destination.  All you can think of is a perfect square of soft thick cheesy pizza goodness.  No crust, you love crust, but tonite you don't give a crap about it.  All you want is that slice of goodness.  You pay the taxi driver and walk towards your dream Pizza.  You suddenly realize that you're way to tired to wait in the long line so you just keep walking to North Beach pizza and buy an almost equally satisfying slice.  \nNext time Golden Boy, Next time....", "author": "Robert S."}

The sausage was also good.

I just walked in and took a few slices to go for lunch since parking is somewhat an adventure around here.  I walked in and there was a mom and her kids in front of us and there were a couple of guys inside eating.  The place is kind of a hole in the wall.  One of the creepshows sitting in the bar told the mom she needed to come back at 1am, when the line is out the door.  They needed to kick this guy out cuz really, his attempt at marketing for them failed miserably.  Why would someone want to wait in a longer line that is full of creepshows like him for this?  \n\nThe pizza itself was actually decent, though I like mine a bit more crispy.  It is Sicilian style, so crispy it is not.  It is actually more like focaccia.  Since I ordered quite a few slices, they gave me a large box for them.  The slices are about 7\" squares.  When asked how many I got for myself, I said 4.  Apparently this is another example of me eating way more than normal humans, as anytime anyone asked about where I had eaten, they looked at me in a mixture of disgust and amazement when the 4 slices at one sitting was mentioned.", "author": "Jason P."}

I'm very grateful our friend Cameron has a car and drove us all because in my experience North Beach isn't so easy to reach via public trans. \n\nANYWAYS, parking on such a nice day was rather hard to find so we did have to do some walking, which was fine. When we finally got to GB's the place was damn near empty! -- Usually not a great sign but they're known for their night crowd anyways, or so Cameron told me. But hey, not having to wait was okay in my book. I ordered a slice of the combination pie, with sausage, zucchini, tomatoes, and some other goodies I'm forgetting to mention, with a root beer. The boyfriend, Cameron, and our other friend Wyatt ordered slices of pepperoni, with sodas and beer. Not much talking occurred after we took our first bites because we were all too busy chowing down! Fresh tasting and hot with reeeeeally great toppings on an easy to enjoy, well-put-together piece of pizza! It wasn't falling apart or anything! The crust was just perfect and being that all the slices are square shaped I was fortunate enough to get the divine corner piece .. I am actually salivating at the thought of that slice. We all had only one slice each but afterwards we were regretting not getting two each, though one was plenty since our eyes always seem bigger than our stomachs, amirite?\n\nThe total for ALL of our pizzas and drinks came out to just a little over $16 (not including tip)! The guy working behind the counter actually didn't charge us for the boyfriend's beer, which we aren't really sure if that was on purpose or not, so we tipped pretty generously anyway. \n\nThe atmosphere of the place is kind of grungy but it really isn't at all, though the place itself is very narrow shaped so can feel a little cramped. The wall is covered in stickers and other cool things to read and look at!\n\nI'll be sure to return some day to try one of their more creative pies once I figure out how to get there on my own.

I guess with an abundance of glowing signs in the neighborhood, it's hard to stand out.  For some reason I always remember Amante's though.  I think it has to do more with me knowing someone with that last name.\n\nAfter a night of a few drinks, my friend suggests Golden Boy Pizza.   Of course I said yes since I love pizza and I was drinking.  I was used to going to North Beach Pizza in the area so I was happy to try something new.  Most of the time I don't find much difference between pizzas but since there was a good line there,I figured I'd try it out.\n\nWow.  This is pretty good pizza.  Cool J doesn't really have discriminating taste but I thought this pizza was delicious.  I think I got the pepperoni slice but there was something special about that pizza.  It was nice and crispy and the crust was awesome.  I immediately wanted another one but decided against it since I am a fat ass enough.  \n\nThis is a really popular spot since it's close to a lot of bars and lounges.  Expect to wait in line on a weekend and even on a weekday.  I think they close a little later during the weekend so if you feel like a slice at 1am in the morning,they'll be open.  There's a small area for in-restaurant eating.  Plenty of people like myself have eaten right outside the establishment.  Damn I could go for another.\n\nParking here is always crappy, especially during the weekend.  You'll find something most likely on the weekday during the day.  The prices are a lil higher than most pizza slice spots but what you do expect?  You're in North Beach.\n\nOverall, check it out. I like it  a lot.", "author": "Jason Y."}

It's not unusual, but it's more like a concept maximizing surface space to eat. Late business hours makes this place the best hang out spot after a long night drinking or dancing.\n\nCheap prices, friendly customer service, and tasty selections always win repeat customers whether you dine-in or take-out. A group of us strolled up to Golden Boy Pizza after having a few drinks at La Trappe and the line was pretty short at 12:15am. By 12:30am, the line was 20 people deep but it flowed fast. At first, I didn't want any pizza, but by the time I stood in the doorway, I smelled the pizza fragrance blowing from the heavy duty fan above and couldn't resist. My friend ordered four slices of combo and he topped it off with oregano and chili. I grabbed the massive slice and was able to control it by positioning every fingertip on each of the four corners. Cheese was oozing off, toppings were huge, and flavor hit the spot.\n\nPOW! Off the hook! \n\nThis has got to be a marvel of the world. With each bite, more cheese oozed off, and I kept trying to balance the tomatoes and sausages from falling off the top. Generous topping of zucchini, pepperoni, mushrooms, and sausage were infused in the mozzarella. I had to pick out most onions, but ate some by accident. Advice: You really just can't use one napkin and you need a drink or soda to wash everything down.\n\nI was definitely satisfied. If I didn't have as much beer and alcohol in my body as I did; I would've inhaled another piece. I bet these slices taste good even for breakfast the next morning too!  Overall, I think they priced these heavenly slices below what they're really worth. At $3.75 a slice of combo, this was a steal in San Francisco.

We saw them assault one of the customers! Read on for the details...\n\nWe got to Golden Boy somewhat late (around 1:20 a.m.), so there was quite a line. My girlfriend assured me that the line would move quickly, so we decided to stay. After waiting for 15 - 20 minutes, we were almost at the front of the line when an employee suddenly shut the door and put cardboard over the window of the door. No explanation, nothing. I figured they might be switching over to window service, but I really wasn't sure. The guy behind us was a little confused, so he tried to pop his head in and ask as a customer was exiting. The employees yelled at him, and one of the female employees slammed the door shut *on his fingers*. When he tried to tell them what they had done, one of the other employees rudely pointed for him to leave. Talk about adding insult to injury!\n\nI understand that they have to deal with a bunch of drunken idiots every night, but this guy was being respectful. We had been talking to him earlier in line, and he certainly was not one of the many obnoxious drunks we experienced while waiting. But regardless of the situation, it is NEVER ok to assault someone (yes, that is assault, my friends). I didn't get a chance to talk to him after that (he was so angry, he stormed off), so I have no idea if they broke one of his fingers or not. If they did, I hope he sues their asses.\n\nWhen it was finally our turn in line, my girlfriend tried to talk to the employees to tell them that they had really injured the guy. They couldn't have cared less and started arguing with her. At that point, we simply left and vowed never to return. I cannot and will not support a business that treats people so poorly.

I'd been out with some friends at House of Shields, when we decided to embark on a journey to find some delicious and relatively cheap food. Golden Boy was a total win. We took a walk -- It was only a mile but I do not recommend doing it in high-heeled boots -- and were there in minutes. The line formed out the door, but we were able to split up so a few of us could grab seats for everyone while the rest waited to order. For five people, we ended up getting a cheese Sicilian sheet pizza and a pitcher of beer. Per person I don't remember exactly how much it rang to but I remember thinking, \"Wow, that's awesome.\" Crunchy crust, chewy melted cheese, and spices such as basil and oregano, along with a tangy sauce, made this pizza stick in my mind as one I'll revisit again, for sure.

The crust is crunchy, the toppings are tasty and fresh, and I like the square shape. My favorite is the Clam and Garlic. It is soooooooo good. Never had Clam and Garlic pizza anywhere else. Whenever I get the chance, I come here for it. I also really like their combo pizza, they put zucchini on it which I love! They put on just enough sauce rather than slathering it like some places do, so you can still taste all the toppings. Their prices are pretty reasonable too. The inside is fairly small so its def more of a take out place. The only downside in my opinion is that even late at night there is often a huge line. Takes a while to move through it too but to me the wait is worth it. Just don't expect to stop by to quickly grab a slice because there is nearly always a wait.

Indeed, the crust is crunchy, yet thick enough to hold the generous toppings.  One thing that was a initially bit off-putting (at least visually) were these crunchy flower-like things that were all over my pizza slice . . . \n\nAfter my first bite, I realized that they were simply sprigs of curly parsley.  Curly parsley?  Usually, aside from being the de riguer garnish next to your burger and fries at your local diner, you don't see too much of it.  Definitely not within the food itself.  As for its taste, I remember having chewing on springs of curly parsley on one or two occasions after being told its wondrous breath cleansing properties.  Bleeech, I remember my then-teenage palette reacting . . . \n\nIn any case, to this day, I wouldn't eat it on purpose . . . but now that it was baked into my pizza, I was sorta forced to do so (I'm not a fan of people who pick at food, so I would never do that myself).  And the verdict?  \n\nSurprisingly delicious.\n\nNow, yes, the parsley was on the darker side of well-done (having been popped into an oven for a couple minutes before being served) , but tasting it did add a bit of . . . something (I was going to sound counterpoint, but we're talking about pizza here and . . . well . . . I couldn't think of a less pretentious sounding alternative) that balances out the overpowering garlic slices (lovely) and clams.  With limited char on the actual pizza crust itself, the bolus that I ended up with in my mouth (yeah, I know, such a sexy and not-at-all-disgusting term) brought up pleasant memories of eating great wood-fire oven pizzas.  Without a hit to the the pocketbook.  Or the fifteeen-minute wait.\n\nThey seemed to have a lovely selection of beers on tap -- but after a night of partying for New Year's Eve, I wasn't too eager to drink, just yet . . . \n\nGreat pizza, though.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-09-28", "description": "After reading all the great yelp review, I made Golden Boy my last stop for this SF visit. After going up and down slopes & circling around for a good 10 minutes, I  finally found parking & got to the restaurant by 10:30pm. \n\nI wasn't really hungry, but wanted to give this place a shot and see if they were all that amazing. As I pedaled to the store, the front glass window had a very tempting display of all the Sicilian style pan pizza. To my surprise, I had this sudden  urge of hunger/cravings. I guess visual displays does work its own charm\n\nI quickly placed my order on the garlic clam as I only saw 3 slices left. This was the highly reviewed/raved  topping and I would've been totally bummed if I wasn't able to give this a try. Although the garlic clam was the only one I had in mind, I couldn't resist ordering another slice of the combination. The friendly waitress scooped up the two slice and tossed it back to the oven for a quick bake for crispness. \n\nThe pizza came out perfect. IT was warm and the crust was very crispy. The cheese was nice and all toppings were bubbling with the fresh out of oven look. I immediately dug my fork/knife into the slice of heavenly goodness. First thought in mind was..\"wow this is quite garlicky\".  The greatest difference I felt about the Sicilian styled pizza vs typical american pizza chain store were that the crust is thick/crispy but not greasy at all. The tomato spread is rather light and does not carry that strong tomato paste taste. The layer of cheese was thin and isn't loaded with the typical chewy/stretchiness. Toppings were very generous as mine was just smothered with garlic/herbs and a hint of clam. I'm honestly a chicago style pizza fan and loves anything with thick buttery crust and loads of cheese. I would say that I still steer towards BJs' chicago style pizza and Pizza Huts Pan pizza. If not then I love the classic Italian at \"Bollinis\" over in LA. \n\nHowever, this was overall a good slice of pizza that would definitely be satisfying when you crave that hot fresh pizza with a thick/crispy crust. Service was fast. Pizza would be ready in 5 minutes and an order of beer would be paired pefectly for a late hang out with friends. Place is very cramp but with a fair amount of seat. It was rather pricey for a small rectangular slice at $3.75 but would be well worth it when you're craving some good pizza on the go.", "author": "Susan T."}

The Veggie Pesto pizza is nice, with lots of fresh veggies, and although I'm not a huge pesto fan, it works well in this situation.\n\nThe jars of red pepper flakes on the bar are stale and lack much heat, so I had to keep shaking some out onto the pizza to feel any kind of bite, but the powdered Parmesan cheese was salty and cheesy, so that was good.\n\nThe staff is attentive and friendly and flirty, even considering how busy it was, so extra bonus point!  \n\nAll told, this is a great slice of pie!", "author": "Paul B."}

The anticipation builds. The smells, the sounds, and the sights are all heightened. And then - BAM. Only this pleasure ride lasts longer than a minute of screaming and a few minutes of nausea. This is satisfying, cheesy euphoria the likes of which, I dare say, you won't find ANYWHERE else. The crust is soooo buttery and delicious. The Golden Boy name is well earned, as you can imagine.\n\nWhen you get in line, you'll be in single file probably out the door. If it's a late night and people have been drinking, you'll be waiting awhile. Have no fear. Totally worth it. The pleasant aroma of golden baked crust with smooth tomato sauce and fresh ingredients wafts from the open window...you know they do it on purpose. My favorite slice is the combo pizza, with a little bit of everything. The pepperoni is good too, as is the pesto. A slice will range from roughly $3-4...I'd advise buying two. A beer or a soda washes it down reeeeeally well! \n\nI don't know how I avoided writing a review about this place for this long? This is the place where I brought a girl for dinner, and she was swooning by the end of her first bite, proclaiming it the best she's ever had. Yep.\n\nTHAT'S WHAT SHE SAID.\n\np.s. Cash only. Be johnny on the spot with it too, cause the line is long and merciless. And have your pizza heated up there. It only takes a minute or so.\np.p.s.

Pure pizza heaven. I had a slice of pepperoni, and after that I debated for about a minute before I got another slice, this time the sausage (which is by far the best). \n\nIn addition to serving the best thick crust pizza for the lowest price the staff is incredible. The wonderful gentleman working behind the bar was extremely friendly, helpful, and even gave a dude a slice for free when he tried to pay with a credit card. There are very few places that can boast service at this quality... I wanted to give him a big hug and ask him to be my BFF (hoping for the benefit of free pizza) \n\nI think the pizza has some medicinal qualities as well.. my girlfriends and I ventured out afterwards for 3 dollar Jameson, after 4 of those and a shot of tequilla I expected myself to be plenty hungover for work and class today.. but I feel great, and I owe it all to Golden Boy! \n\nXOXO", "author": "Hailey P."}

The pizza is excellent, the place is open late, and usually about the time you craving pizza during a night of drinking, the Golden Boy is just what you need to re-fuel and keep going.  \n\nThe second time I came here was in '06 when a group our friends met in SF for our annual trip.

I've had pizza about twice already that week so at that point, I was kind of sick of pizza. Let me just say that this place was crackinnnnnnnnnn :D\nBasically, no matter how tired of pizza I am, I will ALWAYS be down for this place!\nFirst lets start of with the pizza. They don't do these basic circular pizzas that everywhere else has. They have SQUARE pizzas. Pizzas cut into SQUARES. Now if you're sexually attracted to Spongebob-shaped objects or if you have a fear of circles, THIS IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.\nThe pizza was DELICIOUS. I ordered two pepperoni slices and after finishing my first one, I was kinda already full to be honest because they aren't dinky little slices. But I really couldn't wait to get back home to eat the other slice! It was SO GOOD. The pepperoni was crispy and the crust on the bread was ON POINT. It was thick, crispy, fluffy, and saucy. OMG so good\nThe only complains I have is that the place is extremely small and cramped. So for my large fatass, I kind of had to get used to it. But my padre is quite petite vertically so he kind of just fit right in. There's limited seating so I suppose you have to make due. Also, when my padre ordered the pizza, it wasn't very saucy, as if it was lacking the sauce.\nBut aside from that, if you're ever drunk or are looking for some late night munchies after cheating on your wife at the strip club around the corner, COME HERE.", "author": "Johnny C."}

Since that one recommendation, I have returned here scores of times and brought many others along the way.\n\nTheir Sicilian square pizza slices are wonderful and varied for all palates. One piece is rarely enough, the taste will tempt you for seconds or thirds. They offer veggie slices too. Bring cash with you they don't take plastic.\n\nThe location is very narrow and cramped for seating. You can order pizza then and take a walk over to Washington Square to enjoy it. I once attempted to order an entire sheet pizza over the phone. The gentleman began to take my order and then just left the phone off the hook as he sounded too busy to be bothered.\n\nLove love love their pizza and I suppose I'll always come back if the pizza stays the same.", "author": "Derek B."}

In fact, this is the only pizza in San Francisco that my Dad considers as good as what he can get in Detroit, and he's way picky. I've always wondered if there was a Detroit connection to GB, but whenever I've asked, the answer has been 'I doubt it'. Unless you're from Detroit, you probably couldn't care less about my fascination, but for fellow former-Detroiters, this is your Buddy's/Louis'/Cloverleaf/Jets' style, and it's very good. The dough is slightly lighter, but every bit as good.\n\nIt seems people's tastes in pizza has a lot to do with what they're used to. They had this challenge once on FoodTV between Chicago style and New York style - fire fighters from Chicago and police officers from NY both tasting both. As you might guess, the fire fighters picked Chicago style and the police officers picked NY. I have a hunch that people that don't like GB are used to thin crust California style pizza. I actually happen to love all four styles - Chicago (Little Star is best), New York (I don't know, is Tomasso's NY style? If so, it's my favorite), Detroit (GB), and California (Gialina's, Arizmendi's, Cheese Board, maybe Delfina's, or Flour & Water?, which I have yet to try). All best in class.", "author": "Bib G."}

Well, after reading Yelp reviews I was expecting to be BLOWN AWAY, but I was just kinda like \"meh\". I mean, it wasn't bad, but it really wasn't the best pizza I've had... It kinda reminded me vaguely of Pizza Hut due to the really heavy, greasy consistency of it... So I guess I can expect to be hungry again in a few hours.\n\nThe price seemed just a little bit high; you could easily breach $10 just by ordering two slices, a beer, and a tip. The service environment itself is just insane. One lady was running to and fro, doing EVERYTHING in this heavily crowded place where you couldn't even move without rubbing your body into at least 5 people! Despite this, she was still very friendly and I wish I could have tipped her, but I've been avoiding tips on take-out orders due to the fact that I'm a broke art school student. But judging by the hefty amounts of bills stuffed into the tip pitchers and she being the only person working, I don't think she'll do too bad!\n\nI give Golden Boy 3 stars for being a decent pizza place; not bad but not like \"WOW\" either.\n\nEDIT: I decided to bump them up to 4 stars.

I ordered their combination pizza and i have to say that it is very good! The thing i liked most about it is its reasonable prices in proportion to their size portions.  I felt like for the 3 bucks i spent on a slice of combo, i got a pretty big slice.    Every kind of pizza in this place looked amazing!  \n\nThe other thing i enjoyed about this place was that they re-heat your pizza when you order it.  I know this doesn't sound very appetizing, but if you think of the pizza places that actually make you a fresh slice of pizza when you order it...this is pretty remarkable.  It is not to not just get a pizza that was made in the morning and sat under a heat lamp all day.  Their pizza sits at the window to draw customers in i suppose,  and when you order a slice, they put it back in the oven to re-heat for you.  \n\nLike i mentioned before this place does lose some points for their cash only policy and little to no seating.  A few places in North Beach are cash only also, so i guess this isn't too much of a new problem.  This place is also a bar which means good news for alcohol choice, but bad news for looking for a place to sit.  If you don't come early before the lunch rush or even after the lunch rush, don't expect to find a place to eat.  But hey, its pizza, you can eat it and walk :-)\n\nIf your in the area and are looking for very good pizza at a very reasonable price in a very short amount of time, then this place is for you! \n\nGood Pizza + Reasonable Prices + Fast Service = YUM :-P", "author": "Mark R."}

The aroma of the pizza just knocks you right out as you stand in that line that never goes away.  Pretty quick and friendly service.  The combination pizza that I got was topped with meat and veggies without a single spot missed!  Those wonderful toppings were supported by a layer of thick, gooey, yuuuumy cheese! Crust was not burned or soggy.... everything was made just right!  I literally inhaled this whole thing before I reach the end of the block.  Too bad the slices are a little too small.  I'm definitely looking forward on trying the rest of their menu.  Can't wait!", "author": "Maggie L."}

I like that there's a different assortment of pizzas displayed by the window. Once you choose your slice(s), the guy behind the counter puts your pizza in a salamander broiler (I think that's what the machine is called) and toasts up the pizza. It only takes a few minutes (depending if there is a large crowd or not) and then serves you the pizza piping hot! \n\nThis place has character, too. There's stickers, drawings, and pictures all around the walls. There's nothing pretentious about this joint.\n\nAs for the pizza itself, it's made on foccacia dough with a good amount of toppings . . . it's delicious, it's wonderful, it's terrific. My favourite is the pesto, cheese vegetarian. Golden Boy also has a pretty good beer selection.\n\nThe only downer is that this place is CASH ONLY.", "author": "Audrey S."}

Considering that we were in North Beach, what was better to eat other than the infamous North Beach Pizza that we have eaten only twice. But the Lombard St. Hill beat us up and the nearest location was too far for us to catch the bart on time to go back home to Berkeley. Wandering little Italy it became quite clear that we should follow that neon Pizza sign in the distance. \n\nThe place is a counter and stool kind of place- not the sit down and enjoy the ambiance of the room kind of thing. When you walk in, its quite dark and has a grungy kind of feel to it judging by the free form flyer/poster/ stickering on the walls. Despite the avant art on the wall and the grungy feel to the room you are welcomed with the aroma of pizza, great two team service, and unlimited fountain soda refills.\n\n Being famished and rolling four deep, I thought it impossible to actually get counter space and stools altogether. BUT we did it. After deciding that a whole pie is kinda pricey to be split amongst us and would require a thirty minute wait- we decided to get individual slices (we have to catch the bart!!) \n\nThe pizza was amazing! It had great flavor and the texture was perfect, it crust was crisp but light and airy. I had the obligatory pepperoni slice as a tester slice and just to tell you- they don't skimp on the meat! I also split half a combo slice with Zack that had yummy sausage, pepp., and some veggies. After one and a half slices I was stuffed! What a perfect ending to our biking adventure in San Fran. \n\nZ: Exactly true! The server helping us, awesome! In the midst of the rush that followed us, she just totaled our order and saved it for the end, very nice. She didn't rush us like the usual hole in the wall in SF. The final price was a couple of dollar shy of the full sheet of combo that we were intending to buy - but keep in mind, we did buy drinks and left sufficiently stuffed. Fabuloso!\n\nThe lady also suggested to wait a bit for a fresh pizza to come out... what a relief! There is still a place that cares. This does not make sense to me since the old pizza will probably not make profit and will go into the bellies of the workers. Very nice gesture.\n\nWe both felt this place doesn't get much attention, so we decided to give a great pizza place a good review. Great place to catch a slice, but I would imagine that getting a seat would be hard during the afternoon.", "author": "ZacKandMeL M."}

We had a late night pizza craving and boy did this place \"hit the spot!\" \n\nGolden Boy Pizza opens late for those late night cravings (like we had). We went out on a Wednesday night, so \"late night\" was until midnight. Although there are many places to eat pizza in the North Beach area, I think this is by far the best pizza I've tasted.  Arriving there I was expecting a full blown restaurant with tables, chairs and your typical Parmesan and red pepper flake shakers placed on the table, I was totally off. This place is a small building big enough for the kitchen, workers and of course the pizza. They display their pizza by the window which allowed me to pick what I wanted. Being that it was late and 3 minutes after midnight there was only one type of pizza left, I believe it was a combination, with zucchini, if I may add, MM! The person working behind the window was kind enough to heat it up for us. I was surprised by its size for the price we paid which was a little under 4 bucks. \n\nBiting into their pizza was the most awesome pizza eating experience ever!. The crust was toasty (how I like it), the cheese was cheesy and there was just enough toppings on the square sized pizza. We shared one slice which was just about right for a snack.

We were a little wary when we realized that everyone in line was pretty wasted looking.  Looks like the perfect place to go to right after having a few rounds.  We read the reviews on Yelp and decided to go with the highly praised clam garlic slices.  It came out fresh right as we ordered it, tons of parsley, tons of garlic, and possibly some clam.  I think this is where the benefit of being drunk would help here - now, pay attention because I've NEVER said this before - there was way too much going on here.  I think if our tongues were doused in alcohol, it would have been perfect, but my sober tongue was bombarded by (and i can't believe I'm saying this) too much garlic and too much parsley.  If they would have cut that back by 50%, it would have been awesome - but as it was, i felt like I was chewing on grass a few times.  I could only taste the clam when I realized I was crunching on sand.  \n\nNow that being said, the pizza dough was AWESOME, cheese was great, sauce was perfect.

You visually get to see what slices are available.  Also, read their menu board, it's super funny.  One of the quotes is \"If you don't see it, don't ask\".  Meaning, if you don't see your slice of pizza available, then don't bother asking.  But once a tray is gone, they work right away to get another out there.  Wait for them to come out with it or order what's available.  They also have beer and wine there...  Such a local spot and the pizza is so good!  So good, that I am satisfied with a slice of cheese!

I decided to eat there and took a seat at the back area of the bar, where I had a great view of the unsmiling dough-kneader. The female server was very personable, however, and even brought my slice out to me after a short fire in the oven. She also gave me a cup of ice water at no charge, which she wasn't snotty about either. Too bad, my joy was shortlived.\nFirst of all, there were only about 4 teensy shriveled clams on my big square slice. The slice of pizza is about the size of a big notecard, and the amount of clams looked very sad as a ratio of clams to dough.\nSecondly, there were several blackened garlic cloves decorating the top. Burnt garlic imparts a reaallly strong and unavoidable taste; this basically turned me off the taste of the entire slice.\nLastly, there were black olives on the pie. Black. Olives. Who the F puts black olives on a clam & garlic pie??? There were more black olives than clams on the pie - unforgivable.\nI am awarding one star for the friendly service, and one star for the nice char on the crust - otherwise, Golden Boy is a bit tarnished in my opinion.

And most of these places look either closed, or beyond your budget, or dirty and crowded. Then someone says \"hey, I know a pizza place, that's pretty good.\"\n\n\"Where is it?\"\n\n\"It's around here.\"\n\n\"Where?\"\n\n\"Like, around here somewhere.\"\n\n\"How do we get there?\"\n\n\"You wander around and you look for the hand.\"\n\nNot entirely sure what this means but unwilling to argue, you play along. You walk down one block, then up another. You pass by a cheesesteak place that looks passable, and try to get everyone to stop, but they're all engaged in a conversation about Borat or something.\n\nAnother block, cross the street, backtrack. Whatever. It is a good thing to walk; it gets the blood flowing, and the blood will suck the alcohol out of your brain and ferry it down to your liver, where some science thing will happen and it will all go away, and then you'll have the presence of mind to escape this hopeless task...\n\nRounding a corner and halfway down the next block, and there it is: The big neon hand, pointing you toward the door. Those directions were spot on the money. You try to make a mental note of the name (Golden ... Boy ... Pizza) but the next time you come here it will still just be \"that place, you walk around until you see the hand...\"\n\nThe pizza is delicious (if you ever try it sober, it turns out to be pretty bad, actually). And there's beer. But there's nowhere to sit, and barely anywhere to stand. Eventually you edge your way to a stool five seats away from your friends (which, at this point in the evening, is not an entirely unwelcome turn of events). You eat slowly, using too many napkins, and try to let the sea of torsos pressing up against you fall from your mind...\n\nI can understand why some people love it, but ultimately Golden Boy's just another dirty hole-in-the-wall pizza/beer joint that looks and feels for a moment like it might be something more, but never delivers. And it's always inexplicably packed (maybe because the rest of the drunk food in the area is so much worse). It does however make a good first impression. I recommend giving it a try, when the time is right.", "author": "Wayne W."}

My personal favorites are the plain cheese & pesto vegetarian.\n\nThey have several beers on tap and it's quite inexpensive to compliment your hot squares of pie with a pitcher of Sierra, Bud Light, or other weapon of choice.  The crowd there is always a great mix of stoners, local North Beach homeless folk, yuppies, and tourists.  They usually only staff 1 individual at the front, and he/she is incredibly efficient at serving multiple customers.\n\nI would stay away from this place after 11 pm on Fri & Sat nights because the line becomes very VERY long.

The first thing that I noticed about it was that the pizza isn't in Pie form. The pizza is a long inch thick piece of pizza crust that has stuff on it. It's about what I'd expect pizza was like before it came to America, or at least how it returned to Italy. \n\nThe conistency of the crust reminded me of the deep dish pizza that domino's used to do (or still does). The edges had a nice little crispness to it. There really isn't a \"end crust\" like you get in a pie.\n\nThe downside to the pizza I had there was that the pepperoni pizza had like 5 pieces of pepperoni per slice. The combination slice, though, was chalk full of toppings. So if you're gonna go here take a look at the slices before you order and make sure you aren't going to get what is essentially a slice of cheese pizza. The pepperoni wasn't anything special. \n\nI wouldn't make this a destination but might go out of my way while walking around North Beach to get a slice here.

Unless you order a whole pie, you have two pizzas in the window to choose from but I've never been even slightly displeased with any of their slices.

You gotta love any place that has a picture of Christopher Walken placed prominently on the wall, and that plays skate DVDs as the entertainment.

I was drinking a Red Hook--as I'm almost done with the pint he grabs the glass and refills it.  Before you know it, I got 4 beers for the price of one.  I don't remember the guys name, but he was possibly the friendliest server I've ever had outside of a strip club.  Another time I was there before a show, and was tired and in an insanely bad mood, not even wanting to go to the show afterward.

Of course, that life-changing slice didn't hurt either.\n\nIt's a small place with two metal counters, so it can be crazy on Friday or Saturday nights.  I've never found that to be an issue either though, since everybody is so blissed-out on the pizza I've had nothing but good times there (I've gone at least 40-50 times).  I'm not sure why anyone wouldn't like this place, someone else pointed out the level of the reviewer's drunkenness may be a factor.  Maybe so, but drunk or sober, Golden Boy's slabs of loveliness do it for me every time.", "author": "The D."}

We would meet here to discuss concepts for new projects and pieces, while many pieces were consumed. Even though the place has its obvious deterrents at times, the long lines and nowhere to sit, the little squares of gastronomic heaven make up for it. Beyond the pizza itself you get an interesting mix people at this place ranging from tourists, art students, and the Beat Patriarchs of the neighborhood.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-07-21", "description": "I have to disagree with the masses.  The pizza from Golden Boy is not that great.  It seems like most positive reviewers come here after a fun night of inebriation, which usually tends to alter the senses.  I, on the other hand, have yet to try these square slices under the influence because each time I've been here, I'm left unimpressed and unsatisfied (just the other night, I had a slice at Golden Boy, and went home to make my own Trader Joe's bbq chicken pizza).  In my sober state of mind, the pizza is always bland and the crust is always lacking oomph.  It's a bit thicker than normal pizza crust, but it lacks a crispiness.  It's like eating focaccia pizza, ugh.  Each time I've been here, they have been out of their notoriously tasty garlic clam pizza, so I've always opted with the combo slice.  You can never go wrong with combo slices, right?  But at $3.75 for a slice, it's pricey and not that tasty.  To avoid the long wait and the obnoxious drunks, get here an hour or two before last call.\n\nI was once excited to come here since they serve up Sicilian-style pizza, which is reminiscent of all the pizzerias I went to in Italy (fyi: best pizza in the entire world as far as I know: L'Antica Bottica della Pizza in Rome!!!)

SORRY that's when this place failed epically. Whether she heard wrong or got things confused or whatever, she should have just said ok, no problem, it will be 5 or 10 minutes for the pepperoni and that would have been fine. But no, after i told her i WAS NOT going to pay for something i didn't order, she clearly was frustrated, had an attitude and snatched the sausage pizza from the counter and throws it away in a trashcan in front of me with an attitude and says something like \"fine\" and says she will make the pepperoni one. i told her she could save the attitude as it was uncalled for. i will never come back to this place. the pizza is great but i did not appreciate that. i just wanted what i ordered. if she got the order wrong, no problem. fix it and move on but dont argue with customers. never coming back.", "author": "Food C."}

I think Golden Boy Pizza has the best pizza in the city. A few months ago, I invited a friend to join me and have pizza at Golden Boy. My friend is Italian, and he was visiting San Francisco for the first time in his life. He had never eaten at Golden Boy Pizza. After my friend had finished eating his slice of pizza, he told me that it was excellent. Sometimes, lines of up to 15-30 people form at the front door, especially during the evening on Fridays and Saturdays anywhere from around 6PM to after midnight. However, on those occasions when there is a line, it moves quickly. The service is fast. Obviously, all of those people think that the wait of a few minutes to eat Golden Boy pizza is worth the time. Golden Boy serves a whole lot of pizza. It is always fresh. The freshly baked pizza goes from the oven to the front display case. When a customer places an order at the front register, one of the staff places the pizza in the microwave to heat it up to maximum palatable temperature. The pizza always tastes fresh and delicious because any pizza in the front display came out of the oven only a few seconds or a few minutes before you placed your order. I eat pizza at no other place. When I want pizza, I'm off to the Golden Boy.", "author": "Jack T."}

I would like to say that my one and only experience at Golden Boy was done in a sober state, so my review has some merit. Anyway, the pizza is pretty good, but not what I had been hoping for, I had heard soooo much about this place that I had some high expectations. First of all, Golden Boy is Sicilian style pizza, so if you're not into the doughy nature of that style, like me, this won't be an amazing slice for you. I recommend giving it a try, but definitely go during the week when you can skip the line.

Both were delicious and went well with the Lagunitas IPA. Since I am new to the city it is nice to find a place where you can fly solo and have a great time. Both times I arrived there was a fun group of people sitting on the bar stools. They also have a ipod plugged into an amp so that you can hear the unique taste of the server/bartender. The only downside was the kooky way that they would line up people waiting for a spot. This place is small and very good so it is understandable that you will have a line on a Friday night. Where it became annoying was that they did not manage the line well and some people were able to sneak in while others patiently waited longer then necessary. They also allowed a couple of especially pushy fellas take a seat and order a beer without waiting in line and then would not serve them pizza until their place in line came in.

I finally had to stop eating here though because i was getting killer heartburn every time I had a slice (hard to tell whether it was the copious amounts of booze, or the pizza, or the combination of both - one of life's great mysteries)... anyways I still think this pizza is solid, and I like the casual vibe and the walkup window late-nite style (although I do not dig the late-nite line).  Coincidentally, in my 28 years the closest I have EVER come to getting into an actual physical altercation was right otuside this place!  The story goes a little something like this - we were next in line, there was half a sheet of cheese pizza left and NOTHING else, and my friends and I decided to be complete a-holes and order the whole sheet, despite the 20 peeps in line behind us.... the resulting scene was not pretty.

Taste SO much better than reheating them at say 375 degrees for a longer period of time.  I know it might be a waste of energy, but you can't fuck around with good pizza.", "author": "Adrian M."}

I was super stoked on my veggie slice (is that right terminology? Their portions are square.  I mean, you don't get a slice of brownie.  But I digress.).  It had lots of different veggies piled on top of mozzarella and pesto, served with real silverware at a bar with plenty of seating and a nice selection of beer (Racer 5 IPA? Yes, please).  Now, I'm that asshole who likes to have my cake (pie?) and eat it too, so if my pizza has pesto sauce solomente, I'm going to want some marinara to boot.  The pizza jerk behind the counter (he was very nice) obliged and apologized that it would be cold.  It didn't matter.  Everything was tasty and satisfying, and for a Wednesday night they were doing quite the tidy window service business.  Definitely a good spot if you're in the mood for a quick bite and you're over on that side of town.  Especially when you're drinking.  I have seen the window service get pretty busy on weekend nights.", "author": "Amanda B."}
