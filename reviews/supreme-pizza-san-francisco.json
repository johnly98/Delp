{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-05-01", "description": "I was admittedly a little hesitant to visit this establishment based on the reviews I've seen, but the power of a late night pizza crave one night provided enough activation energy to have me walking at a brisk pace to the shop. The location seems a little intimidating, but being a block from Mission Street at least ensured that it was well within a populated area, depending on the time of day of course. Anyway, getting to the food, I was surprised to see that the slices were individually made, a true rarity in today's mostly mass produced pizza pies found at other locations.\n\nI ordered a pepperoni slice, which set me back a mere 4.50, an astonishing deal which cannot be matched in the ever gentrifying neighborhood that the Mission is becoming. Mind you, this slice in fact is 2 slices of a large pizza, so it is quite the bargain. Fresh pizza cannot be underestimated. The dough is quite good. It has lovely airiness, enough crunch, and offers enough structural integrity for the delicious sauce to instill confidence in the eater. The mozzarella cheese gives enough saltiness without overpowering the rest, while the pepperoni provides the kick I was craving. These flavors, combined with a piping hot temperature, resulted in an extremely satisfying experience. To be honest with you, I was quite shocked at how great this slice was.\n\nTo update from a present day's perspective, I have since visited Supreme Pizza 3 times, and ordered online to expedite the process. It took around 10 minutes for my order to be ready. I heartily recommend this shop for your quick pizza needs, though I will add a disclaimer that I have yet to expand on the rest of the menu. Time will tell if I will choose to forego my usual pepperoni slice, but I will certain update my review if I do so. I'm curious to see how a whole pie will perform, and am wondering about the non pizza items as well. For now though, Supreme Pizza is in my opinion, the King of Mission pizza.", "author": "Daniel E K."}

The crust is a slightly chewy hand tossed style and the toppings are in the right proportion for the size of the pizza.  They pay attention to the notes you write on the order and don't mess it up, so they should probably get the extra star just for that! \n\nDelivery time seems to always be earlier than quoted as well.

For some reason, the homemade Tom Yum I had been nomming on all day left me feeling empty, and emptiness requires pizza. To myself.

Not wanting to spend more than $15 on myself for a meal, I figured this pizza would last for more than one meal so it was a good purchase. Ordering was easy thanks to Yelp's online ordering, and my pizza arrived after about 30 minutes. $12.88 total, plus I tipped the guy as I raspily thanked him. \n\nThe pizza was great. Simple and honest, and a great companion to me and my cat Will as we finished up season two of Orange is the New Black (take that, V!). Lots of flavorful sauce, plenty of cheese and peperoni.

I work in a really busy office and I use Eat24 because they bring my deliveries to me and I dont have to leave. what was enticing to me was that Supreme didnt charge a delivery Fee, and they only had a min. of $10 for Delivery (in SoMa, where everyone is asking for 25-45 to consider delivering your food!) So I was ecstatic to find that they werent requiring too much, and they even had GREAT prices. ok, it honestly made me think it was going to be Sub-par, butttttt...\n\nI ordered a San Francisco Pizza Slice, a Salad, and a Huge snapple and it was like 13 with Tax. First of all, my food came FAST, I'm going to say in like 20-25 minutes! It was still HOT, and it was GOOD, like really GOOD. Plus my \"Slice\" was Huge! It was 2 pieces, that were cooked as one pizza, it was larger than a small pizza at a chain pizza place. The salad was fresh and crisp and everything was clearly washed and preat.\n\nListen, if you are looking for some Froo froo, gourmet pizza, then this isn't it. This is good (really good) freshly baked, pizza. The toppings were awesome, and the crust was good and it was a great value and a really good quality product. Me and my co workers have decided this is our go to place for lunch from now on.\n\nQuick, Amazing prices, and a lot of Food, plus it really is Good. You can not beat that! the only reason I didnt give them 5 stars is because its just \"regular\" pizza but if thats what you're looking for. then this is for you! I'm a regular chick, I like normal, uncomplicated, good food without a lot of extras. Oh and they have some great combinations of pizza or just make your own! \n\nLove them!", "author": "Monique C."}

He called me to say he was here 15 minutes before he was actually here.

I said \"sir, we're not done here.\"  He turns around, walks uncomfortably close, and starts wagging his hand in my face.  Swears at me some more.  Tells me I should call the owner of the restaurant.  I tell him I plan to, and what's his name?\n\nHe walks away, middle finger held high in the air.  So, I call EatStreet, then I call the restaurant.\n\nWell now he's picking up the phones, and he pauses before giving his first name.  Also, now it turns out (he claims) that *he* is the owner of the restaurant!  And there's nobody to talk to but him in the middle of the day.\n\nNo accommodation for the extremely late, ice cold food.  Not allowed to take the tip-on-credit-card back.  No accommodation for being sworn at for politely asking for an explanation.  No accommodation for getting a finger waved in my face.\n\nI feel like a fool for recommending these people twice; once today.\n\nAvoid at any cost.

They made a lot of GREAT changes to their menu - basically threw everything out. The best things about the pizza are the crust and the cheese. The crust is thin, light, and flavorful. The cheese is nice and gooey. I've tried two types of pizza so far. The Prima and the Margarita. Both were delish. The only thing I didn't really like about the Margarita (and this is REALLY small) is that the tomatoes were chopped and not sliced - kind of messed with the balance of flavors. Other than that, the pizza was really delish! I've only tried the individual slices, but look forward to trying a whole pie and the wide range of salads and pastas.
