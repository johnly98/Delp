The cashier is the most unfriendly person I've ever met.  She doesn't care to say good morning or make you feel welcomed, not even a smile.  This morning, I went in to get my coffee, and she saw me going towards the coffee dispenser and yet she went ahead of me to get herself a coffee when what she should have done is to allow the customer, me (!) to get it first!  How impolite!  I'm in the service industry, and if I see a customer coming in to get her coffee, I will certainly let her get hers first!  One of my coworkers went in and got his food and went to her to pay for it, and she told him, it's not 6:30am yet, you have to wait 2 minutes.  He never went back.  I want to say though, the middle eastern guy, who seems to be the owner or manager, is very nice, always saying good morning.  Maybe he can teach the cashier about good customer service and good manners! Having a smile won't hurt business either!

Naturally, I opened the Yelp App (shameless plug), found Focaccia Market was right next to me and thought, welp let's give it a shot. Apparently this place gets pretty long lines but, that wasn't my experience when I was there. \n\nI'll be the first to admit, I was really confused with the \"make your own\" salad menu. It's not very clear but, there are tons of options you can add to your salad so props to that. The woman helping me out was super nice and friendly and walked me through the process with ease. Pheeeew. :) \n\nI ordered the mixed greens and added a few different things (not important) and added chicken. The next thing I noticed was how huge the salad was! It's actually a really good deal and next time I come back I'm totally just getting the regular size. Look, the salad was pretty good, not mindblowing, but fine. The reason for 3 stars, not 4 was the quality of chicken. These days you have to have quality proteins and the chicken was clearly low quality meat. I was actually kind of surprised because they serve \"Boars Head\" brand meats at their deli counter. Maybe they should just use those instead...\n\nIf you're on a budget and want a sizable lunch, I'd say stop by for a visit. Just make sure you're not getting any chicken on the salad :)", "author": "Benjamin F."}

Everyone basically chose a lunch box.\n\nI ended up getting a Specialty salad box ($14.95). Decided on the Seafood salad box (+$1): grilled salmon, chopped romaine lettuce, edamame, tomatoes, cucumbers and lime vinaigrette dressing with Fruit salad, Cookies. I wasn't sure if I was going to like the food here as their selection seemed kind of boring. I was pleasantly surprised. The salad was super fresh and a hefty portion. I adored the refreshing lime dressing and the salmon wasn't overcooked. I did note in my order that I wanted the salmon medium, so I wasn't sure how much that attributed to the cooking of the salmon. The fruit salad was disappointing as the watermelon was mushy and a piece looked kind of moldy. I ended up throwing it away. I didn't try the cookie as I don't really like chocolate.

For the amount of salad you get in a small size (which is kind of a lot!), you get your money's worth. The first 3 toppings you add are free and the fourth one onward costs extra. My only complaint is that the employees don't really keep track of how many toppings they add to your salad, so sometimes you add more than 3 unknowingly. I'm also unsure of how clean this place is because the employee at the end will toss your salad and place it in a plastic container, but will wipe your container with a dirty cloth used for the table and everyone else's salad order.

Breakfast, lunch, or picking up food to go (yummy rotisserie chicken) before I head home for work.  Breakfast - I tend to go for croissant sandwiches, bacon, fruit, oatmeal, etc; Lunch - I order salads (way earlier than noon so I don't hit the line) for my work lunches; Dinner - I order salads and take them home for my dinner; Other Occasions - anytime that I'm going to a potluck meal, I always try to sign up for a salad because I know I can go to Focaccia and pay a great price for a great salad and not cut a single vegetable!  \nI would love to make food at home but I don't have time to prep and I can get 8 toppings for cheap compared to other salad places in the city so I feel like I'm getting a great deal.  The salad bar choices are fantastic, the prices are reasonable, the service is always with a smile.  I'm eating a club sandwich as we speak and it's fresh and made hot.  Did I mention that there's also pre-made food so you don't have to wait in any line unless you want to customize your meal?

I mostly come here for the hot meal, which has its own line (or rather, no line at all!). The hot meal consist of the entree and 2 sides for anywhere between $12 - $15. I've had the Coq au Vin (which was a bit dry and the sauce didn't provide much additional flavor) and the Tri Tip, which actually came out pretty tasty and not over cooked. The entree specials change daily which is great because I'd get so sick of eating their roasted chicken day after day. \n\nThe available sides look like they've been pre-cooked hours earlier (especially the grilled veggies which I'm prone to getting), but at least there's a little variety. \n\nI really do wonder what's with this city's obsession with standing in line for salad.", "author": "Virginia T."}

Focaccia  was one of those places that  wasn't on a walking route to my work or conveniently near any regular place that I go to lunch.  \n\nOne day, I did take a special trip to come here for lunch and I was quite surprised at how orderly and organized they arranged the internal layout of their business.  The sandwiches had one line, the salads had another line, and then the hot entrees were another line.  I lined up in the salads line and it was a pretty long line, even longer than the Tender Greens line one block away.  Long lines usually are no big deal as long as they are turning over salads super fast.  On that day, it wasn't as quick as I hoped it to be.\n\nTheir salad system is build your own style so three ingredients plus protein and other fancy extras are extra.  They have a small size and large size salad option, just like Pluto's.  Just for research purposes, I ordered the large salad with chicken and avocado.  The total came out to a bit over $12 but it was a big salad.  This can easily be shared by two people.  Since I don't like sharing my lunch, I ate half of it at lunch and then the rest a few hours later.\n\nMy salad came with focaccia bread which is way better than some of the nasty bread sides that I've gotten at other lunch places.  The prices here are more expensive than Pluto's but around the Tender Greens/Mixt Greens level.  I probably will try a sandwich here in the future but the salads were a bit pricy for my taste.", "author": "Ben H L."}

I got the cranberry scone and eating it right now on my work desk. It is delicious! Perfectly textured to be dry and harder on the outside and softer less dry on the inside. Most scones you'd buy at the national chain coffee shops are dry both in and out of the scone. This scone from Focaccia doesn't even need to be dipped in my coffee. I had a bagel with regular cream cheese last week and that was delicious also. Price for the delicious scone was 2.95 (not bad). I can't remember what I paid for the bagel with cream cheese but I do remember it being remarkably cheaper than what I used to pay for in LA.\n\nAs for the place itself. Very modern inside. If you want a bagel with a spread, there is one line and the other has a more prepared breakfast sandwich. For quick takeout (e.g. scones, muffins, boxed lunches, etc), they are on the opposite side of the market.

You have a half-hour before your next meeting, the one your colleague scheduled because he claimed he couldn't find any other convenient time slot. Convenient for him, he should have said. What to do. I didn't have a muffin this morning. So Focaccia has become my emergency grab-n-go spot for a salad or a sandwich. It's a more reasonably priced alternative to Mixt Greens and without the claustrophobia factor of those endless lines. The expansive space helps as do the explicit directions on how they assemble their food.\n\nYou know the drill. You pick among four types of lettuces, then you need to pick three of the multitude of toppings that they offer. Decide before you get to the preparer because you're holding me up. I'll be late for my meeting. Tick-tock, tick-tock. I have a thing for beets and hearts of palm, so I just need to decide on a third... cucumbers for the crunch. You then decide on your dressing. There are nine. Hurry up! The salad up to this point costs $7.25 for a large bowl (see photo) or $5.25 for a small. Additional toppings cost 75-cents per on a large and 50-cents per on a small.\n\nIt also adds up if you add meat or seafood or avocados. At that point, you should probably be making a reservation at the Pig Trough. I made that up, but don't tell me you didn't get at least a little excited at the idea of a Pig Trough. OK, go wait in another line for the register and pick up your bag of bread. Run back to the office 'cause you're five minutes late now. A good-enough salad. Nothing to distract me from the meeting.

They're plenty filling (even the small size one), tasty and reasonably priced (~$6). While there can be a long line at lunch, it does move quickly since they have 3-4 people working behind the salad bar counter. \n\nHere's some salad ordering tips:\n\n1) When it's your turn, move to a position in front of salad maker so you can hear each other. It can get noisy in there.\n2) Choose your base leafery (arugula, mixed, baby spinach, kale, etc)\n3) Choose your toppings. 3 are included, and meat costs extra. \n4) Choose your dressing. They will also also ask light, medium, heavy. IMO, light tends to be enough.\n5) (Optional) Choose specialized toppings. There are some additional toppings (croutons, nuts, sunflowers seeds, etc.)  on the sides of the salad bar. These are not listed on the blackboard.\n6) (Optional) There's complimentary focaccia bread in both white/wheat forms next to salad counter. Unfortunately, it's greasy and spongy and just unappetizing. Yes, I just recommended skipping focaccia bread at a place called 'Focaccia'.\n\nWhat about the other stuff?\n\nThey offer sandwiches. They're a step above Subways, but not my favorites. You can get them toasted as well.\n\nThey also have a rotating menu for the hot meal entrees (with customizable sides). It feels like old school cafeteria type food and can be bland, but I always check it out. I've had some unexpectedly good food. You'll probably have leftovers as well.\n\nProTip: There's a soup line to right side of salad bar, so you can skip the salad line and order some soup directly. Their soups are pretty good most days.\n\nProTip #2: Cookies at payment counter are tasty.", "author": "Pedrum M."}

Be prepared for a long wait, you definitely have to time your arrival. \n\nFOOD\nIts mainly a salad spot because everything is so fresh.  The line is sometimes 20 minutes because its so popular.  They have whole eggs that they smash to order or egg whites.  There is also a protein option you can add.  I have also had the sandwiches, I love the fact that you can get it toasted.  They have really good cheese options, my favorite is the gouda.  There is a variety of meat options as well, not your typical processed stuff but REAL meat.  The hot food station typically varies by day but consistently there is rotisserie chicken.  Breakfast - fresh omelets (does not use egg beater), potatoes, oatmeal, breakfast sandwiches (croissant, bagels).  Everything comes with free focaccia bread, hence the name lol.  Also good portions regardless of it being lunch, breakfast, sandwich or hot food! \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE\nDespite the long lines they are pretty fast considering how much traffic they get each day.

I ordered a large salad (I was hungry) with corn, red beans and fresh mozzarella. I ended up adding chicken as well with ranch. The salad was great. The price was not. It was super pricey all that and a drink for $15 bucks. The mozzarella by the way are huge chunks and not shredded like I thought they would be. The salad is delicious though and fresh. I would definitely go back, but probably settle for a small to help not put such a big dent in my wallet!", "author": "James R."}

Then look no further than Focaccia! I've consistently gone here (and the one in China Basin) for a couple years now and they have consistently put me into greenery-induced coma. Yes, I always get the LARGE, and yes, it usually lasts me two meals unless I'm feeling a little masochistic.\n\nSome of the salad makers are a little more generous than others, so sometimes I am resigned to a 1.5 pound salad instead. First world problems. Anyway, spicy chicken is great! Their greens and toppings are always fresh and great quality - I usually go with mixed greens & arugula with some combination of beets, mushrooms, artichoke, and hearts of palm. Lime vinaigrette is also a winner!\n\nOn days I don't feel like braving the line (yes, there's always a line, but it goes pretty fast), I beeline to the hot foods counter (usually no line!) and get their rotisserie chicken! Half a chicken with two sides again covers two meals for about $11! \n\nEveryone here is pretty friendly and efficient. They are super busy so sometimes can be curt but I've never had a bad experience. I admire their energy and ability to keep up with all these crazy salad-mongers, myself included.\n\nThey recently upped their prices due to increased ingredient costs but it's pretty negligible.

I only moved to San Francisco about a month ago, but I have gone here every almost every weekday for three weeks.\n\nFocaccia is super popular and busy during lunchtime, but the lines move very quickly. They have individual lines for sandwiches, salads, soups, and hot bar. The build-your-own salads are by far the most popular item, and with good reason. They have a very large variety of items, and their portions are huge. You can choose between a \"small\" and a \"large\" salad, but unless you haven't eaten in days, the \"small\" salad will probably do the trick. I myself am a 6'2, 220 lb dude and am typically full after a small salad. I tried the large once and couldn't finish it.\n\nThe variety of toppings is what makes this place my favorite. Typically I am suuuuper picky about salads, but this place has every kind of topping you could want (even stuff like strawberries, grapes, goat cheese, unique proteins, etc). To top it off, you get a free, homemade foccacia with your salad (wheat or white). Other salad places may give you a small piece of lame bread, but the focaccia here is large and decadent (honestly you may want to avoid it if you're trying to cut calories, but it's delicious).\n\nThey also have great breakfast here - omelettes, egg sandwiches, etc.", "author": "Nahrek H."}

They also have never updated their menu to indicate all of the options. The menu shows a breakfast sandwich and wrap, but clearly they prepare omelets and non-sandwich-based breakfast plates. They just don't give any information about pricing, so I never order it.\n\nThat's a minor annoyance to me, since I seldom order breakfasts. \n\nI used to get their prepared salads on at least a weekly basis (no way I'm standing in line for a salad), although the last few months I've been bringing lunch from home. But today I picked up one of their prepared salads (small \"Oriental\" salad) for $7.95, and was pretty shocked to dig into it and realize that they've reduced the amount of food by nearly half. \n\nSee, I deconstruct these pre-packaged salads at my desk before I eat them. I take out the chicken and cut it into pieces, then I pre-cut all of the lettuce, red peppers and two cherry tomatoes. I like chopped salads, so this helps me replicate the chopped salad experience. \n\nToday I noticed that there is less than half the chicken in the salad that there was in the past. Also, the lettuce used to be packed tightly into the clamshell, so that when I cut it and tossed it around, it was overflowing the plastic bowl. I actually felt that there was too much lettuce, and the full container of dressing was just enough to cover it all. Today I noticed that all the salads only took up half the clamshells, and none of them seemed to be tightly packed. There's probably half the lettuce that they used to use. Still two cherry tomatoes though. And a full cup of dressing, which I only needed to use half of, and still wound up with pools of dressing at the bottom when finished.\n\nI don't like it when places try to increase their margins by sneakily reducing the servings. I'd prefer a straight-forward price increase, or some other clear declaration. \n\nFinally, there was one incident where a miscommunication between me and the breakfast cook led to be being overcharged for what I ordered. The manager came over and immediately took the cook's side, suggesting that I was trying to somehow scam them. After I explained what had happened, and she realized that it was a miscommunication about the order, she relented, but I was so shocked that her immediate position was to attack the customer. \n\nI now avoid this place, only going in if I can't find a yogurt parfait anywhere else.

However the chicken itself was average, and even though you get a lot of food by the end I wasn't dying to finish it. \n\nMore importantly...BE AWARE: This place gets absolutely packed at lunch. We came at 12:30 and it was a MISTAKE. Certainly it was the usual lunch hour rush, but the lines were moving very, very slowly which is obviously frustrating. I couldn't even mess around with the sandwich or salad lines because they were 20 people deep, which was disappointing. So I was all but forced into ordering the chicken. \n\nHowever, there are three good things about the place: 1) Lots of options for lunch, 2) Fairly priced, 3) Great location (esp. if you work in Embarcadero Center)\n\nAll-in-all this place is solid, if unspectacular.

The wraps are wrapped in foil but 2 of them had the foil ripped, they were a decent size.  I was really disappointed in the salads which are 1/2 the size of the ones we order from Specialty's, the ingredients were stuffed in a small container.  One of the salads came with brown apples, it looks like the catering is brought into this location and not made at this location which I assumed they did.  \n\nOn Tuesday I placed an order online for bagels and again I was a little disappointed, I paid almost $45 for 12 bagels and 2 fruit containers.

Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to really take a look around the prepared food section since I heard it has some pretty good stuff. \n\nI got the smoked salmon sandwich. Not too bad except the guy behind the counter gave me an extra chunk of salmon in the middle of the sandwich, which you think would be a good thing but it overwhelmed the sandwich and made it taste a little bit too fishy so I ended up picking out the extra fish. My boyfriend got the roast beef which I thought was a little on the dry side (even though it was flavored very nicely). \n\nWhat I loved the most was that you could build your own sandwich from ingredients that looked fresh and they had a variety of choices that you wouldn't be able to find at your local subway (like the smoked salmon). The sandwich sizes were pretty big too. I could only finish half but since it is on the pricier side, i was expecting a lot of food. I grabbed a piece of focaccia bread at the checkout counter and I can see why they decided to name themselves after it. Very light and fluffy texture with a perfect amount of salt and oil. That was probably the best part of the entire meal. \n\nNote: When I went, there was a pretty long line for both the salad and the sandwiches and I have been told it is pretty much like that everyday so don't expect this to be the place to grab a quick bite (unless you get the already prepared food). Especially with the sandwiches, they heat up the bread and meat so it will take a little bit of time. Also, there is no where to sit even though it is such a large place. \n\nOverall three stars because they have decent food, selections, and portions but the price and the wait time make this a place I probably will not frequent very often. Maybe I will try the prepared food next time since it cuts out the wait time.", "author": "Julie Z."}

If you forget your lunch and want something cheap and healthy, Focaccia is the place to go! \n\nHere's how it works. You choose a green (spinach, arugula, mixed greens, etc.), three additional ingredients (nuts, cheese, veggies, berries, protein--i.e. chicken, quinoa), dressing, and tell the lovely people behind the counter who promptly toss the salad together and put it in a little container so it's all ready to go. The small containers cost $5 and change and they're definitely big enough to fill up a moderately hungry person. Aaaand they come with a little side of bread (you have to grab those at the cash register). \n\nThe people are nice and speedy.

I have trouble limiting myself to 3 or 4 items (fortunately they rarely charge you for extra veggie toppings).

Usually there is a long line at lunch hour which is normal, but once you are at the front of the line, you have to scream your order at employees who don't speak English well, which makes for an awkward experience. Not too big a deal but I can go down the street to Portico and get much better customer service with no misunderstood words or raised voices needed.\nToday, I went in to get a salad, and I didn't realize how large the large salads are. I thought I was ordering a small salad. No big deal, right? Wrong. The customer service brunette questioned me in a condescending tone when I asked to just get this salad put in a small container. She said, \"well you knew the size when you ordered, so you have to pay for it.\" I told her that I haven't been here in a while and didn't realize how large the large salads were, and I just want to get this large transferred into a small. I hadn't planned on paying $13, I was thinking more $8.75. Usually in this case, where the \"customer is always right\", the service gal would have said \"no problem, let me put this into a small for you.\" Not this lady. She had this super condescending tone, and refused to give me a small salad, saying she doesn't want to \"throw the food away.\" I should have put the salad down right there, and walked out. But I paid for my salad and left. I will never go back. I don't want to see that service lady. I can still hear her condescending and rude tone of voice.

My coworkers and I came on a Friday afternoon around 12:30ish and the place was surprisingly not too packed. We waited for about 5-10 minutes before it was our turn to order our salads. I like the fact that you can totally customize your salad, with your choice of size, greens, toppings, meats, and dressing. I would recommend the small salad because the large is pretty big and filling. Each salad comes with 3 toppings, but I think they are a bit stingy with the toppings. Most of the time, I felt like I was just eating the greens... I also ordered the spicy chicken with my salad, but it was kind of dry. Next time, I will probably just stick with veggies. The lady who made my salad accidentally gave me the large size instead of the small, and I didn't notice until after I paid.. so I pretty much just had enough appetite to eat half of it, leaving the other half to go to waste. \n\nThe best part of the meal was the FOCACCIA BREAD (of course).

Even the veggies are greasy and oily, yuck. Sandwiches, they offer lots of choice, which is great for the variety score, but I find their ratio of meat to bread kind of low. You really got to go double meat to get it to where I like it, then it's a $13 sandwich! Salads are fine and anyone who walks by anytime after noon will tell you that the line is absurdly long.\nVariety: tons of options, subs, custom salads, pre-made salads, cookies, and hot entree bar. It's not for lack of options\nValue: everything is expensive! As stated above, sandwiches are expensive unless you aren't that hungry. Entrees are expensive and the salads can get expensive.  It's prime location so I get it, according to their own signs, food theft is an issue to maybe the pricing accounts for shrinkage.\nOverall: like I said, I want to like focaccia. But in all fairness, create a system to avoid bias and you see where each places rate based on your factors. Sadly this is it...", "author": "Aldo K."}

However I never actually get in line for the hot-food items since they are always SOOO long. Not to mention the premade salads are awesome - particularly the Pear & Goat Cheese - so it is hard to justify the wait. It is really convenient that there are two check outs so that you can get in and out if you are just grabbing something.\n\nOne of these days I will go early enough to actually get real food because I have heard everything is delicious, if a little pricy.", "author": "Emmy L."}

I have yet to try a salad or sandwich here because the lines are always long, but their hot bar is pretty good and the line is short or nonexistent.  Standard for me is 1/2 chicken with two sides - it's about $9 and is enough for lunch and dinner.  When I've gone their steamed vegetables have been consistently a little understeamed, but I eat early, so maybe they're just trying to accommodate the veggies sitting out in the hot tray.  Bread is free, which is both amazing and dangerous.  I totally didn't realize it was free the first time I went.", "author": "KT R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-07", "description": "I absolutely love Focaccia--my new favorite place for a quick lunch in SF! So far, I have only ordered sandwiches--the bread is fresh and the sandwiches are nicely toasted. These sandwiches are huge, so they can easily be split between 2 people. At 6.95 per sandwich (and 1/2 sandwiches are also available) this place is less expensive (and 1000 times better) than the cafeteria provided on site at my work. All sandwiches are made to order, and my favorite combination so far has been the prosciutto with fresh mozzarella and the pesto mayonnaise on the wheat focaccia bread. The cookies are also delicious! Haven't had the salad there but will have to try it soon. All the ingredients are fresh and the portions are generous. If you haven't checked this place out soon, you should! It's SOOO good!", "author": "Amanda S."}

They make salads and sandwiches to order at reasonable prices.  The only problem is that everyone seems to know about this place even though it only opened recently so the lines are pretty long during peek lunch hours.  There is the option of getting a pre-made salads though and some of those are pretty good too.  They also have hot food with different options daily and there's usually no line for that for some reason even though the food is pretty good (although generally less healthy/light than the salad).  One thing though - despite their name, their focaccia is not so great.  I mean it's free so you can't complain but it needs some salt or rosemary or something.  (They also misspelled ciabatta on their menu, which I find annoying.)", "author": "barbara b."}

Guy who made my salad didn't know almonds from walnuts. Guy who made my sandwich didn't know what pastrami was. I had to point it out to them in both cases.

All (but one) of the other MANY times olives are pit-less, but this is the second time I bit into a pit unexpectedly, ouch (says my tooth).  The first time this happened I spoke to the manager about this, and she said that they got the wrong delivery - olives with pits -  and they were just using them up.  However, there is never any warning that your usual salad w/out pits now has them (some even fall out of the olive itself and appear randomly after biting into what seems like just a clump of lettuce.  NOT GOOD.  I had asked if they would put a label on the salad \"olives contain pits\" so the customers who regularly buy the salad expecting no pits could be prepared, but apparently my suggestion was lost.  \nI still love this place but am only giving 2 stars this time because of what seems to be lack of quality control and caring.", "author": "gail c."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-05-08", "description": "People at work had good things to say about focaccia but I'd never tried it. It's set away from the street, so I could never even FIND it. But yesterday I did, and I went in. You stand in line for either a sandwich or a salad, or you can get premade ones from the wall. The food seems to be of very good quality. I had a whole wheat bread, sun dried tomato spread, brie and chicken breast sandwich with cucumbers, lettuce and tomato for under $8. About par for the financial district, but of course too pricey for me to eat every day. LUCKILY, the sandwiches are good size and filling, and since I've had a small appetite lately, half served me for a meal, bringing the price down to under $4! You can also buy just half a sandwich but it ends up being $5 something, so buying a whole and saving the other half is cheaper. Here's the bad thing about this place - it's SLOW. I came in after 1:30, well after the rush. The premade stuff was all gone, so I went to the sandwich line. There were only 2 or 3 people in front of me, but it took FOREVER. So slow. A long line began to form behind me. The salad line was also long. Once I gave my sandwich preferences, he offered to toast it, so I said sure. Kinda a big mistake. It was tasty toasted, but it once again took forever. Other people's sandwiches went in and out of the oven, and mine still was toasting. The shift changed, the new guy checked my sandwich and left it toasting. There were a bunch of us now waiting for our toasted sandwiches. Pretty much it took up about all of my 30 min lunch break to get my sandwich, leaving me little time to eat it. Imagine if i'd come during the lunch rush!! it must take an unimaginable time! Still, if you have plenty of time, but don't want a sit down place, come here. It tasted good, there's so many choices and combinations, it won't get boring, although sometimes I like to see what combos the chefs come up with instead of making up my own. A-Ok. Ps, some people wrote the workers here are rude. They were neither rude nor friendly, just neutral, which is fine with me.", "author": "Merredith L."}

I used to come here all the time because it was close to my old office.  I was so excited to have a focaccia sandwich.  I always used to get a veggie sandwich on whole wheat bread with brie and lots of veggies.  I was there early and there was no one else in line.  The sandwich guy clearly saw me, but still made me wait over 5 minutes before even acknowledging my presence.  He did not say hello.  He did not ask me what I wanted.  Instead he stared at me and just sort of nodded his head.  I asked for a veggie sandwich with brie.  He said, no brie.  I said ok, how about muenster and provolone.  He didn't say a word, but he rolled his eyes several times at me.  I have no idea why.  He seemed annoyed at everything I asked for.  I had forgotten to ask for balsamic, so I asked to add it after he'd put the veggies on.  This really annoyed him.  When he was finished making my sandwich, he sort of threw it on the counter.  I asked him his name.  He said it was Luis.  Then when I went to pay, he'd charged me for a regular sandwich with extra cheese, even though I had no meat.  They never used to do that!  I wish I'd chosen to go to Oasis around the corner instead.  Even when I haven't been there in years, Mohammed still recognizes me and remembers my order.

I will have to take a break for like a week at a time, as I get soooooo infuriated.  But, I always go back and will just wait for a different salad prep girl.  Have you had this problem?
