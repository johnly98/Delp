Now that is my new default order. The salted butter caramel was good too. This shop rotates flavors-creations with descriptive names, and you may sample before purchase. You could also vote your preferences on a chalkboard, so it's whimsical as well.\n\nThis is a bright and clean small shop; the decor and color scheme is pretty simple. The gelato is complex, however, and is so good that my colleagues and I stop by whenever we lunch at nearby HRD (https://www.yelp.com/biz/hrd-san-francisco-4). The prices are relatively low compared to the fancy ice cream shops that dot the City.\n\nNote they have a frequent visitor stamp card. Each purchase gets a stamped and after 9 stamps you get a freebie. Also, a yelp check-in gets you a small cone and flavor of the week.", "author": "Peter L."}

The ice cream shop is on a random street in SoMa, and parking can be sometimes difficult, even though some spots are available right up front. \n\nThey have an assortment of flavors, including seasonal ones like pumpkin, and they're apparently known for their pistachio. That day, I went for the daily special of hazelnut latte, which literally tasted like coffee and Nutella in gelato form! I also tried their peach gelato, and it tasted just like a fresh peach. \n\nI definitely see myself coming back pretty often!

After visiting I now know why - this place is super popular and will have a line out the door! A lot of the customers are from offices in the area. \n\nI highly recommend getting the waffle cone. It's only $5 and you get two scoops of gelato. The two scoops of ice cream in a cup is also $5 and (between you and me) I think you get less gelato in the cup than in a cone. \n\nI tried the tiramisu and the pistachio flavors. Both were some of the best gelato I've ever had (and I've been to Italy!) The gelato was very fresh and high quality. It tasted smooth and creamy. the pistachio was a faint yellow color which is really different from the artificial green colors grocery stores might sell. \n\nYou can also buy a pint of ice cream from their fridge!

After eating my weight in gelato on my North to South Italy trip in 2017, I must say Coletta definitely stands up to the best gelatos I've tried overseas.\n\nA small, simple shop with classic and high-quality flavors. I opted for the Mint and Chocolate gelato, Mint as a refresh and the Chocolate to see how rich and decadent it was. Plus Mint Chocolate is always a promising combination. The mint tasted great, pure mint flavor, lightly mentholated and tasted great in contrast to the Chocolate. The Chocolate was incredibly rich, lovely roasted flavor with much depth. The flavors were high-quality, with no artifical subtleties what so ever. No bizarre food coloring for the mint. The texture was on point with the signature gelato texture and creaminess. Yummy sugar cone, but the gelato at Coletta is definitely the star here.\n\nDefinitely a must try if you're in the area looking for a sweet treat!

He suggested picking any flavor from the menu and was sure I was gonna love it. Taking his word for it, I got the medium sized cup that comes with 2 scoops of ice cream - Pistachio and Chocolate Hazelnut. \n\nThe price was a little on the higher side but the ice cream was really creamy and left me feeling refreshed on a rare warm San Francisco afternoon. \n\nMaybe my method of judging an ice cream parlor needs changing where in I try the chocolate flavor everywhere and pick my favorites.

Came back another time with some friends and got to try some. The gelato is very smooth, normally when I get gelato it's quite dense like the one from Marco Polo. \n\nThe flavors the day I went seemed pretty average but the flavors were intense. The passion fruit was sour and I loved it. We ended up getting the mint chocolate and the mint flavor really cuts through. It was like sucking on a mint leaf, it lingered for awhile kind of like when you get a mint. It was refreshing. I hope the next time I come back they have the black sesame. \n\nNearby the door there's a black board with a bunch of flavors and customers get to put a mark next to the flavors they want so hopefully I can get that black sesame flavor next time I'm in the city.", "author": "Andrew T."}

It's difficult stateside establishments to get gelato right.

I had to battle traffic coming from North Beach to get here and was praying those flavors would be available. I'm one lucky girl the store was open on a weekend and they had my flavors!

It was magical! I actually was going to get another cup or cone but the husband stopped me. I told him gelato is healthier than any other ice cream I eat hahah but I lost the battle.\n\nI'm glad I was able to stop by today!

I wanted to believe Coletta Gelato is the last ice cream shop in SF, but Xanath is still a big hit with its original taste of vanilla.

I usually thought the line was big; however, I came here even later with just one or few customers in line.

My wife & I had our wedding last week and when we were planning, we did NOT want the traditional cake. We witnessed it too many times--- cakes cut late in the evening when half the guests have already departed, only for the serving staff to collect and waste it all! We said no thanks to waste and no thanks to cake cutting fee. We wanted something delicious, would not go to waste and fit a summer time wedding and gelato was the perfect answer! We worked with Noah from the beginning and throughout (but sadly did not even get to meet the Gelato Man himself) and he was professional, prompt with his responses and provided very delicious gelato! \n\nNoah was very punctual with his arrival to our wedding. We ordered 3 cool boxes, which totaled 300 mini-servings for 185 people, not including our vendors. They also have a cruiser which serves I think 400 mini-servings. We had some leftovers, but mainly because our guests were too polite to get up during toasts. After the toasts, the lines were non-stop! Everyone raved about the gelato! We had dark chocolate mousse, strawberry sorberto, pistachio, black sesame, Irish cream and banana coco rum-- YUM!! I'm not a huge fan of overly sweet desserts and the ones I was able to try (chocolate, strawberry, pistachio and Irish cream) were the right amount of sweetness for me-- you can actually taste more than just sweet! The pistachio was also very unique because it really tastes like you're eating an actual pistachio!! Why are you still reading this--- head over and try a scoop or 2 (or more- highly encourage), buy a pint (also recommended) and take home or cater them at your wedding/event (also highly recommend)!", "author": "Danny T."}

The area nearby is not the cleanest/safest, but you can't miss it due to the adorable gelato mural outside. The interior is decorated extremely well, not unlike a very hipster, millennial coffee shop. The space is pretty small, but it's definitely utilized well--it has window seating, a table, a few bookshelves, etc.\n\nThe gelato here is ridiculously velvety; this might be my new favorite gelato shop in the whole Bay Area. It's delicious, rich, and bursting with flavor! \n\nWhat I Ordered:\n\n-one scoop of Gianduia (Hazelnut + Chocolate) and one scoop of Pistachio gelato (5/5): Holy wow, this was amazing. These flavors were both very intense, and I actually usually prefer fruity ice cream/gelato flavors, but the intensity wasn't overwhelming to my tongue. The gianduia reminded me of Ferrero Rocher, which is definitely not a bad thing, and the pistachio flavor was strong/nutty but not too sweet which was very appreciated.\n\nI also want to take a second to commend the service here--in front of us was this giant group of two families combined, with a few screaming children, some moody teenagers, and two sets of tired parents. The worker that day (the owner?) took them on with a smile and a lot of patience, giving them as many samples and recommendations as they asked for. They also changed their minds a lot LOL and he didn't seem to mind one bit! It literally took 15 minutes to get through their order, but he moved on to me and my boyfriend right away with no hint of frustration or tiredness whatsoever. It was super impressive to witness! \n\nAll in all, I will definitely be coming back here--sometimes, I feel like SoMa is sorely lacking in good dessert places and this spot has filled a hole in my heart.

It's not as common in the SF Bay Area, but given all the 5 star reviews of Coletta Gelato I was looking forward to giving it a try.\n\nOn a Saturday around 730PM, we were the only customers i.e. no line :) The scooper was really nice and said we could try as many flavors as we wanted. I would usually oblige especially since it was our first visit but I felt bad and stopped after trying 50% of all the flavors. My favorites were Pistachio, Gianduia (chocolate and hazelnut), and Peanut Butter. The quality, flavor and texture were amazing; it brought back fond memories of the best gelato we recently had in Rome.\n\nLike most gelaterias in Rome, they don't charge extra for cones. Two flavor max for a small/piccolo ($5) in a cup or sugar cone, three flavors for a large/grande ($7) in a cup or waffle cone. The difference in cone, we were told, is because the sugar cone doesn't support the weight very well of a large serving. They also sell pints ($10).\n\nWhile not located in an area I usually frequent in SF, Coletta Gelato is definitely worth the trek.", "author": "Lindsey C."}

Plus the employees are friendly and parking isn't terrible (ok it's metered parking that can get tough but we got lucky and snagged a spot right around the corner). The store itself has a bench and 2 tables with a few seats.\n\nFor my picks I got the Fior di Latte & the Gianduia. The gelato had the perfect texture. They were both thick and luxurious but somehow not heavy at all. They were silky and creamy but also didn't melt immediately. Both flavors had the right amount of sweetness and all the ingredients came through very cleanly. The Fior di Latte let the milk itself shine through and it complemented the Gianduia well. The Gianduia is basically like a better Nutella and it had tiny wafer-like crisps throughout.\n\nOverall I really love a gelato shop that can get everything done just right.

There's actually even a small chalkboard near the door where you can vote for the next flavor to rotate in, one getting the most votes showing up the next day. \n\nI got the CA Pistachio with Maldon sea salt, Almost Chai, and CA Almond and was pleased with all three of them. The gelato here is done quite well, perfect to taste, not too overpowering in sugar/flavor, and quite the delight to consume. That being said, you really can't go wrong with any flavor.

I had, had 3 samples already and there were 2 people in line. So I decided to get Pistachio, even without sampling it. How daring! No seriously, pistachio  flavored ice creams/gelatos do vary greatly in taste and execution and can have an artificial off-putting flavor. \n\nI am so glad that I got the $5 small scoop of Gianduia and pistachio! Colette Gelato doesn't play around with artificial flavoring. The pistachio gelato had a concentrated nuttiness and I felt like I was unshelling and eating a handful of pistachios.

To think I was almost not going to get this flavor. \n\nBoy the Gianduia is out of this world!! It tasted like the rich inside of a Ferro Roche.

The Gianduia has an amazing flavor and texture profile!\n\nColetta's gelatos are rich, smooth, and creamy.

They have 3 different cup sizes which were all fairly small, definitely not the cold stone cup sizes. So I was expecting a small quantity, but man was I wrong! They kind of stack up the ice cream so you actually get a good amount even when the cup is fairly small. Now the ice cream, I got the hazelnut and hazelnut chocolate, both like nutella and yet theres a difference. The ice cream was so smooth and soft it almost feels like as if its not ice cream, except it is. we also got the mango and strawberry sorbet. both tasted as if there were made from real ripe fruit. I would definitely go back again for after dinner dessert and I would definitely recommend to anyone looking for good quality and quantity ice cream.", "author": "Nina Y."}

They are making their own Fior di Latte as a gelato base. Mint chip stracciatella is very good.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the sorbets taste like gelato due to their creaminess.

My friend and I visited one weekday afternoon to try the gelato here. Fellow Yelper Madeleine M. had recommended this place as she knew I was staying in FiDi. Was this code for \"Bring me back a pint when I see you next?\" Even if it wasn't, we did: Two pints, grapefruit and Gianduia. \n\nI have to credit Noah for his superfantabulous service during our visit. We were curious and he answered all of our questions and allowed us to sample the flavors. We elected to try grapefruit and tiramisu, and purchased two pints of Gianduia and one pint of Grapefruit to-go.  I want to especially recognize Noah for his willingness to hand-pack a pint of grapefruit for us on the spot. On a recent visit to Bi-Rite Creamery in the Mission, I was mortified to see one of the workers berate my companion for asking for a quart of earl grey ice cream. After that experience, I was prepared for Noah to say no, but he happily obliged and even asked if we wanted a ribbon and heart-shaped sticker! \n\nKudos to Noah for making this high-quality product the treat it is, from hello to nom! I finished a pint in a day. It truly is as displayed in the glass mason jar-layers of dark chocolate and gelato. The consistency is consistent throughout the pint, as Noah described. \n\nOverall, 5 stars and can't wait to return!", "author": "Jen B."}

A great summer flavor for sure.\n\nGianduia: Tastes like you think it would...a cold ferrero rocher. I guess I'm not a nutella fan like everyone else, so take this flavor review with a pinch of salt (mmm, dark chocolate sea salt).\n\nA 3.75 for me-- it was good, but it wasn't omg amaze or anything.\n--\n\nOh Coletta, you never fail to impress. It's winter time now, but I checked out your almond, grapefruit, meyer lemon, and mango sorbetto recently. First let's talk about that texture. How do you do it? It's basically melted, but still intact. The texutre is light and doesn't make you feel gross after. The almond is light and creamy. The mango sorbetto was like eating a perfectly ripe Alphonso mango. The lemon had the perfect amount of zest. The grapefruit captured all the nice things about grapefruit. I'll be back! 4/5.\n\n--\nAnd Coletta does it again! I came back for the black sesame and caramel. A tad sweet for my tastes, but the sesame is rich and nutty, while the caramel is sweet and soft. They play well with each other. I'm a fan. Erm, I think it'd be bad to say I came back yet again, but I got the pistachio and cinammon. The pistachio was nutty and smooth. Not really my thing, but I'm not a big pistachio person. The cinammon reminded me a sugary cinnamon toast crunch-- less focus on the aroma. I preferred the lemon and mango! Tumeric had a slight herby taste to it and wasn't too sweet. Unique, but not quite my thing. Anddd back at it. Saffron was almost a bit...(to my untrained saffron tastes), plasticky but pleasant, would be the best way to describe it. As in, I liked it, but it reminded me of that in an odd way. My Persian friend who tried it said there was too much saffron, which can't be bad, right? 4/5.

And surprisingly, the coconut cookie was the best coconut flavored frozen dessert I've ever had! \nThe coconut was not heavy or overwhelming, it was refreshing and perfectly complemented with bits of crumbly shortbread cookie.  Moreover the waffle cone was excellent.\n\nThe only reason I can't give Coletta 5 stars is because of the price and inconsistency in portion size.  Scoops were $5 for a piccolo (2 flavors) and $7 for a grande (3 flavors), which is quite pricey ($4.50 or $4.75 would have seemed more reasonable in my book).  But the bigger issue was that the customer in front of us ordered a piccolo and got two hefty scoops from one server, then my boyfriend ordered a piccolo from the other server and received significantly less gelato.  The other customer received about 150% more gelato than he did, which left him very grumpy just based on principle.  I, on the other hand, ordered a piccolo in a cone instead of cup, and was served a more generous serving of gelato.\n\nAll in all, Coletta is a must-go if you want delicious gelato.

We catered Coletta at our wedding this past Saturday and since the moment we emailed Noah for a quote all the way to the end of our wedding reception, Noah has been nothing been accommodating, professional, kind, and awesome! This is what customer service is. I think it has already been established hands down how amazing Coletta's gelato is - but having them at our wedding only revealed how 10/10 their customer service is as well. \n\nThey offer different packages when you request for their catering services. At first we decided to go with 4 flavors and half-scoops for each guest due to our limited dessert budget. But because my husband's sister loves Coletta - she offered to sponsor a larger 8 flavor package - and that is where we were all the more amazed how the Coletta team is. We wanted a flavor with pineapple in it because my sister-in-law loves pineapples - and requested if they can create an entirely new flavor Dole Whip. Noah responded a couple days later and said they had looked into recipes and would introduce it at our wedding! WOWZERS! What I further love about them is that they had decided not to bring Dole Whip because the pineapples they received weren't ripe - talk about quality control. Instead they brought my second choice Banana Speculoos which I ended up LOVING!\n\nColetta is AMAZING. All our guests both who know of and love Coletta as well as those who had their gelato for the first time all LOVED them! We wouldn't have wanted our wedding any other way - Coletta made it extra extra extra special! Thank you Noah and Antonio and the Coletta team for your amazing service! We can't wait for our wedding pictures to come out for some official pictures with the gelato carts, Noah, and Antonio! \n\nWe would recommend catering Coletta for ANY event! They are professional, flexible, understanding, accommodating, and caring throughout the whole process!", "author": "Heidi T."}

Now it's one of our go-to spots!\n\nThey switch up their flavors every day, and they allow you to try samples, which is always a plus. In the times that I've visited they've also had sorbets in case you were in the mood for something fruitier. You can't go wrong with either one.\n\nIt's also a must to try their gelato with their cones. They aren't ever stale or artificial, and are packed with freshness and flavor. They also give generous scoops of gelato regardless if you get a cone or a cup, so you definitely get what you pay for which is *rare* when it comes to trendy SF food spots.\n\nI've tried several gelato spots before, and this one is definitely ranked in my top 3!", "author": "Josephine L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-16", "description": "Excited that this little gem opened up in SOMA, but there's not a lot of foot traffic in this area, so hopefully it's getting enough business. The flavors change up all the time which is great for commitment-phobes, but it sucks when you find a flavor you love and it's gone the next day or week (melon gelato come back!!!)\n\nThe main win here - the texture. There's no icy bits to dilute the flavor or change the consistency. I'm usually not a fan of sorbet because of the ice, but this gelato is creamy and smooth without being so milky that it resembles ice cream. I have yet to be bold and daring and try out all the flavors, but notably, here are my thoughts on the following:\n\nPistachio 4/5: super super pistachio-y, more so than the average pistachio flavored frozen treat. I'm not as into it, but if intense flavor is what you love, then go for this.\n\nHazelnut 4/5: It's like eating a cold creamy ferrero rocher, a good balance of chocolate-y taste without being too rich.\n\nMelon 5/5: Really velvety texture, likely because it's fruity and not creamy, but not a chunky or seed filled fruit. Definitely my favorite here. \n\nStrawberry 5/5: potent fruit flavors are my jam which is why I loved this rich almost-strawberry-shortcake-esque flavor. Super refreshing and light, almost like drinking a smoothie but in gelato form.", "author": "Kathy T."}

With so many ice cream options in SF (Garden Creamery, Mr. Mrs. Misc., Bi-Rite, etc), I feel like the only reason for their popularity is the sheer absence of any other dessert places within a one mile radius, as well as their hipster decor.", "author": "Kazu O."}

The unassuming small storefront and plain-looking interior of the store don't do justice to the great gelato served here and I know my gelato, having lived in Italy for over 6 months!  This one was exactly like the one I had in Italy.  I had strawberry and pistachio ice cream.

I had a hard time trying to decided between all the flavors after getting samples as they all tastes like what they should be. I finally settled on a cup of with pistachio and saffron gelato for $5.

There surprisingly aren't many gelato places in the FIDI area, so it was definitely a welcome treat to see Coletta open a few blocks from my place.\n\nThe staff was super nice and I was able to be a pig and sample many different flavors before settling on Gianduia (Chocolate Hazelnut) and Pistachio while my GF got the Fier de latte. The Gianduia and Pistachio were super smooth and creamy, but just a bit too rich for my taste. The Fier de latte however had the perfect blend of sweetness to go along with the same smooth, creamy texture. I believe they have different flavors everyday, so I will definitely come back and try other flavors or settle for the Flier de latte.\n\nThere is also a board by the door where customers can write down flavors you would like to see in the future.

Adjectives like soft and creamy come to mind.\n\nFlavors were strong yet not overpowering. Sweetness was at the appropriate level and didn't leave a \"first ingredient was sugar vibe\".\n\nGiandula was great, tasted like the inner of a Ferro Rocher and had some what appeared to be wafer pieces that were a nice textual surprise. \n\nPeanut Butter and Dark Chocolate tasted like a more complex less sugary Reese's. \n\nStrawberry tasted fresh and real.

Walking in it's a cute little gelato place that is a great pit stop after a long day. There was multiple choices of flavors that they let you try.

I wish the shop were a bit bigger though as it tends to get crowded. They had beautiful flavours though I found myself missing a deep intense chocolate and a clean and simple vanilla bean flavor on their menu. The mango one was simply superb.\n\nThe strawberry, pistachio, and fiora de latte were delicious but a bit TOO SWEET. \n\nCan't wait to come back and try some more flavors!", "author": "Yelper 2."}

I have been in Italy, I'm married to a born and raised Italian man, and I am here to tell you how GOOD and AUTHENTIC this gelato is. I don't know if any other place in the SF Bay Area with gelato this good. Give it a try, I find it hard to believe you'll be disappointed. I met one of the owners briefly and he mentioned how they trained in Italy (Bologna) how to learn how make authentic gelato. Go try it!! Amazingly good:) and small shop local guys.", "author": "Maria B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-03", "description": "Coletta is the best! The owners are passionate about their gelato and it really comes through in how they explain the flavors. You can tell they are really proud of it. And they should be! It's the creamiest gelato I've had. We are very excited to have a new hit place in Soma and no longer need to go to Birite/Humphrey etc....my hubby is more of an ice cream fan for the creaminess and I am more of a gelato fan for the lighter texture...but this satisfied both of us and the flavors were over the top. The Giaduia is extra special with a little hint of crispiness blended with the creaminess. All of the flavors we tried were amazing and I only regret that we can't go everyday because we need our pants to fit! I also love the freshness, they only have about 8 flavors. I like this much better than typical gelato where they have dozens of flavors and it is overwhelming. They focus on a few things and doing them very well. Looking forward to going back next weekend!", "author": "Katelyn W."}
