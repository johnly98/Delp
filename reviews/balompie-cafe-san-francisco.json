Simply yummy, filling, down-home comfort food.\n\nService is fast, friendly, and proactive, and it was reassuring to see that 90% of the patrons when I stopped by weren't gringos - a sign of authenticity.

The fried plantains were tasty, the pickled coleslaw added some crunch, and a smooth red salsa just the right amount of heat.\n\nPlenty of vegetarian friendly options too.

For me, cheese is always worth it. \n\nThe wait was kind of long though. We ordered 3 pupusas in a half-filled restaurant and it probably took 30 minutes? I will note that pupusas are hand-shaped and crafted, and made to order.. it takes a while to heat up both sides on the grill (they're not really a fast food like pancakes) - and I'm sure the grill only can make a certain number at a time, so if it was REALLY busy, I imagine the wait can be reeealllyyy lonnggggg. :/\n\nOverall, the restaurant is clean, the wait staff here is super nice and attentive (smiles all around!) and I'd definitely return and recommend!", "author": "Emily C."}

I've been to Balompie #3 in Bernal Heights and this one and they're both awesome! Delicious, affordable, and there are so many papusas to choose from! \n\nPupusas are still relatively new to me. I've had a homemade one and have only tried them at a handful of restaurants, but the ones at Balompie are the best ones I've had! I've had the shrimp and cheese, pork, jalepeno, and cheese, and fish and cheese, and they're all flavorful, generous with ingredients, and perfectly cooked. Topped off with the traditional pickled cabbage and salsa, it was a refreshing mix of flavors. Two is the perfect amount for me if you're looking for a light dinner. The standard filling papusas are $2.50, while the specialty ones (which are the ones I got) are $3.50. I like how you can mix and match because I could never choose just one! Shrimp and cheese is my favorite though! \n\nI've had a plate of two enchiladas here as well and a side of rice and fried plantains to share. The enchilada is like a super-fried papusa instead of a tortilla-type wrap, topped with lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream and shredded pork. The crunch adds an unexpected twist, but it's absolutely delicious! Kind of like a mini plate of nachos, consolidated all onto one giant chip. \n\nBalompie has been featured numerous times in 7x7's Big Eat List, so you don't need me to tell you that they're super yummerz.

Hot melty cheese, slightly crispy, and golden yellow. \n\nIt was also wonderful to start off our meal with a complementary side salad and Curtido (Salvadorian cabbage salad). It can be compared to Kimchee except not nearly as fermented, and really delicious especially for my Nepali palate that appreciates the salty, sour, and hot combination. Papusas were also great with a touch of their salsa. \n\nFor our main meal, we ordered the beef steak with onions. So many countries have their own version of this.

We have been trying to go to this restaurant for months now, but it was always crowded. We assumed it must be that good. Alas, our experience there wasn't even Luke warm. \n\nWe ordered pupusas; my parents got the traditional corn masa and I got (I think) the rice masa. My initial reaction was the pupusas were mushy. They had very little depth in flavor and the revueltas had very little pork, but a lot of cheese. I had one that had the zucchini squash, but there was too much ajo (garlic) and again, very little ingredients except the cheese. The pupusas again, mushy and could have used more flavor.\n\nI'm sure the other food might be tasty, like the pl\u00e1tanos fritos (which by the way for the amount they give you is a little overpriced). The thing that makes this a two star review was the service. We didn't get a good amount of service. The waiters did not check up on us, but were at the beck and call of the techies coming in. They received better service than most of the Latinos that were there. I'll probably get chastised for say that, but I'm a very observant person and a pretty big foodie. If the quality of the service is only customer for a certain group of people, then the quality of the food is probably not that great. \n\nIt's a trend I see in the Mission District; restaurants are dumping their traditional forms of cooking to please a group of people now occupying it. It's a little disappointing. \n\nLet me again highlight why this place wasn't that great:\n- Mushy pupusas \n- Ingredients lacked flavor\n- The mixed pupusas didn't have enough ingredients other than cheese. \n- The service was lack luster and catered to a specific group of people. \n\nI'll try the other Balompie location and see what's up.

The wait staff keeps blaming us and saying we didn't order hers with the rest? Excuse me? We did. And English is spoken well here so that's not the problem.

I went there this past weekend with my family and boy was it a HORRIBLE experience!  I wanted to take my sister there because she had never been. So we were supposed to be second on the list, but somehow everyone else got seated before us.  So half an hour later, we get seated, fine.  We waited about 10 minutes she took our order. Then we waited, and waited AND WAITED!!! I looked around, everyone else that sat after us were enjoying their beverages, we still hadn't even been served water. A nice anglo family got seated next to us and low and behold...they got water with fresh ice right away...as we were slowly dehydrating in our seats.  So another couple minutes later, I look back at a table that got seated after us and they were eating.  My blood was starting to boil, they still hadn't even given us water. My fiance' had to ask them for water and the waitress said, oh that's not my table. Really?!?!?!?! you can't just give us some water?!?!?!  Mind you we were sitting directly across from the water station....how hard would it have been to just give us some water?  My fiance' had to leave because we was gonna loose his cool. We staid another couple of minutes and I couldn't take it anymore, we got up and walked out. I hope the waitress had to eat the bill we left.\n\nVERY VERY SAD!!!!!\n\nWe have been long time customers and to be treated with such horrible customer service is a disgrace!

I love the deep fried yuca and the orchata. However, there are a few things that really, really got to me during my last visit.\n\n1. The floors are always FILTHY. The first time I was here, there was some sort of brownish goop under the table that was right in my line of vision. I mean, I live in the Tenderloin, so I see feces all the time. I knew it wasn't feces. I kept telling myself that it was probably smushed pupusa and not to be so disgusted, but it didn't work. There were bits of food and dirt under every table. I really don't mind hole in the wall spots that have dingy walls and beat up furniture (Did you see the part where I said I live in the Tenderloin?), but to have a dirty floor was a little too much for me. \n\n2. The tables are way too close together! Normally, I drape my purse on the back of my chair. You can't do that here. I had to eat with my purse in my lap because of course I wouldn't put it on the floor. (See above.)  The lady sitting directly behind me had full, curly hair and whenever she would laugh or adjust herself, I could feel her hair brush up on my neck. It was really annoying.\n\n3. Boyfriend and I were seated immediately, but it took them 20 minutes to give us a menu. That's just unacceptable. After the server took our order, it took another 40-50 minutes just to get our food. People who ordered before us (and were ordering SECONDS) got their food before we got our order. I also find this unacceptable. I was about to walk out. The server did not check in on us once, even though I kept looking at her to try to signal her over. It wasn't until I raised my hand that she came to help us. What made me the most mad is that I saw her give the table next to me such prompt and attentive service.

We were in the mood for papusas and this place came highly recommended by a local. I've never had El Salvadorean cuisine before, but this stuff was bomb.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste -- \n Four of us decided to split a few papusas so we could try some of each. The only really memorable one was the Mexicana Y Queso (ground pork, jalapeno, and cheese). The others were just fried, cheesy goodness that we eagerly smothered in pickled cabbage and smoky salsa. My friend ordered a horchata, but it was more powdery than we are accustomed to. Apparently, that's how El Salvadorean horchata differs from Mexican horchata (This is what I was told...not sure if this is factual) but I was not a fan.  We also ordered the Tamal De Elote Con Crema (sweet corn tamales) and the Pasteles de Pollo which resembled a fried dumpling stuffed with savory chicken. The corn taste of the tamales was very subtle and it may have been my favorite dish of the night. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nThe papusas were $2.50 while the specialty papusas were $3.50. We were stopping in for more of a snack than actual dinner so having one papusa each was enough to satisfy us. However, if we were actually really hungry, we could have easily eaten 3-4 papusas each. Not bad pricing for SF, but the portions didn't really justify the cost.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThe waitresses were really friendly. The food came quickly. No complaints on this front.\n\nBonus Star because I would definitely come back if I'm in the area and craving a snack. There were a few papusas on the menu that I would still like to try.", "author": "Abby W."}

We ordered the pork/cheese and shrimp/cheese pupusas, and they were both spectacular.  I really enjoyed the shrimp ones since I had never had seafood in a pupusa before, so it was a really cool and new flavor combination for me.  I also thought that the pork pupusas were particularly savory.  I don't think that you really can go wrong with any of their choices.  I recommend taking a look at their specialty pupusas since they had a pretty interesting selection.  \n\nWe also ordered the platanos (fried plantains), which I could have done without, but my fiance loved them.  The only negative thing about our experience is that when they asked us if we wanted sour cream with the platanos, we said yes, unaware that it would come at a fairly hefty extra cost (for sour cream, that is).  I wish it had been more clear in the questioning, but I was still incredibly satisfied with my experience here hence the 5 stars!\n\nOverall, if you are looking for some authentic food in the Mission at a cheap price, come here.

I heart it for the great food, the great prices, the chill, no-nonsense-ness of it all.  It's great.\n\nI've been coming here for a few years now, thanks to a recommendation several years ago from a fellow SF native (Avenues Represent!).  I came here to try the pupusas that one magical day several years ago, and I've been happy with Balompie's ever since.  \n\nAnd I think other people are starting to catch on too. I noticed that Balompie is starting to make it onto all those \"Best of. . .\" lists, which is kinda annoying.  I mean, you can never keep awesome things a secret for very long.\n\nBut I suppose it's okay because I think good food really makes people happier, and even better than just good food is paying little money for good food.  People are all over that!  \n\nAnd this stuff is both cheap + DELICIOUS.  Absolutely delicious!  It's like a flour (or is it corn? I'm not sure. . .) based tortilla-looking thing, stuffed full of meat, cheese, and what have you.  It is a thing of beauty.  Add some salsa and slaw on top, and it's pupusa heaven.  Balompie's does it better than every other place I've tried.  El Zocalo's, another popular pupuseria, is okay.  Balompie's really is best.  Their pupusas are hearty, the bread-ish part is soft and cute, the inside is hearty, flavorful, packed with good stuff.  It's a nice portion too; two of these will make you nicely full.  \n\nAnd the best part?  Incredibly affordable.  If you do take-out, it's like $1.95 each.  If you get two, with tax, it'll come out to $4.27.  Isn't that INSANE?  Under 5 bucks for a very delicious meal.  Worth it.  Talk about bang for your buck.\n\nYou know, everyone loves the burritos in the Mission, and I certainly do too.  But there are also many days where I'll take a pupusa over a burrito.  But not just any pupusa.  A Balomie pupusa.  \n\nPut that on your list of San Francisco must-eats.", "author": "Vivian C."}

I received an order confirmation stating that my order was confirmed, and it will be ready between 10 and 35 mins. I live about 20 or so mins away from the restaurant. I arrived at the restaurant around 7:40. I asked the person at the register about my order, and he said he never received it. He tried checking on his iPad, but it wouldn't even turn on. WHY DID I RECEIVE AN ORDER CONFIRMATION IF MY ORDER WAS NEVER ACTUALLY CONFIRMED? Instead of helping me find a solution, or even looking at the order confirmation I was trying to show him on my phone, he proceeded to help all of the other customers and ignore me. \n\nWhile I was checking my online account to see if I was charged (which I was), I received a call from Eat24 around 7:45. The person told me they couldn't get a hold of the restaurant after repeated attempts. I was already at the restaurant at this point... This was over 30 minutes after my order was placed. Why was I just then receiving a call about this, when I already drove all the way there? And why did I receive a confirmation of my order? \n\nI kept trying to get the guy at the restaurant to assist, but finally, I had Eat24 cancel my order with a refund, and re-placed the order with the person at the register, paying on site, because I was hungry and didn't want to look for another place to eat. That was around 7:50. You'd think that after the guy saw me trying to figure out what was going on with my order for the last 10-15 mins, he would've had the kitchen rush the order. My order didn't come out until 8:25. I think he actually forgot to give the cooks my order. I could see the kitchen from where I was sitting. The staff was not cooking anything until about 8:15. The stove was empty. FINALLY MY ORDER WAS READY. At this point, it was about an hour and 10 minutes after my initial order was placed through Eat24. Thanks for the $15 coupon that I have to use within 30 days, Eat24. The restaurant offered no discount, and their service was some of the worst I've ever come across.

Great authentic pupusas and orchatas for authentic prices. I don't want any of that overpriced fake crap that they serve in fancy schmancy Latin-food restaurants. I want the real stuff. Homemade tortillas. Homemade pupusas. Everyone speaks Spanish, and the place is packed with locals.

You may have to wait a while before being seated, but for $2.50/$3.50 per pupusa, you can't beat the price. I opted for the 2 pupusas + rice/beans combination for $8.50 with a $2.75 orchata. Salvadorean orchatas are a little different from the Mexican ones. They taste like a lighter version of chocolate milk, and they're made from morro seeds (instead of rice), cocoa, cinnamon, sesame seeds, etc. (Thanks, wikipedia!).

The chicharrones are not the kind you find in the plastic bags next to the potato chips.  They're an entirely different style than that, with chunks of pork fried to a crisp. \n\nI imagine that this must have been what the Mission District was like decades ago, before the waves of punker dive bars, techie lofts, and gourmet bistros began to crowd their way in.\n\nI want to come back and grab a few beers while I sample the menu again.", "author": "Gopal R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-03-02", "description": "It never ceases to amaze me how many different permutations of corn, cheese, beans and meat you can find in Latin American cuisine!  The size of Massachusetts, El Salvador bequeaths upon us the pupusa.  A  small disk of corn flour encasing cheese and some filling.  They are griddled fresh to order and a little cheese always seems to seep out creating a small taste of crispy goodness.  You won't find this cheese at any high end fromagerie since it is far from sophisticated, but still satisfies from the basic fatty dairy point of view.\n\nQueso con Frijoles: The only pupusa where the filling co-star actually managed to overpower the cheese.  Good in a diversified pupusa portfolio, but a bland choice if your only one.\n\nLoroco y Cheese: From the description of a native Salvadoran vegetable, the loroco seemed a lot more exciting than it really was.  The bits were so small I really only tasted cheese, especially when dipped into the salsa.\n\nCamaron y Queso: I wouldn't normally think shrimp and cheese go together and I'd be mostly right.  The shrimp seemed overcooked and the pairing just okay.  Would have been better with some garlic, butter an parsley in this pupusa.\n\nMejicana y Queso: The ground pork is really bits of pulled pork, but kind of small so the flavor gets lost amongst the cheese. There are some jalape\u00f1o bits, but doesn't really spice things up.\n\nChorizo y Queso:  Little bits of ground chorizo add a very noticeable zing to the cheese.  A tad on the greasy side, but forgivable for chorizo.\n\nCurtido: What better to join the beans in your digestive tract party than raw cabbage?  Way tastier than typical sauerkraut, this is more similar to kimchee.  I really liked the texture of delicately shredded carrots, cabbage and red onions that were still crunchy, indicating a very light pickling.  Some nice hot pepper tones without being as saucy as kimchee.  Loads of spices and herbs too!\n\nSalsa: Bring a straw.  Perhaps this is traditional, but it's still too runny and bland for my tastes.", "author": "Adam B."}

The experience of tearing into thick masa bread that came piping hot with gooey stringy cheeses oozing outward along with your choice of meat or seafood is one powerful \"wow\" factor that can't be underestimated. These pupusas do not simply stop here to make an impression after triggering a temporary paralysis of non-stop drooling. As soon as I broke off a piece of one of their specialties--mariscos y queso pupusa--my growling stomach started to seize control of my body as I quickly dipped the bread into a red salsa on the side and made sure it was accompanied by plenty of cole slaw before shoving it into my wide open mouth. The entire process cannot be repeated until I stuffed a few more spoons of refried beans and Spanish rice to make sure that my mouth was jammed packed to capacity like what you would see on the MUNI lines during those crazy commuter hours. \n\nNom nom nom...to me this was the sound of divine intervention with every component of the pupusa meshing together in my mouth. Thanks to Mika I, who declared this place as having the best pupusas in town, I had to drag my bestie David N to the Mish for a visit. When we walked in, the place was packed with people of all backgrounds with the ambiance alive and vibrantly decked out with soccer memorabilia everywhere. We sat under the flat screen TV that was showing women's soccer at the time, and we ordered the pupusas arroz y frijoles ($8.50) and crossed our fingers to hope that Mika was right. It took some time for our order to come, but along with a side dish of chunky cole slaw, my rice and beans gave a nice combination of textures to perfectly complement my choice of loroco con queso and mariscos y queso pupusa. I love the sweet scent of loroco while the other pupusa had a wonderful shrimp and fish filling that was excitable and delicious. They were both highly addictive and it made me wanna bring a big party here so everyone can sample all 17 choices of pupusas. I would love to check out their prosciutto, super veggie, and chorizo y queso in the near future.\n\nService was warm, friendly and helpful. The only complaint I have is their 55 cents surcharge on some of their pupusas for those who dine in, and for having a minimum of 2 pupusas per order. Other than that, my experience was worth 4.5 stars. This is one exciting place that I would love to come back.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Oh, yeah -- because a dinner of carbs stuffed with cheese is something I reserve for rare occasions. :)\n\nPupusas are so good, but when prepared fresh and to your specifications, they're out of this world. The pupusas at Balompie came to our table fresh, hot, firm on the outside, soft on the inside and filled with melted cheese. One was spinach and cheese and the other was ground pork and cheese. I would have loved a little more spinach in mine, but I'm OK with the idea that pupusas aren't going to be health food, no matter how much curtido you put on top. \n\nSince we didn't want to turn our evening into a total pupusa-fest, we also ordered entrees. My man had camarones in garlic sauce, and I had them in tomato sauce. The dish came with plenty of prawns. The tomato sauce was flavorful without being overpowering. The plates were heaped with rice and we also got little side salads -- with lettuce that was actually green and tomatoes that were actually red, which is kind of rare for a Latin American restaurant. \n\nThe service was friendly and prompt, and the place has a very authentic feel -- there were older Latino guys watching futbal on the television while younger diners scarfed their pupusas.

Reg are $2.50 each & special are $3.50 each so not the cheapest pupusas in town. \n\nPupusa w/ loroco - A+. Not sure what type of veggie loroco is, but it's yummy. A bit tart/bitter, it pairs so well w/ the melted, gooey cheese & grilled corn shell. \n\nPupusa w/ zucchini - A+. Not a lot of zucchini in it, but enough to offer a flavoring to the cheese & corn shell. \n\nThe cabbage slaw was delicious - shredded cabbage w/ a lite spiciness...I'm a spice-wuss & this was perfect. I topped both pupusas with all of the slaw & wanted more at the end (no, I didn't ask for more!). The red sauce (hot sauce?) is more on the jalapeno/spicy side so I only drizzled it on top of pupusa/cabbage mixture but the sauce added a different zip/hotness to the dish not gotten when eaten w/o it.\n\nI stayed away from the cut veggies brought as my waitress warned me they were \"very spicy\"...I saw the jalapeno seeds layered on top of the carrots/cauliflower/jalapeno pepper mix & said, no thank you!\n\nHorchata is made fresh there daily & it's for real. Soooo good, & I'm not usually a fan b/c it's too watery. But this was just right...a bit sweet, not overly watery or gritty. I think I had the best lunch of pupusas & horchata I've ever had! And all for under $10!\n\n$10 min for credit card charges, otherwise cash. \n\nThe restaurant obviously knows what they're doing. I used to live in the area & the place was always packed.

The beans were very unique - mixed with rice and had a crust from being on the flat top grill.  Amazing flavor.  There was a cheese cube which had the perfect salty flavor and tasted incredibly fresh.  The eggs were scrambled with veggies and the homemade tortillas were thick, hot and fresh.  I've never had tortillas quite like these...EVER.  I then checked Yelp - as I was eating - and saw all the great reviews, particularly on the pupusas.  I was stuffed, but HAD to try them, as I was not sure when I would be back in the area.  I ordered 2 pupusas and they were  FANTASTIC!  So fresh and tasty.

We are salvadoreans and we went because of the reviews.  Over all a lot of their plates look delicious but we only had pupusas and I would say the pupusas were the best choice in there of what we had with the exception of the fish pupusas.  The prices were a bit high for the quality of food.  If you like salvadorean orchata, this is not the place to have it.  Theirs tasted more like chocolate milk.  It was very dissapointing. The place is very small, some of the tables are touching.  Most likely you will be sitting next to other parties and don't plan on having an intimate conversation.  This is not a place for it.

Can people back off of burritos in general please? There's so much more to Mexican than that! I digress...\n\nYou can't have a discussion about Salvadorean places without talking about pupusas. It would be like a discussion about a Southern restaurant without talking about their fried chicken. In addition to the more traditional pupusas of cheese, pork, and/or beans, they've got specialty ones that would raise some eyebrows in the old country. Spinach, mushroom, carrot and cheese? Whatever. I stay traditional. Never disappointed. I recommend pairing them with the salsa and curtido (quick pickled cabbage and carrot) to cut the richness.\n\nI've also had the yucca with chicharron, chicken pasteles, and empanadas. These empanadas are made with a fried plantain exterior and filled with either refried beans or a milk custard. I prefer the custard.\n\nThe horchata here has a texture that can read as gritty I guess if you didn't grow up with it. To me horchata SHOULD have texture. Try it! You might like it!

Since we are obsessed with pupusas and empanadas I looked up where to find them on yelp.  Balompie was one of the front runners.  Walking into Balompie yesterday was like being transported to another country with Spanish flowing from all around and soccer on tv.  \n\nWe shared multiple pupusas, rice and beans, empanadas filled with custard and plantains, and a side order of chicharrones.   The most savory pupusa, filled with ground pork, jalapenos and cheese, was hands down our favorite.  We, of course, had to try the more exotic loroco (El Salvadoran vegetable that looks a little like okra) and cheese pupusa which tasted of malt or Ovaltine.  The empanada was unlike any I had before, shaped like a large egg, with dark brown coloring and exterior looked like a burned corn dog.  I enjoyed the sweet custard filling which made me wonder if this was perhaps more often eaten as a dessert.  The preparation of the chicharrones somehow resulted in a loss of the crispy skin which happens to be my favorite part.  I was disappointed because it wasn't what I expected but it was still good.  Make sure you add the hot sauce they put on the table to spice your pupusa up.  I look forward to going back to Balompie again and trying other things on their very large menu.", "author": "Jeannette W."}

Service was friendly, fast, and welcoming. The ambiance was homey, and food was just was I wanted. \n\n     The thing that I read about Balompie is that they offer an extensive option of fillings other than the regular queso such as chicken, fish, shrimp, and ground beef as well as a few other combinations. \n\n     I had the cheese with ground beef and that was tasty and very good. I also had the seafood combo with fish and shrimp and that was good as well. Personally, I prefer a simple queso pupusa con loroco to satisfy my appetite.  Sooooooooooooooooooooooo simple and good. They also offer a good selection of other plates asides from pupusas, which I will definitely be back for, however, I just need two delicious pupusas and an horchata for satisfaction. \n     \n    So, if you like pupusas, and are fed up with waiting for these delicious treats elsewhere, then go to Balompie.

I've eaten in just about every Salvadorean restaurant in the city. Pupusas I am sure look like they are easy to make  but I assure you that nothing could be further from the truth! I was once taken to a place that claims to be Mexican/ Salvadorean and it was the most grotesque version of a pupusa I have ever been unfortunate to taste. Balompies hands down makes the very best pupusas in the city and county of San Francisco. Not to mention the staff works hard to please even when they are at capacity. If you need to call in with a large order they can do that and with few exceptions do it in the timeframe they say they will do it in. Also they have a shrimp pupusa which has no match anywhere. I could care less what the prices are given the amazing food they make. I would pay anything thats how good they are but relax their prices are very reasonable.

Yeah, I know, it's a phenomenon not unique to these restaurants, but the boldness of it is.  \n\nCase in point: I visited Balompie over half a dozen times with my (whitish) boyfriend and liked the food and service each time.  The pupusas are great, the guacamole was surprisingly fresh and tasty, and the salpicon plate was awesome.  I liked it so much that I decided to take my Salvadoran mom and sister to lunch there (sans bf) and WOW, what a huge difference in the quality of the service.   Our food took forever to come (over half an hour) and came in a crazy order: each person's food came separately and the tortillas came at the end of the meal (wtf?!).  The waitress seemed to disappear for long periods of time and never came to check in on us; we had to spend 15 minutes trying to flag her down just to get the check - the place was not even half full!  The next time I went with the bf, I paid closer attention and saw that  same waitress being oh-so-attentive and constantly checking in...with him.  Hmm...yeah.\n\nI'm trying not to blame this particular restaurant for something I've observed at several Salvadoran restaurants (yes, in SF); having lived in ES for several years, I can't say I'm too surprised to see the strong stratification and prejudices of the home culture reflected in the restaurants here.  It's still disappointing, though - I mean, come on, this is San Francisco.\n\nIn conclusion: the food is good (esp. the pupusas, guacamole, horchata, and salpicon), the futbol-themed decor is interesting, and it's a good place to try Salvadoran brews.  But if you're brown and female like me, watch out for the spotty service.  Or you could just take your lighter-toned SO.  [shakes head]", "author": "Stacey S."}

You can find the sister restaurants (Balompie Cafes #2 and #3) in SOMA and Bernal Heights, respectively.  Oh, and Balompie is the Spanish word for soccer, so expect a soccer themed decor and televised soccer games.\n\nFood:  2 stars.  As it was my first time here, I had to try the Salvadorean Sampler (1 pupusa, 1 fried or steamed yuca, and 1 pastel).  I opted for the chicharron y queso pupusa (ground pork with cheese), steamed yuca with beef, and pastel with chicken.  The yuca (aka cassava) is a starchy root similar to potato.  While there was nothing wrong with the yuca, I found that it didn't carry that much taste, along with the grilled beef on top.  The pupusa was mealy, but the flavor of the meat was akin to what I could get from frozen microwave-able burritos.  The best of the bunch was the pastel, which is similar to an empanada.  I liked it for its crunchiness and the fact that it wasn't too flaky.  \n\nService:  3 stars.  When I first walked in, I wasn't sure what to do because there was no greeter or signs in clear view to tell me what to do (adding to the confusion was the line at the cash register, but no menus in sight).  I finally decided to ask a server if I could take a seat and she said to go ahead and grab a table.  Aside from the confusion at the beginning, the service met my expectations.\n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars.  Word of advice:  don't take the tables directly next to the restrooms (phew!!!).  This place feels like any other cheap restaurant in Latin America where the locals congregate to watch soccer.

I'm Salvadorean, born and raised, and I can tell you that their pupusas taste as good as the ones in El Salvador. I've lived here for 14 years and searched high and low for the perfect pupusas, and I have yet to find a place that can match Balompi\u00e9. I recommend trying beans-and-cheese pupusas and revueltas (or mixed) which come with beans, cheese, and pork. And you must accompany them with enough curtido (pickled cabbage) and salsa. For a true experience, try eating them with your hands. Make sure to finish your meal with some empanadas de leche (mashed plantains filled with custard, rolled into a ball and fried). They have great Salvadorean horchata (made with pumpkin seeds instead of rice) as well as great hot chocolate. You really can't go wrong with this place. If you're still not sure what to order, ask your server to recommend items, their staff is very friendly and helpful.", "author": "Dina S."}

I wrote this review for the wrong restaurant!\n\nOn the invite of a recommendation of a friend, a bunch of us took the BART out from Mission and 2nd to have some papusas. The bunch of us who took BART were a little late and we had to wait outside for tables. An apparent usual who was standing outside waiting for a to-go order, had told us that the only real papusas on their menu were the first part, not the specialty ones.\n\nFollowing that advice, we ordered all our food. It took a little while, but when it finally came out we were chowing down. For a big guy like me, two of them filled me up just right... and while I could have gone for bite #3, I'm actually TRYING to watch my diet.\n\n5 stars. I love the spot.

Our crew got a shrimp soup and a chicken soup to share. The Shrimp soup was as good as it looked! The egg inside was to die for, you could taste all the flavors in the soup soak into the yoke!

And if you're a soccer fan, then it's a plus because balompie means soccer and there's always a game playing on their tv here! \n\nThat's Balompie for you. My inner fatty in the past few days is going overboard wanting to try as many different places as I can. So I've been channeling that by picking places that are a bargain. And wow, is this place a bargain! \n\nMy roommate and I decided to basically try all that they're known for. So we two combination plates that combined 3 types of pupusas, plaintains, yuca, pastel, arroz, and frijoles with orders of an orchata and cantaloupe juice. What is a pupusa you ask? Good question. Wikipedia says, \"A pupusa is a traditional Salvadoran dish made of thick, hand-made corn tortilla that is usually filled with a blend of cheese, cooked pork meat ground to a paste consistency, refried beans , or queso con loroco (loroco is a vine flower bud from Central America). I left the last parenthetical because we had no idea what loroco was. Now we do. Yay wikipedia!\n\nPupusas are kind of like arepas. Except they do taste slightly different. Balompie makes them fresh and you can really taste the cheese. The toppings were the vegetables we ordered in the pupusa (our order for pupusas were the loroco y queso, pescado y queso, and the super vegetariana). My favorite was the super vegetariana - simply because of the fillings. But really all are incredibly tasty and at about $3 bucks a pop for a pupusa, you're in for a treat! On to the yuca - ah fried goodness. I could eat these all day long. So crunch, tasty, and perfectly seasoned. Loved it. The plaintains were soft, chewy, and not overly sweet. Absolutely perfect. The orchata required a little getting used to as I am not an immediate fan of really sweet drinks. But it grew on me. And for those who don't know what an orchata is - made from morro seeds, not rice. Other common ingredients include ground cocoa, cinnamon, sesame seeds, nutmeg, tigernuts and vanilla. Finally the cantaloupe juice was good, slightly watered down, but still good.\n\nFinally, the service is great. You can hear mostly spanish at this place but they can tell who's new and who can't speak spanish pretty accurately. And the service accommodates that very well. \n\nAnd the final bill for all that food?! $28 with tip. Boom. I'm a happy happy girl. Thank you Balompie.

At first this was awkward, because our group of four went to sit down next to this couple presumably on a date, since that was the only space available. Now the girl, sensing that four guys were about to intrude on her space, immediately got up and moved down which I was fine with because honestly they ended up being very loud talkers. What I wasn't fine with or more so distracted by was the obnoxious group sitting next to us on the other side who wanted to inquire about much of our orders from the moment  they sat down. One guy went so far as to point on multiple occasions with his excessively long arms at our plates, beer, and wanted to inquire about much of it until he got a clue we weren't gonna pay him any attention. The guy clearly was in left field when he asked if the beer was tea. \n\nPupusas were amazing, best I've ever had. Rice and Beans well I've seen better. The plate didn't have as much flair as some of the other entrees that my friends got, but I believe the pupusas won out on taste alone. Fish pupusas were delightful. Prosciutto and sausage pupusas were amazing and had far better flavor to them. Horchata was good and sweet, but had a stronger hint of chocolate then it should have had. Beer well what can I say, 32oz house special is unspeakable. Portions overall are slightly smaller then a typical hispanic restaurant which can leave you wavering for more, but with still reasonable prices\n\nThe place was a lil hot and humid and on a chilly SF evening you'll end up taking your layers off. It is well decorated with a strong latin feel and probably a good place to watch futbol with the one TV blairing the local countries game. \n\nThe pupusas were the point of the trip and well worth a trip back for.", "author": "Mikey B."}

Minus one for the place being really loud, but then there was a large party at the next table over and they were making most of it.\n\nAnyway, I gotta orchata (horchata) that was stronger than I was used to -- maybe it's like the other poster said, that it wasn't watered down.\n\nMy friend and I both got the Salvadorian combo platter (#1): pupusa, yuca w/meat, pastele. I ordered the loroco y queso pupusa, and my friend got the fish pupusa. Funny, we both liked both and liked each other's better and wound up swapping. I remember the first time I tried their curtido and it was way too strong for me; now I dump it on my pupusa and just scarf it up. Yummm.\n\nThe yuca (which I got steamed rather than fried) turned out to be sorta like potato only different, in a good way, under some lean chicken and over some kinda slaw that was different from the curtido. Very flavorful.\n\nThe chicken pastele, sort of a chicken turnover or pasty, was also good.\n\nThere were also some pickled veggies in vinegar as a garnish that were very good.\n\nAll told, an outstanding, flavorful meal in a slightly uncomfortable space.", "author": "Charles B."}

You can choose to stuff your pupusas with beans, cheese, pork, zucchini, veggies, spinach, shrimp, fish, prosciutto, jalapenos...just about anything really. I usually order the standard pork and cheese papusas and they're excellent. They're crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside, packed with bold spices and flavors, and generously filled with cheese and meat. They're especially delicious when topped with the red sauce and lettuce-like veggie mixture they serve on the side. Best of all? They're only about $2-3 each and 2 will be more than enough to keep you full through lunch (or even dinner). Balompie's papusas are another one of the 7x7 \"100 Things to Try Before You Die\" and certainly for good reason. If you're a fan of Mexican food--and are looking for a dish to rival the amazing quesadillas at El Farolito--you'll love the El Salvadorian Papusas here.\n\nOther winning dishes include the enchiladas, the fried yuca with carne, and the spaghetti with chicken. I was initially skeptical about ordering spaghetti from an El Salvadorian restaurant, but the dish turned out to be quite delicious (although very different from the spaghetti I'm used to having).\n\nIn addition to great food, Balompie has a friendly staff, plenty of seating, and low prices. Next time you're in the Mission for good Mexican food, consider switching it up and giving El Salvadorian cuisine a try. You won't be disappointed!", "author": "Joseph F."}

No flavor whatsoever. For 7 bucks, you get two small Papusas [albeit a block of cheese melted in rice or corn flour] with some lard-laden beans and rice. I know, I know, that's the general premise behind the Papusa. I've eaten them for years, but half the reason for consuming so much cheese are the great, flavorful fillings.

Go ahead, try 'em all.\n\nIf you're feeling like something out of the ordinary, get the whole fried fish. A winner indeed.\n\nWhat can I say?

My girlfriend, who's Salvadorian, and I have spent many a weekend afternoon in the Mission over-enduldging in pupusas and platanos. I've had good, not so good,  I've actually gone as far as to made them myself (much to my understanding girlfriends chagrin) and I have to say Balompie has yet to be topped. The masa is perfect and soooo soft. The queso/loroco pupusas are the best I've had. Revueltas to die for. And much to my surprise, the camarones/queso pupusas rock. Their curtido is the best I've had to date as well. Balompie is a must  if your love for pupusas is a deep and complex as mine. They also play one song really loud, every 20 min or so. Odd. 5 stars.

Tim V. and I stopped by at the Mission location a bit before 6 and grabbed a seat easily. I ordered two pupusas and fried rice & beans (one pupusa was chicharrones y queso and the one had cheese and a native Salvadorean veggie of some sort). Tim opted for steak, sausage, and the same fried rice. The food arrived quickly and we dug in. The side dish tasted more like refried beans mixed together with rice and fried a bit and was pretty good. The pupusas were filled with plenty of cheese. In fact, I think there was a bit too much cheese in relation to the other ingredient and I could barely taste the pork and the veggie. I wish I could take away half a star for that. I also enjoyed the little plates of pickled veggies that came with dinner - the pickled cabbage with rosemary was quite interesting. Overall, I liked Balompie and will visit it again. Hopefully, they'll figure a better balance between ingredients though.", "author": "Andrei Z."}

The Pupusas are the best i have ever tried in North America, my most favorite is the cheese and spinach. The Yuca is great steamed or deep fried. We like the steamed yuca with the pork. make sure you have worked out the day you order as the pork is deep deep fried, however delicious it will make you feel guilty. I usually order the chick stew and chick soup. The sauce with the chicken stew is so good and authentic! Jen my wife's favorite is the lemon chicken with the caso pupusas. When we have finished our meal we usually order two more entrees and pupusas to go for the nest day or midnight snacks. This friday we ordered six pupusas and five entrees, one beer and a coke. One of the entrees was the calamari, my wife claims it was the best calamari in the city, fresh, super crunchy and a great yogurt and cream sauce on the side.The total was under $55.00 So the value is excellent there too. Let me also say the portions are a good size. If you are on the hop you can easily share and be filled. The service is very prompt from Maria she has a gold toothed smile. Balompie Cafe has football played on the flat screen while you eat, European, South American and US. icy cold beer, good food, football, these are good times!!", "author": "Andrew S."}

Back in Marin, we had a husband/wife duo that would set up shop at our soccer games and churn out pupusa goodness. When we won, the coach would pick up the tab for the whole team. Now, Balompie trumps any and all pupusas I have had in my life. Maybe it's the ambiance, with soccer memorabilia from all over the map, even my favorite, Saprissa from Costa Rica.  Maybe it's the Salvadoran Spanish accents filling the room and the women in back throwing down on some masa dough. Ultimately, it comes down to the Pupusas con queso y  loroco (a Salvadorian flower bud) and the boiled yucca that have me sold. Always hot and enough \"curtido\" and salsa to smother all over the top of your meal.  Definitely a must-try spot right off \"La Mission\".", "author": "Jason H."}

I had been forewarned as to the food waiting time, but didn't think it would be that bad. \n\nI visited not too long ago and ordered the breaded pescado with garlic sauce -- waaaaaaay too salty and swimming in broth.  I also ordered the much-hyped pupusas (oh so yum, and only $2.25 each). My man had the combination plate #5, full of meat and beans. A little salty for me, but my man dug it.\n\nAt 8:00 were ready to leave completely satiated until we ordered two pupusas to go.  It took 50 minutes for them to arrive!   Geez, the least you could have done was WARN me!  When they handed us the bill, it was higher than anticipated. Apparently they had included a service charge for TWO people, and charged us the dine-in price instead of the take-out price for the take-out (the take-out price is cheaper).\n\nScrew it. I threw the exact change on the table and left.  Don't get me wrong, the food was cheap and more than edible, but the service was slow and the bill was higher than it really should be.

I had a plate of the platanos, which as platanos go, were quite delicious.  They were a bit meatier than most places, the slices were really thick and you could really taste the sweetness of the plantains.  I also tried the sampler plate that comes with 1 pupusa (chose the Salvadoran veggies and cheese), one pastel (chose the one stuffed with chicken), and this other dish with yucca and fried pork (looked really dry but was so flavorful and had great texture!).
