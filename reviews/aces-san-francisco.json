There's an overall divey feel here and it seems like you can both get your drink on with a crew or roll up solo and still have a good time. There are a ton of 24/7 drink specials and then also specific Sunday specials. Word is on nicer days there's a BBQ with meats being passed around free of charge, but I can't confirm that firsthand.

The decor here was all NY stuff so that was pretty cool.\n\nJust a few notes:\n- $20 minimum for credit cards\n\n- Bartender was very nice, allowed us to bring chips to snack on because he said they (do not?) or were not serving food.\n\n- Drinks are affordable, which can make hitting the 20 dollar minimum difficult.\n\n- The table in the corner (the one behind the stadium seats) is a bit awkward because the top half of the door is kept open and can easily hit a patron.\n\n- Bartender did not know how to make a Tom Collins, looked it up, and still made it incorrectly. Lime and Cherry garnish please. When I asked for lime, he squeezed a lemon in my drink and put it there. Needs the lime still.\n\nOverall, just a so-so bar to go to. Vibes were chill, decor was cool, drinks were average. Nothing spectacular really. Nothing stood out. \n\nIt's in a pretty sketchy neighborhood, so just keep that in mind. I wouldn't recommend this place, and I won't seek out coming here, but it's possible that i'll be back if some friends wanted to go here.\n\n**Don't know why some people say this isn't a dive bar.

To start, the Aces staff was great, ensuring our area is reserved and roped off, had cups, pitchers of water, etc.  \n\nDepending on your group size, Aces can definitely accommodate....whether it's just booking the keg table area, adding on the four stadium seats (2 Yankee & 2 Shea Stadium seats), or even adding the large round table with seating for ~10.  You're then able to pick the right keg size (5 gallon, 7.75 gallon, 15.5 gallon) for your group and the kind of beer you'd like to consume.\n\nNot only do you have your own area to hangout, drink and watch the game with your friends......but, during those busy sporting events (like the World Series), your group does not have to worry about battling the crowd for a beer, and can instead pour an ice cold beer straight from the tap.  Add on a few delivery pizza's and your night is complete :)\n\nThis is definitely a new and unique way to watch a game with friends and I would highly recommend it to others!", "author": "Kevin M."}

Walking alone is not advised, especially if you are walking alone at night from the SOMA/Market St. area up Hyde, Leavenworth, or Jones streets (those aren't the only ones, just the ones that come to mind). This area is notoriously known as the Tenderloin!\n\nIt can get pretty hairy. If you decide to hoof it, make sure to look down at the sidewalk -  you will be dodging a plethora of flotsam and jetsam. Items witnessed that come to mind: animal poop, human poop, urine, vomit, blood, lipids, used condoms, needles, clothes/underwear scattered about haphazardly, horizontal bodies (dead or alive, your guess is as good as mine).\n\nAces is a seedy, gritty NYC-style dive bar that has seen more than a fair amount of rage in the past judging by the alcohol-stained walls and floors that make a sharp tearing sound when one attempts to pull their foot off the flypaper-like floor. The bathrooms are a gem too - I uploaded a pic that hangs on the wall of one of the bathrooms. I think it does more justice than any description I could provide.\n\nMy first time there was to watch a NY Giants game. Picture a scene from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome - a hundred bodies packed in like sardines, teaming while pressed one on top of the other, witnessing the brutality of football, while chugging down buckets of Budweiser (5 cans to a bucket for 12 buckaroos!) and dancing around like aborigines when their team goes for the kill. \n\nA handful of mounted fans are the only climate control that keeps the angry mob from going off the reservation and starting a bread riot! I loved every minute of this crescendo of thunderous drunken exuberance!\n\nThe bartenders take no prisoners. They are always hustling, interacting with the patrons, will skip over you if you aren't prepared to order. You'll get your beverages quick enough, if you can navigate past the 4 layers of bodies without lubricant. Tip: if you are looking for food, you came to the wrong place, they don't serve any here.\n\nAs the Terminator said, \"I'll be back!\"", "author": "Jason M."}

We had stopped at Ace's and JLUKE was kind enough to let us in. If you are from SF then you know how hard it is to find a restroom, let alone someone kind enough to use it without a purchase.\n\nAfter brunch we decided to go back to Ace's and have a beer. JLUKE was the best bartender. Not only was the service great but he also gave us the history behind the bar and the story. He recommended this amazing Irish Coffee that is still on my mind because it was so delicious. We also got a few really cool shirts. \n\nThank you JLUKE for your hospitality and welcoming good energy. He gets 5 stars, overall I gave it a 4. \n\nCheers!", "author": "Alicia D."}

The price was incredibly reasonable compared to what other places would charge (especially on NYE) for a private event with an open bar. They even threw in some light food for the party at no additional cost. I can't stress enough how easy it was to work with the owner and manager when planning the event. Great guys that you'd want to hang out with regardless.\n\nThe event: I provided a list of names of who was attending (80 people) and they had a bouncer manage the door which took off all the pressure from me at the event. As an organizer, I didn't have to do anything at the party so I got to have fun like everyone else. They took care of everything. The atmosphere is perfect for an event - the bar is big and is perfectly accessible to everyone since the room is more of a square than a rectangle which is typical of most SF bars (no crowding at the bar blocking off the walkway). My friends kept commenting on how comfortable the place was. They also had 2-3 bartenders working at all times so no one ever had to wait for drinks which is key when having an open bar. The bartenders themselves were great and very friendly. Overall, it was a huge success and everyone at the party had a great time.\n\nEveryone involved in the process (owner, manager, bartenders, etc) were awesome to work with...they have a great group of people running the place (professional and classy but also fun). I highly recommend renting out Ace's for whatever event you are planning.", "author": "Tim R."}

Upon entering, we were greeted by a smile, quick service and cheap drinks.

This comment was strictly to make a point about the noise levels of this ritual, not the importance of WHY you are yelling at an inanimate object like a crazy person, or who you are yelling about).\n\nIf you can catch this place when no sports are playing you will find that the bartenders have favorite bands, such as Social Distortion and U2. You will discover that certain bands CDs, as well as house compilations with several songs by said bands, appear in the jukebox in several conspicuously spaced locations. You will also find that the selection, though heavy on a select few bands, is lively and you will likely find something you enjoy. \n\nThere are lots of windows to let the light in during daylight hours. This is a good thing since this bar opens at 6AM, and many bars that open this early do not have a lot of windows, thus making your 6AM drinking seem even more downtrodden than it already is if you need to hit the booze that early in the morning. \n\nThe drinks are average, selection pretty good and the prices decent, especially during happy hour when they knock a buck off your beer or well drink. Not a destination bar, but a good place to pop in if you are craving some Social D, a few screaming men, a refreshing shower and a morning (or afternoon, or evening) beverage of the alcoholic variety.", "author": "Drue C."}

Apparently, this bar was recently deemed the official Badger alumni bar for all the Wiscos to gather and watch football games. \n\nSure, there were enough TV screens to watch the Badgers romp Fresno State at every angle, but overall it seemed like an odd location choice. I think the regulars were a bit confused why a sea of red-clad, Miller-drinking fans were hanging out in their bar watching the game. Confused at first, and then a bit annoyed, then downright hostile. Maybe the Wisco alumni organizers figured a New York bar would be a good match for Brett Favre fans and Jets fans unite? It clearly wasn't working. A friend of mine got threatened for sitting on an empty stool to watch the game (which remained empty the entire time we were there as the dude watched it and we stood.) I got ice thrown at me from some 38-going-on-55 cougar with a bad perm, which actually felt kind of refreshing thanks to the sweltering heat. Even after most of the Wisco-crew departed, it was uber-crowded with zero ventilation. \n\nBartenders were nice, and as accommodating as they could be for only having 2 people serving drinks.

You will feel right at home with the friendly clientele in the bar, the bar's inviting lighting and cleanliness, not-too-loud music, and fun scene.\n\nSidebar: this is a phenomenal place to catch a NY Yankees game or a NY Giants game.  This place is chock full of REAL NYG and NYY fans who know their shit and like to watch games.  If you are a fan, I can't speak highly enough about this place.  The enormous oversized New York Yankees sign in the window gives it away.", "author": "Cody K."}

Needing a place to hang on a Tuesday night (since the room was so bad), I wandered into Ace's. I sat down and introduced myself to the bartender. He said, \"Hi, I'm Tommy\" in a solid NY accent. Even though I'm from Chicago, I felt like I was at a pub down the street from my house. You can tell the place had a lot of regulars, but I had a great time talking with people.\n\nI ended up back in there the next night. Will was bartending and he was just a solid as Tommy. A good place with good prices on drinks. I will go out of my way to go there next time I'm in town.\n\nAlso, a solid, diverse selection on the jukebox.", "author": "Woody M."}

Instead of a naked woman or velvet elvis painting above the bar there's a downward tilting mirror so you don't even have to get up or turn your head to check people out.\n\nThere's a heavy deck-of-cards theme and that's well done with the artwork, tee shirts, card suits stained into cement floors.  Four or more flat screen TVs in a small room.\n\nDinks are decent and on the inexpensive and largish side, alcohol and beer selection is SF basic (which would make it the best bar in most other towns).\n\nBest of all they open up at 6AM so you can get your morning drunk started early.", "author": "Gil S."}

Like Matt said, fans of other football teams come in and are also respected completely.\n\nScotty is a stand-up manager/owner and runs a great business and does whatever he can for his employees and customers. The only reason Nicole was 86ed is because she just didn't know how to step down and stop getting into people's business (even after being told to her face that she has to just chill out and walk away from the scenes that SHE started). \n\nI came into Aces with a fellow Giants fan and was immediately accepted and treated like an equal by the staff and the regulars.

I only come here on Sundays for football, so I have no idea how this place is otherwise.\n\nI'll usually roll in around 9-ish on Sunday, and get started with their $2 16 oz Buds/Bud Lights.  Drinking these makes the pre-game shows infinitely more tolerable (unless Steve Young is on...but it's usually Bradshaw or Berman annoying the shit out of everyone).  At this point, my day is feeling pretty good, since getting drunk while other people are at church is always a fine way to start a day.\n\nThere are two crowds that show up at the bar.  When I get there, there is the group of people who are hung over from the night before, and stumble in to get a couple Bloody Mary's, or a real drink if they are alcoholics.  These people are interesting, but I'm not drunk enough to really talk to them for more than 5 minutes before I want to run away (you know what I'm talking about).\n\nThe football crowd will start to filter in around 10:30 (besides the hardcore fans who have to watch the early kickoff).  The football crowd here is really excellent.  A variety of knowledgeable fans, associated with different teams.  They are friendly, can talk good football, and are just fun to watch games with.\n\nThe bartenders are also really solid.  They make sure you got your drink supplied, and they can talk football too!  I made the mistake of doubting one of the female bartenders fan-dom, and she owned with some Bronco trivia knowledge.  So respect to her, and the other bartenders.\n\nThere is also free BBQ on Sundays, which isn't that great...but it is free.  I haven't eaten anything off the menu, but...that isn't why I come here.\n\nI come here to get drunk on the cheap, watch Sunday Ticket, and hang out with fun NFL fans.

It was the week before the Giants-Niners playoff game in San Fran and two weeks before he and I would fly out there to surprise my aunt for her 70th birthday. We made it a point to go here the night we flew in, so after getting settled at our hotel, we grabbed a cab and went over for a few beers. I was expecting it to be bigger, but its smaller size grew on me. I must say that I didn't really feel \"at home\" at the New York themed bar, but I felt very comfortable nonetheless.  There were mostly locals there it seemed and the bartender was actually from Boston, with an obvious accent, which was, of course, ironic. The bar itself is \"L\" shaped and small but there weren't many people there that night so we found spots right away, probably because it was pretty early and on a Thursday. Beer selection was great, spirits stock looked well kept, and after a beer or two we walked down the road a bit to Pearl's Deluxe Burgers, on a recommendation from our friend from Boston.", "author": "Kevin L."}

The crowd is more Tender-nob than Nob Hill, and the vibe is distinctly neighborhood-pub rather than dress-up-club. Wall decor is largely forgettable, save a single painting titled \"Scared money never wins\".  Four-buck Beers are reasonably priced, and the bar dishes out complementary peanuts.\r\n\r\nBarry Bonds smacked number 715 over the center-field fence as I sat  sipping a pint at Ace's.  An older couple and six middle aged guys were hanging out.  There was minimal clapping and celebration followed by a long debate about the area of the stadium where number 715 landed.  Everyone had an opinion....nobody was right.  I popped by after work one day when the Yankees were playing the Red Sox.  Yankees fans were the rule....Boston fans were the exception.\r\n\r\nAn interesting but little discussed feature of Ace's is the long, narrow mirror against the wall in back of the bar.  It's tilted downwards so that anyone in the place can check out most of the bar without turning their heads.  It makes for an interesting flirt.  Not only you can check out a table of ladies in the back by glancing at the mirror....you can meet eyes with them when they do the same.  It's an interesting feature that everyone thinks is their own little secret....but it isn't.\r\n\r\nIt's a slightly awkward environment for one-time visitors, as the regulars-centric crowd can someties take a few visits to break into.  And while it's not really of a destination bar, it's definitely one to check out if you're moving into the hood and looking for a local hangout.", "author": "Mike W."}

The bartenders are just good buds. Good vibe in here and every game on the tv's.", "author": "Ash D."}

So it's kinda difficult to review this bar since I go there most of the time.  My girls and I go there every so often.  Despite all that, I love their drinks.  They pour a good amount of Alchy and they have cool bartenders.  Usually when I go there I  order a shot of Grey goose and it's always filled up.  Join me and my girls there.

In my opinion, it is far from a dive bar... have you been to R Bar? \nBest bartenders ever (besides GAMH)! Good prices, big TV's, clean bathrooms, and my little pup can come hang out with us (although I'm still upset he can go behind the bar, and I can't).\nPlus I live in the beginning of the loin/lowest section of nob hill, and it's nice to go 3 blocks and be at a great bar in a great area, not just another Koko Cocktail or Whiskey Thieves (I do however like the Thieves). \nAll in all, if you are in the lower nob-hill area, and don't know where to go... just walk past R Bar, Lush Lounge, Vertigo and all the other Polk St. hang outs, and cruise to Hyde and Sutter where you'll have a much better time and you don't have to co-habitat the bar with the Marina crowd who think they are \"so cool \" for hanging out in the loin.", "author": "Jessica O."}

I am from the NJ/NY area originally and when it came time to find a place that played Giants games (those early am ones on Sunday), some bartenders suggested I go to Ace's because it was a \"new York bar\" (I swear San Francisco is so weird with that shit). Anyways like a dummy I didn't go during football season and instead waited 7 months to check it out. I was missing out!\n\nFirst, it's got people in it on weekdays which is great because it reminded me of New York and thats a change from sleepy weeknight bars in SF. Secondly, the bartenders are super friendly and chill, no attitude and fun to talk to. Lastly, its fuckin cheap! We drank many many beers and Jamesons and the bill was $30 (2 people at least 4 drinks each). \n\nI won't even take a point off for lack of food, because you can order in if you want!", "author": "Sam H."}

However I have no idea what a \"NY Bar\" is and I've been to plenty of bars in NY.\n\nDark, moody, steady stream of locals and a bartender who was genuinely cool. None of the fake niceness that you sometimes get. Either he was really that cool or a great actor, either way worth a nice tip. This bar was a winner for me. Oh and 3 makers/cokes, 2 vodak redbulls for $30?! I'm coming back tonight. One last thing...I could have sworn I saw a friendly canine tucked away in a corner but I think I must have been seeing things.

Scott the owner said hit up aces, ask for Eric and he will be more than happy to turn the UFC fights on.....Let me back track....The Pub at fishermans wharf is the same owner as aces.  Not UFC fights at the pub, so hit aces.... SO, we walked for the pub (bad idea, cause its far and up hill), a slight \"buzz\" was very helpful tho.  Walk in, its a local bar, not busy, B line to the bar, which is 6 steps from the front door, as for my guy Eric.  Give him the whole story about pub, fight, scott...blah blah blah.  He grabs the remote and puts the fights on.  After 2-4-5-7 drinks the night was perfect.  After my buddy wins his fight, we close out our tab, which was VERY VERY LOW considering the amount of drinks we had consumed, and called it a night at ACES.  Total local dive bar.

Well let me explain. it all started out at the ballpark. I attended a Giants game with my rowdy friends from softball, brian and mike. the Giants started out strong, and a win seemed promising. my friend brian is an excellent heckler. So good in fact, it prompted about 20 other guys around us to start yelling too. poor Lee (the Brewers leftfielder) took quite a beating. thankfully he had a sense of humor because he kept turning around and laughing. in a bad twist of fate though, things got ugly fast and the Giants lost 10-1 (ouch) to the Brewers. despite the loss, we were in great spirits after the game. we wanted to go out so we cruised around. the idea was to corrupt a new place.....and we found Aces. its far from being in a desirable area and its definitely not fancy. the crowd inside was, well..... interesting. but it all worked.... i found myself having a great time here. by the end of the night the whole bar was chatting together like longtime friends over a blaring jukebox. major bonus feature, the bathroom is really clean! yep, sparkling and lemon scented. the bartender being from Boston knew exactly how to keep the bar happy and the drinks flowing. so upon leaving we agreed the final consensus was good. i was impressed and plan on coming back. fun times, good bar.", "author": "Michelle I."}

Okay... that's an exaggeration... but it is my favorite bar, and I do live above it now. The drinks are hella good. Their long island iced tea is untouchable. The bartenders are a bunch of new yorkers... they're good people, but they are New Yorkers. I'm not much of a sports fan, but if you were you'd love this place. The bar gets packed, drunk, and loud. There is an interesting mix of people at this bar; they are difficult to summarize. The bar opens at seven AM (hellz yes!), so there are a lot of older (not old, I mean 40-50's) people that came to drink like rats. None of them are really mean. Then, about sixty percent of the people there are in their twenties, but they tend to be toward the top percentile of partyers. I saw a girl drunkenly dancing and kicking on a table here at 4:30 once. I usually can't leave the bar myself without at least two drinks... but usually like 5 drinks. The jukebox is kickass, with lots of great rock songs from Metallica to Cake to Dropkick Murphys. The prices are fair for a heavy, king-in-the-face, but delicious cocktail. Go here.

Unlike most venues, the owner Scott actually shows up at the bar a few times a week to greet and visits with guests! Tommy and Danielle are awesome bartenders and always make you feel welcome. Wednesday nights they hook up a Wii, allowing customers to play and encouraging mingling within various groups of patrons. On warm Sunday San Francisco days they barbeque food outside for guests FREE; nothing beats sports on the tube, bbq, and an ice cold beer! Prices here are great ($2 Buds/Bud Lights on Sundays) and mixed drinks are always well poured. No matter what night of the week, I can consistently walk into Ace's and feel completely welcome and comfortable.
