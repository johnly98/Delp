Pretty easy to get to actually since it's right near the F-line turnaround.  A bit of pricey lunch at $30 for a roll, side and soda.  But it was a lot better than I thought it would be.\n\nLobster Roll (w/ extra lobster): Basically the Connecticut-style lobster roll that I love.  Warm lobster chunks dressed in mainly just butter on a toasted split bun roll.  The portion was fine with the extra lobster option, but the default amount might be too skimpy.  I especially liked the bun since it was fluffy, buttery and crispy all at the same time.  Definitely satisfied my urge.\n\nMac-'n-Cheese: Was a bit of let down.  Glad I got the side rather than the main course with lobster on top.  The macaroni was way too soggy.  There was no crusty cheese on top.  The cheese sauce was better than Kraft, but wasn't anywhere in my top list for mac & cheese I've had around the city.", "author": "Adam B."}

However it could have been more flavorful. (At least give people options to season themselves. Some Old Bay and some garlic options.) But they were pretty good because they were fresh. That's why the 2 stars.\n\nCustomer Service:0/10\nThey guy was totally lifeless. I just feel like when  running any kind of business you should have someone personable interacting with the customer. He just took the order and made our food. No smiles ...nothing. Like he did not want to be there.\n\nThis place is very small in the inside as well.

We both got a regular Lobster Roll with mayo and butter. The roll was so soft and delicious and they don't skimp on how much meat they give you. However, if your feeling extreme.. and like a side of roll with your meat, go extra meat. They give you so much meat it is crazy!!! I want to try the half (lobster) and half (crab) next time. \n\nThe prices were very reasonable for what they give you. And being the germaphobe that I am, I loved how the server handled himself when preparing our sandwiches. He put on fresh gloves in front of us and removed them when touching other stuff. That alone gave him a star. Ntm, he was friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. \n\nCrabsters, in my opinion, is a takeout type of restaurant. There's a small waiting bar, but that's the extent of the space in there. You order your sandwiches, grab you a bag of chips, something to drink, and head out.

After a long day of hiking, my girlfriend and I were famished and excited to get a crab roll. We walked in and there wasn't a single person there except for the guy behind the counter. I walk up and asked if the Dungeness was fresh, and the guy replies \"yes\". Nothing more, nothing less, just \"yes\". Befuddled, I say, \"How are the lobster?\" He then gives me a look of utter disdain and annoyance and says, \"Sir, what can I help you with?\" I explain to  him that what I order depends on what he tells me about their ingredients. He then rolls his eyes. At this point I'm raging inside but was anticipating getting a crab roll and dammit, I wasn't going to let this guy stop me. \n\nI ordered a crab roll and my girlfriend ordered the macaroni and cheese mixed with the lobster and crab. Though my crab roll was small, it was not bad. However, just getting back from Seattle the previous week I definitely did not feel it was fresh Dungeness. In all fairness, it could have been that at this point I was so irritated at my experience that it ruined it for me. The macaroni and cheese dish was more or less the same as the crab roll, imo. The macaroni and cheese was better than Kraft, but that's about it. Same story on the crab and lobster meat, didn't think it was fresh.\n\nService-wise, this was one of the worst experiences, if not THE worse experience, I've ever experienced at a food establishment. I would never come back based on that alone.\n\n** It's also worthy to note that there is absolutely no seating inside or out.", "author": "Rick C."}

The owner makes the lobster rolls on the spot and asks you if you prefer mayo or butter or both, but he recommended to have both so that's what I got.

For some odd reason tourist just don't walk in this area and stay on a straight path causing them to miss this place. \n\nSo my family and I walk in and notice that its empty and I start to wonder if its any good. I mean why isn't anyone else in here?! We order anyways..getting a lobster roll with butter and mayo as well as a cup of clam chowder. The man who works there was super friendly and def does not cheat you of any lobster. So we get out food and we are amazed at how much lobster he put in! Usually places out here in Vegas will put something like celery to fill the sandwich in. Flavor wise it was really good! &the clam chowder was delish! Def would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good food!", "author": "Jamie C."}

However, after giving him (the owner) an opportunity to correct the issue, he clearly made it evident that he did not favor \"us\" eating there. In fact he stated \"you people should be happy I'm giving you a break, by letting you eat something this good.\" The racism displayed after this was nothing short of a documentary from the civil rights movement. After he refused to change his gloves that he wore while he did other things while prepping our food, I kindly requested my money back. He refused to do so and continued to disrespect my fianc\u00e9 and I hoping to get a rise, to which we didn't oblige. I will strongly encourage anyone with a Since a moral character to refrain from eating at this restaurant. If you are a person who believes that people should be judge on the content of their character and not the color of their skin, then this is NOT a place you should support. It's sad to see a person with such a vile attitude and hateful  heart in 2018. \n\nTo see the video of this encounter please search hashtags #RacismAtCrabsters #NoMore2800Leavonworth #RacistSanFranCrabstersOwner  all social media outlets.", "author": "Mr S."}

The shop is super tiny and barebones - there isn't any seating available. \n\nAll lobster rolls anywhere in SF are expensive, but I feel like this one in particular was small and overpriced. The guy working in the back literally opened a pre-packed, pre-cooked ziplock bag of lobster, dumped it onto a bread roll, and then heated it up on the grill.  It tasted fine, but still weird to see the guy prepare it from a ziplock bag then charge me $22 for it. It wasn't worth the money.", "author": "Mary N."}

Unfortunately I read some good reviews for this place and figured it was worth a shot during our san Fran vaca. Big mistake. First off, there was only one dude there. Also, not super friendly. He took several peoples orders, then turned around to make the orders, pretty much ignoring everyone else in line. I believe the crab and lobster were fresh... but how could I be sure, they were individual portions in little snack bags in a dorm sized mini fridge. The mac n cheese is just in a giant bag, from a food company, not house made. The guy must have answered the phone 10 times while making the orders, definitely making take much longer to put meat on bread. I tried to order the half/half roll, it's on the menu, but the guy said I couldn't order it because the ration of bread to meat would be off. Really? Ok, full half crab, half lobster roll with mayo and butter. My husband got the mac n cheese lobster roll. My son got the clam chowder with crab, and we ordered a side of mac n cheese for our 2 yr old. Two bottles of water for 2.50 each. We waited as he took orders for several other people, while also still answering the phone. Finally he started to make our food, still stopping to answer the phone. He forgot the mayo on mine, and honestly, the crab and lobster taste just as bland as I imagine the plastic bag would taste if I had eaten that. I asked where the outside seating was, in which he replied 'in the center of the building'. No help with which direction to head. Of course there was no availble seating. Way too much bread for how much meat you get. My husband ate his and said it was ok, our son only took a few bites of his chowder before turning up his nose. Our toddler pretty much spit out her mac n cheese. After tasting it I knew why.... It's so peppery, you'll choke. It ended up in the trash too. Pretty much a big waste of money, bad service and nothing near what they advertise. After walking on the pier, we realize we should have just waited in line to get something from the crabstands as at least you can see what you're paying for before you pay.  Maybe they could do a better job if they hired more than one person to do 3 peoples jobs. But then again, the food is what makes a restaurant, and this food was no good.
