The bar is small with only a tiny booth in the back so it is usually standing room only, or sitting on the ledge where the windows are.  The bartenders are friendly and no b.s. I've seen them appropriately cut off people who are way too drunk from a long Sunday funday and the staff is good at handling a (at times) rowdy crowd in here.  The drunks are about $5.50 for a nice draft (lagunitas).

Divey, laid back, sporty, and cheap drinks!  It's not huge but there were plenty of  seats...magic I guess.  Also, there were enough TV's so that you can see and keep up with whatever is on at the time from any place in the bar.  \n\nI had the pleasure of meeting one of the bartenders, Dave.  He served me the  \"Champagne of Beer\".  He asked if I wanted another at the perfect time, two sips before empty.

I don't know how this small bar can hold all these fans .i.e. my co-worker and his wife who are also die-hard Pittsburgh Steeler's fan. And me, a Niner fan, well, I'm just hiding shamefully and just there to watch and enjoying the game. I'm not going to tell the Steeler fans that i'm a Niner fan. I'm not that crazy!\n\nThe bar offers $2.00 bottles of Bud and Bud Light. It is kind of odd offering the excited Steeler fans a special on a crappy St. Louis beer. Anyway, the sport-patrons drink whatever they can to enjoy the playoff game. \n\nDespite a sad and painful ending to Ravens Running Back Willis McGahee, the Steelers won the game and advance to Superbowl versus the NFC Champion: Arizona Cardinals. And all the Steeler fans including my two companions were very thrilled, happy and most likely be back to Shanghai Kelly's for the Superbowl.", "author": "Matt G."}

I'm barely a few feet behind my boyfriend, trying to get to my ID to get in, when some 21 year old looking, bleach blonde, blue-eyeshadow-wearing skank is hitting on my boyfriend, with me right behind him, as I'm giving her the stare of death, and she's asking him what his name is.  \"Your name is DEAD, bitch\", I think to myself, as I try to explode her head with the sheer power of my mind, and the lasers I imagine are coming out of my eyeballs.  (No, I am not a jealous person, why do you ask?)  We went to the other end of the bar, my boyfriend was smart enough to hug me and make it known we were together, but I still tried to destroy her from across the room with my secret laser-eyes and psychic powers.  \n\nAnyway, we stayed for a drink, it was packed with drunken 20-somethings, I remember we ended up escaping out the windows, that's how busy it was.  And I never went back, because from the street on a weekend it often looks too crowded.  \n\nAbout a year later I move to the neighborhood, go there early (around happy hour time) with a good girl friend of mine, joke around a little with a bartender there, and now I actually really like this place (because of the bartenders, mainly, and it doesn't hurt that it's about a block away from my new place.)  \n\nI have a problem because I love pubs and dives but I hate beer and find regular drinks boring (I like wine and all kinds of martinis better) but I go there anyway because the bartenders make you feel very welcome and are generally pretty friendly.

I was in San Francisco for the weekend and heard it was one of the better Steelers bars in San Francisco, but what does that even mean?\n\nI strolled in, bald head, sun glasses and 86 jersey in tow and found a place to sit down. To my horror, the dude next to me was drinking a Naked Juice through a straw that he seemed way too fond of and the C&C I ordered worked out to like $2 an ounce.  I was already missing Gabes' standard issue Dixie cups my C&C's usually come in. This was bullshit.\n\nThen, just as I was getting comfortable on my bar stool and finishing my drink, this lady comes in with 2 bags full of appetizers from Whole Foods. She had some sun-dried tomato hummus, rice crackers, and some funky expensive looking cheese she seemed to be saving for when the party really got started. I didn't even know the fans of the Pittsburgh Steelers could develop such sophisticated palates. I know I hadn't.\n\nNeedless to say, I got up from my seat and headed to the other end of the bar. Gouda is not going to ruin my day! But unknowingly, I had relocated to the heart of the freak show. I ended up beside this shaggy dude in a black trench coat who started shaking his hands in the air in front of him like the one man chosen by Jesus to save our souls. He repeatedly shouted, \"UNLEASH THE HOUNDS!!!!\"\n\nI glanced back at the door. It wasn't too late, but my loyalty to the Steelers forced me to endure the circus around me. Once the game was fully underway, I settled into my spot and met several really cool people around me and the place quickly filled with Steelers fans that were just as rowdy as the ones I'm used to. This Steelers bar definitely felt like San Francisco and after the Steelers won everyone poured out into the streets, waving their Terrible Towels.\n\nAll in all this was a fun place to watch the game, but this is definitely the bar the rest of the Steeler Nation doesn't brag about to it's friends or talk about publicly..", "author": "EG X."}

But no matter, I can put my biases aside and write a straight-up, balanced review about this place. \n\nShanghai's will give you typical beer -- Bud, Coors, Miller -- along with the usual craft brews like Fat Tire (no complaints there) for cheap. Went here on a Thursday and a Coors Light was $3.50. Which is about as much as anyone should pay for such a crappy beer. But hey, there's something about baseball and a watery American pilsner that just sings. \n\nThere will usually be a hefty crowd in this small joint, but nothing that would spoil your good time. It's that kind of old-school pub that you want to be crowded, a little noisy, and boisterous. And you know, lot's of random memorabilia and pictures on the wall, kind of rundown and oh yes, a little sticky. \n\nWhen I first moved here, I would always confuse this place with North Star in North Beach.

Bartenders were friendly, but definitely worried about IDs.  I was checked twice in less than 5 minutes.  God Damn!  But at least they do a better job of patrolling than the SFPD.\n\nBeers were between $3.50 - $5.00.  I think they were having MGDs and Miller High Lifes specials for $2.50.  A great price for the \"Champagne of Beers.\"  The decor inside was interesting.   This place was described as a saloon, but the only thing that seemed to say this was the split door.  The ceiling was covered with an assortment of banners.  A few TVs on the walls, which could make this place a pretty good place to catch some of the upcoming Bowl games. \n\nIf I had to go back?  I would say \"Yes.\"\n\nHere go the STARs:\n\n+1 STAR - The place was fairly low key, making it a nice place to grab a few drinks with friends.\n\n+1 STAR -  PBR on tap and Miller High Lifes for $2.50, can't beat that.\n\n+1 STAR - Reminded me of a smaller version of Northstar.

I prefer it on week nights when it is practically empty save for the kitsch on the walls and the random irish guys who flock there. on weekends this place can get packed though, and it will take about fifteen minutes to walk the length of the bar. beware of the mirror against the back wall, it always looks deceivingly like a doorway to more fun.", "author": "julia r."}

Very friendly bartenders, and a lot of great locals who just want to hang out, have a beer or a few with friends, and watch sports.  If you are a Steelers fan, this is the best bar in the city for you.", "author": "Grace R."}

They always have some crazy shot you can order that is usually super cheap.  I've ordered the \"Bart Simpson\" shot which is Pineapple Juice/Vodka, so I haven't yet decided if the name is due to the spikey hair or color, but regardless a $2 shot is good regardless.  I've also purchased plenty of Obama's Koolaid shots for $3.  The bartenders are social and very nice.", "author": "Tyke L."}
