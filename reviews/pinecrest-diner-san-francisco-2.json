Their menu is full of standard diner fare for breakfast, lunch and dinner.  I ordered a chicken caesar salad.  WOW!  It was almost more beautifully grilled chicken than crisp, fresh Romaine lettuce.  Just the right amount of parmesan cheese and dressing.  I'm very particular when it comes to my caesar salads.  I wont eat the 'old' dark green romaine tops, because Yuck!  This salad had none of that!  It was Delicious!  I was tempted to look at their dessert menu, but I didn't want to be late to the Curran, which is just up the block from Pinecrest.  Maybe next time!\n\nIf you're in the area, don't pass up Pinecrest Diner because it's not the upscale place you were hoping to find.  The food is GOOD!  And to think I almost settled for the Jack in the Box across the street.  Thank goodness I didn't!!", "author": "Abby L."}

I had an egg white bay shrimp omelette which was pepperjack cheese, green onions, tomatoes and shrimp. This was probably one of the worst omelettes I've had in my life. It was so tasteless, probably didn't even have salt and pepper. The shrimp was very plainly cooked, and they could hardly be tasted, while the taste of the tomatoes was just overwhelming. The cheese (which didn't really taste like good pepperjack either) was very unevenly distributed with large blobs of it in some places and absolutely nothing in others. The combination of these fillings was a very bad idea. I should have just gone for a plain ham and cheese. They were willing to sub the hash browns and toast for a side salad, so that was nice.\nMy boyfriend had the pinecrest special with french toast, and he said it was nice, but the portion size was a bit small.", "author": "Haylee M."}

It was crowded both times, seems like a popular local place, and it's next to about a half dozen art galleries ... which is why we were there.

The eggs were good, the meats (bacon and sausage) were cooked well, but the hash was a little too oily and maybe not crispy enough.  Service was friendly, but a little slow.

In my many moons on the planet,since traveling on the road with my family as a child - diners have never failed me.  I feel I need to do an exclusive diner review. This place has now made my extensive list of diner experiences and I am happy to say it's near the top!\n\nUp the street from our hotel, we kept passing Pinecrest on our walking tours of the streets of San Francisco. And every time - the lines were out the door and down the block! We knew we had to come here and were trying to figure out WHEN. When is this place NOT crowded? \n\nI wrote in another review about a serendipitous experience Mr. E had (subject of the other review) after stopping in and ordering charbroiled burgers to go from a diner (this review).  This place is 11 on the scale of  1 to10!  And this, from two charbroiled cheeseburgers, lettuce, pickle, tomato, on a bun with NO other condiments! I declare I have not had a better grilled burger ANYWHERE - not even at a summer cookout! We devoured these burgers late at night in our hotel room - an unusual late night snack for us, but OH did it satisfy!! Upset after the burgers were all gone; we knew we had to go back for a proper meal.\n\nOn our last day, after checking out of the hotel in the wee hours, we sat down for our final meal in San Francisco (no lines at this time of morning, btw). I had my tried and true two eggs over easy, chicken sausages, hash brown potatoes, wheat toast and regular coffee. Mr. E had pancakes, corned beef hash and decaf coffee.  Again, big ups for the west coast's now unbroken record for the best coffee we've had consistently.\n\nWhen we visit San Francisco again, we will come back here and try some of the other delectable offerings on their menu.

The pancake was pretty standard but the perfect sweet to my savory.\n\nMy last experience here was a win in my eyes. Gotta appreciate those late night food spots!

I was disappointed when I was served crunchy shoe string fries. You are a diner act as such. Leave the skinny fries to McDonald's. Overall food was decent. Server not warm at all. Next morning same time the gentlemen I'm seeing escorted me back there. ( ladies don't give up hope...there are still good men out there:) we ordered turkey burgers with Swiss fries...I had a chocolate shake. It seemed like he wanted my shake so bad. Same server he lacks warmth I guess that's his thing. He more then makes up for it with excellent service if that makes any since. Hipsters where did they come from. So the momentum was so good we went back a third morning. This time we ordered traditional breakfast food. We both got the namesake special. Delicious. The server looked like she didn't understand that 90s grudge is over! We are eating there tomorrow if it's in the cards. Hopefully someone reads this in management and politely demands her to wash her hair  wax and wear a little makeup. These are facts no shade intended.

I'm not sure how many diners there are in SF, but this one earns great marks for location, service, and great food with us.  Win-Win-Win.\n\nWe had the NY steak, which comes with a good size dinner salad, (not wilted, has color to it), a gigantic baked potato, and some seasonal steamed veggies.  (Cauliflower, zucchini, etc)  Everything was really cooked well, no mushy veg, great medium temp steak.  It was enough to share-there was so much to munch on!  (We also ordered an appetizer, which was a mistake, because it was really all too much to eat.  We got the mozzarella sticks-which were awesome- BTW- and they give you 8 per order!)\n\nI had a garden salad, which was a nice sized with the usual veggies.  (I wasn't starving that night, for whatever reason.  I did have a hard time finishing it, it was pretty large for me.  I eat a TON of salads and can usually scarf down quite a bit...so this was a new one!)\n\nThe place is a busy little corner, but we got a window booth and it was pretty cool to be right on the sidewalk and peoplewatch while the lights came up in the street.  I like a little hometown feel once and a while, and this place really did feel great.  I know we'll be back again soon!  Thanks, everyone!\n\nTIP:\n\n* There isn't much space to wait and not a ton of tables, so just be aware that they get busy and the line stacks up.\n\n* I saw the nachos and they are HUGE! :)\n\n*They take cards, but have one of those little no name ATM machines inside the door if you need cash...", "author": "Diana W."}

The place was clean and definitely had the look of a diner with booths and round seats for sitting at the counter.\n\nMy friend and I chose a booth and we got seated right away. Although it was dinner time there were only a couple other customers inside. My friend and I attributed this to the fact that there are a lot of restaurants located in this area, and indeed some more seats started filling in as the evening progressed.\n\nThe waiter was really nice and did attend to our table, but he didn't check on us much, which surprised me because there weren't that many people in there. We had to flag him down a couple of times for basic things like water.\n\nThe reason for the two stars is because of the rather poor quality of the food.  The waiter said the shrimp on the shrimp salad was boiled but, but he failed to mention that it was also refrigerated and served cold.  My friend ordered the shrimp salad and was disappointed. She didn't finish half of her plate.  My Cobb salad had a few chunks of cheese that I didn't notice until I was almost done with it.  \n\nSince I have a dairy allergy (casein, not lactose intolerant), I was really disappointed to find the cheese and to realize that I may have eaten something that I shouldn't have. I understand that everyone makes mistakes and that if I eat out I have to deal with cross contamination from time to time, but it is always a downer when it happens.\n\nMy friend and I plan to visit this area again, but we won't be back to this diner.", "author": "Jenny T."}

It took me only a moment to recall where I was, note my wife still sleeping soundly beside me, and discover the two questions burning in my mind:\n\nWhy, oh why, am I spontaneously awake at 4 AM?\n...and... \nHow quickly, at this unholy hour, can I locate, acquire, and consume a bagel and egg sandwich?\n\nI never got an answer to the former, but a stat Yelp consult pointed me at the Pinecrest Diner, within one block of my hotel.\n\nI was seated immediately. Pinecrest is your basic American greasy-spoon diner, which is good, because that's precisely what I was looking for. The object of my ravenous craving was promptly delivered, along with a suitably oleaginous (look it up) side of hash browns. \n\nThe scrambled eggs were slightly overcooked--but try to find a diner that does otherwise. (Good luck with that.) What the eggs lacked in finesse, however, they made up for in sheer mass. Sitting there in my little booth in pre-dawn San Francisco, I swear I could feel the gravitational pull they exerted on my fork. This was, indeed, the breakfast of my prematurely interrupted dreams.\n\nPinecrest only takes cash, so don't get caught unprepared. They've got a generic cash machine in the corner, but I wouldn't touch that thing with YOUR ATM card, if you know what I mean.\n\nBut if you've got a Jackson burning a hole in your pocket, and you're looking for a place where nobody knows your name--one that's open 24/7 for the sole purpose of satisfying your deep and immediate need for classic American diner fare--you could do worse than Pinecrest Diner.", "author": "Scott M."}

I stood back and waited longer as more and more after hours drunk people piled in. And as each party of \"pretty drunk girls\" stumbled in, they got a place to sit.

I ate fast because I saw the line at the door grow.  I couldn't exactly rush Gavin to eat but he ate as fast as he could based on my nudging.  He ate about 35% and I ate the rest.

This place is right on the corner of Geary & Mason St. It's a narrow diner, with booths lined up against the window. Typical diner styel menu, with a myriad of breakfast option, including huevos rancheros! Service was excellent and fast paced. My son ordered chocolate chip pancakes, my daughter got the french toast, my wife got an egg sandwich, and I got the huevos rancheros. The coffee, while not the best I ever had, was always being refilled. The food, when it came out, and rather quickly, I might add, was excellent. My son loved his pancakes, the french toast was tasty, my wife wasn't complaining, and the huevos rancheros were very good for being made north of the border. All in all, this place was fantastic.

Pinecrest may have been the inspiration for that painting.\n\nDespite having a burger three hours earlier but burned it off by walking at least five miles through the Streets of San Francisco (Chinatown, Financial district, Pier, and then back to Union Square area, I found myself famished at 9:30 PM.  A decent Yelp review and a huge menu lured me in.\n\nI was with a favorite colleague and we found a great two seat window table so we could watch the interesting night life go by.  We weren't disappointed, either by the scenery or the food.\n\nI ordered the hot Italian omelet smothered in chili.  A bit of a risk since I had to do a 5K run the next morning as part of the conference I was attending but had no ill effects. The omelet was huge and excellent.  It came your choice of bread and hash brown.  The 'browns were of the typical diner variety but cooked perfectly.\n\nElvis et,al might not have been in the building but the cook made up for it.

Our server basically told us that we could leave because he wouldn't seat us elsewhere, however, the manager caught him and quickly had us relocated as soon as a table freed up which we appreciated.\n\nHowever, not only was the food sub-par at best, but the service was very very slow, and our server was pretty rude (same guy as above) which made our experience at Pinecrest bad. We had ordered the mac and cheese, 2 types of omelettes, and the pork chop dishes all of which were either lacking in flavor or of bad quality.\n\nDespite being in a great (touristic) location, I would not return unfortunately. San Francisco is full of excellent food so don't worry about finding an awesome alternative in the area!", "author": "Noha G."}

This joint caught our eye because it was a.) A diner and b.) because it advertised as being open 24 hours a day. \n\nWhen you walk in, it's definitely a diner. Booth seating and bar top seating. The place is pretty small but we managed to find a lot of seats at the bar top. Our view were the cooks and the servers. Speaking of, the servers were a bit much. They were all over the place and really flustered. I do appreciate the positive attitudes though. They were super nice. It was just a little much with people running around. Aside from that, here's what I had: \n\n-Pinecrest Omelette for $10.95. Bacon, Ham, Sausage, Mushroom, Tomato & Cheese. This was a HUGE omelette, definitely worth the price. Lots of meat and cheese. I loved tomatoes and mushrooms as well, so this was on point. This dish was served with crispy hash browns. Great combination!\n\n-Side of Pork Sausages for $4.75. The side was served with 4 sausages and happened to be the same sausages in the omelette. It was good, nothing stellar, but definitely appreciate it at a diner. \n\nAll in all, I LOVE that this place is open at night and throughout the wee hours of the morning.

Cooking hash browns, home fries, hash, and the like are not easy to do. This crew was on point! The omelet was full, the hash browns were crisped to perfection, and the bacon... oooooh the bacon. Too many places skimp out on good bacon to save a few pennies while still charging a premium because of the word \"bacon\". This place is not the case. Not only was it thick and perfect, they laid the bacon on top of the hash browns occasionally. This did two things. First, prevented the bacon from over cooking and drying out. Second, the bacon grease helped season the hash browns. The whole process was a science. These guys were maestros of the spatulas. Oh by the way... there was a full house, a line out the door, and I got served in about 5 minutes after ordering. I was stunned. Hats off to them all.\n\nEDIT: Furthermore, I want to add that I will go on record to say that this is literally the best breakfast for the price that I have ever had.

I happened across this diner while walking to another diner close by so I stopped in. I was seated at the bar and waited patiently. I was offered a drink after about 5 min. 15 min goes by and I've not been able to place an order. Steak and eggs is a favorite anywhere I go.....  however, I watched the waiter take the order of two pretty young ladies who sat two seats down from me right away, and he still continued to pass me by. Another ten minutes and I just left. Not waiting more than thirty minutes before my order was even taken....Loris diner will work just fine for me. Thanks guys.

The outside world fades away.You've entered an epicurean time-warp.\n\nThe guy at the next seat is wearing a tweed jacket and saddle shoes and is that woman in the booth really wearing a little hat a gloves? Yes, she is.\n\nMy friend orders eggs, bacon, hash browns, the whole shebang. I just order corned beef hash (crisp), because I wanna see 'em sling it.\n\nWe sit there, gabbin'. Watching the chef ply the grill with plenty o potatoes and boatloads of bacon. \n\nNo-nonsense waitress lays down plates. Big plates. Full of food. Perfect, like from a your grandmother's Betty Crocker cookbook. The hash is crisp, just as ordered, yet still tender inside.

Of course, it's not gourmet and the food presentation seems a bit outdated, but I love getting their chicken fried steak and eggs. We've only tried a few other dishes but so far everything has been to our satisfaction. \n\nHowever if you get a booth by the window (which is a 50% chance of happening every time) I've experienced some creepy guys always knocking on the window and just.. staring. And they've always just done it at our table for some reason, whether they're drunk or just.. creepy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-30", "description": "So unbelievably disappointed. I was prepared all night to give the Pinecrest Diner at 401 Geary st a 5 star rating - the food was great (I love greasy diners), the staff EXTREMELY friendly and hospitable, the service punctual, informative and professional. So what's the one star for? Well, I'm a first-time visitor here in San Francisco. I just got off a 2 thousand mile Greyhound journey delayed by Texas blizzards and tornadoes (and I therefore probably do look a bit pasty). I had already spent a night at a hotel and I didn't want to spend more money on another night - so I thought I would kill two birds, checking out a 24 hr diner in town, while also working on a little writing and reading until my City bus tour at 11am. (And yes, I had a red gym bag with my belongings inside it - but I explicitly asked the host, before I sat down, whether this was welcome - and he told me it was OK!)\n\nBut because I'm not some bum who squats in businesses, I ordered about 30$ worth of food and drink throughout the night and tipped something like 22% (but maybe that's a low tip here in SF? Where I'm from that's considered mildly generous - I would have tipped more had I realized). And I was at pains to tell my waiter (who, from overhearing their conversation, I later found out is a rookie) and his co-workers several times throughout the night that, since I was alone, if they ever needed that table for a bigger party (there is limited space here - a fact about which I was conscious and considerate) they need only say so, and I would move back to the counter; that I was willing to order more food (and I said this in response to whispered comments I had overheard between the waiter and his superior about my not having already ordered more food - BUT THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE I WAS ASSURED BY THE PRECEDING SHIFT THAT THIS WAS UNNECESSARY - AND THEN I WAS ASSURED *ONCE AGAIN* BY MY WAITER, AFTER I OFFERED TO ORDER MORE FOOD AND SHOWED HIM MY MASTERCARD, THAT IT WAS UNNECESSARY TO ORDER MORE FOOD **AND THAT I WAS WELCOME TO STAY**) or even leave, if there was a problem with my hanging out like that. And I deliberately chose what is probably their worst table so I would not be a nuisance. (And I saw a homeless man practically bathing himself at a better-placed table by the window around 3am -  he wasn't given so much as an awkward glance, let alone the treatment I eventually received.) \n\nEverything was FINE until the shift-change came (and if it is their policy that overnight guests must leave before the shift-change then WHY THE FUCK was I not told beforehand?) and some balding, pink-shirted *ASSHOLE* - avoid this man at all costs if you do not want your Pinecrest experience spoiled; I was not the only person he was needlessly rude to (but I repeat: he was the exception not the rule) - abruptly walks up to me (I had already been planning to leave soon after ordering a coffee and breakfast to go) and says, you need to leave now because you're not ordering food. Then I say, but I did order food - and I was about to say that I'm perfectly willing to order more food, or even offer another tip to the waiters for being so great throughout the night - but before I could speak he cut me off and said, well that was 5 hours ago (NOT true - I had ordered a 15$ meal right before breakfast around 5 or 6am) and I want you out of here right now. He said this loudly, and rudely, in front of the ENTIRE diner. NEVER so embarrassed in my life. I was COMPLETELY stunned. It was NOT my fault, if overnight guests are not appreciated, that I was misinformed by some pasty-haired rookie and ignoramus.  I'm so angry right now I cannot keep my hands from shaking. I am now, and have been for about an hour, sitting across the street at Jack in the Box where no one has even looked at me funny for not ordering anything yet (though I will be ordering coffee and a Danish before I leave - BECAUSE I'M NOT A BUM) wishing I had come to this cheesy franchise instead of trying out what had been a very cool diner. \n\nIf someone from this business happens to come across this review and would like to offer an apology or at least a f****** explanation for this extraordinary treatment  today then I will duly reconsider this review and my rating - but unless and until that happens I will NEVER AGAIN come within a mile of this dump and I will warn off anyone who will listen.\n\n(And yes, I understand they have to be wary of homeless people. But considering how I payed, and the fact that I had a  highly priced smartphone - which they AGREED to charge for me - and a few relatively expensive articles of clothing - NOT trying to boast - I cannot fathom how I could possibly have been mistaken for a down-and-out. But anyway, WHY WASN'T I ASKED? I could very easily have shown that I am a tourist with spending money - which was one of the reasons I needed my phone charged. So that I could reload my MasterCard.

I ended up ordering the hashbrowns and my friend gets the chicken tenders and fries. \n\nThe chicken tenders taste like microwaved ones from the store and the fries were bland and somewhere between stale and limp. My hashbrowns were even worse. There was almost no crunchy portion and the WHOLE THING WAS YELLOW.

It's open 24 hours, has great friendly staff, great diner food, and large portions. What else could you ask for? It's become a go-to lunch spot for my coworkers and I.\n\nI'm dropping a star because it's a on the overpriced side for what you get. A diner omelette and coffee with nothing extra shouldn't run you over $20 with tips like they would here... It's just 3 eggs and some potatoes, man! I guess you can get away with it when you're placed right in the heart of touristville by Union Square.\n\nOverall a great place for breakfast/brunch though, and plenty of lunch and dinner options. Here are my top picks:\n\nSpanish Omelette: So good but VERY heavy - you need an immediate nap after that early meal. Comes with really tasty hash browns. My pick for their must-try menu item. Be warned that if you're a calorie-counter, you're probably out for the day (same goes for most items on that menu though, to be honest)!\n\nItalian Omelette: Real good too - also comes with hash browns. Meaty, yet surprisingly much lighter than the Spanish omelette.\n\nSouthwest Burger: Juicy, yummy, but fatty and sloppy. You immediately feel guilty after this oily bad boy.

Paid and threw it away after what I witnessed. Please someone get the cook a glove. Between all the raw meats and touching what I saw was at least 7 other orders of food.

There were four of us at the table and I was the only one not drinking coffee. When I got my bill, I noticed I was charged for one. I went up to the register and our same waitress rang me up. I explained how the coffee shouldn't be on my bill and she kept checking over to the table as if I was lying. Then she said to me \"Well, somebody is going to have to pay for the coffee.\" Um, obviously lady. Put the coffee on their bill. They drank it. After, another person from my party went up to pay for the remaining meals (and coffees!!). She scolded him about the coffee and thought we were trying to steal a freakin' coffee! Really, woman? You are going to be THAT stubborn over $2 when this place is booming with business. It's your mistake!

The Pinecrest Diner is open 24-h a day and offers a wide range of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options.  You can choose from any of their meal options anytime of the day.  I ended up being so pleased with my first visit that I found myself coming back at least four times over the next few days just to explore their ample menu.  Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything on their menu but I am going to single out their breakfast items because breakfast is my favorite meal and I often find it difficult to find places that don't charge an arm and a leg and deliver a high quality breakfast.   All their egg dishes come with the most delightful crispy and not at all greasy hash brown potatoes.  The omelets are all thoroughly cooked without being rubbery or dry.  The portions are truly generous and all of the omelets are 3-egg dishes.  Their pancakes are huge, fluffy and delicious even without the warm syrup that they serve with it.

But, I have always loved this place.\n\nI do not think I have ever been in the daytime.  It was close to my last apartment in San Francisco.  So, it was my designated late night spot for a burger or a breakfast.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/d6frl67\n\nI think they do a fine diner version of both.  The staff was always friendly to me.  I always found the diner to be clean.  I often here folks say it is dirty.  I just never really found that to be true.  But, then again, I may just be comparing it to the neighbourhood surrounding it.  Either way, it was never dirty enough to send me running.\n\nPlus, it is often populated with a clientele as colourful as the  Pincecrest's notorious past.\n\nI am sure that someday (ok some late night) I will find myself chowing down on a late night breakfast or burger again at Pincecrest Diner.  It is truly a San Francisco institution.", "author": "Mark D."}

What really bumped me off was the fact that although I ordered a patty melt 13.95$ that promised a 1/2 patty, when the dish arrived it was clear that it was only a 1/3 of a pound. And although a 1/6 of a pound difference might seem to some people as insignificant I felt disrespected and insulted. \n\nWhen I politely pointed out the fact to the waitress she indignantly denied it right away. She could at least check with the chef beforehand giving the customer the benefit of a doubt. At this point I need to stress that we didn't request any sort of rebate or discount when making our complaint and that we fully paid the check including tip.\n\nBeing in the bay area for a while I have eaten at The Counter enough times to know the difference between a 1/2 pound patty and a 1/3 and I believe that it is more likely that the owners of the restaurant are trying to squeeze some extra profit from tired, hang-over'd patrons late in the morning than us wanting to cause trouble after having a great night out.\n\n(So great that we even rejected cocaine when it was offered to us by a random girl).\n\nFriendly advice: go somewhere else if you want consistency in what you pay for and what you get.", "author": "Pari S."}

This was however, not enough reason to be allocated a 4 person table  when only the 2 of us were present. This nonsensical response came from the staff member after he asked his manager for what I can only assume was 'Guidance' in this particularly difficult mathematical conundrum.

The steak came with some lettuce, tomato, and a delicious mushroom/onion/cheese sautee. The sandwich came with a side of super garlicky fries. Overall, glad we didn't order an actual steak; any restaurant that can't get their steak temperatures right simply shouldn't serve it.\n\nCobb salad: Ordered based on the server's recommendation - a juicy grilled chicken breast over a bed of fresh crispy mixed greens, generous portions of fresh crumbled bacon and generous portions of bleu cheese, with cherry tomatoes, sliced avocados, and a hard-boiled egg on the side. I wasn't a fan of the dressing though, and was glad I asked for it on the side.\n\nOverall, solid diner experience after a night at the theater and a walk around Union Square taking pictures of the Christmas tree.", "author": "Linda F."}

Some of us weren't so hungry and were just chillin' while the others eat. \n\nThey have a $7 minimum per person, but since we were in a huge gropu and weren't all hungry, the waiter was really chill about it and let it slide. My table ended up getting two orders of onion rings and french toast (which they messed up and gave us pancakes...), bacon & eggs. Remember how I said I wasn't an onion rings kinda guy? Well damn, these are some of the best onion rings I've ever tasted! I don't know if it was the drunchies or what but they were deeeee-licious! I was really amazed how they were onion rings without an actual piece of onion in them!\n\nYou know what else comes with drinking? The need to pee. Their bathroom waaay downstairs is really clean. You can take a leak without feeling all grossed out...props!\n\nAnyway, back to the food. The food is pretty pricey (we spent $25ish on 2 orders of onion rings and the bacon/eggs/french toast dish), but damn if you're clubbing at Ruby Skye or Slide or whatever is nearby and you're drunk and looking for good food...you got Pinecrest Diner right there for ya.

We were waiting for some family to fly in for a wedding and all their flights got delayed so we were left to find somewhere to eat dinner just the two of us. We were staying nearby and since we had a long day of walking through what felt like every hill in San Francisco we wanted something quick and good. The concierge recommended Pinecrust. We showed up around 9pm and it wasn't that crowded. I'm thinking it was between the regular dinner crowd and drunk crowd so we sat right away. My wife ordered a Mexican salad and I the Reuben. Her salad was solid for being from a diner. My Reuben, might be one of the best I've ever had. The meat was great and they sure didnt skimp out on pulling it on. We both were in the mood for shakes so we both got chocolate shakes. We probably could have shared one, but we were hungry enough to finish our own. I'd personally go back again just to have the Reuben. I can't talk to any other item on the menu but solid food for what we ordered and the staff and what I assume was the manager was super friendly. Well don't Pinecrust.\n\nOnly reason I give them a 4 and not a 5 is cause for a diner its a lil pricey, but that also might be a product of being in prime San Francisco location.

I'm a social person who doesn't mind talking to creepy looking guys in food lines). The locals gave me a run down on every diner in the area and why this one was the best. They told me to get an omelette and then go back to my hotel for a nap because I would be stuffed after.\n\nThey were right. The Greek omelet with spinach, tomato and feta cheese made with egg whites was yummy! Flavor in every bite.\n\nI also tried my friends Denver omelet. Yum. \n\nWhile the line out the door might seem daunting, it moved quickly.

It was fairly empty, so I presumed I had my choice of booths. There was certainly no sign to ask me to wait to be seated. When I sat down in one of the front booths and started to take my jacket off, I was told summarily to get up and take the solo booth next to the front door. I did what I was told.\n\nAs I sat in the smaller booth, I noticed a gust of cold wind would hit me when anybody came in or out of the door. My napkin would fly from my lap to the floor every single time. I ordered. I ate. I was ignored for coffee refills because I was completely out of sight from the waitress. Meanwhile, two individual diners came through the door. The same two waitresses who dictated where I sat told each of the two men to sit wherever they like. Each sat in their own large-size booths.\n\nWhen I was finally given the check after being forced to flag her down, I fumbled for my cash and found I had just the amount for the check plus one penny. I then decided to write a helpful note on the check for the waitress...\n\n\"Dear Waitress,\n\nI am unclear why you forced me to sit in this lousy booth when you let two single-person diners sit wherever they wanted - including the booth in which I first sat.

It's nothing fancy, and nothing exciting it is just standard well made American style food. The burgers are great compared the fast food joint, the salad is fresh, the chicken is made to order, omelets choices are endless.

The busman (he was not a \"boy\") was one of the most industrious individuals I have ever watched work. \n\nI was most pleased with my ham & egg scramble with hashbrowns...the ample portion of sourdough toast threatened to steal the show from the entree.

I wish we had gone somewhere else.\n\nThe diner looks nice (they finished a remodeling).  When we walked in, we were the only customers in the place, but it got busy right afterwards.  This confused our poor waiter and the cooks.  We ordered the split pea soup, which was delivered promptly and was quite good.  Then we waited forever for a salad and hamburger.  We could see that the cook was confused by the orders (he didn't speak or read English apparently, so someone else had to tell him what was going on).  \n\nThe hamburger was overcooked and not very big for the price, and they use processed swiss cheese instead of the real thing.  The fries were cooked fine, but unseasoned.  The salad arrived after the burger, and we never did get the onion rings (but they didn't appear on the bill, so I guess the waiter missed it when ordering).\n\nIt wasn't a horrible meal, but it wasn't a good one, either.

My sandwich came with two eggs on a large hoaggie roll rather than a hard round roll. They use what I call \"plastic cheese,\" that McDonalds style overprocessed cheddar instead of the real stuff.

I've been to this place at 2am and there are still a few tables being taken up. People here are nice and friendly and you can have a good time just watching the passersby. I usually go for the eggs and ham, and they do serve a generous slice of ham. In the afternoons, I go for the cheeseburgers with fries.

Have to concur with an earlier reviewer that the hash browns are excellent (read: crispy and slathered in butter/grease) and my omelet completely hit the spot.  Partner had the Spanish omelet and raved about it - hidden under salsa with half an avocado and a squirt of sour cream.  Myself, I found it rather bland.  Food came up quickly.  You pay at the counter.  Prices were tourist-level.  \n\n...and we went back the next day.  I know, my poor liver!  But it was that good...  Me, Denver again but with cheddar, him Spanish.

Some of their sandwiches are better than ones you get in nicer restaurants. I absolutely LOVE their omelets, portions are huge and the ingredients are all fresh. I guess one thing I really like about Pinecrest is they use really fresh ingredients which is not a norm for diners. My usual dish here is the chicken pesto, I can only eat half of it on a good day as it is huge but every time the chicken breast has been juicy and full of flavor, grilled to perfection. For the first time we tried the spaghetti, and as another yelper mentioned it was pretty darn good. The sauce is pretty meaty with mushrooms and doesn't taste like it was canned/acidic. Awesome salads too! \nI give it 5 stars only for food, obviously you can't expect the best service or ambiance but for a diner it deserves all the stars.", "author": "Shell S."}

And although I work a 9-to-5 in Berkeley and do pub trivia every Wednesday, we're always able to squeeze in a respectable dinner in between the closing bell and the general-knowledge round.\n\nIt's always nice to have a 24-hour place near Union Square (I would say the Tenderloin, which might be technically true, but I don't want to scare you), and while this place could be an absolutely disgusting dive and still do well, it's actually really nicely appointed and clean.  The service is usually slow, but that's because one person is working the entire restaurant plus the cash register.  I can also do without the TVs, but they kind of fade into the background, especially if you're seated facing away from the front door.\n\nThe menu is OK.  Aside from breakfast, there are only a few vegetarian options, but again, it's better than you expect it to be.  The salads in particular are well proportioned, and the Italian dressing tastes good (although it's sometimes kind of lumpy).\n\nI think the booths are moleskin, which used to bother me until I learned that moleskin isn't made from moles' skin anymore, but there might be some leather as well, and that bothers me in a very mild way, like a baby crying in a room four doors down the hall.\n\nWhen you're here, be sure to stand underneath the awning--unless it's raining.  See, it's a purely decorative awning; there's a custom-cut hole in the top to allow a second-floor fire-escape ladder to be lowered to the sidewalk.  I don't think I've ever seen anything like that before.\n\nUPDATE:  4/28/11\n==============\n\nI'm knocking Pinecrest Diner down a star because its restrooms are completely wheelchair inaccessible.  They're clean, and they're really fun to find, and they have black toilets (!), but they still discriminate against wheelchair users.", "author": "John S."}

Complain that I have to go into a scary dungeon maze to reach the bathroom from hell? I wouldn't dare.\n\nI will do as I did today and sit quietly and meekly at the counter and wait the 6 short minutes for my BLT, piled high with bacon that is the perfect combination of crispy and chewy, and my freshly-fried fries that are crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside.\n\nOh, and while I'm waiting, I'll pretend I can't see that guy in the back scraping a greasy mess off the grill pan.

I happened upon the Pinecrest Diner and decided to give it a try. I am really glad I did! The service was fast and friendly, the counter was clean. It was one of those rare days in SF when it was warm, so sitting at the counter was a little toasty, but since it's usually cold in SF, I find that to be a good thing. \n\nI ordered the pastrami sandwich and fries. I forgot to mention that I wanted cheddar cheese on my sandwich, and the owner/manager? took it back and added my cheese no problem. The pastrami was first-rate in fact some of the best I have ever tasted and the fries were done to perfection. \n\nSo why am I giving this place five stars? I have eaten at many other places in and around Union Square, spent 5 to 10 times as much money but never in that neighborhood have I had a meal that was so perfectly what I wanted and so perfectly made. Check it out if you are in SF and want a tasty reasonably priced meal. \n\nPS The breakfasts (served all day) look fantastic. I will try one next time!", "author": "Corey S."}

So I avoided the wait for a seat but still sat around for about 25 minutes to get my breakfast. The price was not very good either but probably not too out of line for the Union Square area of San Fran - I paid over $15 for two fried eggs (with toast and hash browns) and orange juice. That's about 2 times what I pay in downtown Denver at Sam's #3. So how was the food?  Acceptable to good. The sourdough toast was good, but it's San Francisco so it darn well better be!!!

My friends and I did not think to ask the waitress, who was clearly very rushed, to split the check before receiving it. When my friends and I approached the cash register to split the check we were told \"I'm too busy for that, you should have told me earlier\". Really? As the customer, you are saying that it is my responsibility to inform you of splitting the check with no signage insinuating that you do not regularly split checks? You didn't think that five people in there mid twenties would want to pay for their own stuff? Again, if there was a heads up or signage insinuating that this was the case then I would understand, but we did not have cash and I think it's pretty cruddy to think it's your customers job to tell you right up front that we need to split the checks.

I was getting some last minute Christmas shopping done in Downtown so I wanted a quick bite before i start. Came in around 6:05PM and the place was kind of empty, but did fill up fast as it gets towards 6:30. I ordered a bacon omelette which was not great, I've had better ones else where... I did corded my boyfriend the Reuben Sandwich, which is sliced corned beef. He said it was really good. \n\nI would come back again since they serve a big variety of food, from breakfast to pasta, sandwich and stuff.", "author": "Jenny G."}

No coffee refills ever found their way to our table, the food was so bland and minimalistic it might as well have come out of a box, and the check was slammed on our table before we were even halfway through our disappointing breakfast. \n\nI got the eggs and ham, boyfriend got Belgian waffle and eggs combo plate. His plate was $11, but came with one waffle and one egg, both unceremoniously dumped on a plate with a sad little syrup container on the side. My eggs were done perfectly but the ham tasted like it had been frozen and unfrozen throughout the ages. Shit tasted old and funky. \n\nIt's open 24 hours, but I know for a fact they will frown and scowl if you go there super late at night (early in the morning? Whichever, take your pick) and order something small like coffee and a slice of pie. You'd think they'd be stoked to at least make some money without having to really dirty anything up--it's a pre-made slice of pie and a pot of coffee you've had on since 5am. What's the big deal?\n\nAnyway, I guess if you're downtown somewhere and Lori's is too busy to accommodate you (doubtful) this is a less-than-stellar option.

Our party of four was seated instantly and our friendly waitress was taking our drink orders within a minute or two. I went traditional - Denver omelet, hash browns, toast. Hard to mess that up and they didn't. The food was out fast and in my belly even faster. More time for us to rehash the previous night's events. It was after all, a \"mancation,\" as my buddy's wife called it. Four guys in SF for the weekend to catch a game, eat and drink. Somehow, none of us were terribly hungover and we weren't missing any body parts. We've either become pros at drinking or we're getting old. I'm guessing the latter.\n\nSummary - solid diner, a bit pricey for what it is but you're in SF, suck it up. And if you use the restrooms downstairs, pick the one on the right.

I've been here on a Tuesday afternoon- amazing sandwiches. Saturday night/ Sunday morning post club outing- amazing and sobering hash browns, sourdough toast ( I mentioned I loved carbs, right?), and perfectly crispy bacon. Every time I've been here the service is great, and they're always packed. If you have a complaint tell the manager on duty and they'll do anything to make it better. I needed a straw and this pretty lady behind the register, I think her name was Sylvia, noticed I needed something and came and helped me; she had been dealing with an ATM problem but left it to help me. So nice! \n\nThey recently revamped their menus, so now they have healthier options available. I've been to the Lori's diner across the street, enh it was like mall diner food, ie not very good- even when drunk. The Pinecrest also has good prices, especially for being one block away from Union Square. It would be someplace I wouldn't mind eating at a few times if I was on a travel budget. \n\nCurrently they're under going renovations but I was told they'll open this Wednesday. I can't wait to see the new building and design. It'll def be better than the old 60's-ish diner vibe that it had before. \n\nDear Pinecrest, expect to see me soon.

After spending almost three hours on a train or bus, all we wanted was some really solid, delicious breakfast at a comfortable diner.\n\nTo our sore disappointment, we got neither.\n\nFirst of all, the actual place was unbearably cramped. We were seated in a booth right next to the door and not really in the \"main\" area. With the tubs of dirty dishes and greasy aprons all around us, I didn't feel at peace, which is what I expect at a traditional diner.\n\nI ordered the Pinecrest Special because I have to judge every diner by its standard buttermilk pancakes. My friend got the Denver Omlet, which he said was decent. He also praised the hash browns. However, the pancakes were atrocious. They were chewy, flabby, and not fluffy at all. Non-fluffy pancakes will be the death of me one day. Even cutting them was a pain because the pancakes just had a terrible time separating, whether by knife or teeth. As for the rest of the dish, there really isn't any way to go wrong with eggs. Bacon was nice and crisp without any burnt parts. I don't enjoy breakfast sausage anyway, so I couldn't judge those. But the pancakes. God, the pancakes. I was nearly delirious with exhaustion and the pancakes stabbed a fork through my stomach.\n\nThe service seemed to be strangely poor towards me and my friend. It was at least ten minutes until we were asked by a busboy for drinks, and he couldn't take our our actual orders (ten minutes is quite a long time to decide for breakfast). Another five minutes went by until the actual server brusquely came over. Other people (like the people sitting behind us) somehow got near-immediate service, so I'm not sure what was up with that.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving this place two stars instead of one is because the people seem to be decent. I left a bag of things I bought from Black Friday, and when I ran back ten minutes later, the server calmly pointed me to behind the counter, where she had stashed it.\n\nStill a disappointing experience.", "author": "Lawrence L."}

She wasn't very helpful at all.  \n\nWe ordered the pork chops and eggs - chops were flavorless, no salt, no pepper, no seasoning - basically a chop out of the package and thrown on the grill. I had the basic breakfast of eggs, hash-browns and bacon which were just ok. \n\nOur bill was over $45 for 3 small and average breakfast dishes. This place is overpriced, has terrible service and not very clean. Don't know how or why anyone would recommend this place.", "author": "Steve S."}

This is an important thing to note as many all-night diners are notorious for cranky waitstaff. \n\nMy favorites? The mozzarella sticks, the chicken pesto sandwich, and the milkshakes. \n\nThe Pinecrest is infamous in local lore as the spot where, in 1997, a cook shot a waitress, by some accounts over an argument the previous day after the waitress admonished him for agreeing to make a customer poached eggs, which aren't on the menu.

When we first walked the front door it was broken off the hinges and hanging on the side of the diner. Our wait was only about 5 min for a table and we were stoked but when we sat at the table it was soo cold from the front door being broken I had to get my kids jackets to eat during out meal. We sat for about 25 min before I flagged someone down to ask for hot coffee and milk for my kids; I quickly received them.  We waited another 15 min to get a waitress to take our order and I ordered two meals for my kids and she asked if that was all; we had four people at our table.  I ordered the new york steak and eggs and my husband ordered the corned beef hash and eggs; and two pinecrest specials for the kids at $11.00 a plate.  The kids meals came out after about 15 min and the adult meals came out like 10 min later.  The steak was tender and completely flavorless, the food got so cold soooo fast due to the front door being broken and then cold wind blowing in the diner. We had to ask for napkins and water, the customer service was horrible; no smiles, no greeting, and she didn't check to see how our food was or if we needed anything.  I had to get up to the register to pay the bill since she never came back. To feed two adults and a 3 and 8 year old it cost $56.00 for a bunch of crap.  Save your money and go elsewhere.\nThe bathroom were down three flights of stairs and stunk like urine, my 3 year old son used the toilet (sitting) and when a grossed out look on his face asked what the smell was; I told him pee pee and he said Ewww.

The passenger had him drive up to Washington Street, where he was paid for the trip in a currency of hot lead.\n\nThere are some that believe that the Zodiac ate here before he took the cab ride of infamy. Local legend says that for years, a zodiac message could be seen in the basement. This may or may not be true, as that I did see something that could either be by the murderer or just someone with a warped sense of humor. In either case, it was painted over a few months later. As a matter of fact, any Zodiac-related graffiti, especially in the men's bathroom is a sure-fire way to get them to paint the walls practically overnight.\n\nBut make no doubt about, just because SF's most infamous free-lance executioner might have patronized this establishment does not mean that you or anyone outside of being an insane masochist should dine here. Here's why:\n\n1. Wait staff with bad attitudes.\nI don't know if it's the borderline location to both the Tenderloin and Union Square, but if you look the least bit \"alternative\" (aka freakish), chances are, your service will be slow to non-existent. Don't expect service with a smile. Forced endurance with a scowl would be a closer descriptive, as the waitress tosses the menu practically at you (if you ever get that far).\n\n2. Bland to mediocre cooking.\nI guess the theater crowd, who seem to be the only people who keep this farce of a diner from going under, either have no food taste, or will eat anything when they are food-slumming after a show. In either case, the food is bland, generic, and far overpriced.\n\n3. Sanitary Conditions.\nWhile vermin aren't noticeable, other factors are. Let's just say that cleanup policies are \"relaxed.\" The last time I stopped in, most of the tables were in dire need of being cleared off and/or wiped down, and remained that way the entire meal.\n\nSo if you must stop in, be it for Zodiac folklore or for  the kitchen poached-egg murder, just order a soft-drink, better yet a cup of coffee, or tea or something that's been boiled.

But, what she said next with an agitated face just shocked me.\n\"You have to order $7 minimum for each, or leave\"\n\nThe moment she said \"leave\", I felt very offended and instantaneously stood up and left.\n\nWhat an unprofessional service!!  Before I started my current career, I was a waiter at the restaurant with a certain policy.  Sometimes, we encountered customers who did not meet the requirement.  But we always did our best to make ends meet, because those customers are there to enjoy our food and services.\n\nThe waitress/waiter are big part of the team in the restaurant business.\nThis waitress deserves only 1 star, then this restaurant deserves only 1.", "author": "Yoshi D."}

The pastrami was tough and gristly, the cheese was not melted.  Iris got chocolate chip pancakes.  They do not put the chocolate chips into the pancake batter.  Instead they throw a handful of chips atop the finished pancakes and add $2 to the bill.  Their ham is poor quality, with lots of water added; perhaps it came out of a can.  Their coffee was sour and watery.   \n\nWe went there looking for an alternative to the expensive hotel breakfast.  Big mistake.  Cheese omelet, two pancakes with chocolate chips, reuben, side of ham, and two cups of coffee cost $47.  The expensive hotel breakfast would  have been cheaper and ten times better.  \n\nService was indifferent.  The food did not come quickly, and my request for extra napkins went unheeded, even though the baby had spilled water on the table.  The restaurant was only half-full, but the staff acted as if they were slammed.\n\nI did not visit the bathroom.  Lorrie came back from there and said that it was best left undescribed.\n\nHow can this place survive?

I knew something was not adding up so I picked up another menu where the burger price had been hand written in at 11.95. So I politely asked the server (a big man with a fedora and facial hair) why I had to pay the 11.95 when the menu that was given to me stated otherwise. He called me a dick in front of all other customers told me it was only a dollar more. Asked me to pay and to get the fuck out. He even told me that he would remember me next time I came in. (As if I will come back again after his trashy behavior) . The staff there are all crooks and obviously are hot headed and classless. I warn everyone.

It is a little diner right off of Union Square, and has delicious breakfast food!  We went around 11am and it was still busy, but we sat down at the counter, and even a party of 6 was seated within 10 minutes!  Pretty awesome!  We sat on the counter right in front of the grill and were able to see all of the pancakes, bacon, and golden hash browns being prepared and I have to say the delicious smells coming 2 feet from us were making us salivate!  I got the short stack of chocolate chip pancakes and a side of hash browns, while my boyfriend got the Pinecrest Special, which included 2 pancakes (add toppings - fresh fruit or chocolate chips for $2 extra), 2 pieces of bacon or sausage, and 2 eggs any style.  The chocolate chip pancakes were excellent with just the right amount of chocolate chips.  They put chocolate chips in the batter AND sprinkle them on top!!  I also asked for some whipped cream, and the waitress sprayed it right on top of my pancakes...DELISH!!  My hash browns were perfectly golden brown and crispy on top and soft on the inside.  I tried some of the bacon, and I have to say it was nice to see that they make the bacon to order (because I saw it happen in front of me), and you could taste the difference.  The bacon was perfectly salty and crisp!  My boyfriend also ordered chocolate milk, which was disappointing because it came out kind of warm, and the waitress put the glass of milk in a cup of ice to \"cool it down\" but of course it didn't do anything.

And there is a time and a place for fancy grilled cheese (I prefer mine w/ fresh mozza, roma tomatoes and focaccia) but sometimes you need the real shit. Pine Crest has the real shit. And for that, I love them.", "author": "Maria D."}

We should've known not to go in after the homeless guy outside the door recommended that it was \"quick and tasty\" and that when he was able to accumulate enough change he would go in for a bite to eat. \n\nI ordered the Pinecrest omelet with egg whites and a glass of grapefruit juice. The omelet had bacon, sausage, and ham with toast and hash browns on the side. The grapefruit juice was pretty tasteless - neither sweet nor sour. The omelet was very watery; I had to soak up all the water with my napkin. The toast was over buttered for my taste because I like to have spread jelly on my toast. \n\nI would not come here again; once is more than enough.", "author": "D L."}

It has been a few years between visits, looks the same but the faces of the employees have changed, no big supprise there. The place was clean and service good. The food, great, nothing to fancy we both had burgers and they arrived quickly, all the bits were fresh and tasty the burgers were cooked as requested, the fries were fresh and crisp and the beer was cold, what more can you ask.\n\nIf you are looking for high end culinary fare this is not it, there are plenty of other places to fill that bill in this fine city. But if you are looking for a burger in a relaxed diner atmosphere then this fits the bill. Speaking of bill, 2 burgers, 2 beers, tax and tip $38.

After reading the admittedly entertaining, but markedly negative reviews of the Pine Crest, I almost didn't go -- but the pull of Yet Another San Francisco Story drew me in, and so my partner and I found ourselves there at 10:30 pm on a Sunday.  Apparantly this is the perfect time to give the place custom, 'cause neither of us had a single complaint. My grilled cheese was close to melty cheese and toasted bread perfection, my partner's hash browns (despite the warnings that we'd have to blot the grease off of them) were cooked perfectly and not too greasy at all.  Admittedly, my salad was more what you'd expect from a diner in the Mid-West, but overall I was happy.

When I went with some friends we waited and waited and waited to get a seat. Plenty of people had finished eating, but they also had to play the waiting game with the staff. During our entire meal they were totally non-existent which is too bad because I would have liked to have told someone about how horrible their food was. I have never complained about food in my life, but when I get charged 10$ for the inedible dog-food and processed slice of cheese they call a chili-burger it can get a fella a little upset. Everyone elses food looked equally horrifying, So I guess just now what you are getting yourself into and don't order anything outside of normal breakfast fare.", "author": "Nick L."}

Three of the waitresses there, especially one are supernice (one knows that I like a side of bleu cheese with my fries).  You can get seafood to breakfast food and if you tell them how to make it, they'll do it right.  My fav is the grilled cheese and fries.  I also like the cheesburger and fries. They have generous portions and the fries are amazing (they had a brief stint with some bad fries for about a month, but they changed back and it's been all good in the hood since). Best thing is they're open all the time. food comes out FAST too. Also, you can see them cooking so there's a trust issue.  yeah, it's not Lori's or Mason's and thank the Lord almight for that.

It was midnight and I was sober enough to order safe. I was served the worst grilled ham and cheese in the history of the United States. Unfortunately, I wasn't sober enough to realize that stopping and losing the $7.95 would have been a better choice than continuing to choke it down. Good news, it only takes 4 hours to totally digest their grilled ham and cheese, so you will be ready for breakfast. Luckily, one of my friends wasn't as sober, and ordered a bowl of chili. Generic canned chili with giant strips of onion and a stack of American Cheese food cut into cubes floating in the grease. Seeing those giant striated blocks of yellow wax slowly melting into his chili made me feel much more content with my frighteningly bad sandwich.

You got your eggs, omlettes, bacon, ham steaks, burgers and hashbrowns flung around all in what seems to be controlled chaos.  Yesterday I came by for take out since my hotel down the block wanted like $25 for eggs (the Clift - I'll be yelping about this place too).  I ordered two eggs over medium and hash browns.  They were perfect.   So today when I had more time, I decided to sit at the counter and enjoy the vibe of this real diner.  For breakfast I had their house omlette (mushrooms/ tomato/american cheese) with egg whites only and asked for them to add spinach.  It was delicious and the hash browns were perfect.  If there was anything to complain about it was that it was HUGE.  No one person could've eaten the whole thing.  All of the ingredients were fresh from the perfectly cooked mushrooms and spinach to the tomatos that had been chopped and seperated from all of their juices to make sure the omlette didn't get watery.
