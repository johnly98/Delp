{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-25", "description": "Referred by a friend, I chose to order off the menu for a family dinner for four at home.  Like me, she is local, growing up in the City and familiar with all the old staple restaurants that the \"Lo Wah Kue\", long-time immigrants, would know and loved.  Having a similar palate, I trusted her recommendation of trying this sleepy spot in the Sunset right on the L streetcar line.  She painted a picture of their ox tail dish in my mind that made me bookmark this place on my 'to try' list.  On a recent Saturday evening, here's what I ordered:\n\n1) West Lake beef soup - Hard to do wrong and all elements were there especially not being too thick.  Parents were too hungry to wait for my camera to click this one.\n\n2) Ox tail in wine sauce (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Main reason for coming here.  Loved that they use the smaller pieces which are more tender.  The wine sauce with onions and carrot chunks are great with rice.\n\n3) Pei Pa Tofu (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=ihu84OYnESDwsPUyulq8QA&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Seeing photos from other reviews, I ordered this.  Tasty deep fried tofu balls mixed with ham pieces.  The broccoli was perfectly cooked, still crunchy yet cooked.  Like the ox tail, the gravy/sauce on this pairs well with rice.\n\n4) Surf clam (3) stir fry with bean sprouts, chives, and ginger (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3p1poDDbf7X6cu5PJ84AAg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Ordered this by mistake, wanting the traditional steamed open shell version with vermicelli, this was just okay.  The clam flavors were dominated by the ginger and bean sprouts. Will make sure to order correctly the next time.\n\n5) Fook-chow style fried rice (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=8FNzmS4DZQsvQQZpA6sxHg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Decent version of this 'wet' fried rice though more of a poor man's version with the main ingredients being shrimp, chicken, shiitake mushrooms, and Chinese broccoli slices (gai lan).  The true version usually includes dried and/or bay scallops which were MIA here.  Again, the sauce was nicely done.\n\nIf you grew up on the '60's and '70's in San Francisco's Chinatown community, you'll remember that rice and gravy was extremely popular, meeting two big requirements:  a) filling and b) flavorful.  The cooking style here fits that profile based on the dishes that our family tried.  The dining room is average in size with about four large banquet size tables and six or seven four-seat tables.  At around 5 pm on a Saturday, there were four or five occupied tables already.  The cashier was kind and efficient in accepting my payment and packing my meal.  Based on these dishes, I would rate the food 3.5 stars, adding 0.5 star for satisfying my family's tastes.", "author": "Mike C."}

Based on the way it looks, I would have never walked in here, and my friends never mentioned this place, and for good reason. \n\nI was with my worker doing some light construction jobs nearby, and he brought me here for lunch. He ordered some beef stew with rice dish & I ordered Mongolian Beef w/ rice. My dish was sweet, and not a bit of spicy kick that I come to expect from all the years that I've had this elsewhere. There were no peppers at all. His beef stew dish appeared dull & gray. I tried a couple of bites and the beef was tough, bland & very chewy. They used the cheapest parts of the cow. (at least I hope it caem from a cow)\n\nThis restaurant strikes me as a place for Chinese contractors and mechanics to get a quick, cheap lunch. The guy who brought me here also knew some guys at another table that looked like they were taking a break from doing remodeling work. \n\nI'm not sure about the other menu items but our lunch experience was enough to help me decide I am not coming back.

When we saw a line coming out the door, we knew this was not going to be the day.  We were too hungry.\n\nSo with so many Chinese restaurants on Taraval, and not having a particular fave, we let the proximity of parking (which is VERY tricky in these parts) determine which one we picked.  For something so random, Ming's turned out so much better than we expected.  My husband had the Szechuan chicken on the lunch and I got the vermicelli with duck and snow cabbage.  We both started off with the soup, which didn't look very inviting, but turned out tasting like cabbage borscht, in a good way.  Both portions were large, and although it hadn't been our original intent, we ended up sharing both.\n\nMine was a little bland, but the noodles were a perfect texture.  I am suspicious that it was not duck, though.  Tasted more like chicken, and I didn't see anything that looked like what I imagined snow cabbage would look like, but I enjoyed it especially with some Szechuan chicken and it's very flavorful sauce mixed in.  The chicken by itself was a little too strong, although I didn't object to any of the flavors, it was just too much sauce for the amount of chicken, so perfect on intensity when mixed with my vermicelli.  We spent a total of $15, including tax and tip; can't beat that! \n\n I loved that we were the only non Chinese there.  There were lots of interesting items I'd like to go back and try.  It wasn't until after I left that I read Yelp and saw they specialize in vegetarian.  Also, there was a separate menu (all in Chinese) that was given out to most of the other tables (but not us).  I wonder what was on it?  I saw the Dragon Balls on some one else's table and wondered what they were.  I would definitely try those!, and after Ken K.'s description, I would definitely try the #147 clay pot.\n\nIt was really a 3.5 for me at this point, but I'll round up anticipating the good things I've yet to try.", "author": "Diane B."}

They have live seafood so that makes up for the lack of flavors on some of the dishes.", "author": "Cindy T."}

The kids used to always complain why we can't eat anywhere else, but Mr. Daniel is very talkative, gets along with our family, and we have tried so much on their menu that they can recite it to us.  For a quick appetizer, we order the Green Onion Chinese Pancake.  My favorite dish is the fried pork chops, and the fish and corn.  Also really like the sticky rice stuffed in chicken.  Takes a while for it to come out of the kitchen, but eventually it will come.\n\nEver since Chinese New Year's when I visited w/ the boys, this place is not as common a dining place as it used to.  The boss lady decided to let all her acquaintances pass us up in line, and we waited for a good hour, and still weren't seated.  What was suppose to be 15 min, turned into 60 min.  So for Chinese New Year, we had to take our party of 4 (party of FOUR) somewhere else.  Kept a distaste in our mouths for the restaurant.\n\nHalf of the family still went for dinners and lunches, but a new bus boy spilled a pot of tea on one of them, which might be common to new bus boys (but I don't know), so I think it was time for us to take our business elsewhere.\n\nNonetheless, I miss eating here, miss the food.

Since we were a huge party, we were told to sit on the second floor.\n\nAt first, we did not receive any service at all!  I had to walk downstairs to grab menus for my family after we waited 5 minutes.  After 10 more minutes of waiting, finally 1 server came to our table.  My family decided to order 8 dishes to try.\n\nI think its pretty cool that we were given complimentary 'green onion pancake' and 'beef soup' while we waited for our main dishes.  The pancake was crispy but a bit oily.  The soup was ok.  \n\nWe ordered the following dishes:\n\n1. fried tofu balls with broccoli and enoki mushrooms - the fried tofu balls was very tasty.  It was not bland, and I thought there was ham mixed inside the ball.\n\n2. fried flounder - The flounder is fried till its very crispy!  Then soy sauce is poured on top of it.  The fish was very good and not dry.\n\n3. stir fry spinach - it was bland, so I didn't like it\n\n4. quail claypot - I didn't try this\n\n5. steamed black bass - the fish was super small!  It was so tiny that 1 person can totally finish this.  I didn't try this either.\n\n6. veggie claypot - there was various types of tofu in here.  I liked this dish\n\n7. seafood claypot - I didn't try this dish\n\n8. soy sauce chicken - the chicken was diced up into many tiny pieces.  The chicken was tender and it tasted great with the sauce.\n\nAfter all the dishes came out, we really didn't see the server anymore.  To get any service, we literally had to walk downstairs to get the waiter.  We were given complimentary 'red bean dessert'.  This was good and not too sweet.\n\nOverall, Ming's Diner has ok Chinese food.  I found a lot of the dishes to be a bit oily.

I was a bit puzzled by the name since I had never been to a Chinese diner before and decided to give it a try.  Everything on the lunch menu was in the $5-6 range so I decided it was easily worth a try and was pretty happy to be getting out of the cold weather just beyond the doors of the diner.\n\nThere were many specials on the menu but I craved beef chow fun on this especially chilly San Francisco day.  Before my entr\u00e9e arrived, I was served a large bowl of chicken soup with Chinese spices.  It was extremely invigorating and warmed my body as I prepared to scarf down some pan fried noodles.  Although not exceptional, the beef chow fun was pretty good and about par for the course of what you might expect for $5.  The portion size was extremely impressive and I actually found myself having trouble finishing it and even considered taking it home for dinner.  However, knowing I would be heading to an internet caf\u00e9 afterward to get some work done, I persevered and was able to finish every last bite.\n\nMing's is definitely a great place to grab lunch if you happen to be in the Sunset.  The prices are right, the portions are huge, and you just can't beat the quick and upbeat service, especially considering that it's just one of those \"cheap Chinese places\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-15", "description": "After reading a few reviews on this place, I discovered that many ABC's (American Born Chinese!) like me have memories of this place growing up.  Whether it be good or bad, many of those memories follow the lines of themselves when they were younger sitting at a table of  two or more generations of their family and sharing a meal together.  I recall eating here with my family when we visited my great grandmother who used to live in the area.  Among those times we ate here, I can recall other tables of the same dynamic of son/daughter, mother/father, grandmother/father, and maybe a great grandmother/father added in there as in my case.  This place reminds me of those memories as they were fond and happy times.  That was a time where only play was in constant thought and responsibility was out of the picture.\n\nNow I'm all grown up and I still come here time to time.  I eat here less for dinner, rather come here for lunch, or get lunch take out.  I usually order entrees like Hong Kong style pan fried noodles, chicken (Because I already eat too much beef) chow fun, or Singapore noodles.  These are all items typical of an ABC.  The food here is on the greasy side at times even when you ask them to cut down on it.  The MSG is obvious; let's not kid ourselves.  Now if you take those two things out, greasy and MSG, out of the equation which shouldn't be a surprise for you as a customer anyway, the food is unquestionably good for their prices.  It's not dirt cheap, but its close.  The portions are a very good size.   \n\nThe service is what you call \"to the point\".  The servers with their black vests that should have been dry-cleaned a decade ago are quite abrasive, but they're honest.  They'll offer a suggestion sometimes, and the veteran waiter of the group is pretty funny.  He's an older gentleman with a slender build and loud voice.  You can't miss him.  I don't know how long this group of workers has been together, but it seems like a while.  Also, if you don't speak Cantonese (or Chingrish in my case), ordering shouldn't be a real problem.        \n\nI would recommend these two things since these two are personal favorites of mine from here: \"fried sticky rice chicken\" and their \"one fish two style dish combo\".  You're wondering why I have these in quotes.  It's because I don't know the English translation, but I'm sure if you use the following descriptions, they'll know what to make for you.  The sticky rice chicken comes in a form of an actual whole fried chicken with sticky rice sandwiched between the crispy skin above and the meat of the chicken on the bottom.  The first sight of the presentation will catch your eye.  Not every Cantonese restaurant may have it, and this place makes it pretty good.  The other involves a rock cod (or any other fish) special many other restaurants have as well that uses one fish and allows you to customize how they are cooked into two entrees.  They don't make it the best, but I enjoy it every time I get it. \n\nAre you looking for old school home style Cantonese food and you're in the Sunset area?  This is the place.  The food, feel, and look of everything in the restaurant fits the bill of an old school Cantonese restaurant.", "author": "Arnold T."}

They've had the same staff for many years (I'm assuming it is a family business), and they are all extremely friendly and nice. They have excellent customer service, always bringing out food prompt and quick on refills of tea. The staff always thanks you for coming enthusiastically, which is just a nice touch in my opinion.\n\nThe food is standard Cantonese family style dining. Like some others have said they are supposed to serve good vegetarian dishes like the sign says, but overall they serve a wide variety of standard Cantonese dishes - all of them, even the vegetarian of high quality.\n\nMy family just went here last night and we had a set menu for $80 plus maybe two dishes al la carte. The bill came out to about $100 I think for 9 people - we had oysters, black bean clams, fried shrimp, a sizzling beef platter, scallops with vegetables, oxtail stew (very good), a whole crab dish, and I think another dish or so that elludes my memory right now. The portions are EXTREMELY generous I must add, and although our party killed the entire meal - we could have had leftovers... but me, my dad, and grandpa were hungry white men with large appetites!\n\nI would definitely take any of my friends to this place for dinner. My family has been here for lunch too, and it is just as good.\n\nAs people have recommended, this place has the best value for large groups (at least 4, recommended more) because the \"set menus\" are the best value.

Dat no ethical...\n\nOn the west side of town, Ming's Diner (no relation to Mel's) on Taraval and 31st, is overflowing to the brim with A$Ns all over on a Saturday night. And Ming isn't giving two $hit$ about what the net thinks of him or his food or service. \n\nYes, we came here for the vegetarian fare. But we didn't know that it was only 38 items allocated to a Vegetarian Special section, of a multi page menu that catered mostly to meatatarians. They have seafood too, including fresh from the tanks of lobster, spot prawns, dungeoness crab, and hmmmm riddle me this...live eels that looked pretty pi$$ed they were the only fresh fish rep.\n\nAnd even the vegetarian menu looked suspect.... the English translation looked like it was put together from various meatatarian cla$$ic$...\n\nlike\n\nWalnut Prawn\n\nShark's Fin Soup (OK before you flame, it's probably bean thread noodles, aka vegan shark fin. Evil thought, but not so evil on the environment.....where's vegan foie gras, vegan bluefin toro, or vegan panda, vegan scorpion?!)\n\nSo this raises my point that Chinese vegetarian/vegan, is designed in such a way to appeal to the taste of meatatarians (hence the faux meat looking dishes), so should they find the need to transition to a vegetable diet, that they can do so a bit easier via this means. If you are a stark Buddhist vegan type, or prefer a salad, or some Ubuntu Green Millinium Falcon Star Wars organic slow food mofo vegan, this is probably not the place for you.\n\nAlthough Jillian from the Bachelorette made the hardest decisions in her life, i.e. figuring out what girth and firmness of sausage she wants to hold on to for another episode, we didn't want to fall into that brain draining mode with the menu ourselves, so we defaulted to our waiter and asked what he recommended from this expansive lineup.  \n\n#122. Pei Pa Tofu (Dragon Balls) (seasoned tofu balls) and Broccoli - $7.75\n\n#147 - Sahng Gun Mun Dsap Wui Bo (House Special Combination Vegetarian Clay Pot) - $7.95\n\nFortunately 122 did not come with Akira Toriyama's assortment of characters like Son Goku and friends, nor did the fried stuffed tofu look anything like golden spheres with numbered stars on them (where if you gather the set a dragon will come out and grant you a wish, ala Dragonball Z style). But it did look like authentic pei pa tofu (where the original receipe has meat and eggs in it).\n\nIn short\n\n122) - damn good and best value for the money. I lost count but there were around 12 oblong shaped fried stuffed tofus. The inside was soft, like a quiche but not eggy, with chunks of faux (vegan) ham and a few other things. Topped with a flavored corn starch thickened sauce, with broccoli and enoki mushrooms. Very labor intensive to make and at $8, this is a $un$et A$N cheapne$$ bargain of epic proportion$, and making it the most ordered dish off the vegetarian menu\n\n147) - This clay pot was a mish mash of stuff, very complicated yet simple. And freakin delish. Bean thread noodles, vegan squid, vegan pork intestines, vegan preserved meat (that were fugly chunks of taro root), vegan fishballs (yummay), mushrooms, wheat gluten (mien jien) cut to look like darkened fried dough sticks bits, vegan shrimp (they even painted the stripes and made it curve!), napa cabbage. No animals or sealife were harmed for the making of 147, but damn if the faux stuff is this good, I wonder what the real stuff is like!\n\nMing's looks like a dump on the outside, but inside is actually quite clean and neat. Service is very spotty, especially when it is busy, so don't be too surprised that people arriving after you may get their food before you (depends on what is ordered).\n\nWe also got comp'd the house soup, very typical Cantonese style (real pork bones, veg, and Chinese herbs) almost like a clear broth, typical good solid Taraval Sunset Chinese restaurant standard (free and decent). And house dessert was green bean soup (on the sweet side, but good flavor and tasty green beans). \n\nHint to the restaurant entrepreneurs....open up one o' these in the Peninsula, skip opening some new Northern trendy Chinese place...", "author": "Ken K."}

Ming's Diner is no exception.\n\nWhile they don't specialize in vegetarian cuisine, I like Ming's for advertising that they actually do cater to veg heads, as opposed to surprisingly find that they serve meat analogues by skimming through the menu.  (Contrary to other reviews, the veg menu includes english translations.)  \n\nTheir fried rice is like crack.  It is addicting.  Throw pine nuts into the mix, and it's a cut above your ordinary fried rice.  It reminds me of Enjoy Vegetarian's House Special, fake ham and all.  I've become partial to their \"spareribs\", both salt and pepper, and sweet and sour.  I will admit that their faux meat is not the best--it's a lil on the tough side--but the crispy fried outer shell is its redeeming quality.  The walnut prawns are next on my hit list of items to try.  Everything on the menu sounds delicious and unique; they don't just offer the usual sweet and sour/sesame chicken.\n\nI can't speak for their regular (read: meat) menu, but the place never seems to be empty, never short of Chinese diners.  That has to say something towards the quality of the food.  But everyone, regardless of dietary preferences, can dine in perfect harmony here.  I'm sure it helps to be able to speak the language and look the part for better service, so I stick with take out to reduce any chance of getting a reduction in service by dining in.\n\nIt's a good ending point for my longer runs; I, otherwise, wouldn't make the trek out here--at least, not regularly.

I've eaten here over a dozen times now and the food is consistently good if you know what to order. I think it's funny that this place is supposed to be a vegetarian place because some of their non-vegetarian items are super-yum. \n\nSince my family eats here, we usually order in Canto for at least 8 people, and thus start off with the set menu. As any person is familiar with ordering at a Chinese restaurant, it's all about using the set menu as a base for what you want to order. These items are usually the most commonly prepared, thus you can expect the freshest ingredients. Building off the set menu, we usually add or substitute the following items:\n\n-deep fried fish (my all-time fave at this place! you can eat the bones too.)\n-oxtail stew\n-vegetarian stew in claypot\n-salty fish and chicken tofu\n-deep fried squab\n\nDon't bother with ordering any Americanized Cantonese food here. If you want that, go elsewhere. The price is reasonable for the amount of food you get (especially if you order the specials). The dishes are very often made with fresh ingredients and the servers will tell you what is fresh and good if you ask them to make recommendations. \n\nThe servers all speak Canto so bust it out if you can for super-good service. (My fave server is super loud and basically yells across the room to the other servers when he communicates. He also speaks terrific broken English so don't be afraid of the loud Chinese man.) It's also good to make reservations ahead of time, especially during Chinese holidays and weekends. Otherwise your wait will be at least an hour long. Another alternative is to order out, which I see customers doing all the time. Parking takes a bit of effort, but you're in SF after all.

It used to be that during midday, you would find tons of Chinese construction workers eating here during their lunch break. But that's all kinda changed. There are less people eating here, and I've seen a rapid decline in business in the last year or so. \n\nThe tables are sometimes really sticky, and the decor looks like it's seen better days. The waiters are kinda gruff, and rough around the edges, but they do try their best in terms of getting your order hot and fresh from the kitchen to your table. Ordering take-out is decent, I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes for my order to come out. Sometimes it's out in 10 minutes.\n\nAlthough this is a seafood restaurant, BEEF is their winning dish. Anything beef will practically do. Their beef chow fun is oily, but their portions are big, delicious, and awesome. The honey walnut prawns are incredible, and the clay pots are awesome as well. \n\nIf you don't mind the hole-in-the-wall restaurant attitude, you'll find good food. And remember that if you don't like sitting in the restaurant, there's always their excellent take-out service. I'd highly recommend it.", "author": "Clinton L."}

I don't mean that both Jedi and Sith can eat in harmony here, but at least meat eaters and their sworn enemies vegetarians can eat at the same table. This is another hole in wall crap hole, with no decore to speak of, and some dirty ass table cloths. When the wife and i sat down, we stared at our dirty white table cloth and wondered if they had any money to spring for some fresh linens. Loud mouthed mother hens yelling cantonese at each other while bits of food fall off their mouths; waiters that look like they spent more time on their hair, than say, oh, skin care or brushing their teeth...yes, this place is a superstar among Chinese dives. \n\nBut the food variety is very nice, and truth be told, their vegetarian stuff is not too bad. We ate with my Taoist mom, who has sworn off meat (sheesh -  her loss) and she had the \"pepa\" tofu, ong choy, and the fake seafood clay pot. they use some kind of soy meat substitute, and fashion it to look like the protein it is replacing. for example, in the clay pot there was piece of fake meat colored white and orange and shaped like a shrimp. Pretty tasty, actually, but it didn't taste like shrimp though. I also ordered the beef short rib and clams with \"bad bean\" sauce. the beef was tender, but the clams had some sand in them, but what do you expect from a dive? good food, great for bringing out the family, but definitely not good for a date.

We've come here before because my grandma and aunt are vegetarians and they have a vegetarian menu.  \n\nI like this restaurant because it's a fairly priced place that serves up a lot of food.  We basically ordered their cheapest set dinner menu and ended up having to take home 5 boxes of food because we couldn't finish it all.  There were at least 2 whole dishes that we didn't even touch.  \n\nMy first comment is not to recommend whatever appetizer platter we started off with.  It was a jellyfish and chinese pancake dish.  The jellyfish was warm and way too oily.  It wasn't at all what I expected and I didn't eat any more of it.  \n\nEverything else were pretty solid.  We had a deep-fried flounder, hong kong style pork, fried rice, crab, chicken, and more.  I don't remember all of the dishes exactly but it was all pretty good.  I particularly enjoyed the deep-fried flounder because it was juicy on the inside and crispy on the outside.  It was possible to eat most of the bones because of the way it was cooked.  At many restaurants I've been to, the bones aren't fried enough to warrant consumption.  \n\nThe restaurant is mainly a local haunt with two floors and plenty of free parking nearby.

About 15 years ago, they changed ownership.  As a child, I remember the waiters as being very friendly.  In the past few years, I've come to realize that they're actually pretty grumpy and rude, except for one who always says hi and stops to talk with us to talk about anything.  \nAlthough Ming's specializes in vegetarian dishes, we never order anything vegetarian. My friends enjoy the chicken with chili sauce, which is slices of chicken sauteed with onions tossed in a chili sauce.  It's sweet, salty, and spicy all at the same time.  My family orders the same thing almost every week, rotating certain dishes. Just to name a few: \n\nonion pancake- sometimes they run out.  They are perfectly fried, crispy, and fluffy.  One time they gave us onion pancakes... instead of green onion, they put cilantro.  Took one bite and said WTF?! (I HATE cilantro)\nlemon fish- i think it's fried chicken with lemon sauce on the menu, but we get fish instead.  It has a light batter and is always fried to perfection.  The fish is still moist and delicate inside and instead of having the sauce poured directly onto the fried goods, we have the sauce put on the side so that the fish stays crispy.\nCrispy noodles- we order chicken with veggies, 3 meat, or tomato beef.  There's always a good amount of crispy noodles around the edge then the soft noodles which have been drenched in the sauce that's been put on top of the noodles.  The crispy part is my favorite, whereas the saucy parts are my cousins' favorites. Perrrrrrfect. \nChow Fun- beef, or black bean beef.  Usually, I don't eat beef at many Chinese restaurants cause it tastes just like the cornstarch they've dunked the beef into to tenderize it, but Ming's beef tastes like actual beef.  The black bean chow fun is good.  They put just the right amount of sauce over the noodles where the black bean isn't overpowering the dish.\nGreens- we order whatever vegetables we feel like eating that day.  They're always cooked perfectly where they're still crisp and juicy.\nSoup- for lunch, they're basic soup is usually a soup that's been made from beef bone and random herbs.  Sometimes they serve a soup that's been boiled with carrots, which is slightly sweet.  If you like very mellow tasting soups, it's ok.  Sometimes, the soups are horrible... heavily diluted with water or something. The soups that come with the banquet style meals are good tho.\n\nBased on other people's reviews, I guess it's a hit or miss.  Some of the things people have eaten, I didn't even know existed on the menu haha\nI'd give Ming's 4 stars if only the waiters cracked a smile once in a while and didn't toss the dishes onto the table right before walking away.", "author": "Cheryl Q."}

I couldn't complain since this was the restaurant my father picked for his birthday dinner, but if I was the one being honored I would have seriously and profanely went off on what I was served last night.\n\nFirst off, waiting isn't the problem...I chalked that up to no reservations and Saturday nights are always crowded...and it wasn't service, since we all know what it's like here anyways. BUT this review was just for the food...or the nasty seconds we tried to swallow..\n\nYou know the night's going to be bad when the complimentary soup in the beginning tasted like tepid bovine dish water...seriously...not even the 2 tablespoons of soy sauce could make this taste good. Not even my parents finished their first servings of that dreck. Then Dad got the squid with sour veggies plate, but it was so salty, that when I cried, the salt in my tears wasn't as bad as what was on that dish...and super oily. \nSecond dish was some boiled shelled shrimp with carrots. I looked at this sad dish and said, okay, it's gonna be okay. First bite, blech...it was flavorless...absolutely no flavoring what so ever. What happened? Did I turn into an 85 year old with no taste buds??!! And the last dish was Beef Chow Fun...as ubiquitous as sweet and sour pork, you'd think a chinese restaurant wouldn't have found a way to F up this dish, but they did...oh yes, they did.\nFirst off, the nasty oily aftertaste told us that they deep fried it with whatever leftover oil they had previously deep fried to death. Second, there was no FLAVOR!!! Again, no flavor...all I tasted was oil...even the beef was so oily, there was no words...gawd it's so bad, even my frugal parents told me not to box it up for home and it was barely touched! T__T.  Don't even get me started on their free \"sweet\" dessert soup...sweet my ass, it was swill, I tell you...flavorless swill!\n\nI looked at everyone else at this place and thought, \"My gawd, people!

I've eaten here about 4 times, and sometimes the wait is too long so I go to Han Goeng's instead.  The food costs a few dollars more per dish than Han Goeng's, but it is also usually a little bit better here.  However, because it's always busy, I feel like the service caters to older patrons more and you are neglected if your group is full of people in their 20s.  My roommate does not like this place because he feels that they don't treat us as well because they think that we're kids and they don't want to wait on us. Try to get a table on the lower level because service is very very scarce if you're sitting on the second floor.  \n\nI got the $128 banquet meal here and we made some substitutions to it, so it ended up costing a bit more.  I added garlic sauteed pea sprouts and beef oxtail clay pot here and both dishes were very good.  I especially liked the oxtail because it was very tender and the meat would fall off the bone, as if it's been cooking for hours.  The peking duck was also very good and I liked the duck skin and dough buns.  There wasn't much meat on the duck though, but I think that might be how peking duck is served.  The sauteed scallops and shrimp dish was also good. The portion was very large and tasted very fresh.  They also gave us a huge deep fried flounder.  I thought that most of the fish was good, especially the crispy skin, which was fried with garlic.  However, parts of the fish were kinda fishy.  I took the fish home because there was so much left over, and that was when I found that one particular area of the fish tasted like ammonia.  So I 'm pretty sure that part of the fish had gone bad.  The only other dish that was dissappointing was the dual lobsters.  The lobsters that we got were tiny!  The claws and tail portions were so small that I think they must have given us baby lobsters or giant crawfish, lol!  If I had to guess, I would say that they were between 3/4 of a pound to 1 pound each.  What annoyed me was that we had actually gotten the banquet meal with 2 crabs and they were trying to get me to exchange the crabs for lobsters. I spoke with my group and we felt that crabs would be fine, and turned down the offer, but then they came back and said that they had run out of crabs.  I felt that the whole incident was kind of shady, and that they might have taken advantage of us, especially after we ended up with tiny lobsters.\n\nOh, and they charge $1 per person for rice.

They have a 2nd floor for larger groups, which is where we were all seated. (side note if you sit up there along the back wall be careful since all the chairs are stacked against the wall right next to those tables)\n\nLet's start off with the fact that I have been here before but it's been such a long time, from what I remember was that we would always have to ask for water and the food was fairly good.\n\nNow for last nights experience where to even begin.  Don't get me wrong I do love Chinese food also to note vegan, vegetarian chinese food as well. Waiting for the dinner to start a server who I might note wasn't in the best mood brought out cut up lettuce for a dish; it sat there for nearly an hour because the actual dish it was served with didn't come out for an hour. i didn't know how much food was ordered but we had about 10 different dishes (or something like that) sent to each table we had which was 3, so 30 dishes for all of us total? A lot of food. Their sweet pork ribs were and are still delicious one thing consistant from my older visits. Most of the food was alright, not gross or anything a fairly OK, I'd have to say. BUT there was one dish that was sent back, it was deep fried fish with garlic and soy sauce, the outside was cooked for sure but when we cut it up, usually fried fish cuts well when fully cooked but the fish was still mushy on the inside and pink, so whoops that went back.\n\nAll the servers we had that night were cantonese, I don't speak but my boyfriend and all of his family do. But let's get to the service which is why there were rated so low. I noticed the server would stomp his feet up the stairs and non stop talk and even some costumers would talk back. I didn't ask but those that understood would tell me what was going on. One thing was that someone asked for more water and he told the costumer to get it himself, or even told someone to shut up at their table. My response, what who says that?! I understand why our food took so long to come out besides the fact that it was super busy it was the fact that there were so many of us, so much ordered but get this....\n\nEveryone started to get full from what was already served (no one really knew at least at our table, what and how much stuff was ordered) but we were given to go boxes from the servers to pack up the stuff we had left over... BUT THEY KEPT SERVING US FOOD THAT WE SUPPOSEDLY ORDERED!? I know some of you are thinking yeah but you ordered that stuff  we were there nearly 3 hours you give us boxes WHILE you still have food coming out to us? SHEESH... \n\nFrom the service to sending back food I felt like I was in chef Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares. I bet the kitchen was insane with all the orders but never have I seen or heard any servers talk to any costumers in that manner in all the places I've lived or visited. \n\nI've never encountered any of this in the past at this place but geez....\n\nparking sucks...", "author": "Steph S."}

And because they recognize my father, the service though not 5 star, is better than it normally would be if it had just been me.\n\nUpdate 3/19/2007\nOk, so we went there for dinner also, the same day.  What can I say?  We had a family dinner, and my mother and grandmother are super strict Buddhist vegetarians, and Ming's has a full vegetarian menu of food that they cook on a separate range so that the pots and pans and smells don't mix with that of the meat dishes which is ideal with what their religion would like, though they know not every restaurant can promise that.  Their vegetarian menu also doesn't use garlic or onions which goes with the Buddhist guidelines for eating.\n\nSo for us normal meat eating family members at the dinner, we had 2 kinds of crab which were amazing, messy but great in flavor and taste.  (If you had to pick one, my BF liked the salt and pepper crab the best for the flavor).  That came alongside with a complimentary plate of onion pancakes which were tasty and very flavorful.  Following the pancakes came a squab which I didn't get to try but  from what I could see everyone was enjoying.  ( I was too busy eating the onion pancakes and when I was done there was no more squab!)  We also had chicken and squid dish which was good, but for me, the highlight was the soy sauce fish!  I don't know what kind of fish it is but it is made with a soy sauce mix on it that is amazing.......the fish melts in your mouth and over some white rice, I could have just had that all night and been perfectly happy.  It's always my favorite dish at Mings...........seriously.  I love it.  Every time we have a family dinner there, my father, aunt or whoever is ordering it makes sure I get that otherwise I will admit, I whine like a 7 year old the rest of the night.  I left Mings content, full and still dreaming of the soy sauce fish.  \n\nIf you go there, all the men are nice, if you make the effort.  We have been going for years and they are all nice, Kevin is the only waiter though whose name I actually know because my dad is always calling his name out to bring more napkins and to change the plates for us.  \n\nOh, and Leon, per Mr. Quan, you must must get the lobster chow mien if you are there. We tried to get it today, but they were out of lobster.  How dare they!!\n\nUpdated 3/2/2007\nOoh went again tonight. Add to the list of things that were good: the mu shu pork- mixture of pork and vegetables and some sauce that you wrap up like a burrito in a flat Chinese type tortilla..........also the soy sauce chicken was good!  And my uncle swore by the long shelled clams- he liked them so much he ordered a second plate to go........this one is not on the menu, just ask the waiter about any specials not on the menu!\n\nUpdate 7/14/2007\nOh I forgot to mention there is no alcohol here, BUT you can bring your own.  We always cart in a cooler of beer and wine and stuff.  How great is that?", "author": "Denise B."}

Awesome. I had low standards for food back then because I really didn't care. Looking back, this place is pretty dirty. The food they give you is pretty cheap quality and made like it's whatever. Definitely don't bring your date here. It's not date friendly because it can get super loud and the food just doesn't look pretty when it comes to the table. They pretty much just slap on anything on a plate. You could do better. Loosen up the purse strings. Haha.", "author": "Jenny T."}

It's always about the food but you don't want the risk of eatting insects and encounter with other creatures of nastiness.  There was a dam dirty nasty chinese place at Taraval and 19th.  The food is dam good but the flies and roach wants to fight for your food as you eat is gross.\nSo Ming is a better choice for me. \n We order 3 dishes and the portion is very generous.  We did not make a dent in meal.  There was also complimentary soup and dessert.  Soup was great don't know what's in it but the usual chinese vegi and bone light soup.  Needless to say we bag it all back home and they taste even better the next day.\nI think it is what you pay for too.  I have been to other chinese place with lower price, the portion is a lot smaller.  There were lots of people waiting.  Lots of local family eat there.  They have big tables mostly for groups and a upstair for parties.  The service is the worse part.  I think they cater mostly to big groups as other reviews have said.  I think they jump to help the bigger group first because they will get a bigger tip since they order more food.  I saw other tables order all vegetarian meals.  They sure have a lot of choices for them.  In short this is not a bad place if you don't mind waiting a bid if you are not in a big group.", "author": "Mar H."}

Back then, the food was pretty good! As time went by, this place is like a roller coaster, keeps on going up and down again and again! One day your experience is pretty decent! Other days are just a complete disaster! Service is way below par! Some waiters are very moody! I noticed if you order the more expensive items, they tend to treat you better! But again, if I was really planning on to spend more money, there is no way on earth would I go there to eat! It has plenty of competitors around the area that has way better food, service and value! The place is so outdated! I know they renovated the place a short while ago, but it hardly or barely changed the environment. The tables and chairs are so outdated and worn out. The chairs can break very easily if you happen to sit on a bad one! Food quality is terrible! Alot of grease and the taste is very bland! I ordered a plate of sizziling beef with onions the other day! It took over half an hour for it to reach my table. I don't mind waiting if the plate comes out really good! But when I saw it, I was so disappointed with what they gave me after all that time waiting! 3/4 of the plate was all onions, 1/4 of it was the beef! The beef for some reason were chopped up into many small pieces. It was like for a three year old eating it. The beef was very tough to eat! Not much seasoning and very greasy! They really ought to change their service and food quality besides jacking up their prices! Their value and quality is really sinking everytime I go back there!", "author": "Vince F."}

We are Caucasian (so not Asian) and there definitely is a difference in the waiters attitude if you are asian, but we ignored this, as the food made us return here often.. \n\nFinally, we stopped going here. Why? \n\nTwice found some type of small metal object in our dish. (on 2 separate occasions-  I bit into this and was lucky enough to catch it), once hey it can happen, but when it happened a second time, its time to move on. \n\nCould have broken a tooth or swallowed it, and that is a bit too much excitement to anticipate while eating dinner. When I showed them, the looked at it, and asked if I wanted them to redo the dish?

The waiters here are impossible to communicate with and asking them for the simplest of things like napkins or an extra plate is accommodated with a dirty look like your bothering them. \n\nThe food here is actually ok but poor service & waiters with attitude problems are not. The manager/owner, this older woman with glasses just sits there and does nothing but looks around the restaurant like someone is going to run off without paying. When we asked her for the check and a box, she just ignored us. HELLO? Do I need to yell at you to get your attention? \n\nI will also be extremely cautious of ordering something that isn't on a menu or have a price posted. They charged us a ridiculous $13 for pea sprouts and garlic ... what a RIP OFF. My wife also had a sweet tooth that night and asked about the desert after the main meal. The waiter had the nerve to say they are out when another waiter just bought out 10 servings to the table next to us. \n\nAnyway, we won't be coming back and you should think twice about patronage a restaurant who is only interested in your $$$$ and not your dinning pleasure.", "author": "John S."}

We came here after ready fairly good reviews here, but we were somewhat disappointed.\n\nWe ordered a set dinner for 4 to 6 people.  We were only 2 adults and 2 very small children.  The food was ok, but it's a little oily.  The service was above average.  They are friendly and changes your plate as they get full with bones/shells (which doesn't happen all the time in a Chinese restaurant).  Their bathroom is clean.  \n\nWhat really angered me is the portion we were served.  People keep saying the serving size is generous.  We didn't see that at ALL.  They are pulling something because we ordered more than enough food with only 2 adults and 2 small children.  The table next to us with 5 adults ordered the same set dinner, yet their portion is MUCH larger.  It actually angered me so much I was going to say something.  The waiter brings the food out at the same time for both tables (I guess we ordered around the same time), and he drops the food at our table first because we are closer to the back.  He would hold 2 plates of the identical food, but one is ALWAYS larger than the other.  He would always happen to drop off the small plate at our table.  It was VERYYYYY annoying.  Our crab was small with only one claw.  Their crab was much bigger.  That was just messed up.  That kind of ruined my appetite.  We finished almost all our food and it was supposed to be for 4 to 6 people.  Keep in mind that our children ate very little.  We always have lots of left overs at other Chinese places when we order a large set dinner.\n\nWe felt we did not get what we paid for.  We will not be coming back.", "author": "Jon J."}
