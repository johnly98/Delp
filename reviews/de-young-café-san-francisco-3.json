Since there isn't a lot of options to eat at Golden Gate Park, I had lunch here. They have premade food in the fridge. I skipped those and ordered a quiche and salad. Got a chocolate mousse cake for dessert. Quiche was good. Salad too. Loved the cake. For a cafeteria they bring your food to you and they take away the plates. That's added service. \n\nFood is ridiculously expensive here but you knew that", "author": "Wendy H."}

This is a good place to rest and relax not only when visiting the museum, but also when visiting the park and other attractions nearby. We stopped by the cafe to recharge before heading to the Japanese Tea Garden next door.\n\nThe cafe is open in the mornings and afternoons, 9:30am to 4:30pm, Tuesday-Sunday (Monday closed). There's plenty of seating inside and out. The patio is fully covered so it's not cold nor windy. You don't have to enter the museum to access the cafe. The cafe has a separate entrance from the outside via the patio. Restrooms are located inside the museum next to the cafe's museum-side entrance.\n\nWhen we visited, we stood in line and grabbed a couple drinks from the cafe's grab-and-go selection. Items included bottles of apple juice ($3.25), house-squeezed/pressed OJ and carrot + OJ ($4.50), string cheese ($1), hard boiled eggs ($1.25), Stonyfield organic yogurt ($2), parfaits, white bean and artichoke salad ($5.50), spring orzo salad ($5.50), fruit salad ($5.50), winter farro salad ($5.50), couscous salad ($5.50), mixed baby greens ($8.00), and chicken Caesar salad ($13). They also had specialty sodas like Bruce Cost ginger ale ($3.75), Izze blackberry and grapefruit soda ($3.25), Dry cucumber soda ($3.25), and Stewart's Orange 'n Cream soda ($3.25). The carrot + OJ drink and unfiltered ginger ale (strong flavor) were yummy.\n\nComplimentary water is available self-serve from various dispensers.\n\nThe lunch menu contained a variety of light fare like soups, salads, and sandwiches and some hot entrees made in the kitchen.\n\nGood service. There are staff present who bus and clean tables and take away trays.\n\nAlong with the museum and tea garden, other attractions that are close by are the California Academy of Sciences, Music Concourse, and Golden Gate Park Segway Tours.", "author": "Daniel B."}

My daughter and I visited the museum on April 6, 2018. We got hungry so we went to the Caf\u00e9. My daughter, being 21 years old, is very diligent about reading all of the ingredients in her food due to the fact that she has allergies to tree nuts. She found a quinoa salad and read all of the ingredients and of course she chose it because it did not list any kind of nuts in the salad. When she opened it and ate it she heard a crunch. My daughter immediately spit up the salad on a napkin. She ran to a person that was working in the caf\u00e9 and asked about the salad. She told them that she's allergic to nuts so she requested him to  double check with the kitchen because NUTS were not listed on the list of ingredients that was displayed. The man came back out and said that there was hazelnuts in the quinoa salad that she bought. My daughter was very upset and told them that she had to take her Benadryl immediately or else she will have a reaction. \n\nAs a parent, I was very incensed! I requested to speak to the manager of the caf\u00e9 and her name was May Yao. I told her that the caf\u00e9 was irresponsible displaying ingredients that were not true to what they had served to the public. I told her that my daughter is highly allergic to nuts and that we will be sitting to watch what her reaction might be to the hazelnuts that she accidentally ate. Also, If she goes to an anaphylactic shock, I will administer her EpiPen but they'd have to call an ambulance and pay for her medical fees due to their negligence. \n\nThank goodness my daughter is okay!! However, the caf\u00e9 could only say sorry to us and not even reimbursed us for the quinoa salad. It is very upsetting that they did not take this seriously because it could've been a life or death situation. \n\nHaving allergies is no joke and it has to be taken very seriously!", "author": "E D."}

It was a bit confusing, so here's the set-up:  As you enter you are handed a menu of the items you can order, BUT they also have a large selection of \"grab and go\" items.  The menu items that are prepared to order and delivered to your table range from starters, salads, pizzas and entrees such as roast chicken.  The starters started at $8.  Other items on the menu went up from there.  We went with the Grab and Go. They had a number of prepared salads, sandwiches, wraps, fruits, and desserts.  There are four registers, two to the right and two to the left.  You go to the register to order from the menu, order hot beverages, AND to pay for Grab and Go.  My Grab and Go orzo salad had peas, pine nuts, bell pepper, mint and other things in a light vinaigrette dressing, it was tasty with a bit of kick from something.  My brother-in-law had the quinoa salad with cranberries and other goodies.  Each of these salads (and others) came in a plastic container holding about two cups and cost $5.50.  BIL also had a tuna nicoise salad.  It came in a larger container as it contained a lot of greens and a scoop of tuna salad along with olives and cost a bit more.  My husband had a chicken cobb wrap at $9.50.  It was substantial but he did not like it too much.

There is plenty of friendly, professional staff in the attractive (but noisy) dining room. \n\nHowever two issues reduce the rating from 5 to 3 stars. The prices are a bit high.

Add chips and a drink and my tab was $22. \n\nSecondly, the process for ordering and paying for food is stressful and takes way too long. I stood in line for 15 -20 minutes, then reached a confusing central intersection of lines heading to four cashiers. This doesn't work for older people or parents with children.

I was hungry, so we decided to stop by the cafe. They had a 3 course prix fixe for 18$ and a soup special for $6. We decided to share both the soup and a prix fixe. \n\nService at the cafe is a bit confusing. You pay at a counter, you have to get your own silverware, and drinks, waiters bring the food to your table, clear your plates during the meal, and walk around refilling your water. My guess is that having customers pay first allows them to serve faster or something. The staff was friendly and attentive. \n\nThe best dish was the squash soup with coconut milk. The bowl was substantial and the soup was delicious. \n\nThe prix fixe's first course was an arugula salad, which was simple and decent. The main course was a mahi mahi with polenta and collard greens. The main course was the most disappointing dish. The portion was quite small , it was not served hot, and was generally unremarkable.  The red velvet cake with white chocolate we had for dessert was quite good. \n\nWe had a decent dinner, but I would have preferred a different menu at a museum cafe. I think they should focus on providing an assortment of fresh soups,  sandwiches, and pastries. It seems that they sometimes offer burgers and sandwiches on the menu. It is unfortunate I did not have those options when I visited!", "author": "Augusto T."}

On top of not wanting to walk to the car in the rain, we also didn't want to lose the awesome free parking spot we'd been so lucky to find so we decided to try the Cafe.\n\nThere was quite a long line but they were very proactive and handed each person a menu well before we got up to the counter to order. We weren't expecting much more than a small lunch to hold us until after the symposium, and figured it was just going to be average 'cafeteria food' anyway. \n\nWe both thought the chili verde with white hominy and guacamole sounded good and thought we'd split that and one other dish. Since it was a cold and rainy day, the soup sounded like a good choice to me, but while we were waiting in line I observed one of the wait staff walking by with a tray of three scrumptous salads. I instantly changed my mind and decided to try the jicama salad and I'm so glad I did! \n\nBoth the salad and chili verde were wonderful. I was even impressed with the guacamole that came with it. The dressing on the salad was light and flavorful and the portions were perfect. Even the prices didn't seem bad considering how tasty and fresh the food was. I would definitely eat here again next time I visit the de Young.", "author": "Debi T."}

Since it was cold we asked the cafe manager if we could eat in the cafe and she refused stating we were unable to bring in outside food even though I said we would purchase cafe items. We had no other place for the elderly and persons with disabilities to eat. After pleading with her she still said no. After speaking with the museum manager, the cafe manager agreed to allow us to eat in a separate walkway outside the cafe. This was nice but clearly the cafe manager does not understand how to support the elderly and persons with disabilities. It is always better to be inclusive and not make persons who are already \"outcasts\" actually look like unwelcomed \"outcasts\" sitting outside the cafe eating from their laps while they sit in their wheelchairs as \"regular\" customers get to enter. Where do we live again? Just another reminder some people are not a consciously developed as others and have trouble bending the rules to accommodate other human beings. \n\nWe were grateful to have the indoor space and thankful for the museum staff for supporting the elderly and persons with disabilities.

A much better deal is found within line of sight at the more commercial-feeling, but better value, Academy Caf\u00e9.\n\nI got a nonfat mocha, which was good but nothing extraordinary (unlike the spectacular post-Impressionism exhibit right downstairs). The raspberry pistachio cake, while delicious and having the pleasurable consistency of tiramisu, was dominated by raspberry at the expense of pistachio. \n\nAside from the exorbitant price of the entrees (contrasting with the reasonably priced desserts), the biggest disappointment was the silverware, which, fresh out of the wash, was too hot to hold until allowing for a cool down period. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich and asked for it to be cut in half. Evidently their idea of this is to leave the sandwich whole and give us two plates and a dull knife with which to fumble.\n\nFor $23 plus tip, for a small, light lunch for two, the cuisine, service, and ambience must impress.

And I'm not even talking about the prices of the food they prepare (since I have no way of knowing what their overhead might be), but the prices of stuff that they simply buy from a wholesaler and stick on a rack.  $8.50 for a 250ml. bottle of Chimay Red is laughably absurd.  It's $8.50 for a 750ml. bottle of Chimay Red in liquor stores, and those stores are already marking it up at least 100%.  \n\nTheir cheapest beer is $4.50 for a 12-oz. bottle.  How can the Cafe justify slapping on a 400-500% mark-up?!  The same goes for their other bottled and canned beverages, their packaged snacks, etc.  We all know that what the retail prices are of these things (so we can easily extrapolate their wholesale prices), so there's no mystery as to the Museum's outrageous profit margin.  \n\nIt's shameful that an institution that supposedly exists to educate the public and culturally enhance the community is instead totally elitist when it comes to food and drink, pricing many of their visitors out of the opportunity to stay within the building to eat, and instead forcing them to walk or drive many blocks to the nearest food sources on Fulton or Lincoln (presuming they even know where those are). \n\nElitism isn't a bad thing, so long as it doesn't replace equal access.

The soup - Tomato Bisque, was lovely (at $6 a cup, I was very glad it was edilbe). However, I'm not sure what happened, but we ended up with their version of a caprese salad (see picture). While good, it was no where near $12.50 good, and definitely needed a little more \"ooph\" in flavor and calorie content. As it's not on the menu, I'm not sure how it wound up at our table. We did order, and sit out on the patio for lunch. It was very lovely, but it would have been just as lovely to bring a sandwich and sit out in the Sculpture Garden.

I applaud them for trying to make \"sustainable\" food and not dishing everything out on plastic or paper.  Eating outside is really nice if you're there on a sunny day.  \n\nThe not so good:  During the lunch rush hour it can be pandemonium.  People get confused about the difference between the left and right stations (there's no difference) for ordering/paying.  The placement of the grab and go station exactly where both lines diverge causes even more chaos as people try to move through to look at their choices and lose their place in line (or end up cutting in front of other people).  Improved crowd control would be a good thing - a lesson from other cafe style places that might be useful here is taking orders while people wait in line to pay.   Also many places don't make you sign for a credit card bill below $20 anymore, but the DeYoung insists on making your put your John Hancock on the charge slip for that $2.50 bottle of soda, and that just slows the line down even more.  Also I think it's crazy that the cashiers are basically manning the espresso bar and pulling pastries out of the cases.

I've always thought that the Legion of Honor and the de Young have good food. The last couple of times I've eaten at the de Young, however, I've noticed that the portions get smaller and smaller. Two of us on Father's Day had the salmon burger (very good), but the wild rice accompaniment was almost a joke.  Just some small crudit\u00e9 would have been welcome as a garnish! Three of us ate for $40.00 including a modest tip.\n\nSalads are nicely prepared (too small!), and the drink stations are a good touch. Tip: During special exhibits, needless to say (but I will) schedule your lunch between 11:00 and 11:30 to avoid the crush. On Father's Day, we were lucky that at 12:45 there wasn't a long line. We had planned to see some of the Impressionist show, then leave and return after lunch. However, the \"no-exit, no-bathroom\" policy killed that idea, so we ate at the museum. (During Bouquets to Art, we spent almost more time on line than we did looking at the flowers!)\n\nIf at all possible, eat outdoors, then exit to the sculpture garden (and don't miss the tunnel!). On a sunny day, you'll enjoy the lawn.", "author": "joyce h."}

Our church staff, 16 of us, enjoyed a staff outing to the Impressionist exhibit yesterday and had ordered the box lunches and they are AWESOME!  Huge sandwiches, great selection including an ahi tuna sandwich that got rave reviews -- and we are all still thinking about the yummy white chocolate chip cookies for dessert.  Well worth the price!", "author": "Cathy J."}

Boy, they were right.  Don't let the cafeteria-like appearance fool you.  Their food is legit.  They have refrigerated sandwiches and pantry food, but you can also order off a menu, which is where the good stuff's at.  We  had the shredded pork sandwich, the mac and cheese, and the curry chicken salad (which wasn't really a salad, more like a pile of chicken with bits of lettuce).  The food came super fast, and I was very impressed by the presentation.  Someone really put some thought into the dishes.  The pork sandwhich was amazing as well as the mac and cheese.  The curry chicken salad was good but I wanted more greens! If you happen to be in the area, definitely make sure to stop by this cafe as you won't be disappointed.  I didn't give it 5 stars since the food was a bit pricey for what it is.", "author": "Alex H."}

I tried the grab & go spicy Asian rice noodle salad with steak slices for $5.00 and the mushroom & barley soup of the day. My boyf had a sandwich, chips, and the bread pudding. The Asian salad was really good...overpriced but good. The soup was sad. There was maybe one mushroom, no barley, and a few cooked tomato pieces. Nothing else but broth, so that was a waste of money. I like that they have free ice water ready to go and you can get it with cucumbers, limes, lemons, or plain. Boyf says the sandwich was okay but not worth the $10. The bread pudding, I have to say, was awesome. It was quality all the way. It comes with this delish sweet cream on top and fruit puree, and some kind of strawberry creamy sauce on the side that reminded me of a strawberry milkshake. So, to sum it up, not a bad place to go if you want something fairly healthy without having to drive somewhere else, but bring money. You'll need it.", "author": "Sarah S."}

This little place is a hidden 'food' mine stuck in the middle of beautiful Golden Gate Park then wedged in the Ohhh so cool de Young museum.  I have dinned there numerous times and it was always over excellent, both the food and service, not to mention the place is clean and I am a 'super clean freak.'  However, we stumbled in there on a Friday night and had this menu that had a choice of 3 items out of 15 for only $15.00.  WT_!  I had mussels, braised short ribs and amazing french fries cut with a knife (who does that anymore).  The wife, had lamb skewered things, more mussels and oysters.  They also offer very affordable QUALITY wine!  Seriously, we had to race home to change our pants because it was so over the top.  Well, actually we just went to the observation deck to check out the best view of SF.  An amazing 'what an experience!'", "author": "tommy d."}

Now it is noisy and crowded. The waiters are rushed and stressed out. The food is okay, but on two occasions my fries have been delivered cold. Good coffee, though, and it's nice to be able to have access to the cafe without having to pay the admission to the museum.", "author": "Bethany D."}

These were honestly two of the best salads my friend and I have ever had in our lives . . . enough to make us think about trying that move to vegetarianism again this year.  Quinoa salad and pear salad.  Order these and prepare to die - fresh, full of subtle flavors and perfect textures and served in a lovely garden setting outside in Golden Gate park.  It doesn't get any better than this for lunch.  Service great also.", "author": "Eleanor S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-05-04", "description": "Grabbed a few bites before checking out de Young's weekly \"Friday nights at the de Young\" (where the museum opens its doors after hours for a night of music, cocktails, poetry, tours, lectures, and whatever else artsy fartsy types do on a Friday night). The menu offered some potentially good dishes: shredded pork lettuce wraps, pancetta pizzette, fingerling potato frites, etc. Disappointingly, these dishes pretty much fizzled except for the mac 'n cheese offered in the kids' section of the menu. In fact, my husband had to go back to the counter (yes, this is still a cafe, after all) and ordered a couple more. I suppose the kitchen staff got confused for we ended up having double the amount of mac 'n cheese brought to our table. We were dining with some friends and I overheard how great the Neiman Ranch hotdog was, which they ordered for their boys. I guess if you want to have some good eats at this cafe, just order off the kids' menu. Although, the menu is seasonal so there is still hope.", "author": "April B."}

The service is extremely, painstakingly slow - the first two times it took 30 minutes for our mediocre meal to arrive and this time it took a whopping 40 minutes...ridiculous.   The basic hamburger (both ordered medium) - one came out well-done and the other was nearer to rare.  I ordered a pasta dish that sounded good on the menu but it was bland and soggy - disgusting for $13.  For a top notch museum, the restaurant lacks sorely....stay away unless you have over an hour to burn at the cafe....", "author": "Vivian C."}
