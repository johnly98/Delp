Or a football game celebration.\n\nThe streets were Packed with young, college-age party folks. The restaurants and bars were all converted to \"night clubs\", with LOUD rave music and completely packed with high-octane dancing. And this was all 3pm in the afternoon? What?!! What's even more outrageous is how the \"clubs\" are so packed there are long lines outside, for pretty much every \"club\". And did I mention is 3pm in the afternoon?\n\nSome of the restaurants converted their place to a club, and then had a \"food fair booth\" in the middle of the street to sell food--the food they would have been selling if they weren't so busy taking in cover charges at their actual location. Pretty smart.\n\nThe people there are attractive, the weather was nice, and the food was great. This is actually the first time I've had BBQ cooked oysters--the oysters I had in the past were always served cold. I never knew BBQ oysters were so good! The heat brings out all the flavor, and the ones they served at the fair were Giant and packed with oyster-fleshiness. Damn!\n\nOverall, a pretty cool place to check out.", "author": "Henry L."}

There's a large crowd and nothing too exciting that stood out to me besides some spin the wheel to get free things and a few food samples like yogurt, cereal, etc.\n\nIf you're looking for food go somewhere else there was only a few food stands and it was your typical overpriced fair food like a turkey leg and various fried things. I got crab fries for $10 that had garlic, crab aioli, and crab on top. It was pretty good but not worth the price or trip out here.", "author": "Linda X."}

It was an okay festival. My friends and i just walked up and back to browse around to see what vendors and foods they had. All the vendors are either clothes, arts stuff, accessories/jewelry. There're an area where you can get your alcohol such as beers and wines. They have live music. They have this spin the wheel/free printed t-shirt that was sponsored by Ford. Pet friendly since a lot of people brought their dogs to this festival. The foods are pretty pricy: got chicken kebob for $9 and turkey leg for $11 at one of the food vendors. Its pretty crowded, mostly young adults, some older adults. I just thought it was funny how couple stores closed during this festival. Like many other reviewers had mention, its difficult to find parking.", "author": "Julie N."}

Sad to say, this was my first festival in SF I've been to, nope, no Cherry Blossom Festival, Asian Heirtage Street Festival or North Beach Fest for me yet!  My friend and I were pressed for time so we only got to browse for a little bit, but I told her we totally should come back next year.  Yes, the vendors are there to persuade you to buy their products or whatnot, but that's expected.  And some merchants are more chill than others.  \n\nWe got our hands soft and smooth from one of the body care vendors, free totes from  Eat 24 and Fiat, and flyers for a free eyebrow threading sesh and SoulCycle sesh.  And we got to test drive an adorable Fiat convertible with an awesome staff member.  We saw the free slurpee truck but didn't have time and on the way out we stopped by the Brass Knuckle truck for a fusiony ghetto dog (bacon wrapped hot dog) that they called the Snoop Dogg ($8).  It was a little pricey as I heard the other food items at other stands were too, but it totally hit the spot.  \n\nParking of course was even more difficult than usual because it encompassed like 4 blocks on Union, but we parked about 4 blocks down the slight hill.

This year, there was not much to see, rather a disappointment. There were at least 3-4 drinking areas to corral the drunks and keep them off the streets. A few food stands and the rest were vendors selling things that you really don't need which will clutter up your home with \"stuff\" that your heirs will curse you for buying and leaving them with the dirty deed of having to get rid of them for you. \nIn prior years, there were more real \"artists\". I saw only one metal sculptor who won the blue ribbon for the show.  In reality, he didn't have much competition.  I wonder if he sold any of his large pieces.  There were a few painter/artwork but nothing like in the past and I didn't see any glass work, ceramics, pottery of significant beauty.  \n\nThis fair has turned into more a drinking, eating, walking tour.  Really too bad as it pales in comparison to the Fillmore Jazz Festival. It took us only 2 hrs. to get thru it and that's with milling around and taking our time to walk thru.

My co-worker (who's slightly allergic to garlic) didn't even need to take any allergy meds while/after eating the fries. Good for her, bummer for me as I love garlic! =/ There were a lot of samples given out and plenty of food vendors so even the picky eaters can find something to munch on.

Now, keep in mind this was many, MANY years ago and I now live happily in the burbs with my husband of 16 years and my two children.\n\nYesterday I met a friend and we wandered down Union Street.  Yikes.  Once upon a time there were REAL artists who sold their one of a kind pieces of art.  Yesterday I saw ONE.  The rest of it was pure crap.  Geico insurance?!  SF Giants fan club?\n\nSaid friend and I were heading to Spa Radiance for relaxing massages.  Ha!  The spa is next to the Mauna Loa.  This is a bar I would frequent in the early 90's.  A lot.  I never remember it being open during the day but yesterday it was.  I spent my massage in a room overlooking the courtyard of the bar.  I felt like I was in the middle of the bar having my massage.  The Spa should have either warned us or just shut down for the weekend.  OMG.  But, that's for another review...\n\nWe couldn't even get out of the doorway of the spa as it was filled with drunk \"girls\"!    Girls huddled in the doorway.  Weird.  Anyway while wandering the streets in disbelief I  noticed quite a few stores were closed with signs saying they'd be back when the street fair was over.  That speaks volumes.  A store closing while all this foot traffic is around?  Humm...  \n\nAfter looking around... I realized why.  OMG!  These \"people\" could not be from the Marina.  No way.  They were clearly from The Jersey Shore.  I swear I saw Situation on the corner of Union and .  What is the deal?  Are these the new \"Marina Breeders\"?  Holy Hell.  They were everywhere.  Blocking doorways, blocking sidewalks...  It was uncomfortable and a part of me was scared but I was also very confused.  How did THAT look get to SF?!

So far this year, I've attended the Cherry Blossom Festival, Asian Heritage Street Festival, and Carnaval and without a doubt the USF is hands-down my favorite!\n\nDAY/TIME:\nSaturday, 6.5 and Sunday, 6.6. from  10AM-6PM.\n\nLOCATION:\nUnion Street; Gough to Steiner Streets.\n\nPARKING:\nCan be quite difficult since the festival is held in the residential area in The Marina. However, we were lucky enough to snag parking near Van Ness which may be your best bet. Otherwise, just take MUNI. \n\nFREEBIES (to let your inner Asian-ness come out):\n*Stacy's Pita Chips\n*Sabra Hummus\n*Smucker's Sundaes\n*Science Diet Doggie Treats\n*Glop Cheese and Olive Oil Spread\n*Rockstar Energy Drinks\n*Wellness Pack: Rice, Apple Sauce, cereal, nutrition bars, cat and dog food and detergent. \n\nIf you're a foodie, you will love the USF. Of all the festivals I've been to this year, they have the most extensive array of food booths:\n\n*Saigon BBQ: banh mi, bun, spring rolls\n*The Roasted Corn: corn, fried veggies, funnel cakes\n*California BBQ: peking chicken wraps and bbq sticks\n*Tacolicious: short-rib beef, carnitas, chicken, and veggie tacos\n*Da Kine Drinks: coffee, smoothies, shaved ice\n*Gourmet Faire: gyros, beer battered fries and crab fries\n*Main Street: pupusas, gyros, bbq oysters, fish and chips\n*Sonoma Teriyaki: teriyaki chicken, fried rice, chow mein\n*Pedemonte & Co.: hot dogs, brats, garlic fries\n*Aroma: turkey legs, tri-tip sandwiches, kebobs, crab cakes\n*Tantes: falafel, shawarma, fish tacos, jalape\u00f1o fries\n*Earthly Delights: BBQ Pork and philly cheese steak sammies\n*OSHA: pad thai, chicken satay, eggplant\n*New Orleans Catering: jambalaya, crawfish etouffee, gumbo, blacked shrimp\n*Kasa: naan rolls, chicken tikki masala\n\nMy friends and I tried the following:\n*Saigon BBQ's fried spring rolls ($6 for 10 small pieces): The pork spring rolls were ok, but would have been better if there were served warm. They were room temp and by then have lost it's crisp. There was not sweet and sour sauce just peanut, fish sauce, or sambal. \n\n*Tacolicious ($3.50 each or 3 for $10): \n-Short-rib: DELISH! The beef was tender, moist, and flavorful. \n-Carnitas: Our fav! The pork was smoky, tender, and slightly sweet. \n-Beer Chicken: The chicken was moist, tender, and super flavorful. \n-Watermelon Agua Fresca ($3.50): Yuck, it tasted sour and bitter.\n\n*Gourmet Faire's Crab Beer Battered Fries ($8): OMG--SO EFFEN GOOD! The fries were lightly battered and fried to a golden crisp. The beer batter made the coating nice, airy, and crunchy. It was slathered with a creamy aioli sauce with a slight hint of spice and then generously topped w/ fresh sweet, succulent Dungeness crab meat. Salty, creamy, sweet, salty, crunchy--an explosion of different taste and textures! \n\n*Main Street's BBQ Oysters (3 for $7): YUMMY! The oysters were plump, juicy, tender, smoky and sweet. It was topped with fresh drawn butter and minced garlic which gave it a nice savory and slightly pungent taste. \n\n*New Orleans' Crawfish Etouffee ($8): The crawfish stew was spicy and savory, but the crawfish was overcooked and mushy.\n\n*The Roasted Corn's Funnel Cake ($5): We opted to top ours w/ powdered sugar and whip cream. YUM, there's nothing better like fried dough. The funnel cake was crisp and doughy in the center. The powder sugar added just a touch of sweetness while the whip cream added a nice creaminess.\n\nBEER GARDEN ($6 for 12 oz.):\nThere were 3 beer gardens serving up Blue Moon, Honey Moon, Pale Moon, Bud, Bud Light, and Heineken. Unlike Carnaval, where people looked like drunken imprisoned animals overflowing from a cage, the USF's beer garden was bustling yet spacious enough w/o feeling you were getting shoved around like in a club. \n\nOTHER VENDORS:\n*30-40 booths of art from local painters, handmade jewelry, clothing, accessories and trinkets.\n\nMUSIC:\n*Live light rock and jazz music which you can enjoy while sitting on the synthetic turf lawns. \n\nCROWD:\nMixed \"elites\" as I would like to call them. And, plenty of cute doggies that I spent most of my time coo-ing over.\n\nCLEANLINESS:\nAfter last week's experience at Carnaval which made me feel like I had to jump into a pool of Purell, I was pleasantly surprised at how clean the USF was. There were clean porta-potties scattered around; however, there were no foot pump generated sinks. *sigh* There were plentiful receptacles which we saw workers regularly empty out and \"shine\". The seating area and turf lawns were clean and free of debris. For a germaphobe like myself, this is a big PLUS!\n\nI absolutely can't wait until the next USF. Gotta rep that \"Asian\" in me somehow, so next time, I'll remember to bring plenty of cash (all the bank ATMs and ATMs were out of cash or not working) AND a shopping bag to collect all the goodies.

Ladies, you might find the man of your dreams if you don't mind the fact that he is drooling and slurring...  and that he has a piece of turkey on his chin from the enormous smoked turkey leg that he is holding onto for dear life.\n\nBuying chotchkes- If overpriced cinnamon-dusted almonds, strange hats, candles, and uninspired clothing piques your interest...this is the place for you.\n\nIn all fairness, they do have a pretty good selection of food stands (their corn dogs were amazing!)

I attribute my zen attitude in venturing into the marina and having an okay time to my friend Ben comparing it to visiting the zoo. I am okay going to the zoo to visit the animals and see how they live, when  I make the decision to go to the zoo I have a good time, it is only when I see the animals escaped and wandering around in my neighborhood that I freak out.

I like all street fairs really though, Haight, Fillmore, North Beach... I like to walk around outside, listen to live music, hang with friends, and mostly: eat \"meat on a stick\" which they all serve. I think they call it BBQ'd Chicken or something perverse like that. I call the shots as they are.\n\nEach year (for the last 5!) some friends of mine who live on Union St have a big party during the festival which allows all of us to get together, drink, dance, and be merry and peruse in and out of the street festival. It's a well managed production, with control of who comes and goes, safe, in control, etc....\nThis year Steven Restivo has put an end to it, and the festival hasn't even started yet! Steven took it into his own hands by calling the police, the fire marshals, and LANDLORDS of the apartments and buildings on Union St ahead of time, to ensure there were no parties this weekend, OTHER THAN THE ONE HE WAS THROWING. It seems he's a big cry baby and thinks the house parties which are a custom with Union St Fest detract sales from the Beer Gardens he hosts. So he's doing whatever he can to ensure he makes the most profit and no one has any fun.\nAs a result we are all boycotting the beer gardens at Union St Fest this year (and the Fillmore Jazz Fest which he also puts on). Anyone who's partied in a house for Union St should do the same.\n\nThe Union St Fest house parties make it the special event it is, and SF what it is. I mean, first Bay to Breakers, now this!

Great weather this year was a huge plus.

But still managed to get MC Hammered with my drink in my water bottle and enjoy the atmosphere!  We hit up a few of the house parties on the block as well as the bars and conveniently crawled out to barnone later that night.  Got too trashed to drive home and unfortunately left the car in the Marina School parking lot overnight which led to a $25 overnight fee which blew balls but at least we didn't drink and drive.

We stopped off and bought habanero balsamic from a place up in Ukiah and Japanese inspired t-shirts. Osha had a stand with yummy food and we also had vegan food. I got a mini red velvet cupcake from Kingdom Cupcakes for $1 and it was delicious. We also got corn on the cob for $4, which was good but kind of pricey for corn. Fun affair with lots of people.

Bad points, being a woman and having to use a decent restroom. That and staying ahead of the crowed. Oh and where was Bella and rest of crew. \nSure you need to take a lap around. You have to be able to say you saw something on the street. Grab some food. Yea i wanted to eat at Left at Albuquerque to but it was too crowded. Beer gardens = beginner.

They were pretty good humored, but very drunk.  There were lots of balls flying around and some pretty heavy - footballs, basketballs, medicine balls, those squishy things that people do pilates on.  Lots of these balls flying all over the place - only trouble was this was between Gough and Franklin - open for traffic.  Sooner or later one of these balls hits a taxi cab - pretty hard thunk actually.  Taxi driver gets out picks up a ball yells at everyone and no-one and flings it into the crowd.  Just the slightest bit of change in the atmosphere - what's he going to do next?  Security guys still hanging around the festival eyeball all this and enjoy the spectacle calling in their pals - take a look at this lads (apologies for schematic rendering of security guard patois).  Hmm. is this the height of responsible event security?  Anyway, taxi driver realises that  sun + alcohol + testosterone = no chance of getting any sense out of these guys.  Gets back in his car and drives off.  Kind of funny, but kind of edgy too.  Not sure what happened next - we wandered off back to Polk.\n\nSunday we came by again by accident.  (We're new in town - could you tell?)  Got off the 22 bus at the Steiner St end and wandered through at about 3 o'clock.  Kiddie-centered rides, roundabouts and face painting and so on at this end - then the usual food, clothes, beer, SFPD, SFGate, NY times (completely empty) Zipcar stalls, more food, clothes and beer.  Those beer gardens are noisy.  There's a stall selling faux-retro-ad placards - picture of a glass of frothy beer - caption: \"the best head in town - get it here\" - the old ones are the best, right?  I nearly buy one, but catch my wife's eye - maybe not.  She's right of course - bad jokes about fellatio soon go limp.  Instead, we buy a straight one of \"Wizard of Oz\" which has a good pic of Toto - dead ringer for our dog Barney - aah.\n\nAbout halfway down, we see lots of people sitting in a cross street waiting for a band to come on.  Everyone totally focussed on something - can't quite see what - oh yes, it's a man with an iguana on his head.  Thought for a moment it's the same guy who walks down to Union Square with his rat on the back of his cat on the back of his dog - but no it's a new act.  At least, it's new to us.  But then, everything's new to us.\n\nNot quite sure in the star department.  If we're here next year and still living nearby we'll drop in, but to be honest, I don't think we'd make a big detour.
