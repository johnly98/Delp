I hadn't been to this dive bar before in the Mission. I hadn't heard of it, but I have been going out to bars like Bender's and Knockout with people. Those are alternative dives in the Mission. I had a virgin bloody Mary and actually that was my first bloody Mary. It's tomato juice with spices and a different flavor. You gotta do the photo booth. Note: It's $3 and you pay with credit card. It's spits out two copies and you gotta sit still quickly and take 3 pics. The outside looks old, but it's modern inside. It's digital. The emo/pop-punk night music is okay, but they didn't spin any major hits by major emo bands that you would instantly recognize and just feel excited about. There isn't a visible DJ. We had fun at this bar. My friend said he would go there again. It's alternative with a young crowd, but there's no single lifestyle look. On 24th Street.", "author": "Denise C."}

He (the DJ) was an older dude who had a long gray beard and tattoos and let's just say that nobody was gonna tap him on the shoulder and say \"excuse me, can you please play some hip hop\"?  \n\nThen at 9 PM that DJ left and it became \"Emo Night\" and I lasted about 5 minutes before I was punching myself in the face repeatedly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-17", "description": "I imagine that there are some polarized opinions when it comes to the newly renovated Pop's.  In San Francisco, and especially in The Mission, the debate over gentrification is practically as heated as debates about religion in the 1500's.  Granted, we don't see much burning at the stake, but you rarely find opinions that are not pretty set on one side or the other.  Most will either welcome the changes to Pop's or despise them.  \n\n\"Pop's, Before\":  I came exactly one time.  It was 12:30pm on a Saturday.  I was a bit hung-over (Maybe a bit more than a bit) and had to use the bathroom.  Those were the only reasons I stopped in:  Hangover Remediation and a Bathroom.  This was a Super-Divey place.  Dark, dank, rough around the edges.  I probably wouldn't have stayed for more that my Pit-Stop and one Cheap Beer, but (see the original review) I found out that people actually put Bacon in Bloody Mary's.  I won't lie - for all the dark-ness and dank-ness, for all \"go-the-f-back-to-suburbia\" this place had to offer... They crushed the Bloody.  This thing was killer.\n\n\"Pop's, After\":  If the sign on the door hadn't said Pop's when I walked in, there is no way I would have believed this was the same place.  The place has been turned classy.  It's like Rocker Tommy Lee turned into Realtor Phil Dunphy.  It's now a nice, although not super-pretentious, neighborhood bar.  You can take a look at the new photos - if you remember what it once looked like, you'll be stunned.  They still had the Bacon Bloody, but it wasn't quite the same.  Again, check out my photo vs. some of the originals from \"Pop's, Before\".  The service was nice, the crowd was not much different than a place like R Bar in the Tendernob (yeah yeah, I know some of you think that place is much more fratty than it really is, a la Wreck Room).  \n\nSo, what is the real analysis?  Was it better to have the edgy, divey, f-the-squares joint?  Is it better to have another perfectly affable spot with daylight and nice finishes?   We've endured another Neil Young to Neil Diamond transformation.  But, such is life in SF.  I don't know what the answer is, but I know in SF that this is something that is a fact of life, writ large.  For what it's worth, I think they did a nice job.  Had I not known \"Pop's, Before\", I would have found this to be a nicely-finished neighborhood spot that was friendly and had good service.  But, there is a little something in my \"go-the-f-back-to-suburbia\" soul that reminds me that eventually, suburbia can swallow you up and turn you into everyone else.  And trust me, I grew up in Golden Valley, Minnesota.\n\nIf there's a moral of the story, it's that times change.  Often times progress is good - but it is worth thinking about what won't be anymore.  Some of the change is colored by nostalgia.  But, I wonder what exactly we lose...", "author": "Adam S."}

Monday night, Tuffy gives out free bacon, Wednesdays have Handlebars at the DJ table, Thursdays in the summer time there are BBQs and cookouts and once a year they have Tricycle races.\n\nThe crowd on the average night is usually a close-knit, loud-mouth group of regulars and a few randoms who wandered into the bar. The busier nights, which tend to be Wednesdays and weekends can get a rather eclectic clientele in there that has you wondering, \"Where did these people come from?\" But if you are a fan of flannel, have tattoos and know how to talk shit, you'll probably fit right in here.\n\nIts a comfortable place, too far out to be picked up on the radar of the super hip, so it tends to be completely lacking of airs.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-12-19", "description": "Last night me and some rando at a party got talking about the band Knapsack. The conversation led to the one time I went to Pop's for their mid 90s emo night. My review of this place is really only based on that one night, but nonetheless, I don't really feel guilty painting a broad brush. If you've been to one Mission dive bar full of nu-hipsters, you've been to them all. \n\n\nI was excited to go for mid nineties emo night bc I've always had a soft spot for this era that I should probably be ashamed of, but am not. So I roll up in there with a couple of people who I didn't really know, but equally had the same embarrassing love for this genre. First thing that happened was a song I really liked was played. Then, a couple real poser tracks showed up. Shit like newer Hot Water Music and AFI. I looked around and noticed that Pops' particular brand of Mission clientele was that of the skateboarder hipster type. Lots of tight jeans, beanies, and two sizes two big flannels. Also, not many girls. This kind of put in context why the songs I didn't want to hear were being played. I imagine those songs are on a lot of skate videos and the DJs must play to the crowd every once in awhile. \n\nSo anyway, hanging out most the night was fine. Nothing spectacular happened other than a few to-be-expected snubs from people with poor social skills and of minimal accomplishment. I tried to shoot the shit with a couple people while trying to get drinks and was given the \"who the fuck are you\" look. The older I get, I still don't get this. I mean, if you don't want to hang out and be social, go drink at home. Not to mention, you're not gonna get laid if you're not willing to talk to people But again, I'm old enough to know that these places tend to always be like that, so I can only blame myself I guess.\n\nIn summary. Emo night was nothing to rave about. Drinks were cheap. Bar tenders weren't anything of note (good or bad). Basically, it offers nothing to compensate for the fact that it's too far a walk from BART and not close enough to other bars for me to go to when I inevitably get bored of this place.", "author": "Matt P."}

Lots of local celebs, including a handful of pro skaters and messengers who ride track bikes. A bunch of hipster shit goes down. There is a 10:3 man:woman kinda thing going down as well. The dude mansion always shows up by-the-way, and Mancini, the door dude, does tattoos and that's cool. Yeah, this place got old fast for me. My friends are always there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-05-19", "description": "At the time of this writing, Pop's had a total of 66 Yelp reviews. This actually surprised me, given my initial reaction was something along the lines of, \"What? No love for Pop's?\" But then I realized that this was more of a blessing in disguise considering the popularity of that other bar on 16th & Albion that every decent person quit going to years ago (175 and counting). Either Pop's manages to stay off the Mission bar-hopping radar or most of the people that come here don't own computers. One thing's for sure though; it's pretty hard budgeting for one when you've blown your entire life savings on a $3000 track bike that hasn't seen a day at the velodrome in its life. Which is part of the irony here too on a certain night of the week when people flock here for  dollar Hamm's. But I'm not going to talk too much shit, the bartenders are attentive and courteous despite the all too frequent run-in with a coked out patron. And it's also deep enough in the Mission to discourage the occasional yuppie intent on slumming it for an evening. Don't come here hungry though, that bakery next door is already hard at work while you're drinking your life away. And I guess they don't take well to laser-pointing your favorite pastries from outside the window either.", "author": "Jenn W."}

Hey people, fixed gear bikes are good for two things - parts and riding on the indoor wooden Velodrome track in France.  Riding them around to look cool is stupid and dangerous (but you've probably found that out already in a faceplant).  You need really strong calves to handle a fixed gear since there are no coaster breaks (not skinny chicken legs like most of the specimens have at Pop's).  If you're a pretty young girl don't expect to get served anytime soon by one of the female bartenders unless your cute boyfriend orders for you.
