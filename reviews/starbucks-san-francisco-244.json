It was the Chunky Monkey frappichino from the secret menu. But all the Starbucks workers we're so nice. \n\nI asked the Starbucks worker if I can use a towel and I can clean it myself. They said don't worry. They would clean it. And they even replaced the same drink for us. \n\nAll the Starbucks workers were so nice. I was very apologenic . But they kept saying it's okay. That happens often. \n\nWhen we first walked up and gave the cashier the order for the chunky monkey. He was smiling and said \"it's my first day and I get this complicated order hahah\". But he was playful about it. As complicated as the order was, he was smiling and asked help to take the order. \n\nAfter we accidentally spilled the drink,  the person cleaning the drink said \"go back to cashier and get a replacement. I felt so bad.  Because when we went back, we did that same exact complicated order to him again. Only this time, he knew exactly what was in it and didn't have to check. Good memory! \n\nThis was the first time we ever spilled Starbucks drink. When we spilled it, both my daughters looked at each other in shock. \"Oh no, that was an expensive drink!\"  And they later said to me \"when we spilled the drink, I was thinking there's still some left in the cup and we can just drink what's left over and leave. But when all the Starbucks workers offered to replace the whole drink, my daughters were all so happy. \n\nWe walked out the door talking about how nice everyone at Starbucks was and how good the drink tasted. \n\nUsually we just walk in, but the drinks, and walk out.

This location is repeatedly unorganized and chaotic. Today in particular, no one behind the counter seemed to really know what they were doing. The only one who even remotely seemed like she knew what she was doing was Katie, but she had a nasty attitude. I was very polite because I understand they are busy on the weekends and don't mind waiting a little longer as long as the people are friendly. Once my drinks were finally made she told me it would be a few more minutes for the food (warming) items. I said no problem. Eventually the items were tossed in the mobile order section and everyone behind the counter ignored customers who asked if they could check if their mobile orders were ready. While I was waiting I observed SEVERAL people who did not receive certain parts of their order, and when the baristas were questioned, they picked up an empty food item bag and said, \"oh yeah, we're out.\" Hello.. would be nice to know. Once my food order was tossed on the counter and I got Katie's attention she snapped and said very rudely, \"NEXT TIME JUST TELL US YOU'RE WAITING FOR A MOBILE ORDER.\" Hmm that's weird because you handed me my drinks which said \"mobile order 2 of 4.\" And told me the food would be just a few more mins.

I made the mistake of returning to this Starbucks with my family after purchasing a more expensive drink earlier to get an iced coffee refill.

So...leaving for a short time and returning wasn't ok? Whatever.\nI wasn't thrilled, but I could deal with that. \n\nThen Anthony had to \"add value\" with his douchey, unsolicited and self-satisfied pronouncement that \"You wouldn't take a cup back to Denny's and ask for a discount, would you?\" \n\nNo one asked you, rockstar!\nAlthough, if Denny's aggressively pushed their rewards program and that was one of its features?

Anthony was the one who took my order and I almost just wanted to walk out. Okay, maybe he was having a bad day but why do I deserve to be treated the way I was treated. I ordered a frapp and he asked if that was all with attitude or maybe I took it the wrong way. Okay fine whatever. Then, I went to scan my card but he didn't tell me I was on the wrong scanner til waaaay later. I still felt like he was being mehh, but whatever I was the stupid one. Lastly, I wanted to refill my card since I didn't have enough, but I felt like he was giving me a hard time since he said I should've reloaded before ordering. I get why, but I never had that problem ever. I felt like today was a bad day and maybe I'll just go to another location from now on. Also, a costumer asked to have milk added in their drink and Anthony responded ok....................What kind of milk, I just think he could've handled the situation better. If I was in their shoes, I would've felt like I should've never asked for milk or something. Shoooot, if I knew I was going to feel shitty trying to add money on my card then I would've not even done it! So much for being a gold member...

Anthony came from behind the counter and was kind enough to give me an education about coffee beans. I purchased a bag of Guatemalan Beans. We tried one serving of the beans with a pour over technique and it was too dark for our taste. Today I ventured out in the pouring rain to see if they could lend me some assistance. Gene was such a delight!!!! I spoke of my dislike to the initial bean and he suggested the breakfast blend. We made the trade and we look forward to enjoying our coffee.

When I pointed this out, the barista told me it's because the decaf espresso they use is too hot and melts the ice. She offered to remake it for me and I asked if she can make it thicker, I don't want another watery one. She said she can add more ice. \n\nThis time it came out a perfect consistency but had very little flavor. I took it and it was fine but there needed to me more flavoring added to compensate for the extra ice. I don't get what the problem is, I have been ordering this drink all over the state for years and have never had this happen before. But the past 2 times I ordered (here and on Van Ness & California a few days ago) this hap happened. \n\nI also don't understand why this was served at all..if you know decaf frapps will turn out the wrong consistency, you should stop serving them until you get this issue resolved.

What is inconvenient is that apparently the barristas don't have access to the music system.  So when Starbucks is pushing their new disco album, that is what plays on the speakers above my head.  Do you know how hard it is to job search with the Bee Gees singing Night Fever Night Fever.  I can't even make follow up phone calls without worrying about the shrill falsetto of one of the Gibbs brothers above me.  \n\nIt is especially nice when the disco music is accompanied by a crying baby and two older gentlemen yelling into a phone IN CHINESE!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-10-26", "description": "Dear Mr. Howard \"Starbucks\" Schultz,\n\nFirst of all, I must confess that I am a huge fan of yours. Second, there are a few things that you should know before opening in Italy - you will probably find most of the following tips rather banal, but I will share them with you anyway because I believe in narcissism, participation, and coffee beans.\n\nI am aware that you had an epiphany in Milan, back in 1982, or so the story goes. Apparently, you marveled at the atmosphere you encountered within the espresso bars and decided to replicate it in the US. Well, it worked great, didn't it?\n\nActually, you did much more than that. You created a brand new world, a new language, and new social rituals. Now Starbucks is a media empire, not just a chain of coffee houses. You have many detractors, especially in Europe, but I am not one of them. I am writing this letter as an encouragement to enter the Italian market as soon as possible and start a Frappuccino revolution.\n\nNow, I am aware that Italy is a very complicated market. Ultra-protected by unfair anti-free market laws, powerful trade unions, cryptic bureaucracy designed to discourage even the more energetic foreign investor... Italy can be a scary place. In addition to legal issues there are some cultural aspects that you should bear in mind: Italians are extremely conservative and close-minded when it comes to edible things. No, really. They are extremely proud of their food culture and quick to label as \"blasphemous\" every attempt to deviate even slightly from the Canon (read some comments just to get an idea). For instance, If you dare ordering a cappuccino in a restaurant while enjoying your meal you will get incinerating looks from your waiter. \n\nEven though this behavior is clearly provincial, and ultimately inappropriate, it is the widely accepted, even encouraged - for more information about this, check Stanley Tucci's \"Big Night\" (1996). It's the same with soccer and fashion: it is just impossible to have a rational conversation with an Italian on these topics. Just smile and move on. As a side note, on average, Italians are old. Otherwise said, the country is ruled by old farts. And old farts are reluctant to try new things, think different, and experiment. \n\nThat is, selling a tall banana douche latte to a 65+ year old might be tough. However, Starbucks should have a bigger appeal on local hipsters, tweens, and young cosmopolitans. More and more Italians are traveling abroad, thanks to low-fare flights, the strength of the Euro currency, international school exchange programs and pervasive ennui. Unlike the Old Guard, the new wave is willing to try new things instead of criticizing a priori what does not conform to the predictability of the so-called culturally imposed \"Traditions\" (mangia! mangia!). \n\nMost Italians have not ever experienced the coffee house culture that flourished in most civilized countries, from Austria to the US, from the UK to Germany, from Scandinavia to Central Europe (that's why we emigrated). Ray Oldenburg is a stranger here.\n\nIn Italy, coffee is mostly consumed quickly, standing up like a horse, while other customers push you from behind to reach for the sugar, the milk, and other amenities (the idea that these goods could be shared, on a separate table, is unthinkable - sugar, water and coffee, like the Bible, should be chained and restricted from public consumption). Coffee is just a quick boost, and the experience of consuming the drink is not pleasurable per se. Vice versa, Stabucks mainly sells pleasurable - not cursory - experiences, using coffee as a pretext. There is a huge difference. Can you pass the nutmeg? Thanks!\n\nAs an addendum, most Italians are willing to pay for the drink, but not for the experience. That is: they mostly care more about the quality of the coffee itself than the contextual elements (ambiance, music, people, relaxing atmosphere, books etc). The truth is that most are not even aware of anything that surrounds the coffee cup - otherwise they would flee the idiotic bars that plague the country. As you did in the US, you will need to teach the customers the new rules of the game. Brainwashing is strongly recommended. You need to erase decades of bad habits and Italians are notoriously recalcitrant. Take something banal like the notion of a queue. Italians are, by definition, anarchic and insubordinate. They simply won't stay in line. \n\nThey do not play by the rules. \"Rule\" is a foreign concept. They would do anything to disrupt what is politely accepted almost everywhere else - thus, you will need to emphasize signs like \"please wait here\", \"please order here\" etc. I would personally recommend the use of in-store electrified fences. Before launching Stabucks Italy you should know that crowd management is sorely lacking in this country! \n\nGood luck, Mr. Howard \"Starbucks\" Schultz!", "author": "Matt B."}
