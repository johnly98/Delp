I normally love super spicy food, but I wasn't in the mood to blow my palate in case it was actually hella spicy, so I just went for the KIO special. It wasn't really spicy at all, so I found myself wishing I got the hella spicy. The soup itself isn't necessarily super rich or super light, but I found the broth kind of sour. The bamboo that came with the ramen tasted like it was pickled, so maybe that was why the broth was sour? I'm a fan of spicy and sour soups, but it felt out of place in a bowl of ramen. I had some undercooked ramen noodles earlier in the week, so these were much better. Had a nice chew. The appetizers were good.

Conveniently located on Balboa and 36th/37th, near Purple Kow, KIO is an amazing ramen addition to the Richmond district. \n\nI came with two other friends not really expecting much, but we were pretty amazed at the food.\n\nYou have a choice of four different soup bases for ramen (see picture), each starting at $9.78. From there, you can add in different things at an extra cost. So I ordered a pork base ramen with a side of Ton katsu (that's fried pork cutlet) and extra noodles. We also ordered some gyoza and chicken karrage as sides. \n\nUsually with ramen joints, I don't get full with just a bowl, so you know ya boy had to order extra noodles to fill that belly up. But ya know honestly, the portion sizes they give you is enough that I could have done without the extra noodles.\n\nBut ANYWAAY back to the ramen. The base is made fresh daily and wasn't too salty (Waraku take notes!). It is slightly spicy though, but not so spicy that it completely destroys you. The ramen noodles themselves were at a perfect consistency. The charsiu was nice and tender. The egg could have been better though. I prefer the more yolky, liquidy kinda egg, but the one here was a tad bit over cooked. It was still delicious nonetheless. \n\nI personally think that the side dishes are where this place truly shines. The Katsus and chicken karrage here may be the best I've ever had. They are super crunchy and not too dry! The sides are also pretty cheap! I think they were all under $4-5 an order so we got a lot.\n\nThe service was good as well. The owner was super friendly and walked around frequently to ask us if everything was fine. Don't worry Mr.! Your food is the bombbbbb.com\n\nOverall this is an amazing new ramen place.

I highly recommend ordering multiple appetizers. You only get four pieces for the appetizers that we ordered, which was perfect because there were two of us. The gyoza was very crispy on the outside and absolutely delicious. The miso chicken wings were outstanding. They were crispy and perfectly seasoned, allowing you to actually taste the chicken. I also ordered chicken katsu as an extra with my entree. The fried chicken strips were perfectly cooked. They were crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. They were not that flavorful, though, but the sauce that came with it more than made up for it. Best... Sauce... EVER. \n\nWe both ordered Ramen for our entrees. My brother got the classic pork flavored broth and I ordered my personal favorite, classic miso. Compared to other ramen restaurants that I've been to, the classic ramen here is quite mild in flavor. The broth was lightly flavored with miso and the vegetables added a rich, earthy flavor that was very satisfying. The pork strips were fatty and delicious. I tried my brother's soup broth and it was also mildly flavored, but had an earthier overtone. My only real complaint about the ramen with that the noodles were a little more al-dente then I prefer.

I was excited for a new ramen place in the neighborhood and really wanted to like it, opting for this over the 4 star place down the block hoping the lackluster yelp reviews were wrong. But they weren't. :(\n\nI ordered the original ramen with pork broth, and added fried garlic, extra spinach, and quail eggs. The moment I dug into the bowl, I knew I had made a mistake coming here. The ramen noodles looked a lot like instant ramen noodles, and when I took a first sip of the broth my heart sank. There was no flavor, there was no love. The half braised chicken egg that came with it had a yolk that looked and tasted stale and gelatinous. \n\nHow can so many good looking ingredients taste so flat? I actually had to add soy sauce to get even a little depth of flavor. I forced myself to finish what I could because mom taught me not to waste food, but it was a struggle. \n\nThe two stars is because decor was nice, and service was okay.
