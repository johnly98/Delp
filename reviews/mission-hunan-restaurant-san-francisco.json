Here are the points:\n\nThe good: The food here is very, very delicious. Their seafood here are especially worth trying and the wonton soup was so flavorful. The menu is in both languages and do offer a pretty wide selection of classic and traditional Chinese food which I appreciate. For good food in generous portions, the price point was phenomenal. The servers here are very timely and they all speak some or a little English to accommodate English-speaking customers. I have been to a few \"scary\" mom-and-pop type of Chinese establishments, but this one was pretty nice.\n\nThe bad: The floors of the bathroom seems to always be wet. The bathroom smells unkosher (maybe some deodorizer might fix this). The tables are missing utensils and condiments. Depending on when you show up to dine at Mission Hunan, the wait time for your food to arrive might be very long. Even if it is after the lunch rush when there is no customers around, this problem persists. The restaurant is not fancy at all and, from some angle, one might say it looks a little ghetto.\n\nThe ugly: The employees here yack off all day in Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese. It is hard to enjoy your food or sometimes focus on eating when you hear restaurant employees quacking away loudly like arguing ducks in the middle of the dining space or behind the counter. I feel like telling them to shut the hell up, but, decided not to, as this might be a cultural thing. \n\nEveryone should have lunch or dinner hear. It is not shabby at all and I certainly enjoyed my experience!", "author": "Robert M."}

That being said, don't come here expecting the best Chinese food you've ever had or the 100% most authentic.\n\nThe meal started off with a soup, which I was expecting a hot and sour for, but it ended up being a variation of minestrone soup. It was still good tasting, just a bit unexpected and odd at the same time.\n\nThe Mongolian Beef was good though, very well made with a great selection of vegetables and a good flavor throughout. They also served the dish with a ton of rice, so it was easy to get really fully by the end of it. And at about ~$10 total it was a rather reasonably priced meal.", "author": "Tyler T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-10", "description": "While it's definitely not as gritty as it used to be, I admit I don't make it a point to spend much time around this part of the Mission.  Ditto for the likes of the Tenderloin and mid-Market.  That being said, I can certainly be swayed by the prospect of trying something new and/or delicious (the things I'd do for good food...), even when they aren't the trendiest spots or sitting on my list of (endless) bookmarks.   I just might be less excited, that's all...\n\nSince one of my relatives was impressed by the food at Mission Hunan, as well as their friendly prices, we decided to check them out despite how they're a bit out of the way for us.  As I looked over the menu though, as well as what others around us were having, nothing really stood out.  There may be a lot to choose from (including a variety of noodle dishes, clay pots, and sizzling platters), but most of their offerings are standard dishes, with nothing that seemed particularly special worth trying.  Spoiler alert - none of the dishes we ordered were either.\n\n-- BEEF WITH BROCCOLI...$10.28\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-hunan-restaurant-san-francisco?select=6ypnRSTWKsezMvMLeYRfoA)\nCertainly not the sexiest or most interesting dish you'll find on the menu (here or anywhere), but this actually wasn't bad.  Not amazing, but not bad.  The slices of beef were more soft than chewy and the broccoli was fresh and bright.  A shame that the portion size was a bit light, though.\n\n-- TWICE COOKED PORK with String Beans...$10.28\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-hunan-restaurant-san-francisco?select=opf-fMwjc0upUE86SEJJBg)\nCompared to our Beef with Broccoli dish, this felt like a much better value.  However, I can't say this one tasted as good.  The string beans, carrots, and onions were fine, but the sauce was too sweet for me.  What's more, the pork was uneven - some pieces were hard, others were okay. \n\n-- BEEF STEW CLAY POT...$12.88\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mission-hunan-restaurant-san-francisco?select=O12WG-_rm0S-IbRgANYcxQ)\nWhile I liked how juicy the mushrooms were and how flavorful the sauce was, I don't get why so much of the beef was torn up.  Sure, it was better than getting chunks of dry, tough meat, and the pieces that were intact were pretty tender, but most of this felt like a big, gloppy mess.\n\nLike my relative, a lot of the positive reviews from Yelp friends seemed to give Mission Hunan high marks for their value (at least, as of 7-8 years ago).  Though that might still be the case with their daily lunch specials and rice plates (they seemed pretty reasonable), I'd respectfully disagree in regards to what we had.  By no means are they pricey, but I feel like a lot of my usual haunts in the Richmond and the Sunset offer so much more - whether it's in terms of value, convenience, or flavor.  Meh...one less reason to come back here.", "author": "Mike L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-03", "description": "KOREAN CHICKEN\n\nMy dad used to work in San Francisco as an accountant. His favorite Chinese restaurant was Ming's on Mission Street (I think it used to be on 14th and Mission or 22nd and Mission). When I was little he would take my mom, sister, and me at that restaurant. That restaurant was a two-story building. The second story is where the bathroom was. One of my fond memories was going upstairs looking down at the open kitchen. It was cool to see how the cooks cooked the dishes. One of the other fond memories was my dad's favorite dish at that restaurant - Korean Chicken, which had a thick sweet soy sauce hard and crispy breading on the chicken wings. The sauce also has numerous chunks of diced garlic, which helped the amora. Since the breading was thick it was able to maintain its crispiness with the sauce. I assume since Korean Wings was an Americanized Chinese dish I would see this dish at other Chinese restaurants such as items as beef broccoli, sweet and sour pork, Mongolian beef, and General's Tso chicken. I could never find Korean Chicken at any Chinese restaurant that has Americanized items. So I believe the Korean Chicken was a specialty at Ming's. About ten years ago the Ming's I knew on Mission ceased to exist. So I never thought I would experience eating the Korean Chicken I experienced growing up again.\n\nAround that I passed by Mission Hunan Restaurant by accident. There's a dance studio I go to on Thursday nights that is about several blocks away from the 16th Street/ Mission Bart Station. About one block away from that Bart station is Mission Hunan Restaurant. When I first entered I looked at the menu and noticed the item Korean Chicken. These wings brought back great memories as they were the Korean Chicken I had at Ming's. There was something about that black, brown sauce. On my taste buds I can taste a some hot pepper oil and brown sugar. I believe to thicken the sauce there is some cornstarch. There's a concern that a heavily breaded chicken wing could be dry. The Korean Chicken at Mission Hunan Restaurant is moist. Everyone has a guilty pleasure of an Americanized Chinese dish. Mine are the Korean Wings at Mission Hunan Restaurant. About a couple of weeks ago on a Wednesday after Father's Day I came here to eat with my usual item Korean Chicken. I also had char siu (BBQ pork) over rice. Char siu is lately becoming another Chinese dish I like. The char siu at Mission Hunan Restaurant doesn't have the burnt ends but a moist meat with a sweet, fatty texture I like.\n\nMy rating is based upon that one dish - the Korean Chicken as I can't find this dish anywhere else. Lately the hipster scene is going to Korean restaurants to have some soy garlic wings. I believe the Korean Chicken at Mission Hunan Restaurant are better than any wings at a Korean restaurant. Maybe those wings at the Korean restaurants maybe more authentic than the Korean Chicken at Mission Hunan Restaurant. However I've had the soy garlic wings at the Korean restaurants and they don't taste half as good as the Korean Chicken at Mission Hunan Restaurant. If you are craving for wings at a Korean restaurants  I recommend to skip those restaurants and head to Mission Hunan Restaurant for some Korean Chicken.", "author": "Gerald R."}

I work down the street, and if you come for lunch, you'll see the real San Francisco. \n\nI started coming here enticed by their nondescript daily lunch special neatly written on a whiteboard displayed by the front door. Don't come here looking for shiplap or bearded hipsters making cocktails while juggling with their feet. This is a hole-in-the wall, get in and get out kind of place. Muni drivers often take their lunch breaks here, folks from the neighborhood abound, and a lively, quick-on-their feet waitstaff.\n\nIf you order something that isn't soup, you get free egg drop soup with your order. I usually order scrambled eggs and beef over rice, and if I'm feeling like I need to treat myself, I'll order it over fried rice. The beef is perfectly seasoned, mixed in to a soft and fluffy scrambled egg. The portions are huge. I mean h u g e. So I usually eat half and save the rest for dinner. \n\nMy favorite thing to watch while eating here is the incredible patience that the staff has with the different characters of the neighborhood. They approach everyone with compassion, but they don't take sh*t from nobody. They are happy to serve you beer, but don't be a jerk. They are happy to let you use the bathroom, but keep it clean. \n\nThere are days when you want to wear the clothes you wore last night, or maybe your pajamas, and get some greasy food, without seeing anyone you know on Valencia Street.

I killed it with my napkin, made sure the bugger (pun intended) was dead, went to throw it away, washed my hands, and when I returned to the table, I asked the waitress politely in Mandarin, \"Excuse me, may I have another napkin?\"\n\nHer, sounding very annoyed: \"But I already gave you 3 napkins!\" \n\nOne napkin for each of us.\n\nMe: \"But I had to use it to kill a bug, so I need another.\"\n\nAt least she went to get another napkin while my coworker remarked that she was really stupid.

Once inside the restaurant, it's your typical local Chinese joint. \n\nGiven the neighbourhood, the atmosphere of the restaurant, I was surprised to see the prices of the dishes. $9 to $10 for fried noodles and the like. I was expecting it to be around $8. Has inflation really gone mad? But when the dishes came out, they were in huge portions!! So, I guess that made up for the prices...

Food tastes great and it's my favorite Chinese takeout place in the city. For Americanized Chinese food, I go for the orange chicken and combination fried rice. The korean chicken is good. The hot and sour soup and the wonton soups are good as well. They don't skimp on the wontons or the veggies. They also have a delicious chili sauce that's very different from other restaurants. \n\nAmbience: it's clean, but the neighborhood isn't too great. Free parking in the back is awesome. \n\nService: the waitress/cashier is very nice and speaks pretty good English!\n\nBottom line: I recommend it for Americanized Chinese food takeout!

We take it all to go. \n\nWhen we get back to the apartment:\n\nMe: I could've sworn I said we only needed two bowls of rice...this is an entire to-go container of rice. \n\nAnd then later...WTF they gave us the duck head??

This is one of the main places we come to if we want Chineese. Love there soups, LOVE the Seafood Wonton soup, and combination Won Ton, we always get the Chicken Vegitables, and steamed rice.. Oh, another thing, there rice. a Small, is litterally the size of your soup bowl.. a mediem, will sometimes look like a Large, and .. well we never order a Large, since were never that many people.. Though, if you plan on going on your own, becaureful, because they do serve a LOT of food on one plate, theres no changing the size of the plate-- \"One size only\".. I go there once in a while for lunch, I've ordered a Chowmein with Chicken Fried rice, I felt that the plate was big enough for 2 people.. maybe 3.. but it was only $8.75. Not bad right? I guess you can always save the rest for dinner, or your tomorrows lunch. I've recently tried there Sweet & Sour Tilapia, and it's really good, my new favorite. though I think I'd like the Tilapia without the Sweet & Sour sauce, it's a little too sweet for me, and sticky.. but its good.. They have your basic sodas; coke, sprite, orange, etc, Snapple, if you want water, it's better to order the cup of water with ice, because they charge you for a bottled water, they have your basic beer, Coronas, Heniken, Tecate(I think?) etc. for about $3..\n\nthe service is pretty good, they sit you once you walk in, if theres a place for you to sit..if not the most you'd wait is maybe a minute or two. once you sit they give you their menus.. and give you about 5-10 minutes to look through it, and then come back and ask you what you'd like to drink, and if your ready to order.. the usual wait time for your food is about 6-10 minutes, depending on what you ordered.. you can ask them for tea while you wait.. or just to drink with your meal. I guess you can say were regulars, and know how they work. I would recomment this place to people, if your looking for a satisfying cheap Chineese meal :)\n\nOH, and also, if your looking for parking, my mom uses the parking lot from the walgreens, it's behind the bar next to it.. :) and there's always street parking.\n\nBut overall, there food is really good.. for a great price.. \nIn my opinion, It's worth it. and we continue to come here.", "author": "Mariana O."}

This is American Cantonese slop, which is about as far from Hunan cuisine as you can get without going to McDonald's. It is as cheap as McDonald's, but this doesn't necessarily explain why you get what you get. While running the risk of offending other Yelpers, I dare say that those who deem this \"authentic Chinese\" might consider taking a trip to China before you making such declarations. A little background in Chinese and specifically Hunan cuisine seems to be in order.\n\nTraditionally (which is measured in millennia), there are four primary cuisines of China: Guangdong (aka Cantonese), Huaiyang, Shandong, and Sichuan.  This is common knowledge to all Mainland Chinese people.  However, they are also well aware of the more recently added fifth primary cuisine - the cuisine of the people and their immortalized leader - Hunan.  \n\nChairman Mao hailed from Hunan, a central province of China know for cooking and eating the spiciest of all Chinese food. That's right, even the hotter than Sichuanese.  However, there is more than just spice in Hunan food.  For example, no self-respecting \"authentic\" Hunan restaurant would leave Mao Shi Hong Shao Rou (pork Chairman Mao style, which is savory-sweet) off the menu. It just wouldn't happen. Unless of course, the people running the restaurant were in fact not Hunanese.  And herein lies the crux of Mission Hunan.\n\nThe staff here all Cantonese and the owners are either Cantonese or Taiwanese, as evidenced by there use of tradition Chinese characters, as opposed to simplified.  In addition, any \"authentic\" Hunanese restaurant would have red chilies hanging from multiple locations throughout the restaurant, or at least one near the door way. This is an auspicious symbol and one that is not taken lightly in Hunan. \n\nNow that authenticity has been dealt with, how about the food?  After not recognizing a single traditional Hunan dish on the menu, I ordered the \"Hunan Crispy Chicken\" for lunch. I was served a plate of poorly fried chicken smothered in oyster sauce with a side of steamed broccoli and rice. This is barely worthy of being called crappy Cantonese food, let alone the broadly defined crappy Chinese food. So, I ate my food, paid my $6.30 + tip and left.\n\nUnsatisfied and somewhat annoyed at the audacity of the owners and staff to so blatantly disrespect what is perhaps one of the finest Chinese culinary traditions: Hunan caixi.  The Chairman would certainly roll over in his grave if he knew what these people were doing in the name of his beloved cuisine.\n\nHunanese should be cheap, spicy and delicious. This place is definitely cheap.  If you are on a budget, have at it. But remember, there are plenty of other delicious cheap eats in the area. I suggest move on.", "author": "Alex P."}

They have quality, great tasting dishes piled high with the freshest food for a low price. They even serve a free bowl of house soup with every rice plate. Being located at 16th near Capp you would not expect to find such wonderful food. Check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised!", "author": "Mark G."}

Mehhhhhhh.\" But it turned out to be pretty good stuff!\n\nI had the beef chow fun to go and the portion was huge! The only word to describe the manner in which one must eat a meal so large is \"laboriously\". And it was really, really good! Some of the best beef chow fun I've had, in fact. For 6.90 it made a delicious lunch, dinner, and lunch for tomorrow. \n\nI guess someone ordered extra soup or something so they had a few bowls left over and I got one for free!\n\nService is fast and friendly. That one girl with the helmet head hair that appears to be running the whole damn place is awesome. \n\nWill DEFINITELY be back to try the panfried noodles.", "author": "Polly F."}

There are many things not on the English menu.  I've tried them by asking for them and by looking at what the Chinese work crews order at lunchtime and pointing.  I LOVE the beef stew clay pot.  I always ask for extra tendon.  If you're not familiar with \"beef stew\" at Chinese restaurants, it refers to the cut of meat - namely chuck and beef tendon - yummy!  They will combine any ingredients you ask for.  I like lop chong (Chinese sausage) and scrambled eggs.  I like bitter melon and beef stew.  I like the moo-qua (my spelling) with garlic sauce.  You won't find these on the menu.  The only thing they wouldn't make for me is pork fat back and oyster clay pot.  I have to be content with the roast pork and oyster pot - it is delicious.  The only way to get the fat back is with mustard greens.  They also have \"Chinese soup\" everyday as well as the soup of the day.  Try it on a day when it's tender greens - excellent!  One of their soups du jour is beef vegetable.  This soooo good!   I also get an extra order to go.  Love the Mongolian chicken as well.  Try it.", "author": "Ron A."}

My favorite dish is their wor wontons, which include shrimp, chicken, veggies, and wontons. The people make their own wontons daily, so they taste very fresh. Their other great dishes include this salt and pepper rod cod. I am not sure if it is on the menu, but they are more than happy to customize the orders for you. As someone who is on a low-sodium and low-fat diet, the waitresses there understand my needs and would steam all the entrees for me.\n\nThe place is usually quite busy during dinner and lunch times, but once the waitresses got your orders, it is pretty quick for the dishes to arrive. Another note is that the customer service is very good. The waitresses there are very friendly and trilingual in Chinese, English and Spanish.", "author": "Eric C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-12-12", "description": "The food at Mission Hunan is so very average-almost repulsive actually-no taste etc.  the staff are usually friendly and the service is quick.  the neighborhood is a bit shacky with open drug dealing, public urination, and addicts talking to themselves between fixes but thats just the way it is--good or bad.  I have gone there on occassion just because its simple, clean and I am usually hard pressed to change my predictable ways.\n\nSince Valencia Sreet and 16th Sreet are getting much nicer restaurants- and because one of the waitresses DEMANDED that I leave a tip  on my last visit 10.07 I will not be going back.  Yelling after the meal is paid for in full demanding a tip is very unusual.  With my nephew about the see a spike and mike film across the street is unacceptable.  Seeing the place as a convient location before the film, and being set in my ways is not a good reason to go to a crappy restaurant.  I speculate the wait staff  at Mission Hunan have made friends with the local street addicts to pull in customers and have begun stealing their drugs.   \n\nLook at the place when you walk by.  The waitresses look unhappy and very tired.  Compare Mission Hunan to the newer restaurant scene in the area and you see a happier, livelier crowd eating good food elsewhere.  Don't eat at Mission Hunan.

I enjoyed their huge wontons for the wonton soup, I like their sweet&sour chicken (when it's piping hot) and their combo fried rice is tasty. The prices are cheap and the portions are generous. \n\nHowever I wouldn't go back there if they did what they did to me two weeks ago with my family. We just finished lunch and we were about to pay the bill. My parents don't have a lot of money and they intend not to spend like they do. They stopped us at the door and DEMANDED that we give them a bigger tip because we were a party of four. My dad was mad at first on what they were talking about, he thought that we had under paid and when we checked the money he gave them it was the correct amount. When he found out that he was asked to give a bigger tip he just walked away in anger and disgust that they could ask something like that. We had been going to their restaraunt for a while and they had never asked us for more tip. My mom out of embarrassment just gave an extra dollar because that was all they had.\n\nFirst of all, it didn't say ANYWHERE on their menu or a sign in their restaraunts that parties of four or more HAVE TO PAY a bigger tip. If they do continue to do that, they are just being desperate for more money. Also I think tips should be earned by the quality of food and service you get, and honestly their service and attitude wasn't so great when we ate there. \n\nI like thier food because it's tasty but I just wished they would have a better attitude.", "author": "cecilia s."}

This is pretty darn close to the authentic Hong Kong style eating hall that would often host large parties and family banquets. The food is what you are here for and not much else, unless you speak Cantonese- then it's like you are in-the-loop and the staff get very chatty. The decor is plain, simple and practical, with the standard feng shui fish tank w/ gold fish and koi- signs of good fortune and of course the obligatory plastic plant, the bathroom is disappointing so you're best off doing take out. The service is also very much operating at a no-frills but efficient level- your dishes will land promptly and loudly on the table. If you know your way around the menu then you can't go wrong, and the portions are generous. The shrimp wonton noodle soup, chicken, pork, beef and seafood stews are deelish, i usually order the BBQ pork (char-siu), and tao mui (pea sprout stir-fried w/ garlic), and the ginger scallion chicken. The tofu and mushroom veggie stews in clay pot are also great choices for the summer evenings when you are in the Mission and have a craving for Cantonese style cuisine but don't want to trek all the way out to Chinatown.", "author": "Akash D."}
