This is NOT the case when checking out Salt & Straw.  I freaking LOVED my visit here.\n\nLet me be completely blunt :  There is a LONG line when you get there.  The line extends outside... where SF weather can try to blow you away, or the nasty bus & street smells can chase you away.  BUT don't be discouraged!!! The line moves at a pretty good pace and they post their menu on the windows so you're ready when it's finally your turn.\n\nThe workers are AMAZING.  Every single one of them has such enthusiasm and patience.  It's as if they know you were waiting in line for errmm... maybe 20 min or more and are hoping you forgive them by being so kind and lively.  (Which yes, I forgive!!!).  I definitely appreciate the questions they ask you and knowledge they give you.  \n\nThe flavors I fell in LOVE with:\n- Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches\n- Salted, Malted, Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough\n\nThere really are no words to describe these flavors except DELICIOUS.  I have never had ice cream this grand anywhere else.  They are even great together (which I shared with my bf, of course).  The waffle bowl is a smart pairing as well. \n\nI'm pretty happy Salt & Straw made its way to NorCal and am hoping for the day it finds a home in my side of the bay.", "author": "Rossel C."}

You will have to wait for your turn since the staff are trained to fully explain flavors/products to customers and give them as much free samples as requested. (this is the real reason for the long lines!)\n\nI refuse to wait in long lines so the couple of times I've been here happen by chance, usually when I'm hopping off the #22 bus line or friends wanted to come here and there were only 2 people ahead of us.\n\nEvery month Salt & Straw releases 4-5 different flavors highlighting nature's best: summer saw a lot of berries and cheeses, spring brought floral flavors, fall is always exciting because of Halloween (Dracula's blood pudding? candytopia? no pumpkin spice anything in sight, Starbucks can keep that!) and winter usually retains more the familiar flavors like their classic Sea Salt with caramel ribbons or Sightglass Coffee. \n\nA few seasonal standouts to me have been the roasted strawberries and coconut. This was an intense expression of the pure fruit. Literally, you could taste nothing but fresh strawberries mixed with coconut milk (vegans rejoice!) and I remember this from last year because SF also hit 100+ degrees and in a decade of living in fog filled SF, this was quite unheard of. Another weird flavor was the smoked bone marrow with cherries. It left me feeling odd as I do typically like that combination, but in ice cream form, it was just that: strange.\n\nOn the next warm SF day (ha!) I'd most likely get the honey lavender or the Organic Root's Arbequina Olive Oil. You should try those if you haven't!\n\nI'm not sure I can justify paying more than $7 for a single scoop of ice cream with an extra topping and freshly made waffle cone all the time. (nor could my waistline take the abuse) I like it very much when I do have t, but I'm not crazy about it. How come Bi-Rite or Humphrey Slocumbe aren't as overpriced?", "author": "Janice C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-07-31", "description": "The ice cream at Salt & Straw is really good; perhaps the best I've had in San Francisco.\n\nThis is a chain from Portland with two locations in SF. This store in Pacific Heights opened in April 2017 and another location opened 6 months later, less than 2 miles away, in Hayes Valley in October 2017. At the time of writing this review, there are 15 locations across the West Coast. \n\nWhat differentiates Salt & Straw from the competition is its wide variety of high quality and unique ingredient and flavor combinations. In this sense, it reminds me a lot of Jeni's Splendid Ice Creams from where I'm from (most of Jeni's locations are in the Midwest and South). When we visited, Salt & Straw offered 13 classic flavors like Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache and Black Olive Brittle & Goat Cheese plus 5 special guest chef collaboration flavors like Duck Crackling with Cherry Preserves and Ras el Hanout & Pickled Rose Petal Jam (ras el hanout is a North African spice mix). The chefs hailed from cities where there is a Salt & Straw location. The chef collaboration flavors change monthly. All of Salt & Straw's ice cream flavors are handmade in small batches using seasonal, local ingredients.\n\nA handful of flavors have direct ties to Bay Area local businesses such as Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate and Berkeley Olive Grove's Olive Oil. I'm not sure if these are SF exclusives or if they're available at all Salt & Straw locations.\n\nI sampled a few flavors including Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons, Honey Lavender, and Chocolate Gooey Brownie. All of the flavors were terrific. I experienced immediate satisfaction as soon as each flavor hit my mouth. It made deciding which flavor to order difficult. My friend and I settled on scoops of Salted Malted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough and Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches, both classic flavors. They were excellent. The Salted Malted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough was rich and creamy with delectable, chewy chunks of cookie dough and sweet fudge swirls. The Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches tasted like a wonderful strawberry cake with a yummy strawberry jam. This flavor is made with Oxnard strawberries from the Oxnard Plain in Southern California. In general, all of the flavors I tried were nice and bold and very comforting.\n\nPrices during our visit were as follows:\n\nIce cream\n* Single scoop (tennis ball size) - $5\n* Double scoop (tennis ball size) - $7\n* Kids scoop (golf ball size) - $4\n* Split scoop (1 scoop, 2 flavors) - $0.50 extra\n* Tasting flight (4 kids scoops) - $11\n* Pint - $11\n\nExtras\n* Waffle cone - $1.25\n* Hot fudge, caramel, whipped cream, hazelnuts - $1 each\n* Finishing salt, sprinkles - $0.50 each\n\nThey also offer sundaes ($8.50 each), floats ($7.75), and whole-pint milkshakes ($10.50). These are \"gourmet\" ice cream prices and pretty much what you should expect for ice cream of this caliber (higher end), especially in the city. We visited just before 8pm on a Friday and a small line had already built up inside. The line moved pretty fast, however, even with customers sampling.  My friend and I went through the line, sampled, and got our orders in only 7 minutes. Speedy.\n\nThe staff was helpful, friendly, and efficient.\n\nThe shop is at the corner of Fillmore and Sacramento (entrance on Fillmore) with very limited seating inside (counters against the storefront windows) and a small bench outside. Complimentary self-serve water is available just inside the entrance.\n\nTL;DR - For great ice cream in San Francisco, I recommend this place.", "author": "Daniel B."}

My girlfriend has been begging me to take her to a Salt & Straw ever since they opened in SF - she loves her unique ice cream flavors. I used to be happy with just vanilla before moving to SF. \n\nInstead of sharing, we ordered 2 single scoops in a cup. She opted for the Tokyo PB&J, and I got the sea salt and caramel ribbons. Both were like nothing I've ever tasted before. The flavors are perfectly paired, unique, and so memorable. The ice cream is handmade, and you can tell. It's creamy, soft, and the perfect texture. There's nothing like salt and straw between the texture and flavor, although bi rite is a close second. I think salt & straw wins with their variety of unique and \"limited edition\" flavors. \n\nDon't be discouraged by the line. It moves really quickly. The staff are friendly, and they are cool with samples as long as it doesn't hold up the line. I liked that the shop was spacious and not like your typical SF ice cream shop.

Also, I'm not a huge honey fan, so I was glad it wasn't too strong here.\n\nHappy I finally tried the Salt & Straw in SF.

Specifically for this location and experience. Their limited edition flavors really caught my eye. i've always been a fan of floral flavored scents and taste. they had two in particular that I wanted to try since they are only available for the month of April. I got the Spring Flower Cream and the rose/ lavender petals. these two are sooooo good! I probably wouldn't recommend getting both together because the rose/ lavender is more of a sorbet, whereas the other is more of a cream base. definitely different and unique. i really enjoyed them!   the flavors are enhanced enough, but not overpowering to where you can't finish.", "author": "Audrey K."}

My party came here for dessert after dinner around 9pm and there was still a decent line out the door. The line wrapped around the store and we waited for about 20min before we got to the front of the line.\n\nThis place has a lot of really unique flavors. On top of that, they do seasonal flavors too. Since it's close to Valentine's day, the theme was around chocolate, so most of their seasonal flavors were chocolate-related. One thing that I also love about Salt & Straw is that you can technically try as many flavors as you want before making a decision. I tend to be somewhat indecisive when it comes to picking flavors, so I really appreciate being able to try different ones before I make up my mind. \n\nI think I ended up trying 5-6 flavors before I decided to get one of the seasonal flavors - Dick Taylor's Black Fig and Madagascar Chocolate. It sounds exotic but it's actually a good flavor because the tartness of the fig actually matches really well with the chocolate taste (the slight bitterness when you eat dark chocolate). Even though each scoop is $5, you get a HUGE scoop. I definitely recommend sharing with someone. You are able to get the ice cream in a cup or in a sugar cone, which is free.

I was helped by this super nice girl who showed no ounce of impatience when I asked to try like 10 flavors (which was a little culture shock coming from the east coast LOL) She explained the seasonal flavors and their usual flavors , but their usual flavors were anything but normal.\n\nI tried the almond brittle, lavender, roasted strawberry, and a few more I couldn't remember. Each one made my decision for two flavors so much harder. I ended up choosing the roasted strawberry and lemon custard olive oil! \n\nThe lemon custard olive oil was very unique- I expected more sour and tangy, but the olive oil balanced it out so well, I can't even explain it! And the roasted strawberry was a local favorite and I could taste why. How do they create such flavors ?! I'm definitely returning here when I go back to San Francisco. You won't be disappoint with this unique artisan ice cream shop.", "author": "Catherine W."}

I can't remember what happened exactly that led to this place, but I do remember it was cold outside and there was still a line out the door. Granted, the line did move pretty fast and give the customers a lot of time to browse the menu... parking is all on the streets and metered till 6pm so keep your eyes peeled if you're coming to this area before then. \n\nTheir menu is pretty extensive. They have a good amount of flavors that get you thinking and if that's not enough they also have a seasonal menu, too, that makes you think you need to get more than 1 giant scoop because you kinda wanna taste everything and anything they had to offer. \n\nFor what you're paying I think you're getting a pretty good amount. And it looks even more impressive when you're eating it on a cone because holy hell, take a photo. Put it on the 'gram. You are eating something photo worthy right now, foo'.\n\nThey don't limit you on how many flavors you can try, but to be nice and courteous my boyfriend and I limited ourselves to 2 samples each before deciding on our flavors and moving on out from the shop to the outside world. \n\nYes, I am for the hype. My sweet tooth is for the hype. Waiting in a long line for ice cream may sound insane, but San Francisco does have great places to go and hey.. it's one night out of your whole life.

We came here at around 4 PM on a weekend and the line was out the door. We waited about 30 minutes until we ordered. \n\nYou can sample all the flavors your heart desires, and I ended up ordering a scoop of honey lavender and a scoop of strawberry in a waffle cone. The honey lavender was the perfect mix of honey and lavender, while the strawberry was a bit too sour-y tasting for me. It was definitely still delicious though!\n\nCurrently, they have a Thanksgiving-themed menu with flavors such as mashed potatoes, turkey, and cranberries. Very interesting, but I went with the other 2 flavors I mentioned.\n\nThere is not a lot of seating space inside; there were 4 spots at a counter, and just 2 other open seats.

Although the line was wrapped around the corner of the street, I was promised the wait was worthwhile. \n\nService was fantastic! All of the workers were extremely friendly and helpful when it came to picking flavors. Don't let the long lines intimidate you. It goes by fairly quickly and the workers speed up the process by offering samples while you're still in line- talk about efficiency! \n\nFlavor-wise, Salt & Straw offers way more than your typical icecream shop. They offer seasonal flavors that are truly unique and almost shocking how they could possibly invent flavors like these.. but nonetheless, I highly recommend trying out the seasonal flavors (just sample it!) if not committing to one in your actual scoop of icecream. \n\n+ Mashed Potatoes & Gravy: 5/5 The description didn't sound very appealing but the flavor was very enjoyable. The mashed potatoes had a subtle aftertaste that just made it feel like Thanksgiving in that very moment. \n+ Roasted strawberry tres leche: 3.5/5 The strawberry flavor was very rich and prominent. The leche portion tasted like cake batter which I really liked-the texture was grainy and less sweet compared to the rest of the icecream. I ordered a split scoop of this flavor and it was just overwhelmingly sweet for my taste. I couldn't stomach to even finish the whole split scoop. \n\nThe prices seem a bit steep but Salt & Straw makes their products in small batches using fresh, local ingredients. In addition, the workers are pretty generous with their scoops. One scoop will run you  $5.00 without a waffle cone. I recommend doing a split scoop to try more flavors and the $.50 is worth it! Parking can be a pain but if you go to the park, there should be plenty of parking and its about 3-4 blocks away. All in all, I had a great experience here and I'll be back for more if I'm ever in SF.", "author": "Sandra N."}

They also try to use local ingredients/local stores too. I first tried their ice cream in Portland and was hooked. Each location has a few different flavors (such SF flavors include salted honey marshmallow & walnuts, and roasted strawberry tres leches), but most can be found at all locations (mmm, the delicate honey lavender and very chocoaltely chocolate gooey brownie). \n\nOne of my favorites from Portland is the Coava Coffee & Cocan\u00fa Craque. Translated over to SF it's  offered as Sightglass Coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate. It's pretty good (coffee ice cream with a crunch), but I find the Portland flavor to be way better (unless I tried it on an off-day). \n\nThey have a seasonal menu that changes monthly as well, which is so fun. Back in July I found all the flavors to be on top of their game, it was a very berry-centric menu. \n\nAnyway, don't worry about the lines, because they take time with each customer to sample flavors (and are really friendly) and it's totally worth it!", "author": "Jessica H."}

Let me tell you why.\n\nFirst of all, I smelled the aroma of the waffle cones literally a block away. My nose was magnetizing towards it as I kept getting closer and closer. We walked in on a Monday around 3PM and there was no line.\n\nI know many people have raved over Salt and Straw. They are so happy it finally made their way to here. However, I couldn't find anything special about it. Perhaps I got the wrong flavor? Did I go on a bad ice cream batch day? I am not sure what went wrong here but I thought their ice cream was just OK. I got the Sea Salt Ribbon ice cream and it was way too sweet for my liking. The ice cream was a bit too churned for me. Maybe it is because I like my ice cream really hard? It was nothing to rave about or dying to come back for.\n\nI will say their ice cream flavors are not your ordinary ice cream shop. You will see some interesting ones like Honey Lavender or something with Goat cheese(?) which you do not see very often. Be prepared to expect not the ordinary ice cream flavors.\n$5 for a scoop sounds quite $$, but they do pack a big scoop in if that helps.\n\nAlso, be prepared for the horrendous parking. Meters will require some feeding and parking is a bit tight. We were lucky enough to get parking right when we arrived.

Plus, the waffle cone was still warm...fresh off the waffle iron. \n\nThe flavors offered at Salt & Straw are incredibly unique. I was being safe on my first go-around, but don't expect plain jane vanilla or chocolate here. Truly a gourmet style ice cream (*is that a thing?!) \n\nI have a couple of tips for ya:\n\nTips: \n\n1. Go during \"down times\" for ice cream. Morning, or late afternoon is best. Also, the dreaded line that so many have described is worst on the weekends, so beware! \n\n2.

I don't recall the ice cream really standing out to me-- just your standard upscale ice cream shop creamy.\n\nThe thing is, the shop's not even really that far from me, so maybe I should go back and check it out sometime...\n\nLine was decently long but moved quickly enough!\n\n--\n\nEdit: Made it back here for Round 2! I tried way too many flavors because the lady at the front was oh so nice about it...and definitely encouraged my indecisiveness. \n\nStarting with their summer seasonal flavors: carrot cake batter with hazelnut praline-- not my personal favorite because the cream cheese ribbon made it a bit sour (not carrot cake-y) and I always find that nuts get in the way of my ice cream / chocolate zucchini bread-- this one was strong on the spices and had bits of bread in it, was a-ok in my opinion / green fennel and maple-- I ended up getting this. I liked how the fennel almost came in as an after-taste, but didn't think the maple was that strong / eggplant honey custard-- got this one as well, the ice cream itself only had light hints of eggplant, but when combined with the eggplant bits, it really worked well. who woulda thunk? \n\nOnto their regular flavors: roasted strawberry tres leches: my roommates really enjoyed this one, but it seemed mostly like strawberry ice cream to me, though with cake chunks / sightglass coffee-- this was very deep in coffee flavor, almost borderline black coffee in taste, which was a bit much for me / salted honey marshmallow and walnut-- this didn't really stand out to me too much, but then again not a fan of nuts in ice cream / olive oil and lemon custard-- smooth, but again not my thing / teranga baobab-- a bit sour, and while i generally love coconut based ice creams, this one didn't do it for me. \n\nWith a line out the door at 10pm on Sunday, they must be doing something right!

We got the Salted, Malted cookie dough and a special seasonal concoction flavor. The line was out the door super long, but that just means the place is great and popular! \n\nThe ice cream itself was not bad. Super sweet, and definitely wouldn't recommend eating a big dinner beforehand. The scoops are generous, and the ice cream is well made. They even have pints to go if you don't want to wait in line (genius idea). They are big on local ingredients, and community involvement too which I appreciate. \n\nThe service however, is all downhill from there, hence the 2 star review. I asked the young lady with a USF shirt on to recommend some flavors since this was my first time, and she said \"I really don't have any.\" I obviously have read the menu, and had a few in mind, but I always ask just to get a pulse. For someone that works at an ice cream place, I would hope that they would have SOME opinion about their ice cream! She seemed disinterested in us, a little aloof, and quite candidly rude. It has definitely left a bad taste in my mouth after all that sweet ice cream. We also asked for regular cones, and she charged us extra for 2 waffle cones that we didn't ask for. A pretty sneaky way to make a few extra bucks in my opinion. \n\nI may try again but maybe visit a different store. I live in San Jose, so this was my first time trying the ice cream, and I was a little disappointed by the sub-par uninterested employee. Maybe she was having a bad day (always giving the benefit of the doubt here), but I wouldn't rule out a second visit to Salt and Straw to edit this review and see if they're able to improve.", "author": "Alison D."}

Good job supporting local affiliate businesses!\n\nAfter getting to the counter the first time I came here, I tried about 6 flavors. I didn't feel pressured by any staff to make up my mind which was nice considering the crowd, but just looking behind at the queue I felt like the pressure was coming from the waiting crowds even if it wasn't from the staff. It's very reminiscent of BiRite ice creamery lines so nothing new here, just pointing it out. \n\nI initially liked the 'thick creaminess' of the ice cream but after a quite a few times back trying other flavors my palette started to dislike it. I don't know what it is but it feels like it could be whatever they are using to thicken or give that gluggy sensation to the icecream. On occasion it even feels 'powdery' if that even makes sense. \n\nThe flavors are changed up every few months, introducing new delectable treats to your taste buds. Some interesting flavors for sure.

They are also very good about helping you choose the right flavor for you by letting you try as many samples as you want. Salt & Straw also have reoccurring monthly special edition flavors which of course I always overdo. \n\nThe last time was no exception and since it's October, they had creepy/ scary flavor sounding names out. One in particular was Dracula's Blood Pudding. I didn't think anything of it and quickly stuffed it in my mouth as soon as she gave me my spoon. It tasted so heavenly and delicious. I don't really go for chocolate type ice creams but after that first taste, I was like \"Yup this is the one. I want this on a waffle cone.\" It was after the fact that I discovered there was 8% PIG'S BLOOD in it! \n\nListen, man. I'm all for trying out new things and all but I'm ....totally vegetarian. So I just did NOT feel right afterwards. She was very apologetic afterwards and I hold no grudge or anything (although I did drop a star). It would just be nice if Salt & Straw made a sign or anything to indicate non-vegetarian. It could've saved other vegetarian/ vegans from being deeply disturbed from an ice cream shop.

Just steps away from the store, there was a delicious smell coming outside of Salt & Straw. All their ice cream is home made :)\n\nThere was just a little short line, and while waiting in line, someone came to help us and provide samples for us. She was very helpful in providing recommendations, and even suggested some ice creams to pair together. She recommended pairing the olive oil & lemon custard with the honey lavender. It was a delicious combination..thank you for that rec! The store has a good number of classic options, and then they have special options that are changed monthly. All the flavors tasted delicious, and you honestly can't go wrong with any flavor. We ended up sharing the honey lavender..it was delicious and I loved the hint of lavender in it :) \n\nThere is limited seating inside, but with Fillmore being such a fun place to walk, it was nice to grab our ice cream and walk along the street.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-04", "description": "Salt & Straw is one of those places that seem really overhyped for what it is. How creative can people get with ice cream? The answer to that? PRETTY DAMN CREATIVE. Salt & Straw is not only delicious, their creative twists and flavors make it completely different from your average basic vanilla. Though they may seem over the top, it's completely worth going here to experiment different varieties in ice cream, especially for the adventurous foodie at heart.\n\nI came here at around 10pm at night with a friend, and the line wrapped out and around the door, which intimidated me especially since they closed at 11, but the line moved relatively quickly. I got to the front of the line within 15-20 minutes or so, which was impressive considering how many people were in front of me.\n\nThe person who helped me was really sweet, and let me sample as many flavors as I liked. Though there were so many customers in line, the workers there were patient and really kind. In the end, after trying a variety of flavors- I decided on Peach Vinegar Cobbler with Nutmeg.\n\nThe Peach Vinegar Cobbler with Nutmeg really intrigued me at first- as I really love peach cobbler in general but was intimidated by the prospect of vinegar and nutmeg, but it was surprisingly really good. The sweet peach taste was very refreshing without being too overwhelmingly sweet, and the nutmeg added a subtle addition of nuttiness to it. I was surprised how much I really loved it.\n\nI also sampled the Sea Salt Caramel swirled with ribbons of Caramel and it might have honestly been one of the best Sea Salt Caramel ice creams I've ever had. I for SURE will come back for another scoop of this gloriousness, but I really wanted to try something different that I haven't had before. Really lightly salted, it wasn't overwhelmed with sea salt like I've noticed other places with their sea salt caramel, and the ribbons of caramel really tied the whole ice cream together completely.\n\nI also sampled their seasonal July Birthday Cake and Blackberry ice cream, but for me personally it was a tad too sweet. It kinda reminds me of a birthday cake mixed with black berries with a chunks of graham cracker crust. Personally for me there was too much going on at one time, plus it was just overly too sweet, so I moved along my selection.\n\nMy friend also ordered the Olive Oil and Lemon Custard ice cream because he was really intrigued by what that could possibly have to offer. Don't be alarmed by the Olive Oil in the name, it actually is extremely smooth and you could taste the sweetness of the custard harmonizing with the tartness of the Lemon curd. A surprisingly sweet choice of ice cream.\n\nOverall, Salt & Straw really blew it out of the park for me. For the adventurous eater at heart and for someone who wants to satisfy your sweet tooth, Salt & Straw definitely does not disappoint and is well worth a 5 star rating for me for their creativity in flavors to their customer service throughout the whole process.

There are a ton of classic SF ice cream options, as well as some seasonal ones that they'll change every once in a while.\n\nTheir roasted strawberry tres leches was sooo good!

I had a ROASTED STRAWBERRY TRES LECHES and OLIVE OIL & LEMON CUSTARD double scoop in a cup. The Olive Oil ice cream did me in. I was enamored by it when sampling but soon realized as I was eating my scoop that it was probably only good in small doses at least for me. \n\nThe amount of cake in the Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches scoop was a bit overwhelming. I would have liked to taste more of the strawberry vanilla jam instead. All of the options here that I've tried even the ostensibly simpler flavors were very rich, thick, and decadent. I think you have to be in the right kind of mood for this kind of ice cream. They handled my feeling quite ill after eating ice cream issue very well which I wasn't expecting and which is why I returned.    \n\nMy second visit was on a bright and sunny Saturday afternoon (quite hot by SF standards) and it ended a lot more pleasantly. I did not get sick this time and felt great after devouring the massive double scoop waffle cone I ended up getting. I surprised myself by the speed at which I consumed that thing. They do have a lot of good flavor combinations which made it hard to pick the scoops.  \n\nThe server who helped me was really nice about me wanting to try all the limited edition Farmer's Market Series flavors plus the Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons. You can apparently try however many flavors you want. They give you big spoonfuls for sampling which makes it easier to discern the different ingredients. I noticed how loud it was in the store. I really had to speak up and strain to listen to the server. \n\nCarrot Cake Batter & Hazelnut Praline - The carrot cake flavor was very strong and delicious. I like the addition of the hazelnuts. This one was very good. \nFreckled Chocolate Zucchini Bread - I love zucchini bread but I thought this wasn't as good as the carrot cake. It is lighter in flavor if you don't want something too strong.  \nChocolate Date Shake - This was another one I really enjoyed. I mistook the dark chocolate flakes as nuts. My plan to concentrate very hard on the flavor profiles backfired. I liked the texture a lot which can be attributed to the chocolate sheet and could taste a hint of dates.    \nGreen Fennel & Maple - This tasted mostly of maple syrup. I found it hard to distinguish the fennel. For this one, I would need more than a spoonful to catch all the flavors.\nEggplant Honey Custard - I ended up getting this. More below!  \n\nSEA SALT WITH CARAMEL RIBBONS\nThis is Salt & Straw's signature flavor and I immediately understood why. It was SO good. I really enjoyed biting into the thick ice cream and getting mouthfuls of the caramel and salt and cream. The flavor added by the salt was just perfect. I love it when you can really taste the salt in sea salt caramel ice creams. And the hand-burned ribbons of caramel were simply glorious.  \n\nEGGPLANT HONEY CUSTARD\nI have a deep infatuation with eggplant, but I have never had it in dessert form which made me really anticipate this flavor. The ice cream was filled with beautiful chunks of caramelized eggplant. I really liked that you can actually see the eggplant and it wasn't just blended in and hidden from sight! I did think that the honey which was delicious in its own right kind of buried the flavor of the eggplant. \n\nThe thing with these unorthodox flavors is there seems to always be an opposing, more traditional flavor that overpowers the unusual ingredient. I actually would have liked to taste a lot more of the eggplant just because it's so intriguing to have it in ice cream. That would have also perpetuated the feeling that there was at least something healthy about this massive double scoop I was eating.\n\nThe lesson here for me was don't let traumatic first experiences deter you from trying and loving all kinds of ice creams.

S&S is no different. And it seems that SF is the hub for ice cream. Don't get me wrong: traveling is fun but it's nice to know that if you're ever craving for something, it's in your own backyard. I visited this SF location twice and although I've never been to the Portland location, I'm sure it's just as good if not better. With that said, I can't really compare, but I can say that the ice cream at this location is fresh and creamy. I love how some of the flavors mesh so well together even though reading them off the menu, you wouldn't think those flavor profiles would work. But that's why their the experts and you just let them do what they do best. \n\n-Ice cream- Aside from the usual flavors, the following were the limited edition flavors for July 2017 (the theme was berries!): goat cheese marionberry habanero, meyer lemon buttermilk and blueberry, birthday cake and blackberries, fresh cheese and strawberries and wild foraged berry sherbet. My cousin ordered the meyer lemon buttermilk and blueberry on a waffle cone. I tried it and it was absolutely amazing! My boyfriend chose the fresh cheese and strawberries on a sugar cone. It was really tasty! I mean you really can't go wrong with any of their flavors unless you're allergic or just dislike a certain ingredient. However, if it's the latter, I would at least give it a try because you never know. I ended up going with the honey lavender on a sugar cone. I love the taste of flowery ingredients whether it's rose, lavender, chrysanthemum, you name it. \n\n-Service- I think other than the ice cream itself being amazing (haven't tasted one I didn't like), the service is great! One person stays with you the entire time and you can taste test practically the whole menu if you wanted. The only qualm I have about that is it can make the wait time longer. I went here at nighttime on a weekday on both visits so I never waited any more than 30min, but I can see where it can be extended when multiple people ahead of you want to try lots of flavors. I would still encourage trying different flavors though, but maybe they can restrict sampling to 2-3 flavors. \n\n-Overall impression- 4.5 stars! I only knocked half a star for the wait time.

Get ice cream at Salt & Straw of course!\n\nA year ago when I was traveling around Oregon, I had the chance to stop by Salt & Straw - the one and only, the absolute favorite amongst PDX Portlandians. Boy, I was a HUGE fan of the quality of their ice cream as well as their boldness with choice of products. I mean, where else do you go to get good tasting FISH SAUCE ice cream. I was instantly sold and told myself that I'd become one of those fans that would wait forever for this ice cream if Salt & Straw opened up in the Bay Area.\n\nFast forward to a few months ago and Salt & Straw had FINALLY opened up in San Francisco's Pacific Heights. I actually had the opportunity to visit their pop-up shop at Off the Grid in Fort Mason before their storefront (YES, GO SFOTG!!) and had the same exact experience as I had back in Portland. I remember trying their...\n\n...Strawberry sorbet (10/10). Absolutely creamy and sweet! This strawberry was amazing, but I wished I could taste the coriander more. It's a safe bet if you like strawberry.\n\n...Apple Mayo (10/10). Can I rate this 11/10? Don't be turned off by the mayo because it makes this ice cream SO CREAMY and the apple flavor is SO delicious! This was my personal favorite.\n\nAnd because of how great of an experience I had with them at Off the Grid, I decided to take my girlfriend to their store location on the best of days: National Ice Cream Day.\n\nSalt & Straw is located on Fillmore Street in Pac Heights. I actually absolutely LOVE this location because Pacific Heights is a very peaceful area. There's usually no traffic at night, meaning no parking or no lines for food. We came here after eating at Tataki (worth a try!) and it was only about a 5 minute walk away. Of course, since it was National Ice Cream day, the line was hella long but we were able to get near the front after about 15 minutes (you can use this as your baseline?). Even though there were a lot of people, we were appreciative of how efficient the employees were; despite not being right at the counter yet, they made an effort to feed us samples and make sure we were served (soft served???). \n\nOn July 16, 2017 (National Ice Cream Day), Salt & Straw didn't have that outrageous of a selection of flavors (booohoo), but there were some that stood out such as the Goat Cheese Habanero and the Olive Oil and Lemon Custard. Note: If you have never been to Salt & Straw before, they have 50% \"normal flavors\" that are here daily and 50% more experimental flavors - 100% wild most of the time. We ended up getting the Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches with Vanilla I believe?\n\nFirst, I have to say that there's a reason people keep coming back to Salt & Straw and it may not be just the ice cream. We ordered ours with a cup, but the employee who took our order gave us a cone. We told her it was totally fine, but she was super insistent on giving us another order free of charge. We insisted it was okay, and so she ended up NOT CHARGING US AT ALL - even after I tried to force my way to the cashier. That, my friends, is excellent service; and apparently they do this often.\n\nNow back to the ice cream - I thought the roasted strawberry was AMAZING! I loved how creamy it was. The strawberries were super fresh, and the touch of salt was perfect. It definitely tastes like the description: just like cake batter. I would definitely come again for this.\n\nOverall, would I say Salt & Straw is the best ice cream EVER? Coming out of Salt & Straw for the third time, I still have the same feeling as the first: Nobody does bold flavors like Salt & Straw and their service, I feel, is rivaled only by a few. I would say that this ever-growing chain is maybe my top 2-3 favorite ice cream places in the world. I personally like Bi-Rite better, but don't let me stop you from trying this AMAZING place. I give Salt & Straw an \"omg, I'd travel 2 hours for this.\"\n\nEat well and prosper!", "author": "Bryan W."}

Long behold there's finally one in SF... And it's now my favorite ice cream spot in SF! \n\nAlways wanted to have ice cream for breakfast?  Well now it's possible with their seasonal flavor, \"pots of gold and rainbows\" (lucky charms cereal infused into vanilla ice cream), and it was BOMBBB! The lucky charms' marhmallow-y flavor had an even presence in the vanilla ice cream and didn't add an overbearing texture. This has definitely been added as one of my new favorite flavors of ice cream. \n\nI also had a half scoop of the \"chocolate caramel potato chip cupcake\" ice cream. This flavor sounds a lot less weird than the it sounds. The potato chips aren't simply pieces of chips crushed into ice cream, as some might imagine. Instead, it's pretty sweet (from the chocolate and caramel it's dipped in) with a hint of saltiness. It adds a nice crunchy texture too.  \n\nTo top things off, I had some really great service from the Asian girl with a Porter hat. She graciously provided me with several samples until I was able to decide what I wanted.", "author": "Selena M."}

We came on a Wednesday night, and the lines were fairly long, but it moved fast so that our wait was only about 20 min. \n\nThey always have interesting flavors, and during our recent visit, the seasonal flavors were mostly berry related. I decided on the tres leche cake roasted strawberry flavor and it was very good! I enjoyed the bits of cake in the ice cream and the strong, fresh strawberry flavor. \n\nTo my surprise, some of the ice creams we had sampled were not as great as the ice cream at the other Salt and Straw locations. Some of the samples I tried had pieces of ice in them, making the ice cream seem not fresh. However, the staff was super nice and was patient with us when we wanted to try so many flavors.

It was one of the seasonal flavors (they vary by month). Ice cream is creamy and soft. Wouldn't recommend the matcha blackberry or the flavors with full berries within them because the berries are still thawing from being frozen (frozen berries are not my personal preference).

My friend raves about this place and apparently has tried nearly every flavor. The line would indicate that it's a popular spot and worth the wait. I think I might have to disagree...\n\nThe environment: the shop is cute with a friendly and inviting atmosphere. \n\nThe service: servers work efficiently and even ask those waiting if they'd like any samples so that they can be prepared to select a flavor by the time it's their turn. This system works!\n\nThe menu: substantial number of flavors plus a rotating menu of special seasonal flavors, all of which are unique. Prices are a smidgen higher than usual, but that's Pac Heights for ya. You can also skip the line by grabbing a pint from the freezer.\n\nThe flavors: I sampled bone marrow & smoked cherries (surprisingly bland for such an ingredient), peach crumble bars (very peachy), roasted strawberry tres leches (not lechy enough), almond brittle with salted ganache (delish), honey lavender (tastes like it would anywhere else), and salted honey marshmallow & walnuts (the final choice and a yummy one at that). In hindsight, I should have opted for the almond brittle, but when you're sampling so many flavors at once, the palette can get confused! Biggest loss in points was due to the portion. It was the dinkiest kid's scoop I had ever purchased and disproportionate to the price of $4.\n\nThe lowdown: cute place and great service, but the ice cream itself didn't knock my Rainbows (sandals) off. It wasn't bad in any way, it just seemed more hyped up than it delivered. It could also use an improvement in the size of the scoops. I noticed that some of the other customers had scoops that didn't quite fill out their waffle cones...I can't justify that cost for such measly portions.", "author": "Jenny W."}

There is both a standard selection and a monthly rotation selection. Single scoops are $5, double scoops are $7, and addition of a waffle cone is $1.25. You can also get a tasting flight (with 4 flavors I believe?) for $11.50, and pints are $11 (you can skip the line if you purchase a pint!)\n\nWe got a double scoop with almond brittle with salted ganache and honey lavender. Although the final price with tax was a bit on the steep side for ice cream ($9), they gave a ton of ice cream and the fresh, crunchy just-made warm waffle shell made it well worth it. The honey lavender had nice floral notes and tasted almost reminiscent of chai tea. The almond brittle with chocolate ganache, on the other hand, is probably the best ice cream I have ever tasted.

Anything \"limited edition\" makes me all the more inclined to try those flavors but I gotta say, the honey lavender and their roasted strawberry flavors won me over. I chose to \"split\" my scoop, so I can choose 2 flavors without the extra cost of another scoop ($7 for a double scoop, and only $.50 for splitting -- you know that Asian in me gotta go for the better deal!) and put it all in a waffle cone ($1.25). \n\nThey also ask which flavor you prefer to put on top, which I think brings that extra touch to the quality of service :3 \n\nAfter getting through about 75% of the cone though (polishing off the honey lavender) the roasted strawberry ice cream (which I had chosen to go on the bottom) got too overwhelming and a bit too sweet.

I tried about 7 flavors before deciding \n\nCon: the consistency is a bit more on the stickier side. \n\nTip: the line can be 45 minutes long.

Strawberry tres leche is solid as well. The honey lavender was fragrant, subtle, and elegant in flavor. The matcha ice cream was subtle in flavor with the sour tart accents from the black raspberry.

After leaving Seattle, sadly, Portland food trips were no longer accessible for weekend getaways and I thought of Salt & Straw like a long lost love. \n\nFast forward to the anticipation of opening day.

I see Ice Cream.  \n\nI pulled up my Yelp app and see the reviews and it was a done deal.  I convinced my friends to wait in line with me just so I could get my sweet tooth fix.  While waiting in line, I found that this place was from Portland and that they added interesting ingredients like mayo and vinegar to their flavors.  What?!   \n\nI'm not one to be shy to ask for samples and the gal behind the counter made sure that we didn't feel guilty asking.   First thing I noticed was *real* silver spoons to sample the ice cream.  This was a first for me.  Usually Ice Cream joints use plastic spoons to throw away in the trash.  What a way to reduce waste and be classy!!  \n\nIt was after I tasted the SF Seasonal Flavors that I had made my decision..\n\nWildflower Honey with Ricotta Walnut Lace Cookies:  Super creamy, light taste of honey and the ricotta cheese made it super interesting.. The cookie bits were just enough to give it texture. Not super sweet which I appreciated.\n\nRhubarb Crumble with Toast Anise:  First off, I have no idea what Anise is.

But I have never visited or eaten at the Salt and Straw ice cream parlor. I know, I am a lousy and useless yelper; so don't rub it in. \n\nThe newest Salt and Straw and first in the Bay area has only opened a month ago (April 14, 2017).   And what an impressive debut it was, with a line with ice cream-lovers stretching well beyond the block. \n\nAfter a 15 minute wait in line, I was looking at the available flavors on the menu. I decided to order a scoop of double-folded vanilla and a scoop of gooey chocolate brownie in a store-made waffle cone. A double-folded vanilla is basically the seed and the oil in the strand of bean and adds extra flavor in the vanilla ice cream. It is definitely a difference-maker. And the gooey chocolate brownie has chunks of brownies and drizzle of the chocolate sauce. The two scoops in a waffle-cone made my $8.50 treat a decadent one. \nFor $11.00, I also took home of a pint of rhubarb crumble with anise for a later treat. This is a seasonal flavor and I love rhubarb too. \n\nI came here on a Monday afternoon, which the wait was not too bad. Assumingly the line and wait at other times can be much lengthier. \n\nSan Francisco has done a great job of bringing some of the other cities' institution to the Bay.

Chocolate chunks gave it a good consistency \nMOCK APPLE - Canned apples. Again, too salty \nSTRAWBERRY - This was delicious!  Tasted like a strawberry cheesecake \n\nCame here at 7 on a Saturday night and the line wrapped around the building. The line moved decently quickly and we were in the front in about 20 minutes. The list of flavors were also taped to the side of the building so you can figure out what flavor you'd like to get as you're waiting in line. \n\nThey're not stingy on the samples or on the scoops!   My bf and I sampled about 4 ice creams all together before finally deciding to share a single scoop. Their scoops were MASSIVE. It's basically two regular sized scoops and it was more than enough for the two of us to share. If you get a double, you're basically getting 4 small scoops. \n\nI thought a lot of their ice cream were too salty I know. Salt & Straw. I should expect it to be salty lol.

Over there, lines out the door up until closing time of 11pm, in cold weather. It's THAT good\n\nFor those who've never been to S&S, they are very focused on the experience. They take your entire party and have a dedicated associate work with you to provide samples. You sample however many flavors you want, you can even sample the entire menu if you really wanted to. What this means is that the line builds up and moves slowly, just be prepared for this. Some people like this and think it's worth the trade off, some don't\n\nSo I asked to sample 2 flavors and the associate handed me the samples. I finished one, and before I put the second sample into my mouth, the he asked me, \"is there anything else you'd like to try?\" Well hmm.. maybe.. if you give me some time to finish this first sample and start the second sample. I felt like I was being rushed. What I would have liked to see is him giving me more time to sample, enjoy, and think about the flavor profile so I can decide if I like it or not. \n\nAt the end, I got the sea salt caramel. When I got an entire scoop, I was able to see that the caramel to ice cream ratio was way off. absolutely way too high. The caramel should be enhancing the flavor of the ice cream, but it was the other way around. It looked pretty bad too, like i was eating a brown/white sludge. Not appetizing at all\n\nThis is a new location so I'm sure they're still figuring things out.

There aren't many seats inside, so be prepared to stand / walk outside while eating your ice cream.  Also be prepared for 1) long lines and 2) long periods of wait time.  The reason is because (as explained below) there are so many interesting flavors to try and most people ended up tasting multiple.  My friend and I got there around 8:15 probably waited for 25 min?\n\nIce cream pickings:  like I said, there are sooooo many flavors to taste / choose from, which can be overwhelming for the indecisive mind.  You have a few classics like vanilla, sea salt caramel, and chocolate, but there are some pretty wacky flavors (ie honey lavender, olive oil and lemon, flower sherbert, etc.).  My friend and I probably ended up tasting 10 flavors total before making up our minds.  \n\nTaste: my friend went with the olive oil and lemon ice cream, which I surprisingly found super refreshing.  The ice cream itself wasn't too sweet (olive-oil flavored), but the strips of lemon custard were all that was needed to bring both sweetness and acidity to the ice cream.\n\nAs with other ice cream shops, I judge based on their simple flavors.  As much as I loved the honey lavender (where you could actually taste the lavender) and the salted honey marshmellow + walnuts (great texture and the salt is a great cleanser to the overall sweetness), I ordered their plain Double Fold Vanilla in a waffle cone (~$5.50). Waffle cone was crispy but not burnt and still had a bit of chewiness you associate with a waffle.  The ice cream is to die for.  The vanilla was a bit more creamy than other places I've been too, but the vanilla flavor comes through very well and wasn't too sweet, how I like it.  Thank god I ordered a kid-sized scooped- I might have passed out with a bigger scoop.\n\nTips:\n- Be prepared to wait for a while in line\n- Don't judge people for taking forever deciding what they want to order... you're gonna have a tough time deciding what you want yourself\n- TASTE!!  You never know if you'll like something, even if it sounds kinda weird / gross\n- If you have a small stomach or are coming for dessert after a meal, consider a kid-sized portion- the ice cream here tends to run a little rich so a smaller size might do your stomach good and prevent you from entering a food coma", "author": "Audrey H."}

It's called, \"Salt & Straw.\" Opened since mid-April 2017, Salt & Straw serves the customers from young to old to taste their interesting and irresistible handmade ice creams at any time despite the massive popularity fan base while waiting in a single line every day and night! The atmosphere is very laid back and active as I welcomed there. The concept is much modern and contemporary filled with well known vintage designs and cleaner interior space!\n\nThe employees here are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me a sensational service due to their busiest environment. No cons at all!\n\nNow onto the treat! Despite that I got waited in line for nearly an hour, I decided to order a pint of ice cream (costs $11) instead, so I ordered a pint sized ice cream flavor of \"Double Fold Vanilla.\" As I ate it, that ice cream tasted sensational! It's much flavorful for the vanilla and the creamy texture is much smoother and easier to release. Not bad at all!\n\nParking at Salt & Straw can be quite challenging to park. You can park at the nearby surface street parking if it's available. If the lines are getting much longer with the longest waiting time, you can park at the nearby parking garage too. Alternatively, you can also ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.\n\nTo conclude, Salt & Straw is the most amazing and spectacular national ice cream shop that I've ever experienced the most! I'll be back next time in the near future to try their other flavors around before the business hours open! A must visit! My rating: 4 solid stars.", "author": "William L."}

I am trying to make a tour of all the best ice cream shops in the city. Super friendly and helpful staff. They tell every  customer that they can try as many flavors as they want. This is the first ice cream place that I've been to where they actually make it a point to come out and say that. \n\nI tried a ton of flavors. Many of them were quite good. I had a hard time choosing. I tried so many flavors that I only had room for a single scoop. I ended up with the Birthday cake Boysenberry. It is one of their special July flavors. I got it with what was perhaps the best waffle cone that I've ever had! \n\nSo, come here, try a ton of flavors, pick your favorite one or two, and get the waffle cone!", "author": "Sean A."}

It was probably the game-changing ice cream of the day - Bi-Rite was around in SF, but was already getting overplayed. At the time, it was super refreshing to try something new with such exotic and bold flavors! I was sad when I flew back to SF knowing there wasn't a Salt & Straw in SF. Then, that fall I moved to LA. Turns out, so did Salt & Straw! My ice cream dream came true! It was a great 2 years in LA and then once again the tables turned. I moved back to SF, and now Salt & Straw has followed me once again!!!\n\nThis ice cream shop has ~10 classic flavors, and ~10 monthly specialty flavors that switch out every month. What I mean by classic is that they stay at the ice cream shop forever, and never switch out. They're basically the same flavors that they have in Portland, LA, and SF. However, they make slightly changes, for instance for the coffee flavor, they use Sightlcass (local SF coffee shop) instead of Stumptown (Portland coffee shop). What makes their ice cream shop stand out compared to others is their monthly specialty flavors, which are forever changing. This is a great and bad thing. You may find the best flavor of your life in the monthly special section, but it may disappear forever after the 30th!\n\nMy favorite classic flavor is the caramel & sea salt ribbons. Can't go wrong with that one! The other amazing one is the roasted strawberry tres leches. Yums! I'd have to say that they have pretty bold flavors too, and I can see why some people would get turned off by them. For instance, not at this particular ice cream place, but in LA for November, they had Thanksgiving themed ice cream flavors, which were savory. It was a little bizarre, but IMO a fun experience.\n\nService is so very friendly! I did come here on a weekday at 11am when they opened, and we waited maybe 20 minutes in line, which was super frustrating (only 2 workers there). However, we came a weekday night around 9pm, and the line was around the corner, and took about the same amount of time since they had more workers. They let you try as many flavors as you want, which is super nice. They don't make you feel bad if you try more than 2. \n\nScoops are on the expensive side, like 4.50/5 per scoop, which is always why it's better to opt for the double scoop for $7! If you buy a pint, they let you skip the line. That's a super nice benefit. The pints are $11 though...on the expensive side, but hey, this is delicious gourmet ice cream!!", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

My favorite flavor is the Sea Salt + Caramel Ribbons. At this point, it's probably better to go on off peak hours because every time I've walked past this place around 7-8pm the line is around the corner. I can tell you I'm not that dedicated to ice cream and I will walk down two more blocks to Smitten. \n\nI still like Smitten just as much but the flavors are more interesting at Salt & Straw versus Smitten.

We went on a Saturday night around 9pm and the line was out the door around the corner to the end of bus stop. They had a lot of people working that night so it took about 45 minutes. Still long but not as bad as it had been apparently. The shop is really cute with cute knick knacks and snacks for sales. Also pro tip: They have pints of all their current flavors for $11 and you can skip the line and just pick them up buy them so if you don't have time, I recommend doing that. If you have the time, definitely wait in line because they let you try as many flavors as you want! My bf and I tried the Strawberry Tres Leches, Chocolate Brownie, and Salted Caramel. I ended up going with Strawberry and my bf did the chocolate brownie, both were delicious!\n\nI would definitely come back but probably opt to skip the line and get a pint until the hype dies down a bit.", "author": "Alex S."}

I've been a fan ever since my first visit to Portland years ago and never thought they would open up shop here since we are definitely not lacking in ice cream options. Their honey lavender was life-changing, so of course I've had Salt & Straw bookmarked and knew I had to come as soon as I could. \n\nAfter having dinner at Umami Burger and doing some shopping on Union Street on a warm Saturday evening, we walked up Fillmore and could smell the fresh cones from a couple blocks away. There was a bit of a line wrapped around the corner but it wasn't too bad. What struck me was how diverse the crowd was - young, old, couples, and families. \n\nThe 45-minute wait flew by quickly and before we knew it, we were greeted by an employee who offered us as many samples as we wanted to try. Many people were quite literally trying everything, which is most likely the cause for the long wait. We opted for the split single scoop in cups since we were still a bit full from dinner. We were really happy with our choices and can't wait to come back in a few weeks to see what new flavors will be on their monthly menu.\n\nIf you're in a rush, you can always skip the line and pick up one of their pints to enjoy at home!\n\nMy current rank:\n1.

I know, that's a blasphemous statement considering how much I love Bi-Rite, but after trying their creamy and locally-infused flavor creations in both LA and Portland, I was excited to see what they had to offer in the new SF location. I knew the wait would be long, especially shortly after the grand opening - we ended a little over an hour on a Sunday. \n\nPrices are notably more expensive than your typical ice cream shop. Single scoops will run $5, double scoops will run $7, split flavors will add on an extra $0.50 and those fresh waffle cones that you smell will tack on $1.25. But the premium ice cream appeals because of the locally-sourced ingredients and limited-time flavors of the month. Classic flavors at this location include Sightglass coffee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate. I ended up getting the salted honey marshmallow & walnuts and was not disappointed. You can also sample the flavors between committing, but I recommend going with a group as to not slow the process down (they give you a big spoonful, enough for 2-3 people to try). If you also feel like skipping the line and taking a pint home, there's a separate line on the left to grab and go.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

Another trendy expensive ice cream store that has to come up with crazy flavors and a marketing plan to overcharge for ice cream to pay for the expensive city rents and rising min wage.  1st there was Coldstone, then Smitten, and now this.  What happened to all the yogurt stores like Red Mango.  San Francisco is going to trend itself to death.  I miss the old Baskin Robbins which was actually across the street from this store decades ago.  Yes the lines are long, but this is just another trendy thing.  San Francisco has always been a leader in ice cream with Swensen's , Mitchells, Double Rainbow and even  It's-It.\n\nCame here with nephew and niece because they hated the flavors at Smitten around the corner.  They did not like these either, but we got some and they didnt like it.  As is the case with these small batch players, there is a lack of consistency and the creative flavors are just interesting to make me curious but honestly it is like a fancy restaurant that does the complex things innovatively (Lavender) and is just okay on the basic stuff (Double Fold Vanilla).  I get how this place caters to the 20-somethings who want the next cool thing, but the kids all look at this basic dessert and cringe.  Who wants flowers in their ice cream?\n\nIf you think I know nothing, I grew up scooping Double Rainbow ice cream, my mother opened the authentic Gelato store from Italy back in the 90s in the Cannery and had high candy stores for over 2 decades that started one of SF's first great chocolatiers.\n\nI'd rather head to Daly City and go to Baskin Robbins or Ben & Jerrys for cheaper ice cream that does the good stuff right and innovates for the long-term.", "author": "Erik H."}

I sampled only 3 flavors Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache, Peach Vinegar Cobbler with Toasted Nutmeg and Salted Honey Marshmallow & Walnuts. The peach cobbler was my final choice but all 3 are very good. I got the kid size because I had a pretty heavy meal before hand but man that kid size scoop was tiny and for $4 I expected a little more. \n\nEvery month they have new limited flavors. This month (May) had a lot of flowery flavors, which I didn't really care for. When I went to the Portland location their flavors seem more interesting than the ones here.

The Peach Vinegar Cobbler was wonderfully creamy, tart, and sweet with a nice nuttiness from the toasted nutmeg and good crunch from the crumble. \n\nAnd, with the sweet aroma of freshly made waffle cones wafting in the air, you better order your ice cream in a waffle cone for good measure.  \n\nAside from their uniquely delicious small batch, handmade ice cream, the staff is incredibly and genuinely nice...every one of them. One of the owners, Tyler made his way down the line introducing himself and answering questions about their various ice cream flavors.

It helps that the menu of the regular classic favorites (offered all year around) and seasonal flavors (rotates monthly) are posted on the windows.

The two went together very well and the lightness of the chocolate did not overpower the strawberries.  The homemade waffle cones (+$1.25) was calling my name but since I was sharing, I opted for a cup instead.  Next time, I will get a double all to myself.\n\nThank you Portland for bringing such yummy goodness to SF.

All the flavors are out of the box- but keep your mind open and taste the whole menu if you have to!\nI ordered the honey lavender with the almond cluster with salted gonache. And my neice ordered a chocolate shake.\n\n I got my order right away but then we waited, and waited for the shake. After 5 minutes I asked the cashier how long do shakes take. She told me they take a little longer with them- but it should be right up. I waited another 5-7 minutes, and I finally see a worker pouring the shake into a cup, then walk away. Okay? \n\nI approached the cashier again- and pointed out the shake asking if that was mine. She walked over to ask someone, but somehow got sucked into doing something else and I waited ANOTHER 5 minutes until the brought me the shake. By this time, I was expecting this to be the best shake ever. But I took a sip and it was average. My niece wasn't too happy about the 15+ minute wait either. Plus the chocolate gonache in my almond cluster was over salted! I had to pick out the huge pieces because it was too much. But the honey lavender was delicious.\nThey need to give customers a heads up about the wait for the shakes- and also not overly salt the chocolate.", "author": "Mariela S."}

The Honey Lavender is heavenly! I love the Honey Lavender at Bi-Rite (still do!) and Salt & Straw does it justice in a whole different way. The floral scent is strong, but not overpowering nor overly sweet. I will be skipping the line and grabbing a pint of that to-go next time! I am also looking forward to getting a scoop of the Sea Salt w/ Caramel Ribbons flavor on my next visit. The ice cream here is super duper creamy, exactly the way I like my ice cream!\n\nThis is more of a to-go place as the interior is small. People wanting to taste test everything is what keeps the line moving at a somewhat slow pace, but I can't really blame them with all the unique flavors the place offers!

I always would rather have less volume and more variety.  \n\nFavorites:\n-cinnamon ancho & cajeta, uniquely savory (SF exclusive)\n-cascara shrub w/candied hibiscus, this is coffee with a botanical twist (SF exclusive)\n-caramelized almond s'mores, if I had to choose one, it would be this one, decadent and so smooth (SF exclusive)\n\nOthers:\n-honey lavender, very good and fragrant\n-olive oil lemon, flavors were not grassy or pronounced, no citrus at all\n-terenga baobab juice & coconut (v), good, nice and tart, a tad too sweet\n-roasted strawberry tres leches, SUPER sweet, but a crowd favorite\n-Sightglass coffee, single origin Dandelion Chocolate, I didn't like the combination, like java on it's own, my personal preference\n\nTried a taste of the sea salt w/caramel ribbons, would recommend, very creamy and a good balance, but it's not something you want a lot of.\n\nAlso got a waffle cone to 'crumble' into my flights for $1.25.  Other toppings are: hazelnuts, sprinkles, hot fudge, caramel, whipped cream and salt.\n\nI lean towards firmer and colder, like to savor my sweets slowly, this stuff turns into a puddle fast, I guess it helps them move people out of the shop.  \n\nIf you don't want to wait in the queue, grab pints from the fridge and check out to your left at the square payment registers.  \n\nConclusion: stick with the SF exclusive flavors.

I love their unique take on traditional flavors as well as their seasonal flavors that keep changing.\n\nThe staff are super courteous and allow you to sample as many flavors as you like. Once you're ready, you have three options and they are (in increasing order of size) 1. Kid scoop 2. Single Scoop 3. Double Scoop. For the single scoop, you also have the option to split one scoop between two flavors. The single scoop is usually a very generous quantity of ice cream and if I'm feeling full, I go for a kid size scoop. Finally, if you are in a hurry and want to skip the line, you can walk straight into the store, grab a pint and take it home.

It's around 5 in the evening and the line was around the corner which makes sense since it's grand opening day. Waited an hour before I got to try their ice cream and it was worth it. The flavor I was most excited about was their honey lavender(seen it all the time on Instagram). Honey lavender is amazing, it tastes like an earl grey but with slight hints of sweetness with each bite. I ended up with a single scoop($5) with a waffle cone(+$1.25). The waffle cone is huge so you really get your money worth here including the big scoop of ice cream. \n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:\nThe workers are really nice despite the hectic demand for ice cream. You can try as many flavors as you want but I tried to keep it under five since the line was way too long. If you don't want to wait, you can walk in & grab a pint and pay. This is how you skip the line, the down side is that you don't know which flavor is good(unless you had Salt & Straw before). \n\nRecommend? \nHeck ya!

I made the trek up to here on a Monday afternoon and there was a 10 minute line. I heard it was crazy long over the weekend though. What makes them so magical?

Even if you think you don't need a pint of ice cream, the pint is $11 and a scoop is $5... so if you were going to go with someone, might as well get the pint. \n\nSalt and Straw has been all the hype lately, and I'm not sure I entirely think it's justified. I came on a Friday night after dinner which was a woeful mistake -- the wait was about 20 min long which to be fair, is generally tolerable, but meh, all I wanted was some ice cream. \n\nWhere I think Salt and Straw really exceeds is being able to combine some really crazy ingredients together to come up with pretty decent flavors. Since I also had to wait so long, I unabashedly tried several flavors before landing on one of the seasonal strawberry sorbets, which I know, is a sorbet and not ice cream, but it tasted the best to me and I figured seasonal is better than a regular ice cream. \n\nIn general the ice cream tasted good, but it wasn't as good as some places where I've just had my mind blown when I tried it. It's pricey but the portion size is truly massive, so I think the price is actually fairly reasonable. \n\nTo be clear, I don't think it's bad ice cream, but I think I might just be too simple and prefer cleaner flavors rather than the complexity of what they're able to do. I did try the triple folded vanilla and while it was rich and creamy, it wasn't something I was dying to have more of.

Ordered a waffle cone with the following: almond brittle with salted ganache, sea salt with caramel ribbons, roasted strawberry tres leches, and sightglass coffee/single origin dandelion chocolate and all of the were quite good.

Not all of them work, but I gotta respect them for putting that stuff out there.  Sometimes you hit gold, like the goat cheese and olive brittle I had in LA.  The good and simultaneously bad side is that each city has its own exclusive flavors, even when it comes to the flavors regularly on the menu.  It's fun to try new flavors in new cities, but I'm only in LA so many times out of the year and I need my goat cheese ice cream!\n\nThis location is on the smaller side, but we did manage to find a seat at the bar.

The line was super short and if you're just buying a pint you can skip the line. \n\nI got two scoops, the Black Sesame and the Chocolate (sorry i can't remember the exact names).

The servers were really helpful and welcoming - just super nice, chill people.\n\nMy friend decided on the honey lavender and the strawberry tres leche, and the honey lavender was so fricken good; the flavor of the lavender really came through and balanced well with the sweetness of the honey.\n\nThree stars because of the caramel and the overpriced ice cream - but also it's San Francisco, so I don't know what I was expecting.", "author": "Lily H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-27", "description": "Here's how you can get 4 scoops and a waffle cone for less than $10:\n\nOrder a double scoop (2 full scoops for $7), split scoop it (turns those 2 full scoops into 4 kid scoops for an extra $0.50), add a waffle cone (extra $1.25).\n\nOne split double scoop = 4 kid-scoop-sized flavors for $7.50. Add that waffle cone to make $8.75.\n\nPerfect portions at a perfect price for 2. WINNING.\n\nReading Vivian S's review while waiting in line was really helpful because she clarified that the $11.50 tasting flight is 4 kid scoops. Naturally, I began churning cogs to figure out a more cost-efficient way of getting more flavors for less money (2 split single scoops = $11, 2 double scoops = $14). 1 split double scoop was the answer, and I chose to leave my 2 scoops in a cup while my boyfriend placed his 2 scoops in a waffle cone. Yes, the kid scoops are smaller than the full scoops, but the full scoops are already huge. I would say it's 2.25\" diameter versus 2.75-3\" diameter for the kid scoop versus the full scoop, and 2 kid scoops was already too much for me. I ended up scooping my second kid scoop from my cup and plopping it on top of my boyfriend's scoops, which appeased his initial disappointment in how meager his 2 kid scoops looked in his big ol' waffle cone. Size doesn't always matter, gosh.\n\nPreference for the flavors we sampled/committed to:\n1) Freckled chocolate zucchini bread (farmers market series, and 1 of 2 flavors I ordered). They take their freckled woodblock chocolate and throw in chunks of yummy zucchini bread and spices like cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. This is a good flavor to eat in a cup because the zucchini bread acts as the starch to balance the sweetness from the ice cream.\n2) Peach vinegar cobbler with toasted nutmeg (classic, and 1 of 2 flavors my boyfriend ordered). Salted vanilla ice cream with clumps of peach jam that complement the nutmeg crumble. This is a decadent flavor, so get it in a cone.\n3) Roasted strawberry tres leches (classic, and 1 of 2 flavors I ordered). Vanilla ice cream with clumps of strawberry jam. Rich and creamy, so get it in a cone (yes, it was a bit overwhelming when I ate it solo in my cup).\n4) Carrot cake batter & hazelnut praline (farmers market series). Carrot cake and candied hazelnuts? Brilliant.\n5) Freckled woodblock chocolate (classic, and 1 of 2 flavors my boyfriend ordered). A solid vanilla ice cream sprinkled with chocolate explosions. Works in a cup or cone.\n6) Green fennel and maple (farmers market series). A complicated but enjoyable flavor.\n7) Eggplant honey custard (farmers market series). I wanted to love it, but I didn't.\n8) Olive Oil & Lemon Custard (classic). Citrusy and creamy, but something was off.\n\nUnique flavors, quality ice cream, great customer service, and affordable when ordered the right way ;)", "author": "Adele F."}

The PERFECT spot for dessert right after dinner!\n- Flavors are unique with locally sourced ingredients and a rotating list of seasonal flavors each month, which is really neat and your taste buds will be hit with a surprise in comparison to the basic/classic flavors they may be used to. I absolutely love trying new and unique flavors, so it's definitely what keeps me coming back.\n- Salt and straw's ice creams are creamy, rich, hearty and satisfying. No sorbet's or refreshing type of ice creams here.\n- They sell pints that you can easily grab and go, and most importantly, skip the line to go straight to the register. In-n-out, my kinda thing, but the inner fat kid in me always wants to try all the seasonal or flavors I haven't tried, so I suck it up and wait in line. :) \n- Seating comprises of stools along the windows\n- When sampling flavors they use metal spoons and I found out there is a hole underneath the ice cream glass counter made just for dropping in dirty spoons. Who knew?!\n- My latest indulgence for the month of Feb seasonal flavor is NeoCocoa's Black Sesame Brittle & Brown Sugar. This was absolutely amazing and the pairing of black sesame brittle over a chocolate ice cream is delicious. \n\nImprovements\n- Line can get long especially on weekends. Weekday evenings are recommended, you'll get to skip the line or only have to wait a little bit. \n- Been to the Hayes location and this one is pretty much comparable as they offer the same flavors and size/space is about the same. \n- Pricer like the hipster and local ice cream shops in SF, but they use locally sourced ingredients and it's quality. \n\nTips\n- Parking may be hard during peak lunch and dinner, especially on weekends due to the all the retail shops and restaurants along this street.

Seems like there is always some kind of line when I stop by. But that day I really felt like getting ice cream so I lined up and stared at the pamphlet to decide what I wanted to get. My eyes naturally wandered over to the holiday flavors section and I sort of knew I was going to go for a seasonal flavor. \n\nWhen I got to the front of the line, I was able to sample a couple of the flavors before deciding to what to get. I appreciate the great service and patience from the staff as they wait for me to decide what flavor I wanted. I sampled some of the holiday flavors and the regular flavors and finally decided to go for the Apple Brandy & Pecan Pie ice cream in a cone. However, if the holiday flavors weren't in the store, I would have most likely gone for the Olive Oil & Lemon Custard since it had a very fresh taste. \n\nNow I must say that it is hard to disappoint me with ice cream, and I don't think that I've ever had a bad ice cream, but I must give this store a five, just because of the great service and the excellent ice cream there. I'm always a fan of establishments that innovate and come up with new flavors of ice cream to serve, and it was a pleasure sampling their unique flavors.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-04", "description": "YES!!! I no longer need to drive down to Portland for my favorite ice cream! Salt & Straw's ice cream is a very rich and creamy (containing at least 17% butterfat) and they take a lot of time to ensure that as much air as possible is gone from the mix. This results in very smooth ice cream without ice crystals that so many other places have. The ice cream isn't too hard or too soft--it doesn't take a lot of effort to eat.\n\nWhile Salt & Straw has a number of more common ice cream flavors like vanilla, Gooey Chocolate Brownie, and Sea Salt with Caramel Ribbons, I actually prefer the more unique, savory options. The Olive Oil & Lemon Custard is a great example of interesting flavors that work very well together in an ice cream. The lemon flavor is sweet, while the olive oil gives it a great depth and finishes off cleanly. My favorite of all the current flavors is actually the Peach Vinegar Cobbler with Toasted Nutmeg; the flavors both stand alone in the scoop and meld together harmoniously.\n\nIf you think that the San Francisco location of Salt & Straw is just going to feature ice creams exported from Portland, think again. All of the ice creams are made locally in small batches, and most of them are even tailored around local produce and vendors. For example:\n\n- The Olive Oil and Lemon Custard features oil from Berkeley Olive Grove.\n- The Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches uses Oxnard strawberries.\n- The Salted Honey Marshmallow & Walnut uses walnuts from Ferry Building favorite Alfieri Farms and SF Bay Wildflower Honey from Marshall Farms.\n\nThe service was also phenomenal. Despite the hoard of people, the girl I ordered with took her time with me, offering to let me try a sample of each of the flavors (which I happily took advantage of) and explained a bit of how they make the ice creams and each of the flavors.

U like spice try this.\n\nI got fresh cheese with strawberries...taste like strawberry cheesecake. Yum! We also got birthday cake. It was pretty good, but probably not something I would get again.\n\nThey have ice cream flights but it can only be done if your staying.

Also, if you want to buy a pint of ice cream, you can skip the line. They have a sign inside that says: Let's get straight to the pint. I totally appreciated the pun! I think it made my day!\n\nI tried the freckled chocolate zucchini bread, and it was wonderful. They have a very extensive list of limited edition FLAVORS and classic ones too. Their limited edition ones are very creative and include others like green fennel and maple, and eggplant honey custard, which I definitely want to go back and try. But their ice cream is very creamy and flavorful, yet not too overwhelming. Also, I didn't even find the zucchini bread flavor too sweet or rich. It was a perfect balance. I also tried their vanilla flavor, which they call double fold vanilla. It was the most perfect vanilla ice cream I've ever tasted.\n\nThe CONE was perfect. It was crispy and crunchy. It was a sweet waffle cone that perfectly complemented the ice cream!\n\nSERVICE was friendly. It may not be the fastest, as they let you sample flavors.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-02", "description": "As a former Portlander, I was so excited when Salt & Straw arrived in San Francisco earlier this year, especially since we tend to get left in the dust when it comes to popular food joints expanding out of their home states (I'm looking at you, Blue Star. LA and Tokyo before us, really?). And coming here, I really do feel like I'm back in good ol' PDX. There's always been something a little magical about peering in those windows to see the bright interior, like a Portland version of Edward Hopper's iconic painting, Nighthawks. Your eye is drawn to the orange and white awning, making you momentarily forget you're in the bougie wasteland that is Pacific Heights.\n\nI've been here twice on weekday nights, and the place was packed both times, but lines moved relatively quickly. It's a small store compared to most Portland locations, and so the crowdedness bothered me more than anything, but it wasn't worse than any other foodie hotspot.\n\nAs for the product - I always tell people that the best ice cream I've ever eaten was a seasonal flavor from Salt & Straw made with turkey stock. I looked forward to finally getting to try it again after four years, but they were already on to offering winter holiday flavors. It was November 29, and I'd thought the flavors would last through the month; guess not.\n\nThough I was disappointed - a bit salty, you might say - I ended up happy with my choice of Apple Brandy & Pecan Pie. A bit of a misnomer, the two flavors combined gave it more of an apple pie taste, but that was more than fine with me.\n\nI also appreciated the staff working to accommodate my family of five. They moved us to a separate counter to taste and order, which really helped our Salt & Straw newbies not get too overwhelmed and hold up the line.\n\nA tip: Salt & Straw's ice cream reportedly contains 7% more fat than regular ice cream, and consequently is extremely rich. Their scoops are also quite generous, so I'd recommend getting a kid's size unless you're really in the mood to indulge.", "author": "Maya K."}

Very clean and neatly products displayed.  The reason for the 3 is the waiting to pay for your ice cream.  I watched and saw that who helped you would also be ringing up your purchase.  I saw people eating most of their ice cream while waiting in line to pay.  If I would be in a rush I did not want to finish my ice cream before I left the establishment.

I always try different flavors, and sometimes I change it up, but time after time I get the freckled woodblock chocolate. It's the perfect blend of saltiness, high quality chocolate, and creaminess. They use the best ingredients that are sourced locally no matter what city they're in, and the ice cream is so high quality. \n\nI love that they have such random and unique flavors for each month. They definitely aren't afraid to try anything! I used to go every single month when I lived in LA to test the new flavors - I am committed to Salt & Straw. It's worth the hype, even though you do end up paying almost $10 for a scoop of ice cream.

This location is on the corner of Filmore and California, just down the hill from the California Pacific Medical Center and just a block up Fillmore from Pizzeria Delfina.\n\nThe Ice Cream: A double scoop is $7 and a waffle cone is $1.25. Even for San Francisco that's expensive but thankfully you get some of the most inventive ice cream flavors I've ever tried. Lemon olive oil, Sightglass+Dandelion mocha, eggplant, zucchini bread, fennel, etc. It's ALL amazing. Who knew that zucchini bread chunks would work well in ice cream??\n\nThe Service: Patient, friendly, and fast - it's as good as it gets for ice cream service.\n\nConclusions: This place is an awful value, has long lines, and parking in Pac Heights is fairly frustrating, but ****** Salt & Straw makes some of the best complex avant-garde ice cream in San Francisco with a smile.

With so many tempting flavors it was quite hard to choose. I sampled (and forgive me if I don't remember the official flavor names):\n\n- Wildflower honey with walnuts (seasonal)\n- Honey lavender\n- Sea salt with caramel ribbons\n- Berkeley Olive oil something or other\n\nAll four of the above were MIND BENDINGLY GOOD. I did not know what to expect with the unique flavors but I was not disappointed in the least. I ended up getting a scoop of Honey lavender and a scoop of the olive oil one in a waffle cup... (Side note: the waffle was so fresh and delicious! One of the best I've ever had)\n\nMy dad got the Black olive and goat cheese one... I tried a little spoonful and it was probably one of the most DISGUSTING things I've ever put into my mouth. Almost died. But I hate olives with a passion so that's why. My dad loves olives and he raved and raved about his flavor choice so that's that for you.\n\nOverall this is definitely my new favorite ice cream spot in the Bay Area!

The line looked super daunting but decided to wait it out. They give menus out in line so you can check out the available flavors and have an idea of what you want to try when you get to the front. I was shocked it only took 30 minutes from when we got in line to when we got our ice cream, especially compared to how long I waited at the Portland location.\n\nI was pleasantly surprised at how efficient of a system they have here. It's a bit hard to explain, but instead of waiting until you get to the counter to get samples, an employee comes up to you in line and asks what flavors you want to try, brings you the samples, then scoops your ice cream. So, by the time you get to the actual ice cream counter you already have your scoops and are ready to pay. Once again hard to explain, but it helped the line move SO much faster than having a huge crowd at the ice cream counter.\n\nI got a split scoop with the sea salt caramel (a classic in my book) and some chocolate one with flakes of chocolate in it too. The sea salt caramel is delicious, but super rich so I definitely wouldn't be able to finish an entire scoop of it on my own. I commend them for their innovative flavors, but damn all the Halloween ones were SO WEIRD (Chocolate covered crickets? Gray sherbet?).

Even their \"classic ice cream flavors\" are unlike anything I've seen elsewhere. They also have special flavors that change monthly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-11", "description": "Even with SF's ice cream scene where liquid nitrogen and small batch are the norm, I was ecstatic when Portland's beloved Salt & Straw opened its first SF shop. Given their legendary reputation and the mind-blowing array of creative flavors based on local vendors, I don't think that raving about it like the S&S fangirl I am will be very helpful, so I'll write my review FAQ style.\n\n1. How does it compare to the Portland locations?\nOf course, it's not exactly the same, but of course, a local S&S beats going all the way to Portland. \n(-) As expected, the space and available seating are smaller, and it's a tad more expensive (though this accounts for the fact that tax is included in the price). \n(-) The first time I went, my biggest gripe was the fact that my ice cream melted so quickly... I literally had to run outside to take my storefront picture and then eat it immediately afterwards (oh, Instagram problems). It's partially my own fault for getting a double scoop in a regular cone; this is a great excuse to splurge extra for that housemade waffle cone.\n(-) I did prefer the Portland version of some flavors. I thought the combination with lemon custard made the SF shop's olive oil ice cream too thick and rich, and I found the Sightglass with Dandelion chocolate to be somewhat underwhelming because the coffee taste was so mild.\n(+) The staff are just as cheerful and generous with sampling as in Portland, and I've been able to try nearly all the flavors without any problem when I go during non-peak times. \n\n2. What's all the hype?\nTL;DR The wait is worth it.\n(+) When each flavor sounds like a poem and each description sounds like a novel, you know you're onto something P: They put a lot of thought into carefully blending an array of ingredients. Sometimes it creates a distinct ambiance (like grandma's rhubarb crumble with toast anise), a twist on comfort food (caramelized almond s'mores), a fine dining esque concoction (peach cobbler with toasted nutmeg), an exotic surprise (cascara shrub with candied hibiscus), or a curveball that will blow up your social media (raspberry liqueur with edible flowers). \n(+) I love how chunky their ice cream is--there's so much stuff in each scoop, it's halfway to a sundae in itself. A lot of them have a ton of cake/crumble/cookie embedded right in the ice cream and is swirled. For example, their SF classic roasted strawberry tres leches incorporates roasted strawberries, sweet cream, tres leches cake with condensed milk, and strawberry vanilla jam o.O This is mind-blowingly awesome considering how other places charge you extra for each sprinkle of a topping or drizzle of sauce. \n(+) They do a great job of featuting local businesses. Sightglass, local farms, Ferry Building goods. You almost feel as though you can sample the Bay from this ice cream shop. \n(-) Long lines are nothing new for ice cream in SF, so I do suggest going earlier in the day so that you can take your sweet time (pun intended) with samples.", "author": "Edna C."}

Next time i would try sightglass coffee with dandelion chocolate.   $5.00 for single cone, 50 cents for added flavor.  Sugar cone was my favorite since it was really crunchy.  Waffle cone was $1.50 more.  Double is $7.00.  Try all the flavors you want. Go at 10:00 pm with free parking and fewer  people.  We took 20 minutes to get through the line.  Ice cream was melting fast on this warm night.  I can't imagine waiting during the day in the heat when there was a heat wave.", "author": "Helen L."}

They are so delicious!! Tres leches is my favorite cake, and topping it with Oxnard strawberries just adds a freshness to it. (I used to live in Oxnard, and am very biased when I say Oxnard strawberries are the best).  The peach vinegar had the right amount of bite to it, a good balance between the subtle peach. \n\nSeasonal flavors change, and the line can get very, very long. But they're efficient in getting orders and don't rush you when you're sampling flavors. \n\nThere's bar seating inside, and free water. They also sell other food items like chocolates and jams. \n\nNext time I go, I'm getting a flight!", "author": "Vira P."}

After loving their WeHo and Venice locations, I wanted to introduce it to my Berkeley friend who ended up loving it! \n\n\nSelection: Like all their other locations, they have plenty of interesting and funky flavors. My friend tried the goat cheese with habanero, and almost choked and cried, but it was an experience. I already did my goat cheese time in LA, so I stuck to more traditional options, like their roasted strawberry and their flavor-of-the-month birthday cake.\n\nService: we sampled many flavors, but our person was patient and smiling the entire time! She ended up recommending two flavors for my friend, the honey lavender and salted marshmallow. \n\nPricing: Always on the pricier end, but it's a nice treat. It came out to almost $14 for two single split scoop waffle cones. Split scoop is highly recommended! It's like 2 scoops for the price of 1.25 scoops.", "author": "Olivia C."}

I tried the gooey brownie, salted honey marshmallow, strawberry tres leches, peach cobbler, and carrot cake batter (on the special menu). I ended up going with a split scoop of gooey brownie & salted honey marshmallow. My only complaint is that I wish they could've put the 2 scoops side by side in the cone so I could get both flavors together, because they paired so well (and were both delicious!). My brother got the strawberry tres leches which was also pretty solid. The peach cobbler and carrot cake batter had actual pieces of cobbler/cake in them! Not the soggy gross kind that happens when other people try, but actually the right consistency for what they were. Huge props for being able to pull that off. \n\nOverall, I'll definitely come back (when there's a relatively short line) and try some of the more experimental flavors (fennel, zucchini bread, etc.). While they do a great job of making quality ice cream, I think some of their flavors fall slightly short, which is the only reason they're not getting all 5 stars.", "author": "Kavita P."}

It might of been their salted honey marshmallow & walnuts flavor, but just the word marshmallow caught my eye.  \nWhen I got there, I noticed a line. The wait wasn't long at all but I didn't mind waiting because when I looked at the menu they had so many good choices, I didn't know what to get. I was debating between their honey marshmallow and raspberry liqueur & edible flower sorbet. I decided to get the raspberry liqueur flavor because of the edible flowers and I believe this flavor is only here for this month (correct me if I'm wrong). It was $5 for a single scoop. I quickly took a few pictures of this ice cream before it fell into my Daiso bag (it doesn't stick well to the cone). But  I quickly scooped it back up into the bowl they gave me and ate it all. It was so delicious and refreshing. The edible flowers in my ice cream was really cool to see too. I wished at that moment I had a whole bucket full of that ice cream. \nThe next time I decided to come here I tried their honey marshmallow flavor. I sadly did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would. I think it's because of the walnuts. I really regret not getting the raspberry liqueur and edible flowers sorbet again.

I'm just going to cut to the chase so here we go ...\n\nI have to give it up to the lovely girl who helped my friends and I taste-test practically ALL of their flavors. LOL I'M SORRY I'M THAT SUPERFLUOUS PERSON who literally wants to try everything -- I'm sorry that I want to be completely satisfied with my purchase, even if it is \"\"just\"\" ice cream !! My friend said I missed out on some of their limited edition flavors, but for the month of July I believe their theme is \"BERRIES BERRIES BERRIES!\". Unfortunately although I did try their plethora of unique and accurate flavors, none of them stuck out to me ! I'm not one to be SUPER picky about my ice cream flavor or anything, but no flavor at the time stuck out and made me feel like I HAD to get it. I eventually just settled with getting Honey Lavender cause I had felt obligated to get a scoop after trying out so many flavors. I actually was happy I settled with it because I thought the flavor was well done here ! It didn't taste soapy or anything compared to honey lavender that I've tried at other places.\n\nI really do have to send positive vibes to the girl who was more than happy to keep giving me samples and reassuring me that it was okay.\n\nAlthough $5 might sound a tad pricey for a scoop of ice cream, low and behold that scoop of ice cream is WORTH IT because it's the size of a tennis ball ! They also pack ice cream into the cone so you have to take that into account as well. If you get the kids scoop, it's compared to the size of a golf ball. +1 for the crunchy and yummy sugar cone, and another +1 for the huge delicious looking waffle cone (I think it's an additional $1ish ?)\n\nRegarding the line, my friends and I were fortunate that we didn't have to wait because we came a bit after 11AM ... yes that's right, 11AM in the morning LOL ...

You know what else SF's location shares with it's Northern sisters? THE LONG LINEEES. Expect to wait here if you're visiting after sunsets, or post dinner. \n\nHowever, worth the wait of course! I love Salt & Straw's courage in promoting new, outlandish flavor combinations that you wouldn't find anywhere else. When I heard of olive oil ice cream, I must admit, I scoffed and was skeptical. Trying it in shop made me realize that you should chase your dreams, because olive oil ice cream is a surprisingly good thing, so anything is possible. \n\nCame out with a 2 scoops, the almond brittle on the bottom and the meyer blueberry lemon on the top.

While it's not the best ice cream ever in every aspect it definitely wins in innovation. And don't get me wrong, their whacky flavors work! Bonus points for the amazingly friendly service! The only downside is lines can be long, parking in the area is awful, and it's definitely pricy (paid almost $10 between tip, the waffle cone, split scoop, and double scoop).\n\nDepending on which Salt & Straws you go to the basic menu will be different (LA vs SF vs Portland). And of course you have the seasonal options too! For May the theme is flowers. Some of the more interesting options offered during my visit include: salted honey marshmallow, strawberry tres leches, peach vinegar cobbler w/ nutmeg, teranga baobab juice & coconut, rhubarb crumble w/ toasted anise, and Sarsaparilla and Dandelion root beer float. \n\nI tried all these and they were all delicious!

The strawberry was yummy. The peach was good too, with the crust and peach you can see. Honey lavender you can clearly taste the lavender. Marshmallow was a bit sweeter than I like. Olive oil with lemon was good too. The Roxy Road tastes like popcorn, reusing old popcorn from Roxy theater, flavorful but texture was a little soft. I went with the sea salt and honey lavender!\n\nGenerous portions and I loved the option of splitting a scoop between two flavors for $0.50 extra - totally worth it to get two flavors in one without being over filling.

Why have I never seen roasted strawberries before? Oh that's right, because no one else has ever been as amazing and awesome enough to think of doing it. The strawberry flavor is intense from the roasted strawberries and straw/vanilla jam that swirls through it. Definitely my favorite flavor out of the other ones (even though everything is great)\n-PEACH VINEGAR COBBLER: Everything's just peachy here, especially with this ice cream that was so creamy, but had some crunchy bits of biscuit for that whole cobbler effect.  \n-HONEY LAVENDER: Floral but balanced with the sweetness from the honey, this one is also a must get (or at least a must try!)\n-OLIVE OIL & LEMON CUSTARD: I love this combo of flavors! The tanginess from the lemon cuts through all that creaminess\n-ALMOND BRITTLE: For anyone who loves really rich flavors, this one had really deep chocolate flavors along with lots of almonds (duh)\n-TERANGA BAOBOB JUICE AND COCONUT: whoa this ice cream is non-dairy?? It's really refreshing and slightly tangy, but still so so good! \n\nTHE LONG VERSION: \nWhenever I wonder, \"How much better can an ice cream get?\" IT GETS SO MUCH BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE IMAGINED. I finally had the blessing of Salt and Straw opening a location in SF so that I could try it. I was lucky and snagged fairly close street parking and I walked up to a line that was shorter than I had mentally prepared myself for. Hooray! 30 mins is fine in my book when I was expecting an hour or more. Inside there are about 6 or so bar stools along the window, but other than that, you'll have to take your goodies to go. I was (again) lucky and snagged one of these seats. When it was finally my turn, the employee helping us was extremely helpful and cheerful, encouraging us to try everything. Who am I to say no!?!? I went with only trying 6 though because I felt bad holding up the line (okay fine I lied, I totally would've tried EVERY flavor, but my friend already paid so her ice cream was melting by the second since she was waiting for me to take a photo of her!).

One of us was super disappointed she fucked up the date of an ice cream festival two weeks early, and we still needed something cold to bring down the summer heat. Luckily the SF bro recommended this place, and our timing was perfect to minimize the ridiculously long line.\n\nEven around 12 on Saturday the line circled the corner shop. Lucky for us, the line moved super quickly and we got to the ice cream window in about 15-20 minutes after about 50 people, so not bad! Plus you get a sneak peak of the menu at the window to consider your choices to sample.\n\nI opted for a Single Scoop on a waffle cone, and split it so I could try two flavors. Honestly, 50 cents is totally worth it - you basically get one scoop completely inside the cone and one on top - 2 for 1! I tried Double Fold Vanilla on top, with Almond Brittle and Salted Ganache on bottom.\n\nNot sure about Vanilla \"dialed up to 11\", it just tasted like solid vanilla ice cream. That ends up being the base anyways for the brittle/ganache variant. The almond brittle was excellent, nutty and sweet, but the Salted Ganache may as well have been SALTED Ganache. The ganache had a great texture, but it was extremely salty even the brittle didn't salvage it. It's a good thing I had the split Vanilla scoop to divvy out the salt - I don't think I could've eaten just a single scoop of just Almond Brittle and Salted Ganache.\n\nSalt and Straw gets props for highest creativity in SF ice cream shops, that's for sure. But I also find that in general they're going towards the extremes of taste - besides my salty ganache, flavors my friends had were extremely floral or sweet. I'm still interested in trying some of the other flavors, but I just can't see my friends and I waiting in the peak lines of over an hour.", "author": "Dave N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-05-07", "description": "5.6.17 \n3.5 STARS \n\nSo what's the hype? Their unique flavors all the way from Portland. \nSo is it worth the trip? Well it depends on what flavor ice cream you enjoy, it's either a hit or miss. If you have an adventurous taste buds for interesting and sweet flavor combination, this is the place for you!    \n\nFor someone who enjoys ice cream with well balance sweetness and natural simple flavors (specifically tea flavored ice cream), S&S flavors seem to be trying too hard on some flavors, with multiple components and flavors packed in one. Therefore, it was a solid 3.5 in my book. S&S is similar to other ice cream shops such as Bi-Rite, Humphry Slocombe & Mr & Mrs. Miscellaneous and Garden Creamery (My fav by far!).  \n\nICE CREAM: \nSalt and Straw offers combo packed flavors ranging from fruity, floral, nutty and natural sweetened (honey, caramel, etc). They have their original flavors, in addition to rotating monthly flavors. Sizes begin at $4 for a kids scoop which comes in either a regular sugar cone (free) or a cup. Then $5 for a generous scoop of ice cream + $1.25 for a home made waffle cone. The scoops size and price increases from there. In addition to ice cream, they also sell S&S branded items included jarred cream and jam and clothing items. I tried a couple of flavors, but they were all really sweet (even for a dessert lover like me). The flavors we tried included: \n+ Rainbow Sorbet (May Flavor): a sherbet with a amalgamation of fruits and flower. Like spring in my mouth! Flavors actually worked really well together but I would not be able to eat a whole scoop of this as it was far too sweet for me. \n+  Honey Lavender (Original Flavor): The lavender flavor was diffidently there & reminded me of Bi-Rite's honey and lavender. But there was too much honey added - making it again, too sweet. \n+ Wildflower Honey w/ Ricotta Walnut Lace Cookies (May Flavor): Tasted almost like vanilla based ice cream with, honey and chunks of soft chewy cookies mixed in. I actually liked this one the most because of the texture the cookie gave the ice cream and the flavor. \n+ Olive Oil & Lemon Custard (Original Flavor): think of a lemon sherbet mixed with olive oil. Didn't really stand out for me, but definitely one-of-a-kind flavor. \n\nSERVICE:\nThere was a line out the door at 3PM on a Saturday. Not surprising. Though it went pretty quickly because we wanted around 15 minutes. There are multiple ice cream scoopers stationed to help an individual customer - grabbing them (generous) samples and then scooping their ice cream. You grab the cone and pay at the register. Very efficient service.  \n\nAMBIANCE: \nGrab & go kind of shop. As there is very limited seating and is usually way to crowded to eat inside the shop. The shop has the typical ice cream shop look and pretty spacious. \n\n Verdict: Although S&S did not blow me away with their flavors I did appreciate their creativity. I would return possibly to their their monthly rotating flavors.", "author": "Samantha F."}

The wait was only about 10 - 15 minutes in the mid-afternoon. Why so long, you say? Duh, samples offered - that's why!\n\nfyi, ice cream shop etiquette dictates that you should sample no more than 3 flavors if there is a line behind you. It was tough but I followed the rule. For my samples, I started with the Chocolate Gooey Brownie. You gotta love chocolate to get this flavor because it was a very assertive & bold with a deep dark chocolate taste. My second sample was the caramelized almond s'mores. This flavor is reminiscent of going camping.\n\nThe flavors we ended up ordering were the Caramelized Almond S'mores and the Sightglass coffee with Dandelion chocolate bits. \n\nHow were they, you ask? The caramelized almond s'mores had a really good tasting graham cracker cookie ice cream base, pieces of sweet almond and chunks of chocolate. De-li-cious!\nThe coffee ice cream was coffee-centric and again the chocolate bits were a nice dark chocolate from local chocolatier Dandelion.\n\nBoth flavors were enjoyable and the staff were great. Very patient!\n\nAll told, I think I'll wait a bit until the hype dies down to return to try other flavors.\nAs some Yelpers have advised, if you don't care about sampling, just buy a $11 pint and go.\nIt's a bit too maddening in the shop (super small space). \n\nIn comparison to the S&S in Portland (NW shop) that I visited last Fall, this is about a third of the size of floor space. They too have a line at the Portland shop.

Usually cones are underwhelming and I only get them to hold the ice cream. I have convinced myself that ice cream tastes better when eaten out of a cone versus a spoon.

The patrons ahead of me sampled about 5 flavors and a woman behind me was getting impatient.  I didn't mind as I was planning to do the same (and she actually did too).\n\nI sampled a few flavors and landed on a split single scoop of Honey Lavendar (subtle flavor) and Almond brittle with salted Grenache ($5.50). \n\nEven as a single scoop, it ended up being more than I could eat and I felt the sugar rush and crash. Note I'm not an ice cream or sweets aficionado so I'm not the best person to give a review on ice cream.  They do offer a kids scoop for $4 which I probably should have asked if I could have instead.\n\nThe reason I'm giving the experience 2 stars is towards the bottom of my cup, in the Almond brittle scoop, I discovered a light brown hair.  I didn't end up saying anything about it because wasn't expecting a refund and didn't want them to feel bad, but it definitely ruined the experience for me.\n\nOverall experience was fine and would come back with friends who may love ice cream more than me and only if there's no line.\n\nPost-review update: The owners reached out to me to give a gift card for the experience.

Loved it so much that Erick T. almost surprised me with 5 pints of ice cream delivered right to my doorstep. But he spilled the beans one day, and I vetoed this idea because I couldn't get myself to allow him to spend $65 on ice cream. But who knows, I may have to take him up on his offer sometime because SF's location was sort of a disappointment for me. Would rate this location 3.5 stars. \n\nAs much as I wanted to order a waffle cone, I opted for the tasting flight so I can try more flavors. None of the flavors really stuck out to me except for the Almond Brittle with Salted Ganache. My heart dropped when they said they ran out of this flavor. Already sold out at 2:30pm on Memorial Day?! Tears.\n\nI ended up ordering the following:\n\n1. Sea Salt Caramel (server recommended) = Realized I don't like this flavor at all\n2. Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches (server recommended) = 4/5\n3. Olive Oil & Lemon Custard = 5/5. A must try! Very refreshing and was my favorite flavor\n4. Sightglass Cofee & Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate = 2/5\n5. Chocolate Gooey Brownie (sample) = 3/5\n\nThe creaminess was great but was a bit too sweet for my liking. I also found the flavors at Portland's location to be more unique and interesting.\n\nI'm not ready to give up on Salt & Straw just yet, so I'll be back soon to see if any new flavors will leave my mouth watering for more.

My boyfriend loved the salted caramel but I found it a bit too salty for my taste. A lot of the flavors were too sweet and thick for my liking. After extensive sampling I settled on the Strawberry and Rhubarb crumble (May seasonal flavor). I was into fruity but the flavors weren't overpowering. I especially liked the crumble with the Rhubarb - tastes just like pie!\n\nI'll give it to S&S that their flavor combinations are unique and most are ones I've never tried at other ice cream locations before.

Originated in Portland, Oregon, this is one of the few ice cream places that blends exotic and glorious flavors like you've never imagined! This isn't your average ice cream place, this is a place that is able to make turkey and bacon ice cream! If that doesn't convince you to come then I don't know what will. \n\nCame during their grand opening to a short line that within minutes grew around the block. Every item on their menu is creatively designed with fresh but insane combinations of flavors that the only option is to get the tasting flight because really how can one choose. \n\nCool thing about this place is that they have a set of limited flavors that they created specifically for this SF location that you won't find at their Portland or LA locations.

Be prepared for a long wait outside and dropping $$$ (adjusted for the ice cream category). \n\nFOOD: Flavors are New American (i.e., Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches, Honey Lavender, Balsamic Nectarine Crumble, Buttermilk Meyer Lemon with Blueberries) Deluxe (every ingredient is one or more of artisanal/local/small batch/organic). Texture and flavors (from the ice cream to the waffle cones) are an A+.  The vanilla was my favorite and a strong reminder of why true vanilla is anything but \"vanilla.\"  \nWater tap inside which I as an aquaholic deeply appreciated. It's hard to enjoy something as sticky as ice cream while dehydrated :). \n\nSERVICE: Despite the fantastic ice cream, I think the servers are the most outstanding part of Salt & Straw. Super friendly staff who give generous tastes and are as patient as you've been to get to the front of the line :). Maybe even more! I love the system of your server coming to meet you at the front of the line--it makes the noisy shop seem less chaotic and there is no confusion as to who is helping whom. \n\nAMBIANCE: Inside walks the line between chic and adorable.

You can lurk by the merchandise if it is terribly cold outside, but otherwise consider taking a walk with your treat!\n\n\nPricing as of 7/2017: $5 single scoop, $7 double scoop, $11 pints, and $1.25/cone. $.50 for some Portland salt on top", "author": "Helen W."}

Line was out the door and wrapped around the corner when we got there, but it moved pretty quickly. \n\nSince it was my first time here, I tried:\n\n- Olive oil and lemon custard\n- Sea salt with caramel ribbons\n- Cheese and strawberries (seasonal) \n- Peach vinegar cobbler with toasted nutmeg\n- Roasted strawberry tres leches\n- Salted honey marshmallow and walnuts\n\nDespite the peer pressure and cajoling I got from my three guy friends (SO not fair that guys have faster metabolisms in general) to get a double scoop, I opted for a single scoop of the Sea Salt Caramel in a waffle cone. It tasted exactly like what it sounds like--hint of saltiness complemented by the sweetness of caramel, all wrapped in a creamy ice cream scoop. I finished the entire thing, felt slightly sick after, but was satisfied. \n\nWhy 4 stars and not 5? Because,in my deepest ice cream heart of hearts, Humphry's, where I can eat a pint in one sitting and still want more, still holds first place. And because, despite all the rave reviews for S&S, I honestly wasn't super impressed by the flavors. \n\nWould I come back?

They have their standard menu with, I'm guessing, year round flavors like sea salt caramel ribbons and strawberry tres leches, both of which sound amazing! They also have a local (SF only) and seasonal menu that changes. \n\nThe prices here are a little bit pricey for what you get, ($6 for a small scoop in a cone) and i do wish that they had more vegan options, but overall a good addition to the ice cream scene in SF!", "author": "Kay A."}

Salt and straw is by no doubt the most hyped up/ go to place to check out in the city. Why? Because it's a famous ice creamery straight from Portland. It has 12 classic flavors and 5-6 limited edition SF exclusive ice cream flavors. Okay let's talk food! \n\nTIP: DON'T BE SHY IN ASKING FOR A SAMPLE OR 9. I SAMPLED BASICALLY THE WHOLE MENU BEFORE CHOOSING. #noshame\n\nWhat Me and my friends got/sampled: \n\n-Sea salt Caramel Ribbons\n-Almond brittle with salted ganache \n-Honey Lavender\n-Roasted strawberry Tres Leches \n-Peach Vinegar Cobbler with toasted nutmeg\n-Salted Honey Marshmallow and Walnuts\n-Teranga Boabar Juice and Coconut \n-Cascara Shrub with Candied Hibiscus \n-Raspberry Liqueur & Edible Flower Sorbet\n\nAs you can tell, I chose to sample the most out of this world flavors/ Bizarre AF/ popular flavors to get an idea of what I do like and what I won't try again. I really wanted to understand why Portlanders swear by this ice cream. The only way to learn, is to try it out. Now why is this 3 stars? After tasting a plethora of flavors, one common theme kept reoccurring: it was overly too sweet. Although, Most of the flavors come though, the overall sweetness level kills the whole dessert. Their was no fine balance. Alright let's dissect my notable flavors. \n\nSea Salt caramel Ice cream was one flavor I was excited to try because the creation of this ice cream was helped by no other than James Beard Award winner Mark Bitterman. He is like the pioneer of the creation of why there is sweet and salty ice cream flavors. This ice cream delivered. If your in a salty and sweet kind of mood, then this is your ice cream flavor. However personally for me, I like my ice cream not too sweet but if your in the mood to try an Ice cream by the renowned James Bitterman without burning a hole in your pocket, this is it! \n\nPeach vinegar Cobbler, is a hit or miss. When I tasted it all I tasted was that bright vinegar taste. However my friend who also tried the peach vinegar cobbler loved it! This flavor is a must try! it will really get your taste buds going woah, that's some bizarre got me feeling some type of way. \n\nWhat I eventually got is the Raspberry liqueur with edible flowers. LOVE IT! It was a balance of sweet, tart, and the textures of the edible flowers got my taste buds revived from all the sweet ice creams. YOU MUST TRY THIS FLAVOR LAST, TO RECOVER FROM SWEETNESS OVERLOAD. THE RASPBERRY LIQUEUR THEY USE IS A $40 dollar St.George Spirit which is an artisanal liquor made in Alameda. It's a sorbet that was definitely thought out. The edible flowers they use are a mixture of: pansie, rose petals, orange blossoms, and borage according to their website. This flavor will only be here in the month of May, so make sure to try it out before it goes away! \n\nOverall, the taste and experience is 3 stars. It's not a place that I would honestly go back to just to have ice cream. Thought I must say customer service is amazing! they were really encouraging me and my friends to sample everything before picking without judgement. \n\n\nParking: HA! Good luck. Either give yourself 30 min to find parking or park 4 blocks away to the residential. \n\nLine: although the line looks daunting and long, it actually isn't. The wait time is actually 15 minutes, so it's not that bad compared to 1 hour wait. \n\n\nHappy food tripping! Remember their is no shame sampling here.

All the workers are super friendly and quick to chime in when you're looking for a suggestion. And of course, before you decide on a flavor, you can try as many as you like. Minus one star for the hefty price tag. If you're planning on sharing, it's better to get a double scoop than to just get 2 separate scoops since it ends up being only a dollar more for 2 scoops vs 2 individual scoops. \n\nPros:\n- Unique flavors that just work \n- Seasonal flavors available for people who come often \n- Sorbets available for people who aren't a fan of ice cream or can't eat dairy\n- Very friendly and helpful staff \n\nCons: \n- Very limited seating inside, so be prepared to eat your ice cream standing or take a pint to go \n- Pricey for what you get", "author": "Diana C."}

I got to try out several flavors here, including: Imperial Stout, Roxie Road, Sea Salt & Caramel, Olive Oil & Lemon, Peach Vinegar Cobbler, Honey Lavender, Coffee, and a couple more that I can't remember. Some of the flavor combinations, to me at least, weren't really clicking and wasn't really that good. It feels as if it was a little too adventurous. Maybe other's did enjoy them though. My normal go-to is Coffee ice cream, but to my surprise, their coffee ice cream here, as coffee ice cream is so simple, was not that good...pretty disappointing.\n\nI remember in Portland, the flavor that caught my attention was the Strawberry Balsamic Vinegar with Black Pepper. Now that definitely sounds like some random insane flavor, but that was REALLY good! I ended up getting the Peach Cobbler flavor here in San Francisco, but it's once of those flavors that are really really good in the first few bites, but then get's a little too rich and tiring.\n\nThe line is always long at this location as well, in prime time Pac Heights.

It was Saturday at around 11:00 pm, and the line stretched down the block! Luckily it wasn't very cold, and the anticipation of ice cream kept us in line. (There were a couple people who gave up waiting in line after 20+ minutes. Suckers.)\n\nLuckily the workers came out to give free samples to whoever was in the back of the line! Also, they reminded everyone that if you were buying a full pint, you can skip the line and go straight to the front.\n\n(But a pint isn't IG-worthy, so in line we stayed.)\n\nJenny was the employee who helped me and my friends, and she was awesome. She was very patient in letting the three of us sample anything we wanted. And she gave decently sized samples so we could really taste the flavors.\n\nStrawberry tres leche: PERFECT. The cake pieces were so delicious. If I were to return to buy a pint, I would choose this flavor by a mile.\n\nOlive oil: Surprisingly awesome. This is my second favorite flavor, and I ended up pairing strawberry tres leche + olive oil for my single split scoop waffle cone. It doesn't taste like olive oil, it's hard to explain but it's sweet and not weird tasting.\n\nCascara shrub with candied hibiscus: Meh, not good.\n\nGreen apple mayo sherbet: Disgusting and tastes like crap. Don't get this one. It wasn't sweet, it was just gross and kinda savory.\n\nStrawberry coriander leaf sorbet: Too sorbet-like for me. I want ice cream, dammit, not juice!\n\nHoney lavender: Delicate and subtle-tasting.

It just tasted like chocolate.\n\nI highly recommend the strawberry tres leches and the olive oil. They're incredibly good and the ice cream is high quality. If you give zero fucks about Instagramming the cone (lol) you should just get a pint of the strawberry tres leches and the olive oil and be done with it.\n\nBTW, no samples when you buy a pint, unfortunately.\n\nThe only con is how stupid it is you have to pay an additional $0.50 to have two different flavors for your ice cream scoops.

With all the hype that Salt & Straw has, this was def a no brainer. I actually even went to the pop up on Thursday at Westfield but they only had 4 flavors of which none tickled my fancy. So Friday, the hubs and I took a early afternoon break and headed over. The line wasn't that bad actually and it went at a decent pace. The founder was there too which is pretty cool. \n\nInterior was nice but not that many tables to sit at. However, you can buy other stuff like chocolate, popcorn, and apparel. They have actually 3 different scooping areas where you can go to. You can also try as many flavors as you want. They have a list of classics and then a list specific to SF which I think is cool. I settled on the Strawberry Tres Leche and Honey Lavender. Def 5 stars for the ice cream. It tasted fresh, on point, and worth all the hype. The hubs got a homemade cone and freckled flavor and really enjoyed it too. Their single are also pretty big scoops for $4.50. However, why am I docking off a star - WHY IS IT AN EXTRA $0.50 to split a scoop? That's a bit annoying when all the other ice cream shops around do it for free. Regardless, I'll be back for sure.", "author": "Tao Tao W."}

They let you try the different flavors and I went with Chocolate Brownie (a no brainer) and Olive Oil & Lemon Custard. I loved both flavors. Creamy, but still reasonably solid.

At the front of the line, there were a couple servers that allowed you (and the friends in your group) to taste however many flavors you'd like until you knew what you wanted! I think we tried half the menu among the four of us, and our server was INCREDIBLY patient and insisted we try more if we wanted. Best service ever! I ended up choosing a single scoop of the honey lavender on a waffle scone... so, so delicious.  It was exceptionally fragrant and light. My boyfriend had the roasted strawberry tres leches. This was the best strawberry ice cream we've had, but it did taste too sweet as we ate more of it. We enjoyed our ice cream inside the store - there are several seats by the window, but if it's crowded, there is space to stand around too. \n\nIf you love all the flavors or cannot decide which one to order, they have a tasting flight of four flavors for $11.50! We didn't order this, but we saw many people who did. \n\nLastly, the only con is that their waffles are inconsistent. Two of the four cones we ordered were stale... and the other two were amazing.

The SF location has a lot of empty, unused space, so the ambiance is not 100%. The flavors are just as unique as the other locations. However, my ice cream melted pretty quickly upon purchase, so either the freezer isn't turned up high enough or they're using too much cream. It wasn't as mindblowing of an experience as the other times I've had Salt and Straw in Portland. But still worth trying in SF.\n\nService wise, I came on a Thursday at 7pm, right at prime dinner time so the line wasn't that long. I imagine it gets much longer post-dinner.

We came at about 6pm on Sunday and the line was roughly 20 people long. I didn't think it would be a terrible wait and so we decided to stick it out. It ended up being a wait of over an hour, and just because of pure inefficiency and probably because the employees were new and still learning how to do their jobs. The line barely moved, and once we were part of the line inside the store, it was still a good 15 minutes to our turn. \n\nWe opted to do both a tasting flight of 4 flavors plus a single cone (yes, we're fatties I know =P) so that we could try more things. We got the wildflower honey with ricotta walnut lace cookies, roasted strawberry tres leches, sea salt with caramel ribbons, and chocolate gooey brownie in the tasting flight, plus a single scoop of the sightglass coffee + dandelion chocolate w/ a waffle cone. Amazing, amazing flavors and my mouth was in heaven. It's too hard to choose which one was my favorite!\n\nProps to the worker who was helping us for giving us generous spoonfuls of flavors we wanted to try before ordering, but I had to repeat my order several times before she got it right, and she didn't know where each flavor was located and had to run around opening all the lids before finding the right one. There was no line at the register and the bottleneck was definitely all within the ordering station. \n\nOnce they are able to smooth out the ordering kinks, I'd love to come by more often. I do wish there was more seating (there were only ~4 stools at the front of the store), especially for those opting for the tasting flight but have nowhere to eat it.

Last July was all about berries, so I had Meyer Lemon Buttermilk with Blueberries as well as the creme fraiche and strawberries. really nice fruit and cream pairings. I also tried the Goat Cheese marionberry habanero, which really did deliver on all three flavors, impressively. I was a little bit underwhelmed by the freckled Woodblock chocolate. I like woodblock chocolate, but the flavor was not as rich. The sea salt with caramel ribbons by comparison was exactly how I imagined it.

According to the store's signage, this flavor is being retired at the year's end, which is a huge shame, considering it was the best ice cream/gelato I've ever enjoyed. (To put that into perspective, I ate at San Gimignano's Gelateria Dondoli in 2009, the year they won World's Best Gelato.) \n\nI entered believing I'd get their [also seasonal/soon-to-retire] Gingerbread Cookie Dough ice cream, so when we finally got to the head of the deservedly long line and a very friendly staff member asked if we could sample anything, I deferred to my fianc\u00e9. He tried several flavors and licked the sample spoons clean, but when he got to the apple brandy and pecan pie, he turned to me wide-eyed and said, \"You have to taste this,\" almost shoveling the half-sampled spoon in my mouth, knowing how much I'd love it once I tasted it. The staff member helping us chimed in, \"A lot of people say it tastes like Christmas,\" and it does in the sense that it's a magical gift to your tastebuds, so delicious that every bite and lick elicits the child-like anticipation and overwhelming joy of Christmas morning. \n\nThe ice cream itself is flavored with apple brandy, dotted with generous chunks of pecan pie.  I've NEVER liked pecan pie, but Salt & Straw's was so good that I could've easily enjoyed the pie on its own -- I also could've enjoyed the apple brandy ice cream solo, but Salt and Straw made an excellent call in combining them to make one orgasmic ice cream.

Flavors that you have to read three times over because your brain is confused that this is ice cream. \n\nA couple of observations though... 1) the line is long because the checkout process isn't quite efficient (maybe it's in the works). The scooper is also the one to ring you up so he/she has to stop serving and bounce back and forth between the register and ice cream.

Foolish me I was not prepared for the line down the block which ended up being an hour long wait. It's Salt and Straw though so we waited in the cold.\n\nOnce it was our turn to order, I went for it, trying all of the new flavors leaving nothing untasted. Don't be shy here. They encourage you to try some or all of their flavors and I love that about them. My favorites were the some of the SF classic flavors but as always there were a few rotational flavors that were good too.\n\nNote, if you're not familiar with Salt & Straw, they have 12 \"classic\" flavors; six unique to each city they have shops: Portland, LA and now SF,  and six available at all of their shops. These 12 will always be available.\n\nThe Friday before the first of every month they offer a changing menu of at least 5 flavors that follows a theme across all shops. The flavors and ingredients are unique to the city in which they're served. April was different for the opening of the SF shop in that they opened mid-month and didn't follow the same Inventor's Series theme of the other shops.

Not sure if tres leches specifically comes through but I'm definitely ordering again to verify\n- Peach Vinegar Cobbler with Toasted Nutmeg: my favorite SF classic flavor so far. I can rarely resist cobbler, crisp and the like. The fruit was sweet but not cloyingly. Trust me just order this.\n- Sightglass Coffee and Single Origin Dandelion Chocolate: Salt and Straw's best coffee flavor. Coffee flavor really comes through while pairing nicely with the chocolate\n- Olive Oil Lemon Custard: my second favorite SF classic flavor. The olive oil flavor is subtle but adds a nice texture. The lemon custard was lovely. Citrus fans should scoop this\n- Salted Honey Marshmallow and Walnuts: the Salted honey is definitely prominent which I liked but the marshmallow fluff swirl overwhelmed my sample. Need to scoop it to get a better feel for the taste.\n- Teranga Baobab Juice & Coconut: need to try this flavor again. I can't decide if I like it or not yet\n\n*SF April Flavors*\n- Cinnamon Ancho & Cajeta: very cinnamon forward but I enjoyed it.\n- Caramelized Almond Smores: I wanted more almond and graham cracker swirl in this, but the Marshmallow just took over\n- Cascara Shrub it's Candied Hibiscus: haven't tried anything like it before, kind of liked it but I didn't get a scoop\n- Green Apple Mayo Sherbet: mayo overpowered the green Apple in the sample. I think maybe in a scoop I might've enjoyed it more. Really creamy texture too\n- Strawberry Coriander Leaf Sorbet: good strawberry flavor but I wanted creamy ice cream this trip\n\nSalt and Straw has now taken a strong 1st of place in my list of best ice cream shops in the Bay Area. Run, don't walk, and taste this amazingly delicious and creative ice cream!", "author": "Lindsey C."}

While visiting SF I tried their peach vinegar cobbler with toasted nutmeg ice cream and it was delicious! I also tried the dracula's blood pudding (seasonal flavor for fall) and it was sooo good! Both were flavorful, and weren't overly sweet. I'm not a fan of cones but I highly recommend their house made waffle cones - you can smell them being made fresh from outside the parlor. Crispy and totally worth it! I heard these are sold in pints in New York, so I'm glad I can at least get my hands on them in the east coast until I can visit SF again!", "author": "Cristina V."}

On the menu here is bone marrow and cherry as well as olive oil and lemon curd. It's really a hit or miss in terms of which flavor you get, but I will say all are consistently rich, smooth and creamy without being overwhelmingly heavy. \n\nThe selling point at the store is that you can stand up front and try as many flavors as you want. This naturally results in the line backing up and it's pretty variable how long it'll take. Usually very speedy, however.

This is my favorite ice cream in America. My friends say the same. Also amazing are the Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches and the Banana Bread Pudding. Don't stop eating for anything-- someone might take it away from you.\n\nThe reason why Salt and Straw is head and shoulders better than any other ice cream is because each and every one is hiding a full scale bakery dessert inside the ice cream.

The taste of this ice cream was mostly lavender and surprisingly overpowered even heavier flavors like the chocolate and coffee I tried. Out of the four flavors I tried, this was my least favorite and I would have replaced it with another scoop of the other flavors if I could choose again.\n- Sightglass coffee and Dandelion chocolate (4/5): More chocolatey than coffee-flavored but the ice cream was nice and creamy with good depth of flavor without being too rich or overwhelming. The chocolate nibs instead added some nice crunch and difference in texture to the ice cream.\n- Strawberry and tres leches (4/5): Honestly just tastes like good strawberry ice cream until you hit the chunks of cake which honestly taste like the graham crust of a cheesecake which wasn't necessarily a bad thing.\n- Olive oil and lemon (5/5): YES. YES. Y-E-S. Really hit a gold mine here. The flavor was perfectly creamy and the lemon flavor was just enough without being overpowering. The flavor was just really light and refreshing overall without being too sweet.\n\nThe workers were also fantastically patient despite all the people asking for tons of samples of each and every flavor. \n\nOverall, the ice cream wasn't as creamy as Bi-Rite or others but that made the ice cream feel lighter and not as dense either.

There are only a few vegan flavors, changing often with the season, but they're good enough to overlook that minor gripe. It is so creamy (I believe it's coconut-based), perfectly sweet and flavorful. The employee helping us checked to make sure their waffle cones were vegan as well.\n\nI happen to love this area of San Francisco, even if it may come off as a bit pretentious.

It was a Friday night and the line was fairly long, but it moved fast.  I love that they let you sample as many flavors as you like and I did quite a bit of taste testing.  My favorites were the gooey chocolate brownie, the honey lavender and one of the seasonal offerings bone marrow and smoked cherries.  I ended up getting the bone marrow and smoked cherries because it was one of the limited seasonal flavors.  I got a single scoop, but splurged and upgraded to a waffle cone (a must as a first timer).  The ice cream was some of the best I have ever had; it was so creamy, with just the tiniest bit of savory as an aftertaste, because of the bone marrow.  I walked back to downtown with my cone in hand and it was honestly the perfect way to end a very long week.  I am both happy and sad that Salt & Straw is located out on Fillmore.

After seeing all my friends hit this place up in LA and Portland, I was so happy I'd get a chance to add it to my list of ice cream escapades. Seeing their unique flavor offerings against a sea of standard \"gourmet ice cream\" places (exception being Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous which you must go to as well!) had me dying to grab a bite.\n\nSo my sister and I trekked our way over here up a massive hill from the Marina and decided on a scoop of the Sightglass coffee and Dandelion chocolate (really tongue in cheek nod to knowing their local brands), plus the vinegar peach cobbler. First off, the scoops we got were MASSIVE. Not sure if this was because we got an amazing worker or that's just how they do things. Both were so creamy and packed with the flavor of their namesake--it made other artisan ice cream places I've tried seem bland in comparison! The acidity of the vinegar really balanced the sweetness of the peach and of course, I loved the cinnamon-y cobbler bits.The only thing is it melts incredibly fast, even though we visited on a chilly SF day.\n\nThe workers were super helpful and friendly and move the line fast. They also have a rotation of much weirder seasonal flavors like zucchini bread ice cream which you should be sure to sample for fun.\n\nI will definitely be back to sample their Honey Lavender and indulge in whatever flavors they come up with next", "author": "Rene B."}

They were quick once we got through the crazy line. (Don't worry though. It was worth the long wait.)\n\nAmbience: 5/5 It is a really cute ice cream joint. The decor is great, aesthetically pleasing.\n\nFood: 5/5\nThe Teranga Baobab Juice and Coconut was a very unique flavor but very rich and delicious. You can taste the ginger and coconut, and they go together really well. \nThe sightglass coffee was really good. \nThe peach vinegar cobbler was even better. It was really rich with a hint of nutmeg, the perfect touch. It was the perfect blend of tang and sweetness, with added crunch from actual peach cobbler. \nThe apple pie was good to an extent. The taste of the cinnamon and other spices was good, but the apple flavor was kinda off. To be fair, the employee explained that they used an apple substitute, not actual apples. \nThe sea salt and caramel was amazing. Period. Good mix of salt and sweet with the twist of it being sea salt ice cream with caramel added. \nFinally, the banana bread pudding was incredible. It was a unique ice cream flavor, yet so familiar. The best I have ever had. \n\nThe Salt and Straw is somewhere you have to try at least once. It only makes it more appealing because their flavors change every month", "author": "Jayna J."}

Anyway, I love ice cream so thought I would try it. I should preface this by saying as far as SF ice cream places go, in my mind nothing beats Bi-Rite. They have everyone beat on texture, consistency, creaminess, and sweetness. \n\nLine wasn't bad for Memorial Day but it was also pretty overcast and cold. They have a lot of servers moving through customers which is great, and it seems like the servers don't have to move to far away from what's in front of them at their stations to serve you a variety of flavors which is smart to keep the line moving too.\n\nI tried four different flavors (the strawberry one, freckled chocolate, chocolate brownie, and sightglass coffee with dandelion chocolate one). My wife got the coffee, I chose the chocolate brownie. Both were wayyy too sweet! Creaminess was good, consistency was good but the sweetness really over-powered and ruined it. My wife didn't finish hers. Maybe it was an off batch? Judging by the lines and the popularity I would think they'd be pretty consistent so maybe not. \n\nVerdict? Bi-Rite still the measuring stick to go by with ice cream in SF compared to all the old and newer contenders. My two cents.", "author": "A S."}

Unfortunately service isn't really the main thing when you're there for the ice cream.\n\nSelection: .5 stars - plus 1 star for variety; minus half a star for inconsistency of quality between different selections.\n\nQuality: 0 stars - look - having an overabundance of sugar or caramel or salt or whatever - is just not great in quality control. Quality reflects good balance between elements in the recipe. There appears to be a basic inconsistency here.\n\nTaste: 0 stars - I've tasted ice cream in every major city I've visited in the US (13), several minor cities (4), a town or two (3) and 4 separate European countries. I've eaten sorbet, sherbet, ice cream, gelato in countless artisanal flavors, shaved ice, popsicles, and a variety of fried ice cream, bonbons, ice cream shakes, malts, and floats as well as a fair share of sundaes and occasionally some surprising dessert creations that aren't easy to describe. Across that plethora of desserts, I have never in my life thrown away a creamy flavorful frozen concoction sometimes called ice cream before - until now. Way too sweet even for the obsessed ice cream fan that I am. Also too salty. And the cream base - not doing it for me either. I practically chug whole milk daily - so it's not from a particular intolerance.\n\nAll I can think of to say in response to all the five star reviews is - what exactly are you eating here - because it's not what I ate. \n\nI had the strawberry tres leches, the salted honey marshmallow, the freckled woodblock chocolate and the honey lavender - 2 scoops each visit - 2 separate visits in July to verify that I wasn't crazy or ill.\n\nI wanted to really like this place since I'm an adventurous tester of new tastes - but - instead I can only offer a cautionary tale of a hope gone wrong.\n\nPerhaps a year from now the food scientists concocting these flavors will cut back on the mounds of sugar and I will have a reason to try again.\n\nI threw in an extra half star because I didn't have a choice.

I assume it would be packed if it was a sunny hot day.  They give pretty big tasters which is awesome!!

Its not a large place and its really more of a get your ice cream and walk around. They do have bar stools by the window to sit and eat. Reason for my 4 stars is mainly the seating area is lacking, the line system seems crazy, the counter area where you can try flavors and place your order is small.

It isn't. More on \"why\" there's a line later. \nWhat's so great: first off, the employees. They're super happy, friendly, & professional. But mostly they're patient. Bless their hearts (as they say in the south). \nSecondly, the variety of flavors is amazing, and how brilliant of them to have \"seasonal flavors\" to keep the stock fresh & new.  \nThird, if you don't want to deal with the line, & you can restrain yourself, you can simply go to the front of the line, grab a pint, pay & leave. \nThis is a FANTASTIC business model, & many different stores can learn from them. \nThe main reason there's a line is because while the employees are in fact working their butts off, customer after customer asks them for several \"trials\". This takes A LOT of time. The more time an employee spends with a customer, the longer each transaction takes. The longer each transaction takes, the more backed up it gets. The more back up it gets, creates a line. Lines cause curiosity & excitement.  (Which in turn, create longer lines)\nThey know this so well, that above the freezer, it reads, \"Let's get straight to the pint...grab a pint & skip the line.\" (Pic posted)\nThere it is. Easy, right?  They know there'll be a line because they create it. If you're impatient, you grab a pint & pay more than the amount you would've paid had you just gotten just a scoop.  The person who helped me was shocked that I didn't want any trials. Because the employees aren't slacking & are super attentive & friendly, & immediately thank you for waiting, the wait seems worth it. \nIs it?\nThe ice cream is very good. No doubt about it. But the line thing is annoying. That's why I took one star off.  But I understand WHY they do it. People won't take more than 3-4 trials because it looks greedy, & that costs S&S nothing. Technically, they could just give those people smaller scoops, really. \nI'm not sure if I'll go back. Not only because I don't live in Pac Heights, & parking is tough around there., but mostly because of the line. \nIt's too long of a wait for a scoop of ice cream. \nAnd it'll never change because it's their business model. And it works well. Damn well. \nSo in the end, it's very good ice cream, with fantastic employees, but a stupid line that really could be changed. (if they wanted to...)", "author": "Reed S."}

They literally made me give it back so she could redo it. Seriously?? It's $6, let me have the 2 extra bites. Plus, you just threw out perfectly good ice cream!! 2nd offense (yesterday) my husband and I went in and each got a single scoop on a waffle cone and I took one lick and the scoop nearly rolled off. Normally the cone is filled with ice cream and this guy just put a small scoop resting on top of the dry cone.

It is a great concept and won't fail to impress ice cream lovers, who want to try out something new. The concept originated in the state of Oregan. Soo.. there is a fixed menu and there is the one which changes every month. \nThe fixed menu has some great novelties!! I adore their Brittle almond with salted ganache!! It's Soo popular that it is unavailable at times. Other flavors like Roasted strawberry Tres leche, olive oil with lemon and Dandalian chocolate is great too !!!\n\nFor the monthly menu - they do great mixes !!\nJuly is the month of berries and they will have all berry ice creams !!! I tried their flavours for the month of May and June too!!\nEagerly waiting for August.\nAlso also ... There is a huge line outside so many times. Like a 20-30 min wait. Be prepared to stand outside even though its that day when there is wind blowing all over!! This is also because you get to try as many flavors as you want before you decide your best one.

Server took pity on me because of tire trouble from the Nimitz and comped me my cone, which I gave as his tip.

With all the hype and long lines, if you're going to wait an hour just get the tasting plate ($11.50 for 4 flavors). \n\nCompared to other ice cream shops, their flavors have the staples of chocolate, vanilla, and coffee, but overall seem to skew towards floral and fruity flavors. I got the tasting with;\n-Olive oil w/ lemon custard: I fell in love with olive oil ice cream from Humphrey Slocombre, but this version is tasty! The olive oil imparts a smooth buttery texture with the flavor in the aftertaste that is well complimented by the lemon custard, which isn't overly tart.\n-Double Fold Vanilla: Solid vanilla, safe option, but was expecting more oomph.\n-Rhubarb Crumble w/ Toast Anise: Probably my favorite flavor, very reminiscent of an ala mode/pie with a jammy/fruity rhubarb and hints of licorice from the anise.\n-Wildflower Honey w/ Ricotta Walnut lace cookies: Deep honey flavor with added depth from the ricotta giving it some body. The walnut cookies add a great texture without adding extra sweetness.\n\nAlso tried my friends sightglass coffee with cacao nibs: Smooth coffee with depth of flavor accentuated with cacao nibs. Definitely a favorite coffee flavor.", "author": "Chad S."}

I declined 3 or 4 times because I already had my mind made up on the flavors. One employee asked me multiple times. What happened next was upsetting. This same employee, who checked with me multiple times,  decided to bypass my place in line and asked the group of white people behind me if they wanted to be helped with their orders. He walked them over and opened up a register. Not wanting to make a scene I shook my head and kept moving forward. The second employee, who was helping the couple in front of me, looked at me and didn't say anything. I smiled at her, but she started to walk away from the counter, so I expected to be helped by someone else. She then asked the group behind me for their orders. At this point I was too upset not to say anything. \nDepending on who is reading this, you may or may not understand what this feels like when you are willing to spend your hard earned money but feel discriminated against.

If you are charging over $10 a pint you can afford to use better ingredients. Give your head a shake for taking advantage of consumer trust. Sure - people might expect to increase their chances of diabetes with ice cream, but chronic inflammation caused by CARAGEENAN is seen as a root cause of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and cancer... as well as increased glucose intolerance and impaired insulin action.", "author": "Mike G."}

The lady behind the counter was making fresh waffle cones, and they looked so perfect and crisp I knew right away I was getting one. I was in the mood for something a little lighter, so I got a scoop of double vanilla and strawberry tres leches, and boyfriend got the marrion berry and brittle almond with chocolate ganache flavor. The complexity in each flavor was insane, the strawberry tres leches had such a fresh and pure strawberry flavor, with puree and chunks of moist, fresh cake in every bite. My vanilla was refreshing, just sweet enough but so crisp in pure vanilla flavor. My boyfriends was the knock out, and I'm not surprised. The brittle almond flavor with chunks of chocolate ganache was such a perfect melody. Yes it was pretty sweet, but the brittle chunks were soft, the almonds were pretty tender as well, with a slight bite. The chocolate ganache chunks balanced the brittle with a welcoming bitterness. The balance made me swoon, and I grabbed the cone out of his hand to taste the lemon marrion berry. The flavor had the BEST lemon flavor out of any lemon ice cream I've ever had. It wasn't overwhelming or artificial at all, just perfect, lightly sweet with a tart finish. The marrion berry puree had a fruity and strong berry flavor to compliment the light crisp lemon. This was hands down one of the best ice cream experiences I had ever had as an adult. And no, I'm not done! THE WAFFLE CONE. It was the FRESHEST waffle cone I've ever had in my life. Most waffle cones are pre-made, too thick, and slightly stale. NOT here. The cone here was so perfectly crispy, light yet sturdy enough, and had the most incredible barely sweet/hint of vanilla flavor I've never experienced before from a cone. Plus the cone complimented each scoop, and I made sure to get a crunchy bite while enjoying my cone. This place is quite extraordinary, and I couldn't recommend highly enough. If someone is giving this place bad reviews, it's because they are miserable people. Do yourself a favor and come here.", "author": "Raquel A."}

They also sell related items that are cute and pints ready to go in the tall glass doors side freezer cases. The only thing that seemed out of sync was the wallpaper. When I stepped back, I realized it's a large blow up a waffle cone pattern, but looks beige, drab and sort of 70s Holiday Inn. Also, the wood floor clashed with the wood veneer on ice cream dipping cabinets. Kinda hokey. The most important thing is the ice cream is amazing.

I say endless because I went in a group of 3 and we all had multiple samples. They were patient and kind. I tried the banana fosters, the strawberry, and the honey lavender. The bananas foster had a weird after taste for me and the strawberry has strawberry jam in it that makes it a little too sweet for my taste buds. I honestly didnt think i'd like the honey lavender but OMG it was delicious. I got a kids scoop in a waffle cone. Usually the kinds scoop comes in a sugar cone but their waffle cones are so yummy.

I don't know if they messed up a batch or if their signature is salty ice cream since their name is Salt and Straw, but I would advise not buying any flavor that you don't taste test first. \n\nAlso the May flavors were great.

Flavors were unique, but I have to say, was underwhelmed. And, outrageous priced!  $5 for a small scoop?  The Salt and Carmel was waaayyy too salty.  There's a bubble for sure in SF.  I won't be back here.  There are as good as options in Safeway.", "author": "Carla M."}

The lines can get long so try to go early.  You do get to try to taste a few before ordering. I would recommend tasting what you decide to order because some times the flavors are a little bit different from what you expect (IE, carrot cake).", "author": "Frederick C."}

I was greeted by a really nice woman named LENA (sp?). She was incredibly friendly and let me try as many flavors as I wanted. Not only was the customer service AMAZING but every single flavor I tried was delightful. I ended up getting the honey lavender which was out of this world delicious!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-27", "description": "Came in for the first time last night after hearing how amazing this place is. I'm not a huge ice cream fanatic, so was skeptical. We sampled the salted caramel, strawberry rhubarb, vanilla, olive oil lemon custard, and root beer float flavors. All were delicious, but my top two were olive oil lemon and salted caramel, which we ordered cones of. This ice cream is expensive and the lines are long, but it's honestly worth it. And I'm not even someone who particularly loves ice cream -- it's typically too sweet for my taste -- but what I love about this place is that they offer complex savory/salty flavors that seem to be a little lighter on the sugar spectrum. Also, the service is terrific and friendly. Will be back! I actually just sent my husband over there again this evening to pick up a few pints for our freezer along with the cones (they offer their sugar cones for free with sale of pints and their waffle cones are $1 each).", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

Goat cheese marionberry habanero is a surprise combination of tastes all in one scoop, all complementing each other.  Then there's meyer lemon buttermilk with blueberries with just the right combination of sweet-tart.  Honey lavender is delicate and soothing.  And, you'll never want a cone made elsewhere.  We had the chance to learn about the whole, thoughtful process at a Ferry Building class.  Plus, we now know how they give back to community in special leadership trainings at HQ.  What can we say---these are scoops with SOUL!", "author": "Paula H."}

I should have taken a taster sample, but they were too busy. I had cheese and strawberries. The strawberry was jam that you buy in the store. I was expecting fresh frozen strawberries no jam. The cheese was the risk and it was bitter. Not a good combo in my opinion. My daughter had the sherbet and she liked it so hence the two stars. I have had better so it is not worth the wait.", "author": "N B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-28", "description": "There is nothing special about this place, and I expect the long lines to dissipate once the novelty has passed.  You will wait for about 30 minutes...the line always seems to be about the same length whenever I pass by.  The classic and seasonal flavor descriptions seem tantalizing.  The interior is a drab beige and the design looks strangely cheap and \"homemade crafty\", considering it's a newly renovated location.  They offer a \"tasting flight\", which may be the best idea ever in terms of ice cream service:  4 single scoops placed in glass bowls on custom wood presentation board.  \n\nI tried:  1.  Freckled Woodblock Chocolate:  tasted somewhat blunted and dusty and lacked chocolate intensity;  the salt and over-sweetness of the base was distracting and left me wanting a sip of water.  2.  Roasted Strawberry Tres Leches:  lots of strawberries, which was nice, but the base with chunks of cake was so sweet and indistinct it basically tasted like a generic \"strawberry cheesecake\" supermarket ice cream.  3.  Peach Vinegar Cobbler with Toasted Nutmeg:  I'm not sure the nutmeg was toasted, but it was definitely a nice forward flavor;  this was probably my favorite of the 4 tasted, but it did still suffer a bit from too much sugar.  4. Wildflower Honey with Ricotta Lace Cookies:  I was hoping for a simple, floral honey flavor, but got instead a whack of sugar, strangely strong lemony ricotta flavor and alot of chewy raw tasting oats;  not bad, just not at all what I expected. \n\nOverall, this ice cream suffers because the base is too sweet, too salty and too distracting.  I feel like someone has spit into my mouth a weird semi salty mucous.  You lose the purity of the flavor and the freshness of dairy.  You would do better to walk 1 block down Fillmore to California and visit Smitten, where the ice cream is still too sweet, but you will get more freshness and the simple goodness of milk and cream is more evident.", "author": "Andrew W."}
