In this area, there are many immigrants from Central American and they have heavily influenced the food in this area. By no means is this place fancy but this place has the best pupusas in the city IMO. My first experiences of food from El Salvador was when I was living in Los Angeles and I absolutely fell in love with pupusas. Good pupusas to me are first of all HOT all the way through, slightly crispy on the outside, cheesy on the inside, not too heavy with masa on the edges but pretty even with ingredients through the middle - and that's the kind of pupusa you're going to get with Reinas.\n\nI hear all these people with the bad service and sanitary issues - meh. I'm a foodie first and everything comes second. I didn't see anything and the service was great. No problem. Standing with this local business.", "author": "Tinaa W."}

Zucchini pupusas didn't taste good. They were  short staffed & you could tell that the person who made the food was not Salvadorean. Too bad that was my favorite place for soap de path.

It's pretty spacious with big tables, lots of lights, and a large tv with lots of families who dine here.  They accept CC's.  I did not see any roaches.  They did NOT discriminate against me - I'm asian.  The bathroom was as clean as it could be when you compare it out in the outer mission with other restos.   \n\n They first served LOTS of yummy thin crunchy just warmed chips with salsa sauce that was pretty mild which I finished off quickly with my jamaica agua fresca.  Their cheese pupusas were thick and fluffy and warm and FILLED with creamy cheese!! YUM!! (you have to order a minimum of 2 pupusas).  I could tell that they had really great homecooking because the usual mexican coleslaw that came with the pupusa was soft and tasty & not too hot, not hard and chewy & hot that you usually find near Mission & 30th St.    \n\nI couldnt eat anymore and so I had my mexican super burrito to go--they gave me LOTS more chips with a BIG cup of their tasty salsa sauce--later when I had space in my tummy to eat it,  I found the filling was too soft and mushy which tasted mainly like bland rice.  \n\nThe service was friendly & fast!!  I would definitely go back to Reina's rather than McDs.  I would try the other El Salvadoran dishes in addition to the cheese pupusas and stay away from the mexican food.", "author": "Frugal C."}

When I called back again, she had a bad attitude and said in Spanish \"En El Salvador no usamos chile pero aqui si\" which roughly means in English, \"In El Salvador we dont use chili, --but here we do.\"\n\nHow rude.  All I wanted was an option for salsa and curtido that reflected the taste of El Salvador, and if I could not...then could they create an optional mild salsa and curtido.

My girlfriend said it was like a taco.. but better. When the dish arrived, it resembled more like a adult size Lunchable (make it yourself food). Two big corn tortillas, which were stuffed with fried pork and cheese within, refried beans, rice, and a caggabe salad, but combined together, WOW! -- the savory pork, melty cheese, crisp salad, creamy beans, all wrapped in a warm tortilla blew my mind on Central American food. \n\nBurrito Super - \nIt's what I came here for in the beginning, right? Your choice of beef stew, pork stew, or shredded beef, with the standard rice, beans, guac, and sour cream; the burrito sure was super in size, but it was just a-okay and the stewed beef was a tad plain. My girlfriend told me not to order a burrito from the start but I wanted to play it \"safe\", and in the end, she was right. LISTEN TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND, GENTS.\n\nReina's serves up some good Salvadoran eats, and this being my first time, I've become a fan! Each dish is overwhelming huge, lots of flavor and freshness, and I can't argue with a bill of (slightly over) only $20. The Horchata wasn't much to my liking though, tasted too rich and \"corny\" but maybe that's just me. Chips and salsa are also complimentary with your dine-in visit (the salsa was bomb!

My boyfriend got a cheese and pork pupusa, friend yucca, something on a corn meal base (kind of like a mini-corn tostada but better), and deep friend stewed pork.  He was in heaven!  I got 2 pieces of marinated chicken with a nice crispy skin, rice, homemade refried beans, a salad, and thick homemade tortillas.  Along with a soda, it came out to be about $25 and wound up being 2 meals worth each.  We'd definitely go bacik", "author": "Jessica G."}

To say that they're the best pupusas in the world is irrelevant.  I can't speak for places outside of San Francisco.  However, in my opinion, they are by far the best in the City, but that's just me.  The chefs put in just the right amount of ingredients, and they aren't cooked to a point where they taste burned like lots of other places I've been to.\n\nThe reason why I'm only giving the place 4 stars, pretty much goes back to what previous reviewers have said about the service being a bit slow, when you dine in.  Another downside is if you're seated near the kitchen.  I don't know if it's just me, or if it's the fact that they are extremely noisy in the kitchen -- I'm talking about plates clattering, spatulas and pots clanging, and loud jukebox music.  If you're dining with friends and plan to engage in conversation, be prepared to holler at each other a little.  Unfortunately, the music is loud in the restaurant.\n\nOtherwise the food is superb.  However, if you don't want to wait too long for the food, try the takeout method.  Just call in, and place your order.  They will tell you how long the waiting period is, so you can plan when to come into the restaurant and pick it up.", "author": "Claudine P."}

We should have just taken our order to go.  I felt as if my party (of 3) were just ignored. Good portion of serving, food is just ok, but i rate things overall. I would have to say this is the worst service I've ever had.. I'll give them another star just for the food alone but they certainly need to pick up on the service. This place is quaint and small and there were 3 other table being served, so you see..it was not that busy. \n\nShe came to our table 2x, once to take our order.. after almost waiting 20 min. the other time was to refill my coffee.. after I have flagged her 2x and waited almost half an hour for the second coffee refilll. The 3rd time she was suppose to come and give us the check, i had to flag her, again she got consumed by another table of regulars.. with just regular conversation and i had to flag another waitress who just came in her shift... If she is the owner or family member, they need to stop and look around and see if others are needing to be tended to and not chit chat away..it was just ridiculously making us feel we should not eat here.. \n\nthat terrible..

I had been meaning to try it, as it is the closest waling distance to my place (aside from McDonald's which is directly across the street). The yellow awning above the place made me think it should be delicious for whatever reason.\n\nFood was pretty good. Not the best ever, but by far form the worst. I expected a little better being in the Mission, but granted it is a bit far off the track.\n\nWe walked in and stood there for 2-3 minutes before anyone even greeted us. They were busy making pupusas, which granted looked veyr good. I ordered a carne asada burritto and my girl ordered a veggie nachos. The burritto was cheesy and delicious, maybe too cheesy? The nachos were NOT cheesy but had fresh avocados on it.\n\nNext time I will try the pupusas.", "author": "K. C."}

If you are a pupusa freak, I guarantee there is no place in San Francisco that makes pupusas better.  Possibly the world. Really cheap as well, two pupusas are about $3 or $4 bucks.\n\nNachos are awesome (carne asada nachos mmmm), all the soups are awesome, and so is pretty much anything else on the menu except the tamales and the vegetarian burritos (the tamales really almost made me hurl, so four stars instead of five for here).  If you like authentic little neighborhood restaurants  you'll love this place. The tiles that decorate the walls are beautiful as well...\n\nI definitely agree that the waitresses do take a long time to take your order but this is a small restaurant and the woman who takes your order probably cooks, busses, and does dishes as well.  Just have a little time and patience when you walk in and whatever you do, order pupusas.", "author": "Mailah G."}

Anyways, this is the only place I will go to because it is the best compared to other places. It is cheap and delicious. The service is good and attentive. The pupusas can be a lil oily, but hey you can wipe the oil off with a napkin or something. My order: 2 pupusas:1 vegetarian and 1 beans and cheese, and a horchata =)", "author": "Shirley M."}

I also asked if I could get a vegetarian burrito & asked what vegetables they used...haha no veggies just burrito with no meat. I asked how much it would cost to put vegetables on their Vegetarian burrito, they wouldn't do it. tried to get vegetables on a plate, not without chicken she said.  So I got stuck with the \"vegetarian?\" burrito and it was the nastiest burrito ever.  Service sucks in this place. Never going back. 100's of better restaurants in the city.", "author": "Joey D."}

I'm used to Sarcasm in the Mexican and American sense, but that was straight up rude.\n\nBut overall I didn't care for this place.", "author": "Alberto L."}

It was Sunday and Don Pico's on El Camino is closed and I had a craving for menudo.  Yeah, for dinner and it wasn't because I had a hangover.  Ha!  DP has really good menudo (but, not as good as my Mom's as hers is out-of-this-world). So, we got into the car and just headed down Mission Street in search of good Mexican food.  Bingo!  A parking spot in front of Reinas.  Hmmm, must be fate.  The menudo is not as good as DP, but it wasn't bad.  The portion was very generous.  I never had Salvadorian food before so I really enjoyed the super thick handmade tortillas.  Loved the jukebox and got to listen to 3 songs by Jose Jose for quarters.  Yeah!  Place feels like home.  Mucho gracias!", "author": "Lizzie L."}

I barely have pupusas and this place is close by and YUM!  The only thing I hate is looking for parking.  Then again, what did you expect from San Francisco?  I always get confused when I go here.  Do we sit down and they take our order? Or do we order at the register and then sit down?  Their pupusas are always extremely filling so I usually order two, one I take back home with me to Sacramento.", "author": "Antoinette O."}

If you are in the mood for authentic Salvadorean food I would be hard pressed to find a place that makes better pupusas. This little hole in the wall has among the best tasting cheese, beans, zucchini & mixed pupusas in the city. They also serve some of the tastiest Salvadoren dishes like Salpicon (shredded beef cured with lemon mixed with diced radishes, onion & mint) Camarones in Salsa Verde (Shrimp marinated in a green chile sauce) and their famous Sopa de 7 Mares ( Soup of the 7 Seas), a great seafood soup filled with fish, crustaceans & veggies! Perfect for those nursing a hangover! The main drawback of this place is the service. The waitress' are really slow on getting any orders to the table and you usually have to wait a good 40 minutes before your food is served. If you can get past that then you're in for some great food!", "author": "Jason B."}
