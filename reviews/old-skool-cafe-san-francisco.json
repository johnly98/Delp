But because you are being waited on by 16 year olds, that is the service you get. Distracted, immature -- and just not great.\n\nI had the short ribs with were tasty but not inspired.  It comes with polenta and a teeny amount of collard greens.

We loved that they have their own parking lot right in front of the door. \n\nThe decor is great. 1920s with red leather banquettes that seat 6. We got seats closer to the bar. It's not a big place so use Yelp reservations. \n\nWe started with the calamari. It was perfectly crispy and fresh and well seasoned. I wish the portion size was larger. It came with aioli and a sweeter sauce. \n\nThe house wine was awful so switched to the better wine. \n\nWe had to have the fried chicken. A drumstick and 2 small breast pieces and a cup of coleslaw. The meat was moist and the outside crispy.  Flavor was nothing special. For $19 I thought there should have been more. \n\nMy better half had the gumbo. Came with 3 shrimp and great sauce. \n\nThe best part was the great service and the live music. \n\nWe'll be back if we're in the area.", "author": "Frank T."}

Then it the leather banquettes and red and black decor. I don't know if they always have live music, but the jazzy that was wafting down from the balcony during our visit really added to the ambience. They stared us off with complimentary sweet potato biscuits. They are delicious two bite wonders coated with homey. From there, we went on to drinks, lavender soda for my friend, pineapple for me, and dinner. She is vegetarian. After mulling the peanut stew, she opted to have collard greens and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was really good and generously portioned. I decided to try the shrimp and grits. It  had Blackened shrimp, bell peppers, and chorizo The grits was super cheesy and had a nice consistency and the chorizo gave it an added dimension of flavor. The portion size was just right too. No meal would be complete without dessert. After pondering the options, I decided to break from my chocoholic ways and have the lavender cheesecake. It was served with strawberries on the side with a lovely lavender syrup and a bit of balsamic. It wan't to sweet and had a rich, creamy texture. i am not the biggest graham cracker fan, but the crust was really good two. it was a really good ending bite.  \n\nThe food was good. But the best thing about Old Skool is the mission. It is run by local youth who act as the kitchen and service staff. Our server Elijah was very polite and told us his story. He had worked in the kitchens for three years and was trying his hand at the front of house. They must be doing something right, because it can be hard to gt kids to stick to anything. I was impressed. The have a small lot if you drive and are right on the T if you don't. Old Skool is definitely work a visit.", "author": "Nicole M."}

Visited yesterday for the first time with my boyfriend. Here's a breakdown of our experience:\n\n5/5 live music: let there be JAZZ!! Oh my, the young adults jamming out were so incredibly talented. Nothing beats eating comfort food while listening to live jazz. \n\n3.5/5 Taumoepeau Ota: I expected this to be more flavorful and the portion was awfully small, only about half a cup of ota. For $11, we expected more than that. Not worth the price and probably won't order this again. \n\n5/5 Peanut butter stew: this was the star of the night for me! It reminds me of massaman curry from Thai restaurants. It's rich in flavor and has a great consistency, not too thick, but not watery. \n\n4/5 shrimp and grits: the grits were fantastic! They melt in your mouth. The shrimp was flavored with the perfect amount of seasoning, but were slightly overlooked and therefore, a bit rubbery. \n\nDon't forget to check in for soft drink!

And what a setting!  The 40s supper club theme decor is fabulous!  You just need a jazz band to complete the experience.  But lucky for us there was a nice young man playing jazz tunes on the piano using his iPhone for his sheet music. How's that for a unique restaurant experience? \n\nThe food here is really good. We ordered several dishes which we shared for the most part, and we enjoyed all of them. We started with the ceviche and the gumbo. The ceviche was refreshing and light and the gumbo was spicy and very tasty! It's one of the best gumbos I've ever had.  The shrimp was tender, not overcooked as they often are, and next time we eat here, I am ordering that for my main course!  My husband and I shared the Mac and Cheese and Fried Chicken entree as well. The fried chicken plate came with half a chicken, a nice serving of garlic mashed potatoes and slaw. The fried chicken was very lightly breaded and seasoned well with spices. Very good, not heavy at all. The mashed potatoes was delicious.  Definitely a good recipe! I didn't eat much slaw as I was getting full by that pointbut it was good too. \n\nIn between courses we were visited by and congratulated by the founder of the restaurant and the social worker working with the young people. They thanked us for choosing to celebrate our anniversary here and gave us a couple of glasses of champagne on the house. How amazing is that?! We enjoyed our Chocolate Mousse dessert with the champagne.  \n\nService was efficient and friendly and the food came out in a timely manner.  There was a group of 40 that came in after we got seated and were into our starters, and another group of at least 20 people celebrating someone's birthday, but the kitchen handled it very well. We did not experience any delay in our food and the food just kept coming out for the large groups! The kitchen people obviously know how to handle large groups. \n\nI would recommend making reservations especially if you're dining on the weekend. I reserved through Yelp about three weeks in advance. Don't worry about parking as they have a parking lot for patrons.  Free parking in front of the restaurant!!! How rare is that in San Francisco?!  Wear those heels. No need to walk a few blocks to eat here!", "author": "Hazel C."}

I feel that is setting the bar a bit high but this place does make it a good debate. All the food was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Simple menu but it is executed perfectly. You also get a great vibe once your inside. The outside as noted in other reviews can be intimidating but once you step through the doors the mood is nothing less than inviting. The chef Kevin checks on all the tables personally so plus points for quality control.\n\nBlackened Catfish: Delicious. Comes with collard greens and cous cous\nMac & Cheese: Freshly made and brought right to the table. Give it a minute or risk a burned tongue. Excellent amount of cheesiness..hmmm is that a word? \nPeanut Butter Stew: Works on alot of different levels. Can be a meal or added as a side.\nBayview Babyback ribs: no utensils required. You can pull the meat off with your fingers; enough said. \n\nThis is going to be tough but try to save room for dessert. The rice pudding is a great refresher and I'm saving the fifth star as a formality for after my next couple of visits which will be very soon...", "author": "Norris T."}

I finally got the chance to dine at OSC and was very, very pleased that their concept is positive for young adults and is successfully shown in their service.  In addition to the service being great, the food is spectacular!!!! We ordered Fried Okra for an appetizer...was very tasty.  Coating was on point and cuts were pretty uniform (considering the size of okra), also NOT over greasy.  The hot sauce on the side was a good complement. For main courses, we ordered the Fried Chicken and Beef Ribs....awesome, awesome....quality and taste is right on up there with Brenda's Soul Food.  Greens were NOT over cooked, the mashed potatoes were flavored well and smooth.  Fried chicken was also coated well and cooked well.  For dessert, we ordered the Sweet Potato Tart and the Apple Bread Pudding with Cinnamon Gelato and caramel sauce were all amazing. All had great flavor and was balanced...not too sweet and definitely NOT bland.  My husband asked several of the young adults about how they came to be involved with OSC and if they have been affected by the Prison Industrial Complex and sadly this has affected many.  We learned those in the program are paid and learn about back-of-house and front--of-house tasks; from prepping food, waiting tables, hosting, and bussing tables.  While the location can be a bit intimidating, we learned the parking lot is monitored to ensure only their guests are parked there.  I urge ANY AND EVERYONE to visit OSC and support their cause or atleast maje a donation to them. It's a refreshing concept that they are offering to young adults.  I look forward to returning on a night when they have live entertainment.", "author": "Dei C."}

A lot of the other reviews have mentioned the scariness of the neighborhood and I have to agree with them. I parked on Oakdale right nearby and the car parked next to me had 2 of their windows shattered. I figured the vandal probably came and went but I still made sure to hide anything within view and of value in my car like any good San Franciscan.\n\nWe made reservations through the Yelp app on a Thursday evening and we were one of 2 groups eating. There's space to host at least 50 people. The musician of the day was playing the piano and he went non-stop for a good 30 minutes probably. Good stuff! The server/host was attentive and welcoming. We were treated to a yummy fried sweet potato dish to whet our appetite. \n\nStarted out with the Taumoepeau Oka. It looks like a small like appetizer, but for 2 people it actually packs quite a lot of food. They noticed that we were running low on the homemade tortilla chips and got an extra helping to finish off our swai. \n\nI ordered the fried chicken and my girl got the Shrimp and Grits. Both packed good flavor and juiciness...although I think the fried chicken is a bit overpriced IMO. We finished off the night with a lavender cheesecake which actually tasted like lavender with the right amount of sweet and cheesiness. \n\nOverall, I believe in the mission of OSC and really hope they continue to do well and invest in at-risk youth. Although I wish the neighborhood was a little less sketch, I still will try venturing out there every so often. BTW, they also cater events and weddings...which is something I may consider having them do.", "author": "Sam L."}

The live Jazz musicians playing front and center complete the scene. \n\nThe service here is impeccable, everyone is attentive and available to help. It wasn't the decor, the food, or the cause that impressed me the most but rather  when Chef Kevin came out with my plate and introduced himself and talked about their purpose. That is attention to detail! I don't know if he does that at every table, but I sure felt special that he came to mine. Maybe he just wanted to know what party of two was ordering all that food. \n\nAs soon as you sit down the staff brings a plate of four mini pieces of sweet cornbread. The Frenchman ate them so fast, I didn't have time to take a photo. They were so fluffy and light (no Jiff here folks), topped with a small drizzle of honey on top.  Truth be told, I was here to see what sort of food game this place had - was the food truly southern? With this in mind I ordered the Fried Chicken, The Gumbo and the Spicy Greens.\n\nThose greens!!! I pretty much ate them all on my own. The chef prepares them in smoked turkey necks, so for all us southerners who know about that back fat and ham-hocks..none of that in these here and they were still amazing! Juicy, spicy, not overly vinegary or salted. They were beyond exceptional!  \n\nThe Gumbo had an aroma that led me to believe the roux was made with love. Indeed it was; spicy, not too watery or thick mixing well with the rice, crab and sausage. The shrimp were saut\u00e9ed in butter beforehand and complemented the flavor altogether. There was no ocra thank goodness. It wasn't my Mamon Rieux's gumbo, but it was probably the best I have had in California. Ya'll westerners need some practice. \n\nAnyway, the Fried Chicken was satisfying as well. Juicy, juicy, juicy. There is nothing worse then some dried fried chicken! Well done Chef Kevin, that little bird was seasoned and saucy. I wasn't so much a fan of the mashed potatoes and cole slaw. But I'm a little funny about cole slaw - I only like Popeye's LOL!!\n\nSeriously folks, take a taxi, Lyft or Uber, or even the Muni to this eatery. The muni stops right in front, so you have no excuse. The basis behind their establishment is comendable.

I have first heard about it from Check Please, one of our fav local food shows then it came up among friends who live out in the Bayview. Old Skool cafe is a concept resturant that take youth and trains them to work all the roles in the food service industry while at the same time putting out some pretty great food. \nThe resturant itself on the outside doesn't look like much - but once you walk in, you get a very jazz meets speakeasy feel. The staff is friendly and eager to practice freshly learned skills - but we didn't find it pushy or amateur.\n\nWe were seated quickly and while looking over the menu they left us with some sweet potato biscuits which are not to be missed. We ended up ordering another order with our meal.\n\nNot knowing how the food was we decided to order creatively to get a nice sampling. For our starters we went with a black-eye pea salad ($7) - this southern style salsa had great textures and tasted nice - but lacked a bit of zig and was a little dry. I think it might have needed an acid to the dressing or more dressing mixed (maybe stirred more) before serving. A squirt of lemon on it for me freshened it up nicely - so I am leaning towards a simple oversight to mix the salad before plating. \n\nWe also opted for Abu's Peanut Butter Stew (8$, 14$). We decided to get a cup sized order as a second app - served over rice with chicken - this was magic. I might have to say this is one of those \"sex\" foods you hear people talk about - it have all the right curves - taste, texture, aroma and pop! As is one of the two favorite dishes from the night.\n\nFor our entrees we went with the Jordans fried chicken dinner (24$) and pan seared smokey shrimp and cheesy grits (16$). The fried chicken was hot, crisp and moist inside. So good that we eyed the two large pieces thinking maybe take home one for lunch the next day - umm - no! They deserved to be eaten now. Oh and when I mean hot - I mean \"fresh from the oil\" hot. The chicken comes with a few sides of mashed potatoes, slaw and gravy .\n\nOn a side note -all three of these were underwhelming. The mashed potato were barely warm so was a contrast wight he chicken in a way that didn't work, The slaw has nice texture - but was bland. It needed more zip to it, felt like was mayo and cabbage than anything else. The dipping sauce  - I didn't get. It was very loose and white but didn't really have any flavor. it also come cool so wasn't sure it was supposed to be a \"gravy\" or something - but we essentially ignored it. \n\nFor for my option - I went with those smokey grits and shrimp -- I could have slathered it on me it was so good. Again as the primary point of focus - I enjoyed every bite. I can see eating that again for sure. The shrimp have a spicy rub on them that has some kick - so may not be to everyone's liking. I liked it - but I could be as happy eating it with a simple smokey grilled shrimp too  along side those wonderful grits.", "author": "Frank S."}

When traveling Grandma offered to watch the kids and shoo us out for a night, I immediately knew I wanted to come here.\n\nThe dining space fits the jazz supper club theme, and is very cool and intimate.  The server greeted us and offered up some complimentary sweet potato biscuits, which were glazed and delicious.  I settled in for a fun dining experience.  Unfortunately from that point on, the rest of the dinner was a bit of a disappointment.  The fried chicken was juicy on the inside but burnt on the outside.  The ribs were large in portion, but lacked flavor - it was more like eating stewed pork.  The service was slow - we had to flag servers down to order, to get refills, to get our check...something we didn't feel like we needed to do considering there were only a handful of tables being served.  I know they are young and in training, but we've been to other similar dining concepts (Delancey, Worth Our Weight, etc) and always found the service to be on point and overly friendly.  We didn't get that here...instead, it seemed like they were too busy socializing with each other rather than tending to tables.\n\nIf the food and service matched the great atmosphere, the fact that it is located in a sketchy neighborhood would be an added bonus to the dining experience (a hidden gem in the rough), but with a disappointing meal the fact that we had to question if our car would still be there when we left just made it seem like more of a wasted trip.  The two stars is really for the ambiance and mission.  There wasn't any live entertainment when we went, so maybe that would have boosted it up another star.  I don't know....unfortunately I don't think I'd come back to find out.", "author": "Christina F."}

I'm not exactly sure where I parked, but it was fairly close by. Parking was free (or metered, but we went at a late hour).\n\nDuring this late hour on Friday night, the restaurant was fairly empty. There was a small group, but other than that, I think it might have been just us in the front room. There is more seating in the back.\n\nThe restaurant has dim lighting, and had some pretty old school decorations. We were served, but for the most part were left alone. \n\nWe ordered:\nOld Skool Ceviche - I enjoyed this. My roommate thought it was a bit bland, but I thought it was perfect the way it was. Maybe a hint of salt would have enhanced the flavours just a bit, but it's better than it being over salted. We ran out of chips and asked for more. There was no extra charge.\n\nPan Seared Shrimp 'n Smoky Cheese Grits - My roommate ordered this, I didn't really read the menu. Good choice. Those pieces of shrimp were so divine. They are perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked. I have no other words to describe how amazing they were. The grits balanced the shrimp flavours very nicely. Looking at the menu on their website right now. The description says it's award winning, and I believe it.\n\nBlackened Catfish - served with couscous and spicy greens. Compared to the shrimp and grits, this dish was just okay. The fish was tender, and well seasoned, but honestly I wouldn't have mind skipping this dish for another shrimp and grits. This wasn't a bad dish, it just happened to get caught in the shadow.\n\nThere is a free soda check-in offer from yelp. The mood was set nicely with two live female singers. It wasn't the best singing I've heard, but it was pleasant enough.\n\nI have a tendency to leave my credit card at places after I paid for my meals or drinks. I just sign and leave my card... so I ended up doing that here too. I left a message and contacted them through their website. It ended up taking a few business days for them to get back to me. Despite their opening hours being only in the evening, the office hours are open during the day. I believe I met with Chef Kevin, who was such a genuinely nice guy. He shook my hand and thanked me for coming in and asked if my experience was good. It was. \n\nI highly recommend this place for dinner, and I really hope I'll find time to make it back for that shrimp.", "author": "Kaje Y."}

The fried chicken, greens and gumbo are all fresh, properly seasoned and nicely presented. The ambiance is New Orleans style, with cozy and intimate seating areas where you also have a good view for people-watching. I love that this is a non-profit, training youth in all aspects of running a restaurant. The only thing that keeps them from 5-stars is that the servers are....well...in training. So you may not get quite the type of service that you'd expect, given the caliber of the place, however they are all sincere, attentive and trying hard to get it right.\n\nLast time we were there (a Friday night in August) there was a young man named Jeremy Sullivan performing solo guitar and singing, mostly what seemed to be his original songs. His style was sort of jazzy, bluesy, folksy. Very beautiful sound. He was really mesmerizing and so talented. Catch him there if you can.

At-risk youth provided with career opportunities! What's not to love. \n\nThey start off with some complimentary sweet potato biscuits, which were pretty unique. They could have been served a bit warmer, but they were still pretty good. There was a hint of sweetness to them, and they were definitely a bit orange from the sweet potato. \n\nIf you want to try a non-alcoholic drink here, definitely go with the mint lemonade (tip: free drink with Yelp check-in)! There's a strong flavor of mint leaves infused in the lemonade, and it's not too sour nor too sweet. Really refreshing drink. \n\nThe peanut butter stew really reminds me of a Thai curry. Yes, peanut flavor really does go with curry! Kind of like the curry peanut sauce that goes on satay skewers. It was delish! \n\nThe brussels sprout and kale salad was not bad, but somehow didn't live up to my expectations of crispy brussels and well-seasoned kale. Maybe I've been spoiled by Darwin Cafe in South Park. I really shouldn't compare like that though. \n\nThe fried chicken had quite a different flavor on the outside -- the spice rub had an interesting barbecue flavor, reminiscent of bbq chips, but there was no visible bbq powder. Whatever they did to make the rub was brilliant. The chicken meat itself could probably use more brining to add more salt and flavor. \n\nThe lavender cheesecake with strawberry was a great way to round out the meal. The cheesecake was not too heavy and not too light. Just the perfect rectangle size. \n\nDefinitely one of the highlights of the Bay View / Hunter's Point neighborhood.

I just adore this cafe. \n\nBut what really sold me on this place is the food. I got to sample their peanut butter stew from a yelp event a couple of months back and I loved it so much that I knew I had to come here to experience the full restaurant. It's located in Bayview which a part of SF i don't usually hang around in so it's a little bit of drive. \n\nThe servers here are all so friendly. Their service for the most part was great, our server did keep on forgetting our drinks but his chipper attitude made up for it. The restaurant is fond of doing shout outs which I thought was neat, a great way to embarrass someone you know if its their birthday ;) They also have a live pianist which was cool but sometimes it can get a little loud. Our group came here for the Dine SF week so we all got various things and sampled all of them.\n\n******** FOOD *********\n\nPeanut Butter Stew: I LOVE THIS. Very reminiscent to a curry but you can definitely taste the peanut butter. It's a little too salty but still delicious. Worth trying when you're here :) It is just a bowl of savory goodness.\n\nGumbo: Tasty and spicy. It has a kick to it and it doesn't hit you until the end. The sausages are pretty spicy but full of flavor. The dish is pretty filling. \n\nRibs: GET THEIR RIBS. So tender that it slides off the bone with a light tug from your fork. The sauce was also to die for. I normally don't like bbq but this one was too good to resist. It's also pretty big in size too so worth the $$.\n\nPork Chops: The pork chops were also tender, and crisp! I did kind of wish there was sauce on this so I ended up dipping it in the peanut butter stew which was delightful.\n\nWe also ordered various appetizers and the I thought the Ota was both unique and the best. Not something you can in most places, it's like a creamy dip with fish chunks in it served with chips. It's sooo good! \n\nOverall the food was great for the quality, quantity, and price!

The is a place you want to frequent for its \"why\". But what about the food? Most of the dishes are very good.  Some are average. Nothing is bad or below average. So why go out of your way? Because the way they are forever changing the lives of kids ages 16-22.  Last night they celebrated 3 of their kids/employees who had achieved major milestones in their life. One graduated with a 4.0 after nearly failing. Another was accepted into culinary school. We, the patrons, shared with them that night in the joy of changed lives. So is it perfect, no way. Is it right, you bet. I encourage you to make the trip and support this place where you go to be part of something bigger than yourself.", "author": "Chadwick H."}

At that event, OSC served samples of its peanut butter stew, and it was soooooo good. I thought OSC had the best food at the event (it also had the longest lines because I'm assuming everyone else enjoyed the stew too!). Ever since that night, I've been trying to find opportunities to eat here... and I finally came last night!\n\nMy friend and I made reservations for 6pm, and we got seated immediately (the place wasn't busy yet. It started filling up near the end of our dinner ~7pm). I ordered a bowl of the peanut butter stew, and it was as tasty as I remembered it. The taste of the peanut butter isn't overwhelming or strong which I appreciate. It filled me up, so I didn't have space for dessert, but I'll be coming back so I try more food here soon! Other notes:\n- Jazz musicians were talented. Volume was perfect (I didn't have to talk extra loud to chat with my friend).\n- Service was great; our waiter was so kind and respectful. \n- As other Yelpers mentioned, this place isn't located in the safest neighborhood, so don't leave valuables visible in your car!\n\nOSC and its mission is awesome, and I will highly recommend this place and its peanut butter stew to all my friends!", "author": "Annie S."}

Old Skool Cafe kinda is.\n\nHere's why I say \"kinda\":\n\nSWEET POTATO BISCUITS $0: Needed to be actual biscuit size and needed to be on the menu so I could order a heap more. Browned bottom. They layered off like a right biscuit should (2 or 3, not completely like Hungry Jack). Enlarged, they may get even more joyful.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=qozmZ3QG8vkPIUVKq9odlg\n\nSWEET TEA $3: Wasn't black tea. Was like a peach tea or sweetened with something other than plain sugar. I'm passing on this in the future. Free refills though - they got that right.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=42gtOZ15Gn8kpGMKh3x_Ig\n\nPAN SEARED SHRIMP N SMOKY CHEESE GRITS $11: I'm still waiting for a place to let grits be grits, without cheese. That aside, I needed more grit and less smoothness / creaminess. It did form a skin on top, though, which I appreciated.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=A3qam0bvxG_OuWthyoMFtQ\n\nOPENERS (appetizers): No cornbread. No hushpuppies. Honestly, I think they could ditch the first 3 items of this part of the menu in exchange for even one of hushpuppies or cornbread and result in more Southern-ness.\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=AAkh4_2pmg06-aAFiV2gQQ\n\nThe rest wasn't bad but wasn't especially remarkable.\n\nROASTED GARLIC AND SAGE MASHED POTATOES $6\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=3Pc7zMkmrnSDjroJ9EjCIw\nMY GUMBO (DANIEL'S GUMBO) $7 cup, $12 bowl\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=1yeWYnoPaXSltR6_chXi-A\nABU'S WEST AFRICAN PEANUT BUTTER STEW $6 cup, $10 bowl\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=4HsHgMuF6zsyha8Yo4gCyQ\nSOMEONE'S GRANDMAMA'S FRIED CHICKEN WINGS $8\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2oj_6uCp4DgVTJhYqEmBbA?select=X7h1WnxnRbT6jUu0ObcmSQ\n\nLIVE MUSIC: At times too loud and overpowering of the dining x chatting experience. Otherwise swank and classy. I felt like there was one Top 40 song they did 2 or 3 times that I got tired of. I did like the birthday songs, one from the mic singer then the Stevie Wonder refrain from a dude who ran out of the kitchen. Then one or two people from the birthday party got on the mic and sang other stuff, notably the first verse of \"Amazing Grace\".\n\nSERVICE: Polite and patient the whole way through. At one point, a server gave a short testimonial on the mic about his background and how he's on a better path thanks to this restaurant's program of uplifting troubled youth.\n\nSTARS: Including the wondrous changes this place makes in the lives of its staff, I can't fathom giving less than 4 stars. I thank and believe in all of you.\n\nFYI: Ask about the specials for different courses because there are good things that aren't on the menu. Also, they're in the midst of applying for an alcohol license. Get ready.", "author": "Dan B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-02-09", "description": "Posted in the Elite Event, and shall do another here! Old Skool is THAT good.\n\nIt's embarrassing how badly I've been wanting to try this place...and did not have an opportunity to come. Just life getting in the way and lack of planning on my part. Finally, when Yelp decided to have an event here that was ALSO on a free night for me, I was in!\n\nThe reason I've been intrigued at this place is not because of the great food (which I PROMISE I WILL GET TO LATER). It's because of what I've read of the amazing work they do with at-risk youth. In a former life, I worked with disadvantaged young people. Though my youth did not have experience in the Juvenile Justice system (yet for some...smh), I know how difficult it is to work with young people in general. Adding the fact that these are youth who did something stupid and had the unfortunate luck to get caught...it makes to so much harder to empower these young people. Hearing an average success rate for youth in the program was about 50%, it's pretty good. Yes, 50% would fail you in school. But 1 in 2 youth being able to turn their life around is nothing to scoff at.\n\nThe youth there were awesome. Romaine (Spelling is probably totally off) was great at the front door, greeting people on their way in. Carlos made an amazing presentation to everyone, and really showed off what Old Skool Cafe is trying to achieve. All of the waiters and waitresses were amazing, but Serena NOT Williams was a favorite of mine. Just because she was also inclined to chat with people while bringing around bites of delicious foods. Speaking of...FOOD....\n\nSweet Potato Biscuits with Honey Butter: I was a bit hesitant when these came around, but since they were the first bite and I was hungry...yeah, I partook in one. And wow. Yum! It got all the sweetness needed from the sweet potato, but wasn't overly dessert-like. It really grew on me (and my friend) and we were more than eager to take a 2nd biscuit when it came around.\n\nTaumoepean Ota: No idea what the young person was saying when first introducing this. We just saw a creamy ceviche-style food on a crisp tortilla and grabbed one. Evidently its Tongan, which makes sense that they know how to make a decent one. Though not Southern in style, it's a great reflection of the community in Bayview. A lot of Pacific Islanders are here, and this thing was delicious. Like, delicious.\n\nOld Skool Ceviche: After the Taumoepean Ota, this one paled in comparison. It was still good, but the fish couldn't stand up to the strong flavors of all the other ingredients. I realize tilapia doesn't have much flavor. It was still a great bite. On the same house-made tortillas. DELICIOUS. I'd like a bag of those tortillas to go please!\n\nBayview Baby Back Ribs: Slow cooked and delicious. I totally didn't mind getting my fingers dirty, and was pleased that most of the people I sat with also didn't mind. The ribs were moist, but soft. It totally felt like it was smoked for hours.\n\nJordan's Fried Chicken: Was good, but I'm not so sure about that size. It was perfect for the venue - chicken wings and drumettes - but I'd like to see how they do chicken breast and thigh pieces now. These pieces had great flavor.\n\nSpicy Collared Greens: I love collareds. So. Good. These had a kick of spice, which made it all the more delicious, and was SO good. I could have had a plate of these alone. When I saw people weren't really taking them as quickly (seriously), I helped myself to second...and third helpings.\n\nMac and Cheese: Weirdly, I'm not a big Mac and Cheese fan. These were pretty good, but I think it took a little bit of time to come out so some of the cheese was starting to harden. But...it DID come out after the wonderful presentation, so I don't mind.\n\nAbu's West African Peanut Butter Stew: My friend saw \"peanut butter\" and was disinclined to like it. The chicken was a bit dry, but the taste worked for me. Think Thai curry, and its got about that same texture/flavor.\n\nDaniel's Gumbo: I needed some rice to go with this. The pieces I ate were super flavorful, but It was SUPER FLAVORFUL. Needed some rice to balance the taste.\n\nPan Seared Shrimp 'n' Smokey Cheese Grits: Probably among the best grits I've had in a while. The first time I had grits, it was this gooey mess of stuff that didn't make me like it, so I've been weary of it since. This one was probably some of the best grits I've had, and the shrimp on top was quite well cooked.\n\nMini Sweet Potato Tarts: I could have had a dozen of these suckers. Really. good. Seems like anything they have with sweet potato is delicious...I'll have to return and confirm this assumption.\n\nService was spectacular. The youth were totally on their game and were stellar. At the end, they were particularly good at hustling for return customers. I promise, Serena NOT Williams. I will return and ask for you!", "author": "Lily W."}

The location itself is questionable, I won't lie. It's in Hunter's Point and can be scary leaving your car (if you're driving). But once you get inside, you are transported to a whole new world. Old Skool Cafe (OSC) has nice decor and reminds me of the 40s a bit. Even the bathrooms are decorated with the theme. \nNow the main review: food. DELICIOUS! Since we had a large party, we put in our orders a few days in advance so the kitchen wouldn't be backed up. We started with wings & calamari. Wings came 5 per order and had great flavor. The calamari was ok-nothing memorable. For the main course it had the shrimp & grits and i was so happy. The flavors went perfectly together and the grits were not bland. The chorizo added a great texture profile and flavor. Got a side order of Mac n cheese and it was cheesy/garlicky goodness. Tried a bite of the friend chicken and it was perfectly cooked. For me, the peanut butter stew left something to be desired.\nI do wish OSC was open on weekend lunch as it would be a bit safer to travel and offer more reasonable priced bottles of wine. \nWhile there on a Sat night, there was a pianist and even some live singing which added to the experience.

I just sat there and soaked up the neighborhood's goodness, with high school kids and their ridiculously low pants, strutting around trying to get random girls' numbers, yelling obscenities one second and giving each other friendly socks to the arm the next. \n\nSo, Old Skool, yes. We were seated immediately and brought over some still-warm sweet potato biscuits drenched in honey butter. I mean, already this is good. The calamari starter, though tiny, was perfectly seasoned and enough to whet four people's appetites.\n\nI heard no complaints about the gumbo, the fried chicken, or the catfish. My half rack of ribs with a ramekin of coleslaw and just enough to make me wish I had on my stretchy pants.\n\nNeedless to say, we skipped dessert.\n\nMy favorite part: Chef Kevin coming out of the kitchen to make sure we were all set and enjoying our food. Truly genuine and all-around nice guy.\n\nMy least favorite part: we were seated beside the piano, and though it was a nice touch, it was FAR too loud to hear any conversation.

My husband found out about this place awhile ago and has been trying to take me, but I wasn't able to take him up on it until pretty recently. Now I'm trying to figure out how soon we can get back there.\n\nThe outside appearance of this place may be a bit unsettling because it's in a bit of a bad neighborhood, but there's plenty of safe parking in front, and once you get inside everything is fantastic.\n\nThe whole place is designed to look like a 1920's jazz club. There's even a big diorama on the 2nd floor balcony which is made to look like a dressing room. Many of the waiters dress in period garb, and as a general fan of costuming I must admit I was a little envious of some of the accessories. \n\nThe menu is very eclectic, but surprisingly good given the variety. The kale and Brussels sprout salad is fantastic, as is the peanut butter soup. The latter tastes a lot like Thai curry, although it's a bit more mild (which I like). \n\nThe best thing about this place, though, is that it's a charity. Everyone working there (except for the owner) used to be an at-risk youth in the local area. In addition to providing delicious food and a cozy atmosphere for its customers, the Old Skool Cafe also provides employment, training, counseling, and therapy for its employees.

The volume and music were just right to enhance the dining experience, not overwhelm it. Everyone in the full restaurant applauded loudly after every number.\n\nDon't be intimidated by Old Skool's out of the way location -- try it!", "author": "Lisa S."}

Because we were a large group, we had to order from one of their fixed menus--we ordered family style. Our meal came with sweet potato biscuits (tiny, but moist and sweet), kale and brussels sprout salad (savory), ceviche (fresh and delicious), fried chicken wings (crispy and juicy), macaroni and cheese (not too cheesy), peanut butter stew, and then a selection of mini desserts. We also ordered a rack of ribs (tender and flavorful). \n\nService was good, live music was nice, ambiance was intimate, they accommodated our bottomless biscuit request, and we happened to visit the same evening as New York mayor Bill de Blasio and his wife Chirlane (they came to greet us and we posed for pictures). \n\nA very special first visit indeed.

As some one who actively does community service/volunteer work i know how important helping the community. There was something special about this place aside from the food. Old Skool cafe helps at risk youths that have been to jail/juvenile and puts them to work in the restaurant business to gain experience and keep the out of trouble. We need more places like this in the city. \n\nOn to the review - \n\nConsidering that this place is in the heart of the ghetto (3rd street) when you walk inside it was a different environment. They had an \"old school\" theme all laced up in black and red. They really sold the them. The place is kinda small. only probably 50 people can be served max. \n\nOur server was Marcus, super nice and genuially  helpful. I would not have think that he came from a troubled past. Since its tapas style restaurant we ordered - grits, bbq ribs, mac n cheese, blackened fish, fried chicken, and gumbo. \n\nMy personal fav were the MAC N CHEESE and the SHRIMP AND GRITS. All had creamy consistency and had a home made taste to it. Everything is mostly under $10 and good tapas portion size. \n\nThis place went beyond my expectation! I highly recommend this place. \n\nQuick tip - This place is only open for 4 hours a night and open 3 days a week! Make a reservation online!", "author": "Ryan R."}

It was so rich and creamy; a regular party in your mouth.  It was sooooooo good.  The kale-sprouts salad was nice & tangy.  The pulled pork very tender & the gumbo flavorful.  Even the shrimp in the gumbo which can get overdone at times, was tender & perfectly infused with flavor.  Dessert was the lavender cheesecake.  While decent, it did not measure up to the wonderfulness of the rest of the food ordered.\n\nWhat could use improvement was the drinks.  The strawberry-rhubarb soda surprisingly was bland.

We were able to get a last minute reservation on Saturday evening. The ambiance was so warm and welcoming. The lightening is dim and the restaurant is run by the youth. In addition to the friendly staff, they also had a live music performance. The trio (I can't recall their name) performing was amazing...truly talented group. \n\nFor the most part the food was good. We enjoyed the biscuits. My sister had the pulled pork over cornbread, which was good. I had the gumbo and wanted to love it, but didn't hence the 4 star review instead of 5. Having been to New Orleans several times and reading the yelp reviews for this restaurant's gumbo, I was underwhelmed with the gumbo.

Goddamn these were like crack. It looked like a small cone but it came with ALOT! SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO good.\n\nShrimp & grits: Pretty damn good - they do it right!. The grits looked plain but was packed with cheesy flavor but yet not too heavy. It was on the smooth side - I wish it was chunkier!\n\nRibs: Again - executed right. Often times, ribs can be dried out, but not here! I wasn't as big of a fan as the coleslaw it came with since I like it with more mayo- this was more on the very lightly dressed side.\n\nGumbo: I think this was my 2nd fav of the night!

Made reservations and we were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in.  I didn't do my research but there was live music which was a wonderful experience to listen to while dining.\n\nOn to the food:\nAppetizers\n-complimentary sweet potato biscuits: I didn't care for these, it was basically flavorless carbs\n-sweet potato fries: these were delicious as they are sprinkled with brown sugar and the chipotle/ranch dipping sauces provided helped make this a great appetizer\n-Chicken drumlettes: Considered the fried chicken but rather have a small sample of their chicken to share with the group of people I went with.  These were disappointing as though they were cooked well, they lacked flavor.  I wouldn't order these again\n\nEntrees\n-Catfish\n-Half Rack Ribs: the last half rack available of the night, this was pretty good, tender meat and nice sauce to accompany the ribs\n-Gumbo: I liked this dish, it has that nice homey feel to it and includes crab, shrimp, sausages and that nice sauce to blend together with the rice for a great dish\n-Shrimp & Gritz: we all agreed that this dish was the perfect amount of cheesy.  I personally prefer Brenda's crawfish and gritz but this dish was a highlight.\n-Catfish: dry rub of fish that was cooked well.  There was spicy sides with it and some couscous.  It was alright but not something I would suggest\nSides\nMac & Cheese + bacon and onions: They provide a lot of cheese bacon and onions that made this dish great.  I would definitely order this again.  For a side dish, it was pretty large and since it is macaroni and cheese, it can be quite filling as well.\n\nDessert:\nLavender Cheesecake: This was tasty, the lavender was a bit overpowering but overall it was an okay dessert.\n\nThe decor of this place is very Old Skool and it shows with the lighting, the live music, the way the workers are dressed.  We got to meet the owner and even the chef came by to talk with us for a bit.  We got to watch and listen to the talented performers entertaining us throughout the meal.

My favorite thing about this place is that it's student-ran to give them an opportunity in restaurant business. I love the atmosphere, it is very welcoming and it has an old-school vibe to it. They have someone on the piano playing modern music like Halo by Beyonce! The chef who teaches all the students how to prepare, make, and serve the dishes came out to greet my party of 3 and ask us for our opinions too, which I thought was super cute. We sat by the window where they had really soft decor/pillows where we sat - which is a nice home-y touch.\n\nAs for the food, it could be improved. I felt that a lot of the dishes were a bit on the saltier end. My favorite dish would have to be the honey-buttered biscuits! DEEE-LICIOUS! Their menu wasn't big, so we got to try a lot of the items :) They also serve wine and beer here, so I had myself the Speakeasy Big Daddy beer. Time to go down the list:\n- Drumettes: A little dry in the center, but tasty skin - the dip made it much better.\n- Peanut & coconut soup: I had to get this because I fell in love with it at a Yelp Elite event, but this time around it was a little too salty for me. I did however like the strong coconut flavor and the rice helped the saltiness.\n- Gumbo: On the saltier end as well, and had a spicy kick to it which was nice, but could use less salt. The shrimp also didn't taste very fresh because it has that sea-like taste.\n- Spinach Salad: the dressing on this was different, and I don't think i like it. I also don't like goat cheese so I didn't like it overall. I had to take off everything to eat the spinach alone.\n- Half rack of ribs: I believe this dish was my brother and sister's favorite. I don't care much for ribs but it wasn't anything exceptional, but not bad.\n- Shrimp Smokey Grits: I tasted goat cheese in this as well, so that ruined it for me. I had to dig out all the shrimp to eat the dish, and again the shrimp didn't taste too fresh here.\n- Mac & Cheese: Typical, but probably one of my more-liked dishes from the place.\n- Collard Greens: It was also on the saltier side, but the softness of the collard greens were good.\n\nMy brother got his complimentary panna cotta dessert, which was also delicious, for his birthday.

The woman is clearly upset and balling her eyes out at the dinner table.\n\nAWKWARD! \n\nLeave your relationship problems at home please.\n\nExcept I was THAT woman...balling  my eyes out at the dinner table. Not because Mr. NSS and I were fighting but because I had an epiphany of how I blessed I am. I didn't grow up in poverty. I didn't grow up in a home with domestic violence (I had a dad that lined the corners of the house with diapers so I wouldn't fall and hurt myself). I've never been locked up (though my friends think I will one day for public indecency). \n\nI sat there with my eyeliner running down by face and my whore lashes falling off like I had just did the walk of shame as our waiter, Dominic gave a short speech. He stood up in front of all the Old Skool Caf\u00e9 patrons and told us about how he grew up in a home with domestic violence and has been in out of jail since he was 12 years old. Just when he thought he would never be able to find a job with a criminal record, Old Skool Caf\u00e9 took him in, and taught him (and other at-risk youths) how to cook, how to bus tables, and most importantly, is giving him marketable skills to pursue a future career in the restaurant industry.\n\nFor this, I would like to dedicate my 1000th review to OId Skool Caf\u00e9, a supperclub dedicated to helping at-risk youths make a positive transition in their lives\n \nNestled inside a small street in Bayview-Hunter's Point, Old Skool Caf\u00e9 is a converted abandoned church turned supperclub. Upon walking in, you will be amazed that this gem is located in this part of San Francisco. The sultry burgundy walls, vintage golden chandeliers, youths dressed in formal red and black jazz attire with suspenders, and live music by talented singers make this a perfect date place for a romantic dinner. Fellas, this is a perfect *panty dropping* date place. Once she hears the story behind the supperclub, she'll melt and be amazed that you took the time to research and pick a place with such a worthy cause. TRUST ME.\n\nOld Skool Caf\u00e9 serves soul food tapas style. They recommend 3-4 dishes per a person which can add up. Wine by the glass was $8-$12. Dinner for two is about $100 (including gratuity). Not exactly the cheapest but it's for a good cause and great way to give back to the community.\n\nF O O D\nDating a human garbage disposal, we ordered 5 dishes plus dessert. I wasn't very hungry but it was just enough for the both of us. Given these youths have no formal culinary training; the food served was very impressive. The extent of Mr. NSS cooking is microwaving Egg Beaters and he's 32 so I give these kids props. \n\nThe absolute favs of the night were the Shrimp & Grits - $12 (http://bit.ly/12KUVfv), the West African Peanut Butter Stew - $12 (http://bit.ly/W1WbFl), and Baby Back Ribs - $11 (http://bit.ly/Y7PWBf). The shrimp was plumply tender and sweet while the cheesy grits were smooth yet had a chunky bite to them. Loved the bits of chorizo for an added richness.  The peanut stew was like a peanut butter curry. Richly thick, the peanut butter stew had tender chunks of chicken and a scoop of white rice to mellow out the robust flavors. The baby back ribs were fall of the bone tender and nicely lacquered with a tangy smoky bbq sauce with a touch of sweetness. The Gumbo - $12 ((http://bit.ly/VreNh2) could have benefited from more seasoning and more roux for a thicker consistency while the Calamari - $9 ((http://bit.ly/TlYVCv) could have used more batter and less time in the fryer as it was a bit dry and overcooked. We ended dinner with the Panna Cotta - $7 (http://bit.ly/TlZUlW) since they were out of the Sweet Potato Pie which was deliciously custardy but the balsamic reduction was a tiny bit too pungent. \n\nS E R V I C E\nFriendly, attentive, and professional, these young servers will surely be ready for to hit San Francisco's finest restaurants in the future. Food service was pretty timely given it started getting crowded as the weekend night progressed.\n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nPanty Dropper.\n\nP A R K I N G\nPlenty of street parking around the corner on Oakdale. The T-line is just steps away though I would recommend driving or taking the taxi.\n\nThe food and the service at Old Skool Cafe far exceeded by expectations given the youths had no formal training.  Although it wasn't perfect, it's better than anything I could ever produce in the kitchen (even as an adult) without burning down the house or being sent to the ER after dropping a tray of plates on my foot.  \n\nMad props to Old Skool Caf\u00e9  for this and helping at-risk youths completely turn their lives around for the better.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

What?!\n\nNot to mention the amazing social aspect - Old Skool is staffed by at risk youth and people who have had a rough time in life, and it's located in one of the rougher neighborhoods in SF. To see a real community trying to lift up it's own is inspiring (and yes, I did feel great about contributing to the cause).\n\nLast but not least, the food is bomb diggity.

We walked in and they seated us to wherever we would like to sit. \n\nWhat to get? \n\nGrilled Shrimp and Smokey Grits: 6 pieces of shrimp and HELLLA GRITs, its bomb though, i usually don't eat that much carbs but for this, i ate everything and licked the plate. Its on point. \n\nMash Potato: Alright their sides are on point you gotta get a side even if you are too full, once you see it, i promise you booboo you'll want to eat again. \n\nCHICKEN, the chicken item on the menu: they give out a LOT OF CHICKEN hahaha its so good and whats best my girlfriend couldn't finish it so more food for me!\n\nAll in all, come here to eat, I like the idea of helping those at risk youth and i wish the neighborhood was less sketch, the food and the people made it up for me!", "author": "Jason Ping T."}

First of all, there is free parking right in front. What the... in SF? Usually we are trying to find parking for half an hour when we go eat out there. \nWe go in with our reservation and the place was pretty empty, probably since it was only around 6pm. There was a singer with a guitar the whole time - awesome! How often do you get live music with dinner?\nWhen the waiter came and explained the whole concept that they are at-risk youth, I was tearing up. I felt so honored to be there and to be a part of it. \n\nThe best part was the food - the BOMB! Fall off the bone ribs. Gumbo was like the best I've ever had, the soupy sauce hit the spot right on. Peanut butter stew was interesting and something unique, but our least favorite one. Then there's Mac and cheese with bacon! Need I say more?\nWe were so full we couldn't even try desserts. \n\nI also loved that they went up to the mic and explained the restaurant and our server told his story. Then at the end, a woman came to us and said she was a manager and asked us how everything was and made sure we were good. \nThis was seriously a magical and blessed place that I will definitely be going back to, and have to try some of the desserts.", "author": "Hungry G."}

We were presently greeted by the hostess and chef for our 7:30pm reservation.  We arrived early but were seated shortly after arriving. The restaurant appears to seat 50 comfortably and we dined on an extremely busy night with a nearly full dining room. We were seated across a party of twenty near the piano player, which if you do not enjoy listening to the piano may be a nuisance but we loved the sound and were quite impressed that someone so young could play so well.  \n\nOur server was delightful and opened with an explanation of the restaurant which also services as a non-profit for at risk youth, which was delightful to hear. She followed with the specials for the evening and took our order for appetizer and drinks.  The only complaint I have for the evening is that they were out of certain alcoholic beverages and dishes, but the server quickly offered alternatives. There were several birthdays that evening and our server announced them over the microphone and the entire restaurant saluted the birthday men by singing happy birthday. It was really fun.  I may have to take a birthday wo/man to celebrate...it was cute. \n\nDefinitely saving the best for last, the food was great.  We ordered the fried chicken dinner and accompaniments of collard greens and garlic mashed potato and gravy.  The chicken was absolutely delicious, very moist and seasoned well; the collard greens were better than my own and mine our delicious; the garlic mashed potatoes came with gravy but were very good without it and we did not taste the gravy.  Our second entr\u00e9e of shrimp and grits was cooked perfectly.  The grits were adequately seasoned and sprinkled with chorizo, the shrimp were excellently seasoned, and the combination was perfect.  We ordered a side of macaroni and cheese that was individually baked inside a small dish providing a large enough serving for two, or if it is the only thing you order enough for one.  This dish was filled with ample cheese, properly cooked pasta, and seasoned just right.  To finish our meal, I ordered the sweet potato pie that was topped with the most delectable cream.  If I weren't full, I could have ordered a second piece of pie, and was almost tempted to take one to go.  \n\nOn recommendation, I came from the East Bay to enjoy this place and am definitely glad I faced the traffic to do so. I would most definitely recommend this restaurant. Great ambience, good service, great food, and a great cause.", "author": "Jeanell J."}

And the entertainment was fantastic! I couldn't believe how reasonably priced this place was considering all this. I came because it's a great cause (servers, chefs, entertainers, etc. are all at-risk youth who are learning valuable employment skills and discovering their talents - and they are definitely talented!). But even without the cause, the food and ambiance is enough to merit 5 stars. Well, maybe 4.5 because service was a bit spotty. But hey, they're youth who are still training.\n\nRecommend:\n- Abu's peanut butter stew (from Sierra Leone): mmmm... my mouth is literally watering thinking of it\n- Ribs: could not believe how tender and tasty they were... I guess I didn't have high expectations because of the price\n- Mac & cheese: solid, yummy comfort food\n- Shrimp & smoky cheesy grits: award winning for a reason!\n- Sweet potato pie (individual size) w/ coffee whipped cream... surprisingly fantastic combination!\n- Coconut rice pudding & mango: like a mushier form of mango & sticky rice... YUM\n\nGood, but not quite as great:\n- Spinach salad: fine and healthy, but not something I'd get again (I am a salad snob though)\n- Burgers (comes as 3 sliders): a bit spicy, and not my favorite... but I'm also just not big on burgers\n- Panna cotta: beautiful presentation and enjoyable for me, but some people might not be crazy about the unique taste (someone described it as a yogurt/cream/cheesy taste - basically a mix of every dairy product you can think of)\n\nDefinitely worth the trip out to Bayview!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-18", "description": "Ambience: This is one of those hidden treasure type places.  It is a refreshing contrast to going to one of the many high end (in stars and dollar signs) places available in SF.  All of the supper club ambience, in a true old school style (gorgeously restored deco exterior, dark interior, a few handsome banquettes), and none of the attitude, plus you get your money's worth.  \n\nFood: You will likely ingest more calories than you intended, as this place specializes in \"world soul food\" and the portions are bountiful and attractively plated.  The shrimp with cheesy grits was very good and I ate way more of the grits (all of it!) than was necessary for the day's caloric requirements. I balanced the creamy cheesiness with a bowl of greens; they were fabulously tasty.  My husband had the peanut butter stew which was also good, and much more \"genteel\" in appearance and on the tastebuds, than you would expect for stew, as the meat is chicken, and the sauce is also influenced by coconut milk.\n\nStaff: The staff are precious.  Hard to believe the sweet-faced kid who introduces her or himself as your server was likely incarcerated, or close to being so, in the past. And many of them will come by the table and introduce themselves.  So be prepared to have on your big sister/brother/auntie/good mom/granny hat on and let the love flow.  Make no mistake, these kids are learning the restaurant trade.  That means there may be some awkward moments that might not happen otherwise. When we went, the owner was also there, and she came around to all the tables, too.\n\nMusic:  A jazz combo was playing when we arrived, and it fit right in with the supper club nature of the place. Unfortunately, the three-piece unit way too loud so we asked for the table that was furthest from the source.  They did turn down, and we ultimately and truly enjoyed their music.  The kid on the piano was a true, and fine, jazz singer.  Most purported jazz singers get on my nerves, especially when they start to scat.  But this kid delivered; we were really impressed.  Kind of Mel Torme, very hip 50's style. Fit right in with the scene, man, dig?  \n\n Neighborhood: There is no denying people get nervous coming here. But you must also give the neighborhood people credit for not driving this sweet place away, as Old Skool has been here for several years.  So, try not to worry, be streetsmart, but let yourself feel a little protected by the positive spirit and vibe that Old Skool emanates. It is on a little plaza adjacent to the main drag of 3rd street; there are signs that say \"no parking\" but it seems to actually function as the parking lot for the plaza.  It's a drug free school zone, and even if it weren't, I think the operating hours may be a little early for the bad news bears to be out. There are also muni bus and streetcar stops right in front. It is worth the time and effort to come and try the shrimp with smoky-cheesy grits!  We will be back.  We need Old Skool to continue to offer a leg up to the local kids.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

Kinda rough area, the building's exterior doesn't give away that there's a fine dining establishment inside. The door is a portal to a 1940s Jazz hall, the decor is great and most days they have live performers singing and playing. Very intimate setting, not a large number of seats.\n\nTheir head chef/co-founder came out during the meal and had a long conversation with us about what they do there and their success stories.

My wife is a huge fan of his from his appearances on Food Network's show \"Cutthroat Kitchen\" and he took the time to chat and joke with her. Even signed our wine bottle so she had a souvenir. Total rock-star-chef move sir! Our waiter was great too, young man who obviously took great pride in his job and the level of service he provided to the restaurant's patrons. He even walked us to our car after the meal.\n\nWe had the kale and Brussel sprout salad, black-eye pea salad, chicken drumettes, pulled pork and cornbread, gumbo on rice, and the lavender cheesecake. My wife LOVED everything. She's a pretty picky eater... She doesn't eat salads. She raved about these ones. She said her pulled pork was the best she'd ever had. And my gumbo was really good. So many places out here on the west coast just wash out all the flavor and heat that traditional gumbo has. None of those shenanigans here. This gumbo has a good kick and the shrimp were perfectly cooked. And the cheesecake, oh my god, the cheesecake... That's another thing my wife doesn't ever like, except this time. She took Yaku's advice and tried it and then it was over. So so so good!\n\nAll y'all need to go here. Not just for the food, not just for the atmosphere, not just for the staff, but for the mission. For the kids. It's a great place with a great message that just happens to have great food.", "author": "Clinton B."}

Came here with a huge group on Friday night (with reservations, of course) and had a blast. Atmosphere was warm and upbeat, with fun decor and awesome live music. Service was so attentive and friendly.\n\nThe gumbo was super popular at our table--definitely recommended for those who love foods that are packed with flavor. I preferred the shrimp and grits, which was really creamy and tasty.\n\nMy favorite part of the meal had to be the lavender cheesecake--SO good. The lavender was strong without overpowering the dessert. The crust had an amazing crunch to it, and there was a strawberry and balsamic vinegar sauce that sort of soaked into it all and gave it a delicious kick.

I had the blacked catfish with collared greens and mashed potatoes. My girlfriend had the peanut butter stew. Both were great but her stew stole the show.

Had a chance to meet with the chef and founder, awesome people with big hearts :)\n\nAmong the foods we ordered, the ribs were to die for, I'd say the best in SF.  Dry rubbed, tasty, and fall of the bones.   Live entertainment was great, too.  We had a young lady who was on The Voice, her voice is just magnificent.\n\nThe only improvement we suggest is the timing of the foods.  They came out too quickly.  For example, when we were still enjoying our salad (and we haven't finished yet) the waiter asked us if we're done with our salad, and he did it more than once.  Then he brought out our entrees, even before we finished our salad.  Then, we asked him for hot sauce, and others, it took him a while.  He had told us he usually works in the kitchen.  Don't get me wrong, he is polite, but maybe he is nervous.\n\nOverall, I really recommend this place.

I thought that was so nice. :) \n\nI ordered the grexican burger. Honestly, I did not like it. It was very dry and I ended up not eating it. The sweet potato fries that came with it were pretty good.

Brought out 9-mo old to the place last week. They gave us a booth and a booster seat for her to sit in. The booth was on a raised carpeted stage so baby was able to crawl / stand up right outside the walkway on the booth since the adjacent booths were empty. Servers were nice to us and food was just as excellent. WIN!!!\n\n\nIt helps that this place hires at risk youths to give them the chance to re-enter society, but the food, seriously, is also worth it!\n\nCame here at a yelp event. The benefit of that was I get to try pretty much the entire menu.  And I was pleasantly surprised that many of the southern dishes that I thought was going to cause clogged arteries and elevated blood pressure were...actually done quite healthily (as much as fried chicken can be healthy, that is).\n\n\nFried Chicken --- 5/5! Must get! I have never been to the south so don't know how it compares with the real deal, but most of the fried chicken I have had on the west coast is always bland and greasy. No subtle taste of spices to stimulate the senses. Just a lot of fried oil and a thick coat of breading. Not this baby. It is delicately balanced with rubbed spices and a moderate coating. Yummy!\n\nBaby Back Ribs --- the most surprising aspect of the ribs is the sauce is NOT HEAVY. I hate ribs that have a thick, gooey, almost too-sweet taste. Gross. The meat itself was very juicy, tender, and the sauce was just the right amount.\n\nPeanut Butter Stew --- Probably the most novel dish on the menu. Unfortunately I liked it the least because it was too salty for me, and I don't feel like the sweetness and richness of peanut butter was truly expressed.\n\nGumbo --- I only got a little taster, but good stuff. I don't have a high standard for gumbo though.\n\nSpicy Collard Greens --- I LOVED THESE. Compared to the normal collard greens that are just sour, these are sour and spicy which makes them HEAVENLY. I will probably get these everytime I come here.\n\n\nFinally, I like the venue, but I think the location is hard to park at. It's next to 3rd which is a busy street with tons of bus lines.", "author": "Elizabeth T."}

They weren't spicy, and the meat fell off the bone so easily. I also really liked the gumbo, and I usually don't like gumbo, as I find it tastes a bit \"muddy\" usually. Theirs had a nice spice to it. \n\nAlso, if you go, DEFINITELY get the sweet potato biscuits. They were really good.

We got there and were greeted by a host dressed head to toe 1940s style. We asked him if he could take a picture of us for our anniversary and even though the restaurant was busy, he obliged. \n\nHe took us to a beautiful, cozy table in the corner of the room and immediately our waitress came to take our drink orders. Our glasses weren't empty for longer than 5 minutes for the rest of the night.\n\nWe ordered the calamari for an appetizer and it was DELICIOUS!

There was a miscommunication in the kitchen and my partner ended up getting an appetizer order of chicken instead of a main meal size. However they gave us that appetizer for free and there was live music so we weren't too upset by the wait. When our food did get there it was well worth the wait. the ribs were fall off the bone tender and the sauce was delicious. Perfect soul food. At the end of our meal we ordered a chocolate mousse for a dessert. It was so rich and creamy we could barely eat it all, but we did and it too was completely delicious! \n\nAt the end of our meal our waitress told us that they comped our dessert because it was our anniversary; we're both broke college students so that extra $6 or $7 bucks was a big deal to us. \n\nEverything was amazing, atmosphere, service and food.

However, this is life, and demographics and economics change from neighborhood to neighborhood. Cant really avoid that in such an extreme city as San Francisco. The concept of the business is very cool, helping troubled young adults land a first job and great support system to help them enter the job world on the correct foot. The concept is one that is probably lacking in most large cities and one that should be modeled. Give this place try, you may a little nervous to exit the car at first, but who cares, deal with pushing outside the comfort zone- the people inside are very nice and the service was great! The food was good, a little over priced, the fried chicken batter did not have enough salt in it, creating a somewhat bland batter, however, it was so hot you knew it was fresh out of the fryer which is one of the biggest things! You will obviously wait for super fresh food to cool down as opposed to being curious why the food barely feels warm enough to be safe. The mashed potatoes, collard greens, and gravy were also delicious! Another knock on this place- they only serve beer and wine; I'd prefer to have a gin and tonic at dinner, but thats fine- San Francisco has enough great bars! Keep up the great concept, and the good food!

We had gumbo, blackened catfish, greens, and the shrimp and grits. All the food was tasty, it was flavorful and fresh. The only thing I didn't like was how the food was not brought out together.

We started off with the house made sodas; think Italian sodas. I had the blueberry one; the soda could have used a little more syrup. For starters we had the kale salad, tomato soup, chicken drumettes, and sweet potato fries. I wish the all of the sauces came in bigger containers. I had the shrimp and grits; it was creamy and flavorful. We had the fried chicken; it was crispy and moist.\nService was initially attentive. As the meal progressed, we didn't see much of our server. For the most part, service was very friendly.\nI would return.", "author": "Pamela D."}

Don't be intimated by the neighborhood and miss out on a great place.... I may have lucked out though since Jay-Z and Justin Timberlake was in town so all was good in the neighborhood!\n\nBut lets skip right to the point. Once you step inside, you're in  a whole different place and you forget about the neighborhood you're in. Keep in mind that the portions are smaller than normal because you're meant to share and try more than one dish. Prices are reasonable.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were really good or I may have just been really hungry. Either way, they were delicious while they were still hot. Tried the gumbo and that was really good too, flavorful, wasn't my favorite dish of the night but it had a little bit of everything. The chicken was just a bit too dry in the gumbo which probably did it for me. The baby back ribs were juicy, tender, and fell right off the bone. Ribs done right and definitely worth a try. I usually hate cole slaw but this place did it right (probably because I didn't feel like I was eating a mouthful of mayonaise).  The grits were good too. You could taste a hint of cheese, I kind of wish the cheesy taste was stronger but it was still good! The highlight of the meal was the Peanut Butter Stew... soooo good. I would just go back and eat that if I could. If you're wondering how it tastes like... it reminded me of thai curry with peanut butter mixed in. Unique and different... in a good way! Finished the meal with the panna cotta which was pretty good, syrup or the fruit was a bit too tart so it threw me when I first took a bite. Overall the meal was delicious and service was pretty good. The only reason why I dinged the star was because they kept refilling my mint lemonade without telling me that it wasn't free. Usually when its offered, it's free and when you have to ask you just assume you're going to pay for it. Had they told me beforehand, I wouldn't have been $10 deeper into my meal because of my drinks, I would have tried an actual dish instead!\n\nGood food, decent service (minus the mishap of not informing me about my drink), clean place, and tentative. Definitely worth giving this place a try if you can ignore where it's located at.", "author": "Johnson S."}

Problem is, on a completely objective level, these types of restaurants don't usually provide a great dining experience, so it feels more like donating to charity rather than having an enjoyable dinner. \n\nOld Skool Cafe completely destroys this misconception. Had I not been told by our waiter that it was designed for at-risk youth to stay off the streets and learn valuable business skills, I would've thought that it was just a wonderful soul food restaurant with an incredible ambiance for a great night out. What they are doing is phenomenal for these kids, but even more, what they are doing is phenomenal for the dining public.\n\nIt's dark and intimate, with an incredible singer and pianist performing random (but great renditions) of popular pop songs. It really gives Old Skool its charm and made dinner that much more enjoyable. We even made a song request to the singer and although she didn't know all of the words, she performed something similar and gave us a warm shoutout.\n\n-------------------------\nFOOD: (Best to worst)\n\nBBQ Ribs:\nWhat amazing BBQ Ribs. They were tasty and fall-off-the-bone tender. Loved every bite of these.\n\nGumbo:\nDelicious gumbo that went very well with the rice.\n\nSweet Potato Fries: \nAddictive as hell. These sweet potato fries were sprinkled with some sugar and cinnamon, which gave it a nice salty and sweet taste explosion. Although a bit too sweet at times, most of the ones I had were awesome.\n\nPeanut Butter Stew:\nA bit like Thai masamun curry, the peanut flavor was definitely the star of the show. It was good, but was missing some more kick.\n\nShrimp and Grits:\nThe shrimp was nice and tender, but grits were missing some more cheesy or buttery flavor. The grits were cooked well, just wasn't really that tasty.\n\nFried Chicken:\nThe fried chicken here included a few small drumsticks, each were nice and moist in the inside, but a bit over-fried on the outside. There was also a bit too much rubbed on, so the exterior taste was a bit too overpowering. The gravy could've also used some more saltiness. \n\nBlackened Catfish:\nThe one truly disappointing dish of the night. The catfish was too rubbery and the spices didn't kick at all.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe very few food disappointments aside, Old Skool Cafe is undoubtedly an amazing establishment. Even if it wasn't for an incredible cause, it would still be a great joint for tasty, homestyle soul food. I'm definitely coming back.", "author": "Roy C."}

I've never left dissatisfied with what I've ordered, though I should point out, I have some favorites: shrimp and grits, gumbo, mac & cheese, and sweet potato fries (I know, I know, all carbs and cholesterol). But I've made it though about 70% of their menu, and nothing disappoints. It really comes down to preference. Additionally, I've visited Old Skool with a few different groups of people over a period of 2 years, and each time, everyone is blown away by how good their food is. This isn't just southern-inspired food that resembles a home-cooked meal. There is a subtle complexity and sophistication to the dishes that you expect to taste when dining in SF!\n\nService-wise, there is certainly variance depending on who is working. Sometimes, the server is still fairly new and so you do need to be patient, while other times you get someone who is so articulate and professional, you would NEVER suspect you were at a restaurant that doubles as a \"job training\" site for at-risk youth!\n\nI also love the live music and transforming decor that contrasts so starkly with the rest of Old Skool's neighborhood!\n\nAnd honestly, the cause, on top of everything else, is an attribute that uniquely sets the restaurant's backdrop apart from other equivalent SF restaurants (much like the way \"sustainable\" or \"vegan\" restaurants also support a cause).", "author": "Jean B."}

Old Skool Cafe in a non-profit training/work place for at-youths (kids who've had trouble with the law, foster kids, etc).  The Chef, Kevin, came to our table and explained the premise of the business.  The kids (16-22 years old) go through a 12 week training course to learn etiquette, public speaking, ethics, etc before they can start to work and earn some much needed money and skills to bring into the world.  He explained how Old Skool Cafe is often safe haven for these kids and more a family than they have outside of the restaurant.\n\nI've been meaning to go here for over a year and I'm kicking myself for waiting so long.  I just gave up meat a week ago.  Ugh!  But there were still options for me.  First off, they bring complimentary, fresh from the oven sweet potato biscuits.  YUM!  Then I had a spinach salad with candied walnuts, chevre cheese and a tangy balsamic dressing.  I also ordered the mac & cheese with mushrooms and onions...the best mac and cheese I've ever had, however, I would recommend sharing...it is very rich.\n\nMy husband got the blackened catfish that came with a green onion & cranberry couscous and spicy collard greens.  He said he could eat the catfish every day.  Usually he complains that blackened fish is usually blackened, but not spicy.  He said the fish tonight had the perfect amount of spice to it.  There was also a really nice, tangy dill tar tar sauce, which was better than most.  I feel most other tar tar sauce seem to just taste like pickles in mayo.  The collard greens were amazing...zesty, tangy!  The couscous was even a surprising treat.  The green onion/cranberry combo was a nice zing.\n\nWe were offered a free dessert by the chef but were, unfortunately, too full to accept.  We will definitely save room next time for the lavender cheesecake or coconut rice pudding.\n\nThe atmosphere is charming and they have entertainment.

We arrived at 6:10-a note on the door explained the restaurant was closed for a private party until 6:30.  A wait staff person promptly unlocked the exterior gate and opened the door for us at 6:25. We gave our name and were seated promptly with menus. There was a large party of twenty five people who were listening to the owner about the Old Skool Cafe concept. We asked what was happening as a film crew was there. They were being filmed for a ten minute segment to be aired on CBS called Hidden Heroes and had been there since 11:30 a.m.  No one skipped a beat for the dinner crowd. Orders taken and food delivered in a timely manner!  Our server arrived with two sweet potato biscuits to enjoy while we looked over the menu-yum! The wine list had a nice variety as well as non-alcoholic beverages.  I chose Jordan's Fried Chicken as my dinner. A half chicken that arrives in two sections, a leg/thigh piece and a wing/breast piece. The dinner came with sides of Garlic Mashed Potatoes and Collard Greens-both seasoned and cooked perfectly.  Jordan's chicken is honestly the best fried chicken I've ever had and I've had my share. One of my Grandmother's was from Oklahoma and my other Grandmother was from Texas. I grew up on Southern Comfort food, fried chicken, black eyed peas, collard greens, cornbread etc. My husband and I planned on sharing everything. I also ordered a cup of Daniel's Gumbo-this was my husband's favorite besides the fried chicken. We ordered Abu's Peanut Butter Stew as well. This was my favorite besides the fried chicken (the seasoning on the chicken is amazing!). Creamy coconut milk with a peanut butter flavor almost like the sauce that comes with Chicken Satay and had small bites of chicken with a serving of rice in the middle. We were so full but since it was my birthday we decided to share a piece of Lavender Cheesecake. It was lovely-subtle hints of lavender served on a bed of strawberry-balsamic coulis. Every single dish was so good.  We will definitely come back as we want to try everything on the menu!

I hate to be the person to give the \"bad\" review but I'm going to be honest.\n\nI wanted to like this place so much. Besides being in a sketchy neighborhood right behind one of the muni lines, the decor and atmosphere made up for it. I was hoping the food and service would be up to par but in the end, my expectations were not met. \n\nThe good:\nHost - Very friendly and welcoming\n\nDecor/atmosphere - Beautiful, kind of had a mysterious, sexy vibe to it.\n\nPrix Fixe Menu - Great deal but the selection is limited. \n\nGumbo - The hit of the night. I believe the $13 was worth it. Giant pieces of shrimp and a good portion of dungeness crab, sausages and chicken. This was really on point.\n\n\nThe ok:\nRibs - Wasn't memorable. Tasted like any other ribs I've had.\n\nThe bad:\nCalamari - My goodness, I don't know what the batter consisted of but it was EXTREMELY salty. Thank god they kept refilling our water. The sauces that accompanied it was delicious tho but the saltiness just overpowered the flavor.\n\nService (let me explain) We had two different waiters. The first guy who took our order ended up serving another table which had about 8 people. He did let us know that a different waiter was going to attend to us. Our food started coming out about one after the other, every 5-10 minutes or so. After having 3 of the plates come out, about 30 minutes passes and there was no fried chicken to be found. I asked the waiter the first time and he said he was going to check on it. Another  10 minutes passes and the guy I believe who runs the place (manager or founder maybe?) asked our table how we were doing this evening and I told him we've been waiting for the fried chicken and he said he would check on it as well. \n\nBoth guys \"checked\" on it, I'm assuming but both of them failed to let us know that the first guy who took our order forgot to put in the computer until I asked the waiter why it was taking so long. The whole time we were waiting, I wish that someone would have addressed it to us that one of the orders wasn't put in the computer to at least make us aware. Had I known that he had forgot to put in, I would have just asked for the bill already after waiting for almost an hour. We ended up just taking the fried chicken to go after waiting for so long. \n\nI love what there doing for the at- risk, previously incarcerated and foster care youth by offering them job opportunities but I believe formal training is needed. Both of our waiters seemed miserable working there just by their tone of voice and demeanor. While focusing on assisting the youth, customer service and hospitality training should also be implemented.\n\nFirst impressions do matter.

At the Old Skool Cafe, you should.\n\nThe Old Skool Cafe is run by youths who were at one time considered \"at risk\", often having spent time in juvenile hall  The Old Skool Cafe gives them a second chance to learn skills and get their lives back on track.  They've been doing this about 10 years and have been featured in the media on networks like CNN.\n\nOf course, Old Skool isn't just about helping people.  It's also a fun place to eat.  Modeled after a 1940's supper club, the staff is dressed in black pants, red shirts and bright red Fedoras.  I guess the way to take the gangsta out of a teenager is to make him look like . . . well, a gangster.  And it works.  These gangsters provide a level of service that you would find at a Michelin rated restaurant.  \n\nThe restaurant is decked out very stylishly, again with 1940's supper club theme, and during dinner, you are likely to be entertained by some of the staff playing cool jazz from the same era.  \n\nOf course, the food was delicious as well.  It's southern cooking, so you probably ought to leave your diet at the door.  Food is served tapas style, but they are the largest tapas I've ever seen.  A good value for the money, we ate way to much. \n\nMy friend took me to the Old Skool Cafe.  I certainly never would have found it on my own, but I am quite sure I'll be back.", "author": "Glenn M."}

Brings me back Yelpin, and thoroughly deserves a 5 star review.\n\nGo to their website and read about the back story: a non-profit, youth-run supper club meant to give at-risk and previously incarcerated youth the opportunity to gain job training and work experience. The kids run everything- front AND back of the house, and management! Seriously, if that doesn't warm your heart, you are getting a lump of coal in your stocking!\n\nI came to Old Skool for a birthday dinner- as the coordinator, the entire process leading up to the dinner was painless. I made reservations, dropped off a cake, and worked with the FOH to ensure the staff knew about the birthday surprise. The staff were so friendly and went out of their way to help me, this would never happen at most SF restaurants.\n\nGetting to Old Skool is pretty painless- just go down 3rd! You can even take the T train. Parking was plentiful in the surrounding streets. \n\nThe interior is candle lit and swank- meant to invoke the 40s's era, which fits in with the staff's black and red uniforms, complete with fedoras for the males. There is an open dance floor where a jazz singer was performing with accompanying pianist- and get this! They were both from the local SFJazz High School All Stars. That's right, even our entertainment, which was outstanding, were youth. The pianist was 14!!! Amazeballs. \n\nBeing a large party, we ordered nearly everything on the menu- including the shrimp and grits (sooo good, grits were perfect, topped with spanish chorizo & scallions), roasted tomato soup with grilled cheese (comes with aged Vermont white cheddar cheese--creamy and classic), gumbo (amaze roux! comes with andouille sausage, chicken, shrimp, and dungeness crab), and sweet potato fries. We got TWO orders of mac n'cheese, one plain and one with bacon and jalapenos- both were gone instantly. \n\nAn interesting inclusion on the menu was the West African peanut butter stew- very creamy and a nice contrast to all the comfort food we were consuming. \n\nBut the best dish, hands down, was the buttermilk fried chicken- it takes 20 minutes, but it's sooo worth it. Juicy, perfectly fried skin- not for the faint of heart or those taking Lipitor (actually, even if you are taking Lipitor you should try a bite!)\n\nAll the food comes out tapas style, so its fun to share and get surprised with what comes out each time, and be able to try everything because you're not so stuffed with your own order.\n\nI forget what kind of beer they had, but they had several on the menu, plus red/white wine. We didn't try any desserts because we brought a cake, but they were so accommodating with the cake cutting and plates/etc.\n\nAlthough the decor, music, and food were all outstanding, the best part of the evening was definitely our waitress- who towards the end of our meal took the mic and told her story and why she was working at Old Skool, and how much it had helped her both personally and professionally. Such a unique aspect to the evening, so much better than the typical industry staff who only want to hustle you out the door to seat their next party. \n\nSo R-U-N to Old Skool! My new favorite restaurant in SF, I will be back for brunch soon!", "author": "Amaranta C."}

The restaurant is run by foster or previously incarcerated youth. I wouldn't have known if I hadn't read the menu. The staff are very friendly and attentive.

Since the meal was pre-fixe, we we got to have a variety of appetizers, entrees, and desserts.\n\nI had the black eyed pea salad, shrimp and grits, and mini sweet potato pie. \n\nDesserts:\nMy favorite of the night was the mini sweet potato pie, it sure has a lot of flavor/spice packed in a little bite! The panna cotta was smooth and accented well with the balsamic sauce. I found the coconut rice pudding a bit too thick for my taste.\n\nEntrees:\nThe shrimp and grits were tasty and filling. The Anbu peanut butter stew had a bit more of a savory taste, but I personally liked the shrimp and grits more. The stew is great for those who like a lot of sauce and a peanut buttery flavor. The gumbo was as good as the shrimp and grits for me.\n\nAppetizers:\nThe roasted tomato soup was tasty and accurately described as \"bright\". Don't expect the texture of a bisque, because it was thicker and chunkier. The spinach salad was a very standard salad. I liked my black eyed pea salad, though there was a bit too much raw red onions for my taste,\n\nAmbiance:\nThe environment was fun and noisy. Great place to dress up and try some new food. \n\nMission:\nThe mission of the restaurant really stands out among all the other places you can spend your $.

Both were birthday occasions ( I was complimented a free dessert).\n\n Located near the Bayview Opera House, it sports a smaller sign and the front door does not stand out.  It can be hard to find.   But....once inside you are transported from a fairly gritty street, to a supper club type atmosphere.  Waiters in black pants and red shirts with black bow ties. Jazzy piano  in the background.  Snappy!  \nAs the other reviewers mentioned, all of the menu items were delicious.  Shrimp and Grits were a stand out for me. Super creamy, smokey grits, no salt needed, with five plump moist prawns was more than enough for me. But don't let that mislead you, our table of four ordered the following: Mac n cheese, ( would have liked it better if thicker and Mac was not so cooked) Calamari ( lightly seasoned batter, yum, with rings and tentacles), chicken wings, Fried Chicken, and the Gumbo, all delicious.  Chef Kevin came to our table and we chatted about the At Risk Youth Program, which is the heart of the restaurant.  Everyone of the staff was excellent!  I wish them success in all of their endeavors.  \nAll in all, this is a one of a kind place putting out delicious comfort food in a semi swanky spot while serving its community.  Can't ask for much more.  Oh, and when you go, tip big.......tip from the heart.  Let's keep these hard workers gainfully employed.", "author": "Nancy S."}

I didn't know what to expect before going- but I was HUGELY surprised and happy with this restaurant. \n\nFirst off, Old Skool Cafe is for a good cause. They train young adults who have been in foster homes or previously in limbo with the law, with skills so they can obtain other jobs to help their future. How awesome is that?? Part way through the dinner one of the servers got on the mic and told us about his background, and how Old Skool has really helped him out. It was really touching to hear a firsthand account from this young guy. \n\nSecondly- the food is amaaaazing! Since we have a gigantic group we got multiple orders of each of the small plates so everyone was able to try everything. From the biscuits to the peanut butter stew to the fried chicken, to the desserts- it was fabulous! There was no dish that left me unsatisfied, except that I wanted to eat more. \n\nThirdly, ambiance! There was a live jazz band playing that night. I'm no jazz expert but they sounded really good. All the workers were dressed in red and black- some with suspenders and others in fedoras. My whole experience was positive. \n\nOld Skool Cafe is a little out of the way for me to get to- but I would make the trek again to come back for more.", "author": "Christine A."}

The interior is gorgeous, reds and blacks, low lighting, mirrors, a throwback to the Harlem Renaissance. They've got a beautiful fireplace, a chaise lounge and a semi-private area for larger groups. Also a piano and wide-open performance space.\n\nThe food is fantastic. Soul food with actual kick. The peanut butter stew ROCKED and the fried chicken had this smoky taste to them that was perfect and different and delish. I will definitely go back.\n\nThe mission of this non-profit, helping formerly incarcerated youth to get their lives back on track, via having a job and gaining restaurant experience...YES! This is something I want to support. There is no other model out there for what they are doing. Delancey Street has something similar, but their servers get free residence in exchange for their labor. At Old Skool Cafe, the servers actually get paid. These young kids have the most amazing stories (which they tell at random intervals during the evening), and they are learning from you, their customers. \n\nDining out for social change never tasted so good. Check it, you won't be disappointed. PS To the yelpers who are scared of 3rd street--puh-lease it's well lit and people are friendly. The neighborhood is fine. I left my bicycle locked up outside and nobody messed with it.\n\nOh! The best part is the soundtrack.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-09-04", "description": "My 1,000th review goes to Old Skool Cafe. I'd been saving this spot for something truly special, so I'm disappointed that OSC didn't quite meet my expectations.\n\nAs someone who does volunteer work, believes in the importance of giving back and helping the community, and loves what OSC represents, provides, and does for at-risk youth, it pains me to leave a 2-star review. I really wanted to love this place. How could anyone not? It's mission is plain and simple: provide marketable employment skills, training, and jobs in the restaurant industry to at-risk and previously incarcerated youth (ages 16-22) and prevent violence. However, I'd rather be honest, than lie or sugarcoat about my experience here.\n\nIf you've never heard of OSC, check out StillMotion's 6-minute documentary on the non-profit youth-run supper club: vimeo.com/42108559\n\nReservations were easily made via Yelp SeatMe for Friday at 7:30 pm. We ran late and called to change our reservation to 8:30 pm. Free parking is available in a lot directly in front. When we checked in with the hostess, she couldn't find our reservation and then realized minutes later she was on the wrong date... With a few empty tables around, we still had to wait to be seated. Eventually, we were seated at their one and only window nook awkwardly facing the restaurant and diners. OSC is dimly lit, styled in 1940s decor, and red-and-black-themed.\n\nWith a Yelp check-in, you get a complimentary soda, so Jessica C. and I both ordered the strawberry flavor, which tasted great.\n\nI started off with Abu's Peanut Butter Stew (cup, $8). Consisting of chicken, peanut butter, fresh herbs, coconut milk, and topped with fried garlic chips and diced tomatoes over rice, this dish was a huge disappointment. The cup size was actually quite a large portion but I didn't like the flavors, so after a couple of small bites, I pushed it to the side. For my main, I ordered the Pan Seared Shrimp 'n Smoky Grits ($16), topped with Spanish chorizo and scallions. I was excited for this as I love grits, but this was very bland. The consistency of the grits were a lot smoother than I preferred, however the shrimp tasted fine. Portion, again, is definitely on the larger side, and again, I wasn't able to finish. I also ordered a side of Mac & Cheese ($8) to share and that, too, was bland and dry. Jessica C. was excited for dessert and already knew she wanted to order the cheesecake. Unfortunately for us, OSC was sold out. We weren't sure if we should order dessert at all by this point, so our server said he'd get us the Coconut Rice Pudding ($7) \"on the house\". It arrived soon after and was very standard.\n\nWhen the bill arrived, I noticed the rice pudding was in fact, not \"on the house\" as our server said it would be. I didn't have a problem with paying for it, but why say it'd be complimentary if we're going to be charged for it? Other than this mishap, customer service was amazing. I don't recall our server's name, but he was super accommodating, friendly, and easygoing. The rest of the staff were just as lovely. On our way out, they made sure we had a ride home as OSC is located in a fairly bad neighborhood. Even when we were taking photos outside of the restaurant, a staff member came out to ask if we needed a ride and to make sure we were okay. It was very sweet of them to be so caring.\n\nNow, had this been the end of my experience, it would've been very easy for me to give them 5-stars simply based on the concept and organization, even though the food was subpar. But it didn't end there.\n\nWhen I came home from SF Tuesday evening and began unpacking, I realized my point-and-shoot camera was missing. I then remembered that Jessica C. had been using my camera to take photos of the food, and she confirmed that she had accidentally left it on the booth of our table. I contacted OSC via email asking if they had found my camera and hoped for the best. I promptly received a phone call the next morning and was told that they hadn't found anything, the staff has protocols to follow if anything is lost and found, and that OSC would be in touch if they found it. Now, we dined there on a Friday night and was the last party to leave. Unless OSC doesn't clean the restaurant and wipe down the booths on a daily basis, there's no way another party on Saturday evening could've taken my camera. So, you do the math.\n\nDespite the immense amount of respect I have for OSC and its founder, Teresa Goines, I can't help but have unfavorable feelings about my overall experience here. However, regardless of my experience, I still whole-heartedly recommend visiting OSC at least once to support the cause, youth, and community.\n\nP.S. I don't have any photos of the food as they were on the lost camera, but I did (shameless plug) make a Tastemade episode covering our meal, where you can see all of the food we ordered: tastemade.com/@ivywang/rqyN_vbASsq-2avSbFokrQ", "author": "Ivy W."}

Uh... ok I guess we were heading to the bayview at night time on a saturday night. So I grabbed it, but of course it stayed in my pocket. Parking was easy and close. It's by the T-line so it was bright and all cool.\n\nAmbiance:\nWe walked in and it was GORGEOUS. It was draped in red, black, and gold. The servers were young and looked sharp in their 40s attire. A terrific band was playing oh-so-soulful music. We felt like we weren't in the 2000s anymore, let alone SF.\n\nService: \nOur server was Jonathan who was so very sweet and attentive. He gave us a great back story of how he began to to work there. He was definitely a highlight of the whole experience. When I began to pour my own water from the bottle, he rushed over and said that's his job. I protested, but he said yes. He told us he had googled \"fine dining\" to figure out what he was supposed to do. Can you say awww? Now that is someone who is dedicated to going above and beyond.\n\nFood:\nMy friend, who is pretty much a connoisseur on gumbo, took a spoonful, and burst out a little too loudly, \"We are SO coming back here!\" \nWe also had the peanut butter stew.. Oh. M. Gee. yeah it was that good. \nThe mac and cheese was the perfect comfort in my comfort food.\nThe potato puree that came with the amazing fried chicken even had I'm not sure what kinda crispy stuff, but GAH it was good!\n\nNow what set off the night and made it just about the most amazing dining experience ever....\nThe founder and the dreamer of the whole concept,Teresa, came over to talk to us. We were so very lucky because we got to hog her for a considerable amount of time. How she started off as a correction officer, moved to Mexico to try to learn the language, faced her own adversities while trying to change things, and how she dreamed this great idea. That when she would ask \"her kids\" what hopes and dreams they had, they would say, \"Hopes? You mean to make to live to 18?\". And now Old Skool Cafe is here, in the neighborhood where youth who can't get hired anywhere else, have a place to prove themselves. And man are they proving all who say they can't, wrong.\n\nWhile we were talking to Teresa, she gave a big hug to one of her staff who was on her way out. Teresa watched her leave with a big smile on her own face, pointed to the young woman as she left, and said, \"she never used to smile like that\".\n\nAaaand after talking to Teresa for so long, our Mac and Cheese got cold, so of course Jonathan, our lovely server, asks if he could go warm it for us.\n\nI've been floored by this experience.\nGo for the SO GOOD food.\nGo for the AMAZING service.\nGo for the support to keep this story going. \nAnd honestly, don't wait too long, because I know this place is going to be packed before you know and hard to get in.\nYou'll have to compete with me because I still haven't tried the shrimp and grits and sweet potato pie. I really want to try their brunch. Oh and I have too many friends that I want to share this oh so fly place with. Plus I didn't get to hear some spoken word that I really wanted to hear.\n\nUh.. wait.. don't tell too many people..", "author": "Lorrie C."}

The restaurant is one of those places that reminds you there are still so many awesome and thoughtful people in the world.  Its tucked away on a main street in an area called Dog Patch. If you weren't looking for it you would probably miss it. When we first pulled up I must admit I was a little nervous there were tons of people hanging around on the corners and you could tell the neighborhood was a bit sketch but once we walked through the doors we felt right at home. The fact that the entire restaurant is \"ran\" by young adults is great. Our waiter Marcus was very helpful and patient. He explained that the menu was meant to be served Tapas style and made sure to answer any other questions we had.  The young man playing the piano was great and we got a chance to talk to him for a bit while he took a break.  Also Chef Kevin was such a wonderful guy. He came by our table several times and spoke with us about the concept of the restaurant and giving us suggestions for our trip.  Be warned that if you get to this restaurant by taxi It will take you a while to get one to pick you up. \nFood:\n\nCeviche: Great flavor! Served with pita chips. \n\nBarbeque Ribs:  These were very good, the meat was nice and tender and the barbeque sauce had a great flavor. I also really liked the coleslaw which is rare for me. It was mixed with a sweet light salad dressing instead of mayo which was nice.\n\nFried Chicken: The fried chicken was yummy. The buttermilk coating was tasty and although the menu says it comes with only 2 pieces of chicken it actually came with 5. Its also served with garlic mashed potatoes.\n\nGumbo:  This gumbo was on point and this is coming from a few Cajuns and Texan girls! The roux was nice and thick and had  a great color which let me know it was going to taste great. It came with four big shrimp and plenty of crab meat in it. \n\nMac & Cheese w/ Andouille: Now this was probably my least favorite thing we ordered. It is large serving that you can share with several people and while it was very cheesy and had a nice texture and taste something was just missing for me. Maybe it was missing seasoning or something. \n\nCheesecake: Great dessert.", "author": "Krystal P."}

We heard the restaurant had good food but we were clueless about the backstory.  First, it's a charming spot.  Every staff member we spoke to had big smiles and exuded warmth.  Our waiter looked so handsome and it was clear he was a bit shy.  I think he refilled our water 15 times or so - big props there. We went for Sunday brunch. There were two beautiful ladies sitting next to us that came just after their church service. I am certain they were in their 80s and both had difficulty walking.  When they were done with their lunch they had difficulty even getting up.  As soon as they made their first attempt to rise every kid in the place jumped into action.  They helped them up, took them through the restaurant and walked them to their car.  Each lady had two escorts. Chivalry lives at Old Skool!\n\nWhen we got our check, a gentleman in his chefs coat came over to greet us.  I believe he volunteers his time to help train the apprentices in the kitchen. He told us the back story. We are so glad he told us. Then again, we may be the only fools who didn't know! Hey, we saw the 5 yelp stars and came ready to chow, story or not!  Too bad we didn't actually read the reviews.\n\nWe got there later in the day so don't know if it's normal but the brunch buffet seemed pretty limited and didn't have some of the dishes folks are talking about here and you couldn't order off a menu.  Next time we go it will be for dinner and I will be sure to get the Shrimp and Grits!  \n\nI wish there could be thousands of Old Skool's throughout the country.  We've been foster parents before and it was heartbreaking to hear most of the stories from our foster children, they had so few happy memories to share. The California Youth Authority (DJJ) has an extremely difficult job to do, but they have failed our youth in horrific ways.

Go if you enjoy comfort food with a kick, if you want a rich and unique experience (especially if you like live Jazz and Blues), or if you like the idea of supporting a good cause.\n\nWhile the food alone is worth the trip (even for those who don't live near Bayview/Hunter's point), it is the character of the staff here that most people will notice right away. The staff is made up entirely of local young adults, 16-22. They aren't smiling, laughing, making conversation, etc. because they want your tip- it's because they have seen a second chance come to fruition and they have a sense of community and belonging that you help sustain just by showing up. They're dedicated to the work and it shows.\n\nGive it a try- you won't be disappointed (unless yer a stuffy ol' fart).", "author": "Jon L."}

A friend of a friend was involved with the inception of the restaurant, so I heard a lot of first-hand stories about the great cause.  Even without the backstory, I would have been very impressed with the place - everything from the food to decor was great.  My 2 favorite dishes were the shrimp & grits and Daniel's gumbo.  The food is very authentic and nicely presented...a great place to come with a small group of 4-6 so that you can get a good taste of everything.

Otherwise, I would've given it 5 stars. I spent $100 for 4 people, but with hungry grown sons, the quantity didn't satisfy them.  However, the food was delicious and the serving sizes were adequate for a gourmet dish.\n\nI wasn't aware that the homemade sodas didn't come with free refills and received sticker shock when I received the bill. However, the ambiance, service, and live entertainment made up for the minor inconveniences. I will definitely return, since I now know what to expect.

I can just give them 5 stars because of their cause, but I also have to rate their food and service.  \n\nMy church fam came here on 7/13/12 to support this organization.  There were quite a few of us along with other patrons.  We came here knowing that we are supporting them with some expectation that it is a training place for the youth therefore, things can go wrong.  Food was a plus since I've heard good reviews.  There are a couple of places like these that you all should support also.  There's Cafe Phoenix, Delancey Restaurant, Bakeworks and probably other places I don't know.\n\n First of all, it's not a sketchy location, well not anymore.  This place has gotten better with all the additions that's happened the past few years.  We left this place around 10pm, there were young folks hanging around, but it wasn't scary at all.  Place was easy to find.  It's not exactly on 3rd street, but by a small walkway.\n\nOn to the ambience. We walked in and we were pleasantly surprised by the ambience.  It was like walking in to the 1940s.  Completely forgot we were on 3rd st., hahah.  It was dim, it had booths that were dark red, the decors were very 1940s.  Every detail was well thought of. Even the bathroom was nicely decorated. There was a small spot/stage where people perform and we got to enjoy it later that night.  This place feels intimate which I like.  \n\nOn to the food.  I appreciate that they try to utlize local ingredients.  My husband ordered the Arnold Palmer and I tried their homemade strawberry soda.  They were sampling this drink called otai and I downed a shot of that drink.  It was goooood.  It was a dairy based pineapple, mango and coconut smoothie kind.  The coconut was fresh, not those dried ones and you can taste the pulp still.  I had to order a glass of that.  For food, we tried:\n-sweet potato fries with aioli (yummy)\n-fried chicken wings with mashed potatoes - good wings, mashed potatoes were creamy, I think they use stock, coz the creaminess didn't come from cream or milk.\n-grexican burger - i tasted more the mexican side than the mediterranean part\n- peanut butter stew - bomb.com!  I wish it came hot (temperature) but it was            good.  I prefer it with a little kick though to balance out the sweetness, but I know there are folks who are sensitive to heat.  \n-mac and cheese - creamy goodness.  it's not as complex but love the caramelize onions with it. \n- panna cotta - creamy, slightly sweet to my taste especially with the added drizzled syrup.  \n\nOn to the service.  Teresa, the brainchild of this place went around to meet folks and thanked them.  Our server, I forgot his name, was polite and tried his best.  Although sometimes he was hard to find or sometimes had no idea what to say or how to respond. I think he forgot to give us the complimentary bread coz I saw others get some, but our table didn't. There were a lot of servers that were going around, it's nice to see them on their uniform, but also quite entertaining (in a nice way) to see them stumble and try their best to do their job.  \nThe downside during our visit was their kitchen got really backed up resulting to almost an hour delay to get our food and some of the folks with us not getting their food at all.  But the way they handled this was something I respect.  They apologized and was very honest about the reason this happened.  They humbly admitted that it's their 2nd day that it's gotten that busy and they need more practice in handling it.  They were really sincere and you can see in their eyes that they felt they failed it.  But they didn't.  It's a good learning experience for all of them.  They offered free gumbo and desserts to folks who were waiting.  They even offered free wine!  In the end, they comped my table's bill because of the long delay.  We ended up leaving the money we were gonna use to pay for our food as their tip.\n\nOverall, we'll definitely come back... very soon!", "author": "Claire J."}

We started off with the kale salad which was hearty.  We also received complimentary sweet potato cornbread, which was good. The fried chicken with garlic mashed potatoes and collard greens were quite good. My friend ordered the gumbo which she really enjoyed. I ordered the shrimp and grits which were quite were delicious! We also loved the macaroni and cheese, it too was  absolutely delicious! The sweet tea was actually among the best sweet teas that I have tasted in a while  ( I used to live in Georgia). Last,  if you just want a dessert, I would definitely recommend the  sweet potato pie, it's among the best I've ever tasted! Also, the staff was friendly, professional, and attentive from the moment we stepped into the door until we left. It's a good place to have a nice dinner date or a nice dinner with friends or family.

The staff was very friendly and helpful, the owner even came by and chatted with our table for a bit. Everything we had was delicious! Our table ordered the ceviche, fried chicken wings, mac n' cheese, shrimp & grits and the W. African peanut butter stew. My favorites were the mac n' cheese and the shrimp & grits, both perfectly made. We added bacon and jalape\u00f1os to our mac n' cheese - good choice on our part. :) \n\nThe decor is made to look like a mix between a Hollywood set and a jazz club from the 40's with red and black as the main colors. They did a good job with the space and found the ambiance to be warm and inviting. From start to finish, the staff and other customers made you feel like family. We became fast friends with the customer next to us, who we ended up sharing our dessert with in exchange for a good story and a handful of jokes. :) He and the receptionist later demonstrated their stellar swing moves when they cut a rug on the main floor. \n\nFor dessert we originally ordered the coconut rice pudding, but were later convinced to change our order to the Lavender cheesecake when the young lady who made it came to our table and very endearingly persuaded us to try her new creation. :) We're so glad we did, as it was delicious!! Unlike other cheesecakes, it was light and fluffy, not heavy and dense. The subtle hint of lavender, shortbread crust and fresh nectarine topping brought it all together nicely. \n\nAside from the high quality of food, the friendly staff and warm ambiance, what really makes this place stand out is that it's staffed and run by at-risk youth. It's sole purpose is to provide an alternative to a life of crime and poverty. I love the cause behind it, but also feel like the quality and standard hasn't been compromised at all. Loved it there!

The wait and host staff we interacted with were very young and very professional.  Service at times was a bit overattentive, but understandably they are trying to get the word out about their great cause.\n\nThe food here is pretty solid--tapas style soul food.  We had the mac and cheese with bacon, peanut butter stew, shrimp and grits, ceviche, red velvet lava cake and a coconut rice pudding style dessert.  They even gave us a free oreo truffle type bonbon, which was probably my favorite dish of the night.  The shrimp and grits and mac and cheese were wonderful.  Can't complain about the peanut butter stew either.  The ceviche was my least favorite--not super flavorful and the menu said there was avocado, but there was none to be found once the dish arrived.  All this food plus a bottle of wine, we had about an $80 bill for two, which I thought was pretty reasonable given all that we had!\n\nThe live music was wonderful--a singer and guitar player--and it made my night.  Very talented kids!\n\nIf you live in central SF, it's a bit of a haul out here, but parking was easy.  We made reservations, and while the restaurant wasn't packed, it was busy, so I would recommend making reservations.\n\nIt's likely I'll return--it's nice to know your money is going to a good cause, and in exchange, you get good food!", "author": "Caitlin T."}

I have a friend who makes the Alton Brown recipe and this is a million times better. Browned on top and gooey inside. Stays hot for a while too since it comes on one of those boat dishes and is placed on another dish. \n\n- sweet potato fries ($4) - yummy crispy, nice and long fries too, not short/choppy, awesome chipotle aioli to go with it\n\n- calamari ($9) - super small portion, but tasty\n\n- sweet potato mini pie ($6) - definitely mini, but sweet :)\n\nAmbiance - \n\n- loved how they made use of natural light through the windows but also put up a temporary kind of curtain so the sun wouldn't be directly in our eyes\n\n- loved the decor - soooo cute! red walls that aren't too 'in your face' since there was artwork all around. love the mirrors and the older style of microphones they use\n\n- women's restroom (according to my wife) was nice and clean and had an interesting collage on the walls\n\n- they played some Pandora radio station and there were great songs, but it was \n funny to hear the ads (on the comment card they gave us, we suggested Spotify)\n\nStaff - \n\n- hostess people were super friendly and welcoming\n\n- our waitress was nice and we could tell that she is a youth who is still learning how to do it all (given the Old Skool Cafe story, she did a great job! We don't know her background or what kind of life she leads, but she was friendly to us and had a good demeanor)\n\n- chatted with another staff member to hear more about the things they're doing. Love how the menu is about not only what tastes good, but the food comes from the lives of the youth too - Abu is a youth from West Africa and brought his peanut butter stew recipe to the menu, we'll definitely give it a try next time. \n\n* Overall, 5 stars! Love their mission and vision. And really, the food is just a delicious bonus. Just to support the youth means more than anything. \n\nWe'd definitely go back again.

No sugar coating here. It's in a sketchy part of San Francisco so please be aware of your surroundings when parking and walking to the restaurant. So when I say \"run, don't walk\" here, I mean it both literally and figuratively. \n\nBut once you walk into the restaurant, the staff was really welcoming and friendly. The ambiance is romantic with candlelights, two chandeliers, big mirrors and decor that mimicked a 40's theme. Live music filled the room by a talented pianist and a lovely singer. \n\nOur server, Leonard, was a nice young gentleman. He made his best efforts to make sure our glasses were filled, and our sweet tea and lemonade mint tea were always refilled. \n\nWe started off the with complimentary biscuits. I usually don't write about complimentary starters, but the warm and buttery biscuits paired with the sweet whipped butter was amazing. I ended up eating my husband's share as well. \n\nEverything else we ordered was delicious! (note: dishes are tapas styled, meaning small portions and meant to be shared)\n\n- Chicken Wings w mashed potatoes\n- Shrimp & Grits\n- BBQ pork belly ribs\n- Seasoned catfish \n\nDidn't get to try the dessert because we were stuffed to the max. \n\nThroughout dinner, cops were patrolling right outside the premises, and they walked into the restaurant not once, but twice to speak with the GM. (Not sure about what). It just really kills the vibe going inside the restaurant, but when Leonard went up to the microphone to address the patrons briefly about how gave him the opportunity to turn his life around, (You go Leonard!!!), it melted all my anxiety and worries away because I wanted nothing more than to support this wonderful organization and what it stands for. \n\nIn hindsight, the purpose of OSC is to help keep the youth off the streets, and while it's location is not in the best part of the neighborhood, it's the youth, the music and the food that will have me coming back for sure.", "author": "Nancie T."}

Its rich and a little salty but almost reminded me of a burmese curry of sorts. fried garlic chips set it off!!!!\n*Blackened catfish - was ok, fish was super tender, cooked to perfection, but would have liked a little more blackening/cajun - i loved the collards on the side though, they were true to the south as I lived in Charleston for 10 years \n*Mac and cheese - super cheesy and creamy - we added jalapenos for a kick and they were the fresh kind! - this place does things right \n\nI tried a beer I had never had before Jai Ho -  it was super easy drinking and washed the meal down well. The atmospohere was great loved the red booths and black walls, piano player was a great touch.\n\nIm just so happy for this place, they are brining people up right, providing them with a path and proper training!

If you check-in with your smartphone on yelp, you will receive a free none alcoholic drink. \nWe ordered the famous Abu's West African Peanut Butter Stew $12 which was small but incredible and you really cant taste the PB. We also ordered Daniel's Gumbo, bowl $13 and it was so so good with little kick. For dessert we had Coconut Rice Pudding $7 but to be honest I thought it was the weakest dish....I felt that it was just too plain and it needed that kick especially since the dessert is described as \"creamy and refreshing, made with Madagascar bourbon vanilla beans, and topped with freshly diced mangoes \", I really did not taste the bourbon vanilla beans. I think you can skip that dessert and order another hefeweizen beer and sit back, relax and enjoy the life performance.", "author": "Magda G."}

They had a honey butter glaze on top and left me wanting more! Then we had the ceviche and a cup of the peanut butter stew as appetizers. The ceviche had just the right amount of kick and the fish was nice and fresh. The chips were thick and crunchy just how I like! I have to admit I was hesitant on the peanut butter stew but to my delight, it was delicious! It was not like anything I have tried before but the flavor was interesting and tasty. I really liked it. Then for our entres we ordered the ribs and the shrimp & grits. The ribs were perfectly cooked. The meat fell nicely off the bone and the bbq sauce was not too sweet. The coleslaw served with the ribs had a small bit of tang to it and was very good too. The shrimp were plump and also perfectly seasoned and cooked. I have never been a fan of grits but this was my attempt to try them again. I have to say they were cheesy and creamy. I loved the flavor but still don't like the texture of them. But if I was a fan of grits, these would be the best I've ever tried. Then we finished with the lavender cheesecake which was toped with balsamic and fresh strawberries. I have to say, this combination of flavors was amazing! I would ask for less balsamic next time but when you got the right amount with the cheesecake and a strawberry all in one perfect bite, man oh man!!! It was perfect. \n\nThe service was outstanding. Every single person that passed our table smiled and made us feel very welcomed. You can tell that they have high standards of customer service here. Our server was attentive and eager to do a good job. It was obvious he cared about his service and we really appreciated him. Chef Kevin cam to our table a few time. He was the most pleasant man ever. He first came to apologize that the live entertainment had called in sick and so they had to play music off of an ipod. But we assured him that the music perfectly matched the ambiance of the restaurant and that we were still having a wonderful experience. He then came back later to ensure that our food and service were up to par which were without a doubt. \n\nI have to say that this establishment far exceeded my expectations. The fact that the service and food were so great along with the cause that they are supporting makes this place an easy A+++++ in my book. They help at risk youth develop skills in the kitchen as well as performing so that they can make a good life for themselves. It was so incredible when two of the servers shared their stories during dinner on the mic. I was moved and couldn't think of a better place I would want to support with my business. I would recommend this restaurant over and over again! I am even considering buying gift cards for my friends and family to further support this awesome organization.", "author": "Athena S."}

Despite our reservations, we had to wait and when seated, we were given a makeshift table that was wobbly and placed in the middle of a walkway through the restaurant. The service level was inconsistent with the hostess not being very friendly or organized but our waitress demonstrating class and grace throughout service. The owner came out and greeted everyone at the tables and we appreciated his hospitality. Despite these glimmers of positivity, the food was underwhelming. The sweet potato biscuits were flat and dry, the tender ribs drenched in a nondescript sauce, and the blackened salmon dry and garlicky.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-04-11", "description": "There's magic happening in the kitchen at the Old Skool Cafe in the Bay View! The food does not disappoint, including presentation. Think global soul food. Between the two of us we had the Ota (Tongan Fish Appetizer), Kale Salad, Fried Chicken, Peanut Butter Stew and we found a little room at the end for the to die-for Coconut Rice Pudding.  Definitely something good going down in that kitchen!  I'd order it all again, but next time I really want to try the Shrimp and Grits. Portions are generous and prices are fair, in-line with your average nice restaurant menus in SF.\n\nBut that's not all! Pass through the door of the dingy storefront and you step into another place and time.  This is no cafe, it's a 1940's supper club.  Red decor, chandeliers and low-lighting, our glamorous hostess quickly seated us at our table.  The layout of the restaurant is tiered so that every table has a view of the small stage area where local talent (think torch singers) are showcased.  That's right, live entertainment is included in your dining experience. \n\nThe wait staff are engaging and attentive (but not hovering). People who appear to truly enjoy what they do. Our server was the lovely (and also glamorous) T'eema (sp?) who is moving into the front of house operations guided by Romaine the restaurant's savvy Floor Manager and bow tie designer. Chef Kevin comes out to check in with every diner.  We felt special.\n\nIf that's not enough to motivate you to go, know this: Old Skool Cafe is a faith-based, violence prevention program, providing jobs and training to youth, (with an emphasis on at-risk, urban youth) ages 16-22, located in the vibrant neighborhood they serve. Dining here supports this program, the people and the community.\n\nAre there a few rough edges?  Not many.  Another reviewer advises to lock your car doors and don't leave anything visible that might tempt a break-in.  Isn't that true anywhere in the city? Are employees at various levels in their training.  I don't know about you, but I've been there and I'm grateful for the people who were patient and encouraging. Is the decor worth more than my humble home? Probably not.  Do I feel welcomed and cared for? Do I feel like I did something good just by enjoying myself?  Will I go back? Yes, Yes and Yes!", "author": "Pam C."}

The place looks like they should have some great cocktails. No cocktails. Just beer and wine. Strike #1. It took 20 minutes to get served our glasses of wine. Strike #2. I heard great things about the ribs, so I ordered a full rack. 10 minutes later waitress tells me they're out of ribs. Strike #3. Got the fried chicken which was average at best. And frankly pricey. And for some reason my friend's entree arrived 10 minutes after the rest of us. I was actually done eating before she got her plate. Strike #4. Didn't even bother with dessert.

Maybe we visited on an off night, but everything seemed to go wrong almost right from the start. I was so thrilled to see you on \"Check, Please\" and read your glowing Yelp reviews that I invited two friends to dine at Old Skool for their birthdays in October. We had made reservations and were seated promptly, but things quickly went downhill. We all ordered wine to celebrate and it took an unusual amount of time... almost a half hour, before we received them! It's nice to see them so busy so no worries, but there's more... It took over an hour for any of us to receive our entrees and then they all came out at staggered times. The complimentary sweet potato biscuits were delicious, but it only wet our appetites! Old Skool is well-known for their ribs and one of my friends ordered it only be told they were all out several minutes later. My other friend ordered the catfish which was just okay. I couldn't wait to try their infamous fried chicken, but unfortunately, it look another 15-20 minutes after my friends received their entrees before I even got to bite into one! The weird thing is that we noticed other tables who arrived after us had already received their fried chicken entrees. We don't mind paying a little more for a great food and a good dining experience especially for such a worthwhile mission, but unfortunately, we didn't receive either here.

We also go the crispy calamari, french fries, friend chicken and mashed potatoes, and the gumbo and those were all good as well.

Food highlights were the fried chicken, catfish, and gumbo.  The gumbo has plenty of seafood and meat and is pretty filling.  It could probably pass for a main dish if you're not that hungry.  Be sure to tip well.  The food may take awhile since I'm pretty sure these dishes all take awhile to prepare.  But be patient, the service is good and professional, and the staff are all working to do positive things which we all should respect and admire.", "author": "Law C."}

You feel like you've walked into an authentic old fashioned Speak Easy. We have been to Old Skool 5 times now and I should have written a review long ago.  Founder Theresa and Chef Kevin greet guests personally, happy to explain the program and share its success stories. Our initial worries about neighborhood safety were completely unfounded. We have never felt uncomfortable.  (We take Uber to/from the front door where we are greeted at the entrance and escorted out at the end of the night with a hug.) Don't miss the mac and cheese with bacon and andouille sausage, the shrimp and corn fritters, and the ribs. All are exceptional!!", "author": "Wendy R."}

We had a pre fixe dinner, but still had a few options to choose from. I loved the gumbo, but I wish I was given more of it. The seafood was very fresh and i enjoyed the crab. The ceviche was tasty, but way too spicy. even other people in my party, who usually enjoy a lot of spice, said it was too much. Anyway, I really enjoyed myself.

Having lived here for over a year, I've come to appreciate the area as the hood that it is, with all the good and bad elements that come with that.  Old Skool Cafe is an example of just how much good culture always exists just below the grimy exterior. The interior is done in all red and gives an air of a 1920's speakeasy, particularly given that the exterior looks like another apartment building, so be ready to be surprised by the upscale feel once indoors.  The staff is dressed to kill, my advice would be to use the excuse to dress up in you favorite flapper dress or zoot suit to join in the fun.\n\nHalfway through dinner, our waiter spoke on the stage, telling us how Old Skool was his family and more and that the owner had given him an opportunity to get off the street and try to work towards a better life.  Well said, and quite touching.  Afterwards Rebecca gave an absolutely stunning performance singing to old piano pieces, her talent was beyond what I'd seen in almost any venue and after she came over to thank us for being \"so smiley and into the music\".  Our food was a combination of soul dishes tastefully rethought as class acts, and each bite was beyond belief.  Absolutely have the peanut butter stew.\n\nCan't recommend any more heavily.  Come see what Bayview really is and visit Old Skool Cafe, you'll rethink what this neighborhood can be.", "author": "Cody D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-04-01", "description": "I honestly wanted to love Old Skool Cafe. I really... really... REALLY did.\n\nI was trying to find a place to celebrate my birthday. I knew I was going to have a party of about 10 and that I didn't want my friends to spend too much money, but still have a place with great atmosphere and good food. I stumbled on Old Skool Cafe's page on Yelp. Their concept of a supper club run by at risk youth got me. I thought it was a great idea. I was so excited at the thought of contributing to a cause with such a positive message and after reading all the other reviews, elated at the prospect of all the delicious food. I made the reservation and sent out the invites. \n\nI got a call from Old Skool about 5 days prior to my reservation. The girl on the line informed me that because of the size of my party, we would have to do a prix fixe menu, which would be $25 per person and would come with our choice of an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert. I told her that it was no problem, and I also mentioned to her that I would actually be having 13 people and not 10. She told me that they could definitely accommodate and that it wouldn't be a problem as well. \"No problems\" were exchanged, but really... it was only the beginning of all the problems.\n\nI arrived at 7:20 and went inside to talk to the host. We would be seated at 7:30. Good. \nExcept... he asked me right as I was about to turn around and join my friends who were waiting, \"You have a party of 10, right?\" \nTo which I replied, \"No. I have a party of 13.\"\nAfter a couple silent blinks, he kindly told me that he was not aware of the change and that it might take a little more time. I let him know that I spoke to the girl who called to confirm my reservation almost a week ago of the increase, but that I was happy to wait a little longer. He said 15 more minutes. I said okay. If that was the only hiccup of the night, I would have been more than happy with the evening. Unfortunately, it gets worse.\n\nIt was raining outside, and my party was not happy to be standing around. There was no sitting area, so we all had to huddle in a little stoop to avoid getting wet. In all fairness, the rain was obviously not Old Skool's fault, so I shouldn't be upset with them for that. But you can't stop me from being a little unfairly bitter. We finally got seated a little past 8pm. By that time, everyone was so glad to just be able to sit that there were no complaints. \n\nOur server took forever to come and get our first order. I'm talking like 15 minutes before he even came over to our table. And that was only after we asked where he was. To top it off, we didn't have menus until then, either. \"Oh. You guys don't have menus?\" No. We don't. He finally brings over our prix fixe menus, and tells us, AND I QUOTE, \"The menu items are small, so it's more like tapas. They'll be placed anywhere on the table, so everyone just shares everything. It's like family style. Your orders aren't necessarily going to be placed in front of you.\" Okay. So..... let me get this straight. We're all supposed to choose one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert per person, yet they'll be placed anywhere on the table not necessarily in front of whoever ordered the items. That makes no sense. But you know what? Let's just get this show on the road. We're wet and hungry. I just want some food. He take our orders for appetizers and entrees, and says he'll be taking the dessert orders later. We all order a soda, because there was a yelp check in that allowed each person to get one free non-alcoholic drink of our choice.\n\nIt takes FOREVER for the food to come out. We saw tables with smaller parties ALL around us that arrived later than us, getting their orders. Our appetizers literally came to our table one by one. Our reservation was at 7:30, yet the first appetizer to arrive came to our table at 8:45. We had 4 people finished with their first course before the rest of the people got theirs. From the first appetizer until the last, it must have been at least a 30 minute gap. NO JOKE. On top of that, two of the appetizers just never arrived and one person was told they had to pick another one well after everyone was done eating. Our entrees and desserts were the same. Our server never came to check up on us. He was pretty much gone the entire night. I had to literally stand up and go into the kitchen to find him when it was time to take our dessert orders. \n\nOn top of all that, he charged us one extra prix fixe meal and for drinks that we never got. And in the end, they made us pay for 9 of the 12 sodas that we had gotten, because no one ever informed us that the yelp check in was only valid for 3 people per party. The food was mediocre. And in the end, we were there until 10pm. Perhaps it's better with a smaller party? I'll never find out, because I'll never go back. Sorry, Old Skool. I really wanted to like you. I REALLY did. It makes me sad to write such a horrible review, but there's no way around it. I had a horrible time.", "author": "Jeani L."}

Just yesterday, I had dinner at a upscale restaurant in Sonoma and the beet salad there didn't even hold a candle to the one made by Old Skool Cafe! That was even a point of discussion at the table.\n\nThe risotto was fairly bland, also discussed at the table, since all of the other courses were so stellar. I took off one star for that, but put one back on because the kids who served us, plus those who performed (sang, played music, even a little dancing) were just outstanding.

My husband and I along with his co-workers and their spouses had the pleasure of dining at Old Skool this weekend. I loved the ambiance as soon as I walked through the door. The dark jazzy decor and feeling when you walk in was so welcoming as well as were all the employees. 5 stars for ambiance. 5+ stars for the cause and the history of Old Skool. I am a true believer that people can change their lives if they want it and they have someone willing to take a chance on them. To see these young people and hear their stories and what they've overcome and what where they're headed is heart warming. One of the young men got on mic to welcome everyone and he gave his testimony and said to stop any of the busers or servers and ask them their stories if we wanted. We asked our server and she more than happy to stop what she was doing and spend some time talking to us.  5 mouth watering stars for the food! I had Abu's West African Peanut Butter Stew.. OMG, I can't stop thinking about it! Don't be thrown off by peanut butter and stew together, this is a must try! I live about 35min east of Old Skool and I used to drive to Fisherman's wharf for Clam Chowder.. I will be making trips to Old Skool for the PB stew!

It truly is an unforgettable dining experience.\nI came in a group of 5 people. Since it is tapas style, we ordered the following:\npeanut butter stew\nceviche\nblack-eyed pea salad\nshrimp and grits\nmac and cheese with meat\nmac and cheese w/o meat (for our vegetarian)\nsweet potato fries\nlavender cheesecake\nsweet potato pie\n\nThe peanut butter stew was a curry-type of dish. It was amazing--probably my favorite thing on the menu. I also really enjoyed the ceviche. Ceviche is always a tricky dish for restaurants to get right. A lot of places make the flavoring waaay too strong, and I just end up being turned off by all the lime juice and seasoning. I liked Old Skool's version because it wasn't overwhelming. The black-eyed pea salad was different because it was presented in a small plastic glass in the same way the ceviche was presented. I was expecting a leafy salad instead. I don't think I would order it again though because there wasn't anything particularly special about it. \nThe mac and cheese was great. The sweet potato frites were incredible! They were well seasoned and served with two types of dipping sauce: a jalapeno ranch and some kind of orange-colored aioli. The aioli was the best thing I've had in a while. I could dip anything in that and it would taste great. \nThe best food came at the end: dessert! I loved the lavender cheesecake. It was incredibly fragrant, fluffy, and just a well-balanced dish. The sweet potato pie was a favorite among my group. The whipped cream is made by hand and they add 2 shots of espresso while whipping to give it an extra kick. It was so warm and literally melted in my mouth. \n\nFinally, the youth staff were so inspiring. They shared their stories with all the diners that night.

It had the perfect blend of sweet, salty and lavender.   The crust was thick, but still a really good texture.  It was like a soft shortbread.  I really hope one day Old Skool puts out a cookbook because I WANT THAT RECIPE!  The lavender cheesecake needs to stay on the menu please!  It was beautiful in presentation with a flowering of ripe fruits and taste.\n\nAs if that wasn't enough, the staff there was wonderful.  It was our first time to the restaurant, but they made us feel like friends.  Everyone was really fun and easy to talk to. Even the owner came by to hang out with us for a bit. Half way thru the night, the staff started doing impromptu swing dances with the regulars and other staff.  It was so much fun to watch. I hear they have singers, spoken word and formal swing lessons some nights as well. There's such a great energy in the place.  I don't usually talk to people at other tables, but we were talking it up with people around us as well.  \n\nI so love this place, and can't wait to bring more friends.", "author": "beverly l."}

Both times we went it was a really great experience. The last time I went was February we were treated very well and the food is FABULOUS. We met the owner and she was really cool, and we also had the opportunity to meet Chef Kevin. We received 5 star treatment. What I really liked about this place is the cause they support, which is helping inner city teens by giving them a job and giving them a career in the hospitality field. I had the shrimp and grits which was out of this world. I would suggest that if you do go to get reservations if its on the weekend its pretty packed. This place has a romantic flare and very impressive..Everytime we go to the city I will always eat here. This place is worth 5 stars in my book. To all the staff here at Old Skool Cafe keep up the good work!..Oh just a side note. We had a hard time getting a cab to pick us up and they made sure they took care of us and was able to get us a cab. Chef Kevin went above and beyond what is expected of anyone at a restaurant..Like I said their mission statement says it all:\nMission\nOld Skool Caf\u00e9 (OSC) is a faith-based, violence prevention program, providing jobs and training to youth, (with an emphasis on at-risk, urban youth) ages 16-24, at our 1940's styled supper club", "author": "Lee B."}

It's not in the nicest part of town, but once we got in the place had really nice decor, like something out of the 20s with live jazz playing in the background. Service was on the slow side, but  the food was really good. The sweet potato fries were thin, crisp, and addicting paired with the spicy dipping sauce provided. The grits were seasoned\nwell, and the shrimp that came with it were also cooked well. The fried chicken was a little burnt, but it was juicy, crispy and flavored well.

After years of working with at-risk youth as a probation officer and seeing a revolving door of repeat offenders slipping through the cracks, Founder Teresa Goines opened Old Skool Cafe to provide youth with employment opportunities not found anywhere else. But that's not why Old Skool is special - its special because it's the best meal I've had in San Francisco.\n\nThe food really does live up to the hype - it's remarkable and some of the best soul food I've ever had.\n\nService:\nWhile the area is admittedly in transition and somewhat rough around the edges, as soon as I stepped inside Old Skool's doors, I was made to feel welcome. My waiter, one of the restaurant's at-risk youth was attentive. Admittedly sometimes he became distracted by other tables but another server was more than willing to fill in and pick up the paces. \n\nAppetizers \nThe calamari was amazing.  9 times out of 10 at other restaurants, I get calamari that is overcooked or undercooked.  At Old Skool, it was done just right. The sauces for dipping were also excellent. I hate mayo and I am in love with the Thai Basil Aioili. Worth the trip in itself. I never thought I'd say that.\n\nMains\nMacaroni and Cheese. Sorry Mom, you've been outdone. This macaroni had the perfect cheese consistency you always look for. A perfect melted cheese crust on top. I mixed sauteed mushrooms and bacon in mine but there are other choices as well (which I forget at the moment). \n\nDessert\nLavender cheesecake. This is a pure winner. I love cheesecake and have a high standard here. This one delivered. The lavender was not overpowering and the graham cracker crust was crispy and done just right.", "author": "Alex G."}

I even had to amend the number (add more), and they gladly accommodated, adding another table to an already large table and making room for the servers to be able to reach everyone.  We kept ordering throughout our time there--probably a nightmare for the kitchen and waitstaff, but they handled it graciously.\n\nFavorite dishes: Abu's West African stew, ceviche, shrimp and grits, sweet potato fries.  I don't normally like beef/burgers but had some of the Grexican burger (2 x slider size) = tasty.  There are now free refills of the drinks, which makes the $3 charge worth it.  Panna cotta dessert is cool, refreshing, and just sweet and creamy enough.\n\nI love this place and can't wait to go back.

This is a non-profit restaurant that employs, trains, and mentors at risk youths. These young people manage the restaurant as well as cook and serve the food. These jobs pay them a real wage, teach them good skills, empowers them to be responsible and productive, and builds their self-esteem and sense of self. The alternative would be that many of these youths would be in and out of juvenile facilities and going down a bad road with little light at the end of heir tunnels. The passionate, charismatic, and engaging founder, Teresa Goines, spent a good 20 minutes sharing her vision and story about how this exciting concept came to be. 8 months later...things are going well and hopefully they will garner increasing support every week. \nThe menu consists of tapas sized dishes of southern comfort food (buttermilk fried chicken, creole shrimp on top of grits, gumbo, baby back ribs, red velvet lava cake, sweet potato pie, etc...). The food is good and flavorful overall 4 stars for overall food). The 2 dishes we would pass on next time are the fried calamari (rings were too small and over fried) and the blackened catfish.

It's a supper club and is run by youth as a violence prevention program, so it's nice that it is all going to a great cause as well.  Oh, and there was live entertainment - Rebecca & Marcel that night - which set a nice ambiance.", "author": "Suzanne J."}

I had the grilled cheese and tomato soup, which was perfectly adequate, although lacking in temperature. I noticed that a lot of people in my party experienced their food being kinda cold, which was annoying. The service was pretty slow and we had to repeat ourselves frequently, but everyone was just as nice as can be. The kids working here are definitely learning their way through the business, so I applaud them at having positive attitudes the entire time.

It is a great thing that they are doing there, helping at risk youth by giving them job training.  The space is a very fun retro supper club - red leather, dark wood & chandeliers.  The jazz trio is very good - though a bit loud for the small space.  The service is very friendly if a bit unpolished.  The wine list is pretty limited.  All that is forgiven though because of the food.  The food is really good.  We had the peanut butter stew & gumbo as an appetizer, both were good, but we both enjoyed the peanut butter stew more.  We shared the full rack of ribs and the two of us could not finish it, so we were happy to have some to take home with us.  We then had the lavender cheesecake for dessert.

Yesterday I held a dinner party for 17 people there and it was a wonderful experience! I had no trouble organizing seating for such a large group and the staff was extremely helpful with the entire process. Though groups of 10 or more must choose from a three-course set menu, the food was only $25 before tax and tip and the restaurant doesn't require a holding price for large groups. The food was good and the live entertainment created a great ambiance. The best part about this restaurant is its mission of helping at-risk youth improve their lives through employment opportunities. It was touching to see how hard these young adults worked and how passionate they are about this nonprofit restaurant. Despite some of the misconceptions that people have about the Bayview, the area in which the restaurant is located is easily accessible through the MUNI T train, has ample parking, and is well lit. I felt pretty safe there. I will definitely return to Old Skool Cafe and I am very appreciative to the staff for making my dinner party a success!", "author": "Astrid H."}

It's a triple threat of a restaurant in the sense that it's helping the community by teaching valuable skills and providing jobs for our youth who would otherwise be on the streets, it provides entertainment and ambiance in an area you'd least expect it, and to top it off the food is really good! Not only do you leave satiated, you also leave inspired. Our awesome waiter, Dominic, not only had a fabulous personality, but had the courage to stand and speak in front of the entire restaurant to tell his story. You can't help but feel touched and motivated by these young kids. The smart seating arrangement is staged so that everyone has a view.

The food here is pretty legit, starting with really good cheesy grits, warm and well seasoned (although I read 1 or more reviews wishing it was more straight grits, which I think is a valid point).  The fried chicken was excellent, and one of my friends said it was the best he had ever had, a little cayenne to taste without being overwhelmed with seasoning and not at all greasy.  As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of french toast, I tried theirs as an after-thought and it made me regret not getting it sooner, as it has a perfect blend of sweet creaminess on the inside with a little crisp on the edges.  Strangely, they even served Taiwanese sticky rice which, although a little dried out from sitting out for a while, had all the right flavoring aside from missing the usual sprinkling of cilantro.  The fried catfish and collard greens were alright, and I wish the cheddar biscuits and cornbread had been warm; I heard that the thick slices of bacon were really good.  The joint is essentially staffed from cooks to servers entirely by at-risk youth, which makes you feel good about coming to the hood for Sunday brunch, and the $25/head for buffet seems like a small price to pay to help these kids stay on their feet.", "author": "Gene C."}
