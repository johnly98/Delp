The service was atrocious.  We ordered things that never came and every time we checked on the item (chicken wings) we were told the order went in but in reality it only went in after about an hour when a new waitress took over our table.\n\nWhen we got our first check from the waitress who was closing out it did not com itemized.  We only found out from the second waitress that tip had already been included because they charge mandatory tip for 4 or more guests.  So we essentially double tipped on items we didn't receive.  It took us a long time to sort it out with the 2nd waitress. \n\nI've got a pet peeve about bars who charge $8 for a beer and then serve it in a cheater pint.  We didn't notice until my wife ordered a 12 oz beer and it nearly filled the entire glass.  When i asked how big the pints were they responded \"Everyone else is doing it so we do it too\".  Umm....what about integrity? What about giving a F for your customers.  I would take my business to any of the other great beer bars on Haight street before i came back here.\n\nOne star for the bar tender who felt so bad for all that we went through and comp'd a couple of beers.", "author": "Jay D."}

I had apartments in areas including the Western Addition, the Tender-Nob, the Panhandle, SOMA, Upper Terrace/Buena Vista and of course, the Lower Haight, about two doors down from Mad Dog's).  I was very social and ate out, went out for drinks, etc. frequently. I went out a LOT back then and people would kind of look to me to lead the evening's festivities. No matter what part of the city I was in at the time, the Marina, North Beach, Noe Valley, etc. I  knew just where to go. But, at a certain point in the evening I would almost always get everyone to jump into a cab or take a bus back across town to close out the night at Mad Dog's. Never a dull moment - never had a bad or even disappointing time there. I felt like people should scream out, \"Norm!\" to me when I walked in. LOL.  And I was always bringing a bunch of friends with me and meeting new ones there...friends I still have to this day. (Even though I am \"trapped\" way up here in Portland now. Sigh). \nI can say, without fear of contradiction that for me, out of all the fancy restaurants, bars, pubs, etc. Mad Dog's was the place I loved the most. So many memories...a million great night's out and always, always amazing people - both the staff and the crowd. I can't remember a bad time.  People were always up for a game of darts or watching a football game in the morning, or hanging out in the grass patio out back on sunny Summer afternoons...I do not miss the long line to the women's restroom on a Saturday night, (LOL) but, I always, always had an amazing time. Everyone I ever met there was so positive and fun. Mad Dog's had the hottest English, Irish and Scottish guys, too.  I admit they were a big draw for me...LOL ;-) I sorely miss the Snake Bites, Black & Tans and of course, the food.  My favorite was the English cheddar and bacon muffin sandwich or the Banger's and Mash. (No Spotted Dick for me, thanks)...\nWhen friends and family - or hell, even total strangers, would tell me they were planning a trip to the city I would regale them with local non-tourist places they should try- depending on what kind of food or beverage or mood they were in and the neighborhood, etc. And Mad Dog's was always a \"you must-visit\" on my referrals to them.\nI still have my \"Mad Dog in the Fog\" green and white footballer's jersey that I bought and wore into the ground. Being a big foodie and having worked as in TV advertising and worked as a television producer for my profession. And a lot of our clients were San Francisco-based restaurants, bars and five star hotels. I wrote and directed many, many restaurant and bar commercials (TV spots) within the city. Unfortunately, Mad Dog's was not one of them, but I never hesitated to tell anyone that would listen that it was hands-down my favorite bar in the city. Because of my job, I was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to experience a wide variety of places, cuisines, pubs, bar, etc. in every possible neighborhood, nook and cranny of the city, i.e. if you want a kick-ass cappuccino, you go the Steps of Rome in North Beach. If you want a romantic dinner with the most succulent roast chicken, you go to Zuni Caf\u00e9. If you love escargot you can either go to La Brasserie Francaise (I think it is shut now), or my personal preference, John's Grill. Cajun ? P.J's Oyster Bed.  Sushi? Duh - everyone knows you go to Yoshi's in Oakland. Period.  Business lunch or dinner in the financial district? Gotta go to Palio d'Asti (an order the Mezzeluna Monneferrina - sorry if I spelled it wrong -  if it is still on the menu). \n But, if you want to just lift a pint with your buds or even have an amazing, guaranteed night out with a date or a pack of friends, you definitely MUST head to Mad Dog's. \nI am so stoked to see it is still alive and kicking and would give my left eye to be back there in the city, sharing a pint in the fog So, for what it's worth, I dedicate these words to you, such as they are, I honor and deeply miss you, from a very homesick ex-pat. I also want to \"give a shout out\" to the current owners and past proprietors of Mad Dog's,  its loyal fans who know exactly what I am talking about, and  of course, to the city I still stubbornly call home.  I will solemnly and with great reverence raise my glass to you: Long may you live. Mau the wind always be at your back, and your doors and hearts always be open.  With all my love...

For those of you not from SF this means it is not in the Haight-Ashbury area, despite its being on Haight the bar is a good 1 mile / 20min walk from Haight-Ashbury. They take credit cards but the last time I went their card machine was broken so I would recommend bringing cash just in case. \n\nThe bar itself is clean and spacious not cramped or overly divey. They have multiple large flatscreen TVs showing sports. They have some of their own signature beers available as well as your standard domestics, imports, along with some less common microbrewery beers, and a kitchen with your usual pub grub. They have a nice pool table but it is right by the front entrance so sometimes if you are playing and taking a shot on the far side of the table you are blocking people entering and leaving the bar by standing in doorway.  \n\n+1 star: Nice pool table.\n+1 star: Clean overall!\n+1 star: They have a very spacious outdoor brick patio in the back. \n\n-1 star: Two of the beers on tap I got were completely flat\n-1 star: A bit pricey ~$7-9 per beer + tip and your money starts to go fast", "author": "Tomas K."}

However, this review is a testament to how AWFUL mad dog in the fog's service was. \nThe \"waitress\" or \"bus lady\" or whatever she does is the devil reincarnated. I have never had someone be so rude to me at a sports bar before. She seemed so unhappy with her life that she made me want to quit my job to train to be an astronaut like I have always wanted to be... I mean seriously though. As a customer that is spending $50+ on food and drinks, I should not have any thoughts that my waitress isn't about to go on a psychotic episode and shoot up the place. This is how rude and unhappy she presented herself the entire 2+ hours I was there. \n\nJust one example for her devilish approach to waiting on a table (there were plenty of examples but I have a life to attend too):\nI received my burger. It did not have any cheese on it. So I kindly asked for cheese. She told me that I did not order cheese and that it was an extra charge. I told her that I had no problem paying extra for cheese. She then proceeded to tell me that since I ordered my food from the bartender, I had to propose my problem to him...\n\nSo I sat there quietly while she took the order from my 4 friends sitting at the table with me.\n\nOnce she was done with taking their orders, she looked at me (with those possessed devil eyes) and said, \"Ohhhh.... SO you're not even going to eat the burger without cheese or what?\"\n\nI looked up and reiterated to her that she told me that I had to go up to the bartender to propose my problem. I did not want to get up rudely while she was taking my friends order so I decided to wait until she was through....\n\nShe then said \"FINE. I will go get your cheese. Does cheddar work?\" At this point, I am speechless. I just nod my head with a small inclination of agreement. My friend finally says what I have been itching to say the whole time \"Excuse me but why do you have to be so rude about this cheese thing?\" He just wants a piece of cheese on his burger.\"\n\nShe proceeded to ignore this comment completely and came back with a piece of cheese 10 minutes later. \n\nI will NEVER come back here to eat food. I will also never order a drink for the devil reincarnated even if it means I wait 30 minutes for the bartender. \n\nThis was a very mind blowing experience. After reading all of the reviews below, I question the ownership of this bar. It seems I am not the only person who has had the unpleasure experience of meeting the worst server in human existence. \n\nADVISE TO OWNERSHIP, there are a few 100,000 people in the bay area that could do a 10x better job than this girl is doing. Also, she is clearly unhappy. She will probably leave willing if you just bring it up.\n\nGet her out of there so the food experience can be more enjoyable.\nThis place has amazing potential.\n\nEnd of rant.", "author": "Andrew W."}

First, and real quick, did you also notice that most of the high-rating reviews say something to the effect of \"I only went here once\" (or implying some other number that can be counted on one hand)? Huh. Anyway, the reason for that preliminary exercise was so you could take in some patron reviews.\n\nI'm not a patron of Mad Dog in the Fog. I'm one of their unfortunate neighbors.\n\nAsk anyone who lives on that block, or in the buildings behind them. They'll tell you the same -- Mad Dog in the Fog runs their own little banal microcosm of beer-fueled stupidity with no regard to the people and places around them.\n\nThey hold really random hours which seem dictated by how much of a nuisance they can be. I was woken up at 7:00a this morning to the staff and early morning boozehounds SCREAMING at a soccer match.\n\nThey allow their patrons to ignore the smoking ordinance, but then whine and gripe about any of their neighbors smoking out back.\n\nWhen the Giants won the World Series, it was Mad Dog's customers that trashed the street and nearly obliterated Memphis Minnie's work vehicle. They did nothing to keep their customers in check and, to my knowledge, never offered to help Memphis Minnie's with repairs (while the rest of the neighborhood did).\n\nIt's great that so many people want to visit the bar during the big sports games... and this somehow grants Mad Dog the divine providence to start an entry line that completely blocks flat and storefront entryways.\n\nAny attempt to talk with the place about a peaceful coexistence is met with a shit-eating grin. Some of their closer neighbors have reported hearing them bitch about it later as they clean the back patio.\n\nAnd the list could continue. But this is already at TLDR length.\n\nWith trivia night excluded, which seems to be the nights where Mad Dog sees the most sanity, it seems like a good place to shut off your brain, start some screaming matches over whatever, and hit on anything with a pulse. If that's your thing, then godspeed.\n\n[EDIT]: Since writing this review a year ago, the bar has spiraled out of control. Their patrons continue to trash the block, they've had SFPD visit them on noise complaints, and their owner was seen tossing street items into the building above.

Oh, it was divey. And if you weren't a regular, you got an honest-to-goodness Irish stare from those who were. But in its divey-ness it certainly didn't disappoint.\n\nWord on the street was that they had a remodel take place. Probably the old word on the street, but finding myself back in SF and with a little time before dinner at the BBQ joint a few doors down I popped my head in again to check the work. Wowza. Is this the same place? It needed more verification, so this time I popped my whole body in and we bellied up to the bar. I wasn't drinking, but the other two in the group got an Irish something-or-other (beer ain't my strong suit-deal with it) on tap, and a glass of white wine. You can guess how this ends. Beer=yay. Wine=shoulda stuck with beer. It's a pub, for crying out loud. It's like getting pork links at a Jewish Deli. I mean, it's not exactly their strong suit. \n\nThe remodel looks great. Much better lighting, much lighter in general. I never knew there was a back patio, but it looked delightful to go hang out. A much more mainstream crowd now, so if you have your fill of bars with \"character\" (see also: Toronado across the street) you can come here for a brew. There are a few coolers with bottles of some harder-to-find suds for the beerventurous.\n\nThere's plenty of personality left over, but now with a more welcoming atmosphere and staff. Stick with the beer (I didn't taste the food) and grab a booth, sit on the patio, or belly up to the bar.", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

As we were putting on our jackets, the bartender finally came over to us to apologize for \"abandoning\" us and offered us a drink on the house.

The service was non-existent and the food was not worth the wait or price. \n    \n    The service:\nWe walked in a little after 4pm and it was hot and muggy inside, a few people at the bar, they kind of looked like regulars and nobody acknowledged us until we walked up to the bar. I was unaware the kitchen didn't open until 5pm (my mistake) but we got a pitcher and the boys played billiards until we could order. The bartender told me the server would come around when we could order, which did not happen. When I finally went back up to the bar she sent the server over. We ordered 3 apps(guac and chips, potato chips and onion rings) and 4 entrees ( 2 fish and chips, 1 house salad and a grilled chicken sandwich) It took this place over an hour to get our food and it was incomplete. We ended up leaving before or 3rd appetizer (potato chips) made its way out and told them to give our 4th app to the people at the bar because we had a concert we needed to get to and could no longer wait.\n \n   The food:\nThe fish and chips were greasy and the fries were soggy. My salad just looked like someone opened a bag of greens and put it on a plate and the grilled chicken sandwich which took the longest to come out was pounded so thin (don't know why) it was barely an inch thick and it was drier than sand. \n\nThe most annoying part of it all was that we had to keep flagging them down to get any attention (a problem \"the regulars\" sitting at the bar didn't seem to have). A few times we looked over the staff looked bored and the server may even have had a drink at one point. When we tried to get our check it took them another 5 min to box our onion rings! They told us one of the ovens had broken down that morning and had we known that before we ordered we would've cut back on our order.

Free space with tables has been replaced by booths and all of the English flags, national scarves, and footie jersies have been taken down. The place has been turned into a typical yuppie-friendly Irish bar...  as if we don't have enough of those...  And I just want to say for the record that if an English person bought an Irish pub and did the same nobody would shut up about it.  Disgusting.\n\nI can't stand watching games at this spot anymore because it's worse than getting a root canal.  Everyone's talking, debating stats to prove how \"die hard\" they are, and trying to get laid so you can't even watch in peace.  The separate room has been removed to accommodate a pool table, so you can't even watch replays in peace or get away from all the nonsense.  There are much better options for drinks and catching matches...  The owner also owns Kezar pub, which to me is actually a far better option of the two, though not the only options in the city.\n\nAnd now for my rant...  Footie has only in recent years started being televised in US.  Years back, folks had to pay to watch in a pub and do the best they could to keep updated on teams via online or newspapers which was difficult at best.  When I was going to pubs and paying to watch, the place was filled with Euros and Brits, so any American who tries to tell me they're a \"die hard\" fan for years is full of bollocks and I mean no disrespect in saying this, it's just the truth.

It happens on Tuesdays and Thursdays at nine(ish). You get with a group, and are given pieces of papers on where you must write your (carefully selected and witty) team name. There are seven rounds of eight questions each. First is general knowledge (easy). You'll have a current affairs round, a picture round where you are given a piece of paper with pictures of people that you need to name, a music round where you need to name the artist (think name that tune, but just the artist) and other trivia. Some questions are very easy, some are very hard. There are breaks between every 2 rounds and scores are read periodically. The winning team gets $30; the runner up gets a pitcher of beer. It's fun times.\n\nBeer selection: great. GOod selection of stuff on tap, but then they've also got a lot of rare and special beers in bottles. If you are a beer fan or snob, you are going to love their beer menu.\n\nEverything else about this place gets two stars in my book. It's just nothing very special. If you order food here, make it bar food to munch on (wings, fries) and don't plan on coming for dinner.\n\nMy friends came last week for pre-trivia dinner. We were there before 8. Maybe 7:45? We ordered a few burritos and a sandwich and they came well after 9pm, after several \"just five minutes guys...\" It was just a few burritos.

Even bar food is supposed to be tasty. It's bad for you! How hard can it be?\n\nOn top of that, we were sitting outside. Then someone came and turned the lights out and said the patio was closed. Which no one had told us before. Then they said they'd turn the lights back on and we could stay. Then someone else came and told us it was closed. Now we were in the dark and still waiting 45+ minutes for our food.\n\nThe staff was nice, though, and our very sweet waitress managed to snag us a booth inside once it opened up so we could finally get our food (1.5 hours later?) and could stay there for trivia night.\n\nCome for a beer, but not to eat.", "author": "Courtney A."}

We walked in, sat down, ordered beers, and started eating. NOTE: We hadn't been in here in the past 6 months, before they remodeled and started serving food. No one was eating at the bar and we didn't get menus so we had no idea they even had food there. Also, we'd brought food in here before without a problem. \n\nSeveral minutes later, an extremely agitated looking and sounding Irish guy asks us, \"What is this guys? What is this?\" We look at each other a bit confused. When we ask what's wrong, he points to us and says \"What the hell do you think you're doing?\" Ok, what?? Then he points specifically to my friend's burrito and says this is a restaurant, and goes on a tirade on how dare we bring food into a San Francisco restaurant. \n\nAt this point, we're just a little taken aback, (still completely sober) and dumbfounded. We apologized and said we didn't realize. We suggested we could leave and come back, or order some food they had. We asked him what thought. His response? Shaking his head and storming away from the table. Um, what? Yes, it was our mistake. Yes, we shouldn't had assumed. Yes, we apologized a few times. Yes, we really did want to resolve this. \n\nBut clearly the irate leprechaun clearly didn't want to resolve it, accept our apology, or consider it a misunderstanding. Instead, he came back to our table a second later with an angry disposition...but no clear solution. So when my friend said, \"Look, we're sorry, but this was unintentional. Is there a way we can resolve this like adults?\" Apparently, that made him completely lose it and he replied with, \"I don't like your attitude and get the F out of my bar!\" \n\nWow. Not sure how many other times I'd been kicked out of a bar while stone sober and no yelling (on our side.) Our friend walked outside, and my other two friends and I calmly cleaned up and followed him out. Again, we weren't angry, just dumbfounded this little misunderstanding couldn't be resolved. \n\nBottom line: we made a mistake on our part, a silly misunderstanding that could have been resolved, but it was clear the bartender, owner, whatever--instead was honestly looking for a fight. So he kicked us out in a dramatic fashion and got his way. \n\nMaybe he had a bad night. Maybe he had a bad morning. Or maybe he just wanted to exert his \"power\" on someone. Well, he did and I hope he's satisfied. I just hope he realizes there are far more sports bars in SF that we don't have to risk dealing with a moody asshole when trying to resolve an issue.", "author": "Kelly R."}

Luckily for me, my team- The Bush Doctrine is Not a Grooming Decision- comprised of stunningly intellectual individuals. \n\nWhile drinking beer with my teammates, I was informed about Mad Dog's reputation for having .75 cent sex toys in the ladies bathroom. Despite them being unreliable and more than likely to finish before I do, I reminded them that it sounds like most of the boyfriends I've had, so it's not like I would be any MORE disappointed than I have been in the past.\n\nHowever, when the quiz was fully underway I found myself engrossed in trying to figure out the answers, screaming and shouting, smiling and cursing, and everything in between. \n\nThen came my moment. \n\nWhen I ride the elevator up to my floor, I read the television screen's \"Top Headlines\" or snippets from them. It's a nice way to be informed of our failing economy and a reason of why we should all panic. Yesterday I happened to glance at the screen that said, \"Two Americans Released Today from Syria\". Hm, whatever. \n\nThis time, not whatever. Suddenly, they called out the trivia question: \"What country released two journalists today?\" My group stared at each other and shrugged their shoulders. SYRIA. SYRIA. WRITE SYRIA. I was going insane, and unable to contain my excitment. \n\nWhen the answers were finally read, I think we were the only ones in the bar to get that answer right. High fives, fist bumps, and more drinking led to the end of an amazing night with friends. Also, I was drunk, so of course it was amazing. \n\nOut of the +10 teams that played, we came in 3rd place. I'd like to thank Syria for that. \n\n4 stars because, despite pub quiz night and their beer leaving nothing else to be desired, the patio was pitch black, and one of my friends almost went head-first into the urinal from lack of your even flooring. Then again, the patio at night would make for a great first-date spot if you were set up on a blind date. \n\nI will be back, and this time, Syria had better release two more people, because that's my answer and I'm sticking to it.", "author": "Jaime L."}

Well, not stupid, really, but stupidesque.  I waved at a random group of people who were entering the bar, and as they approached, their youngish-looking ringleader came up to our table and introduced himself.  At this point, I was completely convinced that he thought he knew me or something, because he ended up buying the birthday girl a beer and introducing his entire crew, which included someone's parents and the son of the guy who played Colonel Sandurz in Spaceballs--seriously, I'm not making this stuff up.\n\nSome of my birthday-get-together colleagues were also beginning to believe I had orchestrated this social experiment, but I quickly had my self-confidence dashed when I learned that someone (we'll call him \"Granger\") had actually just called or texted this ringleader, so his group was technically coming to see someone in our group, though only tangentially.\n\nI got business cards from a restaurant on Mission Street in Bernal Heights that I may or may not ever visit, and everyone seemed to enjoy themselves until the bartenders began executing last call rather abruptly and college-librarily.  (If you don't know what I mean, please don't ask.  Just think about it for a few minutes.)\n\nMad Dog in the Fog doesn't know what it wants to be.  Is it a sports bar?  Not really, although it thinks it is.  But I believe there's a bylaw somewhere that requires sports bars to serve liquor, and this place is a beer-and-wine place, so there's that.  And a wine bar?  Really?  With pool tables?  In the front?  Who's ever heard of pool tables in the front?\n\nThey have live music some weekdays, and the bartender was very nice when I came in a few days later looking for my lost umbrella.

Another one of my friends also asked and he once again refused.\n\nAt this point we all decided to leave and walk down the street to Danny Coyles, which not only had the game on, but had the commentary and a friendly atmosphere.\n\nI heard from several other friends they had the same thing happen when watching the USA vs. El Salvador game.\n\nThen last night I thought about giving the place another chance. I had to meet a friend that lived next door and I went to watch the MLS Cup final there.  I was on my cell phone talking with my friend from New York about the game and asked the bartender for a beer.  She ignored me several times and then finally she told me she would not serve me because I had been on my cell phone at the bar.   \n\nI asked her if she was serious.  She said she thought it was rude and would not serve me.  So once again I said goodbye, left, and was warmly welcomed and offered a beer no problem at Danny Coyles.\n\nWell at least i will never have to say goodbye to the holier-than-thou bartenders at Mad Dog cause I'm never setting foot in that \"footie\" bar again.  \n\nAnd hello Danny Coyles", "author": "Douglas Z."}

Trivia night and big sporting events. \n\nI do love trivia (and so do my friends). It's pretty organized and casual here and they don't rush you so you can just spend time between rounds just hanging out with your friends. You have to get there pretty early if you want to snag a booth but they do cover the pool tables and add some of the outdoor chairs. I've only been on Thursday night, but I've heard that Tuesday is a little easier. \n\nSO MANY TVS. If you want to go to a fun sports bar, packed with people but still have a good shot of actually watching the game, this is the place to be. We went for the final game of the World Cup and it was INSANE. At capacity, but we stood at the bar and from where I was at 5'4\" I could see at least three tv screens clearly and the large projector.

However, since I waited until after my second visit, I am afraid that rating gets lowered to 3 stars. I discovered the Mad Dog in the Fog at the http://www.packerseverywhere.com/ site. So, I thought going there for watching the Packers play would be fun. When I went for the season opener on September 4th, I had a great time. Service was, for the most part, wonderful, except being given the wrong credit card when paying up. This, thankfully, was quickly remedied, as I did want my card back, and didn't want to charge a stranger's card for my food and drinks. Anyway, so I was willing to come back, and I did. However, Mad Dog on game day Sundays is a madhouse! It's standing room only, and eventually, Jules, the bartender began ignoring me or was too busy to check on me, or something, because I waited a good *TWENTY* minutes for service that never came. Now, I have to say she did start out serving me, but it wasn't until I made a trip to the restroom that I was ignored. I have to wonder how attentive she was anyway as somebody's cash, not sure if it was a tip, or cash for a drink, was laying on the bar the entire time I was there. After having awesome onion rings on the 4th, the cheese fries I had on the 14th were somewhat disappointing, to be perfectly honest.\n\nAdd to it I couldn't even hear the Packers game...being totally blind, I can't watch from a distance. So, after that *AND* being ignored, I left and went across the street. That, however is another review. Needless to say, I will never go back to Mad Dog alone.

I went back last night (Saturday) and ordered a half pint (although I really think it was a 12 oz) and the price? $2. I think pints were $3. Just didn't want that much. Nice to see somethings dont change. \n\n2 pool tables, great bartender (Jules), and nice Pub atmosphere. Lots of booths and bar seating. Nice smokers lounge in the back if you partake, and nice beer, etc selection. Cash Only I believe. \n\nStill a super cool spot to chill 18 years later.\"", "author": "Adam X."}

Somewhere you can enjoy a breeze and some natural light in the noon-5pm hours without being stuck in a dank hole of a bar, or crammed into Zeitgeist's yard with two hundred people. \n\nMad Dog is overlooked in this regard, I think. Most people don't think of them as a back-patio kind of bar, but rather a sports-watching bar or a pool playing bar, or a pub trivia kind of place. This may have something to do with its rather dark interior (despite ceilings of a stunningly beautiful height) or the sportsy crowd or something. Because every time I've been in the patio on a nice Sunday afternoon, it's not been too crowded (surprisingly, in light of its small size.) The patio is mostly shielded from the elements by back-of-the-lot lofts, and the proximity to Cafe International feels friendly and warm. That, combined with tasty beers and board games that actually have all the pieces, is the recipe for a kickin' Sunday.", "author": "Megan W."}

Because by 9 P.M., when they started the Trivia portion (which I was told started at 7 p.m.), I was tanked. Wasted. Useless. Falling asleep in my ever-so-butt-mangling heavy wooden stool that could be used as a torture device on anyone lacking sufficient meat on their ass bones. \n\nThis place is far from bad. In fact, Matt Capital r and I were observing just how yuppy-friendly it's become. Cheers to that and to the fresh coat of paint and the cozy patio and the framed prints on the walls. But no thank you to the stools that have made sitting on anything but an inflatable donut a non-option for me today. It's also a sports bar, with around 6 screens that are suspended high enough that non-sports fans can totally ignore them and forget about the sports component altogether.\n\nTheir happy hour specials included a $3.50 Stella, $3 pear cider, and some $1-off coupons for budweiser beverages, which Classy Chewie took full advantage of but the rest of us only turned our noses up at. The bar staff here are pleasant and attractive and the patrons are decidedly un-lower-Haight, in my opinion. Cleaner than the Toronado crowd and less rowdy than some other venues in the area, this is a bar I'd come back to if I happen to be in the neighborhood and I find myself in need of alcoholization. \n\nWith TONS of takeout joints in the surrounding block, you will never go hungry at Mad Dog. And if you're a smoker, they'll let you light up in the back. Thanks, fellow Touched By An Uncle teammates. We went. We saw. We didn't win. But we did get touched.

Just like Sassy's House of Love!!! Except that my studio is about the size of a coffin, I've lived there for four months and haven't attempted to decorate it, and I'm fresh out of beer.\n\nThe second time I came to Mad Dog, I brought my hippie Yosemite transplant for a few drinks and a game of Connect Four. Half the pieces were missing, so we pulled out the Girl Scout skills (I actually never made it to Girl Scouts. Bona fide Brownie for two whole years bitches!!!) and doctored up some game pieces out of bits of torn up coasters. The place was a little dead and space-out inducing, but I still enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and laid back patrons.\n\nThird time I came to Mad Dog I had two things on the mind: Sleeping pills and trivia. Because I arrived at 7 p.m. with my game face on, and the festivities didn't begin until 9 p.m., I ended up cutting out early to partake in the former. I would have liked to stare blankly at the trivia host while my team mates shrieked wrong answers all around me, but my bed was beckoning me....loudly....I could it hear it calling my name.....and then I woke up; nose blowing bubbling in my Stella like a freaking snorkel, and I knew it was time to take the fuck off.\n\nGood place, four blocks from my coffin, reasonable drink prices, a charming jasmine-smelling patio, and friendly, hot-accented bartenders.", "author": "Sammy S."}

Good thing the trivia wasn't until 9 (well, advertised as 9, time is a little fuzzy, but I'm pretty sure it didn't actually get started until around 4am. or thereabouts). Gave me plenty of time to prepare my brain with the required ethanol. Other than having a great time meeting some new people, I rate this bar as Pretty Standard.

They had damn-good bangers-n-mash that complimented the rest of their food menu.  Unfortunately, the food is gone now... so you can't really call it a pub anymore; it's a beer and wine bar... no liquor.\n\nThe original owner made sure this place was as authentic as you can get a British pub in the US, but the new owners haven't kept up the pace.  The problem seems to stem from the new owner treating this place like a stepchild; he has another bar that gets more of his attention.  Nowadays, the Mad Dog is often used as a warehouse for the new stuff that will go in the other bar.\n\nOne other problem I've encountered here is that one of the new bartenders doesn't understand that the word 'football' means 'soccer' in a British pub; as a result, she changes the channel to American football games on Sunday, despite the fact English football games are rerun at that time per the information on the sidewalk chalkboard and the phone match rerun hot line.\n\nThe final straw for me was when I was bothered at the bar by some shady-lookin' dude that wanted to give me a lighter if he could scan my drivers license into his hand held computer.  I thought the 'No Solicitors' sign at the front door would keep scum like this out, but bartender in charge didn't see this as a problem and allowed him to continue harassing her patrons.

I was wandering around the haight on a sunday and wanted to watch the redskins game, so i ducked in here. It was pretty empty and there was plenty of space and a decent beer selection, which is the only reason it gets 2 stars.\n\nIt took us about 20 minutes to get a tv station changed. Not because there were multiple requests, not because o one wanted it to be changed, not because the bartenders were busy. I know people are enamored with this bartender but my god I think the guy has a serious case of ADD. Should not be a bartender. We'd ask him to change a tv to the game, he'd say \"yeah, ok\" and then disappear for 10 minutes, and then come back and sort of stand there like \"oh,  guess I'll just chill out.\" We seriously thought he was playing some prank on us, or didn't want the redskins game to be played. but no, he just forgot. so we asked again. This happened about three times before he finally got the remote out and changed the station - we missed the kickoff. we were kinda pissed.\n\nThis is a sports bar... they have several flatscreens that are NICE. good seats to view them. but more than one were on blue screens for several minutes when I knew there was a good game that could be showing. \n\nfurther evidence that this guy was a little ADD - he left a tap running for about a minute, I watched about two full glasses of beer run over the top of a glass while he was down at the other end of the bar having a conversation with a friend. Another time, he left a guy's full beer just sitting there while that guy just waited and waited for it, and the bartender wasn't even serving someone else, he was counting cash. weird! \n\nI think there's a reason this place was empty. weird vibe. seemed like everyone was there for the first time, except for a few rude and obnoxious regulars. won't be returning.", "author": "Rachel D."}

Cheap beer, outside patio, good pub atmosphere, trivia night, pool tables and sports on TV.  Oh, and the biggest reason I go there, the two dartboards.\n\nWell Mad Dog recently did some major renovations.  They ripped out a couple walls that used to form a small room with a pool table at the front and opened up the space.  They replaced the tables with booths, put mirrors on the wall, added some mood lighting and mounted some nice LCD TVs on the walls.\n\nIn general, the remodeling looks nice, although it somewhat takes away from the pub/dive bar feel that I actually liked on a cold foggy night, and it can get a bit cold in there now that there is no long hallway to keep the cold air out.  I could do without the booths, they seem a little off.\n\nBut the BIGGEST sin of all.  They removed the dartboards!!!!  They plan to move the bar down and when they do that, the area where the dartboards used to be won't exist anymore.  Up until this travesty, I would have given Mad Dog 5 stars for sure.  Now, without the Dart Boards, I have to knock them way down.  It's hard enough to find a decent place to play darts in the city, now I can't think of any place in Lower Haigh, Divis or Upper Haight that has a board.  The only options are to go to Kilowatt and play on their horrible boards which can't hold a dart half the time, or head to the Inner Sunset or Geary.  \n\n2 stars may be a little harsh, but I just don't see myself going there because now it is just another sports bar with pool tables and the atmosphere is different.  Trivia night may be the only draw left for me, they better not get rid of that or I'll have to update my review and knock it down to 1 star.\n\nSuch a dissappointment....", "author": "Bill K."}

It might as well have been any old sports bar, it doesn't deserve the name pub. Pubs don't let pubs play basketball, baseball, handball (American football) or hockey on the telly *IF* there is a football (soccer) match being aired. (Psst: If there's no footie check for rugby.)\n\nSooo they played another sport, why am I so upset? \nBecause I called, hours before. I called to check on what I wanted. During that conversation when I asked if there'd be sound so I could hear the match they instead could have told me.. \"By the way, we'll have two back to back games of some other sport playing at the same time on the 6 other screens pumping through the speakers but since we're a soccer pub we always keep soccer on one screen. So sure.\" \nYes, as I was asking if I should go somewhere else someone actually said \"Since we're a soccer pub we always keep soccer on one screen.\" They actually had it on two screens a different game on each screen and one of them was the channel I wanted, but the match before was in stoppage, so no pre-match not that it mattered by this point. For future reference turning the sound all the way up on 1 tv, when you have surround sound speakers broadcasting a different channel does not count as having sound for a match.\n\nI did get to see my match, but I could have done the exact same thing 2 blocks from my apartment- bar, flat screen, beer, no sound- instead of going out to Mad Dog. I hate wasting my time and effort. And in the end I feel like I was lied to for extra business- and they don't need it. What's one less actual pub/football patron, when you have 40 sports bar customers? \n\n\nSome consolations of the night were: The Irish bartender seemed just as disappointing in not being able to give me the sound for my footie as I was in not having it. Two other supporters showed up and our enthusiasm for our match actually was briefly louder than the other 30+ people in the bar, twice. We won.", "author": "Brandy B."}

I've worked in the service industry and get it. But the fact of the matter is you are still open and serving people so you ultimately do your job.\n\n So after some debate as to if my roommate and I were going to split a 22 oz seasonal beer (which turned out to be priced at $22!  We decided it was not worth it to spend $1 per oz) I ordered the house red and my roommate got a beer.  This bar is cash only so we were pulling cash out of our pockets to make sure we had the right amount. Yes we were drunk and maybe a little sloppy, but certainly not doing anything rude and  we were working it out amongst ourselves. We put our money together on the bar and we were going to collect the money and hand it to the bartender in an appropriate way but instead she grabbed the money from the pile  and said sarcastically bitchy \"thanks for handing it to me so nicely\". My roommate said he gave a $3 tip which I have no reason to doubt- but while I was still at the bar preparing to go back to my table the bartender shouts \"thanks for the tip guys\"  I calmly apologized and said that I thought we had left $3 and she said there was no tip.  I left another $2.  But really?  Shouting that out?  I would never not leave a tip but her YELLING at us certainly made me not want to leave one.  \n\nThe house wine was UNDRINKABLE- I mean it had clearly gone bad and was disgusting.  It was sour and vinegary tasting (believe me I'm no wine snob either) I would have said something but I didn't want the bartender to bitch at me again.  So thank you Mad Dog in the Fog for serving me tons of attitude and a disgusting glass of wine.  You probably got a $5 tip out of it.  \n\nThere isn't anything that makes this place better than the tons of other bars in the neighborhood, so I doubt I'll be coming in again.", "author": "Amy G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-16", "description": "Before dinner and going out, we hit this pub for a few beers and to watch the Warriors game.  High ceilings and lots of open space, makes this a great bar for people who don't want the person next to them, breathing in their drink.  Boddington's, Blue Moon, Stella. . . the usual suspects.  The pool tables are well-kept and dartboards hang around in the corners.  Damn those Warriors play well at home!", "author": "E L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-03-18", "description": "Good selection of beers, cheaper pints than elsewhere, but no food. I was really craving some hot-wings when I went here last, but alas, there were none to be found. However, they did let us bring in some pizza from mythic across the street. Two thumbs up for being that laid back! Watch some soccer here, enjoy a good beer, play some pool, but its probably not the place for you if you want to dance/get smashed/hook up/eat.", "author": "Micah R."}

They have the sunday ticket so you can watch any game you want.  It is never to busy, like it's sisterbar the Kezar.  Great selection of beer, but no alchol which is a bummer cuz something bout football and bloody's on sunday makes so much sense.  Oh yeah and if you get bored they have cork dart boards for freee of charge which is always a bonus, and on thursday they do a quiz night.", "author": "brian m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-01-15", "description": "Ok I should give it three stars. The beer selection should be better, the interior needs work and the vibe isn't always there. But when my life went (and still somewhat is) this bar allowed me to return to lower haight and somewhat took me under my wing. I've made some new friends and when i am lonely I can read my book and nurse my beer and know i can be ok for a little while. That is precious in what can be a very impersonal city like san francisco.", "author": "Cassandra T."}

Still, as far as good ol' fashioned bars go, this is just fine, no complaints really, but I prefer the Hemlock or the Page!!", "author": "Steve l."}

I couldnt finish my beer and couldnt finish my game....if i had walked into that initially i would have given this a 1 star review....so i comprimised, 3 stars.", "author": "Brad O."}

Friendly, laid back, incredibly helpful with everything from beers to restaurants in the area. Even let me recharge my phone behind the bar while I enjoyed a perfectly poured pint of Guinness (or 6).

I guess I wandered in there, and I know I went to about 10 other bars that night, and to be honest this was the one that stood out the most. The bartender was the kind of an asshole who blasted The Beatles all night long, and I loved every second of it.  Loved the guy and had an all around great experience.", "author": "Shawna E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-03-07", "description": "I was there today to watch some Champs League matches namely the Arsenal-PSV match and I had a great time despite the unfavorable result in the match. I had to buy $10 worth of 'tickets' in order to come in and watch the games, but the tickets can be used to eat, drink and be merry. I would have spent $10 easy anyway, I was planning to stay late and watch the taped delay Real-Bayern match on ESPN Classic so I knew I was in for a few pints as well as some food. I was surprised that the menu was so limited but the beer selection was excellent. Plenty to choose from and they had my favorite, Anchor Steam. After two of those and about halftime, I ordered the Greedy Bastard which was two pieces of bacon, two sausages, tomato, two pieces of toast, baked beans and two eggs. It was rocking and all that was left was the fat off of the bacon. I was in town visiting, from L.A., but I had lived in the city some time ago in the same neighborhood as Mad Dog, and decided that it was prolly the best place to watch these matches (other than my hotel room, but it would be boring to watch it alone). It does look different than the last time I came in here, almost ten years ago, but it was still a good experience and I was surrounded by a bunch of people who cared about the game which is more than I could say for any old sports bar, AND I was able to watch two matches at once. It was awesome and I'm glad I took the time to come back.", "author": "Mauro T."}
