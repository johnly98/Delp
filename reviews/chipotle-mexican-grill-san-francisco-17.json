I still remember when it opened up and it was in excellent condition. I was really surprised to come back and see the current state. There was trash on the floor and on the tables that wasn't removed even after 20 minutes. Someone wiped down one table top and then disappeared. The furniture looks stained and is torn with stuffing even coming out of some of the chairs. \n\nI ordered a bowl and quite a bit of the rice was stale/hard.

I'm fairly confident that on the weekends they serve whatever ingredients are left from the week - everything is cold and stale. Workers are clueless and they seem to be hiring new people constantly, seems they cannot keep staff, so again they are clueless. Tiny portions, like ridiculously tiny. Around 50% of the time they are out of something with no explanation - taco shells, guacamole, chicken, etc.  Dirty floors and dirty counters.

In the end, you are at the mercy of the server for how much you get.  Luckily they have all be trained to give you nothing.

In addition, I think Chipotle's salad option provides a pretty healthy carb-free choice, and I have been trying to have one meal a day that does not contain carbs.  \n\nA month or so ago, I decided to order a salad online from Chipotle for pickup -- ordering food ahead for pick-up and bypassing long lines is my favorite. I usually use the App \"OrderAhead\" to do that (LOVE) or Yelp's App (sometimes).  Since Chipotle is not offered on any Apps so far as I can tell, I ordered direct from the restaurant's website.  Seems simple enough.  Note that you have to order far in advance of the time you actually want to pick up your meal on Chipotle's website (and lunch is particularly busy, so order early).  At 3:00 p.m., I ordered a chicken salad with hot salsa, light black beans, cheese, no dressing, and guacamole on the side for pick-up at 5:20 p.m.\n\nWhen I arrived at Chipotle at 5:25 p.m. (that's later than the time I scheduled for pick-up, by the way), I walked to the front to pick-up the order.  No one was in the pick-up window (there's a separate window to pick up online orders actually) and it took me a long time to be acknowledged by the cashier. This less-than-friendly young lady actually carded me for the salad, much to my surprise.  Does Chipotle get a lot of salad thieves?  Do I look the type that would steal a salad?  Am I on bath salts?  I was visibly irritated but I showed my ID and she went to retrieve the salad, which hadn't even been made yet.  The fact that it wasn't ready at the promised time really frosted my cupcakes -- it defeats the whole purpose of ordering online.  Don't offer such an option if you can't get it together to have the order ready by the time promised.  If I wanted to wait in line, I would not order online (that rhymed).\n\nThe cashier asked a young gentleman on the food line to make my order, which did not go well.  He accidentally put the guacamole on top of the salad instead of on-the-side, and when he realized he made a mistake, he took a plastic cup and proceeded to scoop the guacamole off of the top.  Oh, the horror.  First, you do not want guacamole on the top of the salad if you are watching your calorie intake.  Chipotle puts WAY too much and even though guacamole is good for you, it is still loaded with fattening, albeit delicious, calories.  Second, it was sort of gross to watch him scoop the guacamole with a plastic cup.  It seemed less than sanitary.  I think he should have simply made a new salad.  Given that he seemed a little green, and perhaps felt pressured during the dinner rush, I decided not to complain, although maybe I should have in retrospect.  After that incident, I simply decided I would not be back.  \n\nAnd I wasn't.  Until this past Friday night, however, when I had just finished a long workout around 9:30 p.m. and was so hungry I could have eaten my own hand.  I didn't want to get anything too unhealthy, so I decided to get take-out from Chipotle against my better judgment.  The fact is, it's one of the only options in the area that late at night (which seems ridiculous by the way -- the area is loaded with hungry tourists and even hungrier young professionals, such as myself).  I waited patiently in a short line behind two tourists who had apparently never been to a Chipotle before -- they didn't \"understand\" what a salad was.  They were nice enough, but it took an inordinate amount of time for them to order two salads -- it's a salad choice guys, not a marriage proposal.  Finally I ordered a chicken salad, but was then informed that Chipotle had \"run out\" of guacamole.  ... ... ... How is that even possible!? It's like McDonald's running out of chicken mcnuggets -- it's simply not possible.  You can't run out of the one thing Chipotle manages to do correctly pretty consistently.  If I had known that walking in, I probably would have left.  The nice cashier assisting me asked if I wanted an extra serving of one of the other ingredients to make up for the missing guacamole, so I requested extra cheese, because duh, but I think I was charged for it.    \n\nUgh.  \n\nIn the future, if you have a Mexican food jones, I would take a little bit of extra time to walk across Market to Tropisueno (you can Order Ahead on the App and bypass the long lines) or even Unos Dos Tacos.  This Chipotle is not the best.  \n\nYou can't run out of guacamole when you serve (even quasi-) Mexican food.  It's just wrong.", "author": "Sunny S."}

So you can watch people while you wolf down a 2 pound burrito, or they can watch you with hungry  eyes as they pass by. \n\nI go for the Fajita Barbacoa burrito. Instead of beans, grilled onions and bell peppers. This time they made a mistake and threw on black beans, and to make up for it, they added extra Barbacoa meat, to the point that they couldn't roll it into a burrito. It was a huge lump in my stomach after I downed that juicy mountain of Chipotle fixins covered-not-rolled by a tortilla. \n\nGood thing for you ladies wearing your 5 inch fashion pumps and sneaking a burrito, the wait line has a leather S curve seating, so you can sit and rest those barking dogs while waiting to order your main meat! (Or Sofritos, aka tofu). Just sit down ladylike because the seats are a little low, and if you were wearing a tube dress with those fashion pumps, it may become beaver season. BTW, why are you in a Chipotle if you are in high heels and a tube dress anyway? Saving money in case nobody buys you a drink at Ruby Skye? \n\nWhy is Chipotle called Chipotle if they have no Chipotle sauce? \n\nOn the positive side, they have probably single handedly taught gringos how not to pronounce it Chip-o-dole.

My veggie bowl was all salsa - definitely under their correct standard portion size of rice, beans, fajitas, and guacamole. Other than that, the food itself was fine. Taste was consistent with the other Chipotles. Service was nothing of note. Would likely not be back if I didn't work nearby, and options weren't limited in this neighborhood.\n\nEdit: I've really come to hate this location. It's 9:15, and they have the bathroom area blocked off with a very wet floor and a sign indicating the area is being cleaned. I worked at Chipotle way back in the day, and we NEVER cleaned the floors for the night while a customer was still in the store, let alone 45 minutes before closing. I was forced to eat my meal with unwashed hands coming off of work. Terrible. Chips not made well. And as skimpy as ever.\n\nEdit 2: this place just gets worse! Last time at 7:30 pm they had the entire upstairs closed, meaning 80% of their seating and the restrooms off-limits (I got yelled at for trying to go upstairs to ask the gentleman cleaning to toss me some Chipotle Tabasco). People were sitting down to eat on the furniture that forms the line! These bathroom closures happen way too often at this location. Unacceptable, and disgusting! I also got really skimped on with beans (was given about 1/2 scoop - shocker, as this is the cheap 'filler' ingredient) and was almost shorted for the guacamole (the guy again attempted to give me 1/2 scoop) when I finally had to put my foot down. No way in HECK am I going to be charged $2 for 2 ounces of guacamole.

Every time I eat here my burrito is a disaster, and this time I was somehow charged extra when I asked the person assembling my burrito to be a little more generous with rice and beans. I was under the impression that they didn't charge for that. It's a veggie burrito...it's basically just rice and beans, I feel like it's fair for me to ask for more than a half scoop. Then plop goes the sour cream, all on one half of the burrito, \"um...could I get more sour cream on the other side?\" Plop goes a second scoop, in the same place. Now I have a lake of sour cream all on one end, a moat of Guac on the other, no man's land of nothing but rice in the middle. \n\nHappens almost every time at this particular location. \n\nGetting charged extra for an accidentally open-faced burrito with completely partitioned ingredients on a regular basis is going to make me avoid going to this location.", "author": "Colin M."}

They skimped on the rice, but I think they were trying to conserve a little until they got their next batch. After I paid for my burrito, the cashier pulled out a bag and was going to bag my burrito but then got asked a question. He just put down my burrito and the bag and stood there. Couldn't he have just put the burrito into the bag with the same motion? He just stood there for a good 45 seconds just talking, I guess he couldn't multi-task.\n\nWhen I sat down and ate my burrito, it was just full of disappointment. Everything was bland and didn't taste as fresh as other locations. I'll probably still come back in the future since its open till 10 pm and is perfect for those late work nights.

So I galavant upstairs after I order my burrito, giddy like I have just seen the first snowfall of autumn. I rush to claim my throne on which I am about to devour this succulent steak (did I tell you how succulent their steak was?!). Low and behold, I ordered chicken by accident. It was aight.

That's hardly the biggest issue though.  The combination of grilles frying huge amounts of meat and exhaust hoods bellowing n extremely close proximity to the order line, at least a dozen customers and order takers yelling at each other to complete orders, cooks yelling at each other to communicate, and stores with zero sound-absorbing finishes makes it almost impossible for the order takers to hear what the customers are ordering.  I literally had to repeat what kind of rice I wanted THREE times, and the last time I had to scream at the top of my lungs to be heard!! Not 15 seconds later I had to be asked TWICE what kind of meat I wanted, and again I'm yelling at the top of my lungs just to get lunch.  Not my idea of a relaxing break from work, which lunch should be.  \n\nThe acoustical issues are not limited to the serving/ordering area.  Because the store is constructed of hard wood, glass, and stainless steel, with literally no sound absorbing materials, the dining areas are also extremely noisy during lunch hour, which is hardly conducive to conversation.

When I do write a review, it's because the restaurant has either spectacularly impressed me, or they have failed in some manner, which I feel needs to be addressed.  This is the latter kind of review.\nNormally, this Chipotle location is my go-to spot for lunch on Sundays, because there's not a lot of stuff within walking distance of my office that is open on Sundays.  Normally, their service is adequate, and the food is, quite frankly, above average most of the time.  If this review were about any of my other visits, It would be a three-star, bordering on four-star, review.  But it isn't.  This is about my visit today.\nI'm unsure what was going on today.  I ordered the same thing that I order every Sunday, because I know this locations strengths: A steak bowl with white rice, black beans, mild and corn salsas, sour cream, and cheese.  To start, they were out of white rice.  Not a big problem, as they had some on the way, and my wait time for the white rice was less than a minute.  However, the prep kitchen should have had it out there for the folks working the line.  The young lady working that part of the line was extremely sweet and apologetic, so kudos to her.  The young gent working the next part of the line was less so, unfortunately.  I'd go so far as to say he was put out when I didn't want to substitute their brown rice for white, even though I offered to step back so that they could help other guests while I waited on the rice.  Once the rice was in my bowl, he seemed even further put out that I wanted corn AND mild salsa.  This young man has helped me on numerous occasions before, and it has never been a problem before.  To end my visit, the same gent left my bowl in a position that was not readily accessible to either the cashier or myself.  Yes, I suppose the cashier could have moved a foot to the right to slide my bowl over to me.  Just like I could have reached all the way back into their prep area to grab my bowl (which I ended up doing, despite needing a cane to walk, and pretty much stand).\nThe food, was pretty good though.", "author": "Jerod K."}

(and I mean Steve Ells not Steve Jobs just to avoid any confusion here)..you had such a great idea: Mexican food in a Natural, all organic, fast, convenient, clean and friendly environment...wait..scrap that last part out. \n\nI just had my Chi PUCK Le experience which I can tell you as nothing organic about.\n\nLet me start off that the food itself isn't bad at all- Not saying you are getting straight up holy shit good freaking amazing Mexican Food, but it ain't that bad either. Given the fact that we are talking about a Chain I actually applaud Steve for doing such a great job in terms of food quality. (YES, I applaud him...go to Jack in the Box and you will understand why..)\nAnyway, My problem is with level of customer service which is quite honestly just one big joke. I caught myself really thinking \" where is that freaking hidden camera that will come out and tell me I am on national television doing a story on people's behavior during bad Customer Service\"- up until now that camera never showed. Instead I find myself in line with about 100 other people that are all there for than Mexican fix. The counter s pretty big and believe it or not, they actually have quite a few employees working behind it. Looks like a fast, effective way..stress on \"LOOKS LIKE\". I am amazed that no matter the number of employees, the line of customers seems to go soooo slow. Anyway, when you finally reach the counter you are faced with hurdle number 1: SHOUT your order to the lady or gentleman on the other side of the glass- Yes, SHOUT because the acoustics in this place are horrible- Great design that was probably done by a deaf architect...im just saying....\n-' One vegetarian Burito please\"\n- \"One burrito?\"\n-\"Yes, ONE VEGETARIAN Burito Please...\"\n- \"Would you like chicken or beef?\"\n- \"Hmmm..it is Vegetarian...\"\n- \"Oh OK, so One vegetarian Burito?\"\n- \"YES please...\"\n- \"Would you like veggies?\n- \"Hmm..YES, again it is a vegetarian Burito..right?\"\n- \"Black or Pinto beans?\"\n- \"Whats in the beans?\"\n- \"The Pinto beans have bacon in it\"\n- \"Oh then Ill have the black beans\"\n- \"so the pinto beans?\"\n- \" Uh no..the black beans please\"\n- \"what else?\"\n- \"well...all the veggies I would assume?\"\n- would you like chips? \n- \"no thank you\"\n- \"Chips and soda? \"\n-\" uh...no thank you..no chips and no soda\"\n\nOkay I admit, I do know why it takes forever to get through that line because apparantly the employees there seem to be unable to take your order the first time around and repeat every question at least once, but more likely twice! \n\nSo 10 minutes later I got my Burito wrapped up in front of me and I get to the paying part- This particular lady yells really hard my order\" ONE VEGETARIAN BURITOOOOO YAY! Anything ELSE? \" \" mm...no.....thank you\"\n\n\"WELL THAT WILL BE $8.57- I hand over my creditcard..and she then yells \" out of VISAAAAAA\"....okay slow down miss...I know it is a visa card and there is no need to scream that all the freaking place...I just lost my hearing..and quite honestly you just scare me a bit....\n\"THANK YOU and have a WONDERFUL DAY!!! YAAAAAY!\"\n\"hmm...yeah..thanks..i guess...\"\n\nso there I am: 15 minutes later- 8 bucks lighter and in need of some hearing aid- but hey I have my Vegggie Burito, with all the veggies and no meat !\n\nChipotle: It would be great if you could train your employees at this current location a bit better and do something about that acoustic problem you have in there...if you dont know what I mean, then go in around 1 and try to place an order and try to keep your hearing when paying for your order..and no ear muffs are not allowed during this process.\n\nI will be going to the other location on Market street from now on, it is worth the 10 minute walk and I would recommend you do the same.", "author": "Achraf S."}

This location needs to do something about the noise level and inability to communicate with the servers.  \n\nThey are fast - very good when the line is a mile long.  But it also means (combined with the noise) that they can't handle a request out of the ordinary.  A few too many times I've bitten into my burrito only to have all the juice from the beans spill out onto my shirt or dress. Not great when you have 6 hours left on the clock.  So I ask them to drain the beans.  If they hear me, I'm good to go.  If they don't, it totally screws up their process because the next guy is waiting for my meat order and I can't get out fast enough that I don't want meat because  I'm going back and forth over the glass trying to tell them to drain the beans.  Now all hell is breaking loose because meat guy is just trying to do his job by spooning steak onto my vegetarian burrito.  Not sure how to solve this problem but I'm guessing I'm not the only one with some variation of this issue.", "author": "Deborah G."}

I'm just not okay with the people who work here. Don't get me wrong, they're very friendly and smiling all the time, but you end up having to repeat your order like ten times before they get it right. Additionally, if I'm going to pay 8 bucks for a burrito, it best have a lot of chicken in it. This chipotle seems to skimp on the meat, which bothers me, for the most part I just want the protein and that's what I'm paying for. They also don't have the tofu filling which  some other branches have started to offer. Try not to go here during peak lunch hours, the line goes out the door. Overall, I prefer the other branch on Market, but this one is convenient if you work around Kearny.", "author": "Neha H."}

Usually I can overlook the lackluster service because of the awesome food! Things have definitely gone downhill since my last review. Apparently I'm not the only one that thinks that the meat portions are skimpy because the three people in front of me all asked for a little more meat. The response they got was two more cubes/pieces of meat and a snarky \"any more meat and you'll get charged for double meats.\" Okay, I get it, you have portions... but when I checkout and see that the ENTIRE upstairs is closed (including the bathroom) to customers, I've had it. Sure, I get it if you want to clean up there 10-15 minutes before close... but this was AN HOUR AND A HALF before your closing time. At one point I counted TEN customers standing or sitting on the weird S-shaped bench because there was not enough seating. If you don't care if I have a place to sit and eat the food I paid for, I don't need to be back. Goodbye Chipotle Tuesdays.", "author": "Kristina B."}

I was their loyal customer before Gordo's came in but I digress....\n\nThis is the second Chipotle I've ever been to in SF (first one was on O'Farrell) and I have to admit.. I was pretty disappointed :(\n\nThe line was crazy, but that's no biggie.  Luckily for me, I ordered online so I just walked up to the counter and asked for my order.  I was actually early but despite that, the server hurriedly apologized and rushed to make my order.  That definitely put a smile on my face :D  Since I've been to Chipotle before, I figured that the burritos would be nice and hot, even if I waited a 5 or 6 minutes to eat them (I kept them in the bag, and I had to wait since I was going to meet up my girlfriend two blocks away).\n\nWhen we unwrapped our burritos.. the first thing we noticed was the absence of warmth.  The burritos did not feel like they were just made.  The next thing we noticed was how strangely the burritos were wrapped.  They weren't covered all the way.  About 1/5 of the burritos were exposed, but they were kept in the bag so we thought nothing of it.  Then we bit into the burritos and confirmed that the burritos were indeed, pretty cold.  They tasted like the burritos had been left out on a table overnight.  This was REALLY weird, because I literally picked them up less than 10 minutes ago, when they were supposed to be warm.  Even at Berkeley, if I bought a burrito at Chipotle and walked the 5 or 6 blocks home in a cold evening, the burriots would still be warm/ hot-ish by the time I ate.  This was really crazy.\n\nI don't know how this could happen, especially when the burritos were made right when I arrived, with extremely prompt service.  It pains me to give this Chipotle a 2 star.  The lack of warmth in the burritos made it hard to eat, and even though everything was in the burrito correctly, I have to dock two stars for this not-so-enjoyable meal.  The third star docked was because of the sloppy wrapping, but I definitely recommend this Chipotle for their prompt online pickup service if anything!", "author": "Filmer Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-02-26", "description": "Gringo Burritos\n\nI don't know how they can call this a \"Mexican\" grill; I saw not a single soul who could even mistakenly be identified as Mexican. But my own biases aside (that only Mexicans can make good Mexican food, and only Italians know how to cook pasta, or that a Chinese restaurant can't possibly be any good if there's no Chinese customer in sight), I ordered four (4) burritos.  Much to my regret, I had to toss two (2). The steak burrito I ordered was absolutely full of gristle. After four attempts to chew the morsels of meat, I spit out the fourth one and tossed the entire $10 concoction in the compost bin. The carnitas were tasty to me, but not to my ten-year old, who didn't appreciate the preponderance of black pepper. The best one was definitely the chicken. I should be used to the lack of refried beans, after trying to order gringo burritos at Whole Foods, but I was tricked by the mention of \"Mexican\" in the eatery's name. I soldiered on but had to ask twice for them to add more cheese -- slender shreds, scarcely visible, and as it turns out, entirely indeterminable. When my daughter and I arrived, there were no other customers, but it was still hard to hear the counter-persons. When I realized that the cheese would be imperceptible, I asked for guacamole to be added, to add flavor and reduce dryness. I evidently mis-heard because I thought they told me there would be a $1 charge per burrito, but it was $2/burrito, thereby making these burritos the MOST EXPENSIVE burritos I have ever had (and I've had Whole Foods', thank you very much). $10/burrito would have been fine if I'd been able to taste the cheese, or if there were more than a teensy dollop of guacamole, or if (as in the case of my steak burrito last night), there had been edible meat instead of gristle, but I was left feeling robbed. After spending over $40 for 4 burritos, I should at least be able to eat them.  Part of that cost is my fault -- I could have abstained from guacamole or ordered kids' burritos for the kids, but the beans were too dry, the cheese was imperceptible, and the steak was gristle. So I felt ripped-off. (As I said, I couldn't hear the servers, but they seemed friendly and couteous. Even my 10-year old said the cashier was \"sweet\"). \n\nI do have to say that the rice, from which I usually abstain, was the best part of the burrito. It's lime-cilantro flavored and comes in brown or white. This was my first time at any of the teeming Chipotles, and it will probably be my last. But if ever this bad memory fades and I find myself in another Chipotle, I'd order what my 3-year old calls \"Chicken Rice\"-- a bowl of rice with grilled chicken.

I mean I go there because Chipotle is the only place within walking that is always consistent in terms of food quality. The place is also very new and pretty fast. I gotta give it to this spot the  people there are pretty quick. I do wish however that when you order a steak burrito that you get more than a tiny spoon full and that guacamole costs and extra 2.50 for a teaspoon amount.  I know the economy is rough but come on that has to cost almost nothing. The only other reason I do not give this place a four out of five is because the place could be kept a little cleaner in terms of when you walk in the line layout is this wavy or almost confusing guiding path to the counter. I would rather have tables there because sitting in the window to eat your meal is a little strange when people walking by are easily five feet higher than you and just stare at you. Its kind of funny to shoot a face back at them but for the most part just wish we the consumer was positioned to not be stared at. All in all the place is good.
