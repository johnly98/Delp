(C'MON, pizzahacker! I bought premium toppings. You can afford to put a few logs in the fire.)\n\nSo anyway, I stop in and was really just glad to see this coffee shop open at 6:30pm on a Sunday and holiday weekend. I'd been leaning towards a chai but for some reason I blurted out, 'Mexican Hot Chocolate', when the barista asked what I'd like. I did kind of want it and the idea of a spicy dessert-y beverage sounded nice but I had a smidge of FOMO about not getting the chai... then someone pointed out the $5 credit card minimum so I ended up ordering the chai, too, for the my walking mate. \n\nIt wasn't busy at all so they had just one person taking orders, making them, and ringing up. The general vibe is a little low budget and the baked treats on the counter were pretty stale (I got an overly hard dream bar). \n\nI was excited just to have two hot beverages in my hands to warm up a bit on the way back to my vehicle but bummed that my Mexican hot chocolate was really just a regular old hot chocolate. No spice, nothing stand-out, not everything I was hoping for but hey, it kept me warm for the time being and that was the main goal all along.", "author": "Candice G."}

I get an egg and cheese there pretty regularly and if God made bagel sandwiches, I'm pretty sure this is what they'd taste like. Soft, yet firm. A hint of salt, just the right meltiness of cheese. Wow, I want a bagel sandwich right now. (Beware, though, that they will run out of bagels by midday - particularly on weekends- so don't wait too long.)\n\n2. My soy latte is always smooth and a pleasure to drink.\n\n3. The bananas are perfect. Does it make sense to compliment a cafe on their fruit selection? It's weird. I've never seen such consistently perfect banana offerings. Every time I go in, the bananas are perfectly ripe and yellow and pretty and big (there's a joke in there somewhere which I refuse to make).\n\n4. Staff is always friendly and majority vaguely European. Sometimes they play the Amelie soundtrack and I feel all french to be in there.\n\nMinor things to note:\n1. They often keep the door open, even if it's cold. If you're sensitive to temperature and plan to work there, you might want to bring a coat.\n\n2. The splenda is hidden in a cup at the counter. They'll give it to you if you ask for it.

One star off because they frequently leave the doors propped open, likely to facilitate the open, neighborhood feel.

If I lived in San Francisco I would be here most mornings. We both had the breakfast panini and were satisfied until our midmorning snack at the Japanese Tea Garden. Since neither of us are big on coffee and it is a cafe, I cannot offer up the coveted 5th star. I defer to the coffee experts... However! If you want a quick, cheap, and delicious meal I do recommend them quite highly!", "author": "Ian J."}

The two best things about this place is the coffee (which is grrreat) and the staff are so friendly and accommodating. I mostly go for the coffee but once in a while I order a breakfast bagel or bfast panini. All the food, including the desserts are fantastic. I highly recommend this place.", "author": "Lin N."}

Their coffee and chai, my regular drinks, are mediocre at best, but I'm willing to deal with that for the convenience.  My biggest pet peeve is that they are constantly out of stuff.  Today I went at noon for a couple bagel sandwiches for me and my co-workers.  They were out of bagels.  Granted there may have been a breakfast rush, but their yummy bagel sandwiches take up about half of their menu, and are perfect for lunch.  If it had been 5 p.m., I would have understood-well, maybe.  We live in SF, not the boonies...if you're out of something, go get it, rather than risk turning off your customers.", "author": "Yogini R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-09-04", "description": "Cafe Seventy8 has totally yummy vegan cookies and vegan \"egg salad\" sandwiches.  They've got a wonderful neighborhood feeling, the kind of place where neighbors come in with their dogs and chat about what's happening with the Tiffany Street \"traffic calming\" or Friends of the Urban Forest sidewalk planting or the St. Luke's hospital renovations.  Cafe Seventy8 even provides space (after hours) for the Neighborhood Watch meetings, which is very cool.  The folks behind the counter are friendly and helpful, and the ambiance is great for grabbing a quick bite or staying for awhile with a good book or newspaper, or doing some work on your laptop.", "author": "Rachel D."}

It truly is all that and more.  Highly recommend!\n\n\nUPDATE\n\nA couple of suggestions:\n\n1) It would be nice if you had a non-dairy creamer like soy, rice, or almond milk.\n\n2) Please provide unrefined sugar also.  It is not the C&H type brown sugar that is currently provided, it is unprocessed sugar that just happens to be brownish in color.\n\nVisit Four Barrel on Valencia for an example.", "author": "Customer X."}

Not pretentious, not grungy, but a nice little spot in the middle I call comfortable. They have good coffee and good snacks, and a very relaxed clientele. \n\nI went in this morning as I often do on Saturdays, but having stumbled out of the house with only a $5 was $0.25 short for the order I wanted to place. No problem, they were happy to overlook that quarter. Next time, will certainly make up for it with a nicer-than-usual tip. \n\nAll in all, fantastic neighborhood coffee joint.", "author": "i p."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-06-01", "description": "One of my very favorite coffee shops of all time! Regulars here range in age from in-utero to over 80-yrs-old, and everyone is welcome. I routinely hear three or more languages while I'm there in the morning. Annette subscribes to the Economist and the New York Times as well as the Chronicle, so there's always something fun to read. The food is terrific, the coffee is yummy, and the rotating art installations give you a good place to rest your eyes. Dogs are invited in to visit, too--there's a jar of free dog biscuits, and usually someone willing to toss one in the air for your pooch to catch. Have I mentioned that I love it? LOVE IT.", "author": "Rose W."}

The new owners changd the name. This used to be Muddy Waters (or Muddy's to locals). Muddy's is a chain with cafes at 24th and Valencia, Church St., 16th and Valencia, and I think another spot. Cafe 78 is a little bit more chic (?) than Muddy's. Muddy's was a little more on the down-low and had the basics (bagels, pastries, juice, soda, and of course, coffee).  Cafe 78 has paninis (sp?), salads, desserts, pastries, juice, yogurt parfaits, etc. I haven't been to Cafe 78 for a while to study, except just recently, only because I'm done taking all the heavy-loaded classes for pre-nursing. Otherwise, my a$$ would be parked at Cafe 78 almost 7 days a week after work and on weekends studying. That might change next semester though, so I just might be a semi-permanent fixture at Cafe 78 as I was when it used to be Muddy's. \n\nI recently ran into my co-worker over the past weekend in here and he was shocked to find me studying there =). I told him once, after the new owners took over, that this cafe has become a little too chi-chi for me =D. I might have to hang-out more at this cafe again to rethink that. I like that they've added more food selections besides the usual bagels and pastries and they've added tables outside, so people inside studying/on their lap tops have somewhere to sit. \n\nGive me one more week and I just might add another star or two. Sorry, I'm local and I'm not really to happy about  the many changes the Mission/Bernal Heights has gone through.", "author": "Neni E."}

I'm conflicted about yelping great things about them because I always want there to be room at a table for me!  The service is great, the coffee excellent, and I love their free wifi and friendly, neighborhood ice-cream social atmosphere.  I knew the previous owner and he was wonderful I was worried how it would change under new ownership... but these gals are fun and savvy and the place is even better than ever.  OH! and I love their salads... I know how special can a salad be, but really, these gals know how to make a very tasty salad.  I spend half my time down on the Peninsula now but I still make the drive all the way up to the City because I love their coffee and atmosphere.  SMOOCH!", "author": "Callista S."}
