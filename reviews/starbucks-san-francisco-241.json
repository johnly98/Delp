{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-04-05", "description": "I had the pleasure of visiting the first Starbucks cafe to open in San Francisco (1992). By East Coast standards, that may not be impressive but in California that probably gets you a historic permit of sorts. The building itself is actually old, dating back to 1899 if i'm not mistaken.  \n\nI encountered this location as I passed by on the north side of Union street, first thinking I had spotted a dimly lit and quaint restaurant. Out front there's a row of trees, their leaves partially obscuring, to charming effect, the monolithic Starbucks Coffee lettering on the upper ledge of the front interior.\n\nThe entrance felt profound, an open space with beautifully worn wooden tiles leading to the counter. You can't help but look up at the vintage features of the ceiling--opaque lights hanging from an ornate ceiling base and grayish-blue square ceiling tiles with a silky matte finish. Leather seats can be found in the front, with a view of bustling Union street, and in the back, with quick access to restrooms.\n\nOn the left side of the space, there's a long communal wooden table with seating for up to twelve, just one short of a miracle. Inspired souls work quietly on their school work and resumes, and presumably some are writing their Yelp reviews. The table faces a ribbed textured royal blue wall framed by dark brown wooden panels. \n\nOverall, an amazing experience. You know, the iced coffee with Hazelnut favoring wasn't too bad either.", "author": "Behnam S."}

My favorite drink is a hot caramel macchiato super delicious! I really do love Starbucks although I was very disappointed because their employee Scarlet is very rude and so the last time I went I was ordering my caramel macchiato like always and as Scarlet was making my coffee she had bumped my cup and knocked a large amount of my drink out of the cup almost all of the expresso that she had just put in. The outside of my cup was stained Brown with expresso. I got a ways down the street I took a sip I realized my coffee  did not taste like it had any espresso in it. it tasted just like caramel and milk which it pretty much was at that point. I would have gone back but I was on my break and I had to go. Needless to say I was very disappointed with Scarlett's customer service she has shown poor customer service in the past this although this time I was also disappointed with my drink that she made. I still love Starbucks and I still will continue to go there every day. Although I'm hoping for better customer service next time and to have my drink make the proper way.", "author": "Emily K."}

Not that they care...\n\n- Don't ask for your free Iced tea, iced coffee, or hot brewed coffee as a refill on your purchased drink if you stay in the store - they simply refuse to honor Starbucks refill policy, which is \"free refills to Starbucks Rewards members - regardless of original beverage purchased - if you stay in the store - and pay with your registered card\". Further more, they refuse to read it off their own website if offered!\n\n- One of the restrooms is closed as \"non-working, to be fixed real soon\", not sure if that note is a permanent fixture or what, since it's been there three weeks ago as well as today. Another restroom doesn't have any toilet paper in it, nor paper towels, and they didn't bother to stock it up in about an hour and a half that I've been there on Saturday afternoon.\n\n- People are smoking in front of this location constantly and there's no escape: they stand around the corner and  just by the doors, blowing the smoke in and around. They leave burning cigarette butts on top of mail distribution box while running in, throw used butts on the ground when they are done smoking, etc. Theres is no not-smoking sign displayed on the door that I could see and point it out.

I was really bummed when I heard about that because I realized that they (Starbuck's) used to do that in other suburban communities as well year's ago.  \r\n\r\nBut the joke came to be on them in the end because there is now a local french boulangerie chain who subsequently bought the lease and opened up their local shop 2 weeks later.  This will now be their 5th location in the city...\r\n\r\nCan't put a finger on the sun...and I feel better about the world and smile to myself everytime I stroll by...", "author": "Yelper A."}

Yes, it's a nice vaulted ceiling, but it shouldn't have cobwebs!!!  What if a spider falls in my drink?  Gross!
