With my most recent visit, I ordered the Salmon Rotolone Tartine and my friend ordered the Spicy Pop Pulled Pork Scramble so I got to try some of that as well. The scramble was heavier than the tartine which gave more of a lighter, fresh taste to brunch. Honestly all of their dishes come with crunchy potatoes. All the dishes I've tried so far are delicious. Will probably become a regular here! \n\n\nAs always in the City, street parking is limited and I didn't see a parking structure nearby but can't confirm because I mostly walk and do ride-share when I'm in SF.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

I was greeted as soon as I walked in and there were a few open tables so I was immediately seated. They also have bar and outdoor seating available. \n\nI was in the mood for something sweet so I ordered the lemon souffle pancakes and the fresh squeezed orange juice. They serve breakfast items all day but after 11 am they start serving salads, burgers and sandwiches too. \n\nThe orange juice came first which was sweeter than I was expecting it to be. It tasted as if sugar was added but otherwise it seemed fresh. I would have preferred it to be colder too.\n\nThe lemon souffle pancakes came out hot and smelled amazing but they tasted okay. The lemon flavoring was evident with certain bites but it did not taste as if it was blended in well. The pancakes were a little more browner than golden and also carried somewhat of a brunt griddle flavoring. The pancakes also came with a side of strawberries, blueberries and an orange.\n\nOverall it was average and I might have ordered the wrong items or had a orange juice batch without the best oranges. I would return to try something else.", "author": "Dave S."}

My friend and I ordered the lemon dill crab cake benedict with a side of fried potatoes. The crab cakes were pretty large and super flavorful. They were placed on top of a slice of thick bread (sourdough?), which I prefer over their English muffins. Their hollandaise sauce was very light and I enjoyed that it had a more predominant lemon-y, savory taste to it. The potatoes were so crisp and delicious as well. The meal was really filling but not to the point where I felt terrible after (which I usually do after eating regular eggs benedicts haha). \n\n+ THE ENVIRONMENT\nWe came during a weekday lunch and there was luckily no wait at all. There was plenty of parking in the streets nearby. A big plus for me was that there were ample outdoor seating so it was dog friendly.", "author": "Cindy C."}

When our SUV broke down during a trip in San Francisco, we searched for a place to eat nearby while the vehicle was evaluated.  Luckily Mymy was nearby, and the people at Nissan highly recommended it.  I'm so glad I listened.  Everything was delicious.  It was easy to find a parking space on a weekday around lunch time.  The place is tiny, so I would assume during the weekend this place has a long wait.  Even on a weekday, the place was packed.  I think there are only around 10 small tables, so don't bring a crowd.\n\nAnyway, the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars was 1 reason.  It was mid-Summer and the weather was quite hot, and this place has no air conditioning or at least didn't put it on.  It was uncomfortably hot inside, and everyone - even the staff - were sweating.  If I could give another half star, I would.\n\nThe food?  We tried the breakfast plate with eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon, which was all cooked perfectly.  The French Toast was amazing.  The fresh berries and crisp crust on the toast was perfect.  The banana souffl\u00e9 pancakes were a pleasant surprise.  This is one of those dishes that seems to be everywhere in S.F. these days (every breakfast/brunch menu in town).  I would point out that at some places the souffl\u00e9 pancakes are light and airy and look like a risen souffl\u00e9.  These looked like regular pancakes.  Maybe they fell.  I don't know.  They also used to offer blueberry banana pancakes but I guess they won't put the blueberries in now.  Didn't see why they couldn't add blueberries to mine, but okay.  What stands out is that I'm not a huge fan of bananas to the point I would order that flavor of pancakes, but these were delicious.  So, if someone can cook something you normally wouldn't order, and it is great... chances are a fan of bananas would die for these.\n\nWish the temperature inside was more comfortable, and that they had those blueberry banana pancakes.  Otherwise, highly recommended.  Top notch food.", "author": "David C."}

This gen is nestled in at the corner of California St and Larkin. We got there around 10:30 and we were quite lucky to find a parking spot down the street from the restaurant. Upon walking up to the restaurant, we see a few people lined up outside. They have a line for people to stand in to get a table; no check in sheet, nothing fancy. Just form a line. There was only a few parties in front of us but I think it only took 15-20 minutes to get to the front of thr line and be seated. As we were standing there, the line slowly grew longer and longer. \n\nWe were seated inside by the window (they have indoor and outdoor seating). We originally wanted to sit outside since the weather wasn't bad and we were scared it would be to cramped inside. However, much to our surprise it wasn't. The interior is pretty small but the tables are spaced accordingly so you don't have to worry about hitting the person behind you haha. \n\nAnyways, oncecseated our waitress immediately brought us water and asked if we wanted anything else to drink. And left us to it to look at the menu. We pretty much already knew what we wanted. I ended up ordering the banana pancakes with potatoes and longanisa on the side and my friend ended up getting the Miss MyMy. While we were waiting for our food, I was getting super hungry stating at everyone elses food. Everything looked so good!

Look what we have here...\n\nA couple of my friends and I decided to try Mymy after disappointingly turning down Mama's due to their extensive wait time. We figured, as a party of 8, it would be highly unlikely that we land a table within the next hour or so. With that, we decided to take a little drive a few streets down and try Mymy instead.\n\nNow, if you already know how brunch goes down in San Francisco, it goes a little something like this: \n-if your driver friend is smart enough, they'd drop you and your friends off at the front while driving around aimlessly for almost an hour finding parking, JUST so you could land in the front of the line outside the restaurant.\n-Once you manage to write your name down, you hope that the wait time is under an hour, especially since you decided to skip early breakfast in order to fully enjoy your Brunch meal.\n-Your name is finally called half an hour later (which is barely a wait in the city without a reservation), are starving, and while looking at the menu, decide to order all the foods.\n\nFortunately, our entire party of 8 had only waited a mere 15 minutes for our table. Granted that we were seated outdoors, we had to admit, it happened to be a really, REALLY nice day in the city that given morning, so it was very hard to complain.\n\nFor my meal, I really wanted to try something I have never tried before. I skipped on everything typical 'brunch-like' such as the pancakes, waffles, eggs benedict, scrambled eggs and sausage...all of that. Instead, I had decided to opt for the CHORIZO JALAPE\u00d1O TARTINE ($14), which consisted of pepper jack scramble chorizo, roasted jalape\u00f1os, chipotle aioli, and roasted miche.\n\nNO RAGRATS WHATSOEVER.\n\nThis had to have been the best damn brunch I had tasted in a looong time. Real talk, folks.\n\nWhat I loved most about it was the side of freshly made, crunchy on the outside - moist on the inside, seasoned potatoes and that bomb AF chipotle aioli that was topped on my eggs and Tartine bread (SF reppin').\n\nWhat I also love about this place is that they support local Bay Area bakeries and foods to use in their dishes. I find it really hard to love a restaurant that doesn't support fellow locals in the food business.\n\nAnother popular pick from our group was, of course, the Eggs Tartine ($13) which is basically almost the same thing as the Chorizo Jalapeno Tartine, but without all the spicy ingredients. This meal is perfect for those who'd prefer a more mellow brunch option.\n\nOur server throughout our experience was on top of her game the entire time, topping off our water cups and asking if we needed additional silverware or condiments. She tabled everyone seated outside the restaurant as well as some tables inside, and with that, have to give her major kudos for putting up with all the needs of our big party.\n\nA major downside to this place is definitely the parking situation....and I'm sure all of you who went here by car can agree. The parking struggle is r-e-a-l in this part of town. So, unless you drive a SMART car or something,   almost guaranteed that it will take you at least 20 minutes to find a decent spot around here.\n\nOtherwise, I definitely plan to come back again soon (maybe with a rented SMART car) so I could try more of their \"House Favori\" items!\n\n+Street parking only\n+California Street cable car also rolls through this location, if you are used to taking that method of transportation", "author": "Kate T."}

They put their own special twist on the classic breakfast dishes. For example, I ordered their crab and shrimp cake benedict, and that was probably one of the best Benedicts I've ever had (and I've had a lot!). I give it 5/5 stars! The crab and shrimp tasted so fresh but not overpowering. It had the perfect amount of crisp. The green sauce they drizzled it with was creamy and kind of garlic-y which I love. I highly recommend it! My bf got the BLT benedict and that also was super delicious. My favorite part about my experience here is the red velvet latte. Once I saw it on the menu, I knew I had to get it. I was more curious about what it looked like rather than its taste. It came out red and beautiful and served in a clear glass mug, and I know people were looking at it when they served it to me! It's so pretty to look at!

When we finally got our table, we requested some water. They gave us a small jug with four glasses (it was definitely not plenty for a group of four dehydrated individuals).

We got the following this time:\n\nSalmon tartine (5/5): an open faced sandwich that comes with scrambled eggs, smoked salmon, avocado, and some kind of creamy dill sauce on top of a single slice of rustic bread. It was very good, and I liked the crispy fried breakfast potatoes that went with it. \n\nChallah French toast (3.5-4/5): this was good but not particularly memorable, although my daughter loved and ate all the fruit that came with it. The French toast came with a single strip of bacon on top that somehow felt slapped on and not part of the dish; I wish for ease of eating that it had come chopped or crumbled on top.\n\nFor next time, I'd probably stick with their savory dishes, which we've loved.", "author": "Rachel L."}

Most places were closed but this restaurant was open till the afternoon so we headed over only to find a long line of people who had the same idea as us. As the line moved we decided what we wanted and since we were waiting around 25 mins that was plenty of time.  \n\nThe restaurant itself has a cosy interior with seating both inside and outside. We sat inside as it was a cold outside. The staff is very quick here so we promptly got our coffee and the food followed shortly. \nWe tried the Norwegian benedict ($14.50) , Salmon tartine ($14.50) and the French toast ($13.00).  The food presentation was fantastic ( specially the French toast ) 8.5/10 and everything tasted very fresh and delicious. All dishes were really good, the toast was perfectly sweet and fluffy 8.5/10, the tartine had a huge piece of salmon and avocado with the eggs 8.5/10 and lastly the eggs benedict were divine 10/10. All dishes were served with their house potatoes which were crispy and delicious 8.5/10. \n\nNote: The portions were big and allow for sharing too which was great. The coffee has free refills and was appreciated on a cold day but is not any special bean, just regular hot coffee. \n\nOverall the meal was approx $20.00+ per person which is not exactly as economical as other places but definitely has really good food and I recommend it to all. \n\nWill be back for sure!

No longer do they serve the crispy sheets of hash browns, they serve home fries instead now.\n\nServers literally only come peek at your table to see how far along you are with your meal. They do it quite often and never once bother to talk to you unless you flag them down. They don't bother to play it off or ask you \"How's everything going?\" They don't smile and look like everything inconveniences them. My brother ordered an iced tea and it never came so we had to remind them and by that time, our food already came.\n\nYes, their food is pretty good but we started coming here since they've opened and the last few times have been good but during our last visit,  we've noticed the food quality went down. They started cheaping out on ingredients even though they've raised their prices. I ordered a side of toast because I didn't want my tortilla and it was $3.50!!!! Seriously for 2 slices of bread and some butter? \n\nTo put the cherry on top, they forgot our bill... I'm literally sitting here writing this review right now waiting for the bill. To get a better sense of how long it took. I started writing this review on my IPhone before we were able to flag a server down, finally flagged one down, she cleared the table, we waited...we finished our water, we waited a lot more...and then they finally came back with the bill. They didn't come back to pick up our card so my brother had to run in to give it to them.\n\nRidiculous. There's more brunch places in SF.

Brunch at Mymy....\n\nIt's easy to get too used to the bajillion fancy brunch places of SF, when non-millionaire's bacon is boring, when Benedict runny egg yolk pops are becoming too commonplace on Instagram, when you become weary of the standard hour-long wait. But despite four years of hard-core brunching in SF, I was impressed by Mymy and left with the same starry-eyed happiness. \n\nMymy features brunch staples, with a bouge upgrade--think 6-hour corned beef hash, custardy French toast, pancakes with caramelized bananas, a salivation-inducing side of a sheet of hash browns. They also make fresh grapefruit juice or orange juice mimosas. Prices are reasonable (~$15), and we got away with sharing three entrees for four people and still ended up taking potatoes to-go (best breakfast leftovers ever). \n\n(+++) Lemon dill crab cake Benedict: Not that you can go wrong with crab cakes... but Mymy's version is excellent, with fresh crab surrounded by a crispy panko coating and topped with an herbal housemade lemon dill Hollandaise. The contrasting dimensions and complementary flavors are on point, not too dry or soggy, not too rich and overall excellent.\n\n(++) Salmon rotolone tartine: Smoked salmon with *avocado!* and soft scrambled eggs over a slab of bread. At first glance it almost looks like yet another pricey toast, but it comes together really well as a delicious and satisfying entree. The bread is artisan bakery-grade, with a rustic chewy crust and a soft fluffy interior that tastes like sourdough--the perfect vehicle for lox/eggs/avo and a drizzle of the yummy dill sauce.\n\n(+++) Blueberry banana souffle pancakes: It has the same wow factor as the souffle pancakes from Griddle Fresh in Noe Valley, with a magically fluffy texture and an impressive layer of meringue in the middle. How I can go back to non-souffle pancakes, I do not know. The blueberry banana sauce was delicious, fruity but not too sweet, and the presentation with the blue and yellow swirls is beautiful with latte-art-like design. It also comes with syrup, which is also great quality but isn't needed, but of course I poured it over my pancakes for the Instagram.\n\nThe ambiance is cozy, and Mymy feels like a niche of a family-run local business on the edge of Downtown SF (which I particularly appreciate, given gentrification and the somewhat gilded vibes of shiny new brunch places.)\n\nAs with all popular brunch places in SF, I highly recommend coming on weekdays if possible, or early on weekends. Otherwise, be prepared for a grueling long wait and the need to fight over street parking (metered and non-metered nearby). At the end of the day though, it's all worth it and you will leave with a very happy stomach (and Instagram).", "author": "Edna C."}

The restaurant does not take reservations and a hostess does not put your name on a list. You simply wait in line on the sidewalk. Yes, you heard me correctly. You wait in line for your table. At first I was a little thrown off, but we were second in line and it moved pretty quickly, especially since we had 6 in our party.\n\nWe were seated at a table outside. It took about 10 minutes to be asked for our drink order and of course by then we were ready to order food as well. The group started with a mimosa carafe ($18) with grape fruit juice. I'm more into that tomato juice AM vibe so I grabbed one of their Bloody Mary's made with soju ($9). I didn't try the mimosa (you can't mess one of those up anyways) but my Bloody Mary was fresh, spicy and had the perfect amount of garnishes. \n\nIt was almost 1 PM, and although I almost never turn down breakfast, the Blackberry Grilled Shrimp Salad (garlicky grilled shrimp, spinach, arugula, greens, chopped avocado, toasted almonds, blackberry and cabernet sauvignon dressing - $14) caught my eye.

Freshly cut strawberries and butter/syrup are on the side. This was so much better than a lemon meringue pie.\n\nThe matcha latte and pistachio lattes were delicious and worth getting as well.

Their Bloody Mary is actually made with sake instead of vodka, but I was into it. \n\nWhile they don't serve bottomless mimosas, they do have large pitchers of orange juice or grapefruit juice mimosas, which make drinking with a large group more economical. \n\nThe restaurant itself is pretty small, but if you can snag an outside table on a nice day, MyMys feels like the perfect brunch spot.", "author": "Liz S."}

This place probably gets crowded during the weekends, but I came around 12PM on a weekday, and there wasn't any wait at all, although it was quite crowded still. \n\nAMBIANCE:\nSome chill, jazzy, bossanova-like music playing in the background. It's a rather small place, but there's seating both inside and outside. Waiters/tresses are all very friendly. \n\nFOOD: \n1) Smoked Salmon Benedict - Two poached eggs with delicious smoked salmon, wilted spinach, and capers on a slice of fine bread with some crispy potatoes on the side. The flavors went so well together, and definitely a good portion for the Benedict. I'm typically quite picky about my potatoes, and though these potatoes weren't the best I've had, I enjoyed that they had a crispy exterior. \n2) Lemon Ricotta Souffl\u00e9 Pancake - Highlight of my meal! I've never had pancake like this, though I know quite a few places in SF serve this kind of pancake. It came with two fluffy pancakes with a glob of butter and seasonal fruits (berries in this case). The pancakes were so fluffy, and the middle was very fluffy, very much like a souffl\u00e9, but also therefore not a lot of flavor. However, the surrounding part had a good amount of lemon flavor.", "author": "Jacqueline T."}

To begin, the place is cute inside and was quite busy at 9am on a Thursday. I was seated immediately and ordered my entree. It was brought to me within about 5 minutes, which I found to be very quick. This always makes me think that the food has been sitting out and not being prepared fresh. I ordered the Frisco scramble with egg whites. The scramble came with a side of potatoes and toast. \n\nThe reason I am giving this restaurant 3 stars is because my food was quite cold when it was brought to me. The potatoes were also room temperature and it was apparent that they had been sitting out for quite some time. The egg whites in my scramble were also a bit runny.\n\nWhen I received my breakfast, I was so excited because it looked quite great!

Every few months they also come up with new dishes for everyone to try as well. \n\nI love their scrambles.  They change the specific selection. However my recent fav has been the TexMex.  All scrambled eggs are so fluffy and the potatoes add a nice touch.  The mix of flavors do really well.  Their tartines are generally pretty good.  You have to eat it with the bread on the bottom.  This adds to the full dish's experience.  \n\nA sweet alternative for brunch would be their banana souffl\u00e9 pancakes. It's not too sweet to overwhelm you.  However it's an additction for my taste buds.  They are so fluffy and melts in your mouth.  I'm generally not a sweet person, but I still like it.  \n\nOn to drink choices.  I like their special coffee drinks.  My pick is the pistachio latte. You can really taste the pistachio in the drink.  Like any other gourmet latte, it's great coffee with a cute design on top as well.  I also like their soju Bloody Mary.  I probably still think Mama's on Washington Square Bloody Mary is better, but Mymy's is still good.

I visited Mymy again for the second time and had a pretty great experience. \n\nInterestingly enough, Mymy is one of my many favorite brunch places run by Asian management. I'm surprised I haven't heard about this place more, as I only heard about it from one friend. You can identify this place pretty well by spotting the long lines outside of the storefront near Polk Street.\n\nBe prepared to wait, or come early! I came around 10 AM the first time and waited probably 10-15 minutes to seat a group of 4. This time around, I came around 9 and to my surprise the place looked busier than usual - but that makes sense given the day I went was Father's Day. The staff will get a headcount of everyone's groups and arrange seating accordingly. I would say that groups typically range between 2-4 people as the restaurant is quite small. There is outdoor seating as well. The waiters here are visibly very busy and rushed, so props to them for managing this place well!\n\nThe menu consists of your standard brunch dishes such as scrambles, omelettes, pancakes etc. Entrees will run you about $13-15 which I consider a great value. Generally in my experience, the food has been very plentiful and filling! \n\nFrisco Scramble - Chicken apple sausage, leeks, shallot, tomato, avocado, cheddar. Comes with a side of potatoes and whole wheat toast. I was curious to try the chicken apple sausage and it did not disappoint. The scramble and potatoes were very flavorful overall and I happily took some home for leftovers! My main criticism is that the ratio of the scramble to potatoes seemed a bit off.. as there were a lot more potatoes to fill up the plate than expected. It also cost's $2 to replace potatoes with fruits which seems kind of unreasonable to me (wouldn't the potatoes take more effort..?)", "author": "Chelsea W."}

Honestly, all of a SF brunch places are extremely overpriced but this place I would wait for. \n\nOrdering + service: Of course the wait is long, probably an hour or more. It's not the largest brunch places, but some added outdoor seating makes it medium sized. The servers aren't the nicest but they are far from unsatisfactory. \n\nFOOD: I've been here several times. The first few times they accompanied these flat hash browns but this time they served us crispy potatoes. Not that I'm complaining because I prefer crispy ones. But if you're looking for that hash brown, it ain't there right now. \n\n- Challah Bread French Toast (4.5/5): It was pretty damn good. I struggle with finding sweet brunch that is over indulgent and makes me go into sugar overload. But I think that the strawberries, cream and bacon give you the left tart and savory, coupled to a not overly sweet challah toast. It was above average, you can't go wrong with ordering this. \n\n- Salmon Tartine (5/5): I love smoked salmon and this was really amazing, paired with a perfectly cut hipster avocado. The egg omelette was soft and supple and the picked red onion added a kick that upped the dish even more. \n\n- Parma flavor benedict (4/5): It was an above average, perfectly poached egg, great flavor combo benedict. We needed a savory that didn't have lemon dill sauce, so we tried this. And it was pretty god with fresh tomato, mozzarella, and nicely stringy prosciutto (because you know how prosciutto is odd like that). \n\n- Lemon dill crab cake benedict (5/5)!!!: Can I say 6/5? It was perfect with the dill sauce. The spinach was perfect. I don't know how to describe. It's simply my favorite brunch in ALL OF SF.

Actually, I only really like deviled eggs, but that is a topic for another day. We went here because when I am on vacation, I like to try new places that are not obvious, and I like to push myself. So based on the reviews, we came to Mymy, which was a .5 mile walk from our hotel. We were completely impressed. I highly doubt the place has more than 10 tables, but the service was so incredible. And, even though I don't like eggs, apparently their benedicts are really popular. I can see why. I had the lemon dill crabcake benedict and my husband had the baja california benedict. Both of us cleaned our plates. Mind you, we came at 8:30 on a Wednesday morning and this place was hopping. OH and I almost forgot.... the potatoes! Omg..  those potatoes were EVERYTHING! So, definitely go!", "author": "Courtney R."}

We got seated within 15 minutes. I'm super impatient when it comes to waiting so this was a plus! They don't have a waiting list; you have to physically be in line to save a spot. They also don't seat on a first come first serve basis. Instead they seat you based on the number of your party. The restaurant itself is pretty small and in a shape of an L. They have additional seating outside, but the cold San Francisco weather makes it almost unbearable. \n\nI ordered the frisco scramble and substituted the cheddar for pepper jack cheese. The tomatoes were too watery and made my whole omelet soggy, which I'm not really a fan of but overall it wasn't bad. They no longer serve their breakfast items with hash browns ): so sadddd but their crispy potatoes are pretty good! My brother got the Norwegian Benedict and really liked it. \n\nThe service was great! Servers were really friendly and refilled our coffee multiple times.

Maybe even more important. We just love brunch THAT much. \n\nThis place lived up to our brunch expectations!\n\nFirst of all, the staff is efficient without being pushy. I cannot stand it when the staff makes you feel like you're in a hurry to order, eat and then get the heck out. They don't do that here! And better yet is that the food comes out within 10 minutes of you ordering. Um, AWESOME SAUCE.\n\nSecond, the food is DELICIOUS. Crab cake Benedict is the best I've ever had. My tastebuds did a happy dance as I enjoyed every bite and morsel of that dish. And the french toast? Can I get a HAIL MARY for the french toast?! I don't typically like sweet things for breakfast. I've always been more of a meat and eggs kind of gal, but the french toast can and probably has changed my mind and mouth forever. The potatoes.... oh LAWD. The potatoes are amazing. Perfectly crisp on the outside--just the way I like it.\n\nThird, it's not crazy expensive. It's your typical brunch prices, but the quality is sooo much better than most places I've gone to in SF. \n\nSo summary of this review:\n1) Order anything.\n2) Make sure you get a side of potatoes.\n3) Consider coming back to try everything on the menu.", "author": "Tracy D."}

It's run by a couple of Vietnamese owners, but they sure know how to serve an American breakfast!\n\nInitially, I was worried about the crowds, based on all the reviews I had read, but I think that might just be a weekend thing, because I was seated immediately on a Tuesday morning. However, with the restaurant being so small, it didn't take long for it to feel full. I ordered the Norwegian eggs benedict, which comes with two perfectly poached eggs (and I really mean PERFECTLY), on top of a generous portion of frseh smoked salmon, and some greens, all on top of a nice piece of toast. The bread wasn't too tough like some places, and it's really easy to cut through, especially when you pop the eggs and let all the yolk drizzle out and get soaked up by the bread, making each bite completely yolktastic. I asked for my hollandaise sauce on the side, but it had a really nice lemon-y texture, which worked really well with the salmon. \n\nUsually, it comes served with hashbrowns, but I opted to substitute in fruit for an extra $2. The bowl of fruit was small, but it had a good variety of berries, cantaloupe, pineapple, grapes, and a papaya slice. With the fruit substitution, the dish was $18. Pretty typical for the San Francisco area, I'd say.\n\nAll in all, Mymy knows what it's doing! Service was extremely quick and friendly (I was in and out in less than 30 minutes). I can definitely imagine crowds being an issue on the weekends or later in the morning, so don't plan on coming here with a huge group, and just try to be early in general!

The scramble was very flavorful with the spices, onions, and meat mixed inside topped with avocado and salsa. The hash browns were amaaazing! Thin and crispy! I really don't like thick hash browns that are still mushy in the middles so these were probably the best hash browns I've ever had! The corn tortillas come wrapped in foil that you can use to eat the scramble with like a breakfast taco!\n\nDill Shrimp Crab Cake Benedict: Also yummy! This was my mom's favorite.

Once again served with a side of those amazing hash browns!\n\nLemon Ricotta Souffle Pancakes: Very fluffy thanks to the ricotta! But kinda heavy. These were a little disappointing tbh.

As you may have noticed from the other reviews, the line is obnoxious and long on weekends especially. Here's my trick: this is not a group brunch place. Even three people is pushing it. The seating is limited, and it's going to take you a long time to grab a table for 4 or more people. It's perfect for 1 or 2 though - their service is fast, so turnover for two-tops is pretty quick. I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes with 2 people. And with that wait, it's definitely worth it. The savory options are the best for sure - I'm partial to the scrambles, since I'm not a big benedict person. This time around I got the Harvest Time scramble, which was pretty unique with some great Mediterranean flavors (big fan of the Kalamata olives!). The crispy potatoes are fantastic, although I will join the chorus of folks mourning the next level hashbrowns that used to come with everything - goddamnit, I miss those hashbrowns. Their coffee is pretty good (my coffee snob SO endorses it!), and they sometimes have unique lattes which are nice (last time I got a pistachio one).

There's usually a line queued up outside on weekends, but weekday mornings don't seem too bad when I've passed by. My friends and I came on a Friday around 11:30am and had to wait maybe 15 min for a table for 4. There's no waiting list or anything so you have to actually stand in line and your whole group has to be there to be seated.\n\nThe place is very small so I wouldn't recommend coming in a large group. 2 is probably ideal in terms of getting a table more quickly, but up to 4 people is reasonable. There's a very homey, diner-like feel inside that reminded me of diners in Tahoe for some reason.\n\nClassic brunch menu with eggs (scrambles, benedicts) and sweets (pancakes, french toast) as well as a lunch menu after 11 with sandwiches, salads and burgers. Only a few things stood out to me: the Corned Beef Hash, which I got, and the Spicy Pop Pork Scramble, which a friend got and I tried a bit of.\n\nFood was served pretty quickly and while it was pretty tasty, I didn't find it to be mindblowing. The poached eggs in me and my friend's Corned Beef Hashes were very overcooked when they were first served to us, so that was incredibly disappointing, but when we showed our waiter, he took our plates back without a fuss and brought them back with perfectly poached eggs. The portions looked pretty big but I didn't find myself to be quite satisfied and one friend said she was still hungry after too. However, Mymy is probably one of the cheaper brunch spots with most dishes being $13-15.\n\n* 6 HRS CORNED BEEF HASH ($14) - 4/5\n[corned beef brisket, onion, bell pepper, lemon dill, 2 poached eggs w/ toast & crispy potatoes]\nI was a little uncertain about getting this at first because I've definitely had overly salty corned beef one too many times, but I wanted something very savory and was not disappointed. Their corned beef were perfect little bites of flavor. Super tender and just salty enough. I loved the grilled peppers and onions too, which added a little sweetness and balanced out the corned beef. Of course a perfectly runny yolk pulled the hash together. I asked for mine with a side salad instead of the potatoes, which they substituted without charging extra (substituting fruit instead is an extra $2)\n\n* SPICY POP PORK SCRAMBLE ($13) - 4/5\n[house-braised chipotle pulled pork, onion, roma tomato, pepper jack w/ toast & hashbrown]\nHad a bite of my friend's scramble and thought the pulled pork was delicious! Loved the sweet chipotle flavor and crispy hash browns, but I felt like the portion size was on the smaller side. No wonder she wasn't full after.\n\nOverall, not a bad brunch spot but nothing really screams at me to come back.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Be prepared to wait on sidewalk for brunch.\n\n[FOOD]\nCRAB FISH BEIGNETS WITH HOLLANDAISE SAUCE [3/5]: It's essentially 2 egg benedicts with a special lemon sauce that's unique to Mymy. It's hard to consume this dish elegantly because everything just explodes and turns into a mush. By then the dish doesn't taste any different than a regular egg benedict. They also came with a plate-full of hash brown. \n\nTEX MEX SCRAMBLE [3/5]: Egg scramble cooked with salsa, potato, avocado, and what tasted like thousand island sauce, served with 3 soft tortilla and a plate-full of hash browns. It was savory and a little spicy, but did not stand out too much. \n\n[PRICE]\n$13-20/dish, which is typical of brunch in SF. With tips/tax, you'll be paying ~$20. Yes this is expensive, like everything else in the city I guess you are partly paying for the experience (which including waiting lol). \n\n[SERVICE/SETTING]\nLimited seating inside and 3-4 tables for 2 only outside. Very cozy interior, but your clothes may be stained with a little greasy smell. Be prepared to wait outside if you have a large party.

Literally, beaten egg whites. No sugar, slightly savory. I'm thinking... did they make this wrong? So I asked the server. No hesitation, when I asked if it was supposed to be like that, it tasted like just egg, he said \"Yes. Souffl\u00e9.\"\nOk now I know you put beaten egg white into a souffl\u00e9 anything, having made souffl\u00e9s myself. But since when do you glob on the egg whites and not fold it into the batter?! I had to scoop it all out (see pics) of the pancakes, it was so strange on my palate. And because the egg whites weren't folded into the batter before cooking, the pancake itself was almost as dense as bread with a lemony flavor. We couldn't finish it.

And it really means a lot when my foodie fianc\u00e9 says \"This is the most delicious thing I've eaten in a long time\" in regards to the Tex-Mex scramble. SO delicious and flavorful. \n\nAlso had the banana pancakes; I only ate the edges of this (it was that good and filling).

HELL.\n\nLocated on a busy street corner, I was surprised to discover that the huge crowd of people outside weren't pedestrians, but actually people in line to get in! If there's any sign of a good brunch spot, that's one of em.  \n\nAs our last spot before heading to SFO, and even with huge luggage in tow, they were able to seat us almost immediately and kept our luggage stowed safely, which I appreciated.\n\nIt's a very small cafe, and there's indoor and outdoor seating.  So as to not miss our flight, we took whatever table we could get, but outdoor seating would have been nice too.  Since we ubered there, can't say much about the parking situation, but this is SF, so who's driving anyway? Lol.\n\nThe service is quick, efficient, and friendly.  The staff answer all questions and were very attentive despite how busy it was.  The menu had much more than I anticipated, and it's definitely not a Norm's or IHOP brunch spot.  If you're eating here, you're eating goooood, lol.\n\nOriginally we started with coffees and the intent to just have something simple like pancakes and eggs, but that was quickly out the window after we saw the carafe of mimosas on the menu.\n\nI had the seafood eggs benedict and my boyfriend had the hash dish.  BOMB. Everything was fresh, and you can see them preparing it as the kitchen is within clear view of the dining area.  This is awesome if you like to watch your food get prepared, but bad if you're buzzed on mimosas and your eyes are bigger than your stomach.  Long story short, we ended up ordering more food .  And LET ME TELL YOU, the lemon ricotta pancakes are HEAVEN.  Plus, with fresh fruit on the side, there was no need to feel as bad about all the other bad choices we had made that morning lol.\n\nOverall, 10/10 would come back, and 10/10 HIGHLY recommend.  I ended up falling asleep in the uber on the way to the airport and BARELY made it through TSA, but worth it? HELL YEAH.", "author": "Katrina D."}

Eggs were poached perfectly and on a nice thick english muffin with a thin layer of fried hash browns.\n\nThe lemon ricotta souffle pancakes were a huge portion, just not my cup of tea. Not quite as flavorful as I was expecting, and the souffle portion was just a really weird texture combo with the pancakes.\n\nOverall, a solid brunch spot, that I'm not quite sure is worth travelling for.

Oh and it's always awesome when I get to check another breakfast or brunch place off my list.\n\nI picked Mymy for its excellent reviews and scrumptious-looking food photos. Luckily my parents and I are morning people so we arrived first thing in the morning on Sunday. There were also a few people waiting for the restaurant to open, and the wait only got crazier. All the staff members here are so efficient and hard-working. Even my dad commented.\n\nMy eyes were glued to the banana blueberry souffl\u00e9 pancake on the menu. I don't normally like pancakes, so I took a leap of faith. The description was a mascarpone cheese stuffed pancake with vanilla curd and candied walnuts. WHAT!! How does that NOT sound amazing. The two pancakes tasted as good as it sounded. One of the best I've ever had. The pancakes came with butter and syrup, but it was sweet enough as it was.\n\nMymy is a tiny restaurant with limited indoor seating, but they also have patio seating that lines the outdoor walls. Get here early (first thing in the morning if possible) so you don't have to wait in line. Apparently you need to form a physical line, not just write your name down on a list.

We got the crab cake with shrimp one and the Norwegian one. Both delicious! Green sauce on the crab cake is a bit overwhelming, but it's okay. Norwegian benedict had a good amount of smoked salmon. I wish the egg yolk was a bit more runny, but it was still good. I'm glad I split two different ones to be able to try both. My favorite part of the breakfast though is the HASH BROWN. Super thin, light, crispy, and such a big piece. My friends got the tex mex scramble (looked bomb diggity) and also the souffl\u00e9 pancake (very fluffy.)

Their food is wonderful, nothing to complain about. \n\nHowever, Mymy's service is probably one of the worst I've ever experienced. It's like they go out of their way to be rude and make dining more difficult. I understand there is always a long line and you want the tables to turnover as quickly as possible, but it does not mean patrons should be treated with disrespect. \n\nDuring one of my visits, I was with a group of 3. After waiting 30 minutes, we were seated at a table that fits 4. We told the waiter that we had another friend coming toward the end of our meal who would NOT be eating; he was literally going to sit and wait until we finished. Understandably, Mymy does not seat you unless your whole party is there. We explicitly said he was not going to order, so it was not going to prolong our meal at all. Our waiter refused immediately and said it was not possible. His reasoning was \"because it was policy\" and then proceeded to go out of his way to REMOVE the fourth chair that was at the table already. He literally was petty enough to remove the chair - one that he would not have touched if we weren't trying to be polite and tell him of our friend's arrival in advance.\n\nI don't understand why that was necessary. We were not hurting business in any way and would have taken just as long to eat regardless of if my friend showed up or not. \n\nI went back again recently (because the food is actually good). My party of 2 was seated outside and the sun was smack in my face. I moved my chair to another side of the table so I wouldn't be facing the sun. Someone else at a table right next to mine was also seated on the same side. Our waiter came up and said I could not sit with my chair on that side. Sure, that's fine - but then why do you let other tables sit like that? Why is your policy inconsistent across parties?\n\nI will definitely not return to Mymy after this experience. Sure, their food is worth waiting for, but I don't believe that makes up for the rude waiters / management, who frankly make it quite obvious that they are trying to turn over the table as fast as possible.

My friend and I decided we wanted to get brunch here so we arrived around 1140 and there was a verrry long line waiting for seating. Intimidating, yes. Worth to wait around? Yes, because why? The line goes by quick, these people here def KNOW how to get you in and out in a timely proficient but NOT RUSHING manner. Got seated within 20 minutes in an outside table which was absolutely divine as the weather today was clear, sunny skies with a little breeze.\n\nKnowing my options were kinda limited didn't intimidate me at all. So what if they don't have much \"variety\" for the vegheads out there (btw this is still veg friendly for those who eat eggs, but I do not), YOU DON'T NEED a variety of options to enjoy a pleasant brunch w a friend! After viewing all the options they had available and contemplating if I should just order a sandwich but take out the meat and cheese, I decided no, Imma CARB the f up. Sides of potatoes are $4 a plate? Shooot, let's go. I asked the server to give me 2. She stopped me for a second and mentioned that my friend I was with ordered a benedict combo already came with crispy potatoes! And I said, yesss I know, but these potatoes are just for me. Can I get two sides of it and a side of sliced avocado ($3) ? And she said oh! Okay.\n\nNow deep down inside my heart I knew not to expect much because I mean, going out to eat as a vegan really can be a trial sometimes and you just know you cant really eat what you desire out since most of the amazing food is cooked at home, so I was just prepping myself to be served with my friends benedict in a beautiful platter while I would get 3 separate small plate appetizers as mine. \n\nLO AND BEHOLD, we get our plates and they beautifully put both orders of the potatoes onto one plate with the sliced avocado on the corner and one orange slice on the other corner, essentially making my plate look like a normal little brunch platter to match my friends. \n\nI was ecstatic. Peep my pics posted for the plate.\n\nANYWAY, stuffed myself to the brim w these taters which if you're wondering, are TOTALLY worth it. Absolutely unhealthy, but who cares, CRISPY, fully cooked on the inside, seasoned perfectly. Amazing.\n\nMy friend got the proscuitto benedict and fully enjoyed hers too!! She couldn't even finish it!\n\nAnyway, I was more than impressed with this place just because of that whole way they plated for me. I KNOW THAT MAY SEEM SO LAME TO SOME OF YOU, but to me, it really made an impact. The little things matter :'). Thank you MyMy!", "author": "Kaitlyn E."}

The poached eggs were also made flawlessly and both of us swear that these English muffins were much larger than normal. We also liked the addition of a generous tomato slice and the grilled asparagus. However, the crispy hashbrowns were maybe just a bit too crispy as they were more like a potato chip than hashbrowns. But overall, this was a very delicious dish.\n\nFor our sweet dish, we opted for the lemon ricotta pancake. I 100% appreciated the fact that it wasn't delivered smothered in sweet sauces. It was just lightly dusted with powdered sugar and delivered with maple syrup on the side. This really allowed for us to pick up on the lemon flavor. Without a doubt, these pancakes were also amazingly cloud-like and a perfect choice for a sweet (but not too sweet) option!\n\nAll in all, mom and I were happy with our choices.

My friends and I originally had plans to go to another place for brunch but due to a long wait, we decided to find a different place to eat. Stumbling down ten blocks, the four of us went inside Mymy around 1:45pm and luckily, there was no wait. We were able to snag a table in the back before the restaurant filled up. \n\nOne of my friends already tried the place before so she recommended her favorite dishes and we went along with her choices. For the four of us, we shared the: \n-vanilla sponge french toast\n-lemon ricotta souffle pancake\n-lemon dill crab shrimp cake benedicts\n-salmon rotolone tartine\n\nOMG THE BENEDICTS! AND THE HASH BROWNS! They were worth every penny of the $16.50 spent. Crab cake was excellent and I love the lemon dill sauce drizzled on top. Aside from that, the hash browns was super crispy and thin and altogether that entire dish is a 10/10! If you have to get only one item, I would suggest this one!\n\nThe rest of the food was also very delicious but kind of pales in comparison to the benedicts. I do like the pancakes because they had a lemon ricotta souffle inside of the pancakes which gave it a light and fluffy taste almost like a sponge cake. French toast and salmon tartine was also great. The tartine came with a side of crispy wedges so that was good!\n\nAmbiance wise, it has a diner cafe feel even though outside would make me think it was some fancy restaurant. Service wise, there wasn't any problems. Our bill came out to around $70 and they had already added the gratuity 15% and tax to it. I'm not sure if they normally do that for parties of four people but take note of your bill so you don't end up double tipping.  \n\nOverall, great little place.

Bonus points for double refills on the coffee. Ordered the Dungeness crab Benedict (no avocado, chive instead of jalape\u00f1o and bell pepper sauce). Heads up, it comes on toast and not English muffins. Eggs were beautifully poached. The crab was scrumptious, I just wish it was a patty rather than a thin smear across the toast. Essentially, you're eating poached eggs on a crab tartine with hollandaise sauce. The accompanying shrimp were small but well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Potatoes were hot and rustic. Recommend getting a side of bacon to enhance this dish with layer of smoked savoriness. Overall, a nice place for a hearty breakfast if you're in the neighborhood.

I don't know if it's just coincidence but every time I come here, there's always a guy near the door so as I walk in, he greets me. Maybe he was on his way to check in on the tables outside, but I'm just going to keep believing he was there for me. :D \n\nFOOD: This is the part that was surprisingly disappointing to me. My grandpa does not get out much for food so I like to take him around the city when I can to explore the diverse culinary culture that this city is known for! The banana blueberry souffle pancakes were dry despite all the vanilla and berry compote. The potatoes were a tad over-fried in my opinion and the small scrappy pieces make me feel like I got the end of the batch. I ordered the MOT sausage burger which is basically a brunch-style egg sandwich. Now that was pretty darn good with the Italian pork sausage, grilled oyster mushrooms and fluffy bun. But, I've also tried their smoked salmon benedict which was a little on the salty side. \n\nATMOSPHERE: Nothing to brag about. If I remember correctly,the inside has a bit of a Spanish vibe to it with the villa-esque orange walls and artwork. Tables are mildly close together so get comfy! The inside is shaded well so if you get seated by the window, you can enjoy the warm summer afternoon without feeling the burn of it!", "author": "Greg Y."}

I was early to meet a friend and waited less than 10 minutes before someone asked me to go inside the restaurant. I think Mymy is much better than some of other American brunch places in the Bay area that either lean too greasy (like Brenda's...) or are too expensive for eggs and toast. The service is actually really quick, which makes sense given that most of the menu is a twist on either eggs & toast or waffles/pancakes. I got the mediterranean eggs with toast, which came with olives, asparagus, spinach, ricotta, and hemp seeds cooked into the eggs. The portions are on the bigger side so you get two meals in for one :).", "author": "Meryam B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-11-22", "description": "My brunch experiences in San Francisco have been a bit hit or miss as of late, and while I enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and menu breadth at Mymy, the meal itself left a tad bit to be desired. \n\nStar 1: How were the service and atmosphere?\n\nLike I mentioned in the intro, the service and atmosphere at Mymy are a refreshingly homely contrast to the hustle and bustle outside. Like anywhere else in the city, be prepared to wait, but likely not longer than half an hour or so depending on the time of day and the day. There's limited seating that's a bit cramped once you're inside, but the staff run a fluid operation and are willing to pick the waitlist to optimally seat everyone comfortably. Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nBrunch commands a premium these days, but Mymy does a good job of keeping things reasonable even in Nob Hill. While I honestly don't remember the exact price, my depicted Corned Beef Hash was roughly $13.00, which is fair given common brunch prices. Other menu items were priced accordingly. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nI should probably start off by saying that Corned Beef Hash is one of my favorite breakfast dishes, and as a result I've set the bar pretty darn high. \n\nWhether it be the result of a high bar, an expectation that all things San Francisco are excellent, or what have you, I was a bit underwhelmed by this dish for a few reasons.\n\nFirst and foremost, unlike other hash dishes, nothing here really felt combined, and it seemed as though some corned beef was chopped up and put on a plate, some potatoes, peppers and onions were chopped up and put on a plate, and an egg was thrown on top: the end. The result was flavors that didn't at all come together, which was pretty disappointing. \n\nAs for the quality of the dish - the corned beef was dry and bit overcooked, the potatoes flavorless, and the peppers are onions nothing to write home about, making the hash browns by and large the best part of the meal. Corned beef hash is great when done right, and to cook everything together here would have felt quite a bit more right. No Stars Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nI'm not sure I'll be back to Mymy, although my experience could have been an odd one. No Star Granted.", "author": "Paul V."}

I came on a weekday a noon to avoid the wait associated with weekend brunching in the city, and surprisingly found that 80% of the tables were full.  Service was a bit slow (taking our orders, food arriving, and bringing our check), but we weren't in much of a hurry.  I imagine the service on the weekend would be even more sluggish and impersonal with big crowds and a line out the door. Overall, good cozy family-owned ambiance on a nice street corner with indoor and outdoor seating. \n\nBLT Benedict 5/5: YUM! Super impressed with this.  The crispy paper thin hash brown covered the entire plate, and it made the perfect crunch to potato ratio.  The ham over sourdough was juicy and runny with egg, and really savory and rich without being super salty.  This was a great plate because it's pretty unique and doesn't feel like something you could cook at home for breakfast.  \n\nBanana Blueberry Souffle Pancake 3.5/5:  I'm glad I tried this, but I would pass on it next time.  This pancake literally feels like you're eating a fluffy (but bland) egg sandwiched thinly by normal pancake batter.  The blueberries were few and far between, and I didn't really taste any banana.  It was an interesting attempt at combining the traditional dessert souffle into a dish to make it relevant for brunch, but I would have preferred a regular stack of fruity pancakes instead.\n\nWould I come back? Yup, but preemptively knowing to expect a wait.  Maybe I'll spring for weekday brunches instead of the weekend to avoid the rush.

MY MY \"MYMY\"! \n\n1. I got the: Baja California Benedict garlic saut\u00e9ed shrimp, pickled red onion, avocado, roasted bell pepper jalapeno hollandaise.  It was CLIGGIDY CLUTCH CLUTCH CLUTCH. Shrimp cooked perfectly. Red pepper hollandaise was fantastic. The balance of the whole dish was like the crazy guy who walked tight rope across the Grand Canyon. \n\nAlso, can we talk about their hash browns? Their hash browns are the thickness of 4 credit cards stacked together.  They are thin! Which allows them to be super crispy throughout the entire... brown? Both sides! SO GOOD! \n\n2. Chorizo Jalapeno Tartine pepper jack scramble, chorizo and roasted jalapeno relish, chipotle aioli and toasted boule. with crispy wedges. This was fantastic. A really nice vibrant dish that I would probably order the second time I go there. \n\n4. 6 Hours Corned Beef Hash big chunk juicy corned beef brisket, onion, bell pepper, red potatoes, lemon dill, two eggs poach with toast. with crispy wedges. I have to be honest here.  I thought the corned beef tasted a little.. off. I'm not sure what it was... but it just wasn't what I think of to be corned beef. \n\n5. Lemon Ricotta Pancake: All of my patrons were rejoicing at how light and fluffy it was.  Again, I have to be honest- I'd rather it be a little bit denser.  It resembled more of a souffle to me than a pancake.  And I didn't really taste a heavy ricotta or lemon flavor.

The toast had burnt sides and I could taste it even with a good amount of raspberry jam. The eggs were poached nicely but my friend said the whites tasted like plastic to her or just lacked flavor. The sauce was really light but I'm not a big fan of dill. The corn beef hash consisted of shredded meat, red bell peppers, and onions with a bit of a pickled flavor to it. The potatoes were very over fried so there wasn't enough potato. It felt like pure crunch of oil which is not pleasant. It definitely had that good crunch texture though.\n\nMy friend order the blueberry banana pancakes. It comes as a short stack and the to one was just dark enough to have a burnt aftertaste.

Our party of 6 only had to wait 30 mins. The turn around time here was pretty quick so I can appreciate that. The place is small but has both indoor and outdoor seating. Service was friendly and efficient. \n\nThe food left our tummies full and happy. They truly have something for everyone. Whether you're craving a sweet or savory breakfast, this restaurant does not disappoint. We ordered a big variety of dishes but my favorites were the souffl\u00e9 pancakes. Blueberry and lemon were amazing. It was light and fluffy and the souffl\u00e9 in the middle of each pancake was a pleasant surprise. The souffl\u00e9 pancakes are an absolute must!! I loved it sooooooo much! Their benedictions were very good and I had the smoked salmon Benedict with capers. Loved that their hash browns were thin and extra crispy :) \n\nEach dish was $15 on average. Big portions and good quality.

First off, want to preface with saying that I give everyone a fair chance and do not write or give bad reviews for \"no good\" reason without careful thought or out of spite. Second, I was in the restaurant business for 15 years, as a server and manager, so I totally get it that it is extremely hard to pull off and implement an establishment with care and ease with great service, good value, and decent ambiance - this place does none of these.\n\nWe came at about 2pm about 30 min before they closed and waited in line for about 15 minutes, which was fine. Once seated the servers all walk around and are not assigned specific tables. It's haphazard and disorganized. They are not friendly and are borderline rude. My biggest complaint overall is that the whole experience was extremely RUSHED - from beginning to end. \n\nThe food was mediocre, at best. The Baja Benedict was cold. The eggs must have been pre-cooked and they were awful. The potatoes were hard, cold, and had probably been cooked hours before. For $20 I would expect care would be given to this dish. It tasted bland. The blueberry souffle pancakes tasted like something from a bulk box - and the syrup tasted the same - something you buy in bulk from Costco. \n\nOrdered a cappuccino, and she said \"wait\", came back and said \"NO\" we already cleaned it. What kind of establishment cleans their machine before they close down? Ordered a house coffee and again, it was cold and tasted burnt, like it had been sitting on the burner. The server who I informed this to, rudely grabbed the cup from me, grunted, and did not apologize. Brought another cup again and it tasted like it had been nuked. Bad. \n\nDuring service, the food was auctioned off. Any decent establishment will assign each seat as a number, so that whomever is delivering food, will know whom it belongs too. Not good. During service, also no one checked back with us to see if our meal was satisfactory. Not once were we checked back upon - only to drop the check - BEFORE we were done. \n\nWe were one of the last tables to leave and the servers were rushing around trying to get everyone to sign their checks and one server checked several times to see if we had signed. They closed the blinds and started sweeping the floors around us. Rushing, rushing, rushing - to get everyone out of there. \n\nOverall experience. Rushed. Impersonal. Mediocre.

The plate I received looked nothing like the other photos that were posted here about year ago. Also didn't appreciated them putting the butter on top of the fruit. Why not put it on top of the pancakes? I couldn't eat more than 1/4 of it because it was too overwhelming - I have to boycott egg for awhile now. Good thing my husband inhales anything and finished it for me while I ate his potatoes. He had the MOT burger, which was much better but nothing to write home about. \n\nTried it, not impressed, over it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-31", "description": "I write this review with mixed emotions. Part of me wants to be selfish and keep this hidden gem for myself because in a city of foodies, any place that earns the label of a top notch brunch spot will have a wait time of 1+ hours any day of the week. However, in the spirit of Yelp and to reward a restaurant that does a job well done, I have to rave about this place. I randomly found it after searching places to take a visiting friend for brunch. I was initially tempted to visit Mama's, but there is almost always a wait of 45+ minutes even on weekday mornings. Here's the breakdown:\n\nService: Efficient and friendly. We walked in at around 9:30AM on a Tuesday morning. There were a few empty tables so we were seated immediately. They promptly took our drink orders and returned shortly thereafter to get our brunch orders.\n\nAmbiance: Fairly small and quaint, but still welcoming and definitely well maintained.\n\nFood: Luckily there were three of us, so we chose three different items and shared -- Otherwise, I would have been tempted to be a fatty and just order a lot to try it all. To be honest, the pancake pictures sold me in the first place, so my friend ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. I ordered the Crab Cake Benedict, and my bf ordered the Frisco Scramble. The Crab Cake Benedict consists of two crunch crab cakes served atop a thin slice of sourdough bread, each topped with a perfectly poached egg and a dill sauce. Accompanied by a thin layer of hash browns, this entree was spot on. My bf's scramble was pretty good also and was accompanied by toast and hash browns. The Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are amazing. Light and fluffy, these pancakes are unique. There's a layer that just puffs up like a cloud. It's amazing.\n\nDrinks: Since it was brunch, we ordered coffees all around and got free refills accordingly.\n\nCost: Reasonable prices especially considering this is SF!\n\nWould I return? YES, please!", "author": "Leana L."}

After something like a 30-45min wait, we nabbed a seat outside, and ordered their:\n\n* Vanilla Sponge French Toast - While I was definitely craving something more savory than sweet, it's always hard to resist the more \"typical\" carby brunch items. Ordered this with a side of bacon to try and balance the scales a bit, to little avail. Their French toast, while light, fluffy, and tasty, was on the too-sweet side due to the butterscotch drizzle: and that's even WITH the bacon. Take out the butterscotch though, and it was pretty solid.\n\n* Parma-Flavored Eggs Benedict - This is what I wish I HAD ordered instead. Perfect poached eggs (the ones where the yolks are more gooey than runny), fantastic flavor, and just all around delicious. I actually tried a bite of this with my French toast, and it went surprisingly well together!\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - I can't speak to the inside of the venue, since we opted to sit outside, but outdoor seating wasn't the best option given that it's situated on a hill, so you'll be fighting against gravity, either upwards or downwards.\n\nBathroom - No comment, since I didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

I had a build your own scramble and it was quite good I would say worth the fifteen dollars. The decor of the place is not half bad and gives the place a nice feel. \n\nNow where it goes downhill is mostly the service. The staff here because of a slight english fluency problem come across quite rude which was easy for me to get over but during my meal the waitress wiping the table next to mine basically wiped all the food debris onto my lap without even batting an eye shortly after walking away. Then to top it off they tack on an automatic fifteen percent tip onto the bill. I am fine paying fifteen percent even for mediocre service but it seems they implement this automatic tip since they are not competent enough to earn a tip themselves. \n\nNot being from San Fransisco I am pretty sure it is illegal to require a tip without posting it clearly but being from out of town what the hell do I know.

Minus the long wait (to be expected for brunch in SF on a weekend), I was happy with my overall experience.\n\nThe food- We ordered BLT benedict, Frisco scramble, and lemon ricotta souffle pancakes. The benedict was absolutely amazing! I liked that they served both benedicts on a slice of baguette! It was very unique and I really liked it compared to the traditional english muffin base. The bacon was perfectly chewy and fatty! They also cut up the bacon into smaller pieces so you don't have to cut through it yourself! It makes the dining process a bit more elegant :P Loved the benedict overall, 10/10 would order again. \n\nWe also got the frisco scramble. Most importantly, it has apple sausage and avocado, so of course it was delicious! Both of these dishes came with a perfectly crispy hash brown that is just like the one they serve at griddle fresh! It compliments the dish really well and is just the right amount. \n\nLastly, we ordered the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes as well! Yes.. 3 dishes for 2 people :P It was definitely more than enough! The pancakes were good, but nothing special in my opinion. Maybe I'm just not that big of a pancake person? But they were fluffy (hence souffle!) and lightly lemon-y and was a nice sweet dish to have with our savory dishes. Try using the blackberry jam they provide on the table with the pancakes!

I couldn't help but eye every dish that was leaving the kitchen but I kept my word and decided on the Blueberry Walnut Souffle Pancake with a side of hash browns.\n\nIt was egg white heaven jam-packed in two rounds of fluffy goodness. They were thick and very light with blueberries sprinkled within inches of each other. I normally do not like butter on my pancakes but the butter was amazing for this dish. I wished that the walnuts were located inside the pancake too but they were on the side, and roasted with honey and sugar. There was a white sauce on the side that was sweet and a delicious addition to the pancake as well. I would rather have that than the maple syrup! The maple syrup in my opinion ruined it a bit. It was thick and a tad too sweet. It made my pancakes taste like sugar overload. The hash browns were as thin as paper. Not too oily and extremely crunchy.

I been excited to come here after seeing so many instagram pictures of this place (which lead me drooling on the yelp page.) First of all, I want to say, my expectations have not been met.

We ensured them that we were all 21+ . \"Yes you are 21 but you still can't (drink alcohol)\" Wait.. WHAT? Asked for the manager-- and the same thing happened. Either they can't do math or they just didn't realize that it was 2015 now. Very annoyed... how can you deny the birthday girl and her friends (of legal drinking age) alcohol?!  They were very rude when they found out their mistake and the service sucked throughout the whole meal...they probably figured that we had to pay gratuity anyways.  \n\n- we ordered the blueberry walnut souffle pancakes (to share between our party of 6) which is clearly shown on several photos that it comes with 3 stacks. We only had 2. I can't help but to feel that we were ripped off. \n\n- Both of my friends who ordered egg benedicts mentioned that their eggs were overcooked and not runny. In addition, the crab cake benedict was dry. \n\n- the hashbrowns were like ricecrackers. It was soo thin and overcooked that everything was fried. there was no \"potato meat.\" Likewise-- in comparison to the photos here on Yelp, everyone else had a more \"potato meat-er\" hashbrowns (sorry I just made up a word.) \n\n- the toast had an annoying overwhelming \"burnt\" taste to it. \n\nPros\n- corned beef was very good \n- the italiano scramble was delicious", "author": "Jenny N."}

A gal that worked there made sure those standing around had a few minutes to view the menu.\n\nAfter waiting for about 50 minutes I was pretty excited to hear the gal shout out \"JOANNE- PARTY OF TWO!!!'  Woo hoo, that was us!  We ended up dining outside on their patio, but there was sufficient heaters hanging on the awning that kept us warm.\n\nI had plenty of time to review other Yelp reviews and view pics of their dishes to see what I wanted and opted for the 6-hour cooked corned beef hash topped with poached eggs and accompanied with potatoes and two slices of sourdough toast.  My hubby had a heartier appetite and got the banana blueberry pancakes along with the shrimp cakes(?) and the mixed hash brown (both were ordered as side orders).  \n\nThe wait for our food didn't take too long, they definitely hustle with bringing your drink orders out and a big plus for having a water carafe at each table (I drink lots of water and probably drank the whole carafe full of it).\n\nOur food not only looked pretty, but our dishes were pretty awesome.  I loved the flavors and tenderness of the corned beef, it was cooked nicely and would certainly order it again if we find ourselves back at Mymy.  My husband loved all his dishes, so much that he cleaned his plates of it, lol.\n\nAfter brunch, we decided to cross the street and hop on a cable car back to our hotel as we giggled about the guy and girl sitting arm's distance away from us.  They were obviously on a date and listening to them get to know one another better was kind of awkward at times.  Hopefully it works out between the two of them, but we couldn't help but listen to their conversation and think that he just wasn't into her. Oh well, on to the next guy!\n\nIf you were like me on this particular Sunday and searched high and low on the Yelp app for a great Sunday brunch spot, look no more because Mymy will satisfy your sweet and savory cravings.  Just make sure your phone is fully charged or bring the paper to read since you might be waiting a while for a table.", "author": "Joanne B."}

There was a line outside as expected, you just have to wait in line cus there's no wait list. The wait was actually not that bad, we got seated in like 30 minutes for a party of 4.\n\nThe menu was quite similar to Griddle Fresh, with a couple tweaks. I always order the veggie scramble, and this one was subpar. I asked if I can have substitute my toast for English muffin, and they said they didn't have English muffins... what???\n\nI'd probably give this place another chance some day, but it's not even comparable to Griddle Fresh.", "author": "Carmen G."}

They do not have a wait list, instead customers stand in line outside of the restaurant. I didn't mind this at all because I was able to see how far I am from getting seated. I was the 4th or 5th party in line and got seated along with a bunch of others in line after 10 minutes of waiting. \n\nWhat I found strange is that the restaurant doesn't seat customers immediately. Their strategy is to seat everyone at once. Then clean tables that finish earlier and leave those tables vacant until enough tables are open to allow a new set of customers in. Very strange.. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered:\n* Lemon ricotta pancake - well, it didn't look as cute as I hoped with the designs I saw with the dishes from yelp photos. My pancake actually came out BURNT (as seen in photo). I thought maybe it was still edible so I won't have to be rude and send it back.. it was pretty bitter and I really didn't want to eat it if I was paying like $12 or so for pancakes. I sent it back (FIRST TIME EVER). Felt really bad but the servers were actually very nice about it.\n* Norwegian benedict - it was very good except the salmon was a bit too salty. Plus side is that they were very generous with the amount of salmon there were :) I don't like hash brown but their hash brown is so delicious and just enough crunch! \n\nThe tables were a bit close to one another and restaurant was quite small. Overall utensils were clean and customer service was excellent.", "author": "Sarah T."}

I signed my name on the clipboard (all the names prior were crossed off) and asked one lady who walked over to me.  She said if I wanted to sit outside then she could seat us right now.  I told her okay, but that my fiance will be here in just a second.  He finally came (because I made him check the wait at Olea too).  I told her that he was here and we could be seated.  And she told me to wait for a hostess.  So many of the waitresses saw me and another group waiting however they didn't check in with us til maybe 5 minutes later.  We were actually seated inside by the window.  Throughout the meal it doesn't seem we were checked on either but luckily they gave us a carafe of water to share.  \n\nIt was a hard decision, but I ordered the Parma Flavor Benedict and he got the Peasant Lorraine Flat Omelette.  The Parma benny had proscuitto, tomato, aspsaragus, mozzarella and chive hollandaise ontop of toast and served with crispy hashbrowns.  I like how they included asparagus in it and proscuitto always hits the spot.  But it was average at most.  There was nothing spectacular about it, and I felt that it was a little flat.  The hashbrowns were nice and crispy but had no seasoning whatsoever.  His omeltte was a lot more flavorful.  Liked how it was so fluffy too.  His omelette came with gruyere, swiss, bacon, leeks and grilled tomatoes.  Side of toast and crispy hashbrowns as well.  \n\nNot sure if I should have ordered something else, but the hype and the not so great customer service put a little damper on this brunch as well.  The food isn't bad, but it's average at best.  I've had a proscuitto benedict at Zazie's and I thought that was much better than here.  I saw someone mention that Mymy is under the same ownership as Griddle Fresh.  If so, then it's like night and day, because we love GF!  Their food is never bland.  I can say I've crossed Mymy off my list and it's conveniently across the street from my workout spot, but I wouldn't come back.", "author": "Cat C."}

After we finished our brunch, my friends & I asked if it was possible to split the check two ways. The waiter responded \"You should've asked to split the check before you ordered your meal.\"  Making it sound like we should've known that in the beginning.

Long story short: even if they have plenty of tables they may just not seat you.\n\n\nWe (party of 2) arrived, and the only table they would offer us was by the kitchen. There was a bulk delivery going on at that table so I suggested we sit somewhere else. There were three 4-seaters available and yet they made us wait for 15 minutes for someone reading his paper at a 2 person table to leave. He didn't, so I asked many times for us to be able to sit at one of the unoccupied tables -- (no line, no rush, weekday mind you) -- the waitress kept referring to the owner, who kept waving her away and saying no -- the busboy joined in on our behalf and a heated discussion ensued.

It's a medium size place and there were people already lining up the door before it even opened. It has to be good! I didn't want any typical omelettes, eggs Benedict, or corn beef hash. I wanted to try something new, that's when I saw Lemon Ricotta souffl\u00e9 pancakes. That definitely sounds interesting! It's no easy task to souffl\u00e9 something inside a pancake. I ordered that and I was not disappointed! It was light, airy, and doesn't have that dry pancake taste since the lemon ricotta was inside. I thoroughly enjoyed it, but could only manage to eat one pancake, and had to save the other one for another time. Great place and great food!

He decided to give Mymy a try after viewing some Yelp photos and reading reviews.  We arrived around 11am on Saturday and there were groups of people waiting for their names to be called.  We probably waited 30 minutes before we got seated, which isn't too bad.\n\nLooking at the photos, I had a couple of items I was debating over as the menu was very extensive.  Unfortunately, their weekend menu is limited with only a few options to choose from. \n\nWe ordered:\n\nVanilla Sponge French Toast - The name doesn't lie!  The French toast had the perfect level of sweetness, fluffy and soft like a sponge, and melted in my mouth.  The vanilla was very faint, but I'm glad as after finishing one of the french toast, it got to be a little too heavy.  It also came with slices of bananas, strawberry, and blueberry.  \n\nFrench Toast - I can't remember what the name of this one was, but I believed they used a baguette as it was crispy.  There were also corn flake like pieces sprinkled on top and a blueberry cream sauce along the side.  \"A\" liked his order more than my vanilla French toast as he thought it was too doughy.\n\nSide of Hash Brown and Bacon - I'm so glad \"A\" decided to order this as it balanced out our meal.  I normally don't care for hash browns, but this was incredible.  It was paper thin and crispy.  The bacon was mediocre.\n\nHot Chocolate - way too sweet!\n\nOverall, the food was okay.  Service was non-existent.  \"A\" ordered coffee and wasn't asked if he wanted a refill until we asked for the bill.  I wouldn't make a trip out to Mymy, but would give it another chance if I'm in the area.", "author": "Candice H."}

We then split the Harvest Scramble and the Banana Blueberry Souffle pancakes. THIS FOOD WAS INCREDIBLE. The harvest scramble has pesto, veggies, pine nuts, and is perfect for vegetarians (which i am not but this just looked way too good to pass up). The scramble came with sourdough (or wheat) toast and super thin hashbrowns, all of which were delicious. The banana blueberry souffle pankcake was heavenly as well.

Mymy was my favorite by far, and honestly one of the best breakfasts I have had anywhere.\n\nWe arrived around 9. There is a clipboard on the wall where you write your name and party size, and then you step out to the street to wait. Even though we only had two people ahead of us on the list, we ended up waiting 40 minutes. They kept calling all the parties of 2, and since we were a party of 3, I guess it was harder to find us a table. This place is super duper small, so definitely expect a wait. My friend said she has seen the line halfway around the block before.\n\nI am not usually one for waiting, but it was actually worth it!\n\nService - Great! Very nice employees who were cheerful and polite.\n\nAmbiance - Like I said, it's very small, but the table was a decent size and we didn't feel cramped once we were seated. The place is decorated with paintings of flowers and old men (??) and little tiny jewelry boxes. Random, but sort of charming. \n\nFood - I had the BLT Benedict. In lieu of an English Muffin, the poached eggs are on top of a piece of toast, covered in garlic spinach, diced tomatoes, bacon and a delicious hollandaise. And you are served hash browns. They appear to be a massive portion, and they are served as a large rectangle. Kind off odd. But they are super thin and very crisp, not greasy at all. It was like just eating the outside layer of a tater tot. So good.\n\nBF had the Chive Pancakes with Gorgonzola and Bacon Crumbles. I need to learn how to make this, ASAP! Delicious savory pancakes, with baked on gorgonzola cheese that is perfectly crisp, you know how awesome cheese gets right before it starts to burn...well, they have mastered that. The pancakes were served with honey to drizzle on and it was pure heaven. I think I liked his food more than mine, and I really liked my food.\n\nMy friend also had a version of Benedict, which she was very happy with. Total was $45 for three breakfasts and three drinks. Very reasonable. Loved this place, I hope when I visit my friend is SF again, we can come here for breakfast!", "author": "Randi B."}

There's a coffee place right around the corner from Mymy and you can grab something to drink while waiting :) \n\nAfter 20 minutes of waiting, my bf and I ended up sitting on the counter. To my surprise, the spot wasn't so tight that the person next to me is all up in my bubble. The menu has sandwiches, burger and benedicts. I ordered the florentine benedict and my bf got the Benedict with bacon and prosciutto. Let me say.... I've had lots of benedicts before and this one is so far THE best I've ever had. The egg was done in perfection that the yolk spills out as soon as you cut it in half. Other places I've tried where the benedicts were overcooked.

Have you had a bill with gratuity automatically added even though you are not in a large party? \n\nI've been there twice. When I went there for the first time, a few months ago, I was with my mom and a friend. We enjoyed our meal, but after I got the check with 15% (mandatory) gratuity, I got so confused. We asked them why. And one server said they ALWAYS put auto gratuity. My mom was visiting me from my country so my friend and I didn't want to argue with that, so we just paid and left. \n\nMy second visit here ended with same disappointment. This time, the server said they charge the auto gratuity because there are a lot of tourists. But even though I said I'm not a tourist, she seemed she didn't care about it. I understand the tipping culture doesn't exist in some counturies and some tourists don't really understand how it works or how much they should pay. But I think, in that case, I think the servers should let people know how it works and why, NOT JUST PUT AUTO GRATUITY WITHOUT A WORD.\n\nI don't think I am the only one who thinks this is wrong.

The rest is history, and now you can pretty much walk into Olea and eat within 5 minutes because everyone's in line for Mymy. Classic SF. \n\nJokes aside I'm honestly a huge fan of Mymy, there's something for everyone and everything there is delicious. It's really impossible to have a bad meal there.There are no reservations and there's always a line on the weekend but I've never waited more than 25 or 30 minutes even at peak hours (11-1 on Sat/Sun). \n\nI always have a hard time deciding between sweet and savory at brunch; I'm always drawn to the pancakes and french toast but end up deciding on an egg dish to avoid that \"I've eaten 700 calories but I'll be hungry in an hour because it was just flour and sugar\" feeling. ENTER SOUFFLE PANCAKES!! \n\nThese babies are really the ticket if you're a pancake lover but want a filling and protein filled meal that won't leave you feeling crappy. They are fluggy and egg white filled and pretty much divine. The lemon ricotta are top notch and just have the most delightful hint of citrus, not overpowering at all. \n\nThe Benedicts always tempt me and are really delicious, especially the Norwegian with smoked salmon. The hash dishes and scrambles are also good. If you're not a fan of flat crispy hash browns I would stay away from them here, and opt for crispy breakfast potatoes instead - the hash browns are a little too greasy and hard for my taste. \n\nThey churn out a crazy amount of food here and it's all delicious, definitely worth checking out!

We waited less than 10 minutes for a spot to open up, which I thought was super fast considering how small and popular this spot seemed. Although I wish we could have sat outside, it was nice to see the interior and people watch through the window. \n\nFood:\nBLT Benediction was probably one of the best bennys I have ever had. I love eggs benedicts, but the Hollandaise sauce was everything on this one! The eggs were perfect as well - not grossly undercooked and runny, yet not super well done that the yolk still dripped. I really like that the hashbrowns were shredded thin and crispy. \n\nLemon Ricotta Souffl\u00e9 pancakes = dessert for breakfast. So fluffy, creamy, delicious, and huge, we had to take a pancake home! The table jam really complemented the pancake when the syrup wasn't enough. The fruits were a nice garnish and really added to the dish.\n\nThe service was excellent despite a packed house. The server was super sweet and very attentive. We were really happy with the food and experience at Mymy's.", "author": "Hannah P."}

The dish came with two pancakes and two sunny side eggs. After I had initially ordered I was scared that I wouldn't like the gorgonzola cheese in the  pancake, but that was a false alarm. The pancake was made so nicely that I could taste some crispy cheese on some of the edges of my pancake. Mmmm. It also came with some honey glaze on the side to add a bit of sweetness to this otherwise savory pancake. This was definitely a nice change to the brunch items that I usually order.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Tex Mex Omelette/Scramble. It looked very good and tasted good as well but I probably wouldn't order it myself since the sauce they use in this dish is spicy (Reminds me of the Orange Sauce from La Vics hehe..)\n\nI will definitely be back to try the other things on the menu!", "author": "Michelle C."}

Savory or sweet, whichever you choose, the food here is good. \n\nTaste-\nBanana Blueberry Souffl\u00e9 Pancake: Ugh. The souffl\u00e9 part of the pancake makes it the fluffiest airiest most decadent pancake. First of all, when it comes out it just looks like something you'd want to dive into. Criss-cross drizzled in syrup with a ball of butter melting into a pool along the top, this two stack pancake plate was edible for the eyes. The syrup they give for the pancakes is light and thin so it really doesn't over power the actual flavor of the pancake. Once you cut into the middle, you'll find a swirl of light yummy egg whites. The candied walnuts on the side of the plate added a nice crunch to the fluffy pancakes. Everything meshes together so well on this plate! \n\nParma Flavor: Honestly one of my favorite eggs benedict. Upon putting the first bite in my mouth, I wanted to order another plate of it before I was even done. A perfectly poached egg covered in a chive hollandaise sauce sits atop an English muffin bed with prosciutto, tomato, and fresh melted mozzarella. The asparagus were perfectly seasoned, and I liked that it was kept to the side of the Benedict just so I didn't have more to cut through. The Benedict also has basil leaves and is sprinkled with grana padano (tastes like Parmesan cheese) which gives the Benedict as a whole a more fresh and deeper flavor. If anything, I would've liked a little more hollandaise sauce because it was a little drier than I was used to, but the flavor was there all the same. The side of hash browns that come along with it are extremely thin and crispy. There's not really any potato texture, just a crisp bite of hash brown. So if you're looking for something with a little more substance, I'd say substitute it for their country style potatoes because those looked pretty yummy too!! \n\nService-\nYou can tell they do quick turn over here. Everything is really fast paced. Quick to take your order, and they bring your food out to you fairly quickly as well. As soon as we finished our pitcher of water, they were quick to bring us a new one in a matter of seconds. We asked for an extra pancake syrup and they brought it out in a matter of seconds as well. The reason I give this place a 4 and not a 5 is because I didn't feel quite relaxed and leisurely as I enjoyed my brunch. As soon as I was done I felt rushed that I had to leave so that the next party could come and take my place. But I mean, the food was so delicious so who can complain. \n\nRestaurant Atmosphere-\nLike I said, they try to be fast here to get their waiting customers into the restaurant as quick as possible. Because of that it may come across to their customers to feel rushed but it's not so bad, just enjoy your food. Two of us came on a Sunday around 11:15am and they sat us within 10 minutes because surprisingly all the parties ahead of us were a party of 3+. \n\nHighly recommend this place to anyone looking for some yummy brunch!

Probably not.  And the only reason is I'm scarred by that wait time.  I'm not a native San Franciscan, heck I don't even live here, so maybe that wait time is normal.  But I just don't enjoy standing around wasting my time for an hour.  Even the possibility of that happening again will keep me away.  (Then again, I might come back again in a pair after trying tons of other brunch places.  I'm fickle like that).\n\nBut on to the good part.  The food was delicious.  My perfect brunch there would consist of the corned beef and a pancake.  Obviously, I picked at everyone's plate.  I got the souffl\u00e9 banana pancake.  The souffl\u00e9 part is because it is eggy in the middle.  They brought me out two huge pancakes.  Did I eat the whole thing?  Yes, but I wasn't even hungry for dinner.  I basically stuffed myself.  I also tried my sister's corned beef and it was amazing!  I had food envy while scarfing down my own food!  It was so tender.  I also tried my husband's fries and they were very good too.  \n\nThis is a small place so a wait time like that isn't out of the ordinary.

The sausage has lots of large chunks of sweet apple and they are also super generous with the avocado.  No 2-3 slices here...it looks like they use an entire avocado!  All omelettes are served with hash browns and a choice of toast, but for extra $ you can sub in fruit for the hash browns and also ask for egg whites.  My friend ordered an omelette too (forget which one) and asked for egg whites and also three extra egg whites.  They came through with his request though I'm not sure what they charged for that since my friend treated and snatched the bill before I could take a look.  But good to know they can do that.  I asked for a 1/2 OJ AND 1/2 GRAPEFRUIT JUICE and they did that too.\n\nWe didn't have coffee here though.  That called for a repeat trip to Contraband.", "author": "Carol L."}

We took whatever was available first, which we got out door seating. It was a bit weird because it was right next to the line where everyone just stares at you and the hot sun, but that wasn't a big deal. The service was fine even though there are some reviews about terrible service, so I came here not expecting much. I had the Tex Mex like most people recommended and the boyfriend had the baja. The baja was alright and the Tex Mex was good. The reason for my one star is because I'm positive that I just got food poisoning. I had the worst cramps and spent the longest time in the restroom, which is exactly what another review mentioned (the review is a lot older)...ironically with the same dish.

I loved the hashbrowns at griddle fresh so I was sooo happy that they had the same kind here!\n\nI ended up ordering the parma benedict, which was a poached egg atop of proscuitto, mozzarella, roma tomatoes, and basil, all covered with a chive hollandaise with a side of broccoli. I was happy to see that they have a couple different types of benedicts because those are probably my favorite type of breakfast food!!! I was actually deciding between that and the smoked salmon tartine because I absolutely loooved it at griddle fresh, but I figured I should have something different haha. The parma benedict was really good though, the mozzarella really balanced out the saltiness of the proscuitto and the egg was perfectly poached and runny! I personally hate when poached eggs are overdone because I love dat #yolkporn. I did wish there was more of the hollandaise though! The hashbrowns were delicious of course!!! I love how they're basically like chips because they're so crunchy. Also noteworthy--the lemon fill shrimp and crab cake Benedict!  \n\n\nThe service was good and my water cup was never empty.

Your entire party must be present to be seated.\n\nEggs dominate the menu, which I don't mind. Eggs = happiness. That's universal knowledge. But for you unbelievers out there, do not fret - there are pancakes, burgers and salads too.\n\nI got the Norwegian Benediction because I can't say no to salmon. It was a tad too salty and was getting cold, but I didn't bother sending it back. The hashbrowns were the game changer for me. Thin, crispy perfection.\n\nI also tried some of of my bf's Big Papa Burger, which was tasty. He fell completely in looove with the Vanilla Sponge French Toast. So much so that I got a tad jealous.

He rudely said \"well I'm going to seat other people first\". Yes I understand that many places have the same policy, but he did NOT have to be so rude about it! Homegirl just put her name down cause she was hungry! Luckily, he wasn't our server. \n\nThe place is pretty small.

Thankfully, my husband and I were not among the large crowd as we happened to dine at Mymy on a weekday afternoon. Still, we had to put our party of 2 on the waiting list posted against the wall. After scrolling through their menu and waiting about five minutes, we were seated to the left of the restaurant. We noticed the wait staff moving quickly yet still well aware of all patrons dining.\n\nThe restaurant is small, cozy, and intimate. The walls are painted with calm and inviting colors and decorated with cute, framed portraits.\n\nOur waitress set down water served in a glass carafe and two glasses (one of which still had lipstick on it). I quickly flagged down the waitress and she apologized and returned with two new glasses. We were ready to order and I was starving so I ordered coffee, a side of fries, and Lemon Ricotta Souffl\u00e9 Pancakes while my husband ordered their Norwegian Benedict. The fries arrived first, which I was hoping would happen, and they were fresh, hot, and crispy. Shortly after, our meals were served. The pancakes came with a side of fresh strawberries and blueberries, butter, and syrup. They were simply divine, fluffy, and moist; however, the taste of lemon was almost nonexistent. The Norwegian Benedict was presented on a bed of hash browns and toast.  All items in this dish were fresh, so delicious, and full of flavor. \n\nDuring the course of our meal however, our waitress did not check up on us. The only time she stopped by was to top off my coffee, which was a plus, but I hoped she would have taken more notice at that point. \n\nUltimately, Mymy is a real treat and I wouldn't mind dining here again.", "author": "Heather R."}

I was super happy to find myself in front of a sunny window. The menu is full of great food with a twist, everything is a little special. I am admittedly a pancake girl so I couldn't pass up the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes, that's right SOUFFLE pancakes! What?!\n\nWhen the pancakes arrived they were super fluffy, like regular fluffy pancakes on steroids. I dug in and quickly realized that they didn't really even need syrup. The lemon flavor was subtle, but I could definitely taste it. The middle of the pancakes had a fluffy egg white center, so cool! There was a small pile of macerated strawberries and blueberries that went perfectly with the pancakes, I only wish there was more. My only regret is not getting a side of crab and shrimp cakes, but I knew I would be too full to eat them (and I was). \n\nThis is an adorable and delicious little brunch spot in Knob Hill.

Which is a pro and a con! Def a place to have a good chit chat without being interrupted every 10 min :P\n\nWe ordered:\n-Lemon Ricotta Pancakes: OMG. how do they get the ricotta into the pancakes?! blows my mind..I thought it was be a pancake infused with lemon/ricotta flavoring..but nope! There is literally fluffy pockets or ricotta waiting to be devoured.\n\n\n-Chorizo Tartine + hashbrown: flavor explosion in my mouth. SO good. The hashbrowns were thin and so crispy, just the way I like them. The chorizo and the aioli melted in my mouth \n\nAwesome brunch + lunch spot.

Help indecisive people like me make indecisive reviews!\n\nI need to be fair: the 3.5 is JUST for the pancakes--I haven't tried anything else here. The place itself is cozy and cute and the waitstaff seem helpful (though somewhat harried)\n\nBut the pancakes were lackluster. First off, Pancake-Aficionados, these are SOUFFLE pancakes. Don't expect the usual thick, doughy, spongy kind. These are made in a way that involves carefully folding in whipped egg whites, which often makes pancakes that are lighter and fluffier than the usual kind. \n\nAt least, that's the idea. These, however, had a strange consistency. They were very thin on the edges, and not very flavorful or sweet. They also had zero lemon flavor, so I'm not entirely sure why they were labeled as such. The middle is where you get the ricotta souffle flavor, but it's very odd--it has a sort of foam-like consistency. It tastes very similar to meringue (like the top of lemon meringue pies). The cheese is very hard to taste, primarily because ricotta itself doesn't have a very strong flavor--that's why you need to add salt to it, for savory dishes, and sugar and, say, vanilla or lemon zest for sweeter dishes. \n\nSo: if you like flavorful, somewhat sweet, thick and fluffy pancakes these aren't for you. If you like meringue (and want it smack dab in the middle of your pancake) and prefer pancakes that aren't very sweet and have very subtle flavors, these are for you. If you do NOT like the taste of lemon or ricotta, these are also for you, since I never actually sampled a hint of either.\n\nListen, MyMy, I'll be back. Your other stuff on your menu sounded intriguing, and surely your pancakes please many customers. I just want to make sure that Pancake Obsessors like myself know what they're getting into here.", "author": "Ali M."}

On a Saturday afternoon, we waited for about an hour to get seated and it was a lovely place to sit outside. Parking here is obviously terrible, be prepared to pay meters!! I ordered the Parma Benedict that had prosciutto and mozzarella over toast with some hash browns. Some of the best hash browns I have ever had!!! It was the perfect amount of thin and crispy and would definitely recommend to anyone who comes here! Although the order looked rather small, I think it was the perfect amount of food for a girl like me! Definitely impressing and would come back! \n\nOnly thing I didn't like about this place was that after we had paid and sat for about ten minutes chatting, the waitress asked us to leave in order to accommodate for the guests waiting still since she said they were closing in 45 minutes. Reasonable but definitely not a customer pleaser. So I guess you can say you should be prepared to eat and leave quick or they'll kick you out!", "author": "Sharon L."}

We saw the reviews on Yelp, it looks cute inside, and the menu is creative and looks delicious. \n\nI love breakfast. I'm really not that hard to please for breakfast. It was honestly hard to choose what to get on their menu because it looks like it's all fresh & unique.\n\nI tried the Harvest Time Scramble, but debated for a long time between that and the Frisco. The Harvest Time Scramble was TERRIBLE. First, it was cold. Second, it had a long, twisted piece of plastic in it (like Saran Wrap or a processed cheese wrapper, which if it was the latter, I don't even want to think about it...processed cheese is the devil.) Third, it had no flavor. How can a scramble with a host of great vegetables, like eggplant, AND pesto have no flavor? I'm baffled as to how badly this dish was screwed up.\n\nThe rest of my party also hated the food. All I remember about theirs was some chicken and sauce breakfast combo (can't remember the name) that was also bland.\n\nThe only edible part on my plate was the fruit, which was $1.50 extra but seemed fresh & delicious. At least I paid $1.50 for something good. The hash browns, which come with the scrambles traditionally, were definitely a previously frozen, flat sheet of potatoes (my companion had them).\n\nBottom line, the menu looked so good and creative that I had high hopes, but my food wasn't even edible. They comped the scramble because of the plastic (again, gross) but I left hungry, and that's never a good thing.", "author": "Courtney R."}

I couldn't finish and had to take the wedges to go -- they crisped back up when I fried them in a pan later.\n\nOverall I think they are great.

A group of people waiting outside is a good sign that you found the place, as it gets crowded from all the people wanting to eat here.\n\nAs I'm looking over the menu, they have sweet n savory, eggs specials, burgers, sandwiches etc etc... What caught my eye was the banana blueberry souffl\u00e9 pancake! Just the name  of the dish rolling of my tongue was already making my mouth drool! I decided to order that. I added a house made sausage patty and hashbrowns as well to give me a salty flavor incase my pancakes were too sweet. \n\nWhen the souffl\u00e9 pancakes came out, it looked divine! Candied walnuts also accompanied the dish to give it texture as your eating it. Well first thing about the dish it surely was not too sweet, it was just right. My first bite into it was like eating a billowy soft fluffy cloud! It was ever so fluffy. Marscapone cream and fresh blueberries and banana lined the interior of the pancake. The walnuts gave it a nice crunch for a harmonious balance.

I was taking the healthy route today so I only got to mooch off a few bites, but it was delicious - not too oily and very crispy. As fellow benedict addicts we each ordered a different benediction:\n\nParma Flavor prosciutto, melted fresh mozzarella, roma tomato, basil, grilled asparagus, chive hollandaise, grana padano sprinkle\n\nNorwegian garlic sauteed spinach, smoked salmon, caper, chive hollandaise\n\nBaja California avocado, shrimp, roasted red peppers hollandaise\n\nAll three tasted fine but I guess I prefer food that incorporates unexpected ingredients rather than plain vanilla dishes.", "author": "Charlotte Z."}

I've tried the Banana-Blueberry Souffle Pancakes, The Norwegian Benedict, and the Baja California Benedict. Out of these, the only one I liked was the Norwegian; everything else, wasn't bad, but was disappointingly lacking in flavor. My garlic shrimp Baja meal barely tasted like anything. While the Souffle Pancake had a wonderful texture, I could taste only whispers of banana and blueberry. I'm not really down to pay $14 for food I wish tasted as described on the menu. Their coffee isn't very good either but they charge artisanal coffee prices for that too.\n\nThe service inside has been fast but very friendly. The people taking the names down are usually pretty mean. They also will overestimate the wait time, which is isn't bad per se, except  if you miss your name being called, they cross you off and you have to start over. We were told we had an hour wait, wandered away and came back in 40 minutes, and our name had already been called. When we tried to ask if we could be seated next, the lady brusquely told us, too bad, start over on the list, so we had to wait another 30 minutes.\n\nSo far, I've tried twice and that's probably it for me.

They're not just any shredded hashbrowns, but they looked like real good hashbrowns, so I was immediately sold and set on going to Mymy. Mymy is just right across the street from Olea. If I don't like Mymy, then heck, I'll just hop over to Olea! The line was long and I waited 30+ minutes before finally getting seated for a table of 2. There was no line at Olea so I figured I probably made the better choice to come here. :)\n\nI ordered fresh orange juice and eggs florentine with added avocado. The fresh orange juice was good, except half way through with it there was a piece of hair (not mine) buried in the drink... Kinda gross... I told them about it and they gave me a new one. I would have preferred them taking it off the ~$4 orange juice off my bill rather than getting a new one. After drinking OJ with hair in it, do I really want another one? =\\\n\nAs opposed to using English muffins, the Eggs Florentine was on sourdough bread. It tasted fine except the overall Egg Florentine fish was just okay. I love eating Eggs Florentine so I like to try them all! The hollandaise sauce and the overall dish was on the heavy and non-tasty side - to the point where I couldn't finish it and didn't even bother bringing home (and that rarely happens!). Ah wells. Though I'd have to say, this place makes some bomb ass hashbrowns. I love that they make it super golden and crispy.

The crab cake texture was a bit \"mushy\" for my taste - wasn't horrible, but I didn't feel it necessary to grab a second bite.   My Baja California benedict was very tasty - the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the sauce had great flavor.  \n\nI substituted the hash browns for french fries, and my husband stuck with the hash browns.

I'm not a big fan of the location of this place just because it's in such a busy area and next to California. the place is quite small and vintage looking. the atmosphere was welcoming. \n\nbefore coming here, I had my eye on the banana blueberry souffl\u00e9 pancakes... because souffl\u00e9 pancakes are TO DIE FOR. but, unfortunately I felt like getting an actual meal would've been more efficient. I ended up getting. the Baja California benediction. I was somewhat disappointed of the fact that one of my eggs were not runny, also I did not know it had onions. so, I spent a good minute picking them out. BUT, the shrimp was very flavorful and pretty big. normally when I go to brunch places, they use fake tiny packaged shrimp. but at mymy, they don't. so that was a plus! although the bread that the benedicts were placed on was not the easiest to cut into and I had a hard time. my boyfriend got the tex-mex without the jalape\u00f1os and a side order of bacon. he pretty much liked what he ordered and he actually ate my hashbrowns too. \n\nI would probably say that I'd come back again in the future, but to try their pancakes!", "author": "Audrey K."}

I walked back while others got coffee and we were already up! Thank goodness they gave us 5 minutes to have everyone here. Seriously that was the quickest wait for brunch..prolly 30 minutes. We came here just for the hash because we saw how flat and fried this thing was. I also got to try the salmon egg bread dish, chive pancake, and banana+blueberry souffle pancake. I really enjoyed the hash and that was my favorite. My pancake was fluffy but I prefer a regular pancake rather than souffle. I liked the salmon and egg and they could have done less of that creamy thing. The chive pancake was aite.

I've been here 4, 5 times now and this review is long overdue. \n\nI've only been on weekdays, so have never had to wait to be seated. I've tried two of their omelettes (one with asparagus/bacon/gruyere, and another with sausage), one of their eggs benedicts (one with shrimp), and their french toast. \n\nEvery time, their food never fails me. I think I liked the omelette with asparagus/gruyere/bacon the most, but the french toast is a very close second. I love their hasbrowns as well - perfectly seasoned, and pan-fried kind of a like a sheet until golden brown and crispy but not burnt. I've yet to try their pancakes, which means another visit is coming up soon! \n\nOtherwise, service is friendly and fast, and their food comes out quickly. It's friendly for solo-diners as well, since they've got a bar table area next to a good stack of up-to-date magazines (New Yorker, Time, some home magazines) that diners are free to read while eating. While I don't think they'd be happy if you pulled your laptop out and started working, they won't rush you out if you're finished with your meal but still browsing through a magazine and sipping coffee.

The service is impersonal and they don't speak well. I suppose my expectations were high given that this is a popular spot in a city with lots of exquisite dining options, but I'm not sure San Franciscans really know a good brunch when they see one! I prefer Peter D's, which does not use quality ingredients but at least their food tastes good, for example the eggs benedict consistently has a fuller and richer flavor. For whatever reason, restaurants like these can't beat small-town diners owned by provincial couples who settle you in as if it's your relative's home. There are a few similar brunch spots to Mymy's, and it definitely works but personally I'm not a fan of this SF brunch restaurant formula of servers with poor communication skills, somewhat attractive dishes, and mediocre quality.

I love it yet I am so lazy most weekends to deal with getting up early and waiting for an insanely long time.\n \nYes, this place still has a wait and is a tinier space than some other brunch places, but it is so worth it. Obviously if you're in a group of four or more the wait is gonna be a while (standard), but with two people you're seated relatively quickly. We waited about 15 minutes before being seated. They also took our orders and came out with them very quickly. \n\nBoth times I've been here I've ordered one of their benedicts. They are so delicious! I've tried their original which you can't go wrong with. It comes with a side of hash browns or you can substitute it with fresh fruit for $1.50. This time I decided to try the parma benedict which consists of prosciutto, mozzarella, asparagus, basil, and tomato. I was afraid it might be too salty, but that wasn't the case. It was so good! Definitely recommend trying this one if you're a fan of eggs benedict. \n\nWhat I also love about this place is that on top of the hash browns being a good side choice the fresh fruit is a LEGIT fruit side. It comes in a bowl filled with oranges, melon, strawberries, blueberries, grapes, blackberries, and bananas. See what I mean? I hate when you get a side of fruit and it's just a lackluster cup of melons and grapes. So being the type of person that likes to eat a little bit of everything I usually order the eggs benedict with the regular side of hash browns and then just get a bowl of fruit also. \n\nSo the food is amazing + service is friendly + orders come out fairly quickly + wait time isn't horrible even on weekends = 5 stars all around!", "author": "Jenny C."}

Take note - while Olea is closed, Mymy will tend to have an even longer wait. However, we got in at around 9am and were seated right away. Probably too early for the normal brunch crowd. Eh. If you have a large party, expect to wait no less than 30 minutes, because the place is tiny. The waitresses are very efficient and excellent - I love this place because it is absolutely *not* a sit-down-and-talk-for-hours place, meaning you will be able to get in, get out, and have the next party seated with no problem. They know what's up.\n\nEvery time I come here, I think, \"Okay, so can I get away with ordering two entrees?\" And the thing is, I can, but it would be the worst idea in the world, because one platter is absolutely enough to make you full, happy, and not overly regretful. We brought our friends over for this one - one of them had been before, and the other did not know what joy and beauty to expect.\n\nThe thing is, my go-to here is the 6hr corned beef hash. Bless this plate. I get that bad boy with hashbrowns, sourdough toast, and my eggs scrambled, because I am allergic to uncooked egg yolk minus the lemon dill sauce (which sadly invalidates their whole gorgeous \"benediction\" menu for me). I unfortunately found out the thing that made me sick was the lemon dill sauce, because the reason it's so creamy and delicious and wonderful is because it's a mayo-based product. Damn you, allergies, keeping me away from delicious food! As usual, it was delicious. No other corned beef hash compares to theirs, and their normal hashbrowns are just perfect. Crispy all around and the corned beef isn't overly salted like most others. I don't usually like my corned beef in actual beef-and-not-ground form, but if it's done right, none of that matters. None of it. Because I'm too lost in happy corned beef goodness.\n\nIt's also a plus that this is the one restaurant that doesn't accidentally think and assume that my boyfriend ordered the corned beef hash. He always gets the sweet stuff, like French toast, and inevitably a waitress will think I'm too ~feminine~ to have corned beef. Or something. I don't know. But Mymy doesn't do that, bless them.\n\nOur friends ordered a standard egg plate and the lemon ricotta pancakes. Once I cleared my plate of heavenly corned beef, I was able to say, \"All right, y'all. Who needs help?\" which netted me some ridiculously tasty lemon ricotta pancakes. The thing about having perfect corned beef hash is that I am hesitant to order anything else on the menu. But, having morsels of everyone else's dish with permission, I can definitely say that everything is straight up tasty and well worth your time.\n\nMymy, I will come back to you when I feel like I can wake up early enough again. Folks eating there - do everyone else a favor and don't dawdle after your bill is paid. Give someone else their shining beacon of brunch perfection. Contraband Coffee is just around the corner, which is a good place to stop - or you can meander through You Say Tomato, the little store that sells UK imported foods like UK Milky Ways, Ribena, and other delicious things.", "author": "Robbin A."}

A quick yelp search lead us here.\n\nWait: well they run a tight ship here. You right your name down on a wait list. There are rules and instructions posted to the left. 1 write your name down and whether or not your entire party is present. If your name is called and you aren't there, you are skipped and the list starts again from the beginning. Cold world. This does happen so don't go far. She yells your name twice and moves on. Interesting thing after asking a multiple of times, the hostess/ servers will not give you an approximation of the wait time. They answered identically. This may be a good business trick or very frustrating. Either way arriving around 10am on a Sunday, I'd estimate a 45 minute wait. It did move relatively fast as there were many parties of 2. Our food took forever to come. One patron told us to hang in there and couldn't believe we hadn't ate yet, clearly we sat down at the same time and he and his guest finished  and paid their bill. It took 30 minutes to get our food!! Not cool. \n\nFood: nothing to rave about in my opinion maybe it's what we ordered. Vanilla sponge  French toast was ok and nothing special. My lemon ricotta souffl\u00e9 pancakes didn't really have a hint of lemon. It's more like a meringue inside a pancake. I definitely tasted the egg whites. It did create a very light pancake but it wasn't that good. Unimpressed. The crab cake was very good how wee. I wished I had more  and it was larger. Is try the crab Benedict next time.

The indoors felt a bit stuffy the few times I went in for the restroom, given that it's a semi-open kitchen and it's firing at all times.\n\nThe waiters and waitresses were super friendly. \n\nWhen it came time to eat, I had the BLT Benediction (GREAT!) and the Blueberry Pancakes (FANTASTIC!). The Blueberry Pancakes are a MUST (and I'm fairly picky about my pancakes). They were fluffy, moist, and the right amount of sweet. My mouth is watering just writing about them. If you're going with friends, order them for the table!", "author": "Kelly Y."}

So when I decided to finish it today,  I realized I don't remember anything about the restaurant. I just had a single word in my draft review -  \"Meh\". And after I went back to the page for the restaurant to refresh my memory,  that was again the only word that came to me about my experience here. Not sure why absolutely everything in SF is rated 4 stars. This place is as meh as anything can be. The breakfast here is nothing great,  just a standard American breakfast that you can get if you point your car literally anywhere,  Drive for a hundred miles and pull into the closest breakfast joint,  only this place comes with cool labels like \"organic\" and \"locally sourced\" and of course,  great San Francisco prices! So,  to conclude, don't go here unless you're craving an average comfort breakfast.", "author": "Vineet K."}

We decided to try the blueberry souffl\u00e9, lemon souffl\u00e9, hash browns, eggs, and French toast. First off I can easily say these were the best hash brown I've ever had, that's pretty hard to accomplish because I honestly don't like Hash Browns. They were light and crispy and I can say they made me love hash browns, their hash browns. My daughter got the blueberry souffl\u00e9, which I thought was stupid because she hates blueberries with a passion. She ended up absolutely loving them, she didn't even need syrup. I tried them and they were absolutely flawless, they were amazing to say the least. \n\nThe eggs were the best I ever had; they were exceptionally light and fluffy. The lemon souffl\u00e9 was OK, my daughter got it the second day, and it really had no flavor at all. Just a hint of lemon, which wasn't all that great. You needed their syrup and to be honest their syrup is gross.  The French toast was great to say the least, it was made out of sponge cake which mad it extremely special. It had a light butterscotch drizzle, giving it enough of a sweetness to satisfy anyone's taste buds. It almost beat the Blueberry Souffl\u00e9 pancakes, almost.\n\nThe reason I gave 4 stars is because of service. The service was awful, they were rude, and never came back to see if we needed anything. Customer Service is important in any business, and MyMy fails at that aspect.", "author": "Ann U."}

This was, by far, my favorite plate.\n\n- Chive Potato Pancake with Bacon & Gorgonzola ($12.50): I was relatively disappointed with these savory pancakes.

Throughout our entire meal, the service was excellent - very friendly and nice staff! I ordered the zucchini pancakes with scrambled eggs and a coffee. I've never had nor heard of zucchini pancakes and absolutely loved them. A little bit of maple syrup was added to the top of the pancakes, giving them a nice sweet touch.

Yes, I'm talking about a hashbrown plate. It just makes perfect sense. Instead of serving you a heaping mound of raw shreds of potatoes, they, instead, spread the hash across a really thin layer and brown them into a perfect plate-sized portion of epic-crispiness and crunch.\n\nI literally want to go back right now just thinking about it.\n\nMaybe the omlette on top wasn't overwhelming, but I simply can't think of anything else but the  cracker-like texture of the most amazing hashbrown I've ever had.\n\nSeriously though, it's a fun little place. Pretty good food. But, like any place in the city with over a 2.5-star review, it's packed and it's small.\n\nIf you can bear it, I strongly recommend you try this quaint little breakfast place out.

At 1pm, it was a 10-minute wait for 3 of us to be seated. Amazing.\n\nThe food is solid; we ordered the salmon tartine, corned beef hash, and a stack of the lemon ricotta pancakes. The tartine was easily the star of the show, but the pancakes were a close second. I just wish there was more lemon flavor! But that tartine... I'd go back just for that. The potato wedges were also really, really good.\n\nThe one downside: we ended up ordering a plate of chive pancakes after finishing all the food because the portions were small and we were still hungry after wolfing it all down. I don't know if it was a fluke or if this is a consistent \"problem\" here or if maybe my friends and I were extra-hungry that morning.\n\nI also enjoyed the proximity to Contraband Coffee next door, where we picked up some fancy espresso and sat outdoors for a while after eating at Mymy.", "author": "Sharon L."}

So many places in The City to get breakfast it's too overwhelming to make a decision.  \n\nNo reservations.  First come first serve.  Tiny place so don't be surprised ifya haveta wait outside on the corner.  But.....\n\nI will say in their defense that it's totally worth't!\n\nTiny wooden indoor seating that's nice an neat.  Glass water carafe w glasses on the table for you to server yourself that are replaced w a new one when it's emptied.  \n\nSF gals love the oversized framed spectacles.  Cute I might add.  \n\nVery casual and welcoming.  The server gals don't bother you too much.  In fact, coming from my line of food serving, it was a shock as I always engage my tables when it's warranted.  But the only interaction we received from our gal was jus takin our order.  No tour guiding after I told her it was our first time there or suggestions.  \nProlly college gals jus tryinta get by.  But I tipped them decently.  \n\nWe ordered the Santa Fe chorizo and eggs(modified egg whites only) with steak fries which didn't look as amazing as the guest next to us's plate of the delish lookin TexMex egg platter.  Nonetheless, we were a lil un-wowed by the presentation, but the flavor of the chorizo was marvelous.  \n\nI ordered my kid a basic cheddar burger which was awesome and delicious. I know cuz I took a bite of't.  \n\nWe also ordered the butterscotch Texas sized French toast w berries and bananas.  Amazing!  \n\nI ended up ordering crab cakes cuz I saw the couple next to us eatin crab cake Benedict.  But I didn't make myself clear and got a side instead of the whole breakfast entr\u00e9e.  Oh well, all were scrumptious.  \n\nFresh squeezed ruby red grape fruit and oj.  \n\nMimosas ifya like, but no tap beers.  Drake's is served by the bottle in Amber, Hefeweizen, IPA, and another brew.  Not a fan of Drake's Hefe, it's like a Pilsner, too light to be a Hefe.  \n\nNext time we go, we'll get the TexMex and the crab Benedict for sure!  \n\nParkin's a bitch, but free on Sundays.  Understand that this is Nob Hill and so....\nwhen driving, expect HILLS!!!!  STEEP HILLS!  So if your driver's not experienced then you better drive.

I always look around to observe how people react to their food.  Not a single dissatisfied expression.  All who walked out were full and satisfied.  \n\n$60 for 2 freshly squeezed ruby red grapefruit juices, a bottle of beer, coffee, 3 entrees and a crab cake side for mom, dad, son, and nephew of 9 and 10.\n\nIn SF, it's a lottery w food.  some are bad, ok, and some excellent.

It is uncrowded on most weekdays but if you're looking for brunch without a long wait on Sat/Sun, the Tenderloin neighborhood has many options to choose from. \n\nThe food at MyMy is prepared carefully and thoughtfully. The eggs are fluffy never overlooked, you really can't make a wrong choice in omelettes or benedicts. The cook emulates French-style egg making very well. \n\nSpecial hash browns: outstanding. While many brunch places make some kinda hash brown-cheese-bacon-veg plate what you typically get is a plate of mush that's a gut-bomb. MyMy hash browns stay crispy and the saut\u00e9ed veg and bacon aren't overly greasy. This is under sides on the menu. \n\nThe chipotle chicken sandwich with smoked mozzarella is  very tasty, so is the classic club, because they use really good bacon and fresh avocado. The smoked pulled pork sandwich you can pass up, it's not spicy or particularly good. \n\nFor a lighter meal you need to try their Asian chicken salad, it's perfect. Grilled asparagus! Near perfect balance of sweet and savory. I could eat it every day - and I probably should. \n\nSorry, nothing to write about the souffl\u00e9 pancakes or spongy/gooey French Toast I haven't tried them. \n\nService is friendly and attentive, again, don't apply this to weekends that goes for most good brunch places in SF.", "author": "Ben S."}

My boyfriend has recently given up coffee but likes an occasional sip. The waitress denied me a third cup of coffee because she saw my boyfriend \"sharing my coffee\". She then told me it wasn't her rule, but the owners. I'm not sure where the owner was watching from, but if he was actually watching he would have seen my BF take two sips of the coffee and me drink the rest. Maybe it was for the best I was cut off from excessive coffee drinking because I'm now angry and caffeinated and writing this yelp review. I've come here many times in the past and the food is great but the way the situation was handled was incredibly unprofessional.

Thankyou fellow Yelpers for pointing me in the right direction! \nAfter my flight into San Fran, I just wanted something to start my day off right, before tackling Union Square for some Christmas shopping. MyMy was the BEST thing my boyfriend and I experienced all day! Cute little spot, off the corner in a light blue building. We almost walked past it. When we went inside we were just about the only ones there and were told to take a seat wherever we liked.\n\nBottomless Mimosas - $12-$14? I think. Completely well worth it! Those girls knew how to make mimosas! \nClay went for the french toast (never adventuring outside his french toast box) and it was like a beautiful work of art. It was crusted and topped with some kind of cereal. And on the sides there was some kind of butter or yogurt with a jam that was just all artsy and beautiful. I would have taken a picture but Clay would have made fun of me. And it tasted like a million bucks!\nI went with chicken sausage scramble, topped with avocado and hash-browns. Mine too, was like a delicious work of art. The avocado was sliced so delicately and set on top. And they are super generous with the avocado! (BONUS FOR US AVOCADO LOVERS) I'm pretty sure it was like a whole avocado! The hash-browns were a plenty, crispy and to die for!\n\nOur server was a cute, thin, girl with glasses and two toned hair. She was super attentive to my every need, even when they started to get busy. Plus, even after we paid she asked to make sure I didn't want one last mimosa before leaving. Want-of course!

My friend got the chive pancake, which she was extremely excited for, but was equally as disappointed by once she tried it. \n\nI had a taste & I could understand why. It was extremely dense and flour-y (think gnocchi consistency, rather than a fluffy pancake).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-01-05", "description": "I was confused when my cousin picked this place - I initially thought it was a coffee shop, not a brunch place. I thought she was suggesting we get a bagel or muffin, and I wasn't about to trek 30 min out of my way to come here.\n\nI may have made the mistake of coming here at 1:30 pm on New Year's Day. Everyone was probably nursing a hangover and eating late, but it took an hour to get a table for 3. This place is tiny, so if you have a party greater than 4, you're probably going to be waiting a while for a table. On the flip side, because they can't rearrange any of the tables inside, if you have only 2 people, you should get a seat much faster. We were standing outside forever while they had 4 or 5 open tables for 2. Poor space / table management in my opinion.\n\nI got the Chorizo Tartine, which was $11.50. I thought it was okay. I love spicy food, but I could have made this at home. It was scrambled eggs on a thin, slightly burnt brioche toast, a salsa, and roasted jalape\u00f1os (these are very spicy, beware). The hashbrowns that came with it were the saving grace, they were thin, and crisped to perfect. Almost every dish you get will come with hashbrowns, which is a plus.\n\nWe wanted something sweet, so my cousins and I split an order of the french toast. This goes on the list as one of the best french toasts I've had at a restaurant (love Zazie's and Sweet Maple's french toasts) The brioche bread was thick and fluffy, it was dipped in an orange vanilla batter that had perfect notes of citrus, spice, and sweet, and the fruit and butter that it came with was plentiful. This was the highlight of the meal.\n\nI probably wouldn't make the trek out here for brunch unless I found myself in the area, or came with people who lived around here. There are a lot better places in the Mission. However, if you're close to this place, come with a small group, and like hashbrowns and french toast, then you'll like this place. My total meal was about $20 including tax and tip (I got an entree and split the french toast 3 ways)", "author": "Christina L."}

All I can say is WOW!!! The flavors with amazing. The dill Hollandaise sauce was so flavorful and really added to the acid of the tomato and the flavor of the prosciutto. The hash browns were exactly like I like them. A thin layer with a crispy outside on one side. Next was the pancakes. Very different, but SO good. They seem to fold whipped up egg whites to a pancake batter and cook it up. They are surprisingly light! Last was the Peasant Lorraine Flat Omelette.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-09-27", "description": "As I mentioned in my previous review, MyMy has great food. I especially love their Tex Mex Scramble. When my cousin came in to town to meet me for brunch I jumped at the chance to take him to my favorite breakfast. \n\nWe received decent service. We were helped by pretty much every server who works there. One person brought food, another refilled waters and yet another brought us our bill. \n\nWhen it came time to pay I put down my card, the total was around $21, and my cousin put down a $5 bill. The $5 was laid on top of the card and the paper receipts. When my card was returned and I signed for it, I wrote cash on the tip space, because the $5 tip was gone. \n\nAs we gathered our things the male waiter that works there approached me and said \"you wrote cash tip on the tip space but there's no cash\". I said \"no my cousin put down a $5 bill on the tray and it was taken away when you ran my card\". He began to argue with me in the middle of the restaurant telling me there was no cash. I reiterated my side of the story and felt humiliated as people started to turn around and stare. I work in the service industry and rely heavily on tips I receive from my clients. I tip generously when it's appropriate, but I also understand that tipping is not a requirement it is a privilege. I reached into my bag and pulled out $10 and handed it to him, I felt like I was going to cry. I left the restaurant.\n\nAs I was walking home ( I live nearby) I decided to go back. I was outraged I had been treated like this. My fiance and I go to MyMy at least twice a week. And I couldn't believe how abusive this waiter was to me about a $5 gratuity. I walked in asked to speak to him. I explained again that I was not lying, that I too work in service and would never stiff someone on their tip. I asked him to help me get to the bottom of where the cash had disappeared to. Did it fall down, get stuck in the drawer by accident, did another server pick it up? He was rude and snarky to me. I told him that my fiance and I frequent the restaurant and always tip to which he responded \"you tip, not very much though\". At that point I was outraged. I couldn't believe his behavior and I walked out.\n\nLater that night I told my fiance what had happened. He couldn't believe it either. He knows that I always treat servers respectfully, I never even send something back if it's wrong! The next day he went down to MyMy to speak to a manager. When he asked for one, apparently no one runs the place. He spoke with two of the female servers who had also served me the day before. He asked them what they would do to remedy the situation, as we are twice weekly patrons of their restaurant. They offered no remedy or apologies. \n\nWe stopped going there. They way they treated me is unacceptable. If you don't get a tip, suck it up and give better service next time. If your tip disappears between my table and the cash register, its probably your fault or one of your coworkers has sticky fingers. As a customer I should have never even known about the missing money. \n\nBTW...4 months later my fiance and I were craving the tex mex scramble and we decided to let bygones be bygones. We ordered, ate, went home and both of us had horrible cramps and diarrhea. So yeah....that's my sad story.", "author": "Amanda S."}

The waitress was not very accommodating and almost rude when I explained I could not eat wheat ie. toast and could I keep the potatoes and switch out toast for fruit. I was willing to pay the extra for the fruit. She was adamant that the potatoes came with the toast and it was either fruit only or the potatoes with toast. How hard would it have been for her to ask the chef to skip the toast and give me the fruit since I had a food allergy? Also, I ordered the Frisco scramble (Chicken apple sausage, leeks, shallot, Roma tomato, avocado and cheddar) and was given a mushy mound of scrambled egg. Not only did it look inedible, it was inedible. The sausage tasted bland and the mushy mess turned my stomach. So I ate 3 bites, stopped and ate fruit for breakfast. My husband had a bit better luck with the Harvest time scramble (Eggplant, Roma tomato, fennel, Kalamata olive pesto, grilled asparagus, pine nuts and grana padano sprinkle) so I ate some of his. We also ordered a side of bacon which was not bad. The best part of the breakfast was my cappuccino - good foam, nice sprinkle of cinnamon on top, tasted great. Atmosphere was so so.

My my, where to eat though?\" Searched \"brunch\" on Yelp and the usual list comes up - Olea, Zazie, Mama's, etc. - what catches my eye is Mymy because I've never seen it on my list before! Started looking at the pictures and it got my belly growling and excited. When my bf steps back into the room, I leap out of bed and say \"Lets eat brunch!!! This place looks delicious!!\"  He looked at me funny and said sure, cause I never get out of bed and I was super happy. That's when you know something is probably good! Haha. Honestly, this picture (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mymy-san-francisco-3?select=IKcqwgu0YSmYDZPfa7_Nyg#IKcqwgu0YSmYDZPfa7_Nyg) got to me but when I got there, it wasn't on the menu -sad face- \n\nThis place has competition cause Olea's is right across the street! When we got there, I had a second thought of going to Olea's cause I couldn't stop thinking about their fluffy french toast; but I fought and held back my urge, so I put my name on the list and waited. Those who thought the wait was long decided to get in line at Olea's. Some that were smart but lazy to wait decided to put their name on the list then run to Olea's across the street and line up in hopes of getting in one faster (cause the hostess would yell out the name at the corner of the block). We came around Sunday noon. The wait wasn't too long for us (party of two), probably 30-45 mins. When I had put my name down, 8 parties were ahead of me. 4 were gone, so we basically skipped ahead. Parking in the area wasn't too bad, I think there are plenty of meter parking open. If you're cheap, you can circle around the neighborhood (1-2 blocks) and if you're lucky, you can find residential parking! \n\nWhen the hostess called out for my bf and I, she told us we would be seated outside. We sat on the side of the restaurant where the slope is. Not a really good idea since we're on a slope.. My boyfriend sat on the 'top' whereas I sat on the 'bottom'. When my bf poured me a glass of water, the glass' started to slip downhill and we had to stop it from slipping, using the the little tray of condiments. This was a big problem throughout our brunch (for drinks); what I had to do was put my glass of orange juice on my bf's side of the table. They did kind of warn us after we had sat down though (meh). Other downsides of sitting where we sat was this old man behind me who kept pushing his chair against mine (how annoying, I felt like he just ignored the thought of me sitting there. I had to ask my bf to move the table a little higher up the slope so I can give him 'moving space'. My bf noticed that he moved around A LOT.) There was also the groups of people waiting outside who talked loudly - there were two girls who stood next to our table speaking loudly to each other; and the car next to our table, who's alarm started going off when no one even touched it. Oh, and lets not forget the busy street filled with cars, taxis, and cable cars. \nI don't think I would recommend sitting outside (especially if you're on the slope). \n\nNow lets talk about the food! The menu offers a variety of brunch - salads, omelettes, benedicts, entrees, pancakes, french toast, etc. There's a smaller menu that they give per table and it has the drinks listed on there - beer, wine, mimosa, OJ, etc. \n\nSince they didn't have what I wanted, I opted for the Banana-Blueberry Souffle Pancake (~$13). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mymy-san-francisco-3?select=IKcqwgu0YSmYDZPfa7_Nyg#XIVNTp5mXKbiTaS_6SM7cw\nThe pancakes come in a stack of four. Drizzle your syrup, spread your butter, slice your pancakes, and dip it into the design-looking-sauce on the side! It makes it 5x better! The pancakes were easy to cut and filled with blueberries inside (sliced it one by one on top of the other pancakes cause I wanted it to get an even amount of butter & syrup on it). Overall, it was okay. I feel like I should've opted for my go-to brunch food - french toast. If there's one thing I learned from this meal, I don't think I should eat souffles again. I'm not sure if it's the way the pancake was made or it's just souffles in general, but because it's so \"soft\" inside due to the egg whites, it felt under-cooked to me and I ended up with an aching stomach a few hours later. \n\nCrab Cake Benedict http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mymy-san-francisco-3?select=IKcqwgu0YSmYDZPfa7_Nyg#Qa-t6UpdrJRZEkZgTWrHcw\nMy bf ordered this dish and he loved it! The crab cakes have shrimp inside and it was delicious! Everything about it is just delicious. I had a bite and I fell in love. I wish I had ordered this! Next time, I'll definitely order it. It came with a side of hash browns and a slice of orange (as pictured). My bf said that this was probably one of the best hash browns he's had because it's not \"mushy\" like other places. I admit it was good. Highly recommend this dish.", "author": "Mandy G."}

I hadn't been here in about a year and was disappointed in how the menu took such a downward turn.\n\nFirst, no \"standard\" buttermilk pancakes.  Two specialty pancakes available which had a bunch of stuff on them that I don't need.  That's fine to have them, but at least keep the most classic breakfast food on the menu - the buttermilk pancake.  I specifically asked for them and the server said they couldn't make them.  Lame.\n\nSecond, most of the delicious omelets that I used to love are no longer on the menu (e.g., Haas Omelet).  I had their chicken sausage omelet, which was mediocre at best.  Not great quality sausage, for sure.  Hashbrowns are just smashed on the plate.  \n\nSo I won't be back.

For those who don't have a few hours to spare for brunch and have time to go during the week, I highly recommend a late lunch M-Th to where you can get in and out fairly easily. The hubby and I did a savory-sweet combo where he ordered a yummy BLT eggs benny and I got the french toast with a side of hash browns. Oh the hash browns! I have never had paper thin hash browns like that - ever! So delicious, I could eat a couple plates worth and be happy. Seriously though, this is a place where you can order anything off the menu and be happy with it - a sign of a good brunch spot!", "author": "Lisa G."}

My friend raved about how light it was. \nPulled pork scramble:\nAlso very fluffy, nice chunks of pulled pork, tasty salsa verde. Opted for a side of asparagus instead of bread and potato. The asparagus is wonderfully charred. \nPeasant Lorraine omelet:\nLots of asparagus and delicious bacon. Hashbrowns are very thin and very crispy. Nothing left us with that heavy feeling. \nCoffee was average. \nThree entrees and two coffees costs us about $44.\nWe happily plan on returning.", "author": "Heather F."}

This place I've visited several times but never wrote a review. It's cute and charming, and the service I've had has always been attentive. But the food is very average. It's in line with IHOP, Denny's and Mel's Diner. The portions aren't small, average quality food, and decent presentation. I honestly am confused with the 5 stars reviews. This is SF, and you can get much higher quality food at this price. But I've come for the convenience, but after the recent meal of an egg scramble, I'm rethinking. The dish was not good, a big mound of gloppy eggs, portions of it were soft and watery and others very dry. Just big mush with ingredients in there that I couldn't even clearly see. The hash brown was very thin and had a strange bitter taste. I don't know if the potatoes are old or there was some cleaning agent in the frying pan that didn't get washed off.", "author": "M H."}

This place is always packed on the weekends, I'm talking line out the door, hour long wait packed. I finally got a day off where I could experience this place on an off day. I had the corn beef hash and the blueberry pancakes. Definitely an overload of food, but I felt the need to try more than one item seeing I probably won't have time to revisit anytime soon. The corn beef hash was delicious, but I wasn't expecting the eggs to come in a benedict style. That being said the corn beef was absolutely to die for and the fries were crispy and amazing. However, because of the benedict style eggs, the eggs proved a little too rich for my palette. I will probably specialize my order next time for sunny side eggs. The blueberry pancakes were really good and are made with a souffl\u00e9 technique. These seemed a bit heavy for me, when I think of the concept of a souffl\u00e9, I think light and airy. \n\nAll in all great flavor, coffee was surprisingly good but service needs a bit of help being quicker and more in sync with the kitchen (our plates came out 10 minutes apart from each other). I enjoyed this place and will add it to my recommended brunch spots.", "author": "Alex L."}

I traced back through everything I had eaten in the past 48 hours and (since I had been travelling with my friend the whole time) the only unique thing I had eaten that my friend hadn't was the cream I poured in my coffee at Mymy.

Attentive staff.\n\nI came here for breakfast after finding that Nob Hill Grille is no longer open for breakfast during the week.  =(  \n\nI wanted something different, and was tempted to go with the jalapeno and chorizo omelette, but then the Brunch Burger caught my eye.  It was described as a meatloaf patty topped with one sunny side up egg, onion, lettuce, tomato, and brown sauce on a plain or dutch crunch roll, served with fresh fruit or organic mixed salad.  ($9.25) I went dutch crunch and salad.  I also ordered coffee.\n\nAs I waited for my meal, my coffee was topped off constantly. I don't think I ever got lower than half empty.  When my meal did arrive though, I wished I had went with my first instinct and gotten the omelette.  It looked good enough, but it was not at all what I expected.  It was basically a regular hamburger on dutch crunch with an egg.  Although technically a hamburger patty is a meat loaf, it wasn't what made me order the dish.  The brown sauce is what made it taste like meatloaf, it was kinda like a meatloaf gravy sauce.  Boo.\n\nI still ate it and enjoyed it, but if I knew I wouldn't have gotten it.  The salad was fresh, but probably came from one of those plastic organic boxes you get from costco.  \n\nOverall, breakfast was okay.  My bill with tip was bout $15.  Not bad.

The hollandaise sauce was good, the ham was very thick, the engish muffin could have been toasted a little longer, one of my eggs was cooked perfectly while the other one was a little overdone.  How is that possible?!?  The hashbrown is crispy though out.  If you like your hashbrown with no substance in the middle then this is it.\n\nCan possibly get another star if the service was better.  I would come back to try some other items.  Their omelets look very good.\n\nWill be back!!!!", "author": "jason g."}

This is just the way brunch happens in SF--you go to bed the night before with all the best intentions, wake up past 8:30am, and then walk over to your neighborhood brunch spot only to find a long, cruel line. How are so many other people also up already? How did they find your brunch spot? Who are these people?\n\nLuckily, you'll have plenty of time to ponder these questions as you patiently wait for a spot to open. Don't worry, it's worth the wait. I'm giving this place three stars because there's no dazzle and the service is usually a bit curt. However, don't let my three stars rating fool you--the portion sizes are pretty generous and the food is consistently adequate (I mean that in the best way possible).

Alex A., Neal L., and I originally planned to go to Olea across the street, but we were pressed for time and the wait at Olea seemed to be too long. So we just hopped on over to Mymy Coffee Shop, and I had faith it'd be good because of the favorable reviews on Yelp. There was a much shorter wait though - we were the next ones on the wait list when we put our names down. It'd be helpful if you have a party of two because they have many two-seater tables. We waited about 20 minutes for a table to seat the three of us, which isn't too bad.\n\nI got the Frisco Omelette, Alex got the grilled cheese with jalapenos, egg, and chorizo, and Neal got the Italian Omelette. The omelettes come with your choice of toast, hashbrown, and a slice of orange. It was pretty heavenly. The Frisco Omelette had mild cheddar, scallions, and some sort of apple-smoked saussage with fresh avocado on top. The egg was soft and fluffy and all the flavors melded together perfectly. The hashbrown was cooked to perfection - nice and crispy on one side and still soft on the other side. \n\nI had a bite of Alex's grilled cheese. He thought it was amazing. I enjoyed it, but I liked my omelette better. I don't think I was in the mood for something as heavy as a grilled cheese for brunch. \n\nEverything was very affordable - around $10. And we were all stuffed to the brim. \n\nThe service was nice and prompt. They only have a couple servers, but the restaurant was small enough that they were very responsive and didn't give you attitude like I feel most busy brunch places do. \n\nIn all, I'm a fan, and I definitely recommend!", "author": "Jamie C."}

Since when was honey that expensive?! In fact 100% maple syrup is more expensive than honey, so are they serving you corn starch syrup instead of real maple syrup?! That's what I wonder when they feel the need to charge $1 extra for the tiny rationed container of honey, which barely covers one pancake.

I'm not really a breakfast guy, but I love their food here.\n\nIt has the look and feel of a dinner, but the food is (in my opinion) much better than you expect it to be by just looking through the window. Not that the place looks bad at all -it's clean and spacey- it's just better than you expect. They do mostly traditional food. Nothing to crazy I think.\n\nI've had the benedict eggs every time I'm here, and they've nailed them real good each time :)\n\nI wouldn't recommend for parties larger than 4 people.

I went on my own and also took friends and family there since I moved to the neighborhood over that last year. That was until they changed their seating policy. \n\nAt first, I was reluctant to standing in line to sit in a restaurant, I think it's a silly and ineffective way to handle customers since in my teen years, I had hosted and served in restaurants. I gave it a shot. I stood in line with about 3 parties ahead of me. Then the head server, asked how many each of us had. There was only 1 party of 2 ahead of me, 1 of me, a party of 2 behind me. She chose to seat the party of 3 (after the party behind me) and after the people ahead of me and myself had been already waiting 10 minutes. I went inside to ask for a manager or an owner. No such luck from the staff about being so forthcoming so that I could give feedback. The server came in and I said, \"You changed your seating policy and you sat those 3 when others and myself had been waiting.\" She was going to explain that it was because the table was for 4, but I saw that the table was able to be split so she could have sat the party of 2 ahead of me and myself on separate tables. I said, \"That is not the point.\" She had nothing to say and basically opened the door for me to leave instead of trying to make the situation right or apologizing. Poor Poor customer service, especially since I had been there before. Even if you love the Salmon Tartine, who wants to be treated this way when they are just trying to get some breakfast?

Plus, the service is GREAT- it's quick, flexible and adaptable... as soon as they seated me, I told them I already know what I wanted to order, and they took my order RIGHT away. \n\nTheir blueberry pancakes= 5/5!! Not only did they have blueberries cooked IN the pancake, but they also put fresh blueberries over the top. It comes with whipped butter and warm syrup on the side. Warning, these are NOT the thick, fluffy American pancakes that you'd usually get at places like I-Hop or Denny's. These are delicious crepe-like thin pancakes, so I don't feel like I'm swallowing a lump of dough when eating these.\n\nSince it was our first time there, we decided on getting the Denver omelet= 5/5! It comes with hash browns and your choice of various breads. I got their English muffin, and I was severely disappointed by how much they over-toasted it! However, their hash browns TOTALLY made up for it! They were the thinnest hash browns I've ever EATEN! I usually hate thin hash browns, because it's always disgustingly crunchy.

First of all we saw the server calling out names in the wait list and I asked if I could put my name down. She simply told me to wait and DIDN'T tell me that I had to put my own name down... By the time we figured it out, 2 other ppl went on the wait list ahead of us. I understand she was busy, but you have to explain how things work for the first time comers. \nThen, the same person with the wait list incidend ended up being our server. And she managed to make things even worse.\nFirst if all, she came and ANNOUCED (literally for everyone to hear) that she was going to take the order for the new tables all together. I mean, I'm a server as well so I understand that you need to be efficient when is busy and it's totally ok to take the order for multiple tables at once, but don't EVER yell at the customers: \"ok! I'm gonna take all your orders at once!\". That's just poor service... \nAfter that, she made clear she wasn't paying any attention to what we order when she asked if we wanted drinks right after we order an orange juice.\nThen, after our food came, she never came to check back and it took so long for us to get the check that I had to go inside and pay at the register.\nI understand they are super busy, but you either put one more server on the floor or train your employees better.\nThe one star goes for the food that tasted amazing!!\nI really hope a manager will read this and do something about it.", "author": "Cecilia S."}

The coffee is good diner coffee and they seem to clean the pots so, the coffee is never oily.  We never really ordered anything beyond egg white omelets and a side of fruit, so I can't say what their specialties might be.   OK, we split a pancake to be precise but, it was all done very well.

Highly recommended!  \nThe ricotta pancakes with berries was also delish!  Don't forego the unusual and tasty, crispy hash browns!  \n\nThe only word of caution is that the service is not stellar; the servers were pleasant, but we were not offered  coffee refills - had to ask for them and then were told they were brewing a new pot of coffee.  Really? On a Saturday morning at brunch \"rush hour\" you don't have multiple pots of coffee going continuously and someone walking around refilling cups continuously?

Have been going here about two or three times a week for the last six months and their food is delicious.  Their blueberry banana pancakes are a favorite.  Yes, it gets busy, especially at the weekends so you have to sign the sign-in sheet but the food is worth waiting for.  I've given it four stars instead of five for these reasons.\n\n1. Because they get so busy, sometimes your food is left up at the counter for about five minutes before they bring it to you.  I have first hand experience of this, confirmed when putting the butter on the pancakes and it does not melt!  A small thing but I prefer my food hot, not warm.\n2.  The chef(s) can't quite grasp the concept of making the hash browns 'crispy' on both sides. Whether my request is 'lost in translation' is hard to say.\n3.  When you ask them for a top up or a question, they sometimes can get defensive and again, this might be because it is lost in translation or they are very busy.\n\nThese negatives are minor annoyances as the bottom line is the food and the service.  The girls are really friendly in their greetings and accommodating and all the wait staff work really hard, as do the chefs.  It's a neighborhood favorite and I would rather pay a little more here than go somewhere else for a little cheaper.

I mean this is San Francisco, a tourist town. We luckily found that the MYMY Coffee Shop was open. We had been here before a few months back and thought it was pretty good, so we decided to start our holiday off there. A good thing about MYMY is that there never seems to be a line. The one time we went before, we were sat immediately and this time too. Plus whenever I walk by, there are tables open or the wait doesn't look long. I live by Red Door Cafe and I just don't get why people stand around for over an hour for food (and sometimes in the rain). How did this become the status quo?\n\nBack to MYMY! The cafe is small with about 10-15 tables and a counter looking out to Larkin Street. The place is basic and resembles a classic coffee shop. I like their use of orange. We both ordered the Eggs Benedict, my eggs well done, John's poached traditionally. The eggs were done perfectly and the hollaindaise sauce done well with just a touch of lemon. The big problem I had with our meals was that our english muffins were chewy and stale. We really had to saw through them with our dull table knife to get a bite. Quite disappointing. The hash browns redeemed the dish though. Just shredded potatoes with nothing else. Crispy and delicious. Overall the food is average. This is a great breakfast spot if you don't want to wait in line. It's classic coffee shop food, nothing fancy but filling.

It was a Wednesday morning around 9am and the place was about half full. It isn't a very large space and probably wouldn't be good for large groups.  We sat at a little two seater right next to the window. \n\nOur server came right over to take our drink orders. My husband got a cappuccino that came with whipped cream and some nutmeg sprinkled on top.  For breakfast I got the Vanilla Sponge Pain Perdue With Butterscotch Drizzle and my husband got the MOT Sausage breakfast burger. Our food came out pretty quickly and it was amazing. The French toast was big and thick. It was sweet but not over powering. It melted in your mouth. It also came with a berry compote and sliced banans on the side. The sausage burger had fresh homemade sausage and was bursting with flavor. It came with potatoes on the side which were perfectly crispy and had a hint of seasoning to them. \n\nEach entree was around $11 or so and to us seemed well worth it. \nIf we ever return to San Francisco, we will definitely be back here!!", "author": "Hillary S."}

Hungry as hell I decided on the Frisco omelette and the wifey ordered the Spicy pot pork scramble. Of course the daily caffine was supplied. Both dishes hit the spot and they didn't skimp on the ingredients so we couldn't say anything bad. If you can't take spicy food ask for less spice on the pork scramble otherwise enjoy a little heat.

The hash browns were also very tasty and had a perfect crisp.\n\nThe eggs Benedict looked very good, two of my friends had it, one thought it was delicious, the other thought it was just okay.

Let me just make a side note about the fruit (and vegetables for that matter) in California. They are SO much better than the produce we have in PA. The melon doesn't just taste sweet, it tastes like cantaloupe or honeydew. The strawberries are bright red, the blueberries aren't tart, they're sweet and juicy. I thought I didn't even LIKE blueberries. Turns out I just don't like East Coast blueberries. I miss the fruit there ...\n\nSo, back to the task at hand, the pancakes were Swedish style, very thin served with fresh strawberries. Very good. I also had a glass of orange juice that was fresh squeezed. For realsies. Awesome. The second time we went I got the Norwegian benediction with smoked salmon and spinach. After I saw an order of French toast walk by, I regretted my order but after I dug in, it turned out to be delicious. I was a little worried how everything would mesh but the salty fish and the creamy yolk along with crunchy spinach were so good.\n\nThe service here is great. Very warm and friendly.

We are both vegetarian and so we ordered the florentine benediction and the banana-blueberry souffle pancakes. Both dishes pleased us immensely. The thick-cut English muffins of the benediction were delicious as was the hollandaise sauce that smothered everything. We loved the texture of the oyster mushrooms in this dish as well. The side of hashbrowns was perfectly crisped lattice potato network that had just enough salt to satisfy. Our only complaint would be that the dish came out on the lukewarm side. The banana blueberry marscapone pancakes were as thick and perfectly fluffy as other reviewers have mentioned. You could definitely see and taste pockets of marscapone as you ate them. The flavor of the banana was barely there-- perhaps nonexistent, but we definitely saw some blueberries. The candied walnuts and vanilla anglaise sauce were wonderful to contrast the pancakes and add some flavor dimension to the otherwise simple (but comforting) dish. In short, this is a solid brunch spot-- they're not reinventing what it means to brunch, instead they do brunch favorites right. If we came back-- which we will likely do-- we'd probably order the same benediction, but switch the pancakes to another of their sweet offerings.", "author": "T K."}

It was slightly burned on one side, but nothing that would have made me send the order back. My second visit I got the Hass Omelet which was scallions, turkey, jack, and avocado. There was about a handful of scallions so, had a strong taste to it, but the omelet in general was a good one. The eggs were fluffy, and turkey came in good size pieces. The hash browns were thin, and crispy which was awesome, and not soggy at all. \nThe place is not very busy for some reason even though it should be. It's located on California Street so, you can watch the Cable Cars to by which is enjoyable. \nIn all if your looking for a clean, quaint breakfast place that serves no fuss food this is your place.", "author": "Nathan M."}

We accompanied our dishes with their vanilla sponge french toast, every bite was hea-ven-ly and surprisingly not heavy. Every flavor in my mouth was perfection. My boyfriend and I literally ate everything on our plates, including the french toasts and not to mention; our side order of bacon (insert piggy emoji here). As soon as we walked in we were greeted by the most welcoming ladies, i didnt feel for one second they were stuck-up or too busy to ask any of my requests to; more water, more coffee, etc. They were both very attentive.

Unfortunately, I came too late and they ran out before I could order any. Anyway, it felt only like fifteen minutes until we were seated. I ordered the Brioche French Toast with two eggs and sausages. It was yuuuuuum. It was like flan or really soft, melt in your mouth goodness. The hash browns with my dad's dish was wonderful! It wasn't salty or too greasy like most hash browns are. The coffee was amazing. They really know how to make it! The servers were very nice and caring and always had a smile on their face. It's cute, very clean, considering it's only two and a half months old, but in an alright neighborhood. It's not bad, but it's not real nice either.

The wait was 40 minutes and it was drizzly outside so we decided to skip it and try something else. We were walking towards somewhere boyfriend swore he remembered being just down this way...when we passed MYMY Coffee.\n\nI knew I'd passed this place on my way to work in the morning and the cute yellow sign outside always made me wonder what the restaurant was like. We decided to try it and I'm so so so glad we did. Not only did it mean sitting down and eating instead of continuing to wonder through the rain with an empty stomach but the food was fantastic.\n\nHere's what you need to know about this place: the food isn't particularly fancy or special, it's just quality. The orange juice is an orange squeezed into a glass. Really. Not just saying \"fresh squeezed\" it really truly is. This first trip I got a simple egg breakfast with sausage and toast and was completely satisfied. (The hashbrowns here are to die for!) Second time I got the Frisco omelette and think that's definitely my favorite (plus you still get the hashbrowns! I swear one of these times I'll end up ordering just a huge plate of the hashbrowns...)\n\nWe ended up taking friends back here a week later (what can I say, when we know what we like we just want more) and reviews we're split.

I never had a benediction prior to Mymy's, but since their's had chorizo involved in the dish, I jumped all over it. Across the street is olea's - haven't been there yet, but due to the hipster quotient, line outside of marina-durs and lack of proper alcohol paraphernalia in the windows, I avoid it like, well - the marina and hipster territory. \nI wouldn't recommend going with a group of anymore than 4 - looks like they have maybe 4-5 tables which can seat more than 2, so just a heads up.

MYMY was suggested by a friend and it did NOT disappoint. We all ended up with vastly different orders (between five of us we had a smoked salmon benedict, a chorizo benedict, Swedish pancakes, an omelet and a grilled cheese) and everyone walked away happy! The grilled cheese looked ahhh-mazing (a great hangover cure, no doubt) and my eggs benedict was incredible. The portions were perfect, in my opinion, and the pricing is definitely reasonable. You can grab most meals for $10 or less, with only a few being marginally more expensive. All in all, a great little brunch spot with great, attentive service and a delicious array of options.

See my other review for my comments on the hash browns and oj.\n\nSo, how was the french toast?\n\nQuite good. MyMy starts with a large fluffy slice of brioche, dunked in a vanilla flavored batter, and grilled to a crunch. The inside texture varies from custardy to springy. The presentation is a bit unusual. One half of the toast is balanced on its side, to give the dish some height. The other half is laid flat and covered with a generous helping of fruit: about half a banana, 2 or 3 strawberries, and a handful of blueberries and blackberries. \n\nThere's only one problem. The french toast is $11.50. This is a price that I associate with 5 star hotels, not neighborhood breakfast joints. And they have the nerve to charge a dollar extra for maple syrup!\n\nYes, the french toast is good, but not $12:50 worth of good. For that price, it had better be damned good, and generous, too. I was satisfied with the portion, but I have a small appetite.\n\nMyMy Coffee Shop is nothing if not consistent. They make good quality breakfast food, but at inflated prices.", "author": "Michael K."}

Further i have no picture of myself posted. So to pretend to remember me and accuse me of cursing at the hostess is a flat out lie. By the numerous amount of bad reviews containing the exact same experience I had everyone can tell that this wasn't some one off experience or something my girlfriend and I deserved. As everone can also read in the restuatants response to my review, this same type of aggressive, you deserved it, hostility is exactly what we experienced. The also hostess yelled and at us in a condescending  demeanor in front of 30 or 40 waiting customers when questioned her on her method of seating customers, before I said to my girlfriend, \"let's get the f*$! out of here\" as I did not want to be yelled at in front of a group of people. Lastly, the wait was absolutely 2 hours, we had time to get coffee, go back for a pastery, then visit another restaurant, and we returned we still hadn't been called. This is also confirmed in other customers experience. So go and waste your time at this place then end up at one of the much better near by restuarnts when you've had enough of waiting, as do hundreds of other patrons.", "author": "Ali A."}

Went here because Red Door wasn't open and this was the highest rated option close by.  Reviews are wrong, this place BLOWS!  Hubby got his food, which was lukewarm with cold hash browns several minutes before they brought out my plate.  Except it wasn't what I ordered.  Once I flagged someone down to point out the problem, they whisked it away and said mine was coming right out.  LIE.  My husband ate slowly and still finished his food before mine arrived at the table.  My hash browns were cold also!  Seriously, a half hour wait for cold food?  No apology from the awful waiter for the screw up or the wait.  Mediocre food served cold, AWFUL service, and an awful wait.  There are way better options all over this neighborhood.  In fact, I can't think of a worse choice than this place.", "author": "Susan A."}

(I see the same people working there every time I go.)\n\nTry the Hass omelette (turkey, avocado, cheddar, and scallions) or the French toast with sausage and eggs. You can get real maple syrup for just $1 extra.\n\nIt gets pretty crowded on weekend mornings and afternoons, but it usually doesn't take more than 10 minutes to get a table, and they have limited counter seating that is usually available right away.\n\nThe only downside is that they don't serve espresso drinks, but that's a small price to pay.\n\nThis is a great place on the whole.", "author": "Alex C."}

Since I'm too old to wait longer than 15 minutes to eat, we decided to walk around the Polk St area to see what else we could find.  I've decided that people like Red Door so much because by the time they're done waiting, they're so famished that anything they taste must seem like the best thing they've ever eaten.  But I digress.  Anyway, we stumbled upon Mymy, and were pleasantly surprised.  Looks like a hole in the wall, but both the service and the food were excellent.  Our omelettes were super tasty, and chock full of cheese and other goodness.  I loved their hash brown---was thinner and crispier than what I'm used to.

I didn't expect much, and maybe that's why it was such a pleasant surprise. Either way, the name was enticing and the original place we wanted to eat at, Olea's, was closed. We stepped in to the small, quaint diner style breakfast joint and sat at the bar where we could watch the chefs at work. The menu was impressive, with seven different types of Benedictions (menu- http://sanfrancisco.menupages.com/restaurants/mymy-coffee-shop/menu). I ordered the Parmesan Benedict, which  must have been a special since it's not on the menu. It was one of the best Benedicts I've ever had, a real treat especially since it was my Birthday. It had two poached eggs on wheat toast layered with basil, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, a perfect homemade chive Hollandaise sauce, asparagus, and topped with Parmesan cheese. Everything tasted really fresh and healthy. My friend got an omelette with an entire Avocado laid on top. The Hash-Browns were also perfect, very thin and crispy with great flavor, I hardly even added salt. The portions are just the right amount.

First, I was so looking forward to eating some luscious food in concert with all the amazing reviews.  We arrived at 12:15 and were pleasantly surprised it only took us 15 minutes to get a seat.  The waiter came around after a few minutes and we weren't ready so he said he would come back.  I was expecting more pressure than that because there were still people waiting to get a seat after we were seated.  That was nice and I thought \"classy\".  But, after we ordered it took 45 minutes for my daughter to get her \"Frisco\" scramble and my order of french toast with the butterscotch drizzle came about 8 minutes later.  After we thanked God for the food were about to enjoy and before my order came my daughter offered me some of her scramble.  It not only looked \"old\" but it was luke warm and I was very disappointed.  Had they cooked her order and forgotten about mine and then let hers sit for 30 minutes first?  And, it didn't taste very good at all.  My omelettes are better!  I also ordered a side order of hash browns because everyone raved about how good they were but they were average at best.  I have tasted better at Country Waffle and Black Bear easily.....  My order came and to my surprise it was very very good and I would go back for it a 2nd time.  The only reason I didn't rate this a 1 or 2 star is because of the french toast.  Not sure what all the fuss is about.

Friendly and fast service once you get a table, but try to avoid the breakfast/brunch witching hours of 10:30am to 1pm - the word is definitely out on this place. Today it took over an hour for me to get a table for 4. If you are dining solo or with 1 other person, there is sometimes space at a short counter just inside the door. There is a sign-yourself-in waiting list system, which works fine, they do keep current with the list and will come out to call your name if you're waiting outside (most likely, since it's a small place.)
