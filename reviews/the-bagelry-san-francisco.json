The second time I went here, when I ordered poppyseed bagel w/ dried tomatoes, cream cheese and avocado ON THE SIDE. In addition to the fact that I waited for about 20 minutes for my bagel to be ready - which is ridiculous, there was no sausage in it or anything that needed some extra time to prepare, just cream cheese and sliced avocado,- when I opened it I saw avocado, cream cheese and FRESH tomatoes inside the bagel.

However the wait times and spreads are the worst. 99% of the time I'll just order a couple of untoasted bagels to go and grab cream cheese across the street at Real Foods or Walgreens...yes Walgreens brand cream cheese is better. On the rare occasion I'm grabbing something to eat on the go - like today - I'll order something toasted, with their spread and regret it. Every. Single. Time. I start to wonder what's wrong with me that I will actually keep trying their spread and rationalize it with 'maybe if I get a different flavor, it'll be decent'. Nope. And don't get me started on why we can't get a decent bagel in our fair city. How is it that my small hometown in AZ could produce a better bagel than one of the best food cities in the world? And no, I'm not going to wait in a 2 hour line for a pop-up bagel shop. Not going to happen.

They only had a couple of garlic bagels left (one of which I ordered), and proceeded to give it to the lady who ordered 2 dozen bagels behind me in line. I watched them put all the garlic bagels in her bag and made sure to immediately ask them to save me one since I ordered before her. Thankfully they took it out of her bag and prepared my order with the last one. Had I not been watching, they would have given it away and it would have really pissed me off. \n\nI came again this morning on my way to Starbucks because I really wanted a bagel with cream cheese, and Starbucks doesn't come close to making decent bagels. It wasn't crowded, and they had plenty of bagel flavors left. This made me quite happy. I ordered, and paid my $2.50. They got my order right this time which was awesome!

Bagels = boiled.  Not boiled = not a bagel. It's that simple. This is important to note for the simple reason that Noah's \"Bagels\" are not boiled, they are steamed. The end result is that you have a piece of Wonder Bread in the shape of a donut, just not as tasty. They do this, in order to maximize the amount of product they can produce. It's this process that has earned them the nick-name \"McBagels.\" \n\nFortunately, The Bagelry does not do that. They realize that to cook a bagel with steam is like cooking a medallion of tenderloin beef with an arc welder. Instead they kick it old-school, by boiling them before oven baking. The process may be a little slower, but the result is a genuine bagel with a hard exterior, and a chewy interior. \n\nThe Bagelry does pride itself on offering one of the best New York-style bagels (meaning salt is used in the dough-making process, not sweeteners such as honey. That would be a Montreal-style bagel), along with other offerings that one would expect to find in any of the Five Burroughs: YooHoo, celery and egg cream sodas, high-quality salmon, the Sunday Times, everything but your typical New York attitude.\n\nLike a good West-Coast bagel shop, expect to find the usual wide variety of bagels and flavored cream cheeses as well as the expected garden toppings. Other nosh-able items are available, such as ham and cheese breakfast bagels, and bageldogs (highly recommended) are also at the ready for your \"nom nom nom\" enjoyment. \n\nBut, as good as this place is, there are some down-sides: supplies quite often run out quickly, it's usually a bit dirty, and lines out the door are common in the mornings. But considering the product, and that all leftover bagels are donated to various food charities, these are minor problems. \n\nSo in conclusion, if you're looking for a bag of breakfast treats for your office, or are just in search of your Sunday morning coffee and a salt-bagel with lox and schmeer, you'd be hard-pressed to find a better bagel shop in the area, or in the city for that matter.

I'm a total bagel snob, having been raised on bagels in and around NYC. I would say the Bagelry's stuff is one notch below H&H in New York. \n\nIf you are looking for an authentic bagel, look no further. They aren't the smooshy steamed type you get at Noahs, Costco, etc. I'm shocked to see another review here actually saying Noahs bagels are good. In my opinion, Noah's bagels are tasteless, squishy, and foam-like. \n\nNow, as for the establishment and service, it's not amazing, but what the heck, I'm just ordering a bagel and creme cheese, so I don't expect 5 star service. I realize people in SF are used to pristine looking establishments, but again, if you'd ever been to a real bagel shop where they make their bagels, you always find them a little run down (because they are cooking the bagels here). And again, I'm usually running inside to order a bagel, and then eating it outside or at home, so I don't really care what the inside decor is like.\n\nBottom line: if you want a terrific and authentic bagel, go to the bagelry. If you want a pristine establishment, fast-food like service and a crappy bagel, go to Noahs.", "author": "Chirpy M."}

I don't want to make this place out to be something that it's not, either. Don't expect to be wowed by the interior or get lost in its charm. A dingy ATM greets you on the outside, and there's not much for the eyes inside. Don't expect to sit and lounge with your meal. Bagelry is very casual, fairly quick and you get plenty of bang for your buck. You can get a filling and quality breakfast sandwich for five bucks, and with a varied selection of bagels, spreads and other toppers, you shouldn't have trouble finding something for you. I had heard before visiting that this place can get slow, but I am yet to experience a noticeable delay in my orders.

But the expiration date says 5.21.12! Ok, whatever- but then don't make up some ridiculous explanation that your scanner is broken, because every other Scoutmob-affiliated business has simply taken the paper, or written down the number, and that was that. But her response was that it was too much work for them to gather the numbers and then call Scoutmob--- it's very simple, it's called an Excel file, just copy down the numbers and email it to them--- and then she tried to sell me on their App (again, no smartphone). We were hungry, so we tried to order food anyway, but then they don't take credit/debit, even for an order over $5. But you have a scanner for your smartphone app? I don't understand. I'm just really disappointed that businesses like this exist where they use services like Scoutmob as a huge advertising ploy, and then when customers venture into their store as a result, make up some story and don't honor the deal.

After that, the debate is probably about as useful as the \"real\" pizza debate.  \n\nThese are the first bagels I have had in San Francisco that I really like.  I stop here on the weekend on my way home after running at Golden Gate Park.  This is the quintessential bagel shop -- austere, hot, bagels in wire baskets.  I take them home.  So, I am not looking for a place to sit or prepared food or anything other than good bagels.  I just want to grab a dozen and go.   There is usually a line when I am there.  Like most real bagel shops, they will run out of a particular variety.  I'm usually flexible.  So, that is not a problem.  It is never the same ones.  So, I figure it is caused by the vagaries of day-to-day demand.  \n\nPlain, poppy seed, sesame seed.  Even cinnamon-raisin, rye, pumpernickel and whole wheat.  But is blueberry a real bagel?
