Came on a Friday night and only waited around 20 minutes (for the pasta side). Our waiter was awesome and really knew his stuff! Great recommendations! \n\nWe got the heirloom tomatoes with burrata (must get!)- it was soo flavorful- probably the best tomatoes I've had in my life, so juicy and delectable. The burrata of course was awesome, I could eat this dish forever! \n\nThe crudo was good but unfortunately, not my fav. I didn't enjoy the avocado cream- I felt it was too overpowering for the dish. \n\nThe pappardelle duck sugo was great! Pasta was very al dente, sauce was not too salty- just enough flavor, not too rich either. We also tried a shrimp pasta with red sauce. Was the chef's special, I thought it was OK, no complaints. Pasta also was al dente. \n\nFor dessert, we tried the lemon ginger panna cotta- good (not too lemony or gingery as I was thinking) and the affogato. Overall everything from service to food to ambiance was great. Will definitely come back to try the spaghetti (best spaghetti west of the Mississippi?? We'll see!)", "author": "Vivian D."}

Service was hit or miss last night. While our waitress was friendly and got to us quickly most of the time, there were parts of service that were forgotten, e.g. asking for water multiple times. They also normally source their bread from right next door (Tartine!), but Tartine didn't come through, so they had different bread, which came out cold and a little tough. The wine selection, however, is extensive and very user-friendly; though, I wish they had much lower prices for the rest of their drinks (almost $10 for a Peroni is highway robbery seeing as how Bestia can do Two-Hearted Ale for about $7).\n\nThe food itself is very decent, but again, for a restaurant without a Michelin, prices are really high for the portions you're getting. Calamari salad? Smattering of greens on top of a bed of beans and maybe 3 small, grilled squid. The calamari itself was tender, but the flavor was pure salt bath. Out of the hangar steak with fries, porchetta with polenta, and short rib tortelli, the tortelli wins out. Soft little pillows of savory tortelli await you in this primi, while the secondi of steak comes with a bed of soft, limp fries. The steak itself, while perfectly grilled, was bland and not dry-aged. The porchetta was large in portion size, but basically sat on soggy, overly salty lettuce. The polenta is not integrated into this dish and served as a side. The best part of the whole meal was probably the almond torte accompanied by gelato.", "author": "Danny C."}

I came here for Memorial Day dinner and was treated to a great dining experience.  The menu can be overwhelming but the server helped me pick out a few great items:\n\n(1).  Parmesan custard and porcini mushrooms (5/5) - really delicious way to start a meal.  This was not listed on the menu since they can only make a few dishes that night but I was one of the first diners for the evening and lucked out. \n(2).  Grilled calamari with white bean salad (5/5) - This item is always in the menu and I can taste why. The char on that grilled calamari was just perfect and really went well with the white beans and olives.  It's nice to have calamari grilled instead of breaded and fried.  It's rustic Italian at its absolute best. \n(3).  Hen and Pancetta Agnolotti (5/5) - fresh pasta perfectly cooked stuffed with ground chicken and pork.  Decadent little bites of heaven that I could eat all day long. \n(4).  Black Cod with saffron aioli and fennel broth (5/5) - perfectly cooked cod with crispy skin with that broth and the aioli.  I almost just drank the broth from the bowl. It's that good. \n(5).  Orange blossom panna cotta with apricots and honey (2/5) - it's good but not the best panna cotta I've had. Also, something was off with the texture (it's a bit softer/runnier than what I expected). \n(6).  Chocolate hazelnuts as small bites to end the meal was really nice and good recovery after that panna cotta.  \n\nThey also made a virgin Bellini for me which served as the non-alcoholic pairing for the meal.  Service was good and the restaurant itself is nice but a little outdated.  Including tax and tip, the above meal ended up being $125, which I think is a fair price for the level of food and service. Overall, I think this place is 4.5 stars but I'm rounding down due to the panna cotta.  This is definitely recommended for rustic Italian cuisine with a California twist.", "author": "Andrew S."}

I had done my makeup in the car and attempted to do my hair while driving too (I had tried to preheat my curling iron at home and curl my hair in the car but it didn't work and I pretty much arrived with bedhead).  I also dressed once parked (a lady walking her dog noticed I had put my dress on wrong and helped me tie my dress while I put on my shoes).   \n\nMy date was an absolute gentleman, texting that he'll be waiting at the bar in response to my \"running late\" text.  When I arrived, he promptly walked over to the hostess and let her know that we were ready for our reservation who, in turn, swiftly brought us to our table.   The back wall was mirrored so I was able to sneak a peak at myself before sitting down.   Thank you, Delfina.  I needed a quick check or would have been wondering whether I remembered to put eyeliner on both eyes and not just one.   Luckily, both eyes had liner.  \n\nAt my request, my date ordered for us and we had a salad, bread and butter, spaghetti, and the rosemary chicken with mashed potatoes.  The salad was a perfect starter and my date mentioned that the restaurant made its own butter and that I should try it.   I normally don't butter my own bread but am always willing to give it a try if a place cultures its own butter.   It was good but my favorite butter is still Lazy Bear's.   The spaghetti was good but a few strands of the pasta was slightly undercooked.   The rosemary chicken was bathed in a rich and flavorful, savory sauce which went well with the delicious mashed potatoes.   Honestly, it was the sauce on the rosemary chicken that really stood out for me and I would have been happy with just the sauce and mashed potatoes, it was so good.  \n\nThe service at the restaurant was excellent.   Our waitress was thoughtful, professional, smooth and considerate.   \n\nBoth my date and I were full by the time we were served the rosemary chicken so we just halved a piece to sample it.

And when I saw the wine menu at about $16 a glass, I refused that as well, asking that we go to a nearby bar (which we did), instead.   \n\nNice place.  Good food.  Excellent service.

They are a proper restaurant where you can order an actual meal as opposed to \"small plates to share\". I had the trout with peas - really delicious. The artichoke side dish was very flavorful. My husbands pasta was delicious too - nice flavor from the nettles, not what I expected. \n\nBad: the tables. They only have tables of 4. So you come with your date and they seat you with other couple. I'm sorry - no. If I wanted to eat at a cafeteria, I would do that. I'd like to have a conversation with my husband only and not with another couple also listening in. I was not fooled with the inch of space they put between us and the other couple. \n\nIn conclusion, I would come back to enjoy the delicious food, but only with a party of 4.", "author": "Anne M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-26", "description": "This was well recommended and on our list for a while. A Sunday night dinner proved to be incredibly disappointing. It appears that the staff perhaps are resting in laurels formed long ago as the entire experience from service to food was below average. Our waiter was really slow to respond from the beginning and also between courses. Very aloof and haughty and prone to long conversations with \"regulars\" while ignoring other tables. When we sent a dish back he was only mildly apologetic.\n\nWe had asparagus, speidini, some straw/hay carbon-whatta pasta, and a sad duck. The asparagus was great and chilled with a delicious cream sauce. From there it just got worse and worse. Apparently anything that needed heating was a challenge. A chicken liver speidini came literally bloody and lukewarm with livers that were practically raw if not tasty. At this point in the meal, having followed the asparagus we just assumed this was how the dish was supposed to be and ate it cautiously... only afterwards we'd figure out that actually serving hot cooked food was an issue for Delfina.\n\nHeating food as well as timing was an issue all night. Long waits between courses just accentuated the fact that our water bottle was empty after the first 15 minutes. A random assortment of staff would come and retrieve clean cutlery and replace plates and then the clock would tick and we just started to make jokes about it because we pretty much knew we were stuck.\n\nBy the time our straw/hay carbonara-themed pasta arrived, we were hoping for something amazing to appear and were sadly disappointed. This \"highly recommended\" meager portion of undercooked (yes we know what al dente pasta is - this was pasty and undercooked) and lukewarm pasta in green and tan arrived with an overly salted sauce that tasted like chicken soup from a packet. The temperature was so gross that after the waiter rather invasively leaned over and tossed the pasta at the table with a raw egg yolk it begged the question which of us was wanting to get salmonella tonight. Seriously gross pasta... course 2 that Delfina apparently didn't know how to cook and serve.\n\nThen came the winner... three rubbery slices of duck breast that were literally red and raw. At first we were trying to figure out whether it was sous vide or not but trying to cut it with the serrated knife they supplied seemed to make that theory unlikely. We literally had to saw through gristle in and between red cold raw meat. In the end we placed all remaining chunks back on the silly sauerkraut they presented it on and gave up.\n\nAgain loud and punchy waiter showed back up with a cursory apology and again missing our lack of water, retrieved the duck. We ordered dessert to feel like we hadn't wasted our time but even the credibly made panna cotta couldn't fix it. And after all panna cotta is chilled so apparently that is what they are good at - cold uncooked food.\n\nDelfina was recommended to me over four years ago as the best in the neighborhood. Perhaps it was my fault to wait so long to go... I had pizza at their counter next door before and it was wonderful... maybe I just thought it would always be there and always be good. Apparently something has gone wrong since I was first told to indulge there. There are many great places to eat in SF. Given my experience, I can't say this is one of them.", "author": "Michael P."}

My fianc\u00e9 and I came to visit SF to celebrate his birthday and since I love Italian food, and specifically pasta, I found Delfina and made a reservation for a nice dinner. The space itself was very cute, like most places in SF, it was tiny, so you are VERY close to other tables, but that is just a product of being in the city. But you know its not good when the best part of the food was the cheese plate. Its not that the food was bad... I just didn't think it was all that great. And when you are paying top dollar for good pasta, you want the food to be something you cant make for yourself at home. I got the spaghetti with tomato sauce, and while the pasta itself was really good quality, the tomato sauce tasted like it had been poured from a jar. The duck ragu was the same way...It was just average. And really the folks sitting around us were so freaking pretentious! You know you SF has gotten bad cause the table next to us was two guys at a startup trying pitching a super wealthy couple for money. It was like listening in on a really, really bad date!

I think the waiter said it was made from buffalo milk. Whatever it's made of, it's literally the best butter I have ever had!!! It's so creamy and the flavor is amazing. It was so good that we asked the waiter if we could take some of it home. Of course the tartine bread was also amazing. \n\nMonterey calamari: this appetizer was good, but I felt like it lacked something. I think the sauce could've been better. The calamari tasted fresh though.\n\nSpaghetti: this was a simple classic dish. Good, but not amazing.\n\nBolognese: this was probably my favorite dish I had that night. Pasta was cooked perfectly and sauce was delicious.\n\nQuail: tasted too salty for my liking. It was nice that they split it onto 2 plates for us though.\n\nWe passed on dessert since the food didn't impress us. I probably won't be coming back since I can get better Italian food at Flour+Water. I'll still be coming to Pizzeria Delfina next door though!", "author": "Mai Y."}

We got seated right when we arrived and ordered our drinks of two Sorelle Bronca Particella 68 Prosecco by the glass and a Blood Orange Pellegrino. The Prosecco was light, which paired well with my heavy Dungeness crab risotto - which was bomb! I cleared it up quick and thoroughly. It was rich in crab flavor with lots of crab bits. Though i bit into a lot of crab shells, the flavor was all there. We also started with the pork rinds, which have a strong spice flavor and a kick of spicy to it - i recommend trying because it was super tasty. The other two appetizers we ordered: tartine bread (bomb as always with the butter) and Gnocco Frito, which looked like a ravioli pasta cooked crispy with a cheese-topping. Also tasty and worth trying, but it only came with 3 pieces. My friend had the Roasted Mary's Chicken, which was juicy with a beautifully tasty crisp for its thin skin. It came with a side of mash, which was also very yummy. For desserts we had the coconut panna cotta and the cantucci - the coconut panna cotta was delicious and i highly recommend ordering as a dessert. Strong coconut addictive flavor panna cotta and the sweet oranges and citrus balanced well with it. This dish came with a candle to celebrate my birthday which was sweet. We also had the Cantucci, which was super duper hard to bite into. It is tasty when you're able to break it down, but probably best with coffee because it can probably break teeth trying to eat it. Overall, $200 for 3 people, which is ok. Every part of the meal had a great option in each category: appetizer, entree and dessert. Solid spot!", "author": "Amanda C."}

The grilled squid salad was bright, smoky, with nice flavors and halibut crudo was fresh, nicely balanced with the avocado and the acid but the duck oh the duck. I was hoping from the other reviews that it was a fluke or they didn't know what they were talking about. Unfortunately, it came without crispy skin, raw not rare in the middle, so there was no delicious melding of flavors and the sauerkraut was so overpowering I could have been eating a Costco dog for goodness sakes! I was so sad because I love duck and was looking forward to it.  The gnocchi was also a disappointment as they weren't soft and pillowy and more chewy. The Sugo accompaniment was delicious.

This is the only Delfina location- the other locations focus on pizza.\n\nThe first time I visited Delfina was a few years ago. My friend introduced me to their spaghetti and I loved it. The spaghetti is prepared al dente and paired with the most perfect tomato sauce. The sauce has ripe plum tomatoes, a touch of garlic, and pepperoncini for a nice kick. The server also comes by to add cheese on the pasta. This is hands down my favorite dish at Delfina and the dish that keeps me coming back. I have tried the gnocchi as well, but I also find myself gravitating towards the spaghetti. \n\nI also tried the Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari that comes on a bed of white bean salad. The calamari pieces were nothing special, but I was surprised by the white bean salad. Although it is simple, the white beans are extremely fresh and the combination of olive oil and other sauces made is really delicious!\n\nThey also serve Tartine bread here, but I prefer to buy my Country Loaf fresh at Tartine. \n\nLove that they incorporate local produce into their menu.

I've always heard about disastrously long waits here - particularly on weekends. However I was able to snag an 8:30 pm reservation for Tuesday evening (albeit it being quite rainy for SF) a couple hours before. The restaurant wasn't very crowded when we arrived -- which made it all the more strange that we were seated almost next to the door, and adjacent to a table of 4. When most of the restaurant is empty, it doesn't seem to make a lot of sense to cluster all of the diners right near the entrance. Just my two cents, although it certainly wasn't a big enough deal to complain about.\n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our meal at Delfina, and will certainly be back. We ordered the Tartine bread + house-cultured butter di bufala (SO creamy and just enough sweetness to perfectly complement the sourdough bread) to start, and the spaghetti and Roasted Mary's Organic Chicken to share. The chicken was extremely flavorful and juicy, and came with trumpet mushrooms and excellent olive oil mashed potatoes. Portion sizing was perfect. \n\nCheck out Bi Rite ice cream across the street after dinner for dessert!", "author": "Quyen V."}

I was confused why she was so rude, so I clarified for her, \"If we dined in here, is there a restroom here we can use?\" She became more RUDE and said, \"There's a porta potty on the corner! Go use it! We can't have people coming in here and clogging up our toilets!\" I was so appalled! I asked nicely and was just looking for a restaurant to eat at with a restroom! \n\nThen my partner said, \"I guess we're not eating here!\" Then the rude hostess suddenly gained clarity and asked us if we wanted to eat pizza then use their restroom. NO THANKS! \n\nThis could have been miscommunication or she was pissed from people trying to use their restroom without buying anything?

Last time we were at Tartine, I told my husband that we really should try Delfina soon.  We finally did, and Delfina proved to be a good choice!\n\nWe were celebrating the end of the first semester at work, so I thought why not some bubbles to start off our meal! I was very happy to see a Blood Orange Bellini on the menu.  I love blood oranges, and they're in season right now.  The Bellini was a beautiful color and the flavor, even better.  If they have it when you dine, get it!  The hubby decided on a glass of Chianti which really opened up and got better the longer it sat on our table. \n\nWe started with the Monterey Bay Calamari appetizer. The calamari was grilled and rested on a bed of a white bean salad which had fris\u00e9e, arugula and olives mixed in it. The creaminess of the beans balanced out the bitterness of the fris\u00e9e, the pepperiness of the arugula and the saltiness of the olives.  And of course the star of the dish was the calamari, which was perfectly cooked.  It had a hint of sweetness and just melted in your mouth.  Too bad there were only about 5 or 6 pieces of calamari on it!\n\nIf you have not had Tartine's famous country loaf, you can get an order of their bread here to start the meal. We saw Tartine staff deliver freshly-baked loaves to Delfina as we were waiting outside for the restaurant to open. The only reason why we didn't order the bread was because we actually bought a loaf and started eating it before dining at Delfina. As a result, we were not that hungry when we started eating!\n\nFor our mains, the hubby ordered the Spaghetti.  It was good, and it would be a great choice for a vegetarian.  I ordered the Grilled Swordfish which also came on a bed of beans. We ate a lot of swordfish when were in Greece, and it has become one of my favorites.  Like the calamari, the swordfish was perfectly cooked.  The gremolata and the peppered fennel wedges added a boost of flavor to the fish and beans.  The dish was a nice portion, so I was perfectly full after the main course.\n\nConsequently, we declined to have dessert here. Plus, Bi-Rite Creamery was only a few steps away.  I just really needed a small scoop of ice cream to end the evening.\n\nService was great throughout the meal. The place is beautiful, but a little cramped.  Our table for two was next to a table for two, and we can hear everything they were talking about.  Kinda awkward.  2 drinks, 1 app and 2 mains added to about $95 without tip. If I come back here, I'd eat at the bar.", "author": "Hazel C."}

I remember having no expectations the first time I was there and being very pleasantly surprised. My experience this time was just as great, and the food was delicious.\n\nThe two of us split a few things, but we had a little too much food. We added on the soup at the last minute as the waiter got to our table, and that was probably overkill.\n\n1) Gnocco fritto & black truffle mortadella - I thought this would be similar to gnocci (I know.. probably not valid to assume that just because gnocco is one letter off, but I did), and was completely caught off guard when the dish actually came. The gnocco fritto are actually large and airy squares of dough that are completely empty on the inside (think empty, fried ravioli shell)! The gnocco is salty already, providing more flavor, so it isn't just mortadella on dough.\n\n2) Brussels sprouts - I love brussels sprouts, and these were fantastic. The caramelized glaze was slightly sweet, and the brussels sprouts themselves were roasted to just the right level so that the outer leaves were browned but not burnt. Still undecided how I feel about the hazelnuts in this appetizer, but they weren't bad.\n\n3) Chicken liver rustica - Mediocre. The chicken liver pate comes spread on pieces of toast already. The sometimes fishy taste of liver that turns people away was not overwhelming, but none of the other flavors in the pate were very strong either.\n\n4) Celery root soup - Creamy and celery-y.\n\n5) Dry-aged Liberty duck - With pomegranate and turnips, the duck was delicious!! It was cooked a little more than medium rare and so tender. I just wish they had plated it with just a touch more sauce though.\n\nI also had a glass of montepulciano with my meal.

For dessert, we shared the butter-toasted olive oil cake.  The table next to us had been waiting even longer.  They were talking to each other, asking if this was normal.  \n\nFood took quite a while to come out.  The soup was the best part of the meal.  I enjoyed the taste, and the creamy richness of every scoop.  The ingredients complimented each other in a harmonious way.  I also liked that it was green!  After the soup, I had high expectations for the spaghetti and chicken.  \n\nThe spaghetti was underwhelming.  It was not bad, nor was it something to brag about.  There was no wow factor.  It just tasted like spaghetti you or I would be able to make at home.  The chicken was okay.  For $24, I did expect more.  I appreciated how the mashed potatoes were served on a separate plate.  \n\nThe olive oil cake was good.  The sweet and bitterness of the strawberries paired well with the gelato and cake.  One must get a small bite of each simultaneously to thoroughly enjoy it.\n\nOne thing that I did notice was the final bill was not accurate.  The soup was advertised on the menu at $10, yet I was charged $12.  Our server apologized like she was not surprised of this error, or it was not the first time someone complained.  Needless to say, this is very bad on the restaurant's end.  For those who order the soup and do not really check their receipt, they would never know they are getting ripped off $2.  It may not sound like much, but it is the principle.  I doubt the Delfina will contact everyone that was affected of this extra charge because I highly doubt they even care.  But I do know this is unethical, if not illegal.  \n\nAnother thing I noticed was when an older couple asked for water, our same server asked them if they wanted sparkling or tap.  Whether age or race plays a factor into why she did not ask us if we wanted a choice in the matter, I won't ever know.  That is just something to think about if you come here.  As a benefit of the doubt, maybe she was tired and just forgot to ask us.  But, nevertheless, I still notice these little things.\n\nTL;DR : Terrible service, average tasting food, possibly ageist, racist staff.  I was overcharged.  I won't be back.", "author": "Victor L."}

Cozy and intimate setting with good selection of Italian wine, the experience is a delight. The service was awesome and the server made it a pleasure to find the gems of the food. They do serve bread from the neighbouring Tartine bakery and its delicious but no stars for that. I ordered a Calamari and it looked great. It was grilled prep but unfortunately it was charred underneath to an extent that it just left a strong bitter overtone that engulfed the mouth. The server promptly took it off the bill though. The spaghetti and ravioli though were incredibly delicious. Hen & Prosciutto Agnolotti | burro fuso was unique, fresh. The delicate gamy hen was prepared in a beautiful symphony with herbs and the perfectly cooked agnolotti brought the balance that made the tastes dance  on the palate. The spaghetti perfectly cooked with delicate, simple but fresh tomato sauce reminded me of the home cooked pasta in Italy. The sides of carrot was as delightful.

The Grilled-Calamari was subpar--it came with very few pieces of calamari and the beans in the dish were overwhelming. However the pasta was fantastic. \n\nI'm giving it a 4/5 because of two things. First, I had this reservation for a month and yet we were seated in the bar area which feels extremely cramped. The waitress had barely enough room to turn from table to table.

People keep telling me how good it is and I wanted to know what the hype was all about. \n\nThe first time I went, my friend and I weren't very hungry so decided to just get two pastas to share. After we spoke to the server, he said they can do half portions for all the pastas! I love trying more things but in smaller portions.\n\nWe ended up getting 3 pastas, all half portions. One was their classic tomato spaghetti, second was the pulled pork pappardelle, and the last one was butternut squash tortellini with chestnuts. All 3 pastas were amazing, despite not being hungry we finished all 3 so fast and nothing was left on the plates. Our favorite was the tortellini (and I normally don't like stuffed pastas!) \n\nWe went back again a week later (Delfina changes their menu almost daily!) and had the calamari app, the calamari was cooked perfectly. Pasta FOR SURE as our mains (this time no half sizes!) - again the classic spaghetti, another stuffed pasta and chitarra integrale. Hats off to the pasta chef - all 3 left us wanting to come back the next day. I'm so happy with the pastas that I'm not going to waste my time on the mains hah!

The sauce was so creamy, we didn't need much of it.\nAffogato - I've never had it with amaro before, which I dislike in isolation, but enjoyed with this espresso and gelato.

When the waiter came over to take our order I asked him for some recommendations and he seemed annoyed, he told me one thing and didn't care to elaborate so I just ordered the simplest thing on the menu. I ordered a glass of wine and it was significantly less than what other people were getting and same goes for the food. We ordered the spaghetti which is supposed to be amazing and not only was the spaghetti hard but the sauce tasted straight out of a can. The funny thing is my boyfriend ordered the large portion and I ordered a small and they were the same size... the guy next to me got the large and it was twice as big as my boyfriends we were so confused!

Once my friend and I arrived to the restaurant the hostess said they had to let our table go. My friend and I were very unhappy about that as we had come from far away and made this reservation far in advance. Luckily, they were still able to seat us immediately but just at a table that was not in the best location. My friend and I ordered white wine, which was only alright for 10 dollars a glass. I also felt that our waiter was a tad rude. Again, luckily two other waiters served us as well and they were much friendlier. My friend and I both ordered the spaghetti and it was definitely tasty. We also ordered dessert to treat ourselves for the new year. We ordered the hazelnut caramel pear cake. This is what made my unhappy friend happy again.

I'm from out of town and always make it a point to eat here when visiting. Tonight was my fourth time I got to tantalize my tastebuds with the riches of Delfina's menu. Their menu is updated daily but they do have some staples which are always offered. For starters (literally) the bread from Tartine is served with homemade butter. Tartine is my jam, but it's also the bread to my butter whenever visiting Delfina. I don't think I've ever ordered one of their staples for the main course, but twice I've ordered an Agnolotti pasta which is basically an orgasm for your tastebuds. So, if they're offering Agnolotti when you dine, GET IT. For dessert I got the \"Rome Apple Semifreddo\" which I had no idea what it was but the description next to it \"ginger quince granita, graham crunch\" is what roped me in.....\"graham crunch\" lol. Yes please. If you want a double tastebud orgasm then search no further for the perfect dessert. Thank you Delfina, for satisfying the fat kid in me.\nP.S.

One of the nice things I liked about the restaurant is that you can get half-size on the pasta dishes if you so choose.  That's not advertised on the menu, but you can make the request.  \n\nWe had three pastas: the tagliatelle, plain spaghetti, and the linguine with clam sauce.\n\nThe tagliatelle with meat sauce was the best of the three pastas I tried. The pasta was cooked at the right texture and the meat was tender and flavorful with the sauce.  The herbs actually made the dish quite balanced as well. \n\nThe regular spaghetti had the al dente pasta, but the sauce combined with the pasta made the entire bite in my mouth mushy for some reason.  It was like the sauce overpowered the texture of the pasta.  The sauce tasted like it was missing something. It wasn't as balanced as I would expect from a relatively fancy restaurant.  It was a bit too tart.  Overall, I was disappointed in the dish considering it's supposed to be a classic Italian dish that a highly-rated Italian restaurant should have. \n\nThe linguine with clam sauce was really salty. The clams came out fine and was probably the best of part of the dish.  I typically like salty food, however, even I thought this linguiine dish was too salty.  Other than that, it was pretty good.  \n\nI might be willing to come back again and try some of of their other dishes.  May want to skip the pasta section all together.", "author": "Shirley C."}

Pasta dishes like the pappardelle and rosemary tagliatelle are solid and decently portioned, and who can resist scrumptious desserts like the panna cotta?\n\nThe wine offerings here are also extensive, and the California flight is a good way to sample several different white wines over the course of your meal.

I came here for dinner a few nights ago - we had an 8 PM reservation but showed up a bit early and they were able to seat us. Strangely, I felt as though our server kept rushing us through our meal even though we'd gotten there before our reservation time. Anyway, on to the food:\n\n- Chilled California Asparagus\n- Fennel Sausage\n- Tripe alla Fiorentina\n- Special of the Day: Black Squid Ink Corzetti with Octopus\n- Berkshire Pork Saltimbocca\n\nThe asparagus was a light and refreshing start to the meal, though admittedly it didn't taste like much. The fennel sausage was very flavorful and prepared well. However, I was most excited about the tripe. I've been told that having tripe on the menu is a sign of old-school Italian cooking, and tripe is one of my guilty pleasures. I was really pleased with how it was prepared.\n\nThe Berkshire pork saltimbocca, sadly, fell short. The pork was very dry and not particularly flavorful. It was a disappointing conclusion to our meal but given that I mostly enjoyed the rest of our dishes, I'd be willing to come back and give Delfina another shot.", "author": "Kelly L."}

There are many types of Italian food as there are many regions from which they come. And there are not a lot of options and nothing that jumped out at me as that which I just had to have. I believe it is because nothing is recognizable, you have to read every item to get an idea of it. Call it - made up Italian dishes. \nThe Calamari al forno was all about the smoke. Calamari is a light flavor that you need to coax out of the fish. This you could not recognize as calamari except for the texture. Four little squid on a plate of white bean for $18 is price gouging. \nThe pasta was good and cooked properly - they selected the right provider. The sauce was thick with a heavy thick taste and textured not delicate at all and not served hot enough. once you put cheese on it the whole thing got pasty.\nI asked for olive oil for my bread, so as not to destroy great bread with butter. I was old, heavy and tasteless. This is a really big miss. A decent Italian restaurant would always default to the best olive oil. Sadly this must be the oil they cook with.\nThe salad was fresh- very American and really good. Call the Place Delf's on 18th and claim to be American nuovo cuisine and you might have not been a disappointing.\nHard to find a reasonably priced wine and the beers are nearly Ball Park prices. \nThe bread was great - it was from Tartines next door.\nBob", "author": "Bob D."}

I was thrilled that I scored a New Years Eve reservation this past weekend and was so looking forward to it. Things started out great. We ordered a nice bottle of Barbera, bread, a salad, brussels sprouts and a sformato (which was one of the best things I have ever eaten). Then the mains came and the wheels came off. My pasta was fine but my two companions got the traditional Delfina spaghetti, which we have gotten a hundred times. This time they were so salty as to be inedible. They were sent back with assurances that replacements would be out very soon. By time I finished my pasta replacements were nowhere in sight. My companions were now not interested and cancelled the order. We asked for a cappuccino and the bill. The manager brought the bill and announced that in compensation (for not receiving two main dishes on New Years Eve) he removed the brussels sprouts from the bill (the least expensive thing we ordered, save for the bread). Seriously?? I then noticed that the bottle of wine we ordered was charged at 75 dollars despite being listed on the menu at 65. I went to discuss this with the manager and pointed out that a free order of Brussels sprouts was hardly the correct response to two main dishes not being served and a mischarged bottle of wine (he had \"no idea\"how that happened and mumbled something about vintages). He then asked what I thought would be appropriate. I told him that was his job, but the idea that a 9 dollar side dish was sufficient for a messed up NYE dinner was ridiculous. He came back with the wine price corrected and my pasta also being comped. Whatever. We signed the bill and headed to the door. One the way out the manager grabbed me and gave me a $50 gift certificate. That is took so much drama and insistence on my part to get to this point was sort of outrageous for one of San Francisco's best restaurants on NYE. \n\nI'll definitely return, but this was not one of Delfina's finer moments.", "author": "Keith S."}

It was fairly easy to get an 8pm Thursday dinner reservation the day before online. They were still busy and bustling, and I liked the simple holiday decor of some white lights, a few long wreaths. The service was fantastic, the decor classy, romantic yet casual. I have always loved my meals here. \n\nMUST-HAVES: Fagioli all'Uccelletto for a filling starter, and if you're looking for a unique entree Tripe all Fiorentina (these 2 are similar though!). \n\nCONTORNI\n* Fagioli all'Uccelletto | tomato, guanciale. $8 - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=ba12rWbT7Bku1EH3BQj0LA#ba12rWbT7Bku1EH3BQj0LA\nThis was wonderful! Definitely a heavy dish, definitely full of starches and carbs. But also definitely full of flavor, filling for a starter, and has beans cooked to the perfect texture with bits of crisp in there too. \n\n* Delicata Sqush | mint, balsamico. $8 - 3 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=pzQK-6pmYK-m9anRtB5t9A#1IgDfNPdd0iSBQuPFoCOhg\nThis was a unique way of having squash - they were cut into very large pieces and were soft, almost like the texture of beans. You could see bits of black char which made me wish they were crisped, but alas they were not, and the texture was pretty uniform throughout. The balsamic wasn't very strong either - another slight disappointment. \n\n* Brussels Sprouts | pancetta, horseradish. $8 - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=pzQK-6pmYK-m9anRtB5t9A#e1C3ja_PErnpR2lOcCppSw\nAlways a solid choice for starter! The crispy, savory bacon bits are the perfect complement to the brussels sprouts. The sprouts themselves could be more crisp, though I know it's hard to get rid of that soft, soggy texture. \n\nANTIPASTI\n* Insalata di Campo | field greens, pancetta, walnuts, parmigiano, balsamic vinaigrette. $11 - 3.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=ba12rWbT7Bku1EH3BQj0LA#-XDNBmlylJR58oIQU1kAmA\nThis was good, though nothing super special. My friend's on a no-carb diet and that was the only reason he didn't get a pasta.\n\nPRIMI\n* Pappardelle | Liberty duck sugo. $19 - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=ba12rWbT7Bku1EH3BQj0LA#aMU4ebuLW4IYGIL2-hgRKQ\nVery delicious duck, wonderful flavors. The pappardelle itself was a bit thick, and Delfina definitely tends to cook its pasta al dente whereas I like it a bit softer. Still, very nicely done. I would rate this one higher, but it's such a small dish - my boyfriend was glad we got all those starters.\n\n* Dungeness Crab Risotto | radicchio, basil. $23 - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=pzQK-6pmYK-m9anRtB5t9A#bgfsdimmW0a8hlKBOCcB6Q\nPerfect creamy texture to the risotto! I love that I got to try a different type of pasta here. The crab flavor could stand out a bit more, though to be fair I only tried a bite of my friend's. \n\n* Tripe all Fiorentina. $11 - 4.5 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=ba12rWbT7Bku1EH3BQj0LA#3VWVobpe16A--KCzGz4Hsg\nAnother new dish for me! This was really nice - the tripe was soft, none of that rubbery texture, yet bits of it were crisped, just enough to give each bite enough variety in texture. The flavors are strong, savory - actually kind of similar to the Fagioli all'Uccelletto (so don't just get these 2 dishes, you'll be getting something really similar). \n\nDOLCI: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=pzQK-6pmYK-m9anRtB5t9A#CeYh3S_E8giZNbP-daxeXw\n* Cardamom Panna Cotta | candied Buddha's hand, burnt satsuma caramel. $9 - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=pzQK-6pmYK-m9anRtB5t9A#pzQK-6pmYK-m9anRtB5t9A\nI always love Delfina's panna cotta. It has a rich creamy texture yet is somehow light - you can tell by how it jiggles just the right way on your plate. I wished the cardamom flavor was stronger. The satsuma was interesting - a bit of that slightly bitter orange rind-like flavor, mixed with very sweet caramel. \n\n* Chocolate Bonet | amaretti, sesame honeycomb, crema - 4 stars\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=ba12rWbT7Bku1EH3BQj0LA#Dw9QGsBbswuhq6k1_S4uPg\nA great one to pair with the panna cotta, this one having heavier chocolate-y flavors. The crema had a nice consistent texture, only a slight sweetness too it, the crispy amaretti was great, and the chocolate intense and dark.\n\nDinner menu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/delfina-san-francisco?select=ba12rWbT7Bku1EH3BQj0LA#anmo2lfTaoo9SKYPaTaGQw", "author": "Ziyan C."}

Fregnacce was supposedly a seafood pasta served with Louisiana Gulf Shrimp, and Risotto al Barolo was supposed to be pasta with bone marrow. So, 3 of us went for the Fregnacce and 3 for Risotto al Barolo, and the rest for Spaghetti. We wait another 20min that was supposed to be a mere 10 minutes.\n\nThen, the \"food\" came. If I tell you I have not seen a smaller portion of food you would not believe me. In the Fregnacce that costs $22, I could seriously count the number of pastas in the food and I didn't even need to count the number of shrimp(s?!). There was only one shrimp cut into smaller pieces in the whole plate. Eating each piece of pasta was like stuffing a dollar bill down my throat. I don't know who she could dare to call that seafood.\n\nWell, that was just the Fregnacce. In the Risotto al Barolo that was supposed to have bone marrow, I could not taste anything but the 20 or so shreds of rice.\nAt the end, it turned out their most cost-effective food was the spaghetti. Even that, had a portion that I doubt would fully serve a small child.\n\nNow, after all of this nonsense from the charlatan waitress, when we asked for some bread and butter, they said that's an item on the menu and you would have to pay for them. We just couldn't comprehend waiting more than an hour, spending over $200 on 3 pieces of shrimp, less than an ounce of bone marrow, and small chunks of spaghetti and yet not getting any free sides.\n\nJust a huge shoutout to that waitress with her offensive attitude and this fake Italian restaurant for one of the worst dinners of my life.\n\nI know that this restaurant might be a local favorite, but I can't trust yelp reviews anymore, even though that might sound ironic for you reading this review.", "author": "Nader N."}

While some lingering diners caused us to be seated later than our reservation time, the staff were exceedingly courteous and made up (many times over) for our having to wait. Aside from apologizing several times (and keeping us informed of what was happening with our table), they offered us complimentary glasses of Prosecco and a couple great appetizers: the spiced almonds and the gnocco fritto. It was a thoughtful gesture and the delectable appetizers and wine were a great start to our meal. We shared their regular house salad (Insalata di campo) and a new to the menu chilled Dungeness Crab Salad with fennel and star ruby grapefruit. We shared everything--the portions aren't obsequiously large but certainly lend themselves to sharing pretty easily. Both salads were refreshing but the crab was spectacular--in-season shellfish combined with the sweetly acidic grapefruit, fennel, and red oak lettuce in a delicious way. For our main meals, we thoroughly enjoyed the swordfish with Castelvetrano olives and marinated shallots  (on a bed of delicate lentils), the hanger steak, and sides of fluffy and smooth olive oil mashed potatoes and creamy polenta (substituted for the French fries). Some reviewers have mentioned a heavy hand with the salt but we didn't find that on any of the dishes. Everything was well seasoned and beautifully plated. \n\nAt my request, the waitress recommended a perfect glass of red wine with nice body but not oaky--so nice since I wasn't familiar with some of the by the glass Italian wines. \n\nDessert--we splurged and I'm so glad because this part of the meal I usually skip proved to be a treat. We ordered the dark chocolate budino with Bay laurel gelato, the Meyer lemon semiffreddo with gingerbread cake and dark ale caramel, and the maple panna cotta with pumpkin pur\u00e9e, pomegranate seeds and pumpkin seed brittle. Each was prepared and presented creatively, and the tastes transported our tastebuds to a pretty happy place.\n\nThe service was flawless without being pretentious. \n\nAll in all, this was hands down one of the most enjoyable dining experience I've had recently. Delfina restaurant made for a great birthday dinner for my friend, and the experience there made it a place I'll be sure to return.", "author": "Sharon S."}

Definitely my favourite Italian restaurant in the Bay Area (yet). The pasta is fresh made and cooked just right. We had the spaghetti, the daily special of the pappardelle and the beef cheek cappelletti. \n\nThe spaghetti with red sauce seems so simple but it was flavourful, just a bit spicy and absolutely delicious. The pasta in the pappardelle was so so chewy (I'm a sucker for freshmade pasta) and they gave a lot of duck (although portion size is not big). The beef cheek cappelletti had this really awesome sauce (I couldn't figure out what it was but it was so good) and I would highly recommend. I only wish that I had thought to ask for bread (especially as it's right next to Tartine) so we could soak up the pasta sauce!\n\nWe only had the pasta dishes this time but would definitely return for the entrees.", "author": "Michelle Y."}

I clearly shouldn't be eating pasta, so if if I'm going to have some, then it'd better be worth splitting my pants over.\n\nLuckily, the spaghetti and papardelle with duck sugo were good enough to justify corpulent deformity. And I only say good enough because I have found slightly better versions of both elsewhere - Scarpetta for the former and Cotogna for the latter (with lamb ragu). Nonetheless, these were solid dishes that I'd order again.\n\nIf you're not in a pasta mood, you can do what all the reviews suggest and order the octopus. However, if you want a truly memorable meal, then try the quail and Brussels sprouts. The former was the juiciest I've ever had and the latter was cooked with hazelnuts, rosemary and honey for the most flavorful explosions in my mouth. I kept on eating this despite knowing that my hips were expanding with each mouthful. \n\nBy the end of my meal, I was looking pretty obese and busted. I'll probably never get laid again but I don't mind because I can always come back to allow my lips to fornicate with al dente noodles and juicy meat.", "author": "Suany W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-09-25", "description": "I came here last Saturday with my sister and two of our friends. We called at 8:30pm and the wait was really long, but by the time we got there around 9:30pm, we only had to wait 20 minutes for our table. We went to the bar and each got a glass of wine- I got the Ganouche from Santa Barbara which I didn't love and wouldn't order again.\n\nAtmosphere- very cute restaurant. The outdoor seating is only for the pizzaria, which is separate from the restaurant. Great service! We had the best waiter, Kyle, who was very friendly and chatted with us all night.\n\nDrinks- When we sat down, we ordered a bottle of Chianti, which was delicious. I always love Chianti.\n\nFood- We started with the warm olives, which we actually amazing. 5/5, I would definitely order them again. For the appetizers, we got the caprese salad at the Martin's Escarole salad. Both were very good, I would say 4/5. For our pastas, we REALLY wanted the prosciutto ravioli but they had run out which was so sad. We tried the mint tagliatelle and duck gnocchi (both 3/5. I could tell that the pastas were homemade, but I was a littler underwhelmed. Both were good, but the flavors were kind of weak. I was expecting strong flavors and an amazing taste, since i've heard so much hype about the restaurant. The mint tagiatelle had a good amount of mint, but needed a stronger sauce, like a lemon cream sauce. The gnocchi was pretty good, but the duck was too rubbery. \nAfter that, we were still hungry so we tried the Gnoccho with prosciutto, which was fried dough with prosciutto on top (3/5). It was okay, but the fried dough had air in it, and would have been so much better if there was a marscapone or something else inside. For dessert, we got the Chocolate Caramel Millefoglie, which was also 3/5.\n\nOverall- Our meal was very expensive (since it's a nice restaurant) but I didn't feel like the food was worth the price. If someone really wanted to go there, I would go again, as long as I could order the prosciutto ravioli. On the flip side, I wouldn't pick it as a restaurant to take someone who was visiting.", "author": "Jenna G."}

It's hard to recommend anything on their menu because not only are all the menu items fantastic, but the restaurant changes their menu frequently, surprising their guests with new flavorful experiences.\n\nOn my first trip to Delfina, I sampled the prosciutto and calamari appetizers.   The prosciutto was combined with chestnuts to create a uniquely savory dish while the calamari was not coated in bread and fried like most Italian restaurants, but instead lightly grilled and served with greens for a much cleaner taste that brought out the flavors of the seafood.\n\nMy main coarse was the humble spaghetti.  But for its simplicity, Delfina made the dish with love and care, to the point where I was using the bread to scoop every last bit of sauce on my plate.\n\nIf you don't mind splurging on good food, then Delfina is a must for leaving with a full and happy belly.", "author": "Nadav P."}

Delfina is located in the Mission District and appears to be very popular, as there as a 45 minute wait at 7pm on a Wednesday. Our wait was cut about 15 minutes shorter than expected as we opted to sit at the bar (which was honestly fine). It was well worth it though, as their food is very good. \n\nBoth my boyfriend and I ordered their Spicy Spaghetti (which actually wasn't that spicy). If I remember right, our friend ordered some pasta and chicken dish. For an appetizer we ordered their bread and butter. The food here was delicious! You can't really go wrong with bread and butter and spaghetti, but this place puts it in a whole other league. The spaghetti had just the right amount of spices in it and it tasted wonderful. I'm drooling just thinking about it. The bread was fresh and tasty as well -- apparently the bread is made at a store just around the corner from Delfina, which is great that they buy locally. Everyone in my party seemed to love their food as well all cleaned our plates!\n\nService here was very good. Our server here was very friendly and knowledgeable. I liked her. Prices here are also on the higher side, as our three meals and the appetizer came to close to $100 (and no drinks were even ordered!).

I was expecting something fried, but it was pan seared and definitely felt light. \nSpaghetti: DEFINITELY order this. I thought it was just going to be some random spaghetti dish, with little flavor, but this is amazing. We just ordered a small dish of it. Next time, we're getting more of it. \nTortellini: the english peas that came with this dish were a great light accompaniment to the dish. SO GOOD. \nPappardelle: the small serving of this was definitely not enough for the two of us. Just a tasting which was enough. The pork sugo that came with it was delicious, but the portion just seemed tiny. \nChicken: OMG SO GOOD. the mashed potatoes were delicious (especially the next day). The chicken was beautifully roasted and SO moist! \nPanna cotta: the blueberry basil topping was interesting, probably not my favorite thing of the night, but it was his pick (my pick obviously would have been chocolate related). They even put a candle on it since it was his birthday. \n\nOverall, the service was so on point. Our waitress suggested some great dishes and we ordered them all.

I usually order the Margherita whenever I try new places so that I can compare apples to apples (for the most part). The crust was thin, had enough hold so that when you hold the slice it doesn't fold over. Also the crust had just enough crunch yet it was chewy at the same time. The crust is always a good foundation for a good pie! The sauce had just the right amount of sweetness and the cheese was melted to perfection. I would argue that the pie could have used a bit more cheese. That would be my only complaint if you call that a complaint.  \n\nOverall a good dining experience.

When Greg and I lived in Pac Heights, our last meal in the neighborhood was at Pizzeria Delfina, so naturally, we've always been a fan of their restaurants.  Neither of us had been to Delfina in quite some time, so we made reservations for an early Sunday dinner.  We were seated immediately and took some serious time to peruse the menu and come up with a game plan for dinner.  Here's what we came up with:\n\nAppetizer:\nLa Quercia Prosciutto Americano, Mission Figs & Parmigiano Fricco: WOW this was absolutely amazing.  Both Greg and I are HUGE fans of prosciutto, especially quality selections like this.  Paired with the figs and parmesan, this was a beautiful dish!\n\nPastas:\nGnocchi & Ragu: Funny story about this, exactly the night before, Greg and I attempted to make gnocchi & ragu and it came out fairly mediocre (totally my fault, I burned the sauce).  Naturally, when we saw it on the menu at Delfina, we both sheepishly admitted that we needed a second go at tasting what the real deal is supposed to taste like.  I'm most definitely a hearty pasta kind of person, so this absolutely hit the spot!  The gnocchi were beautiful little pillows of pasta and topped with a rich and hearty ragu sauce.  Bellissimo!\n\nChicken Agnolotti: I couldn't pick a more contrasting pasta dish to the gnocchi than with this agnolotti dish.  The dish had hints of lemon and had a light sauce to go with the delicious pasta.  You could really taste the freshness of this pasta and made for a perfect warm weather dish.  This was one of Greg's favorites for the night.\n\nMain:\nPork Saltimbocca wrapped in Prosciutto: By now we've had a fair amount of food, so in seeing how big this dish was, I was so glad we were sharing it.  The pork was wrapped in the same prosciutto that we had early on for the appetizer and was smothered in a rich sweet sauce.  The dish also came garnished with fried sage and with a side of beautiful and creamy polenta.  One thing we noticed about the dish was that the pork by itself was really salty.  However, when you paired it with the polenta, it balanced itself out.\n\nDessert:\nLemon Budino: One of my rules in going out to dinner is, always look at the dessert menu.  And in this case, I'm so glad we did.  We ordered the lemon budino based on the recommendation from our waitress.  It also came with a delicious side of ice cream, which was amazing!!  I highly recommend ordering dessert :)\n\nWine:\n2011 Produttori del Barbaresco Langhe Nebbiolo: This was a recommendation from our waitress who did an outstanding job finding this based on or parameters (not overly pricey for a Nebbiolo).\n\nAfter dinner, we were completely satisfied (and not uncomfortable).  We determined that even though the city has a ton of nouveau restaurants with complex flavors, Delfina can always be counted on for solid, straightforward and quality food.  We will most definitely be back!", "author": "Lisa I."}

I've been wanting to come to Delfina for awhile, so when, by chance, I was in the mission area on a weekday evening, I persuaded my friends to go on a Italian food adventure with me. We got some bread to share, which was divine! Honestly, when it comes to food, few things in life beats freshly baked delicious bread. I got the pork ragu for entree. The pasta was AMAZING. Alot of places do their pasta \"al dente\", but really they're just undercooked. Delfina does al dente right! I usually love sharing my food with my boyfriend, but this time the pasta was sooooo delicious, I basically licked the plate to finish everything. I finished the meal with the honeydew ice dessert. Overall, the pasta was definitely the highlight. The change their menu from time to time. While I would love to eat that pasta again, I'm also looking forward to trying new dish next time I'm here.

You don't want to be one of the scrublords hanging out on the sidewalk, do you?). Make sure you're going in the right door, as Pizzeria Delfina is right next door. \n\nThe restaurant itself is tightly packed and has a modern vibe. This is definitely a prime spot for date night, but larger groups and families gather here as well. You'll see servers bustling around but don't expect to see much cooking. The kitchen is tucked away near the bathrooms, which are gender neutral.\n\nThe wine list is sizeable but I always stick with the recommended white. The servers are very knowledgeable so don't hesitate to ask questions. Start the meal with Tartine bread and the delicious house-made butter. I suppose you could save the bread for your meal but my companion and I never have the self-restraint. I've had a prosciutto platter with citrus that was quite tasty, but it seemed to be seasonal.\n\nFor main courses, I always get the spaghetti here. It's so good it seriously makes me angry. This is nothing like your memories of overcooked pasta dripping with jarred ragu. Delfina spaghetti is perfectly al dente and infused with rich tomato sauce. (Side note, I tried to make Delfina style spaghetti at home and ended up with an undercooked, sloppy plate of pasta. I guess that's why they're making the big bucks.) Save room for desert as well. Last night I had a dish called Pear Charlotte, but in the past I've had chocolate dishes and gelato and they were all yummy.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend coming to Delfina.

It was Saturday evening, so there was a wait for a table (30 mins for us).  However, the weather was gorgeous and the people-watching was divine, so the 30 mins flew right by.  (Tip: If you're feeling impatient, try finding a seat at Pizzeria Delfina next door, where tables tend to turn over faster.)\n\nAfter we were seated, we began with a round of wine for everyone.  Delfina's wine list is long and impressive, but I stuck to their house Chardonnay, which was excellent.\n\nFor my appetizer, I had the asparagus with poached egg and tonnato.  This was absolutely heavenly.  The asparagus was perfectly tender, and I loved the flavor and texture of runny yolk mixed with the creamy tonnato.  Home run of a dish over here.\n\nFor my main course, I opted for their famous spaghetti.  The pasta itself was cooked nicely, but I thought the sauce could've used some more flavor (maybe fresh herbs?). \n\nWe were tempted to order dessert, but decided to save our collective sweet-teeth for Bi-Rite, which is mere steps away from Delfina.\n\nService was very friendly -- and hilariously flirty.

It's crusty on the outside and soft on the side, pair it with butter, hmmmmmmm!!!!!\n\n--- Celery Root Sformatino: I had no idea what this was. It's basically a soup made up of celery root, but in a flan like state. The flavor is very interesting, not too strong, but nicely paired with raisins and walnuts. You can dip the bread in the sauce too!\n\n--- Spaghetti: It was all I was craving for! Freshly made, chewy, delicious paste with some damn good simple sauce. Nothing fancy, but the sauce was fresh and not overly seasoned.\n\n--- Pork loin: This was their daily special and it BLEW MY MIND. It was subtly seasoned (again, I think this place wins by their perfect balance of seasoning so the ingredients shine) then roasted with the skin on. The skin was crusty, the inside juicy and savory. It was paired with moist fava beans and roasted candied fruits, which balances the savoriness of the pork. I'm not usually a pork fan and am often disappointed by fancy entrees that carry a higher price tag than their worth....but this one completely came through!\n\nOn top of the great food, the service was very good. The hostess was happy to put our stroller away, give us a high chair, and later crayons for coloring. Our waiter was more than happy to serve us and our toddler.

I contacted the restaurant, and received no response.  My review stands.  My wife and I, and another couple had a 5:30 reservation, and we arrived early.  I guess they do this by 'seatings' rather than reservation times.  We were seated half way back in the restaurant (Farina's space).  So the waiter starts at the front of the restaurant and works his way down each table, taking orders, and it took him 1/2 hour to get to the four of us.  Other staff members are standing around, chatting disinterestedly.  So we ordered drinks and warm olives.  THe drinks came 'staggered' - and after another 1/2 hour we asked about the warm olives.  The server was ice cold \"oh I'll check on that\" and 15 minutes, later 8 cold olives appear.  (that's about $1 an olive).  THe guest sommelier came, and we ordered a $120 bottle of wine, and we asked that she send over our server so we could order food.  Ten minutes later, the dgaf server took our order, and mentioned that food comes when it comes.  Two entrees came together.  One came 10 minutes later.  One never arrived.  The topping for the pizza arrived after we finished the pizza.  By the way, the pizza is very skimpy - it's all dough, with about 1 tablespoon of sausage, 10 thin slices of red onion, and a few small pieces of red bell pepper.  Nothing special at all.  So after  2 hours we tried to get the check.  But they hadn't charged us for the wine.  So we politely asked  - and with no apolgies or thanks, she takes the credit card again - and another 1/2 hour goes by as we watch them fumble trying to figure out how to add a bottle of wine to the bill.  Here's the bottom line - dinner for 4, but only 3 entrees, (no apology for the forgotten entree) is $230.  Add the $120 bottle of wine and tax, and they want a 20% tip on a $360 bill - that's another $72 - for surley service.  The pork is way oversalted.  THe pizza is skimpy.  The staff really doesn't care.  Nothing at all to recommend here.", "author": "Abram M."}

When I visited SF in 1999, Delfina had just opened and my friend had become friends with the couple who owned and ran this new restaurant at the time.  They were a sweet couple, and the husband was the chef and the wife the manager.  It was a good combo.  They came and hung out with us and were super friendly. It made a lasting impression that really hasn't been altered after many visits since then, and by many visits I mean many, many since I've never lived more than a block away that entire time!\n\nI was blown away by the quality of the food then as a visitor but more importantly, it has remained that good in my mind even as I adjusted to raised expectations after living here now for eleven years.  They pretty much started the nuevo Italian cuisine movement in SF that has been copycatted so much since then.  Everything, and I mean everything, is really really good.  My standbys have always been their chicken and steak entrees, but whenever I've been in the mood for pasta, their creations don't ever disappoint.\n\nService is nearly impeccable, it's hard for me to think back to a bad experience there.  They're knowledgable about the wines and food without sounding pretentious.  \n\nIt's great to see them continue to do well after all these years, the dining room always full of happy customers and management never lapsing on quality or coasting on their reputation.  This is one of the best of the best and set a bar for the Mission which has rarely been met by many comers and goers the past 15 years.", "author": "Saminda W."}

The service was excellent overall, and a big shot out to Dallas K who graciously pointed out all the vegetarian options on the menu efficiently and who did a great job throughout the entire dinner. We started with the Pamigiano Sformatino with sonoma coast porcinis, which was a creamy, rich, parmigiano custard/flan middle surrounded by perfectly cooked, soft and chewy porcinis in a rich sauce -- it was delicious and paired well with the tartine bread we ordered. We kept our mains simple and straightforward: The spaghetti was a hit yet again with my wife (bringing back childhood memories... so good!) and the tagliatelle with mint and artichokes was wonderful. Overall we had another positive experience here. We would order the pamigiano sformatino again (as well as the bread) and a large serving of the spaghetti -- depending on the other rotating vegetarian pasta, we would probably get that too.", "author": "T K."}

Lucky for us, our table was already open and we got seated right away.\n\nWe must have been a pretty annoying table, because we had a lot of trouble deciding on our orders, and my mom had a fair share of special requests to the kitchen. Our server, Molly, was amazing. She was attentive, knowledgeable, and took our dithering and requesting with grace.\n\nFor the price, I'd rate the food an average value, not an great one. Like, it's very good--no question--but nothing really blew me away. As far as the appetizers, I actually really enjoyed the gnoccho fritto and prosciutto: it's basically little puffs of fried dough topped with prosciutto, which doesn't sound that impressive, but it was definitely greater than the sum of its parts. My entree was the beef cheek cappellietti, which was flavorful, if a bit salty; I probably wouldn't get it again. The brussels sprouts were very good, and I don't even like brussels sprouts.\n\nBefore I finish, I'll just reiterate that I was really impressed by the quality of the service, and give one more shout out to Molly.

The squash risotto was cooked perfectly and the creaminess of the sauce and subtle puree of the squash made it very smooth and full of flavor. The spaghetti was cooked well however the tomato sauce was a little tart, but when adding some crushed red pepper it balanced out the flavors.  For starters the roasted brussel sprouts with a balsamic reduction & hazelnuts was executed really well; the sprouts still had some firmness and the reduction was very well balanced. The Mahi entr\u00e9e with Meyer lemon saut\u00e9, roasted fennel and fava beans was a great sharing dish. The Mahi was very tender which is usually not expected for that type of fish. Though the Meyer lemons were a little too aggressive eating them in small portions with the fish was a good pairing. Not a big fan of fennel but the chef was able to temper the licorice flavor. The fava beans were the second best thing on that dish.\n\nService: Really good service and the timing of the dishes were perfect for the amount of food ordered.\n\nAmbiance: Sat in the bar area and it was less hectic then the main dining room; views of the kitchen and bar made it more interesting but overall it was a very lively place.

Made a reservation for 8pm on a Thursday and we were seated promptly. Too bad our waitress had no idea what she was doing. We ordered bread, 2 pasta dishes, and a steak to share. The bread took 30 minutes and me asking twice for it to come out (even though they have it sitting on a counter ready to serve). Call me old fashioned, but if I'm paying $4 for some bread (and also commenting on how hungry I am while ordering it), it should probably come out in less than 10 minutes.\n\nThe pasta was delicious. That part I thoroughly enjoyed. We ordered the spaghetti and gnocchi with ragu and both were outstanding. After we finished our pasta, we waited for the steak. And waited. And waited. Some of the servers kept giving us weird looks, and finally a different waitress gave us the dessert menu. I think they had changed shifts in the middle of our dinner but not given us any notice. Very unprofessional for what was a $50/person dinner.\n\nWe told the waitress we were expecting more food, had a waiter bring us food we didn't order, and waited again. Finally, around 9:45 (our dinner started at 8, mind you), we got our steak, except it was ultra rare, despite having ordered medium rare. Clearly it was forgotten, tossed on the grill and rushed to us in a hurry, basically inedible. By that time we were too tired to cause a fuss, and left the steak mostly uneaten.\n\nOverall: amazing pasta; horrible experience with service.", "author": "Rachel L."}

The scallops are perfectly done, the sauce is rich and inviting and the mashed potatoes are creamy.\nSpaghetti with lobster - the pasta was very fresh-tasting and the lobster was perfectly done\nPanna cota with rhubarb - I don't normally order panna cotta, but the waitress highly recommended it.

We got there right on time, had a beautiful table right by the window, and the ambience and decor of Delfina are absolutely beautiful. When we checked in with the host, I made a quick note with her that it was my boyfriend birthday. I also mentioned it at the time I made the reservation. It was a bit annoying on my part, but it was a special day and I wanted it to go well.\n\nOur server was super personable and gave great recommendations on what to order. We started with the tartine bread which was amazing. My boyfriend had the mint tagiatelle and I had the spaghetti. When the server asked if I wanted parmesan, I clearly said \"none for me, thank you\" and she proceeded to put cheese on my plate! I was so confused and shocked. I don't eat dairy, and when my boyfriend asked if I could get a new plate, she said it would take another 20 minutes. So my boyfriend scooped up the top portion of my spaghetti and ate it. It was just a mess, and clearly a mistake that could have been so easily avoided. However, the spaghetti was the best spaghetti I have ever had in my entire life. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, the sauce had the perfect amount of richness and tartness.\n\nFurthermore, during our entire dinner, our server was nowhere to be seen. He never once came to check how we were going or if we needed anything else. On top of that, no one ever came to clear off the plates. Our plates and utensils from our appetizer crowded the table even when our entrees came out. Nothing was cleared until we were finished with our dinner. We ordered our desserts, and as I mentioned twice already that we had a birthday, when our desserts came out, there was no inclination of birthdays. Yes, I understand that this is an upscale restaurant and I'm not asking for anything free or with a blaring candle on top, but I have never been to a place that doesn't even do something a little extra? Plus I had read reviews that this place was so accommodating for birthdays and really made people feel special with dessert and service. When the host walked by she realized this, and I saw her speak to our server while looking at our table and in half-assed effort, he brought out this disgusting drink for us as a \"birthday treat\" after we were already finished with our entire meals and our dessert.

Wasn't much of a \"salad\". The white bean was a good offset to the calamari which was good...but lacked much flavor. I also didn't enjoy that it felt kind of charred and bitter. \n\n[Primi]\n~Spaghetti: Overall very simple dish with plum tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, and basil. It was tasty and felt like comfort food but didn't have anything special about it.\n~Rosemary Tagliatelle: With a ground hen ragu. Very very good! It was a bit on the salty side but definitely tasty.\n\n[Dessert]\n~Crema di Chocolate: STOLE THE SHOW. It made up for any fault we had with the rest of the meal. It's hard to explain what it was but it felt like a mix of mousse and fudge. The chocolate was such a smooth consistency topped with a cream and served with espresso gelato on the side. Definitely save room to try this!\n\nNot really sure I would keep coming back but overall a good experience. Wish they have the option to order pizza from next door though!", "author": "Alysha F."}

You are delicious are lively with knowledgable wait staff, fantastic food, and a buzzing and authentic SF ambience. I can't believe it took me 4.5 years of living here to enjoy your perfection.  \n\nWe went with a group of 6 last weekend for a wedding anniversary. Definitely make reservations in advance, especially if you have a big group. \n\nThe location is just a block from the renowned Delores park. This area is about as legit as it gets in the city. \n\nBread comes from the best bakery in the world, tartine, which is just a few stores down. Eat it. Just not too much that you can't indulge on everything else - because you'll want to. \n\nThere's a great wine list with a range of prices and our waiter was both passionate and knowledgable about the selection. We picked a Pinot that was great. I can never remember wine!\n\nFor apps we did a peach, prosciutto and toasted Parmesan plate. The combination was filled with items we had observed earlier at the farmer's market and was super fresh and a refreshing mash of flavors. We also got calamari which came with some type of fava bean salad - also good. \n\nFor pasta we picked the gnocchi with a meat sauce. I'd never had this convo before but it was perfect. Every flavor and every bite. \n\nThe entrees were equally brilliant. The chicken is prepped for days and you can feel the love that has gone into it. The pork was juicy and huge. Side of mashed potatoes - I could eat this every day. We also got some sort of steak that I didn't get to but heard it was also fab. Even the fries were perfectly elevated from the norm with crispness and fresh herbs. \n\nFor dessert we got a sampling: rice pudding with fried quinoa and berries, lemon panna cotta, and three types of gelato in an ice cream cake type form. The rice pudding was my favorite but they were all good. \n\nExpensive, but we went all out since it was a celebration and it was worth every penny. \n\nCan't wait to come back soon.", "author": "Aggie N."}

However, we were not greeted by a server for 15 minutes. \n\nWe were told about a couple of specials, but not given much more advice. When it came time to order, we did, and I ordered bread with my Italian meal. I was told - for real - that they were \"out of bread.\" I asked the server to double check on that. She ultimately returned with 1/9 of a loaf of bread (3 tiny pieces) and some butter.\n\n Our waitress was very curt with us, and dare I say it, both rude and cocky.\n\nThe two pastas we ordered didn't taste homemade, and had very little flavor. Specifically, my pasta, with duck, had two tiny pieces of the bird in it and was in a brown flavorless sauce. My dining partner's pasta had a little bit of mint flavor and that was it - no sauce at all. \n\nWe couldn't bear ourselves to stick around for dessert after such a horrid exerience.\n\nWhen the waitress presented our check, she said, \"Don't worry, I only charged you for the butter.\" #facepalm #sheesh #CustomerService101\n\nThis was by far the WORST meal I have ever eaten in San Francisco.

The service was outstanding and our waitress, Katie, was extremely helpful to help us decipher the menu.  Now, on to my favorite part of the night - the food...\n\nStarters:\n  * Warm olives: simply delicious\n  * Brentwood corn sformatino, with mussels, cherry tomatoes, and chilis: This was a recommendation of our waitress and it was very delicious and unique.  The corn sformatino is similar to a souffle or mousse and tasted divine along with the mussels.\n\nMains:\n  * Spaghetti, with plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and peperoncini: Simple, yet absolutely amazing. They make their spaghetti in-house and you will definitely be able to taste its freshness.\n  * Grilled Bodega Bay Albacore, with peperonata and olivada: This fish was tender and tasted great with the olivada (olive tapenade).    \n\nSides (Contorni):\n  * Zucchini Ripieno, with ricotta and squash blossoms: Out of this world. Enough said.\n\nDessert:\n  * Panna Cotta, chamomile infused, with pluots:  Creamy and delicate, as expected.\n  * Chocolate Marquise, chocolate mousse, tuaca (vanilla/citrus liqueur), flourless chocolate cake, espresso, granita:  One of the servers, Jay, recommended this dessert for us to try, and I am SO happy we took his recommendation.  Don't get me wrong, the panna cotta was great, but this chocolate dessert easily takes the cake.  My taste buds could not even fathom how delicious it was.  \n\nOverall, definitely order:\n - the spaghetti\n - the zucchini side\n - the chocolate dessert\n\nCan't wait to go back!\n\nTip: Delfina is constantly changing their menu, so these dishes might not be served exactly how I describe them.

Apparently, they only take reservations for up to 6 people and since we had 6 adults + 1 toddler, the staff advised that they needed manager approval.  A couple days later, she called me back to inform me that the manager approved.  I hoped so as it's only an extra toddler!  \n\nWe had an early dinner seating for 5PM.  The place was very casual and not very big.  For starters, we had the Grilled Calamari Salad along with a salad with porcini mushrooms.  The grilled calamari with white bean ragout was tasty, but the salad with porcini mushrooms was simple, nothing fancy.\n\nFor dinner, most of us ended up ordering pasta.  I decided to try their famous spaghetti.  It was perfect portion for me although quite small compared to other restaurants.  Since their spaghetti is cooked in the sauce, it reminded me of Japanese style spaghetti.  It was a simple dish as well as there was no protein, but it was good.  Pasta was cooked al dente.  Also, enjoyed the Barbera D'Alba red wine.  \nMy husband had the bigoli, which was pretty good.  \n\nAll in one, it was a decent meal, but not worth it to make another trip from SJ.

I was super apologetic to my friend (and to the hostess) as I'm probably the only Filipino I know who doesn't usually go by Filipino time. You know what? the hostess just smiled and warmly said, \"that's not a problem, in fact, we are ready to serve you\" (do this at A16 and they will give your table away!) \n\nDelfina's menu is filled with so many enticing things and everything is fresh and locally sourced.\n\nWe shared a couple of apps. Their BURRATA is amazing! Served with olive tapenade on crostinis and accompanied by a small arugula salad. The GRILLED CALAMARI with warm white bean salad is also a good choice. The smokiness of the calamari goes well with the soft creamy beans. Not a fancy dish, but even humble beans taste excellent when presented this way.\n\nOn to the Pasta. Oh THE pasta! SPQR does great pasta. Delfina does it even better. Their PORK SUGO PAPPARDELLE is made with love and isn't always on the menu. I guess I got lucky the night I came in! Wide ribbons of al dente pasta with meaty, savory braised pork, perfectly seasoned and doesn't even need additional parmiggiano or anything like that. If you love Italian food like I do, you absolutely have to sample their pasta. \n\nMy only complaint is that the portions are not that big, so order up on the appetizers or if you look at it from my point of view, you'll have plenty of room for dessert.

You should be prepared to wait; you are not the only person in the world. We had a very nice server who poured the wine and asked about everything. \n\nThere is a pizza restaurant directly next to the main one, and the pizza looks incredible. You can see it as you walk by; I'm excited to try it sometime. \n\nGood food is subjective. You can have the ripest, juiciest peach in the world, but there will always be someone who doesn't like peaches. Because of that, I'm not saying the food here is bad, and I'm going to make this as objective as possible. First off, let me say the brussel sprout appetizer was delicious, and we were very happy with it! I ordered a fettuccine with mushroom. The noodles were done to my liking, but there was nothing stellar about the dish overall. It was dry, and there wasn't much flavor to the sauce which was a like a butter or cream; I couldn't really tell because there was so little. There was hardly any mushroom in the dish either, so that was disappointing. My other complaint about this restaurant is the portions for the price. We sat near the kitchen and saw every dish coming out and they were so small. I understand small portions are good if the quality of the food is spectacular, but it just wasn't. It was just a small mound of noodles, and plain sauce with a little mushroom for close to or just over 20$ (I can't quite remember the exact price.) My friend felt the same about his pasta dish. \n\nPerhaps the owners are overwhelmed with the amount of people pouring in here and the menu constantly needing to be changed that they don't really have time to perfect the recipes for every dish.", "author": "Alexandres M."}

There was nothing special about the skirt steak or the fries that accompanied it.  Of the meats, the chicken was the best.  If we came back, I'd stick with pastas and not bother with meats at all.", "author": "Amelia S."}

Friendly and as fast as quality can allow, Delfina's would be comfortable for a large party and was more than enough for my party of two. Star Granted.\n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nMake no mistake, while it's not suit and tie, Delfina's non-pizzeria is classy, so you can expect to pay classy prices. I didn't take a pic, but my Berkshire Pork Arrosto was $25. However, these prices were offset by fairly priced sides and wines. All in all: fair. Star Granted.\n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nGood but not great. The pork atop my risotto was generously portioned, but it turned out a decent amount of that portion was fat, which was disappointing. From there, the risotto was soaked in butter, and the Olive Oil Mashed Potatoes were soaked in salt and olive oil. Still enjoyable yes, but I can see why the pizza at the pizzeria next door gets all the attention.

I got the Roasted Fulton Valley Chicken(?) with mushrooms and olive mashed potatoes, and had the profiteroles w/espresso gelato for dessert.

When you find out it is, ask for more.  Think about asking for thirds so you can stuff some in your pocket.  \n\n4)  Grab a glass of wine or refreshing limonata.  \n\n5)  Remember reading a yelp review where she was on a date and complained about how gorgeous the Delfina servers are.  Empathize.  (And even worse, they are impossibly nice too!)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/delfina-san-francisco#hrid:3L0oBhOvIpsB7tzHESMYrg\n\n6)  Try the Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari antipasti ($11).\n\nLike the mix of cool, citrusy greens; olives; warm, soft white beans, and a bit too salty grilled calamari.\n\n7)  Taste the smooth, creamy Artichoke Soup ($10).\n\n8)  Since you are cutting down on carbs in the new year, load up on Pasta and Risotto!\n\nThe Spaghetti with tomatoes, garlic, EVOO, and peperoncini was simple, well prepared comfort food ($13).  Always say yes when offered the option of parmesan on top.  The Risotto Milanese with oxtail sugo and bone marrow was rich with good flavor but unfortunately extremely soupy ($19).\n\n9)  Eat some veggies like the citrusy Chard with lemon and wish-there-was-more-garlic ($8).\n\n10)  Order the Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 which tastes like a warm oozy brownie ($9).\n\n11)  Although you are stuffed, valiantly try the chocolate ganache and pomegranate pates de fruits that come with the check.\n\n12)  Wish everyone a Happy New Year!\n\n----------------\n\nUpdate 1/2014:  Cool video!  http://vimeo.com/82970655", "author": "Amy C."}

The White Truffle Arancini was aromatic; the cheese nicely melts in the mouth.  The Chitarra with Anchovies and Cauliflower was tasty; the breadcrumbs added a nice crunch. The Prosciutto-Mascarpone Ravioli with Lemon Butter was refreshing, and even had somewhat a healthy feel to it...I blame the lemon zest.  I enjoyed their pastas a lot.\n\n1 star off: We ordered the Cioppino which was quite disappointing for $24. The portion was tiny, and consisted of a few tiny and pre-pubescent mussels, clams, shrimp, and sole pieces. After a few spoonfuls, the dish was done. The only thing I liked about the dish was a nicely grilled piece of bread that came with it.\n\n1 star off: For dessert, the Profiteroles were very hard to bite into, and thus difficult to eat with the soft espresso gelato.\n\nI agree with the other Yelpers who say the portions are small.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-25", "description": "So I avoided this place for the longest time because I heard mixed reviews from my friends and the menu never seemed interesting to me maybe because I didn't understand the words they used on there.  I finally came over here 2 nights ago for a quick bite.  When I said I didn't understand the words they use on their menu I meant it.  You should have seen me asking about EVERYTHING.  I was starting to feel a little embarrassed asking so many questions but they were very informative and helpful with a smile the entire time.  Our first server was so knowledgeable! I felt like I needed her like fish needs water. \n\nWith their help, we started off with the Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari served over a bed of white beans.  The calamari itself was such a tender surprise.  The white beans had a stronger presence of a very enjoyable savory touch that did not take away from the delicate freshness of the tender calamari.  A dash of italian parsley infused olive oil brightened up the entire dish like fireworks do the sky with a fragrant hint of herb. I really wish they gave us more calamari! Drools.\n\nThe pasta is a must over here! I asked lots of questions while I was here so yes I had to ask whether or not they made their pasta in-house.  I'm a huge sucker for in-house hands on homemade type of eats!  There's nothing better than handmade... the way it should be.  They didn't disappoint.  Note: If you read my review and want to order their house made pasta there be sure to ask which ones were made in-house because there were a couple of pastas they ordered from elsewhere.\n\nWe had the Tagliatelle with mint, Chanterelle mushrooms, and wild nettles.  Some say Marco Polo introduced the idea of noodles to Italy from China on his travels.  However much of a myth this might be, I can't deny that the Tagliatelle might be the fraternal twin of the Chinese flat egg noodle that you can normally opt for in wonton soups.  The texture of the Tagliatelle compared to the Chinese egg noodle holds a finer more gentle silky bite which we loved!  The mint, while at first thought would be too 'minty' for my tastes, was just the perfect subtlety to highlight the delightful pasta.  Wild nettles, although cannot be consumed raw due to stinging hairs, was more like spinach to go with the dish.  As for the Chanterelle mushrooms, the light earthy aroma and flavor was a wonderful contrast to the Tagliatelle brightly roused by the mint and wild nettles.  We got to experience their amazing pasta because they were able to make a half order for us!  If they didn't we'd have missed this delicious treat!\n\nFor the secondi we had the Bershire Pork Arista over a bed of iacopi butter beans, cipollini agrodolce, and jimmy nardello peppers.  The flavors came so well together that the flavor of the sauce was truly unforgettable.  The cipollini agrodolce (agrocolce is an italian sauce usually sweet and tangy) resonated quite well with the pork giving it a lovely sweet savory note.  The marinated whole cipollinis (a small onion from the bulb of grape hyacinth) itself was flirtatiously sweet which left us in total awe.  The peppers also offered a gentle sweetness to the dish although on a different note bringing a different element to the dish.  The only downside to the pork... It was not as tender as I'd thought, coming from Delfina where so far everything was near perfection to us.  Although on the pork end of things it's hard to compete with NOPA in my books, I don't know how to judge it except to compare it with the best.  Even if it was a different cut perhaps, I think maybe marinating it or brining it better would give it a better result.  I'm no iron chef but I know my personal preferences.  Overall the dish was beautiful in flavors and we love love loved the cipollini onions!\n\nTo end the night on an even sweeter note we shared the Lavender Panna Cotta with blackberries, arctic belle nectarines, and indonesian long pepper.  For a guy that doesn't usually enjoy much dessert, this is a must have!  Such refreshing flavors coming from the berries and chilled nectarine sauce to accompany the light cool silkiness of lavender panna cotta is nothing short of euphoric.  That long pepper added a very pleasant kick to the finish.  \n\nWhat a night!  Considering we were only looking for a quick bite.  Had no idea we were in for such a great experience.  Service was so accommodating and friendly to go with such a delicious meal.  You can bet I did my homework on their menu afterwards.\n\nI do wish they had a better drink menu though.  If you like bubbles grab the Peach-Raspberry Bellini... the gf enjoyed it very much.\n\nWanted to give 4 stars because of the pork and lack of drink options for my tastes but had to go with the 5 for a memorable first and the house made pastas!", "author": "Colin M."}

The snap peas were excellent.  They were the snap peas that I know and love with a nice flavorful oil coating and a splash of mint that really gave the peas a burst of flavor.  As for the bleu cheese lettuce, I was pleasantly surprised to find that I absolutely loved it.  The radishes, onions, the lettuce, and cheese was all displayed in a floral way that made the presentation of the dish itself delightfully pleasing.  As for the taste, it was just as pleasing as the presentation, the bleu cheese and the flavoring blended together in a very nice way with no one overpowering the other.\n\nMoving onto the entrees, we got the quail and, of course, the spaghetti.  The quail was delicious, the bird was whole and cooked to perfection.  It was laid on top of what I can best describe as grits.  It was a bit pricey I do admit, but as a person who loves to eat good food and doesn't mind to spend an extra buck to do so, I do feel that the dish was worth it.  The spaghetti was, as expected, spaghetti... but it was amazing.  There was something in it that made the dish have a slight kick to it and make it ever so spicy.\n\nFor desserts, we got the sweet corn gelato, and the brown sugar panna cotta.  Surprisingly as far as desserts go, they were essentially what I expected.  They were sweet, and a nice way to end a meal.  \n\nThe total for my meal came out to be about $100, but for an anniversary and at a restaurant with $$$, it was something that I had expected to happen.\n\nOverall, the meal was great, the atmosphere was wondering, the service was one of the better ones I've experienced, and if I weren't a student who is currently worse than broke (got loans and debt man) I would be willing to come here more often.", "author": "Dong S."}

The food and service were good, a well known SF chef was sitting two tables away and I was having a fun time on my date.  However, I didn't leave with a great sense of urgency to return, although there was nothing specific about my visit to cause this.  Many years later, after walking by the restaurant many times between visits to Bi-Rite and Tartine, I had a great urge to give Delfina another try.\n\nOn a warm and sunny Saturday evening, we had reservations for an early dinner. Given the crowd of people waiting outside, I'm glad that we had a table inside.  We started with glasses of the Blood Orange Bellini.  A quick look around the room told me that I wasn't the only one that was enjoying this bubbly and refreshing cocktail.  \n\nWe decided to try two of their three antipasti specials that night, the beef cheeks (it turned out to be beef tongue) and crudo of fish (halibut?).  They  were both well seasoned, well prepared and nice, light starters to our meal.  For the main course I chose the roasted pork shoulder over farro.  I love pork and I love farro.  When it comes in a wonderful sauce to marry the two, it's a match made in heaven.  The portion size was rather healthy and there was more than enough to share, which I gladly did.  My friend ordered one of the filled pastas (agnolotti, I think) that came with the most wonderful sauce, a sauce that was begging for bread to sop up all that goodness.   Bread doesn't come automatically with the meal, but if the request for it is made, they will gladly provide it.  You'll want to ask for it.  Trust.\n\nFor dessert, we split the citrus panna cotta.  This is one of my favorite desserts, and the version served here is one of the best interpretations - light, creamy, smooth with intense citrus flavor.  It was very refreshing and a nice way to end the meal on a warm spring evening.  I started and ended my meal with wonderful citrus flavors.\n\nOur server was helpful and friendly.

I remember the menu being a bit intimidating, with few words in English, but our server was more than helpful. I remember my date joking that the only words we recognized were \"Cali style.\" Plates are small enough to share and as I recall, we had 2 starters and an entree, plus dessert. On that night, I recall ordering a wild boar sausage, a crostini platter of sorts (crostini misti?) and some sort of main dish (can't for the life of me recall)...and then when it came time for dessert, after looking around at tables next to us, we THOUGHT we ordered one dish, but were surprised (although ended up to be pleasantly) with what we received. Again, not a ton of recognizable words on the menu, but the server was more than helpful and I doubt you'd go wrong with any dish.\n\nMy second and most recent visit was this past Valentine's Day, a Friday, at 9:30 pm. My boyfriend, having remembered that as our first date spot (awwwwww), made reservations about a month in advance and we still had somewhat of a late dinner. Reserve early people!\n\nFirst, I have to give a TON of props to our server, who was dealing with an extremely intoxicated woman at the table next to us. This woman became upset when the restaurant did not offer her an iPhone charger, and even went as far as to ask the server if she could go to the sister restaurant next door to see if THEY had a spare charger. Our server, however, was nothing but tactful and respectful to the customer, which was really admirable. Also bonus points for recommending a bottle of white  that we really enjoyed.\n\nNow, onto the most important part, THE FOOD! This time, we ordered three savory dishes to share, and then dessert. The grilled octopus we shared to start was delightful and a nice and light way to begin the night. We then moved on to the hay & straw pasta, which reminded me of a delicious carbonara, with more refined flavors, like the addition of green garlic.  We also shared a main dish, which I believe featured pork? They also had a fresh spaghetti with crab on the menu that night, but by the time we were seated, they had unfortunately run out of the fresh made noodles.\n\nOn a Saturday night at peak hours, tables are super close together, it does feel a bit busy and the servers are spread a bit thin, but all the better if you are hoping to get cozy & spend some quality time with whoever is sitting across the table.", "author": "Laura H."}

Both were superb. We then shared side of leeks which was also amazing - I'd never actually just eaten leaks on their own, but oh man, yum! For my main course I ordered the winter squash tortelli - which are basically tortellini. Sweet squash pasta in brown butter with poppy seeds. So delicious! However, be aware that the pasta servings are quite small. My friend and her mom ordered a large portion of the spaghetti to share - I thought it sounded boring but I tasted a bite and it was actually quite tasty. House made pasta and house made sauce will do that I guess. \n\nThe \"parents\" paid the bill and I don't even want to know how much it was :) The other downside to this place is it's a bit too popular. We had a reservation at 9:30pm for dinner (because we couldn't get one earlier) and we didn't end up getting seated until closer to 10:00. It's a pretty small space and they squeeze a lot of people in, so it's cramped and also very noisy. When the waiter was explaining the menu I couldn't hear half of what he's saying. But as long as your most important concern is the food, then Delfina is definitely worth a try.", "author": "Lindsey B."}

At 6:19 I missed a phone call and by 6:22 back at the restaurant we learned that our table had been given away to another group that showed up \"since another table finished and someone else came\" despite having made a reservation.

If I could give it more that five stars, I definitely would.  \n\nI also want to say that we had one of the most attentive, sweet and incredibly knowledgeable bartenders / servers.

PERFECT.  And it was paired perfectly with our meal.\n\n2)  You cannot come here without getting the anchovies.  I know.  It's a weird thing to promote, but they were AMAZING.  So good.\n\n3)  The bread.  Made from Tartine next door.  I probably ate four loafs to my head.  It was great.\n\n4)  The little gem salad.  Acidy.  Perfect.\n\n5)  The calamari.  If I had to choose, this was probably the dish that I like the least.  It was slightly overcooked and charred at one end, but it's just a preference that I don't like my squid to be burnt or bbq'd.\n\nThe only down-side to this restaurant that it is fairly expensive.

His original intention was for us to go to Pizzeria Delfina, but he realized he referred to the wrong place too late.\n\nThe 6 of us are incredibly indecisive so whenever we eat together, we order a whole bunch of stuff.  That night, we started with 5 appetizers.  The Crispy black eyed peas were crispy, buttery, but too small to pick up with fingers or a fork.  The Grilled Monterey calamari was not what we expected (where were the rings?).  I especially liked the contrast between the warm white beans & the crisp lemony greens  I can't comment on the olives but they were gone quick.  The Oil cured anchovies were so good & had just the right bit of \"fishy.\"  Finally, the Fresh mozzarella.  The texture was completely different than other \"fresh\" mozzarella I've had; the heirloom tomatoes were soooo sweet.\n\nFor main, I had the Pappardelle which had great texture but was slightly too salty.  Also, I wish the gamey taste of the duck could have stood out more.  The Boyfriend got the roasted Mary's chicken which was moist with crispy skin.  It came with a mountain of mashed potatoes that was addicting.  The rest of our party either had the Meyer Ranch hanger steak or the Ahi tuna; both were very well received.\n\nHow could we not end with dessert?  Thy Boyfriend & I split some Profiteroles which were not as fluffy as I thought they'd be.  The bitter sweet fonduta (fancy word for chocolate sauce) was a little acidic which was great  for cutting the richness of the espresso gelato.  The gelato, oh the gelato; it was F'in good!  It was intensely coffee with a hint of bitterness; it was like someone took fresh espresso & froze it.\n\nThe food was delicious & the service was great, but I do have 1 thing that made my experience not 5-star.  We had split our bill (~$400 before tip) in the following manner: $100 cash and the remainder split evenly between 2 credit cards (so $150 each).  The waitress was super nice about it & did it just right.  But for some reason, when I checked my credit card bill a few days later, I saw that I got charge the full $300!  The matter was quickly resolved with my bank but I am quite disappointed that a mistake (I hope that's what it was) like this could happen @ an established like this one.", "author": "Karen S."}

I'm all for spending good money on good food - but for what it is, this place is over-priced.  Service was meh - our server was nice enough, but we had to actually ask for bread (after our apps had already arrived -- and I could have sworn the other tables all got bread).\n\nBrussel sprouts - these were decent, but nothing to write home about\n\nGrilled calamari salad - teeny tiny squid (I feel like our table got shafted when I saw the plump one sitting on my neighbor's plate), but nicely seasoned salad\n\nSpaghetti - thought this was a no-brainer since everyone seemed to rave about this dish.  I honestly don't get the hype.  Yes, the pasta is al dente, but I thought the sauce was only OK.  I've definitely had better. \n\nParpardelle with liberty duck ragu - I think I really would have loved this dish had it not been over-salted.  And I found the duck to be... stringy?!  \n\nBerkshire pork arrosto - probably my favorite of the night.  Pork was tender, flavors were good, but alas, also too salty!\n\nHanger steak with fries - not too bad, but over-charred.  My mom had to cut away the crust. Fries were serviceable.  \n\nMaybe I came in with impossible expectations or maybe I've been spoiled by the plethora of great Italian places in NY... but I definitely won't be coming back.  \n\nThanks, but no thanks, Delfina!", "author": "Jessica H."}

The spaghetti in particular is a true stand-out -- the sauce was a surprise, fresh and bright, and well-seasoned, with just a hint of heat, and the pasta was slurpably toothsome. You'd think spaghetti would be boring or played-out, but trust me, it's worth experiencing. The calamari with beans was also very good -- the white beans were sweet and creamy, and the calamari was tender and scrumptious. The wine program was complementary and not overburdened by \"look at me\" schlock.

So I thought I would go in and give this place a taste. When I first arrived they didn't seem too busy but hostess seemed occupied and was sort of rude. She told us it would be a ten minute wait, which turned into 45 minutes. After we got our table and were seated and we waited about another 20 minutes for someone to come up to our table and take are drink orders. I ordered water and when the water was brought out it was warm so I asked for a cup of ice and the waiter rolled his eyes at me and walked away. I was dumbfounded by this because I thought having a cold beverage was a norm. So the services by this point to me was awful. I tried to stay positive because I was there for the food not the  service. \n\nWhen we finally received our food, which was very costly. The food portions were very small the steak $30 (only received about 5 thin slices), ordered $18 spaghetti (large portion was not large at all) and the $26 chicken (very little flavor).

I find it rather hard to believe.\nWell, let me premise this update by stating that I literally live around the corner from Delfina and I must pass this place at least once a day. Even so, I have not been here in approximately 8 years. And for good reason!!! Which I'll vividly explain in the next few paragraphs.\n\nMy friend Bernie wanted to go and since he scored the rezzy's, I thought...why not? It's been a while. What's there to lose? \nLike I said earlier, I had not been to Delfina in quite a while. Neither had Bernie and this dearth is due to my last couple of experiences (I have only been 3 times). \nOnce I entered the front door I was reminded why I do not frequent this \"reputable\" establishment. \nI was led to our table (Bernie was already seated) and showed to my seat. Can I just say that the tables are very close together. So close in fact that our neighbors were pretty much dining with us at the same table. SERIOUSLY,  a mere 2-3 inches apart at most. I'm not exaggerating.\nFucking highly uncomfortable!!! \nIt made me think that the owners are trying to squeeze as much as they can out of their patrons. Get a larger restaurant for Christ's sake!!! It's high time for you guys to grow up and invest in larger quarters. Or thin out the patronage. Stop over-crowding the joint! CHEAP!!!\nI felt like one of those chickens you see on one of those TV magazine shows where the reporter goes under cover to expose the inhumane treatment of 20 chickens to one small cage and they've all hen-pecked each others eyes out because they hate each other due to such close quarters.\nI'm assuming that one of the ladies sitting next to us was having a fantastic time because her gesticulations (which were quite chickenesque) almost took Bernie's eye out a couple of times. No joke! And just like those cramped chickens...I hated her!\n\nBut I have to say, what was even more annoying then the overly cramped quarters was the condescendingly cavalier, almost haughty attitude of our server/waitress. Really lady? Really? You work at a fucking restaurant, you are not this international dignitary with some huge responsibility to humanity. Come off of yourself! Your a waitress. Start waiting already.\nBy the time she finally waltzed over to our table (about 10 minutes after I was seated) to grace us with her presence, we were ready to order our apps, entr\u00e9e and wine. She insisted on telling us what the specials of the night were, of which we had no interest because we were annoyed and hungry.\nWe ordered our meal and also ordered some bread as well. We were told it was going to be $4.00 for \"The Bread Service\" to which we agreed. It was explained that Delfina had recently refined their \"Bread Service\", which entailed hand-churned Buffalo butter and hand-wrought bread from The World Famous Tartine Bakery. Wow!!! How lucky for us!!! Can I just say that is one of the most pretentious things I've ever heard in my fucking life! \nAnd I've lived in SF for the past 18 years. So you'd think that I've heard some pretty God Damned pretentious shit during my stint here. \nBREAD SERVICE? REALLY? \nOK Delfina...if you say so.\nWhen we finally received our bread, which frankly took another 7 minutes. I have to say that the bread was very good. I can honestly say that it was the best part of the entire meal.\nWas it worth the wait and the price...not sure? But it did hit the spot. \n\nNow as for the rest of the meal, I was not as pleased. It was not horrible. It was ok. Not great. Just ok. \nI was disappointed with my salad (Green Goddess??? cant quite remember the name). There was hardly any blue cheese in the dressing. The blue cheese was the only reason why I ordered this salad in the first place and there was only a few flecks of it scattered amongst the greens. That irked me a little. Once again it seemed cheap.\nI would have complained about the lack of blue cheese and ordered a side or something but our server was NEVER AROUND!!!\nAs for my entr\u00e9e, I ordered the Rabbit and I have to say this was overly salty and I love salt!!! \nI wish I could have told the waitress about the excess of salt in the Rabbit but she was NEVER AROUND and when she finally came back to hand us the desert menus she never asked us if we needed anything or if we enjoyed our meals. She assumed that we were having the times of our lives. And why would she assume this? Because she was NEVER AROUND!!!\nShe just floated above and beyond us like a casually, inconsiderate fart.  \nThe service STINKS!!!!\n\nI'll not be coming back anytime soon. Maybe in another 8 years. Every time I walk past this restaurant and I walk past daily. It will leave a bad taste in my mouth.\n\nDelfina...get it together. \nYour are the predecessor of what has turned this town into the offhandedly, arrogant city it now is. You have set this standard of smugness that now permeates the dining culture that you helped spawn.\nYou've turned SF into a mall.", "author": "Gabe T."}

It was so tender and not bitter at all. Plus it was doused in a tangy, creamy sauce.\n- Vegetable Fritto Misto: Essentially vegetable tempura. No complaints here. It comes with an aioli sauce, but I ended up dipping it in the sauce that accompanied the asparagus. Way tastier.\n- Spaghetti: Such a simple dish, yet most places get it wrong. Not Delfina! Who knew \"plain\" spaghetti could taste so good? Noodles are cooked perfectly al dente and the sauce is divine.\n- Chicken Agnolotti: Rich, succulent bites of mini ravioli encrusted in some kind of crunchy deliciousness, with a lemon-chive aftertaste. I didn't even get what I was eating but it was so good.\n- Rosemary Tagliatelle (aka Duck Ragu): By far our favorite!!!!!!!!!!! We ordered this upon the enthused recommendations of other Yelpers.

We thought the Grilled Monterey Bay Calamari was overly burnt and bitter and the white bean salad couldn't make it up for it. It actually wasn't much of a salad. \n\nThis place would have gotten 3 stars if it were not for the dessert.

I was in the mood for Italian/american food and he suggested Delfine because he had seen a few good reviews.\n\nReservation:\nNot bad, we were able to reserve a table an hour in advance.\nI called at 9pm and made a reservation for 10:30pm.\n\nParking:\nIt was Saturday, parking was a pain, took about 30 mins to find parking close enough.\nWeekday goers may have better luck here.\n\nArriving early:\nBetter not arrive too early here, there isn't a place to wait, you are just in the way and uncomfortably shifting back and forth so that people can manuver past you. Or you will end up waiting outside or in your car.\nWe were about 15 mins early standing inside fore about 2 mins and then waited in the cold for the remainder.\n\nBeing seated:\n10:30 finally rolls around we walk in at 10:31,  our table wasn't ready. \nHowever, I did appreciate the staff cleaning our table and seats thoroughly before seating us. It was almost 10:40 when we finally sat.\n\nAtmosphere: \nVery clean and modern. \n\nI found it wierd that we had to ask for bread while we were waiting for our order to be taken. We were starved after waiting an hour and 40 mins just to try this place.\n\nFood:\nI ordered Polenta. To hold me over before my Spaghetti arrived. My bf had the Soft Shell Crab appetizer and Linguine entre'.\n\nThe polenta was ok it was plain with just cheese and butter and was the consistency of mashed potatoes.  Not the best, just ok. And I was provided with and other foods sauces or ingredients to eat it with until I requested bread.\n\nThe spaghetti was lackluster,  smelled great, but it was insult to all the great spaghetti I'd ever tasted. No sauce or tamatoe/marinara flavor. Basically a salt butter noodle dish.\n\nThe soft crab was disgusting.\n\nThe linguine tasted harshly similar to the spaghetti,  salty and buttery. I guess some people like that, but honestly the salt taste is overwhelming. \n\nAt the end of dinner we were both dissatisfied and couldn't swallow enough chunks of salt to finish our meal. The only thing we finished was the polenta. We ended up having to eat somewhere else afterwards.", "author": "Demi W."}

Considered by some to be the best California Italian restaurant in a city sporting the likes of Spruce, Flour + Water, SPQR, and more it came as no surprise that the bustling Mission restaurant was filled to capacity on our arrival and opting to visit the restaurant on a whim we luckily nabbed the last two seats at the bar where we were placed under the care of a young woman named Kari who offered a few suggestions, and later a complimentary glass of honey sweet Monebazillac to go with dessert.  Having both already enjoyed an earlier dinner but wanting to experience a representative sample of the menu the decision was made to order one side, one pasta, and one 'main' before dessert and with the choices left in my hand I let personal biases guide me into a rustic trio of cheesy toothsome polenta, tender pasta ribbons with gamy duck tamed by bright, balanced tomato sauce, and finally a bowl of tripe in aromatic San Marzanos, some tender and others pan fried to crisp.  Delicious but certainly not 'light,' dessert would consist of an airy sponge cake topped with light Meyer Lemon gel dubbed a budino positioned alongside typically perfect California Strawberries, creamy gelato, and a touch of basil - a delicate dessert to end a great evening and one of many reasons a return visit to Delfina for a better sampling of the menu is planned for the not so distant future.", "author": "Michael U."}

The place was packed even on a Wednesday night. There were only a few bar seats left at 8:30pm. \n\nI ordered the duck ragu pasta, and I have to say that Barbacco (sister to Perbacco) in FiDi still wins. You could tell that the pasta was hand-rolled at Delfina, which was a nice touch, but I thought it was cooked a bit too al dente for my taste. The tomato ragu sauce was also good, but not great. We also ordered the white sea bass which had a olive compote on top. They didn't mention the olives in the menu, which would have been a good tip for those that aren't a big fan of olives. It was a good use of olives though, and went well with the fish. The fish was just slightly undercooked, so it still had a bit of a gooey center. \n\nThe best part was the veggie misto appetizer, which were vegetables fried in a light batter and salted perfectly to taste. So light, crispy, and savory -- I wish this dish came with more; I could eat a whole bowl of these! \n\nThe dessert of poached peaches was probably the biggest letdown, just because the presentation wasn't very appetizing at all. The peaches were fanned out in slices with a heavy white sauce poured all over them -- marring the beauty of the fruit itself. The poached flavor also wasn't very apparent, as the flavor wasn't very different from a normal peach. I've definitely had better poached fruit -- even the poached pear at Unicorn was better than this! If I came back, I'd definitely go with the other Yelp recommendations of panna cotta or TCHO chocolate cake. \n\nThe restaurant was also extremely noisy and the tables were squeezed so tightly together that you could pretty much hear the conversation of the table next to you. Awkward since it seemed that there were several couples on dates. Not a good place to go if you need your privacy or want to carry out a decent conversation.", "author": "Audrey L."}

Strongly recommended as this is a popular restaurant and on the small side.  Street parking in front and virtually no waiting room inside.  Seating is a bit tight and cramped.  Ambiance that night was moderately loud and jovial.  We all needed to speak up a little to hear each other but at the same time I didn't feel that those near us could hear our conversation despite how closely we were seated.\n\nTried my first pappardelle dish with duck.  Pappardelle is a wide noodle.  It was SO tasty.  The noodles were perfectly al dente which I totally love and appreciate.  I'm not big on duck, usually tastes too gamey for me.  But love trying new dishes anyway and gave this noodle duck dish a chance.  The duck was tender and moist and not gamey.  Chicken liver antipasta dish had really small portions but was so tender and flavorful that I would still order it again.\n\nThe restaurant was packed to full capacity while we dined and our food took quite awhile to come out.  Different servers kept stopping by our table to let us know our orders were still on the way and it would just be some more minutes.  More minutes later they would repeat the same, and again.  It was a long wait for our food.  Service could have been better.  Though I appreciate their frequent updates as we grew tired, hungry, and weary it would have been better if their updates were more accurate and the overall wait was not so long for our appetizers and entrees.  We also had to ask for bread.

He had been here before and thought it was good. It's pretty nice considering it's in The Mission, my normal stop for cheap drinks and eats. However, it was really cramped. We went here on a Tuesday night to avoid the bad crowds, but it was still definitely crowded, since it's so popular. We were seated between two other couples - one guy trying so hard to woo a girl on his first date by bragging about himself the whole time; the other couple next to us was in a fight or something. This is not really held against the restaurant, but I did not like how close I was seated to these people to know everything going on between them. The ambiance wasn't really ideal.\n\nMoving on to the food. The only thing we thought was excellent was the spaghetti and the ragu sauce on one of our dishes (not the actual dish itself). I could have eaten those all the time. The things I remember not being enthusiastic about to say the least were the appetizer and the dessert. We had some kind of shrimp dish (with the eyes and shell still on) and it was just whatever tasting. The dessert we had was the panna cotta and I wasn't a fan. I was upset too because I had heard rave things about theirs. Oh well. \n\nIf you come here (and don't mind the crowd or the pretentious atmosphere), get the spaghetti. You won't regret it.", "author": "Kelly B."}

The staples that are always on the menu -- grilled calamari, spaghetti with tomato and pepperoncino, the roasted chicken and the steak frites, the panna cotta -- are delicious and reliable. (Also the Tartine bread, which you can get by request.) But there are other specialties that come and go with the seasons and that I squeal with delight if I find on the menu when I visit: carpaccio of beef or tuna, any kind of sformatino, the rosemary or mint tagliatelle, any kind of agnolotti, the grilled quail and, once, a veal breast. I've also really enjoyed their special regional dinners and winemaker dinners. Servers make great wine suggestions, and my knowledge of Italian wine has greatly improved (from a starting point of pretty much zero). \n\nYes, it's an urban restaurant: it's loud; there's no parking lot; the service is friendly but occasionally it can take a while to get someone's attention. (This last issue has gotten slightly worse since the owners opened sister restaurant Locanda.) But I don't mind. Delfina is in a class by itself.", "author": "Razer R."}

Tartine bread, no less! It was one of the draws to the restaurant. \n\nI noticed on my most recent visit (where I was once again bringing a friend from out of town) that they've stopped offering bread and butter for free and now charge for it as a menu item. Okay, that's fine, it's around $4. \n\nWe enjoyed our bread but the butter ran out about halfway through. We asked for some more and a restaurant manager type person (he didn't look like a waiter) comes over and says they have to charge 2.50 for a second helping of butter. \n\nMy friend and I exchanged incredulous looks. Something that used to be free was now $6.50? And the fact that it wasn't our waiter who conveyed the news, but rather some management type guy made it sound even more ridiculous. As if this was some piece of serious news that needed to be conveyed by upper management. We had a whole lot of bread left so we decided to BUY a second round of BUTTER for the table. \n\nIt made everything else taste less good. I felt so bad because I had been hyping this up as my favorite restaurant to my friend for ages. And now in the middle of our pretty expensive meal, we're getting scolded by a manager about how more butter will cost more money? It killed the vibe.\n\nWhen we were settling up, I overheard the next table over giving their waiter a piece of their mind over the same issue. Something along the lines of \"now you're nickle and diming me over Butter??\". \n\nWe left and I kept apologizing to my friend while we walked away.", "author": "Minna C."}

My dining companion and I happened upon this place during my trip to SF and decided to go in because it looked and smelled promising.  Though it was a Monday evening, the place was packed.  Luckily, there were two bar seats, which we grabbed quickly (the wait for a table was about 30-45 mins).  \n\nFirst, the wine selection: excellent.  I had a glass of prosecco, which turned out to be head and shoulders better than average.  My companion had a glass of pinot blanc, which was absolutely delicious, especially with the food we ordered.\n\nThe food: superb.  We ordered calamari, chicory salad, rock fish pasta, and seafood stew, and all of them tasted fresh and flavorful.  The home-made pasta was so perfectly done that my companion raved about it for days. The grilled calamari was both delicate in texture and umami in flavor.  The seafood stew had such complex flavors from all the spices in the sauce, which was so beautifully balanced.  The dessert was a delightfully light and sumptuous torta, equally well-balanced and delicate in flavor.  \n\nOne caution.  The restaurant, which reminded me of many wonderful NYC restaurants, is very, very packed and the aisles are narrow. There is little space between tables, and the traffic must be negotiated carefully.  I had a few narrow-misses every time a server walked by my seat at the bar carrying a full plate or glass.  In fact, I heard two crashes (glasses breaking, etc.) behind my back while eating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-06-15", "description": "In a nutshell: notably underwhelming food, notably high prices, friendly but flawed  service. And of course a hip scene and yuppified crowd which isn't a bad thing in it's own right, but when the other elements don't measure up, you ashamedly realize that you've just joined the hipsters in their brainless herd pursuit of cool at any price. \n\nThe details: No axe to grind at all. Many of the elements of our experience were wonderful but the basics just don't add up. To me, the basics of a dining experience are very simple: Food, service, ambiance, price. See below. \n\nFOOD - 1 STAR. I ordered the lamb off the Secondi menu (one of the most expensive on the menu). In a word, it was inedible. Tough and chewy. It's embarrassing when you bite into something so chewy, you can't really swallow it so you have to put it out into your napkin hoping your date won't notice.\n\nMy girfriend ordered the rock cod dish for $27. I didn't try it but she didn't like it. She felt it was bland and bit small for the price. We also ordered the carrots but they never came out. When we notified our server, she apologized and offered to get them but it was the end of dinner so we asked to have them removed from our bill instead.\n\nSERVICE - 2.5 STARS. Hostesses were great. Our server was friendly. The runners brought one dish to our table by accident and had to reroute it to another table. And of course our carrots never came, I guessing they suffered the same fate but whoever got them for free didn't bother to say anything.\n\nAMBIANCE - 4 STARS. It's has a great neighborhood restaurant feel combined with the bustling vibe of San Fran. Lighting, music are all about right for a casual dinner. Crowd is hip and trendy.\n\nPRICE FOR WHAT YOU GET - 2 STARS. This factors all our experiences as described above. Even though it's uber hip and located in an awesome part of town, it's hard to justify the price for what you get. I've dined all over the Mission and for an equally hip and well located spot, you can get much better food at much better prices than at Delfina.

The escarole was great- the greens were light and crispy with none of the other flavors (cheese, hazelnuts, pomegranates, tomatoes) being overly strong.  It was a great blend of flavors.

Reservation is not too hard to make (Thank god they take reservations). \n\nService was always warm and attentive.\n\nAaron, the server is the best. He was so nice to give us extra of those free candies that they serve after you pay your bill, since I told him I love it and asked if they sell those. He just offered me a few extra more since they don't sell them. \n\nWonderful gesture that makes a huge impression on foodie like me, since it tells me that people who work there care about the restaurant enough to treat customers with attention and care.", "author": "Kai Y."}

Had a depth that you don't normally expect from what's essentially a 3-4 ingredient sauce. \n- Hangar steak and fries:  Medium rare that was cooked perfectly.\n- Pork arrosto:  Very savory and aromatic.\n- Lamb loin:  Also cooked perfectly. \n\nBetween 3 people our bill (not including wine) came out to about $170, which is pricey all things considered.", "author": "Julie H."}

And here's why...  \n\nA group of six of us were dining there tonight and by some oversight, the entrees came out at odd intervals.  Immediately, the manager came to the table to apologize, which was very nice and somewhat unexpected, as we hadn't said anything or complained.  Two of us had to wait a bit longer for our meals, but we were with good friends and didn't mind.  In the meantime, they comped the two of us another starter and split it between us, so we wouldn't feel left out.  Very nice touch.  Our entrees arrived shortly thereafter and when we'd all finished, rather than handing us dessert menus, they comped us the entire dessert menu, thanking us for our patience and understanding.  Wow!  That's above and beyond 'above and beyond.'\n\nI really, really enjoyed the meal to begin with and would likely go back to Delfina, but after they handled this minor mix-up so well, I will undoubtedly go back.

You're probably thinking, why become such a debbie downer? Welp, let's just say it all started with a reservation call. Here's how the conversation goes at 3:30pm:\n\nMe: Hi, good afternoon  I would like to make a reservation tonight.\nUnknown woman (possibly host): Sure thing, what time?\nMe: I would say 6:30pm if possible.\n*unknown woman remains silent, checking availability*\nUW: ... Sorry we don't have anything at 6:30pm. But we do have something at 8:00pm.\n*At this point I'm disappointed but give in*\nMe: Sure that sounds fine, you need a name or something?\nUW: Oh well, let me get you down for 8PM and you can cancel anytime if you like?\nMe: Alright sounds good, but do you need a name or anything.\nUW: Nope just walk in around the time and there should be seating.\n\n*fast forward after walking around the city until 8pm with my old friend whom I'm catching up with, and entering restaurant together*\n\nMe: Hello good evening, I called in about 3:30pm for a reservation.\nHost Woman: What's your name?\nMe: ...Ryan\n*HW Checks her list*\nHW: I'm sorry but your name (or notation) of a reservation isn't in our records.\nMe: I called here at 3:30pm and whoever answered said they would have it covered,\nHW: Well unless you provide your name its not a reservation, you're just considered a walk in.\n\nWELL, NO SHIT SHERLOCK. This isn't the first time attending a fine dining establishment and it isn't my last. I felt pretty insulted and frustrated at that point. But we were hungry and we waited forever until we got to eat, so I swallowed my pride and immediately sat down at the counter (no tables available, despite already seeing four of them free up within 10-15 minutes of waiting to take our orders:\n\nWine\n-1 glass of a blend that had the number '72 (could not recall to save the life of me; picture unavailable)\n\nAppetizers\n-1 order of the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YqvoyaNvtoC8N5dA8pD2JA?select=xWM8nE3bqrRowXJkzx05pQ)\n\nSecond Dish\n-1 order of the Pasta Fagioli: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YqvoyaNvtoC8N5dA8pD2JA?select=mF8MZlHC2ZzjKHJrRMXW2g)\n\nMain Entrees\n-1 order of the Roasted Fulton Valley Chicken: w/ mash potatoes (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YqvoyaNvtoC8N5dA8pD2JA?select=unaAk6_nrQhK6FjgNk9ENQ)\n\n-1 order of the Berkshire Pork Spareribs w/ mini cassoulet: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YqvoyaNvtoC8N5dA8pD2JA?select=GFTNai3pZlTMuAkiM7IPXw) and (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YqvoyaNvtoC8N5dA8pD2JA?select=cdtIuGS2gkQmBQOl4odHNw)\n\nDessert\n-1 order of the Buttermilk- Anise Panna Cotta: (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YqvoyaNvtoC8N5dA8pD2JA?select=EyCcPHBZUBUntBsJELIrCA)\n\nLet's start with the wine. It was nice and smooth for a full bodied. It doesn't really feel heavy until you chug the last gulps. The carpaccio had a nice vinaigrette, but there was way too much fennel even for my taste. The flavor profile is complete, but the finish wasn't warm but rather \"anti-climactic.\" The Pasta Fagioli aka The Pasta that is really a soup (term coined by my friend). It was bold flavor (it was thick and rich and had a decent kick of it with a bit more pepper than I expected). \n\nThe pork ribs were succulent, but didn't come off the bone as well as I expected. They were a bit too salty for me. The chicken was the better choice,  balanced seasoning, crispy chicken skin and moist white meat underneath. As for the Panna Cotta, it was excellent. Jiggled like a woman's breast, sweet and creamy all around, with a bit of tang on the side. Got a bit more star anise, but Harmony our respectful waitress gave us the heads up on the \"experimenting\" beforehand that way we weren't in for too much of a shock. Overall, we spent about $120.00 plus tax and tip.\n\nThe chicken, panna cotta and Harmony's friendly service are this restaurant's saving grace for me. I've had better luck finding cheaper sustainable eats, compared to higher end restaurants. I hope this experience doesn't repeat at other fine dining establishments in the future (especially in SF). Otherwise, I'm in for a rude awakening. My final rating is 3.5 in actuality. Happy Holidays everyone.", "author": "Ryan M."}

They do liken themselves to a true Italian place. Waitstaff don't waste any time correcting you should you mispronounce anything. ( obviously my 2 years of recent Italian lessons proved more helpful only in Italy!)\n\nThe minestrone pancake was only interesting hype. This was the contents of minestrone soup roughed chopped with stale bread, formed into a large patty and fried. Meh. A soggy mess of nothin'. Disappointing and didn't taste good even.\n\nThe pastas did shine. Their signature spaghetti was good. Sauce a tad sweet. Could have done without the lemon rind on top. The short rib cappelletti was delicious, tender and luscious sitting in its sticky sauce. The best dish. The Paccheri with rockfish was ok. The pasta itself was good. The sauce was ok. The small little bits of fish were tasteless and odd, in my opinion. \n\nThe grilled Monterey squid served on fagioli was very good. The squid was grilled just right and tasted almost as sweet as the ones we just had in Venice. \n\nWe liked the rose flight we had.

I would place them in the top 5 among the casual 'affordable' dining places (excludes fine dining places like Gary Danko, The Dining Room at Ritz, etc.).\n\nTo new Yelpers: When a restaurant approaches 300 reviews, there is something special about that place, so don't mind the seemingly average 4 out of 5 Star average rating.  In Yelp, it is very difficult to maintain 4.5 or 5.0 Star average with over 300 reviews (with some exceptions like Little Star Pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz/__I9HmtBMV4dDkEgT22V4g , Kokkari http://www.yelp.com/biz/PsY5DMHxa5iNX_nX0T-qPA , and Gary Danko http://www.yelp.com/biz/WavvLdfdP6g8aZTtbBQHTw as of May 2007).  \n\n* Of course, if you sell hotdogs on the street at 2 AM, you'll easily maintain 5 Star average. http://www.yelp.com/biz/89lcibUju_4PqUrZ10w71w\n\nRESERVATION: This restaurant is HOT, HOT, HOT!  Maybe it will cool down, but as of spring 2007, reservations during reasonable dinner hours were fully booked for 1.5 weeks, even during weekdays.\n\nSEATS:  A decent size restaurant.  The main dining area to the left had 20-25 tables and 8-10 counter seats.  These counter seats overlook the dining area.  The room to the right housed the bar (6-8 seats), food staging area, and 4 tables.  The heated and covered patio area had 8-10 tables.  Overall, tables were places fairly close together.\n\nFOOD:  I found their dishes to be good for sharing.  Take for example, Roasted Fulton Valley chicken, an excellent dish I ordered thanks to Ed U.'s review.  Portion size was half of a chicken, which I could have eaten by myself, but I would have been chickened out.  It complemented well with a completely different flavor provided by Spaghetti with plum tomatoes.

I decided to go there for my early bday celebration yesterday and left very happy about the food. The restaurant was super busy yesterday and I got a little upset that out table (reservation for 9:30pm) wasn't ready for a little while. Well, after all we got to know from a waitress that the place isn't that crazy busy on a Thursday. There was something going on in SF and that's why they were very busy. Anyways. We enjoyed our meal. We got the green peppers as an appetizer and the red sauce that was on top of it was AMAZING! I could eat a bowl of just that sauce. I also got the escarole salad and I loved it! The dressing was delicious. My husband got the grilled calamari and I got a taste of the beans and greens and it was a very well made dish! I say you wouldn't even need the seafood on it. It's delicious just with the beans and greens. Very tasty! A friend got the anchovies and they enjoyed it too. For our entrees, I decided to go with something simple and got the spaghetti and it was incredible delicious! My husband got the black pasta with octopus and something wasn't ok with that dish. It had a very fishy taste and it was quite bad. Don't know if they overpower it with some fish stock or what it was. Our friends got the ravioli, which had a delicious sauce on it! Oh and we had the bread with the buffalo butter that was great. I was so happy with the food that decided to have dessert to try it out. I got the chocolate dessert (don't remember the name) and has a delicious chocolate sauce on it. I felt that I could have it all when I started eating it, but then it was too much chocolate. The salty nuts on top helped on the balance of the dish a little bit, but I felt that if it had a fresh whipped cream or some mascarpone cheese to go with it would be just great. Even some vanilla ice cream would have helped.

It is probably my favorite district in the city. With that said....\n\nI've been hearing a lot about this place from my friend so he finally took me to experience what Delfina has to offer. We always walked PAST Delfina but I never ate there until just recently. I wasn't aware that they change their menu every night. Not too many repeats if any. Wow... Kind of a downer if you really enjoyed a dish there and want to go back for it again. But... I'd definitely come back to try their constantly changing menu.\n\nI can't really remember how much everything was (probably because I didn't pay lol), so I can't tell you if it was well worth the price or not. Sorry!\n\nSERVICE\nApparently, they were not taking any reservations when I had called them before heading out. Bummer. BUT! We were able to enjoy a beer outside while we waited for our seats. We ended up at the bar right next to the kitchen. We LOVE seats with the view of the kitchen so that was a plus. Staff was all very nice and accommodating.\n\nFOOD\n* I love that they sell half-bottles of wine! Although I have no problem drinking a whole bottle haha!\n\nChicken Pate: I was a little skeptical because it was chicken and not duck, but the waitress highly recommended it for us. I'm SO glad we ordered it. It was buttery and you can taste the garlic that was cooked into it along with the brandy. Was probably the best pate I have ever had.\n\nLittle Gem Butter Lettuce Salad: Dressed with some kind of mustard/citrus dressing, this was not really my favorite appetizers, but it was refreshing to have a salad. The boiled eggs were sieved (went through a cheese grater so it was shaved).\n\nOx Tail Risotto: The bright yellow risotto filled my nose with the sent of saffron. The color was captivating and the risotto was legit. Cooked perfectly and the shredded oxtail was savory and went very well with the risotto.", "author": "Heidi C."}

I tried the featured pomegranate bellini, which was extremely refreshing and not too sweet. We started with the prosciutto-mascarpone ravioli and the mint pasta with mushrooms and nettles. My husband who is from Italy wasn't too impressed with the ravioli, but I loved it; he preferred the mint dish. Overall, both were delicious though! We ordered the roasted chicken with mushrooms and swapped out the mashed potatoes for the cheesy polenta, which was truly amazing! We were pretty full after all this, but we still ordered the flourless chocolate cake to split. It's sort of dry, but the rice gelato that accompanies it is interesting.

The server was incredibly knowledgeable about all the dishes and gave great advice.  It's much smaller inside than I imagined, which isn't to say that you feel confined, just that there aren't a lot of tables so there is a finite amount of people that can eat in there at any one time.  It's a warm and romantic place.\n\nWe already had drinks down the street before so just ordered wines by the glass, they have a decent assortment of stuff, I had a few glasses of a great syrah ($13) that they were johnny-on-the-spot with the refill when I finished a glass.\n\nThey have a bunch of \"staples\" that are always on the menu and a bunch of seasonal stuff.  Everything tasted super fresh and very balanced with seasoning and salt, cooked correctly.  Other reviews discuss the food in depth but rest assured the positive reviews are correct.\n\nAcme and Tartine table bread by request too if you ask for it!\n\nIt's a first-class operation and worth the trouble to get in there.

I said there was no need for anything free or a big to-do but I just wanted to make sure we were treated extra special.  We enjoyed a couple glasses of the Pinot Noir at the bar as they were running a little behind on reservations (there isn't much space so don't plan on relaxing while you wait for a table).\n\nWe started off with the Clams and were given a complimentary prosciutto and fava beans (totally not necessary but very much appreciated).  Both dishes were delish, I did not try the prosciutto because I only eat seafood, no meat.  The clams were great, very light and flavorful, just the right portion for an appetizer.  My BF thoroughly enjoyed the prosciutto.\n\nFor the 2nd course, we tried the house made spaghetti because you just must when dining at an italian restaurant.   The noodles were awesome, sauce was good.\n\n3rd courses, I ordered the fish of the night (swordfish I think) and I was told it was the last piece.  The server went back and had them hold the fish for me.  My BF ordered the roasted chicken and mashed potatoes.  After waiting an extended period of time for our 3rd course we were informed by our server that a VIP guest came in and wanted the fish so they gave it to him instead.  I was a little disappointed but the restaurant was very accommodating.  They ran across the street to the sushi place and got a nice cut of yellowtail and prepared that special for me.  We were one of the last tables to leave the restaurant that night.  Our server, Angela, was amazing and if it weren't for her the fish fiasco would have made it a very poor experience.

But it was also the crowd for Delfina Pizzeria next door. A little confused where to go but it's the wooden door if this is your first time.\n\nNice atmosphere, attentive service, everyone was nice. All very good.\n\nWe started out a peach bellinis which were yummy. We wanted the Gnoccho Fritto but they rejected their batch that day as not good enough. Darn! So we opted for the Polenta Taragna and Chicken Liver Spiedini. Both very good but the Spiedini was my favorite.. the combination of chicken liver and pork cheek on skewers was just heavenly. I decided to have the Spaghetti for main dish. It was supposed to be the large for $15, but the table next to mine had the smaller for $10 and I swear they looked the same size (his was on smaller plate). The spaghetti itself was OK. I would recommend you skip this dish. My partner had the Pork Saltimbocca which was delicious but super tiny for $26. They served it with polenta.. which is strange because the table next to us had the same dish and they got spinach maybe? Some sort of green. The server didn't ask us what side we wanted but c'mon we already ordered polenta as a starter. For dessert we had the Panna Cotta (yum) and Spumoni Coppa (also yum)\n\nAnyway, with 2 glasses of wine the total for dinner was about $140.  Yup.. this place is way overpriced for what you get. The dishes were mostly tiny. I was really excited to try Delfina as it always came up as a must try for San Francisco. Their food is OK but the prices are not justifiable.", "author": "Vol T."}

Arrived at 5:30 for my reservation for four - the second one inside the restaurant - and they insisted on seating me at a table in the window under a speaker. I asked to change tables and even though almost ALL of their four tops were empty, they wouldn't move my seat. I watched diner after diner (who got there after me) enter and be seated at four tops against the wall. Their explanation for why I couldn't switch tables was that I didn't understand their \"seating system.\" I explained that I was with my elderly mother who wouldn't be able to hear if we sat under the speaker. They told me that I could wait a half an hour for a different table - when there were still empty tables! FINALLY a gentleman took pity on me and moved us to one of the many empty four tops. I will never understand why they insisted I  had to sit at the ONLY table in the room I didn't want to sit at. I think the reason is that they don't like to make accommodations. They have a way of doing things and if you question it they are unhappy. A power and control thing. Give certain people power and they run away with it. Our waitress, however, was delightful - couldn't have been better. I guess the next time I make a reservation I'll have to specify that I'll sit at any table in the restaurant except the one in the window.", "author": "KAte R."}

A good friend of mine is Italian and always encourages me on what wholesome and authentic Italian cuisine really tastes like. And if I had to pretend I took a cooking class, and laid out a delicious Italian dinner for her, there's no doubt that Delfina would be my accomplice!

It is especially fun if our guest are from out of town. What could be a better intro to San Francisco? A world class restaurant walking distance from home! \n\nSadly, Friday was a great disappointment. Our reservations were for 9:30pm, when we arrived a little early (our guest from London was young and a fast walker), we were asked to wait outside or at the bar (which was way too crowded.) 45 minutes later, we were finally seated. During the long wait, no one ever came out to reassure us we would eventually have a table. It was especially nerve making as we watched everyone else around us called into the restaurant.\n\nWhen we were finally shown our table, our server gave us our menus, told us they were out of the saltimbocca but had a cut of pork \"from the same pig\" and then disappeared for who knows how long. She was very busy with the tables around us but more or less ignored us before finally arriving and taking our orders. \n\nFor appetizers we ordered the warm olives and gnocco. The castelvetrano olives were tasty with a good olive oil but the gnocco were a total disappointment -- 3 squares of a dry, tastless \"beignet-like\" pastry, each with 3 paper thin slices of a  very ordinary salami. Dry, dry, dry -- thank goodness for the wine! We were so disappointed not to see the bakala we like so much gone from the menu.\n\nOur entrees were 2 orders of the \"same pig\" and our guest ordered the roast chicken. The entrees arrived quickly but what a disappointment! The pork was dry, tough and tasteless! Could it have been the leftovers from the saltimbocca preparation? The beans were definitely the best part of the dish. Our guest picked at her chicken and was too polite to say anything other than \"The mashed potatoes are quite tasty.\"\n\nAnd the final sadness was to be told that the kitchen had run out of the panna cotta. This was especially bad since we had just tried to gloss over the whole bad experience for our guest with \"The panna cotta will make it all worth while, hands down the best dessert in town!\" As we groaned loudly at the news, the server, in a throwback to the old Delfina, offered us a \"comped\" dessert, and we selected a raspberry budino which was very nice and the reason for 2 stars rather than one. As we departed, the servers, busy in the bar having a glass of wine, waved goodbye and left us feeling, \"Thank goodness they're finally going\" \n\nWill we back? Probably not. In the past Delfina really stood out from the crowd. The service was outstanding, the food sublime. Today, it seems like a victim of its own success. You don't have to be excellent if the crowds keep coming. We only hope this \"complacency disease \" isn't catching and that Locanda doesn't fall into its parent's trap.  The neighborhood has many other excellent places to choose from so we will  plan on branching out.", "author": "junona j."}

I ate here a while ago so my memory is not totally fresh, but it's a review I've been meaning to write. \n\nI had high hopes for this place - the reviews were great, my boyfriend planned a nice romantic dinner out in the city (a rarity!), and it's in the Mission. Unfortunately, I was pretty disappointed.\n\nFirst, parking was awful to find, but I'm not factoring that in to my rating (it's not the restaurant's fault that it sucks to find parking in the Mission), despite having trouble finding a spot, we arrived on time for our reservation, yet still had to wait, and weren't really properly acknowledged by the hostess, or anyone, really, when we arrived. \n\nWe were finally seated, but at a table for two, that may as well have been at a table for 10 - the tables were so close together it was awkward and distracting, and really did not lend itself to a romantic, intimate dinner because the tables next to you could hear every single word you said! The restaurant was packed, which usually for me is a plus because I like bustling places on the weekend (it's usually a good sign!), but this place was just way too crowded and poorly laid out, and it was awkward and uncomfortable to move around (and I'm a normal sized person, so I usually don't have trouble getting around).\n\nAlthough, it was so freaking loud from the crowd that even talking at a table for 2 may have been a bit difficult anyway. This place needs to get a sound engineer in there to figure out the acoustics - I've been to crowded places that don't sound super loud, I know it's possible.\n\nThe food was not memorable - it wasn't particularly bad, but for the price and the hype I just didn't really get it.

We got the duck liver, the pate of some sort, pork and something else. \nIdk about 'al dente' spaghetti but it was good once you get over the fact that it's not fully cooked. \nThe chicken was good, and tender. The pate whatever it was, was super good but everything else is ok.\n I was excited about this spot, then it didn't seem to 'wow' me super let down.

The ambiance is casual but not the least bit sloppy (the service is as good as just about anywhere). The decor is understated but still intimate. And the food is simple, not overpriced, consistent, and fresh. I've never had less than a stellar meal here.\n\nOne of my best friends is moving abroad, and we went yesterday to Delfina for one last dinner out on the town. We ordered the salt cod polpette (aka fish balls), latkes, and mixed greens to start, and we had black-truffle squab agnolotti and their classic spaghetti as entrees.\n\nI can't say enough about the spaghetti. I get it every time I come here, and it NEVER disappoints. It's a little spicy, with a robust helping of basil, yet the pasta itself is always perfectly al dente, and the sauce is fresh tomato-ey without being too watery or too pasty. Just make sure you get the large portion, which isn't even that large (but at $13 is still quite reasonable).\n\nBut the agnolotti was a revelation. Count me among those who are tired of the truffle oil fad, and when my friend ordered the agnolotti I winced inside, expecting the usual smoky mushroom flavor overwhelming everything else. Instead, it was ever-so-subtle, and the squab was tender, and the broth was the perfect complement.\n\nRumor has it that desserts here are great as well, but skip it and get Bi-Rite instead (egg nog with brandy until the holidays are over!).", "author": "Albert L."}

We showed up right on time, but our table was not ready.  10 minutes past our reservation, they brought us champagne, no questions asked, with an unconditional apology.  We had to wait 20 minutes more.  When we were shown our table, they comped our appetizers, and they were incredibly attentive.  And the food was *AMAZING*, and it was an incredibly cool space.\n\nFast forward to Delfina in November.  Same reservation time, 10pm.  Didn't have a table for us.  30 minutes past our reservation, while we were awkwardly wedged at a corner of the bar between seated eating people, they asked if we wanted to *order* any appetizers.  We're waiting and you want us to pay for it?\n\n50 minutes past our reservation time they sat us. \n\nWaitress comes over 10 minutes later, no apology for our wait.  No appetizers.  She asks us if we want anything to drink, I ask for wine recommendations, pointing to some bottles under $50.  She said she didn't know anything about the wine list, but would ask the sommelier.  Instead of the sommelier coming over to help us, she just said this $138 bottle was the best and we should order it.  I said no, I wanted one in this section (pointing to it again), and so the sommelier actually came to help us.\n\nI ended up ordering something and after another 10 minutes of waiting they brought a bottle of wine over, but it was the wrong one -- The first time I've gotten the wrong bottle of wine in years -- years!\n\nAt this point it was around 11:20, and Delfina had done absolutely nothing to impress us.  We'd gotten no food, no free drinks, no appetizers, and they'd screwed up our only order.  All we'd done is wait for 80 minutes, WITH A RESERVATION, and we had nothing to show for it.\n\nWe left.\n\nBest restaurants are judged by how they deal with problems -- see Spork, above.

After getting my ice cream on at Humphrey Slocombe, we got it into our heads that we should walk to Bi-Rite for a head to head comparison. Unfortunately (or fortunately), we got distracted by the siren call of dinner. There was an hour long wait at 6pm, but we weren't in a hurry, so during the wait we strolled on over to Tartine to give the pastries a try.\n\nWe were seated promptly at 7 (but at the bar, which made conversation a bit difficult between the three of us). After some perusing, we settled on the spaghetti, calamari with white beans and the roasted chicken.\n\nAMBIANCE: Super casual and... airy. I felt like the space really promoted conversation (as evidenced by the constant buzz of noise swirling around the room) with the combination of seating and lighting. If you have a choice, I would recommend sitting at a table vs the bar area, unless you are a party of two.\n\nSERVICE: Slow. We ran out of water and it took a while to refill, but our waitress was very sweet. \n\nFOOD:\n- Calamari w/ white beans: very fresh squid. Yum. Too bad this dish was TOO SALTY.\n- Spaghetti: I really liked the acidic kick of the tomato sauce. I only sampled this dish, but I liked what I tried. I can see the flavor getting slightly monotonous/overwhelming if I had consumed the entire plate.\n- Roasted chicken: OMG. I LOVED this dish. J is not a huge fan of chicken (doesn't think its special) but even he enjoyed it. The chicken is succulent, flavorful, and just... yummy. My faves were the skin and the dark meat. MMM. I'd go back just for that.\n\nOverall, it was a very nice dinner. Total for that plus wine was ~$65 + tax&tip.

A little bit of bitterness from the greens and walnuts, a little bit of salt and crunch from the pancetta and all is balanced out with the tangy and sweet balsamic vinaigrette. \n\nFor entrees: \n-Spaghetti with plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and peperoncini \n-Saltimbocca topped with prosciutto\n\nFor dessert: \n-Strawberry panna cotta\n\nEnjoyed every single dishes that we ordered, from the salad to the dessert, but my ultimate favorites are the Spaghetti and the Panna Cotta. I think it's so amazing that something so simple (the spaghetti dish) can taste to Divine. The ingredients are very basic but the flavors were quite complex. The texture of the pasta were truly al dente and the flavor  of the tomato sauce were just infused into the pasta. I loved it so much that I tried to do a re-make of it at home but I failed immensely.", "author": "Jenny K."}

I then had the Roasted Fulton Valley Chicken, which was amazing - flavorful, juicy chicken with great, buttery mashed potatoes...who knew something as simple as chicken and potatoes could be so fantastic?  We shared the Panna Cotta, which was very good - rich with a perfect texture, it also managed to be a palate cleanser.  I ordered a nice Chardonnay (Lioco, Sonoma County) that went perfectly with everything - an inexpensive white wine without the acidity I usually expect.\n\nThe service at Delfina was very attentive and friendly.

The salmon was flaky and it had a yummy corn and caper sauce.\n\nWe were too full for dessert because we had ice cream before our meal.

So when I found out my mom was going to be in town, I immediately went to their website and booked an 8:30 rez. When we arrived, they informed us they were running about 15 minutes behind. But to make up for it, they gave me a free glass of Prosecco. Immediately, I wasn't as bummed about the extra wait time.\n\nI loved, loved, loved the fresh grilled calamari and white bean salad that I ordered. There was a fresh lemon taste that blended perfectly with the richness of the calamari and beans.\n\nMy mom got the Insalata di Campo, which was bitter greens, pancetta, shaved parmagiano, walnuts, and balsamic vinaigrette. Well, they forgot the walnuts, and I don't think she was super pumped about the salad in general. (For the record, I had a bite and thought it was delicious).\n\nFor entrees, I ordered a house-made rosemary fettuccine with a traditional meat ragu. It didn't look like anything special on the plate, but I was in love with this pasta. The subtle taste of the rosemary in the pasta and the traditional bolognese sauce went together perfectly.\n\nAgain, it was a tale of two dinners. My mom got the pork belly with clams, chickpeas, and chard. She didn't exactly enjoy it. She wasn't aware pork belly was so fatty and overall, I think it just wasn't what she was expecting. The waitress was SO sweet. Offered to bring her something else, but my mom totally took responsibility for ordering the wrong thing and turned them down. Still, they sent over some delicious soup to try and make ammends.\n\nDessert...one last shot to impress mom. And...SUCCESS! Phew! It was lime buttermilk panna cotta with huckleberries and it was seriously like heaven on a plate. My mom loved it. \n\nLong story short...I absolutely LOVED this place. My mom...not so much.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-26", "description": "Here's the to-the-point, the skinny, or the executive, summary: food has flashes of brilliance, but there are too many waiters unconcerned about the customer experience for me to recommend this to anybody. I'm not clicking on the Like button.\n\nFirst, about what I like about the place. We called at 9:30 pm on Sat June 25, and the hostess was very accommodating and polite person, giving us a table at 10 pm. In the Mission, we braved countless latino men brandishing Mexico flags celebrating the soccer victory over the US, sidewalk open-air dance parties (someone had turned their living room into a DJ studio, with throngs of people dancing on the sidewalk) at the fringes of which there were people blasting roaches, and out-of-towners searching for parking for the nearby Gay Pride parties in the castro. We skedaddled the Mini Cooper (the \"PASHMNI\" named after my wife and the Mini) into a tight spot, and walked over.\n\nBack to the hostess, this could have been a different one, but she was even friendlier, assured us that we'd be seated soon, and we found our way to the bar area. That's when the bad customer experience began. I stood at the edge of a short bar, and waited patiently for about 8 minutes while a waiter busied himself behind the bar doing this and that, with nary a glance at me. Finally, I asked another waitress, and she said she couldn't serve me, but would snag the snooty waiter. To her credit, she did, and he served me a beer. Nursing my beer, I then asked the hostess (this time, a younger, somewhat inexperienced one) if we could sit at some empty chairs while waiting for our table, and she said no, it was reserved for people eating. As it happened, a couple walked in through the door, checked in, and just sat down on those chairs - lesson learned, next time I won't ask.\n\nWe ordered an appetizer, a first course, and a second course - and when the calamari appeared, I declared it \"divine\" because of the fantastic marinated squid (I think it was squid) that came in it. That was a great start. The Mint Tagliatelle was declared too salty by my wife, and I have to agree with her, though I downed it because I was hungry - it tasted like about 900mg of salt in a small serving - sort of like pasta soaked in chinese soy sauce, though, to be fair, it could have been a great dish without the salt. Finally, the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes - the potatoes were really great, but the chicken average. And it took so long to come to the table that we had to ask for it be to boxed up so we could get out of there and go to the great crepe place on 11th street for a butter-and-sugar-whipped-creme-crepe-to-go.\n\nHere's my advice to the Delfina management - revamp your customer service. Our waitress, though perfectly nice and personable (she must have read the article that said a good tip comes from smiling and being friendly), didn't refill our butter, rarely came to check on how we were doing, and while we waited the interminable wait for the roasted chicken, she was nowhere to be found.\n\nWho was attentive was a waiter whose first day it was at Delfina. We noticed how attentive he was being to a number of tables, and flagged him down to ask him to refill our butter, which he did (not saying, \"I can't serve you, but I'll ask the your waiter\", like the first waiter at the bar), and he even checked on our roasted chicken to tell us it was almost ready. We complimented him, and he said this was his first day so he was a bit nervous. I don't know what your name is, but we hope you remain the same person you were when you joined Delfina that day - never change! If Delfina can bottle that newness and enthusiasm, they could become a great restaurant, not just a good one.", "author": "Vik C."}

I would have eaten anything and it would have tasted great.

Anyhow, when I say forever, I mean forever...I lived around the corner for over a year and managed to go everywhere else: Tartine several times to get that oh so delicious morning bun, Bi-Rite for cheese and groceries, Bi-Rite Creamery for amazeBall ice cream...well you get the picture! But never Delfina! And because of that I didn't pay much mind to the difference between \"Delfina\" and \"Delfina Pizzeria\", silly me, I thought I could ALSO get pizza at Delfina, but for the moment that's neither here nor there.\n\nOk so first the bad and then the good. The bad, we arrived early, 30 minutes to be exact for an 8PM reservation. They told us we'd have to wait until 8, no probs there, but the bar space is super small and everyone in it was eating full meals, leaving not a one chair or space to stand open, so we hopped over to Farina for a cocktail while we waited. Those folks were funny, def. will go back there, but at 7:55 we closed out our bar tab and hopped back over to Delfina. We checked in at 8 and low and behold our table isn't free. Ok, still no probs, and then....an hour goes by. ONE whole hour. It was my bday, so that kinda sucked...but in Deflina's defense they really took care of us while we waited and did everything they could to get the folks taking up a table after paying and having no food left to scooch. We got lots of yummy apps on the house and they were very apologetic. So no harm no foul.\n\nOk now the good good good food:\n\nBarbera d'Alba \"Brichet\" | C a'Viola 2009, Piemonte - Don't remember the price but nice medium bodied flavor\n\nWarm Castelvetrano Olives $6: What is it about a warm olive smothered in olive oil? Delicious. \n\nSpiced Almonds $3: Could pass on this. Lots of fennel, nice if we had a beer.\n\nGnoccho Fritto & La Quercia Proscuitto $9: Only one in my group eats meat, so we gave her the proscuitto and w/out it the \"gnocchi\" more like puff pastry was very bland.\n\nRicotta Stuffed Squash Blossoms $13: To die for. Just the right amount of salt, cheese and lightly fried goodness. Get 2 orders if there are more then 4 people. \n\nGrilled Monterey Bay Calamari w/warm white bean salad $11: Very buttery and yummy. The bean salad was really tasty. \n\nSmothered Chard | lemon, garlic $8: Tasty and simple side dish.\n\nStuffed zucchini:Special, meh, could have passed on this.\n\nSpaghetti | plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, peperoncini $10/$15: OMG, so simple and so amazingly good. Brought me back to Rome. Get the large. \n\nPansotti | walnut sauce $17: Like raviolli in a nutty cream sauce. So tasty.\n\nMint Tagliatelle | fresh porcini mushrooms, nepitella $18: Not my favorite but still tasty for those who like mushrooms and a little bit of cream. \n\nRose-Mascarpone Crostata | Frog Hollow peaches, hazelnut croccante $9: Wow, fresh and creamy with sweetness from the peaches and crunch from the cookie. \n\nStraus Milk Granita | strawberries, almond cartellate, aged balsamico $9: This was like a Hawaiin shaved ice. Really fun and delicious.", "author": "Shira O."}

The photos I have posted of the beautiful entrees attest to the obvious deftness of the cooks. \n\nOur party of four started off with the grilled fresh calamari, the fresh-cured anchovies (impressively flavorful and balanced - the acidic lemon and wine tamed the saltiness), and the beef carpaccio (a special); all of these were excellent and served in generous proportions. \n\nFor our main entrees, we ordered the spaghetti, leg of lamb, roasted chicken, and rosemary tagliatelle. We shared braised chard and the Romano beans stracotto. I sampled a bit of everything, but ordered the leg of lamb.\n\nThe leg of lamb was one of the most beautifully presented leg of lamb entrees I have ever seen: generous slices of perfectly pink lamb sitting on a bed of fresh beans and resting in a rich jus. The only thing detracting from its perfect texture and temperature was that it was too salty for my palette (unfortunately, this is a rather important factor). \n\nThe other dishes were tasty and fresh, particularly the pastas, but we all agreed that the entrees were a bit too salty.\n\nNOTE: Upon reliable advice from a friend and frequent Delfina diner, I consider last night's briny entree experience anomalous. Perhaps some of the cooking staff were a bit under the weather. Still, I was pleased to finally get a reservation here.", "author": "Chris T."}

I had been to Pizzeria Delfina before, but the Pork Sugo and Papardelle of Delfina Restaurant had always eluded me.\n\nAnd.... which it continued to do on my first visit. I was greatly disappointed to find that the infamous pork sugo and papardelle dish was unavailable the Saturday night that I dined there so I was forced to make due with other dishes. \n\nI started off with the grilled fresh calamari and warm white bean salad.  The calamari was tender (not at all rubbery) and had an sweet smokiness that nicely contrasted with the butter-soft smoothness of the  white beans. It brought me back to a wonderful warm calamari salad I had once at A Cote. \n\nNext, we had the heirloom tomato salad with burrata and anchovies. The mainstay of the dish, the tomatoes, were underwhelming. What really stood out in this dish were the burrata and croutons. There aren't many more naturally perfect combinations like creamy burrata, tomatoes, olive oil, and a crunchy starch. The starch in this dish were the most perfect croutons morsels I have ever had: garlicky, infused with the olive oil dressing, but still amazingly crispy. \n\nI quickly got over my disappointment re: the pork sugo when I started on my main dish: spaghettini nero with uni. Most people would be revolted at the thought of black pasta, but I am obsessed with squid ink.  Though the squid ink spaghetti tasted of sea salt and was distinctly maritime, it wasn't fishy at all. The subtle spiciness of the dish was a great contrast to the briny, seafood essence of the squid ink and fresh uni. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my meal at Delfina, but I'll have to return to try the elusive Pork Sugo and Papardelle.

Albert was right when he said Delfina is the ideal SF restaurant.  It's just the right size, unpretentious, is very reasonably priced for what you get.\n\nBottles of wine vary in price but start with very reasonable selections in the $40-50 range.  Even though there's no formal sommelier, the servers actually know a lot of nuances about the wine list, so be sure to ask them.  There's warm bread available upon request, which is awesome for dipping up the last of your sauces in the end.\n\nWe started with the Louisana white shrimp in porchetta - it was one of the most plump and flavorful shrimp I've had in a long time.  They're served head on, peeled, and have such rich flavor that penetrates throughout the entire shrimp.\n\nWe then couldn't resist with the pastas - we ordered 4 of them and then ordered another of the semola baattuta.  My favorite was obviously the semola battuta, which is like a thicker, more textured ribbon pasta, topped with a very flavorful lamb ragu and shaved pecorino.  It's served super warm, so the pecorino melts as it touches the pasta.  This dish was super addictive, and I don't even like lamb. \n\nMy next favorite pasta was the squid ink chitarra, which was squid ink throughout the spaghetti-like pasta, tossed in crab butter, slightly peppery, then topped with fresh dungeness crab and a squeeze of subtle meyer lemon to balance it out.  This was a close second to the lamb ragu.\n\nThe ravioli with a sweet kuri squash filling topped with nutmeg had a nice nutty balance with the sweet puree, but I would have preferred just the filling on its on in another dish.  The tripe was just ok for me, since I'm not a big tripe fan, but my friends LOVED IT and soaked up every last bit with the bread.\n\nAs for entrees, the pork was well flavored but not as amazing or unique as the pastas.  The shortrib was nice in that it was cooked in pieces, rather than the usual stewed fork-tender shortrib.  It was firmer, less fatty, and sat on an amazing sauce that I wish there was more of.  The accompanying polenta was a bit dry but was much better with the sauce from the shortrib.\n\nWe had to pass on desserts since we were down the street from Tartine and Bi-Rite.\n\nI'm usually scared of having too much carbs, but I would happily eat their pasta every night.

You can make a similar version at home. \n\nGet a flat big pan and put enough olive oil on bottom to coat.  Be liberal with olive oil.   Heat on low heat. Peel about 5 garlic cloves and put in pan.    (You can adjust amount of garlic to taste.)  Add red chili pepper pods to pan too.  Heat the garlic and red chili pepper pods over low heat for 20 min. to 30 min to infuse oil.  Remove the garlic and chili pepper pods.\nAdd 2 big cans of San Marzano tomatoes.  You now simmer for at least 30 minutes but as much as 2 hours.  Mash up the tomatoes with a potato masher or fork while it stews.  You want the oil to blend with the tomatoes so that its totally combined.  The tomato sauce thickens once the tomato juice evaporates.\n\nBoil good spaghetti in a separate pot with water salted well.  (At least one pound of pasta for 2 big cans of San Marzano tomatoes.)  When the pasta is half done (still hard and has crunch if you bite), move the pasta into the tomato sauce and finish cooking pasta in the tomato sauce.  You need to add some pasta water into the tomato sauce too because pasta sauce is too thick.  Probably 2/3 sauce to 1/3 pasta water.   You can adjust as you go.

Had I not come in with any expectations, I'd probably have rated this a wavering 4 star, but at best, it's coming in a 3.5 stars for me.\n\nWe sat down to an excitable waiter who was helpful and honest throughout the meal.  After being informed that it's best to order sides/appetizers if we're going for the pasta because \"it takes a while,\" we went with the honey glazed brussel sprouts and olive oil mashed potatoes.  If the meal stopped right then and there, I would have loved it.  However, we waited a good 40ish minutes for our pastas to come out after destroying the amazing sides.  Note to self: try to cook these 2 dishes.\n\nOnce the pasta finally came out, with our server confessing that he was prodding the kitchen staff, it was a small, yet, delicious portion of food.  I guess my gripe was that it took so long to cook an unimpressive amount of pasta, where the taste was good, but the price point was not.  The closest thing I can compare Delfina's pasta to is Seven Hills or Barbacco, both of which impressed me more.\n\nMy girlfriend went with the Rigatoncini with wild boar ragu and I went with the Black Truffle-Squab Agnolotti in Brodo.  The rigatoncini was perfectly cooked and the wild boar ragu definitely met my high expectations.  This is savory pasta at its best in my opinion.\n\nMy agnolotti was pretty much similar to mini ravioli floating in a broth that I liken to beef consomme.  It had a watery, yet rich flavor where the broth could have been served as a delicious soup.  The pasta, unfortunately, was a tiny bit lacking, where some came out a little soggy and I didn't taste and truffle at all.  On top of that, I kind of expected a little bit more to the dish than pasta floating in soup, no matter how unique it was.  \n\nAll in all, perhaps Delfina is a place to go more for the main dishes rather than the pasta, which is possibly the point of Pizzeria Delfina and Locanda.", "author": "Jeff N."}

You know, like those other hordes of hipsters. And it's hard to differentiate whether the large amount of people that seem to always be outside the door of Delfina are customers from the restaurant, their pizzeria that is directly next door or people just hanging out. But, in the last 5 years the large crowds never seem to diminish. \n\nNever.\n\nI had made plans to go to A16, but when I couldn't get a reservation that worked about my school schedule, we made a joyous second plan to go to Delfina. And Urbino isn't open yet, so that wasn't even an option. Son of a bitch. Delfina and Delfina Pizzeria are the creations of maniac, 2008 James Beard Award winner Craig Stoll, who was also voted one of the best chefs of 2001 by Food & Wine. And as their menu changes frequently, perhaps everyday, and the foods are seasonal and some sustainable...I can see what the hype is all about. \n\nThe first thing I noticed as we walked in was the entire female FOH staff. Also, most of the BOH cooks/chefs in the kitchen were women. Delicious.  The restaurant is, what the real estate market has coined the phrase, \"cozy.\" Well, it's neither small nor large, and the tables are pretty close together. And as there is a large wooden bench that spans the entire back wall, that doubles as a seat for the tables, you're more than likely going to eventually touch the hand of the person who's sitting next to you. Not necessarily sitting with you. As I was sitting next in between an emaciated young woman and a stylish boi, I was pretty happy if either were to touch me. It's intimate, romantic, modern and every bit of what you think when you hear the term, \"San Francisco fine dining.\" The wine list was extensive and I know nothing about wine, however, my dining partner does and I let him take the wheel. \n\nOh, and the wait staff is really friendly, helpful and quite charming.\n\nOn to the damn food.\n\nWine - - Tiefenbrunner, LaGrien - - This is the first time I have known what a good wine tastes like. Reasonable price, a beautiful, deep garnet colour. You could smell the fruit and the wood tones, rather than just alcohol. Damn you $10 bargain wines of Food Outlets!\n\nAntipasti - - Salt Cod Mantecato w/ walnut oil and toasted fennel seed flatbread - - This was basically nothing more than a bacalao paste in a ramekin that came with lots of crispy pieces of flatbread. Those were good.\n\nInsalata di Campo - Bitter Greens with Pancetta, Walnuts, Parmigiano and Balsamic Vinaigrette - - The cheese was addicting.\n\nEntr\u00e9e - - Wolfe Ranch Quail w/ Anson Mills polenta, house-made fennel sausage and a Vin Santo sauce. Jesus (the Hey-sus version) almighty, I tell you...this was amazing. I now know what my instructor, Chef Brian, is talking about when he says we under season our food in class. At first, this dish was kind of a salt shock to my system. But, it made the food taste better. I really got the flavors. Tender pieces of Quail quarters on a bed of creamy polenta...ahhh. And that killer sausage, bits of it all throughout my dish. \n\nMint Tagliatelle w/ Chanterelles - The mint was kneaded directly into the dough. However, my dining partner is a vegetarian, so they didn't cook this dish with their normal chicken stock which made the dish very bland. Not their fault, it's his fault for being a lame anemic non-carnivore. No wonder he's so sensitive and laid-back. EAT SOME MEAT!\n\nDessert - - That's right...I said. My major is Baking and any self-respecting baker is going to try out the damn desserts, right? I'm probably just making excuses for being \nfat.\n\nProfiteroles  w/ espresso gelato, warm chocolate sauce and candied almonds.\n\nRed Cow Parmigiano Regigiano (Emilia-Romagna cow's milk) with saba. Saba is like a grape syrup (from Trebbiano grapes) added to a high-quality balsamic vinegar. It was delicious! \n\nUgh, the bill was more than I have ever spent on myself, but I didn't feel guilty during our hurtful times in the recession. We left the waitress a tip so grand that she came after us outside and thanked us, happy she didn't have to claim this tip on her taxes, I'm sure. Now, I know why the wait staff is so damn great...tippers like us. We finished our meal with a walk in the rare warm February night down Valencia, but no hand holding was involved in this clich\u00e9 night out.\n\nHowever, after this meal, I now understand why people like to finish it up with a cigarette, or if you're not a smoker...a night of down and dirty romping in the sack.

ALSO, I've eaten and made fresh pasta and that pasta did not taste fresh. Fresh pasta is usually delicate and melty and this was not at all. In fact it was quite al dente. How is this possible? Fresh pasta takes about 3-4 minutes at the most to cook. The duck ragout or sugo as they call it did taste good, the salad was good and the olive oil mashed potatoes good.

There is definitely a fine-dining atmosphere, but that didn't deter me from feeling comfortable in my t-shirt and jeans. \n\nFOOD: ZOMG. Freakin' awesomeness. We shared an appetizer plate of the fried calamari. We were expected deep-fried calamari with some dip. Instead, we got an elegant dish of grilled calamari over beans (I think) and olives. The two balanced items balanced well together. I even would use the beans as a spread for my bread. You can't waste such excellent deliciousness. \n\nMy friend had the oxtail risotto with some Parmesan cheese on top. The risotto reminded me of mac and cheese. The oxtail was soooo tender. My only gripe was that it was a bit too salty.\n\nI had a pork dish, but my brain is fuzzy and I can't remember the name. Unfortunately, it's not on their online menu, since their daily dishes are constantly changing. The pork was thinly sliced and was pretty salty. The sauce was also very strong and sweet. However, while each item was strong on its own, there was a good balance when you had them together. \n\nPRICE: Expect to pay about $15-20 a dish for dinner. About the right price for this venue and its location. Portion sizes are not terrible for a fine dining restaurant.\n\nSERVICE: Great service.

Little ravioli things...  Light as pillows filled with god knows what. \n( If god knew he would keep them for herself).  The god of pasta that is...\n\nHow about the duck.  Wowser.  How about the pork belly.  Melting away the taste buds did.  Yes they did.  Sauces on both of these.  \nLickin it up. Even the chicken.

There is no such thing as perfection...but I will rag on two things.\n\nGot a half order of little pasta sheets with shrimp.  Small portion not a problem but wheres the shrimp??  Literally 1/4 of ONE piece of shrimp. Yahoo serious!  Not cool.  Bubba gump is coming to kick your ass over this one.  Cmon cheffy, does a full order only have two morsels of shrimp.  I mean the dish still rocked because the sauce was great, but if it had say 6 small morsels of shrimp I would have been over the moon.\n\nAnd now for the finest, pettiest complaint.  Bread service.  You need to ask for it and it is awesome bread.  BUT... BUT!!  ... they only slice it 80% through. It has a wonderful thick crust but this means we are talking two handed bread pull to get a piece.  Now ladies, here is the truth about guys.  At least half of em dont wash their hands after using the toilet.  So if mr. man goes first, he is grabbing and tearing \"his\" bread AND \"your\" slice.  Mmmm.   Stank from the hang low for everyone at the table.  OK, sorry about the grossout, but really, why fight with bread at the table.  Cut this stuff ALL THE WAY THROUGH!.   Does someone think this is \"cute\" , \"rustic\" , \"country\" style service?  It's not, Its downright fucking stupid on every level.\n\nSo there you have it.

My dad wanted to try this place because of the reviews on yelp and from word of mouth. So we took him there to celebrate Father's Day on a Monday night. \n\nWe started with the sardine, which was really tasty. I would definitely go back for that. My dad ordered the chicken with the mashed potatoes. He said it was pretty good. I thought the mashed potatoes were amazing. So good. My mom and sister shared the bistecca which was meh. I shall elaborate later on this... as for me, I had the salmon with the lemon caper sauce, which was absolutely yummy. \n\nSo for my parent's review- it took too long for our food to come out. The manager (i think) came over and said that my friend who works in the kitchen said \"hello\" and that our steak would be a little bit; my friend was super sweet and made us a little rabe sautee. So that's when we found out that the steak takes around 40 mins. Around 45 minutes after ordering, we told our waitress that we were waiting for our food, and that she should've told us how long it would take since it wasn't stated on the menu. My parents seriously wanted to walk out. Finally, the steak came out, but it was medium rare, which was too rare for my family. Again, the waitress failed to ask how we wanted it cooked when we first ordered. So that's where my parents give the low rating.\n\nThe manager however remedied the situation, and brought the steak back to be cooked a but more. In the meantime, she gave us a free plate of the chilled asparagus, which was so great. I highly recommend it. It seemed like it was soaked in vinegar or marinated in something, which gave it a nice touch. In addition to that, the manager took of the bistecca from our bill, which was a nice gesture. \n\nI didn't like the steak much, but I loved the salmon, sardine, asparagus, and the potatoes. I also think the manager was very nice and took care of the situation. So 4 stars for that on my end.", "author": "Katrina L."}

I was appalled by what I found once we got there: there was no vegetarian entree at all.  \n\nMuch to my chagrin, the only thing they offer vegetarians is spaghetti (like  Emmy's Spaghetti Shack, only more expensive).

It was so noisy and we were so packed in that we could barely hear one another above the guy at the next table who was rattling on about \"Survivor\".

I remember how impressed I was with the unearthly succulence of the roasted Fulton Valley chicken the first time I was there. I can tell you I just shared it with a friend this evening, and it's still the most perfectly cooked chicken in the city. We also had the equally impressive Niman Ranch steak done to an ideally tender medium rare. Both had perfect accompaniments, creamy mashed potatoes with the chicken (it has to be served on a separate plate since the portions are so large) and the just crisp enough French fries with the steak.\n\nNow those are just two of the mouth-watering entrees. We actually began with a hearty potato and white bean pancake, peasant fare done up gourmet style, and an escarole salad with figs and hazelnuts. Both were superb starters. There was also a nice $32 bottle of a lovely cabernet-merlot wine with a nice vanilla finish..I only wished I wrote down the name of it. Our only disappointment was the somewhat overcooked green beans mixed with bacon and red peppers, which we felt looked like it belonged in one of the old aluminum trays that held Swanson's TV dinners in the sixties. Luckily, dessert got our meal back on track as we shared a lovely panna cotta with raspberries and a crispy tart with a vanilla gelato. We also had small pots of their specialty herbal teas, which made for the ideal finish to the meal. \n\nEven though they doubled their original space, the place still gets quite packed nightly. You will be sitting almost elbow-to-elbow with the adjacent diners. Just don't get too territorial and you'll be fine. You need to make a reservation at least a few hours in advance to get a table, and while the bar is an option, I have to admit the seats there are not all that comfortable. The wait staff is pleasant and seems knowledgeable enough about both the food and wine menus. Unless you eat early, parking can be a problem. They offer a parking lot about a block and a half away, but it costs $8. Better to monitor the streets for your lucky break. I've had the best luck parking on 18th Street beside the tennis courts in Dolores Park.

We just made the move back to CA after 6 years on the East Coast and worried that we'd miss having a wide variety of excellent Italian options (from Babbo, Bar Pitti, Dell Anima, Celeste, etc. in Manhattan). Tried a few places in the city and was thoroughly disappointed and about to give up. The severe disappointment of Bottega in Rutherford put us to the edge. Shame on me as many folks had recommended Delfina in the past...\n\nWalking in on a Saturday night, our wait  only took 20 minutes. We started off with the gem lettuce salad along with the lardo+breadsticks. Both excellent. Then, we split the famous spaghetti with cherry tomatoes and garlic. WOW! A dish so simple yet so delicious -- that we were comparing it to the phenomenal penne pomodoro that we had in Sienna a few summers ago. Moved on to the secondi, which consisted of tagliatelle w/ wild boar and the braised rabbit. Speechless.

Knowing that it is usually a scene and hard to get a seat, it was only recently that I returned for dinner with my boyfriend. On this particular occassion, we encountered astronomical hits and some disappointing misses.  \n\nWe started with the grilled fresh calamari. The squid were cooked perfectly, but  I was surprised at how small the white beans were (I assumed they were organic).  For dinner, I had the duck with homemade sourkraut.  I can honestly say that the duck was possibly one of the best I ever had- the sauce was dark and savory with pomegranate seeds. Unfortunately, my knife was dull and I had a hard time separating the meat from the bone. I'm not a big fan of kraut, though, so the side didn't do much for me. My boyfriend ordered a pasta dish with bass. He loved the noodles and sauce, but there wasn't much fish.  We weren't expecting a filet, but the fish was flaked and lightly sprinkled on the top, almost like parmesan shavings. A little more fish would have rounded out the dish. \n\nDessert proved to be the summary of our dining experience that evening. We ordered two dishes- the olive oil cake and the blood orange panna cotta. The panna cotta curled our toes, and was one of the best desserts we ever tasted. The cake was nothing special.  \n\nWhile we experienced some disappointing moments, the \"homeruns\" were a glimpse of Delfina's solid reputation as an award-winning dining establishment.

Whoops! We quickly walked out and went into the restaurant side. I ordered the grilled calamari white bean salad , which was to die for. It's probably one of the best things I ate this weekend. The calamari was soft and had a really nice smokey/grilled flavor to it., the arugula gave the dish a nice peppery taste, the white bean was cooked just right, the olives added a salty element to it, and the dressing on the arugula was fab since it had a touch of lemon. YUMMMMMMMMMMMMMS. (Ok so I dissected the dish like a nerd. Whatevs...) Anyways, my bestie didn't really enjoy it since he doesn't like eating a lot of beans. SCORE!! I ordered the funghi risotto as my entree. The dish was creamy and delish but a little on the salty side. If they brought down the salt notch a little, I would have loved it.

With the positive reviews here plus my friend's response of \"that's one of my favourite restaurants!\" I was excited to check it out.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the Insalata di Campo along with the warm olives.  Both were phenomenal and a good appetizer.  The crusty bread they brought out along with the salted butter was delicious as well.  I was worried it would ruin my appetite for the main course, but everything was very light and not quite filling enough... which made me extremely happy when my dinner came out.  Despite all the tempting options, I kept looking back at the spaghetti: quiet, unassuming, plain spaghetti with tomatoes, garlic, and peperoncini.  You would think something so simple, with so little in it... it would be boring and unappealing.  Somehow though, it wound up being perfect!  The tomatoes were juicy and flavourful, the peperoncini flavour so subtle you could barely tell they were there (oh but they were!) and the best?  I never had al dente spaghetti done just perfect.  \n\nAfter waxing so poetic over the spaghetti, the rest of our meal deserves some mention: my friend ordered the Rosemary Tagliatelle al Ragu. It looked and smelled amazing, but sadly I couldn't try it (it has some sort of meat mixed in it).  He seemed to enjoy it very much though.  We also shared the Turnips and Rapini greens... why don't we ever grow up on turnips that taste like this instead of the horrible mash our mothers made??  \n\nAfter so much amazing food, we didn't know if we could manage dessert but my friend was so adamant that we not ever leave Delfina without having at least *one* dessert we finally chose one to share.  We ordered the Lemon-Buttermilk Panna Cotta (with Strawberries and Thyme Caramel) and a glass of Comtess, a dessert wine with the flavour of peach nectar.  If I died right then and there, I would have died happy and in food orgasm heaven.  I have never had a dessert quite like this panna cotta, and the wine was the best I ever had.  Ever.  \n\nHave I sold it yet?  If not, there is no hope for you.  If you love Italian food, good wine, pasta, and desserts to die for, this is the place to go.  What are you waiting for?  GO NOW.

Delfina was at the top of the list, so for my husband's birthday, I figured, why not?\n\nThe 2-star review isn't because the food was bad.  Everything was certainly edible and the service was great.  But the price plus the reputation made us expect something far, far better than what we got. \n\nAmbiance is noisy and confusing, but that's just standard for trendy SF spots.  Fine.  The menu of course is entirely in Italian.  I'm a savvy enough girl that usually I'm fine with sussing out what I'm ordering at fine eateries, but Delfina is the kinda place where you have to either know Italian or be comfortable with the waiter explaining nearly every menu item to you, which is a but embarrassing.  It makes you feel like a rube.  \n\nThese qualms would not have detracted from a 5-star rating if the food deserved it, though.  But it didn't.  We started with the \"spec\" which was an appetizer of a cured pork meat with raw artichokes and salad.  It was fine but not amazing.  We also had what was basically a savory flan/custard of stinging nettle and black trumpet mushrooms.  Easily the best dish we had there, just delicious.  But at a restaurant with this kind of rep and these kinds of prices, everything should be this delicious.\n\nI ordered the Spaghettini Nero, which had squid ink and \"Mendocino Uni\" which was misleading.  The tiny piece of uni was the only thing with any flavor in the dish.  The rest was OK, but bland and disappointing.  My husband ordered the Hawaiian Ahi which managed to be undercooked - even for a lightly \"seared\" ahi - while still being dry!  And flavorless!  \n\nWe also had a side of brussels sprouts, misnamed on the menu as \"brussel sprouts\".  Whatever, but still kinda funny.  They were delicious, but way salty, which was weird given that everything else was undersalted.\n\nI just don't get the hype, especially when our bill with tax and tip was $165 for two people.  Our server was helpful and recommended a great wine, but without him we would have had no idea what to order as almost all the wines are esoteric Italian wines I haven't heard of - and I'm not super ignorant when it comes to wine, either.\n\nMaybe if I was a big fan of classic Italian food I would have loved this place, but I'm not.

Countless people have told me they call it their favorite so my expectations were understandably high.

As such, it's going to be shorter than usual, as the menu has changed since then and my memory stinks. :-\\\n\nI was immediately charmed upon entering Delfina; the multitude of small lighting fixtures hanging from the ceiling created an ambiance of intimacy and threw just the right amount of light. We were shown to a corner table near the kitchen, which gave a great view of the space.\n\nOur server was friendly and down-to-earth, which combined with the casual elegance of the place further helped to make us feel instantly welcome. I remember feeling completely at ease and very happy to be there, though it was our first visit.\n\nWe each had a glass of Prosecco, which is getting close to de rigueur status as our aperitif of choice. The bread that they served was very good, as you'd expect. I imagine that we had one or two appetizers, but I don't recall what they were. For entrees, my wife had the crab risotto (which was a special that night), and I had the roasted Fulton Valley Chicken, with king trumpet mushrooms and olive oil mashed potatoes. The entire meal was very good, the chicken being wonderfully flavored and succulent.\n\nI remember that a member of the staff (perhaps our server) graciously helped me select a wine to go with my meal. They asked if I preferred Old World or New. I said Old, and that I was leaning towards a Barbaresco. We discussed a few different options, and they brought out three samples, including a Barbaresco and a Barolo. I found the Barbaresco to be very medicinal, but the Barolo was a revelation. It's great to discover a new wine that you just love, and that Barolo fit the bill perfectly.\n\nI believe that we skipped the desert, having had just the right amount of food, feeling sated but not stuffed. The cost that night came to about one bill, plus tip. Fairly average in this town.\n\nWe left Delfina that night having had a great experience and agreeing to come back again soon. It's a wonderful spot with great ambiance, very good food and friendly service. Truly marvy.", "author": "Steve R."}

At least not from the outside. They should put clearer signs up, lest some moron (read: ME) wander into the wrong place by mistake.\n\nBut enough about that. Let's bitch about the food.\n\nButters and I shared an order of the calamari. (Side note: I'm generally averse to calamari, after an incident in Thailand years ago, where my stomach got into a fight with some undercooked calamari. Long story short: the damned squid won).\n\nWhere was I? Oh, right: we ordered up a batch of Davy Jones' beard. It was actually really good. It didn't have the annoying rubbery texture that calamari usually does. It went well with the warm bean salad that came with it. And yes: the time after the meal was delightfully agony-free.\n\nSecond item: we shared a small order of the spaghetti. When they say \"small\", they are not kidding. If you choose to order this as your main course, you had better be either under 4 feet tall or planning to visit Burger King on your way home. But since it was just one course, it worked OK for us.\n\nFor Secondi, Butters had the Meyer Ranch steak. I had the lamb, rare, with couscous. I'm not normally a big fan of it, but this one worked for me. The Chianti I selected went quite well with it. Butters likes his steak, though he pined for a bit more of it on the plate. I guess he didn't appreciate me \"safety-checking\" the food.

A few knobs of liver, chicken fat, and cubes of bread were skewered and then grilled; finished with aged balsamic vinegar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-12-23", "description": "I've had an absolutely hellish 2 weeks. I've had to deal with moving my company,  working on very little sleep, one of my good friends has decided he's going back to the East Coast indefinitely, and the only girl that's managed to unearth my abandoned, scarred heart, subsequently broke it to pieces. It wasn't the way I wanted to start the holiday season and all I wanted to do was crawl into my bed and die. \n\nI have a group of friends that meet every year around the same time, to exchange gifts, have a good meal, and see each other before we all go our separate ways until the new year. I felt so crushed, I almost didn't go this year. My last ounce of will however said that I should surround myself with my friends, and not discard the tradition that we had built.\n\nWith one of my friends having had moved into the Mission recently, it was decided that we'd go to Delfina to celebrate in the neighborhood. Since I was in no shape to drive I traveled with a few friends, who are usually notoriously late. Amazingly, we somehow managed to be early, get parking right in front of the restaurant, and find that our table was set and ready to go. I don't know who's karma was in effect here but it definitely wasn't mine.\n\nAs we walked into the restaurant, we found a modern, bustling dining room, with a small bar area to the right, a counter that intersects the room, and the main dining room to the left. We were fortunate to have  a table right next to the large windows in the front. As we waited for a couple of people to show we were greeted by our waitress. She noted a few changes on the menu and items they were low on, so that they could set it aside if you were indeed interested in ordering it. So we started off with a bottle of the Dolcetto (although I wished they had a full bar - I was ready for some hard stuff) and a trio of appetizers. The rest of our group showed up and we proceeded to order the rest of our meal.\n\nOur appetizers were as follows:\n\n-Beef carpaccio with radicchio, parmigiano, and capers\n-Salt cod mantecato with walnut oil and fennel seed flatbread\n-Bitter greens, pancetta, walnuts, parmigiano and balsamic vinaigrette\n\nThe carpaccio came thinly cut, with a salty kick from the cheese and capers. I wasn't too crazy about the radicchio but others at the table really enjoyed it. The greens had a great vinaigrette with the texture and flavors from the pancetta/walnuts being a pleasant surprise. Salt cod is something I'll almost always order if I see it on the menu and this one didn't disappoint. Not too salty, good firmness, and an interesting flavor contrast with the fennel flatbread.\n\nAs my own food sidebar I aw something called Tripe Fiorentina, which was tripe in a tomato based sauce, baked with bread crumbs on top (almost an Italian Menudo). This was excellent and I think I was the only person in the restaurant that ordered it, but then I draw the line somewhere around Fear Factor so tripe doesn't really bother me.\n\nFor the entrees, there were several orders of the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, and mushrooms;  flatiron steak and fries; and the slow roasted pork shoulder with  farro grain and cippolini onions (which the server set aside for me).  The pork shoulder was exquisitely tender, with the farro and onions in some sort of vegetable sauce which I couldn't quite discern but was very tasty. I never tried the steak but the fries were made with sage which gave them a slight complexity. The chicken was moist and also fairly flavorful with it's gravy but I wish it had a crispier skin. I also didn't try the mashed potatoes but was told by  the group that they came lukewarm but still tasty.\n\nWith the group I was with we are always bound to have dessert and tonight was going to be no exception.  Between us, we managed to sample the panna cotta, bundino (a bread-like cake), bittersweet chocolate cake and ginger/walnut gelati. I'd have to say all the desserts were fairly intriguing and tasty but nothing really blew my mind. But then I'm not much of a dessert person so I might not be the best opinion on these things.\n\nOur waitress and other servers were all quite excellent amongst the bustling diners and we were well taken care of. There was a table of native Italians right behind us and sometimes, as I was trying to eavesdrop on their conversation, it made me feel like we were in a trattoria transported to the Mission. I'd say overall this was a 4.5 stars for the service was excellent and they make simple food wonderfully. Little drawbacks like the lukewarm potatoes are an easy fix and if this were my neighborhood, I'd definitely drop in from time to time. \n\n I'm glad I didn't stay in and sulk.

It's casual and the prices are actually reasonable.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I only reserve that for absolute perfection and they kind of blew it on the desserts in my opinion.  Still excellent overall experience though!\n\nHere's a run-down of what we ordered:\nCauliflower Soup - creamy perfection with a paprika oil drizzled over it.  \n\nSpaghettini w/ Dungeness crab - this dish was outstanding and really let the crab flavor shine through.  (Crab is still in season of course).   Perfectly cooked pasta.\n\nGnocchi al Ragu - excellent pillows in a savory meat sauce.  I thought it was just ok and so did my friend (who is a Ragu expert)\n\nShortribs Stracotto w/ polenta - Delicious, fall off the bone goodness.  The sauce was fantastic and the polenta was good and creamy.  Although I did think the polenta was a bit bland for this dish and would have added some sort of nutty cheese or something if it were my kitchen :-)\n\nChocolate Torta - I can't remember the exact name of this dessert, but it was supposed to have orange in there that never came through.  It was basically a very moist chocolate pudding cake.  It was just ok, it needed something in my opinion.  Flour & Water has them beat on the desserts.\n\nProfiteroles - totally blew it here (at least in my and my friend's opinion).  I make profiteroles at home, so I may be a bit of a harsh critic.  The espresso ice cream completely overpowered the profiteroles and what really turned both of us off was how heavy handed they were w/ the almonds.  It looks like they took a handful and dumped them on top.  The server actually noticed and removed the dish from our bill.  That was excellent service in my opinion.  \n\nOverall terrific experience and would come again to try other items on the menu.  But I'll hit some other restaurants first :-)", "author": "Alison E."}

My dining companions however, had a wonderful experience trying the food.

If I'm being honest with myself, it has only left because I have failed to go with regularity.  Each return visit propels it back into the top end of my favorites.\n\nI'm a self-described sucker for fresh pasta, and Delfina  has some of the best you can have.  On the most recent trip, we had an unbelievable preparation of al dente spaghetti with a mullet botarga (think dried fish roe) and dried peporcinies.   It was really unusual, but succeeded on every level.  Every visit there is a dish like this, that just blows me away.\n\nIf you haven't been, you are punishing yourself for no reason.

That wont matter at all, the restaurant is one of those way over rated San Francisco restaurants that people rave about and flock to. Our friends were in town for a long weekend so my girlfriend and I chose Delfina since neither of us have been there and I suppose I wanted to see whether the restaurants great reputation precedes itself. \nWell it didnt, not to me. \n\nThe food was decent, really nothing special at all. You can't really go wrong with the appetizers. We ordered the beat salad, the calamari and the olives. All good, not great. The main dishes we ordered was the fish, the steak, and the chicken. The fish (which I ordered) was truly disappointing. It was served cold, the sauce was bland, it was over cooked and lacked anything exciting, interesting, or different from a $30 dish that you would expect. The steak was a steak, cooked just as it was ordered. The chicken was good, my girlfriend and another friend both ordered it and loved it. The wine list is extensive and of course expensive, something expected at a restaurant of this caliber, they were sold out of our two first choices, so we took the servers recommendation and I wish we hadn't. \n\nThe owners of this restaurant opened Locanda not long ago which is FANTASTIC and of course one of the best in town, Pizzaria Delfina, both of which I would recommend to anyone, but in my book, Delfina fails.", "author": "Benny C."}

The food is what I've always imagined it to be: deliciously and freshly made with the perfect portion. We started off with the grilled calamari on top of warm bean salad, Rosemary Tagliatelle (duck giblets and aged balsamic) very rich in flavor, also spaghettinini in Nero (squid ink pasta with uni on top) perfect balance of flavors. Ambiance is very soft and intimate but not too pretentious. Servers were very friendly and had their own character.  \n\nChowed down Tartine bread. That's always a plus.

The waitress was very apologetic and came back with a much better version. That night I had a duck leg that sucked, frankly, but by the time I made my final judgment, I had eaten enough of it that I didn't want to bother complaining. \n\nOther dishes to avoid: the reconstituted dried salt cod (bland as sand); some quail dish with greens that was too salty and oily. \n\nHere's what you must have. \n*Any pasta or risotto with nettle; they do this oh-so-well. \n*Shortribs stracatto: three mountainous shortribs in a complex sauce, perfectly accompanied by a side of cheesy polenta. \n*Bucatini \"in Salsa\": that salsa is an awesome combination of sardines and Calabrian chiles. A lovely flavor that is hard to come by in SF. \n*Quail egg ravioli in brown butter sage sauce. Had this on New Year's Eve 2005 or so. \n\nLast, beware that their olive oil sucks (bitter aftertaste) but their butter is excellent.

I wish SF had more consistently satisfying restaurants. Ok to be fair, I used to get special treatment and last minute reservations when a friend worked here and they sent me extra desserts...easiest way to win me over. But the quality-price ratio here really is amazing. My lamb was perfectly tender and seasoned and we couldn't stop raving about our food. My vegetarian friend loved her food as well. We also splurged and added shaved white truffles to a simple pasta dish to share as an appetizer - best (and most expensive) pasta I've had outside of Italy. And did I mention they serve Tartine bread? Refills, please!\n\nI did have one less than stellar experience with the ribs last time- a little dry for my tastes but the rest of the meal made up for it.\n\nAlso, the service is great here. Super friendly and hip. Sometimes a bit over enthusiastic but understandable when everything on the menu is that good. The walk-in table means a reasonable wait if you didn't reserve a month ahead.

The chefs clearly take pride in the tasty and attractive dishes they prepare.  Be sure to order the Tartine bread.  The Tartine (bakery is three doors away) sourdough and house-cultured butter are the area's best.  The Corn Sformatino is a very tasty starter.  This corn and shrimp appetizer are not to be missed.  It literally melts in your mouth.  Be sure to share.  We also shared a side of spaghetti.  The pasta is not locally made, but you could have fooled us.  Genuine Italian spaghetti noodles tossed in a mild, but flavorful marinara.  For my entree, I had the quail and warm bread salad.  The quail was cooked perfectly - tender and most meat with outstanding flavor.  The warm bread salad paired well with the quail.  A combination of arugula and marinated jumbo croutons, the salad was a perfect complement to the meat.

Ever since I moved to the city, I've heard how I HAVE to go to Delfina because the food is amazing. \n\nBut alas, amazing it is not.  Ok is more like it.  It's pretty disappointing considering the pizza is so good:(  \n\nWe ordered the fried artichoke to start, then shared the salmon with white beans, the spaghetti with plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and peperoncini and the Fregnacce with Louisiana white shrimp.  In a word, we were underwhelmed.  \n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\nArtichoke:  Pretty good!  I liked how the leaves are the texture of chips (but lighter) and the heart was delicious.  I would recommend it.  Squeeze lemon on it, but not too much!  The flavor can hold its own without all the lemon they give you.\n\nThe salmon: I hate salmon, so I can't, in good faith, review it, but even my salmon-loving companion thought it was just ok.\n\nFregnacce:  This came highly recommended by the waitress, which is a shame.  The texture of the pasta was AWESOME, don't get me wrong.  I really liked how it was al dente and thin like lasagna noodles (but smaller).  Had the sauce and shrimp had a better flavor, I would have loved this dish.  Alas, the sauce and shrimp were kind of... fishy.  Definitely not how you want your pasta to taste.  My dinner date seriously disliked this dish, I was merely indifferent.\n\nSpaghetti:  This was admittedly pretty good, but VERY basic.  It doesn't scream high end restaurant because you could get the same spaghetti elsewhere for less.  I ended up eating this instead of my fregnacce because it was my favorite of the things we ordered.  That said, I think I make better spaghetti.\n\nAll in all, we liked Delfina's ambiance and service, but could definitely pass on the food, especially given the price (our meal cost us $100, pre-tip, with 1 glass of wine apiece).

The calamari appetizer left us speechless and took us back to Rome!   The Ragu was fresh and comforting .  The Brodetto Anconese was made in seafood heaven.   I am no wine connaisseur, but my Pinot was one of the best wines I'v ever had, subtle and mature .  The Plum Ricotta Desert was a delight!!!\n\nThe service was flawless.  I wish someone was following our waitress with a video camera for training purposes.\n\nThank you Delfina and see you soon!", "author": "Y B."}

I finally made it to Delfina, and the bread alone was worth the trip. The menu states that the bread is available upon request, so request it immediately! There are two kinds of bread that are served with a square of butter with salt sprinkled over it- I think both are variations of sourdough, and both were delicious!  \n\nThe server highly recommended the calamari, which she claimed they were known for while showing us the Delfina logo that had a cute little calamari on it, and the corn basil soup. The calamari got mixed reviews at our table, but I have to say that I am a fan. It's fresh calamari- I believe it was roasted, not breaded and fried, which may have thrown some naysayers off- but it came in a herb-y sauce over some sort of legume with some greens and olives on the plate. The soup was an overall hit- a pureed green soup that had a bunch of flavor and sweetness from the corn. \n\nThe real treat, however, was the short ribs. Super tender and flavorful- a good combo with the polenta that came with it. The portions are really tiny, so I would recommend getting at least one app or one pasta with a main dish. The gnocci was decent, but somewhat soggy, like it had been left out for a while. The spaghetti was a disappointment- it was bland and not worth the extra carbs. Although, the noodles were interestingly thick and perfectly al dente. \n\nThe drinks menu is just wine and beer, but I loved the bellini! There was even a slice of nectarine in it, which tasted so good after being soaked in bubbly.", "author": "Janet H."}

We shared 1 portion but I definitely could have had a whole plate of this. \n4) Braised pork cheek - had some smoky bbq flavors to it, strong reduction sauce, a little bit too salty, very tasty spring onions. \n5) Panna Cotta with candied kumquats.

I like the innovative spin they put on the usual Italian fare - pasta with squid ink, copa di testa, pork belly or tripe. \n\nBut i can only review what I had last night: \n\nCopa di testa - it was explained to us as cheese made out of pork (what?!). Turns out it's sausage like goodness, that's made out of pork pieces in pork broth and then set to jell-o style. It was served with marinated onions, which complemented the dish perfectly (only complaint is that there were 3 tiny pieces). \n\nSpeck - cured ham, prosciutto-like served with shaved artichokes and arugula. This was very delicious, right combination of salty and peppery. \n\nGrilled fresh calamari - very well executed, the only problem was that we had it right after all these bold flavors and it seemed a little bland. \n\nFor our entrees we chose pasta dishes: \n\nSpaghetti with plum tomatoes - nice sauce that has a kick, the only complaint was that the pasta was kind of gummy (that's why i took 1 star off) as if it was cooked in a little water or water that has a lot of starch in it (that's what happens when restaurant reuse water other pasta has been cooked in) \n\nSpaghetti con ragu - sauce was amazing!! we almost licked the plate:) \n\nService - very good, although we had to ask for the bread ourselves. \n\nBread - WOW!

Our decision to eat here was kind of spontaneous so I wasn't sure if we would be able to get a table without a reservation.  We showed up at 5:30 (the beginning of their dinner service) and we were seated right away.  \n\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant was very nice and relaxed.  Our servers were very prompt, polite and pleasant. They were very helpful in suggesting wine to pair with our dinners and didn't seem in any rush to get our entree order so the table could be used again after us.  Neither of us frequent fine Italian restaurants and needed to ask about some of the items on the menu and our server was very nice in explaining what they were.\n\nWe started with an appetizer of whole grilled prawns which had a lemon butter sauce.  The prawns perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazingly flavorful.  \n\nWe then ordered the small spaghetti  to share.  The noodles were perfectly al dente and the sauce was a simple and wonderful fresh tomato and basil.  The portion was just enough to fully enjoy the flavors and the experience of eating the spaghetti without filling up too much before the entrees.  \n\nThe main course was grilled stake for my wife and I had the chicken.  Each was perfectly cooked and seasoned.\n\nDesert was ecstasy.  It consisted of perfectly ripe and roasted peaches topped with creme fraiche between two amazing pistachio cookies.  It was so good that my wife almost started crying.\n\nThis is definitely one of the restaurants we will come back to around our anniversary.

I had their salad with fresh figs and walnuts to start. The figs were so ripe and perfect it was delicious. We also had their crostini with pork rillette (forgot their Italian name for this). At first we were like, these are kind of tiny. But once you ate it you knew why. The flavors were so fatty and rich, it was better off eating little of it so you can savor it without feeling overwhelmed by the pork fat. For the main entree, I had their Mint Tagliatelle with porcini mushrooms. This was AMAZING! The mint that was worked into the pasta was not overwhelming, but just right and cooked to perfection. The porcini mushrooms were so fresh and full of fragrance.  The sauce that it was cooked in wasn't too salty, everything was perfect. I highly recommend this dish. I haven't had anything like this.\n\nThe other amazing dish I had was my friend's Spaghetti. You'd think how much more special can you make spaghetti with tomatoes and garlic right? Well, this one was amazing. To be exact, it says on the menu that they put plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and peperoncini in the dish. I felt like this when I first had Via Veneto's bolognese in Santa Monica. You took one fork full and you were like WOW. I don't know what they do to it to make it so exploding with flavor but Delfina did some magic to it. Don't shy away from this simple dish because there's nothing simple about the flavors. There's an amazing layering of perfect flavors in there, you HAVE to try it. \n\nThe Bucatini was good but didn't blow me away. That's probably why I already forgot what was in it. \n\nTo be honest, their desserts weren't really worth writing about. But I didn't care cuz their pasta dishes were amazing.

The atmosphere is certainly pleasant, although if you are sitting on the wooden benches along the walls, not very comfortable.  The service is accomplished and friendly, an air of contentment permeates the entire place.\n\nThe perfectly grilled Monterrey Bay sardines with caponata certainly lived up to the highest expectations - the sweetness of the impeccably fresh fish delightfully balanced by the slightly vinaigry eggplant and onion mixture.  Of the same high standard were the roasted chicken with mushrooms and very rich mashed potatoes and the saltimbocca with a wonderful polenta.  \n\nWhere things went (unexpectedly) awry was with the pasta dishes.  The spaghetti with tomato sauce were oddly gummy, as if cooked in water that was not hot enough - an unpleasant consistency that was almost shocking for a restaurant of this caliber.  While most versions of pasta fagioli are a heady mix of beans and pasta, Delfina's version was more a smooth bean puree soup, with a few errant little strips of (a bit overcooked) pasta floating forlornly in it.

Didn't matter anyways because we were all running late so we changed changed it to Beretta at 9pm... 2 and a half hour wait (on a side note: I've never heard of a restaurant telling anyone it's a 2 and a half hour wait. It sounded kind of ridiculous. You would think that they would say the next reservation is available at 11:30pm?). I didn't mind anyways because now it was my chance to suggest the one restaurant that I've been wanting to go to all along... Delfina!! We called them and made their earliest reservations... 10pm. Funny thing is, we didn't all arrive to the place until 9:30-9:45 anyways.\n\nDelfina has been on top of my to-do list ever since Kelsey E.'s \"rave\" (pun-intended) reviews of this place. For a party of four, we ordered the calamari, burrata, sardines, tagliatelle, gnocchi, rabitt, lamb, pana cotta, a chocolate dessert, and two bottles of wine (this is not including the after meal digestives and dessert wine). Kelsey E. recommended the calamari, burrata, tagliatelle, and pana cotta. I wonder if these boys knew what they had cut out for themselves when they promised to treat us to this meal?\n\nAnyways, everything was delicious, but my stand out favorites were the tagliatelle, sardines, and pana cotta... and the wine of course. The tagliatelle with mint was unbelievable. It was a combination of flavors that I wold have NEVER thought I'd enjoy. Hmmm cream and mint... delicious! The sardines were also a surprise. Sardines are used often in Korean stews, but I had never had them prepared like this before. I don't want to say they were breaded, but I'm not sure of the exact preparation of them. They came with a couple grilled limes to squeeze on top... mmm... mmm! I'm not a big orange girl, but I'm so glad I took Kelsey E's suggestion and ordered the pana cotta. Possibly one of the best dessert's I've ever had.\n\nAll in all... it was one of the best dinners EVER!

Let me preface that I came to this restaurant with high expectations...heard oodles of great reviews.  Overall, I was a tad bit disappointed.  \n\nLet me begin with the service.  I came on a Friday late dinner (9pm, to be exact) with a party of three.  Luckily, there were just two parties ahead of us, so the wait was simply 15 minutes.  For having no reservations, we were stoked!  The server was very friendly, but the wait to get their attention took FOREVER.    \n\nThe food was good, but nothing that leaves me speechless.  The bread was delicious!  Figures it was going to be good, since it was from Tartine....mmmm!!!  I never pass up on the complimentary starch platter to start off the meal. :)  We started off with two appetizers....the grilled calamari with white beans (that was AMAZING!!!) and the insalata di campo (good, but nothing to really write home about).  For the main course, I ordered the papardelle w/pork suigo & piquillo peppers.    The flavors were GOOD, but not exciting.  I was a tad bit disappointed with the portion of the dish.  I don't expect portions similar to cheap chain italian restaurants like Olive Garden and such, but I felt like I was skimped a bit.  \n\nThe ambiance was calm for the most part, but we sat close to the open kitchen where you can hear some of the commotion.     \n\nWould I come back?  Perhaps, but I'll make sure the next time, I eat plenty of the Tartine bread or order more appetizers to help fill this large belly of mine!", "author": "Emily A."}

For a casual place, Delfina went out of its way to make us happy.  It is a busy restaurant, and they made us wait for half an hour for our reservation; however, the hostess and the manager each came and sincerely apologized to us.  What surprised us was they really tried to make up for the wait time by serving up an extra appetizer and an extra pasta for our meal.  That's when you know they care about you.  \n\nThe menu looks deceptively simple.  Each dish is tersely listed as just the principal ingredient with one or two accompaniments.  Yet the flavors are complex and well-developed.  \n\nIn particular, the Paccheri with Pacific true cod was the star.  What a creative pasta with unique flavor: cod pieces cooked to resemble bay scallops, and a tomato and fennel sauce that's tangy, savory and a little licoricey sweet all at the same time - nothing I've had anywhere else.\n\nGrilled calamari, Involtini (cabbage-wrapped meat roll) and Spaghetti were all great.  However, the Berkshire pork fell flat, as the meat was dry from overcooking or from sitting around for too long.  \n\nDesserts: the Rice Pudding and the Black Pepper Panna Cotta made a tasty finish to the meal.  Again, deceptively simple.  The Rice Pudding was actually made with rice stored with white truffles - delicious!  The Panna Cotta was creamy but well-balanced with the sweet and tart balsamic strawberry sauce.  The black pepper flavor didn't really come out, but I'm ok with that. \n\nHad a great time, and I really commend the excellent staff and service.", "author": "Thomas L."}

A week ahead and there were only three available times: 5:30, 8:30 and 10pm. \"Ooh. Eight, I'll take eight.\" I say quickly like it's going to be snatched away any minute.\n\nOkay, so that's annoying but this is really about the food and the pricing. Our appetizers were great. I loved the mixed green salad with pancetta and my fiance was really happy with the squid salad. After that, it was all downhill.\n\nMy chicken was dry and the mushroom sauce was tasteless. My boyfriend swore his puny rabbit had Knorr sauce on it. I asked for beans instead of potatoes and the butter beans had zero seasoning. None of the entrees came with green vegetables so we had to order them separately, which seriously increases the price of the meal. Not everyone wants bread AND potatoes or beans. There is a serious lack of creativity on the menu. Find something else to pair with protein.\n\nSome people would call Delfina's style of cuisine, simple. I would NOT be one of those people. I would call it ridiculously simple. I'm a modest cook, but could have cooked those entrees at home for 1/15 the $210 price tag.\n\nThen - because we had a gift certificate - we ordered dessert. Disappointing dessert. What's wrong with all you pannecotta lovers? Zero texture and sweetest syrup *thing* ever. Ick (My favorite food is Skittles, so when something is too sweet for me, it is INEDIBLE to my fiance.) And then there was the pineapple upside-down cake. Ugh. Totally sour and hard to eat. It was like trying to eat a soggy croissant with a spoon. (I just threw up in my mouth thinking about the texture.) Our desserts went 80% uneaten.\n\nAnd then the service. Our waiter made a lap through the dining room every four minutes, and was impossible to make eye-contact with since he only looked at tables and not at faces. He didn't even ask us how we liked the desserts. He circled by 4 times without clearing the plates even though we had our utensils in pick-up position.\n\nAt $70, this would have been a 3-star restaurant; at $210, it's a neighborhood rip-off.", "author": "Ana D."}

Since it was also their anniversary, we got a free \"splash\" of prosecco to start the dinner, though it was more like a half-glass...win!  \n\nSince I was getting pasta, I wanted some meat for the appetizer, so I went for the Carne Crudo.  The meat was really good and I loved the celery root that went with it.  Celery root is officially one of my favorite vegetables ever.

The pasta was warm and eggy and cheesy and buttery...the perfect backdrop for the truffle to shine.  I kept ooh-ing and aah-ing so much while the chef was shaving the truffle (it smelled sooo damn good) I think he took pity on me and gave me a little extra.  Score!  It probably helped that we were there on a late reservation on the final night of their truffle dinners.  Hubby got some pasta with meat on it but I didn't even try it since I was all over the truffle.\n\nFor dessert, we shared a tasting of their cheeses, which included Robiola Due Latti, Brescianella, Caprioago, Red Cow Parmigiano Reggiano, and Point Reyes Farmstead Blue.  My favorite cheese was probably the parmigiano-reggiano...it was just so salty and nutty and flavorful...probably the best parmigiano I've ever had.  Where can I buy this stuff?

We have enjoyed Locanda, but wanted to try someplace new. \nTwo of the table's six dishes should not have been served. We were seated at 7 and told that there was one special, and only one left--roasted duck. Now that I think about it, it's odd to run out of a special at 7 pm. About 20 minutes later I asked if it was still available and was told yes, because only our table had been told about it. I have no idea if any of this is relevant to the fact that it arrived dry, tough, and salty. I definitely understand that salty is subjective, but not dry and tough. And it was served with half a plate of dry sauerkraut. Again, perhaps some diners like this version of sauerkraut. I will stand by the conviction that the duck was almost uneatable. The other dish that should not have left the kitchen was pork shoulder (heritage pork) slow cooked. It was also dry and tough plus had an exceptional amount of fat--which you would think would make it moist.. But it wasn't. At least the farro and mashed potatoes served with it were good and if eaten concurrent with the pork helped moisten it.

Delfina, even after this long you are still the restaurant to which I compare all other restaurants in the City. Why? It's simple - you are the epitome of what you are trying to be.\n\nLet me explain. You're not, nor are you trying to be a Michael Mina or the Dining Room at the Ritz - you're not serving cuisine worthy of the Bocuse d'Or and you're not about to offer up a 9 course tasting menu with a wine pairing. You're also not trying to blend in with your Mission neighbors by offering cheap, quick food for hipsters on the go. \n\nYou are an upscale, neighborhood restaurant (that has clearly garnered much fame outside the neighborhood) that finds the essence of traditional, regional Italian preparations and uses our local, seasonal ingredients to put a modern, updated spin on those dishes. Your food and atmosphere are not arrogant or exaggerated; you're also not stuffy and quiet. You're a lively, busy, friendly fine-dining establishment run by people that love what they do and want to make great food. That's the kind of restaurant that you're trying to be, and I don't believe there is any dining establishment in SF that fulfills their role as well as you. \n\nWhile some dishes are always available, the menu changes nightly, giving you the chance to go back over and over again and try something new. I've had almost everything on the menu, and there has not been a single dish that hasn't made me say \"Wow, that's delicious.\" My personal favorites (aside from the fresh bread from Tartine!) are the GRILLED FRESH SQUID, the BURRATA when it's on the menu, the various preparations of their rosemary TAGLIATELLE, the AGNOLOTTI (again in many different ways), and the veal SWEETBREADS. And of course as I said in my previous review, this is a place where skipping dessert should be a crime - the buttermilk PANNA COTTA is mind-blowing, as is the CHOCOLATE TORTA with olive oil gelato. Both of those dishes inspired me to try them myself,  and although I did them really well, I think Delfina would still win that throw-down.\n\nWhat's really amazing is that if you read through all 700+ yelp reviews, almost every diner has had completely different meals, but each reviewer has amazing things to say about almost every item. Delfina doesn't just do 1 dish well, they do every dish well on a constantly changing menu, every time. It's fairly shocking to me that, unlike the James Beard Foundation, Michelin hasn't recognized Delfina with a star - something that will hopefully change in the next publication.\n\nAs far as the service is concerned, it's always impeccable. The servers are there when you need them, engaging, attentive, and control the pace of the meal perfectly - everything you could expect out of a well-trained, tight-knit staff. Also, unlike many successful executive chefs, the owner, Craig Stoll, is in the restaurant almost every night. I have been lucky enough to speak with him at length a few times now, and he is one of the friendliest, warmest restaurant owners I've ever come across; the depth of his culinary knowledge and experiences is fascinating, and it's just simply obvious that he loves what he does. \n\nCraig, and everyone else involved with this restaurant, thank you for so many wonderful experiences, and for setting the standard for what fine-dining in San Francisco should be.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

So many 5-star reviews. You walk out of this place and you feel like you've had a special night out. (Unlike Farina where you feel like you've been the victim of a financial hate crime)\n\nEach dish is well-conceived, very tasty, and exactly what you were promised on the menu. And as you read the menu, you just want to try everything. No strange experimental food, no bizarre ingredients. Everything looks fantastic.\n\nThe servers are friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, and attentive.\n\nThe place is a bit noisy and crowded, but it has a vibrant feel and it is truly reflective of a modern San Francisco dining sensibility.

The pasta was excellent, main meat course good but would probably just get the pasta next time.  The decor is okay.  Atmosphere more casual with some tables very close the wait area or under a eat-in-bar (what's with that?  who wants to eat with other people eating right above your head?).\n\nA good place for a nice but casual meal but definitely not a fancy restaurant for those special occasions.\n\nUpdate: last time I saved Delfina's for a special occasion.  Everyone raved about what a good restaurant it was and I made reservations weeks in advance.  Needless to say, though Delfina's was good, it wasn't worth all that effort.\n\nThis time, we just dropped by during a weekday because we were too tired to cook and were given a $75 gift certificate.  It was Tuesday.  We were able to not only get seating but actual table at 7 PM with no reservation.  Food was fantastic this time.  Gravlox okay.  Spaghettini w/ squid ink (spicy!) was great.  Braised pork w/ lentils very tender and awesome.  Dessert was okay.  The waitstaff was also very friendly and efficient.  I had tried to come the preceding Monday as well but got sneered at by the hostess, when I asked about a table because they were booked up until 9:30 PM with an hour wait for the bar (on a Monday???).  \n\nStarters are around $9.  Pastas avg $15.  Secondi (meat) course avg $20+.  For two people with a shared starter, main courses (ind), shared dessert, and two beers - bill was just under $70.  Wine is expensive with the cheapest option at $26.\n\nI will reiterate that this is not the sort of place you should save up money or save for a special occasion.  You will be disappointed.  There is no privacy at your table and you will have to shout to be heard.  Sit next to interesting people if you can as their conversation will be more entertaining.  However, as a nice place to drop by if you live in the neighborhood, the food can't be beat.\n\nAlso Tuesday seems to have less wait and nicer staff.  I thought I read somewhere that you should avoid nice restaurants on weekend because they are so full and also full of \"weekenders\" (aka tourists and those that come into the city for special occasions) and instead patronize them on weekdays when the regulars do.\n\nAfter this I'm going to upgrade them to 3.5 stars.  They'd get more if the food and staff weren't so hit and miss.\n\nBike Parking: designated bike racks on 18th St.", "author": "Jean K."}

My last visit was definitely more enjoyable.\n\nI am a sardine person and I loved the grilled sardines. There is nothing fancy about this plate, but they did everything right - crispy outside, soft inside, and boneless.\n\nInsalata di Campo was simple and fresh. However, too much balsamic vinegar was added in preparation.\n\nPasta with Louisiana style shrimps was plain awesome. All ingredients were fresh and tasty. Pasta had a great bouncy texture, yet not chewy. Sauce comped with the pasta nicely - not too much and not too less.\n\nGrilled swordfish was quite impressive. It wasn't all dried up like most other grilled swordfish, and the meat wasn't all rough and tough.\n\nBonet Stratato was quite lovely. Cream was rich and smooth, not too sweet.\n\nFinal thought: If you don't like this place for the first time, it's okay, me too.

Started with the quintessential grilled calamari w/ white bean salad, a dish that helped put them on the map. I remember reading rave reviews about this dish years ago and there is good reason that it remains a menu staple. Sustainable calamari is quickly grilled imparting a nice smokiness to the still tender but toothsome squid. Lots of EVOO, perfectly cooked beans, and a nice hit of lemony acidity round out the dish. The baked Bellweather ricotta with charry grilled zucchini and pane pomodoro was also tasty, as we layered \"perfect bites\" of each component. \n\nHouse-made pasta is a must at Delfina. The tagliatelle combined surprisingly refreshing mint with fresh porcini mushrooms. To add some fatty goodness to the meal, we also split the Duroc pork Valdostana.

Their humility hides their brio. In San Francisco I can think of no better example than Delfina, a lovely, sunny, airy Italianate restaurant set in the somewhat scruffy Mission District. There is little showy about the space, although it is pleasing and airy, but the plates are modestly priced show-stoppers. \n\n I ordered Warm Ceringola Olives, meaty, green nuggets swimming in rustic olive oil, served with warm crusty bread (perhaps baked by the iconic Tartine Bakery next door?). Tonight San Francisco revealed its Mediterranean climate which these olives matched degree for degree.\n\n The olives were followed by a creamy cauliflower soup with paprika oil drizzled on top and cumin-scented croutons. The soup was redolent of flowerets, but needed the kick that the paprika and cumin provided. It was an exceptionally pretty bowl.\n\n Delfina's Hay and Straw Tagliarini with English Peas, Pecorino, Raw Egg Yolk, and a touch of Pancetta (or its moral equivalent) was as lush as one might imagine a spring plate could be. The green and white pasta was nettles and spinach (?). The richness of the cheese, cream, and egg played perfectly with the peas, creating a modernist carbonara. \n\n They also serve a superior Blood Orange Prosecco.\n\n All in all, a splendid moderately priced spring meal.

My wife and I hadn't been to Delfina for a couple of years, but we recently returned from Italy and it was my 50th birthday, so we wanted to eat at modern Italian restaurant that we knew was good. Everything was triple-wow; better than we had remembered from our previous visit, and we didn't have any better meals in Italy than we had here. \n\nI saved the menu so we know exactly what we had. We started with the Crostini Misti - a perfect trio with squab liver rustico, cavalo nero-pecorino, and white bean-bottarga. It seemed like a small meal in itself. I followed with the heirloom tomato salad with a delicious ricotta and pane bucato. It easily beat the Caprese salads I loved to eat so much in Italy. \n\nFor the main course I wanted to order the slow roasted pork shoulder (after seeing it brought to the next table), but since my wife ordered it, I went for the Paine farm squab served with ceci strasciacati, mustard greens, and rosemary-roasted grapes. We've eaten at many top flight restaurants like Masa's, Gary Danko, and Michael Mina, but I don't think I've ever had a better tasting bird than this one. The sauce, tender and flavorful meat, and accompaniments were all perfect. The pork shoulder was also terrific. I didn't save the desert menu, but we had some type of chocolate cake with a luscious moist center.\n\nThe bustling and lively, but still cozy ambiance was perfect. It amazed us that the place was already almost completely full at opening time (5:30PM), the only time we could get a reservation. Also the service was just right - timely and friendly. \n\nMy only gripe is that they could add a few more lower price options to the wine list.

I've had better Italian in SF, which is not the best city for Italian food. (Firenze by Night is far superior). We ordered an appetizer of warm olives. They were marginally better than the olives I buy in the refrigerator section at Trader Joe's. The salad was fine. And the pasta was tiny. That's all I remember. For years now, restaurants have served like 3 ravioli in a serving--but at least those are giant ravioli. It looked like my dish was plated to make it seem like there was more food than there actually was--I remember using the reverse technique when I was a kid and didn't want to finish my breakfast. Delfina was as convincing at making the claim that my entree would satisfy me as I was the time I hid my scrambled eggs on the floor (we didn't have a dog).

When we told one of the many people attending our table (between the runners, HOSTESS, actual waitress and others there were easily five) I was met with \"I will go check and see if it was supposed to be like that\" (needless to say I never heard back). Oooh the spaghetti comes....the server (not our waitress) \"the cheese is right behind me\". Neither she nor the cheese ever comes. (Time check - its about 6:30 and restaurant is maybe 3/4 full) Spagehetti is good but not as good as last time. Finally the main dish...by this point both us know that it will be sink or swim. The waitress informed us this would be a dish easy to split.. it wasn't. But what dissappointed us more was the BLAND taste of the pork. Throw in the mushy bed of beans (which were not bad) and I shook my head in disbelief. \nWhen the hostess (yes the hostess) came to clear the plates she asked how everything was and I told her not so great. No delving into specifics by her... just a uptick of the shoulders. The night was capped off as the bill arrived (after what seemed like an eternity) and the waitress tossed on our table a plate of penecotta. Was this a sign that they heard our unhappy tones? We will never know but the fact that it was flung with such anger and disregard for us spoke volumes.  Could not wait to leave. \n\nWhere is Bauer when you need a restaurant to witness a reality check?\n\n\nSubpar quality and service not worth my time or money.", "author": "C K."}

Came here on a Wednesday night around 6 so we didn't have any problems finding parking or getting seated. Was planning on going to the pizza joint next door but stopped one door too early. Great ambiance, friendly servers and hostess. Delicious bread from tartine next door and acme bread. Montepulciano red and pinot grigio rose very tasty.\n\nWe ordered grilled calamari to start. Came with white beans and some greens on top. Veery tasty. Not rubbery or overcooked, but flavorful. Also ordered gnocchi with porcini ragu and short ribs, which came with polenta. Loved the gnocchi, even though I don't like mushrooms. Short ribs were tender, nice balance of sweet and savory. Only bad note was that the short ribs were lukewarm at best when they came out. Plate was cold.\n\nOverall, food was tasty, but nothing special. A little overpriced (esp cold short ribs for $25) but maybe that's the norm in the neighborhood? Would rather try out other restaurants than come back as repeat. Service was great, would bump the rating to 3.5 if I could.

I have been to the pizzeria a few times, and they have always been consistently delicious. My husband and I were here for dinner a few nights ago, and were greeted very efficiently and warmly by our lovely waitress Georgia-what a sweetheart! We didnt see a single unsmiling face and the service from everyone was excellent- great vibes and good music-not to mention delicious meatballs and brussels sprouts- what more could you ask for?!? \n\n\nAs for Delfina itself- yes, the prices are steep, but for housemade pasta that tastes like it came right out of your extremely loud (but loving)  Italian grandmothers soup pot--well, there isnt anything quite like it. The quality of the ingredients used are obvious as soon as you take the first bite-- fresh, crisp and clean--but savory at the same time. One thing Delfina is not shy about is adding a LOT of flavor to all of their dishes, and being able to piece together flavors you would never imagine (chestnut pappardelle, anyone?) If you are feeling adventurous, the tripe is definitely something to try while there--from what i was told by our waitress, this dish has been on the menu since Delfina first opened--and for good reason! I honestly have nothing negative to say about this restaurant, except for the fact that all of the waitresses are WAY too pretty to go here for a first date--which is along the same gripes the other yelpers had about this place, too. :P Everyone was super friendly, efficient, and very knowledgeable about the food.

For dinner, we had the marscapone ravioli and the spaghetti.  Most of the yelp reviews I read mentioned the \"al dente\" quality of the spaghetti noodles, and I have to agree.  They were very chewy and delicious! (I'm very picky about my noodles).  The ravioli was presented very nicely and without a heavy sauce, which I like.  Each little bite burst with a lemon/butter flavor.\n\nThe dessert here was particularly good. The buttermilk panna cotta was PERFECT.

And unlike the dead ringer for Anoop from American Idol who hit on me at the bar last night, it's pretty easy to spot an impostor. \n\nDelfina has, hands down, the best entree in the city. Pork belly with sepia, cockles, and chickpeas, all sitting in a savory tomato-white wine broth. It was the ideal mix of sweet and salty, crunchy and chewy, and the broth (which I usually see as a throwaway part of any dish) was worthy of me asking for a spoon so I could drink the rest. \n\nAll things considered, it was a perfectly pleasant experience. While they did have an extensive wine list, they also had Peroni and Trumer Pilsner for $4/bottle. The waiter looked like James McAvoy, cute as can be, and was quite helpful, although a little hard to find at times. My vanity was appeased by the mirror on the wall facing us, which made it possible for me to a) make funny faces at my dining companion from across the room and b) scope out the potentially attractive gentlemen in the bar behind me. I'm all about the multitasking. \n\nNone of that really matters when there's a dish like that pork belly on the menu, though.

So as we passed by Delfina, I said, \"Oh hey, this restaurant looks easy... err I mean delicious, wanna try?\" \n\nMy hot date ordered the Ahi, I the kumquat duck, and we shared the full body artichoke appetizer.  The Ahi looked dry, but when I had a bite I realized I was completely mistaken.  I've often had other tart fixings (ala raspberry) with duck, but the kumquats were a surprising change.  Aside from being slightly undercooked, I thought the duck faired pretty well compared to  the duck I've had at countless other places: sweet and tender with a crispy skin with nothing over powering but the slight tang of the kumquat.\n\nI really like duck.  I once tried to hunt one with a six inch navy seal knife at a campsite.  I felt kind of stupid stalking it; but boy, I could only think about how good it would have been roasting over the camp fire.\n\nWe finished each other off with the dolci oranges and caramel.  Now that was quite the treat.  It was a real kind of nom-nom-nom-like creaminess.\n\nOh by the way, I never caught that duck.  It was way too fast for me.  And it had wings.

Their noodles taste much fresher and the texture is peerless.  Delfina's, while made in house, taste dried out and store-bought.  \n\nMy other complaint (I seem to have many today) is their scarcity of vegetarian items.  Even the items that appear to be vegetarian are not because they are made with things like chicken stock.  My fiancee is forced to order the plain spaghetti only on every visit.

This is one of those rare places that serves high quality food but with a welcoming feel - from outlay to service - so you don't feel out of place for not using the right fork with your entree or splitting a plate because you're not that hungry. The first time I came here with friends (no special occasion), the waitress gave us a complimentary trio of sorbets just because. \n\nThe food is an interpretation of Italian food. I hear the spaghetti is fantastic but I haven't tried it because other entrees catch my eye. The calamari never fails to start the meal off on a good note. I had never had calamari that wasn't fried until I went to Delfina. Because it's not fried, you don't feel queasy (if you're coming on an empty stomach and have your first bite be drenched in oil) or stuffed from the first course. Definitely get the pasta. Any pasta. They cook the pasta in a broth so there's flavor in every bite. The pork shoulder is so tender that it falls apart with just the use of a fork. Don't skip dessert, even if you're full. The panna cotta and the profiteroles are my choices. I'd get both but that would make me look bad. \n\nIt may be more on the expensive side but it's cheaper - and better - than going to Italy.

The vibe, cozy atmosphere, uber-friendly service and knowledgeable staff, and of course the food. Definitely Italian, but with a twist I can't explain other than being very SF, (as in slow-food, sustainable, local, responsible, fresh, earthy.)\n\nWe sat at the bar for a drink beforehand, then scored a small 2-top table right by the window which was in my opinion, the best seat in the house. \n\nHere's the breakdown of our meal:\n\nApps\nAsparagus with lemon creme frache and bread crumbs (surprisingly, my fav dish of the meal, seriously)\n\nCalamari with white beans (a little salty, but different in a good way)\n\nPasta (split)\nSpaghetti with plum tomatoes and olive oil (excellent sauce flavor with a nice little kick - my 2nd fav)\n\nMain (split)\nRoasted Chicken with creamy mash potatoes (cooked perfectly and juicy)\n\nSide\nSide of cheesy buttery polenta (decadent and rich - perhaps too much butter and cheese if that's even possible. Nonetheless I scraped the bowl not to miss any bites.)\n\nDessert\nProfiteroles: Espresso gelato with chocolate sauce on puff pastries (again, decadent and rich but the way dessert should be, and a good sub to after-dinner coffee)\n\nWith cocktails beforehand and a reasonably price bottle of vino, dinner was still a huge splurge. But overall it was definitely worth it--especially over those stuffier 'fine-dining' spots that have a lot more attitude and a lot less soul to their food.", "author": "Kelly R."}

Was more in the mood for an old-school, red booth Italian place, but Delfina has been recommended by friends AND strangers, so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nMy waitress (Shelly I think?)  was REALLY nice.  Made some great recommendations, and when I couldn't decide on which pasta to get, she let me have two half-orders of each.\n\nThe bread they brought out before my meal was kinda tough and stale.  But whatever. \n\nStarted with the Insalata Di Campo.  Fantastic stuff.  Greens with pancetta, walnuts, balsamic vinegar and shaved Parmesan.  Get this salad.  For real.\n\nI had the tagliatelle with artichoke, mint, and house-made mascarpone.  YUM!  The other half-order of pasta I had was the pappardele with pork sugo.  Wish there was more pork and sugo to go with my pappardele but tasty stuff nonetheless.\n\nHad a glass of Syrah, and tried a Chianti as well - both good.

Finally, we're both free one Friday night and call us crazy, but we decided to go to Delfina WITHOUT a reservation.\n\nWe were told that the wait was about 30 minutes and they'll call us when the table is ready. We were fine with that since we could just walk around the mission district since we both haven't been down this neck of town in a while. We ended up waiting a little over an hour because people wouldn't leave, boooo. \n\nOnce we got seated, we offered some bread and water and the waitress went over the menu. 7x7 raves about their Pappardelle Sugo, so I was excited to try that, but they didn't have it the day I went. Boo. I tried their Blood Orange Bellini, pretty refreshing. We split the Insalata di Campo, which was still a decent portion for both of us and got an order of the Lardo. For our entree, I decided on the wild fennel risotto with snail and my friend got a pasta dish with ragu sauce that was what the waitress describe to be similar to their Pappardelle Sugo (which i wanted to order, but we ended up sharing everything anyway). The risotto turned out awesome, I think it's one of the best risotto's I've had thus far. I didn't really like snails, so I wasn't so sure about it, but now I do! It was awesome with the risotto and didn't overpower it. Finally, we had the Blood Orange Panna Cotta and the reviews are right, it was so creamy I could just let it melt in my mouth all day! \n\nOverall, I had a good experience here. Service was great, atmosphere was a little loud since it was a packed house even at 10:30pm, love the high ceilings and music. I'm happy to say I've had the pleasure of trying this place now! I'd definitely go back, but next time I'll make a reservation.", "author": "Helen Z."}

Being the indecisive, bratty darling that I am, I decided its MY Birthday, and for MY birthday, I want a veggie quesadilla from El Castillo, thank-you-very-much. I decided this 30 minutes before our reservations. 'Cause that's how I roll.\n\nSo for our anniversary this month the ___ made reservations yet again at Delfina. Because it wasn't only MY day (every other day is though, FYI), I couldn't back out of the dinner plans. \n\nAnd I'm quite pleased I didn't. Delfina was *quite* remarkable.\n\nI have to say, initially I was turned off by the vibe of the place, a certain something I couldn't quite place a finger on...a certain air pretentiousness. Yep, that's it. Delfina is pretentious as it gets. And what the hell, the menu is in English so why can't I understand what half the things are? What really cracked me up, though, was when our waitress pointed out a few things on the menu and told us \"Don't even bother ordering these unless you are going to get truffles (at a cost of 40 extra dollars) along with them\". What a surprise that all of the menu options she mentioned were the least pricey on the menu. Right.\n\nAll was forgotten, though, as soon as I had the first bite of our appetizer-grilled fresh calamari with warm white bean salad. Though a bit too lemony, it was delicious, and we ate every last bit from the plate.\n\nFor my main course, I ordered old faithful- Roasted Fulton Valley chicken with Yukon gold mashed potatoes and king trumpet mushrooms...OH.MY.GAWD. It was so delicious- the chicken was hands-down the absolute best I have every had. It was moist and flavorful, just amazing. And the potatoes? They MUST have been soaked in a vat of butter, I died with each forkful.\n\nThough Delfina isn't at the top of my list, I will definitely return again.", "author": "S F."}

I can imagine parking around here would be difficult...but we walked, so...can't attest to that. It wasn't the cheapest meal I've ever eaten, but it was worth every penny. \n\nAfter eating dessert at Bi-Rite Creamery (dessert before dinner = don't judge us), man-friend and I were strolling around searching for a place to eat. Delfina was packed on a Tuesday night, so we were curious what all the fuss was about. We were given the last two seats at the bar, everyone that came in after us was told there was an hour wait minimum. Yikes!\n\nThe atmosphere is so effortlessly classy, yet surprisingly I observed no snobbery. The staff was genuinely friendly, warm and unpretentious. Service was impeccable, suggestions on what to order did not disappoint in the least and each plate that was cleared was promptly picked up. \n\nI can't remember the name of the dish I ordered, but the waitress said the type of pasta means \"rubbish\" in Italian! Sure didn't look or taste like rubbish - It turned out to be flat, triangular pasta with buttery sauce and succulent, melt-in-your-mouth shrimp. \n\nPlease, do yourself a favor and order the panna cotta for dessert.

It's obviously a little pricey, but worth it in my opinion.  We had spiced almonds, asparagus, and calamari for appetizers.  They were all very good, especially the asparagus.  I don't eat seafood but the calamari was actually really good.  The best part is all the sauces, beans, and greens complimenting the appetizers which we ate up as well. \n\nFor entrees we had the pork chop, free range chicken, tortellini with duck/quail, and the hanger steak.  All amazing, especially the tortellini.  The chicken was good and not too dry, and the pork chop was pretty big, a little dry but the taste made up for it.\n\nOverall a nice dinner that won't totally empty your wallet and the service was great, but not forced like other places.

The way its decorated is simple yet nice, lighting is good, but the place is a bit cramped. Good thing we had a window seat so I had a place to put my bag down! Service was good too. Not pushy at all. \n\nAt anyrate, the bread that we started off with was a normal french bread and a sourdough bread with a chewy crust. I enjoyed them both. The butter comes in this square container that reminds me of a candle. It's good but I heart bread so any bread is good, I think.\n\nWe started off with the dungeness crab balls and this was DELICIOUS. It was served with crispy fried onions and fried orange slices! I didn't expect this but cut up a bite of your crab balls and eat it with a crispy fried orange slice and it's mildly orgasmic. 4 crab balls was $17 or something. Priceeeyy!\n\nSTEAK AND FRIES\nMy friend said it wasn't good. Borderline cardboard.\n\nSPAGHETTI W/ PLUM TOMATOES\nThis was the only plate on the table that was decently sized. The spaghetti has a weird kick to it that I can't pinpoint, but I wouldn't order it again. I think my mom makes better spaghetti.\n\nSCALLOPS W/ MASHED POTATOES\nThe bf ordered this and the mashed potatoes were good. But this dish for $27 only came with THREE scallops! How depressing. I knew he wasn't going to be full off this because I wouldn't be either! The scallops were cooked nicely, but for some reason the inside of the scallop didn't have any flavor. I found myself always having to cut it in small pieces then dip it in the sauce that it came with. This was just okay.\n\nOXTAIL RAVIOLI\nI counted. I only got 13 (yes, THIRTEEN) 1.5 inch in diameter sized raviolis. SAD! This was a mere appetizer to me. I could have scarfed it down in less than 3 minutes but I took my time to savour each bite. But the oxtail was really good. The sauce it came with wasn't that thick of a sauce but it was done right. Had Delfina given me double of what I had gotten (aka 26 raviolis), I would be more satisfied.\n\nOverall, don't come to Delfina if you're really really hungry. I guess you can come here and order more, but in my opinion it's not really worth the money. With the $ I spent here for dinner, I could have gotten more food elsewhere.", "author": "Heidi C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-12-05", "description": "The only reason why I wouldn't give Delfina 5 stars is that it can be so difficult to get a decently timed reservation here (2 weeks ahead for a planned Tuesday evening, I was only able to book a 530pm spot!). But, it's easy to see why everyone's filling up reservation spots to eat here. It's located perfectly near some other nice places (Tartine Bakery, Bi-Rite market and creamery, Dolores park) that you can spend your wait time well occupied with. The food is great and flavors and portions do not disappoint. The spaghetti gets great reviews, but we went with some other pasta choices on the menu (pork rib pasta and gnocchi with bone marrow) and they were also excellent. I'm usually very blas\u00e9 about a dish like calamari because I think it's often overdone and super uninteresting, but Delfina's take is different and tasty to boot. Grilled instead of breaded and fried, with accompanying sauce and flavor that's different from any other I've tried. Actually glad we went with that appetizer to start. For dessert, we had a delicious rice pudding that was also very, very good. Really no holes in our meal at all. Our server was knowledgeable and helpful with some menu choices and kept our water glasses full and the drinks flowing.

Two options for Friday, 9:30 and 10:30, three options for Saturday, 5:30, 8:30, 9:30. I thought to myself, this restaurant has been around for a while now, it shouldn't be this hard to get in to. Well it is, and for good reason. The food and service (from our waitress) was absolutely fantastic. \n\nWe showed up on time for our reservation and I was told they were a few minutes behind but that a couple tables are finishing up. No big deal, I worked in a restaurant for 5 years, I can be very patient. Well, after about 15-20 minutes of waiting, I went in to inquire as to the status of our table. The hostess said they were really busy but something should be coming up soon. This is my only gripe, we showed up on time. Had we been 15 minutes late, our table would have been given away, when the restaurant is 20 minutes late, nothing. I had to ask for some complimentary glasses of wine. I think it's only fair, and it's good business practice. I explained to the hostess that we really were in no rush and had no problem waiting, but good business practice would be to offer us something to drink on the house while we wait. She said she understood, but in no way confirmed that she would actually do this.\n\nI went back outside and continued to wait. To my surprise, about 5 minutes later, a woman came out with their wine-by-the-glass menu and offered us two glasses of wine. That made things a little better. My only complaint is that this is not something I should have had to ask for, this should have been offered.  5-10 minutes behind, no big deal, but 25 minutes late, that requires some sort of gesture of goodwill. \n\nEverything after that was fantastic. We were even given a complimentary olive appetizer. Not sure if this was because I said something or if this was their own initiative, but either way, it was appreciated. We weren't too hungry because we had stopped at Mission Cheese before and had a glass of wine and nice cheese platter. The waitress completely understood and in no way pushed us to order more food than we wanted. We shared two pasta dishes, some shrotrib type raviolis, and a wonderful mostacelli with ragu sauce, very much like a bolognese sauce but made up of beef, pork, veal, and possibly lamb, I can't quite remember. For a main entree we split a special that was not yet on the menu, it was a breaded, fontana cheese stuffed pork (loin?). I don't remember the exact cut but it was great nonetheless. We also shared a bottle of Chianti because it only made sense. \n\nFor dessert, we shared the espresso gelato. I hate coffee, but the gelato was amazing. Not too strong on flavor which made it great for me. \n\nAll in all, I would really love to go back. My only real complaint is that I should not have had to take the initiative to tell a restaurant that good customer service is to compensate patrons when they have been waiting 25 minutes for a table they had a reservation for. They came through in the end, but only after I pushed. The last restaurant I worked at it was policy that if you had a reservation, and you waited more than 10 minutes, you were offered a glass of house wine. That's what it's there for, it's cheap, the markup is ridiculous, and the goodwill goes much further than the $3 profit you're losing.

Her eyes were glued to something, dazed, similar to the way young children look when they watch too much TV (oops). But if I can gather any value out of TV and this commercial now I can say that it gave me a great one liner to describe my feelings about Delfina:\n\nI Don't Get It. \n\nI do not. Why in the world do people wait for hours to eat here? Why do they pay so much? Why do people slam on Farina (across the street) but have the bad sense to come here? Frankly I find this a fucking mystery. While Delfina did make an impression on me, the impression was that it was one of the most unimpressionable meals I've ever had. I guess the huge price tag, and one really raunchy conversation that accidentally took place while sitting next to todlers made it memorable for me, but only enough to tell you today that you should not go here. \n\nAnd what's with all the glimmer? Fresh porcini mushrooms in the spring, oh my! THEY TASTE LIKE NOTHING! Geez, I'd go to Farina over this place any day. If you must have a Delfina experience, though, check out the pizza place next door. You'll be glad you did.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

Attractive, clean cut w/ a little edge, warm and inclusive ....Delfina is the kind of place that you might go to be seen - but will never stick out in the crowd. \n\nA girlfriend and I decided to walk in to Delfina for a nice, Wed. night bite. This would be my 3rd or 4th visit and I'd definitely return. Like the girl, Delfina makes you feel welcome, the staff is ridiculously cool/calm/sweet and the food is quite tasty. I can't promise that the food is spectucular, but the casual-hip-warm atmosphere makes the dining experience memorable. \n\nWhat to munch on:\n\n- The spaghetti is famous and pretty tasty. I'd go for something more unique though. If you get this, definitely have it as a 2nd course - not your meal.\n- The calamari with white beans is a nice starter. Small portion but enough to share among 2 or 3 people.\n- The insalata was pretty nice. They split it in two for my gf and I this time around and the portions were pretty nice - even in two.\n- Pasta. I did like the Rosemary Tagliatelle with wild boar ragu and chestnuts. Small portion, though, for $18. Nice chewy pasta - not overboard on the carnivore content.\n- The duck is pretty tasty.\n- Brussel sprouts are as good as they come. Well, they are accompanied by some prosciutto :)\n\nOverall, the food is solid but nothing to write home about. Add in some wine and you'll  give it an extra .5 stars. Ah the miracle of wine.

We had heard that the restaurant was pricey, noisy, and the seating arrangements were jammed together.  Our experience that night confirmed those rumors.  Additionally, the food quality is only so-so for the price, but you go there to be \"seen\", not necessarily for the food or ambiance.\n\nWe arrived on a Tuesday evening about 6 PM. It wasn't very crowded, but quickly filled up.  We sat on a table for two that was parked between other tables, way too crowded to be comfortable.  I had a difficult time having a relaxing conversation due to the intense noise level.  There were a lot of 20 and 30 year old or something crowd.  There were also plenty of staff, though many seem to be watching the crowd, while drying wine glasses.\n\nWe ordered the following: spaghetti (small plate to share, $8), chard ($7.75), roast chicken ($18), lamb ($24), and a few glasses of wine (~$10/per glass).  Delfina provided a generous portion of bread and refilled it when it got low.  The staff was attentive and pleasant.\n\nThe portions were a bit skimpy, though the chicken seemed adequate.  The lamb, which was a special for the day, was a complete disappointment. It was sliced from a leg and medium rare.  They provided a large serrated steak knife, which was barely adequate to cut the rather tough meat.  Certainly the quality did not reflect the price.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert as the noise level made it so uncomfortable that I just wanted to get out of there.  I've read many enjoyable reviews of this place, but it is not for us.  When I spend my hard earned $$$, I expect a relaxing place that I can enjoy my meal, not the high intensity noise compounded by the \"thumping\" and loud background music.", "author": "Robert J."}

They were playing Belle and Sebastian's \"Life Pursuit\" which made me want to hug the servers. Fancy restaurant with hipster music is definitely a big + for me. Good crowd of people for the most part.\n\nService: It was a busy night, so the servers forgot to pour wine, replace bread and also forgot part of our order, but it's passable. Our server was extremely helpful, friendly and funny.\n\nFood/Drink: We had a great white win, recommended by the server. The food was great. We had the asparagus, which were heavenly. Then we had spaghetti and the in nero, both were good, specially the latter. The bread is to die for, being made by Tartine bakery right next door. Now, for the reason it's not a 5 star restaurant (aside from the interior decor), the desserts.

And as a self proclaimed foodie I'm ashamed to admit that I had never been to Delfina until last night. What the hell was I waiting for?\n\nI had a fantastic dinner at Delfina last night with three friends.  First off, the room is loud but not unbearable.  One of the first things I noticed was the swarm of cute, hipster servers buzzing around the dining room. Our server was a sweet heart and totally on top of things from the get go.  \n\nHere's a sample of what I tried:\nSpaghetti, split as an appetizer - an excellent way for everyone at the table to try the pasta, since no one was going to order it as an entree.  Cooked perfectly al dente, in a light, fresh tomato sauce\n\nInsalata Campo - some fancy pants lettuce simply dressed but featuring huge hunks of pancetta.\n\nPork Belly with Cockles - my entree, the saltiness of the pork played off the sweetness of the cockles to perfection. Mmm, salty pork.\n\nChicken - I don't remember the fancy name but the chicken was well received by all. Honestly, I hardly ever order chicken in a restaurant but Delfina's version has me rethinking that policy.\n\nBroccoli Rabe - as a side, so damn tasty.\n\nChocolate Budino - I'm not a huge chocolate fan but loved this dense, Italian cake.\n\nCantucci - basically Italian for best damn biscotti ever.\n\nOk, no evening could be this perfect.  The mashed potatoes received an astounding 'eh' and I was a little surprised that they charged us corkage for the one bottle of wine that we brought considering we also bought a bottle + two glasses off their menu.  But really, now I'm just nitpicking.\n\nI can see why Delfina is packed night after night...it doesn't just live up to the hype, it exceeds it.

I ordered the Mint tagliatelle with chanterelle mushrooms and creme fraiche dinner. This dish tasted really good. The sauce had lots of flavor and was very creamy.  It was not very filling but the taste made up for the lack of portions. My friend ordered the Spaghetti with plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and peperoncini dinner. I tried it and thought it was ok. The sauce was kind of plain. It did not have the explosive taste like my meal did. \n\nThe service here was great.

It's loud and frenetic.  Service was superior, though. So as long as you don't have sweet nothings to whisper, you should do just fine.  The decor and ambiance is inviting, with low strung lights and modern touches.\n\nThe food was fine.  It wasn't bad; it just wasn't excellent.  I'm willing to reassess this on future visits but I can confidently state you can find just as good -- if not better -- food elsewhere, for cheaper.  I tried the salt cod mantecato with walnut oil and fennel seed flatbread per my server's recommendation.  It *was* tasty, it just wasn't well described. I was surprised by its presentation.  I also had the crimson grapes, gorgonzola, and almond salad.  There were 5 grapes in total.  They weren't particularly flavorful, but I was thankful for them.  The gorgonzola was all too meek and nowhere near plentiful. The salad was a resounding \"meh.\" The brussel sprouts were well received as well as the celery root soup. \n\nWhat was mind-blowing and worth every future visit was the warm Scharffen Berger chocolate torta with olive oil gelato and Maldon sea salt.  And don't split it with anyone, either. Seriously. Things could end badly.  It's probably one of the top 5 desserts I've ever had in my life and easily ranks among the most innovative.

I feel that the primi was the best course with wonderful pastas including a 'don't miss' paccheri with sea bass, a rich tagliatelle with trumpet mushrooms and a spicy spaghetti with tomato sauce. I recommend having the primi pastas or gnocchi as available as 1/2 portions if you plan to have a meat course. I would also be happy just having a full order of pasta too. I personally really enjoyed the fowl dishes- quail with a creamy polenta and figs, and a perfectly cooked chicken with mash potatoes (simple but delicious).

I finally managed to order a beer and watched the bartender open the bottle, set it down,but then completely forget about bringing it to me because he got distracted with another order.  I wished I could have gotten his attention or been able to reach way over for the beer myself.  I saw my friends arriving and signalled with my hand that I would be right over after getting my beer.  No such luck with the beer so I abandoned that effort completely, and just joined my friends near the entrance.  The 3 of us waited until 8 pm when the hostess apologized for the delay,saying everyone was taking their time with dessert, but could we please wait over by the bar and maybe have a drink.  \"On the house?\" my one friend suggested.  \"No, I'm sorry I can't do that.\"  So we continue to wait another 10 minutes when a diffenent hostess meanders by and explains to us that because they were so busy \"our\" table had been given to another party who had been waiting longer than us.  Now we would have to wait, and so on and so on.  After about 40 minutes of this nonsense, without so much as a beverage offering on the house, the three of decided that this restaurant would have to wait its turn for good loyal patrons on a return visit --or not.", "author": "Paul S."}

Our server was patient, down-to-earth, and seemed excited about our menu choices (always a good sign). The food overall was pretty good in terms of freshness and quality, and the prices seemed reasonable.  I was a bit disappointed with the choices for a main entree, I was hoping to get some lamb or fowl, and there wasn't any.\n\nWe started with Gioia Burrata- cream filled mozzarella apparently- with heirloom tomatoes and basil oil, warm Castelvetrano Olives, then Risotto with summer squash and squash blossoms. There was some kind of citrus peel in the risotto. It had a lot of complex flavors and the rice was cooked but still al dente.  Very tasty.\nThe spaghetti ordered by my dinner partner, though, was disappointing.  It seemed overpriced and like something I would cook when I have nothing else to eat at home.\n\nFor dessert: Warm Tcho Chocolate Torta with Olive Oil Gelato and Maldon Sea Salt. It was SALTY.

And with them they brought intense stress upon the waitstaff and an aura of tension and disatisfaction.\r\n\r\nThus began an obnoxious turn for the worst.  The daughter is very cute, but she's a kid.  A kid with a sense of entitlement. This is a restaurant that's really not kid-friendly.  You'd think that perhaps the owners might have had a clue about that.  But they didn't.  And the kid did what kids do-- made kid noises, was restless, and spilled a glass of water that splashed our direction and some water hit our shoes.  The mother said nothing, the father did ask if any got on us, but no real apology was made. \r\n\r\nWe're pretty easy going people, so we let that slide and attempted to enjoy the rest of the evening.  The food was good.  The bread fabulous, the salad very good, the french fries very tasty.\r\n\r\nBut by the time the main courses arrived, it was hard to judge because the mother-owner kept complaining about everyone who worked there-- from the hostess to the wait-staff to the chef. From that point on everything turned sour, thus tasted sour. \r\n\r\nOne might think we were eavesdropping, but she was not at all discreet, and our table was literally about a foot from theirs.  Plus, she had made it quite clear that they were the owners (saying it several times and telling her daughter at one point \"this is what it's like to own a restaurant\") so of course she's going to bring attention to her table.\r\n\r\nAfter they left, the restaurant seemed to relax.  It's unfortunate that the owners of a seemingly fabulous restaurant could be so clueless as to the effect they would have on the experience of the customers they want to keep.  \r\n\r\nA note to all business owners: when you're in your store or restaurant, try to remember what it's like to be a customer/patron.

They have remained one of SF's best contemporary Italian restaurants since they opened almost 10 years ago. I lived down the street on 18th and Guerrero during the buzz about the fancy new restaurant opening in my then-humble hood. Probably b/c the owners entered the space like friendly neighbors, they seemed to avoid the contempt saved for other local \"gentrifying\" restaurants like the Slanted Door. \n\nAnd they remain a huge asset to the City's dining options to this day. When out of town friends requested Italian food this weekend--I knew right where to take them. From the prosecco through the meal (where we ordered almost everything on the menu) to the cappuccino, Delfina delivered their finest. Beth, our server, is obviously passionate about what she does--she recalled everything without writing it down (this always blows me away, I have to write myself a note to remind me to go to the store, never mind what to get there!) and even checked to make sure our guest liked his barely-touched pasta dish (we were just talking too much). Delfina won \"best wait staff\" award a few years ago and it is clear why. \n\nThe menu changes daily, so trust your server's suggestions, we loved the sides the best, actually--squash with cheese, perfect chard, big green beans cooked in bacon. So yummy we kept ordering second helpings! The entrees were of course awesome as well--rabbit with pine nuts, salmon cooked rare and served with green beans, and house made pasta. And I didn't help choose the wine, but I sure helped drink it--they offer a sophisticated selection of both Italian and Californian that pare perfectly with the food.  The simple but flawless panna cotta sealed the meal with a kiss. \n\nHere's to another decade of Delfina making the City even better for it's existence.", "author": "Gretchen T."}

The place is always packed on any given night and is named after the restaurant where Chef Craig Stoll worked while in Italy.  My most recent visit happened by chance.  My friend and I were looking for a quick bite to eat and headed to Pizzeria Delfina, where we were told we would have to wait 20 minutes for a table.  We ran next door and discovered that two seats had just opened up at the counter overlooking the main dining space.  What a stroke of luck.  \n\nFood:  5 stars.  Craig Stoll, you're my hero.  If I could come here every night, I would (darn reservations!).  For appetizers, we had the sardines (which were perfectly fileted and delicious), and the gnocchi al ragu (heavenly in its simplicity).  For entrees, my friend had the sepia in nero (spaghetti in squid ink sauce), which I thought was fantastic even though I don't even care for squid ink.  I had the tender, savory pork shoulder.  The meal was not complete until we had the buttermilk panna cotta, complemented with caramel and pomegranate seeds (the flavors melded perfectly).\n\nService:  5 stars.  Service is comfortably relaxed and knowledgable about the menu.  Bonus points go to Anne Stoll for being so accommodating at the host stand (i.e. getting us a table immediately as a walk-in).    \n\nAtmosphere:  4 stars.  There's a lot of nice things to look at (and I'm not talking about the decor), especially from the vantage point of the countertop.  The restaurant definitely gets an eclectic mix of good-looking people.  The decor catches your eye from the street with its modern industrial trendiness.  I understand that the \"mattresses\" on the wall help to muffle the sound, but couldn't there have been a more aesthetic way of doing that?  Also, I'd hate to be the unfortunate couple sitting at the lone table between the counter and the column separating the main room from the smaller bar area.\n\nHits:   Pork shoulder, pastas (including the gnocchi al ragu), buttermilk panna cotta.\n\nMisses:  Reservations are difficult.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Oliveto, Acquerello, Quince, Perbacco", "author": "Keith C."}

How I heard about it was back in my craigslist days where I'd research about top SF restaurants for special occasions.  Thread after thread, Delfina was always suggested right next to the likes of Gary Danko and Michael Minna.  That was about 2 years ago and I finally found some folks to take with me to Delfina.  My anticipation and excitement was finally fulfilled.\n\nIt's a casual spot -- no tablecloths, stools to sit on, waitresses wore whatever was not wrinkled that day, and the menu is printed fresh from the Xerox machine that day.\n\nThe waitresses are like the girlfriends you wish you could hang out with all the time.  Not just for the hookups at Delfina, but because they were genuinely sweet and gave shy quirky smiles when they approached you.  They'd come by and say \"hello, what are you up to?\" in their own waitressy ways though.\n\nOur apps consisted of the Heirloom Tomato and Stretched Mozzarella Cheese.  Lemme tell you, that ball of mozz must have been squeezed out of the udders of a heifer that morning, because that intense freshness was so rich.  And in past mozz-y experiences they were often subtle in flavor, but this one had a nice sharp tinge to it.  Amazing to say the least.  We also got the Salt Cod Spread w/ Flatbread.  Great savory flavor from the soft cod spread.  I would have liked less salt on the flatbread as the fish was well seasoned already. \n\nI could go on about the 4 different entrees we each ordered.  Bottomline, all were extremely enjoyable.  Exceptional dishes was the flat egg noodle and lamb pasta special.  And the Roasted Duck with creamy polenta.  Even at first bite, I knew I was going to come back for repeat visits.\n\nThere's a great atmosphere here starting from the Dolores neighborhood to the cozy dining room.  The space is clean and the crowd is your equal, where everyone is there just to eat good food.\n\nAt the end of the meal our waitress asked if we had decided on dessert and oddly one of us asked \"What time does Bi-Rite Creamery close??\" and w/o blinking she said \"10:00pm so you have about 10 minutes left...\"  Wow!

The fresh pasta was served perfectly al dente and the plum tomato and garlic sauce was very toothsome.\n\nFor dessert, we had a trine of tropical gelato - passionfruit, coconut, and one other type of sorbet which escapes me at the moment.

We managed to try a soup, two pastas, and a main course (all between two people--yeah, I was stuffed by the end).  \n\nThe soup was great--a light minestra with plenty of veggies and beans, and not too filling.  A good way to start off.  Then we had the guinea hen ragu and a special pasta that wasn't on the menu, ravioli stuffed with...a mix of greens I think.  I know dandelion was one of them.  Anyway I'm a huge sucker for ragu (just see my review for NOPA) and this one was awesome and so flavorful.  And the ravioli was amazing too, and so different from the ragu, since it was so nice and vegetable-y.  I actually liked the main course the least out of everything, which was spareribs over panzanella with ramps.  It was good, but the glaze over everything was a little too balsamicy for me.  Anyway, I would have loved to try dessert but at this point there was no way.\n\nAnother little touch I liked--even if you're getting wine by the glass, they bring the bottle out to your table and pour a taste before you decide.  Something you don't see very often!  And yes, they're packed all the time.  We couldn't get in until 9:30 on a Wednesday, so make a reservation early.", "author": "Leslie R."}

Yes, Parking!!! It was a pain.  Especially since their reservation is at 5:30pm or 8pm, otherwise, I would be able to park across the street which is available after 6pm.  Then it is the meat entr\u00e9e, which I think it was just avg.  Here is what we have\n\nGrilled Fresh Calamari with warm white bean salad - a good match with tender flavorful calamari.  The only other grilled calamari that I liked was from Crustacean in which their sauce is a tad over powering as compared to Delifna. \n\nVeal Sweetbreads with white wine, sage and prosciutto - if you have read my review, you know I am a big fan of sweetbreads, so there =)  Succulent sweetbread with the salty bite from the prosciutto and crispy sage. Heaven!!\n\nLasagne Vincisgrassi - thanks to the server's recommendation, I decided to try this dish and it was out of this world.  It now has replaced Pasta Carbonara as my new favorite pasta.\n\nI have a bite of my friends' Fregnacce with Louisiana white shrimp and Spaghettini In Nero with sepia, uni and English peas. Both are good, I guess you can't go wrong with freshly made pasta.\n\nHowever, where they lost me was the Hanger Steak and French Fries. I won't say it is bad, just didn't win me over.\n\nDessert, it is a tough choice since Delfina is right next to Bi-Rite Creamery, so we decided to venture out for ice cream instead.  Otherwise, would definitely try the panna cotta or the Meyer Lemon Semifreddo - which I don't see being offered in a lot of restaurant.\n\nWill definitely go back and guess I will follow others' footstep and keep checking and drooling over the menu in the mean time!", "author": "Prascilla L."}

The person suggested 6pm instead, which my wife accepted.  Whatever.\n\nWe get to Delfina a little before their 5:30pm opening so we can browse Bi-Rite before dinner, but noticed a huge line already.  So we decide to get in line.  We were seated without problem, but I did notice that they filled ALL of the tables by 5:45pm.  I'm pretty sure there were others with reservations at 6pm onward, so that led me to think that if we got there at 6pm, we would have had to wait until 7pm at least before we were seated.\n\nAnyways, we were seated around the same time as 4 other tables, served by the same waitress (Kari).  Water was brought to all of the tables except for ours.  Nothing.  For 20 minutes.  Whatever, maybe slight overlook.  By this time, we were ready to order.  So when Kari came by, I inquired about the specials.   I get a response of 'like I had mentioned, we have the ___' (can't remember the crap of the day). Um, excuse me?  You haven't even greeted us, and you give us attitude like we're doing YOU a favor of dining there?\n\nWhatever.  I asked if Delfina was like a traditional Italian restaurant, where we need to order a Primi and Secondi to be filled.  She said that since we're ordering our own appetizers, a Primi would be fine.  \n\nWe get our appetizers after about 10 minutes (a long wait, but not too bad).  Chicken Terrine was excellent, and crudo Sea Scallops was very fresh, not fishy, and very flavorful.  Ok, so maybe the service sucked, but at least the food is good!\n\nBut here's where the wheels begin falling off, and the dining experience changes from a PG rating to a NC-17 'f-bomb' movie.  For the next 40 minutes, not a single fart from Kari comes our way.  Now, the entitled older d-bag couples from Sausalito, with the old man with an oh-so-cool wannabe hipster ponytail and his over the hill cougar wife, the ones that asked Kari if the scallops were fishy, and demanded that their food be brought out in a specific order, they got all the love and attention.  These tools didn't have to wait long for their food.  When the yapping cougar told Kari, 'if the chard isn't out here in 2 minutes, I don't want it', the manager came back in 2 minutes to appease her.  All the while I sit there twiddling my thumbs, looking at everyone else eating their main dishes, and wondering why no one came to fill up our water, or give us more bread.\n\nAfter seeing everyone, including the busboys and the bum outside, finish their main courses, our food finally arrives.  By this time, I'm pissed off and the lack of attention and the impending $2.50 SF surcharge for health insurance diners are forced to pay.  I'm sure the main courses were good, but all I tasted was bitterness, hatred, and anger at an establishment that does not treat their non yuppie customers the same way.  If you want me to cause an uproar to get some service, I will do so.  I just thought that I'd break the stereotype of uppity San Franciscans being such smug snobs.  \n\nAnd, no, I was not filled after the small portions.  So Kari, you SHOULD have recommended that we ordered a secondi.  But I didn't know if I could wait until closing to eat that dish, (which would be when you would have brought it) so it's probably a good thing you wrongly suggested that we didn't order a secondi.\n\nSo this was my birthday dinner, which was acknowledged by Kari as I asked her for the check.  But I didn't get a birthday dessert like another couple that she served.  \n\nOne regret I had was that my wife tipped them.  This was the second time in my life that I seriously considered running out on the bill.  And I probably would have succeeded, because Kari wouldn't have come around to our table for another 30 minutes.\n\nDid the sit/lie law pass?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-17", "description": "Probably the best Tuscan-style Italian food in the Bay Area! Although Northern Italian style food is not my favorite of all the flavors Italy has to offer, there's next to nothing at Delfina that I can find fault in. The food is always exquisitely prepared; although I am an accomplished chef, especially with Italian food, there's very rarely I dish here that I feel could be better than it already is! Those who have compared this to Farina astound me; I tried them a few months ago and was disappointed. The fresh pastas at Farina lacked the flavor and perfect consistency of Delfina, the portions were the same or smaller for the same price point, and the service was poor.\n\nNotable highlights at Delfina include the mashed potatoes (so good!), the calamari and bean appetizer, the homemade nettle pastas (wonderful, delicate, gamey flavor!), the hanger steak (among the best preparations of steak I've ever had) and the handmade pasta with white sauce (I forget the name). Several of my friends have also given the fries major kudos.\n\nThe wine selection is small, but one can find some interesting and reasonably priced wines that are hard to find elsewhere.\n\nThis is a place for someone with a sophisticated, urbane palate; this is NOT a family-style Italian-American resturant. The portions are small and best suited to those who can appreciate the taste and delicacy of the more subtle, refined Tuscan flavors. \n\nThe dining room itself is well-decorated, noisy, crowded and populated with the wealthy and beautiful people of San Francisco. This probably is not a good place to have a romantic dinner or to bring children. Reservations are difficult to get, but one can usually stop by and be put on the list and be seated within an hour.\n\nThe service is superb; solicitous without being pushy or annoying. Water is refilled promptly and free bread is served before the meal with butter or a high-quality olive oil if requested.\n\nMy only warning is to not order the desserts, with the exception of the Panna Cotta, because it is their weakest effort-- you're much better off going to the bakery a couple doors down from them or Bi-rite creamery near the park, if either shop is open during the hours you dine at Delfina.", "author": "Jacqueline A."}

I had eaten here a while back and didn't remember being all that impressed, but Farina down the street had an hour wait as did the Pizzeria Delfina, so I figured what the hell, I'm here, they've got a table (when Farina and Pizzeria didn't, go figure), I'll give it another chance.  Well, I go into Delfina thinking, it's a little pricey, I'm not that hungry, I need to save calories and money so I'll just get a salad.  Cut to me walking out 2 hours later having finished a four course meal.  It's a trap people.  I think I'm smarter than these places but they sucker me every time.  More than that, I just don't have will power.  What can I say I'm a yelper, I have to try it ALL.\n\nHere is a short(end) list of why I couldn't say no:\n\nService: Amazingly knowledgeable about the menu and wine - every time I asked a question the answer made me want to order it... and so I did.  Like all SF restaurants it wasn't the most attentive, my glass stayed empty a little too often, but the waitress made up for it in the end.\n\nFood:  Damn good.  Simple salads with lots of flavor, superbly cooked meats (perhaps the moistest chicken I've ever had - it was like it hadn't even been cooked... but in a good way), perfect pasta tossed in hearty ragu.   \n\nDecor:  It's fun, I'm fun, I wanna stay so I keep it going.  The whole restaurant is boisterous and lively, moreover we were seated near the kitchen where there is even more action.  With a view of the chefs and more importantly every plate that comes out, my mouth could not say no.\n\nFree Pana Cotta:  Yea that's right.  Read it and weep.  Our entrees took a little too long to come out, which we weren't really bothered by, but the waitress took it upon herself to see that we enjoyed the house's panna cotta on the house.  Like whoa.  First off, that's exceptional that she noticed our wait in such a busy restaurant, and moreover that she made up for it without us having to say anything.  (Somebody got a big tip).  Secondly, panna cotta is one of those things that I never order because it's not something I'm accustomed to eating.  I'm typically distracted by something with chocolate and or a crust.  But I cannot express how glad I am that she ordered it for me.  She knew what she was doing.  It was amazing.  Orgasmic finish.", "author": "Dubs W."}

Had our waiter visited our table (instead of yakking it up at all the neighboring tables) we would have told him this sooner and probably sent it back.

I don't think I have ever had a complete crash course on grapes even before the wine was finished being poured. She also let us taste different options before we ordered a full glass. Top Notch. \n\nAt our table I was able to admire the swanky yet cozy atmosphere of Delfina; the metallic tables, glass windows and mirrors balanced with the candle lit tables, warm overhead lighting and local? artwork on the walls. It was prefect for the date I was on, and larger groups seemed to be comfortable as well. \n\nThe service was impeccable. The entire staff seems to be so happy to be there, and very excited that you are about to partake in their food. I also liked that they seem to work as a team, one person brings you your wine / water, another brings (delicious) bread, another introduces specials and then you have your main server who handles the entrees, and throughout the evening there is always someone around to check on you - everyone worked flawlessly together and we didn't feel harassed or ignored. \n\nThe food was incredible. I feel like we tried everything on the menu, and our server, Jessica, paired different wines with the food perfectly. A new glass for every course, it was great. \n\nAll around one of the best dining experiences I have had. Can't wait to go back.", "author": "Danielle M."}

The only problem is driving around hunting for parking and getting late night reservations because all the good time slots are booked.  The food is filled with different influences from French to Italian to Californian style cooking.  Ingredients are made up of only the best that can be found in SF (organic, sustainable, grass fed, etc.).  Really attentive service that won't leave you asking for water when you need it the most.  Being at Delfina, you get the cool SF Mission vibe and the feeling of  \"This restaurant just gets it!\"  Not too stuffy, not too ghetto, it just is.\n\nI know the menu can change slightly from time to time, but here's a few tips.\n*Salads are pretty small, so try not to share\n*French Fries fried with basil and thyme are a must with any meal!\n*Spaghetti with plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and peperoncini  - large or small its all good!\n*Can't go wrong with any of their Secondi dishes.

The noodles are cooked perfectly, the sauce is full of plum tomatoes, garlic and olive oil -- peperoncini make it slightly spicy and leaves you wanting more. Order the small portion and you'll still have room for an entree. The large is big enough to share between two, if you're having another dish. \n\nPappardelle and duck sugo is delightful. Savory and tender pork folded with perfect, flat noodles. \n\nRoasted chicken is done to perfection. Half chicken is really juicy and tender, even the breast meat -- it's topped with a light mushroom sauce. Mashed potatoes served on a small plate on the side. \n\nSteak and fries are yummy. French fries are skinny and crispy. \n\nButtermilk panna cotta is the best panna cotta you will ever eat. Simple, and perfect. Perfect texture, perfect flavor. Try it with the Moscato d'Asti.

However, I'm making an exception for Delfina because I have a story to relate.  It begins...\n\nMy father becomes OBSESSED with restaurants.  Apparently it's  a recessive trait because I didn't inherit this particular gene and beyond that, I find it a little excessive.  Whatever the case, he recently became fixated on eating at Delfina and so we took him there for his 60th birthday dinner.  Our reservations were for nine o'clock and we all had two very strong drinks before arriving.  We were feeling good.  Until the salads came.  That's when my  dad bit into a piece of rolled up gauze.  That's right,  a rolled up piece of nasty ass cloth.  I watched it as he pulled it out of his mouth in horror.  I laughed.  But it wasn't funny Delfina!   The worst part is that my Dad was so grossed out he canceled his rabbit and on top of that they didn't even comp the meal!!!  \n\nTwo days after the Delfina Debacle the owner called my sister to beg forgiveness which was nice.  Then she talked to my Dad, poor lady, and my Dad expressed his concern about HIV infection (geeeez dad) and other outlandish possibilities.  The owner lady said the gauze can look pretty nasty because they use it to wipe of the edges off plates and they reuse it till they have to throw it away.\n\nAs for the food, I had some very unremarkable swordfish with sodium laden lentils but the vino flowed freely and that's all I really cared about.  \n\nOh Delfina, you would cringe at  the shit-talking festival that took place during the cab ride home.

Not as if Delfina needs another review, but I did want to share some recent dining suggestions.  Ordinarily I may have to dock an entire star for the noise rating, but people don't seem to mind because although this restaurant has been around for years, it is consistently crowded.  Delfina has managed to become an SF institution, which is quite a feat considering the volume of restaurants in the city.  I would say this is because the food is consistently good.  If you don't mind sitting very close to the table next to you, and eavesdropping on their conversation, come here.\n\nHere are some tidbits from neighboring tables.  Left side.  A bday party.  A man walks in with a large present in a giant box. Naturally, I assumed my date had arranged this and that I was about to open a Vivienne Westwood jacket, or perhaps a Playstation.  Nicht.  Right side, a party of two on what appeared to be a first date.  I was amused because the man was photographing the food.  While I, like many Asians, enjoy photographing food, even I am not gutsy enough to do this on a first date.\n\nYesterday I had a delightful grilled calamari dish, which was garnished with fava beans that were melt in your mouth smooth.  Not enough restaurants do grilled calamari, and I don't like the fried variety, so it was refreshing to taste it here.  I also had the escarole and grape salad, which was light but flavorful.  The ahi was a bit dry, but the duck was flavorful.  Duck came with polenta which tasted a bit like grits.  I also enjoyed a pinot that was light, but full bodied.  This pinot complemented the majority of the dishes we had, so I have to find out the name.\n\nThe dessert wine selection is also fairly extensive.  The sparkling dessert wine was dry and crisp, a great compliment to your dessert.

Such is the situation at the now ridiculously popular Delfina.  While the food is highly lauded even in tourism books, the excellent service and ambiance are what set it apart.\n\nWe started with octopus, mussels and chickpeas in a broth and a mozzarella with fried zucchini.  The octopus was superb as was the rest of the dish.  The mozzarella tasted like any of the high quality variety you can get at the grocery store.  It didn't even compare to the homemade version at A16 which I still crave.  Next, we had lamb with fava beans, sole with dried tomatoes and olives, and sea bass pasta.  The lamb was moist but it was not the best I've had here.  I think the preparation was perfect but the meat wasn't top quality.  The sole was unusually flavorful and flaky.  The sea bass pasta was only sprinkled with pea-sized sea bass but apparently the flavor marinated the pasta so that it was quite tasty.\n\nThey have a good selection of wine.  We tried the wines from the winery featured that day which ages their wine in stainless steel.  Good way to kill some good grape juice!  We missed the barrel and we got some with our next bottle of the cheapest Chianti.\n\nWe finished with dessert and rowdiness.  We ordered what looked like a boringish molten chocolate cake in creme anglaise (I could see a couple vanilla seeds).  It didn't have any embellishment and I wasn't even tempted to try it.  I had cream puffs filled with pastry creme, strawberry jam, and covered with granulated sugar.  A nice original idea but the strawberry jam tasted to sweet and syrupy.  I like the texture of the sugar-covered cream puff, however.  My other friend had a sweet cheese tart with apricots, really good.\n\nOur server was attentive, always there when we needed her with great explanations.  Other servers were always around and ready to deal with our loud table.  \n\nDiners were actually dressed up in this beautiful, dark-wood, blue-walled little space!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-01-26", "description": "We went out for a very large, very long work-related dinner at Delfina.  This is certainly NOT a space for a big, formal, stuffy business dinner, but as we were dining with a young, engaged couple, it was a more casual type of work dinner.  \n\nFirst off, the space is small, crowded, dimly-lit, bustling, and lovely.  It's exactly what I look for when I am going for a dark, cozy, intimate dinner with a significant other or to catch up with some close friends.  For business?  Less appropriate but not uncomfortably so.\n\nThe dining room was packed all night, but the bar was basically empty.  This seems to be more a place where people dine rather than a bar-destination.\n\nThe wine list is small but concise, with some great Chianti options.\n\nWe sampled nearly the entire menu:\n\nGrilled Fresh Calamari with warm white bean salad - a favorite, as it was warm and light, yet a substantial first course.  A great value for the price, I'd recommend ordering this.\n\nInsalata di Campo with bitter greens, pancetta, walnuts, Parmigiano and balsamic vinaigrette - This was a bit unremarkable as far as salads go, but had a nice salty tang to it that would set it apart from a house salad.  I'd recommend this only to fill/round out the menu, but don't make this your only app.\n\nBeef Carpaccio with radicchio, salt-packed capers and Parmigiano - at $15, this is one of the pricier appetizers, yet one of the most delicious.  If you're feeling indulgent, go for a little splurge here.\n\nMy date ordered some sort of steak frites, which were very very mediocre.  However, to the restaurant's credit, I think getting steak frites at a tiny, polished Italian restaurant is a mis-order.  The fault, i think, can be shared by my date for ordering this, and by the restaurant for even making this an option.  You know it's only there to appease the \"safe orderer\"...perhaps offer a boring pasta or pizza option instead and leave the steak frites to the French bistros?  I don't know.  I would just caution you against this, as it's the same dish as you would have elsewhere.\n\nWe ended up with some pasta of the day specials, which are now not listed on the website's menu but were all solid offerings.

I'm not really good with the 2-3 weeks in advance planning.  But then I learned of the very nice bar available for walk-ins.  And then I learned that two can easily get a prime table at a prime hour on a night like Sunday.  Last night I even got to be picky and reject two tables before committing.  I love when I can be successfully high-maintenance.\n\nThis is just really good, rustic, simple food.  No fancy sauces or gimmicky anything.  Like when you've been sick and crave comforting stuff that tastes like what it is.   Super-seasonal and fresh salads are made with really good lettuce (yes, it makes a difference!).  Housemade mozzarella is worlds apart from the that week-old watery crap sold at the market.  Even the salt cod brandade (which, by the sound of it, could have been dangerously fishy) was clean-tasting and well-complemented by fennel flatbread.   \n\nPastas are solid, period.  I wasn't the biggest fan of the gnocci bolognese, but that's just because gnocci to me is mooshy baby food.  But the sauce was delish.  I should have asked for a bowl of that, plain.\n\nThe sweet spot on the menu is the 4th entree.  This is for the always-changing, always-interesting special dish.  One night it was perfect roast lamb with eggplant and tomato and white beans.  Another night it was equally perfect slow-roasted Berkshire pork shoulder with farro and roasted peppers.  Both hearty and full-flavored but not heavy at all.  \n\nAnd the goodness keeps coming with dessert.  Order it.\n\nIn a nutshell: great food, eclectic crowd, flattering lighting, casual and good-looking space.   What's not to love?", "author": "Melissa B."}

This is the 254th review for Delfina? Ok, scratch that. 254 reviews?! My review is the literary equivalent of adding a sentence to the Iliad.\n\nRegardless, I have to weigh in with my opinion of the place.  I had an epiphany last night while laying in bed clutching my stomach -- Delfina is the Babel of the SF restaurant scene.  \n\nNo one in his/her right mind thinks Babel is an incredible movie, yet when it came Oscar time Babel was nominated for Best Picture.  Why?  It looked the part from the cinematography to the acting -- it had that Oscar caliber sheen. The only problem was that the story was quite simply a turd rotating down a toilet bowl into oblivion told from 3 different locales.\n\nDelfina is very similar.  It looks the part of a great restaurant.  There are crowds outside, the inner ambiance is hip with great mood lighting and giant mirrors, the staff is extremely helpful, the wine list is big without being intimidating, and the menu has a wide range of dishes to pick from.  Then, when everything arrives, so does the cognitive dissonance.  The food is average.  Wait, all this buildup for average food?  It's not bad like Babel is bad, but something doesn't click.\n\n*Of note, Tim Gunn was there last night sitting at a window table trying to come up with a catch phrase for next season's Project Runway.

Both dishes were perfect complements to the entrees.\nMy friend did the salmon and I had the special: spaghettini with cuttlefish and cuttlefish ink (e.g., black spaghetti).  The flavors in this dish were incredibly complex: spicy (in a Thai-like way despite the Italian preparation), salty, sweet...and just incredibly fresh tasting.  \nI remember loving my friend's salmon but that love has given way to a singular and unwavering focus on my cuttlefish pasta.\n\nOur experience was, it must be said, augmented by the attentive and, at times, hilarious service of an adorable, curly-haired waiter named Oliver.  Sigh.\n\nFinally, and I realize this is in no way a reflection on the food/service at Delfina, our evening ended on a high note when we overheard this conversation between the couple next to us: a normal looking dude who appeared to have requested an escort dressed in Ice Capades thematic garb.\nHim: Let's order dessert?\nHer: Okay...oooh, fromage--what's that?\nHim: That's French for cheese.\nHer: Oh yum.  And profiteroles...what are those?\nHim: Um, these cream-stuffed tube-shaped dough thingies.\nHer: Oh wow...it all sounds so good.   Panna cotta...hmm--what's that?\nHim: A flan-like, er, custard.  It's custard.\n\nYou can't make this shit up.\nFive stars to Delfina for broadening the culinary horizons of one lucky whore in San Francisco.", "author": "Auburn D."}

I would say that you pay more for ambience here than you do for the actual quality of the cuisine.  The food is certainly good, but it was not so good that I walked away feeling that I had experienced anything special.  The service was competent and professional, yet we were rushed to finish our courses so that they could reclaim our table and we were cramped in so tight that the woman at the table next to me kept bumping me with her elbow.  Delfina is certainly nice if you can afford to go to a place like this often, but if you're like me and can only do so every now and then, you're much better off giving your business to someplace like Bizou where the quality of the meal is a notch higher, and the waitstaff is so sensitive to the pacing of the meal that they seem to read your mind.\r\n\r\nIn sum, Delfina is good, but the hype about it is unfounded.  There are many far better places in the same price range to choose from in the city.", "author": "Matthew M."}

The lighting was perfect, the other diners were upbeat without being too loud and our server. What an angel. She took us through the whole menu and choose a wine for us to taste (Franciacorta - Contadi Castaldi, delicious throuought the entire meal).  \n\nWe ended up having the calamari and white bean salad to start. I had eaten this dish here before and it was just as good in round #2. Our dinner took a long time to prepare and the waitress was such a doll and kept informing us of its ETA and even comped our wine. It was worth the wait,  I had the Spaghettini \"in nero\" with sepia and uni which was an incredible dish. It looks and tastes like a regular tomato basil spaghetti combination but the squid ink provides an exciting and beautiful flavor at the end.

My friend ordered the gnocchi, and he seemed to enjoy it, but I was more satisfied with what I had ordered.

Their sea bass pasta special was a winner.   Their risotto wasn't half bad either.  The chicken was juicy but as all non-sauce-y chickens go, was on the bland side.  I really liked their panettone.

Due to copious amounts of wine and squabbling over changes in staff, I didn't remember much about the food but know I thoroughly enjoyed it.  \n\nAnyhow, on to the present.  Or more recent past. \n\nMister B was able to secure a reservation for three a couple of nights ago, which was somewhat surprising but whatever, I was happy.  We walked in and were seated immediately.  I hate to sound like a betch but we did wait for a few minutes to be greeted and offered water.  And I'm a patient person.  Anyhow, the conversation and people-watching made it easier to suffer through it ;)  Delfina is lively but not so much that you can't carry a conversation.  \n\nOur server was candid and awesome.  He had some great wine recommendations based on what we were looking for (\"a white, not smelly-feet-esque, not too crisp\"  HAHA!  seriously, Mister B said this)\n\nThe food was fan-effing-tastic.  We started with the Salt Cod Mantecato which was delicate, but the accompanying fennel seed flatbread was the real star.  The insalata di campo offered a different and vibrant flavour in each bite---uber salty pancetta, tangy vinaigrette, parm shavings, my mouth is watering just thinking about it.  \n\nI wasn't terribly hungry so opted for a primi, the rosemary tagliatelle with guinea hen ragu and chestnuts.  The homemade pasta was delicious, and ragu was a happy medium between brick-in-my-stomach and I'm-still-hungry-let's-order-a-pizza.  I regret not getting a side of the broccoli rabe or greens as I think they would have gone well with it.\n\nMister B had the king salmon, which was absolutely beautiful.  It came on a bed of asparagus and carrots, topped with this meyer lemon sauce and capers.  The salmon was silky in texture and had a more delicate essence of oily goodness so often associated with the fish.\n\nMister E had the mixed grill which consisted of rabbit (he said it was ok), chicken liver (didn't seem to impress him much but he's not a big liver fan), and lamb sausage.  I usually find sausage to be too fatty and don't like it, but this stuff was unforgettable.  Darn, my mouth is watering again!\n\nGood wine selection, I think it was split between Italian and American.\n\nAnother really cool thing about Delfina is that they have open bar seating, some in a little room facing the actual bar, and another in the main room overlooking all of the other diners.  Great idea!\n\nWe didn't have room for dessert, but since this place is only a five-minute walk away, I will be back.  I kinda want to go back right now.", "author": "Aimee B."}

This place is awesome and I always have a great meal here.\n\nOur last meal was the day after Valentine's Day.  We've gone to Delfina to celebrate Valentine's Day on either the 13th or the 15th for the past few years (since Molly usually works on Valentine's Day) and its great because you don't have to deal with the crowds.\n\nWe had a 9pm reservation and showed up on-time and were immediately seated.  Even though you could practically reach over and try your neighbor's food, we settled into our cozy table and blocked out everyone else.  We brought a bottle of Bandol ros\u00e9 that we opened and ate with our appetizer courses.\n\nWe ended up having 5 courses, but each had just one dish that we shared.  For us, this is the perfect way to dine.  We started with the Ahi Carpaccio ($16), a paper thin piece of pounded ahi on a bed of shredded fennel topped with blood orange segments and chervil.  A delicious, light and clean dish.  Next we got the Calamari with White Beans ($9.25), a Delfina classic and a dish I can't imagine getting tired of.  The calamari is tender and served on a bed of warm white beans with a delicious vinaigrette that has enough citrus and richness to feel hearty and light at the same time.  I get this dish every time I'm here.  Next we shared a half order of the Crab Spaghetti ($11.50), a simple and delicious dish with succulent pieces of dungeness crab and aldente pasta.\n\nFor our entree we had the Roasted Fulton Valley Chicken ($18), a hearty bone in chicken dish served with king trumpet mushrooms and olive oil mashed potatoes.  Definitely a portion fit for sharing, this was the perfect dish for a cold night.  With this dish we shared a glass of barbera ($9.50), a great compliment.  \n\nWe didn't order a dessert, but our waitress could tell we hesitated and brought us one on the house.  I always love their panna cotta and lucky for me, that's just what she brought us.  The Buttermilk Panna Cotta ($9) with blood orange and vanilla caramel sauce was absolutely delicious and hard to stop eating.\n\nOur waitress (I think her name was Allison) was great and made our dining experience that much better.

It's the pasta, wine and dessert that keep us coming back.\n\nPasta Highlights\n- fresh artichoke pasta with baby artichokes - amazing! We could taste the artichoke in the pasta - which, was a little bit of heaven.\nOur server/the bartender told us about how they don't usually have artichokes in February but there was a warm snap and there were some very tasty but ugly chokes in their veggie delivery. So, they made pasta so we could taste the wonderfulness but not get turned off by the looks of them. \nI love a place that tells you stories about the food you're eating.\n- short rib ravioli - holyness in my mouth. The sauce was like barbeque but not standard. It was a thin glaze that added just enough flavor. Amazing.\n- nettle tagliatelle (I'm pretty sure it was tagliatelle) with a nettle sauce - I was skeptical but the waitress assured us it was wonderful and it really was. I wanted greens that night and I got them in such a delicious way.\n\nWine highlights\n- We found a most wonderful wine there - Lacrima di morro d'alba - it tasted just like blueberries (without being sweet and cloying) and our bartender/server told us all about it.\n- They always have really tasty and seasonal bellinis - the blood orange one was out of this world.\n\nDessert highlights\n- Buttermilk pannacotta - always amazing. I loved it when they served it with ruby grapefruit but my man didn't care for the dramatic contrast in flavor and texture. The next time it came with blood orange and we both loved it.\n- Chocolate torte with olive oil gelato and sea salt - WOW. I love olive oil and I love chocolate and I had to try this. It sounded interesting and like something I couldn't imagine. The olive oil gelato really tasted like a very flavorful olive oil - not olives. The salt was the perfect touch and the chocolate was rich and thick - tho, a touch dry, but that's torte for you!\n\nI highly recommend \n- anything pasta, it's always outstanding\n- ask for a wine pairing or suggestion rather than heading out on your own (unless you are a super wine connoisseur and know regions/flavors etc) \n- save room for dessert.", "author": "Adriene C."}

Of course you don't eat duck giblets on a daily basis - but when it's mixed with homemade pasta and provides a rich earthy flavor to the sauce - it's decadent!  The actual giblets I passed to my date to enjoy.

Finally after all this time living in San Francisco, I got to see what Delfina is all about.  One word can sum up our experience:  Stellar.  \r\n\r\nIt was another outing with abl and yet another multi-course event.   Our server Derek, who was very gracious, really cool and very warm, was really easy about our 5 course escapades.  He quickly brought over the pink bubbles that we had ordered to start our evening right.   \r\n\r\nWe started with the Salt Cod Mantecato (a brandade) with fennel seed flat bread and the Wild Boar Sausage skewers with a cherry tomato compote and baby arugula.  What I liked the best about everything was that you can tell that its all about the ingredients.  Too much technique could kill a potentially great dish.   Needless to say, our first course was stunning, simply prepared and delicious.\r\n\r\nWe then had the Spaghetti pasta with plum tomatoes, EVO, garlic,  peperoncini and a hefty amount of grated Parmesan.  It was excellent with the bottle of Chianti Classico Riserva that I had brought in, and the extra EVO I drizzled all over the dish.  Flawless second course.  Again, I was super happy to see little technique and more focus on the ingredients.\r\n\r\nNext we had our main course.  I had the Pork Spare Ribs with Cannellini beans and tomatoes.  Abl had the Local Sand Dabs with Frisee, Capers, Potatoes and Lemon.  We loved everything, but we were quickly feeling the effects of ordering a bit too much food.  However, I did leave only 1 rib behind, and it allowed abl and I to  chat it up and take our time with our food.  \r\n\r\nTo clean our palates, we ordered the Insalata del Campo.  A wonderful blend of radicchio, arugula and endive (amongst other  greens) with pancetta, walnuts tossed with a balsamic vinaigrette. It was a perfect way to get us ready for dessert. \r\n\r\nThe one thing I was very keen on noticing too was the fact that Derek, our server, had paced our courses seamlessly.  We weren't overwhelmed with course after course at all.  It was timed perfectly.  Also, this place thrives on the whole team playing.  Everyone was helping each other out.  It's no wonder that Delfina is regarded as one of the best restaurants in the city.\r\n\r\nFor dessert we had the Profiteroles with Espresso gelato and chocolate ganache, and the best damned Panna Cotta I've ever had in my life.  I think abl would agree with me on that one.  I was saddened by two things:  1.  That dessert had to end (I could have eaten 4 of those Panna Cotta's) and 2.  Delfina doesn't serve Grappa (possibly because they don't have a liquor license).  However, Derek suggested we try the Vernaccia di Oristano and the Malvasia della Lipari.  We loved both of them so much, but I think the Malvasia was the winner of the two.  Such a lovely display that not all dessert wines have to be sweet.  And to top it all off, the dessert wines were on the house and our corkage was waived, which sealed the talks I had heard that Delfina is a generous house.  \r\n\r\nOverall, Delfina lived up to and surpassed all the hype I had heard about it.  I cant wait to return and play around some more with the fabulous menu!", "author": "Maz N."}

To our surprise, they had a table for 2 as long as we were out of there by 8 (and it was 6:15) No problem! We started with the grilled calamari appetizer and lemon asparagus. The calamari was absolutely tasty and served on a white bean salad that was super delicious!! The asparagus was ridiculously great too, not too much lemon but just right. \n\nFor the entrees, the BF had the steak with french fries and I had the squared pasta with pesto sauce (I forget their name for it but in English they told me it meant \"handkerchiefs\" because of the thinly sliced squares). The steak was soo juicy with an amazing thick sauce. My pasta   was delicious as well--the pesto sauce covered the pasta and had a sprinkle of pine nuts in it that added a little crunch to my pasta. Both dishes were served piping hot and I'm glad that it was right out of the stovetop and not sitting under a heating lamp or anything. \n\nThe service was absolutely excellent. Everyone from the hostess, bussers and server were simply amazing.

You can call months in advance and they only have the 5:30 or 10:30 reservations open and everyone knows those are reject times. The only time worth going to a restaurant is around 8, especially on a Friday or Saturday. At least that is what the cool kids told me. \n\nImagine my surprise when I was invited to dine at Delfina at 8:30 on a Saturday night. (I can only imagine this but) I felt like I was picked to go into Studio 54 in the 70s. Acceptance, finally! I must say it does really feel good to glide by all the jealous, hungry hordes to a cozy table. \n\nSo, I wouldn't call Delfina classic \"Italian\" food. It is definitely food of the 42nd parallel made in San Francisco. Or what San Franciscans believe that bougie Italians eat. \n\nI really did enjoy my calamari and anchovies. They were both nice and salty. I didn't love my guinea hen ragu. The hunks of hen were tough and lack appropriate gamey flavor. \n\nThis is redeemed by the buttermilk panna cotta. I LOVE panna cotta and theirs is excellent. I could eat this everyday and be happy. \n\nOur server was a gorgeous, stylish, enthusiastic gay man. He was adorable and recommended a tasty rose to go with our seafood and game selections. \n\nIn conclusion, I can now tell people that I have been to the promised land, Delfina at 8:30 on a Saturday night.", "author": "Monica L."}

We told our server that we were in a hurry and he had no problem what so ever. There was a nice selection of wine by the glass. It came immediately after ordering. We ordered lamb sausage with lentils and grilled squid with warm white bean salad. I thought both were delicious. There was poached lemon zest in the warm bean salad that my girlfriend didn't care for. \n\nWe got two kinds of bread on the table. One from Acme and one from Tartin. The bread from Tartin was fantastic and very fresh. Unfortunately, next to the Tartin bread the Acme bread tasted stale and flat, which it wasn't. \n\nI'm allergic to fish, not shell fish. This is always hard to explain in a restaurant. Especially at an Italian or Asian restaurant. But, our server took it all in stride and found out exactly what was in the shrimp dish I ordered for my Secondi. Turns out there was fish stock so I ordered the Flat Iron steak with fries. That was fine because it was the first thing that I smelled when I got into the restaurant.   I ordered it MR and it was cooked perfectly.  The fries were a little soggy.\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the ravioli stuffed with prosciutto and mascarpone. It was really tasty. The pasta was a little softer than I'd like. Her mother ordered the cauliflower soup which was excellent. \n\nThe service staff did an amazing job of keeping our small table bussed and our wine glasses full.

The lighting and decor is very nice, but the tables are so close together that it's almost a communal dining experience.

Both of these dishes were very good and the best we would have all night. \n\nThe main entrees we ordered were the Spaghetti with plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, and peperoncini and the Roasted Fulton Valley Chicken with olive oil mashed potatoes and chanterelle mushrooms. I didn't personally try the chicken as I am a vegetarian, but my date said that it was average at best. I did try the mashed potatoes and thought they were good, but really nothing special.  While the sauce was good on my pasta, the pasta itself was much too al dente for my taste. I appreciate firmness in my pasta, but this seemed to be simply undercooked. I was also extremely surprised at how small the \"large\" serving was.  \n\nWhile I appreciate the good service at this restaurant and the couple of good dishes that we did experience, my overall experience at this place was simply average and not worth the money spent.

Damn it was good!\r\n\r\nthe anchovies were shiny sliver and slick, served in several \"X\" shaped pairs with lemon and olive oil and a mound of cucumber and radish salad.  They were so delicious--smooth, bright and rich tasting and then the crunchy cucumber for contrast.\r\n\r\nThe salad was dandelion greens with thick pieces of sauteed porcini and ribbons of shaved Parmesan.  The porcini were just how I like them--crisp and golden on the outside but moist and meaty.  And they had a great wild flavor too.\r\n\r\nThe pasta was perfectly cooked, almost chewy, with a thick sauce made by stewing fava beans in pancetta (or maybe it was the stuff made with jowls?)  and it was so very good that we stopped talking for a while.\r\n\r\nMy entree was sand dabs (my first time!) and I ate them all up but the next day I realized it was more about the soaked-in-buttermilk-and-drenched-in-semolina crust than the actual fish.

No Bi-Rite Creamery next door, no Tartine Bakery around the corner.  Instead the Dovre Club was down the street and not much else.\n\nI happened to stroll in that first week they were open and had a meal which included their now famous spaghetti.  Annie Stoll -- the co-owner and wife of chef Craig Stoll -- was in the front of the house making everyone feel welcome and wonderful.   Was an amazing dinner.\n\nAnd we all know the story from there.  The restaurant changed the Mission.  And the place has just kept getting better.\n\nWent back for the first time in years and was met at the front by a lovely hostess who found us a seat, sans reservations, in the bar area with a great view of the kitchen.  The waitress knew her stuff, telling us all about the great glass of Montepulciano we shared and recommending that we enjoy the acquacotta -- a simple soup with kale, garlicky crouton, and a poached egg.  They offer bread from both Acme and Tartine.  And on the menu this night: a fabulous grassy olive oil which was delivered tableside in a small tin dispenser.\n\nMy main course was a beautifully booked piece of Hawaiian tuna with perfectly pillowy butter beans.  We lingered over some espresso mousse and left very, very happy.\n\nMeal for two with two glasses of wine was under $100.  And in a marvelous place that has only gotten better since that autumn day in 1998.

My husband and I ate here last night for my birthday. \n\nService: Very good\n\nAtmostphere: Hustle bustle. We were there for first seating on a Sunday at 5 p.m. and there was a line out the door waiting to get in. The place was full by 5:30 p.m.\n\nThe music selection was very strange for an Italian restaurant though. When we got there, there was hip hop/club-type music, then it switched to something pop-like...it was just odd. It kind of disrupted the mood of the place for us.\n\nFood: Just good, but nothing spectacular, memorable or original. I have had much better Italian in the city at several different places. \n\nWe started with the insalata salad with bitter greens, walnuts, parmesan and balsamic vinaigrette. That was very good -- well-blended flavors and beautifully presented. I then moved on to the gnocchi al ragu. It was well cooked and the flavors were \"good,\" but again nothing special. I've had much better. My husband got the fregnacce with shrimp. It smelled REALLY low-tide and fishy, which both of us were really surprised about. Good, FRESH seafood should not smell that fishy!! Again, the flavors in that dish were just so-so. My husband was very underwhelmed.\n\nThe best thing was actually the bread they serve, which they brought in fresh from a bakery called Tartine a couple doors over. That bread was so fantastic I've actually been thinking about it all day today and may have to go back to that bakery to get some more!\n\nSeating: Very uncomfortable! Tiny chairs, wooden benches, no padding, tables very close together.\n\nParking: Apparently it is very challenging in this area, but we got lucky and found a place a couple blocks away on the street without any problems.\n\nWith so many fabulous Italian restaurants in the city, we have no plans to go back here. The place is friendly and the food is decent. But I think this place is highly overrated overall.", "author": "Christine P."}

The people next to us sat down after us, ordered after us, yet got all of their things faster than us. The waitress was super understanding of my dietary restrictions and me trying to change the menu. She helped us pick things i could eat and made sure other things were changed. She was super sweet but very awkward in a way. The bread was great and the food we had was delicious. Boyfriend and I shared a squid appetizer, a tomato sauce pasta special dish that had shrimp, and swordfish. They were all delicious, I couldn't even pick my favorite. All of the seafood was super high in quality and you could even tell that the pasta was handmade in house. I was very impressed with the food, the only reason I gave 4 stars was because the service was not very good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-04-20", "description": "I should probably try to make it back here one more time before writing a review, but with other better, more authentically Italian places around, coming back to Delfina isn't a high priority for me. \n\nThe food is, of course, fresh and passionately prepared, but the flavors weren't powerful or memorable enough to warrant repeat visits. The most notable thing I tried here was a nettle pasta in a nettle sauce: green papardelle made with nettle and a green nettle sauce to match. It was a bit like basil pesto, but not quite as flavorful. I enjoyed this, but it didn't blow my mind. A dish involving salmon and potatoes failed to truly impress despite its freshness and artful presentation. Anything else that was ordered just wasn't very memorable. Overall, it was a bit too \"California-comfort\" for my tastes. If you want authentic Tuscan cuisine, you're not likely to find it here. \n\nSomewhat irksome was how at 7:30 they were already out of the lobster for a special they were touting that night, yet 20 minutes after placing our order, a couple seated next to us who knew the waitress by name, ordered that very same dish sans problem! Maybe they made a mid-evening lobster run right after I ordered, but regardless, that was still slightly annoying. \n\nThe place is crowded, lively, noisy, etc., so take that for what it's worth. Also, the awkward and callow conversations overheard from the tense Marina types you're likely to be seated next to makes for no end of unintended giggles. Delfina seems to remain a very trendy place, so reservations are a must. I came to Delfina expecting exquisitely prepared Italian-ish food, but went away feeling that other places, like Dopo, Antica, and Olivetto offered more flavorful and much more consistently authentic Italian dishes. In short, Delfina is worth a try, but I don't quite see what all the fuss is about.", "author": "Giofreddo W."}

For a belated bday present, my three lovely friends took me to dinner here last night.  beautiful space, very warm and cozy. \n\nto start, we shared a salad and four antipasti: \n\nfirst, calamari w/white beans and frisee - the best dish of the night - the calamari was tender and SMOKEY - sooo good.  lots of good olive oil;  only thing was, it was a rather small serving.  i'd want my own.\n\nsalt cod mantecato w/fennel seed flatbread - reeeally good, creamy, not as salty as some I've had -  the fennel flatbread was really light, flavorful and crispy; \n\nwhole silvery sardines with some kind of relish - I think eggplant and then something slightly sweet, and a piece of reddened toasted bread soaked in tomato juices and garlic.  when you ate a bit of just the sardine it was a tad fishy, but if you had a bite of everything together it was the perfect combo - crunchy from the bread, salty, sweet, fish-bite, garlicky. \n\nchicken liver spiedini - liver on a stick! - interspersed with grilled bread.  good but a little too bloody for some.  served with little blocks of seared fat - SEARED FAT, WHAT'S BETTER THAN THAT?\n\nand for the salad - heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella and basil oil - 2nd best item of the night.  such a simple dish, but prepared so well - the tomatoes were PERFECTLY ripe and juicy and PERFECTLY SEASONED with just sea salt and pepper.  great oil. \n\non to the primi:\n\nagnolotti - a Piemontese type of filled pasta, know as a \"priest's hat\", filled with chicken and mortadella in a light butter and lemon sauce - really good, light, silky.\n\ngnocchi with cherry tomatoes in some sauce - ehhh.  I always find gnocchi boring; sorry to say this one was no exception.\n\ntripa alla Fiorentina - i'd been dying to try this, as i'd had a fantastic version of it in Florence -  where it was silky and rich, not menudo-like at all.  Delfina's tasted tripey, very offal-y, and the texure was a bit rubbery.  yes, i know it's tripe, but again, i've had it prepared sublimely before.  one of my friends grew up eating tripe and never liked it and wanted to be wowed into liking it.  this didn't do it for her.  ALTHOUGH, i have to say . . . i ate quite a bit of it.  something kept drawing me back to it.\n\nWe were too full from all that to have an entre (secondi), so we had the cheese plate - which was not great - Italians just don't make a lot of great cheese - i lived in Italy for 5 months and only loved a handful of cheeses.  the pork chop with figs sounded great, and the halibut looked fantastic.  but we'd eaten slowly, with good wine, and so just couldn't squeeze in an entree, even to share.\n\nof course, my friends all LOVE dessert so we DID have room for two of those - a molten chocolate cake, prepared to order, and profiteroles with homemade espresso gelato, with a chocolate sauce and candied almonds.  these were pretty damned good, i must say - non-dessert-person that i am.\n\nAll in all, I'm a bit disappointed that I wasn't totally wowed by this place - I think I built it up for myself too much.  it was GOOD, but I don't need to go back right away - it's always that thing - too many other places to try first before I do a go-back.  but I DO still want to try their pizzeria next door, because you can get their highly touted pizza and most of the antipasti, which were the best things.  The service was excellent - our cute little hippy-dippy server was friendly, attentive, and totally knowledgeable about all the food and wines.\n\nOh and they brought me a couple of cute little amaretti-type cookie-batons, with a candle, for my bday.  shh - don't tell them it was actually in August!", "author": "maria a."}

It is consistently delicious, as long as you are into Italian-style food. And when I say Italian-style, I mean more like real Italian food (maybe some bitter greens, stuff made out of beans, slightly less mainstream types of meat), and less like Olive Garden (pasta slathered in cream sauce). \n\nThe menu changes seasonally, although they usually have some stand-by dishes like the roast chicken with olive oil mashed potatoes. I love this dish. It is really simple and yet really good. If you share this with someone, you may end of fighting over who gets the last bites. Just a warning. \n\nAbout a year ago, I ordered one of the specials, and I still dream about it to this day. It was saffron risotto with oxtail ragu, and it captured my heart. I'm not going to try and describe it with all kinds of foodie vocabulary. I'll just say that this dish is proof that Delfina occasionally knocks it out of the park (in addition to their already solid menu). \n\nThe only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because occasionally I order something that just isn't that great. Don't get me wrong, nothing is ever bad there, but some dishes just don't live up to the rest. \n\nThe other reason to knock off a star is the long wait. If you don't make reservations way in advance, you will likely have to wait 1-2 hours during prime dinner time.

Granted, I was there on a Friday night, which is a bad night to judge food on, but everything was on the verge of being overdone/having sat way too long under heat lamps. Nothing had really gone over the edge, but also nothing seemed perfect. And my pork chop was definitely on the wrong side of medium and a tad dry.

We had the baked cheese appetizer which was very very good, then again, it was baked cheese so.... of course it was good. We also had a salad which was fine, the spaghetti which was awesome, this was our favorite dish by far. For entrees we had the chicken and the steak which were both good but not nearly up to our expectations for this place. The mashed potatoes came out cold but they fixed it immediately.  Neither entree was especially flavorful which was disappointing.\n\nFor my dining dollar I will head to Range which has awesome food and it a little less expensive.", "author": "Ashley T."}

The staff are all very helpful, gracious, and non-pretentious. Bread is always sliced fresh and butter is sprinkled with sea salt for an extra dab of baked love.\n\nSince my friend was running half an hour late, the waitress asked if I wanted to wait with something to drink, and suggested the moscato d'artsi ($9.75/glass) after asking me what kind of wine I liked. It was AMAZING. What I also love is that she didn't try to sell me the most expensive wine on the list, but rather suggested something that suited my tastes instead-- it's rare to see a restaurant not take advantage of your wine-innocence and stick you with an expensive glass of something you don't really like- so +stars for that. The muscato was so good that I had two! \n\n+ the Rosemary Tagliatelle with wild boar ragu was absolutely delicious, and worth the $18 tiny portion. It was creamy, thick, piping hot, fresh, and just great\n+ the calamari appetizer ($9.25) was also really good. I'd expected it to come out sliced and fried, but instead it came out whole. One of the tentacles was extremely salty though, but still yummy. Since I'd ordered it since I was starving waiting for my friend to arrive, the waitress came over to apologize because she said the chef had been holding the calamari back because he'd been watching my table to see when my friend would arrive, but that they were re-making a new plate to send over right away.\n+ Casual atmosphere. Makes for fancy dining without the faux-faux.\n\n-- Cramped!! Small dining area. There was a makeshift tarp jutting into the sidewalk that I suppose served to cover the sidewalk patrons, but you're literally on the sidewalk.\n\nI would come back here again for a casual meal, but wouldn't jump at having my birthday or anniversary dinner here (but I'm a snob for pretty venues.)", "author": "Cheryl F."}

I'm kind of an Italian food snob and hardly ever eat at Italian restaurants because they can be so disappointing.  I'd much rather buy fresh pasta from Falletti's and cook it perfectly al dente myself.\n\nWe sat down and started with an excellent local Syrah and some delicious appys - calamari on a bed of warm white beans (YUM!), beet salad, broccoli raab (loaded with garlic and olive oil, perfect) and perfectly grilled fennel-encrusted fennel. Fennel in any form besides sliced on a salad with citrus is a big plus in my book. \n\nNext, the pastas.  Holy mother of god - absolute fucking perfection.  I ordered the wild nettle risotto with mushrooms.  I knew Delfina could win me over if the risotto was top notch, and it really was. I'm pretty sure there was a stick of butter swimming in my dish, which may have helped.   The spaghetti was stunningly simple and delicious, and reminded me very much of the pasta found in casual trattorias in Florence or Rome where people swarm in for lunch, eat a bowl of perfectly cooked pasta standing up at the bar with a cup of red wine.  This is one of the few restaurants I have been to in the United States where the pasta ACTUALLY tastes like pasta you find in Italy. YUMMM!!!!  The ahi with warm lentil salad and anchovy aioli was perfection as well. \n\nI already feel like a blubbering idiot about this place, but I do have to mention one more thing - dessert.   The espresso profiteroles were alright but not really my thing (I'm not a big chocolate person).  The blood orange panna cotta, however, almost knocked me out of my chair.  I took the first bite and my eyes grew wide as I silently savored the insanely heavenly deliciousness on my tongue and waited for someone else to try it and join me in my dessert-gasm. WOW.\n\nAs you can see, I don't have many (any) complaints about this place.  I do have to say, though, the wine list was very limited in terms of affordable selections.  I think there were only 3 or 4 reds under $40.  I mean, as much as I wanted to I couldn't just breezily order the fantastic but pricey 2001 Brunello for $110.  Maybe this is how they keep out the riff raff - by making it prohibitively expensive for you to get drunk.  And hey, it worked.  After dinner my friends and I hit up the 500 Club and the Lex for $3 drinks at both.  Sweet.", "author": "Leona K."}

It was a good swap though, except for the budgeting attempt which is not working so well.  We drank tons of wine and the bartender was great at choosing fun new kinds for us to pair with our appetizer, turned entree, turned cheese dish, turned desert.  Plus, by the bar there was a door open to the outside, so it was almost like eating outside, but warmer and just as lively.  I liked eating at the bar better than sitting at a table (although i never ate at a table here so really i wouldn't know), it was freer and more fun.  I liked the busy rushing environment around us as we drank wine after wine.  We shared all the dishes and managed to stay right at $100, which we thought we were well over and happily were not, so that wasn't soooooooooooo bad.  \n\nIf you are still hungry after trying not to spend too much and drinking your budget accidentally instead of eating it, there are some cheap markets around open late that you can grab a chocolate bar and mexican candy treat, both for a buck even.  It would be fun to get to go broke pretending you're rich until you were totally poor and had to change your lifestyle (if you could then start over).

Though know that the portion is tiny.  an app + a pasta + desssert probably won't be enough food.\n\nI learned this first hand 2 years ago, when we first moved into the neighborhood.  Literally moved in that day and walked down to Delfina, having heard wondrous things about it.  About 9pm, we got two seats at the high bar adjacent to the dining room.\n\nTwo apps, two pastas, and a half bottle of wine.\n\nBrandade was okay but the pastas were fantastic - one was a simple spaghatti and mine was a sheet pasta with duck ragu.  \n\nProblem is, I took four bites and my pasta plate was DONE.  I had an inkling that the portions may be structured that way since the menu does subdivide into antipasti, primi, and secondi.  I talked to the waiter, who did not warn me that the pasta is portioned to accompany a secondi plate.  He brought the manager over who was gracious to the tee.  She asked me whether she can bring more food (I say yes - same pasta, just a double portion).  5 minutes later, the pasta got to our table.  She came by with two glasses of wine on the house.  And then sent us a panna cotta.\n\nBy this time, I was completely satiated - by the food, by the wine (our half bottle was so good that I asked to keep the empty bottle), and by the extraordinary response.\n\nThe bill came and it was like $150.  First thought was that - damn it, they charged us for everything!  Looking at the details, I saw that our half bottle of wine was like $90.  I went and grabbed a menu and realized that my wife had picked out a half bottle ($25) but pointed to the $90 bottle when she ordered.\n\nI was wondering why they decanted our $25 half-bottle wine, why she apologized that she couldn't pour us the same wine (on the two freebies)  and why this little bottle was so darn good.  Well, now I knew why.\n\nBut in the end, it was a fantastic meal that could have easily, easily turned out disastrous if the restaurant did not take care of us as they did.  I start to think about whether the treatment was correlated with us ordering one of the most expensive bottle of wine on the list (and we were NOT dressed to impressed, having just spent the day moving).  It must have.\n\nRegardless, I love telling this story and I love recommending Delfina to people who ask me about my favorite restaurants in San francisco, despite the impossibility of getting a table there.\n\nIt could have easily landed on my avoid at all cost list.  \n\nGood wishes to Kristy at Delfina who made our first visit there a memorable one.", "author": "Hanson L."}

I remember ordering a spaghetti that was good, but not great and the goat, which was marbled in fat and tendons, had a hairy exterior, and mostly inedible. It didn't help that we couldn't see what we were eating and out service was brusque and rushed.\n\nOur second time was much more successful and although we sat at the bar, it was some of the best service I've ever received [though I'd have to admit that being cute has its perks].\n\nLittle gem lettuce with mountain gorgonzola, seived egg, radishes and lemon vinaigrette 8.25\nMy salads have been stellar lately, with Delfina being no exception--fresh, crisp, and with the depth of gorgonzola to boot.\n\nWe then shared two mains, a pasta and a fish:\nBucatini with fresh fava beans and guanciale 13.00\nLocal petrale sole in acqua pazza --- white wine, capers, oven-dried tomatoes and olives 24.00\nThe smooth chewiness of the bucatini (a hollow spaghetti) acted as a good compliment to the grainy starch of our fava bean puree. The flavor, however, wouldn't be able to holds its own as a standalone entree. I've had the petrale sole prepared with branzino at both Kokkari and LuLu's, where the fish was much more moist. When I ordered, I knew I was getting a carbon copy of something I had already had many times before, but the special ran out half an hour after they announced it.\n\nWe ended with a Bittersweet Scharffen Berger chocolate cake with crme Anglaise, which was the same dessert I had had previously at Delfina--and with good reason. The creme Anglaise reminded me of a pool of condensed milk floating at the bottom of our moist cake. I chose the Linden Tea because of its \"buttery...natural sweetness,\" which I thought would go well with the cake. However, tea service at Delfina is a little troublesome, due to the one-cup pots and erratic espresso machine that only releases water in little spurts.", "author": "Monica T."}

There are lots of wonderful things to say about Delfina's, but this entire review will center around two items on the menu that I find myself craving at 2am...often......\n\nSpaghetti & Panna Cotta\n\nThe spaghetti served at Delfina's is swoon worthy.  It will redefine what you thought a soup bowl of pasta could be, especially with just a plain, red marinara.  After much research, the magic ingredient seems to be pepericinos (sp?) but despite the best efforts, can not be reproduced in my kitchen.  They use wonderful (and expensive) pasta from Bi-Rite according to good sources.  By all means, if you are going to Delfina's, do yourself a favor and get the spaghetti!\n\nThe Panna Cotta is another can't live without it item on their menu.  While lots of other panna cottas tend to be super sweet and more reminicient of creme brule, theirs is perfect.  I think they put a little sour cream in it or buttermilk or something, but I couldn't be sure.  The sauce that it is in changes seasonally, but it is always absolutely amazing.  \n\nBy all means, if you haven't been here, go.  Even when we couldn't get reservations, we were able to walk in and get a table within 20 minutes.  And, if you get there earlier and are bored waiting, you can go and wander the aisles of the Bi-Rite market just a few doors down.", "author": "Julie H."}

One of my favorite restaurants is Range (also in Mission) and they had similar prices and the food there is outstanding!!  I mean they do have 1 Michelin star...hehe :)\n\nFor dessert, I ordered a chocolate-cake type thing.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-19", "description": "After hearing about this place on \"Check Please Bay Area\" (PBS) with favorable reviews, my friend and I decided to give it a try. I usually like to go to a restaurant a couple of times before I pass judgment, but we probably won't return to Delfina. This is not because of the food or service, but because of the 45 mile drive we have to make to get there. It's good- but not good enough for a long drive for a special dinner. First , the bad. No full bar- beer and wine only. Now I'm certainly no alcoholic, but a pre dinner Jack and Soda is my drink preference. Why I didn't catch this on their web site, or remembering hearing about it, I don't know. Maybe I just didn't do my research well. I really needed that drink, because parking is non-existent anywhere within two blocks of this place. The web says street parking, but with all the residential housing on the street- well good luck. They have valet parking at their sister restaurant Locanda on Valenicia, two and a half blocks away. Get ready to pay $12 for the valet- up front. \nLet's talk atmosphere. There is none. Go here for the food. My companion and I both wore business casual and seemed out of place. She was surprised that it didn't look muck like the photos on their site, all blamed on great photography- kudos to their ad agency. You could come here in sweats or cargo shorts and sandals and fit right in, even though it bills itself as \"trendy\". The atmosphere is, well, kind of reminded me of Chipotle. Hard metal table- hard chairs- really casual. Casual is ok with me, but don't bill yourself as \"trendy\". \nOn to the food- the best part. We started with the Gnocchi Fritto and speck and warm olives. They were both prepared quite well, the olives warmed and bathed in garlic, hot peppers and olive oil. The speck on the Gnocchi Fritto looked a little dried out, but was a top quality brand. Next up the house salad. Excellent balsamic dressing and a generous thinly sliced shaving of Parmigiano-Reggiano atop, with a clean, well seasoned taste. We then split an order of Parpadella with a wild boar ragu. Best pasta dish I've had in a while. Perfectly balanced with the ragu sauce, the pasta was fresh and perfectly cooked. I have a feeling the pastas is the highlight here. Go for a full order. My friends entr\u00e9e was the Roasted Mary chicken. Moist and flavorful, it had a rich natural sauce surrounding it. Her olive oil mashed potato side was a perfect consistency. I decided on the Berkshire Pork Arista. Perfectly cooked and seasoned, but about 15% lost due to fat and toughness. It was a shoulder cut, and they should change this to chop cut. I would have paid a couple bucks more for a chop cut. They have a great wine list by the way, and our Barolo fit the food well.  Last, the Panne Cotta desert. Perfect. Best I've had.\nAnyway, go for the food as they have some great dishes. For a special dinner though there are better places in SF.", "author": "Nick D."}

Delfina is definitely one of those places. Uncompromisingly good, Delfina's standard roster of usual plates including the steak (request a mash for fries substitute), the mind-blowing chicken in a mushroom/wine reduction, the homemade spaghetti, gnocchi, and fish are always lovingly prepared, served simple, and always with fresh ingredients, and pair perfectly with any number of their varied wines. During the warmer months, I highly recommend booking the back patio for early dining (you must be out by 9:00 AM) for a relaxed, outdoor Mission Dolores feel.\r\n\r\nThe ambiance inside is perfectly bustling with excited faces of people who made reservations weeks in advance, and those of the lucky few who waited outside at 5:30 PM for the doors to open and snag a walk in table. I love going just a few minutes early, checking in, and then ordering and taking a glass of wine out in front of the restaurant. There are a few nice benches on the sidewalk near potted trees, and you can sip outdoors while you wait for the table to be cleared.

The reasons for my fantastic meal there last night however, are because of restaurant's impeccable service and exciting ambiance. If you want to know about the food, read the other reviews; this is an ode to Delfina's excellent staff.\n\nFirst, I do not believe that one need have intimate experience with the restaurant industry to appreciate fine dining. Yet, since I have been a hostess, server and bartender, I am overjoyed at great food coupled with great service. And I can tell you that the latter is also much harder to come by.\n\nThis popular restaurant was a buzz last night, of course being a Saturday. My partner and I live very nearby and stop by ever so often just to try to slip in. Last night, we got lucky and got a seat at the counter within minutes. This is the best view of the restaurant, in my opinion, because you get to watch the seamless operation of Delfina without feeling imposing. I am awe-struck by the genuine niceness of their large staff. It was hard to tell if anything went wrong, so gentle and smooth the employees move and talk with diners and coworkers alike. \n\nEvery single person, hostess to food runner, made us feel like we were valued guests. Even servers and chefs who didn't directly serve us threw a smile our way as we stared, bemused at the calm and graceful dance before us. They clearly pay attention to detail from the cleanliness to food, from music (not louder than conversation-level) to kind and professional service.\n\nWatching this packed restaurant pump effortlessly like a runner's heart makes me want to work for them.

From its reputation and how much I enjoyed Pizza Delfina, I had pretty high expectations.  I did my homework by reading all 5000 reviews on yelp (or almost) and contemplated very carefully over their menu posted online to see what I should be eating. \n\nWe had a group of 4.  Even though only 2 of us showed up on time for the reservation at 6 (by the way, hard to make so call early!), they gladly seated us.  So happy to see restaurants without the \"unless everyone is here, you need to be shoved into the bar area\" attitude.  \n\nIn fact, we waited for our 4th person to arrive for quite a while and didn't order anything in the mean time.  The waitress came a couple of times to check on us, but never pressured us or made us feel bad. \n\nFood is very good, but what's with the salt?  The bread was chewy and delicious until I tasted a huge chunk of salt in there.  Then I had my grilled calamari.  Wow, what a great combo of flavors.  The white beans and salad was so tasty and the calamari was tender.  But then again, there are parts of the calamari that is covered with salt.  Way too salty for my taste. \n\nI also had the Mint Tagliatelle with creme fraiche.  I love creme fraiche.  There is a huge difference between your standard creamy alfredo sauce and something creamy but light like creme fraiche.  I can barely taste the mint, but it's probably better not to overpower the dish with it.  \n\nOne friend had the dungeness crab with pasta special.  It was so flavorful and the crab tasted so fresh!  We all had a bite and loved it.  The other two friends had the steak, which they liked a lot.  One friend substituted french fries with mashed potato.  It was good. \n\nA cauliflower soup was also ordered.  I had a spoonful.  it was really good and I would have never guessed it was cauliflower, but it also tasted different from any creamy soup I have had.  \n\nFor dessert we shared the profiteroles.  They were good with strong espresso flavors, but way too sweet for our taste. \n\nWe had a very fun and pleasant dinner.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The bill was reasonable: $170 after tips and taxes for four of us, and that included some beverages, appetizers and dessert (although some are shared.)\n\nI would love to go back to try more dishes.  And hopefully next time the chef can go easy on the salt.", "author": "Candice B."}

Reservation went fine, street parking was very challenging.\n\nThe restaurant was already packed by 5PM. Hostesses were courteous and greeted us promptly. We didn't have a baby sitter so we had to bring our 9-month old, but the staff accommodated us with a high chair upon request.\n\nExpect decibel noise to be very loud during the busy hours. Also, despite the wide floors positioning of adjacent tables and chairs is very close. My wife and I were almost rubbing elbows with the couple next to us.\n\nA clean, contemporary look with lots of hanging lamps and other tidbits sets the tone for an upbeat dinner atmosphere. Wait staff can be seen walking hurriedly back and forth. Outdoor seating on the sidewalk is a less desirable option but still is available.\n\nThe menu was filled with great items, including the ribs that I ordered. My wife had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes. Our appetizer was the calamari, which had a delicious, smoky flavor and went surprisingly well with the beans. The ribs were succulent, tender and tasty. I highly recommend them! Unfortunately the mashed potatoes and my polenta was unforgivably salty, a disappointment for a business that was recommended so highly.\n\nAdditionally, for the prices that Delfina charges, their service that evening was horrible. On my wedding anniversary we had to pull teeth to get any of the staff's attention, including to take our order, to get a refill on the water and drinks, or to give comments on our salty meals. We watched as other people who were seated after us were served first. You may have to order from other customer's waiters/waitresses as you struggle to track down your own.\n\nOne positive note is that my wife received a free dessert for our wedding anniversary, and the waitress took a photo for us. But by then our mood was already soured by the quality of service and the quality of the food.\n\nThe bill was just short of $100. I do not mind spending good money on a quality experience, but Delfina failed to impress. I was bitterly reminded that the views of a local newspaper aren't necessarily accurate.

The carpaccio, crab salad, and pasta dishes were honestly quite wonderful, but the lack of love was evident, and while they pleased, they didn't delight.  \n\nThe Fulton Chicken, a tried and true warhorse of this menu, just wasn't up to snuff on the night I visited.  The stock/jus below tasted ersatz and ruined what was an otherwise perfectly cooked chicken.\n\nIf you've never been to delfina, you'll love the food.  If you've been before and haven't been back in a long time, you may be disappointed.  It's a matter of perspective: for some, Venice is perfectly satisfying as it is, for some, it's the rotted husk of a once-was empire quietly sliding into a swamp.  Same thing with Delfina now, I feel--it's a matter of perspective.", "author": "Kosuke I."}

Not only was it difficult to get a reservation but the place was packed to the gills on a Tuesday night and it was difficult to enjoy the company of the people I was eating with.  The food was tasty enough but it was very rich and fairly greasy and was a long way from blowing my mind. If I want a meal that relies so heavily on the fat content for its flavor, I'll order cheap Chinese takeout for half the price. If I pay 25 dollars for a plate of food I expect something more.  No offence to my boyfriend's mom who treated us to dinner, but I don't think I'll be going back. \r\n\r\nOn a more positive note, I have heard really good things about the Delfina pizza place right next door.

Hands down!\n\nYou ask, \"How could this be?\"\n\nI have herd from quit a few people that we had to go there. There was a two week wait for reservations. We finally got in...\n\nThis was my experience.\n\nThe first thing that struck me was the menu was boring and straight forward. Fish, Chicken, Rabbit or Skirt Steak. I had the calamari which was nice, bitter green salad was good but nothing special, and the Rabbit was decent but nothing worth talking about. The waitress had was nice. The 60.00 bottle of wine  which was recommended should have cost 35.00.\nWe were sat outside in the back under a heat lamp that felt like a blast furnace! The chairs were very uncomfortable, the table felt awkward and wobbly. I don't recommend sitting outside!\n\nSo yes, it wasn't bad, it overall was a nice dinner. But after waiting 2 weeks to eat there and having to call to verify our reservation which was very annoying, It wasn't even close to the hype! I was expecting to be blown away, not even close.\n\nWe had a much better time there about two months ago when we walked in with no reservation and sat at the bar. We had apps and wine. The bartender was really sweet.\n\nI know that you can't judge a place by a single experience and I'll try again but I think Dalphina probably use to be amazing and now is just a shadow of it's former self.

So, I tried and tried to get a reservation a decent time, and finally I randomly got  a reservation for Wednesday at 8:30.\n\nWe walked in right on time and were seated immediately. Love it. Then, they sat us in the far right corner table, only the best table in the restaurant. I know this was purely coincidental, but it was still awesome.\n\nService is warm and friendly, the bread they give you is from Tartine, and is soft, bready and delicious (especially with the room-temperature butter they give you). \n\nOur server gladly reccomended a wine in our price range that was delicious. But even better was when the server delievering our bread accidentally knocked over my glass! It wasn't that big of a deal, but the staff was so accommodating it was completely refreshing. They cleaned up our table right quick, and had another glass of wine on the way for me.\n\nThen the food came. My BFF ordered the  Mint tagliatelle with artichokes and mascarpone ( in addition to a superior pre-pasta salad). I ordered the gnocchi with rabbit. Both dishes were absolutley fantastic. Not overly heavy, just heavenly. \n\nWe witnessed the table next to us order the profiteroles, so we couldn't escape them, despite being somehwat-full from dinner. So glad we didn't leave without trying them. Crispy on the outside, cool and yummy on the inside, with  bittersweet chocolate sauce and almonds to boot.\n\nIt definitely is pricey, but you get what you pay for.

We were able to get a 5:30 reservation, 2 days out.  We arrived at 5:00 and waited on the benches outside and people watched and visited.  We were the first to be seated and the restaurant filled up quickly.   We happened to have a bottle of wine that was given to my husband earlier in the day, so that worked out great. Corkage is $18. The atmosphere was just what I was looking for a special occasion and I love the music they play, at a perfect volume.  I had the roast chicken with mushrooms and mashed potatoes - very delish! My husband and daughter thought likewise of the brisket. My youngest daughter enjoyed the pasta with wild boar ragu.  We also shared, the best brussel sprouts we'd ever had. I guess the secret ingredient was pork fat..no wonder they were so good.  The only thing I wasn't impressed by was the spaghetti, but my daughter liked it and ate it all.  I thought it was nothing special, but many people rave about it here.  We had the grilled calamari with warm bean salad, also good.  For dessert, oh my, we had the panna cotta and the warm, filled, donuts, I don't remember what they were called, but were a wonderful way to finish a memorable meal. Service was perfect.  Friendly, but professional. Not a hint of snobbery (pet peeve of mine).   Yes, it was pricey, but it was a special occasion for us, and we felt it was worth it.", "author": "Annie D."}

Finally we did last Friday for a 9:30 dinner with our friends. I like the space and atmosphere a lot, it's a cozy space. The hostess and the waitress were very sweet and make you feel welcome immediately. I am giving a 4 star base primarily on the homemade pasta. The texture is just so good, it is more than just the Al Dente texture, it was just right, chewy but breaks easily with every bite. It was just right, and the unique texture only handmade noodle has. I had the wild boar ragu, the ragu sauce is good, but just like any good ragu, the noodle was the key. My date had the ravioli filled with prosciutto and mascarpone, again, the noodle skin was perfect, but the filling was a bit on the salty end. Of course, it's because of the prosciutto, but it could have been balanced with more of the mascapone. Another note is on the serving size, in US, we are not accustomed to order from appetizer all the way to dessert.

Food is flavorful and of good quality.  The wine was good although I know nothing of it other than I like to drink it.  Service was prompt and professional.  It's nice to see the owners are still involved in the day to day operation.  Given my background in the restuarant industry (a wretched and sordid affair), I admire the Stolls for their dedication and effort.  They deserved and have worked for the success they are enjoying right now.", "author": "Mr. and Mrs. L."}

All I f@#%ing heard about for months was this place. \"So and so went to Delfina, and she loved it!\" or \"This one and that one said it was great\" and \" We went to SuppenKuchen LAST week and the week before!\" and the inevitable \"No I don't want another cancun burrito!\" \n\nSo finally when my girl won a 100$ gift card, we went. And man, do the rich eat well. And now after a series of promotions and pay raises at work I TOO can experience the joys of eating at Delfina once a month. I TOO can now know what a thirty dollar glass of wine tastes like. I TOO can be that guy who loved Delfina in the story that some other dudes' girl nags some other dude to the point of acquiescence about. \n\nCheers Delfina. You're pretentious neighborhood location is trumped by your capacity to prepare and serve delicious cuisine. My girlfriend was so nice to me for days afterwards.

The first pick was Delfina as it is my co-worker Chantal's home away from home. When I first met her she was eating dinner at Delfina a few times a week. Her love for all things Delfina is admirable and as a nod to her we decided to make it our first stop.\n\nBy the time we all met her at Delfina, there was already wine being poured and bread being broken. It was critical that we went on any day except Monday or Tuesday as those are the only days where they don't feature fresh baked bread from neighbor Tartine. Make it a priority for your visit as the Tartine bread is truly a work of culinary art. Soft, moist centers with a crunchy crust quickly absorb and melt the butter you choose to bless it with. Paired with our Prosecco, it was a harmonious flavor explosion of yeasty, sour, buttery and sweet. You could make a whole meal out those three ingredients and I would happily do so any night of the week.\n\nHere is what we ordered:\n\nAntipasti & Contorni: Grilled fresh calamari with warm white bean salad, Salt cod mantecato with walnut oil and fennel seed flatbread, Warm Castelvetrano olives & the Sardines.\n\nEverything was blow my mind amazing. Honestly, I could write for days about just the appetizers but I will spare all of you and just say that the Castelvetrano olives alone were so good that I felt like the universe stopped for just a moment and everything in my life was absolutely perfect. The calamari were some of the freshest I have ever tasted, the salt cod mantecato was so so salty and good that i wanted to take a bath in it and finally the sardines--oh the sardines. If you think you don't like them, please go and have them at Delfina, it will make you a believer. They are incredibly fresh and are not cured so they don't have the normal pungent fishy flavor you would expect. They are phenomenal.\n\nSecondi: One Halibut dish, One chicken dish, One pork shoulder dish and three orders of hanger steak.\n\nThe main dishes brought with them our second bottle of  juicy wine. Silence ensued for about five minutes until everyone was ready to share thoughts and bites. Everyone was very pleased. The only thing I would have like is for my steak to have been cooked a few seconds longer. I am a fan of the perfect medium rare cut of meat but I think my steak may have been a little undercooked and was chewier than I would have liked. Other than that the fries were cooked with fresh rosemary and quite spectacular. The fish dish was delicate and very tasty but my favorite main of the night was the pork shoulder. Perfectly tender and flavorful, lucky for me this dish was seated to the right of me for easy access.\n\nDolci & Formaggi: Buttermilk panna cotta with caramel and kumquats & the cheese tasting plate paired with glasses of Moscato d'Asti-Sori del Re\n\nI have to say that after the panna cotta at Incanto I was let down a little bit. The styles were pretty different as Delfina uses buttermilk for theirs so the taste is much more yogurty and opposed to light and creamy like a flan which is my preference. Even so, I appreciated the fresh approach and thought the the caramel and kumquats were very nice addition. The cheeses were all delicious and made me wish that I could enjoy a cheese plate with every one of my meals. My favorite dessert was definitely the glass of  Moscato. It was light and sweet and did not have that syrupy consistency that I dislike in so many dessert wines. It made me a total fan and now I order Moscato as often as I can.\n\nAs you can see, I still ended up writing for days about Delfina because it is not only a great restaurant but also a perfect example of of how the food movement in San Francisco has been taken to new heights. For that same reason, Delfina has a huge following and without a reservation you'll definitely be waiting for a table. I don't say this often but it is definitely worth the wait.\n\nNote (upon request from fellow yelper Lily):  Why 4 stars and not 5 you say--well, I love my steaks and my hanger steak wasn't quite as awesome as I was expecting. I already have my next date planned and I am sure the 5th star will follow, stay tuned...", "author": "Sugey G."}

The restaurant environment was bright, \"airy\", and very down-to-earth.  Part of the restaurant has this long \"bench-style\" seats which became quite uncomfortable for the \"behind\" after 2 hours.  But the food made it all worthwhile.\n\nService was 5 stars!  Our server was pleasant, helpful, and knowledgeable.  He never rushed us, he took the time to explain the menu, made recommendations - he was just great!  I can tell he loves his job.  I think he's name is Matthew.\n\nNow the appetizers...Our favorite was the Grilled Fresh Calamari & Warm White Bean Salad.  We liked it so much that we ordered two!  It has this garlicky with a hint of lemon flavor.  Its sauce was not intimidating at all and most importantly, the calamari was fresh and not overcooked.  A must try!\n\nWe also tried the Snails with Celery.  I liked this appetizer.  Not as much as the calamari but it was good.  My husband wasn't as thrilled about it though.  Anyway, it has this gelatin-like taste, tender but not \"rubbery\" and the snails was fresh as well.\n\nFor our Entrees...\nBBQ Pork Ribs with Beans- flavorful but not unique.  Meat was tender and perfectly cooked.   The downside was it tasted more like Texan BBQ dish than Italian.  Maybe let go of the beans and substitute it with risotto. \nSteak -Flavorful taste but the meat wasn't as tender.  Order it medium, it will taste better.   The fries that came with it were good.\n\nNow the Desserts...\nCheese Plate (of course!) was just ok...nothing special.\n\nWarm Chocolate Cake - portion was perfect.  The texture and sweetness were well-balanced.  Just yummy!\n\nHazelnut Cantucci (?) - Another nice dessert.  Perfect with the coffee!", "author": "Elaine C."}

Foods that challenge the tongue and fill the belly are just the kinda foods that I like and I am happy to report that Delfina is a great provider of such foods. \n\nBoth the restaurant and the pizzeria always seem jam packed, so I was lucky to find a single bar seat on a Sunday evening. The waitstaff was pretty friendly for the most part, though almost too nice and seemingly fake at some points. Fortunately, Delfina's cuisine speaks for itself and is absolutely delicious! For the evening, I went with the house cured anchovies, stewed tripe in tomato sauce and the chocolate olive oil torte. The anchovies were seasoned perfectly with lemon, salt and olive oil and brought a briny goodness to the tongue. I loved the stewed tripe that was served in a hot ramekin and topped with bread crumbs. The meat was buttery and tender and literally, was just like what grandma used to make. When eaten with the AMAAAZING rustic slices of bread (made at Tartine next door), it was hearty, comforting, and down right delicious! The meal concluded with the torte which was moist and melted right in your mouth. The olive oil and coarse sea salt on top of the cake really made it special and memorable. It's deliciousness factor definitely could have been that much more by serving it a little bit hotter. \n\nMy solo session at Delfina was quite enjoyable and brought much comfort to my uneasiness and stress. This great little neighborhood joint hit the spot and has me wishing that I lived closer to it, so I could eat there more often.", "author": "Christina N."}

We shared the olives as a starter (though we all agreed it should be a larger portion), and two of us had the scallop appetizer while my roommate had a small salad, all of which were delicious. One of my favorite parts about Delfina was that they give you the option to \"half\" any of the pasta orders- who really needs, or will eat, several pounds of pasta? The portions in some restaurants are just ridiculous, and upon receiving the half portion of spaghetti I ordered, I was pleased that it was just enough to fill me up without any leftovers.

And the sauce, broccoli and fries were extremely salty, so much so that we couldn't even finish!  \n\nWe did end with profiteroles.  Mostly yummy but the pastry was a bit too hard and crunchy and not buttery and pastry-ish.\n\nAnyhow, a disappointing experience, actually, considering our bill came to $70!  We could have gone next door for great pizza for half the price.  So I guess 6 months from now, when we have a chance to go on our next date, we'll go elsewhere.", "author": "J E."}

I wasn't impressed with our entrees, however. The spaghetti was very good and at $13 the tiny portion wasn't too troubling, but the tiny portion for the $20 Rosemary Tagliatelle (the flavor is good, but honestly, a bit reminiscent of Hamburger Helper) was a little silly. We had to fill up on another bread bowl after the meal and the server seemed used to offering more bread after the meal. Maybe it is intended that you would order from each course. I'd be happy to spend the money for multiple courses if the quality was the same as the appetizer, but based on the pasta dishes, I'm not sure. Service and atmosphere were lovely though. Doing it again, I'd put our name in at the busy Delfina Pizzeria next door, then pop over to the restaurant only for the prosciutto appetizer and a drink while I wait.", "author": "Melanie G."}

However, last night I had an experience that a good restaurant shouldn't provide.\n\nMy rabbit dish was cold in the center. I pointed it out to the server and was gracious about it. Too gracious, in fact, because they charged me full price ($24) for a dish I obviously couldn't eat, as I sent it away, with some of the outsides eaten (where it was warm) but most of it uneaten.\n\nI don't like to be a jerk to restaurants. I know they have a hard business. But this time, they dropped the ball.\n\nSince posting this, I got an email from a Yelper asking why I didn't complain. If it was a sandwich shop, I would have. I had a lengthy conversation with the server at the time I sent it back, but I don't like to haggle over the check at a nice restaurant. \n\nI don't need to tell you Delfina makes good pastas and appetizers -- there are, today, 760 Yelp reviews, many making those points.

Granted, I should have asked how much is a glass of white wine, but I left it to the waitress to decide.  The bill for 2 glasses was 32 dollars.  Now, am I wrong in thinking that they should have told me the price, asked me if that was OK?, presented me with the wine list (It was given to my husband when he ordered his red wine)?

Our waitress was clearly upset by something that happened at some other table, but seemed to take it out on everyone else. The last time the waiter came back smelling like an ashtray.

We got in right away, but only because we accepted a makeshift table they set up in the aisle by the kitchen, on the way to the toilets.   The waiter was friendly and somewhat helpful, although he said the best thing on the menu was the spaghetti, which my daughter ordered. We found out that it was in fact ....spaghetti. Long noodles with a dollop of tomato sauce on top. My wife ordered the duck and I had the roast pork. We started with some Brussels sprouts and French fries as appetizers, which was good because the entree portions were modest, and my pork dish had no sides. Food quality and taste were quite good on all fronts, so no complaints there. Service, however, was unimpressive. We ordered coffee and dessert at the same time, and the dessert was served and eaten well before the coffee came out. Also, while I realize our table was set up in an aisle-way, we were bumped and kicked by passing servers several times, none of whom bothered to apologize or even acknowledge that they had made contact.  Overall, I left feeling like this was one of those trendy San Francisco places where we were supposed to feel honored that we had been able to be there.

I thought you were going to be like your more low-key counterpart, Pizzaria Delifina. But no, you left me thirsty as hell, not thirsty for more. \n\nThe service, I can't complain about. Our hostess asked to take our coats and was super sweet. But let's not kid ourselves. Who walks into a restaurant just for the service? \n\nWe started off with the Grilled Fresh Calamari with warm white bean salad. That was probably my favorite part of my meal. The calamari was perfectly cooked, not too chewy. My only gripe about it was that it was too salty, so my recommendation is to eat it with the salad, to take away from the saltiness. But I soon learned that salt was going to be the theme for the rest of the night. \n\nNext up, we got the Spaghetti with plum tomatoes, garlic, extra virgin olive oil and peperoncini. To be honest, and I hate to say it, but I think I've made better spaghetti using Barilla Mushroom and Garlic Sauce. \n\nFor my main entr\u00e9e, I got the Meyer Ranch Hanger Steak. Our waitress recommended that I have it medium rare, so I got just that. Usually when I order my steaks, I expect to see a huge slab of mean, oozing in juicy happiness, ready for me to dig in like a cardiologist performing a triple bypass. But nope, I didn't get the joy of doing that because my steak came pre-cut. WHAT THE HELL IS THAT ABOUT??? I can cut my own steak, thank you very much. Anyways, the thing with hanger steaks is that they are usually very tough, so they need to be properly marinated in order to break down some of the proteins, in effort to tenderize the meat. This is where Delifina succeeds. The steak itself was quite juicy, and was very flavorful. Maybe too flavorful, to a fault, because at some point, it was just...marinade...and SALT that I was chewing into. Nonetheless, it was still a quality steak that didn't require additional assistance in the whole pre-cut department. I thoroughly enjoyed the fries - I believe they used Yukon gold potatoes, because it tasted nothing like Russets. They were done right and tasted delicious! \n\nI also had a bite of the artic char (special for the night). That was also pretty darn salty as well. \n\nSo all in all, I think it was a quality meal, but I'm sure they could have laid off on the salt overload. I think I consumed enough salt to cover the yearly recommended sodium intake for a small, third-world country that night.", "author": "Blenda L."}

That's right...I'm not sure if you are ready to let your little Laura fly away into coupledom during which time Yelp will become the red-headed step child I am ashamed of and lock in the basement and occassionally beat.  This time, next week, I'll most likely be engaged to be married.  Unless I'm really not.  Which brings me the actual date.  Here is how the big D went down and I can be 100% honest because I'm like 90% sure this fool is way too cool for school/Yelp.  We met through a mutual friend and he emailed me to ask me to have coffee (GAY) and talk about how the world is fucked.  I, of course, am amenable on the world being fucked front and so I said, how about you buy me dinner (as i am poor AND fat!  some might call me a double threat!) and you have yourself a deal, sir!  and by deal, i of course mean, easy lay.    \n\nDelfina is the ultimate first date place, according to yelpers, zagats, chowhound, my parents and that homeless dude who soft shoe(lesse)s in front of Tartine.  So, I didn't make the plans but when he suggested Delfina I was like, \"PREDICTABLE.  SNOOZE.\"  but again, beggars can't be choosers and I've always had a delicious time at Delfina so Delfina it is!  Now, the food was great and the conversation so-so-meh but I have one huge problem with this place and that is this:  the waitresses are freaking Goddesses.  I'm not trying to have a first date at some place where I look like I have down's syndrome in comparison to these beautiful sirens.  I felt like fucking Beauty and The Beast up in that bitch.  Not cool.  Seriously, first date place, Yelp?  First date if you want your prospective husband to go home and jerk it to the chick who served you Pasta Putanesca!  I mean, for realz. I cry, \"uncle\" to Delfina.  I cannot win in a situation like this.  You know what a perfect first date place is?  McDonald's.  And here's why: They employ actual retards.  It's part of the leg up program or whatever it's called which is just darling and I love it AND you can't help but seem attractive and semi-sane in comparison with the differently abled.  It's win/win, people!  Man, fools at McDonald's are having awesome dates and I'm over here at Delfina's trying to feign interest in what this jackass across from me is blathering on about and it's damn hard when i want to beat a bitch down based solely on her unholy good looks.  i want to beat her and then make out with her, GOD HELP ME.  When I decided I wanted to make out with the waitress more than i wanted to make out with hipster mc useless start-up across the table, I knew this was not MTB (look it up, people.  we were all teenage girl's once.  for some of the women on this site, it was mere weeks ago.)  The other clue that this was not the man for me was at this moment in our conversation:\n\nDate Boy:  God, it's such a beautiful day today, don't you think?  And you know what day it is, right?  The first day of spring!\n\nLaura B.: GAY!\n\nAnyway, Delfina.  Delicious and a few vegan options (and the kitchen is very accommodating...upon learning i am vegan, the chef made me spaghetti with all sorts of delightful vegetables in it including my favorite, artichoke hearts! i love those little suckers!  the fries are always amazing...thin and crispy with herbs and salt...POIFECT!) but awful, terrible first date place.  Actually, I'm sure it would be fine if you had a healthy self esteem and sense of your own worth.  Which i'm assuming you don't as you are a woman.  Even if you are a man who reads my reviews, you are a woman and this world can often be hard on the thinking, feeling lady.

The food is always delicious, and I really love the bustling and warm atmosphere. The last time I went, however, our server was so amazing that I wanted to write a Yelp review specifically to commend her as well as the extra tasty lamb ravioli and always delicious panna cotta we had that night.\n\nTo start off with, our server was very knowledgeable about the menu as well as friendly and warm. These attributes, however, are to be expected of a Delfina server. This next bit is what sets her apart: For one of our plates that evening, we ordered the wild nettle soup with creme fraiche and trumpet mushrooms. I have a thing for nettles, so I sort of forced ordering this dish on my dinning partners. The soup was good--the mushrooms added an interesting texture and the creme fraiche cut the chlorophyll filled pure nicely--but the soup wasn't great, like the rest of the meal. About half way through eating the soup, we all got a little bored of eating it and so stopped. Our server asked us if we liked it, and we replied that it was good, but not great, and that we sort of thought maybe a bit more creme faiche would have been good. Truthfully, the reason we stopped eating the soup is because we wanted panna cotta and if we had kept eating, we would have burst at the seems. (This brings me to the lamb ravioli--it was AMAZING!!!!! the pasta was delicate, the lamb inside was tender, and the reduction sauce complimented the dish wonderfully).\n\nAnyways, the rest of the meal went as planned. The panna cotta was amazing and our server continued to be lovely. When the bill came, however, she told us that she took the soup off the bill as we didn't love it. Um, she really didn't need to do that....like really.

Sad to say, I probably won't make an effort to go to the restaurant. Reservation is a must. Parking is at a premium, so I highly recommend getting there as early as possible before your reservations, There were four of us and were quickly sat by nice window seat. Had plenty of time to order. Waiter was very pleasant and helpful. We ordered two appetizers. Calamari and the warm Olives. Both were very delicious. All four of us ordered separate items. I was the only one happy with my pick. I had the Pork Shoulder on Risotto. Meat was very tender and the Risotto prepared perfectly. I ate it all. My wife ordered Sea Bass and it was well overcooked. My daughter ordered the Hanger Steak, also well over done and chewy. Definitely not prime and my son order Raviolli stuffed with Prosciutto. Not tender at all. As for dessert, we had the Pear Torte with I think it was a Sorbet and a Chocolate Cake. Anyway, they were both fabulous. We gobbled them down. As for the tab, I think it was way over on price for what we ordered, Csme close to $300.00, including tip. BTW, we did order three glasses of wine. If the price was $100.00 cheaper, maybe will go back. Very disappointed with main courses. Have had similar dishes that were well prepared and tasted better. Maybe, it was a off night...??? Oh, well.", "author": "J G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2008-01-27", "description": "I cannot believe that this place has garnered such postiive reviews.  I have rarely had such a horrible dining experience as I had on Saturday night at Delfina.  From the nauseating mirrors, to the hypocritical owners, to the offensive waitress, to the mediocre food, and finally to overpriced wine list, I was pissed off for the entire time I was here.\n\nLet's start out with why I was even here.  I had heard great things about Delfina, and my girlfriend, sweetheart that she is, decided to surprise me for my birthday with reservations.  Delfina almost ruined my birthday.  It was saved by Bourbon and Branch, but that's for another review.  \n\nAs soon as we sat down, I picked up a small pamphlet on the table.  It was from the owners, and it explained that they supported universal health care.  It went on to explain that rather than raise prices to pay for their employees' health care, they were adding $1.25 to every bill PER PERSON!  This means you are raising prices!  You don't want your profits cut into.  You tried to seem all San Franciso touchy feely by stating you support such a great cause, but you are really a hypocritical bastard because you are forcing me to pay for it because you cannot manage your finances and costs.  Most San Francisco people hate the corporate demon, but I'll take the corporate wags over the hypocrites from Delfina anyday because at least they're honest.\n\nNext up on the Delfina's crap parade was our waitress.  I don't like to be touched by strangers.  She spent the entire night rubbing, touching, and feeling.  I should have had the balls to tell her to stop and that her behavior was totally inappropriate.  I did not.  My girlfriend offered several times to switch seats with me, but I decided to play the martyr instead.  Probably so I could complain later.  I had already made up my mind to never return to Delfina because of her, but that was before my food ever arrived.  You would think that my very noticeable flinches would have given her a clue that I WANTED HER TO STOP, but she was as stupid as she was inappropriate.\n\nNow to the food.  Mediocre...at best.  I say mediocre because of the bread.  The bread was good.  Nothing else came close.  The portions were pathetically small considering the prices.  The calamari appetizer came with three pieces of squid.  Boo hiss.  The chicory salad was just bad.  There were very limited choices for someone like me who does not eat meat.  In fact the entire menu was limited.  I like some choices when I go out to eat.  Pasta Pomodoro has more options than Delfina.  I guess the chef does not have much imagination or ability.  The bucatini with Monterey sardines lacked something...actually several things.  When a menu states sardines in the plural, I expect several sardines.  There was a small portion of maybe half a sardine ground up in the bucatini.  I don't like menus that outright lie.  As for the bucatini, could you spare a little?  If I am going to be served a child's portion, please let me know and charge me for a child's portion.  I was not satisfied in the least.  By the time we got home, I was hungry again.  This should never happen at an Italian restaurant.  Although I am hard pressed to call Delfina an Italian restaurant.  It is more in line with the fraud that is A-16.\n\nThe wine list was horrendously overpriced.  There were very few selections in a reasonable price range.  Most bottles were well into the $75 and over category.  We sampled a couple of the less expensive bottles, and they sucked!  For the ridiculous mark up the hypocritical owners were charging, they could have easily erased the $1.25 they were adding to the bill.\n\nBack in Jersey we have a word for the owners and proprietors for Delfina.  We call them gavones.  This translates as loser and fake Italian.  It is rare that I encounter a restaurant that makes me want to actively campaign against it.  Delfina is such a place.  Totally ruined my birthday.  My girlfriend deserves her money back.", "author": "Chris I."}

I had the duck sugo, and let me tell you, I didn't know duck could taste like that! It was incredible. My dad and I also shared the gulf shrimp, which were amazing as well. \n\nSadly, the service here was worth less than 1 star. I took my dad here for fathers day, and though we had a reservation and arrived right on time, we had to wait for 15 minutes. Completely understandable, considering its an extremely popular and tiny restaurant. We sit, the waiter takes our order about 10 minutes later, and the meal is off to a good start! We get our appetizers and enjoy them, the buss boy takes them away, and then we wait. We waited for literally an hour between when our appetizers were taken and our entrees came out. In the meantime, two tables sit on either side of us, and they not only get their food before us, though they arrived 15 minutes later, but they ordered the same thing as us! Our waiter during this whole thing is nowhere to be seen. At one point, the hostess or manager came over and apologized for the wait, which was nice, though the waiter should have taken care of that himself. If it had stopped there, I would have given this place 4 stars because the food really was spectacular. But WHILE we are waiting for our food, and the table next to us is enjoying theirs, the waiter comes by with a few side dishes for them that were \"a gift from the kitchen\". WTF?!?! We wait an hour for our food, and yet the people next to us who enjoyed prompt and attentive service get a gift from the kitchen??\n\nWe got our food, scarfed it down since we were starving by this point, and then the waiter finally reappears to take our dessert order. I politely told him we'd pass (come on, bi-rite is across the street!) and he had the nerve to try and hock some dessert that I already told him we didn't want. That was the last time I saw our waiter, the buss boy gave us our check and change. \n\nI was so disappointed in my experience here. I would come back because the food was so darn good had the waiter/manager been more apologetic or tried to rectify the situation. Obviously they knew they had fucked up but don't care enough about their customers to make it right.", "author": "Em G."}

So last weekend we came here for my dad's bday. I didnt know that they changed menus everyday? So the day I came it was actually very difficult to find something i actually enjoyed. I ordered some type of linguine pasta and it wasn't that good. On the other hand my mom ordered the cod (i think, or maybe some other type of fish) and it was delicious! She was nice enough to trade so I ended up eating the fish instead. I brought cake and they told me they'd keep it in the back for me, on top of that they brought it out with candles and sliced the cake for us! Excellent service....the food was just okay, but maybe I'd come again some other time and try their pizzas next door. Ended up with a $200 tab, which is pretty cheap for a party of 5. Oh and my mother was allergic to their salads bc they weren't aware of her allergies and gave us a free salad. Very good management.", "author": "Colette P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-05-12", "description": "i almost feel like giving delfina 5 stars is practically redundant, but i had such a phenomenal experience and meal there last night that i had to sing my praises. i'd dined at delfina twice prior to this experience, and had already deemed it one of my favorite restaurants in sf. my experience last night was just a confirmation of that!\r\n\r\ni met a friend there around 8:15 thursday night and he'd already put our name down on the list, so we decided to have a drink at the bar while we were waiting. i tried a white from the friulli region of italy, but the name is escaping me! it was light and not too sweet, but still with some fruit undertones (almost like melon or tropical fruit). the overall effect of the flavor was like a sauvignon blanc but it had the smoothness of a chardonnay.\r\n\r\nafter waiting about 20 minutes, a spot opened up at the counter (the one that bisects the restaurant, in the main room). we decided to take it and immediately after sitting down, we were furnished with delicious rustic bread, sweet butter, and some cured olives.\r\n\r\nas we peered into the menu, i wanted to order each and every thing on it! after much debate and deliberation, we decided to start with the \"little gem lettuce with parmigiano frico and lemon-anchovy vinaigrette.\" it was kind of a take on flavors from a ceasar salad, but far more sophisticated. the parmigiano frico is a parmesean crisp, and the sweetness and nuttiness of the fresh parmesean exploded in my mouth.\r\n\r\nthe waitress asked if we wanted to split everything, so she had each and every dish brought out into two mini-sized portions. great touch, i have to say.\r\n\r\nnext, we had the pappardelle and lamb sugo with black-eyed peas. this dish was excellent. it perfectly complemented the barbera i was drinking. the sauce (sugo) was perfect: not too thick, not too rich, full of morsels of lamb, and tasted beautiful with the acids in my wine.\r\n\r\nnext was a huge surprise: our waitress brought out 2 half portions of their other pastas --the pasta alla chitarra with fresh fava beans and house-cured guanciale, and wild nettle ravioli with bellwether ricotta and walnuts. at first i was like, oh sorry, we didn't order these, and the waitress just said \"it's a gift from the kitchen!\"\r\n\r\nhow awesome is that?!?!?!?! the ravioli was to-die-for. the flavors were all fantastic. they were lightly dressed in a brown butter and sage sauce, which went beautifully with the flavors of nettle, ricotta, and walnuts. the ricotta filling was also redolent of fresh lemon, so this dish had almost an ethereal light quality to it. very heavenly, indeed!\r\n\r\nthe pasta alla chitarra was an interesting dish. in italian, a chitarra is a guitar, but also describes a special machine for cutting pasta. the pasta had a fantastic texture, almost square shaped on the sides rather than round. for my tastes, i found this dish too salty, probably because of the guanciale. guanciale, for those of you that don't know, is a cured (not smoked) bacon used similarly to pancetta. it's actually taken from the pork cheeks/jowls rather than the belly. it has a lovely, light flavor but provides a significant amount of salt to the dish. the fava beans paired beautifully with the surrounding flavors.\r\n\r\nwe were bordering on stuffed at this point, but then our california white sea bass with artichokes and potatoes sott'olio arrived with a contorni (side) of broccoli rabe with garlic and chiles ... and we immediately forgot how full we were! everything was delectable. it was like the food kept getting better and better! the fish was sweet and tender, perfectly cooked -- not overdone at all. the artichokes were crisp and fresh, just lightly cooked to complement the fish. the broccoli rabe, which i usually don't care for, was fantastic. it's amazing how a vegetable prepared well is amazingly delicious. broccoli rabe, which is the in cruciferous family, tends to share that same bitterness with broccoli, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, etc. it was just perfectly sauteed with garlic, olive oil, and pepperoncini (pepper flakes) and had a sweet, fresh taste to it. no soggy greens here!\r\n\r\nfor dessert, we indulged in the bittersweet scharffen berger chocolate cake with crme anglais. i'm one of those people that i when i see that kind of dessert on the menu, i absolutely cannot resist. it was very good, simple but delicious. the warm bittersweet chocolate and the cool creme anglais are like heaven on the tongue.\r\n\r\nthe wait staff here is fantastic; down-to-earth but extremely knowledgeable and professional. you feel well taken care of -- every whim and desire will be met and surpassed!\r\n\r\ndelfina, you have done it again... i am a slave to your incredible food! thank you for such a wonderful meal!!!!", "author": "Jill M."}

Not sure where Cyn was.......Read my other reviews if you don't believe that I am a (self indulgent) foodie and know my stuff!\n\nThere were four of us and we started with the Grilled calamari (still the best ever---I take back what I said about the beans in my first review), fresh-cured anchovies (not over-pickled; we were told they only spend 8 minutes in vinegar), and the sardines.  The sardines had a strong flavor for me, but my companions who actually enjoy oily fish loved them.  The anchovies were out of this world for me...perfect in flavor with just a mild vinegar bite.  We all had the porcini  mushroom salad next...oh my gosh these fresh local mushrooms simply melted like butter in our mouths and the dandelion greens were perfect...not bitter.  I can't say too much.  Then we had trofie with pesto, prosciutto-mascarpone ravioli, a risotto special with fresh summer squash, and the chicken, which came with the olive oil mashed potatoes.  These potatoes are just delicious, as was the chicken itself...very moist.  The ravioli was as perfect a pasta dish as you could ever hope for....pure ambrosia.  Nothing less--perfect 10.  The risotto was pronounced magnificent (I am not a squash fan).  The pesto dish was fresh and delicious but could have used a touch of salt (hey, SOMETHING had to be wrong!).\n\nThe profiteroles with coffee gelato and the chocolate cake with olive oil ice cream were just fabulous and shared easily.

Who should go here:   Anyone looking for a fun/popular place to dine with very good atmosphere and good food.  California Cuisine meets Italy.  Delfina is worth visiting if you live in the city and for you out of towners a great place if you want to tread off the beaten path from your normally Little Italy/Union Square spots.\n \n1 Star - Lacking/Turn Off\n2 Stars - Needs Work, But fixable\n3 Stars - Adequate\n4 Stars - Near perfect, rough edge here or there\n5 Stars - Can't get much Better\n \nAtmosphere/Ambience:  3.5 to 4 stars.  If hip and fun were all that matters here Delfina would get 4 to 5 stars in this category.  The vibe is always great, you will likely never have a dead or boring dinner here.  However, to me the place lacks a little bit of elegance/sophistication that I find at some  4/5 star places.  It is a little cramped and tables are tight, so be prepared to share with the table next to you (actually not really that bad).  Noise level is high but acceptable.\n \nService: 3 stars.  I really liked our waitress here, but I feel the service is lacking the innovative extras you get at some restaurants.  I did expect a bit more from Delfina, which is why I am knocking them a star here.  I wanted them to know more about the food and wines on the menu.  Their comment when I asked about a dish was always \"Oh, its really good\".  Well thanks that helps.  Wine knowledge goes even less deep.  Luckily the food is good enough that you will like most dishes.  Service is NOT bad, nor were they rude, in fact they were super nice and didn't let anything slip.  I just found there to be tiny holes, that could make the experience here more enjoyable. \n \nFood: 4 stars.  Delfina has been turning out awesome fare for several years now.  I am happy to say they have not slipped an inch here.  There is some good innovation in several of their dishes, and I love how they take traditional Italian cuisine and merry it with the best of California cuisine (fresh local ingredients, lighter cooking styles, etc).  Last time I dined there I had the beef crudo (steak Tartar) and the mint pasta with chanterelles.  The app was OK, I have had much better Italian versions of this dish.  I would recommend maybe choosing a different option from the starters.  The mint pasta with mushrooms was delicious, and highly recommend it if you are a vegetarian pasta eater, for you meat lovers this might not completely satisfy you.  Also tried the quail, which was very good, and probably the best of the dishes that night.  This night at Delfina didn't really match my tastes but I could still really appreciate the quality, fresh ingredients, innovation/style, and flavors.\n \nWine: 2 stars.  For a restaurant that focuses on Italian and is very well known and is considered by many to be a classic restaurant in the city, it just blows me away how sub par the wine list is.  One page?  No focus on regions?  Give me a break.  I was hoping to get a brunello and was blown away they only had 2 options and one year, 2000, the worst in about a decade.  Come on guys.  Please call A16, Incanto, or Acquerello for some help with your Italian list.  If you want some exciting Italian wine, bring your own.  Btw, nothing really exciting on the by the glass list either.  This really puts me in a downer about this place.  They can fix though, and I look forward to this positive development.\n \nOverall:  3.5 stars.  A fun, hip place that serves up some of the freshest Italian food in the city.  Always exciting and always a good time.  A must visit for residents of the city and visitors alike.

My name is Haley, and I am a pre-dining order crafter.\n\nYou who share this same disorder may well know but may refuse to admit what this sad addiction entails. The second one pre-dining order crafter clicks \"reserve\" on open table (and sometimes even before) he or she rushes to the restuarant's web site to hit the bottle. You do not pass go, you don't collect $200, you will spare no one in your path until you reach it - the dinner menu. A heavenly glow shines down from your internet browser to light your way as you peruse the items of your potential feast. You methodically determine what appetizers your group will share and what meal you will coax each diner in your party to order, so you and you alone will eat the perfect dinner. Pre-crafting seems foolproof only until you reach said dining establishment to find their online menu hasn't been updated since the opening and there is a selection of new items for you to feast your eyes and belly upon. But don't fret! If said menu is Delfina's you're in for a treat, either way.\n\nHowever, I must say Delfina was not an easy craft. The menu seemed short and somewhat lacking. I couldnt determine an entree that I had my heart set on. I placed my order like i place my bets, eyes closed, the waitress/dealer staring impatiently, until one perfect culinary selection/monetary value comes to me DING DING DING.\n\nThe sausage appetizer was good not great. The mushroom salad was delightful. The home-made pasta (oxtail capeletti and duck taglietelle) was unbeatable and the sauces melted in your mouth. The sage butter sauce on the capeletti was the perfect lubricant for me to stuff those tasty flavor bombs down my throat. The bread gets points for the salt-topped-butter that reminded me of my Salt House experience.  \n\nInstead of silencing my sweet tooth with dessert, we went \nback and tried what we'd been eyeing nearby all along, the rosemary fries, and hail (rose)Mary they were perfect.

Everyone was dressed casually, the atmosphere was lively. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable and prompt. We ordered 4 apps, 2 pasta starters, and 4 meat entrees. The stretched mozzarella was so delicate and smooth. The pasta was al dente and perfectly balanced with mint and artichokes. Even the lamb spaghetti was rich but not overly so. I had the braised oxtail and everyone agreed it was the best entree - full of flavor, rich, and tender. We even had 4 desserts and loved the strawberries with basil. So good.

My husband and I reserved a table for two to celebrate our anniversary. We were seated at a very cold steel table under a window in a row of tables. My husband let me sit inside and he unfortunately was forced to sit under a wall phone. This, placed strategically at the rear of my husband's seat, it turns out was the hostess desk. We had to speak to each other between rings and through the voices of all of the staff who congregated there. At one point a hostess reached over and fumbled with some light switches directly behind my wine glass, moving it over to the side, too! We stayed because it took us an hour to park the car and I did not know the area well enough to venture out and find another restaurant. Our streetclothed waitress was knowledgeable but rushed and often flagged down. When my meal arrived it was pepperflaked all over and I am allergic. Needless to say it did not mention spicy on the menu. Of course in sending it back my husband's food got cold and I waited foreeeever for the replacement, with no apologies. My husbands ribollita was not. The chef needs to take a trip back to cooking school if he's going to attempt authentic Tuscan food, Which by the way we have. Just because their namesake in Italy serves ribollita this way doesn't change the fact the it is not true ribollita. Delfina in Italy modified the recipe for the locals who knew better. When I see a true deal on the menu that's what I expect or call it something else, DUH! The ribollita is a definite soup when all is said and done and my husband said it tasted like a browned salty vegetable cake. For the one star..The salmon was very good. So much for the food. I would not go back. I'd rather spend the same money at a REAL Italian restaurant and get table clothed privacy to boot!", "author": "rosanna m."}

It's actually rare to find a place in the city that has so little to offer a vegetarian/vegan, especially in the mission. For appetizer I ended up with a plain salad. As in the white/inside of lettuce, not leafs, and olive oil with lemon. It had a beautiful appearance, but not the salad taste I would have liked. Also on the menu as a vegan option were fries- thankfully they were delicious, or I would have gone hungry.\nThe polenta cannot be done vegan, nor can the risotto.. so I had the pasta. The pasta was freshly made, obvious at first bite and cooked perfectly al dente. \nYes, it was good.. and it's a cute little place, but pricey for what you got, how limited a veg. is on options, and how impossible it is to get reservations there!

I always have a glass of wine with my meal whenever I go and even though the wait can be rather extensive (bring a warm coat) it is really a fun place to go with a small group of friends (do not go if you have ALOT of people).  They also do take out so you can order to go which is nice to know!  The waitresses are really friendly and I like how you sign your own name up on a chalk (not dry erase) board in order to wait for a table.

My eyes are always bigger then my stomach and I gave them the authority to totally take over. We started off with the bread from Tartine that needs to be specially requested. I was close to passing on the bread in an attempt to save precious room for other dishes... this would have been a big mistake. It is crucial that you order the bread; if you have been to Tartine you should understand that this is no ordinary bread. To accompany this so called bread, we had the grilled calamari; hands down my favorite dish of the night and the best calamari I've ever had - big statement, I know, but I am 100% confident in this. I felt the same way about the spaghetti, it totally revolutionized the way I feel about this once boring dish. Whether it is simplicity at its best or if the tomato plum sauce has some sort of secret ingredient that makes it the king of all spaghettis (msg perhaps?)... the outside world may never know. In addition to the spaghetti and calamari, we ordered the sea bass, chard, and olive oil mashed potatoes. The sea bass was the only dish I was slightly disappointed with... I loved the sauce and the way they prepared it, however I got a bad piece of fish and a good section of it was gray and tasted off, very disappointing. Last but not least, we had the profiteroles with espresso gelato. So rich, both sweet and bitter, and so difficult to eat after having already stuffed my face the way I did but too good to leave a morsel behind. \nI had to shimmy my newly fat ass between the jam packed tables to get out the door and I plan to be shimmying it back in as soon as possible. \n\nP.s. All of this was for the bargain price of $100. Fine dining at a reasonable price; doesn't get better then that.", "author": "Taylor E."}

The duck had about three forkfuls of meat on it, and it was nearly impossible to get it off the bone. Some of the food was too salty.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-06-15", "description": "* I'm a wordy reviewer --- apologies in advance *\nLast night was Roomie's bday dinner at Delfina.\nI'll start with the positives:\nCherry.  Bellini.  Sweet Mother Mary those things are tasty.\nSauvignon Blanc --- two bottles was it?  Mmmm.\nThe food.  There were five of us which is wicked perfect for sharing tons of things on the menu.\nWe started with the very last order of the Fried Squash Blossoms, stuffed with ricotta and basil.  Cheesy, salty, sweet and deep fried.  How all vegetables should be served.  The batter was super light and really let the delicacy of the squash blossoms come through, while adding the perfect amount of crunch.\nWe shared several dishes after that:\nThe Linguine with Petrale Sole --- salty and tomatoey and soley.  It was tasty stuff.\nChicken & Pancetta Ravioli with black summer truffles --- DELISH.  The flavor was fantastic though I found the texture of the filling to be a bit gritty.  This dish was a hit overall.\nGrilled Hawaiian Ahi --- cooked to perfection, seared on the outside and raw in the middle.  The spring onions added a great compliment to the ahi with salsa verde.  The farro was a nice change of starch and was cooked perfectly --- just a touch al dente. \nRoasted Fulton Valley Chicken --- Wow.  The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the sauce was divine.  The chicken was moist and succulent and perfect.  The mashed Yukon golds were average, but when combined with the sauce on the chicken plate, I couldn't stop eating them.\nFinally we shared the Niman Ranch Flatiron Steak.  Again, perfectly cooked at medium rare, the sauce was perfect, and the fries --- while not as golden brown and crispy as I like, were awesomely seasoned with salt and rosemary.  This one was gone as soon as they set it down.  I was lucky to get any seeing as it was on the other end of the table.\nFor dessert we may have forced the Bittersweet Scharffen Berger Chocolate Cake down the birthday girl's throat, but don't feel too bad as I helped her by eating almost half of it myself.  Holy lord --- it came out HOT (and I mean like, I burned my mouth on it hot) surrounded by a little moat of crme Anglaise.  All that was missing was the lava center that I adore so much in those \"molten chocolate cake\" thingies.\nThe negatives:\nThe tables ARE very close together.  And the bar type seating in the center is sort of odd since it seemed like the people there were passing judgement on our cackles and shrieks, ready to pound their gavels at any second if someone said something off color.  They're practically on top of your head and they look directly down on to you.  Not so bad when the restaurant was busy and every seat was taken and it was loud.  Not so good when we were among the last people there, and the one lone guy was sitting right above my head laughing at our jokes that he couldn't help but hear.  Creepy.\nOur waitress.  Wow.  I wish I had better things to say, and alas, her tip did NOT reflect her suckitude in the least since so many of us are ex service industry folk who tend to overtip.  We were seated at 8.  She took our drink orders at 8:30 and dropped them off shortly thereafter.  We didn't see her again to order appetizers until 9.  Half an hour between visits?  She wasn't even anywhere to be seen on the floor for us to grab her for drink refills or to place orders.   She and the other server were GREAT about bringing us all small plates since they knew we were sharing all the entrees, but the attitude overall sucked.  The icing on the birthday girl's yummy chocolatey cake was when we jokingly asked if she was going to sing and her response was, \"This isn't Bennigan's.  This is Delfina.\"  Indeed.", "author": "Jennifer D."}

I was surprisingly unimpressed with the food quality, presentation, and creativity.  \r\nThey were out of 3 of the 4 things that I wanted to eat which was a bummer.  I ended up with their butternut squash soup, which was quite tasty, although heavy on the cream.  I also had their roasted chicken which was pretty blah...it didn't come with vegetables or anything, just a big dollop of whipped mashed potatoes on the side (which tasted fake...and believe me, I'm a freaking mashed potato connoisseur).\r\nThe Scharffenberger Chocolate Cake was rich & yummy though - as was the Wild Mint tea, which is one of the best mint tea's I've ever had.\r\nI went with 5 girlfriends and it was super crowded and noisy.  The space itself is really gorgeous and simple.  The chairs were uncomfortable though.\r\nI will likely give this place another shot, maybe with a smaller group and on a less crowded night.", "author": "Stephanie W."}

The first time I came here was about a year and a half ago, and only got one course.  I remember it was really great, but I'm glad I got the chance to come here for a second time and really see what all the fuss is about.\nFirst, our server was great.  She was attentive, but not annoying, and had the perfect answer for everthing.  There were four of us and we decided to get a bunch of dishes and share everything.  For salads we got the grilled calamari and some other salad with shaved parmesan on top.  It was a toss up on which was better that round.  For the first course we got three pasta dishes:  short-rib dumplings, mint tagliatelle, and another pasta with shrimp.  Again, all were fantastic, but I really enjoyed the unique taste of the mint one.  I would totally eat that for an entree any day.  Speaking of entrees, we ordered the sole, chicken, quail, and pork shoulder.  The sole was the weakling, still good, but it was in an \"aqua pazza\" broth and it was too much liquid for us.  I never thought the chicken would be my favorite, but it was the most delicious chicken I've ever tasted!!  Really moist, the juice was delicious, and the skin was hard to resist!  For dessert we got the chocolate profiteroles and we wanted the Scharffenberger chocolate cake but they were unfortunately all out.  Instead, they brought us (on the house, might I add!) this really amazing pumpkin squash tart with sage gelato, as well as a dish of vanilla gelato topped with...get this...olive oil and sea salt! Who knew it was a winning combination?!  All in all it was one of the best meals I've ever had in SF :)", "author": "Michelle L."}

So two weeks should be plenty of time for a week night and I can pick any time I want.\n\n5:30 or 9:30? Well there goes that plan!\n\nGot a 9:30 reservation which is a good time to chow down.\n\nParking is a bear down in this neck of the Mission or is it the Castro? Really nice area. Ended up taking public transpo. If you do drive park at a lot at Valencia and 18th, $8 and they close at 11 pm, which sucks but not to bad!\n\nPlace was packed and very happening. Promptly seated at a very cool table with a metal top and wooden backed benches. The wait staff was seemingly all beautiful women. More than often I was caught looking and not paying attention to the people I came with, thankfully that list did not include my SO.\n\nMenu is small and simple and is not what I would call Italian. Place sounds Italian and has a few dishes that are Italian, like pasta. Guess you would classify this joint as California New Modern Italian or some bs.\n\nBasic fact: Food here is very good, well cooked and presented in a great manner. Recommend a starter salad, small but filling and the flat iron steak with fries. A dish you would find more at a French Bistro.\n\nService was A+, water was always being filled and the wine recommendation was SPOT on for the dishes we had. Great bottle of red, forgot the name already!\n\nThe bread is what I would come back for! Hot and served right away. The lighter bread is made there and the darker crust is made down the street at Tartane (spelling?).\n\nWould recommend sitting inside, as the outside is more a covered patio and not all that great.\n\nNext time I will come and sample the pizza next door.", "author": "David B."}

Starters brussels sprouts with honey and hazelnuts were fabulous and the sunchokes, my new favorite tubers were still slightly raw in the middle.  Slanted Door just proved the only proper way to cook these special Jerusalem artichokes is to bake or broil them and they were peeled and shaped into  potatoe-like nuggets! (I was aghast) seriously.  Duck was too salty and pasta with nettles was more like a carbonara and I think missing alot of the described ingredients on the menu.  Dessert, the citrus panna cotta was unexpectedly good.

Let me tell you, it was well worth the wait!!! This was some of the best Italian in the city, and it wasn't extravagantly priced. All of their dishes were really creative and we loved the different spin they put on Italian food. For wine we started with an Italian pinot noir type grape that we thought was fabulous. I forget which ones we had but they were available by the glass and they were exactly what wine should be like, not overly fruity but very complex & tasty. For first courses we had a fresh porcini salad that was unbelievably fresh. The wood roasting taste was a little strong but so different for a salad I thought it was great. We also tried the gnocchi with ragu and both components were absolutely amazing. Gnocchi was so tender and cooked perfectly, and the ragu sauce had so much flavor. For entrees we tried the salmon, which probably was some of the best I've had. It was cooked in a grape leaf with corn on top and the moisture, flavor, and color were perfect. Very well done!! We also had the roast chicken with potato mash,  one of the best 19$ meals in SF!! So moist and it was bursting with flavor. We had a dessert, I actually forget which one and it was only average, but we had very high expectations by this point. The restaurant is fairly small so now I understand why it is so difficult to get a reservation, but it is definitely worth the effort. The service was great as well, we will surely be coming back to Delfina!!!!  Really the only negative is the parking situation, it's impossible so going to have to cab it.", "author": "Kate N."}

We have called multiple times over the past few years and have never been able to get in on a couple of weeks notice.  So with the economy being what it is, I thought I would give it a try for my husband's birthday.  We were so elated to score a 6:30 PM reservation on a Tuesday night!\n\nThere was nothing truly bad about our meal but I expected so much more.  I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.  We had a salt cod brandade app with fennel-sprinkled flatbread.  This was actually very tasty.  Though I wouldn't recommend it on a date as the flatbread is crispy, crunchy...messy.  Our two mains - a panzotti (ravioli) with a filling of greens and a light walnut cream sauce, and (skirt?) steak with fries ranged from okay to very good.  \n\nThe sauce with the steak was pretty salty and the meat had a strange gaminess to it.  The quality wasn't what I would expect from a restaurant of this reputation.  The panzotti was much better, but also a bit on the salty side.  We also had a side of polenta, which was super disappointing.  It actually had very little salt, was somewhat bland and had semi-coagulated Talegio cheese on top.  This was probably the most disappointing in both flavor and texture.  Oddly enough, the salt cod seemed to be the only dish that got the salt just right.\n\nThe service was fine, but unremarkable.  It didn't compare to the amazing service we had at Nopa a few weeks ago where every single person oozed attentiveness and warmth.\n\nThe people at the table next to us really seemed to enjoy their pastas...maybe that's what we need to try next time.  Although honestly, I am not sure we are that motivated to give it a second chance with all the other fantastic SF eateries.  Sigh....", "author": "Mona P."}

My daughter and I walked in on a Thurs. evening and had no trouble getting two seats at the counter.  That gave us a birds-eye view of the entire room.  Service was fine.  I started with the Delfina peach bellini, she had wine (can't recall which).  Then we shared the mozzarella, heirloom tomatoes, basil oil antipasto and the escarole salad with roasted grapes (a nice touch), gorgonzola and almonds.  All were delicious.  I had the paccheri (large pasta) with chunks of blue-nosed seabass while my daughter had the gnocchi al ragu.  Both were ample, fresh and tasty.  Dessert was lemon verbena buttermilk panna cotta with raspberries for me and chocolate torte with olive oil gelato and maldon sea salt.

Not the Delfina I remember from several years back.  The ribollita, shrimp porchetta, calamari with warm white beans, and salad were tasty but the entrees (Paccheri alla Amalfitana, Hanger Steak, Risotto, and Spagetti) were desperately uninspiring.  Felt like the chef has gotten tired and the dishes stale.  The hanger steak was ordered medium rare and arrived seared on the outside and cold inside.  We sent it back and it was only marginally better and slathered with additional sauce.  Of course, that diner had to watch and wait while the rest of us ate our meals.  The steak was stringy/chewy as well.  Finally, the waiter's obsequiousness was off the charts.  He wished me Happy Birthday so many times I felt like went from 60 to 70 in an hour!

Ok, after that useless introduction, our meal was awesome on Friday night. I called almost two weeks ahead and they only had a 5:30 or 9:30 reservation available, so we went at 9:30 for my husband's birthday. \nThey have a nice selection of Italian wines, I ordered the Franciacorta, which I don't see on wine lists too often. We started with the Anchovies, which were AWESOME, not the stereotypical, overly strong, fishy, salty taste AT ALL. Then we split the Oxtail Risotto, which was also quite good and I've had there before. I think that is where Five Star doubt started to creep in, the Risotto is very good but I can't help thinking it, at times, tastes similar to risotto you might make at home out of a box and the reason it tastes so good is all the preservatives and saturated fat that it contains. \nThen we had two main entrees. I had the Abalone and my husband had the Hanger Steak. The Abalone was really, really good, if not a tad overcooked. The Hanger Steak was awesome (we ordered it rare and it was cooked perfectly). I was so full by then that I didn't eat much of the entrees. \nI had to order dessert. We had the ScharfenBerger Chocolate Torta with Olive Oil Gelato. I ordered it mostly because of the Olive Oil gelato, which we had last time we were there (a year before, again on my husband's birthday) and I have been dreaming about ever since. But, maybe I built it up too much, because even though it was an AMAZING dessert, it was not as amazing as my memory of it. Sigh. \nOverall it was a wonderful birthday experience. I like the atmosphere, the music, the service was OUTSTANDING. So perhaps my first experience of Delfina (which I'm sure I would have given Five Stars) was too good and I was brought back down to reality for my second experience, resulting in only Four Stars.", "author": "Kathleen Y."}

Absolutely delicious pasta with buttery sauce gave way to sweet squash taste -- a perfect combination and sequence of flavors. Hands down one of the single best dishes I have ever tasted. Seriously.\n\nThe duck entree was also spectacular. The most tender and flavorful duck I've ever had.\n\nPortion sizes were also ample, which is more than you can say for a lot of pricy restaurants.\n\nYes, it cost $70 per person (all-in), but we shared a bottle of wine and those 4 courses and left completely full and satisfied. Perhaps it was stumbling upon such a meal that made it so special, or maybe the friendliness of the staff and comfort of the ambience, or maybe just the sheer taste and quality of the food -- but it was a perfect experience all around and worth every penny.\n\nWhether for just a meal with a good friend, a romantic evening, or a celebratory occasion, I HIGHLY recommend Delfina. But you're probably better off getting a reservation than doing what we did -- wouldn't try my luck and wander in on a Saturday night again!", "author": "Evan K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-07", "description": "It was a dark and stormy night.....  But, it really was!\n\n     After taking in the new Pissarro exhibit at the PoLO (Don't get me started on impressionism, but the organ concert was outstanding), my dining companions and I were doing the S.F. dining two-step.  First available reservations at our other choice were 8:30, and of course, Delfina's were long gone.   However, we figured we would head straight for Delfina and hope our dining Karma was as good as usual.  If nothing else, at least we could sit at the counter/bar.  \n\n     As is wont to happen, we were just finishing going over the day's menu with our server when a table opened up for us.  Moving down, we were delivered from the care of one very capable server to another.  It is worth noting, everyone we interacted with from the Hosts to the servers, to the chef was affable, professional, and extremely accommodating.\n\n     Our game of musical chairs completed, we commenced to the meal.  My dining companions are of the preference (and I know this is annoying to the kitchen at times) of ordering one course, then deciding on the second.  I should add, this isn't out of fickleness, but rather to avoid the disappointment of having a poor service cause one dish to pile up on top of another, leaving one feeling rushed and leaving food to sit either on the table or in the window.  Again, our courteous server was able to appease with the accommodation that she would be happy to pace our meal to assure a leisurely dining experience.  True to her word, we enjoyed impeccable food, presented in a perfectly choreographed sequence of dishes.\n\n     While our dining party does enjoy wine, there are often personal preferences which make ordering a bottle impractical.  Delfina has respectable, if not particularly encyclopedic by-the-glass offerings which change, at least between the visits we have made.  What I found particularly helpful was our server's unsolicited offer to \"taste us on a few things\" when we asked her for some insight to what they were pouring that evening.  We settled on a couple of Italian reds, which were both pleasing, although actually the \"lesser\" selection we found more to our liking.\n\n    One of my favorite experiences at Delfina is enjoying the explanations, freely given, of how something is prepared, where it is sourced, and what the ingredients are.  Delfina's food is excellent because it is top quality ingredients, expertly prepared: ingredients + technique.  Our server eloquently demonstrated this principle by ticking off the seven (yes, 7) ingredients in the spaghetti, while confiding that she had been unable to reproduce that bowl of pasta magic at home (I sympathize, but the quest continues).  On another visit, the chef took the time to explain, in detail, how he prepares kale dish, transforming that bitter green into something miraculous.\n\n    As they do every night, they began with the country bread from Tartine bakery just down the block, and a cuboid tub of butter (unsalted on request).  Personally, I prefer no start to a meal more than freshly made, good bread, torn by hand from the loaf, with sweet, lightly salted butter.  Truly, Delfina obliges.\n\n  First Course - The little gem lettuce salad was pleasant, but dressed with too much blue cheese for my taste.  The octopus was tender, sauteed simply in olive oil, and served over ceci (garbanzos) in a light tomato and seafood based sauce.  The slight chew of the octopus paired beautifully with the creamy tenderness of the ceci, contrasted with a well buttered grilled slice of bread.  Beans were adeptly incorporated in several dishes in our meal.  Our other mollusk of the evening, the calamari, was quickly grilled and lightly seasoned with oil, garlic, salt and pepper, yielding a pleasant, subtle charcoal flavor and a soft, fresh texture.  Served atop a warm white bean salad that was understated, but added a little sweetness and herbaceous to the dish.\n\n     Entrees - The spaghetti was simple, and elegant.  Seven ingredients (see above), which were greater than the sum of their parts.  Dried, Italian spaghetti was cooked al dente and served with a reduced sauce of tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, basil, and just a hint of red   pepper flakes.  It was unassuming, and delicious (although one of our diners felt the pasta was a little too al dente).  The Bollito Misto, consisting of a cheek, a tongue, and a sausage, while still enjoyable, was the least preferred.  The meats were cooked until tender, but not noticeably seasoned, leaving a flavor mostly reminiscent of boiled meat.  The highlight was the bass.  The fish was perfectly cooked: salty, crispy skinned, with flesh that flaked but remained moist.  The large filet was served on top of butter beans, pale savory, and creamy.  We also enjoyed the brussel sprouts, lightly charred from a hard sear, salty with the barest hint of anchovy.\n\n     We were too full to even consider dessert.  Ah, maybe next time.", "author": "Michael L."}

I came to Delfina a little past 6 p.m. and was seated at the bar (my choice as I was told they don't have tables for 1). Before I actually sat down, I visited their facilites, and when I returned to the bar my place setting was complete, with bread and a carafe of water. I thought that was very welcoming. Also, many times in restaurants when you're walking through the  servers plow through as if they are more important than the customer, which I get because their work is hard work. But, at Delfina they all prioritized my movements.A small thing, but noticeable. Jeanine was my server and she was terrific. From where I sat I could watch the salad makers and the cooks down the line with the care they take in their craft. I started with insalata di campo. As David D. said, a great salad. I normally don't care for frisee, removing it from the salad altogether. But I noticed that Delfina does something unique. Instead of lumping a frisee in the salad, it is torn into smaller bites---and I liked it! I ordered the spaghetti--very simple but flavorful. How do they do it? No meat, not much sauce but still so good. I had two wines--a chianti and a sangiovese--both very good. I was full, but knew that a place like this would turn out terrific desserts. Jeanine told me about their lemon crostada---I couldn't turn down lemon! The crust was light and sweet topped with luscious lemony curd. delightful with an espresso. I wanted to save half of the dessert for later and Jeanine graciously boxed it up. As wonderful as this place is on a first visit,I just can't imagine how it could be as magically perfect the next time.", "author": "M F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-07-15", "description": "This place is alright, but I didn't think it was anything astounding. To begin with, I was there with a friend who is a total foodie but really doesn't like seafood, and there was hardly anything on the menu that didn't include seafood. Overall, the menu was interesting, and that's basically how I would sum up my meal. The menu is separated into about 4 categories (apps, sides, entrees, and maybe one other) and I wanted to select an item from at least 2 of the categories, but not many of the dishes sounded like they would compliment each other. It was very odd.  As for what I did order, I admit I didn't order a huge variety, but of the things I did try I thought they were underwhelming. It was also quite loud inside, and our server was clearly unamused that we weren't there to spend a couple hundred on a full course meal, despite the fact that we were sitting at the counter. So anyway, I got the tomato soup for starters. It was fine, but tasted like a great fresh marinara sauce without any pasta--I was able to use the last piece of free bread to eat with about a third of it which greatly improved it, and I really think it's a soup in dire need of some kind of carb accompaniment. I also had the polenta, and I was sad about how boring it was. Polenta is usually a creamy, simple comfort-type food, and this polenta didn't fit that bill at all. It was bland, and tasted like they took plain polenta, melted an incompatible cheese on top, and charged me $8 for a serving of tasteless mush not much bigger than the palm of my hand. I appreciate simple, well-done, fresh food, but this was honestly pretty lame. The guy next to me got chicken and mashed potatoes that smelled amazing though, so I guess based on smell alone I'd get that if I ever went back.\n\nI've heard they have a pizza place (next door maybe?) that is better. Maybe I'll try that perhaps since this is so close to where I live, but honestly, I expected much better quality and value than what I got here. I think there are restaurants in SF serving all kinds of better Italian food (modern, traditional, etc.) at better values. Even in the much-maligned Little Italy there is a restaurant I love called Panta Rei that I'd rather spend my money at. Delfina just didn't make much sense to me and given the hype I really expected more.", "author": "Allison G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-13", "description": "The food: excellent! For starters we had the calamari dish and the mozzarella with what seemed like pickled vegetables and peppers dish.  For me the calamari was fishy, but for Zbikh it was delicious and he couldn't get enough of it, esp. the beans that came with it.  The mozzarella was milky and together with the thinly sliced pickled zucchinis gave a fusion of tempered flavor.  The main entres: I had the short rib- which by the description from our server was true to form- it fell right off the bone.  It had just the right amount of fat to make it juicy, the tomato based sauce was tangy and full of body, and the polenta that accompanied was warm, buttery, and not too cheesy- which made the whole dish pretty close to perfect.  Other dishes at our table was the flank skirt steak- which again to Zbikh who ordered it, it was done to the T- tender and tasty, I on the other hand thought it was a little rubbery.  My other friend ordered the chicken with Yukon potatoes and she was happy.  For desert: the profiteroles were a hit and the buttermilk panna cota was light and delicate.\r\n\r\nThe service: the host was genial and seated us fairly quickly.  Our server was delightful- she was accommodating without being pushy.  With a 10:00pm reservation, we were her last table and so she let us relax and moved with our pace.  She was well informed about the dishes and took our playfulness at asking her all kinds of questions from the pertinent to the silly with stride.  We liked her a lot.\r\n\r\nWhy didn't Delfina get 5 stars?  The decor and layout.  The decor had a trite industrial feel- they had buttoned padding like blankets that resembled blankets movers use to safe-guard furniture.  The seating was too close together, I don't like rubbing elbows with total strangers especially while I'm dining- heck that's why I don't use public transportation.  \r\n\r\nOverall experience:  As Delfina has been rated as one of the top eateries in SF- a pretty big statement as we have a gazillion restaurants- WE were satisfied with our meal.  We thought we received great service and yummy food for a decent price.", "author": "J S."}

I haven't been in a year and a half so it came as a big disappointment when I recently revisited the place with my partner to celebrate our anniversary. Things started out great, our table was waiting when we arrived. We were greeted warmly and generally throughout the night the service was good except that it took an inordinately long time to be offered the opportunity to have a glass of wine. For the first glass of wine we each had the Prosecco, I got a reasonable pour but my poor partner got only about 2/3rds of the amount of wine that I did. The same thing happened later when we each ordered a glass of red wine. I received about 6 ounces and he only got about 4 ounces even though his was almost twice as expensive as mine. Again, I felt bad for him. The food was not as good as it had been in the past. I had the grilled calamari and beans. I received two calamari while the table next to us (3 inches away) received the same dish with three calamari. The beans were kind of dry and not as plentiful or flavorful as they were in the past when I have ordered the same dish. And the calamari tentacles were burned which made them inedible. There is nothing worse than the taste of burned calamari. Our main dishes were good as was my partner's desert. But my desert, the chocolate torta, was a big disappointment. I used to love the warm chocolate cake they served with cream anglaise. The chocolate torta which seems to have taken its place was basically a round chocolate brownie. It was very dry and had a funny taste like it had been left uncovered in a refrigerator for a couple of days. The promised caramel sauce was just a smudge on the plate. I should have skipped desert and just has ice cream at Bi Rite. Overall, prices are up, they no longer give you those wonderful olives, they charge that annoying health fee on your bill and you have to ask for bread. Alas, Delfina no longer seems worth the cost.

I took my picky picky father, who ended up loving the place - this is saying a lot. He is a picky Spanish man who has had amazing food for like 60 + years. He had the ribs - which he was also not able to finish, which again, is out of character. I had a dish I didn't care for and they gladly and openly took it away and offered another dish free of charge. The soup was incredible, as was the salad. the spinach on the side was a little plate of orgasmic heaven. And the home-made bread? What? Home-made. Yes, it was incredible.

When i first started working in SF, back when i still lived in L.A., this was one of the very first restaurants that i ever went to.  this was maybe ten years ago and i was going to the HOT, NEW restaurants in SF even back then.  well, i did like the place but i didn't have facial hair, a leather jacket, nor a visible tattoo so i didn't think they would let me back into the Mission.  anyway, i liked it but hadn't been back since. 10 years later, supposedly it's still one of the 'hot/cool' spots so , okay, let's check it out.  we're stuck, we got a parking spot, we've already gotten used to the smell in the MIssion, why not?  \n\namazing.  the place is still buzzing and busy even on a MONDAY night. they were full ! ? what?  monday?  that's just stupid. anyway. they did have a table by the kitchen which was really not bad at all.  no one bumped us, we could get our waiter any time we wanted.  it was pretty cool.  the girlie, if she wears leather and stands in the rain is about 92 pounds and has the stomach the size of a peanut.  so i got tired of wishing we didn't order so much so i went with the option of 2 appetizers and sharing one entree.  this was a good idea.\n\nit just so happened that we picked 2 very light salads (the caprese and another green salad) and a light, Sand Dab, entree.  the sand dabs were awesome.  the girlie took them off the bone while i yapped about my super-exciting story of how i bought my house against all odds.  we shared a half bottle of champagne (it was a MONDAY, after all).  points to Delphina for having a half bottle of champagne but half point off for only have a $48 option.   \n\nthe salads and single entree were light enough to get the panna cotta dessert - very nice!  and a dessert wine - too sweet!  \n\nall in all, servcie was excellent - probably because of our table by the kitchen.  the food was very good. the champagne and dessert wine were solid.  the girlie was cute as ever so 4.4 stars rounding down to 4.  taking some points off for small selection and not a ton of options for light appetizers and entrees.", "author": "dan h."}

Their reputation as a solid Italian restaurant in the city is very justified. \n\nThe octopus salad was probably the stand out item there. I don't normally choose octopus out of the menu, but had read about this appetizer so decided to give it a try. It definitely was well worth. Very fresh, and very creative with a lemon-infused sauce.\n\nWe decided to sample the pasta, so we ordered gnocchi with a ragu sauce (the gnocchi was very soft, the sauce was flavorful, but it didn't taste as fresh as it could have); we also had ravioli with prosciutto, and that dish had a hand-made, very fresh feel. \n\nThe final dish was spaghetti which was perfectly al dente, but it reminded me of a similar textured spaghetti dish I had at A16 a month prior. The A16 version very creatively incorporated mint, and the surprising flavor won me over. The Delfina version, by comparison, seemed more common. That is actually how I would sum up my Delfina experience: solid, it delivers on expectations, but it is not as inventive as A16. It did not surprise me, and it didn't delight me. \n\nThe service was also slow, but the bread excellent.

When my boyfriend and I sat down, I will be honest, we were a bit disappointed by the decor- very 90s, cluttered with mediocre art on the walls, and mirrors all around (really only belong in a French bistro.)  We had a glass of Carmignano that was so good, we decided to buy the bottle- reasonable for the good quality at $50. However, the waitress did not let us know it would clash with our food- which it did. We ordered 3 courses and shared each. We started with a warm chicory salad with homemade croutons, whic was absolutely delicious, but it got our hopes up too high for the next 2 courses. The mint tagliatelle with chanterelles and nettles sounded incredible, but came out bland and clashed horribly with our wine. Next, we had a braised beef with polenta, pomegranate sauce and pine nuts. The flavors were good, not great and the meat was overcooked, making us feel cheated because it cost nearly $40! We ordered a side of turnips and greens. There were very few turnips and, again, very bland... For close to $200, I felt it was really NOT worth it. I can see how Delfina might have been an influential place, for its fine food in a casual atmosphere- emblematic of California cuisine- but the place is just dated now and the food mediocre. I gave it three stars because our waitress gave us fine service- she was subtle and intuitive- just perfect. If I do return, I will just order a bowl of pasta (the heartier pasta dishes looked good) and share a bottle of wine (the sommelier must be good, judging by our Carmignano.) However, I will stay away from the main courses (overpriced) and the sides (bland.)

Spaghetti was good, just know that it will be very spicy, but the main courses completely missed the mark.  The sea bass (which was a substitute on the date of this review for another fish that I cannot remember) was barely edible...and I never-ever say that.  It tasted like a frozen half-fried fish served with a spoonful of mayo.  The carrots were pickled way to much...tasting like I took a swig of vinegar.  The lamb (which I ordered) was extremely fatty and just not \"wowing\" coming from the reviews below.\n\nMy take...this is a restaurant for the marina crowd who wants to get some culture in the mission.  There are dozens of better restaurants.  Try Alamo Square grill...though it is french so dinner will take a good 2 hours, the food is much better and so are the prices.  Or, for the same price try Perbaca (sp?) that just opened in the financial district and finally Zyriab (sp) which is on divis and fell that wows me every time I go in.  Or, if you really need Italian, I wish I could remember the name but it is near Hyde and Pacific and the name changed a year ago...someone help me out if you can.\n\nOverall, just bland dining and not worth the hype.

Lots of little bones, and really oily, but up there with the best spanish mackerel in my book.\n\nFor our entrees, I had the special of the night, some kind of Greek fish cooked whole.  It was absolutely incredible.  They presented it, then took it back to the kitchen for a long deboning process.

But Delfina is the 2nd closest to getting there, at least because of their margherita and the Salsiccio pizza.  The white pizzas, I'd avoid.  Also, generally, I'd say there's way too much crust.   But, for the price tag, it would be a 4-star pizza.  I've gotten better pies in NYC for 2/3 of the price.", "author": "A J."}

This place has a casual, easy-going and comfortable atmosphere, service that is exceptionally timely and educated and a kitchen that works miracles.\n\nI took my parents here when they came into town for a visit.  We showed up 15 minutes early for our reservation and were shown right to our table.    My folks took a little convincing to order as much food as I wanted, but we ended up having 4 courses, sharing a bunch of things and two nice bottles of wine.  Everything was exceptional.  We had separate bills because I wanted to pay for the wine I picked out, and for the food total was so reasonable, I had to look at it twice to make sure it was correct.  For 3 people to have a 4-course top-notch meal the cost was under $130 dollars.  That might sound like a lot, but for the quality of overall experience, it felt like a bargain.\n\nHighly recommended!", "author": "henry c."}

The combination of flavors and the sauces are superb! But the venue isn't at all comfortable. You're seated at cold, hard, small aluminum tables with no tablecloth. Music plays loudly in the background and it's not 'easy listening.'\n\nThe wait staff are good, attentive, some are a bit casual for my taste. Our waitress described 1/2 dozen dishes on the menu as \"It's a lot of fun.\"  For example, nettles salad. Yep, the field weeds that scratch the skin off your legs was on the menu tonight and she described the dish as \"A lot of fun.\"  Rule of thumb: I don't buy weeds when I get a bouquet of flowers and I don't buy weeds when I sit down for a $100+ dinner.\n\nThe secondi pasta was excellent; unfortunately, only a small serving was on the plate. $17 is too much for \"a taste\" of pasta. It was delicious with interesting flavors and a perfect blend of chicken, bacon, lemon, cream, & chives.  To my surprise, it wasn't cooked al dente. No matter. It was very good, just too expensive for such a small portion.\n\nThe problem dish was the lamb. It was very flavorful and cooked rare. But the cut of meat sent from the kitchen was uneatable - a lot of fat and grizzle. First bite I couldn't chew it was so grizzly. It found its way to my napkin. The second bite, the same. Third bite, grizzle and fat ... no meat. I couldn't chew it. Again, into the napkin.\n\nI stopped cutting the lamb and sighed, looking at my plate trying to figure out what to do. Fava beans, eat them. They were perfectly cooked and plain excellent. Melt in your mouth delicious! I ate the beans and stared at the plate again. One of the staff must have seen me from the bar area, as he appeared out of nowhere. He asked how everything was (our waitress was somewhere). I  asked him to please get a fork and take a bite of the lamb. I had cut a lot of grizzle and left it on the side of the plate, which he could see.  I pointed to a piece of meat and asked him to please taste it.  He didn't, but assured me the kitchen would. He saw the plate had many cuttings on the side and believed me.  I advised that there was as much unchewed lamb fat and tendon in my napkin as on the plate.  He offered to have the kitchen prepare another plate, a different cut. I declined. The food on the plate should be eatable, and it wasn't. I'm done with the lamb. Thank you.\n\nI asked for the dessert menu. We ordered profiteroles and Delfina's flourless chocolate cake. Amazing. Delicious. Scrumptuous. Hazelnut ice cream, chocolate sauce to-die-for, sliced toasted almonds. And a quiet (subtle) fragrant warm flourless chocolate cake. They even placed a candle on the plate, having noticed the card on the table. Very thoughtful, and I was very, very grateful they didn't sing Happy Birthday.\n\nBy the time tax and medical insurance was added to the bill, dinner came to $124 before tip. No charge for the lamb. Given the reputation which Delfina and it's owners, Craig and Anne Stoll, have earned ... I expected more. I just wasn't a bit comfortable or relaxed at this restaurant. The hard surfaces, uncomfortable chairs, loud crummy music left me happy to pay the bill and go. \n\nI can now say that I've been there, but have no plans to go back.", "author": "Martin G."}

I hope Delfina lowers their prices to accommodate the fans that prefer to watch the game while at dinner at this place.

Never written one of these reviews before, but my waitress said, \"If you're so impressed, Yelp me.\" (What the hell did that mean?)  Well, that sounded like a challenge, and being in the stunt biz, I'm a man always up for one those especially when put forth by a purty lady. \n\nHere's how it went down... went with one of my surfing ladies who likes herself some red meat.  Since I'd never been I asked our server (who actually smiled when she said hello to us) what she recommended.  That's when she said, \"Well, what I would like to see you have is....\" Okay, I mean, who says that?!  What waitron ever walked you through your ideal dining evening?  After that, I was like a little purring kitty-cat in her hands. \n\nShe recommended the Niman Ranch carpaccio --- a fresh plate of pounded beef on radicchio sliced thin-style with some parmesan shavings on top and with salty capers just the right amount of S&P.  Also a gem salad with some crunchy cheesy crispy thing and this light anchovy dressing.  We were on our way!  Entrees -- the lady's steak with french fries that had some rosemary and sage.  Our server Alissa did the hard-sell on the braised short ribs, and in that tomato and balsamic sauce they were some tasty, manly goodness.  Dessert was a god-like panna cotta -- usually this guy doesn't like anything with the word \"gelatin\" in it, but this was some tarty, creamy good shizzle.  Did I mention the wine?  Don't know much about that Italian swill, but our gal asked us what 'made us happy' when drinking.  I loved this woman; she was all about MY NEEDS!  So after 3 options and much-o descriptive-o wine-o talk, she led us to a Sassetti(?) Brunello di Montalcino.  I gotta say, that was the pick of the century, the dried cherry and hint o'chocolate --- it went down real easy.\n\nAs for the all the buzz, I was like a bee who'd found its honeycomb!", "author": "Zephyr C."}

But it was just ok. Maybe it was what we ordered. Or maybe it's just me. \n\nWe had several apps and the mozzarella was good, but of the three we ordered, none were particularly memorable.\n\nFor my entree, I got the pasta tubes in red sauce with seabass (the italian name escapes me now) The server warned me ahead that the pasta would be very \"al dente\" and I was ok with that. She was right, it was quite firm, but that wasn't the part that was displeasing. It was just character-less as a dish. It had no joy, no love. Maybe it's rustic and true to life, who knows? But the fish was really just flakes of seabass (seemingly more for flavoring than anything else) and the sauce was very fish-stocky. My husband is a chef for another restaurant in the city and his response was \"I can't believe you're actually eating that.\"\n\nMy husband ordered the gnocchi with pork and his was quite good. So... that's a plus. If I went back, I'd probably get that. Or YOU out there... still to dine at Delfina... YOU get that.\n\nWe had gelato for dessert. It was gelato-y.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-09-05", "description": "Completely famished after a rather exhausting day hiking from Stinson Beach to Muir Woods, Sonia, Tom, and I strolled down the block to check out the famous Delfina. I was under the assumption that we would most likely end up next door at the equally esteemed pizzeria as reservations are standard at this upscale San Francisco eatery. However the restaurant gods were with us as miraculously on a Sunday night at 8 pm, sans reservations, we were instantly seated at the bar, pleasantly sipping fresh and fragrant white peach bellinis. A mouthwateringly tempting display of Tartine bread, figs, and and cheese added to the anticipation of the delicious meal to come. While the service was a bit on the slow side, our waiter was friendly and after placing our order we were rewarded with the crack laden famous Tartine bread, fresh and warm with extra creamy butter. Not wanting to fill up too much on the starchy goodness (although if you've read any of my other reviews you probably know that I am perfectly okay with eating bread, and bread only for dinner) we waited patiently for our food to arrive. I had ordered the roast chicken with olive oil mashed potatoes and morel mushrooms while Tom and Sonia went for the classic pasta dishes (capellini with tomato and basil for Sonia and linguine with trumpet mushrooms and a cream sauce for Tom). The roast chicken dish in my opinion, was the winner of the night. The crispy skin encased an extremely tender meat which was seasoned to perfection. The olive oil mashed potatoes were deliciously creamy and smooth while the mushrooms added an earthy and rich dimension to this already heavenly dish. Both pasta dishes were tasty, although I preferred the mushroom linguine over the tomato and basil concoction, soley because it was a novelty. After licking our plates clean, we still had room to share a dessert- the shortbread cookie sandwich filled with marscapone and caramelized nectarines- the perfect finish to a stellar dining experience.", "author": "Kate A."}

We had a salad and two pastas.  We had the Insalata di Campo.  It came with walnut, pancetta and a very nutty parmigiano.  The nuttiness of the cheese complimented the walnuts, while the crunch of the walnuts gave a similarly complimentary texture to the whole dish with crispy pancetta and cabbage.  Brought together with the bitter greens, it had a very complex layer of flavors.  We also had the Spaghettini Nero.  The squid ink gave it a very pretty look.  The lemon zest was what we tasted first when we put it in our mouth, then the very pleasant ocean-saltiness of the squid ink and uni.  There was also a slight hint of chili, so subtle that it was almost like an aftertaste.  The squid was crunchy and fresh-tasting.  It was our favorite that night.  Finally we had a mint tagliatelle with chanterelle mushroom and creme fraiche.  I was grateful that it wasn't too creamy, and the mint surprisingly went well with this dish.  This was the first of three dishes we had over the weekend that had chanterelle mushroom, but it was the one that we thought where it was the most well used.  It was a four-star dish, just paled a little compared to the spaghettini.  The wait staff was also very nice and attentive.  I just appreciate the thoughts that go into this dish as well as flavors that were new to me.", "author": "Eric W."}

Then we started with calamari appetizer and the gem salad. We were digging the gorgonzola dressing. Calamari dish is very good. I always order this starter. I should really branch out. Delfina is one of my Go-To places for birthdays and anniversaries. I love the buzz in the energy of this place and the service is also very professional without the pretense.

With 2 young kids and lack of time to prepare, we made a last minute decision to find a nice restaurant to celebrate my husband's 35th birthday.  We've lived in San Francisco for 10 years and have dined at some very fine establishments, but had not yet tried Delfina.  Last night we drove out to the Mission, I made a quick call to Defina, and the wait for dinner was long.  We decided to chance it and go in person.  Ally, who was our first point of contact at Delfina, was so nice and she found a way to seat us for our special occasion despite being booked up.  The service, the food, the ambiance - all was wonderful.  Exceptional food items included the grilled fresh calamari (to die for!!!), the warm Castelvetrano olives, and the linguine with petrale sole.

This restaurant is always packed every night and for a very good reason.   We eat there regularly (once a month) but thought our experience last night warranted this review.   Walking by at 8 PM and hungry, we decided to see if we could get a table.   While the massive crowds outside were waiting for Delfina PIzzaria, we had a glass of wine and only waited 15 minutes for a seat at the bar.   Dinner reminded us of why we live in the City.   The diversity of the customers, the radiating energy of the restaurant and the consistently delicious food and wine.    From the Tartine bread, to the perfectly balanced Little Gem salad, to the seasoned fries, to the fresh seasonal sweet corn soup, to the meaty short rib stuffed pasta, to the olive oil mashed potatoes, to the bitter chard, to the cheesy polenta.   Our only regret is that we missed the Duck Confit special.   But we watched as those around us savored every bite of their orders.   And the wine list contains such Italian finds as Germano Ettore and others from Piemonte.   At restaurants of this caliber the staff usually becomes haughty and detached yet everyone working at Delfina is always cheerful and attentive!   Service may get a little slow at peak dining times but be patient, the overall experience will leave you happy you live in a City like ours.   Exquisite food, uplifting dining experience and very reasonable prices are why this restaurant has been so successful.   Why don't other restaurants get it?

We may or may not get a salad but we always get the spaghetti and the fulton valley chicken. The chicken is tender, juicy, and perfectly seasoned. And I know what you're thinking...spaghetti? Really? This is no joke. Don't be fooled by the other pastas even though the papardelle is pretty good. Go straight for the full size order of spaghetti - no sharing! Trust me, I've attempted to share and once you get this plate of goodness in front of you, you don't want to spare one noodle! A portion of my eating pleasure goes to dissecting the spaghetti.

My only complaint was really that the hanger steak I ordered was simply undercooked and over-sauced.  I'm not a send-it-back-complainer, and I second-guessed myself because the reddish hue of the generous portion of sauce did a lot to mask the meat's color, so I just went ahead and grinned and bore it.

I had to settle for a 10PM reservation on a Friday night, since I only booked it a little more than a week in advance. I was told that you need to book 6-8 weeks in advance for a prime time reservation on the weekend. It wasn't nearly this bad last year at this time of year, though last year I got a Friday at 9PM only 10 days in advance. The maitre d' can be a bit curt on the phone when you're making your reservation, but ignore that and keep your eyes on the prize! The decor isn't all that, but who cares when the food is so good! And now you get to walk past all the losers eating at Pizzeria Delfina next door as you enter Delfina to claim your prized reservation. After circling 15 minutes to find parking, we arrived to happily find that they could seat us 30 minutes early. Led to our seats along the wall underneath the mirror running the length of the restaurant, towards the front windows, we settled into our seats and met our cute waiter. Tables are close and cramped, so be prepared to overhear your neighbors' conversations. A small dish of olives comes to the table, which I love, and then bread and butter. But the reason I come to Delfina in February is the crab dishes. Last year they participated in the Crab Fridays in the Mission program, but it's not running this year. But they had a crab dish available (since it's in season until the end of Feb), and what a spectacular dish it was. Spaghettini and fresh-picked Dungeness crab was absolutely yummy, for $16. My friend and I split it, and when they brought us our 2 plates, we thought they had made a mistake, the portions seemed too much. But upon checking, we learned that they had indeed split the dish. We mopped it up with bread. We could not have been happier. But we were about to become even more so! The menu offered local petrale sole in acqua pazza (capers, oven-dried tomato, olives, and white wine) for two for $39, $24 for one. So we had the two, which a different server deboned for us, and it was so amazingly good. We mopped it up with bread as well. For dessert, I ordered the warm persimmon budino (Italian for pudding) with caramel and mascarpone cream. It was yummy, like a bread pudding, and the persimmon and caramel flavors were exquisite, balanced by the coolness of the cream. A decent portion too, about the size of my palm. Chef Craig Stoll's Tuscan food continues to deserve your accolades, and the effort to get a booking is well-rewarded.", "author": "Hao L."}

My friend and I went here last night and I felt the need to point out some excellent items on the menu which if they have them when you go, you should definitely order them. To start, I have three words - black truffle arancini. This little risotto ball with cheese and black truffle was divine! We actually wanted to order more but they had run out and it was only 7:30 PM. I assume many people did what we did - tried them and then ordered more! A guy at the table next to us asked his parents what they liked the best out of the meal and his father said at least 3x the arancini - it was comical! We also had the little gem - delicious with the sieved egg and pt reyes blue cheese. For our mains, we ordered the pork saltimbocca and the papparadelle with duck sugo. Both very good - I am not a huge pork fan but I tried it and it was quite flavorful. I always order pasta here since it is always cooked perfectly and tonight was no different - perfectly al dente and the duck sugo was nice and rich. We also had a side of their brussel sprouts, which I know everyone has now, but theirs is unique in that they sweeten it up with honey and the hazelnuts give the dish a nice crunch. The other must order dish if on the menu other than the black truffle arancini is the meyer lemon panna cotta. I order a lot of panna cotta and theirs is quite special. Just the right amount of lemon taste and the creaminess of the panna cotta is incredible - my friend had to put a stop to me ordering another one! Our waitress (who I must say was fantastic) is a chocolate fan and she says she chooses this dessert even above the chocolate budino.

The service was efficient and pretty friendly.  The waitress didn't interrupt us much, which I always appreciate, and filled our water glasses often.  We all started with the cream corn soup, which I would highly recommend.  I had the tagliatelle with bolognese sauce, which was very good.  We didn't order an entree, because we didn't think we were that hungry.  The pasta portions are small; even the \"large\" spaghetti is pretty small.  Next time, I'd probably order more items--an appetizer, the cream corn soup, a pasta, and an entree.  They clearly expect us to order several courses because the portions are fairly small.  Overall, I'd definitely go again.  We did have a great time there, but in large part because of the company, rather than the food.", "author": "FY H."}

This is excellent food, folks, and if you're not \"getting it,\" try a little reflexivity and think about how your pallatte might not be up to Delfina's standards, not the other way around. If you think the spaghetti is bland then you're probably used to over-sauced crap from one of your Marina hang-outs. If you think the chicken is boring (which it's not...it's simple and delicious and artfullly prepared using the best birds and brines) then don't go to a Trattoria and order chicken! Order something a little outside of your pallatte and live a little. No they don't take AMEX (who the hell does?), no they don't bring you free dessert on your birthday (this isn't TGIFridays...hello!), and yes you have to help them pay the Healthy San Francisco Ordinance. Are you so stingy that you can't give a dollar twenty-five of your 50 dollar dinner so that your server can get minimal health care? Restaurant owners aren't rolling in dough...ever. ...And lastly, the ignorant comments about our neighborhood being \"crunchy\" are just disgusting, racist, classist, snobbery. Shame on you.  I am proud to live, like Delfina, in an a nieghborhood full of different kinds of folks with different socio-economic backgrounds (not all of which can afford to eat at delfina like you), and if it weren't for your snobby segregation over in your neigborhoods, maybe the maldistribution of wealth wouldn't be what it is.

The ravioli we shared were stuffed with chicken and pancetta, which was absolutely delicious.  Our main course was the salmon (on recommendation from a friend who had finished his meal as we arrived, thanks anth!)

In a nutshell, service is very good, attentive and low key; the food is mediocre. We ordered appetizer of grilled sardines, it took about 40 min to get it (at which point it no longer felt like an appetizer). The real test in my view came with a pasta dish, simple spaghetti with tomato sauce. I am sorry but no Italian would make pasta like that, salty, overcooked and overpowered - I couldn't possibly tell if the pasta was freshly made (as claimed on the menu) or bought from Safeway nearby. The main dish, pork shoulder was ok but not more than that. Having tasted these dishes, it was easy decision to skip the dessert (with Tartine few steps away that is no-brainer).

I got the spagettini with sepia (a type of cuttlefish, kinda like calamari), with sauce made from the sepia's ink, and given what it was, the chefs did an amazing job with it, but it was still a pretty, well, weird dish.  Guess I'm not the most adventurous eater, even when I try to order that way.  My boyfriend got the Niman Ranch steak, and it came so raw it was extremely difficult to chew (or look at).  I've heard this is the authentic Italian way of doing it, but before you order it, keep in mind how it will be cooked.  Salads, gelatos, and wines (recommended by our server) were great, but the main courses disappointed, especially after the great reviews I read.  Also, we were smushed right up next to another table for two--two rather loud women from NYC--which didn't heighten the romance of the evening.

We enjoyed the calamari as an appetizer - the beans were so soft and comforting while the calamari was well flavored.  Hint: eat with their yummy bread!  We also tried the chicken liver crostini which was great and I appreciated that they had some pickled onions and olives to curb that fatty taste -- if you wanted it curbed that is!  I loved my wild nettle ravioli: the bits of walnut with the soft ricotta was fabulous.  For dessert, we shared a panna cotta which was silky smooth and a great ending to a fine Italian meal.  So the food is excellent, but perhaps what we most liked is the fact that Delfina is casual and unpretentious.  Collared shirt and jeans are definitely fine and our waiter was helpful and cool.  The food isn't cheap, but not terribly expensive if you're ordering appetizers and pasta.  The only one negative for Delfina is that the place is small so it can get quite loud, so it's not exactly where you go for a nice romantic dinner.

We waited forever to be greeted by server and then to order.  After dessert we waited ages, and finally got his attention by waiving as he polished silverware and chatted with a co-worker.  I was really surprised -- Delfina servers are usually so great about the rhythms of a meal and checking-in just as you think you might need something.   We also got a bum steer on wine -- the description by our server didn't match what we got.  We asked for a dry white and got a perfume-y bouquet of flowers.

Very true to the authentic Italian roots, but garnished with a taste of California.  Everything is hearty yet refreshingly light.  No overpowering garlic or olive oil, like some touristy spot in North Beach.  You can feel the heart the chefs put into the dishes, and although executed in a subtle manner, there is also intricate sophistication as if every ingredient and cooking process was calculated with fine craftsmanship.  Service was nice (but not super- professional like you'd receive at giants like Chez Panisse), wine list is considerate of people drinking by- the-glass, dessert was superb, but the decor was more in the lines of Burlingame- not Mission-ish hip.", "author": "Passdatanqueray M."}

One upside of the down economy?  Call, and they have a reservation for you just about anytime you want.  \n\nBut first the pet peeve, which I'm going to put into every Yelp review of a SF restaurant that does this.  Delfina, like a number of other places, puts a service charge of $1.50 per person.  I am all for their employees receiving health care, and support the law that made it mandatory.  I do not support politcal statements on my bill, and I cannot understand why they don't just raise the price of an entry by a buck (or better yet, just accept it, after all, entrees are at the $25-$35 range there, and our meal for 2 was $200).  It is insulting to have  a $200 bill for a meal and to be told that it wasn't enough..that an extra $3 is required for health care.  The only reason I can see for the management to put this on the bill separately is to try to make the customer think the law should be changed.  Hey, it doesn't work...just makes me angry at the management.  I hope other Yelpers will join in on expressing our displeasure at this, and hopefully restaurants will notice and stop doing this.\n\nNow, about the food.  It was worth the wait.  We went for a celebration dinner (27th anniversary), and the food is very very good. We shared an appetizer of grilled fresh Monterey bay sardines...perfectly salty and seasoned, grilled just right...a bit fishy, but exactly the right kind of fishiness for this dish.  I followed with the chicken with trumpet mushrooms, with a side of mashed potatoes (which I'd guess were mashed with olive oil and were terrific), and my partner got the quail, with a polenta accompaniment that was perfectly matched, and also perfect prepared as well.  The food was abundant, there was no room for dessert.  \n\nI liked the decor generally, though I had thought it was more sedate and romantic that it was. It is noisy and crowded, and I wouldn't recommend it if your goal is to whisper sweet nothings to your dining partner, which after all these years I still like to do.\n\nDefinitely go for the food, if not the conversation.", "author": "b f."}

Our group of four started with the warm olives -- we liked them so much, we asked for more. My husband opted for the heirloom tomatoes with pane bucato -- it was divine. Just as good and fresh, I had the Insalata di campo. My entree -- the hanger steak and french fries was tasty, but not earth shattering. The desserts were mmmm, great -- the peach sbriciolato with housemade mascarpone and warm Scharffen Berger chocolate torta. Staff very friendly and unpretentious. Yes, it's loud and cramped -- but it's a SF neighborhood joint, it's part of the ambiance!", "author": "kelly m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-04", "description": "I have to take issue with the super lame commentary about \"well paid americans\"  working front of the house while the kitchen is 100% latino. As a former employee and current patron ( as often as I can get there), I know for a fact that that is a misrepresentation of Delfina. The implication in the last review is that the kitchen is composed of Latino immigrants without culinary skill. #1 A job in the kitchen at Delfina is a highly coveted job. Only extremely competent, educated, and experienced workers survive in that kitchen. #2 If there were  latinos perhaps one could see past their own ignorance and think that perhaps someone other than a white person could be competent and educated. You see a latino  person and immediately assume immigrant. Not just immigrant but victimized immigrant. How lame and self-righteous-San Francisco-transplant-ish of you. \nP.S. Delfina line cooks are some of the best taken care of in the biz. Benefits, a decent wage ( by line cooks standards) and the front of the house tips the kitchen out every night. \nDelfina Rocks. I've been to some of the best restaurants in the Bay and I still think its one of the best bangs for your buck out there.", "author": "s b."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-24", "description": "Just ok. Food was kinda bland, not bad but not great and somewhat salty as mentioned by another reviewer. Service was ok, for some reason the mashed potatoes were brought out separate from the chicken about 5 minutes later, the same thing happened to the group next to us as well. Why? Who knows... The setting is nice, but it is extremely loud and can be quite difficult to hear the person sitting across from you, due to the fact that you are sitting table to table (at least when you are against the wall like us). The main problem with this place, is it filled with yuppies who have come to the mission. You just know things are off when you eat in the mission and the place is almost comletely white.", "author": "k b."}

I have tried Delfina twice, with the second experience being even more insulting than the first.  The first experience was as a walk-in, counter-sitting, customer.  I attributed our lack of service to our placement in the restaurant.  The food was good enough, so I thought I would give it a second try sitting at a \"proper\" table.  I booked our reservations over three weeks in advance, so we wouldn't have to eat at 10pm.  We were seated quite promptly upon our arrival, but then waited 25 TIMED MINUTES before anyone approached us for ANYTHING.  No water, or any other beverages, for that matter, bread, or even a head nod as acknowledgement from our server.  As we sat there deciding if we were going to stay, we realized the  popular couple seated next to us were the owners of the place!  We have so many other options for excellent food in SF, why spend too much money on a place where the OWNERS don't even care about their customer service?", "author": "Stefanie C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-10-18", "description": "What happened Delphina?!  This was my second time to the restaurant; the first was magical and the roasted chicken delicious.  My husband and his out of town friend went again and had a fantastic meal.  However, the third time was the true test.  We went on an early Sunday night and were given a small table next to the bar.  No complaints there, but then the problems started.  The starter olives didn't arrive until the appetizers came.  When the main courses (roasted chicken and hawaiian ahi tuna) arrived, the sides to both the chicken and tuna were cold.  When my husband send the tuna back and asked if the sides could be made hot, it returned luke warm, but with less of the pan sauce.  (Needless to say, my meal got cold waiting for his to arrive the second time so we could eat together.) The manager/owner told him he could have more sauce, but what she brought was COLD sauce.  The chicken was a bit rubbery this time and the garlic mashed potatoes were also cold.  The manager never came back to ask if things were better.  When the waiter came to ask how we were enjoying our meal, we told him the problems, but he obviously didn't want to hear it and that was the last we saw of him until he practically threw the check at us.  In the meantime I could hear the head chef screaming for \"runners\" as the food wasn't being picked up.  At $85 for two with no wine or liquor, this restaurant could do much better on all counts.", "author": "Nicholette M."}
