The past few years, the buns were bigger than the meat and all the toppings, so there was always extra bad. The fries had a seasoning that was too strong and put me off ordering the fries.\n I went today and all the 49er memorabilia was gone off the walls?!? New owners or changing up the interior.. I ordered the Old Jefe and fries and it was good!! The bun is to the equivalent to the size of patty and the toppings. No extra bun hanging out and the bun didn't taste old and stale as I've had in the past. The fries weren't overseasoned as in the past, but just salt and pepper. I actually enjoyed my meal and will be coming back..\n Staff was nice and very polite. Got some onion rings on the side and it was crispy and not too much batter or soggy. Nom nom..", "author": "V.

I ordered the italian stallion and my boyfriend ordered the OG burger (double patty add cheese) . Love the simplicity of the OG- your classic cheeseburger and super flavorful with a hefty bun to hold all in the ingredients intact. Double patty was a little too much might even settle for the single patty next time. \n\nThe Itallian Stallion was delicious. Single patty with pepper jack cheese, marinara sauce, lettuce AND MOZZERELLA STICKS (add grilled onions and bacon). Also an extremely delicious burger. the bacon was thick and crisp and was in every bite, the mozzerella sticks were well seasoned and delicious and every thing just worked really well together. \n\nAlso ordered side of mozerella sticks which we already established were delicious, and french fries. \nThe fries are why this place isnt getting five stars. I dont know if I got an old batch or what happened but the fries were really dry and almost stale :/ Delivery also only took about 10 minutes once I got the notification that it was picked up from the restaurant so I dont know what happened but they arent worth ordering again imo.  \n\nOverall- really delicious burgers and will be adding to the list of delivery options", "author": "Kathryn S."}

Located on a mostly residential Balboa street with plenty of street parking.\n\nThis place is really small.  Behind the counter is the grill.  2 people working - the chef and an order taker.  Was looking around and couldn't find a menu so the nice order lady pointed it out.  I was surprised at how many items they for such a small place - not only burgers, but chicken, veggie burger, wings, chicken tenders, and a host of appetizers.\n\nI opted for the O.G. with cheese, Mom the El Jefe, bro the Chicken Tenders and Mozzrella Sticks.  All were combos with fries and fountain drinks.  The nice order lady helped me through the order.  Not more than 5 minutes later it was ready.  However, somewhere between the nice order lady and the chef they forgot our mozzarella sticks.  I asked for them and they were ready in 2 minutes.\n\nThe burgers were really good.  Fresh veggies, perfectly cooked.  Toasted bun.  Yum,yum, yum.  Mom loved the El Jefe and finished it off.  She hardly ever finishes a burger.  And bro had too much between his chicken tenders and mozzarella sticks so your truly poached some.  That chef is maestro with the fryer.  The tenders and stick where great.  Great flavor and perfectly cooked.  No limp tenders or sticks at Uncle Boys.\n\nGreat food, very reasonable prices, and nice friendly people.  Only issue is finding a place to sit and eat.  But we'll deal with that.  Uncle Boys, we'll be back.", "author": "Steve G."}

Hubby always wanted to try Uncle Boy's since we've passed by it numerous times and he's a burger fanatic.  The burgers are a drunkie's dream.  And my hubby got one of them.  It was called the Italian Stallion and had marinara sauce, pepperjack with jalape\u00f1o poppers and lettuce.  I got the Nephews burger which had a slice of jack, lettuce, tomatoes and pesto sauce.  There were two  employees there, one female and one male.  Thank goodness that the female was making our burgers, as the male didn't seem to regard taking off his gloves when he was doing certain things.  He may have been newer too as it looked like she was showing him what to do.  \n\nWe took our burgers to go and it took about 15 minutes for us to drive back home.  The pesto sauce was delicious (store bought though). The burgers were a good size and at an affordable price.  However, I wished both burgers were juicy.  His sounds like the ultimate drunk food, but the jalapeno poppers were soggy.  The burger wasn't bad, it was just odd and we wouldn't order them again.  Fries were well seasoned and some were crisp.  Overall, it's not a destination spot, but a solid place in the area when the burger craving hits.  Gotta give them props for some creative items!", "author": "Cat C."}

It was no doubt the best burger that I had, it exceeded the the standard of food that most San Franciscans see.

The other ingredients definitely tasted fresh too - you can see the produce on the side counters.\n\nThe Yelp check-in offer was pretty sweet.

The fries were m average. Not exceptional, but pretty hard to mess up. \n\nHowever, what killed it for me was a combination of the 20+ minute wait due to the large number of take-out and delivery orders ahead of us, and the bun.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-22", "description": "I struggle most with assigning a rating. This time, I want to say it's a 5/10. \nUncle Boy's serves up burgers and fried things in a simple, no-frills, neighborhood spot. It's clear they're big fans of Manny Pacquiao.\nThey cook up the food on the flat grill right by the doorway. There is a small fridge for beverages in the back. There are just a couple of small tables, so it's mostly a takeout spot. The seats are usually occupied, so I just order for takeout, or call for pickup. The food is tasty, greasy, and messy.\n\nI've tried the following...\n\nAPPETIZERS\n\n$4.55 Jalapeno Poppers - 5 fried jalapenos filled w/ cream cheese\n$4.55 Mozzarella Sticks - 7 fried breaded mozzarella cheese sticks - super cheesy\n$4.55 Zucchini Chips - 10 breaded slices of zucchini\n$4.55 Onion Rings - 5 battered onion rings, fried\n\nLots of fried items. They are mostly all crunchy & heavily breaded. The jalapenos are a little too spicy for me. The zucchini chips are hot and steamy inside. I couldn't even tell what they were until I bit through one.\n\n\nFINGER FOODS\n\n$6.59 Wings - 8 deep fried:\nnot bad chicken wings, a little petite\n\n\nBURGERS\nThe burgers are pretty juicy & tasty and usually quite messy. I've seen them weigh out slabs of ground beef, shape & flatten them into thin, uniform patties. The cheese is always nicely melted over the patty. The buns are toasted, too. I don't like the shredded lettuce, as it becomes soft and wilted. Takeout orders are especially messy and often dripping with sauce.\nPrices aren't too bad for a small business establishment.\n\n$7.49 Nephew - grilled angus beef patty, jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, topped w/ pesto mayo in toasted bun:\ngood, basic burger with juicy beef patty. I can't really taste the pesto mayo though.\n\n$7.49 Cowboy - grilled angus beef patty, American cheese, bacon, onion rings w/ BBQ ranch sauce in toasted bun:\ncrunchy, oily onion rings & juicy patty. I could definitely taste the BBQ sauce in this one.\n\n$7.49 Italian Stallion (formerly Mamma Mia) - pepper jack cheese, 3 mozzarella sticks, lettuce, marinara sauce in toasted bun:\nalso crunchy & oily, with gooey, stringy mozzarella\n\n$7.49 Hip-Poppin - grilled angus beef patty, jalapeno poppers stuffed w/ cream cheese, jack cheese, lettuce & tomato in toasted bun:\nalso good, a little too spicy for me, but manageable with all the cheesy ingredients\n\n$7.49 Hot Mess - grilled angus beef patty, bacon, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions, jalapenos topped w/ hot mess sauce in toasted bun:\ngood, way too spicy for me\n\nThey also serve chicken sandwiches, vegan burgers, and hot link sandwiches.\n\nNow I've been pretty satisfied with most of the things I tried. How could I not be? It's high-calorie fried food meant to satiate grumbling hunger pains. It was a good fallback option when you're too tired to cook and need something filling.\nHowever, I haven't returned in a while. I recall they had some serious management issues. There were many times I noticed Uncle Boy's only had one person working in the entire place; taking orders in person, taking orders on the phone, cooking, handling payment, and cleaning. Well actually, poor guy had no spare time for cleaning. No wonder it's hard to get through their phone line when placing a phone order. Need I mention sanitary issues having only one cook deal with cash payments too? \nAfter a couple of times of dealing with extremely slow service, I can't even call it fast food anymore. Nobody should have to wait 45 minutes for a burger to go. When other patrons asked why he was on his own, he replied that the owner was too cheap to pay more staff members. I was surprised that he was so blunt, but I would be disgruntled too. I don't know if they still deal with bottleneck problems during peak times (especially right around closing time), but it's worth mentioning for people who are strictly looking for a time-saving option.", "author": "Joy W."}

I ordered the Cowboy Burger as a combo, which includes a drink and mozzarella sticks. The last item being a choice. You can chose between mozzarella sticks, french fries, jalape\u00f1o poppers, zucchini chips or onion rings. I also ordered a side of onion rings and the BBQ wings (8 piece). There are other flavors beside BBQ, but I just wanted that one.\n\nI went to pick up my food then head on home to eat. The mozzarella sticks were okay, crisp on the outside. The onion rings were delicious.\n\nThe wings tastes good by itself. The wings were crisp and crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. The BBQ sauce comes in a separate container that you can pour over the wings. \n\nThe burger...yum. I ordered with the beef cooked medium rare and it was perfect. The beef was so tender and the sauce! The onion rings was a great combo and the bacon, oh my. The bacon was two thick slices sandwiched in between the beef patty and the bun. It was soooo delicious.\n\nNext time I'm feeling hungry, I'm going to get me that burger again. Maybe it was just my hunger talking but I'm pretty sure it was all my taste buds.

Kind of sad because you got another parking ticket and Dad asked you how your job search was going?  Not so good eh?  Well, go to Uncle Boy's and order up a Dog in Heat!  That dog will fill your mouth with such goodness that the bounce with return to your step and a satisfied smile will return to your face.  Uncle Boy's is comfort food on steroids.\n\nI had the Dog in Heat.  A delicious Louisiana Link sliced down the middle and fried on a flat grill surrounded by chipotle sauce, lettuce and onion on a nice bun.  Nothing mysterious or hidden about this food - as real as you can get; juices dripping down your hand in spite of the nice paper wrapper that comes with the dog  - and you don't care because it's all emotion once the eating starts.  Juices dripping from your jowls, down your chin as that Dog in Heat disappears and all of the flavors of bun, dog, sauce and vegetables have a little taste sensation party inside of your mouth.  You want to scream, but your mouth is full of this amazing food!\n\nSofie had the Nephew Burger and when I asked her how it was, she said \"It's good!\" - but with a muffled mouthful of burger and not even bothering to look at me!  She was in attack mode on that burger, head down and focused.  She wasn't about to waste time talking about it.  Neither of us talked until our sandwiches were entirely gone.\n\nThe fries were \"so so\" - nothing special.  Others had onion rings and I coveted them mightily! Next time - I'm having the onion rings.\n\nYou know this place is good because it would not stay in business what for the locals who are addicted to the food.  There is hardly anywhere to sit in this tiny restaurant.  Looking into the eyes of the patrons I see a longing and a hunger that is a little on the scary side.

We mentioned our plans and he was kind enough to warn us that UB's was under new ownership, and that it would essentially be a crap-shoot regarding our experience.\n\nWe were pretty set on eating burgers/fries/whatnot, so we thought we would take our chances. Hindsight is a bitch, ain't it?\n\nAs we stepped inside, we noticed it was pretty packed for being 45 minutes from closing. There was only one dude manning the place and he was backed up with about 3-4 orders. A few hungry patrons were waiting and they didn't look too happy.\n\nIt took about 15 minutes for us to be acknowledged, which eventually led to us placing our orders. I wanted a chicken sandwich, but they were out of chicken. So, instead of doubling up on beef burgers, we just got one and split it.\n\nOn top of them being out of chicken, they were also out of carbonation in their soda fountain, out of napkins, and out of ketchup. Surprisingly, I was not out of patience just yet. \n\nBy the time we got our food, we were the only people left. The hot mess was actually a really good burger, but $11 for a burger combo is crazy considering the blase bun and Sysco bagged french fries. The lack of service also kinda ruined the experience. \n\nSome chap came in after closing and wanted a burger. His tardiness was rewarded with a free order of fries. Meanwhile, we didn't get chicken, soda, napkins, ketchup, and had to wait 25 minutes for an order. Where the heck is our reward? Makes perfect sense in the world of Uncle Boy's, I guess. \n\nI'd rather go to Super Duper and pay roughly the same amount, get napkins, ketchup, soda, great service, AND FREE PICKLES. \n\n\nTo the Owner: You seriously need to have more than one person in this operation. You can't have the cook handle money and go back to cooking. That's not sanitary. You can't expect him/her to replenish everything while preparing food.

When the small, sad over-cooked and cold burger that had a half piece of bacon arrived at my doorstep I was truly at a loss. They must have gotten it wrong. Did I mistakenly order from the wrong place? Where was my mouth-watering burger that all the reviews spoke of? It was absolutely devastating. I was stuck eating a cold, soggy, dry burger that I had to drown in ketchup and ranch to mask the disaster of a burger that Uncle Boy's tried to pass off as a succulent Angus Beef burger.

Their 6oz burgers would provide just the right amount of meat I expected.

However, I basically devoured this burger in 4 bites. (Super graceful image, I know.)\n\nI got the Ain't No Punk which comes with a flame broiled garden patty, cheese, fried zucchini, chipotle sauce and the other usual produce suspects. I also added grilled onions because why wouldn't you add grilled onions. \n\nFor the most part, gotta say this thing, along with the onion rings, held up on its delivery trek. Although, towards the end of me trying to take this burger down, the chipotle sauce stared eating through the bread. Oh and the fried zucchini chips, while amazing in theory, also lost their race against soggy time. \n\nFor anyone complaining about the small portions of onion rings - HOW MUCH FOOD DO YOU NEED?

The burgers were tasty and what I would expect to pay for a burger of that caliber. Recently they decreased the amount of meat from 5oz to 4oz and the prices have stayed the same. We get it...SF is expensive. What I don't understand is why this now tiny piece of beef sits on bread that is about 4 times thicker than the meat. I was appalled when this first happened but chopped it up to a fluke as I was informed by employees that buns are sourced from different locations. This is however the 2nd time this has happened since this downsize in meat. Is the increase in bread supposed to distract us from the fact that there is clearly less meat in this burger?! Quite simply put, the most unsatisfying burger I have ever had. Unless you're on a bread diet, please don't bother going to Uncle Boy's....I know I won't.", "author": "Rachel E."}

(That is translated to ten o'clock at night until six the following morning).  There so happens to be ordinance here in City & County of San Francisco #49 'Noise Abatement Ordinance'.  In fact which makes it ILLEGAL to disturb with noise caused vocally, electronically, mechanically, or in any other manner that would cause disturbance to other people between these hour. (I wish this was made more known to general public).\n\nNow my problem with place is that they really need to know how to read clock and to update their website to correct and current business hour.  On site it states that Friday and Saturday they are open 'til 0300.  In actuality they have only recently changed their hour until 2200 (ten at night) -- uh... daily!\n\nFurther I have been busy with homework as there are midterm at CCSF following week from when this was written. I wanted dinner. So normally they do take order over phone.  I rang up at 2145 and NO ANSWER!   This is BAD business practise as to not operate until POSTED closing times!  So in my situation as they are now among all other place open until this 'witching hour' no other restaurant are open after 2200 in WHOLE Inner Richmond area near Balboa St.  So I had to go without dinner that night!\n\nSan Francisco being major city has been closing up and rolling their pavement up at very early hour (so much early as 1800)!  This 'truck stop' town mentality!  This is major international urban centre!  Ridiculous!\n\nUncle Boys, if they are to remain in business and gain more customer (other than just many sports nut!) they MUST comply with city code and operate until posted closing time, not fifteen minute early!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-20", "description": "I've been on a diet for the better part of 3/4ths of my life. I usually start off well, but then something happens: I wake up with a hangover. The day dawns painfully bright, my stomach is in turmoil, and my mouth seems filled with the unmistakable flavour of partially chewed cigarettes. When I can peel myself from bed (usually at around noon), I hunger for grease, and often find myself lurching, with zombie-like gait towards any restaurant that will help cure my ailment. \n\nToday, Uncle Boy's was my choice. I ordered the Hot Mess meal, and for about 10 dollars, I received all the Cola I could stomach, about a pound of french fries and a giant sized burger, with bacon, cheese, hot sauce and Jalapenos. The burger itself was cooked well-done, and fresh off the grill. While the Jalapenos added some nice spice, the star of this show was the meat: not only was my burger unobtrusively seasoned, but clearly a high grade of beef, the bacon (two thick slices) was large enough to attempt to escape the confines of the burger, despite arriving folded over. The vegetation on the burger was fresh, and played its supporting role with grace and aplomb.\n\nFrench fries were simply seasoned, slightly spicy, substantially sized, and freshly fried. While they could have used a bit more time in the fryer, I couldn't find anything else about them I disliked. As mentioned earlier, they were provided en masse, which is certainly not anything to complain about, especially considering that they are probably the only vegetables I'll be eating today (if my mother reads this, I'm just joking, Mom!).\n\nThe space is...intimately sized, has a classic tile floor and sports memorabilia plastered to the walls. Service was quick enough, my food came within 7-8 minutes after I ordered, pretty impressive considering that it was a one-man operation.\n\nI walked out with my hangover all but cured, and for that alone, Uncle Boy's is worth the four stars I'm giving.", "author": "Casey U."}

If you're drunk and looking for a greasy burger laid out comfortably on a bed of french fries, this is the place for you. These burgers are big, juicy, and both of our burgers had thick slices of bacon that added an excellent salty crunch. Not a bad burger if you have a big appetite.\n\nSo why two stars?\n\nFor one, our two meals came out to twenty two bucks. That's kind of a lot for lunch, especially when you consider alternatives like Super Duper, In-N-Out, Umami Burger, Tee Off Bar, HRD Coffee Shop, and Five Guys Burger... really, the list goes on and on. If a burger's gonna cost that much money, it better earn every penny. And not just the burgers, but how the place is kept -- all the tables were freckled with crumbs. It was just kind of gross.\n\nFor two, as we were eating, the guy behind the counter goes outside for a smoke.

The problem is.............it might be too simple, as a matter of fact, a little boring. We ordered 4 burgers, one a double, 2 orders of chicken lumpia, and zucchini fries. \n\nThe bun on this burger was very thick and dense. Although the bun is made from a local bakery and is made fresh everyday, it was just way too much bread. The patty was thick which I loved. There aren't too many patties like this out there. It was charred/grilled perfectly. You know the person making this had some experience behind the grill. \n\nThough they forgot my order, it was a blessing in disguise. Why? Because they had to rush my order and the burger came out med to med/rare, which I loved. It was juicy, charred perfectly where once you bite into the burger the juice comes oozing out. They prepare their burgers one way, which is close to well done. Having burgers made to order would make a ton of difference. \n\nLumpias are good. Nothing to write home about. \n\nSuggestions: \n\nThe helper should either use gloves or a tong to get the lumpias and fried zucchinis out of the fryer to the basket. It was very unappealing when he was using his hands after we saw him smoke outside. \n\nUse different buns, have lighter buns or an option to have different buns. \n\nMenu is too boring. Spice it up!!!! Do a different size burger. Since you already have a baker helping you guys out. Do an oversize burger with an oversize bun. That would be fun!!! An oversize lumpia?!? Just some ideas. \n\nPrice point is good. 5 dollars for a burger is a great deal. Great for the UCSF students. I think it would do well here if they just tweaked it just a bit. They are already open up late which is great...........til 2 am. \n\nTotal cost 46 dollars.", "author": "jason g."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2010-03-29", "description": "I thought almost everything is suppose to taste good when drunk...WRONG!\n\nI love supporting local businesses and mom and pop type establishments, but MAJOR improvements need to be made to the taste and quality of Uncle Boy's food (or perhaps it was an off night?). All the YELP reviews rave about UB's tasty food and great customer service; NONE of which we experience when we came here on Saturday, 3.26. So, I'm going to go against all the 4 and 5 star reviews and give it the rating it deserves...1 STAR!\n\nI first heard about UB back in January 2010 when I was at Kent Cleaners around the corner. One the customers were telling us how they opened a Fast Food joint opened till 3 AM. 3 AM?!? Perfect especially after a night of partying, so I put UB on my list. \n\nMy friends and I came here this past Sat at around 2 AM. \n\nFOOD:\n*Lumpia ($3.95 for 5): AWFUL! The lumpia came fresh out of the freezer from a large plastic bag. Although the wrapper was nice and crisp, the filling was very dry and tasteless. If you're expecting authentic lumpia made with pork, do NOT order the lumpia at UB. Who makes lumpia with white chicken meat, lima beans, and corn? Perhaps, they are trying to make a \"healthy\" version of lumpia? But, we all know everything is fried is unhealthy, so if I'm going to eat it something bad for me, bring on the pork fat please!\n\n*Chicken Nuggets ($4.85 for 7): Over fried, dry, AND rock hard! One bite was all I needed to throw the chicken nuggets back into the basket. Some parts were burnt, so it left a nasty after taste in my mouth.\n\n*Chicken Wings ($7.95 for 8): The wings were heavily battered and was over fried producing an extra hard oily crust. The crust was inedible, so I had to peel off it off and just ate the meat with which was relatively moist which was the only positive thing about it.\n\n*Burger w/ American Cheese ($4.95 + .85 for cheese): One of the WORST burgers ever. All of our burgers were burnt, overcooked, dry, and flavorless. The patty was charred to the point some parts of it was black which left a disgusting charcoal/lighter fluid after taste in my mouth. \n\n*Fries ($2.85): When cooking hand-cut fries, you have to soak the fries in cold water to draw out all the starch and sugar, so that it fries to a crisp. I highly doubt UB did this because the hand-cut fries arrived room temp, undercooked, dry, and were NOT crispy. It was also unseasoned, so it literally tasted like eating cardboard. \n\nIn summary, everything was overcooked and/or burnt, dry, and unseasoned which left an unsettling aftertaste in my mouth which had to be washed down with tons of Sprite. \n\nSERVICE:\nSome of the Yelpers mentioned friendly service that goes above and beyond. Umm, I didn't see any of that. We ordered our food at the counter and paid. Then, the cook would just call out our order(s) when it was ready and handed it over the counter. We were suppose to have an option for sauces for our lumpia, nuggets, and wings, but was never asked as to which ones we wanted. We were given the sweet and sour for the lumpia, bbq for the nuggets, and ranch for the wings. I know we were probably suppose to request it upon ordering, but we all know when you're buzzed/drunk, our judgment is impaired, so if they truly had such \"great\" customer service they should have asked. \n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nUB is small and simple. You walk in and the kitchen is to your left, 2 tables to your left, 2 tables in the back, and 3-4 stools near the front window. The back tables had a laptop and bags on it the night we went, so there were only really 2 tables avail that night with 2 chairs each.  \n\nPARKING:\nDifficult because UB is located in an residential area of the Inner Richmond. There isn't much metered parking avail like Geary and Clement which is normally plentiful in the wee hours of the morning. \n\nSorry UB, I really WANTED to like you but when I'm hungry and  can't even manage to take more than a few bites of any of your food that's a big problem.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

You can thank San Francisco for being good and reliable for having good eats open late on the weekend. 3AM!!!\n\nAnyhow, uncle boy's is a tiny burger joint that offers a great variety of different burgers and finger foods. (They even have lumpia??) Many specialty burgers with specialty sauces, along with my favorite fried finger foods such as zucchini fries, mozzarella sticks, fries, chicken wings etc. Prices are decent, it's not expensive and for less than $10 you can get yourself a pretty good meal.\n\nThe last time I was here, the bestie and I shared an unhorsed cowboy burger which had all the fix-ins (lettuce, tomato, onions) and on top of that 2 strips of bacon and onion rings with their cowboy sauce, which I assume to be some sort of southwestern chipotle of some sort. We subbed the meal deal with zucchini fries AND got mozzarella sticks, whew. Their burger patty kind of reminds me of the whopper from BK or Carls Jr., and IDK if that's a good thing, but I know some people dig that. They make their patties fresh from what I saw the last time we were there. They took the ground beef and formed patties right before our eyes! But they cook them nice and well done so there's a bit of a charred/crisp. I suppose you can ask them not to cook it as long if you don't like that? I prefer mine well done though, so it doesn't matter much to me.\n\nTons of food and a drink for about $15.

Of all the places that Yelp has recommended to me, I can only say Phils BBQ in San Diego and Uncle Boy's truly deserve the 5 star rating.\n\nA tiny hole in the wall type of restaurant in the middle of apartment buildings in the inner Richmond, Uncle Boy's is very unassuming.  A hint of Filipino inspiration, from the name to the Pacquiao pic inside show what the owners were thinking.  There are literally only 3 tables, each a 2 person table inside with a bar counter.  The couple times i've been there, there's only 1 guy working.  He takes your order and cooks it to order right there in front of you.  Cups for drinks are all laid out on the counter for you to help yourself because the employee can literally see if you take a cup and hadn't paid for it.  It's the the type of tiny restaurant that makes you a believer in small business and how someone can get it so right.\n\nFood wise, I've tried many burgers in San Francisco, most recommended to me by Yelp and this burger is by far the best.  In the Inner Richmond, others might say Bills Place or Buffalo Burger but Uncle boys far outpaces them.  I've had the Pool Boy and Unhorsed Cowboy, both amazing burgers.  Perfectly juicy patty, toasted bun, condiments and sides at the right proportion to meat and bread.  The burger is something that comes together perfectly and one you just can't stop eating.

The motto is \"small menu, big taste\" which is pretty much true. The menu is straight forward like Ike's Place but less extravagant. The burgers are similar but with a difference of one or two items/sauce(s).\n\nThe burger meal includes a 21 oz soda and straight-cut fries for $8.95. The burger itself is $6.95. Since the Scoutmob deal has a maximum $10 discount, I opted to get a hotlink sandwich as well. Price for sandwiches are flat $6.95 for all varieties and $8.95 for meal. I got the \"unhorsed cowboy\" burger meal and the \"bacon link\" hotlink sandwich. To make the most out of the discount, add jalapenos and other extras! I wish I did since jalapenos are only $.50 more.\n\nThere are only 2 tables to sit down so count on taking orders to-go or if you are comfortable standing then there is area for that. It didn't take long for the food to cook. I ate the burger first and it was quite tasty. I really like sticking fries into my burger rather than eating all of them supplementary so you might want to try that. I really like the crunch to almost every bite, yummy. Add pepper for more taste too.\n\nThe hotlink sandwich was also yummy but I preferred the burger. I have been craving a hotlink for weeks and I finally got a good fix here. Even with my huge appetite and high metabolism, I wasn't able to finish the last 1/4 of the sandwich but I did in the car after I left.\n\nOne complaint is that there is no compost bin.

The person working here might even be a coming of age youth.  He looked awfully young.  \n\nThe burger combos read like a pregnant woman's list of things to consume during a serious craving.  Fried mozzarella, bacon, BBQ sauce and onion rings in a burger, at the same time?  Sure.  The burger patty is not the centerpiece of the burger, so it lacks flavor and originality.  But stack on some serious toppings, and it is perfect.\n\nMy BF and I each had a burger.  Well, we each ordered a burger.  But the burger turned out to be so CATASTROPHICALLY big that I couldn't finish mine.  I had about half.  (Bar results in 3 days!  Massive Brain Failure!)

I kept checking the menu to decide which burger I'd try this time. The Hot Mess was my choice and boy was I glad I choose it.\n\nThe Hot Mess is a spicy burger, with cheese, bacon, jalapenos and hot mess sauce. It is so spicy, but so good!! \n\nWhat sets Uncle Boy's burgers apart is how tender they are. The meat is cooked perfectly and falls apart in your mouth. It's not dense or heavy and there is a very satisfying meat to cheese to bun ratio. Their french fries are also really good and stay crispy for a long time. I really need to try the rest of their menu, I seriously doubt I'd be disappointed.\n\nThe atmosphere of Uncle Boy's is great; the guys behind the counter are really nice and when I came in they had the Giants game on. It didn't care at all that I had to wait a few minutes for my to-go order, I got to watch the Giants! \n\nOverall, they serve pretty awesome burgers. I'm done bothering with the other Richmond burger joints, Burgermeister, and Bistro Burger--they can't touch Uncle Boy's!", "author": "Sarah M."}

It is a narrow place, with small tables that fit 2-3 people at most.  Not idea for big groups.  We hoped up to the window-bar.\n\nAt first I thought their prices looked expensive- a burger for $8.95 at a hole in the wall?  But then you realize that the combo comes with both fries and a drink.  On the counter, I could see the handmade patties, a testament to the freshness.  Our server/griller was friendly enough.\n\nI got a Hot Mess, which had hot sauce and jalape\u00f1os and slabs of bacon.  For the name, I was expecting an explosion of messy sauce that would make me regret not owning a bib.  (lets be honest- owning a bib makes you regret owning a bib...)  It didn't live up to it's name, as it came neatly wrapped and not that saucy- but was still big on flavor, and huge on size. Also- the burger was beefy bliss!   The meat was flavorful, and the crispy bacon (SLABS i tell you) can never really go wrong.  I could do with a bit more zing, but the burger was still top notch.\n\nThe fries were golden and crispy, the inside tender but not mushy.\n\nFor a complete meal under 10 bucks (combo w/ tax came out to $9.80), it hit all my requirements.\n\nAs we left, the server said, \"thanks a lot for dropping by!\"\n\nTo which I responded, \"Oh don't worry- I'll be back.\"", "author": "Richard Y."}

The thing must weigh about a pound and I couldn't even wrap my mouth around it. I had to whip out the knife and fork just to get through the burger. The burger is flame broiled, and you can taste that in the burger when you bite into it.

I can only speak for the cheeseburger ... and the bread was a bit of a standout (its baked fresh by a local city bakery, which is a sure way to get points with me), nicely toasted but pretty overwhelming given its proportion to the actual burger and all the fixings. The meat itself could have been juicer, but if your looking for that outdoor barbeque flavor its there! \n\nOverall this place has okay food and quality service.

The staff is personable and makes me feel at home. They recognize their loyal customers well and treat everybody like family.\n\nForgive me for being redundant in the previous paragraph; that's just the impression I got when I visited earlier this week. I went for just some lumpia since I wasn't too hungry. The lumpia was basic, but the great service magnified the delicious flavors in the rolls.\n\nThere's room to sit either at tables or along the window; might be nice to stare out onto Balboa after a long day's worth of work.\n\nLast night, I made my brother go to Uncle Boy's and get burgers to-go since I wanted to try the burgers at least once before we moved out of the Richmond. The hamburger buns are fluffy and large; the burgers themselves are chockful of patty, lettuce, tomato, and condiments. Not overly fancy, but hey, Uncle Boy's does not disappoint, especially adding the atmosphere and kind service into the equation.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, and, if you'd like, you can order the burger meals, which I believe come with fries and a drink (I can't quite remember). They're open until late (3am on some nights); soon they'll have beer, so Uncle Boy's should be a destination for all you nightowls.\n\nThey accept credit card as well, which is a plus. Overall, I like the place a lot! I just wish I weren't moving out of the area since Uncle Boy's is relatively new. Oh well; will just go out of my way to get a burger now.", "author": "Helene K."}

I live literally a block away, and I've tried to give tis hamburger joint the benefit of the doubt time and time again, but the food is not worth the price. A cheeseburger meal is almost 10 dollars, and for that you get a (usually) undercooked hamburger patty with a disappointing serving of fries. Also, as of 09/04/2010 they've raised their prices (again!), which hardly makes this place worth the trip.\n\nIf you're looking for a mediocre burger within walking distance, then go here. But if you'd like a decent meal at a decent price, then you might as well walk to buffalo burger or drive to in-n-out (essentially the same quality food at half the price)  or some other burger joint - believe me, this place will disappoint you, save your appetite for someplace worth it.", "author": "Alex H."}

It was a very good decision.\n\nWe parked and walked in and noticed right away it's more of a diner, than a restaurant but we found a way to make it work.  I mean, we were coming for the lumpia and the hamburgers, not a candlelight affair so we weren't too worried.\n\nWe ordered a hamburger meal, a chicken sandwich meal with a side of Lumpia and an extra side of fries for our daughter (who is very picky, and learned that night she likes Lumpia.)\n\nThe hamburger was simply amazing. The meat was fresh, soft and you could taste the seasonings, but more so, you could taste the meat. The char was an extra gift, it gave it that rustic flavor. The bun was a bit disproportionate to the size of the burger, only meaning it had way more bread than the burger had meat. The chicken sandwich was juicy and my wife enjoyed it very much, but the bread ratio kind of made it drier than it should have been.\n\nThe Lumpia was very nice, but the vinegar sauce that came with it, was epic. The fries are apparently soaked then fried to order and were amazing as well. The pepper is nice, but I think maybe on the side would be better or just some warning. My daughter and wife aren't the pepper fan I am, but again, not a big deal.\n\nWe walked out that night with full tummies and a sense of pride that we ate at a restaurant wherein the cook was very thankful, honest and humble. I haven't seen very many business owners on Yelp actually ASK for input to make their food better, or even care about what the diner eats. Here in the Richmond, I think we can say we are very aware of what is good and bad and eat accordingly. Uncle Boy's prices are great, and in-tune with what they are feeding you. You want a named celebrity burger that has no real personality, then go to Bills.  If you want a great burger made by people that really care about what they are feeding you, then go to Uncle Boy's.\n\nUpdate - We ordered delivery a few weeks later. I probably wouldn't do that again. Hamburgers need to be hot as well as fries, and they both came lukewarm. The food tasted great, after the toaster oven did it's magic. Just be ready. It's probably easier to just order ahead, double park and run in.", "author": "Edward P."}

I really wanted to love and to support a local burger business.\n\nTurns out that I got my hopes up though...every one of the three times (over the course of a month) I have called for delivery, it'll either take too long (over 45-60 minutes) or there are problems with the driver, thus no service.\n\nThe other day, I call to inquire about delivery and get (for me) the traditional, \"sorry, no delivery today.\" Okay, fine, I will go for pick-up in that case. Before I had the chance to say that I would come in for pick-up, the phone goes dead. \n\nThat's right, someone hung up the phone before I had the option to say that I could pick up the food.

When we walked in, I was immediately impressed with the clean, gimmick-free facilities. Uncle Boy's is definitely NOT trying too hard to be hip. \n\nOne man was working at the time and he did an excellent job of preparing food for the other patrons, taking our order in a timely manner and serving our orders quickly. As he was cooking our food, he double-checked with us to make sure he was preparing things correctly - I appreciated that a lot. \n\nWhen we finally got the food, I was in heaven. A couple of SoCal friends were going to just stop by and say hi, but I suggested they try a burger and they too were pleased.\n\nI got a veggie burger with jack cheese and onion rings. It was  excellent, and after a few hours, I didn't have the usual greasy stomach pains that often follow such delicious fare.\n\nMy boyfriend got a bacon burger with american cheese.

We just picked up food from here, and I can honestly say I've never had a worse fast food experience.\n\n1. We ordered two burgers, one with bacon & lettuce and the other with bacon & ketchup. We sat down and the guy immediately put our fries in the bag. Ten minutes later he put the burgers in the bag. The fries were already cold.\n\n2. We get back to the car and check the burgers. No patties. Yeah, I'm not kidding. We march back and state nicely that there are no patties. The dude argues with us that we didn't order patties. Why on earth would we go to a burger place and just order bacon in patties (and pay $11 per person for the privilege)??\n\n3. They made two other groups' orders before making our patties.

First two experiences were phenomenal, as the burger was nicely(if not a tad well) cooked, and the fries were fantastic. The latter was the tipping point for me making this my go-to burger joint in the Richmond. I am a sucker for real, skin-on, salt n' pepper french fries.\n\nHowever, much to my disappointment, these fried delights are no more. Furthermore, the cook was not on his game. I noticed that the condiments on my toasted buns were not what I ordered. As I politely pointed out the error, and second, correct bun was being prepped, I noticed my burger charring on the grill. YIKES! I understand he was a new cook, but really killed the hamburger. Ta boot, there was no ice available. Charring and lack of ice is tolerable, but will likely not return unless fry situation is alleviated.\n\nThe employee/owner I have encountered twice has been a joy, and is evident he hopes this business thrives. Changes like this will not help his case.\n\nOh yeah, last thing... Ya had cheddar last week, and it was a good thing.

Hope u choke on someones food!\"\n\nConsidering that his only published review is a ridiculously effusive one of Uncle Boy's, I imagine that this is one of the staff. Way to run a business, kids.\n\n\nThey used to make their french fries from fresh potatoes and fry them in vegetable oil.  Now they've switched to cheap shortening (hydrogenated oil), frozen fries, and cheap buns. I was told that the owner decided that serving actual food was 'too expensive'.\n\nTo to honest, this place has always  been amateur hour but at least they used to serve something resembling food.\n\nAt this point you're paying $8 for something a notch below McDonald's. Brilliant.\n\nEdit after comments received from John E, along with responses:\n\n**\nhi there, thanks for the input, but just so you know..\n\n 1. we changed our buns because too many people complained : \nabout them being too thick when we had them fresh made and the \nbakery could not change it.\n**\n\nThere are other bakeries in the city I'm sure that will provide appropriately thick (or thin) buns.\n\n**\n 2.we changed our fries because the fresh cut failed to be crispy \nenough for most people and no vendor was able to provide us with kenebec potatoes that did not have half the bag rotten.\n\n**\nThis sounds like a lousy excuse. Somehow other establishments manage to make fresh fries. Either they're all dealing with half-rotten bags and still managing to turn a profit or they have found suppliers who sell non-rotten potatoes.\n\nAlso, they weren't 'crispy enough' because you don't know how to deep fry properly. Proper french fries are fried twice. I can send you some links about French Fry making if you're want to know how it's done.\n\n**\n3.both frying oils you mentioned are the same price only the vegetable oil took longer in cooking and could not handle frying up heavy amounts of food at a time.\n**\n\nFry less food per batch. You're not a high volume operation anyway.\n\n**\nI am just trying to improve our services.\n**\n\nThe fact that you're fielding the responses here is a good sign but making excuses for why you're using inferior ingredients and cooking methods isn't 'improving' anything.", "author": "Peter B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-01", "description": "The recent surge of new burger joints and the obvious interest in consuming them has put new bounce in my step, so thanks all you lovers of this universal meal in some form of wrap.  I learned about Uncle Boy's on Yelp, my favorite place to look, learn and divulge MY feelings about so many things, but for me Burgers, as well as to read what the rest of you have to say.  It's kind of new, and Balboa is a neighborhood that offers little foliage and distinction so this little gem stands out.  I walked in about 4:00 PM on a recent weekday and was greeted by one of the nicest young counter men I've ever ordered anything from, and he could easily pass for an Abercrombie model, whew.  I surveyed the back wall menu and decided on the Niman Cheeseburger with fries and a soda for just under $10.00, such a deal.  It's a small, rectangular storefront with plate glass windows looking out on several contractors businesses and some three story apartments that feel kind of sad.  There are maybe a half dozen tables, a three stool window counter, a clean black and white tile floor and white walls sporting some NFL and NBL memorabilia and little else.  Soon enough that guy at the counter handed me a red plastic basket with my burger and fries, wrapped as neat and tidy as a baby in diapers.  The burger was cooked perfect, I was elated that they new how to faithfully cook to order good chopped beef.  The cheese was melted and a pretty as a picture and the fixings were portrait quality too.  The fries, I dove in immediately, were hot and crisp, lightly salted and so nice, a generous portion too.  \nWhy do some people get it with burgers and others don't have a clue?  It's baffling to me that anyone would order steak cooked to order, a potato and salad and marvel when it comes out the way they want it, and yet have so little to say about the much more intricate and complicated burger that contains just about the whole nutrition tree and requires skill and timing to cook and assemble with distinction.  This small place reminds me of Pearl's, one of my absolute favorite burger places, on Post Street where burger making is an art form.  Back to my burger, the 1/3 lb. meat patty was obviously hand formed and fresh, the seeded bun was toasted, the cheese was a generous slice or two and draped beautifully over the scrumptious meat, and the lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle were fresh, copious and cold for crunch and taste.  The owner came in during my meal and I asked a couple of questions leading off with where the name came from.  He said that in the Philippines, like here, it is common to call family friends uncle and auntie and it was that simple, a warm and familial salutation and invitation to try the Uncle Boy's very good grub.  I also asked why burgers, and he told me he wanted to own his own business and after studying the market and neighborhood, a high quality, reasonably priced burger place made sense and hence we're now graced with Uncle Boy's on Balboa.  A sweet addition to our burger line-up.", "author": "Stu S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-01-22", "description": "Late last year while riding the 31 bus home, I spied an unfamiliar marquee on the south side of Balboa between 3rd & 4th Ave.  The giant burger on the sign was a good indicator as to what type of place it was (or was going to be), but what the heck is an Uncle Boy?  A posting on my favorite neighborhood blog (free plug for richmondsfblog.com) soon cleared up my cultural ignorance, as well as let me know they were up and running.  So being a.) a burger fan, b). always up for trying new things, and c). an avid supporter of new and local business, especially in my beloved Richmond District, I decided to give them a try.\n\nFirst impressions on walking in?  The place is immaculately clean.  It's got that \"new business smell\".  Actually, it smells like they make food there, and surprise, they do!  There are a few tables, a little bit of counter space, and two flat screens.  But enough about the decor and facilities.\n\nThe gentleman behind the counter (and it was just him when I went) is a warm and friendly guy who goes the extra mile to make sure his patrons are welcome, and more importantly, that the order is accurate, as he demonstrated with the family of four that was just ahead of me.  When it came my turn, I ordered the Bacon Cheeseburger (hold the ketchup) combo meal, which comes with fries and a fountain drink.  It took a little while for my food to be ready, but it was quite understandable considering it was just him doing everything.\n\nSo the food arrives, and as I often do (because I've been burned on this many a time), I check for ketchup.  No ketchup!  Automatic points for order accuracy!  The burger itself is piled high with the usual fixings, a HEAPING (no way that's two slices) pile of bacon, all nestled in a bun.  The fries are piping hot, medium cut (thicker than shoestring, thinner than steak cut), and peppered.  Descriptions done.  Time to eat!\n\nUncle Boy's slogan is \"Small menu, big taste\".  This statement is accurate.  The burger was flavorful and juicy, the fixings were crisp, fresh, and generous (especially the bacon), and the bun fluffy.  But what really stood out for me were the fries.  I mentioned earlier they were peppered, but what they did not seem to be were salted, and this is a good thing.  The pepper flavor, aside from being a refreshing change of pace, was strong, but not too strong that it overpowered the potatoes.  A perfect balance.  The salt that you can add yourself hardly seemed necessary.\n\nWhile thoroughly pleased with my meal, I believe there is room for improvement here.  In my opinion, the burger patty should reach or slightly stick out from the edges of the bun, ensuring there is beef in every bite.  My recollection is that it got a bit lost in there, and my last couple bites were burger-free (but since there was so much bacon, it wasn't as big of an issue).  If they added an extra ounce to the patties or used slightly smaller buns, this could probably be resolved.  Second, and this is more a matter of personal taste, they use a golden brown mustard versus the classic yellow.  Since I'm more of a yellow mustard guy, this was unexpected, and while my burger was great, I think it would have been better with French's classic.\n\nWhen I went to pay, the proprietor was genuinely interested in how I enjoyed my meal, and if I had any feedback, positive OR negative, as did one of his partners who joined him later.  We discussed the menu for a bit.  Apparently, they'll make pretty much anything the way you want it, provided they have the ingredients.  Make it a double?  Sure.  Add onion rings and barbecue sauce to make it a western?  Absolutely.  Their menu is indeed small, so they can't fit all the secret goodies on there, but these folks will practically bend over backwards to accommodate your more gluttonous desires.  Also, check out their website, as they've now put the entire menu (with pricing) up, including the extra patty option.  Because the only thing better than a bacon cheeseburger is a bacon double cheeseburger.\n\nIn short, this place is well on its way to becoming a neighborhood favorite, and considering the dearth of \"regular\" burger joints in this city, I welcome you with open arms and an empty stomach.  And the delivery option doesn't hurt either (for Richmonders only, sorry Mission hipsters, you have to ride your fixies).\n\nAnd now, to try the wings...\n\nPS:  Any chance of adding mushrooms, either as a topping or a deep fried side?", "author": "N.

This should seem ordinary but few fast food joints rarely do this. When they say something on the menu is crunchy and delicious they really mean it. Second, the price is more than fair for the generous portions they give you. I'm a big dude and I was definitely satisfied after finishing my meal.

They are only a few blocks from my house, have great hours, and they are a small fledgling business. Unfortunately, while the service is great and the employees are nice, the food just doesn't cut it.\n\nI've eaten here 3 times in hopes that my previous visits were flukes. They weren't. The fries are soggy, the burger buns are bland, and the meat is only average.

We got both as meals with fries and sodas and were both VERY satisfied with our orders. The corndogs were perfectly made and the fries with their pepper topping were delicious. I was a little nervous ordering friend food for delivery but both meals came very quickly and were still warm and tasty! We asked for ketchup with our order and were given the perfect amount (not too little like some places in the area) and even the fountain sodas weren't too watery like they'd been sitting around too long.

Anyway, he whipped up our burgers pretty fast and we enjoyed chatting with him as he did, super pleasant man. \nNow, I suppose I should mention that, as I am not supposed to be eating gluten, it is a very rare occasion when I do indulge in the hamburger bun, but this night, looking at the juicy, cozily wrapped burger, I just had to. Oh and even this morning I believe it was worth it (still wish there were more gluten free buns out there). \nThe cheeseburgers were cooked perfectly. I read some reviews that they were overcooked and on this occasion I would disagree. Plus having a close friend with a food science degree, I would really rather not eat any ground meat not cooked completely, but beside the point. The lettuce, tomatoes, pickles, onion situation was well proportioned, and the condiments didn't tried to attack as soon as the burger was lifted up.
