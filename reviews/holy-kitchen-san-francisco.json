I was there on Sunday for brunch and was surprised to find the restaurant mostly empty. They apparently do a brisk takeout business. My date and I enjoyed having the place to ourselves. It's a great spot for a quiet date.\n\nWe ordered samosas, chana masala, gobi mattar (not on the menu but they'll make it), and roti. I had the chai, which comes with free refills.\n\nThe food came out quickly and was delicious. I like the home-cooking style of cooking. Some Indian restaurants put too much fat and oil into the dishes. Here, you feel like your mother is cooking for you. Oh, and the prices are totally reasonable!", "author": "Joshua W."}

I got the medium spicy and it wasn't spicy at all, so I would recommend getting one level higher of spiciness to add a little more flavor to it. \n\nThe naan was good but pretty rubbery at that point since it was wrapped up in foil the entire way.

And.It.Was.EVERYTHING! I'm used to homemade Indian food, and this was definitely a close second.\n\nThis place is on the small, intimate side, if you know what I mean. A little gem in the heart of Noe Valley. Great place to check out for a quick lunch or dinner date (or just because, since their food is delicious!) One of the best things about this place is the Naan: cooked nice and buttery and to perfection. They also have Poori (a wheat bread) which has been hard for me to find.\n\nThe flavors are delicious however if you are one for spice, I would say this isn't too spicy ( which is great for me, but if you love that spicy kick, you just may be disappointed). I don't mind though, because I love flavor and not necessarily a lot of kick. \n\nToo many dishes to name that were delicious: the Shrimp Biryani, Fish Curry, Aloo Gobi, Mattar Paneer to name a few. Honestly, you can't go wrong with anything here! Not to mention, service is fantastic!\n\nAnd kudos for being able to fit not one but TWO strollers in this place (one being a double stroller at that).", "author": "Tracy T."}

Holy Kitchen offers lunch specials, even on the weekend, which is a plus.\n\nBoth of us got the lunch specials, which are definitely the way to go. Mine was $8.99 for mixed veggies, dal, a side salad, rice and roti. His was $9.99 for Chicken Tikka Masala, Dal, a side salad, rice and Naan. Both of us ordered ours spicy. We were brought Papadum to start, which is always good. The food arrived quickly and the portion was MASSIVE. I left 3/4 of my rice and 1/2 of my Roti, and trust me guys, I can eat.  The food was clearly fresh and everything was pretty good. My main complaint was that there wasn't enough spice, especially for ordering something \"spicy\". Sticking some dried chilis in Dal does not count. Plus the Roti was a bit meh and the Naan was not much better. I also did not really appreciate how the mixed vegetable entree wasn't advertised with Paneer. Personally, I avoid Paneer and would not have ordered it had I known.\n\nI would definitely come back, but probably for dinner when we can try more of their menu.

You know kids).  And forget about samosas & the desserts my grandmother used to make for me.  I was thoroughly spoiled.  \n\nIt naturally makes it difficult for me to eat in Indian restaurants.\n\nBut on a sleepy stay at home night, I wanted Indian, & I wanted delivery, & Holy Kitchen looked promising.\n\nSince this was my first experience w them, & my man has had limited exposure to Indian food, I was conservative & went w staples.\n\nSamosas to start.  Lamb achari, chicken curry, & basmati rice for the mains.  And garlic naan for our bread group.\n\nThe samosas were enormous.  They were tasty enough.  But bigger isn't always better.\n\nThe lamb achari was our favorite dish; the sauce was fragrant & delicious.  We asked for spicy, & this delivered.  The heat wasn't overbearing, but made its presence known.  Only, I wasn't wowed by the flavor of the meat.  Good lamb shouldn't taste gamey.  Ever.  \n\nHaving read & seen that their butter chicken is too tomatoey (it shouldn't be, plus, my heart belongs to Amber India for butter chicken), I went w the chicken curry instead.  One of my favorite dishes, I think you can measure how good an Indian restaurant is by how good their chicken curry is.  Indian curry is not like Thai or Japanese curry.  This was disappointing.  Very mediocre.  Pass.\n\nDisclaimer:\nYou shouldn't order chicken curry when you make a kick-ass version yourself...& so does your mom.\n\nThe garlic naan...\nIt had a good degree of garlic & it did satisfy the garlic craving.  But it was on the thick & doughy side.  Naan is not supposed to be focaccia.\n\nThe basmati rice was great.  Cooked to perfection.\n\nThe mango lassi was not bad.  A touch tart, but not bad (again, Amber India makes a great one).  They do a house \"lemon water,\" aka lemonade.  My man loved it.\n\nOverall, not bad.  Props for not being oily, & for delivering in an hour, as promised.\n\nYes, I'm picky.  But there are so many better options in SF for Indian.  \n\n3 stars.", "author": "Veronica M."}

The restaurant itself wasn't super crowded, but severely understaffed. There were just 2 women frantically taking orders, clearing tables and taking care of the take out orders. They took our order quickly enough, but we ended up having to wait 45 minutes to actually get our food. I think take out is the way to go with this place. The decor is a bit off, and depressing. \n\nWe ordered the lamb shish kabob, Chana masala, roti and naan. The shish kabob was really good. The lamb wasn't smelly at all, and it came out on one of those sizzling plates you sometimes see with fajitas. The chana masala was pretty standard, but way too spicy. I'm used to spicy food and prefer it, but this was almost too difficult to eat. I wish they at least gave some raita on the side. The roti and naan were delicious--not slathered in butter or hard at all. \n\nSorry, there are no pictures because I was way too hungry.", "author": "Trena M."}

Most everything tastes amazing, and I list particularly spectacular dishes below. The restaurant is clean, with a light happy atmosphere (think yellow walls and soft Indian music). Some reviews criticize the ambiance because the restaurant is empty, but as far as we can tell the only reason it's occasionally empty are reviews like those! \n\nThe staff are wonderfully accommodating, efficient, and polite. Everyone we take there raves about the food. For us though, the restaurant's kid-friendly nature is the real winner. They love having kids in the restaurant, don't mind when they get the tablecloths dirty, make mild dishes truly mild, have a centrally located and easy to monitor bathroom, offer more than enough highchairs, and don't bat an eyelash when you have to run when the wheels suddenly come off (they grab the check and pack all the leftovers in a snap). Our kids dine here regularly and with no stress. \n\nAs for food, all the chicken dishes we've had were made with large chunks of carefully trimmed breast meat, never gristle. We're particularly fond of the Badami Chicken, a nutty, creamy curry, and the Peas Pilau, a rice dish with nuts and onions. The Chicken Tikka Masala is a bit tomoato-y for my taste, but my daughter and sister-in-law love it. My mom is a huge fan of the Chicken Vindaloo. The Eggplant Bharta is a family favorite. My husband must have the Corn Chat and Chana Masala. We always get the Saag Paneer as well, and have enjoyed the Malabar Fish Curry a few times (it's a creamy coconut sauce similar to the Badami but less nutty).

Not that there aren't other holy lands in the world, but when I think of the Holy Land, I think of historical Jerusalem and present-day Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories.\n\nSecond, I think of the place on the south side of Townsend Street between 7th and 8th Streets, before the Caltrain bypass tracks begin.  Isn't that place also called Holy Kitchen?  And doesn't it have a totally different logo from the Noe Valley Holy Kitchen?  Are they related?  Were they related?  How could two Indian places named Holy Kitchen in San Francisco not be related?  I'll have to do some lazy research and report back on this one.\n\nThe food is OK.  The delivery can take a while, but I live really far from the Land of the Double-Wide Strollers, so that's not their fault.  Maybe a huge stroller was blocking the street because God knows those things don't fit on the sidewalk, not totally.\n\nTheir spiciness meter is busted.  I asked for medium heat on both dishes.  One was relatively hot, which I don't mind, but the other one was like typical-white-guy-from-Omaha-who's-never-had-Indian-food-before mild.

The deep-fried potato croquettes were just the right size and crispiness, and the tikki sauce it was served with was so flavorful and fragrant in a wonderful way.  It doesn't look like much, but you will want to try this appetizer.\n\nFish Curry: generous chunks of white fish served in a chunky tomato sauce.  The tomato sauce is not overwhelming, because it's seasoned so nicely that it's actually quite complex.\n\nSaag Paneer: nothing special about this saag, it's pretty standard and by that I mean a decent staple.  There are huge cubes of homemade paneer floating around the curry, which is a good thing.\n\nLamb Vindaloo:  not the best vindaloo, but very decent, and the medium was spicy enough to make my husband wipe his brow and gulp his water several times.  Even though it was spicy, it was also (purportedly) rich in flavor.\n\nGarlic Naan:  for two people, it was one medium-sized serving that was cut into four little sections.  Not very generous and you'll definitely run out, even if you were metering that naan hardcore.  Also, it's delicious.\n\nNote: Medium spiciness is pretty spicy for most people.

I'm giving them a conditional 4 stars here, and will update this review after going again in a week or so. \n\nWe went last night at around 7p, and when we got there, were told to seat ourselves, which was fine - there weren't a lot of people there, so we put ourselves in the little back room. Our waitress was very sweet and friendly, though she did write our order on her hand with a pen, which was a bit odd in my opinion. Anyways, we ordered two beers and an app. \n\nOur app was the Chili Chicken, and this was the best item of the night. Very, very tasty. I've attached a picture of it (or will attach a picture of it when I can figure out how to). I loooove spicy food (ghost chilis are my fav), so while I thought this was mild, my fiance thought it was more of a medium/hot, and he loved it. I also loved it, though, it was interesting and great!\n\nFor meals, I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, extra extra spicy/Indian-style spicy. I promised the waitress upside down and backwards that I would not send it back, and it could not be too spicy. My fiance ordered the Chicken Vindaloo. We also got garlic naan and some basmati rice. \n\nThe chicken tikka masala was tasty, but it was not spicy in the least (this was also confirmed by my fiance). So, that was unfortunate. The waitress never did come by to ask how everything was, so I couldn't say anything. I ended up just eating it. It was good, I don't regret it, I just wish I'd had a chance to say 'hey, can you add a kick to this?'. My fiance doesn't normally like Indian food, but he really enjoyed the Chicken Vindaloo - I actually got an agreement out of him that we can go again! Woohoo!\n\nOh, I forgot to talk about the naan. Adding this in later, sorry for the edit. I'm not hugely into naan, but my fiance ate all four pieces. He really enjoyed it. I got a bite, and it was fluffy and pretty tasty! The rice was also solid. Just straightforward basmati rice.\n\nAt the end, we got our check, and the two beers weren't on it. We pointed that out, and got an updated check with only my beer on it, and the waitress disappeared as soon as she dropped it off again. I gave up at that point and just paid for our meals and one beer, with a little extra on the tip. Just as we were about to leave, the waitress reappeared and told us she had forgotten the second beer, and we needed to pay for it. I ended up just giving her a $10 and leaving (this covered the $4 beer and a remarkable extra tip). I wasn't going to fight over it, but the front of the house is obviously very disorganized. \n\nAs we left, I stopped by the bathrooms - 5 stars there, the bathroom was very clean and nice. Overall, this place is good so far, but I'm holding final judgement until I get a chance to go again. Hopefully they'll have sorted out their service issues the next time I go.\n\nEdited on 5/6/14: Changed this to 5 stars, as after getting takeout three times in the past month or two and having it be wonderfully spicy, I'm completely satisfied and loving this place! I haven't been back for eat-in, so I can't update my review regarding if their service issues were ironed out, but if you ask for \"spicy, indian style spicy, seriously please so spicy I am crying\" they will do it for takeout!

After contemplating several options, I chose Holy Kitchen.  And, am I glad that I did!\nI was greeted warmly and given a table with a view of the street.  The tables were covered in white cloths, and authentic Indian music played in the background.   The server brought some crispy chips made from chickpea flour and two spicy sauces:  a chutney and tamarind.  They had a nice, uncomplicated wine list, and I chose Nobilo Sauvignon Blanc.  I was given a very nice pour of this delicious wine.\nI had so many questions about the menu for the server, and she patiently explained everything to me.  I chose the cottage cheese stuffed vegetable balls and ordered the dish extra hot.  I nixed the rice and the naan because I thought that it would have been too much for me.  But now after seeing another patron's naan, I wish that I had ordered it to take back to the hotel.\nThe dish was delicious!  Vegetable balls had nice chewy texture.  And that sauce!  I could have licked the plate.  It was creamy and pleasantly spicy.  As I always say, it could have been a little hotter, but I was pleased with the flavor.  \nThe puzzling thing to me is that there were only 3 or 4 patrons in this beautiful restaurant.  Where was everybody?  With this quality of food, service, and atmosphere, I feel sorry for those who got their lunch elsewhere.", "author": "Robin C."}

The formal definition of this dish is a dish of roasted chunks of chicken tikka in a spicy sauce. The sauce is usually creamy, spiced and orange-coloured. What I received was a few chunks of plain chicken with some soggy onions, no sauce. Keep in mind that the container the food came in was labeled \"Tikka Kebab\". I then proceeded to talk to their customer service representative for an hour trying to receive a refund. When it looked like i was about to get my order right, the girl tells me that what i ordered was chicken tikka masala and would not get a refund.

It was a little sweet and might not be to everyone's liking. So make sure to mention you would prefer it to be spicy if that's your thing.\n\nTo finish ordered the Vegetable biryani, I asked for medium spicy level and my mouth was on fire 5 minutes in.

The Daal Tadka was so healthy and had great flavor (got it mild for the kids). My husband loves anything spicy with cauliflower so the Aloo Gobi was perfect for him. I got the Sahi Paneer and it was delish. I ended up feeding a little bowl to my 8 month old (no teeth) and she devoured it. Her first Indian food! I was a little nervous at first. But she slept blissfully the whole night. :)\n\nYou must get their mango chutney and raita. I put them on a little of everything we ordered.

We gave our notice over a month ago at our old apartment, and have been searching for the right place. Long story short, we didn't find a place that suits our needs, so we ended up moving all our stuff to storage and staying at our friends' apartment in Noe Valley while we keep searching.\n\nThe move out day was a pain in the ass. We have a 10 month old daughter and trying to do all this stuff, manage the movers etc, signing up for the storage and fitting everything in, moving the rest of our stuff etc to our temp place, all the while taking care of a 10 month old, is difficult to say the least.\n\nThe last hours I found the hardest. The move out really got to me at a level I didn't know existed. We got through it though, but I felt sad and incomplete.\n\nAs it approached dinner time, I realized that it was not the feeling of completeness I so needed, but the feeling of not being empty. as Jonathan Safran Foer once put it.\n\nAnyways, we decided to find a place close by and randomly ended up in Holy Kitchen. Me and my wife really like Indian food so we were excited to try a new place.\n\nAnd BOOM. Boy did we have Indian food. The food was so good, the nan was probably the best nan I've had in the city.

We had the Gobi Manchurian as an appetizer to start, and it was fantastic!  The Lamb Saag and Chicken Tandoori were also excellent.  A wonderful, relaxing way to enjoy a meal on a Saturday evening.  Give them a try! :)", "author": "Terri L."}

We were the first customers for their dinner. We were greeted promptly and the place looked clean but my plates were dusty and I just took another one from another table.. The music in the background was sad maybe that's the reason why the employees were not smiling. We got our food pretty quick it was a bit bland and it only lasted warm for couple of seconds. My husband I were expecting more flavor since the prices are a little higher than their restaurant downtown. My husband and I asked to talk to the owner because we had met him downtown several times, and we wanted to give him some feedback. she didn't say no and it seemed she understood what we're asking but she just stood there, staring at us and never got the owner for Us. We will come back again to give them another chance if not we will stick to their other location.", "author": "Darling L."}

They messed up my roti order and it took them forever to bring the original order and the replacement order. I asked them half portion for the replacement and they thought I cancelled the replacement and finally brought me the full portion of the replacement order. They were sufficiently apologetic about the mess up, but not apologetic on bringing full portion for replacement. I was trying to avoid wastage and left with a sour taste in my mouth.", "author": "Vinod K."}

The first time we went was late on Mothers Day. There were only a few people in the restaurant but it took a very long time to be served. I had chicken curry, meat and gravy only, which was far to spicy for me, I had asked for medium and was told that it would be mild.\nMy second visit at eight on a recent Friday, again just a handful of people eating but a fair amount of takeouts. We were seated and after 15 minutes I had to ask for menu's. The phone kept on ringing with no one answering it,there was  a small line of people waiting to be seated or for take out. The scene was very surreal, the one owner and the waitress were both very stressed. We decided to do a take out instead of staying as we had a toddler with us who became fussy. Our food to go took quite a long time to get. They had packed one dish we did not order and when we got home they did not give us the two rice orders we had asked for. This place desperately needs help and maybe hire more people. I have never had such a strange restaurant experience. I thought the food was just OK but disappointing. I will never try them again.\nI do hope they get it together the owners seem very nice.", "author": "Cary F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-08-04", "description": "I've been looking for a good take out Indian food place that would deliver to The Castro for seven years and Holy Kitchen is it.  After reading the reviews that the food was tasty but service/delivery could take a while, I decided to take a chance and am SOOOO glad that I did.  Could be that it was okay because I called in the order at 5:40 on an Sunday night, hoping to get the food by 7, but it showed up at our door in about 20 minutes.  Everything we ordered was DELICIOUS!  One thing I really appreciated too is that there were enough smaller/medium sized pieces of  protein (chicken / lamb / cheese) in all of the dishes for everyone to have a good taste VS other places we've ordered from where there's 4 big chunks of meat and the rest is sauce / veg.  So happy to have found Holy Kitchen.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

My wife and I were very excited to see the terrible Thai restaurant down the block replaced by Holy Kitchen; unfortunately, Holy Kitchen is a holy mess.  Not only did they keep us waiting 30 minutes for a take-out order that was supposed to be ready in 10 minutes, the food was overpriced and disappointing.  The \"Chef's Recommended\" Butter Chicken was frankly terrible; while the sauce was flavorful, and they respected my request to prepare it spicy (by Desi standards), the chicken they used in it tasted like it was day-old tandoori chicken drumsticks left over from an earlier buffet.  Rather than tasty chunks of tender chicken breast, the meat was picked off of drums and thighs, and included tough cartilage and gristle--I literally had to spit out my mouthful twice because the chicken cuts were so bad.  Unforgivable, especially at the prices they're charging.", "author": "Khurshid K."}
