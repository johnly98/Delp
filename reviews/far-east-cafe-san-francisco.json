We decided to give it a shot because the food on yelp looked great and because they closed later than most Chinese restaurant. They had many servers who always attended us and gave us the greatest service. They were super nice and did not rush us when we were ordering.\n\nWe tried the Beef/Vegetable Chow Mein, Dried String Beans, and a small bowl of Hot and Sour soup (serves two) and everything was great and up to my expectation! The string beans were soooo bomb because of the sauce. The price is a bit high for a traditional Chinese restaurant but I respect the hustle and don't mind when the service is great.\n\nI would definitely come back here again.

This used to be a great little place...emphasis on used to be. On this visit, gone were the lions and gone was the idea of good food with a little nostalgia. \n\nEvery dish I had here was absolutely the worst. This place is a far different dining experience. I ate here with my wife and we had the fried calamari, shrimp dumplings, shrimp and vegetables stir fry and the BBQ pork egg foo yong. For starters the dumplings were chewy (see photo), thick and had no shrimp. The calamari was overly salted and loaded with MSG. The shrimp and vegetables was edible but had no flavor. The egg foo yong used to be my favorite dish, but it was mostly egg with invisible pork. Our waiter was kind enough but for the price I paid, I wish they put more effort into their food. \n\nIf you are in Chinatown, just walk fast past this place. It was a poor meal and I doubt many of the other dishes have any redeeming qualities.", "author": "Sean C."}

I do wish they had more veggie options that night, but the menu was set so there wasn't anything I could do. My favorite dish was the walnut prawns!

It doesn't help when you also know those that can cook authentic Chinese food for you as well.  This always poses a dilemma for me going to a Chinese restaurant.\n\nAfter a day of walking around SF we were STARVING LIKE HOSTAGES!  We wanted to get in this last little area before calling it quits for the day so when we saw this place we went in to eat.  They were not busy but there were a few people inside.  We were greeted as we walked in and seated right away.\n\nWe perused the menu and they came to take our drink orders.  We both got water since not having any all day.  Gulp gulp, gulp, aweeeee refreshing.!  They kept our glasses filled which was great.  Next they brought over some tea.\n\nLooking at a menu when our starving is quite difficult.  We went back and forth with what to get.  I ended up with the mixed veggies and Bunny got the some beef dish that came over rice.  We also shared some spring rolls.\n\nWe chatted and another family from Texas came in.  I wish they would have sat them else where.  All they did was complain about the tea.  This taste different.  Umm yes it's not sweet tea darl'ing.  \n\nOur spring rolls arrived and they were DELISH!  I always love the sauce they come with.  We tried not to eat those all up waiting for our food so we would have room.  Soon our food arrived to the table just as Mary-Sue and Jimmy-Joe and Huck were placing there order.  Wat's fry'd ri-ic-ice?  They have shrimp n-da fry'd ri-ice?  That sound gross. Well leave then Ruth-Ann and go to McDonald's.   Oh Jimmy-Jo dey have da blue crab herr.  Ugh....So annoying.  \n\nWe dug in teeth first.  Thank goodness we had the spring rolls before hand.  The food was just ok!  My veggies were cooked perfectly.  I could have used a bit more seasoning in the sauce.  Bunny liked his food and ended up with left overs.  \n\nThe service was good but the food was a bit hit and miss for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-06-21", "description": "I guess I can't blame some people who came here with expectations that the food would be \"as good\" as Panda Express or a can of Chun King or, for the far more sophisticated and worldly diners, expectations that they would find \"truly gourmet\" Chinese food like that bastion of fine taste, P.F.Chang.  Those people would give this 100+ year old building 0-stars for being \"old\". Sure they would hate the antique hand-made lanterns as being \"too dark\" compared to proper LED fixtures.  Sure they would say that the staff (many of whom have worked here 30 years) aren't \"cute\" and \"trendy\".  I've read the reviews from those same people about ANY restaurant that's not a trendy multi-location chain that serves \"American-sized portions\" of microwaved frozen food. They obviously don't get out much.\n\nNope, you won't find any of that at Far East Cafe. Stay away if you're idea of Chinese food is canned chop suey!\n\nNot that I know anything about Chinese restaurants. I've only filmed documentaries in China and eaten in restaurants big and small in large cities and tiny rural villages in China.  First off, historically China has amazing food ... they just don't use the word gourmet, that's an American affectation. In China portions aren't \"super-sized\". They are generally fresh, healthy, and served family-style.\n\nFar East Cafe reminds me a lot of some if the larger restaurants in China's more metropolitan cities.  It isn't made of plastic designed to look like a movie set, everything is real. The people who work there aren't millennials dressed in fake Chinese-looking costumes.  The food doesn't come in a can from a restaurant supply company.\n\nI had seaweed soup to start. I bet not one person who left a negative review would even try seaweed soup. It tasted like seaweed ...yum!  I did have the obligatory Dim Sum, something San Francisco natives call \"pork rolls\".  None of it looked or tasted \"gourmet\", in other words it was served as traditional Chinese food is served.\n\nBottom line, sure this place exists primarily for tourists. It's one of the first restaurants you come to inside the main Dragon Gate on Grant Street. If wouldn't be a bad idea if they had an instruction manual to help newbies dine there so they wouldn't be looking for trendy Americanized chain restaurant-type \"Chinese food\".  As far as service, what I saw were hard working people who live locally who hovered over us like a mother hen to make sure we were being served efficiently and properly.\n\nIF YOU GO: Far East Caf\u00e9 first opened its doors in this building in 1920 in a historic building that is one of the oldest in San Francisco, built in 1908 soon after the devastating 1906 earthquake. They serve Cantonese and Szechuan style food. The chandeliers are from an ancient China palace and the murals and paintings are hand-made and are over 100 years old. Prices are very low and reasonable, especially when you take into account they are in a high rent extreme tourist area.", "author": "Todd H."}

The building and decor are very nice - has an old-school feel to it. The service was fine, though when I wanted to ask if the \"lychee dessert\" was just lychee or something else with it, neither of the two people I asked understood, nor did they look for someone who might. Overall though, the service was good - we were given water and hot tea just a couple minutes after being seated. \n\nThe food itself was just okay, with the appetizer sampler being the best of what we ordered (I would give just that a 4). The spring rolls were fried to perfection and i really enjoyed the dough that the potstickers were wrapped in. As for entrees, the vegetable chow fun had a good amount of bok choy, a bit of carrots, and a few slivers of cabbage. Altogether I found there was a good balance of noodles and veggies, though for some the veggies may have overpowered the noodles. Unfortunately, it seemed to just be seasoned with soy sauce because it was quite salty. Finally, my mom ordered the shrimp & chicken fried rice and again, it was just okay. Not the best fried rice you'll ever have but probably not the worst either. The main dishes came in large portions so we were both able to eat from each dish and still had left overs of both, probably because we were stuffed from the appetizers. \n\nAll in all, if you are famished and can't take another step to find a different restaurant, Far East Cafe will certainly satiate your hunger but by no means will it wow your taste buds.", "author": "Leslie C."}

We were exploring San Fransisco, and about the time we wandered into Chinatown, the hunger pains developed into somethin' fierce. A quick Yelp check, and a TripAdvisor cross-reference eluded to the Far East Cafe. We wanted the best Chinese food we could find, quickly, and on a reasonable budget - we had reservations at three sushi restaurants later on, so we needed to travel light. A plate of Lo Mein, some steamed pork buns, and a pile of seared pot stickers should be just the ticket!\n\nTheir Lo Mein is in a word: explosive! The flavor is rich, wild, pungent, and clean. Who knew you could taste such magic from a plate of perfectly balanced, al dente noodles? Perhaps the flavor resulted from the MSG the chefs may, or may have not used in the sauce. Who cares, because it was the best, most memorable noodle dish I've ever had. If that plate of lo mein was local, I would live on it. \n\nTheir steamed pork buns had a sweet flavor element I couldn't place, like they had steeped the meat in a thin barbecue sauce; I don't know that I would order them again, but they were very clean. The potstickers were both clean and wonderful; rich with flavor, but they're potstickers - so if you don't mangle them, all potstickers are comparable within their respective derivative cultures. \n\nThe service was abrupt, and hurried - but not in a bad way. It seems part of their traditional culture, with much of the restaurant seemingly projecting such cultural elements. I haven't been to China yet, but I would assume - compared with restaurants in Kansas City - that they've gotten the experience close to culturally authentic.

Private rooms behind Chinese decorated curtains open to large happy ending sized tables of a different kind. A massive menu of traditional Americanized Chinese dishes promises to deliver incredibly flavorful dishes. Portions are larger than expected and advertised, and the quality of the food is top shelf. Decorated like an old Chinese casino like room. Wide open, dark, large tables, almost factory. Slightly cold (not in temperature). There is a vintage bar with an amazing chandelier hanging from above. The only thing missing are the smiles from the wait staff and cool merch to let people know I ate at Far East Cafe. The wait staff are all named Peter, Jim, and other names I don't know are real. Who knows really. Anywho, excellent meals. Great timing from order to delivery.

We also made a reservation for a private booth, so we thought it would be a delightful treat.\n\nOnce we got into our \"booth\" it's literally a table with a wooden box around it with a curtain as the entryway. The walls are full of graffiti and looks so ghetto. I guess the atmosphere should have been a telltale sign that the food isn't so good either.\n\nWe ordered 8 dishes: Barbeque pork wonton soup, fried calamari, honey walnut prawns, clams with black bean sauce, Peking spareribs, saut\u00e9ed snow peas in garlic sauce, half a roast duck, and beef broccoli pan fried noodles. \n\nThe soup was lukewarm and the bbq pork was hard as a rock. Literally- it hurt my dads teeth. I didn't bother eating it. The fried calamari is also hard and 90% breading. The honey walnut prawns was probably the only edible item here, aside from the snow peas. The clams with black bean sauce was more like celery with black bean sauce. It was also extremely fishy. The Peking spareribs was mostly fat and was super sour. The roast duck isn't your normal roast duck. They claimed it was crispy and it was soggy. It was also served in an overspiced black sauce. Lastly, the pan fried noodles was gloppy and tasted strange. It was DISGUSTING.\nEverything here was unappetizing and disappointing.\n\nNow the night my sister is supposed to have fun, is ruined by this ridiculous restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-04", "description": "First off, you have to understand this restaurant for what it is: it's a very old restaurant in a very old building with some wonderful architecture and provides a glimpse at what restaurants in Chinatown were like in the 1950s or prior. That is, to me, worth the price of admission of dining here at least once. You get to see some stunningly grand interior architecture and an approach to restaurants that is seldom seen any more but was crucial to formulating what dining out is to America and especially to how Chinese food was viewed up to at least the 1980s when the dreadful trend of these strip-mall take-out places cropped up. At a time, if you lived in a city with a Chinatown (yes, yes, all the more so if you are Jewish) a pilgrimage to one of that Chinatown's Chinese restaurants was a treat looked forward to and helped formulate how Chinese-American food became important in America. Also, many of the dishes long associated with Chinese cuisine more or less originated in restaurants like this one and not in some far-away kitchen in Shanghai during the Yuan Dynasty. \n\nSo, a few notes insofar as getting the best experience of Far East Caf\u00e9:\n\n--It's a seafood restaurant, a Cantonese seafood restaurant. It built its local repute on its Cantonese seafood, but now it does everything under the sun, including fixed-price banquets and the like. Stick to the Cantonese seafood dishes. Lobster with ginger, pan-fried sole fish, clams with black bean sauce and nearly anything they do with prawns should be quite good. If they have something like General Tso's chicken on the menu  . . . really? You're going to order Americanized Chinese you can get anywhere here? Don't. Mu-shu dishes they in general do well and pork dishes, especially ribs, they are prone to burning. Don't ask me why, I don't know, but they seem not aware of how long to leave the pig in the oven. Stick to mostly seafood dishes. And order the mustard greens with garlic sauce, too. It's a perfect vegetable for a traditional Cantonese seafood meal. \n\n--They're in a weird place in terms of patrons: they do get tourists here off the street and they get families who have been coming for years and years, most of whom are Chinese. What they don't seem to get is many non-Chinese locals. So, the attitude of the waitstaff is either a) you speak Cantonese and we can talk fine or b) I will never see you again and you don't speak Cantonese so I'll try but have learned tourists tip poorly and that's that. I mean, I cannot speak for them, but this is my summation of what's up with the \"rude\" staff, as others have called them. Also, in Chinese restaurants the waitstaff typically is not as charming and chatty as American waitstaff. That goes for this Chinatown, most Chinatowns, and certainly China itself. Most Chinese families eat out as an extended family, so you're catching up with the aunties and all and no one has the inclination to talk much with the waiter. \n\n--Their tea is very, very, good. Excellent old-fashioned oolong tea. \n\n--It's true, they really don't like you moving the furniture around. Even a chair. Better not scoot a chair over unless it's the one you're sitting in. I think this is because everything here is old and the staff has been admonished they might (or a patron might) break something. \n\n--The quality of food can vary a lot, I'll admit. Try to come early on a weeknight and pray no one's elderly uncle is having his birthday party here and thus consuming the staff's attentions. If you're on a weeknight and early, should get good food. And it's worth trying at least once. They're not real keen on you wandering around taking photos of the interior either, but try at least to look at it for yourself. It's really a grand example of something frozen in time.", "author": "Mike W."}

So deleted that and now here's my \"real\" review for this place, the pictures are for a different review, can't seem to figure out how to delete them so please disregard pics!!\n\nWalking in Chinatown we wanted to find a hole in the wall Chinese restaurant for lunch. I loooove me some hole in the walls BUT My bad I didn't use my yelp app before walking into this place.\n\nCustomer service....let's just say there was none(until the very end). Everyone seemed like they hated being there. Decided on some dim sum for us four, nothing was good. Food was below average, bland and overpriced. \n\nAnd then.....I found a worm in our Chinese broccoli. I totally understand these things happen, especially with veggies. We were not grossed out about it but wanted to bring it to their attention. Flagged the waiter down, showed him what I found, he apologized and went back to the kitchen. Our main waiter comes out.....brace yourself folks....., instead of just apologizing he said \"it's vegetable bug, these things happen. it's not like it's a cockroach or something like that.\" \n\nWHAT THE MOTHER EFFF BS!!! He has got to be joking! Our jaws nearly hit the floor. He literally stood there for at least 3-5 mins trying to justify it in front of other patrons sitting right next to us! We couldn't believe it. He even said \"it's organic.\" Whatttt?!?!My best friends boyfriend finally had it and said \"Just say sorry and walk away!\" \n\nSo he walked away to the back. I don't know why I did what I did next but I started to pick at the leaves of the broccoli and found more worms!!!!! And that was just the second layer of leaves!!!! So now we're disgusted. It was fatter than the first one I found! EPIC FAIL OF ALL TIMES!!!\n\nWith all this said and done, the reason for my 2 stars instead of 1 is because the waiter  did finally realized he was wrong. He comped our entire bill(over $50) and came out to apologized. I definitely understand that he was not the cook or prep cook in the kitchen, but how he handled the situation was unacceptable. We appreciated him realizing his fault, still gave a $20 tip and went on with our day. Next time please just say \" sorry\". That's it, less is more!

Since we were staying at the Grand Hyatt, which is located right next to Chinatown, she wanted to grab a few pastries at Golden Gate Bakery, so we thought it would be a good idea to find a place to sit down and grab lunch in the area. \n\nWe walked by Far East Cafe and noticed a ton of people inside. I mean, why would so many people dine at a sh*tty restaurant, right? Well, our hunch was wrong and we were morbidly disappointed. \n\nSERVICE: I just can't get used to the typical Chinese restaurant ran by old school Chinese people. Far East Cafe's service is terrible. Absolutely atrocious. When we informed our server about a dead fly in my cup, he didn't say a word. No apology. Not even a nod to acknowledge how disgusting it was. He just grabbed a cup from the table next to us, sat it in front of me and zipped off. Sandy tried getting his attention several times and he just looked at her and walked away. I was like WTF? What a douche. \n\nFRIED GREEN BEANS ~ 2 stars: These were pretty terrible. I just can't understand how you can even screw these up. There wasn't any flavor, the sauce it was sitting in was pointless and the texture was all off. The worst part is that this was the best dish we had, which speaks volumes about how terrible the rest of the food was. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=-JHOvnaZ7e3mr81AXQsC4Q&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nPOTSTICKERS ~ 1 star: Terrible.

I can't even explain what it tasted like. It was sitting on top of this bed of pickled cabbage and carrots, which was also horrendous. http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gfIUvWASEROAcJ7wgrJDtA&userid=CZ36wJqV-Xit758UaOr81A\n\nHOT & SOUR SOUP ~ 3 stars: This was the ONLY thing I enjoyed at this restaurant. To be honest, it wasn't that bad at all. Yeah, I had to add a little bit of vinegar and soy sauce, but after that, it was pretty decent. I ended up downing four bowls of it, so that should say how much I liked it. I took a picture but I didn't post it only because Hot and Sour Soup is probably the least photogenic soup of all time. \n\nSo check this out - we ordered four items from their lunch menu and a small Hot & Sour Soup. Our bill came out to $38 pre-tip. ARE YOU INSANE??? If you look closely at my pictures you'll notice the servings weren't very big at all. In fact, they were small.

You might not be able to tell on the outside, but Far East has an extremely spacious second-floor. They can hold up to 64 tables= 640 guests. Which worked out for our initial guest list of 600. Fortunately, because we had picked one of the most popular dates to get married and considering that it was a holiday weekend, we were able to cut down to 46 tables. The manager is very friendly and honest, he was able to work with us on our menu which we had made quite a few changes. You cannot beat their banquet menu price listed on their website. \n\nFood: I was really worried about the quality of their food due to the bad reviews on Yelp. I spent every single day prior to my wedding checking Yelp for new reviews. When the day came, my guests were really satisfied with the portion and quality of the banquet food. The walnut prawns were plentiful, my guests claimed that they have never seen any restaurant gives so much. The sea cucumbers also received an honorable mention for its taste and texture. \n\nService: I have to take one star away for the service. Personally I did not notice anything, but probably because I was the bride. My guests did say some of the waiters were too eager to take away their plates when they weren't even done eating. The cake also took a long time to go around.\n\nJust some helpful info for anyone looking for a wedding venue, Far East has a \"No Beer\" policy, meaning you cannot bring your own for big events. You can however purchase it from them on the night of, which some of my guests did and they were fine with that. According to the manager, there has been too many incidents at the restaurant where guests drank way too much. You can still bring wine and hard liquor, but beer is just a straight no-no.

I know. You have a to live a little and take a chance sometimes.  Turns out I was pleasantly surprised. The decor was kitschy, touristy but I liked it.   Big chandeliers, lot of art, booths that were closed off entirely with a curtain...you could almost envision gangsters doing deals in there.\n\nThe food  came out in literally 2 minutes and was pretty good. I got to try the Kung Pao and General Cho's chicken which were both pretty good and came with white rice.

I've been a C-town visitor on too many visits to SF.  I've actually guest performed at one of the nightclubs there.  \n\nThere's something about hanging out in the lower Chinatown area on Grant Street with all of the tea shops, restaurants and bazaars.  I really wanted to check out my usual BBQ & dim sum joint on upper C-town along Stockton Street, but alas, da feet stopped at the Far East Cafe.  I actually used my Yelp app to find the closest restaurant on Grant that serves dim sum and FEC had decent reviews.\n\nThe host was dressed in a suit and seemed a bit perturbed that I asked if they were still serving dim sum as it was 2 PM.  He gave me their lunch/dinner menu.  I guess he didn't pick up on my desire to order dim sum.  He seated us in the center room.  I was intrigued with the side prohibition style era side rooms with curtains along the north & south walls of the cafe.  I have fond memories of other C-town restaurants and a French restaurant that had a similar design feature.  More on that later. \n\nThe waiter was spot on, took the order and proceeded to deliver multiple dishes one at a time!  The first dish was their BBQ pork, followed by the potstickers and then finally the dim sum combination platter.  All were absolutely delightful.  He then presented the beef chow fun (his favorite), Kung Pao chicken, and the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance, the Peking Duck.  Unfortunately we were 'tween lunch & dinner and they ran out of the buns.  Nonetheless, lunch was a hit.\n\nI rounded up and gave them a four star foodie experience.  They lost me with the host's demeanor upon entrance; not offering me a dim sum menu; and the trashed men's WC upstairs.  They have a co-ed WC on the main floor which I finally noticed after paying the bill.  I'll definitely be back and will definitely remember to ask for a dim sum menu  and use my WC in my hotel room before I dine here.\n\nNote to NB: be sure to ask for their dim sum menu!", "author": "Norris B."}

(This is why I gave 4 stars)\n2. Most of the waiters speak limited English and do not provide the typical American service. If you have been to authentic Asian restaurants you will understand. This is not a bad thing, in case you read this as negative. \n3. Get the Peking Duck and/or Ginger crab. It's sooo good!! \n\nLong review: The hostess is some what friendly but everyone besides the manager seem to be extremely shy. Possibly because they speak limited English. Or at least the several times I have come I have never heard them say more than a few stumbled broken English. But that is all a part of the experience. Be patient and kind. I have had a few of the dishes but the ones that stood out was the Peking duck and wet Garlic Crab. Amazing!! I have eaten duck and crab in so many places and this is my favorite! The duck comes with sauce, fresh warm buns, and green onion. Order a side of rice since it is not included. I always request a booth since the crab is very messy. It's nice to close the curtain so the rest of the restaurant doesn't need to watch me eat like the movie scene in \"Splash\". The waiters do check on you often but don't really offer much, you need to express your needs instead of them initiating the conversation. Once you give a request they are very prompt. I will continue to come to this restaurant for years to come as long as they don't change their duck and crab recipe.", "author": "Martha R."}

Location is 5/5; very easy to find in Chinatown. Atmosphere could be better; 1/5. Chandeliers are so dirty that they look like they're in a haunted house. Place in general is dirty and sticky. I didn't really mind this because I didn't experience any *personal* hygiene offenses either time I visited, but I would not be surprised to hear that people have varying experiences with this. Bathroom is gross, and there's only one that both the servers and patrons (regardless of gender) use. \n\nService--4/5. Honestly both times we were here I can't complain. Everything came out as it should have, and when we had questions they were promptly and politely attended to.\n\nFood--5/5. I went with multiple people both times I was there, and we each got a large dish to share. I like that it's family style. We had all kinds of dishes--beef, tofu, chicken, prawn, etc...all were delicious! I'm actually very surprised to read all the negative reviews here. \n\nBottom Line: This place could stand a good cleaning, and a better restroom.

The majority of restaurants like this are either demolished or closed up.  The closest comparable would be Foo's Ho Ho in terms of decor, but definitely not as fancy.  Silly as it may be, I like this decor.  This is the type of environment of Chinese restaurants that I grew up in for fancy banquets and weddings.\n\nI was here for a wedding banquet.  For those of you not familiar with this type of setting, the food is different.  Drastically different that what you would eat on a \"day to day basis\" at a Chinese restaurant.  Older generations of Chinese aka, my parents, consider this food to be \"superior\".\n\nIn all honesty, I was never a fan of this type of \"banquet\" food.  Even though I've eaten this stuff for like an eternity, I don't like it very much.  It's boring.  It's dull.   There's nothing wrong with it, but I don't care for the majority of the flavours, or lack thereof,  I don't like some of the ingredients, and I don't like some of the preparation.  The other comment I have about this is that it's expensive.  Why is it expensive?  Because it is all for show.  Conspicuous consumption , but almost nobody realizes it. It's a vicious cycle of the way it works with Chinese wedding banquets.  I'll spare you the details.\n\nIn the older Chinese generations and traditionalists mind, if it's \"expensive\", it \"must taste good\", because it is \"expensive\".  Load of crap.\n\nClassic example is shark fin soup.  Expensive as F.U.C.  Ignoring the ethical element of this, shark fin is cartilage.  There is no flavour in cartilage.  I saw a show on the Food Channel where this so called \"maitre d\" was expounding on the virtues about how a shark fin with this certain shape would make a beautiful and delicious soup.\n\nWhat an idiot.\n\nThe flavour comes from hours and hours of simmering pork and other bones to create a stock that is seasoned and thickened subsequently.  The shark fin adds texture only.  Nothing else.  It is tasteless.  Take the shark fin out of the soup, and it tastes exactly the same, minus that status symbol associated with it.  To me it tastes like a thickened broth of sorts.  I don't hate it nor I do find the taste to be anything near exhilarating nor satisfying.\n\nBack to the food.\n\nIt's OK.\n\nI'd rather eat some of the dim sum, and \"normal\" food to get a real feel of the place, but oh well.\n\nFar East, you get a neutral review.\n\nThe wedding reception itself was a whole lot of fun tho!

We seriously considered cutting our losses and beating a hasty retreat, but the Gators' game on tv in the final 4 min. held some allure for us.  we quickly ordered an assortment of dim-sum, which was the only thing they offered.  At $10, it had a sampling (usually 2 each), of some dumplings, spring roll, BBQ pork bun, siu mai, har gau and a couple of other non-descript varieties.  But compared to the crab meat soup noodle we also ordered, the dim-sum was iron-chef caliber.  This bowl of noodles did hold a few tiny pieces of crab in it, but the noodles were under-cooked, and, the soup, fishy and funny-smelling.  Plus it had absolutely no taste to it whatsoever.

This review speaks to the food served at the red egg ginger party today held on the 2nd floor.  The food was piled high on our lunch plates.  Peking spare ribs, fried chicken drumstick, chow mein, roast pig, shrimp with bok choy, and beef and broccoli.  Typical southern Cantonese style food.  Fruit punch flowing from a punch bowl and hot coffee and tea from urns.  Hubby said the coffee was terrible.\n\nDirty plates cleared immediately to the point we were afraid they were going to take our plates away the minute the forks were laid down.  The women's bathrooms look like recently remodeled, and ADA compliant; but no elevator to reach the 2nd floor.  Clean bathrooms are a huge plus in any Chinese restaurant.\n\nCarpeting on the stairs leading upstairs very old and dated.\n\nThe ground level restaurant still looks like it did when we used to come eat as kids and for large family dinners and weddings.  And the booths are still intact.", "author": "Shirley N."}

The pork dumplings were bland and full of unrendered fat and the schezuan shrimp was sugary sweet. The tea brought out at the beginning of the meal was nothing but hot water, and the waiter didn't bring us water until we asked twice. The higher points of the meal were the Hunan shrimp and chicken with mushrooms, both of which were average. I am giving this place the benefit of the doubt because I am a tourist, but I am sure there are better alternatives. Do not recommend.", "author": "Priya S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-09-07", "description": "I have to confess that I feel a bit disloyal rating Far East Cafe so highly, given that I'm more than a little bit fond of Sam Wo.  But since Sam Wo is closed for renovation, one has to get one's chow fun fix *somewhere*.  \n\nAs is our usual style, we go for cheap Chinese food after leaving our club.  We've tried a few places in Chinatown that seemed like they had the right vibe, but they all felt like a few steps down from Sam Wo in food quality and ambience.\n\nAnd then, a few weeks ago, after a few martinis, we stumbled into Far East Cafe.  The entry is not promising; equal parts glitz and grime.  And their name is instantly forgettable.  But once one gets past the bar and the hostess' station, you enter the dining room.  And then the magic kicks in.\n\nI don't know how old this place is, but the dining room is pure 1930s faded glamor.  Unbelievably ornate brass lanterns festooned with colored lightbulbs hang from the high ceilings.  Old (late-19th century?) paintings of outdoor scenes grace the walls.  There's a \"pagoda\" type screen that separates the dining room from the front of the space.  The lighting level is *perfect*.  And along the south wall is a row of private booths with curtains for privacy; the only such restaurant in Chinatown.  You want a \"Big Trouble in Little China\" fix?  Here you go.\n\nThe waitstaff is straight from Central Casting (\"wanted: Chinese waiter with unctuous manner and maroon vest\"), ubiquitous and helpful.  The tables are spaced far enough apart so that one never feels too close to the neighboring diners.  And the chow fun?  Let's just say that it's the best that I've ever had.  And that's saying something.  \n\nAgain -- no disloyalty to Sam Wo who turn out a tasty, greasy chow fun for just $4.50.  But Far East Cafe's $8.25 chow fun is thinner, less oily, and with excellent wok-hei; that characteristic of noodles that get caramelized from having been tossed in a really hot wok.  The seasoning is flawless and the broccoli that I always order with chow fun is perfectly cooked.  \n\nTonight we tried Far East Cafe again and it proved that our previous experience was no fluke.  Yeah, it's unlikely that we'll ever be on first-name basis with the wait staff, but that's OK.  The faded charm of the decor and the excellence of the food more than make up for it.  \n\nIf you have an appreciation for vintage decor from the \"mysterious Orient\" of the mid-century and earlier (think Tretchikoff paintings, Marwal busts, Les Baxter and Martin Denny, \"The World of Suzy Wong\", etc.), this is one of the few places in town that still retains it.  I'd come here even if the food and service was crap, just to soak up the mood.  That the food and service are quite good cinches the deal for me.", "author": "Curran H."}

Between the completely disgusting fish tank in the front, the piles of dust caked on the wooden chandeliers or the cheep Chinese paper wall decorations that were just taped on the wall I'm not sure why we stayed. The food is okay to good depending on what you get with fine prices but the service is not very good. Our waiter only came to our table twice for a drink and then food order and we never saw him again. So overall the experience is is not very good and we were bummed we even went when right down the street a couple blocks was a revolving sushi bar where the sushi revolves on little wooden boats on water that goes around the restaurant! Which looked like an awesome experience so I would recommend that cool sushi restaurant a block or two down and not this place.", "author": "Elizabeth K."}

The dumpling skins were far too thick and doughy, definitely not cooked long enough.  The meat fillings were just off tasting, and sometimes under-cooked.  One of the things that warned me not to come in was the fact that the dining area was empty when I arrived--never a good sign for a dim sum place in the middle of Chinatown during lunch time.  The only thing that was ok were the vegetable dishes, because they don't require as much skill and technique to prepare as the other dim sum dishes.  I was definitely severely disappointed and lost my appetite coming here.  I've been to a lot of good dim sum places, some of them in San Francisco, but this was not one of those places.  The only possible saving grace this place could've had was in their service, but even with an empty room, good service wasn't there.  Never coming back.", "author": "Christine W."}

To be completely honest, I wasn't expecting much, cause usually when I see a really nicely decorated Chinese restaurant, I'm ready for mediocre food (hey, it's been a pretty good rule of thumb thus far!).

Got there 10 minutes before closing but they sat us at a table anyway, with a reminder that we needed to order quickly because the kitchen was closing in ten minutes. Several servers interacted with us when we first sat down and it was unclear who our server was until after we placed our order. Our server was a little strange and seemed like we were bothering him. Towards the end of the meal we needed more soda but our server was seated with the rest of the staff eating so we had to ask the hostess to get it (she was actually very nice). I got scallops with bok choy which tasted very average and looked like it had been sitting around for a loooooong time. The scallops were plentiful but tasteless. My friend had chicken curry which also was very average. Both plates were expensive and didn't come with rice. Rice was a la carte and we were reminded of that fact several times during the meal. The restaurant is obviously very old. It is dirty and dilapidated and needs a thorough cleaning. It appears that no one really cares about this place and the owner has given up.

I think I've had plenty of bad experiences but this one has got to be one of.. if not THE worst place I've been to. Everything from the food quality, the service, the price, the cleanliness and the after effects once I got home were BAD!\n\nWe spent the day shopping in China Town and were ready for dinner. I probably should have yelped this place before coming in but just went with it since my inlaws insisted on trying it. The place was empty except for a big party upstairs. This should have been my first clue! We were then seated in one of the private booths with a curtain that closes off the booth which was crammed.  To summarize, since there were 5 of us we opted for the \"Far East Dinner\". It was priced at $19.95 per person and had a preset menu that listed what you would get. I felt it was quite pricey to charge 20 a person for something that was not buffet style and would be individual plates but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. BIG MISTAKE. \n\nWhat was included in the Far East Dinner was:\nFried Prawns & Barbecued Spareribs\nHot and Sour Soup\nPrawns with Honey Walnut\nBeef with Mixed Vegetables\nYang Chow Fried Rice\nTea & Fortune Cookie\n\n4-5 persons add:\nKung Pao Chicken\n\nNow to the bad things...\n\n1) First waitress was very rude and dismissive. Plopped down some worn out menus and left without a single word.\n2) When tea was served there was a faint lipstick smear on my cup.\n3) My plate had dried pieces of whatever was previously on it that I had to scrape off.\n4) Second waiter came in and when we told him we wanted to sub out the Kung Pao Chicken for Mushroom Chicken due to some of our guests having acid reflux issues, the guy kept pushing the Kung Pao Chicken and stating it was not spicy. He finally gave in and said \"just this one time\".\n5) Food did not come for a good 30 minutes after he left.\n6) Hot and Sour Soup, BBQ spareribs and Fried prawns finally came. Soup was extremely spicy (we already explained the situation with Kung Pao Chicken and he didn't mention that this soup was really spicy). Tasted like there were multiple mashed chilies in it. It was also really salty. BBQ spareribs were extremely hard and mostly gristle with a layer of FAT. Fried prawns looked like they came out of a bag that you buy from Costco and were just heated up in the oven. (No sauce was served with prawns... usually other places give you sweet and sour sauce or hot mustard with fried prawns).\n7) Drinks were never offered other than tea. We had to practically flag down the first waiter to get soda. When we went around the table to say what we wanted she looked super annoyed and had trouble keeping up with our 5 drinks (3 cokes and 2 sprites.. how hard is that to remember?)\n8) We also ordered a side of pot stickers... gross... wrapper was thick and doughy. Filling had a bad after taste (think cabbage but in a bad way).\n9) The second waiter came back and started collecting up emptied dishes while people were still in the middle of eating. (i.e. when I was still eating the guy reached over me to grab the next plate).\n10) When my sister in law tried to give him her plate he looked like he was about to swat her hand and then yelled \"NO NO NO I do it!!!\" I mean how DARE she politely hand her empty plate to him?\n11) Since my brother in law was the only one who could stomach the hot and sour soup and was clearly still slurping it up, the waiter dumped whatever was left over in his bowl while he was mid slurp.. didn't even ask if he wanted more.. surprised he didn't jam the ladle in his mouth!\n12) He zipped outta there and we waited another 30 minutes till the Mushroom Chicken, Walnut Shrimp, Beef with Vegetables and Fried Rice came.\n13) Walnut Shrimp: Looked exactly like the breaded fried prawns we received earlier but smothered in overly sweet thick syrupy sauce. Walnuts tasted weird like they were old.\n14) Beef with vegetables: Where's the Beef?? All vegetables.. and what beef was there was hard and chewy\n15) Mushroom chicken: the only decent dish but again all vegetables and no meat!\n16) Fried Rice came last (Um... I like eating my food WITH the rice thank you). There were dried pieces of rice in it but otherwise was just OK.\n17) Refills on the drinks: Waiter practically scolded us by saying \"NO REFILLS!\" Um can we at least pay for a second drink instead of you walking away?\n18) TO TOP IT OFF: the bill..... $150 dollars... believe me my jaw literally dropped. For the CRAP quality of this food $150 is a freaking joke! Thank God my sister in law dropped the cash for this. She probably should have made sure there weren't any extra charges (I couldnt read the chinese on  the check to break down the bill but i'm guessing there was added gratuity and who knows what else?)\n19) Finally when I came home I was treated to a hefty dose of diarrhea (and so did a few others that were with us).\n\nAll in all avoid this place at all costs.

The dark wood, high ceilings and closed off booths on the side are what I'd imagine Chinatown in San Francisco was like many decades ago.  It feels like there should be a hidden opium den available to locals \"in the know\".\n\nWhat we ordered:\n\nShredded Dry Scallop Soup - average.  I liked the amount of shredded scallop but the taste was lacking.  Bland.\n\nSeafood Chow Fun - below average.  They skimped on the noodles and it was mostly bean sprouts.  Fair amount of seafood (shrimp, scallops, squid) however was also bland.  Needed to ask for hot sauce to give it some taste.\n\nSalted Cabbage with Stewed Pork Clay Pot - above average.  I would recommend this dish and thought it was tasty and would order it again.  It is pork belly (reminded me of pork belly I often get at Korean bbq) in thick slices over a tasty cabbage stew.  Needed to order a side of rice to absorb the stew.  Pretty yummy.\n\nIt was just an uneven experience with some good and some really ordinary parts.", "author": "Michael S."}

We didn't realize that this was the weekend of the flower market before Chinese New Year though, so OMG was it every packed!  An estimated 400,000 people attend the 2-day flower market, I swear at least 350,000 of them were there Saturday afternoon! Heh.  \n\nSo anyway, we walked up from the Powell Street BART station and then checked our phones for somewhere to get a late lunch - whereupon the challenge was finding somewhere both open and not too busy.  We decided to give the Far East Cafe a try. None of us had heard of it, but I liked the name, it was closeby, it was open, and they could seat us right away.\n\nIn the end that was most of the positives used up before we sat down.  I really found the rest of the experience rather mediocre.  The ambiance has the potential to be cool, with the little curtained nooks and the huge lanterns hanging from the ceiling - but in honesty it has the feeling of somewhere that was posh and amazing once upon a time but is now waiting for the Jellical Moon so it can get a chance at a new Jellical Life (sorry - just saw CATS and it's sort of stuck with me!)  The place is shabby and tired looking.\n\nThe food was pricey and I didn't find it all that stellar.  We had chicken and corn soup that was bland and rather tasteless, spring rolls that were cold in the middle (not frozen, but cold), and while I didn't try the spicy beef dish, it looked greasy and unappealing.  The service was lackluster - our waiter seemed rather put out that we didn't order a lot more food (he told us that the amount of food we bought would not serve three people - when in fact it was more than enough), he reached across people to put things down on the table rather than going around the other side, and took FOREVER in bringing us the bill so we could get back to exploring.  Oh, and the fortune cookies tasted weird - which I think was the most disappointing part for me (maybe I'm just weird that way).", "author": "Ailsa B."}

This consisted of egg drop soup, two egg rolls, fried rice, duck, and beef and broccoli. The egg drop soup and beef and broccoli were acceptable, nothing special but at least 3-star worthy. The egg roll was pretty delicious but it was tiny and there was only one per person. The fried rice was stale, so we asked for some white rice as well. It took us at least three minutes with my arm up to get a waiter's attention. And insult to injury, the extra bowls of rice was tacked on to the bill. This is also something I am not used to at most Chinese restaurants. The duck was extremely oily like it was soaked at the bottom of a tub and was put directly onto a plate and served to us. I had to go through two cups of water to wash everything down. I assume I won't have to go into detail about my wait getting a refill.\n\nI would have given this place one lone star had it not been for the fact that I got here shortly past 9:30PM and they closed at 10:00PM.

But I digress ...probably because it pains me to admit that the place is really mediocre. I doubt if my palate could tell what was good Cantonese food when I was six, but at fo-o-o....well, more than six...I think I can tell you this is just not a great dining destination. \n\nSure, they have the private booths where they squeeze 12 people around a table for six. Sure, they have decorative lanterns above. Sure, they have the lazy susans at their banquet tables. But Jamie really wanted almond chicken, Michigan-style, and I Googled to find that Far East cafe serves almond chicken. Alas, not even close to his expectations. He was wanting something deep-fried with almond slivers and some gloppy, yellow sauce on top. What they serve here is diced chicken mixed with almond bits like a cashew chicken with an unappetizing-looking sauce. And all for $ 11.50. \n\nI actually ordered Steamed Chicken with Scallions which comes with a minced garlic sauce. It's a deceptively simple dish that's ordered only by grandmas from the old country and me. Still, it tasted wrong somehow (Hunan Homes is still the only one in Chinatown that does this dish justice). And yes, you guessed it...$11.50. To add to our disappointment, we were seated in between two large banquet tables that were leaning over us to shoot videos and pass the deep-fried crab.

I looked on their website beforehand and looked at the menu for such an occasion and was prepared for mediocre food to be served. I didn't really expect much at all.\n\nWhen I arrived, I was directed to the large hall where this event was being held. This is also where elderly Chinese couples come to ballroom dance each week I'm told. There is a dance floor and it looks like one of those large rooms where Chinese wedding banquets are held. In fact, there are those big well wishing words aligned on the back wall for such occasions. They didn't even change them for the baby's celebration.\n\nIt was kinda chaotic. There must've been more than 200 people there all scrambling to take a look at the baby and then rushing over to stand in line to get the food at the buffet. I was waiting for a friend to arrive so I watched as people brought their plates of food piled high to the tables and started to devour. I felt like I was in a Wayne Wang movie. It was kinda surreal.\n\nIt was the same things on each plate: roast pork, chow mein, bok choy with shrimp, beef broccoli, deep fried chicken drumstick, eggroll, Peking short ribs and of course, the ubiquitous red egg. \n\nWhen my friend arrived, we went to grab some food. I must say, it was kinda like eating Panda Express. Not surprisingly, I enjoyed the red egg the most. After all it was just a plain boiled egg dyed red. Unfortunately when I went back to grab another one there were none left.\n\nI think Far East is the only place in Chinatown to cater to such a celebration and that's why it's a monopoly and they can get away with serving this sort of food. There was also a fruit punch fountain (I wish I had taken a photo of that -- it was classic in a bad way) which spewed fruit punch out in a weird way. I guess you had to be there.\n\nHaving said all this negative stuff I did have one encounter with one of the servers at the buffet line which was hilarious. I went back for more veggies -- broccoli and bok choy -- I told the man in Cantonese I only wanted a little of each. He piled my plate high. When I started to stop him his response was \"veggies are good for you, eat more\". HAHA. Okay mister! \n\nHe made me laugh and for that they get an extra star.", "author": "Anita L."}

The food came out quickly and smelled great. To the eye, everything looked great. However, to me, the eggdrop soup was pretty bland/plain and the garlic chicken was not evenly heated. I don't understand how parts of the dish can be cold while other parts are steaming hot? Not sure how that happened, but it did for me at least. Another thing that kind of irked me was that the wait staff did not check on our table after we were served our food. This may be petty, but as a former server, I always made it a point to follow up with customers to make sure everything was meeting/exceeding their expectations.\n\nAll in all, Far East Cafe accomplished its job of supplying Chinese food for me and my friend to consume and energy to continue our trek through Chinatown.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-07-08", "description": "The best thing about the Far East Cafe is its old world history, decor and setting. It has been here in Chinatown for over 90 years! \n\nIt has beautiful ornate ceiling detail work, with huge red Chinese lanterns hanging from the high ceilings, and dark wood private booths all along one side of the restaurant. It is more like a set of an Agatha Christie book or movie than simply a place in Chinatown to eat Cantonese food. And that is what they specialize in, Cantonese food. \n\n90 years ago, when this first opened, Chinese in America were mostly from poor and mostly from southern Canton regions of China, and came over in the 1850s - 1900s to work on the transcontinental railroads here, or the sugar farms in Hawaii. They were given the jobs to load dynamite in the mountain sides when the railroad tracks were being cut through the Sierra Nevadas, and many died building that railroad. After that, many opened restaurants and laundries to try to earn a living. When many would work for cheap at manual jobs nobody else wanted, there was a huge backlash, epecially during the depression of the 1890's from the Caucasians. (Does this sound familiar to today? Latin American immigrants perhaps?) They were called \"The Yellow Peril\". \n\nSo California passed a law, called the Chinese Exclusionary Act, which made it illegal for Chinese to own land, become a citizen, or basically have any equal rights. It was even illegal to have a certain hair style that was culturally popular (long pony tails). That is why China Camp in Marin was so named, because the Chinese men who had no work lived there off the land and fished the bay waters for food. That is also why many Chinese who came over belonged to the Community Associations (aka Tongs), as these extended families had to take care of their own and help each other out (they still exist today, often dens for Mah Jhong). That is also why Chinatown was a ghetto of Chinese crammed in a very small area of San Francisco. That is also why on Angel Island there was a rentention center for Chinese immigrants, where they would be interrogated, and often held for long periods of time and/or deported.\n\nIt wasn't until the 1940's, when Japan was at war with China and China asked the US for help, and after Pearl Harbor that America finally repealed the Chinese Exclusionary Act of the 1890s! But that is when we took all the Japanese, rounded them up with Presidential Executive Order 9055  and Interned them (many being American Citizens) into concentration camps in the desert, where most lost all of their livelyhood, businesses and possessions. No due process, just racism. (Does this sound familiar to post 911?) \n\nSo this is part of the backdrop of this restaurant, a Chinatown landmark for nearly a hundred years. The food is OK, and not necessarily that cheap. It sort of has a proud heritage that it holds onto, with waiters in black and white attire, now serving mostly Caucasians who are mostly tourists who come to Chinatown to buy cheap trinkets and momentos, and discover the mysterious Oriental fantasies and images played out in old American stereotypical movies. \n\nOnly now, the Chinese can own the land and shops that they work so hard to get and maintain, so generations of their off spring can attend the finest Universities in the country, to have a better life than their ancestors. \n\nSo if you want to know why UC Berkeley is 42% Asian and the largest ethnic group at that prestigious institution, or 60% of the med students at UCSD are Asian, this brief history will give you some perspective.", "author": "Wanugee N."}

The service was across the street at the Old St Mary's Church so it was a convenient walk to the restaurant. We filled the whole floor and and there were not enough tables to accommodate our group. However, the waiter was kind enough to open up a side section to allow for the overflow. Just then in front of everyone the manger started to yell at the waiter in Chinese, \"I told you not to open that section!\" It was abusive and unnecessary. \n\nAt the end of the so so meal we asked for some take home boxes and a bag. They said they did not have any bags and if we wanted a bag they would charge us a $1.00. WTF!! So we carried our take out boxes without a bag. As we walked out we thought we give it a shot and ask the hostess in front for a  bag. She said, \"No bags, one dollar.\" My friend saw a stack of paper bags in front and took a couple for our takeouts not thinking they would charge us $1.00 for a paper bag after we filled their restaurant with a big lunch crowd. They didn't ask us for a $1.00 but the hostess did hide the bags behind the podium and told the waiter in Chinese not to give out any bags until the diners are charge $1.00.

We're a smart bunch.\n\nWe decided on Far East Cafe because it was the restaurant we happened to be near when my son decided that he has to GO POTTY NOW.  I respond to little kids' potty demands like a marine to his drill sargeant.  Sir, yes sir.  I know the consequences if I don't.  \n\nThe restaurant is large and cavernous and reminiscent of a bygone era so I was hopeful.  I noticed that the menu while extensive is really pricey for Chinese food but I was hungry and grateful to be away from the parade crowd.  \n\nThen things started to go down hill.\n\nThe service was slow.  It took 30 minutes for our appetizers to arrive.  Then another 45 minutes and nothing.  And the server was no where to be found.  By this time, everyone is hungry and grumpy.  When I ask our server what happened to our food, he said the kitchen is extremely busy because of a large party upstairs and just walked away.  It was only when I tracked him down to tell him that we are leaving did he beg us to give him another 2 minutes.  Immediately, our food started to arrive.  Most dishes were cold and tasted mediocre at best.  Actually, the food sucked all around.  As hungry as we all were, there were a lot of leftovers.  We did not take any of it home.  \n\nEven if the service hadn't sucked (it sucked big time), I cannot recommend this restaurant based on the food.  There are too many other restaurants within a few blocks where you can get much better food at half the price.", "author": "mia s."}

This place is much ritzier looking than New Asia, and I didn't feel like I needed to use antiseptic wipe to clean off my plates and glassware.  The decor is a little nicer in the banquet room, which is quite large with a nice-sized dance floor in the center with karaoke capabilities.  There is also a plethora of TV's and screens so that you can always get a view of either the person karaoking or the karaoke video itself (usually featuring a scantily clad Asian woman lounging against a waterfall or some other insipid scene).\n\nThe banquet menu was pretty good.  It started off with the cold appetizer platter, then moved on to soup, prawns with cashews, crispy whole chicken, pork belly with preserved vegetables, a beef dish, mushrooms with mustard greens, and finally, deep-fried fish fillet in a creamed corn-egg drop sauce.  The last dish sounds strange and doesn't seem very Chinese at all, but it was delicious.  Everyone at the table kept saying that it was strange, but good and we had to ask for extra rice to go along with it.  We polished that dish off, even though we were stuffed from all the other food we had had before.  The crispy whole chicken was moist and flavorful and the pork belly, while very fatty, was delicious.  Nothing like slabs of fat and meat to make my family wolf down their rice.\n\nOverall, a very clean Chinese restaurant where the food was quite good.  I didn't feel grossed out going to the bathroom and the service was actually quite good, considering how busy the waiters were trying to serve 30 tables at a single time.

Both the beef and the chicken had the texture of super soft something, as if they had been soaked in baking soda or been pounded to a very weak consistency. I prefer the natural chewiness of meat and poultry. Overall the dishes were both very bland and generic, as was the complementary tea.

I was kind of skeptical about this restaurant because it looked kind of dirty on the outside. We decided on this restaurant since my aunt had tried it beforehand and was tired of looking around for other restaurants to eat in the area. \n\nWe came in and we were greeted immediately and got seated quickly too. The restaurant was pretty big and wasn't too crowded. I noticed that there were little private rooms to the side that were covered with curtains where guests could choose to dine in. The servers here were pretty friendly compared to most Chinese restaurants that I've been to. When I was looking at the menu on the outside of the restaurant  there were pictures of dim sum dishes. As I looked through the menu inside of the restaurant, there was only 1 page of the menu which was dim sum, and it only had about 5 pictures of the dim sum dishes they served. I was quite disappointed because I thought it was a dim sum restaurant. Anyways, as I continued to look through the menu, I became very uninterested in the food. I decided to look at the lunch menu and came across the Seafood Chow Mein. I thought this was a safe choice, so I ordered it. \n\nThe food came out fairly quick and my portion was decent. My noodles were mediocre and there wasn't much seafood. My aunt ordered a dish of peking duck, which was VERY expensive and tasted gamey. I got to try some of my cousin's Yang Chow Fried Rice, and it was the tastiest thing out of those three dishes. \n\nOur bill was pretty pricey considering we all ordered from the lunch menu.

This was on Easter Sunday night (2009) and it wasn't too crowded.  Every serve who walked by wouldn't hesitate to stop at our table to complete our order, ask if we needed anything, gather our used plates, take the check, etc.  They were not constrained by the fact we weren't at his/her table.  That was nice.  Also, the main dining room is kinda cool.  It has these large tables separated by walls and curtains on the left for larger groups.  I've eaten in one of them before and it was a nice cozy way to dine, even for a business meal.  The rest of the dining room is spartan, but the lighting is very cool (see some of the pictures) and the atmosphere reminds of a bygone era before every restaurant tried for a jazz lounge look.\n\nCONS:  The food was average at best.  I had pot sticker appetizer, and it was a huge portion and very tasty.  I had cashew chicken meal, and it was lifeless and bland.  The Mongolian beef was similar, and had kind of a slimy texture.  I had been here a few years ago and had much better food.  The appetizers are too big (serving 2-3) to be ordered individually, or even for a table of 2.  \nActually the worst part of the experience, which colored the entire rest of the visit, was the trip past the kitchen, upstairs to the restroom.  It was beyond disgusting.  The stairs going upstairs to the restroom were originally (about 500 years ago) burgundy, but they had worn down to white surrounded by what looked like black mold.  Worse yet, they were actually wet and sticky, as if a dynasty's worth of won ton soup had been spilled on them and just sat there.  My foot made that spongy sound when walking on the carpet and it was sticky too.  I'm so glad that I went there at the end of the meal rather than at the beginning, as it definitely will ruin the appetite.  I did not notice anything patently and specifically unclean in the kitchen on the way back, but its spartan accommodations do not inspire any confidence in the hygiene being practiced there.\n\nThe meal was also too expensive for all of the foregoing reasons.  I had been there for a business lunch years ago and had a good experience.  Not sure what's changed (or maybe I didn't explore the restaurant last time) but it's definitely time to find a new Chinatown spot.", "author": "Mark A."}

The first item that was served was the cold appetizer plate consisting of jelly fish, bbq pork, etc.  This was followed byshark fin soup, sweet and sour spare ribs, fried chicken (with an excellent sauce), veggies with mushroom, shrimp with cashews, and fish.  All the dishes were prepared very well and seasoned perfectly.  The only one that was kinda bland was the shrimp with cashews - I didn't care for that too much.  My favorite dish was the deep fried fish fillets covered with a clear white egg gravy of some sort, with some carrots and peas.  It kinda looked and tasted like a super thick version of egg drop soup.  It was spectacular and our table had to ask for extra rice to eat with this dish, it was that good!  Although this was the last item to be served and we were all completely stuffed, we managed to inhale it - we didn't leave a drop of sauce on the plate! =)  \n\nService was great!  The waiters were always around to refillour tea, bring us more rice, and even serve us extra slices of cake (it was delish)!

The sea bass tasted like it was rotten and the spicy seasoning was basically pepper and rock salt and something that was so funky we tasted it for the rest of the day even though we each only had 1 bite.  The prawns had some kind of thick sauce that stuck to the prawns like glue and was so sweet it was intolerable.  I asked for a glass of water when we sat down and it never came.  The prices were high and cost us $60 for one of the worst meals I've ever had.

The sweet and sour pork is great and even though spring rolls are hard to screw up, they are always delicious.  I am absolutely perplexed by some of the poor reviews.

The noodles itself were good but not worth the price and not big enough to fill up two people. Search elsewhere, I'm sure there are better places out there.", "author": "Nadine B."}

It is better to go with someone who knows what to order and understands authentic Chinese food.  Don't order the typical American-style Chinese food  like sweet and sour .., chow men, fried rice, Kung Pao ..", "author": "Ken V."}

I thought it was going to be small, but it was okay to accommodate 200 something people and probably could fit more. The food is just okay for me. It's so greasy although I like their sweet and sour ribs. The place has a private/ VIP room on the second floor in the back, which looks pretty cozy. It's definitely can accommodate lots of people, but the food could be better!", "author": "Daisy S."}

Salt and pepper shrimp were yummy as were the chicken wings. Both were generous portions and very reasonably priced. We were sorry to hear that they would be closed to the general public in the upcoming days of our stay due to several large parties. Service was outstanding, very attentive and our host gave us interesting insights into Chinese culture. .", "author": "Kris M."}

But no more - the food was terrible and the service worse today. We ordered mu shu chicken but could not find ONE piece of chicken in it; the pancakes were dry and almost inedible. The two other dishes were also extremely light on the protein and high on the filler, and neither one was even as good as you might expect from a cheap franchise place on Powell or worse. So disappointed in the whole experience.", "author": "Paige W."}

I wish the prawns were on the bigger size and fresh not frozen. Prices are very reasonable. Good selection. The food is good. Not memorable but good. The server was somehow not interested in giving suggestions...that's a shame. Overall, I would not return based on all the other choices in the area..", "author": "Chris A."}

Listen, if you are a tourist it can't get much better than this restaurant for authentic San Francisco Chinatown culture.  Don't go there to eat strictly speaking, but if you do, you'll be fine.  Go there and sit in one of the booths, get a Gin'nTonic and feel like you are back in time and that an earthquake may happen any moment.  Seriously a great place to impress a first date.  There are some ceiling lights that are classic, they must have been there since like 1849.  Don't go there trying to be a foodie or get all worked up over the fact that they are actually suppose to be a restaurant, that's beside the point really.  My family gave my son a Red Egg Party there, and it was the bomb.  True the food sucks, get over it, you can get better food anywhere practically, but why do you think they stay in business? because the place is awesomely Chinatown that's why. OH, and here's some advice from someone who knows the game.  If you act all picky and fussy and don't look happy, you are going to get treated like the turp you are for being out on the town and whining.  They don't need your stupid business they are an icon and are probably richer than you.", "author": "Sarah H."}

Ok, none of that actually happens anymore but if it did, this is the place that has the right look for it.  Ask for a booth so you can close the curtains (there are little buttons inside but I don't know if they actually work or not).  Food isn't anything to write home about and I wouldn't recommend going just for the food, but the wonton chicken soup is pretty good and I guess everything else I've eaten here was passable if unmemorable.  I've been 5 or more times but can't remember any of the food we've ordered (except the wonton soup).  It's right in Chinatown so parking would be a problem but we always take public transit and walk the few blocks up to Ctown.", "author": "Kai T."}
