I used to have a tradition of visiting a bakery every Sunday.  I watch what I eat during the week, but on weekends all bets are off.  And Sunday was bakery day.  Order a smorgasbord of goodies, & just go to town.  What bakery?  I hit them all.  Miette, Kara's, That Takes The Cake, Cups & Cake, Sweet Things, Tartine, Boulange (all of them), Noe, John Campbell's, Arizmendi, Schubert's...they were all a part of my rotation.  They each have things that they do better than others; they're all stars in their own right.  I will leave their specific details for further reviews.  But Delessio's?  I could never forget Delessio's.  \n\nWhen I hear Delessio's, I think of 3 things...\n\nTres leches cake.  I drool.\n\nChocolate bubble wrap.  Yes, chocolate bubble wrap.  And yes.  It's even cooler than it sounds.  You can order it by the slice, pound, or in major bulk for parties or events.  \n\nAnd my favorite...The Rabanada.  A Brazilian specialty.  Bread soaked in a sublime custard mixture & then fried, & then covered in cinnamon sugar.  This is SINFULLY good.  One bite & I'm flooded w bliss, guilt, & regret.  But bliss always wins.  I'm perfectly aware of how bad this is for me, & I just don't give a damn.  I can always just double my treadmill time for a couple of days.  Happily so.  It's that good.  \n\nIt takes your coffee or tea to a different dimension. \n\nBtw, they have great food too.  The honey teriyaki style chicken is fabulous.

Convenient, fast and pretty tasty (like a date with me would be ;). \n\nI've been going to the one on Broderick since it opened with Falletti Foods.  I used to go there 3-4 times a week, either to pick up dinner, lunch, or a shopper. (just kidding)\nNow, I go once a week max.

Thai chicken, pork stew, ribs, limp fries, etc. If I want boring, I'll do the cooking. \nThe sweet goodies look better than they taste, no it 's true, try it. Their overly sweet lemon meringue pie will not only pucker your face but your wallet too.  The Fresh Cream on top of these pies is not cream at all, but a topping loaded with stabilizers for a long shelf life. Tastes like a bland shaving cream, yes I've tried it. \n\nThe Tres Leches is very good, and so is the ice cream, actually it is delicious.\n\nI do have a concern with food safety at Delessio. A few months back, a guy was cleaning the grill with a dirty wet towel and no gloves. I asked for a hot Panini. He turned around and started working on my sandwich. He did NOT wash his hands nor did he put on gloves, very dangerous behavior. I politely pointed this out to him and he appeared confused by my request to wash his hands/and or put on gloves.

If I want to get some nasty food illness, I'll scratch my own ass as I prepare dinner, thanks very much.\n\nThe temperature of the food is always barely warm, not hot. This is a safety hazard.\n\nI have seen employees, even from the bakery side, walk by the hot food and salad bar and snap up a French fry or tomato without using the utensils provided, just bare hands.

After perusing all the different desserts, I went for the bread pudding and my boyfriend went for the tres leches cake. We also picked up a pint of vanilla ice cream, which went perfectly with my bread pudding.\n\nThe bread pudding was great - it was filled with cranberries and chunks of chocolate (tastes better if you heat it up a bit!). The tres leches cake was way too sweet for my taste and the frosting on top was overwhelming. \n\nI think Delessio has a bunch of yummy options for dessert, and also for takeout, but it was a little pricey. $4.25/slice of tres leches cake and $3.50/slice for the bread pudding.

This is the upper range of what I'm willing to spend on lunch, but I did it because I loved the variety and found the dishes tasty.\n\nBut just a few days ago, I walked into the Market/Valencia St. location and saw that they have suddenly upped the price to $12.50 lb!!!!  They are claiming that this is because they've converted all their food to locally grown and farmed.  Looking around the buffet, the same dishes as always greeted my eyes, except when I tasted my lunch (which rang up at almost $16!!!  I used to pay only about $10-11), it was dried out, overcooked, and told me right off the bat that it'd been sitting around a long time on that buffet.\n\nSo, in case my writing's been convoluted and you haven't been able to follow, I'm saying that I just paid a LOT more money for something that tasted far INFERIOR to what I used to get here.\n\nUgh.\n\nI'm so mad.  And I'm apparently not alone.  I complained about the price hike to the guy who rang me up, and he rolled his eyes and said that they were losing a lot of customers because of it, I wasn't the first to complain by any stretch of the imagination!  I'm glad to know that the rest of the world hasn't lost its mind and decided that it's reasonable to pay much more for the same thing, or as it happens to be, something of lower discernible quality!!!\n\nDelessio, what were you thinking?!!  Do you WANT to go out of business??   Have you NOTICED that there's a recession going on around you, and possibly even a financial depression???\n\nI for one won't be giving Delessio my business anymore.

It was out in the open amongst all the germs and creepy SF people who like to touch food, taste it, then put it back.

The cake was practically disintegrating under the syrup.  The syrup was much too sticky.  It was a syrup rather than a milk mixture.  It was really really sweet.  And to ruin a bad thing, the whole cake was topped off with a huge dollop of seven minute frosting (aka marshmallow frosting).

Or maybe it's just me and I can't tell where Delessio ends and Falletti Foods market begins. I came here for dessert hopping to try some pastries and had to take them to-go since there is very limited seating - not enough for a party of ten people. I got two of every mini cupcake to share with my friends. Each of the cupcakes were beautiful and stacked with creamy frosting and dreamy toppings. We tried the salted caramel, orange creamsicle, boston cream pie, red velvet, peanut butter chocolate. and something else that was scarfed down by others too quickly for me to sneak in a bite. Everyone loved the mini cupcakes and craved more! I'll have to come back again to enjoy a round of mini cupcakes for myself! They also serve Humphry Slocombe ice cream but none of the exciting new flavors, but still good for pairing with the rich cakes. I also stole a big bite of my friend's Brazilian french toast which was unexpectedly moist and deliciously airy and covered in a sweet glaze and powdered sugar.

Contrary to other reviewers, the bread (a thin foccacia) was not soggy.  The sandwich was perfectly constructed.  Let me explain.\n\n(1) Bread was thin and chewy.  A lot of places give you too much bread or bread that's too thick.  The proportion of fillings to bread is very important.  They understand this.\n(2) Flavors meld.  I had their roast beef sandwich too.  I get the feeling that they've given a lot of thought to providing the right cheese and condiments.  With the meatloaf sandwich, the cheese is mild and the tomato sauce is tangy.  There isn't too much mayo.  The fresh basil is such a nice touch.\n(3) Quality ingredients.  Fresh basil.  Moist meatloaf, thickly sliced.\n(4) Height of sandwich is manageable.  It's tall enough that you have to open wide but not so tall that it's impossible to bite into.\n(5) Construction holds up.  The sandwich does not drip or fall apart.\n\nThe vanilla creamsicle mini cupcake was a perfect dessert.\n\nAlso, their brisket is out of this world.

My total came to $28 for the equivalent of dinner for 2 for 2 nights (including a little bit of leftover salad I had at home).

MY favorite thing there is the butterscotch pudding.  *THUD* I died.  That's how good it is.  I kid you not.  They also have a butterscotch bar that's made from something like sweet potatoes, I believe?  It's been a while.  It's heavenly.  Tastes 85% like butterscotch and 15% sweet potato.  And you feel slightly less guilty about eating it.  At least I did.  The hot food deli there is also very, very good.  I am the lady that takes all of the garlic roasted potatoes.  It's me.  I sit there and wait forever for them to be done, and then I take most of them.  Probably not very polite.  \n\nI like the mini-cupcakes, yes, but sometimes they can be a tad dry.  And something so teeny shouldn't be so busy.  You know. They'll have a banana caramel white chocolate mini cupcake with sea salt on top (I made that up, but you get the idea) and it's simply too much for a teeny cake.

The flavors rotate seasonally and the available selection varies from day to day, but most are extremely delicious.  The standout flavors include their mint-chocolate (rich flourless chocolate cake base with peppermint buttercream frosting dipped in chocolate ganache), and the ginger-cranberry (gingerbread base with cranberry preserves/jam topped with orange buttercream).  If you see either of these, GET THEM.  The peanut butter and jelly flavor looks enticing, and I find that they generally do a good job with flavors incorporating jams/preserves, I just haven't tried it since I hate peanuts.  Occasionally a flavor is a bit unremarkable, for example, I would like to recommended the pancake cupcake, but alas I can't; the maple buttercream with bacon bits on top is tasty, but the cupcake base is bland and dry. The smore flavor was visually pleasing but similarly underwhelming in flavor; the chocolate piece decorating the frosting is too thick to bite into with the cupcake, and the flavor lacks overall depth. Generally speaking try one (or two) of their cupcakes (with the exception of the smore and pancake flavors) on offer and you won't be disappointed.\n\nThe bubble-wrap chocolate is also worth trying, it's essentially a chocolate bark, made with exceptional chocolate (Valhrona I believe, or maybe it was Callebaut) molded on a piece of bubble wrap (or more likely a mold shaped like bubble wrap) and then topped with novel flavors.  My favorites are the milk chocolate with cinnamon sugar and slivered almonds, and the dark chocolate with malt powder.   Again, it's no surprise that these run on the pricey side, but I find that they are more than worth it.  They seem to no longer offer these in a make your own assortment fashion, you have to buy the pre-packaged bag which has a variety of flavors including white-chocolate (ew), but I still think they'd make a well-received gift. \n\nThe selection of cheeses and charcuterie/deli meats isn't as extensive as whole foods, but is well curated, and in my experience the staff is happy to give out recommendations/samples.  \n\nThe salad/prepared food bar is a step up from most of the offerings at whole foods, although its similarly overpriced for what you're getting.  Nonetheless I like to get a few to-go boxes from time to time with a variety of pastas/salad/etc for an impromptu picnic in nearby Buena Vista Park.\n\nAlso note that they have a small selection of Humphry Slocombe ice cream, which is nice if you want to avoid the crowds at the flagship store in the mission. \n\nBottom line: this can be a five-star place if you order correctly, but I've had a few too many dissapointments lately (pancake and smore cupcakes I'm looking at you) and am downgrading to four stars.

They've also recently hired a staffmember who's very knowledgeable about cheeses.\n\nAnd the list goes on -- nothing on the hot table strikes your fancy? Turn around and peruse the cold case where offerings also change daily -- at any one time you're likely to see bread puddings, crab cakes, country pates, and individual lasagna servings, along with deli meats.\n\nThe salad bar rarely changes - you'll most likely find roasted veggies, romaine lettuce, edamame, noodle salad, beet salad, bulgur and couscous, dressed cucumbers, olives and cold thai chicken every day.\n\nThe desserts are sometimes hit-or-miss (hits: eggnog bread pudding; miss: dulce de leche cake) but you can never go wrong with the mini cupcakes.\n\nOutdoor seating for those who have puppies or like the cold.", "author": "Claudine C."}

There are essays to be written about how f'n delicious and creative it all is, and lucky for you all the other reviewers have written to such lengths so I don't have to. There is a special place in my heart for a bakery section of this caliber.\n\nI HATE how expensive the salad bar is. Every time I tell myself, \"I am never buying anything from this salad bar again\". It is like SURPRISE!! Your tiny amount of food comes to $10! Why? They say they dont charge for the boxes, but why then is it this expensive?! I guess it is because of how delicious their snooty deli food is, but it's really not THAT great. Really. It's not.\n\nI HATE and LOVE how I cannot  count on my favorites being there when I come in. They just have whatever they have everyday. I need some sort of schedule; something to count on. It seems that the days they have something I love, they have EVERYTHING I love. Likewise on other days, I cant seem to find a thing. Maybe they do this because they know, as stated above, that their food is so expensive that having all the favorites everyday would render me poor and unable to shop there at all.\n\nI LOVE the Falletti Foods market. I am a vegetarian and that is part of the love and the extra star for this place. They are very well accommodating to me and my appetite, as they have a wide variety of vegetarian and organic foods alike. The market is expensive, but really  nothing more than Whole Foods, and this is a complaint that that has tried to be solved by Trader Joes. Who is doing a fine job I might add, but at a different level.\n\nThe place is great now and again for some treats. It is nothing to count on though. The quality and flavor ranges in the salads and hot foods. But the bakery and artisan cheeses really make up for anything else lacking.", "author": "Audrey K."}

You just go in and there's a buffet type thing, so you just get a box and start putting things in it. It's all about 9 bucks a pound so it is fairly reasonably although if you are really hungry you could end up spending like 12 bucks for dinner. It's really convenient to be able to grab a bunch of excellent food real fast and take it home on your way in from work. They also have an excellent bakery in case you feel like getting fat or bringing some stuff to a party. Anyway they always change the stuff around but you can always get a good salad, amazing Polenta and Meatloaf, mac and cheese, and whatever they are currently cooking. They also have great paninis and ready made sandwiches.", "author": "Dave C."}

I mean, the convenience store down the corner has more options.  \n\nThe store is divided into two sections, the hot food and desserts section and I guess the front grocery/produce/meats/what not section.  I didn't realize it because I came in on the other side and after I got my stuff and gazed at all the hot food glory I was told in a not nice at all and i hate you tone that \"you can't buy that here - you have to go over there\" and she pointed.  Over there? I'm not sure where.  I just looked around.  And she just stared.  There wasn't even anyone behind me.  She continued to stare.  So I felt sort of dumbish and just walked away.  I figured if I asked her where is over there I'd get my hot food on my face, and again it was her tone.  \n\nThen I (did feel dumb) found on the other side of teh small store where Im suppost to purchase my market items and right as I walked up the checker did a major big ol' sneeze. all over his hand.  and then rang me up. i know, now IM gross, should have walked away, but i had already put my stuff down and conformed to society.  ive had crazy uncontrollable colds & worked in cafes and retail so i understand the dilemma, but it would have been better if he excused himself for some of that liqui-clean gel or something.\n\nso minus the random service and choices what the store does have is really good warm you up options and desserts to make you and your loved ones smile.  if you like food go and take a walk around and your mouth will water water water.", "author": "Walrus C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-08-25", "description": "i give this a begrudging 4 stars. maybe 3.5, really, because in theory, i love this place. the salad bar looks super healthy with mixed greens, etc, and the prepared foods are well labeled and JESUS those desserts look so good. why must you stare up at me and make my sugar-free (mostly. ha) gluten free, dairy free life a living hell? but whenever i've gotten food to go all the prepared stuff is rather greasy and heavy, even like the carrot salad. what gives? tasty, sure, but i feel kind of logged down when i'm done, not light and airy like i should after eating a salad. but the selection is nice and everything is reasonably fresh and tasty. i just wish it wasn't so goddamned greasy.", "author": "Mary V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-05-01", "description": "Good products, good service, but at their premium prices, which are often (not always) 10%-15% higher than, say, Whole Foods, they should be.  My big complaintis that they charge sales tax on cheese, sliced prosciutto, and even baked goods .  I just checked with State Board of Equalization, - and they should not be doing that for anything other than hot prepared food.  Ham, pates, cheeses, baked goods are  exempt from sales tax.", "author": "aloysius t."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-06-16", "description": "The sandwiches are all pre-made so there is no customization. All of the sandwiches are oozing with some kind of mayo base spread and cheese and come out pretty oily. Not untasty, but its hard to enjoy when you know you'll have to run for two hours to burn off half a turkey pannini.", "author": "Mama L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-01-30", "description": "The food  is definitely worth 4 stars, but the utter confusion isn't worth going back here. The right hand doesn't seem to know what the other hands and feet are doing. And the ear-piercing music only adds to the chaos. I thought perhaps this place was just newly opened, but learned that this is not the case. I'll try Hayes Valley. JP", "author": "Jeri P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-23", "description": "this place really does seem to give an f about what they sell, and i can appreciate the system they use to price it.  if you're smart, you can eat a well-balanced meal for six dollars.  obviously, if you're looking to eat cheap, Popeye's is very close.  the cheese selection is beautiful, and everybody who works there has been more than helpful.   i don't know of a lot of places where they will let you taste ANYTHING before you buy it.", "author": "jesus c."}
