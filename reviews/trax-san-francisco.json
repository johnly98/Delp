(p.s- I also love Budweiser)  Anyway, so I took many of my male friends here, and one day my friend Phil comes up to me and says, \"Hey dude, I hope you realize you've been taking me to a gay bar all this time.\" and I was like, \"huh?\" \n\nSo the next time I went in, I guess I missed all the tell-tale signs.

Killer margaritas and lots of madness thrown in especially once you are on your 3rd or 4th one.  And to boot Nathan the bartender during the day is great.  Really nice guy and a really great pour.  So the next time you and some friends are a little in doubt about what to do on a monday afternoon.  Run don't walk to trax but hurry the madness ends by 7.  Cheers  L", "author": "larry w."}

It's nothing fancy, it's not over the top, but it's got history and dive charm. The only \"gay\" bar remaining in the Haight (although not very gay most of the time).  GREAT drinks and GREAT bartenders--gotta see Bill on Tuesdays and Saturdays, but everyone there is terrific at pouring, playing music, and conversing.  The crowd crosses the whole spectrum from locals, to tourists, guys and girls--a mish-mash of people thrown together in one space for a good time.", "author": "kyle w."}

We went kinda aimlessly, cuz neither of us have been out there before.  We stopped into a few places that had sports playing, but that didnt seem very haighty.  it was getting late so we went in one called trax.  the music was weird, sometimes electronic, sometimes more alternative.  she said she knew the music so i was happy we found a real haight st place. then she said hey is this a gay bar? and i said no.. we're in haight! then i looked around... hmmmm.... lol  oops!  it was hilarious to tell our gay friends when they got home from castro that we'd managed to stumble into the only gay place there...  cool costumes on everyone, interesting music, cute little dance floor, i liked it, not my great pick... it was not crowded, but had more people than all the other places.  good place to go if you want something different.", "author": "Merredith L."}

I did not realize that it was a gay bar before I went in, but that became clear quickly after entering. Overall Trax bar didn't seem to discriminate and didn't feel hostile to the straight crowd, which is sadly my opinion of many of the cities gay bars.  The bartender was nice and had a great collection of random 90's music playing.  He filled up my cup several (about six) times, which was real, real chill.  The few things that were drawbacks were; the drunk bartender who I couldn't figure out if he was working and just doing a pathetic job (this was a different bartender than the one who filled my cup and played music), because he seemed to work there and would go behind the bar, yet he also seemed to being playing a lot of pool and not serving too many drinks.  If you are off the clock, don't stay around getting hammered at the establishment at which you work, and if you decide to; change your clothes so I don't take offense when you walk by and don't pay attention.  The other star taken off was for the lack of clarity in regards to the hot dogs which they had out.  When we walked in (my friend Kelly and I) we were told to \"help ourselves\" to a hot dog.  After about my fourth cup I did, then my friend Kelly came over and joined me.  Shortly thereafter the bouncer came over and told us they were three bucks a piece....If you are going to charge, put a sign up and don't only charge people who you don't know, that's shady as hell.  Overall it was a decent place, but I probably won't be back anytime soon.", "author": "Max R."}
