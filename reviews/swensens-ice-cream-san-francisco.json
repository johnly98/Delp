I suspect this may be the case here. \n\nWith most ice cream places, I hope to see a balance of classics and bold/unusual flavors on the menu. Here, as you might expect based on appearances, the menu options are not too out there. As far as the ice cream itself, the bases all had a bit muted flavor and possibly too high fat content, leaving a 'fat film' sensation in the mouth. I tend to not like talking about service in reviews, particularly if the food was great, but I was surprised after I left with my cone that I was given the wrong flavor - I would think an ice cream place leaning in to nostalgia vibes would want to get great service down cold", "author": "Neal B."}

After walking from Telegraph Hill we were relatively out of breath and ready for our ice cream. \n\nWe went into the shop thinking we were going to split a sundae, but we ended up liking our individual flavors we sampled so much that we decided to just get a scoop each. With the prices being relatively cheaper than most popular spots around town (around $3.50), we were really happy with what we got - the black raspberry and the caramel marble. Both were almost like an incredibly rich and creamy vanilla swirled with black raspberry and caramel syrups respectively. In fact, the ice cream was almost so creamy that it reminded me more of a custard than ice cream. \n\nIn terms of the shop itself, there isn't much in the way of decor or seating. The ice cream is definitely better than the shop itself. To eat your ice cream you have to stand around the outside of the shop - not ideal on a chilly night.\n\nI had no idea this was a chain before seeing all these other reviews, so I can only hope that the other locations are as good as this one.

But beyond that, the flavor was rather boring.\n\nThe chocolate just tasted of a generic chocolate, it didn't even have anything that made it stand out, and the chocolate itself reminded me of the ones from those giant buckets tubs of ice cream. Outside of the texture and creaminess, the ice cream just wasn't all that good.\n\nThey have a few interesting flavors too, like Lychee and Matcha, which I wouldn't expect it an ice cream parlor like store, but otherwise the place is kind of run of the mill for me.", "author": "Tyler T."}

The flavors were classic. I ordered the thin mint ice cream (which ended up just being like mint chip ice cream).

For all the ridiculous food trends and sky high prices, if there's one thing SF does right, it's ice cream. I guess I've been spoiled by all the gourmet scoop shops, because Swensen's tasted like generic grocery store ice cream to me. Like if someone brought it to me as an offering, I'd easily refuse and save myself the calories. I sampled several flavors and didn't love any of them- what's up with the green tea that looks unnaturally green but tastes nothing like tea? Ultimately, I settled on the choc chip cookie dough because it's the safest option.\n\nThings I did love about Swensen's:\n\n1. Customer service: I got trolled quite a bit by my server, but that seems to happen to me everywhere in life. I asked if I could sample flavors and he said no with such a straight face that my girlfriends took him seriously. But he turned out to be super nice and I do enjoy friendly banter.\n2. It's simply an SF institution, having been around for decades and still going strong. I appreciate that they stayed true to their old school vibe all this time, and it's apparently famous enough that a group of tourists asked us to take a photo for them outside in front of the sign. I was volunteered as tribute as I'm apparently \"the best at taking photos.\" But also one guy asked me if he looks fat in the photo, and that's just not within my control, dude.\n3. Prices are CHEAP. The small is a generous scoop for only $3.40, although it's a little annoying that they only accept cash. For comparison, one small scoop at garden creamery is $4.25, but tbh my wannabe boujee ass will pay the extra dollar for better quality.\n\nI'd usually even come back and just not order anything if someone suggested it for dessert, but given that there's not any seating or space to hang out, I'd deffo veto it.", "author": "Karen S."}

I thought it had too much chocolate chip, which I got tired of when I got through about half the scoop. \n\nBoth flavors were not too sweet, which is to my liking as I don't have a crazy sweet tooth. On the other hand, my boyfriend who does like super sweet stuff, said the chocolate flavor wasn't as thick and rich as he likes it to be. \n\nParking: Street parking. There were two 10-minute reserved parking only for Swensen customers, which I appreciated.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-29", "description": "Swensen... the ice cream shop that launched a thousand ice cream shops... well more like a couple hundred. \nAfter dinner, Mr. Joy said he wanted to get something sweet close by. Somehow, we ended up at Swensen's from across the city. Well, it was unusually warm, so maybe the weather and the full moon was making us do weird things. Perhaps this picturesque, old-school classic of an ice cream parlour was calling our names. \n\nThere were already quite a few people there. The shop is pretty small, so the line easily goes out the door, but the line moves pretty fast so it helps to know what you want ahead of time. Most people took their orders and went on their way. Some people were enjoying their ice cream on the sidewalk. \n\nThey have a list of flavors on a menu board with very tiny print. \nI tried the Sticky Chewy Chocolate and it was very good. I don't usually go for chocolate-y flavors, but after hearing many good things about it, curiosity won me over. It tastes like fudge if fudge were transformed into ice cream and does have somewhat of a sticky consistency. \nI think I need to try the regular Chocolate & the Sticky Chewy Chocolate simultaneously, just for kicks.\n\nI appreciate that Swensen's has maintained its '50s diner charm for decades. Plus their prices are very affordable compared to most ice cream shops. A small is $3.40 and it is a very generous sized scoop. However, they really need to get a credit card terminal. Cash-only businesses are an inconvenience. Considering Swensen's is an international success with hundreds of locations, I think they can handle the processing fees.", "author": "Joy W."}

Anyways, atop one of the highest hills in the whole city, when walking this city, this ice cream shop is not for the faint of heart. It can definitely be a trek to get there, but once you do, the reward for accomplishing this quest is great. Yes, soft, cold, melty ice cream that's to be sloppily eaten and engorged upon with an unrelenting vigor. Unlike the other ice cream shops around the city, Swensen's doesn't have too many unusual flavors, but it mostly just focuses on traditional flavors and tries to keep the quality of these select few flavors creamy, and delicious. \n\nAs for the ice cream's consistency, it's a little bit melty and softer. And while it wasn't soupy melty, it was definitely melting fairly fast when eating it (which was in like 50 degree weather by the way). Because of this, eating it reminded me of a lot of older movies that featured older timey ice cream shops. You know the ones where the children have ice cream all over their face, and you think to yourself, \"Dear Lord child! Try to get more of the ice cream in your mouth as opposed to the rest of your face.\" I totally thought this was more of a hollywood trope to make the child seem adorable. In reality, and specifically at Swensen's, this shizz actually happens- and specifically to me. Chocolate was all up in my business as I tried to engulf the cone before it melted all over my pants. There were spots on my nose, drips on my arms, and an ample amount all over my cheeks. Luckily for the last one, my beard was able to cover up most of this, but upon entering a bathroom next, I was able to see the extent of the damage this single cone could cause. So be careful when eating this on a sweltering summer day. Things could get a little bit messy.\n\nOverall the place it really solid, but it certainly isn't perfect. The very few things that keep it from getting the 5th star are: a little too melty in colder weather, and there are more exciting flavors to be found around the city. But if you're looking for a classic ice cream cone, then Swensen's is a solid (well melty solid) choice.", "author": "Daniel Z."}

The ice cream was VERY CREAMY and the chocolate flavor was very thick, unlike other ice cream places where the flavors are more watered down.

However, the owner, who is this middle-aged Asian male, was. He seemed pretty cool and joked around with me. \n\nSETTING: If you are coming by muni, it's most likely that you'll be climbing a FEW GIANT HILLS before you get here. BUT WORRY NOT. It's totally worth it. One downside is that there is no places to sit in the shop, which is fine since there are many things to see in the area, so why not just take a stroll? \n\nPRICE: Giant serving for less than $4 with a waffle cone??

It's been on that corner of Hyde and Union on Russian Hill since the Truman years, and the tiny place still has a touch of the old-fashioned parlor about it (photo: http://bit.ly/14EBMfh). Not too surprisingly, it's a magnet for young families on an unusually warm Saturday afternoon. Jamie W. and I were trying unsuccessfully walk off the gigantic pot stickers we gorged on a couple of hours prior at U-Lee (review: http://bit.ly/11V65wk) when we came upon the short line at Swensen's. An ice cream cone felt like the right thing at the wrong time, which is fine by me since two wrongs don't make a right anyway.\n\nParalyzed by the number of flavors on the overhead menu, I impulsively ordered a $4.50 Double Cone of Peppermint Twist and Turkish Coffee (photo: http://bit.ly/11V5RVZ). The peppermint took me back to those golden days of my early childhood in San Mateo when I pulled at my mom's pocketbook at Shaw's on El Camino to get her to buy me a peppermint cone. Now I pull on Jamie's shirt to get his permission to imbibe more calories, dairy no less, and I still get that glare of disapproval that I got from my mom followed by the inevitability of the cone. Must be my charm. Anyway it hit the spot, and I had no problem licking it on the street and letting it drip on the sidewalk. How old am I? Oh who cares.\n\nICE CREAM - 4 stars...old-fashioned creamy goodness on Russian Hill (photo: http://bit.ly/1271mqc)\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...tiny spot, no seats but still very Eisenhower-era\nSERVICE - 3 stars...they scoop 'em with no fuss\nTOTAL - 4 stars...ice cream before it got all organic and eclectic", "author": "Ed U."}

My peppermint ice cream tasted alright, but I could compare it to the Dreyer's I can get at Safeway. The boyfriend got peach and couldn't even finish the entire thing. This is probably mostly due to his inability to choose ice cream flavors, but I think good ice cream parlors have the power to make anything taste good (olive oil ice cream at Humphrey Slocombe, anyone??).

The spunky Asian gal behind the counter was very patient and gave me one teeny spoon after another until I finally settled on Toasted Almond. I could've easily gone with 3 other flavors but only wanted a scoop.  Said gal also made the thickest milkshake my bf has ever been satisfied with at an establishment, which made him very happy.\n\nThanks for the sweet treats and happy bellies Swensen's!", "author": "Christine Y."}

Each spoonful gets more addicting than the previous one! \n\nQuantity/Value for Money - I got a whopping 16 oz Swensen's pint for only $6.65. This is beyond reasonable since even a pint of Haagen Dazs can be $4-5 on a normal day and those are not even freshly made! They are also kind enough to let you mix multiple flavors in a pint. I chose Lychee and Tahitian Coffee - both flavors that I highly recommend and would return for. \n\nWalking up here is quite a trek, since it sits atop Union and Hyde, but it is well worth it and I am glad to live within walking distance.

I am NOT an ice cream fan.  \n\nHowever, after eating a delicious meal without dessert, I started to get a little loopy.  I NEEDED MY SUGAR!  It was a Saturday night, and all the dessert places in the downtown seem to close at 2pm.  We didn't feel like getting buck wild at a bar, so we were on the hunt for frozen yogurt.  Yogorino was closed.  Miette was closed.  All the cupcake places I love were closed.  So we stumbled into Swensen's.  \n\nThe name sounded so familiar... I wasn't sure where I'd heard it from... I wanted to say I saw it on some food network show... but I'm still not quite sure....  It had to be a hit spot when people are lining up out the door at 10pm on a Saturday night.\n\nOh boy, Swensen's Ice Cream totally hit the spot.  The boyfriend had Thin Mint and I had the lychee ice cream.  DELICIOUS!  They had real chunks of lychee in the ice cream!  I was definitely a happy jumping bean.\n\nOnly downer, it's cash only.  I'm usually very against institutions that are cash only.. Come on.. who carries cash anymore?

Even a small cup seemed to last forever ( I was worried about eating it too quickly and watching the bottom of the cup appear) as I relished every drop of this ambrosial goodness. \n\nGiven a chance I would have sampled every single flavor in the store and gladly embraced a tummy ache later. \n\nI also think their milk shakes are divine.

Gross.)\n\nIt was my first (and last) visit to Swensen's with my husband.  While we were waiting to be helped, I noticed a woman who was mopping the floor.  Since the line was quite long, she put the mop down and started handling money at the register.  Now think about what she's touched so far - a disgusting mop handle and now she's handling dollar bills and change.\n\nBefore we knew it, it was our turn to order and it turns out this same woman was the one who was scooping our ice cream.  She handed our sugar cones to us which did NOT have any paper wrapping nor napkin around it NOR had she washed her hands before scooping our order.\n\nYou know how sometimes you are observing and processing things, but not really putting it all together or you're just too dumbfounded that what you saw was real?  I just accepted my cone and went outside.  When I went outside, I took a tentative taste of my ice cream (since she didn't handle that with her hands), thought for a second about just eating the ice cream only, then promptly chucked the entire thing in the trash.\n\nHonestly SF, please take a cue from NYC and start putting letter grades in the windows of businesses.", "author": "Serena H."}

The menu and signs give that away. Most flavors have some sort of chocolate  in them and a strong chocolate smell comes through the doors. Not a bad thing at all, but it seems like they do not experiment as much with other flavors. They keep it basic for the most part with basic sherbet and fruit flavors as well. \n\nI tried the Turkish coffee which I liked (though not sure what makes it Turkish vs a regular coffee flavor) and a vanilla custard which was pretty good too.\n\nMaybe I should have tried another flavor like Swiss Orange Chip, or  Lychee. Overall they were good, just not impressive. Nothing that would make me visit Swensen over other ice cream places that I really liked in SF.\n\n1 more thing!

I grew up with Swensen's in Malaysia and I had fond memories of indulging their beautiful creations in Kuala Lumpur and Penang. Little did I know, it all started from this quaint little shop in Russian Hill.\n\nHonestly, we were walking on Hyde St and stumbled upon this place by accident. I got so excited I just crossed the street without looking and rushed into the shop. It's was definitely different than other newer Swensen's shops which tend to be brighter and colourful. This location seems to look a lot simpler; probably staying as close to the original decor as possible.\n\nThe flavours were amazing and I think it took me a solid 10 minutes to decide what I wanted. I mean, this is historic and it's got to be the perfect ice cream =). I decided to get the Swiss Orange Chip while my partner got the Peanut Butter Chocolate. They were dense, creamy and there's small dollops of frozen peanut butter in the PBC, it's almost like eat PB directly from a tub. Phe-no-me-nal!\n\nThe downside is, I don't find the staff very friendly though. We stood there for 10 minutes and they didn't even suggest anything.

This is old-fashioned high fat, clog your arteries ice cream.  My favorites since childhood have been strawberry (with big chunks of strawberries and strawberry syrup in it) and the mocha fudge is absolutely divine - coffee ice cream with big swirls of liquid chocolate running throughout.  I'm sure they have other delicious flavors but I'm a creature of habit - I stick with what I like.   They will combine two flavors in a Swensen's quart which is nice - you can have them do it vertically (side by side) if you want to eat them together.  They will also give you a free sample of anything on a spoon to taste in the store (I always get french vanilla and give it to my dog!) ...oh, and their sorbets are good too.\n\nThey have a revolving door of high school kids who scoop for you ... they don't zero out the scale when they pack the pints and quarts, so make sure that you get an extra ounce, weight-wise, because the container weighs just under an ounce.  Most of the people who pack the pints/quarts overpack so you usually get the full value of what you are buying.", "author": "Alexandra D."}

However, after trying it, I was a bit disappointed and not amazed. Swensen's Ice Cream isn't like Bi-rite nor Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous Ice Cream. Swensen offers the classic type of ice cream flavors that you can find elsewhere and once in awhile, a few unique flavors. None of the flavors really stood out to me. We were around the area one night because we had reservations at one of the restaurants nearby. Since we were early, we decided to grab some dessert before dinner (we had a pretty late reservation). We ordered a small size Swiss Orange Chip flavor to share. I thought the flavor was just alright. There were small bits of chocolate in the ice cream with an orange flavor taste. The chocolate ice cream was very rich, which was a bit too much for me. I think the ice cream in general was very creamy and thick. As for service, the guys working that night did not seem too happy to be working. They looked miserable and looked like they didn't want to be there. They should at least not show that to the customers! Geez..  As for parking, it is a nightmare! Make sure you're ready to circle around the blocks for awhile!", "author": "Philana C."}

I can wolf down mind blowing amounts of creamy delicious dairy so when I discovered that a very popular ice cream parlor was nearby I had to try it.\n\nWe went late at night so we avoided the line that many reviews are talking about.  It is simple inside and has an old ice cream parlor feel to it.  I sampled a variety of the flavors and the chocolate orange (not sure the official name but they will know what you are talking about if you ask) was amazing!  The other flavors didn't really do much for me though.  I wasn't in love with the texture of the ice cream, it seemed almost artificial and heavy.\n\nThis place is solid, just nothing insanely special.  If you want to wait in a huge line for great ice cream head down to the mission, the wait is much more worth it.  If there's no line and you want a special treat I would give it a go.", "author": "Ryan J."}

That doesn't mean Swensen's wasn't amazing, though.\n\nI had a scoop of peppermint stick and a scoop of caramel swirl topped with a hefty dollop of hot fudge. Sometimes you don't want fancy flavors.

How often would you be able to go into the very first Swensen's, one out of the 300 store that are located across the world?

A particular night in the Castro delayed our plans, so the second time we went we were determined to make it in the door before 11 (their closing time on Saturdays).  There was running, there was even a short cab ride, and we got to Swenson's at 10:53 to find the \"Closed\" sign up in the window and an employee mopping the floor.  I understand that some businesses close a few minutes before their actual close time, but getting this cone with my favorite guy was more of a principal issue at this point.  The employee said they were closed because they'd had a rough night; I'm sure I said something about also having a rough night as my guy heroically/obnoxiously walked inside.  The person behind the counter said, \"We're closed,\" to which my guy said, \"It's not 11 yet - I'll have a cookie dough and a chocolate.\"  The people literally 10-seconds behind us were rejected by the recently locked door (bad business), and we triumphantly ate some pretty delicious,  thick, old-fashioned frozen goodness.  \n\nDate night: awesome.\nProduct: great.\nService: totally disappointing.", "author": "Rusty P."}

I have had my 2 favorite flavors in the world (Mint Chip and Old Fashion Vanilla) and both were amazing. Single scoop is more than enough for me. If you are standing on the right angle, you may just be lucky enough to see \"medicine bottles\" in the back where they make the ice cream. That took me back.\n\nBy far the best place in the city to get ice cream. For the portions, flavors, and price you won't be disappointed.

When I got there, it was nothing like the franchise I remember--there was no large space for tables or booths, there weren't full lunch menus or crazy sundae concoctions that could easily rival and best Ghiradelli's monstrosities... there was no more strawberry sundae, just an small L display corner store basking in the weekend sunset glow.\nBut, they still had really, really good ice cream. I went for the banana flavor, something that I don't remember being on the flavor list when I was young but still a bit traditional--wow, it was so delicious, real banana blended into vanilla, creamy but not too whipped, packed into thick scoops on my cone. It evoked food thoughts of the banana milk shake from the Falafel Drive-In, another bit of hazy California nostalgia.\nWell... we have a slew of other boutique frozen dessert venues--but for modest, straight-forward flavors with great crafting...

Keep in mind no tables, no seats....go in order your favorite Ice Cream and take a stroll and enjoy the Ice Cream as it melts in your mouth......", "author": "Alan L."}

The ice cream was good, but not fantastic, out-of-this world type of great. It's also a bit over-priced, all things considering, although this is SF so it's probably in line with that.\n\n\nWe are vacationing around the corner so parking wasn't an issue, but I could see how it could be if you don't live in the neighborhood.\n\nI had a \"small double\" which was supposed to be 6 oz. On the bottom, Rocky Road; on the top, Coconut (one of my favorites). They were both tasty, but not particularly rich or extra-creamy and certainly not better than other ice creams I've had before.\n\nMy wife had Sticky Chewy Chocolate and Swiss Orange. I tasted both of hers. The latter reminded me of one of those cheap milk-chocolate \"orange chocolate balls\" that you can buy and break into wedges. Not my thing, but my wife liked them both and thought they were unique at least.\n\nAll in all, if you're in the area and don't have to park, it's better than B&J's or HD ice cream from 7-11, but if your'e going to make a special trip, there are probably other alternatives to consider.", "author": "Tim G."}

Better yet, have a friend drive you there, and get them to pick you up. Parking is horrendous, and you'll always swear to god that the people driving here are tourists.\n\n2. There's no seating inside. No tables, nothing. You can most certainly eat inside the parlor, but don't expect to rest your weary feet.\n\n3. Bring some cash to tip your scooper.

Swensen's has some amazing ice cream and true Americana charm; when you walk in you can smell the sweet deliciousness ready to titillate your tastebuds on first lick, and just walking by the old school store front makes me nostalgic (and I've only known about Swensen's for about 2 months).  \n\nThe portions are immense--I ordered a one scoop cone of mint chip, and am loathe to find out what the double scoop looks like!  My tum was filled to the brim with ice cream, and I'm one of those girls who can eat a pint without blinking an eye!  \n\nThe mint chip was delicious--sweet, minty, big hunks of chocolate, creamy... My only complaint is that the chips didn't have my preferred ice cream texture.   (I've found that if you use the real deal, 100% chocolate chips in your ice cream, the cocoa butter content gets super hard and crunches in your mouth rather than melting and yielding under gentle pressure.  It's when you use chocolate chips that have been augmented by coconut oil or some other fatty substance that the frozen guys maintain an appropriate room-temperature-chocolate-like feel... but that's just me)\n\nBF had the seasonal pumpkin flavor, and he was in heaven.  You could taste the pumpkin pie spice with each lick!  Not to mention it was amazing the way the pumpkin ice cream texture resembled the mild grittiness (for lack of a better word) of real pumpkin pie.  Dee-lish!\n\nMy one hope is that when the warm weather comes there will be outside seating, because walking home while trying to both hold a huge scoop of ice cream precariously perched on a cone and simultaneously hold Alex's hand brings about torturous memories of that perfect double-scoop cone I ruined at the tender age of 7...

(Glad to see San Francisco's finest was still working at 8:30 p.m. my tax dollars at work ).  My sister-in-law cozied up next to him and coyly in a high girly voice said \"so what's your favorite flavor?\" to which he cocked his head and responded \"Rocky Road of course,\" then did a wink without winking and strode out. It was really funny.  We agreed, though both of us are married, that he was sleazy and a little greasy but still totally charming and hot in that Bill Clinton way.\n\nAnyway!!!

They don't show you any of the ice cream until they open the lid to scoop it.  So, they don't waste ice cream on giving crazy amounts of samples or have people holding up the line, debating what to get.  The culture is: you look at the wooden menu, you go for a flavor..they unveil the ice cream for just 5 seconds and present you with the cone.  I got the chocolate turtle fudge and hubby got mocha chip.  I had no freaking clue what the chocolate turtle fudge was but it ended up being a wonderful gooey mix of chocolates and nuts.

Was recommended to try Swensen's and I believe it's pretty good, but not the best I've ever had.  Their chewy sticky chocolate is probably the best - very creamy.  I also tried the strawberry slushy ice cream and it does taste just like a strawberry slushee, but a little weird as ice cream!  It's not really their fault that there's no parking in the area and I had to drive around 10 times to try this place out, but it still had an impact on my ice cream experience.  Also, I am sad that they do not have the Chocolate Earthquake available since they're not really part of the \"franchise\".  I would've given another star if only they would accept credit card - at least for a minimum charge of $10!  Or I'd even be willing to give another star if I could try that Chocolate Earthquake....it looks AMAZING and I'd eat it all day.  Sucha fatty!", "author": "Dee H."}

This ice cream shop has outlasted any ice cream parlor in San Francisco with the exception of Ghiradelli, but Ghiradelli is in the touristy area and Swenson's is not. I used to work here when I went to high school at Galileo in like 1982. Loved it. I have always been a fan even before that. Yeah there's Birite Creamery who boasts about being unique with flavors, but when it come down to your traditional gotta have my sticky chewy chocolate, Swenson's rocks. Maybe that's why they have succeeded where those who haven't...they keep it simple and try not to be trendy. So if you're ever in the San Francisco area, especially on Hyde/Union Street, drop in and have a cold one. Also, they have a killer water fountain. The water is nice and cold. The service is what you get...their high school kids. Give em a break and tip.", "author": "William M."}

I live across the street so it can be dangerous, but nothing beats a scoop of fresh banana ice cream, or even a banana milk shake made with a real banana AND fresh banana ice cream! it's a tiny place, but on a really good corner so, even though you can't eat inside, standing on the curb, while waiting for the 45 on a Saturday afternoon is pure bliss. The cable car stops right there as well so it's not a bad idea to hop off at Swensens, get ice cream and work it off by walking the rest of the way up Hyde on your way to Lombard St. ;)\n\nHOWEVER, they only accept cash, which I HATE, but i'd gladly go to the ATM for Swensens.", "author": "Sarah I."}

Simple:\n\n1) They don't take credit cards. Coming from Berkeley, where no one takes cards, its really annoying having to constantly carry cash all the time and be Swensen-less when you don't have cash. I thought I was finally moving to civilization when I moved to the city. \n\n2) They are closed on Mondays. WHAT?!? For what reason? But why a 2, you say? Yesterday was 93 degrees and all I wanted after a day at work and a long ride on an overcrowded stuffy bus was some damn ice cream. Too much to ask for? I live a block away from one of the best ice cream spots in the city and I had to settle for Ben N Jerry's ice cream from Walgreens. \n\nGet it together, Swensen's!

Regular ice cream just usually leaves me feeling like I have a thin, residual layer of cream coating my mouth, so I prefer pretty much any kind of frozen yogurt. But even putting that aside, Swensen's seems to have much less interesting flavors than Mitchell's, let alone Bi-Rite or HS, and even the standard flavors didn't seem that -good.- I got a caramel turtle flavor and there was a smattering of fudge and some nuts, but not much else. Sure, maybe I just don't appreciate traditional ice cream - but I think I do enjoy better versions of it. Also, they used to have yogurt but don't seem to any more, and their lower-fat selection seems pretty limited. I will give them that their prices seem reasonable ($2.50 for the smallest non-child size, which was pretty decent).", "author": "Lisa K."}

You could totally put together an amazing experience to really impress a date, the sort of evening which the movies would have us think can only be had in Paris. You have these subdued storefronts, the kind that don't loudly call; they are discreet, refined, confident in their own arrived-ness, as calm as the 15th-generation scion of a family which landed with the Bradfords on the Mayflower. You have these fine restaurants whose dim lighting bathes the nighttime sidewalk under the canopy of leafy trees which one imagines were probably planted before the Golden Gate had a bridge. The conclusion to your magical evening, the ideal setting in which to seal the deal, the perfect place to strike the coup de grace, when your date is waiting for your invitation back to your place, is to get ice cream from this place, whose outside and interior appear to be preserved in amber from the early 1960s. The ice cream is top-notch, but the place is really special because of how it fits in to this extraordinary neighborhood - a gracious bit of uptown Manhattan (think 5th Ave around 70th or 80th).", "author": "Michael E."}

After a killer dinner at Zarzuela, we forced ourselves across the street where the Swensen's crew tried to close the door in our faces but were kind enough to let us in to try and make a quick order. The man running the show was quite animated and we spent more time cracking jokes with him than we did talking about how many pints of what kinds ice cream we wanted to leave with. We ended up with a pint of mocha chip and a pint of (yummmm) thin mint. We paid and left and I turned to my mom who was carrying the bag and asked her to check that he had put the lid on the second pint of ice cream since to me it looked like he just dropped it into the bag like it was a laser-guided bomb. She said he definitely put the lid on and off we went. Of course, later that night when we broke out the pints to put them in the freezer she exclaimed, hey, the lid isn't fixed on this top pint of ice cream! S.h.o.c.k.e.r. On the bright side, he had filled that pint over the top so I guess he couldn't get the lid on. Warning us of this would have been a nice touch instead of letting us walk out with a melting mocha chip time-bomb. As Homer would say though ... it's just a little melted, it's still good, it's still good.", "author": "Todd F."}

Surprisingly I had never tried Swensen's which is in my neighborhood and easily accessible by cable car (random note: you cannot eat ice cream in a cable car). Swensen's looks like an old fashioned ice cream parlor, and indeed it is. While there are not as many exotic flavors as Mitchell's the nice thing about this creamery is that they have a decent selection of light ice creams so even though I do a lot of walking up hills to get there, I won't be turning into a blimp. I've had the light cookies and cream flavor all three times I've payed a visit. Maybe I should broaden my horizons and try something different, but it was just that good. Almost more cookies than cream. Real oreos too, not fake hydrox or other imposters. I also sampled the sticky gooey chocolate or whatever it is called which is not bad. I'll be going back to Swensen's especially if the weather gets warmer.", "author": "Kate A."}

My best friend rattled on and on and on about one being in his hometown of Arroyo Grande and how much he missed it once they closed down. Well a few years ago I found the one here in the city. I planned and plotted and after taking my friend out to North Beach for lunch I drove him up Russian Hill where we proceeded to fight ! Finally at the last crest of the hill I told him to look on the corner. Smartie snapped and asked what am I looking at (he was looking at the wrong corner)? I told him to look the other way and saw tears spring up in his eyes. He turned to look at me and said,\"There's really still a Swensen's?\". Yes Jakey there really is still a Swensen's. As we walked along chowing down on our ice cream cones (mine vanilla and his cookies and cream respectively), giggling and chatting along I realized that there is something magical about a good ice cream cone (creamy, sweet goodness) and that sometimes it's worth hunting down a piece of childhood for your friends.", "author": "Veronica G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-09", "description": "Some people choose Bi-Rite, other's Mitchell's.  For delicous San Francisco ice cream, I choose Swensen's.  There are several factors at play here.  First of all, it is only four-and-a-half blocks from my house.  The North Beach gelato joints are slightly closer, but swamped with tourists, and a bit gimmicky.  Second, they have wonderfully creamy ice cream that hits the spot on a hot, late summer day.  Third, their French vanilla custard is just a delight.  Look, I'm not a vanilla person -- I don't like it as the individual flavor in ice cream, as it ends up being to bland most of the time.  But their French vanilla custard has become my stand-by because it is just so fantastic.  Other favorites of mine include their pink peppermint, the seasonal egg nog and pumpkin ice creams (very apparently made with real egg nog and real pumpkin), and Turkish coffee.  My advice will always be to skip the crowds, and come to Swensen's.", "author": "Nick B."}

I can't tell you how many flavors I taste-tested (we got a free scope after every shift as a perk of the job)!  I liked them all, but the ones I remember most were Sticky Chewy Chocolate, Swiss Orange Chip, Strawberry Banana, Chocolate Chip (with toffee chips!!) and Love, which was chocolate ice cream flavored with cinnamon, nuts and cherries (yes, we made Love at Swensen's!).  I took my son to SF this summer and had to stop at the original Swensen's (and one of the few remaining in the US). I wasn't disappointed! He had the sticky chewy chocolate and I had the Swiss Orange Chip (my all-time fave), with a scoop of Lychee, which I'd never seen before. WOW!!!

There are a couple of spots there close by, but I pull up swensen's on the old mobile GPS.  We both have a sentimental, nostalgic allegiance with Swensen's and I assure her it's worth the hike up Hyde.  \"Besides,\" I tell her, \"we'll burn off the ice cream calories before we eat it!\"  Well, she had to use the restroom half-way up...and I mean HAD to use it.  When we finally arrived, I was disappointed.  The place was looking pretty bad.  The help was not friendly.  The menu was not as good as the places at Pier 39.  And the help wasn't very helpful and cheerful.  So much for nostalgia.  We wanted a banana split and they didn't have one.  What kind of an ice cream shop doesn't have a banana split?  What kind of an ice cream shop that doesn't have it on the menu, doesn't offer to make it anyway (one without bananas I guess, but I digress...).  How about when we ask if there's a restroom nearby, the response is, \"Uh, the only one I know of is really far away.\"  As opposed to, \"Well, we don't have a public one, but considering the fact that your legs are crossed, you're sweating, and pronated at 45 degrees...and doing the dance, go ahead and use the one back here behind the counter.\"  That would have been nice.  Oh well.  I mean, maybe I'm setting my standards too high.  I guess you can be the judge.  In the meantime, I'm going to relax my allegiance to Swensen's and go with something in a more convenient proximity next time. ;-)", "author": "Mike F."}
