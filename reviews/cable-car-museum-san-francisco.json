I never knew how the whole cable car really worked so it intrigued me. \n\nIt is free admission to get into the museum and so I didn't go very it a second thought and walked in. It was amazing to see the giant wheels operating. Apparently this facility powers the cable cars throughout San Francisco. If you go downstairs you can see the wheels underground as well. They had plenty of reading on the walls about the history and how the cable cars work. The whole thing made me want to get on a cable car so I bought a day pass and rode it back and forth several times. \n\nReally nice museum and pretty clean too! Very cool place!

This Museum IS the engine of all those Cable Cars you see out there, and their history, and yes... even a gift shop with lost of cool Cable Car doo-dads. You can get off the Cable Car at the Museum, with a transfer, on one of the lines (ask... I think it's the Mason Street line) and get back on right out front, all of which is at-no-cost! \nI bet there are many people who don't even know about this museum, even as they pass by it on the cable car.\n\nThe Museum is hands-on, and good for kids, interesting for Mom's and Dad's too! Not to mention that it has some great photo spots! It takes as little as a half hour to see everything there. (and they have bathrooms, too)\n\nI have one suggestion, though.... Docents! It would be great if they had a docent or two, maybe in Cable Car Operator uniforms (historical and new) so people can ask questions, maybe snap a photo, etc. I bet there are some retirees and cable car buffs who would love to volunteer for such a fun job.

After moving to SoCal roughly 10 yrs ago, I always feel like a tourist when I go back to see friends. \n\nOn a trip in early '17, I finally did it ... took the overhyped cable car ride and went to see the museum. \n\nThere are no guides. There are no recorded guided tours either. You just walk up, take a look around, observe and read the plaques in front of the displays or check out the old photos on the wall. \n\nIt's noisy in there, so conversations will turn into a shouting match.  Forget about talking on your phone. It's impossible.  It's not terribly big but there are decent photo ops to capture the history of SF and its famed cable cars. And a cool way to spend about an hour at most seeing how it all works. \n\nIt wasn't very packed in there when we went on a Saturday since for tourists, there are many other 'touristy' things to do. But there was a steady flow of peeps walking in. \n\nIf you're in the area, it's worth a visit!  \n\nNotes:\n* Free entry.  Can't beat that. \n* There's a souvenir store inside. Not surprising\n* Unless you're an awesome driver and master at parking, I'd advise public transit, cab or walk.\n* Def bring a camera & take pics. \n* Wheelchair accessible on side of building, w elevator. \n* There are public restrooms inside.", "author": "James L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-02-13", "description": "In his review from December, Yelper James L said it best:  \"it only took me 40 years...\".\n\nSilly, but true, it took that long for the Cable Car Museum to rise to become a part of my day.  Let's face it, it's not the place one thinks of when imagining a \"museum day\" nor is it the experience that comes to mind when envisioning cable cars.  Certainly a visit to SF's MOMA or a ride on the Powell-Hyde line is a better experience but there's only one of those experiences that's free.  \n\nWelcome to SF's Cable Car Museum; free and worth about 40 minutes of your time.  \n\nIt's not well known, but San Francisco's history includes a time when independently owned cable cars traversed the city.  Imagine being able to lay down tracks and start your own cable car company on a whim and you can see why this wasn't a sustainable proposition.  \n\nThen imagine a San Francisco without cable cars.  It almost happened and, were it not for the efforts of one particularly tenacious person, it might have.  \n\nWhat did the City look like in the immediate aftermath of the 1906 earthquake and fires?  Interesting and compelling.\n\nThe Cable Car Museum covers all of this and more in a clean, well organized, informative space featuring lots of photos, stories, cables, and (grounded) cable cars.  It also features a non-stop, low-level din, from the active cables.  Think of it as a clean and informative machine-shop.\n\nIf you too wait 40 years to visit I suspect the whole thing will remain much the same but if you're in the neighborhood (Nob Hill or Chinatown) or looking for a reason to be, the Cable Car Museum is an interesting little sideline to whatever else you might have planned for the day.  \n\nFree and interesting:  It's the way I aspire to spend most days.  The Cable Car Museum is a solid if not particularly exciting experience.", "author": "Tracey A."}

The date listed on one of the machines is from a Philadelphia company from 1892. They are loud and obviously well built.\n\nThe museum has plaques showing how the cables are made, when they were invented, and when the system was implemented and how it was saved from destruction.\n\nThere is a gift shop to buy a souvenir.

I stumbled across it one day when I took a visitor to the top of Nob Hill to see beautiful Huntington Park, Grace Cathedral, and the historically posh SF Hotels.  Next stop, down to North Beach and find a Bloody Mary, stat.  We stumbled upon this place and it is really worth checking out.\n\nI thought Cable Cars were sort of a quirky little novelty for my first year or so living in SF.  My attitude has since turned.  Part of that change was based on learning more about the history.  There's a reason why we have Cable Cars - it's the hills.  As The City developed, the Cable Cars were how the folks in the olden days expanded beyond the low-lying areas in the (now) FiDi, SoMa and North Beach.  (We're talking in the days when North Beach was actually a beach.)  \n\nThis museum has a great range of history, including:\n\n*Andrew Hallidie, the engineer who made cables and was instrumental in the mining technology.  The story goes, he saw a horse drawn carriage slide backward down a steep muddy hill.  Our Cable Car version of Mr. Newton's apple.\n*History about the older lines and their impact on SF development.  There were a lot more lines, once upon a time.  You can see how they were laid out, and you can also see how the companies thrived or failed.\n*Friedel Klussmann \"The Cable Car Lady\" - Who saved the Cable Cars from their potential final demise.  She formed the Citizens' Committee to Save the Cable Cars and won a referendum in 1947.  BTW - A big mid-finger salute to then short-sighted Republican Mayor Roger Lapham who was trying to scrap the Cable Cars because he came under fire for increasing the fares.  He was a one-termer.\n*Some great info about the massive restoration that took place in the early-80's.  And, a super awesome 80's-style video about the Cable Cars.  \n\nAnother big reason to check this out is that it is also the power-house that actually drives the cables.  You can see the major lines that drive the little systems that pulls the cars along.  Very cool.  They also have a nice gift shop.", "author": "Adam S."}

Located along the Cable Car line, it is easy to access. I would recommend hopping on the Cable Car at Ghirardelli Square (where they start) and taking it up to the museum (the guys operating the cable cars will tell you when to get off). A Cable Car ride is $6 for one way, or you can buy a day pass for something like $17. I'd also recommend getting to the cars early....I got there around 9am and there was no wait (once it gets close to 11am, there will be a very long wait!). \n\nOnto the museum. The Cable Car Museum is FREE, which is amazing!! This place is small, so allow yourself about 45 minutes to explore the entire place (60 minutes maybe if you want to check out the gift shop!). There are so many pictures and descriptions of the cable cars -- it is truly awesome how cable cars have evolved over the years. There is also the only remaining cable car from 1872 at this museum too! I loved seeing the old pictures from the late 1800's and how people traveled from place to place in the city at the time. You can also see all the cables that operate the current cable cars in the city and the men and women that operate them. I was so fascinated by this aspect -- I had no idea that the operation to operate the cable cars was so huge! Pure awesomeness!\n\nSide note: there is a free and clean restroom to use in this museum, which is rare and hard to find in the city.

A cable car stop is located right outside.  The museum is two stories and contains old cable cars, cable car parts, old photographs, video exhibits, and a gift shop.  Most of your time will probably be spent on the upper floor where most of the aforementioned items are located.\n\nThe upper floor looks down upon the Washington-Mason cable car barn.  You can see the giant pulleys that run the cables down the Hyde, California, Mason, and Powell lines in action.  Each is labeled.  You can also see the offices and work stations of cable car employees.  It's a peek into their operations.  The lower floor is underground and gives you a look at the pulleys and sheaves (a sheave is a type of pulley) that constantly run the cables underneath the street.  It gives you a new perspective of the cable cars you see running above ground.\n\nRestrooms are located on the upper level.\n\nA trip to the Cable Car Museum doesn't take very long.

All sorts of artifacts from the past and present. Was pretty cool to get up close to some of the machinery they use to control the cars on the street, as well as get a first hand look at the cables and motors that actually propel the cars through San Francisco. When you first enter the building, go to the right to check out the museum and store, however on your way out, make sure you go to the left, downstairs, to check out some of the inner workings of how the cables above are fed into the streets. Oh, and do take a moment to watch the video they have playing but in the back, not only does it give a good narrative tour of everything else you've seen in the museum, it's also quite funny to watch and see all the retro cars, outfits, and hair styles from the mid 1980s when it was produced.  Well worth a stop, will probably take you 30-45 minutes to work your way through.

This means doing all the tourist-y things, posing in front of tourist-y places, and eating all tourist-y stuff.\n\nCable cars are definitely iconic of SF.  Which means I had to drag his ass up and down and up and down and down and up and down the SF hills to get here when we walked.\n\nWe got here around 5 minutes before 10am.  Because the museum opens 10am-6pm everyday (at free admission!), I asked him if we could wait for it to open, which he begrudgingly accepted.  After he was further annoyed by the people smoking, the museum finally opened, and we went immediately upstairs.  Or, I went upstairs and he followed me....into seeing all the cable lines.\n\nLove at first sight, I tell you.  Bf was completely shocked and mesmerized by the fact that he was standing above the actual power house for the cable cars.  We actually both thought it was just a museum for the cable cars, but not that it was a true functioning building with a very important purpose.  Needless to say, very cool.  It can get a bit loud if you're not used to it, but it's just a loud hum.  You can see some of the employees in the back right-corner, doing their magic in either fixing or constructing parts for the cable cars.\n\nOn the left-hand corner of the building, you can sit down and watch a video on how the cable cars function, and a bit of the history.  All along the walls, you'll find news articles of when the cable cars were about to be eradicated.  You'll find a few cases with bus tokens, coin changers, and other small memorabilia.  One of the items that breaks my heart is a little memorial for 3 dogs that served the cable cars until their dying day.  They had a tragic end, as burglars poisoned them, and they basically died in the line of duty.  =(  Why isn't there any sort of souvenirs for these puppies, or something that would allow tourists to put in money to help support a local pet charity (SF SPCA?).  The story of the 3 dogs made me sad...\n\nThe gift shop isn't bad.  Lots of small little nifty items.  There are even bells that you can purchase to ring them (I think a few people actually try and use it as their doorbell).  Service is okay, but I can understand if they're grumpy because they hear a loud hum all day that they can't block out, and there's no real air conditioning. \n\nThey have a penny machine, if you're looking for a cheap souvenir for the kiddies!", "author": "Grace C."}

San Francisco's Cable Car Museum lives up to the accolades you'll find if you read even a handful of the reviews.

For those who've got \"ride a cable car\" high on their to-do list, this is the place to get the historical interpretation to make the experience complete.\n\nThe museum is a great pit stop between more time-consuming attractions. Visiting probably only requires between 30 minutes and an hour to do quite well. From the open front doors, guests can head up- or downstairs: I'd recommend starting in the basement where the cables themselves are on live display and the hum of the machinery is most apparent.\n\nThe upstairs section of the museum include displays of tools, explanations of the engineering and some of the key engineers of the system, some of the political and social history behind the lines and more. The view of the shop floor from above (one of the main pictures you'll surely come across if you're researching this place) is even more mesmerizing in person.\n\nSome of the things that you might learn include:\n1) How often cable car brakes wear out;\n2) How the cars' technology has evolved over the years (hint: not much...);\n3) What happens when there's damage to a cable;\n4) What the operators are doing when driving the cars.", "author": "Dennis W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-11-20", "description": "The Cable Car Museum\n\nThe Cable Car Museum is located San Francisco, on Mason and Washington Streets.  Here at the museum you will see the history of Cable Cars and the various companies that were involved with bringing and developing the Cable Car Systems to San Francisco.  It's a very interesting museum.  This was how a part of the mass transportation started in the early years before buses.\n\nBasically what they have developed is an underground cable system that pulls each cable car through the streets of San Francisco.  How this is done is exhibited at the museum with plenty of details....(something to be appreciative of....we've come a long way since the Cable Car).\n\nToday's Cable Car can carry an average of 60 passengers.  Each cars can weight 15,500 lbs. And are 27' 6\" long (Powel and Hyde Cable Cars and Powel and Mason Cable Cars).  The California line Cable cars are 16,800 lbs. And 30' 3\" long.  The weight of the car does not include passengers and operators.  So the cable system that you see at the Cable Car Museum is a fully operational one.  You will see the cables leading into the streets of San Francisco.  \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7HUGEQhazzWHEHOuF9eSdQ?select=Lo3Ns6ut_M7-igAvSvPbnA\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7HUGEQhazzWHEHOuF9eSdQ?select=7a1Vb3oOw1UjNGz2x-tTGw\n\nThis system is required to pull a certain amount (not sure of the exact numbers) cable cars and passengers daily through out San Francisco.  Up the hill, down the hill and it's straight away.  You'll see the major components of a cable car.  \n\nOne of the most important part of the cable car is \"The Grip\".\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7HUGEQhazzWHEHOuF9eSdQ?select=6gNQ1jVDVYHiHhPKZx2Sdg\nThe grip is required to grab the cable below the streets and pull the cable cars through the railroad tracks.  The \"Cable\" travels at a constant 9.5mph and the gripman (operator) uses the grip to pull the car at a desire speed between 0 and 9.5 mph.  They also use the cable as a control method of breaking when going downhill so the car is not out of control and makes it easy to stop at slower speeds.  Parts on the grip usually last for 3 to 4 days and then requires maintenance...so some times you'll see mechanics changing out the grip for a new one.  \n\nEach cable car has 2 truck that it sit on.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/7HUGEQhazzWHEHOuF9eSdQ?select=P6CVXAsyqHamZxpLT5_ikQ\nA \"truck\" consist of 4 wheels that runs on the Cable Car Tracks and is required to hold the payload of the body of the cable car and it's passengers and operators.  Also on the truck is a brake system that is controlled from the body of the cars....front and back.  \n\nSo...you have \"The Grip\", \"Brakes\", \"Trucks\" and of course the emergency brakes.  The emergency brake is a lever on the Cable Car that when engaged will cause the car to come to a sudden stop.\n\nI've posted some pictures of their payment methods, tokens, transfers, coin changer, and some of the operators badges.\n\nThese are some of the basic of how today's cable car works.  To see the whole system and how it was developed is what is very interesting to see at the Cable Car Museum.  \nIt's free, they are open from 10am to 5pm daily (double check before going).  \nIt's clean.\nIt's fun and enjoyable.\nGood for kids and family.\nNo pushy people trying to sell you anything.\nGo as you please and leave with additional knowledge if you don't already know about the Cable Car System.\nNo food is served.\nBathrooms are in the back.\nA 5 star worthy trip.", "author": "Alan L."}

I was a little disappointed by the contents in this museum. Its not a very big building and there is some history to it, but it wasn't what I was expecting.\n\nWhen you walk in you can go downstair to view the underground cogs operating the cables that pull the cable cars. There are some signs and placards that you could read to get information about the origins of the first street cars in San Francisco. Upstairs it gets a little more touristy with the coin-operated machines that depict the 1906 earthquake, the gift shop and the replica cable cars that you can get your picture taken. There is also a large viewing area where you can see the actual cables coming and leaving the building and their corresponding lines. \n\nIt's a good place to burn an hour, but keep your expectations low.", "author": "Khris S."}

And it is FREE so there is no obligation to stay and 'get your money's worth'.\n\nThere are certainly things to see, including the active cable lines, but not much to do. We enjoyed taking family photos sitting in the modified rail car near the entrance, but most of the other displays involve reading about the history of cable cars. This didn't hold the kids' attention for long.\n\nOne of the interesting facts is that even though time marches on, little has changed regarding the care and maintenance of the rail cars. For example, it takes a group of men hours to manually splice and repair a section of cable. All of this done during the wee hours of the morning when the cable cars aren't running. Looking at the photos, the employees look like miners navigating the subterranean depths of the city. Glad I don't have their job.\n\nCable cars are one of the great symbols of San Francisco.

I wish there was more consistency. \n\nThere are old cable cars on display, and an old blueprint of the actual cable mechanism to show you how it worked. \n\nOn the walls are old photos of back when the cable car first started. Most interesting was on the back wall and the story of how the Cable Car was meant to be dismantled, and how they saved it. \n\nUnfortunately, I spent too much time reading this, and EVEN THOUGH the place closes at 6pm, the video of the cable car turns off at 5:30pm. I find this ridiculous. We were sitting right there, and at 5:30, she prompted waddled over and turned it off. \n\nAlso, the souvenir store, already started closing up, as they already covered half the stuff with a tarp. It was only 5:30, and they close at 6!", "author": "Laura C T."}

Just beyond Chinatown (up some more steep hills), it is not so much a museum as the main operating station for the entire cable car network, with 60% of the museum consisting of the actual cable machines themselves and the machine shop.\n\nThe museum is unique in all its noisy and smelly glory, showing you the inner workings of a one-of-a-kind public transport system, including the history of the network and the city and the evolution of the system from its origins to the modern iteration. Oh, and it's free, so stop in and see it.\n\nThe only downside, if there is such a thing, is that it is a rather short visit and that it may not be ideal for small children and anyone not interested in mechanics.\n\nOverall, a very nice visit, and a good spot to catch the cable car back to either downtown or Fisherman's Wharf.", "author": "Jan T."}

Yes, sir. This was why I moved to San Francisco. \"You have arrived,\" the Cable Car Museum told me.

This place holds a fondness in my heart, unrivaled by the budgets and notoriety of the De Young, SF MOMA, Academy of Sciences (though those are all well and good).

I didn't even know this museum existed until the Brakeman on the Powell-Hyde line announced it at the nearby stop.  My traveling buddy and I took one look at each other and jumped off.  It was so worth it!  We learned a lot about the history of cable cars and how at one point they were almost put out of service.  Not only is this a museum, but it is also the barn where cable cars are parked and repaired.  Furthermore, all of the cables are routed through this facility so you can see what the cables look like underground.  You can also see MUNI employees servicing cables and cable cars.  If you didn't appreciate this 125+ year old transportation system before, you will after a trip here.  You can also learn a little about the history of San Francisco and understand the different between street cars versus cable cars.  There is also a gift shop here for all of your cable car related souvenirs.", "author": "Courtney K."}

I wanted to write a little blurb about these little nifty cars, but didn't really find the right place to post my little blurb.  (Checked Muni, couldn't find info, and checked SFTA, only found pricing info).  So it was logical to me, anyway, to use the CCM as a point of reference.\n\nMy Blurb.  \n\nI always thought of the Cable Cars as being more nostalgic than useful.  I would watch the cars pass me by full of folks whom I always assumed to be tourist; and I never ever considered taking a Cable Car to get to points of destination.  \n\nWell, my opinion has changed 180.  I've moved jobs and find myself spending more time downtown...  In the past, I have been forced to take the California 1.  This planned route I believe was created by the evil empire so as to punish those who dwell in areas considered more desirable parts of SF.  In a nutshell, the California 1 is horrible for those who live past Polk St.  The busses are usually full of people packed in like canned sardines.  Most often these busses will pass up those who are waiting at the bus stops.  When I get to the corner of my block and see a cluster of folks, I always no it's a bad day for Muni transit and it's better to walk over to California Street and catch a Cable car.\n\nOkay, off my point here.  \n\nNow that I'm downtown I find I have more transit options, however the one I find most pleasant is the Cable Car line.  I find the passengers to be 50/50 (50% local & 50% tourist), and in all, people are courteous, there's usually a seat available, and unlike the Muni California 1 busses, they do not pack people in like a can of sardines.  Another thing that makes the Cable Car enjoyable is the tourist, dare I say it.  Everyone riding these cars is in a good mood and very excited to ride the world-famous cars, and their mood usually transcends on to the others of the 50 percentile.  Its interesting to hear the conversations between the conductors and the travelers.  I also notice locals are usually generous in giving suggestions or helping with directions to these excited travelers.  \n\nOver all, it's a great experience and one that I now realize I have been missing out.  It has also reminded me that SF is not just a place I call home, but a  beautiful metropolitan city of world travel destination.  I take the cable car as often as possible now.  ;^)", "author": "Cris B."}

What surprised me most about it was that rather than just serve as a rinky-dink ode to the past and a nostalgic transportation system, it was educational about the city.\n\nIt was a relaxing way to start a day of sightseeing and the fact that it was totally central in the city means more people can take advantage of the free resource.

You get to read and learn about the history of the cable cars and see, feel and touch important historical artifacts and really get a true sense of the mechanics of what is  a working historical landmark. The giant pulleys hauling the miles and miles of cable which runs under our city streets are truly magnificent and mesmerizing. \n\nOh yes, almost forgot. There is a particular hot metal, burnt wood smell which permeates the area and once you smell it (It won't give you asthma or make you faint, just buck up, will you?) - you'll recognize that smell on the city streets when a cable car is nearby and the wind is just right. It's the cable car's brake smell, caused by moving cable caught between two blocks of wood. To know that smell is to be a true San Franciscan.\n\nCan't say a bad thing about this place. Oh wait, I CAN - parking. The street parking sucks but then what ELSE is new? I can't blame them for sucky parking. Be patient, and maybe the parking gods will shower you with good karma, like they did for me, and grant you a space a stone's throw from the entrance. Good luck.

You're taken into the heart of the beast:  the smell of motor oil in the air, the roar of generators and turning gears, and the actual cables spinning directly in front of your face.  Lots to discover about the inner-workings of the cable-car system and how it played a role in SF history.  So much (FREE) fun and a perfect place for those Mr. and Ms. Fix-It types who go ga-ga over how things work.  I highly recommend this museum to everyone, locals and tourists alike--it'll leave you with an even deeper appreciation for this fair city!", "author": "Andrea U."}

This is the fully functional central powerhouse of the entire San Francisco cable car system. Every cable car in the city is powered from here, and you can get up close and personal to see how it all works. The place is filled with historical pictures and interesting facts -- who knew some cable cars survived the 1906 earthquake and are still in use today? I didn't. This is a vital part of San Francisco history, and this museum is a great way to appreciate it.", "author": "Jason B."}

So pay some homage to the historic system and visit the Cable Car Museum. The museum, (free!) will remind you why you love it here. The actual cables that run all 10.5 miles of cable car track go through this facility, and they're featured prominently from a vantage point above the machinery. Old cable car stuff and 1906 earthquake photos abound, and, for penny collectors out there, there is a flattened penny machine right in the front door. Tough area for parking and the people running it were fairly grumpy the day I was there (i.e. locking the front door at closing time without telling the many people still inside how to get out), but I highly recommend this place for locals and/or their out-of-towners.", "author": "Tara R."}

Basically , what you will learn in this museum is how the cable car works and the history behind the cable car . You will also get to see how the cable car works . I think the museum is just to make tourists want to take the cable car . Personally , I think this museum is kinda boring .

Nothing much else spectacular about this place beyond that. It's interesting if you want to know how the cable cars are run, but it doesnt really do anything for other than that.

I've lived in SF for a little over a year and have never taken a cable car ride, mostly because it seems like a touristy thing to do. Well, I changed my mind after going to this museum. You will leave with a new appreciation for these cable cars, I guarantee it. We all jumped on one after leaving and ended up chatting with the operator. Turns out that only 4 out of 200 people passed the grueling \"cable car operator\" test which only occurs every 2 years. Anyway, check it out, even if for only for 15 minutes. I would have given 5 stars, but the guy working the gift shop was a REAL dud when we asked some very simple questions regarding the Hyde cable car route.", "author": "S A R A H."}

This building is the Washington/Mason cable car barn and powerhouse which gives you a first hand look how the cables are run and the massive motors that push them through the streets of our city.  The museum carries a thorough history of the cable cars and many exhibits which demonstrate how the mechanics of the whole system works down to the car brakes.  Theres also plenty of information about cable repairs, tools of the trade, and even a display of several historic cable cars.  While I feel there could be a little more information from a locals perspective and the place doesn't take very long to get through, just as the other yelper's stated its free and I've always found it clean.  The whole museum is excellent for the slim budget they must be operating under and I recommend it to everyone who has not been here before.", "author": "Paige C."}
