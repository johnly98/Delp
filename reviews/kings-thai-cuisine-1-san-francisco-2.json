We ordered a couple of #4s, a kind of beef noodles soup, and a tofu and veggie pad Thai. \n\nThe noodle soups taste pretty much the same as I remember-- beefy, rich and slightly spicy.

Its late hours--open till 1:30 AM on Saturdays!\n2. Its central location--right on the main drag, and therefore easy to locate.\n3. It's price to portion ratio. For downtown, prices are very fair for what you get.\n\nI tried the pad see ew with tofu (as always). Delicious. I was craving greasy Thai noodles and these delivered. The rice noodles were fat, the tofu was crisp, and there were some unexpected vegetable additions--baby corn and mushrooms. Let's just say there was none to take home.\n\nSadly, my dining companion was a different story. He's used to restaurants where more ample helpings of meat are offered so, in reading the menu, he was less than enthused. He finally decided on the duck fried rice and ended up leaving some.\n\nI enjoyed the selection of sauces and toppings that are left out on the tables--even found my favorite, crushed peanuts.\n\nIf you want something quick, this may not be a good bet. It was PACKED when I visited and there was a line out the door. There was more than one server attending to us, and it looked like they were doing the best they could, but we still had to wait a while for the food and the check. Also, some of them don't speak the best English so good luck requesting any substitutions/alterations to listed items.\n\nOverall, it was a satisfying meal.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-10-03", "description": "I've lived in SF for 17 years now and have never experienced such rude service from an establishment to date. I initially called and asked to make a delivery order because on Yelp it indicates that they do indeed deliver. I was told by the woman on the phone that they do not deliver. I then proceeded to let them know that it might be a good idea to let Yelp know so that they can correct the information to avoid confusion. I then decided to go ahead and proceed with ordering take out instead, but she rudely hung up on me. I was a bit irked, but I figured perhaps there is a bit of a language barrier, or perhaps she was having a bad day as we all do from time to time. So, I went a head and called back to place and order. I let her know that the menu I have has no numbers and that I will definitely butcher the dish's name so I asked if I may spell it for her and read the description. She said 'yes' and I proceeded to do so. She then kept saying 'number 16? Number 16?' I then re-iterated what I had explained earlier, that the menu had no numbers. She said that's fine and I got dressed to walk over and pick my food. When I arrived they had made the wrong dish. I let her know that this is not what I ordered. I showed her on the menu and then she and the cook looked at me as if I did something terribly rude and offensive. She then asked me what kind of noodles I would like, so in an attempt to try and lighten the mood a bit I smiled and asked what does she recommends and what is her favorite. She looked at the cook like I was trying to be difficult. She then said 'rice noodles' with no smile or eye contact whatsoever. At this point I'm really trying to bite my tongue and just let it be. I patiently waited outside until my food was ready....she then brought out the food and had the audacity to tell me that if I'm unsure about what I want it's best that I just come into the establishment rather than call in the order. At that point I had had enough. I told her I literally spelled out the dish's name and read the description to her. She had the nerve to blame the situation on me rather than take some responsibility for her mistake. The order total was $10.35, I gave her a $20 and said to just give me $7 back in yet another attempt to be nice and cordial. She came back with all my change instead and\nShoved it in my hand. I said, 'I only asked for $7 back, Im trying to tip you.' She just kept walking and ignored me. So I went inside and threw the money on the counter and said they're unbelievable. Zero apologies, zero thank you's, and zero responses to my several attempts to try and be cool about the multiple layers of rudeness I had received. I'm a local musician and eat at all kinds of scrappy hole in the walls with mediocre service..., but I left this place absolutely disgusted and livid. I live in the neighborhood and I am super bummed that they were so freakin' rude. I like to support local businesses and they are a great late night spot typically, but this experience has deterred me from EVER supporting their establishment again, and I will have nothing nice to say about this place when people ask me about it.

It comes out quick and you don't have to wait too long after you place your order. Much like a street stall in Thailand. \n\nThat being said the interior is small and doesn't have too many seats. The service is what it is so don't expect high end service. If you need something flag someone down, they expect you to eat and pay, pretty much how it is in SE Asia as well.\n\nI like to eat here because it is fast and fairly inexpensive.

So no big deal for me\n\nFood: \nPad see ew: I am very particular about this dish and I love it here! Some places make it all liquid-y but not this place. The taste is perfect too, not too sweet and the sauce is cooked right into the noodles, which it should be. Also no noodles were joined together where you had to pull them apart. Right amount of egg and veggies and I love it with tofu\nThai tea is always good here\nFried chicken over fried rice: decent amount of chicken which comes with the sweet and sour chili sauce. Fried rice was good too\n\nNow I know people might say there's better places but when you jus want Thai food from a whole in the wall and the prices are decent and they give you a lot of food then this is the place. Plus no waiting \n\nOh and who could beat that gengki crepes is like two doors down if you don't know what that is, then Yelp it of course :) \n\nAlways such a good night when my fianc\u00e9 brings me here, reminds me of our college years", "author": "Monica G."}

Pad See Ew - with Beef - This is your standard pad see ew, nothing really spectacular about it except that it really hits the spot when you just want some pad see ew and some Chinese broccoli\n3. Yen Ta Fo Noodle Soup - Seafood Noodle Soup that really hits the spot when nursing a hangover. They give plenty of seafood and the broth isn't too salty. I usually order this with flat rice noodles.\n\nI've tried the other beef noodle soups..and even though my friends swear by it, I haven't been overly impressed with them. Perhaps its because I order it for delivery and it isn't super fresh. I would just stick to the basics with this place.\n\nAs a helpful tip, just say NO GO on the crab fried rice.. it's really smelly, which makes me feel like it isn't too fresh.

We walked in through the kitchen/cooking area and sat at the back table.  We had intended to go to a pho place, and the first page of the menu here was all noodle soups, so I figured we would get something on par.  We both ordered the noodle soup (one of the last ones, maybe #14? it had a lot of different seafood in it), a plate of som tum, and a plate of pad see ew.   Food arrived at the table pretty quickly.  \n\nThe soup was alright, nothing to write home about.  The broth didn't have too much flavor, and while there was a good amount of seafood, the soup bowl felt relatively empty.  The pad see ew was better than the worst I've had, but nothing stood out about it.  Noodles and veggies were cooked well, but the flavors didn't really pop.  The som tum was not good.  It was just not spicy at all and a bit sour, and it was missing that crunch that I'm used to - some of it was a bit soft.  Not a good representation of the 'four flavors' that are in most Thai dishes.  Really a disappointment here as som tum is NOT that difficult of a dish to make, especially for a Thai restaurant.  All in all, everything we ate was just a bit mundane.\n\nGuess I've been spoiled with 20baht bags of som tum on the streets of Bangkok, so now $8 for bad som tum spoils my experience.

Obviously they serve your typical Thai restaurant fare, but since it is in the name, we decided to try the noodle soup.\n\nThis was AMAZING. I would describe it as their take on a meaty noodle soup with hot broth, noodles, meats and veggies. Like a pho or chinese noodle soup.\n\nThey offer a variety of different meats to go in the soup. We ordered a combo, which includes sliced beef, beef balls and beef stew, but the stew was the highlight.\n\nAll was good and great until half-way through we found a snail in the soup. This was slightly offputting, but the soup was really that good. However, for the sake of letting the restaurant know they should probably wash their veggies a bit more, we called the waitress over and showed her.\n\nInterestingly, she did not seem to know what to do. We asked if she can do something about it, and she looked confused. She walks away, and 5 minutes later brings back a thai iced tea. I actually thought she did this as an apology to help tide us over until they bring us a replacement, but 10 minutes passes and nothing else happens. In effect she rewarded us with a thai tea for finding a snail in their food. Like finding waldo in a line-up!\n\nWe end up having to flag down a different lady to ask if she can take the old bowl with snail away and just prepare us something else. They eventually did, but it is odd that they did not default to this in the first place. \n\nSnail or no snail, the soup noodles are just that good. I would highly recommend.", "author": "Vince E."}

The flavor was good but the chicken was a tad over-cooked and a little dry. It could have to do with the cook watching TV while he was cooking or that the food sat in the car for 25 minutes while I drove back home. There's no way of knowing.  \n\nExperience:\nThe plus side was I was able to order food from them at 12 midnight when most other Asian Restaurants are closed so for that reason, I still say that the overall experience was good. It's a quick \"go-to\" for \"to-go\" orders before I head home for the day. \n\nOn an another note, the restaurant has changed their name to, \"King's Thai Noodle House\" and it is no longer called, \"King of Thai Noodle House. It is a minor change in the name but it can be a little confusing to someone who isn't familiar with that place, the area and what to look for.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

My own pad thai noodles with prawns looked amazing.  They're really quite artful in arranging the dishes to make them even more appealing.

The proportions was not too big, but can't expect much since it was inexpensive.  about 7.00 a dish.  The Pad See Ew was tasty.  It wasn't as spicy as I thought it might be.  The wok flavor was there and it wasn't too greasy.  I liked it.  The beef noodle soup was also a bit small in proportions.  There wasn't that much meat in the noodles... the beef brisket, beef balls, and thinly white noodles.  I could have counted the pieces of meat, and the strands of noodles. But, no complaints since it was pretty good too.  The soup base flavor was there, but again wasn't that spicy like I expected.  But, I can't really use it against them since there was hot sauce on the table.  \n\nThe place wasn't that clean... sticky floors, chairs, and tables.  The chopsticks and spoon was clean, but I still had to wipe it down with my napkin since everything else was sticky inside.  \n\nThe waitress was attentive.

At the same time, I don't want my sauce to be all thick and gloopy either. The consistency here was stand-out and made me realize what I had been missing my whole Thai-food-eating life. Creamy, rich, but not overwhelming. This was one of the few times I devoured every last drop instead of leaving the sad little puddle of unwanted curry that is often the aftermath of mediocre Thai food. The ingredients were fresh and generous too - the shrimp plump and crisp, vegetables colorful and not overcooked. Heaven.\n\nOther highlights include the pad thai and pad see ew. Wonderful wok-y smoky flavor, big chunks of veggies and meats, and perfectly textured noodles. \n\nThe servers are really friendly here and the atmosphere is simple and no-frills. A humble King indeed.", "author": "Carol C."}

It's the KING of thai (noodle)\n\nNow lets get to the point and start on the food. Proportion wise, get the noodle soups. The noodle soups are HUGE, guaranteed you won't finish it by yourself. The fried rice proportions on the other hand, a little small for my taste but somewhat filling. Now my expertise is fried rice, and I've tried all the specialty fried rices here. The crab meat fried rice, roast duck fried rice, and pineapple fried rice. \n\nNow between the three the best one would easily be the roast duck, followed by the pineapple, and then the crab meat.\n\nThe pineapple fried rice comes off with a few pieces of shrimp and chicken with a salty and sweet flavor. The chicken, however, tastes dry and bland; not working well with the overall taste of the rice. Overall, not bad, but not the best pineapple fried rice I've had.\n\nNow onto the crab meat fried rice. This dish is actually too bland for my taste and is borderline tasteless. However, the crab meat is real, unlike many other places. The downside to real crab meat is that there are small pieces of shell still inside the fried rice. Overall, kinda tasteless and pretty boring of a dish.\n\nBest for last, the roast duck fried rice full of flavor. It has the roast duck flavor well cooked into the rice and the duck pieces were cut into good sizes, making it never too dry for the rice. Overall, this is a must at this restaurant.

The thing I liked this place was that it's open very late... like 3AM. The place had good tasting food and the prices were about average. I ordered the normal Tom Yum Kum with Shrimp because I was craving soup. My other friends ordered noodles, the soup with coconut milk, and fried rice. All-in-all all the food looked really good and tasted really good. I really liked the Tom Yum Kum here. A lot of times I order this soup and it always ends up being too spicy for me to the point where I'm tearing up. But the soup here was fantastic. Spicy enough to give me that kick but at the same time mellow enough where I can handle it. \n\nService: The service was pretty positive overall. The guy was very attentive and always responded quickly to all our requests. \n\nDeco: Kind of tacky... but no biggie. I wasn't a big fan of the bright purple all over the walls.\n\nMusic: It was fun eating to the techno music playing in the background. It just made me want to start dancing and fist pumping. I also wish that there was a disco ball in there. \n\nSo, overall I give this restaurant 4 stars. I only removed a star though because for some reason a spider almost fell inside my soup from the ceiling. However, I caught the spider with my soup spoon. I'm sure though that if the spider fell in the soup I probably would have gotten a meal replacement or something.

The signature dish for me has always been the roast duck noodle soup. But the reasons that have kept me coming back have evaporated. The once rich soup with generous chunks of succulent duck with attached dark roasted skin is now a decidedly flavorless broth with a few meager pieces of I-didn't-know-you-could-slice-duck-this-thin, pale (is there white meat on duck??) meat with a yellow skin (was it boiled?). The other item I got for variety, is their larb with rice. The larb hasn't really changed, but the rice....well, they now pre-mound it on plates in front and when you get it is cold, dry and hard on the outside. Yuck. 3 stars for nostalgia.", "author": "Anthony B."}

Kitchen takes majority of the space, in the front, and you walk past it all to small seating area in the back.  It was very neat, and when you leave, even the cooks say thank you and acknowledge you!  The seating tables on the right are very close to each other, almost as you're with the party next to you.  But we didn't mind that too much, until we got up, and immediately the lady next to us put her dish on our table. o.O!  However, it is very fast service so the turnover is quick.\n\nWas between the nam tok salad and the pad thai, but I decided to try something new-ish.  Nam tok salad is done very differently in different thai restaurants, and sometimes I love it and sometimes I'm not a big fan.  Unfortunately, I was not an entirely big fan of this dish.  The lime dressing was very prominently lime, and lacked more of the spices that I've had in other restaurants, and there was not much cabbage or lettuce to accompany the beef.  The beef itself, however, was cooked delightfully.\n\nMy signif ordered yellow curry, and it was good ole curry.  It also comes with rice and a small cucumber and onion salad (not really pickled, but more sweet).  That itself was the better deal in my opinion.\n\nThe service was nice (CASH ONLY! and they'll also give you change for a dollar if you need help for the meter) and it was a quaint lunch stop (though Maury playing in the background was entertaining and confusing).  If ever feeling up for it, maybe will stop by and actually try that pad thai.", "author": "My An V."}

This just went back and forth for a few minutes until finally, with a pissed-off attitude, the waitress offered to return the dish and make her the pad thai (that supposedly she didn't order). But at this point, we were both hungry and irritated and seeing how my girlfriend didn't want spit in her food, she just ate the dish. \n\nAfter finishing our meal, the waitress gave us the bill which came up to be about $16.50ish.

After taking our orders we waited approximately 15 minutes for our dishes bc it was lunch rush with a packed house. \n\nMy how I LOVE their grilled duck noodle soup. Tasty, salty grilled duck with flat rice noodles in a sweet duck herb soup, making this the best tasting combo of sweet and salt :)\n\nWe also ordered an order of their Thai Fried Rice with veggies and tofu, no meat. If you haven't tried it, it's a must have!! Garlicy rice cooked with sweet basil, carrots, onions, mushrooms, cabbage and egg for an exotic flavor that will have you devouring it in seconds and wanting more. \n\nExcellent service from beginning to end, my boys being well behaved and the sun shining makes today's lunch date THE BEST :)", "author": "Anonymous P."}

The service, however, is terrible (which is why I'm giving 2 stars).\n\nYou can never go wrong with the Yellow Curry (it's mildly spicy), Radnar, Pad Thai, or Fried Chicken over Fried Rice. The Fried Banana and Coconut ice cream is also amazing! \n\nThis place isn't the best for large groups, and has terrible service. I've had so many mix ups on my orders (I do go here frequently) and would have to wait 30+ minutes for a new plate.

(2.8)\n\nThose giving a 5 star rating must have rolled into this place drunk as hell, eat the food, and went to sleep smiling. The thing I love about SF, you can eat korean, chinese, american, filipino, and thai food at 2am. There are a few thai spots open and King of Thai is one of them, not the most recommended but its a recommendable place. It's been years and I have returned with the crew after a drunken night out. \n\nMy friends introduced me this place a few years ago (after a drunken night). The first time i came here was delicious and thought this was a pretty good place to eat. I have returned after a drunken night out with some folks. \n\nThe guys that I was with ordered \"fried rice with fried chicken\" so I'm assuming they give you lots because they were talking about it in the car on the way there and they didn't even bother to look at the menu. I ordered Pineapple fried rice (w/ chicken). Our other friends ordered chicken Phad Thai. \n\nWe were servered right away. The service was on point. Though i didn't think this place had a conservative crowd, the people hear were because we were talking out loud and talking \"PG13\"-ish and everyone would look our way. What do you expect from late 20's to early 30's just leaving the bar and drunk?! geez. Well anyways...\n\nMy Pineapple Fried Rice was ALRIGHT. I only took a few bites because it wasn't as tasteful as I had imagined it to be. It had big chunks of pineapple and shrimp and chicken but it wasn't all that.  It was good but not as tasteful. I had high hopes. I ate some of the \"fried rice and fried chicken\" and THAT WAS OFF THE HOOK. not the fried rice but the fired chicken cutlets tasted like Japanese fried chicken \"karaage\". I love karaage so I can definately eat the chicken on it's own because the fried rice wasn't that crack'n. I ate some Phad Thai and that was good. Normal Phad Thai, i enjoyed it more then my fried rice. \n\nThe portions were HUGE and the price was CHEAP. I swear it was like $5-$6 a plate and a ridiculous amount of food was poured onto the plate. Nothing special about the plating, it was just toppled with food.\n\nI took hella left-overs home and the next morning woke up to eat the left-overs. Uhm.... nothing tasted great (except for the fried chicken!). My stomach hurt from eating the left overs. I felt like i brought home food from a chinese hole in the wall place but instead it was thai food. i hate to waste food but a took a few bites and threw it away. I didn't feel good afterwards. \n\nPrice - DIRT cheap\nPortion - TOO MUCH\nService - on point\nAmbiance - eh, alright\n\nWill I be back? Only if i am drunk as shit and need some greasy food to help me sober up.\n\n\nUntil the next review.....", "author": "Jane A."}

The server was very polite and attentive, and the food was delicious. \n\nI ordered Guay Tiew Lord. Well, not really. I ordered menu item 16, because I have no idea how to pronounce it. But look at what it is, and you will see why I wanted it: Sauteed shrimp, dried shrimp, calamari, ground chicken, bean sprouts, green onion slices, sliced black mushrooms, a sweet black soy sauce, on a bed of flat rice noodles. I mean, yum! I was surprised to discover there was absolutely no heat at all in this dish, so extra points for having food everyone can eat. \n\nMy Lady ordered chicken satay. The chicken was grilled without the little skewers, which made it very easy to eat with a fork or chopsticks, however we preferred. The peanut sauce was seriously delicious, and the lightly pickled diced cucumber ditto. No heat here, either. \n\nOf course we shared both dishes, as we always do in a Thai restaurant. The travel posters were absorbing, and it is always nice to see portraits of the King and Queen. We were both satisfied, spiritually, mentally, and corporeally. \n\nThey are open until 1:00 am, which will be a big plus when we have rushed home from dance class.

I was honestly surprised at how delicious it was. Maybe I was just super hungry, but it definitely hit the spot and I was impressed. And I must add, I am very critical when it comes to Thai curries. \n\nThe only thing stopping me from giving them a 5 star review is because they could have just gotten lucky with this curry.

The only plate I get here at King of Thai is the specialty item #37, fried rice with fried chicken. It is the absolute best plate here, and I get it every single time. No other plate on the menu can even come close to the tremendousness of this plate. It is delicious. Ever since my discovery of this item on the menu in 8th grade, Presidio Middle School, I've been shaking in my boots each time I am about to wolf it down. The fried rice, though very easy to make, is salted lightly; in combination with the fluffy eggs make for sum real yum yum in my tum tum. The chicken is very crispy on the outside, and very tender on the inside. Unlike your regular chicken katsu, the chicken actually has flavor on the inside as well.

Weekends are much better depending on the time you go.  \n\nI decided to drive up to the city this evening and go to this location on the way to pick something up from a friend.  Finding a parking space at 7:30pm was horrendous.  But after deliberation, I finally found a spot adjacent to the restaurant.  The menu items are the same as the other Clement Street location and we ordered Guay Tiew Yan Ta Fo, Pad See Iew beef, and Poh Pier Tod.  The pad see iew was a bit salty for my taste today and I had to drink lots of water to cleanse my taste buds. The noodle soup was just right and the fried egg rolls was still freshly fried when they served it.  It was too much food and we ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow.\n\nOverall, the service was quick, friendly and food came out piping hot, especially if you know how to speak Thai.  The only drawback was the cramped space, tables that did not align well together, and were different heights.  I think this location needs a major overhaul on their flooring and seats, and it feels like a hole in the wall.  But then again, the food is cheap enough not to complain and make a big fuss.

What I do know is that the guy really loves the color purple as in \"let's color the restaurant several different shades of purple because I decree it is a most royal hue.\" The color purple was so prevalent that I swear if you stare at it enough you'll see Oprah Winfrey. Maybe it was an illusion like those \"Magic Eye\" posters. But it makes you think that the King of Thai probably never read Alice Walker's novel or otherwise he may have considered a different color...maybe fuchsia pink. \n\nAnyway, the point is the color draws you into this little restaurant on Clement St. and it works because with all the different little restaurants (several with \"people love us on Yelp\" stickers) adorning the street it can be overwhelming. We chose this one and it was a decent Thai place but I wasn't going ga-ga for it like the locals do in their reviews. \n\nFood:\nI had ordered from the Chef's Special section of the menu and had the Pra-Rarm ($7.75) which came with a choice of chicken, beef, or pork and I chose chicken. Perhaps I should have had beef instead but this dish was just good but not great. The curry peanut sauce that they pour over this dish is pretty good but it didn't really work with the chicken. I also got to try the \"Golden Pumpkin\" plate ($8.45 Seafood style/ $7.75 normally) and this was again good but not great.  The name Golden Pumpkin conjured up anticipation for something regal but the GP was just flat. The best dish of the lunch was the Gang Khew Warn (green curry) at $8.25...i guess you could say it was \"Gang\"-ster (word play). This was served seafood style with shrimp, calimari, imitation crab meat, and sliced fish cakes and was the spicy but not too spicy and was the most flavorful overall. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YYQX-gJhJ6cFzzIhRWjaFA?select=YBgGkrkaVbV3ZwpdwNu4Fg\n\nDrinks:\nAs far as beverages go, apparently the King has digestion problems because when we ordered the Green Hele-Blue Boy Syrup ($2.25) for funsies...it ended up tasting like green pepto-bismol. Take a look: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/YYQX-gJhJ6cFzzIhRWjaFA?select=SyGKGIxnJneGISTQ8voMuA\nThe Thai Iced Tea was good though.\n\n-A couple of final notes. I like how they play up the whole royal theme (or maybe it was coincidence) with the flat screen TV playing \"Shanghai Knights\" starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson. Talk about two people with weird noses. \n-They offer free delivery. \n-Parking is pretty bad. It's hard to find a spot near the restaurant or even just a spot in general. I ended up having to scarf down the three dishes and the Thai Iced Tea to avoid the meter maid's wrath.\n-It's a small place so the bathroom is conjoined with the dining area. It's not too noticeable except the door is a sliding door that's broken. It often took two to three people just to pry it open.\n\nThis is an interesting little place that unfortunately, based on first impressions (fair prices, okay food), was not as majestic as it's name.", "author": "Matthew T."}

Hmm, a bit odd, but also re-assuring to know the food being prepared for you is within your field of vision (not that it's all that big a deal to me, I'm no prick when it comes to interactions with people responsible for my food). The next thing I notice is the interior...purple, lavender, whatever...I thought Barney the dinosaur was responsible for this mess. \n\nOur waitress appeared  shortly after we sat, and came with 4 waters in hand for my friends and I. We ordered 2 plates of Pad Thai. The noodles arrived, and that distinct aroma that is pad thai wafted through my nostrils and  cleared all apprehensive thoughts about the purple, the kitchen being misplaced and Barney the dinosaur. \n\nNeedless to say, the taste surpassed well beyond my expecations.

The thing I liked this place was that it's open very late... like 3AM. The place had good tasting food and the prices were about average. I ordered the normal Tom Yum Kum with Shrimp because I was craving soup. My other friends ordered noodles, the soup with coconut milk, and fried rice. All-in-all all the food looked really good and tasted really good. I really liked the Tom Yum Kum here. A lot of times I order this soup and it always ends up being too spicy for me to the point where I'm tearing up. But the soup here was fantastic. Spicy enough to give me that kick but at the same time mellow enough where I can handle it. \n\nService: The service was pretty positive overall. The guy was very attentive and always responded quickly to all our requests. \n\nDeco: Kind of tacky... but no biggie. I wasn't a big fan of the bright purple all over the walls.\n\nMusic: It was fun eating to the techno music playing in the background. It just made me want to start dancing and fist pumping. I also wish that there was a disco ball in there. \n\nSo, overall I give this restaurant 4 stars. I only removed a star though because for some reason a spider almost fell inside my soup from the ceiling. However, I caught the spider with my soup spoon.

The roasted duck noodle soup was okay. My husband was impressed that they gave us pretty lean pieces of duck meat (instead of pawning off the fatty pieces with skin) and enjoyed the flavor of the soup.

Both versions were quite tasty and each helping was enough to share with 3 people!\n\nPrik King Beef = This is one of our favorite Thai dishes, when it's done well. There are a limited number of ingredients in this dish, so the sauce/flavoring makes this dish. King of Thai's version was excellent, with a generous helping of beef, surrounded by tons of fresh green beans and some other veggies. \n\nGreen Curry (chicken) = I LOVE green curry - it's my favorite of all the Thai curries. King of Thai's was quite flavorful, with just enough coconut milk - not too much, which can be somewhat overwhelming. \n\nRed Curry (chicken) = Not usually my favorite type of curry, but still really good.

The waitresses paid no attention to me and my friend -- two of them were too busy to take order from the SAME table with only one person there.\n\nI ordered my usual Pad Thai and when the food came, my friend and I were shocked -- it was HALF the size as before. I worked out before dinner but that shouldn't affect the perception of the size of Pad Thai of both my friend and I.

Being from the city, each San Franciscan has at least three fail-safe, surefire places to eat aside from fast food...(mines being Gordos, Americana, King of Thai)  The presentation is very simple:\n1.  fried rice\n2.  cucumbers\n3.  egg\n4.  fried chicken breast\n5.  tomato slices\n6.  their sweet and sour sauce\nIt is ironic that a dish that contains only 6 ingredients is often imitated yet has not once been duplicated.  Sure you have more expensive Thai food places out there but none will ever achieve the cult classic status King of Thai has, especially in the hearts of pubescent middle/high schoolers.  The tradition behind King of Thai is rich as it is hearty.  The flaky batter surrounding the chicken breast, dampened by the dousing of sauce followed by a melodramatic sigh is an emotion synonymous with San Francisco.  It is literally  iconic.  You have the rustic Golden Gate Bridge, then you have.....King of Thai on Clement and in every other district.  You cannot escape it.\n\ninvaluable note: If you are on a date with a high maintenance broad and want to eat King of Thai, yet still want to impress your date, there is a King of Thai premium next to the House in North Beach.  The lighting is dim and seductive, menus laminated, waitresses dainty, the bartenders minxes.  Many elder men escape the clutches of their wives for a couple hours to sit by this bar and use 1960's pickup lines.  It is nice to see manners are still around as the bartenders/waitresses politely cover their mouth and tee hee.  I guess this is a sufficient price to pay to receive holy hell when they return home.  The prices are a couple dollars more expensive due to the ambiance, but the point is you can still enjoy a #37 without anyone being the wiser.", "author": "Brian V."}

The woman told me it would be \"ten minutes\" because they were busy.  I left.  \n\nI understand that places get busy, it happens when you have pretty damned good yellow chicken curry.  But, if you aren't going to get someone's food ready in ten minutes, you should tell them that when they place their order.  Or just don't do carry out orders.

The soup was correct but the other dish was NOT green beans, instead it was rice and vegetables which included broccoli, carrots, spinach, mushrooms, cabbage and onions (with absolutely no green beens). When I called to tell them the order was wrong they argued with me insisting  they sent me spicy green beens, I had to repeat more than 12 times that they did not send me spicy green beens. If they had sent me spicy green beens then why would I call and have them take them back? Makes no sense because I really wanted to eat spicy green beens. But they sent bland sauteed mixed vegetables. Finally they said they would send the driver back to pick it up and refund my money. It's unbelievable how EXTREMELY RUDE they were to me since they are the ones who made the mistake. Usually in business it is gracious to admit the mistake (mistakes happen) and give the customer back the money, no biggie, and be nice about it. It's called customer service, and they are in the service industry after all.\n\nWhen the driver (whom I had tipped earlier) came to take the order back and refund my money, was shown that the order was not green beens - he said absolutely nothing. He just gave me back my money and I am the one that said thank you. Well guess what he said? He said, \"we will never deliver to this address again.\"  Can you believe the level of rudeness?

Yet, for the price, and the speed at which the food is prepared, you can't complain. Any time I have a craving for Thai food, this is where I go. While others may branch out to the other King of Thais, I stick with the original; because I'm a food snob like that.\n\nThe staff is always friendly, eager to help, and if they ever do miss something, they're more than willing to correct themselves. I especially love the fact that within a few minutes after ordering (I can't imagine it's ever been more than 10) my food arrives hot and ready to be enjoyed.\n\nClearly, this isn't an upscale place to write home and brag to relatives about. But it's a damn good neighborhood spot that is consistent in its tastiness. Also, you usually get quite a bit of food for the price. I make it a point to try the Pad See Ew at every Thai place I ever go to, and so far this is the best one I've tried. Only downside is if you don't have cash on hand, you better be prepared to run to an ATM. So, If you like Thai food (especially the curries and noodles) give this place a shot.", "author": "Mitchell L."}

Rather than wait another 10-15 minutes we decided to head over to King of Thai NH up the street.\n\nThe menu looked good and who can go wrong with a place that has been rated \"Best Noodles\" by Asia Weekly Mag ;)  It's also interesting to note that their Health Inspection Bill is posted out front with a 91 rating (my guess is that this is REALLY good).  And while I don't mind hitting up hole in the walls for tasty bites, I love it when it's clean too.\n\nWe walked in to a very clean, cafeteria style looking environment.

Guay Tiew Lord (flat rice noodles with shrimp, ground chicken, tofu, egg and mushrooms in sweet black soy) which was served with rice.\n\nThe Tom Kha Gai was one of the best I've had in the city.

One small TV, but changing the channel to a sports program or MTV is super easy with the remote right next to it (Easy enough!). \n\n- Thai Iced Tea: Super sweet and strong. I literally diluted it about 4 times throughout my meal with a little water added every time I took a sip, but really refreshing (especially with all the spices). I probably could have made two drinks from my 1 cup. \n- Pad Thai (chicken): No lemon wedge for you to squeeze, but it already had the citrusy taste to it. Our chicken pad thai came with nicely flavored noodles, chicken, tofu, bean sprouts, green onion, peanuts. \n- Yellow curry (chicken): I'm sad that they did not add a variety of vegetables similar to other Thai restaurants that I've been to. This dish consisted of yellow onions, chicken, and potatoes. There was a little kick of spiciness to it (not too much), but it was delicious and perfect. Not too sweet, not too salty, great with the side of white rice and it even tasted good drenched on top of the pad thai (After one taste of this curry, the pad thai became bland, so eat your noodles first!). This came with a side of pickled cucumber and purple onions too (just a hint of vinegar taste to it). \n\nService was quick and efficient. Sitting inside the restaurant gives you an aroma of spices that will literally tickle your nose. It's small, but we were immediately seated on a Monday night here. Although, I observed many to-go orders that were placed throughout my meal here (not a bad idea if this place gets really busy). \n\nP.S.

This is my comfort food, my favorite go-to restaurant in the City.\n\nIt's a hole in the wall that seats maybe two dozen, but there's always room for me, and almost never a line. The service is kind, and the food warms the soul -- it's authentic, unpretentious, and simple. This place isn't about atmosphere or trendiness. It's not there to be the fanciest, best Thai food in the city. It's about feeding you good food when you need it most, day or night. I can't say the same for the dozen other KoT locations citywide -- even though they share the same menu, the service is what sets #1 apart from the rest.\n\nMy comfort food recommendations:\n5. Guay Tiew Moo Look Chin Pla -- noodles with sliced pork, ground pork, sliced fish cakes, fish balls and bean sprouts in clear chicken soup (you have a choice of noodles -- I suggest egg noodles with this). Light and easy, not too salty.\n16. Guay Thew Lord -- sauteed shrimps ground chicken calamari tofu dried shrimps with white onion, been sprouts black mushroom in sweet black soy sauce and served over steamed dal rice noodles. The sweet soy sauce sets this dish apart from the rest, and is very filling for the days when you're absolutely starving.\n31. Kao Pad Gai Tod deep fried boneless chicken breast over fried rice with egg , white onion, tomatoes, topped with cilantro and cucumber, and served with sweat and sour sauce. Nothing says comfort food like fried rice.\n43. Tom Kha Gai -- Thai style chicken soup with coconut milk, mushroom, galangal, and lemongrass. If you're craving soup, this will give you a spicy kick without the strong acidity of most Thai soups.\n\nAfter twelve years of living off of Clement, I've probably eaten here a hundred times, half of them after midnight.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-29", "description": "Thai food has always been so dear to my heart. On a foggy day in San Francisco, yellow curry with potatoes is a great comfort food dish that warms the heart. Many Thai dishes are light in taste but infused with many flavors. After interviewing the King of Thai chef, I learned that different sauces blend well with different dishes. The papaya salad is a great example of a great spring starter. Thinly slice papaya sliced and mixed with a tart dressing. Below is a review I wrote for the local newspaper I work for. At the end of this blog, I will address more about how restaurateurs approach financing.\n\nIn a city peppered with Thai restaurants, picking one for dinner can be as daunting as making your own pad thai blindfolded. But fear not, just make a beeline to King of Thai on Clement Street. It's a fast casual dining restaurant reflecting chef- owner Anthony Chaichana original intentions of serving affordable Thai cuisine.\n\nDecorated lavender walls, it's hard to miss despite being on eatery row on Clement. As a tribute to the King and Queen of Thailand, gold framed portraits dress the barren back wall. Dressed in purple shirts and expressing an anxious smile, servers scurry around the sixty seat restaurant. Trying not to be overwhelmed by extensive menu and hard to pronounce dishes, focus on choosing key ingredients and the method of cooking from boiling to stir fry\n\nFor starters, the fresh duck salad special ($6.75) stimulates the appetite. Savory duck meat and fat from the skin, the dish is complimented by sprinkles of chopped mints. Raw cabbage, red and green onions provide crunch while the chili- lime dressing adds a tangy flavor. In gang graree ($6.75), sweet chopped onions lay alongside soft buttery potatoes all bathe in a smooth milky yellow curry sauce. A few spoonfuls of curry over the mound of fluffy white rice result in comfort food paradise. Refreshing the plate, a small serving of cucumber salad add crunch and tangy flavor. For flavor thrill seekers, two spoonfuls of vinegar jalepeno from the spice rack will enhance the ride. As their name suggest, the restaurant is famous for their noodles. Beef lovers should try the beef stew noodle-$5.75. Acting as the core of the dish, the sweet flavored soup is extracted from hours of brewing beef meat and bones but more distinctly, the overuse of rock sugar. Taking a bird's eye view of the dish, it looks likes a collection of beef offerings. The beef balls lack flavor, only providing a bouncy texture but the thin slices of beef were flavorful. The best meat ingredient, beef stew pieces feature a coat of gelatinous tendon with a brisket under layer. Soften by the minute, the noodles were nothing spectacular. Bean sprouts provide crunch and wilted spinach add an earthy taste to the otherwise heavy noodle soup. Skip the pork noodle soup -$5.75 (soup simmered with ground and slice pork along with fish cake and balls) which lacks flavor in soup and ingredients.\n\nCrowned the best dish of the night, the koa pad gai tod ($7.25) is all about crunch. Boneless chicken breast coated with a thin batter is fried till gold brown served over a mound of fried rice. Made pungent from eggs, pillow white rice compliments the sweet onions and tomatoes. Dunk the chicken into the sweet and sour sauce as a flavor enhancer. Having dined at other sister locations, I would suggest their pad thai-$6.75. Cooked al dente, the noodles are chewy and seep into their acetous sauce. With a refreshing spicy lime dressing, the papaya salad flavored with dry shrimps and peanuts is a great choice for cooling appetizer-$6.45. With a taffy like texture, the sticky rice and mango dessert end a good meal. For a party of four, the total came out to $11 per person.\n\nAs a new immigrant to the United States in 1994, Chaichana started his first location with loans from friends and maxing out the limit on his credit cards. Despite working long hours, he stay focused with his goal of bringing wok style street food to San Franciscans. His early customers included foreign Thai students and community. By word of mouth, the business became thriving. Also crediting his great people skills, Chaichana said, \"I like to spoil my customers. I give discounts and free desserts to my customers.\" Fourteen years later and six restaurants in his reins, he has continued to serve flavorful dishes while keeping core culinary root taught by his mother.\n\nKing of Thai Noodle is a good value eatery that targets stir fried dishes and rice plates.

Folks, if you like Thai noodles and you like spice, if you haven't eaten a plate of Pad Kee Mao with chicken at King of Thai #1, you haven't lived. I have tried it at the other King of Thais (Kings of Thai?) in the city, and some have been good but #1 on Clement between 7th and 8th does it at a level far above the rest.

Unfortunately, I'm not going to be entirely entertaining or eloquent with it, as I'm tired and have had a long day and really need some sleep right now.  So without any fireworks or further ado:\n\nWe had the pineapple fried rice, the roasted red duck curry, the pad pri king (pork), these sort of stuffed pork and tofu appetizers (the name escapes me).  (Both entrees came with steamed rice as well.)\n\nPortion sizes were just right. (Me and my friend are known to eat very hearty portions, and even we had just a slight bit left over after the meal was done).  I've dined at the other location on Clement and found this location's food to be far superior in the flavor department.\n\nThe price of the meal was standard.  Not expensive, but not particularly inexpensive (leaned closer to inexpensive though).  Totally worth every penny, given the lightning fast service and the quality of the dishes.\n\nI'm a huge fan of Thai cuisine (when it's done well), but unfortunately not many of the Thai restaurants really deliver IMO, as I feel many of them lack a lot of the intricate flavors I like.  This restaurant though packed a lot of complex and thoughtful elements of taste into their food.  I was pleasantly surprised.   Their style almost reminded me of more of a Singaporean/Malaysian/Cambodian style of cooking, as compared to most of the other Thai restaurants I've dined at.   The pad pri king even went so far as to remind my friend and I, of some Korean dishes -- as it had a bit of the Gochujang flavor to it.  Given that we're both fans of spicy food, this worked in the dish's favor.   The duck curry was pretty standard duck curry -- pretty much the same everywhere and pretty hard to screw up.  My only criticism of this was that the duck was maybe a bit too mushy, and not firm enough.  The appetizer was savory.  The pineapple fried rice was quite impressive with a lot of strong flavors and textures -- raisins, cashews, pineapple of course, and the rice was really rich and robust tasting.\n\nService was friendly.  (Being the klutz that I am, I knocked down my water all over myself and the floor, and they totally cleaned it up the area promptly and were completely cool about it.)\n\nThe main criticism of the place is its size.  Luckily we went late at night, so it wasn't crowded and we got a seat.  But if you're there with a large group or when it's busy, it's a super cramped space and super small, so that might be troublesome.  But it just might be worth it for the food.  \n\nRecommended.", "author": "Daniel P."}

He was trying to clear out one of the tables of some previous customers.  There were duck bones left there so the guy used his bare hands to grab them and sweep them into the plastic tub where cleared dishes go.  After he cleared the table, he went to get this old, dirty, greasy towel that had obviously wiped so many other tables before and started wiping the table with it.  Then without even washing his hands after that, proceeded to take a bag of those lovely rice noodles that get served with your meal, and started grabbing them with his hands and rubbing them together so as to free up the noodles so they don't clump.  I'd rather their kitchen be behind doors so I don't see stuff like that.  Ignorance is bliss.", "author": "Kit E."}

This isn't exactly \"Thailand\". But they could at least do a better job of presenting it.. Maybe have the colors of the dish look the same.\n\nIt's alright for a drunken late night, if Nizario's is for some reason closed.", "author": "Mic F."}

It was not the best Thai I've ever had but the food was edible and balanced in flavor while being reasonably affordable.  I had the pad see ew, green curry, pineapple fried rice, and chicken satay.  I would not order the fried rice again (so boring in flavor) but the satay was better than expected (moist and tasty accompanying sauce).  Curry was spicy but good and the pad see ew was tasty but typical.  I would return if I was in a rush, in the neighborhood, and craving Thai.", "author": "sasaw A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-26", "description": "After a long day of apt hunting lunch was late at 1:30 pm.  We walked in (Oooo just saw Zachary B.'s posting that this place is open til 2 am. NICE) and were immediately seated and served.  I still think my favorite Thai place is Vieng Thai in Houston, TX, but I'm sure I'll be adding to that list once I'm an all-out SF transplant.  I had the gang karee, which is the yellow curry with chicken, onion and potatoes.  It was served with sweet and sour pickled cucumber salad.  Pickled cucumber, always sounds funny. Anyways! I thought maybe the dish could've used more color and maybe more vegetables, but that's probably how generations of Thai people have cooked it and who am I as a Chinese person to judge??? The dish was plentiful and flavorful and it definitely fueled my next 4 hours of apt searching.  Most dishes if I remember correctly were around $10.50 I believe. I'll definitely go back for more in the future.", "author": "Jen T."}

This is one of the better spots in sf in my opinion.  Lots more flavor than many other places that just are too bland or over sweetened.  Def. not as good as Thailand, but pretty good nonetheless.  And open late.  If you want to keep it safe, stick with the Pad See Eew, one of the Fried Rice dishes (I like duck fried rice for the flavor), Pad Ka Pao (if you like Basil), or Pad Thai.  Ask for a fried egg on top of your fried rice or Pad Ka Pao.  Adds that extra somethin somethin.", "author": "Dirty S."}

(weird, i know)\nnow a few things...i'm a MAJOR germaphobe so normally i wouldn't eat at an establishment like this without a full body condom. but for some strange reason- lets call it a strange working of the cosmos, i MUST have the tom yum gai (with flat rice noodles, and fried garlic on the side)...i turn my head when the cooks enter and exit the not so pristine bathroom wearing the same gloves they use to cook.\nand the only slightly embarrassing thing about my obsession is that the cooks and the waiters know who we are and scream out \"TOM YUM GAIII!\" everytime we walk in the door.\nKOT makes it with a lot of MSG, because i find myself drinking a gallon of water thereafter, so I'll recommend a better place for healthier TYG later, but still....i don't care. love is blind!

I love the Pad Kee Mao here an my sister always enjoys the number 5 i think? the noodle soup I believe. The service here is either hit or miss too. Sometimes you will have a waitress that completely knows what they are doing and would constantly check like a Nazi if your water/tea needs refilling, while other times the waitress could not give a rat's ass about your dining experience ( If i was choking and nearly dying...that shotty waitress would probably not even strain her neck to turn around and save me-unless maybe I flash a few dollars...I'm not sure).
