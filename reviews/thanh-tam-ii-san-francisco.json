I was doing my normal boutique hopping when hunger pangs started hitting.  Fortunately I was in the Mission--so many choices!  I got excited as the prospect of so many taquerias within my reach.  I started to march down Valencia to the nearest taco joint when I walked by a small Vietnamese restaurant.  I looked at the menu posted outside and saw the menu size and prices--small and respectable, respectively.  I peered through the window to see the interior--a Vietnamese family behind the counter, and a small handful of patrons dining in the cramped space.  It was enough to lure me in.  Thanh Tam is a typical Vietnamese restaurant--weathered, lacking in ambiance, but with a healthy waft of Vietnamese food smells hitting you in the face when you walk in.  \n\nI ordered com thit nuong cha gio, and the plate immediately came out hot and freshly dressed (yes, I'm still talking about food).  The portion size was HUGE.  Everything was fresh and just what I expected.  The egg roll had the rice paper wrapper, which is always a huge bonus for me.  I wolfed down the delicious food, but to my surprise, I couldn't clean my plate--there's a fat girl who lives inside me, and if I can't finish a plate, that means it was BIG.  I paid my tab and walked out of Thanh Tam $12 poorer but exponentially happier.  The only bad thing is that this place will undoubtedly continue to distract me from trying the myriad of great tacos in the Mission.", "author": "Crystal C."}

It's not quite as good as the pho in Little Saigon (I just love Bodega Bistro), but better than a lot of pho outside of Little Saigon.  Great if you're in the hood on a chilly day.\n\nBeef Pho w/ Rare Steak, Beef Ball, Flank: Hit the spot on a rainy winter day!  The large is quite filling with tons of noodles and broth.  I got my reliable trio of meats (since I don't like tripe and tendon).  The beef balls had that satisfying squishiness.  The rare steak wasn't that rare by the time it got to me and was a bit thicker cut than usual, but still tasty.  Wasn't a huge fan of the flank though since it had way more fatty parts than meaty parts.  Broth was on point.", "author": "Adam B."}

I've been a number of times and never needed to wait to be seated since there's ample seating. There's always a few groups eating but takeout is popular as well.\n\nAs for the food, the Bahn Xeo (Vietnamese savory pancake filled with shrimp & bean sprouts and served with lettuce & mint) is delicious and although it's listed under appetizer, it's more than enough food for an entree. The Shrimp & Pork Roll are pretty good as well. \n\nI enjoyed the Grilled Pork Vermicelli w/ Imperial Roll. It does come with a lot of noodles which I couldn't finish. I definitely needed to ask for more fish sauce to soak up the noodles.  \n\nIn terms of the soup, I find them to be a bit lacking. The Pho was decent but didn't have too much variety in terms of the meats (the sliced meat it came with was a bit dry) and the soup also came out room temperature. The Bun Bo Hue looked similar to the pho and was skimpy in terms of what you'd normally expect from the soup. There was no pig's blood as well as all the other meats & veggies that typically come with Bun Bo Hue.\n\nThe staff is friendly.. they speak Vietnamese & Cantonese. There's a t.v. at the front of the restaurant by the cashier so you can likely watch a game if it's on. Street parking in the area is limited so you're better off grabbing an Uber.", "author": "Ruby C."}

Our family used to go to this place as much as we could for comfort Vietnamese food in a no frills environment. We went last night with our two young kids (2 & 6), as we sat down, my 2 year old started handing out chopsticks to all of us. In the process, he knocked over the cheap plastic holder for the chopsticks. The waiter was taking an order in the table next door, turned around and started yelling that \"CHILDREN ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PLAY WITH CHOPSTICKS. IT IS AGAINST RESTAURANT POLICY.\" I was so shocked, first of all, when do you have a POLICY not allowing children to play with chopsticks. Secondly, my son was handing over chopsticks to our family, he was not playing. I tried to explain this to the waiter multiple times, and he didn't seem to care. He kept yelling that children are not allowed to use chopsticks in the restaurant. I had enough, picked up my stuff, my two young kids, and walked out, telling him he has lost customers and I will never come back. This is how he responded, \"I don't care. You go, go go, get lost.\" Yes, DISRESPECTFUL MAN, yelling not only at children but a mother who is there in presence of her two kids. Other customers were all shaking their heads and sympathizing with me. Of course, I had a few choice words for him as I walked out, but didn't unleash my wrath because I had to stay as calm as I could in front of my kids. To the workers and owner of the restaurant: I don't care how good or authentic your food is, i am absolutely DISGUSTED by this human who has no decency and does not treat CHILDREN OR WOMEN with respect. NO ONE COMES TO YOUR RESTAURANT TO PUT UP WITH YOUR TERRIBLE BEHAVIOR. You yelled at my kids in front of other customers for something like chopsticks... you are a terrible person. You say your business is good for kids? NO, it's NOT, YOU LIE!\n\nFYI, I have a photo of this guy, once I figure out how I can post photos, I will add it on Yelp for sure.", "author": "Zoey F."}

For the next 10+ years or so, we would often talk about this place and how amazing their broth was and their grilled beef with vermicelli noodles! \n\nOne day, my mom dug up their business card and did a quick Google search and found their new location!!! We knew we had to pay them a visit again. Now for the last few years, kevins noodle house has been my to go favorite. My boyfriend and mom ordered the pho and I ordered spring rolls since I was too full from eating all day. I did try their pho and soup though and it was still as good as I remembered it to be. We asked for beef on the side but they forgot and accidentally put it in with the soup. The owner was nice enough and gave us two extra plates of beef on the side.

I probably had been to about 30 before this one, and overall, it was a decent experience. \n\nWe ordered a tofu and mixed veggie plate, beef vermicelli, and rare beef flank pho. The veggies were cooked in a light brown sauce with the Asian style fried tofu I love and the pho was probably the LARGEST bowl I have ever gotten (for less than $9!). However, both dishes lacked a lot of flavor, and I found myself adding more sodium-heavy condiments than I would have liked, in attempts to amp up the flavor. I tried the vermicelli and it also seemed to lack some kick, but overall the portions were generous and reasonably priced. I think I was partially disappointed because several SF guides rate this place's pho in the top 10 or so... but I'm guessing part of that is because of the size to price ratio.", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

The first was a 4.5 experience, the other was 3.5, thus the 4-star average you see here. \n\n#1: After a wonderful afternoon of tennis + beers in Dolores Park, took my tennis partner to Thanh Tam for authentic Viet dishes. The restaurant is cozy, with cool lighting and a welcoming atmosphere. Service was quick and friendly. After much deliberation (everything looks so good), decided on sesame beef and shrimp over rice, as well as bbq pork and egg roll over vermicelli (bun). Both dishes  had pretty good portion and lots of flavor. Not much in the spice department, but no worries: chili sauce in ketchup bottles in close reach! Also 100% asked for jalape\u00f1os on the side, which were soon provided. We ended up quite satisfied with our dishes. I would give that experience a 4.5, but that could have been influenced by the pleasure of my company :)\n\n#2: I was on the BART back from work (Alameda by way of Fruitvale) and suddenly had a major craving for banh mi. Nothing else could have satiated this desire, so I called Thanh Tam as soon as I hit my station, and ordered the banh mi with everything (pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, jalape\u00f1os, mayo, soy sauce, onions) minus cucumber. I didn't really pick up the onion or soy sauce, but the meat was decent and the sandwich was ultimately enjoyable. However, their $10 minimum was unexpected / not pleasantly stated to me, and the walk home / back / home was less than savory. With that said, at $6.47 after tax, I could see myself warming up to the idea of take-out banh mi from here in the future.\n\nAll in all, a wonderful family-run restaurant with a very local vibe, as opposed to some of the other 'trendy' Viet restaurants in the Mission.

So we stopped in at Thanh Tam II on Valencia as it's super close to our church. \n\nI've only dined at Thanh Tam II once, way back in the day, and I didn't really remember how cramped it is, but now I've noted this. We walked in to the restaurant to the shrill voice of a woman loudly and rapidly speaking Vietnamese, guessed at a place to sit, and began to browse the menu. \n\nI chose Thanh Tam out of the other locations in the area because I remembered that they have the option of thick noodles in their pho. Unfortunately, the only flat noodles they had were \"old\", per our waiter, and so they weren't an option. Why would you have old noodles? Just throw them away if that's the case, or, as a popular Mission restaurant, be stocked with the ingredients to one of your main dishes.\n\nMy mom, always the optomist, ordered a tofu salad and raved about it for the rest of the night. I got the Rare Steak Pho which was bland and had to be drowned with Sriracha, the jalapenos that were served alongside were old, or had been cut the previous day and were drying out and whiteish. When I went to use the restroom, I noticed all the Imperial rolls waiting on a tray to be fried, right next to the restroom, um, okay, yea, that seems sanitary. \n\nFinally, when our bill came, we noticed that the total was hiked up from what should have been $17.89, to $24.95. So I had to show our waiter and the shrill woman from earlier the error, which was corrected.

With Little Saigon just one BART station away, I would be hard pressed to make a return visit here based on what I tried on a lonely weeknight when I was perusing their fairly robust menu on a relatively busy evening. When hamstrung by indecision, I tend to go for the predictable and ordered the $6.75 Goi Cuon (Spring & Pork Rolls) (photo: http://bit.ly/1kli8ke).\n\nIt wasn't terrible but it wasn't very fresh-tasting either. The peanut sauce was its only saving grace. For my main dish, I went for the $9.95 large bowl of Pho Dac Biet (Special Combination Beef Noodle Soup) (photo: http://bit.ly/1huzzic). It contained all the right ingredients - the beef balls, the flank steak, even the tripe - but it was done in by the watery broth which didn't sustain any of the meaty flavor. Like ramen, pho is an artfully satisfying soup when properly executed, but when prepared with indifference, well, you can almost taste the shrug in every slurp. I'm sorry to say that the service matched the quality of the pho. Just not a memorable meal here.\n\nFOOD - 2 stars...spring rolls taste flat but nothing compared to the pho\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...nothing too memorable about the space\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...nothing wrong with the speed but a sense of ennui surfaced\nTOTAL - 2 stars...packing my bags and leaving for Little Saigon", "author": "Ed U."}

When my friend and I entered the restaurant, we were directed to sit at a table that had not been cleaned after the last customers. Luckily there were only dirty cups (and not half-eaten food) but that was super unwelcoming.\n\nThe waiter was quick to take our order and bring our food, but the food itself was mediocre. We ordered spring rolls and pho in beef broth. The spring rolls looked fine, but I can't put my finger on what was wrong with them. Maybe it was the dryness or the rubbery texture of the skin that did not taste fresh. The peanut sauce tasted starchy too.\n\nThe beef broth tasted artificial and I realized that maybe I should have tried the chicken broth instead. They actually give you a LOT of noodles and meat for a small size order, so that's the only awesome part of this restaurant. The beef was incredibly dry which made it difficult to eat. By the end, I was full but not satisfied. \n\nWe had to flag down our waiter to get the bill and as soon as that was done, I made a dash for the door. I might come back because it's so close and open relatively late, but I'm better off traveling in the other direction towards the Sunset District.", "author": "Stefanie C."}

Although.... when we were done with this place and walked a few doors down... there was an elegant pho restaurant called Mau that looked clean and inviting (yes, I was pissed). lol anyways, this place sucks. Really sucks. The pho is overly salty and it doesn't come with the usual garnishes: no basils! Only bean sprouts. Wth. The only plus was it came with a good amount of meat. My best friend got the bun bo hue, which is typically spicy, but stated there was zero spice + there was a hair in her soup! Also, I don't know if y'all feel weirded out by this, but they keep glasses of water pre-filled in the fridge. So when you come, they just grab one and serve it to you.

The girl who sits up at the register is a classic example of someone who is way hotter in her head than she is in real life. I've been to this restaurant a few times now (not going back!) and she couldn't be less happy to be there - I'd feel sorry for her if she weren't such a jerk.\n\nThis isn't an expensive restaurant (~$10 for a small pho) but it's not a great deal either given the quality and quantity of food - super skimpy on the protein, flaccid veggies and even small portions of noodles. To compare, a Turtle Tower pho is well worth being a $35 dish if Thanh Tam's sad phos are selling for $10.", "author": "Janice J."}

This place seemed a bit more reasonably priced than the others, so we came here.\n\nI got the rare beef pho. The veggies that came first were obviously not fresh. The second warning sign was how quickly the pho came out. It came out within 5 minutes of me ordering it. Way too fast for pho. Evidently not freshly made, most likely pre-made and just re-warmed. The broth was very bland and not impressive. The \"rare beef\" was not rare. I hate that they put it in the soup without asking me. Usually they ask if you want it on the side - and I always want it on the side. The fact that they put it in the soup before serving it to me completely defeated the \"rare\" purpose.\n\nWas it inedible? No. But would I return for another try? Probably not.\n\nThere are way more choices in the area. Maybe not many more Vietnamese choices, but I rather go further for a better pho.", "author": "Junel S."}

I spent 9 days in the middle of a desert and after all that, I'm sick of eating steak, bacon (I know, I know shut up) and beef jerky.

Cac dam even for take out it was pretty big. I couldn't finish it. They definitely don't skimp with the meat. This may sound weird, but I liked the fact that they boxed up the noodles in a clear ,flat take out container as opposed to most Viet places that will squash your noodles into a Chinese take out box. Why does this even matter? Well my noodles didn't end up sticking upright in a cube formation, that's why! \nStandard condiments were given, basil, bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos, lime, etc. I don't know if it was just because I just came back from the desert or something but the broth was extremely satisfying on its own (without the noodles). \n\nSplit an order of cha gio. Decent, but I felt it should have been a little crispier. Also, the nuoc mam was on the sweeter side, but still slightly bland.

The first time I had the grilled pork and fried spring roll vermicelli dish, and the second time I had the beef ball pho. My girlfriend had the rare flank steak pho both times, and both times we had the shrimp and pork spring roll appetizer.\n\nSpring Roll Appetizer - Plump, fresh, and delicious. Really satisfying spring rolls served with a typical peanut sauce on the side. A good appetizer for two, or a nice light appetizer for four (with two decently sized spring rolls cut in half).\n\nPork and Fried Spring Roll Vermicelli - One of my favorite \"Pho restaurant\" dishes. Yummy grilled pork, and crunchy rolls. Hard to mess up, really. This one did not disappoint.\n\nPho dishes (Beef Ball and Rare Beef) - Not the best Pho I've had, but the price is right. Broth may be a bit on the sweet side for some, but I found it to be flavorful. Really hit the spot. I'd say the rare beef version is the superior dish. We've only tried the \"medium\" size (there is also a large version), but it was more than enough food for one person.\n\nAtmosphere - The first time we visited it was cramped and smokey (from the BBQ in the kitchen), but was kind of a fun atmosphere because of it. The second time was a quiet Saturday afternoon with barely anyone else in the restaurant. A very small establishment.\n\nService - Average. Had to flag down a server behind the counter for refills, but that's about the worst we could say. Wait staff is friendly. Kinda adds to the very laid-back atmosphere.\n\nOverall, I could see myself returning to this restaurant once again. You can get a nice bowl of food and a drink for around $10.

If you are in the mood for vietnamese, there is so much good restaurant around the city besides this one. But if you are in the mood for vietnamese and happened to be on Valencia St without any means of transportation then I say, better changed that mood to Mexican. \n\nAnd why do I dislike this restaurant so much? You may ask.. well the food was so salty. The only things that I liked here was their beverage - Thai iced tea... The crab and asparagus soup tasted like it has been sitting at the kitchen for days and lastly when they say grilled meat, they smother it with salt.

HOWEVER, if you're a vegetarian in search of pho, don't bother.\n\nI had two bizarre experiences here regarding their vegetarian pho.  First, I noticed that their menu had a \"tofu and vegetable\" pho, but it only came with chicken broth.  I asked the waitress if they had an option with vegetarian broth, and she said yes but told me that if I wanted it, I had to order a large.  When I asked for an explanation of this unusual rule, she said, \"That's just the way it is.\"  When I asked, \"But why???\", she just repeated herself and gave me a look that made it clear she really could not care less.  I knew I wouldn't get anywhere trying to negotiate, so I just ordered the large.  It tasted fine.\n\nIn the second encounter, I called to order the veggie pho for takeout.  The guy on the phone didn't impose the bizarre \"large only\" rule, but he did say, \"You know our vegetable broth comes from a can, right?\"  Uh, no, I didn't know that.  I ordered it anyway out of hunger and desperation.  Although the broth surely came from a can the previous time I ate it, somehow the knowledge of the canned broth made it taste like crap to me.  \n\nI guess if you don't care about canned broth and/or being subject to tyrannical rules regarding the size of your pho, then order it.

(The foods that I tried, I haven't tried the entire menu).\n\nThe quail is delicious; all of their soups are extremely flavorful and just plain tasty (better on a cold San Francisco night).\nThe crispy Style Chow Mein was very nice and crispy. (plenty to share with two people, if you are watching your weight, as I am).\nThe Grilled Beef and Egg roll noodle was very different to any other noodle dish that I've tried. It was flavorful, aromatic and a delight. (again, plenty for two)\n\nNow, don't think their food is design to dazzle you visually (in my opinion)...and their restaurant front isn't very inviting. But my grandmother would tell your to f...k yourself if that is only reason why you didn't try a place.

It was hot and sweaty inside, quite loud, and a very chill and laid back atmosphere that was pleasantly promising for some good cheap eats. \nUpon closer inspection of the menu it seemed to be a whole lot of your standard Chinese food restaurant offerings so we went with Tofu Hot and Sour Soup and a BBQ pork & imperial roll vermicelli noodle bowl. The noodle bowl was underwhelming and went largely ignored but OMG that was some of the best hot and sour soup I've ever had!! We were literally competing for the last slurp! It would've been even tastier if it was served with real porcelain soup spoons, not flimsy plastic ones, but given the environment and price point, it was all good. \nI really appreciate the large assortment of sauces on every table. \nI would probably not seek out this place again amongst all of the other fine Vietnamese restaurants in the city.", "author": "Libra J."}

So, I ordered a medium bowl of steak & tripe pho (my favorite) w/the steak on the side (so it's not overcooked).  \n\nThe pho came quickly.  My immediate reaction was that it was kinda small -- even for a med sized pho - and that there wasn't much meat (steak or tripe).  Only a few slivers of tripe and 5 slices of steak for $7.95.  Came w/the side plate of basil, bean sprouts, sliced peppers and a wedge of lemon (instead of lime).  The flavor of the broth was very good and tasted as it should, but I was still hungry after finishing the bowl.\n\nService after the pho was delivered was indifferent.  After I was done, I had to walk back to the counter where the waitress was \"busy\" reading texts or emails on her phone.  I'm usually pretty good about tipping, especially at Asian restaurants, but I didn't give her a tip because of that. \n\nPoor service but decent food is apparently a hallmark of this restaurant. which would rate 3 stars, but the relatively high price and small serving size drop it a notch in my book. \n\nSo, 2 stars from me because I've definitely experienced better but if you're in the mood for pho and are in the area, you should be satisfied w/the quality of the dish but, if you're hungry, order a large bowl for a buck more just to make sure you get enough to eat.", "author": "Martin C."}

They're at least as tasty, know how to leave the peanuts off, and do more accurate deliveries.\n\nOriginal review:\n\nThe only place I know of that will deliver me pho.  I alternate between the special combination pho and the rice vermicelli with grilled shrimp and egg roll.  Christ, that's good.  They tell me they use gluten-free rice paper for the egg rolls, which I will presume to be true because my tummy doesn't hurt after eating here.  We've had some miscommunication in the past about my need for no peanuts on my food, but they have served me a new bowl of food minus the peanuts when they've brought me a death bowl by accident.\n\nAnd yeah, the service here isn't awesome, but I haven't had a problem with it.

My tone  conveyed accusation, though was also expository. \n\nAfter a 20 second delay, instead of bringing me a beer, the owner asked me how he could know that I didn't drop the container, which hypothesized I was in error for complaining about damaged containers (indeed the container looked like it had been sabotaged).  I asked the manager why I would complain about a damaged container if I had dropped it myself, and if he was calling me a liar.  There was no beer served.  Then the dinner I had brought over in transferred container was dropped by my clumsiness onto the floor.   I thought I would leave the restaurant without the beer I wanted;  I ended up leaving without my dinner as well.  There was no offer to replace my spilled food.\n\n\nPerhaps I would not be inflamed if I had not had civil rights violated by san francisco police in recent history, whose violence considering context and evidence that was available to them could only be judged as paradigmatic.  There is a police station across the street from this viet namese restaurant.   Incidentally, I am looking for a lawyer to assist me in organizing some form of retaliatory legal action against members of the police department, the sheriff's department, and some legal officers.  \n\nI suppose when forthright communications fail to willful evasions and malpractice of state-empowered groups it's yelp or bruce wayne.", "author": "Nicholas B."}

Their chicken and seafood soups are really good as well, although not as excellent as the pho.

Felix's parents are both ethnic Chinese peeps who lived in Vietnam for a while.  Felix, like me, was lucky enough to grow up eating Vietnamese food.  \n\nToday has been very cold and the beers I had this afternoon have worn off leaving me colder than cold and in the mood for some noodle soup.  I have to agree with most of the posts about Thanh Tam II - the food is by far sub-par and the service is not great - however, I live in the Mission and this is one of my default places for inexpensive Vietnamese food.  \n\nThey can be a little heavy handed on the msg (mostly in noodle soups) but for the most part the experience is fulfilling.  Today's Mi Won Ton Hai San - egg noodle soup with wontons and seafood - hit the spot.  The msg was not overwhelming and the soup not only warmed me up but I enjoyed it in the process.  Felix had the Bun Thit Nuong Chay Gio - Vermicelli with BBQ Pork and Imperial Rolls - which he enjoyed but the pork was strange (which I've noticed in the past.)  \n\nFrom past experience: the fried squid and the imperial rolls (fried egg rolls) are good.", "author": "Nicole N."}

I stopped by for a late lunch today, after a long hiatus from my last visit, and had a pretty disappointing experience. The dining room was a mess, it took the owner a while to notice me and take my order. She may have been in a bad mood, as she was pretty curt with me, and I just felt negative vibes from her. \n\nDespite the experience, the iced coffee was a delicious as I remember, and my grilled shrimp & pork over cold noodle was yummy. Lovely char on the shrimp, but not chewy and tender grilled pork with lots of garlic and peanuts on top. I still maintain good for takeout, but I don't think I'll be popping in to dine ever. :(\n-----------------------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\ni've been eating at thanh tam on and off since it opened. i used to come weekly, and sometimes even on the weekends. i feel i've patronized this place enough to figure out what works and what doesn't.\n\nthanh tam knows how to grill meat. order anything with grilled meat and it will arrive beautifully charred on the edges and carmelized, as grilled meat should. that said, any of the cold noodle (bun) dishes with grilled pork are very tasty. if you can, stick with grilled pork -- it's their specialty. i'm not crazy about the 5spice chicken or grilled beef, and have had a rogue bowl of bun with \"warm\" noodles, that was just wrong. my personal fave is bun with grilled pork & shrimp -- yum!\n\na few of the appetizers and specialty dishes are hits and kick my ass hard.\napps:\n- shrimp & pork spring roll, vegetarian spring roll (look under veg dishes). the peanut sauce w/a little chili added is too good.\n- fried wontons\n- fried quail (my friend swears by this)\n- salt & pepper squid (tender, salty & spicy -- sublime when it's done right)\n- vietnamese pancake w/mint & lettuce\n\nsalads: any of the beef salads with a squeeze of lemon\n\nsoup: most of the soups won't knock your socks off, but they're okay, and filling. try the westlake soup.\n\nentrees:\n- any of the grilled pork dishes under the vietnamese specialty section\n- butter garlic chow mein under vegetarian (garlicky!)\n\ndrinks:\n- the iced coffee is the bomb, and i cannot get enough\n- the lemon soda can be sweet, but dilute it on a hot day and it's very refreshing\n\na few observations and expectations:\n- avoid the chinese dishes (they're mediocre and often bland)\n- dishes can be inconsistent especially when the owner is not around\n- it's not a true pho joint, so i don't expect fireworks in this area, but most folks come here just for pho (although the beef stew is very good)\n- the bathroom is always clean\n\nthanh tam is a family-run restaurant, so do not have mission hipster expectations when dining here. the owner's son runs the dining room, her photo watches over the restaurant, and her niece is pictured on the menu (a little factoid). service can sometimes be slow, and not totally on top of their game, but i forgive them for these shortcomings. they've always served a good meal, and it doesn't pretend to be what it is not.\n\ni liken this place to a real neighborhood, getting-to-know-you kind of place. i often run into friends here, and sometimes meet new people. that's rare on valencia, these days.", "author": "Antoi C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-03", "description": "I can think of few things more appealing than pho when I'm feeling under the weather.  Whether my lethargy is from a simple lack of sleep, a nasty hangover, or the common cold, sitting down to a steaming bowl of broth redolent of that magical combination of fish sauce and lemongrass makes me sigh with relief.  Now this may not be the superlative \"best\" pho out there; this distinction seems to be a point of contention amongst the pho lovers out there (personally, my loyalty lies with Turtle Tower), but the pho at Thanh Tam is pretty satisfying regardless.  I have yet to try anything else aside from the chicken pho/pho ga (I think its called \"shredded chicken noodle soup\" on this menu) so this review is primarily for that, although I have been tempted by their other offerings.  Serving sizes are large;I have yet to finish the medium bowl, and it comes with the requisite assortment of bean sprouts, Thai basil, lemon wedges, and slices of Jalape\u00f1o (standard sauces one might expect at a Vietnamese restaurant are also on the table).\n\nMy main quibble with Thanh Tam II lies in the service, which seems to echo throughout others reviews of this restaurant.  The last time I ate here (last night) the staff started to turn away customers at 9 PM, despite having their posted hours of business listed as not closing til 10.  We were the last ones there at 9:30 and I felt a bit rushed, but it wasn't a deal breaker for me.  Otherwise (and on other occasions) I've found that the staff here do an acceptable job, though without any flourish that one might expect from a more upscale joint.  Honestly though, I kind of appreciate the hands-off approach they take here service wise, I'm here to eat my food, not to chat it up with the waiter/waitress.  The ambiance is so-so, not remarkable one way or another.  \n\nBonus point: they scored 92 (out of 100) on their restaurant inspection, which isn't perfect, but certainly hasn't skeeved me out from returning (and is a few points higher than my beloved Turtle Tower at 88). \n\nBottom line: come here expecting good food with relatively slow but otherwise unremarkable (hands-off?) service and you'll leave satisfied.  Get the chicken pho!", "author": "Nicole P."}

I get take-out from here a lot (okay, I live upstairs...it's just so damned convenient!), and some things are definitely better than others.\n\nThe good:\n- curry tofu. The tofu is a good spongy texture and soaks up sauce perfectly. The sauce is flavorful, has the right amount of spice, and the dish has a good assortment of veggies.\n- vermicelli with grilled chicken and egg rolls. Tasty chicken (dark meat, which I prefer, but not too fatty), nicely crispy pork \"egg rolls\" (imperial rolls), an allover good combination of meat, rolls, noodles and lettuce/cucumber.\n\nThe not-so-good:\n- The grilled pork (tried with vermicelli and alone) is just too fatty/greasy for me.\n- spicy chicken with lemongrass. It's okay, but not as flavorful as it should be, and doesn't hold a candle to Sunflower across the street.\n\nThe menu is ridiculously and needlessly huge, given that the \"Vietnamese Style BBQ Meat\" section is mostly a repeat of the \"BBQ Meat Vermicelli Noodle\" section, except over rice rather than noodles. I find that more and more when I order from here, I really only get the \"good\" items listed above. The taller half also orders and enjoys the Combination Wonton Soup, which I think is okay, but a little salty.

For me the ultimate objective for lunch is to get something good and cheap to eat, this place takes care of both those key requirements.\n\nThe options on the food menu is your typical vietnamese items, I mean if you want Pho, five spice herb chicken, vietnamase rolls, etc... you get the point they probably have it.  \n\nThe one killer item though that we always get and come back to, has got to be the appetizer item ' shrimp lobster sugar cane roll'  something along that line.   Just check under the appetizer section and look for those elements you can't miss it.  Anywho,  they bring out a bowl of hot water which is then followed by a stack of dry rice transluscent paper.  Then the ingredients follow..  shrimp lobster meat, vermicelli, mint, basil, jooeaned carrots, fish sauce, crushed peanuts.... the ingredients are all separated.    Oh you know where I'm going with this......   yeah, so the dry rice paper is dipped into the water to make the shell of the roll, followed by the ingredients of your choice...  you make it, if you got skills you can make a good wrap, if not the shit slips out of your hands when you eat.  In either case, that shit is off the hook!

I get the large pho dac biet most of the time. I can probably have two of these. Lately I've been ordering up a storm with rice plates. The grilled pork here is pretty awesome. I haven't been disappointed yet.", "author": "Young T."}
