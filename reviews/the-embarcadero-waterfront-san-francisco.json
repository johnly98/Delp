Walking is much better than being in a crowded, smelly and around annoying people on MUNI. On top of that, I get my steps in a a good amount of exercise. \n\nWalking in the morning you its all business. People all walking, biking, skateboarding, ect to work. There are the runners who get their morning cardio in and considering it is staying dark in the morning I feel relatively safe. People just do their thing and you can just do yours. When I'm lucky I get get to see the sun rising and get some awesome views of the bay.\n\nGoing home, there are a lot of people (obviously). Depending on the time of the year, during Giants games it can get a lot more crowded. Still a better option compared to MUNI. One can time making his or her bus or BART train, rather than MUNI when God knows when that shows.\n\nI like walking along this waterfront.

Pier 39 is the busiest of all the piers. You'll find the welcome center at the second floor. \n\nNext stop is the fisherman's wharf, boudin bakery and lastly, ghiardelli marketplace. \n\nThis is my kind of place to hang around. So much to see and to do mostly for free.

Never have I devoted so much time to the Embarcadero Waterfront as I did on a recent trip with my (also Pokemon-obsessed) mother.\n\nIt's a great place, as it turns out, a lovely walk by the water encompassing a nice range of San Francisco sights. The stroll is free and rich with municipal flavor, and there are always plenty of people around. The Ferry Building is worth checking out--I've been there a number of times, this last trip for a lovely lunch at Hog Island Oyster Co.--and I can't think of a more pleasant way to burn off some food tourism calories than a long walk by the water. We walked back and forth along the Embarcadero, mostly between the Ferry Building and Cupid's Spawn--a huge bow and arrow sculpture that's pretty damn cheesy but kind of sweet, and also a Charmander nest.\n\nBecause, of course, the Embarcadero is littered with Pokemon.

The waterfront's total distance is about 2.5 miles and is popular with runners, joggers, walkers, pet-owners, families, tourists, and panhandlers.\n\nWhen the weather is nice (in other words, not foggy), the Embarcadero Waterfront provides some of the best views of San Francisco Bay.  Best of all, it's free.\n\nI think the best views and pictures can be had on the strip closest to the Ferry Building.  When the Ferry Plaza Farmers Market is going on, there is quite a bit of activity and it's a lot of fun.  You can shop, try unique food and drink, listen to live music from local artists, or have a seat at one of the Ferry Building's restaurants or cafes' bay-side patios.  It's relaxing and picturesque.\n\nThe Ferry Building isn't too far from the Bay Bridge itself.  Therefore, pictures of the bridge (or pictures with the bridge in the background) usually turn out great.  If you walk towards the bridge from the Ferry Building, there's a long pier (Pier 14) which runs far out into the bay.  It makes for some additional excellent photo ops.\n\nThe Embarcadero Waterfront is easily accessible by foot and public transit.  If traveling by car, metered street parking is available directly along the waterfront.  There are also various pay lots (parking garages) available a few blocks west into the city.  You can check the Ferry Building's web site for details and directions to some of these garages.\n\nWhen you visit, remember to bring sunglasses, a windbreaker, and a camera.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Not to mention, the array of Michelin rated restaurants lined along the piers, locally produced farmers showcasing the freshest of ingredients, and also the various special events that take place here such as America's Cup, multiple marathons, and even charitable fundraisers. \n\nLet me break it down a bit more. At one point, The Embarcadero Waterfront was one of the busiest areas of foot traffic in the WORLD. Only the Grand Central Terminal in NY and Charing Cross Station in London were just as busy. With that said, the waterfront was kind of a big deal. During WWII, The Waterfront was a military logistics center and was a major contributor to the Pacific region. \n\nThe Embarcadero Waterfront, since then, has now been recognized as a historic district and is proudly one of San Francisco's finest attractions. \n\nWith such a rich history, it's no wonder that people from all around the world seek to visit its alluring waters. \n\nSoooooooooooo...\n\nAs I sit here at the dock of the bay... \n\nI don't mind wasting my time.", "author": "Ann S."}

Caen could build or destroy a local business with just one item, coined words like \"beatnik\" and \"Baghdad-by-the-Bay\", and was credited (blamed?) for getting his best friend Willie Brown elected mayor.  Fitting, then, to name SF's greatest waterfront walk for her greatest newspaper writer . . .\n\nMe?  When I worked on Market Street, I would gladly walk the 15 minutes to get to a bench at the Ferry Building, near Pier 7, or on 7 itself.  I spent many lunchtimes there.  And I wonder what song the Ferry Building bells will play at 12:00 today.  As for lately, one of our family Christmas photos was taken at the tourist spot written of above.  My daughter jumped from box to box near the Java Cafe.  All in good fun, sometimes even with good weather.\n\nJust do it.", "author": "Ron L."}

I've been riding my Trikke around here for the last 6 years.  Everytime I ride is it's always been a different experience, but the view of the bay has always been beautiful!!\n\nBecause it's a long strip of flat land, you'll always find many joggers, bicyclists, free-runners, and Trikke riders like me weaving through the crowd of FiDi workers during the week and tourists on the weekends.  It's definitely a mixed bag of people that visit there everyday.\n\nThe Embarcadero ideally connects many neighborhoods which makes for an awesome walk:\n\n-From the South end you have SOMA which has AT&T Park, FarmerBrown's Little Skillet, and Red's Java House.\n\n-The heart of the waterfront has the Ferry Building and the FiDi along with Pier 23, TCHO, Teatro Zinzani, and Fog City Diner.\n\n-And at the North end you have Pier 39, Fisherman's Wharf, and Ghirardelli Square with gems such as Buena Vista Cafe and Tanguito.\n\nYou can literally use The Embarcadero as your expressway to experience the best of what San Francisco has to offer whether you're a tourist or a local.  So many stops along the way you can literally spend a whole weekend covering each part of it.\n\nIf you're ever around The Embarcadero and you find me riding around on my Trikke (http://www.yelp.com/user_photos?selected=upYRyyDLMpoweNoyORPtNQ&userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw), please feel free to stop me and say hi or \"I saw you on yelp!\"  See you there!!!", "author": "Rodney H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-27", "description": "I've been around long enough to remember driving along the old Embarcadero Freeway. I'd get on at the end of Broadway and that big ugly roadway would take me to I-80 and points beyond. I even participated in a bike ride on the top deck, which was closed for the occasion. Then the 1989 Earthquake happened and opened up the waterfront view. The result is a gorgeous promenade, a revived Ferry Building, Pac Bell Park at one end (Go Giants!), and stunning Bay Bridge accented water view that I would have never previously imagined. \n\nAnd here's today's Historical Footnote: \n\nThe Embarcadero was constructed atop an engineered seawall on reclaimed land, and derives its name from the Spanish verb embarcar, meaning \"to embark\". During World War II, San Francisco's waterfront became a military logistics center; troops, equipment and supplies left the Port in support of the Pacific theater. Almost every pier and wharf was involved in military activities, with troop ships and naval vessels tied up all along the Embarcadero. \n\nHowever, after the completion of the Bay Bridge and the rapid decline of ferries and the Ferry Building, the neighborhood fell into decline. The transition to container shipping, which moved most shipping to Oakland, led to further decline. Automobile transit efforts led to the Embarcadero Freeway being built in the 1960s. This improved automobile access to the Bay Bridge, but detracted aesthetically from the city. For 30 years, the highway divided the waterfront and the Ferry Building from downtown. It was torn down in 1991, after being severely damaged in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. \n\nA sculpture, \"Cupid's Span\" by was built in 2003 along the Rincon Park area. Resembling Cupid's bow and arrow with the arrow implanted in the ground, the statue symbolizes the place where Tony Bennett \"left his heart\". Mine too.", "author": "Eric B."}

Unless you start on the Embarcadero itself, you may have to run down a busy street (like Market St., like I do) . . . and there is the occasional car entering one of the piers or other entry drives that cross over the Embarcadero.  However, for the most part a run on the Embarcadero itself removes dodging (much) traffic from the equation.\n\nNext, and perhaps just as importantly, there are the awesome views of the Bay to enjoy from the Embarcadero!!  I am writing this Yelp review primarily from the perspective of a runner, as this is how I personally choose to most regularly enjoy the Embarcadero.  However, there are countless ways to enjoy the waterfront views as well as San Francisco's skyline, which many walkers, bicyclers, various \"rollers\" (bladders, skaters, scooters . . . and even a few Doobie rollers), . . . plus dog walkers, stroller-pushers . . . well you get the idea.\n\nMy usual route is down Market Street to the Ferry Building, then South down the Embarcadero, passing under the Bay Bridge, past several Piers, down to AT&T Park, which I circle, passing by the statues of Orlando Cepeda, Willie Mays, Juan Marichal, along McCovey Cove, then past the Marina, and return the same route from whence I departed.\n\nYou may find yourself S-curving a bit to wind around the swivel-headed tourists who are also on the Embarcadero . . . but, hey, they're entitled too, as this is a place for everyone to enjoy . . . and you may also have to resist the temptation of stopping for a seat on one of the benches to enjoy Otis Redding sing \"Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay\" on your iPod . . . but other than that , I think you might just agree with me that running the Embarcadero is perhaps San Francisco's #1 choice of location for a recreational run.", "author": "Joel E."}

I booked a message and then tried to get a dinner reservation. The keys for me were seafood, nice meal, and a great view. The only place I could get a last-minute reservation was the Waterfront, and it wasn't until after the booking that I read the reviews on this site. I was nervous as I headed out to dinner, but it turned out there was no cause for concern. Things were great from the first minute to the last.\n\nI got a warm greeting and was taken to a table on an enclosed patio. The view was amazing! The service was attentive without being hovering or intrusive. I appreciated that the bread was presented two or three slices at a time so that it was always warm and fresh. The water glass was refilled any time it headed to half-full.\n\nThe waitress, Sabrina, was a true gem. She made excellent suggestions (this woman knows her way around pinot noir) based on my comments about what I liked. She also offered some nice additional touches that were options not listed on the menu. It's great meeting a fellow foodie who truly enjoys their work and is willing to go the extra mile to make sure the customer has a terrific experience.\n\nI enjoyed two moist and tasty crab cakes for the appetizer followed by a plentiful bowl of good clam chowder. Dinner was a very large portion of excellent scallops seared and served with a variety of sauces on the side. I also ordered the mashed potatoes with crab meat.\n\nDessert was a sampler plate of five selections. Having heard me mention that I'm not a fan of fruit, Sabrina brought me a plate that was a lot more focused on the fabulous world of chocolate.\n\nAt the end of the evening the Waterfront had a towncar at the door. Jesse (jesseslimo@earthlink.net) was great, and we worked out a deal for a one-hour guided tour of the city. He was well-informed, thoughtful, and funny.\n\nAll in all this was a truly wonderful evening thanks to the folks at Waterfront!", "author": "George M."}

Our waiter took some lovely pics of us - I told him to consider photography as a 2nd career; he brought out the best (& smiley-est) in us! We ordered some roast meat, grilled salmon, prawns & calamari & their famous burger for my friend who still swears by it as the BEST burger she has EVER had! Even the fries that came with the burger were SUPER!\n\nThey're right there on the pier/docks, semi-open, and I'm sure some people might appreciate the fishy smell as adding to the ambiance, given their lake-side location & predominant seafood menu. Yet, I'm not a fan & its the one reason I give them 4 stars as opposed to 5.", "author": "Lil' Chef F."}

Bring your patience, not your appetite (or anyone you really like).  Seating is slow.  Initial service is slow.  Getting your entree is slow.  Getting the check is slow.  And in case you're not sure, no, your waiter doesn't really care that you are there. All I will say about the food is that it doesn't nearly meet the standards established by the fantastic view.  In fact, it doesn't meet the standards of a view of an abandoned lot.", "author": "Dayna V."}

The dusk lighting, the decorations, the cold outside...it all made for a lovely holiday ambiance. My daughter and I arrived for dinner, parked the car and went it to take our table. We were upstairs and the view was lovely; right on the water. We passed on the prix fixe menu and went ala carte.\n\nI started with a Belvedere martini (super dry, up, twist). Since my daughter doesn't drink I perused the wine-by-the-glass menu and was rather disappointed. The wine list is not particularly exciting but the individual glass options were poor. I stuck with my martini and it was done perfectly. On to the menu.\n\nI started with a half dozen mixed oysters. They were fresh and the mignonette was great. For the main course I had the pepper-crusted tuna and my daughter had the Char with crabmeat mashed potatoes. She loved hers and I loved mine as well. The tuna, very rare, was cooked perfectly. For dessert we split a chocolate fondant. Lovely again.\n\nThe food was very good. The wine list so-so. The ambiance was lovely. The service was fine but somewhat lacking in personality (on Christmas) and perfunctory. All in all a very nice experience.", "author": "Gary C."}

The inside looks very nice, but we didn't get to see much of it since they put us in the outside/tent dining area. There are heaters strewn about here and there but you should still bring a jacket because it still can get cold (ask me how I know). We had a view of the water, TI, and the bay bridge.\n\nNow on to dinner - here's where points started to go down\n\nStarted off with some appetizer bread which was served warm and tasty. You only get one or two slices per person instead of a bread bowl, but occasionally the server will come back and bring you another slice. Along with this I chose to get the ravioli, which was amazingly good except you only get 3!!! I wolfed it down and waited hungerly for the entree. My sister got the salad but she didn't think it was all great.\n\nFor the main course I chose the steak. Here I was surprised. You get 10 or so thin slices of steak, served with french fries. Pretty fancy I know. I was hella laughing. You even get a fancy knife to cut up the steak but there's no reason for it since the portions are tiny. It was good steak, but I was definitely surprised and was expecting something more classy or traditional, not french fries.\n\nAfter main course there was a pretty long lagtime for us waiting for desert. It was about 15 minutes of us waiting by the table. Me and my dad really don't talk much so it was hella silent. Not sure if this is normal for the restaurant but that wait sucked. All we got were three scoops of sherbet, not really sure if that takes 15 minutes...\n\nDesert we all chose the tri sherbet. Mango and green tea were nice, but the lemon one was extremely sour, like 10000% proof lemon. \n\nConclusion: Ultimately you're paying for location. While the food is tasty, it could be better if the portions were bigger. Desert left a sour taste of the experience. From the time we came in to leaving it was about an hour. Definitely would of been faster if we got desert quicker", "author": "Irvin David U."}

It was a selection my sister suggested, but we really didn't have much options due to the lack of time we had to make a reservation.\n\nWe were able to get in a party of 10. The view and the restaurant itself was gorgeous. We had a beautiful day out and everyone (even my lil' niece) were in good spirits.\n\nWe were seated by a kind gentleman that promptly took our drink orders. I have to admit, not getting a drink order off the bat is a huge pet peeve for me, so I was glad he was on top of it.\n\nEverything was going well until we took a glance at the menu.  There were a limited amount of dishes that seemed \"brunch-like\".  Most of the dishes that incorporated eggs, were just served poached.  (Which I have to admit, can be a tad bit boring).  So, even with 10-12 items to choose from, the whole party of ten ordered amongst the same two dishes: The crab cakes with poached eggs and the filet mignon with poached eggs.  The nine dishes came out and out of the nine orders, only one had eggs that were not overcooked.  I don't mean overcooked by just slightly, but all the eggs were hard poached; which sort of defeats getting poached eggs in the first place. On top of the egg-error, the \"filet\" looked like little pieces of left over steak. When the server stated the filet was sliced up, I wasn't expecting it to be side bits from trimming the New York steak they served. \n\nI won't be going back here to dine, but I do thank the server that took care of us. He was very nice and if it wasn't for him, I don't think we would have left a tip.  \n\nI haven't dined here for dinner, but if the quality of the food is like this on Mother's Day, I can confidently say I will not dine here on a regular day.", "author": "Julie L."}

From here to the Golden Gate Bridge (a little past Chrissy Field Beach) and back is a little over 10 miles.  This trail is absolutely breathtaking & nothing short from BEAUTIFUL. \n\nYour run starts off overlooking the Bay Bridge. Gorgeous view! You pass all the cute little restaurants & Farmers Market stands at the Ferry Building. Next up is the crowded path through the Wharf/Piers. It's like a video game duckin and divin and moving left to right, all to avoid tackling down tourists and even the locals alike. Past the pier, you head towards the right of Ghirardelli Square, through the little beach where you see people changing into their wet suits to swim. You change your music to something a little louder and upbeat, to help get you through the higher incline hill that leads you to Fort Mason. As you run from Fort Mason to Chrissy Fields, you see people cheering at tiny-tot soccer games and kites soaring right above you. You head through Chrissy Fields, another beach, and finally take a break underneath the Golden Gate Bridge. This is where you stretch, then sigh in a nice deep breath of air as you oooooh and awwww over the glorious sight of our pretty red bridge... who cares if there's a little fog above it???!\n\nYou've reached the half-way point by now and accomplished 5 miles. You head back through any which you want, but best believe the views are far from boring. When you get back to the Ferry Building you'll have reached 10+ miles. This trail is good for running alone, running in a group, and even better running w/ good friend(s) that you enjoy yapping with.  After running for this long, you deserve something good to eat. FYI, there are lots of good eateries at the Ferry Building. Go ahead, indulge!!\n\nRunning along the Embarcadero is a SERIOUS MUST!! :)", "author": "Joy A."}

We decided to go with some apps and share one entree, the soup was cold and not filled, it was more like a halfbowl of cold soup with bagged croutons. There was a terrible draft, servers kept bustling by us as they entered our orders on computerized (aka coporate) -- we had our entire meal and the nice window seats supposedly reserved never had anyone seated there. The wine by the glass was also about half-full. Portions were small, and we were still hungry and asked about the crab-cakes. \"oh, they are phenomenal we were told\", I have to tell you, I have had some ok crab cakes and some unbelievable crab cakes in my life -- really refined and delicate and flavorful -- these were the worst crab cakes I've ever had -- they were small and greasy and hard and seemed like Arthur Treachers frozen crab cakes sitting in guldens mustard. $19 for that treat. I hate to be a hater, I should have known better - bad service, bad food, over-priced and filled with tourists or people from the peninsula who didn't seem to know better... yuk!", "author": "R A."}

The decor a little is out of date, the waiters wear stuffy vests and the food is just OK AND pricey.  I like the selection of fish but the sides could be better.  The roasted vegetable side consisted of: turnips, carrots and onions.  Come on, can't you throw in a few other veggies?  The view is nice and the cocktails were good.  I would probably go back for a drink at the bar or maybe dinner if someone else was paying.", "author": "Marie N."}
