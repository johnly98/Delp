At $3 a piece, the cupcakes do seem a tad less expensive than other bakeries downtown.  It will definitely satisfy your sweet tooth if you're nearby, but it's not necessarily worth a special trip if coming from farther away.\n\nRed Velvet Cupcake: The frosting was squirted on to order.  This made a clear distinction between the cupcake and the frosting, whereas pre-frosted cupcakes have that thin soggy in-between layer.  I kinda missed that actually.  The taste was spot on though, with a creamy/tangy frosting and fluffy cake.\n\nStrawberry Macaron: This tasted like fresh strawberries mixed into cream.  Like I could feel the texture of some strawberry seeds/pulp.  Macarons are good in general, but this one was particularly tasty.\n\nSalted Caramel Macaron: Unfortunately, this macaron was disappointing.  For one, it was too salty.  But also, there was just caramel flavored cream, not actual caramel.  And that inner cream part was pretty bland.\n\nCarrot Cupcake: I really appreciated the carrot shreds and plump raisins, the cake portion did indeed feel like carrot cake.  The frosting had been applied earlier.  It had a thin sugary crust with a cream cheese smoothness underneath.  A very fun take on the traditional carrot cake!", "author": "Adam B."}

They offer bulk discounts over a certain amount, so for about 9 dozen, it was about $135 including tax and delivery. There are many flavors to choose from as well, might I suggest getting the passion fruit if it's in season, it's so killer that you can smell the sweetness from a distance. They come neatly arranged in boxes so there will be no smushing en route. \n\nYou should enjoy a large frosting ratio to cake because the frosting is very rich, thick, and sweet. They aren't messing around here with their frosting swirls :) \n\nWould definitely cater from again for either large or small events.", "author": "Alison A."}

Don't get me wrong - I love me a cupcake from Sprinkles too but those are way bigger and heavier! These are the perfect size and much cuter/easier than serving and cutting a cake at work. \n\nThe price point is pretty fair as well at $30 per dozen -  more if you order special designs or fondant letters.

Cupcake Cove understands (although Magnolia Bakery in NYC is still my favorite!). \n\nWe've gotten these a couple times for office birthdays, and each time, the cakes have been very moist and light. A peeve I have is that they don't label the assorted cupcakes, so its a bit of a guessing game as to what you're getting if you didn't order them yourself. Apparently guava is a flavor (and I've probably had it?) but I just didn't know given the lack of labeling. The pumpkin one is especially good. While I'm a sugar fan, others didn't like how you could taste the individual sugar crystals in the frosting.\n\nAs for location, I'd literally walked past the shop (literally just large enough for the counter) every day to work before noticing it was there.

Literally is a cove considering how small it is! I was enticed by the assortment of flavors especially the more fruity ones like the guava and pineapple. \n\nJust like many other cupcake places, Cupcake cove serves designated flavors on certain days. More particularly, the fruity flavors like Guava and Pineapple are not served on most days! In terms of the cupcakes, you must get: The Chocolate Caramel, The Black Bottom, and the Coffee Chocolate (Despite the semi bitter taste of the coffee). I wish the mint chocolate was better as the frosting was a little stiff for my liking. If you want to go on a day with a variety of flavors - fruity and chocolatey - I would suggest Wednesdays or Thursdays! \n\nMy only problem with Cupcake Cove is the lack of flavor balance with their vanilla and more fruity flavors. The cake is not as moist as the others and wish the frosting complimented the cake better. Other than that, cupcake cove is great for the sweet tooth, especially with the Buy 5 get 1 deal for bigger groups.", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

My guest and I enjoyed them, they were scrumptious!  Not only did they taste good; they looked good too!\n\nJohn was very accommodating; I had specialty cupcake liners that I wanted my cupcakes baked in, and he was willing and able to grant my special request.   Before, I placed my order with Cupcake Cove; I had contacted another cupcake business in Berkeley who was not accommodating and their prices and delivery fee were not as reasonable as Cupcake Cove.\n\nIf you're placing a large order, Cupcake Cove offers a special deal for every 5 cupcakes you buy; you get the 6th one free.  This was beneficial to me; the savings was substantial.  I checked the prices at other cupcake businesses and their prices were much higher than Cupcake Cove.\n\nMy party was on a Saturday, and although Cupcake Cove is not open for business on Saturday's, John didn't hesitate to take my order.  He baked my cupcakes first thing that morning and delivered them to the venue where I was having my party before 12 noon that same day, as he had promised.   The cupcakes were packaged nice and secure in sectional boxes and stacked inside clear sturdy tote bags, great presentation!\n\nI highly recommend Cupcake Cove's services to anyone.

Since we were walking by after lunch at Barbacco, I decided to stop by and try them out again. They are located on a corner in the Financial District, and it's easy to walk by without noticing if you're not actively looking for it. It wasn't busy around 1:30pm on a Friday, which was good since this shop is TINY. We had four people in our group and it was a tight squeeze getting everyone inside. There was a good selection of cupcakes left, and they were still baking more, so all the flavors were available. I opted for the Guava & Passion Fruit ($3, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eEdaNC4g_1fz0pvdkoK9qQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg) since it sounded the most unique. This cupcake had very subtle flavors, but you could still taste the guava and passion fruit. However, the cupcake itself was a bit dry/crumbly, and the frosting was too heavy for me since it's a buttercream. Although I enjoyed the flavor of the cupcake, I don't think I would come back since I didn't love it overall.

My coworker said she wanted cupcakes and this place was the closest. This place is very small. There's no room for sitting so you pretty much just order and go. I ordered 15 cupcakes. 3 of each: red velvet, coffee, mint, salted caramel, and vanilla. It wasn't until after I paid that the person behind the counter told me that I can choose an additional three cupcakes free of charge because of their promotion going on which was buy 5, get 1 free. Wish they told me earlier so I could've just purchased 13 and get an additional two of them for free. So for the free ones, i chose lemon. \n\nAll of their cakes are either chocolate cake or vanilla cake. The flavor comes from the frosting. I got to try the vanilla and the mint. Both cupcakes were crumbly and fell apart once I bit into them. The frosting for the mint was overly sweet! I took one bite and had to scrape the rest of it off! It's a pretty big deal for me to say food is overly sweet because I have a HUGE sweet tooth. After I scraped off the mint frosting and ate just the cake on its own, it was so dry! The frosting for the vanilla was a little bit better: not as sweet but had an overwhelming buttery flavor to it. \n\nAt 3 dollars per cupcake, I thought this was a pretty steep price. It wasn't anything amazing, just average. If you work nearby and want a cupcake to satisfy those cravings, then i would recommend this place.

When faced with the task of providing cupcakes for a friend's birthday get-together, I panicked when I saw that my work is within proximity to Cupcake Cove, Batter Bakery, Kara's Cupcakes, and Miette.  So, I did what anyone else would do in this situation: I went to what was closest to me, which in this case was Cupcake Cove.  Having picked up one or two single cupcakes for various occasions before, I know that there tends to be a fairly good selection at all hours at their corner shop in the Financial District.  My husband was a fan of the Red Velvet, but really didn't like their Carrot Cake.  For last night, I opted for a Red Velvet, Vanilla, Coconut, Coffee, Guava/Passion Fruit, and Double Chocolate cupcakes for my friends.  The general consensus was that the Vanilla, Coffee, and Guava/Passion Fruit cupcakes were the big winners.  I love their individually cupcakes boxes, and if you're planning on buying multiple, they have a buy 5, get 1 free option! These are definitely not \"out of this world\" cupcakes, but they're certainly priced a little better than Miette (which we all know to be delicious, but also expensive), Kara's and Batter (who has a delicious Sand Angel cookie but lacks availability for cupcakes at their Embarcadero outpost). I would definitely come back here in a bind, or until I find a better alternative in the area.", "author": "Lisa I."}

You're really paying for the freshness, convenience and availability of the product. Aside from that note.\n\nParking - A definite NO-NO.  Definitely a quick stop from work type of place.  Really close to Montgomery Bart Station.\n\nCupcake Cove opened several months ago and has been consistently manned by nice and friendly staff.  I'm always greeted as I indecisively select the particular flavor of that days' cravings.\n\nI've actually grown to be very peculiar about my cupcakes because (1) cakes have to be MOIST, (2) Crumbs are not my friends - I hate making a mess big enough for the whole world to see that I've been a fatty, (3) Frosting is too fat (too many calories that I'm unwilling to work off) - but I will tolerate a tad just to satisfy my sweet tooth.  With these three criteria, some of my notable favorites are:\n\nRed Velvet - super moist, red dye cake with a super thick layer of cream cheese frosting (that I will only allow myself 1 mm).   \n\nBlack Bottom - ZOMG, byfar MY FAVORITE cupcake EVER.  No Frosting = Less Guilty Points.  It's a chocolate-y cupcake with cream cheese filling.  Almost like a chocolate cake and cheese cake combination.  It's like a stuffed donut, you find such a pleasant filling inside. \n\nI've also tried Mint Chocolate, Coffee, Lemon Vanilla, Chocolate Vanilla, Vanilla Chocolate, pretty much every flavor they have.  Most of these are just simple flavored cupcake with frosting as the highlight of that particular flavor.\n\nCupcake Cove has these REALLY REALLY cool single cupcake holders, not your conventional boxes that you have to make sure you wont topple on the way back to wherever you need to go.  Ahh, perfect for hiding in any purse.\n\nAfter my numerous visits, I found out they do special orders!!!  For all you lazy planners out there - they can customize your cupcakes with Happy Birthday/Giants/Baseball/Hello Kitty decals or whatever your celebratory occasion may be but it does come at an extra cost.  Candles are also available for purchase.  Very cute/quaint shop, friendly staff, awesome flavors - Shhh, don't tell my boyfriend but I'm coming back for more.", "author": "Steph L."}

I walked in this afternoon to see two types of cupcakes (red velvet and chocolate with vanilla frosting) and four types of cookies (chocolate chip, snickerdoodle, double chocolate, and what I assume is peanut butter).  The shop is very, very small and it was run by two sweet Asian girls.\n\nThey had a \"Giants Special,\" which was Buy 2 Get 1 Free Cupcakes and Buy 1 Get 1 Free Cookies.  Not sure how long this will last, but I decided to take three cupcakes and two chocolate chip cookies.  A regular cupcake is $3, and a cookie is $1.75.\n\nFirst, the cupcakes: the red velvet is effing amazing.  I've never had a better red velvet cake, hands down.  This beats Batter Bakery by a million yards.  It was a good size, with just enough cream cheese frosting (and when I say this is cream cheese frosting, it really IS cream cheese frosting, not some half-assed vanilla-cream-cheese crap that some bakeries put on) and an incredibly soft, fluffy, moist cake.\n\nI wasn't a fan of the chocolate cupcake, but that's because I'm not a huge fan of too much chocolate.  The cake was also really fluffy and moist (but not crumbly), but with the vanilla icing and clear sugar sprinkles, it was entirely too sweet for me.  It's a good one for chocolate lovers though, I think, as the cake is dark and rich.\n\nThe cookies are about 4-5 inches in diameter, and they're the thin, chewy kind that are only about a centimeter, at most, in height.  The edges are slightly crispy, and the interior is really dense, not too sweet, and just plain bomb.  Their cookies are currently battling Bumzy's for the top spot in my cookie list.", "author": "Tori S."}

Cupcake stores started opening near my house. Cupcake bike deliveries. Cupcake hole-in-the-wall places. Yet, I don't know a single person who even likes cupcakes. They seem to be something more like, a nice iconic figure you can buy and eat.\n\nAnyway, I bought about two bags of cupcakes from this location for a company party. I was told to get the \"Red Velvet,\" apparently it's their most popular one. I'm not up to par with what the cupcake culture thinks the best flavors are BUT never in the world did I think I would find guava-flavored cupcakes. Are you kidding me? I barely find guava-flavored anything outside of Mexico and guavas are my personal favorite fruits!\n\nOh, and when it was time for that party...you know which cupcake I had? GUAVA! And after that, red velvet, and after that? Who knows! I tried mostly all and the presentation, moisture and sprinkles were just perfect. Maybe a bit too much frosting.\n\nIf you get two dozens, they give you extras. Shhhh.", "author": "Alexia R."}

Carrot was reallllly moist and I almost wanted to eat the whole thing!  Coffee was eh, the only part that had caffeine flavor was only the frosting, which tasted a bit buttery and oily.  Strawberry was my least favorite, especially since it was pink frosting on top of a chocolate cupcake.  (Chocolate's not my thing.)  The chocolate was stiff and pretty bad.  No strawberry flavor whatsoever, and frosting wasn't the best either.  Maybe there was a reason why there was so much of this left.  I should've just gotten a free red velvet instead. \n\nI'd come back for either the red velvet or carrot again, espeically since this is the only cupcake shop around the FiDi.

So when I grab a gourmet cupcake, I expect it to have a little something extra in comparison to what I would be able to pull off alone in my kitchen, covered in flour. Cupcake Cove is at least more consistent than the products of my solo endeavors. But there's nothing particularly revolutionary about their taste, moistness, balance of flavors (there's no variety that's struck me as incredibly exotic or unique), or presentation. However, they are conveniently located and, to repeat, are at least consistent -- I've had many a tasty treat from here, and I've never had a bad one as of yet. \n\nI could see myself giving this place 4 stars based on my review so far; however, the customer service is where I knock off a star. I've had a few orders that have been a bit mussed by the Cove. Again, something I can understand, I'm sure they receive a lot of pick-up orders! But if the staff could have been a little more helpful, I'd have walked away happier. On one occasion, I waited for an extra 8 minutes (I timed it) while they tracked down a receipt to confirm that I was being given the correct order and whether I'd prepaid for it or not. The staff did not even apologize for the discrepancy or the resulting delay. I consider myself to be fairly patient, but I do appreciate when an establishment expresses concern for their patrons. And given that the Cove is really only set up for brief customer interactions (walk in, order cupcake, pay for cupcake, leave), every minute really counts. \n\nOverall, no reason to not place your office order for cupcakes here -- it's organized, comes in a nice box, and most times, there will be a fairly painless pick-up. But if you're seeking that something \"extra\" in your sugar rush, maybe check out some of the cafe patisseries in downtown.", "author": "Lexi H."}

I cheated on my favorite cupcake spot with Cupcake Cove because I had a mean craving and they were just a couple of blocks away from the job. I tried a few different flavours and shared the rest with my co-workers. If you buy 5, you get the 6th one free. I posted the variety in a photo.  The cupcake itself was a bit dense and didn't offer much of the flavor.  It was definitely all in the frosting.  Not to say it was a bad cupcake, it's definitely a decent cupcake, just not as fluffy and moist as I like them. I thought the frosting was a wee bit too sweet.  I was bummed they no longer offer the famous black bottom and it's the first thing I asked for when I got there. I went again today and tried the lemon. All of the flavor was in the frosting once again but hey, I ate them and my sweet tooth was satisfied. I probably won't go often since they were $3 per cupcake. Maybe as a treat for my co-workers. I did really enjoy the salted caramel and asked for it today but they had a different menu going. The guy behind the counter was so nice, he said he had batter ready and could bake one just for me.

This tiny store is soo close to my office, but sadly, proximity does not make up for taste.  Let's put it this way--my fave thing is the individual plastic containers they put each cupcake in.  Ok, their cupcakes are standard size, $3/ea with specials every now and then (e.g.: buy 5, get 1). Generally, pretty to look at, moist cakes but lacking in flavor.  Also, sprinkles/sanded sugar on the frosting detracted, not added, to cupcake experience.  They had about 5-6 flavors, all fairly standard.  They also had a few snickerdoodles (they rotate cookie flavors). \n\nCUPCAKES I TRIED:\n-Vanilla Vanilla.\nCake: moist, but not very vanilla flavored.  Rather bland.  The more I ate the cake, the more it tasted like playdough.  Frosting: thick, but again, rather bland, lacked vanilla oomph, had a hint of brown sugar.  Was sprinkled with clear sanding sugar, which looked sparkly and bedazzled, but had the crunch of gritty sand.\n\n-Red Velvet w/Cream Cheese frosting.\nCake: moist and crazy bright red (food dye overkill).  Could not detect a hint of cocoa in flavor. The texture of this cake closely resembles Paula Dean's from Foodnetwork. Frosting was tasty, but in my opinion was ruined by red sprinkles that were soft, mushy and flavorless. \n\n-Lemon Cupcake\nBasically, vanilla cupcake w/lemon frosting. Frosting is OK, would have preferred more tartness.\n\nRETURN VISIT?....UNLIKELY\nI'm kinda curious to try the lemon cupcake, but I was told it is a vanilla cake w/lemon frosting.

For every co-worker's birthday, Cupcake Cove is the place to pick up a cupcake or two. For holiday parties, Cupcake Cove is the place to go. It's nice that they are conveniently located in the Downtown hub areas - both in San Francisco and Oakland. For me, it's just about a half block away in the FiDi of San Francisco! However, what I wanted to write about was their excellent service on a particular day I was not in the office. I wanted to send a \"thank you\" to a team I work with. I was thinking about flowers, but I didn't think the gentlemen on the team would appreciate flowers much! Then, I thought about cupcakes! Who could turn down a sweet treat like that?! I called Cupcake Cove from home. I wish I could remember the gentleman's name that took my order. I believe he was the owner, but I'm not sure. It was such a last minute decision because I wanted it delivered within the hour of me calling. I ordered a dozen assorted cupcakes. He said, \"no problem.\" I said I wasn't at work. He said, \"no problem, we can deliver.\" I said it would be going to an office a couple blocks away on Montgomery Street. He said, \"no problem.\" I said I wanted it delivered within the hour if possible. He said, \"no problem.\" He didn't actually say \"no problem\" each time but I'm sure you get the idea. He was Very accommodating. Once my order was complete, he gave me my total and that was that. Then, I got a phone call about a minute later from the same man. He said, \"I realized this was a gift, so I don't want to give them the receipt. Can I send you an e-receipt?\" I said Wow, thank you so much for thinking about that before I did! So he processed my payment and sent me a receipt via Square. I thanked him Again before getting off the phone for the second time. I got confirmation from the team about 30 minutes later, and they were definitely surprised! I owe that to Cupcake Cove! Not only do I love their cupcakes (yes, I've had them on multiple occasions!), but I love their service as well! Thank you Cupcake Cove for providing the service that you do!", "author": "Marie T."}

Thanks scoutmob for this discount because it was not worth it for me to buy these cupcakes for $3 a piece.  I bought red velvet with cream cheese, coffee with chocolate cake, strawberry with chocolate cake, carrot with cream cheese and peanut butter with chocolate cake.  Their red velvet cupcakes are the most lightest red velvety I've ever seen (other places I've tried had a deep red color to it). The cake doesn't have much flavor but the cream cheese frosting is really good.  Coffee with chocolate cake we meh.  I like the coffee bits to give it that crunch but overall I was not amazed by both the frosting nor the chocolate cake. The strawberry with chocolate cake is less than mediocre. Strawberry frosting has a light strawberry taste but when you eat it with the chocolate cake, the strawberry flavor losses it's taste. My dad actually ate the the carrot cake with cream cheese frosting but he said it was way too sweet for him, which was strange because he loves sweets!! Last but not least, my sister had the peanut butter with chocolate cake and she said it was ok. Peanut butter frosting was good but the chocolate cake was just any other chocolate she's ever had.\n\nListen to me cupcake lovers!

OK, so it wasn't quite a million but like me, my godfather was BIG on pastries and he would definitely approve of Cupcake Cove.  My bff is a pastry chef so I am used to constant supplies of out of this world homemade pastries.  And let me tell you (as I have said in many of my reviews), I eat a lot of cake.  The only bad thing about cupcakes is just that -- they're cups of cake, not entire cakes in and of themselves.  \n\nI've seen Cupcake Cove a zillion times since I work just a couple of blocks away and would think to myself \"who on earth would go to a store that sells nothing but cupcakes???\"  Well, I figured out why, because these cupcakes are THE BOMB.  Since today was my first visit, I tentatively just bought one vanilla and one red velvet.  They were both out of this world.  Soft, fresh, just the right texture, both were just perfect.  The red velvet was sublime in the way it gently caressed my palette.   I was expecting them to be uber-sweet but they are just right.\n\nThe pricing is about what you would expect for a place like this in the FiDi, so I'm a little surprised to see some reviewers complain about the price.  No, they are not cheap, but they are not overpriced either.  \n\nBut dammit, two of those cupcakes weren't enough and I was left wanting more and I couldn't sneak out of the office before they closed.  Guess I'll have to go back tomorrow and buy several -- two cupcakes does not a cake make!  And I'll eat them in my office with the lights off, the blinds drawn down and crawl under my desk so that I don't have to share -- 'cos I don't share things this good.   \n\nCall me a pig.

But to give you some perspective, my friend isn't into sweets or baked goods and she's polite. \n\nI tried the red velvet first.  While they supposedly baked the cupcakes on site, the cupcake I had is not fresh.  The edges of the cake were hard, although the frosting was soft enough yet still retain its shape.  The frosting had the right amount of sweetness to it while not being over powered by the cream cheese.  The cake itself also tasted good.  However, the texture would be even better if it didn't sit on the shelf, exposed to open air for the past 3 days, which is what I suspected. \n\nThen I tried the Coffee cupcake.  The cake is a vanilla cake, they basically had only chocolate or vanilla cakes, the varieties are in the frosting.  The coffee frosting was good with the crunchiness of the toffee, but the cake itself was just meh...   i was wondering if its from a cake mix to be frank. \n\nLastly, I tried the chocolate bottom cupcake.  It was pretty good, but again, the 3 day old texture was bothering me.  Instead of eating a soft fluffy cake, i was eating a chewy dense muffin. \n\nAll in all, for the price of $3 per pop, I'd go back for the red velvet if i have the must-have-cupcake-craving.  \n\n\nI would have rate it 2.5 stars if yelp allow half stars.", "author": "Jessica C."}

My coworker made a phone order the day before Valentines for 30 red velvet cupcakes for pick up at 1:30PM, only to find out the next day at 1:30 that they had run out of cupcakes. While they did whip up another batch, we were still delayed from picking them up for another 45 minutes. I know that Valentine's Day is a huge seller, but I just don't understand what kind of store accepts a phone order and can't complete it by the time promised, because they had RUN OUT OF THEIR SUPPLIES. I would have assumed that they would have set aside 30 cupcakes to avoid this problem. Also, when we went, the two people working didn't even know what was going on. The first lady told us that they only made 24 red velvet cupcakes and we would have to have 6 of another flavor, before the second lady in the back told us all that all 30 red velvet cupcakes had been completed. It's a miniscule store, and I'd just like to think that the people sharing such a cramped space would communicate better.\n\nIn terms of the cupcake, the frosting was really delicious. The cupcake part was kind of oily and flavorless. Gross.

This is not very close to my work so it was a stretch to try the place... \nI usually call before picking up cupcakes, since I order 25 of them. I came here three times to get cupcakes for birthday parties in my office. They have a good deal where you buy 5 and get 1 free. Originally, I thought this was a 'special' that we got for our company (silly me), but it is for everyone.\nAll the three times that I've been here, I ordered cupcakes in rather large quantities. The boxes that they give you are pretty big and its quite diffiucult to carry them several blocks back to the office. So I always ask for a bag. The first time I came here, they told me they do not have bags. The second time, however, they did and they put my two and a half boxes full of cupcakes into bags. At this point, it was customary, and since having a cupcake place in FiDi, you'd assume that many will need bags to carry cupcakes back to their offices... NOT! I came here the third time and asked for a bag (as I usually do) and the girl at the counter got very inconsiderate and rude. She told me that they simply don't have bags (in the worst tone ever) and acted like I demanded something stupefying!... So uncouth! \nWhen I called to have an order placed for the fourth time, the guy on the phone told me \"that they don't have the buy 5 get 1 free\" deal, because I was mean the last time... (because I requested a BAG?!?!?) Seriously?!... Granted, it was a good deal, but it's not worth it when dealing with bad customer service!\n\nThe summary:\n\n1 star off-- No bags (to carry large boxes several blocks back to the office)\n1 star off-- For being rude and for false accusations. \n1 star off-- For not accepting Amex... (its a hassle when you can't use your corporate card for office purchases) =]\n\nThe cupcakes: Their red velvet is pretty good.

So when I dish out $3 for a cupcake, it had better be awesome. Cupcake Cove is, for me, better than most other cupcake spots in the city (this town is, admittedly, full of abysmal cupcake options). The cake has a good, moist texture (which is shockingly rare). The flavors are nice if a bit bland. I firmly believe that sprinkles should counterbalance the other flavors/textures in a cupcake. The toppings they use are unnecessary and somewhat damaging, in that they add neither texture nor flavor yet make it overly-sweet. The red velvet sprinkles are mushy (no texture) and too sugary for the cupcake. The chocolate-chocolate cupcake uses chocolate chips, which is overkill.

Not that I don't like those, but this is a specialty cupcake place - I had higher hopes.  The same for the salted caramel -  it just tasted like another vanilla cupcake. The red velvet was the best - it was very buttery and rich. I heard good things about the guava passionfruit cupcake so maybe next time I'll have to try that.", "author": "Amy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-05", "description": "Looking at other reviews maybe my cupcake palate is off, but this bakeshop is while I still have faith in cake in a cup. Pineapple pineapple is pretty sweet but the flavor is spot on and the cupcake is moist without falling apart. Guava passion fruit vanilla is a pink ray of sunshine  and the actual strawberry in the strawberry chocolate frosting just makes me smile. The standouts to me are their fruit flavors, but I've enjoyed every flavor I've had (black bottom, chocolate mint, chocolate coffee, carrot). Occasionally the cake in the other flavors will be a bit too moist; the cake won't hold its shape when I take off the wrapper. But that's only a bad thing if you're eating on the go. I would rather have a fall-apart delicious cupcake than a portable brick any day. All the way around though, Cupcake Cove seems to have it figured it out when it comes to cake to frosting ratio as well as cupcake transport. Those funny little plastic containers, while perhaps not particularly eco-friendly, do a good job of keeping your cupcake looking fine until you're ready to demolish it. I do, however, have one bone to pick with Cupcake Cove, how can you be called Cupcake COVE and not take advantage of the pirate associations?! When I first heard the name I pictured pink pirate ships hauling glittery treasure chests of sweet booty... not Helvetica font and a minimalist cupcake silhouette.

In the end, the cream cheese frosting on the red velvet won the extra star.\n\nHonestly, I had high hopes for this place.  You gotta figure, a place that exclusively focuses on perfecting cupcakes has to be pretty decent, eh?  Wrong.  \n\nI get it....rents expensive in the FiDi, so you have to charge $3/cupcake.  But its not cool to be a total rip off.  \n\nI ordered 1 red velvet and 1 lemon cream and was wholly unimpressed.  To start, the cupcakes were DRY.....like \"I need to swish water to get these suckers to go down the pipe\" type of dry.  The red velvet had a nice cream cheese frosting, but the \"cake\" was unimpressive....next to no flavor....which, had it been moist, still wouldn't have saved it.  \n\nAs for the lemon. *shudders* YUCK-O-LA.  It was just gross...like so disgusting that I chucked my $3 cupcake after 1 bite.  It was dry, no flavor beyond sour, and the frosting was just horrendous.  Sickeningly sweet with weird, fake lemon extract overtones.  \n\nI shant be revisiting this place.

But maybe because I went there late in the day so there wasn't much selection and the cupcakes were probably sitting out for most of the day so the cakes were that moist.  The cake tasted like the texture of cornbread instead of a cupcake and the flavors were a bit deceiving.  I ordered a coffee cupcake and a coconut cupcake.  I was expecting the cake to be \"coffee\" flavored cake and the \"coconut\" to be a coconut flavored cake, but both were just a vanilla cupcake covered in the flavored buttercream frosting.  Maybe I wouldn't invested in buying those cupcakes if there was a better description of the actual flavor of the cupcake. All in all both cupcakes were disappointing - but then again I think I had too much expectations on the cupcakes to start with.  Will I try this place again, probably not.

That is some bullshit shenanigans right there. Red velvet cupcakes are supposed to taste like a. chocolate and b. buttermilk-- smooth and rich and tangy. This red velvet cupcake tasted like neither of those things. The frosting was at least cream cheese, though a bit gummy-- not a pleasant texture at all. For the size, three dollars is quite a hit to my wallet. \n\nWhat saved this review from being two stars is the adorable little to go box they give you for the cupcakes and the pleasant woman at the counter.

I am sad to say that I would rank them as slightly better than something from a WalMart/Costco bakery, where a dozen cupcakes may be purchased for the price of one of these equivalents.  The cakes tasted like they were made from a box and the icing was uber sweet. I say they are slightly better because of the presentation--the icing is not just plopped on top.  Not terrible, but for $3, I want a great cupcake; not a dozen lame ones.  \n\nNeedless to say, I will not be gong back.\n\nPerhaps, as other reviewers have said, some of the cupcakes are better than others.  All of them, however, cost the same, so I would expect them all to be worth $3.  I am surprised to see so many 5 stars for this place; I wonder if any of these reviewers have ever tried a cupcake anywhere else.\n\nThere are cupcake shops out there that have skilled artisans who actually make cupcakes that are worth $3 or more.  Kara's Cupcakes comes to mind.  There are also cupcake shops that are taking advantage of the reputations and goodwill developed by these quality shops and are selling crap for the same price.  Unfortunately, I see this place as being the latter.  \n\nI am not sure why so many reviewers talk about the convenient location.  Sure, it is convenient, but is that what I consider when deciding to buy a cupcake?  No.  When you look it up on Yelp, you are given the address and a map, which is all I need to know if it is convenient for me.  Starbucks is convenient too, and they have better cupcakes.", "author": "C G K."}
