It would be standard sushi rolls you could get from a stall in a mall.\n\nThe value, while decent, is also not why I love this place. For $32, you get all you can eat sushi, beer and sake. Pretty good deal if you ask me, as you'd pay way more for the amount you can get at other places.\n\nThe real reason this place is awesome is because of the crowd. Because pretty much everyone does AYCE, and you get free sake and beer, basically everyone does sake bombs all night, and in our case together!\n\nAfter a few sake bombs, everyone in the restaurant is pretty much doing sake bombs with you, with one person yelling sake sake sake to the whole restaurant and everyone else yelling bomb back. It's a pretty awesome experience and it basically makes everyone at your table way more drunk than they intended to be.\n\nLoads of fun, but don't come expecting good food.", "author": "Tyler T."}

Pretty good deal if you can eat more than a couple rolls + drinks. Drinks include Beer and Hot Sake.  \n\nI just had my first experience here on a Thursday night for a friends' birthday, party of 9, he was able to call ahead to reserve a table for such a large group. This place is on the smaller side, 10-12 tables total, so I can see wait times here racking up with the 2-hr AYCE time limit. The waitstaff was attentive and was able to handle such high volume orders without any hiccups. \n\nThe appetizers were my favorite part of the AYCE experience. Shout out to all the FRIED FOOD appetizers, which were all very tasty. The gyoza were cooked perfect, nice crunch and with tasty meat filling. The sesame chicken was the star of the appetizers, very unassuming on the menu. Packed with a ton of flavor, nice batter exterior and juicy chicken interior. I'm a huge fan of tonkatsu, and anytime I can eat unlimited orders, I'm going to take advantage of it. Cooked to order, it wasn't the best tasting katsu, but it hit the spot. \n\nNow, If you are coming here for the just the sushi, it leans toward the side of middle of the road. We tried every specialty roll on the AYCE menu, and not one really stood out from the rest. The flavors were not really there, as the fish didn't taste very fresh, and it became hard to distinguish the taste between the rolls. If I ordered sushi only, I would've left a bit disappointed. \n\nAll in all, if your primary focus is to DRINK, this is a great option, with the food being a bonus. But if you are trying to go more sushi focused, I would try my luck at a different spot.", "author": "Paolo B."}

I think the best way to break down this review is by using a Pros/Cons format, so here it goes:\n\nPros:\n- AYCE and Drink is a pretty good deal at $35, but only really when you're going with a group (unless you can really down your drinks). We ultimately only finished with two large Asahis and two sake bottles, so we probably could have taken on a bit more.\n- Tempura/croquettes are redeeming factors to the average sushi quality (which we ate at the tailend of our meal).\n- We had a great server and food was brought out quickly and accurately, despite there being a large party being served that night.\n\nCons:\n- Despite the $35 AYCE and Drink per person, the total came to $88. I didn't ask about it because we had a good night and service was good, but I think its a bit steep for what we expected.\n- Sushi quality is pretty average, but expected for an AYCE. You can only get sushi rolls instead of any nigiri or sashimi, but I'm not too familiar if there are comparable deals in SF where you can get nigiri as well.\n\nAlthough the place and ambience was fine and the service was great, the quality of the sushi and the price point for what we expected to pay ultimately dropped this to 3 stars instead of a solid 4. If you're looking for AYCE sushi, it's best to look elsewhere and buy drinks separately, granted that it may total to what we had paid for this AYCE and Drink deal.", "author": "David W."}

But no no, the party is actually the next door, although they are a joint place, meaning that you can order from this place to that party place (again next door lol) Complicated? Well, just call the place and they'll do the thorough explaining hehe\n\nThe likes:\n-Foods! Oh course sushi was good, but it wasn't like a wow kind of sushi but it was just an average, average that you can get it just about anywhere kind of sushi. \n-Best part, 2 hrs of all you can eat sushi for $29! So as the cheap students that we are we rush in and order all of them, but two or three at a time so we can at least get the food coming and we didn't want to get hated on lol. Special rolls are part of this deal! \n-That deal also applies to drinks, only alcoholic drinks for $25. Be beware the beer drinks are a bottle size\n-Last moment polaroid picture! Added to their own wall collection. Not yours to keep, but theirs. Oh and look for \"Spicy girls and salty boy\" ! I'm there hehe I'm part of their memories~\n\nThe between:\n-Complimentary bday dessert, but it was just one mochi ice cream. Split it into four pieces for four people lol one size fit one finger for one person. Complicated? Well, check out my photos for this place\n-Staffs, nice folks. But, both lack English so it does take some effort and some hand suggestions to get some dialogue going. But again nice fun folks\n\nThe umm:\n-The Shitake Maki has one ingredient: mushroom. Personally, I hate mushrooms so this stays here, but my friends said it was good and had some sweet to it. Others give it a try, YOLO!\n-Seaweed, it was overly sweet and was too liquidly\n-Chicken teriyaki is literally just grill chicken and does come with the teriyaki sauce but the sauce itself was too blend. Just grill yo our chicken at home guyss\n-Cleanness, they need to work on that. Our table was just sticky and one plate even had a tiny particles of seaweed when we got the plate. \n \nExperience it again? I want to keep this as part of my happy moments and should stay like that. But yes, I'll go again like in 3 yrs just to see if the Polaroid pic is still there.

Got the shrimp tempura rainbow roll. Be warned, the INGREDIENTS ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE MENU. Got this roll because it was one of the few not marked as spicy. To my surprise, there was an overwhelming amount of a wasabi sauce on top of the roll which was not mentioned anywhere on the menu. When I brought it up to the waiter, with attitude she responded \"uh what do you want me to do about it?? Change it??\" Yes, if you advertise one thing and give me something else, I want to get what I ordered. I got a new order with no sauce on top but still wasn't pleased.

Let me break this down for you: \n\n1. $25 all you can drink\n2. $29 all you can eat\n3. All you can eat sushi costs $4. FOUR DOLLARS.\n\nSushi Delight is next door to Mint Karaoke. Sometimes when there are a lot of people karaoke-ing that have ordered before you, your orders take longer to receive. But, at least you get to watch all the rockstars on the big screen belting out while stuffing their face with sushi.\n\nThe food here is nothing special (and stick with the specialty rolls) but with the time limit you're able to stuff your face with unlimited amounts of sushi for two hours and produce a massive food baby. Who's not down? I'm usually not interested in eating average sushi but for some reason at Sushi Delight, it's quantity over quality. \n\nAlso, if you don't finish a decent amount of food, THEY WILL CHARGE YOU. I suggest finding a place to put it...like perfectly placed in the round hole in the back of each chair (ok just kidding, please don't do that) or your stomach. \n\nThey deliver, but honestly I would skip it because the cost of two specialty sushi rolls is just as much as all you can eat and drink here.", "author": "Shereen A."}

There's a sushi place 3 blocks from me? How have I never heard of this place. I thought why the hell not, I'll give it a go! \n\nI walked right on over, which took a total of 60 seconds. It's right next to The Mint, and when I entered I realized that it's actually connected to The Mint! I was confused because I go to The Mint every so often, and I feel like I would have remembered that there was a sushi spot connected? Then I realized the reason I never noticed is because I'm always a little tipsy when I'm at The Mint ;-)\n\nI was the only customer in the restaurant, which is always kind of a.. sign. But, the chefs looked busy, and there was a line of to go orders scattered on the bar. This lead me to the conclusion that this spot is more popular for delivery than eating in. Which, I totally understand, as I have over 500 Eat24 delivery orders to date! (No shame.)\n\nI got the bento box with avocado/cucumber roll, california roll, and chicken teriyaki. About as BASIC as you can get when it comes to sushi. How on earth could you screw this up?\n\nFirst comes out the miso soup. I'm aware that most sushi spots make their miso soup using a mix with hot water, and throw in some generic tofu bits. But, I still usually end up liking it. THIS soup tasted like hot water with pepper. Pretty bad. Which is surprising because I feel like it's really hard to mess up miso soup, no?\n\nThen my bento box came out. I could tell as soon as it came out that it was sub-par sushi. Which, is okay, I'm not expecting 'Ozumo's' quality here. I tried the cali roll first. The crab meat was.. warm? I could tell it wasn't being refrigerated properly. Warm crab meat that's supposed to be served cold is a big no no. Next, I tried the avo roll. Pretty.. okay. No complaints. The salad was kinda weird.. The dressing was way too watery and it ruined the salad. The chicken teriyaki was, again, just okay. The chicken was good, but the sauce tasted like it was cheap grocery store sauce. \n\n$15 for 2 rolls, chicken teriyaki, rice, salad and soup. Can't complain.. Actually, yeah I can.

Not great, but good.\n\nLast night I tried the \"All you can eat (sushi) & drink deal\" - $29.00 a person. The drinks are a choice of 3 different beers, soda and Hot Sake only. \n\nThe sushi they offer are rolls only, no sashimi.  You may only order 2 rolls at a time, per person and with each order, came with more and more RICE. Very little fish. \n\nWe were sadly disappointed within 10 minutes of eating our meal. Not to mention the waitress barely made time for us.  I have to guess part of the -skimping out- deal. If she ignores you most of the time, you barely have time to order while still hungry.\n\nHad we known this was a bad deal, we would have ordered off the menu and not wasted our hopes on what we thought would be a very good dinner. Instead we felt kind of ripped off. With SO MANY SUSHI places to choose from, I won't be going back to Sushi Delight and it's unfortunate in that they are roughly 1/4 of a block from my house.  \n\nMy advice would be, just be fair, give you what offer and you'll draw in customers.

But then I saw a banner for all you can eat AND drink sushi and alcohol for $29 and my interest was instantly piqued. So my partner and I tried it one night, preparing to feast, which we definitely did. The space is nothing to write home about and the place smelled slightly of urine, although after 5 minutes my nose adjusted and I didn't smell it anymore. I'm sure it wasn't urine, but probably the cleaning chemicals in the rug. Still, not a selling point if you're sensitive to smells. \n\nThe sushi was just ok. The specialties rolls are the best, but the maki was so-so. The texture of the rice was rubbery which seemed odd to me. You can order anything you want from the regular menu, which was great, although you can only order two things at a time to cut down on possible waste(understandable).  They had all the most popular Japanese beers, served just slightly less cold than they should be, but being the boozers we are, we plugged through about 4 large beers and a few sakes.\n\nThe restaurant is located next to The Mint karaoke bar and they even have a TV screen dedicated to showing off the aspiring artists drunkenly belting out Journey songs next door. Actually pretty entertaining to be honest--I can't believe how wasted people can be at 6 in the evening!  \n\nSo we left the restaurant practically comatose feeling we definitely got our money's worth and then some.  One strange thing happened afterwards though: both my partner and I had to pee almost every half hour after the meal and then got up at least 5 times during the night. I can't imagine what could have been a diuretic in sushi, but something really got to us. Just thought I'd mention it in case it's happened to anyone else. It was really bizarre!\n\nAnyways, I'm going to discount the peeing issues and  may try it again seeing it is a value proposition.

The cherry blossom sushi (8 pieces for around $11) is delicious. Regular sushi (around 6 pieces) costs about $5, so it's good if you're on a budget. \n\nInside, it's very, very casual. A date took me here once and the atmosphere was flat. The decor is... well... um... absent? However, they have a door at the side of the room that links the restaurant to The Mint (a fun karaoke bar) next door. They have absolutely no problem with people going into The Mint to eat and will bring the food to you.\n\nIf you want to eat at The Mint, you go into the restaurant, go to the cashier (at the back of the restaurant), and tell them you'd like to eat next door. You will be given a menu. You place your order and pay up front. They will ask you roughly where you'll be sitting, then they'll bring your food to you. \n\nI've always found the waitresses to be sweet and pleasant!", "author": "Emma R."}

The only problem was that everything was slightly warm. Not only their fish, but the \"iced\" water was warm. That was so weird to me. I understand that it was a warm day and the fish shouldn't be FROZEN. But it was WARM! Like left out for a long time or was in the microwave for defrosting.

After circling around Market for what seemed like ages, my friends and I stopped inside here since we love sushi. I should have realized its proximity to the Mint but I had no idea they were connected. Because they are. In the worst possible way.\n\nSo they are not the same owners, but this place allows Mint customers to come over via a flimsy swinging door. So not only do you hear the LOUDEST, most dreadful karaoke being drunkenly yelled, you will also have loud, drunk patrons stumbling in via the swinging door, loudly ordering sushi. And the worst part is that the restaurant prioritizes these patrons. I'm sure it's because they don't want them waiting around or coming in/out but still. \n\nBut the noise, it will haunt you. We had the unenviable evening of hearing \"Don't Stop Believin,\" some Christina Aguilera and some No Doubt. We wanted to kill ourselves. After just two rolls, we couldn't handle it anymore and begged for the check and left.\n\nThe plus side is that the sushi chef on this particular Friday evening was quite hot. But the waiter was rather rude and brusque. The butter fish was pretty good but the sushi was ridiculously cold. I don't think they know how to make sushi properly for a non-drunken Mint crowd. I'm sure if you're drunk and singing Journey, you won't mind that your spicy tuna roll is filled with all kinds of vegetables that shouldn't be in spicy tuna rolls.

Once you order, Sushi Delight will bring your meal right to you at the bar--super convenient. \n\nI usually order the bento box with three items out of over a dozen to choose from (including California rolls, pork or chicken katsu, potato croquettes, sashimi, veggie or assorted tempura, spring rolls., etc.). \n\nI'm not the biggest fish fan, which rules out a lot of Sushi places, but Sushi Delight has lots of yummy non-fish options.  The teriyaki beef is always lean and flavorful, cut in little strips, the gyoza is nicely browned on one side, but not tough, the interior stuffing is moist. I also love the teriyaki tofu (silly, I know, with the beef and potstickers), which comes lightly fried with a sweet sauce. Every bento box comes with rice, miso soup, and a small salad with lettuce and cucumbers and a yummy sesame dressing. The rest of my family loves their California Rolls, which are a great deal during happy hour.\n\nThe food is brought to your table promptly, and the staff is always adept and cordial (especially Tinkerbell).\n\nI really appreciate that they accept cards, which lets me save my cash for The Mint.", "author": "Umilia M."}

In addition to everything taking too long, we never got individual plates (and how do you share drippy agedashi tofu without your own plate?) and couldn't get our drinks refilled.\n\nFood: Not good...agedashi tofu was like no agedashi tofu I'd ever seen before.  Sliced tofu, fried, then sitting on a plate dry with only some scallions as topping.  The sauce was served in a saucer on the side.  Strange and bland.  I got the nigiri sampler, the fish did not taste particularly fresh, and some pieces were quite chewy.\n\nAmbiance: The space is fine, the karoake on the CCTV was funny.

My fear of karaoke had already been smashed this night and to my surprise, the fare from S.D. also surpassed my expectations. I guess it was a night of good new experiences. \n\nTo be perfectly honest I never stepped foot into the actual restaurant but was impressed that they were able to find us through the drunken messes of people next door. Another patron was eating some katsu don and said that he was decently impressed. So I went for the spider roll (soft shell crab), voodoo roll (spicy tuna, cucumber, deep fried and then topped with more tuna and seaweed) and a some saba nigiri.  I also got to try some of the 49er roll which had salmon, unagi, avocado and lemon.  Everything was pretty darn tasty and the voodoo roll was intriguing enough, that it caught the attention of the girls sitting next to us. \n\nAgain my skepticism was shattered (2 for 2 on the night), I actually really enjoyed the food,  and now I have a late night place for sushi", "author": "Kim N."}

The sweet crunchiness of seawood salad combined with the spicy smoothness of tuna sashimi is AMAZING! It's like a flavor explosion in my mouth.

I even slurp up all the juicy goodness left behind in the shell after the oyster has been devoured. YUM! \n\nThere's also a live video feed of the karaoke bar next door (The Mint, I believe) and that can provide for some entertainment.

We tried the salmon, the hamachi, butterfish special, and the hamachi toro and did not regret it.  The only minor issues was the cut of the hamachi was not a great cut.  The seaweed salad was refereshing and a delight.  The other items we ordered were disappointing though.  Among those, the tempura was very oily and the batter very heavy.  I definitely wouldn't order the tempura appetizer again.  The shrimp tempura also dried up the shrimp.  The shrimp tempura roll was also oily and bland.  My boyfriend enjoyed the dynamite roll but I again found the oil that it was deep-fried in to be too heavy on the roll.\n\nThe sake options are limited but not unreasonably priced.\n\nThe service, as many other reviewers have mentioned, took a long time since there was one server for the entire place.  Two girls who sat after us but closer to the waiter actually got their order and their food before us.

After waiting about 25 minutes for what takes most other sushi places about 5-10, I get a pretty looking arrangement of 2 things I ordered -- a Salmon Skin roll covered with fresh salmon and a oshinko roll on the side.\n\nJust with the plate sitting below my nose I already get an awful aroma of foul fish.  This was my first indication that something was wrong.\n\nI attempt to eat a few bites.  I'll admit, I managed to consume a few bites of this stuff, just to see if maybe I'm overreacting.  But the taste is worse than the smell.  The seaweed on the rolls is the consistency of plastic wrap. I feel like I just ate a day-old piece of sushi.   I thought, maybe the oshinko roll will be better.  After all, it's just one ingredient - pickled radish.\n\nBut the oshinko roll is no better.  Actually, it tastes kind of toxic.  It tastes like it's definitely expired.  So here I am with my pint of cider from the bar (unfortunately only my first), and it's the only thing here that tastes good.\n\nI finally decide to go next door and return the 1/3 eaten plate of sushi.  I've totally lost my appetite and I'm really bummed that I just spent $15 on this garbage.  Maybe they could be nice and make me something else or give me a refund.\n\nI bring my plate back and the cashier grabs it from me instantly.  I tell them I'm unsatisfied, the fish is not fresh and the oshinko tastes funny.  The chef tells me \"gosh, we've never heard anything like that before.\"  I sit there for another minute just hoping maybe they will offer me one word of support to brighten my mood after I've been made to feel sick, ripped off, and still pretty hungry.  But they just give me a blank stare like I'm some kind of crazy person.\n\nSo my disappointment is not just about the food, but being given absolutely shameful service.  If I would have been given a replacement dish or even an apology, I would have at least left not feeling completely humiliated.\n\nI have a few recommendations if you ever sink low enough to eat here:\n1) don't order anything with raw fish -- preferably get something deep fried to kill off any bad bacteria\n2) make sure you load up on mayonnaise and soy sauce so you can't taste whatever tainted ingredient they have today.", "author": "Evie S."}

The place is pretty plain, like hundreds of middle of the road sushi places. I was bummed that normally during their happy hour, they offer an oyster special but it was not available that day. We didn't take advantage of the other choices which was a special on California Rolls (I'm not a fan...blah) and 2 for 1 sake. Now to the good! Other than my initial impression, we had a very enjoyable time. Our server was attentive and the food was good. We ordered: \n\nCombo A - Maguro (red tuna), Shiro Maguro (white tuna), Hamachi (yellowtail), Saba (mackerel), Sake (salmon), Tai (red snapper) with miso soup and salad. This was the highlight of the night! The fish was so fresh it almost gleamed...! I couldn't put my finger on what else was special about it but my bf pointed it out. They don't press down on the fish. Some places will almost mash the fish into the rice that it almost loses its texture. But at Sushi Delight, all the fish are just sitting on the rice. Couldn't stop putting those beautiful and tasty niguris in my mouth. I was so sad when we ate them all. =( \n\n49er Roll - Eel and avocado topped with salmon and sliced lemon. Again all very fresh! I like the lemon taste but I never like eating lemon slices. I'm glad the lemon slices were small so I didn't feel guilty pulling it off the fish. \n\nAlaska Roll - Salmon and avocado. I'm happy the fish was not lost in the rice! It was very flavorful. I could taste every ingredient. \n\nFuto Maki - Egg, Shitake, Avocado, Cucumber, Spinach. Do all Futo Makis have avocado? Because this was the first time I really tasted it! I love avocado so this was a great thing. The egg was really good too, sweet and fluffy.\n\nSpicy Scallop - Self explainatory. Bf said it was really spicy. I'm weaksauce so I don't eat spicy things. \n\nI have a feeling that Sushi Delight reads yelp reviews so a big thank you to our server who caught the questionable smug on my plate! I was just about to wipe it off but she turned around, said she caught that too and said she'd replace it. Is it just me and my mom or are other people used to wiping down plates/bowls with their napkins and tea when they eat out?

Hopefully that isn't always bad.\n\nSo while I already feel you guys hating me because I gave this place more than 3 stars, hear me out.\n\nLike I said, I'm mainly a sushi guy.  I'll try a roll here and there, but the base of my experience is all about raw fish on rice.  The fish here was excellent and extremely fresh.  In fact, I had to stop myself from eating like a starved hog.  My main complaint of course, was the fish pieces were a little small.  We're not talking tiny, but it's nice when the rice is mostly (if not completely) obscured by the fish.  This was not the case but the fish was really tasty.  Additionally I feel that $15 for 12 pieces (combo A, sucka) of sushi is a deal in the city.  I'm interested in going for the $1 oyster happy hour.\n\nI was ready to downgrade this to a 3 after consuming my spicy salmon roll.  While it was fresh, it was relatively tasteless.  I had to bump it back up when I tried the caterpillar roll.  I think it was eel inside covered with avocado.  It was amazing.  I had to convince my dining partner she was full so she'd let me eat the rest.  It didn't work and I had to trade her some salmon.\n\nOverall, it's a great place for what it is; a tiny neighborhood sushi joint.  Yeah, it's on Market Street but it never makes claims of being anything more and even eschews the ubiquitous \"best sushi in town\" tag a lot of places like to throw on their menus.  The staff were all insanely nice and I think I heard \"thank you\" about 8 times before I left.     \n\nIf you live nearby and are tired of relying on Hanabi for your weekly sushi fix, this is more than worth the walk.", "author": "Steven R."}

From that moment on, she had an attitude and we felt like we were not welcomed. She said we were not allowed to use the coupon because it was not printed out (restaurant.com states that coupons do not need to be printed out). We asked to speak to a manager and she went to the back in a fury. Another 10mins went by and no manager appeared. I then approached the server and sushi chef behind the counter and asked what was going on. The server pretended like she  had no idea what I was talking about. I asked her again to see the Manager. She said fine yet stood there and did nothing. At this point, I realized that if I were to stay my food would probably end up with spit in it so we left. We left on my birthday, without food and with a very bad image of sushi delight. \n\nManagement: Server was female, asian, long black hair. We were there on 3/14 @ 8pm.", "author": "Maria C."}

I was raised on it. I also respect the creative sushi chefs out there that jazz up their rolls... it's what keeps it fun...\n\nIn my humble (lived in Japan for a while) opinion, they use too much eel. There was eel in almost every roll here. I find that boring, too safe, and everything just ends up tasting the same. \n\nWe asked to get the 49er Roll without eel, because I have never seen it with eel before, and the chef about had a heart attack. I know that sushi chefs don't like to be questioned, but go to any sushi place... and there isn't quite as much eel....\n\nTo their credit, it is fun watching the terrible karaoke going on next door on the screen behind the chefs.\n\nAn alright place for basics. Not a good roll spot. (Unless you really like eel!)", "author": "Megan D."}

Their seaweed salad is an absolute delight, so scrumptious, tasty and generously portioned.  I got the Dynamite Roll and it was pretty damn tasty, I keep reading about this Voodoo Roll so next time i think i'll definitely have to give that a shot.  The prices are very reasonable, and the quality of the food is totally worth it.  \n\n  The service was friendly, even if we did get shushed!  What's even better is that this place is connected by just a heavy door to Mint right next door where you can bust out your tunes after having a few sake bombs too many.

The only reason we even knew this place existed was because my bf bought a coupon deal for this \"restaurant.\" It was a BAD sign that the restaurant was completely empty, but we decided to give it a try. I had glanced at the ratings and reviews on yelp so I was not ignorant to the fact that it was next to the Mint. I just didn't realize how loud it would be. Try incredibly loud. You can hear all the bass and singing, the walls reverberate. And for some reason, Sushi Delight's staff is ridiculous enough to have their own music on at the same time. It's a maddening combination. We asked them to turn their music off so we would only have to listen to one really loud thing, but they only turned it down a little. Then, right after we ordered food, we realized we just couldn't take it so we asked for our food to go, they said they wouldn't allow take out with a coupon deal, we balked. \"What's the difference,\" we asked. We said we couldn't stand the noise and were told (more than once) that 'if we don't like the noise we can leave, they can't do anything about it. If we want a high-end place, then go.' We did. The loud noise wasn't their fault, but the bad attitude is.

Its a cute little space, very clean (always a +), the prices are reasonable & the food is pretty good I'd say so we'll def be back when we get our cravings for Japanese. It's also pretty cool to watch the karaoke \"stars\" from next door :)  I do have to say that the waitress was not so great, she was nice & all but a bit pushy and almost verging on rude - I don't think she was trying to be but my husband ordered a sushi roll and finished it all but one piece - because he didn't like that type of fish but decided to try it anyway. She sorta scolded him on not finishing the fish & told him next time to NOT order that kind of fish since he didn't like it - it was just not nice the way she said it, you could tell she was trying to be nice about it but she was coming off as being annoyed. While we saw her point - we did pay for the food & he didnt intentionally waste the food...it was just overbearing & it was an odd way to talk to paying customers....but other than that it was good.", "author": "Kimberly R."}
