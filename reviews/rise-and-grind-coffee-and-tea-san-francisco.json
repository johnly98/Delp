I ordered the Creme Brulee Latte ($5) which to my surprise came out with a crunchy caramelized top just like a creme brulee! It was sweet, might be too sweet for some, so I personally wouldn't order it again. I also ordered a Pesto Toast ($7) which was yummy!

Loooved this, and reasonably priced. \n\nBreakfast bunwich Sandwich ($7.50) - Pretty decent sandwich, with bacon, boiled egg, avocado, and thousand island dressing, but I would say it's a little overpriced for the size of it. Comes warm wrapped in foil. \n\nAvocado toast ($9.25) - I really really love avocado toast but I can't justify the price of this! Almost $10 for a thick piece of toast, soft boiled egg, and chili flakes. Although this was delicious, it's definitely overpriced compared to other places where I paid around $7 for the same thing.

The big, beautifully golden brown crispy disks of Chocolate Chip Cookie in their case also looked really tempting but I stuck to liquids today.\n\nBoth drinks are tasty but imho, the Mint Cold Brew edges out the PB Latte. I never thought mint and coffee would taste good together but there is sorcery in this and it totally works. Refreshing yet invigorating ;-) \n\nThe staff are super friendly, thank you! Great service always appreciated!\n\nThere are a few of those annoying hover-and-fly-in-eye-level-circles flies that seem to haunt San Francisco entryways, but I think those petty pests would linger inside a hospital lobby too. What is their deal?! Maybe some fly paper hidden off to the side would entrap them... I can dream. \n\nBonus Points: A few loaded bookshelves inset high up on a wall -- and lots of community artwork. Cool! But did I miss a ladder or how do you get a book? You'd have to be a Shaq O'Neal to reach them if you stood on a chair. But maybe I needed more caffeine to accurately judge book-hopping.

St first glance, I thought it might be overly sweet but it was mildly sweet and just right! It's a tad bit on the dry side, or rather on the cakey side, but I didn't mind that since there was ample sauce and since I had my London fog latte.

I really like their Avocado Toast made on a single thick slice of bread.  One of my favorite things to have anytime of the day.  This time I ordered one with an extra soft-boiled egg & asked for NO chili flakes.  I don't like chili flakes at all.  Although it was delicious I had to scrape off the chili flakes when it was brought to my table. They forgot :-( ... luckily I can stand only just a little bit of heat, but next time I will have to return it if they forget again, I just hate wasting food.", "author": "Emy B."}

Not too often do you walk into a cafe and can immediately tell how much dedication and hard work has been put into an establishment just by the atmosphere and vibes. I absolutely fell in love with the window space and the amount of sunlight you get once inside, it can literally brighten up your day! You can find inspirational quotes all around the cafe which adds a nice touch to start your morning with, or if you're ever feeling down!\n\nRise and Grind is a fairly new cafe with a few kinks here and there to be worked out once they settle in, but they are doing a splendid job so far from what I can see. Their menus are short and quick to the point although I can see that they are planning and trying new flavors in the process! I've only tried a few drinks but absolutely fell in love with their CREME BR\u00dbL\u00c9E LATTE!!!! 5 stars. Soooo bomb and resembles the dessert perfectly! I also recommend their toasts, any of them!! I like them all. The avocado, tomato & pesto, or corn toast. Also all 5 stars. \n\nThere's also a good amount of seating so you can come in to study or catch up with some friends while enjoying a cup of joe. Service is extremely friendly and efficient. It may take a bit longer to receive your drink though, I must admit, if they're busy or depending on what you order but it's usually not an issue unless you're in a rush. \n\nGive this place a try (if you're in the area or not), you definitely won't regret it.", "author": "Sunia L."}

I usually never drink coffee because it tends to just put me to sleep (yes I'm weird, I know) but I actually feel caffeinated with their drinks. I highly recommend the mint cold brew, which has a nice subtle mint flavor and isn't bitter like regular black coffee. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e latte is delicious as well - not overly sweet, and they even torch the drink just like regular creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. \n\nThey also have toasts and pastries not displayed on the menu above the register. I've only tried the pesto toast, and while it was a little pricey at $6.50, it was very tasty. I liked that the pesto wasn't incredibly oily and that the tomatoes and pepperoni were evenly distributed throughout, and I loved how the crispy crust contrasted with the fluffy inside of the bread. The avocado toast seems to be a popular item as well, although I haven't tried it. Food can be a little slow to come out, but they're very accommodating of any special requests. \n\nThe atmosphere of this coffeeshop definitely bumps up my rating to five stars. The owners are both super friendly and welcoming as soon as customers walk in the door, and the decorations are so unique. I especially like the signs in the restroom and randomly misspelled words hanging on the walls LOL. However, the absolute best part is Cory, the owners' pet corgi!! He's social and very distracting when I'm trying to get work done, but also incredibly well behaved. There's not a whole lot of seating but it's spacious enough for people to do work, and they have a bunch of power strips lining the walls too.\n\nBottom line: strong coffee, delicious food, cute puppy!", "author": "KC W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-18", "description": "I wanted to mix up my rotation of coffee shops in San Francisco so I decided to visit Rise & Grind. This is a cute spot in the Richmond tucked away on 8th Ave. right off Fulton. Keep in mind, this isn't a very big cafe so seating is limited should you come during peak hours. There is one communal table, a handful of stools facing the window and the wall to the left, and several tables for two. (If you plan to work on your laptop while visiting, note that electrical outlets are limited.) The restroom is to the left of the cafe while the ordering area/kitchen is to the right. \n\nRise & Grind offers sandwiches, toast, and of course, the most important stuff and biggest contribution to one's productivity: coffee/espresso (and tea). I recently stopped by during the mid-morning hours for an iced hazelnut latte. While I was tempted to try their more creative-sounding lattes, I often like to try the basics upon my first visit to most coffeeshops. The latte was good though I could barely taste hazelnut. There was definitely a syrup in the latte but it did not taste like the signature flavor of hazelnut so that was a bit disappointing. As I sat and worked for a bit, I started to get hungry. Since my productivity was on a roll, I decided to grab a sandwich as well. I ordered their breakfast sandwich which consisted of bacon, avocado, boiled egg, cheese, and (I believe) some type of aioli. They let me know that instead of the customary biscuit they served it in, they now served the sandwich in an artisan roll. Fine with me! It was delicious though I wish the cheese was melted down a bit more. I also recall the egg being cold. While some folks might like that, I typically like everything warm or hot for a breakfast sandwich (minus the avocado, of course!). The aioli, while also good, was also a bit too much for the size of the sandwich. I'm not big into sauces in my sandwiches so perhaps I would go easy on the dressing should I order this again. I had an iced ginger peach tea with the sandwich -- refreshing!\n\nIn terms of service, the baristas were friendly and welcoming. \n\nOverall, Rise & Grind is a great place to grab some caffeine+a light bite, and to read, socialize, or work.", "author": "James Z."}

The interior is cozy and has a fair amount of seating so you can definitely come in, grab a coffee, and sit down to get some work done. I ordered the avocado toast *minus the egg* and a vanilla latte. The toast and coffee came out at a good pace and I was happy to find that the latte was at a good, hot temperature. Tastewise the toast was good, but nothing great. The thing for me is, if I'm paying ~$9 for avocado toast, I expect it to be somewhat mindblowing or at least something removed from the mundane. However, this was just bread with some avocado and some simple seasoning. Simple is great, but I just felt like there was so much more they could have done with it. My vanilla latte was good, but like I said before, nothing extraordinary about it. This is a cute shop to drop by if you are in the area, but I wouldn't make it my go to destination.", "author": "Lakshmi M."}

The place was understandably crowded, but for a small caffe there were an awful lot of people just sitting around with empty coffee cups, studying or just doing nothing at all. My friend and I had to squeeze standing into a one-person space at the bar because some girl next to us was watching youtube and nursing a soda. If you have a popular and small place and you're going to ask 'for here or to go', you might want to make sure tweens arent taking up all your space all day. Perhaps establish a time limit, ask people to leave soon after they finish their drink/snack, or at least put up signs asking your patrons to be courteous.\nI got the vanilla latte and the matcha waffle. The waffle was sweet and yummy but didnt taste the first thing like matcha, so if you want just a sweet, green-colored, insta-worthy waffle I suggest it. The latte was also insta-worthy but otherwise unremarkable.\nTo me the place felt like its entire point was aesthetic, with no real hospitality or quality. Won't go back.", "author": "Laura G."}

The stark white walls of this small shop were covered in art riffing on Microsoft Word, lots of exposed concrete beams and wood grain furniture. That said, it worked for me - it felt quirky without being contrived and cool without being pretentious. It didn't look like a super cozy place to set up on a laptop and do work, but it was cute to sit and have a quick coffee.\n\nDrinks: We didn't have any bites to eat (although they looked yummy, with standard SF pricing,) but I was very satisfied with my hot beverage! I ordered the Chai Latte, and was offered a sweet or spicy option. I chose the spicy option, which tasted of fresh ginger and was delicious! My friend got a mocha which he said was solid. And, the prices felt super reasonable, especially considering that each drink was made to order (I think my chai was brewed to order? Not actually sure...but it was definitely not a standard mix!) The wait was a little long, but not unreasonable.\n\nOverall, a really nice spot to pop in and grab a drink to go whilst meandering GGP or escape a cool gray day and warm up with something tasty!", "author": "Alex F."}

The moment I walked in the owners and workers greeted and welcomed me, which is quite important as first impressions really set the tone of a cafe experience. \n\nThey serve Mr. Espresso coffee beans, which I heard is roasted with oakwood. Clearly they know how to utilize and sell a quality product because their lattes are each individually, uniquely, skillfully, and deliciously-made. Co-owner and barista, Vashelle knows how to make a mean cup o joe! \n\nThe other guys who own and work there are really friendly people too. Brian and Vananson both always seem down to have a chat and get to know their customers. You can really tell that they are passionate about not only what they sell, but also the surrounding community; fundamental in order for them to learn how to better serve the neighborhood.\n\nIf you're in the area, don't hesitate to stop by, say hello, grab a bite to eat (they serve waffles, WAFFLES!!!!) and have your coffee and your day made.\n\nP.s.

Everything on the menu from the food to the drinks is delicious, but it's all also uniquely one of a kind. I live down the street from Rise & Grind and couldn't have been more pleased to have a local coffee spot with great food and even nicer employees open when they did a few months ago. They have a variety of specialty drinks like the creme brulee latte, cookie butter latte and their newly added Richmond chill, which is their version of Vietnamese coffee with espresso and condensed milk shaken up in a cocktail mixer. If you're not a big coffee drinker I highly recommend the London fog.\n\nI've tried almost all of the food items and have to put the Avocado Toast at the top of the list; a delicious thick piece of toast topped with a nice hearty spread of fresh avocado, red chili flakes, and a soft boiled egg. It will surely leave you full for hours. The breakfast biscuit is another one of my favorites as well as the Pesto Toast (AMAZING), but their variety of waffles if especially delicious and one of a kind. My favorite is the Matcha waffle. Try it, you're taste buds will thank me.\n\nAlong with all the great menu items, the environment and staff are something that makes Rise & Grind especially enjoyable for me. The owners have gone out of their way to put local artists work on the walls and the business has a number of regulars you'll often see every time you go in. There's a great communal and hospitable vibe that keeps me coming back for more. To add to all the greatness of Rise & Grind, there is Cori the corgi, the resident dog who sets up camp at the spot every day and greets customers with a big smile. He's always willing to be played with and adds to the greatness of the baristas. If I could, I'd give Rise & Grind 10 stars but Yelp only lets me give 5. This is a must try coffee spot if you're in the neighborhood or go through this part of town.", "author": "Niko L."}

I got a London Fog hot tea which was AMAZING and the avocado toast which was also mind blowing. Positives: drink was great and sweet, toast was on really soft brioche like bread (nice and thick), avocado was super fresh, egg was just the right amount of soft. Negatives: the tea comes in a tiny cup so you are paying like $4 for an x-small drink (done in 3 sips) and they don't have a \"large\" option only 1 size. Toast is $9.

It was close by to our air bnb and seemed cool. The first day my friend got iced mocha and I had a soy chai latte .. both were good. The next day was as if it was a totally different place. My friend got a vanilla latte this time and I got the same soy ice chai latte ... the soy chai latte tasted like a Luke warm cup of soy milk. The latte was okay, but not worthy of a repeat purchase. \n\nWe also had the Belgian waffle which was dry and barely had anything on it  .. they had no syrup. When I asked for syrup the girl said \" we don't have it.. that's why we put the icing on it\".  Which would be fine! If there was enough of it. \n\nBut, my biggest issue with this place was their effort to be hip and cool ... being met with not a single vegetarian / vegan or progressive food option ... there is pepperoni on one of the menu items and this to me is just careless. They serve their iced dine in drinks in mason jars ( all the rage) but their avocado toast has hard boiled eggs on it ( a usual safe vegan option) \n\nOverall this place doesn't seem consistent. To go two days in a row and have a completely different experience the second day is concerning. Also, get some vegan options... this is San Francisco and it's 2017.", "author": "Vee R."}

My only complaint is their coffee sucks (ironic, isn't it?). Yes, their coffee is terrible. A $4 cup of cappuccino was extremely small and tasted like bitter water.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-08", "description": "This place is near where I work.  I come here about once a week.  The folks seem friendly and the atmosphere is relaxed and open.  They have some graphics and art on display, and I believe they're open to local artists contributing their pieces for ambiance and possibly sale.  \n\nI haven't had a chance to sit and try some of their food items so I can't give a full review, but this is a solid place to grab a hot beverage and maybe chit chat with folks.", "author": "V.

Plus they are always playing country music or NSYNC. So basically I love coming in. I tend to stick the the usual cappuccino or latte but I'll have to try some of the specialty drinks after reading other reviews!", "author": "Amanda D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-05", "description": "I was looking for a place to grab a quick bite with my kids after a visit from the Academy of Sciences. I ordered the avocado toast with no peppers and the waffle. After what seemed like a long wait, the toast came with peppers. I didn't feel like waiting another 10 mins to have them fix it. I ended up eating the toast as my kids didn't like pepper so they ate the waffle. Overall, I would probably not order the food again. I did get the drip coffee and it was good and strong.", "author": "Jen T."}

Aside from its charm and tasty Mr. Expresso coffee, the staff are warm, friendly, and welcoming. So lucky to have this spot in my neighborhood!", "author": "Jessie H."}

My sister recommended this place to me since it's close to my apartment. I love how the place is super spacious and tastefully decorated! It gives off a simple and cozy vibe. I ordered an iced vanilla latte and it was served to me in a cute mason jar. I think this place is perfect for students like me to study and drink delicious coffee while at it! Will definitely be going back", "author": "Anelise T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-03-18", "description": "I come here randomly because it's right where I can transfer from the 5 to the 44. It has a nice atmosphere and a lot of people are relaxing on computers and reading. The menu has a lot of unique flavors. The coffee is alright but it's always barely warm when I receive it and the strawberry banana muffin was exciting but ended up being chewy and not too flavorful. They're never very crowded when I come in but I always end up standing around waiting for someone to notice I'm there/to answer me. I've gone a few times for convenience but not much else.", "author": "Laticia L."}

The cafe has a modern industrial look to it and has a very comfortable atmosphere to it. The staff and owners, Vy and Vashelle, are beyond amazing and friendly people. They will go the extra mile to make sure you are satisfied and happy. Rise & Grind serves delicious coffee, pastries, and toast.
