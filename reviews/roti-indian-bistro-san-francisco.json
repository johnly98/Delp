I came here on Sunday for dinner with my boyfriend for the first time and my god the food was incredible!\n\nThe service was amazing - only had to wait about ~10-15 minutes for our 5 dishes to be brought out. Our server was so attentive and sweet.\n\nWe ordered the Paneer Makhani, Bhindi Masala, Garlic Naan, tandoori game hen and yogurt. We asked to get the dishes relatively spicy (7.5/10) but it wasn't actually really spicy at all. So if you like spicy foods, you should aim for an even higher number.\n\nEverything was sooo good.

We ordered their seasonal butternut squash soup, a chaat fruit salad, paneer makhani, baingan bharta and a kashmiri biryani. The soup was delicious, but a little on the heavy side for a summer appetizer. We ordered two soups between four people, but I still felt very full before the rest of the food even arrived. The chaat fruit salad was delicious, but nothing special - just fruit with some chaat masala sprinkled on. The paneer makhani and baingan bharta were solid, and definitely made the meal. This was my first time experiencing kashmiri biryani, as I generally don't enjoy sweet dishes, but it was very well made and added a different flavor to the meal.\n\nTheir service was great - the waiter took into account our request for the dishes to be \"Indian\" spicy, and the owner came by and personally checked on our table more than once - a very nice gesture, especially on a busy Friday evening.", "author": "Apoorva A."}

The service is great, and the food is plentiful and tasty, and you aren't breaking the bank as you would at some of the other higher end Indian restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nFor those looking for truly \"authentic\" Indian food, Roti is a great place to start. While they boast their modern Indian cuisine and get creative with their naans, you are getting the traditional flavors of North India with every dish.\n\nRoti's staff and service create a warm and welcoming vibe, which simply enhances your dining experience. They are responsive and friendly, and the owner will take time to meet with you, and check up on you.\n\nFor vegetarians, I recommend the paneer makhani, the navrattan korma, and palak paneer. Always get the \"Roti's Bread Basket\" so you can taste a variety of naans, including my personal favorite, the garlic and basil naan.\n\nParking isn't always easy so plan to spend a few extra minutes looking on the side streets to park.

I love that. I tire of restaurants whose \"spicy\" is actually mild. Don't dumb down my palate! Roti's medium is moderately spicy, and the spicy will make your body sweat. I love that esp on cold winter nights! \n\nCream, spices, nuts, and protein will do that to you. \n\nI have also ordered delivery multiple times. When they deliver, everything is piping hot, containers are filled to brim, and the food arrives really fast. \n\nRoti, thank you for feeding my family so well over the years. \n\nNow if the San Mateo location were anything like this location - id go there a lot too! \n\nMy favorites: \nVeggie Samosas\n\nChicken Pakoras\n\nChicken Korma Medium Spicy \n\nGarlic Naan \n\nBasmati \n\nInterestingly enough I do not like the spinach here.

First of all, for such a small and intimate restaurant, the staff was very accommodating with the size of our party. We called ahead to make a reservation since there were so many of us and when we arrived, they had tables reserved for us towards the back of the restaurant. \n\nI'm ashamed to say this, but it was my first time trying Indian food and I can't believe it's taken me this long! The food here at Roti is absolutely wonderful! Everything we ordered was delicious and even the picky eaters in my family found something that they liked!\n\nCucumber Raita- Homemade yogurt with cucumber, caraway, and cumin. The Raita reminded me of Tzatziki, a similar dish that originates in Greece. Everything tasted good with a dab of Raita on it, especially the Garlic and Basil Naan.\n\nGarlic and Basil Naan- Don't even think twice about it. You have to order this! I don't know what this stuff is made of, but it was flavorful and extremely fresh. I mean, it was so fresh that it was too hot to touch! The Naan was crispy and thin, perfect to dip in the leftover sauce from the Chicken Tikka Masala. Do it!\n\nRoti's Basmati Pulao- Basmati rice cooked with saffron, cumin, cardamon, and bay leaves. Us Filipinos eat just about everything with rice and there was no way in hell that I was going to have curry without rice. It's just not right! The Basmati Pulao smelled wonderful. It was extremely aromatic! Long-grain, similar to Jasmine rice, it was very light and definitely went well with all of the dishes.\n\nChicken Vindaloo- Would this meal have been complete without curry? Absolutely not, people. The chicken was very tender and the potatoes were cooked just right. Sauce was amazing. I ordered it a little milder than it usually comes because the \"hot and spicy\" description on the menu scared me. To my surprise, the mild sauce didn't have much spiciness to it. I'd definitely order it again, but next time, bring on the heat! \n\nChicken Tikka (Tandoori Specialties)- Boneless chicken breasts marinated with ginger, garlic, spices and herbs. Presentation of this dish was awesome. The chunks of chicken breast were plated on top of mixed vegetables and the entire dish was steaming when the server brought it out from the kitchen. Don't forget to squeeze a little fresh lemon on the chicken!\n\nRoti serves the dishes family-style, so the portions are huge. The menu is reasonably priced, considering you're in West Portal. No complaints here!\n\nOur dining experience at Roti was amazing and I'm looking forward to my next visit to San Francisco just to eat here again! The staff was friendly and professional, ambiance of the restaurant was very warm and relaxing, and the food was of good quality. Thank you, Roti!", "author": "Jordan I."}

I truly fell the need to note this since my past few dinner visits with my husband were less than stellar... busy servers ignoring us, taking forever to hand off the bill, no refills, etc. \n\nI took my good friend and her three month old baby (my godson) out for lunch. She's never eaten Indian food and I insisted on Roti. \n\nSetting: It was an exceptionally busy weekday (Thursday) lunch. NEVER have I EVER seen that many groups of people at Roti for lunch at 11:55 in the morning. EVER. \n\nDanny was the only server working. He immediately greeted us, saw our reservation, and provided adequate space for the baby. Danny was polite and answered food questions thoughtfully. His performance was impressive, as Danny was the only server managing eight tables. \n\nHe never rushed us, food came efficiently, hot chai tea cups were always full. 10/10 for Danny. Great job!\n\nPro Tip 1: Roti lunch hours are very limited. 11:30-1:45. If you show up at 1pm or after they will not seat you for lunch. Their cuisine takes time to prepare and serve. This ain't BK.

Roti was closing in about 30 minutes from when we got there, but they graciously took us and had no problems with us taking our time to dine there.  Hubs has been here before years ago.  Roti is a nicer Indian place with slightly higher prices, and you don't smell like curry when you leave, that's a plus!\n\nTo start off we all ordered a mango lassi.  It was thick, creamy, and flavorful.  One of, if not the best lassi I've had to date.  We also ordered: an order and a half of samosas (one order includes two), garlic naan, chicken tikka masala, a special tandoori cornish hen, and palak paneer (spinach paneer), and an order of basmati rice.  Part of me thinks we over ordered, or maybe because all the food came close together, but portions were generous too.  Samosas were thick and spiced right.  I would've wanted them warmer though.  The tikka masala was moist but could've used more flavor in my opinion.  I always love soaking up the extra sauce with the naan, and their garlic naan was perfectly crispy, not too thick, and I could actually taste the garlic  - during and after.  The cornish hen was a bit difficult to eat as they were served halfwise.  I liked the spices and it was moist, but wished it was meatier.  I appreciated how the cornish hen was served with mixed greens, because I'm all about getting  more veggies for a well balanced meal.  I had to try it as it was a special, but next time I would've preferred just sticking with traditional tandoori chicken or ordering another vegetarian dish.  I typically don't care for paneer, but their spinach paneer was so good!  The spinach wasn't bitter at all, the paneer was mild and the mix was blended well.  The basmati rice was standard.  \n\nService was attentive enough, bathroom was clean, and the restaurant has nice decor.  I don't believe there's many options for Indian food in the general area (one would probably need to head to the Richmond), and Roti has nicer decor than most Indian restaurants, but for more flavor, but not necessarily spice, as I like it more mild - slightly medium on the spice level, I'd suggest hitting other Indian restaurants that are a bit more friendlier on their wallet as well.

I didn't catch the waitress's name, but she was the only blonde haired/Caucasian/female working there. She was so nice to me and was patient with me as I looked over the menu. I let them know that someone would be joining me in about an hour but that I wanted to get started with some food. They were very kind and understanding. I ordered the vegetarian samosas, Chana masala, and garlic naan. The food was delicious and it was beautifully plated. My girlfriend joined me as soon as she got off work (I was sitting for about 45 minutes). They brought her some dishware and silverware and were so polite. They gave her a menu and we ordered chicken tikka masala and a side of basmati rice. My girlfriend is sensitive to spice so we asked if they could make the chicken tikka masala not spicy. Normally Indian restaurants won't make this accommodation, but it never hurts to ask. We were happily surprised when they said they could make it not spicy! When they brought the food out, it was so good! \n\nOverall, I was very impressed with the customer service, food, and atmosphere of this fine restaurant.

Yelp confirmed my confusion and so West Portal it was gonna be! lt turned out fortuitous anyway  as the evening was indeed memorable. \n\nWest Portal is a charming and quaint little shopping enclave with a plethora of unique stores and eateries. It used to be my stomping ground when I lived in this 'hood years ago. Parking might be a little challenging though not impossible. As we walked in, I noticed the subdued lighting with an open kitchen against the back wall and pleasing color schemes on the sidewalls. The ambiance was eye soothing with contemporary artwork adorning the walls and none of the boisterous conviviality of Bollywood that is often associated with other Indian restaurants. The furniture though was a little dated and I'm sure that would be an easy fix. \n\nI am usually a sucker for specials regardless of whether they're daily, weekly or monthly. Something unusual caught my eye. How would Spicy Tomato, Mango, Papaya Chaat ($8) grab you? It turned out to be a refreshing fruit salad using authentic Indian ingredients like grounded cumin, crushed black peppers, chopped mint leaves and fresh ginger and lime juice. The heirloom tomatoes were sweet, the fruits were just ripe giving a good crunch and boy, the whole platter was scrumptious as well! (4/5)\n\nContinuing on with the monthly special was a Tandoori Chicken Hen ($18). I have to admit I am not too sure what the technical difference is between a game hen and chicken but as a consumer, I do know from experience the former is usually smaller size-wise, the meat is tenderer and costs a little more. With this in mind, I've to say RIB's tandoori hen was the most mouth-watering tandoori bird I have ever bitten into! This is a classic Indian preparation in a tandoor (clay oven) that consisted of a hen roasted in mesquite charcoal after being marinated in Indian spices and yogurt. There was a fragrant blackened char on the edges; the meat was moist and fried chicken was no contest. (5/5)\n\nI have a soft spot for lamb chops that is now becoming a rarity in an Indian restaurant. So a Lamb Chop Masala ($22) was a no brainer although it didn't occur to me before ordering it was another tandoori dish. It did result in tandoori overkill. I assume masala refers to garam masala, an exotic blend of Indian spices that was rubbed into the lamb chops.  Again, like the tandoori hen, the charring on the ribs brought out the best of the tandoor. The only negative was the meat was a tad salty. Although I am not on a low sodium diet, I am still mindful of my sodium intake. (4/5)\n\nAs far as I am concerned, no Indian meal is quite complete without a curry dish. I opted for the quintessential Chicken Vindaloo ($15). It paled compared to the tandoori dishes as it lacked the fragrance and tastes from the mystifying concoction of spices and I didn't just mean the heat. Strangely, I enjoyed being kicked while savoring Indian curries! The gravy was watered down with no discernable oomph! It wasn't bad but definitely not the best. (3/5)\n\nThe owner was an unassuming soft-spoken man who periodically checked in with us in his low-keyed manner and without being disruptive or intrusive.  He surprised us by comping us the fruit salad as a token of his appreciation that we drove the distance to eat at his establishment. He had unwittingly gained our loyalty!", "author": "Geoff G."}

The curry, the texture of the breads, the soggy rice, even the sauces they give you for takeout quickly dissolve their flavor upon sprinkling. Way overpriced for the quality, whether you're dining in or out. I will say the meats are better-quality than most places I've eaten, i.e., they don't taste like a Punjabi McNugget.\n\nService is fairly quick dining in, but slow dining out (and for that quality, ugh).

The tandoori chicken came out on a hot plate, still sizzling, and the Jalfrezi was steaming hot. Everything was so delicious and super filling. The combo between veggie dish and the chicken dish was perfect. We had the right amount of meat and veggies.

From my perspective this translates into a beautiful and amazing \"DINING EXPERIENCE\" and that restaurant is Roti. \n\nOver the years my wife and I have been visiting Roti but never found the time to give this restaurant a review, but there comes a time when a simple \"Thank You\" to those who strive to make a positive difference in your day (and possibly in your life) must take precedence over personal and hectic schedules. So here I am. (Ironically, this is the first time I am writing a review on Yelp).\n\nThe \"Roti Experience\" does not start with its exotic and tasty Indian dishes, it actually begins from the moment one enters the restaurant - the warm and friendly greeting by the Host (blended with the melodious and soothing music in the background) sets the tone for your dining experience. Once seated, the picturesque landscape of Roti's interior immediately captures your attention and within a few minutes (while absorbing the beauty and serenity of the moment), you are gracefully intercepted with another hospitable greeting - this time, from your Waiter/Waitress.\n\nGlancing through the menu is another adventurous moment because the \"Cultural\" dimension of your experience gains momentum with the variety of authentic Indian dishes to choose from. My wife and I have been sampling the different dishes during our visits. However, each time we come to a conclusion as to the best dish on the menu, this thought is immediately erased from our memory when tasting another dish! In other words - everything tastes great!! Despite the extra time it takes to get to San Francisco from where we live in Belmont (due to the heavy traffic any day of the week) it is always a pleasure to visit Roti. The waiting is worth the while because a new and exciting experience always unfolds with each visit. \n\nThe  location, food, service, ambience, and other factors (tangible and intangible) that goes into making Roti uniquely special is the reason why my wife and I will always make this restaurant our first choice (among the many) in the Bay Area. We highly recommend Roti.

Our waitress was very cheery and did a good job checking on us.\n\nMurgh Makhani (butter chicken): pretty good. The chicken was soft and not overcooked, but it could have used a little more time in the curry to give it that extra flavor.\nBhindi Masala (sauteed okra): delicious variety of sweetness and spice with a hearty serving of okra.\nGarlic/basil naan: Although it's not as fluffy as traditional naan this packs a delicious flavor punch! The oiliness just adds more to the flavor!\n\nWe also had an order of Basmati rice which was fine. Portion size was great and I liked how everything was served together - each dish was fresh and hot.

Roti is a great Indian spot with great service-- including a super friendly and vigilant owner-- awesome menu, and super fresh food.  I didn't use to enjoy Indian food, but Roti perfectly spices their food and it isn't overcooked and oily like I used to find at other Indian spots.  I walk out of Roti feeling energized, rather than in a food coma, and I believe that's a reflection on the quality of their food.  \n\nThey have a great seasonal/monthly menu, too, with at least 5-6 unique dishes.  My boyfriend and I usually get one entree off the normal menu and one entree off the seasonal menu because we don't want to miss out on the seasonal (though the normal menu is fantastic).  One item from the seasonal menu that stuck out was a sea bass in a spiced basil cream sauce.  Heaven. \n\nLast great point: it's a hidden gem.  I can't believe we have this great of an Indian spot in our neighborhood.  Because it's hidden, it's usually easy for the two of us to get a seat when we walk in (I don't think we've ever had to wait for our table).  \n\nSo in summary- Roti is great and I highly recommend!", "author": "Chelsea P."}

My only experiences with Indian cuisine were at Naan N Curry, and I found that pretty gross. But I remembered my friend saying this place was good, so I was optimistic.\n\nMy sister wasn't too hungry so she ordered the appetizer sampler, while I opted for the Chicken Tikki Masala. When the appetizer sampler came out, I think the food runner forgot to the bring the sauce out with it. After a couple bites, our server offered us the sauces, but handled the situation in a rude way... Anyways, the chicken on my dish was pretty dry. I wasn't a fan of the rice that came with the dish. The grains of rice were super thin, it felt like I was eating nothing. The vegetable salad was good and tasted fresh. Disappointed with the rice, I ordered garlic naan to dip into the sauce of the masala. The garlic naan was pretty good, but when dipped into the sauce, it just tasted like I was eating a pizza.\n\nI think I would've given this place three stars, if it weren't for the flies and the service. During our whole meal, my sister and I kept shooing away flies from our food. They were small fruit flies, and there were a good amount of them. I didn't want to eat my dish anymore because I was scared one of the black peppers could've been a fly. Another table actually smacked one really loudly against the wall.\n\nThe server was just really rude from the beginning. After ordering, there was one more menu I forgot to hand her, and she stared at it and  was like, \"Um, do you need that?\" The menu was within arms reach of her, so I couldn't understand why I needed to hand it over myself. During the time I ordered naan, and after she put it in, she asked, \"You just wanted the plain naan , right?\" I asked what kind they had, ordered garlic naan, and she just rolled her eyes and looked annoyed cause she had to redo the order. I just don't understand why she didn't ask which one I wanted when I first ordered it... I'm a server myself, so I understand there can be bad days. But there is no reason to be rude to a customer.\n\nI would never come back here... The service can be forgiven since I am a server myself, but there were just so many flies.", "author": "Derek T."}

Being Indian himself he holds a standard no restaurant can compete with... Until now.\nYou can tell a GOOD Indian restaurant by how many Indians eats there. The place was a heady mix and the Indian families were sharing multiple dishes. Another sign was that the masala maintained flavor without tasting sour- something inexperienced Indian chef's seem unable to do. My hubby upped the heat on his Chicken Karahi (a special that day) while I indulged in my favorite- palak paneer. Not gonna lie- I am a palak paneer whore (saag paneer in some places) and I know a good one from a bad one. I scraped the plate clean, it was fantastic. We sided them with raita (decent) and papadum (good) and garlic naan (very good). We would highly recommend a feast or a thali for a sampling of their flavors.\n\nIronically This post was \"Started on 10/27/2012\" and somehow went unfinished- Yelp just told me as much.

Roti looked quite appetising, but with the good reviews and interesting looking menu, we thought it would be fully booked. \n\nWe thought we would check it out anyway and we arrived at about 19:30 to be warmly greeted and offered our choice of tables [from about 5]. Parking was free [after 18:00] and out outside the front window. \n\nThe place was already bustling and the atmosphere was welcoming. The first thing we noticed when we opened the door was the lovely smell, which is a great start. \n\nWe settled in and ordered some drinks [which were topped up throughout - we don't drink much alcohol, so diet coke and sprite were our choices] and then ordered the mixed appetisers [vegetable pakoras, vegetable samosas, popadom, mint raita, and some kind of sweet dipping sauce], mixed bread basket [three types of naan], Murgh Madras, plain rice, and Bhuna Gosht. \n\nThe appetisers came quickly, but not *too* quickly, and we were given plenty of time to enjoy them before the mains came out. A fresh, warm plate was given after the appetiser, in time for the main course. I'm not sure if the warm plates were intentional or if they were just warm out of the washer, but in any case, it was a nice touch. \n\nThe main courses were superb. We're from England and we like our curries spicy, however, these were so tasty [well balanced, delicious flavours] that this didn't matter. However, the owner [??] came and asked us if the meal was spicy enough for us [perhaps the waitress mentioned something to him?] and then brought us over a pot of homemade chilli sauce to add some spice to our meal. The chilli sauce was superb; fresh, very spicy, and plentiful. \n\nThe bread basket was also delicious - we could really taste the ghee, and the garlic naan was a highlight for us. \n\nAll the staff in the restaurant were really lovely, especially our waitress who chatted with us about her travels to England and made us feel very welcomed.

Lemonade is good too, but the saltiness can be off-putting for some. They offer to have you try it before you order it. Chai is okay. Pretty bland until you add their house sugar cubes which have more spices in them. \n\nRice was well made. Naan basket was awesome. I love variety! Recommend. \n\nTandoori game hen seemed promising because it was so popular that it became a regular item. I thought the spices were good but I got impatient with tearing the meat off of the bones. The salad ended up not really being eaten but it was pretty good too.\n\nChicken tikka masala was more flavorful than other chicken tikka masalas I've had. I like this best of all tikka masalas I've had but was not my favorite dish of the night.\n\nLamb curry was delicious. The cut of lamb that they had was soft and had good flavor.

Terrible service. \nThis place is incredibly loud, I came here for date night with my husband and we didn't even talk because it was so loud. The food was mediocre at best. I had the chicken tikka masala and it was ok, I'd give it a 6. We also ordered the goat curry and wow was it terrible. It felt like low quality fatty meat chunks. Now the service wasn't rude or anything, but we were never checked on. We both went without refills and never got to order extra naan or dessert because our waitress never came back. We asked some other person for the check so we can leave and get ice cream down the street. The whole process of trying to get someone's attention, paying, and getting our card back took 15 minutes. Meanwhile it seemed like our waitress was waiting on everyone but us and literally running around looking stressed out. Maybe they are understaffed? Still, not my problem, I'm trying to pay for good food and leave when I'm done. None of that happened.", "author": "Kaylah T."}

Well, better late than never! This is a very elegant restaurant that seems to \"dress up\" every dish with extra touches, ie; lovely bits of onions and herbs. We ordered a wide variety of food from their menu and each selection, whether it was lamb curry or a humble cucumber salad were garnished with these little extras.\nIn fact, we started with that Kuchumber salad which was filled with chunks of cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onions, and herbs in a light vinegar dressing. I find that this salad is usually a rudimentary starter at most Indian restaurants. But, Roti heightened their offering with what seemed to be a variety of fresh herbs.\nThe Bombay Calamari was very fresh and light, not greasy.\nOur mains included:\nLiterally the best Tandoori Chicken that we have ever had! Succulent, moist, and very intense BBQ flavor. The incidentals are usually just onions and lemon at most places,but here included several kinds of bell peppers and veggies. We discussed the possibility in the future of stopping here to pick up a couple of whole chickens to take home and build a meal around...\n\nSeafood Curry: This had the best creamy tomato sauce covering salmon, squid, and shrimp. Sublime\n\nLamb Boti Kebab with masala sauce. Quite a bit of meat slices in this!\n\nVery good saag (creamed spinach)\n \nAbsolutely the best Keema Naan: the bread was blistered, yet buttery with very thick layers of ground lamb. Bliss\n\nOnion kulcha and garlic and basil naan offered in their \"bread basket\" assortment.\n\nBasically, Roti Indian Bistro offers gourmet Indian food for very reasonable prices in West Portal.", "author": "Antoinette S."}

It was garbage and essentially chicken in a canned creamy tomato soup base.\n--Proceed with caution: the chicken korma and lamb biryani were standouts, but the meat was unfortunately cut (when you're eating family style, it's frusturating to get a plate with three huge chunks of meat in it). \n\nI did have a small peeve about having water here, which may be a bigger problem for people senstive to spices: our waitress would come around often and always ask us each individually if we wanted water, regardless of when our glasses were empty.

We always over-order so we can take food home with us. The service is friendly, personable and speedy.

Undoubtedly it doesn't have the hipster vibe of Dosa, but but please remember that's not what they're trying to do here! The one thing we liked is that the menu is focused on North Indian, unlike some places that try to have everything Indian and nothing right! Try the Tandoori Game Hen and then ask yourself if you've had something juicier and more flavourful somewhere else. Their lamb Biryani is good value and is perfect for sharing.

The two of us ordered three dishes, rice, and roti. The roti never made it to the table. The spinach and potato dish, the chicken breast dish, and the shrimp dish were good. The pulao rice was very dry (or day-old) and tasteless. Because the rice was so disappointing, I didn't enjoy the meal. I was very hungry and the food was edible, so you could say it was \"satisfying\"? I won't be back, and the main reasons are because of the rice, feeling rushed by the woman server, and the quality of their food. I wonder what the roti was like. I'll never know.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-28", "description": "I work in the South Bay and have frequented many of the notable Indian places south of the City, including many recommended by South Asian friends.  While I have my favorites in the Valley, none of them compares to Roti.  This might be my favorite Indian restaurant on earth.\n\nThe menu lists many dishes that you'll recognize from other places, but you will be astounded at the quality of the preparation here.  The spicing in particular is perfect:  the sauces taste like blends of various raw materials rather than something that came out of a bottle full blown like Athena from Zeus' bust.  \n\nWe tend to go with the same couple of friends, which means we can count on their ordering chicken makhani, saag aloo, bengan bharta, garlic naan, onion kulcha, and paratha with every meal.  Those dishes are sophisticated renditions of staples at most Indian places and they will make you appreciate just how upscale this cuisine is.  \n\nFor the remaining dishes at our repasts, we've sampled nearly everything else on the menu.  Particularly good here are the tandoori dishes, which always are redolent of smoke. If it's on the menu as a special, don't miss the incredible -- but maybe unauthentic -- tandoori duck; my only complaint is the portioning of that dish is uncharacteristically cheapskate, so you might need two orders to satisfy a party of four.  If there's no duck, try the tandoori cornish game hen -- again, who knows if this is authentic? -- and you won't go wrong.  Goanese vindaloos are good, too, with enough vinegar flavor to remind you that you aren't eating a garden variety curry dish. \n\nThere's a wine list, I gather, but, seriously, this is not food that goes well with wine. The better choices are Indian and artisan beers, lemonades, mango lassis, and ginger beers.\n\nService can be variable but it's never less than good.  The manager or perhaps owner, an older gentleman, is certain to stop by your table to confirm your happiness and gloat in your compliments about the food.  He's also very quick to offer complimentary servings of cooling raita, never a bad addition to an Indian meal.\n\nThe bill adds up quickly, but you really do get what you pay for here.  Well worth the modest premium over other Indian sit-down places.\n\nIf I have one complaint, it's the same one that I have about every other San Francisco restaurant these days: It's too freaking loud.  You'll hear everyone else's conversations as you carry on your own, including those of people who need to shout louder to stay above the din.  That said, this is not an unusually loud place for San Francisco, given what passes for ambience at nearly every sit-down place in town.  At least there's no blaring music adding to the bombardment.  \n\nAs other reviewers have noted, you need to allocate some time to finding parking in West Portal.  We live there, so we walk, but we feel your pain.", "author": "Mike R."}

I mean sure, that's a bit pricey for Indian food. So if you're solely craving Indian food for the heck of it, I would suggest a cheaper alternative such as those on Irving St (Naan and Curry/ Noori).

Plus, I remembered we were holding a livingsocial deal for $50 for this place.  So reservations made on yelp through the phone and 20 minutes later, we were in the door. \n\nThe only thing that beats a great meal is great service and this is the place for the best of both worlds.  The restaurant is very welcoming, and the fragrance of herbs and spices permeate through the restaurant.  The staff is very attentive, even if they are not assigned to your seating area, you're asked how you are, if the food is to your liking, etc.  Even the manager and owner came by several times to ensure the meal was satisfactory.  And it was.  They went above and beyond to everyone I noticed in the restaurant, a far and distant trade among the service industry lately.\n\nWe started out with the Goat cheese naan with regular naan on another plate.  Fantastic.  This is a must try for anyone.\n\nNext was the saffron rice, which is long grain, simple and subtle but overall good.  The proteins were stewed with love and came out fall off the bone delicious.  The lamb was to die for, the classic chicken tikka masala was delightful, the spinach and prawns were a nice addition as recommended by our waiter, and best of all, the lentils and vegetables dish was absolutely the best dish in that place!\n\nAgain, good food becomes great with great service.  The manager took no time in jumping in when we were all deciding whether or not to have dessert.  He simply said, I'll take care of it and off he was with our menus.  In a couple minutes, our table was sharing mango lassi's which were creamy, smooth and a great compliment to the end of the meal.  He also brought out a plate of the galub jamun made of sweetened dumplings and milk and a sauce that was killer.  \n\nSo the livingsocial obviously helped but with two rounds of drinks, meal for 5, and two desserts, it was barely over $100.  I would've expected it to be double that.  No complaints here!  Great for meat lovers, great for vegetarians, and great atmosphere and service makes this a go to place for the crew when we need a good time out before or after the movies in W. Portal.

When you get a craving for Indian food, it's 1) Contagious and 2) Irreplaceable so there we were piling into the car driving across town to West Portal, one of the few village like enclaves in San Francisco. Entering Roti with three kids in tow including twin two year old boys, I could barely lift my head to look the ma\u00eetre d in the eyes as we followed him to our table in the middle of the restaurant.  \"Cool\", shouted Cate jumping onto the banquet full of throw pillows followed by her brothers climbing on up as she rearranged pillows and scooted on down to the other side of the table facing me.

I got a warm nod from an elderly couple and saw that there was another little girl seated quietly with an iPad. I don't know how my nerves would make it through the day without the iPads at home but I'm not bringing them to restaurants or caf\u00e9s. It's one of the few rules that haven't fallen to the wayside like eating on the couch and jumping off the coffee table.\nBefore I'm even settled in my seat, our charismatic server brought out three mango lassies in tiny fancy glasses with colorful straws. The kids eyes widened with enjoyment as they slurped down their treat. I took this opportunity to say hello to my husband while gathering all the knives from kids arm length. We were then offered papadam which ended up being a bit too spicy for Cate and Shane but Declan crunched away. Encouraged by his gusto I introduced him to the fresh plum sauce thinking dipping would entice him to try it, I was wrong so I distributed crayons and paper and picked up the menu. We ordered the tandoori mixed grill platter that sizzled and steamed onto the table capturing everyone's attention. I could not get any eye contact while I chanted over and over \"no touching.\" Chicken, beef, lamb, prawns, and salmon sat piping hot in front of a captive audience. Dave and I had watched the skewers turning our meat in the open kitchen and the tenderness of each piece did not disappoint. I divvied up the pieces for the kids but their plates were still left untouched when the lentils, chicken masala, and prawn vindaloo arrived. I thought I'd spare the restaurant of having to sweep up afterwards so instead of ordering a rice dish we went with two orders of regular naan along with a keema naan. Needless to say we ordered way too much food but what's better than going out to Indian? Eating the leftovers the next day.", "author": "Danielle W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-30", "description": "I might just enjoy the holes in the walls, but this place wasn't too impressive for me. It was too clean cut for an Indian place. I came here on a weeknight for dinner, via the living social deal with a friend. For $50 bucks, you can basically feed 3 people (barely). With two people we had a little left over, but wasn't much.\n\nWhat we had:\nCalamari Appetizers - Not too bad, but not really that great. It was cut into rings and large tentacles, and the tentacles were the better ones. The rings were cut a little too big, so it was a lot more chewy than crispy. It came with two sauces, which I assume makes it \"bombay style\" but it was very hard to understand what the sauces were. One was a dark sauce that was not quite balsamic, not quite wine reduction. It was slightly tangy. The other was a green sauce that was like a cucumber herb aioli. \n\nSpicy Garlic Asparagus (seasonal): This was on the monthly special thing. It said spicy asparagus, and we were excited to get some spicy garlicy asparagus. Was a little disappointed. The asparagus was cooked well, but it wasn't garlicy enough or spicy enough. It really tasted more like grilled asparagus.\n\nChicken Vindaloo: total disappointment. The menu said it was in a hot and spicy sauce, which my friend and I were both excited about. But...what came out was pretty bland and not spicy at all. The taste wasn't authentic. FYI, they use thigh meat with this. Just in case you care.\n\nChicken Tikka Masala: This was better than the Chicken Vindaloo, but still not quite authentic. It was good though, and made with chicken breast meat. I might come back for this.\n\nBasil & Garlic Naan: this was pretty good! The basil made the scent amazing and we'd never had basil and garlic on naan before.\n\nI think Roti has catered a little too much to the interests in the area. There's about 6 Italian restaurants in the neighborhood, and a lot of the food they offered had a bit of Italian touches to it. IE, Calamari, Basil in Naan, etc. It made the food less than authentic. They also seem to pull back on the flavors. I love Indian food because its full of flavor, but Roti's food was really bland in comparison to other Indian places I've been to. This deducted a star from them.\n\nService-wise, I was a little disappointed. We walked in and was seated immediately, but it took FOREVER for a waiter to come by to help us. I was craning my neck around like an OWL and they didn't notice! I finally waived someone down and we got our orders in. After the food was in, they were much better at getting our waters refilled and the owner (I assume) came by to ask if our meal was good. I take off half a star for the poor initial service.\n\nFinal review: 1 star off for inauthentic food, 1/2 star off for poor initial service, and another 1/2 star off for high prices without the good food to back it up. I don't mind paying more for good food, but don't price your food to something that's more than it is!", "author": "Lily W."}

I personally don't like spicy so I had to ask what is not spicy on the menu. I was told that there are only two items on the menu that is less spicy (nothing was not spicy at all). So we ordered the only two that was less spicy, chicken tikka tandoori ($15) and chicken tikka masala ($16).\n\nThe food took a while to come out so they gave us some papadum to hold us over. It was a nice gesture. \n\nThe flavors of the tikka masala is one of the best I've had but it was also one of the spiciest I've had. If this was one of the least spiciest dishes on the menu, I cannot imagine how hot the other dishes are. It's also more expensive than what I'm used to paying for tikka masala (around $8). And no, they cannot make their dishes less spicy since the spice is already mixed into the meats/sauces.\n\nThe chicken tikka tandoori was better in terms of heat but the chicken was dry. Our server was great, he brought us some yogurt sauce for the chicken which made it less dry and added flavor.\n\nThe chai ($3) was good and bottomless and they are great about refills. Again, other places offer chai either for free or for only a buck and yes they are also bottomless.\n\nDifferent servers checked on us through out our meal, we were never left feeling abandoned.\n\nAlthough I don't think I will find this level of service at any other Indian restaurant, I don't think I will be coming back.

I had a craving for Indian and I remembered seeing this place whilst eating across the street at El Toreador one day and made the decision to get my family to come here for an after-church lunch (:\n\nMy parents both ordered the Naanini and honestly, I don't like the metallic-like, earthy lamb flavor, but the lamb was delicious. Moist, soft, and of course spice enriched, it was super yummy. My brother got some kind of chicken curry and it was good but nothing I'd craze over. I ordered the vegetarian thali and I definitely recommend that! It doesn't seem like much since everything comes in small-looking bowls, but I assure you, I left with a food baby. I don't even know what I ate, but I know that I loved everything, especially two of the bowls. The cucumber salads that came with all our dishes were all really good too! I think anyone who likes honey mustard will like it. And of course, the naan. Oh naan. Soft, bready naan. The naan here was great. It was great alone, but duh you had to dip it in everything which accentuated all the flavors even more. We also got a garlic basil naan and that was like garlic bread on naan on crack!! \n\nI really recommend coming here for a good Indian fix. All the spices and flavors that I got from them were intoxicating. I was full but couldn't help myself from constantly dipping back into the food. I loved everything, and again, the vegetarian thali was amazing. It lets you try a variety of things and for sure, you'll be filled with eating all the naan along with it. It also comes with a milky chai that's super warming! Love the ambiance and the nice waitress we had. Definitely coming back (:", "author": "Holly P."}

Papadum (lentil wafer), vegetable pakoras (mixed veggies fried in a chick pea batter--crisp & flavorful), & veggie samosa (filled w/ potatoes, peas, curry spice--I enjoyed it considering I don't love curry.)\n\nOther dishes included lamb chops (which I did not try) & a salmon dish (which was a tad fishy tasting. Also, sauce was not appetizing to a few of us at the table.)\n\nThe one thing I thoroughly enjoyed was running huge pieces of garlic & basil naan through the sauce in our murgh makhani dish (tandoori chicken cooked in tomatoes, butter, & cream--that *cant* be bad!) I opted for white meat chicken, which was firm & slightly dried out. \n\nLunch is served with chai tea, which was mildly spiced & flavored... just like everything else on the menu. Believe me, I'm not saying I want to be hit with super strong Indian spices (I actually enjoy 'fusion' cooking), but it seems Roti is walking on eggshells in the kitchen, so as not to offend patrons with robust flavors.

That has nothing to do with this review except I just had some great Indian food. OK, maybe that's still a stretch...\n\nEven though West Portal sounds like a gateway to heaven or at least the entrance to a really pricey Greek-style spa, it's actually one of those neighborhoods in which I rarely venture. I'm a downtown type of guy that refers to anything in this area as \"somewhere over Twin Peaks\". Shame on me for having such a limited vantage point since there are a lot of cool eateries around here of which this is one of the best.\n\nFive of us commandeered a table in this low-key Indian restaurant (...not to be mistaken for Rotee, the also stellar and slightly more casual place in the Haight). It was abuzz with activity that night, but the decor was soothing to this savage beast. Mustard walls. Silk fabrics framed on the walls. Soft lighting. Just the right vibe for the type of dinner that five friends, who hadn't seen each other in a while, wanted to have. On our appetite meter, we were definitely more than peckish moving toward full-blown famished.\n\nSo to cut to the chase, we went for two orders of the $33-per-person Roti's Feast, which you may see as our lazy way to get around the menu. Yes, t'is true...but that's because everything looked so good. We received assorted samosas and pakoras which we promptly subdivided, a mixed tandoori plate, murgh masala, dal, pulao, kachumber, raita, naan, kheer and chai. If you recognize more than three names on that list, you have a more sophsticated palate than mine.\n\nI actually don't recall the chai, but I was so wrapped up in the dinner conversation that I may have overlooked it in favor of the wine. We also went for the dessert-like $16 Lamb Korma, which was bathing in a spicy cream sauce and topped with almonds & cashew nuts. Very tasty. We also shared the $10 Aloo Gobi, which had cauliflower and potato chunks cooked with onions, turmeric, and fresh herbs. The $4 Onion Kulcha was excellent as it was naan stuffed with herbs, spices and onions The dishes were becoming a blur of furious flavors at this point in the evening.\n\nNo matter as I plan to return to the wilds of West Portal even if it means going outside my geographic comfort zone. Even with all the Indian options in my part of town, including Rotee and Indian Oven, the food is just that good here. So prepare the horses and the wagons and if you are not of such pioneer stock, you are still allowed to take a Muni train.

We arrived at 6:30 and the restaurant had a few people sitting down to dinner but got much more crowded within the hour.  The service was good - the waiters always seemed to appear just at the right time. We started off with some appetizers - samosas, chicken pakoras, and goat cheese naan - all pretty good\n\nFor my entree I ordered the curried mixed vegetables which was somewhat disappointing .  It's advertised as being \"seasonal mixed vegetables\" but it only consisted of carrots, peas, and cauliflower. The curry sauce was more tomato flavored than curry and wasn't very spicy.  Others had curried lamb, biryani,  curried seafoods which they enjoyed but was covered with the same bland sauce.\n\nThere is much better Indian food available in San Francisco so it's doubtful I'll be coming back to Roti", "author": "Bumble B."}

I'm not talking about just the sauce but the actual cheese.  I know it's a special type of cheese but it was bland.  \n\nLamb korma--now, it was our first time trying this sauce, and it was a delicious--slightly sweet, a bit of salt, and a kick to it.  Oh and creamy.  It was good.  Now, the lamb was not as gamey as expected though...\n\nMy sister heard about the goat cheese naan, so we tried that... it was good!  \n\nBottomline: Food = okay.  Try the korma and goatcheese naan but have low expectations for everything else.\n\nService = friendly.\n\nDecor/ambience = dimly lit, simple tables and chairs/booths.  \n\nLike everyone else has said (over and over): Prices are moderate to high, especially when you compare it to the lack of savoriness of food.

Also, I eat a lot of Indian food and unfortunately a lot of the Indian in the Bay Area is mediocre (although some is very good).\n\nLet me just say straight up that I was totally wrong. This place was EXCELLENT.  We had two items from the July specials, a spiced raw mango and tomato dish (simple but excellent and I'd never this dish before) and a chicken dish that was just outstanding; the chicken was nicely spiced and on a bed of lightly grilled vegetables. We then had two of my standards, Bengan Bharta (eggplant) and Bhindi Masala (okra). They were both very good; I think the Bhindi was one of the best I have had.\n\nWhen I ordered, I asked for it to be spicy, and I think this was key. I noticed that some of the other reviews stated the food was bland; ours was perfectly spiced. Bottom line; ask for spicy and it comes out very nicely spiced.\n\nIt's a little on the pricey side for SF Indian ($65 for two beers, an appetizer, and three dishes (OK, not really that expensive now that I think about it)) but the ambiance is very nice and the service was good.\n\nAll in all, a surprisingly nice meal!\n\nGP", "author": "G.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-08-23", "description": "Having just moved to West Portal, I've been slowly trying all the restaurants in this foggy neighborhood. I recently tried Indian food at Roti and am sorry to report that the food was rather underwhelming. To sum it up briefly, the portions were small, food mediocre, and prices high. \n\nI ordered the murgh makhani (butter chicken), garlic & basil naan, and a half portion of rice for $25 and felt a bit cheated at the end of the meal: I paid a lot of money for something I didn't particularly enjoy.\n\nFirst let me review my order of butter chicken. For some reason, the curry here is light in consistency--almost watery. It translates into a lighter taste that unfortunately detracts from the flavor and spice of the curry. The dish was still pleasant enough to eat, but in all honesty, it was a little too bland, especially for curry. It just didn't pack the punch I was looking for. \n\nSecond, the rice. I think this was the worst part of the meal. My rice was mushy and not very good. I'm guessing I got a bad batch because this stuff was horrible and made the whole meal hard to enjoy.\n\nThird, the naan. Fortunately, the naan was good and I was able to finish the curry eating the naan and forgoing the rice. It was charred nicely and had a nice fluffy, buttery taste. A must-order if you eat here, and in general when you order indian food IMO.\n\nI will note that the wait staff and owner were very nice and additionally the overall decor of the restaurant is excellent. I don't think these things are enough to warrant another visit however. I preferred the indian food down the street at clay oven. Although it's not quite as fancy as Roti, the curry and rice taste better there and the prices are more reasonable.", "author": "Daniel L."}

Every single dish was very well made with high quality ingredients. The Achari Gosht was so delicate and moist that I couldn't believe it was lamb! But the game hen, that dish stole the show. OH MY GOODNESS it was flavored so perfectly, a little on the salty side, but that didn't matter because the chicken was so juicy and tender and pretty much amazing. It comes on a plate of arugula with some pistachios sprinkled on top. The vegetarian dishes we had were also delicious. The naan was awesome!\n\nOverall, great experience!

I jumped to the chance because if I can get expensive food for cheaper, I'm there!  \n\nI've always liked the West Portal area.  The restaurants are small and quiet. 9 times out of ten, they're probably really good (in other words; fancy). \n\nWe were seated right away at one of the window tables.  The window bench seats have cushion seating and pillows for added comfort.   The lighting was dim but everything was still pretty visible.  The server was very knowledgable and have good recommendations. I ordered the chicken tikka and my date ordered the lamb vindaloo with garlic basil naan.  \n\nLemme tell you something.   Their menu is more expensive for a reason...the portions are huge.  I could only eat half of my chicken tikka and my date ate 3/4 of his dish. The meat was moist and flavorful. Those are two things that can be missing in Indian cuisine. The naan was the kicker. I think it was the basil that put it over the top or maybe it was because it was more moist than other naans.  Whatever it was, I'm hooked.   \n\nEven though the prices are more expensive than other Indian restaurants, I think the food here is worth it to come back.

The plain naan at $4 a pop, and other filled breads at $6-8 each seems like a steep price considering many places in the city give you that for a buck or two. I would prefer smaller but cheaper portions of the bread, or a sampler of breads at a more affordable price. Or how about a naan freebie? It's basically your bread basket.\n\nNone of the entrees comes with rice, meaning you also have to order a plate of rice at $5-10 a plate, so all these sides and it starts to add up quite a bit.\nThe service was fine, in fact they seem to have one too many waiters and somebody is always hovering about you.

Turned out the reservation was unnecessary. At 1pm on a weekday the place was completely empty. Obviously it's been this way for awhile, because they only had one waitress working. This left us a little concerned about what we'd gotten into, but the waitress worked her butt off and was fantastic. Our chai mugs were always full, and our food was brought out quickly.\n\nMy boyfriend was sad that the lunch menu didn't offer more curry options, but ended up ordering the Naanini (which many of us got as well). One pleasant surprise was how large the portions were, and for an average of $10! However, we expected the Naanini  to be served with the mint chutney sauce on the side, but the sauce was actually baked into the lamb, which made the dish very dry. Combine this with the naan and you have a huge portion that is basically impossible to finish. \n\nI did look at the dinner menu and it seemed very expensive, so many the portions are even larger and worth splitting? Overall I thought the food was alright and the service was good, but it still sort of spooked me that it was so empty!", "author": "Rachel A."}

After walking through West Portal we decided to choose Roti in the midst of other delicious looking establishments within the vicinity.  I was raised in West Portal but live in Seattle now, yet I have never tried the \"new\" and what geriatric WP residents would call \"hip\" restaurants in the area. I expected a westernized bland approach to indian food, and while yes, it was a bit mild, by no means was it flavorless. \n\nWe were promptly seated and while the waitress seemed to be phasing out and we had no idea who our server was,  the transition was fluid and service was not compromised. We ordered the grilled lamb with mixed bell peppers and red onion, the cauliflower potato curry special, naan and basmati rice.  Complimentary chip crisps the size of tortillas with dipping sauces prior to our meal.  When we asked for extra yogurt sauce, the young male server came out with a much bigger bowl. Yes! Extra sauce in a bowl bigger than a ramekin! The bussers were efficient and quick, and the owner seemed to be in house.  \n\nAll in all, I was pleased with the service, and pleasantly full.  This is not the hip hole in the wall I typically frequent, but it was merely some old fashioned family owned restaurant trying to please the white mans taste buds...

Roti was not crowded for lunch. Place is very nicely decorated and seemed very clean and well mannered. We ordered the mixed tandoori plate, a lamb curry, an eggplant curry, mixed bread plate (with Roti and Naan), saffron rice, mango chutney, and a cucumber yogurt. We also grabbed some Indian lemonade. \n\nThe Tandoori plate was cooked well, good but not great flavor. The lamb curry was very spicy but had nice flavor. The eggplant curry was everyone's favorite- tender but not mushy. Nice mouth feel and spice. My favorites were the basics; I thought the rice was very good and the Naan was excellent. I also really loved the Indian lemonade- think lemonade with some mint and herbs. \n\nHowever I need to deduct a half star for each point below:\n1) curries were too spicy for some of our party. Server never asked or consulted us on our spicy comfort level. Place was not crowded so I think there should have been better dialogue.\n2) Prices are high, portions are small. Considering your basic entree is between $14-$20 and you have to order rice and accompaniments \nextra, the bill adds up. \n3) Tagging onto the above, we noticed that another customer ordered a plate that seemed to have an entree, rice and naan on it. We asked what it was and was told by the waiter that it was a combo special from their lunch specials menu, which he said he didn't give us since he figured we would order entrees together 'family style'. This really didn't sit well with me - I thought it was totally unprofessional - next time let the customer decide, not you!\n\nSo Roti on food alone would have earned 4 stars, but instead only 2.5 stars for overall performance.", "author": "Dom L."}

I thought the ones I've had at Dosa Fillmore were smaller, but a lot more flavorful.\n\nWhat really did it for me was the Lamb Korma.  As I've grown older, I've become allergic to cashews so I had it with sliced almonds instead, but wow, the cream-based curry was wonderful.

That's right, this is not the all-you-can-eat kind of Indian joint.  Ambience is modern yet cozy, kind of like the way I would decorate my house if I actually owned it.  Interestingly, that makes you feel more like you're in a posh suburb than West \"50's time-warp\" Portal.  But then, at its heart, West Portal pretty much is a posh suburb.\n\nAnyhow, we got several dishes to share, but the real standouts were the Vegetarian Korma and the bread basket...slap a dollop of on onto a slice of the other, and it melts in your mouth.  Agreed, this is not particularly authentic tasting (not very spicy for one), but it strikes a beautiful balance between elegant bistro fare and comfort food.  Plus, they gave us complimentary port for dessert (I notice they're really trying to push the wine & dessert selection here).\n\nNow if only these dishes came with single-digit prices, this would be 5 stars all the way.", "author": "Wes M."}

The kicker is that while we were the first people there, we were the last out of six other tables, which were seated after us, to receive our food.

I'm not a die hard on Indian food but was feeling the craving for a few basic Indian classics.  Came on a Sunday night around 5:30 and the place started jumping from 6pm on.  The service looked a little stretched as they didn''t seem to have a designated host.  I guess my puzzled look was enough for one of the waiters to notice us and he quickly seated us and apologized.  The place gets cold but they had little space heaters above the booths to combat the draft...creative, yet ghetto.\n\nThe food is decent and they kept the water filled, which is necessary if you can't take the heat.  I learned to ask how spicy their dishes were at baseline before they added more spice.  The naan and tandoori roti were as good as I expected and we enjoyed flavorful & cripsy chicken pakoras as appetizers.  The eggplant curry was definitely on the bland side and overspiced, but the chicken tikka masala, gosht madras (lamb), and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower) were all excellent dishes and worth trying.

We had about a 30 minute wait and we were sitting outside waiting to be called.  I spotted Roti and knew I had wanted to try it for a long time.  I ran across the street to ask about a table.  It was a busy Saturday night on West Portal.  The hostess said it would be about 20 minutes.  She took my cell number and said she would call me when a table opened up.  I went back outside and just as I crossed the street she had come running over to tell us the table was ready!  \n\nWe ended up having the best meal.  I had the Lamb Biryani.  It was flavorful, tender and some yummy!  Indian comfort food.  My sister had prawns that she loved, they were spicy and succulent.  We shared a huge order of the Basil and Garlic naan.  Everything was perfect.  They even had 21st Amendment beer on the menu.  A dream come true!  \n\nIt was my niece's B-day and the owner brought 2 scoops of Mitchell's ice cream over with a candle in it for her.

Every time we get back in touch with each other and we want to eat out, it's usually here. She really loves this jackfruit rice dish that they serve. I have to admit that it's pretty good. Personally, I love the naan that they make here. Then again, I'm a naan fiend. The chicken tikka masala is also very good.\n\nI'd normally give this a four-star rating... maybe even a five... but I have one major problem with this place, and for me it's a common trend with places like these... it's just too expensive for what they serve. Now, I prefer quality over quantity for sure, but I'm not a big fan of places that overcharge their food just because they look all fancy on the inside. I feel that this place is more catered towed the upper-middle class that get suckered into a place like this because it looks fancy and the food is pretty decent and because they charge so much, it must be good, right?\n\nI just don't buy into fancy facades... most of the time.\n\nYou can get a better deal on 9th and Irving, or other places in the City. Sure, you might be entering a hole-in-the-wall or a place that doesn't look so fancy, but you just get better deals, for food that's just as good, if not maybe a small step below in quality.\n\nIf I went on a first date, hypothetically, and she was into the whole hoity-toity restaurant scene where they overprice their food because their place looks all sleek and hip, I'd take her here... well, if she wanted to eat Indian, that is.

Looked like a nice upscale bistro.\n\nMenu: Seems like a fairly standard Indian menu, with a bit of upscale nature to it.\n\nThe food: We ordered the following dishes:\n\nBengan Bharta: Good flavor, with a small kick.  Not as smoky as I would have liked, but still damn tasty.\n\nBhindi Masala: We've really become fans of okra in Indian dishes.  This was an excellent sauteed and spiced okra dish.\n\nDal Saag: First time I've ever had saag with dal.  (We'll typically order lamb saag or saag paneer.)  It was an okay dish, but if I hadn't known the name of it I wouldn't have known it was a saag.  I'd much prefer ordering one of our staple saag dishes, and get the lentils on their own plate.\n\nMacchi (Fish) Korma:  This was really good.  Perfectly cooked pieces of sea bass in a wonderful yellow cream sauce.  It could have used a few more pieces of fish, though, as this quickly became just a bowl of sauce.\n\nMurgh Makhani: Not typically my favorite chicken dish, but the meat was very tender and the flavor was excellent.\n\nRoti's bread basket: Tandoori Roti, Onion Kulcha, and Garlic & Basil Naan were all good, although a bit on the chewy side, but I don't think I could have always told you which was which.  Both of those complaints might have to do with it being takeout.  You just can't compete with breads right out of the kitchen.\n\nParatha: I wasn't all that impressed with the Paratha.  It was chewy like the others, yet at the same time it was falling apart in my wife's hands as she tried to break it into pieces for dipping.  I thought she'd have been better off putting it on her place like spaghetti and covering it with curry.\n\nService: The host quickly retrieved my takeout order and sent me on my merry, hungry way.\n\nValue: It's on the expensive side for Indian food (similar to Amber India, in Mountain View.)  I did appreciate that this place charged $5-6 less for their vegetarian entrees than their meat dishes.  \n\nWill I go back?

These were pretty good, but pretty standard.\n\nWe also ordered the chicken tikka masala ($16) - which was pretty good. Lots of flavor, and lots of chunks of boneless chicken breast. We also ordered the spinach with potatoes ($9) which was okay - not a lot of flavor to it. The lamb briyani ($17) was good but very spicy and so I did not eat alot of this. We also got 1 roti and 1 naan ($4 each) and while it was hot and fresh, I'm used to fluffy naan - and this was kinda flat and lacked substance. Also I thought both breads were pretty oily. The mango lassi ($5) was very yummy and a big glass of it too!\n\nWhile the food was decent, the prices are on the high side for Indian food. The service here was excellent, very attentive. They also have a nice wine list. I like how its an open kitchen, and the restaurant as a whole is very clean. Even the bathrooms were clean! Overall, a little pricey for Indian food, but the ambiance and service were great.", "author": "Betty S."}

I assumed that they were the same as the Roti in Burlingame, so I set my hopes high! For one, they share the same name, but the owners are different. I must say, the owner comes across as a sweet gentleman and the service is good.\n\nNaturally, the food tastes different. I ordered the Baingan Bharta (smoked, creamed eggplant with spices) with roti, and my husband ordered a chicken dish with rice. The sauce around the chicken was alright, not much taste going there! The eggplant didn't have that smokey taste at all! :(  And that's the key taste!! How could they!?!? \n\nWhile we enjoyed our dinner without any untoward incident, the couple whose table was next to ours had it!

The menu is extensive and I highly recommend that you go with someone who knows the cuisine, as usually I do not choose wisely.\n\nA couple of reviewers mentioned that the tandoori duck was somewhat of a miss. I have to say, I wasn't that thrilled with it but I must preface and tell you in advance that I am not usually a fan of duck.

So the perfect night arrived - a mellow Friday evening with no plans and no food in the house.  So, my husband and I decided to try Roti.  And what's more, we could ride the Muni there (it's a block from the West Portal station).\n\nHere's the breakdown:  The food is good if you want western-style Indian food.  I personally like western-style Indian food because the meat is typically of higher quality than traditional Indian restaurants.  We ordered tandoori lamb, chicken korma, okra, rice and goat cheese naan.\n\nSo I liked the food, but the prices are so incredibly high.  I do not mind paying for high quality, but in this instance I would have rather paid much much less for traditional Indian food.  Our bill was just under $100 (for two people with one glass of wine each).  \n\nA few other things:  \n- we had to wait about 45 minutes for our food to arrive \n- one of the waiters spilled our mango chutney all over my shoe upon serving it\n- the atmosphere is lacking a \"homey\" feel and it was too loud to talk to my date, so we just sat and smiled at each other\n- the chicken korma for $22 had about five pieces of one inch square cubes of meat and tons of sauce\n\nI would not go back.  When I want Indian, I am sticking to the \"real\" Indian spots at cheap prices.  But to finish off on a positive note, the food was definitely good (although my hubby and I have slightly different tastes for some cuisines, and he did not like the food here).  I have to go with 2 stars due to the prices alone.", "author": "Kelly A."}

It's located at the edge of West Portal with a movie theater on its left and the MUNI tunnel to its right (forgot what that tunnel is called haha).  Parking here is cut-throat so if you've made reservations I'd suggest coming here a little bit earlier.\n\nWe walked in at 630PM without reservations and was seated within seconds by a waitress who looked no more than 16 years old (a foreshadow of the service to come).  We get seated near the back register at the edge of the kitchen.  That night it was Thanksgiving Eve so it was pretty lively in there with a bunch of white folks trying to be \"worldly\" before the year ended.  \n\nWe ordered the Indian Lemonade but was told they were out of lemons so we had to settle for Limeade....boo for them since it tasted like a Mojito without alcohol.  For appetizers we ordered the Vegetable Samosas (spelling?).  It was this huge fried ball filled with curry, potatoes, green peas and a whole bunch of other veggies.  For the main course we had Kashmiri Biryani, Lamb \"Popsicles\" and Keenan Naan (spelling?).  I loved the exotic taste of the Kashmiri Biryani!  It had 2-3 different types of rice (not your typical Asian white rice), curry, green peas, pineapples and dried raisins.  The Lamb \"Popsicles\" came out on a sizzling platter and literally made it go \"pop\" - I can see where that came from now.  The lamb chops were very juicy and tender but a little too spicy for me.  As for the Keenan Naan?  Well...it wasn't too memorable since I've already forgotten it.\n\nService here could use some work since it consists mainly of high schoolers trying to make enough money to go out on the weekends.  They appear to be understaffed because although there were three cooks sweating their balls off in the open kitchen, the 5 waiters were either hanging out at the register talking about how much tips they DIDN'T get (we were sitting right in front of them) or gossiping in the kitchen hallway about a fellow employee (I passed them on my way out of the restroom).\n\nIn the end I'd suggest looking for another restaurant if you really want authentic Indian food because last I checked, Indian food didn't require two forks, a knife and a spoon.  Would I come here again?  Sure but not for awhile.\n\n==========\n\n-1 Star for service\n-1 Star for mediocre food\n\n*3 Stars out of 5*", "author": "Chris Y."}

Since my wife cannot take heavy spices, I ordered food that was mild and the owner was attentive enough to offer me a spicy sauce on the side since I can take the heat.  We started our meal with the sliced eggplants as well as calamari, both of which we all thought was fresh and nicely fried.  The accompanying sauces were excellent.  We also had roasted head of cauliflower that was spiced to perfection.  My mouth  still waters thinking of it.\n\nTandoori Prawn and Tandoori lamb followed.  Prawns tends to be a favorite amongst my family, and having eaten it at so many other restaurants, we could tell right away that they were cooked to perfection.  You can also sense that the restaurant uses really fresh ingredients.  I'm never a fan of lamb because of its unique taste, but my wife loves it.  As a compromise for eating spicy foods, we ordered the lamb popsicles.  My wife and daughter enjoyed it so much that they even convinced me to try a bite.  Even for someone who avoids eating lamb on all occasions, I have to admit that they were tender and the flavor well-balanced.  The fact that I enjoyed the lamb so much shocked my family.  We also ordered Makhani chicken and the sauce was delicious.  It was so addicting that we kept pouring it over the saffron rice and dipping the naan bread in it.  The manager was kind enough to stop by and ask how our meal was, offering my wife some cucumber yogurt to ease her tongue from what minimal spice we requested.  We also ordered the ginger beer and the mango lassi, a sweet yogurt-based drink that can help with the spice, both of which accompanied the dinner well.  We ended our meal with Kulfi, an Indian ice cream that we had never tried before.  We highly recommend it as it is not as rich and sweet as regular ice cream.  The spices gave it an interesting flavor and the topped pistachio added a nice crunchy texture.\n\nService was excellent as the waiters were very attentive and friendly.  It is a restaurant that we have not frequented for some time, but we will definitely return with friends.  I high recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Tai C."}

I have been consistently disappointed with Roti, but went back on multiple occasions to give it another shot.  The food is phenomenal, but the service is horrible.  It's because of the food that I gave them 2 yelps instead of one.    \n\nI don't really blame the waiters, who are all young and bubbly.  Those oldest one couldn't have been older than 20.  The thing is they are seriously understaffed in the kitchen.  It wasn't a busy night last night, and there was one cook in the kitchen.  20 minutes after placing our order, I saw the entire wait staff waiting around for food to come from the kitchen.  They have an open kitchen so you can see what's going on.  These guys were ready and willing to work (they were literally jumping around), but there wasn't food to put out.   \n\nLast night, my girlfriend and I went here for the fourth, and likely the final time.  We were seated right away, and ordered, but waited 30 minutes for our food.  At the end of the meal, I had to ask myself if the food was worth the wait.  The meat is super high quality and the portions are good sized, and the wait staff is super friendly, but at the end of the day, it just wasn't enough. . \n\nEveryone knows you can get good quality Indian food in San Francisco fairly cheap.

And the tamarind sauce is definitely the best tamarind sauce I've ever had. I usually just taste the tamarind sauce, and then dress up the samosas with the mint chutney the restaurants typically provide.  This time, I became instantly enamored of the sweet, sour, delectibilty of Roti Bistro's tamarind sauce and couldn't get enough of it. \n\nWhenever I try a new Indian restaurant, I always first take a bite of the rice to see how it stands alone.

I loved eating spicy mangoes and pineapples alongside more traditional veggies like broccoli, onions, red peppers, etc... \n\nAnd the Navrataan Koorma was out of this world, and a perfect pair for the more spicy daily special.  Subtle, creamy, complex and completely sublime, this dish also included sweet fruits (pineapple and raisins) alongside paneer, peas, and other traditional veggies. \n\nAnd if you judge a restaurant by the patrons, you can tell this is a winning establishment.

For three people, we spend over $70 in food. However, I found some food and service was not up to par. \n\nI would give a two star because: \n\n1) The Chicken Tikki Masala is like the \"basics\" for indian cuisine but it was not as tasty as some other reviews were talking about! The meat was not cooked like other places and it taste like the dry salad chicken meat... For the price tag, I was expecting much more from the sauce and unfortunately it was not as tasty as I would like it to be. The food was served in white plate that cools down quite fast. \n\n2) Service was bad. Maybe they don't welcome \"non-white\" people going for their business? I requested to have my table wiped because there were a lot of crumbs from the samosas... The waitress who picked up the plate pointed that to another person, went back to the cashier area and talked to another person pointing at our table. This simple task was not done and it was very unpleasant for me to continue my meal at that point on. \n\nI did not receive enough attention and the staff felt lazy and unhappy. My concern from a business stand point was: There were many staff in this restaurant and some of them didn't look like they were busy compare to the number of tables. If the manager in this business was nice enough not to cut jobs at this low economy, shouldn't the staff play out their effort in rewarding the manager's kindness? \n\n\nHowever, I decided to give a third star because: \n\n1) The Roti mixed Tandoori was very good. The portion for salmon probably worth half of the price for this dish. It was cooked perfectly and not over cooked at all. There was also a small piece of chicken that tasted much better than the one in Tikki Masala. The beef was also small piece and it was cooked 80% which I liked it that way. The lamb was made into a sausage and had a very strong smell with it. If you don't like your lamb to be smelly, this dish might not be an option for you. \n\n2) The samosas was also excellent. The crust was so crispy and it was one of the better samosas I tried. I would rather it has three smaller piece than two big ones because I enjoyed the outside more than the fillings.

Sure, Naan and Curry is cheaper and the quality of food is about the same (although still not quite as good), but you go to a restaurant like Roti when you want the atmosphere of a nice restaurant and you're not in the mood to serve yourself.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I came in after a movie, and less than half the tables were filled, so we were able to sit down right away.  Yippie.  Our food came out no more than 5 minutes after we ordered, and it was just as good as always.  I love their menu.  Tons of choices, and I have yet to be disappointed.\n\nWhat was with the service?  First off, when we walk in, the hostess barely looks at us and asks (in an I don't give a damn kind of way): \"Alright so where do you wanna sit?\"  No big deal.  Then later on when someone else came in and asked if they were still open, she goes, \"Um...  Yeah.\"  I seriously had to hold back my laughter.  Not like it was an HOUR before closing time or anything.  I think our server hated his life.  No smile, didn't look up from his writing pad, didn't ask if we wanted anything to drink besides water, didn't ask if we wanted dessert before dropping off the check.  No wait.  I think he did smile.  It was when a friend of his opened the front door and yelled his name across the entire restaurant.  Now that's what I call professional.  Roti, you're letting yourself be represented that way?  I know you can do better...  I've seen it.\n\nHonestly, it takes a lot to actually bother me when it comes to service.  I've done the whole serving thing, so I totally understand when mistakes are made or food takes forever blah blah blah.  I didn't leave Roti feeling bothered or offended or anything, but I did feel really surprised to see such a blatantly unprofessional staff in such a good restaurant.  It's little restaurants like Roti where you find servers who suggest you try new things, who can recommend a glass of wine that pairs perfectly with the lamb vindaloo, and who get excited when you ask what their favorite dish is.  But hell...  the guy didn't even want us to order a stupid dessert.\n\nI'll go back.  I'm close, and good food = good food.  However, as far as providing the ultimate dining experience goes, Roti is slipping.", "author": "Jen P."}

The second we stepped in the door, I felt so welcome and her greeting really got the evening off on a positive note.  The interior of the restaurant consisted of warm tones (browns, oranges, etc.) and dark wooden tables.  There are also several couch- like booths as well.  I liked the photography on the walls.  \n\nWe started off with the secunjawl ($3) which is Indian-style lemonade.  It was very, very sweet.  I had a glass of the Gewurztraminer Chateau St. Mary's ($3) which was very sweet as well, but I like sweet wines.  The pour was quite generous.\n\nFor the entrees, we ordered the Chicken Korma and Chicken Tikka Masala (both $13) and Navrattan Korma because I had heard such good things about it from other Yelp reviews.  We also got 2 orders each of rice and plain naan ($3 per order).  The Chicken Korma was delicious!  It was very creamy and buttery.  It had a mild flavor and was a very simple dish.  The Tikka Masala had more spice to it and was good as well.  I was excited to try the Navrattan Korma and I liked it a lot.  There were plenty of vegetables and fruits in it and the flavor was on the sweet side.  I felt all three curries were great.  The naan hot fresh and chewy, which I like.  I felt the rice and naan portions were more than enough for two people.  I think next time, I would just get one naan and one rice for two people.  \n\nI know that at cheaper hole-in-the-wall places you could have gotten our entire meal for a fraction of the price, but you are paying for the ambiance and the fact that it's a nice sit down place.  The waitstaff is great and we received good service.  I think Roti is a nice place for a date as well as group dinners so you can try lots of different dishes.  I would recommend making reservations.  The neighborhood is really cute (lots of cafes, shops, and restaurants) and is easily accessible by Muni (West Portal station is just a block away).  Overall, I recommend this place and look forward to coming back!", "author": "Karen K."}

My friend Karen's friend who happens to be Indian said that this place is La Bomba. If a restaurant is endorsed by a native countryman, it's got to have some merit right?\n\nMy friend and I walked in to meet aforementioned friend Karen in our sweats since we just finished up rockclimbing at Mission Cliffs. We immediately regretted the decision to not change out of our damp, frumpy sweats. I'm the Naan n Curry/Indian Clay Oven variety of Indian food enthusiast, so i was quite surprised by how chi-chi this place was. Not a trace of the ethnic Indian vibe you come to expect.

But oh, the price. That doesn't look so good. It was definitely more expensive than i expected. I'm not a cheap person. Don't let my chinese exterior deceive you. I LOVE good food. Call me a glutton. You pay for what you get right? I'll pay for good food. But a $16 Prawn Vindaloo dish? It better be damn good! When we got our luxury dish, i was very disappointed to see that we had a total of 7 shrimp. And they called them PRAWNS. They are obese shrimp at best. Not Prawns. Definitely not prawns. The Chicken Tikka Masala does get 5 Stars for flavor and texture. It was definitely juicier than most other ones i've had. We also ordered a Lamb dish and the Aloo Ghobi both of which were rather tasty.\n\nThe service was decent. They were quick to take our order, bring our food, and made sure our glasses were never empty. \n\nThe food for taste and quality deserves 4 stars (minus the SHRIMP) but as far as VALUE, it did not quite make it to par.\n\n4 People:\nVegetable Samosa\nGarlic Naan\nRegular Naan\nRice\nLamb Dish\nChicken Tikka Masala\nAloo Ghobi\nPrawn Curry\n1 glass of Cote de Rhone\n= $96 with tip\n\nYIKES!

I chose this based in part on the recommendation of a friend who I usually trust, but...\n\nTwo of us had two entrees (chicken tikka masala, mixed tandoori) the basic rice, garlic (and basil??) naan, and kingfishers beers.  $80 with tax and tip\n\npleasant atmosphere, but very loud for an \"expensive\" restaurant.  adequate service.\n\nfood -- meh.  flavorless tikka masala ($16), usually one of my favorites, definition of bland here. at least i built up my empty calorie count..sigh. mixed tandoori ($22!) was 1 prawn, 1 small piece steak, 1 small piece chicken breast, 2 ground lamb, and 3 chunks of salmon.  the lamb was yummy, very very flavorful.  everything else...see, above, description of chicken tikka masala. the salmon was pretty well cooked, but if i didn't know i was in an indian restaurant, i would have had no idea based upon the flavor...nothing but a (too fishy) salmon  flavor.\n\nwould have been 3 stars, but -1 for the price.  esp in West Portal, for  $40/per person, expect outstanding food and/or service, and nothing here was more than....meh\n\nFortunately, my company made up for the restaurant's shortcomings! :-)", "author": "John R."}

I used to live in London where there are Indian restaurants everywhere and I think this place would be among the best even there. \n\nThe lamb in my Rogan Josh was incredibly tender and the sauce was perfect. The rice was great as well. I will definitely be going back to this place at some point.\n\nThe prices are a little bit high for Indian food (e.g. I'd expect to pay $10 for a curry, not $15), but it is above average quality and the portions are reasonable. \n\nI only took away one star because of some minor issues: the Nan bread was too flat and the food took about 10 minutes longer than they said it would. This caused me to have to wait standing up in front of the restaurant and I felt like I was ruining people's nice night out with my sandals and shorts. Like I said, minor issue.", "author": "Jamie D."}

The slightest hint of jalapeno triggers five-alarm signals to my poor taste buds. Don't judge. Having said that, Roti disappoints in fusing flavor and spiciness that Indian food is known for. Me and my guest ordered the Chicken Jalfrezi and Aloo Gobi (cauliflower plate). Both were curries carnivorous and vegetarian friendly, respectively. While both plates were decently spiced, they seriously lacked palatably, and I wasn't eager to dive in for a second taste. It was like eating a PB&J sandwich without the jelly, but then again I don't like jelly, bad analogy. The only reason i kept eating was to have something to dip my naan in, which you really can't go wrong with, even if it's just plain naan.  \n\nAll in all, the experience was pleasant: servers were attentive and polite, dim ambiance. May I add, it was a little noisy but maybe it was just that particular night due to 3 separate big parties taking place, one being a group of drunk 40-something cougars.  However, the food fell a little short of prompting future visits.", "author": "Annie L."}

I especially love it when it's delivered to me (mostly by Al Hamra, sometimes by Zante, on top of a pizza). But sometimes you have to go to the restaurant to get the best stuff.\n\nWe visited Roti on a rainy night, long after we'd first heard about the place. We were in the neighborhood dropping by the opening party for Citipets, a new pet store in the area that's an extension of a wonderful dog walking/pet sitting service. (Go and support them!) We felt welcomed by Roti's subtle lighting and surprisingly sophisticated ambiance.\n\nThe best dishes we ordered were the okra (bhindi masala), the eggplan (bengan bharta), and the garlic naan. Less stellar, but still fine, was the basic chicken curry (murgh masala). Rice was, well, rice. We enjoyed the water that came in the super-tall beaker.\n\nSitting right next to the kitchen wasn't ideal, but we hadn't made a reservation, so that placement was acceptable for a walk-in meal.

Anyplace that labels itself as an \"Indian Bistro\" is highly suspect in my opinion. I mean, calamari at an Indian restaurant? Please. \n\nSo when the waiter couldn't pronounce the word \"lassi\" correctly, it got my panties in a bunch. When I saw the prices, my fists started to clench. And when he informed me that they were out of mango juice, I think smoke may have started coming out of my ears.\n\nBut to my surprise, the food was really good. We ordered the Paneer Bhujia, the Cholay, the Chicken Tikka Masala, and the special Badami Chicken. I'm veg, so I only tasted the sauces on the chicken dishes, but it was all really tasty, and sufficiently spicy for my mirchi-loving companions. The naan basket was really yummy as well. My \"special Indian style lemonade\" was waaaaaaay too sweet though, and at five bucks for a mango lassi (or laaaaahsi, as the waiter pronounced it), it had better have diamond chips floating in it (it didn't).\n\nOnce we were presented with our hefty bill (about $100 for five of us, which is a lot for Indian food, especially when Indians are eating it), it took the staff a good 15 minutes to pick up our credit cards, and then there was huge confusion about how to split the bill between three cards. It was a bit insane, especially since they seemed to have more waitstaff than customers at the time.\n\nAnyway, I agree with those reviewers who've said they'd come here again, as long as someone else is paying.

My favorite places being Vik's Chaat Corner in Berkeley and Mehfil Indian Cuisine in downtown SF.  This place wasn't too bad!\n\nI've been judging my favorite Indian food places by how good their Chicken Korma is (so far, Mehfil is the best!), and the korma I had at Roti was pretty decent.  The portions were decent to share with 2-3 people, but were very pricey ($13 for Chicken Korma?!)!  My only complaint was that the chicken they used seemed to be rather tough.  The pieces are larger than I'm used to,  and the dish just seemed very simple - chicken and sauce.  I'm used to korma with more substance - with nuts, shredded coconut, ginger, onion, garlic and tomatoes.  Don't get me wrong though, it was tasty none the less.\n\nAnother staple we ordered was the Palak Paneer (Saag Paneer).  It was really good.  I would have liked it to be a bit spicier.  The cheese was very good and it wasn't overly heavy like some other places make it.  We ordered the garlic basil naan, and it seemed to compliment both dishes very well.\n\nService was exceptional and so fast!!  A beautiful restaurant with a very nice atmosphere (it was really quiet when we went).  I'm just not sure about the prices - a tick over $40 for an appetizer, two dishes, rice and naan and two sodas is a lot to pay for Indian food when you consider what else is around (Mehfil is an easy $10 less for similar fare).  But, I suppose you're paying for the ambiance. \n\nGlad I tried this place, but I think I'll be heading back downtown for Mehfil.", "author": "Christy L."}

That included any and all Indian food. Alas, I finally satisfied my bf's craving for Indian by suggesting this new, hip Indian bistro in West Portal. Where is West Portal anyways?\n\nWhen we walked around the corner and saw the sign, first thing out of my bf's mouth, \"Oh, it's a bistro...\"  What does bistro mean anyways one may ask and can you really classify an Indian joint as a \"bistro\"? From wikipedia: Bistro is a familiar name for a type of small restaurant serving moderately priced simple meals in an unpretentious setting. Well, that hit the nail on the head! Now although, most of you are well familiar with the ubiquitous Naan n Curries that raid the tenderloin, this was clean, modern, and had excellent food. The tandoori chicken was tender and full of spiced flavor. The chicken tikka masala and chicken korma were also fantastic winners in my book. We definitely would have tried more had there been more than two of us.\n\nWine list was surprisingly good for this type of restaurant and certainly for an Indian restaurant. And based on the general ambiance, I knew not to be afraid of the wine being open for days on end.\n\nTip - park on Portola and feel free to call ahead for reservations. Everyone is super nice and friendly.\n\nThis place has made me like Indian food again!  I might even go back to Shalimar...wait, that's a strong statement.

I guess they are just living up to the bistro in their name.  Anyway, it was a Wednesday evening and the place was a little more than half full. The servers were rushing around trying their best, but were not very attentive. On a positive note, every server we managed to flag down was friendly and helpful.\r\n\r\nWe started with a tasty appetizer sampler including a samosa, veggie pakoras and a papad. The palak paneer (spinach/cheese, $10) and baingan bartha (tandoori roasted eggplant, $9) curries were both excellent. My mother-in-law had the $17 mixed seafood curry, which was ultra-fishy (not my thing). The breads were tasty, but the naan was a bit flatter and glistening with ghee more than I like, and virtually indistinguishable from the tandoori roti. \r\n\r\nI don't know whether I'd choose to dine here again, but I might be tempted to take out a couple of their delicious vegetarian curries.", "author": "Ron L."}

You will not find any red grease-laden or turmeric tossed dishes here. The food uses traditional Indian spices, full of flavor and intrigue, without blowing you out of your chair or denying a close conversation days after. Their bread basket is a a great assortment of naan and kulcha and I highly recommend it for a meal of 3+ people. The makhani sauce is great and the traditional tandoori options are also good. The service is thoughtful and very focused on the diner's overall experience. Once, when I was with a large party waiting and waiting for our main dishes, the wait staff brought additional apps free of charge. Certainly, the crowd is not a diverse one, but the food, service and atmosphere should appeal to all types.\n\nUpdate 6/2/07: the last couple times I've been, none of the usual wait staff were there, and there seems to be a new owner, but I'm not sure. The service has noticeably declined and the dining room is always crazy crowded. After being seated late for a few reservations, I get the sense that their window for dining time is too small on Open table or something. It is appreciated that they dole out the free port and appetizers to make up for their lack of service, but I'd rather they bring their A-game to the table the first time around.

Coming from London I was almost brought up eating Indian food, and can say that this restaurant serves my favorite Chicken Tikka Masala. I was there last night and had a great lamb dish with an artery clogging paratha - yummy.  I also love the monthly specials - it helps make up for what is a comparatively limited menu. However, let's not forget that the limited menu is what enables them to make such fresh food.\n\nGreat photography on the walls - particulalry the portrait and the Ardh Kumbh festival.\n\nMy one gripe - it is impossible to get through on their phone to order a take-away. Oh - and why on earth do they not do delivery!!!", "author": "Tony H."}

I remember eating there on there 1 year anniversary and they were giving patrons free flutes of champagne to celebrate.  It's popularity has definitely skyrocketed and I would highly suggest making a reservation ahead of time if you have a fairly large party.  Couldn't say for sure which nights are the most popular aside from your typical Fri/Sat. chaos you see everywhere.  \n\nI always get the Navratan Korma, which is fantatic.  Along with raita, somosas, veggie biryani and naan.  You pretty much can't go wrong.  I'm not a meat eater (generally) but even the tandoori chicken gets my nose tickling and my mouth watering.  My boy always gets the chicken tikka masala or the Chicken Boti Tikka, both of which always have excellent quality chicken.  \n\nWe've brought both sets of parents here and even hooked friend's parents on this place.  It is on the fairly pricey side if you're looking for affordable Indian so we do save it for more \"special\" occasions.  But boy do I wish I could eat here more often.", "author": "Kirsten B."}

I have had a lot of good Indian food and I am lucky enough to have authentic home cooked Indian food often...\nSo I needed to bring a large amount of food to a Christmas party.  I looked around the South San Francisco area, and there isn't much Indian food available.  I drove to West Portal to pick up the chicken tikka masala, naan, and rice.  Luckily a lot of coworkers and family at the party haven't had a lot of Indian food because they thought it was okay.  Meanwhile my boyfriend and I were extremely let down.  I spent a fortune on that food and it was just mediocre and greasy.  It actually didn't taste at all like chicken tikka masala.  The restaurant is expensive, probably because of the decor but definitely not because of the food.  I would much rather get food at a more authentic restaurant with less fancy decor.", "author": "Christine L."}

You wouldn't think you were eating in an Indian restaurant from the decor since it's modern. The atmosphere is very casual and a bit loud. \n\nThe good stuff: the meal! We went with the Garlic and Basil Naan, Murgh Masala curry, one of the Veggie curries with farmer's cheese (this dish was my favorite, the cheese tasted like tofu - YUM), Kashmiri Biryani rice - this was EXCELLENT and the Halibut special. We were VERY happy with our choices. I also ordered the mango lassi... mmm mmm.\n\nI'm only giving 4-stars because the service was lacking. After our food was taken away to be packaged, we must have waited 20 mins for the bill, our server apologized and offered us tea, coffee and dessert on the house - but being so late, we decided to pass. \n\nOverall, I would come back to this cute West Portal dining establishment.", "author": "S N."}

We could not believe they were charging $16.00 for Chicken Tikka Masala but decided to place 2 orders anyway since it's one of our favorites dishes. BAD MISTAKE. It tasted like americanized indian food, not tasty & not worth the price. Go to Chutney Restaurant where you'll get the same dish for $6.49 & it tastes SO MUCH BETTER. They serve AUTHENTIC indian food that's reasonably priced& their food is VERY delicious unlike wannabe Roti Indian Bistro. \n\nOrdered Mango Lassi, which was delicious but again OVERPRICED. They charge $5.00 whereas Chutney charges $2.00 for a larger portion & is just as delicious.\n\nOrdered Gulad Jalum, which was delicious but again OVERPRICED, not to mention the serving size is more suitable for a child. They charge $5.00 whereas Chutney charges $2.00, is just as delicious & serving size is for an adult.\n\nWe did not eat the majority of our meal so we asked the busser if he could box it up. Asked him to please include the dips for the appetizers & bread we ordered. Got home & there was no sauce. What did he put instead? The used lemon wedge that we squeezed over our appetizer. Really? Yes, really.  In addition, I hardly ate any of my Chicken Tikka Masala yet all he put in the to-go container was the chicken and left out almost all of the sauce that comes with it. WOW. Ummm... I paid for that entire dish as a whole and should get it as a whole if I want it to-go, not to mention the sauce is the best part of any Chicken Tikka Masala dish. HELLO???  \n\nEnd price was $66.00 and really worth $10.00 & that's being generous considering the entire experience. I still gave the server an $11.00 tip because it's not her fault she works for a crappy, overpriced restaurant.\n\nP.S. I do not work for Chutney Restaurant.", "author": "Randie M."}

The flavors of the food really shine, their tandoori is spot on and very flavorful. The creaminess of the Tikka Masala is the best. Next time: Vindaloo!  I would add that the only reason I kept it to 4 instead of 5 stars is because the person clearing the table and pouring water was extremely sloppy. His attempt to be swift was cumbersome. It's not necessary to pile up every single plate in one swoop. It's noisy, distracting, sloppy with bits of food flying across the table. I really didn't care for that.

Anyway, we also had the lamb special and it was amazing.  The lentils and spinach were really good too.  Everything was good and spicy with gorgeous flavors.   My husband and I both ate too much and got a tummy ache.

PROS: One star for Nice atmosphere, but that's the only thing working for this place\n\nSo, I wanted to try this place for the longest time since it always looked packed and I remember even seeing this place advertised in the United Airlines magazine on the way back from a flight.  So I went there on a Sunday night for dinner, place wasn't too packed but we were waiting for at least twenty minutes for our food to arrive.  The waiter only came by one time to say \"Sorry guys, your food is coming soon\" before we waited another 10 minutes and the food finally came...It was sooo disappointing.  Indian food is supposed to make your mouth water with different spices and flavors...this food was bland and boring.  The palek paneer just tasted like spinach, no spices...the Chicken Vindaloo tasted just like spaghetti sauce with Raman Noodle seasoning...the WORST of all the Garlic Naan was cold and soggy in the middle but just crispy on the edges and overdone with basil and little garlic.  Service was really slow and even the check took forever to come.\n\nIt's one thing paying a little more for a nice atmosphere, but it another thing when the food is so unauthentic that I'm better off going to Tasty Curry for half the price.  It just pisses me off when people open a fancy restaurant in a nice neighborhood, dumb the food down to mediocre standards and get away with it.", "author": "Kris M."}

My boss did a few months of a Doctor's Without Borders kind of program in India so he KNOWS Indian food. He thinks Roti is the best. I think otherwise at this point. See, I was best friends with a girl whose father lived with a Punjabi woman and, as my boss agreed, the Punjabis make THE BEST Indian food.  Roti couldn't hold a candle to Karinjeet's cooking and I was really disappointed with my aloo gobhi. It wasn't the harmonious blend of potatoes, cauliflower and curry sauce that I'm accustomed to at many other lesser priced Indian establishments in SF. It was chunky and had a thin sauce, that could be described as spicy but not much else. The chicken biryani was good and so was the cucumber raita and naan bread but I make all judgements based on my favorite dish: aloo gobhi.  For the price of Roti, it should have been GREAT and it was just MEH.  I'm glad I didn't pay for it.  I may give Roti a second chance but not unless it's another free meal.", "author": "Jill D."}

I will proceed to give positive reviews for the restaurants and businesses that I do like, however after our experience this evening at Roti I feel compelled to post this. We've been to Roti many times and have had good experiences, but this evening they were just a mess. The restaurant was busy (though not full) when we arrived and were told that they were having trouble with their reservation system. We had a reservation and were seated immediately. We ordered relatively quickly and our mango lassis and water were brought, however I could tell that our waiter was not in a great mood. We waited a long time before our waiter came over to say that our appetizers would be out soon. Well, soon was at least 10 minutes before our almost unidentifiable Assorted Appetizers arrived. The Vegetable Pakoras were a big stuck together, slightly burnt mess. All the while I continued to observe our waiter speaking to the cooks when at the open kitchen (at the rear of the restaurant) and he did not look pleased. The entire staff was running around like the Keystone Kops, although as my oft quoted significant other said, that would be an insult to the Keystone Kops. The only exception was the buffoonish manager who most of the time was standing at the cash register located at the rear bar. At one point another patron who was sitting quite close to him stood up and extended his arms outward to inquire as to what the hell was going on!! I could see that they too had been waiting an inordinate amount of time for their food. I applauded him! We still had another very long wait for dinner to arrive. Our waiter did come over to say that dinner would be out soon. I asked him what the problem was, and he said that the kitchen has been slow despite his requests. When dinner finally did arrive, ironically the Chicken Tandoori (which should be served sizzling) was barely warm after the long wait. When I told our waiter he offered to reheat it, but I was afraid that they would just dry it out. The Saag Gosht, Basmati rice and naan were all OK, but nothing memorable. I'm sure partly because we had such a long wait. By this time the restaurant was not crowded at all. The table of younger, overly loud and inappropriately dressed group (flip flops on a 40 something degree evening) behind us which arrived way after we did received all of their food quite quickly. Obviously, I DO NOT RECOMMEND Roti and WILL NOT BE GOING BACK! BTW, they didn't charge us for the appetizers.", "author": "Dan B."}

Note that that's a-la-carte; rice and naan are extra.  But hey - I'm not against expensive food; my favorite restaurant in SF is Gary Danko.  The question is - is it worth it?\n\nWell, I'd say no.  The chicken korma was really fantastic; rich hearty sauce with a wonderfully smoky aroma not unlike a good smoked gouda.  High quality breast-meat chicken from the tandoor.  This was good stuff.  \nRice was thoroughly seasoned, but not to the point of absurdity and was tasty.  \nNaan was less impressive, but as we got ours takeout, I won't count this against them; naan just doesn't travel well.  \nThe murgh masala, on the other hand (chicken curry) looked like the Exxon Valdez crashed into it.  The top was nothing but pools of oil/ghee/something that was really quite revolting.  Don't get me wrong - I like me some gee-liciousness, but I don't want to see it pooling on my food.  I managed to spoon out a good tablespoon or so before eating.  Given that this isn't one of the menu items listed as involving butter, I'm a bit scared as to what they'd look like.  Flavor?  Eh, certainly not anywhere near as spicy or interesting as I'd been hoping (given the list of garlic & ginger & peppercorn in the description), and the chicken was of somewhat lower quality than that in the korma - decidedly more chunks of fat throughout it.  Maybe you like chicken fat; me - not so much.\nAt least the included chutney and mint sauces were good.\n\nOverall, good enough I'll try them again, and see if I get a different experience, but not good enough for a glowing recommendation.\nOh - and if you're told that your takeout order will take 25 minutes, it'll probably take less.  We came back after 20, and it was already sitting out waiting for us.  And as the aforementioned naan doesn't travel well... the less time waiting, the better.\n\nFYI, 2 entrees, 1 rice, 2 naan: $33", "author": "Don H."}

I tried it due to the reviews here and was delighted. It was definitely among the best Indian food I've ever had. I ordered take-out, apparently, enough for 4 people, but it was so good I ate almost all of it myself! The garlic/basil naan was the best naan I've ever had. The vegetable bryani rice, also, was the best ever. The lamb curry was fantastic though the curry was a little on the watery side (this is the primary reason for 4 and not 5 stars), and the benghan bharta (sp?) eggplant curry was fantastic. The service is slow, I had to wait a long time to pick up my take out order even though I had ordered it 30 minutes earlier. The prices are the highest I have ever seen for Indian food. That meal cost almost $50. However, on the menu, they indicate a preference for local and organic ingredients including organic meats. And, I could tell the ingredients were top quality.\n\n12/13/07 downgrading from 4 stars to 2 stars. The first meal here was amazing. The second meal was OK. The third time, I ordered extra food to freeze some and have as dinners during the week. What a mistake. The quality was so poor that I had to throw away almost 2/3 of everything I purchased. The garbanzo beans were cheap quality from a can that had been sitting out too long and gone rancid, in a curry sauce that was flavorless. The chicken was hard and only white meat, not tender, in a curry that also lacked any flavor. The lamb curry was OK. The spinach and potato had to be thrown away because the quality was so bad. \n\nThis place is unbelievably busy. My guess is that they are motivated by pure greed and in a desire to make as much money as possible, as fast as possible, they've cut quality to the minimum so they can push out more and more food. That's the impression I have. Also, my take out orders have always been late, past the 40 minute timeline they promise.", "author": "Eater S."}

We didn't care too much for the papadum, the samosa was good, but we all like the vegetable pakoras -- especially with the mint chutney or plum sauce they served with it. \nFor our entrees, we got the Chicken Tikka Masala, Chicken Vindaloo, and the Lamb Korma, along with an order of Roti's Basmati Pulao (rice) as well as an order of Garlic & Basil and an order of Onion Kulcha roti (breads).\nAt first we were hesitant, trying everything with caution and helping ourselves to modest servings, but all of it was so tasty that we quickly threw a munch! The Lamb Korma was a recommendation from the server, and a good one at that! It had this delicious, creamy sauce. The Chicken Vindaloo was really good too! It was pretty spicy, but it was so delicious you can't stop eating it, even if you start to sweat from the heat, as one of us did, haha.\n\nThe service could've been a bit better though. Eating such spice-full dishes, our water glasses were often empty and we had to wait awhile for drink refills.

WOW!  this was perfect and this plate was utterly demolished.  i would go back here just for this!\n\nfor entrees we got the CTM, bhuna ghost and the paneer makhni.  the CTM was different than most CTMs as it wasn't as creamy.  so while i'll say pakwan still ranks up top my CTM sauce list, roti's chicken itself was A LOT better.  the chicken was well seasoned and cooked.  the sauce itself was still very good.  the bhuna ghost was excellent too (this was a lamb dish).  the paneer makhni's sauce was reminiscent of a CTM-like sauce.  the paneer was cooked well and the dish was a hit.  we saw that there was a chicken makhni on the menu too so we wondered if that would turn out.  next time!\n\nfor naans, we got 2 orders of plain naan, 1 order of the garlic basil naan and 1 of the goat cheese naan.  the plain naan i heard was good.  the garlic naan was incredible from what i hear.  but i focused solely on the goat cheese naan.  this was incredible and worked very well with the dishes.  the naan was stuff with an extremely mild goat cheese so it fit perfectly with all of our entrees.\n\nthe decor of the place is nice and warm though one big pic that was in the back of the dining hall kept on freakin me out but that's ok.  the service was very good.  our waiter, joakim, did a great job in helping out w/ the wine selection and always made sure that we were doing just fine.\n\ncan't wait to go back to try out some of the other items.  also, i want to check out the west portal area.  this was my first time in that area and it looks to be an untapped resource for culinary excursions!", "author": "Swarup B."}

I think it's great to have these places around and since I am not independently wealthy, I usually eat at this variety of restaurant. But seriously, why the bad attitude about a nice Indian place? Yes, the dishes are more expensive (perhaps even twice as much as an inexpensive Indian restaurant at about $15), but the flavor was really excellent in my opinion. I couldn't judge \"authenticity\" since I have not been to India and I frankly feel that this is a little bit of a bogus category.  The dishes were familiar, but with something a little extra. \nThe atmosphere was soothing and a little fancier, but I got to sit in the window seat so I was very comfortable. The service was also good and very prompt. \nMaybe not a once a week kind of place, since it was a little pricier, but I thought it was worth driving from the Panhandle to check it out. We will go back for a low-key evening.", "author": "Katy W."}

While there may be other Indian restaurants in the City, Roti on West Portal is the place we take those we want to impress with a great Indian meal. After we took our nieces there - one is vegetarian - we completely changed our ordering style.  We always get a veggie dish because they are as wonderful as the chicken and lamb dishes. Out of towners who haven't had a good Indian meal ever or in a while walk out sated and sorry to be leaving.  For groups of people, the Bread Basket is a must and all of the dishes are great for sharing. Sometimes - and I'm not going to ding them for this since it is rare! - the order of things out of the kitchen can be out of whack.

The lights were dimmed but not so much that you can hardly make out the face of your friend or significant other (i.e. no steakhouse lighting) which is good in my opinion since very very dim lighting puts me to sleep. We weren't greeted by the host or hostess. In fact there was no one in the front except some lady (whom I thought was the hostess was busily chatting away with her friends.) It seemed a bit awkward at first since there wasn't anybody to seat us for a minute so it felt like they were done for the night but we were seated eventually. The waiter was polite but I think the service could definitely be better, i.e. more water please! I ordered the Roti Dal which had lentils and other veggies; I don't know if they add any cream of sort to it but it tasted creamy but not spicy at all if you know what real Indian food taste like!! (I like my food very very spicy.) My friend ordered a special they have for this month Shakooti Lamb and that tastes pretty good and it still wasn't spicy enough for my liking but had that kick! In fact it makes the Roti Dal taste muuuccchhh better if you mix them together, use the naan to scoop it up, and get that great meld of spices&flavor. We also ordered a mango lassi and a chai tea. The mango lassi was a great drink to have with the meal or dessert (tropical flavor from the mango and creamy consistency of the yogurt.) The chai tea (as I was told) tasted decent but it doesn't have any sugar added into it (just to let you know.)

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-06-11", "description": "I'd love to give this place 3.5 stars but that just isn't in the cards. Almost every time I come here I end up ordering the Roti feast. I've probably had it more than 10 times, by virtue of Roti being the closest  indian food to our house. I love the  tandoori, daal, palak paneer and paneer kofta. \nI'm lukewarm about the samosas and chicken tikka masala. In general it's a great dining experience. It can be a bit tight on busy evenings and the service can be great or poor, depending which server you get, but I would (and do) recommend it. The 1.5 star deduction is for a slight lack of authenticity of flavor (not always a bad thing), the sometimes spotty service and the rather high price. Naan N Curry on Irving has a more authentic taste (not that I'd really know me = alabaster gringo) a much grimier atmosphere and a much lower price. Both are worth checking out. Roti would be a good place to take a date, Naan N Curry would be a good place to take hand sanitizer.", "author": "Christopher K."}

A lot of tears were shed, for they were feeling neglected.  It's all because of that horrible Roti!  In fact, the only tummys to fill those empty chairs in those empty restaurants were the ones turned away from the doors of the ever so Polished and posh Roti.  How do you get in?  Do those people that do get in ever come out?  Would you want to?  \n\n  Roti is loud and bawdy; like the king of the block should be.  The interior is an expensive high gloss page from a magazine.  The service shines the shoes of your stomache after guiding your every step or chasing you all over a huge playground of a menu.  The Bauchus comes out and plays the wine flute for you too!

From the appetizers to the last sips of tea at the end of your meal, the food is probably some of the best I have ever had. Last minute reservations or walk in seating can be a chore, but that's how it goes when great food secrets get out. In those situations I suggest take-out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-06-16", "description": "Roti is my favorite Indian restaurant by far. So why then am I giving this place a 3-star rating and not higher one? To start off, I am very picky; in order for a place to get a 4 or 5-star rating, I feel like the place must earn it, and though Roti is my favorite Indian place, it has not yet earned a high rating. The noise level at Roti is almost unbearable. Talk about din while having din-din(dinner).  The food is ok, depending on what you get. My favorite is the Gosht Vindaloo. It's delicious. Other dishes are a bit strange for my pallet, but the overall food quality is good. The decor is very modern. The other major critique I have about Roti is its service. The waitpeople are horrible. They are rude, and slow, and so complacent when it comes to checking on the customers. I hate being ignored and having to wait 10-15 minutes to get their attention when trying to order more food, or get the check. In the end, Roti is a good place if you haven't had Indian food. The price range is average (from some $7-25). The average price for the dishes there is about $16-17. Bottom line: try Roti, just don't expect 5 star quality at this 3.5 star restaurant.", "author": "Kevin D."}

While I want to give Roti a solid 4 stars, the reasons to do so end there.  Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, however I think you can get food that is just as good (or nearly as good) at a MUCH cheaper hole in the wall joint.  On top of that, Roti is the happy owner of a robust take-out business, which helps to overwhelm the kitchen.  In other words, you have to wait a very long time for the dishes you order.  Again, once you do get the food, it is quite good (I had a mix of lamb, chicken, and veggie dishes), but costs substantially more than regular Indian fare (and the cost simply does not outweigh the benefit in this guy's analysis).  On the plus side, the naan was very good and the sauces were thick and delicious.  Finally, the service was lacking.  While this was not due to the wait staff itself (I still gave the standard 20% of course), it was due to the fact that Roti is understaffed, and it shows.  Oh yeah, don't order the egg plant fritter appetizer, it's not worth it.  All that being said, I would still say that Roti is a very good place for a date...you know, \"show her that you mean it with some expensive Indian food in a nice atmosphere.\"  Even though this review is too long and too annoying: the door is often propped open by people waiting for tables, and it can be chilly in the tables as a result.", "author": "Mr. G."}
