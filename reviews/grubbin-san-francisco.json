Your food will get to you lightning quick because the kitchen is right behind the cashier and they will start making your order AS SOON AS THEY HEAR YOU SAY IT.\n\nThe food itself is absolutely amazing. They have so many options for bread, whether you like a typical Dutch crunch or just want to go conventional and have it between two slices of white bread. They've got all the sides you need, from fries to chicken nuggets to wings, and even just plain old chips. The best part--they serve your sandwich so piping hot that you won't even be able to hold it for the first few seconds. The sandwiches themselves are so filling that I can usually down a Subway footlong in one sitting, but I can only eat half of a Grubbin' sandwich!\n\nI definitely recommend the sweet or spicy mouth waterin' chicken sandwich. It's delicious and has sooo many flavors and a generous amount of chicken tenders. If you've ever been to NYC, it reminds me of a better version of a Sticky's sandwich. \n\nOverall, I completely love this place.

I ordered the house recommended Grubbin' and found it made just right. The meat (pastrami, smoked ham, salami, and bacon) was stacked nice and high but admittedly, it was composed mostly of pastrami and ham. Pesto and grub sauce added a nice creamy richness while the non-negotiables (lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles) brought it all together. Dutch crunch was also the perfect vessel for this sandwich.\n\nTo complement my sandwich, I opted for a side of tots. Fried fresh, they were crispy and piping hot when delivered, but were a tad overfried in my opinion. Still good though.

No problems with checking in for a free bag of chips. \n\nThe sandwiches came out pretty quickly. Compared to Lou's, the sandwiches are smaller. You get less meat and less filling. Maybe that's just me because others have commented on the huge quantity of meat. Both my wife and son made similar comments about the smaller size, so ymmv. The pastrami was made incorrectly; there was both pastrami and ham inside. I didn't want to wait so I just accepted it.\n\nThe sandwiches were ok. The grubbin' sauce wasn't special in any way. I couldn't taste anything special about it. There really wasn't much sauce. The meat was just your average meat. I don't have anything really to add... the sandwiches were decent.

It was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The toppings were also very fresh and the sandwich was stacked and wrapped neatly.

The dining area is pretty small, but they had Moana playing on the TV to entertain me while I was waiting. Parking can also be a challenge on the streets nearby, so allot some time for that.

I'm biased! \n\nDroolin' ($8) - Pastrami, salami, pepper jack cheese, spicy aioli, and grub sauce. You can never go wrong with a sandwich topped with meats!!

It's soo good when topped with all these yummy meats. I didn't see it the first time I came and I regret it! But it made my mouth water. I guess I should've figured because it looks like the house sandwich with the name 'grubbin'.

When my order arrived, there were only 2 sandwiches. I talked to the restaurant, they refunded me for the missing sandwich. Everything was cool. \n\nI just want to preface this next bit by saying I believe the fault is with Grubhub, not the restaurant. The restaurant manager did as much as she could to correct my order. However, I think there needs to be better Grubhub-restaurant training, because restaurants can say what they like about an order, but Grubhub won't necessarily honor the restaurant's word. \n\nWe are a small, private, office, we order delivery lunch because we don't have a kitchen or nearby resources. After the first mishap with the sandwich, the restaurant manager called me back to tell me that if I placed the order again, she'll assign a Grubhub driver ASAP so the sole sandwich would be delivered to us as fast as possible. She then proceeded to tell me she would refund the entire order, as a courtesy. Now, before I placed the order, I mentioned that I would have to pay the delivery fee again, which I did not want to do. She ensured me she could refund everything. So I placed the order again. Fast forward to 3 hours later, 4 fights with Grubhub chat representatives, one incorrect refund, two missing receipts, a $5 bill that was sent with the sandwich from the restaurant (which I now have to drive back to return, because we don't handle cash at our company) and I'm just in awe at the effort it took to order some sandwiches. I also paid $5.43 MORE for two sandwiches in two transactions, than I would have by just not re-ordering that second sandwich.

Really slow service. I waited over 30 minutes for 2 sandwiches to go.  At least three people who were served after me got their food first.  A couple who ordered after me got their food and were finishing eventhough I was still waiting on mine.  One customer got their orders mixed up and they had to remake hers, ended up getting a refund and a free sandwich, but hers were being made at the same time as mine... hm... \n\n2. It was a really beautiful day in SF. High 60s outside, but inside was 70 degrees plus. They had one large fan on the floor by the door blowing full blast, and one smaller wall fan, but that was nothing in comparison to at least 2 ovens, fryer, and what looked like no proper ventilation heating up the place.\n\n3. When I got home, we tried the sandwiches, and they were in fact delicious. We gobbled it up and told each other we'll just call ahead for future orders to avoid the long wait...\n\n4. Unfortunately, both of our stomachs within hours started growling and we were taking turns using the bathroom for what seemed like eternity. We've spent the hours trying to figure out what we both ate, and unfortunately the common denominator were the sandwiches.\n\nThinking back now, I do think the sandwiches could've been contaminated due to the much warmer temperature in the restaurant. I'm fully aware that the meat, sauces, etc. are kept in a cooler/temperature monitored stalls, but I recall seeing the middle prep table in the kitchen not refrigerated, and it was so warm inside, that the meat and the sauces could've easily gone bad...\n\nIt's really a darn shame, because despite the ridiculous long wait, and non existent customer service, the sandwiches were tasty at the time for me to say \"we'll order ahead next time.\" I also saw one guy and one girl working hard making the sandwiches and I want the restaurant to be successful.

I was excited to try it since it's close to home, and also a friend recommended it.\n\nArrived with parking right in front, awesome. We checked in and got the free potato chips. The bagged chips were actually really good - the Cape Cod style. Anyway onto the sandwiches - I ordered the Juicin', which had turkey, bacon, avacado, sprouts, provolone cheese, pesto aioli, and grub sauce....sounded great, but when I ate it, it fell short. Turkey was too bland of a meat to be placed with the ingredients. Or rather, the meat wasn't flavorful enough, so it just got drowned out. I was excited to get the Dutch Crunch roll that looks so amazing in everyone's pics. But it made the sandwich really sweet for some reason, which made the sandwich even more disappointing. My bf got the Droolin' (pastrami, salami, pepper jack cheese, spicy aioli, and grub sauce)....a little better since it was pastrami and salami meat, but also the same blandness. \n\nWe also ordered Garlic Fries, and Tater tots, that also looked good in the pics. However, these were also very disappointing. The tater tots tasted like something you'd buy from safeway (not even trader joe's) and heat up in your oven.\n\nService -- not extremely friendly. Just got a vibe that the cashier didn't like working there. Also there's this Chinese lady they have cleaning up and bussing tables that can only speak Chinese - difficult to communicate with her. \n\nDisappointing...wanted to love, but couldn't.

The people of Grubbin' put a tasty spin on classic deli choices, like their Spicy Mouth Waterin', with spicy aioli, ranch and grubbin' sauce on a huge chicken tender. That's my favorite! Honestly any sandwich is a good option here. Don't forget your order of tater tots. You can get them 'cheesy' too, and when I say 'can', I mean 'must'. :) \n\nATMOSPHERE: They have limited seating in this small spot but if you're not in a rush, take a seat.

My boyfriend and I have been meaning to try this place out, and quite frankly, we intended to go to Lou's Cafe that day. Instead, we discovered Lou's Cafe was closed so it was only fate to bring us to finally try out Grubbin'. \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered the Spicy Mouth Waterin' sandwich and chicken tenders & fries. I was disappointed when the guy taking our orders said that we could not add garlic fries..when we easily saw that they did via yelp! It wasn't a deal breaker and I just got regular fries instead. The chicken tenders and fries came out first and then the sandwich came much much later. I really enjoyed that they had a variety of dipping sauces for the chicken tenders. More importantly, I asked for more than one kind of sauce and I didn't get any weird stares from the workers or was charged additionally for them!

They had the standard Cheetos and lays, but they also had Hawaiian chips (woot Maui onion) and sun chips. \n\nWhen we got the sandwiches we were sooo happy to see that they were huuuugeee (we were starving)!!! Very comparable to the size of Ike's. Drove home and opened them to see that the bread was still in shape and not soggy at all, and my chicken tenders were still crispy!! Yay! I took my first bite and immediately tasted the sauces. The honey mustard and the grubbin sauce went so well together.

They also offer sides of fries, tater tots, buffalo wings, and chicken tenders. \n\nI ordered Grubbin' It - pastrami, smoked ham, salami, bacon, sprouts, cheddar cheese, pesto aioli, and grub sauce on Dutch crunch bread. I was expecting a huge, mouth-watering sandwich, but it did not meet expectations. First, just by looking at it, it didn't look spectacular. Then, it tasted just as it looked...good, but not spectacular. As far as the meat, I mostly tasted the ham, which is my least favorite of all the meat in the Grubbin' It. I barely tasted the bacon, which was the reason I chose to order it over the Droolin' (but it was in there, I checked). I hardly tasted the pastrami and cheddar cheese in the sandwich. The Dutch crunch bread was a little off as well. I wouldn't say it was stale, but it really did not have that delicious, sweet taste that fresh Dutch crunch usually has. The grub sauce was dripping out of the sandwich, making it very soggy and messy to eat. Overall, it was still a good sandwich, it just wasn't mind-blowing. People hyped it up too much. \n\nWhat I did like about my experience...it's a cute, little shop with great concept, name, and logo. The staff was very friendly, they made my sandwich in very reasonable time, and they offered a free bag of chips with Yelp check-in. I also like that they offer stamp cards for loyal customers.

What makes them stand apart is their unique twist on naming their sandwiches, use of sprouts (which I really appreciate), and their amazing sides! I have never had a bad sandwich from Grubbin', but I have yet to try everything. This time around, my intended sandwich, Fishin', was not available, so I went with the Droolin' (Pastrami and Salami), which can't go wrong and it was awesome! Don't know exactly what's in the Grub sauce, but it makes a difference! I figure it's like how Lou's has their sauce, Grubbin' has their Grub sauce.

It has ham, lettuce, pineapples and a special sauce I think. I got it on Dutch crunch and it was amazing! Would definitely recommend! I also ordered the tater tots and the garlic fries and shared everything between two people. The tater tots were really crunchy and fried to perfection :) the garlic fries were very garlicky. Personally, I thought it was a good amount of garlic, however it was a bit oily and not fried well enough so it was a bit limp/soggy. Lol. I would like to try other sandwiches next time and the cheesy tots as well. I would definitely come back! The service is great as well. It has only three tables I believe and some bar space so there's not much seating there and it took a bit for all our food to come. However, they were really friendly and thoughtful while they brought our orders to the table. They asked if we needed an extra tray since we were sharing and also helped us box our food and assured us that our food would be coming right up.

But nothin' about the sandwiches names are tellin' you which ingredients are actually in it, so you'll need to read the menu in more detail.\n\nWhile in the neighborhood and before Lou's opened one block west, we stopped by Grubbin' to see what they had to offer. It was a warm Sunday afternoon and they were quite busy, so they unfortunately ran out of dutch crunch AND sourdough rolls!\n\nI settled for the Droolin' (pastrami, salami, pepper jack cheese, spicy aioli, and house grub sauce) on a french roll. The french roll was okay, soft and fluffy but lacked any crispness. The pastrami tasted very processed and was unmemorable. Yes, a lot of deli meat contains many additives, ie: nitrates and nitrites, but something about their pastrami just didn't sit right with me.\n\nService was nice, and since sandwiches are toasted, the prep time was roughly 7-10 minutes. Sandwiches are quite large and meat portions are generous. You also get a free bag of chips with a yelp checkin. Overall, Grubbin' offers a great value, but I found my sandwich to be forgettable.

The perfectly toasted and crunchy sourdough bread was perfect with the roasted eggplant, sprouts and avocado inside.  At $8.50 this meal was a steal.

Bread is toasted unless otherwise specified.  We waited about 15 minutes.  \n\nThey also offer student lunch special as the local high school is two blocks up.\n\nThe sammies are good size.

Grubbin' on Taraval/24th Avenue, is a place that was hidden off our radar, but now stuck out like Sutro tower on a foggy day. The service was great and the sandwiches are tasty as well. Super fresh bread (we had the dutch crunch and it was perfect) mixed with awesome meat/cheese/sauce combinations that are too many to remember.\nI had the \"Droolin'\", which was pastrami and salami, two of my favorites. That sandwich didn't have a chance and it was down the hatch in no time. My wife had a roast beef and our daughter had a salami sandwich, both of which were tasty as well.\nWe live in the nearby area so Grubbin' is up on our list a slight tick behind Submarine Center, only because Submarine Center are super fast in making the sandwiches. Those guys are an established go to place and it shows. However, I think the parking situation for Grubbin' is easier. At Gubbin' you can take your sandwich and enjoy outside at McCoppin Square on the next block.\nThanks Grubbin', we will definitely we grubbin' again soon!", "author": "Mark M."}

Aside from sandwiches, the restaurant also serves root beer floats and hot dogs--though I haven't tried either of them myself. \n\nThe prices--usually around $7-9 for a sandwich--are a little high considering that you're basically paying for two pieces of bread and some meat, but the portions are generous and you can easily turn one sandwich into two meals.\n\nYou can choose from one of the specials on the menu or build your own out of a sizeable list of ingredients. This isn't Ike's, but you'll be able to make a variety of different sandwiches from the available options. \n\nThe place isn't too big, so if you have a large party with you it might be best to just take your sandwich and go to the park across the street. There's a small selection of drinks and sides, but the sandwiches are really this place's specialty.

They made me and my girlfriend feel completely unwanted in their little sandwich shop and did not put our needs first.  I could tell they thought we were crazy because we didn't want meat, cheese, or their gross sauce.  As a business owner in San Francisco, this attitude only makes you look stupid and hurts your wallet, not ours.  \n\nThe actual sandwich we got was really bad.  The eggplant was bland and had an off taste/texture.  They don't know how to cook, they just throw the stuff you had in a college cafeteria in between some bread and splash sauce on it.  Ugh....

I like it way more than Ikes and Submarine Center. It's different from Little Lucca's because both places have their own distinct signature sauces. \n\nWe had the Grubbin and the Droolin (which I added some peppers). The Droolin was spicy but not so much that it overwhelmed the other flavors. The sandwich was rather big (so the price of $9 ain't too high) and I only ate 3/4 of it. I finished the rest of the sandwich later that night and it was still so good. \n\nHighlights of the sandwiches: \n1. Signature sauces (the different types of aioli and grubbin sauce)\n2.

I ordered a Mouth Watherin' on dutch crunch and it was really tasty. The chicken tenders weren't dry and still maintained a nice breaded texture despite being sauced up in the middle of a sandwich. The veggies tasted fresh and the grubbin' sauce added some nice creamy garlic flavor to the mix. The only critique I had was that it was a little heavy and one note in flavor, but had they added my pepperoncinis I think that would've solved the issue.\n\nI also ordered some Tots which came out great. I asked for a small order, but when I got home and opened the container, it was enough to feed 2 peeps. Also, even being transported to go (which took only a few minutes to my place) they held up really well and were still quite crispy and weren't as greasy as tots you'll find from other restaurants. The cheesy version will be on my list for my next visit.\n\nIt was also pretty cool, that I got a canned soda for free with my sandwich purchase!\n\nI'm definitely looking forward to trying again.

He ended up getting the Juicin and I got the Fishin.  The sandwich itself was pretty good, the fish comes out as a patty and is crispy and hot.  My counterpart also said the juicin was good (although it's hard to mess up a turkey sandwich)  The prices are a little bit up there around $8-9 a sandwich, but they're pretty big and definitely able to save the other half for another time.  Will be back to try out more!", "author": "Roger W."}

Well since i love Ikes i was only encouraged to give Grubbin a try and I'm glad i did! And while there may be some similarities with Ikes  (bread selection, different sauces, creative combinations, etc.) what i loved that was different was the ease of selection (refined menu vs the 100 different sandwiches at Ikes) and very little wait time. I've tried three or four different sandwiches now, all were delicious but my current favorite is the ham and pineapple! Menu prices are reasonable for the city and the sandwiches are a decent size, sometimes making for two meals depending on my appetite. The restaurant interior is plain with a few tables,  prob better for take out. Recommended for any food/sandwich enthusiasts!", "author": "Dylan B."}

However, the sandwiches aren't too big...I'm not exactly sure how long they are, but I would guess maybe a bit longer than 6 inches. Doesn't really matter to me though. The sandwich packs a punch! I checked in so I also got a free small bag of chips which was nice. \n\nThe workers are nice. When I went at about 2:50pm on Wednesday, there was no line. My sandwich was nice and warm and ready to be picked up about 5 minutes later. \n\nCompared to Little Lucca in SSF and Ikes in the Mission district of SF, I would say this sandwich is almost as good--which is really really good. \n\nI will definitely be returning to Grubbin' to try their other sandwiches.", "author": "K T."}

Ew? Seriously girl, go wash your hands. She refused for a good 5 minutes, then her coworkers told her to get a bandaid on. Again, \"I'm wearing gloves! It's ok!\" Let me add that this girl was making MY sandwich. \nI finally get my sandwich and made sure it was blood free but wasn't really hungry after hearing all that.

My family went to the SF Zoo this past weekend and randomly googled a sandwich shop so we could sit at the beach afterwards. We ended up in their GRUBBIN shop. I ordered the Cruncher sandwich, garlic fries, and buffalo wings. ALL OF IT WAS DELICIOUS! I never leave reviews, this is my first and well deserved. The dutch crunch bread was perfect, and their pesto mayo and secret grub sauce made the sandwich orgasmic. My other family members were in awe of their sandwiches as well. I might make a trip back to Frisco just to go there again!", "author": "minnie r."}

(I tried the chinese takeout place down the street once. no good.) I got the 'droolin' and what a masterful concoction of bread, meat and sauce it was. it took a wee bit of time to get it, but when it landed in my hands all warm and toasty, it was totally worth the wait. service is really sweet. parking is no problem. just plan on takeout because it's not really a place to sit and linger.", "author": "Sasha R."}

My girlfriend and I shared the \"Grubin\" on french bread and the \"Juicin\" on dutch crunch bread. I also found the service above average for what you would come to expect from a sandwich shop. If possible you might want to try and wait it til 12:30 on the weekdays, there is a high school around the corner and lots of students go there. It was packed when we passed to park, but as we were walking a swarm of students were heading back from lunch. When we arrived just after 12:30 we had our choice of seating.", "author": "Jeff S."}

I would. but what I wouldn't do is drive across town for it. in a town full of great sandwich shops, this one has made my list. what else can I say about grubbin' except it was grubbin'", "author": "buddy p."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-16", "description": "This place is delicious! Spicy mouth waterin' and Juicin' sandwiches are SO good. Only thing that keeps it from being 5 stars is that the service is sometimes slow- though always friendly! They even stayed open 10 minutes late when I called in an order but couldn't make it there before closing. Highly recommend!", "author": "Daniel L."}
