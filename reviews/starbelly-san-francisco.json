We decided to wait and walked around Castro. I'm so glad that I waited because it was worth the wait! \n\nWe ordered chicken&waffle, starbelly pizza and Prather's ranch skillet breakfast. The portion was more than enough for three ppl. Chicken and waffle was average. I think it's because I prefer crispy waffle but chicken was decent!  BUT their pizza and that skillet breakfast were sooo good! It seemed like every table has at least one of these! Pizza was amazing! Thin crust, generous amount of arugula with kick of jalape\u00f1os! I'd definitely get it next time maybe different flavor because I don't want to miss out! \n\nThe service was outstanding. I accidentally left my to-go box there and one of staff ran outside to get me and hand me the box. That was so nice of them! \n\nOutstanding service, decent food and good vibes! I'd like to come here for dinner next time! Highly recommend it!", "author": "Clare L."}

We wanted something casual and won't break the bank. We ordered several pizzas, entrees, drinks and even got charged for the cake we brought in, and each person from our group of 8 (minus me!) only spent $42 with tip. Whoa,  brunch is the way to go! \n\nFrom eggciting egg dishes, fresh salads, pizza, sandwiches and a few essential sides you can't live without, the brunch offerings satisfied the group. I had a delicious gazpacho style tomato soup and Italian eggs cooked in cast iron skillet with zucchini and peppers served with thick rustic bread. My friends got the chicken and waffles (so good!), challah French toast (sweet breakfast treat), Prather Ranch Burger (hefty!) and chilaquiles with House made chorizo. \n\nWe ordered several pizzas and even if you get the very basic pizza margherita ($12) and add toppings like we did, you still will be in the $17-$18 range. (Screw Zero Zero where our pizza cost $25 for mediocre toppings!) the most interesting flavor combination was the roasted corn, white cheddar, Aleppo chili pizza with lime aioli, it was easily the crowd favorite! The wild mushroom pizza with pickled onions was also good. The pizza crusts are soft and pliable, although thicker than a Neapolitan style one.\n\nThere were some miscommunication when the staff sliced our cake (we didn't want the whole cake sliced, but rather small portions) but they were apologetic for the mistake. Our servers were reliable and took great care of the group. \n\nAs I get \"wiser\" (older? Lol) I tend to shy away from the super big, boisterous birthday parties. Starbelly let me celebrate another year of life with fabulous food and drinks in a neighborhood atmosphere and I couldn't have asked for more.", "author": "Janice C."}

Very delicious and worth trying. \n\nMain dishes: I had their spaghetti which the waitress recommended as a good start when trying out this spot, it had bacon pieces in it with thick noodles (almost like thick chow mein noodles).

I've never had to endure the SF brunch starve here (where you wait so long you're either hangry or not hungry anymore), not even on a Saturday w/o reservation. \n\n~Food~  \nThis time - \nchallah french toast: Oooo yum. I usually get an egg based brunch but the table next to me was chowing down on some french toast and I had to go with my gut. Thick fluffy challah toast with a generous dollop of fromage (which tasted like cream cheese + soft butter), homemade strawberry jam (perfect balance of sour and sweet), and some sprinkles of chopped up pistachios that completed the whole taste.\n\nsunnyside joe's: Food lava served on a mini sizzling pan. It's a combo of ground beef, spinach, cheese, and runny eggs. It's a hot mess so make sure you poke at it with your fork before you take the first bite. I've figured out that dipping the potatoes in it like it's a french onion dip is the best way to go. Another good combo of ingredients but I wish it came with toasted levain instead of potatoes as that would've been great to dip/spread with. \n\nPrevious times - \n2 farmhouse eggs: your standard breakfast plate, good but nothing crazy\ncornmeal crusted fish tacos: already comes with a generous side salad (or you can sub for the starbelly salad for extra $), they're loaded tacos so be ready to get your hands dirty, fish was good and the spicy slaw gave it an extra kick\nStarbelly pizza: the pizza was a little underwhelming. It's a thin crust but it was limp, not crunchy. The arugula kind of just fell off of the pizza when you picked up a slice. Flavor was alright but the texture just really turned me off. \n\n~Price/Quality/Quantity~  \nBrunch price here is on the lower side of the SF brunch scale. I would argue that it's because the portions are also slightly smaller, depending on the plate. For example the loco moco is $11 and it's the smallest plate out of the \"eggs\" section. \n\n~Atmosphere/Service~\nOn the outside, this place is tucked away from Market St with a tiny sign. But once you enter, it's open, airy, and hipster. They have a full bar indoors at the front of the restaurant for all you brunch alcoholics. The back has a covered/greenhouse style patio with seating for large groups. You can get a picnic experience without all the wind, heat, and flies. \n\n~Bottom Line~\nUnderrated brunch, interesting fusions, and perfect for groups.", "author": "Lily L."}

I loved the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant, and really liked the backs outdoor vibe yet fully inside seating area.\n\nI made reservations for 3 just to ensure we got a table, and did so only a few hours in advance. I got the time that I was hoping for. It got pretty busy with many walk-in's (we were near the front so I could easily see and hear), so if and when I go back I will make reservations again. That being said, I think you could be seated with little wait if you did not make a reservation.\n\nI ordered the margarita pizza and added chorizo, and I'm glad I did because it would have been a little underwhelming if I hadn't. The pizza had good flavor and I really liked the basil? which is weird because who says that, but it was memorable. The service was great!

We came on a Monday evening around 7:30 and got seated immediately.\n\nNeither of us were super hungry, so we decided to split an appetizer and pizza. The calamari escabeche ($11) sounded intriguing, so we started with that and then moved onto their chorizo and egg pizza ($16).\n\nI wasn't sure what to expect from the calamari, but I was hoping it'd at least be a hot dish. Unfortunately it wasn't, so it fell flat for me because of that and because it was slightly spicy. I have absolutely zero spice tolerance so it would have been nice to know before ordering. Would probably have ordered something different had I known.\n\nI loved the pizza though! It comes with two very runny eggs cooked sunny side up. It was honestly a little hard to grab the slices due to the yolk, but it was worth it as the half cooked egg just melted it my mouth. There was a generous amount of chorizo that paired well with the tomato sauce and the thin crust.\n\nSome of their pasta looked really good as well.

There were so many things on the menu that I had a hard time deciding what to have.  I didn't pause though on the Strawberry Alarm Clock cocktail.  Mmmmm, that was good!\n\nMy husband went with the loco moco, which I was thinking about.  He then strongly suggested the chicken and waffles, I'm guessing more because he wanted to try it.  I mean, I love chicken and waffles too, but I really needed to change up my brunch game.  I decided on the chilaquiles, which I haven't had in a long time.  Our server was very friendly and when I asked to add an egg, she mistakenly said the chilaquiles came with it.  When my dish came out without it, she was right there to admit that it was her first day and she was still getting used to the menu and being on her own.  No worries, she quickly placed an order for my eggs and it came out quickly to add with my dish.  The chilaquiles was good both with and without the egg and I'd probably make a trip here if I'm ever in the mood for it again.  I only got a small bite of the loco moco, which means it was probably really good since my husband ate it so quickly.\n\nGoing early was great as we got a table right away and didn't have to deal with the brunch crowd that gathered as we were leaving.

If you come during peak brunch hours, I can easily see the wait being upwards of an hour. \n\nI ordered the fried chicken po-boy ($10) along with a michelada ($6) for my meal. The fried chicken po-boy was very well constructed. I often order fried chicken sandwiches when I visit restaurants and one issue I frequently encounter is the sandwich is too dry. The fried chicken itself can be juicy, but without enough slaw and dressing, the sandwich can be pretty tough to eat. The po-boy at Starbelly doesn't have this issue at all. I liked that the sandwich had generous amounts of sliced jalape\u00f1o inside, but I wish they would've left more of the seeds in so the sandwich would have more of a kick.\n\nOverall, pretty good brunch experience.

The food was good, and had great presentation. I'm only a bit turned off by this place because my collegue's fork was spotty, and the person next to me had strand of hair on her plate. In their defense, they did replace those items, but it wasn't enough for me to visit a second time.", "author": "Joel G."}

This place is a 5-star in all it's forms. Their menu has excellent selections with creative items but not doing too much; everything is straight to the point with awesome ingredients. \n\nWe shared everything like family style. We started off with house cut fries & three dips and house-made chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 with buttered toast. It also came with sweet onion marmalade and grainy mustard which provided a nice kick. \n\nFor our main course, we shared two pizzas and a pasta. The pizzas are on point! They're cooked by brick-oven style with a nice flat crust. We had a pizza topped with Starbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, arugula,and special green dressing which was out of this world. This pizza was fresh and full of flavors. The bacon was cooked to perfection and provided a nice salty bite to it. Our second pizza was topped with house-made chorizo, sunny eggs and cilantro. The egg yolk provided some texture while the chorizo was flavorful and had the right amount of saltiness. Their pizzas here are very creative and a must-get! \n\nOur service was great! The food is cooked form scratch but is delivered to your table on time! The ambiance is great too with dim lighting and an outside seating area for a more lively vibe. Their cocktails are of course unique with different mixes. My favorite was their Starbelly 75 which had Dolin Dry, Lillet Blanc, ginger, cava, and lemon. My cocktail was a bit carbonated which was nice! It wasn't heavy nor was it dull. It had the taste of punch soda but had that cocktail form and taste! It was simply amazing.\n\nIf you're in SF and looking for a spot to eat for dinner, you should include this onto your list. You can't go wrong here.", "author": "Allister D."}

With that being said, I recall my impressionable dining experience at Starbelly! The inside was very hip and gave off a great ambiance -- warm and welcoming. I felt \"cool\" while eating there, even though cool is subjective. Anyway, the restaurant was packed, so we decided to sit at the community table, which was a new adventure for us. Chloe was our server, who was pleasant. Though small, the menu offered a nice variety. We weren't very hungry, so our order was easy -- Allagash beer, veggie burger with a side of bacon, and warm bread with olive oil as a starter. The prices were moderate and the food quality was fabulous -- very fresh and tasty. Excluding tip, the bill was under $32.00.

One of them suggested Starbelly saying that it was his regular late afternoon lunch spot.  I didn't argue and we meandered to restaurant.  My concern was that it would be packed and we'd have a long wait.  Fortunately, it wasn't and we were sat immediately.  After a quick review of the menu I asked what type of cuisine it was, and buddy said new American.  I don't get out much as I used to but I had not heard of that.  It was good though.\n\nI ordered the fried chicken Po Boy sandwich with french fries.  Basically, it's a fried chicken breast with a jalapeno & radicchio slaw.  Man, it was good.  The chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.  The addition of jalapenos was a surprise, but brilliant with the slaw.  Wow, really awesome.  The shoestring fries were delicious and plentiful.  Sometimes restaurants drop the ball on the fries, but Starbelly scores.  For me, thick-cut fries would not have paired well with the Po Boy.  \n\nThis was a place I would not have chosen, and thankfully my buddy made the call.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-16", "description": "To echo the comment below (by my husband), our last experience at Starbelly was extremely disappointing as I've been dining there regularly since the day it opened.  Us freezing our butts off in the outdoor area despite the fact the inside seats were empty is one thing....but the quality of the food has been declining for a while and that night in particular was shocking. When it first opened, Starbelly was fresh, innovative and ahead of its time.  Now the F&B scene has finally caught up with Starbelly in concept, menu, atmosphere, decor and Starbelly itself...has remained the same.  Remaining a pioneer of its kind and staying true to its original concept would be fine if the food quality and the service had at least stayed the same, but I'm sorry to say that this is not the case.  \n\nTo be fair, we were there for a light dinner and only ordered our four go-to-dishes, but all of them were disappointing.  Having just been let down by the hostess and waiter for not being able to change our reservation to one of the MANY empty tables inside, and only being offered a glass of warm water to \"warm us up\", we did not send anything back as...  1) We were freezing and just wanted to get our food and go. 2) We didn't want to raise more fuss, drawing attention to ourselves.  \n\nFor starters, the fries were cold.  They were just cold and kind of dry.  They had the textures of frozen fries which had been cooked and then forgotten about for the day.  We then had the white bean puree with flatbread.  The portion of beans was tiny and it tasted like it was literally just that.....just pureed beans.  This dish used to be so flavorful....we couldn't believe how bland it was.  We also only got 2 pieces of flatbread, which was more like stale thin bread.  They were very small and again, we only got 2.  We were looking forward to our (sauteed?) kale and pizza as we were still so hungry.  The kale came it was basically limp sauteed with salt and possibly lemon juice.  It was also very bland.  Also, only room temperature. The chorizo and sunny side egg pizza was probably the most disappointing.  It was not crispy, it was limp, doughy and watery.  This moisture was not caused by the runny egg.  The wateriness was caused by the pizza not being thoroughly cooked and the tomato sauce being too thin..  The toppings literally slid off the crust which was more like a limp \"appendage\".  I'll attach a pic after writing this. And once again, it was room temperature. On top of all of this, Starbelly is not cheap.  The prices aren't $$$ but for what you are getting these days, it is certainly overpriced...\n\nAll the while, we were watching the waitstaff and they all seemed flustered, rushed and irritated by something.  Our actual waiter didn't actually check on us once.  The gentleman who brought us our food asked once and we said everything was \"ok\"...it wasn't HIS fault and we just wanted to get out of there without making a fuss. The waitstaff, although they were \"nice\" enough, seemed very \"young\" and inexperienced.\n\nWe left feeling very unsatisfied, cold, feeling like we had wasted our money.... and also kind of sad.  I've always very highly recommended this place to many people.  Especially as the Castro is going through such a controversial change with its new businesses, restaurants and new demographics.  I've always championed Starbelly as being one of those Castro survivors...where you know exactly what you are getting food, service and ambiance-wise.  Again, I've seen a steady decline in their quality and the experience.  The F&B industry is VERY over-saturated these days and I feel in order to keep up and stand out, older restaurants at least need to maintain their original level of quality to justify keeping their return customers.  I really hope they find some kind of solution to the very \"tired\"-feeling experience we had that night.  Until that happens, I'm afraid we probably won't be back.", "author": "Adrian C."}

The burrata melted away in your mouth giving way to the tangy sun-dried tomatoes. It was a delicious combination.\n\nStarbelly Bacon Pizza: Standard San Francisco Gourmet Pizza. Similar to Delfina's style. It was definitely worth ordering.\n\nStarbelly Spaghetti: This is one of my favorite dishes in San Francisco. It's extremely simple and light, but packs a wonderful symphony of flavors. The tomato-based sauce is tangy while the jalapenos pack a nice punch. It brings a bit of uniqueness to the dish as you don't traditionally find jalapenos in a spaghetti dish.\nThe Bacon. Oh the Bacon. Marinated in cliantro and lime, it bursts in your mouth with an explosion of vibrancy and juiciness. It's a great fatty contrast to the acidity in the sauce. The two complement each other really well. One of the best spaghettis in the city for sure. Definitely worth a try.\n\nFull disclosure, I was disappointed with the dish last time I went to Starbelly. The bacon was largely cut and a bit chewy. Seemed like a different preparation of it. The dish was still good though.\n\nSalted Caramel Pot de Creme: Easily in my top favorite desserts in the city. I simply love the large salt crystals over a rich and delicious pot de creme. What really brings the dish together for me is the ginger biscuit it's served with.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-15", "description": "An interesting thing happens when people ask for restaurant recommendations in the Castro:  They're steered away from Castro Street itself and you can see them pointing back down the street with a questioning look on their face saying \"nothing in that direction?\"  \n\nNothing in that direction.  \n\nStarbelly fills a void in the 'hood that's seemingly missing from Castro Street itself.  Brunch, lunch, and dinner are served 7-days per week (though not round-the-clock) in an upscale, \"now\" environment.  Think light wood furnishings, a menu written entirely in lower case font, and plates featuring Prather Ranch burgers, Little Gem salads, dishes with added aged-cheddar, and house-pickled jalape\u00f1os.  The fact that you recognize this menu as being from the time we live in is what distinguishes it from some other open-all day places directly on Castro.  \n\nAt any time I'd say the place to dine here is the back patio.  In fact, for a recent weekday lunch I walked through an essentially empty restaurant to reach that attractive (and packed) al fresco spot.  On a beautiful day, everything will look better from here.  \n\nMy waiter approached with big, full bottles of still and sparkling water and my table opted for both.  I was relieved to learn that there was no upsell here.  Even sparkling water, which they apparently carbonate themselves on-site, was provided free of charge. \n\nMy salad (Bibb lettuce, grilled chicken, bacon, cherry tomatoes, & green goddess dressing, $13) was presented beautifully and was well-priced for a filling lunchtime meal in such an attractive setting.  Could the salad have benefited from crispier bacon and more ample and flavorful dressing?  It could have, but the fact that it didn't wasn't a dealbreaker.\n\nI think that Starbelly is a great (though far from recent) addition to the neighborhood: Good food, reasonable pricing, free and ample sparkling water.  When people ask, I will happily and confidently point them away from Castro Street and towards Starbelly's patio for an enjoyable experience.", "author": "Tracey A."}

Both of us were starving and were really happy that we got in without a wait. We did have to sit outside, but they have heaters so even in the misty San Francisco morning, we were not freezing. The inside space looked really cute so hopefully we can sit there next time.\n\nNow for the food. The one thing we noticed is that there were very few non-meat items on their brunch menu which, for my friend who doesn't eat red meat, left her with only 2 real options. I was really craving a salad but Starbelly's 3 salad options seemed very plain and not worth the money. We both ended up ordering the Italian Eggs ($14) and my friend had the Lavender Lemonade ($4). It took about 20 minutes for us to get our food, which was fine but if we had waited much longer, I think we would have started to eat the table. \n\nThe eggs were really good. They were served on top of a marinara sauce with zucchini and 2 pieces of toasted bread. The portion was the right amount of food-not too big and not too small. We both really enjoyed it and would order it again. My friend also enjoyed her lemonade. With tax and tip, the meal came out to ~$40 which is a little high but still doable. Overall, I would come back but I cannot say I would rave about this meal to anyone.", "author": "Carrie W."}

I was pretty hesitant to sit outside since it was cloudy and rainy day but there was enough heaters to keep the place warm. Plus, the noise level was not issue and it wasn't too loud.\n\nCustomer service:  We waited about 15 min to sit at our table even though the hostess quoted about 45 minutes. The waitress didn't have that much of a light-hearted spirit but rather was there just to take our order and leave. She didn't really check back on us every now and then. So when we needed her for something it took, like what felt like 10 minutes, to flag her down. Our beer and sangria came after our actual meals arrived. \n\nFood: We had the fries and trio dip (2 special sauces and just plain ketchup) the fries were well cooked and crispy. The actual cut of the fries were short and small.  I definitely got my fingers wet. The special sauces were really delicious though. I ordered the chilaquiles for my entree which wasn't bad. I had a side of runny eggs over it which was worth with the extra $5. My boyfriend has the mushroom, onion, gruyere cheese pizza. Good large portion. It was a pretty tasty pizza. I'm not sure if it's the cheese or the actual pizza but it tasted a little salty for me but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The sangria was on the stronger side and you can definitely taste the alcohol than the sweetness. I definitely wouldn't mind coming back to try the dinner menu.", "author": "Carleen C."}

Service is fast and friendly, and in this case my party of eight had a really great time even when we not so gracefully spilled mimosa all over the place (sorry). Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nI'll admit I was a tad bit nervous upon sitting down that I'd be forking over $20+ for each entree, but my nerves were appeased when my Starbelly Bacon Pizza pictured below, which was quite substantial (enough for two) came to only $16.00. Other dishes were priced accordingly, and all in all there was good value all around. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nFirst and foremost: if you don't know, now you know that Arugula is the new Kale, and my Bacon (thick cut) and arugula pizza was very, very good. While initially a tad bit put off at the sheer quantity of arugula in the mix (take a look at the pic), whatever sauce was on this beezy turned it into a straight masterpiece, and the crunch of the bacon, the slight crunch of the arugula, and the softer crust and jalapenos for a kick came together in a great way. \n\nMy smoked chicken and mushroom chowder was a bit less impressive (it all came across as being very segmented as opposed to a cohesive chowder, and the chicken didn't have much flavor), but all in all everyone in my group left happy and full. Single Star Granted. \n\nStar 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nAgain, Starbelly isn't what I would necessarily call elite in San Francisco, but it's so varied and consistently good that I honestly could come here daily.

A three course lunch for only $15!! What a steal! \n\nI didn't realize this restaurant was only a block away from Ike's and kitchen story, so I never noticed it before. It didn't look too fancy from the outside, but once you walk in you notice that there's an outside in the inside! What I mean to say is that as you walk towards the back of the restaurant, they have this greenhouse part to the restaurant. I definitely recommend sitting outside. The design of the exterior made you feel just at home. It definitely gave off a comfortable feeling.\n\nThe water came in cool wine bottles. The first dish I had was the chicken liver pate. It was different from what I had expected and experienced as chicken liver before. However, it was paired very well with grain mustard. Next, was the chicken po'boy. The veggies were a bit more bitter than expected but the fried chicken was very good. Last, of course, was their famous salted caramel pot de creme. I didn't know what I was expecting but this definitely exceeded my expectations. It is basically a salted caramel flavored creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e paired with a ginger snap cookie. I'm not a big fan of ginger but it helped with the sweetness of the pot de creme.

Probably the second best thing I had that night. Flavor was great and the flatbread was fresh and fluffy, highly recommend this dish!\nNext we ate burrata di Stefano. The dish was not what I expected but none the less it was great! Also recommend this dish.\nLast on our appetizers was the complementary chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9. It was free so no complaints here! Not sure if I would order it normally but my gf really enjoyed it.\n\nFor our entrees we decided to go with 2 pizzas!\nStarbelly Pizza no question you HAVE to get this if you come here or you did yourself a disservice. Ton of bacon, covered in arugula, spice of the jalape\u00f1o all topped off by the tasty dressing, favorite part of my meal.\nMarket mushroom pizza, cannot say this is something I would get again. It had such a bold butter flavor that was hard for me to get past. Very salty as well. Not sure if it was strange going back and forth from starbelly pizza to this but I had one slice and did not want anymore of it unfortunately. Reheated it at home the next day and still unfortunately didn't do it for me even being a huge mushroom fan.\n\nOverall I would recommend it! Other than some seating mishaps and the mushroom pizza I had a pleasant evening and went home full and happy, can't ask for more.", "author": "Josue V."}

To me, San Francisco is not only liberal, but also a judgement free zone , a place where you can find amazing and unique types of cuisine, and a place where you can experience winter during the summertime . \n\nOne of my favorite places would have to be star belly . Sure, it can easily be mistaken for a place only hipsters would go to but, trust me! The food will distract you and put you in a daze . \n\nThe first time I had it was when we got into town pretty late and my cousin wanted to take us out for a late dinner.  She raved about how she and her gfs often go there during lunch breaks and how the docs way burger was featured on a food network show . Mm burgers always sound like a good idea ! \n\nWe arrived around 10 P.M. with no sight of a packed restaurant . That's always a good sign, imo. We got seated right away, and were given sparkling waters upon request . Believe it or not, sparkling water really clears the palette better than regular agua :) after seeing their drink menu , I was really intrigued by their lavender lemonade . I don't think I could ever get tired of lavender . It's in my diffuser at home , it puts me in a relaxed mood, and thanks to Starbelly it's one of my favorite drinks ! We all shared a kale Caesar and bacon pizza to start . The reason why it took me so long to review this place is because I was in food heaven this whole time and just recently came back . Sorry, guys ! \n\nLet me just say that you can never go wrong with the menu items that contain \" bacon jalape\u00f1o \" here at Starbelly . The pizza contains a tasty red sauce , bacon , cheese, and fresh arugula sprinkled on top . A for presentation and a plus for the taste . All of that yummy stuff sat on a thin cracker crust which allows you to soak up all the great flavors of the toppings instead of getting too overwhelmed if it were to have a thick doughy crust . They definitely compliment each other like colors ;) The kale Caesar wasn't too heavy as they were pretty easy on the dressing and cheese . Their dressing is made in house and they use Dino kale ! Pretty fresh and vibrant . My boyfriend ordered the docs way burger and it did not disappoint whatsoever ! I was able to take a bite and understand why it was featured on television. The duck pate on the burger is out of this world ! MUST. TRY.!  \n\nReview PT 2: \n\nJust last night , my friends from the city wanted to catch up and have a celebratory dinner for my friend and I. ( it was my friends one year post brain surgery anniversary and my 3 week post surgery anniversary ) it was my turn to choose where to eat so, I chose star belly ! Making a reservation for 7 was quick and easy . We immediately got seated and Annie, our server took our drink orders right away . After raving about their lavender lemonade, my girls decided to order it that night .\n\nSince my picky little cousins joined us too, we ordered the house cut fries appetizer for them, and a customized pizza . Something very close to a pepperoni pizza, please ! No problem at all, they were able to do it :) My boyfriend and I were still very full from off the grid so we ended up sharing a kale Caesar and bacon jalape\u00f1o spaghetti . According to Rodney H, their spaghetti is famous lol . Those spaghetti noodles were cooked to al dente perfection ! That dish is tdf! Oh so warm and comforting ! I was in all \" mmmmmms.\" That night . My friend ordered it too and had the same feelings about it . \n\nAfter inhaling all our delicious meals, we had a sweet tooth and decided on ordering three types of dessert to share . We opted for : warm toffee cake, a scoop of the secret breakfast ice cream, and the rice pudding . The toffee cake won my heart that night . As my friends said \" it was an orgasmic virginal experience \" whoops! Inappropriate! Lol the secret breakfast was divine ! I'd have it for breakfast every morning if I could . The rice pudding was rich, creamy, and tart from the cherries . It was a very comforting dish . We ended up all leaving with smiles on our faces and parties in our tummys. Thanks for the night to remember , belly of a star !", "author": "Monica C."}

First of all I'll be honest, I give this place a 3.8 stars.  But I just can't believe that the other places nearby are getting, 4 or 4.5 stars making it look like this is one of the worst food options in the area so bumping up to 5 to balance things out (are all these Yelpers crazy?! What-- castro republic, kitchen story, phinn town, la mediteranee, amasia, sushi time all has better food?! I thinks NOT).  It has better decor than all of these, a lovely covered/heated patio, and better service than most.\n\nI don't think of this as \"brunch\" spot even if they do it on weekends, as their egg and griddle options aren't extensive, but they do a solid burger, fried chicken sando, and of course their pizzas (my favorite is their bacon, jalepeno,arugula with green goddess dressing). They make their bacon and sausage in house and I personally like their take on sphagetti with bacon and jalepeno over home made noodles. Other favorites are the chicken peas fritters with a sort of cumin infused yogurt dipping sauce (5 year old daughters favorite), mussels with chorizo, and their roasted chicken when they have it.  They rotate in and out enough new dishes and there is enough variety of options to keep most groups happy, even after repeat visits.  \n\nSo stop hating on my neighborhood spot, come by give it a try... and maybe don't order the loco-moco (seriously, who orders this here expecting it to be out of this world !? get yourself to a proper hawaiin joint-- aina or huli-huli).", "author": "Robert K."}

I was in hopes of getting pork belly at Starbelly and my enthusiasm waned when she cheerfully said, \"They got great salads there!\"  For me, that's the kiss of death.  Just say the words, \"Great salad.\"  (My idea of a great salad is a rare 16 oz. beef steak with a parsley garnish.)\n\nFirst I wanted their Starbelly pizza... but No!  They have hamburgers with Marin County blue cheese!  Ohhhh!  I so love blue cheese slathered on my burgers.  Then I picked up a pro tip from Tracey:\n\nThe waiter came to the table to take our orders and I was ready to blurt out, \"Blue cheese with the hamburger!!!\" - when Tracey flashes her trademark smile and says, \"What things on the menu do you enjoy best?\"\n\nWow!  What a simple way to cut to the chase!\n\n\"I like the Starbelly Pizza, Chicken & waffles and....\" - my brain had an overload.   Electronic signals from my ears raced to my stomach and back to my brain.  A massive desire for chicken and waffles exploded in that section of the brain that drives motor skills!\n\nI never had chicken and waffles before, but after seeing a photo of the chicken and waffles my daughter-in-law ate, it's been a priority for me.  I was not disappointed.  The buttermilk crust on the chicken breasts slipped in between the perfectly cooked waffles and the maple syrup were heavenly.  I loved seeing the juice in those pieces of chicken as I sliced them with my knife and tasting the waffle, maple syrup and chicken war against each other in my mouth to make a case for \"I'm better!\".  For this case, 1+1+1 =  10!  If you have not had chicken and waffles, you must put this on your list.\n\nStarbelly is very popular.  We had to wait 45 minutes for a table.  It was a good crowd there.  Someone had a birthday and his friends sang \"Happy Birthday\" to him in such trained harmony they could have been the Gay Men's Chorus.  It seemed so appropriate to hear perfect singing with such delicious food.\n\nOur table was in the front and it was noisy and crowded.

I think it is located near or in the Castro (don't hate the visitor....lol). \n\nOur party was immediately seated upon entering.  We were seated in the entrance area.  There appears to be a larger seating area in the back which looks good for larger groups (I.e more than 6 individuals). \n\nThe brunch menu to me looked a little small for choices to choose from.  However, they did have fried chicken and waffles and a Hawaiian loco moco.  My LA side wanted me to order the fried chicken and waffles.  My Hawaiian side wanted me to order the loco moco.   Was a tough choice.   I ended up ordering the loco moco.   For those who have not had a loco moco before, it is a beef patty with egg and gravy over rice.  In Hawaii, it is a big dish.   Starfish's version was not.   The loco moco had all the elements to make it except it was only with one scoop rice and one egg.  I am accustom to 2 scoops rice and 2 eggs which is the norm in Hawaii.   Thus, my expectations got the best of me.  \n\nThe beef patty was cooked well as I ordered it and my egg was sunny side up.   It was good, but it can't beat the original from Hawaii.    \n\nI was chatting to the lady next to me and she ordered the chicken and waffles.   She said it was good.  It consisted of deep friend lightly breaded chicken breasts served with 2 waffles.   It looked good and I wanted to take a pic of it but felt awkward since it would be disturbing her while she was eating. \n\nThe service here is good.   I will give them credit for customer service as one of our parties order did not arrive with the rest of the orders and came out late.  They comped their mistake.   \n\nThe drinks looked good here.", "author": "Dean N."}

Keep in mind that many of the plates are relatively small so you are going to want to get more than the 2-3 plates you usually get if you want to fill yourself up. \n\nTo start, I got the split pea fritters, which were amazing. I am not a huge fan of peas but the crunchiness of the fritter and the cool yogurt were a good compliment. After the snack portion, we got the pumpkin dumplings which were amazing, especially the pumpkin seeds. Once again, I wish there was another piece because it was really good, but to split between two people you just wish you had one more bite to enjoy. For our main course we split the cornmeal gnocchi, which in my opinion was the worst of the dishes I tasted. It was a tad undercooked but still somewhat flavorful, but no where near the deliciousness of the appetizers we had. I regret not taking a picture of the menu because I can't seem to find the dessert menu on the website, but I got the cookies with the caramel in the jar. The name is escaping me, but I thought it was scrumptious. My partner on the other was not a fan, and gave me the cookies to nibble on for myself. \n\nHowever, the best part of the meal were the drinks. Although my Starbelly was good, I don't think there is a better bang for your buck drink than the Michelada. I have a sweet spot for garam masala, and when mixed with alcohol it just gives it a great pop. Don't go in expecting the most delicious beer in the world (Just a Modelo), but the spices give it the extra kick. \n\nI really enjoyed this place and think it is a great date restaurant with a neighborhood vibe. Unfortunately a friend who came after us told us that the best thing she had was one of their flat breads which we didn't try.

Despite it being the end of May, it was still freezing outside (thanks SF), so we sat indoors.\n\nWe began with a round of drinks.  I tried the Pimm's cup, which was light, refreshing, and extremely easy to drink.  \n\nThe cocktails were a perfect accompaniment for the first course -- chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 with buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade, and whole grain mustard.  The chicken liver was fabulous and took me back to when I was a little kid and the stuff on the reg.  The onion marmalade made is seem modern.  The serving was quite generous too.\n\nWe followed this up with roasted mushroom and onion pizza.  Honestly, I wasn't a fan of this pizza.  The flavor was definitely there, but the crust was was a bit hard, and the mushrooms seemed undercooked and greasy.

Several of us were going to get dinner together and we were a party of seven.  It was chilly that day and we were seated in the very back in the tented area.  Fortunately, there were blaring heat lamps that made it very warm and comfy.  I even had to take off several layers.  This restaurant is a little cramped, but by extending it using the bungalow-type arrangement, it increases space by a ton. It has a cute, classy, yet organic pub feel - very SF. \n\nI ordered the Timberline to start and it was delicious and topped with rosemary.  Because I had eaten a late lunch, I decided to order the mussels.  Though it's an appetizer, it's pretty large (but still smaller than a main entr\u00e9e). It is pan fried and cooked with chorizo, which flavored the dish oh so well.  It was the perfect amount for me.  I also tried some of Boyfriends steak.  It was so soft and delicious.  Definitely would recommend (though it's a little pricy).  The pizza that some others had gotten was large, but had a very thin crust (think pieology thin). \n\nDon't have any complains really.

The broccoli was a little too spicy for my taste, but everything else was delicious, especially the pizza. We added Starbelly bacon to it which I definitely recommend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-03-21", "description": "Starbelly is a go-to brunch spot for me - but decent / consistent food in a pretty space is only worth about 3-4 stars in my book.\n\nThere's just nothing on this menu I love.  I know that it won't offend anyone and I can count on the food being very consistent every time I come...but there's nothing I crave here.\n\nThe greek yogurt parfait is good but VERY easy to make at home for MUCH less.  They use the cheapest fruit - most of which makes no sense in greek yogurt / yogurt parfait.  Huge chunks of pineapple and orange?  Then also green and purple grapes?  AND blueberries and strawberries?  I much prefer some kind of logical fruit \"theme\" or creative fruit toppings - like a homemade compote or chutney, for example.\n\nThe pizzas are all totally good and fine.  The chicken and waffles is WAY massive and, again, fine - but not revelatory.  Their cocktails are OK but not memorable.  The coffee is very average.\n\nService is usually pretty scatterbrained and harried.  You usually have to ask for the same thing repeatedly, but at least everyone is friendly.\n\nAgain, this is a place I'll keep coming to periodically, but not because I'm trying to wow myself or show off San Francisco's culinary scene to anyone.", "author": "Tay H."}

The server paid almost no attention to our table and only at times that it benefitted her. When the table declined any alcoholic drinks, she made a scowl and visibly showed us she was unhappy. She came by a second time asking for drink orders and again no one ordered. We were ready to order our food, and our server was nowhere to be found. I finally had to flag down another server, who was very surprised when I mentioned we had been sitting for about 15 minutes and our server hadn't been by to take food orders. We got an assortment for the table, and I ended up splitting the chicken and waffles and the goddess dressing pizza.\n\nThroughout our wait, I couldn't help but notice our original server shooting menacing looks at our table. I swear I wasn't imagining things; I even felt too intimidated to ask for a water refill. The other server that helped us was much nicer, and I was so happy when she came by to serve our food.\n\nPresentation was spot on. Our pizza was beautiful, perfectly dressed and with great color. I thought the flavors could've been a bit stronger; the bacon barely came through. Our chicken and waffles was definitely the superstar. The chicken was crispy, not crunchy, and because it was very moist, paired really well with the waffles. The syrup was also applied lightly, allowing the maple flavor and moisture to seep in without making it too sweet.\n\nIf I had to wait for the table, I definitely would've had worse things to say. The fact that the food was decent and we were seated quickly made up (not fully) for the service.", "author": "Ben W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-12", "description": "People are often extra critical of 3.5 Yelp rated restaurants on Yelp. To be honest, I have alot of favorite 3.5 star rated restaurants; I also dislike alot of 4-5 star restaurants and think they're overrated.\n\nBottom line: 3.5 STARS for Starbelly - they have some good eats and are reasonably priced! I would definitely return for a few items and recommend you give it a shot yourself. They have a nice heated outdoor patio which I imagine is perfect for brunch. Reservations are easy online, and it's good for big groups. I have walked by on weekend mornings and noticed there was no line either.\n\nAs for the food, there were highlights and low lights at Starbelly, and overall I think that the value and taste it was really good. \n\n* TIMBERLINE ($7) - 3.5 STARS:\nWell, I admit I'm a cocktail snob. This one was pretty, and tasted nice with a strong rosemary note, but wasn't as tasty as a few of my other favorite restaurant cocktail bars. Namely: Beretta, Locanda, Range. In the Castro however, I haven't found a good restaurant cocktail bar yet. What a steal though - only $7 - unheard of prices!\n\n* PATE ($12) - 4 STARS:\nhouse made chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade & grain mustard\nThis pate is done right. It's a little harder and more crumbly than some but served as a thick slice and with a few pieces of toasted sliced bread.\n\n* MUSSELS ($12) - 3 STARS:\npan roasted black mussels, Mexican chorizo, market chili & cilantro\nThis is a small bowl of very tiny mussels. The broth was uninspiring.\n\n* BURRATA ($9) - 4 STARS:\nburrata di stefano, blistered cherry tomato & basil puree\nI love burrata and this was no exception. \n\n* Side of: CAULIFLOWER ($6) - 3 STARS:\nmarinated mixed cauliflower, chili flakes, shaved red onion & chives\nTasted very vinegary, but fresh, simple, and homemade. A somewhat small portion and not unique so I would not order again.\n\n* BAVETTE STEAK ($25) - 3.5 STARS:\nVery nicely cooked (requested medium rare, but the chef recommends medium), tender and flavorful. The sauce/marinade was not my cup of tea.\n\n* CRAB GARLIC NOODLES ($21) - 4 STARS:\nlocal Dungeness crab, garlic noodle & garlic bread\nReally decadent and rich crab sauce with a fresh made doughy noodle. Really delicious and filling.\n\n* SEA SALT POT DE CREME ($8) - 4 STARS:\nA decent portion of creamy luscious sea salt pot de creme, served with 2 rosemary shortbread cookies. I was not a huge fan of the cookies, they were thin and crumbly and didn't have enough butter, but I really enjoyed the pot de creme. It was smooth and not especially thick, yet still very creamy.", "author": "Jess C."}

The leftovers were salvaged by adding a little Cholula, and a lot more goat cheese.  The Starbelly pizza was much better, but still not amazing.\n\nThey serve wine and beer, so all their cocktails are made with vermouth.  I had a spicy/sweet vermouth cocktail that was pretty interesting.  That part is creative, making cocktails without a liquor license.", "author": "Kelly E."}

Also the Greek pizza they have with Arugula and Bacon!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-03-27", "description": "I've eaten at Starbelly a few times and always feels like it's a pleasant surprise since I often forget  it's here because of the way it's located on 16th and Castro. As a venue, it's a great location on a sunny day with  it's back section as well as few front tables. Inside you have tables of two's and fours as well as a community table down the center line. The food is an eclectic mix of retro, hipster, queer, tourist, hetero, gal-pal/gay-boy, lesbian chic chaos and the food is  reflective of the of Community mix. \n\nOn this sunny Saturday in early spring we did our own retro mix with fried chicken and waffles and a creamy salad with chicken & bacon. \n\nFor me the quality of a restaurant is in how the fried food tastes.  Is the oil fresh? Am I tasting fish fry products not meant to be on my meat etc. Starbelly really knocked hard on this by producing a dish that offered a crisp hard bite with hot and steamy chicken inside. They totally nailed it on Saturday.  Also offered a nice presentation with Napoleon style layering of waffle, chicken, waffle, chicken. Another dish was a creamy salad with chicken and bacon well good and crispy chicken rice and flavored bacon of course was great the dressing was creamy but a little bit bland I would have liked some more herbs or punch to it or maybe a bite of lemon in the dressing something that just woke it up some. \nOverall it's a great place if you haven't tried it,  it's definitely worth a try. It can get busy on the weekends, but you can score a table if you go little bit later on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 to 2 seems to be a natural quiet time which is a good idea because indoors it can be a little loud and chaotic when it's at full capacity.", "author": "Frank S."}

The food is great, the staff is nice, and the atmosphere is perfect. \nFor brunch, I highly recommend trying the chicken & waffles.\nFor dinner, splitting a bunch of small plates always seems to be the way my friends and I like to do it. Last night, we ordered two orders of the pork belly, the chef's cheese and meat pairings, a tomato basil pizza, and two orders of the pumpkin dumplings. Everything was spectacular and it was the right amount of food for the evening. \n\nIf only they served liquor, this would be my go-to place every night!

From their food, to their staff, their chef/owner and vibe.. everything and everyone is GREAT! We had our intimate reception here after our wedding on 10/18/17. Former manager Tessa has been so welcoming the first day we did our food tasting that we just fell in love with the place, people, and food right away! Shannon, the manager that took over, has been just as amazing if not more! They have been so helpful with the meetings prior to the big day when it came to food selections and getting to try them, drink selections and getting to try A LOT of them, table arrangements and decor, menus, program/time. Shannon was just the best in coordinating everything for our reception. Their staff helped with putting up/setting up decorations that we provided. They even made it work to fit a sweetheart table for us! They always made time for us and eased our worries by telling us their plans/suggestions and executing them flawlessly on our big day! I also heard our cake from a diff vendor arrived bare and undecorated and owner/chef Adam decorated it with beautiful flowers from the florist nearby! He made that cake beautiful!! The food was amazing, everyone loved the picnic style and the fact that the food was actually great!! We had people visit from the East Coast so being in Castro was a nice and new experience for them as well. They are also able to serve food for people with special/strict dietary needs! The staff was always available, we (newly weds) and our guests felt so special and taken care of! Oh also when we went back a different day to have dinner, Chris (asst. manager?) remembered us and again, made us feel so special with a round of champagne. I have nothing but great things to say about Starbelly. It's our favorite place to take people to. WE LOVE YOU, STARBELLY! Thank you for making our big day EXTRA special!", "author": "JOANNIE A."}

The host was extremely friendly and personable as well. We decided to dine on the patio, temps were in the low 70s so we couldn't skip an al fresco opp on a beautiful day like that! \n\nStarting with the food, we ordered a pizza and sandwich to share. We opted for the fried chicken po'boy and starbelly bacon pizza. Both were DELICIOUS. The goddess dressing on that pizza really set it off for us. The arugula was a bit overpowering so we took a little off the top, but it didn't detract from the taste at all. The po'boy was excellent all around, no complaints!\n\nWe had three rounds of drinks, starting with the white sangria, then to the pimm's cup, and lastly the sunset in seville. All were great except the sangria, it was really watered down for me. My favorite was definitely the pimm's cup, yummy! My friend loved the sunset in Seville. \n\nOverall, our experience at starbelly was amazing. My friend works at a sister restaurant and she would constantly tell me to get over to upper market and give this place a try, so glad I finally did.

We had a reservation, but i imagine this place can get busy during weekends. It's not super big, but there is a cute outdoor area at the back of the restaurant with additional tables. \n\nWe ordered a ton of food and wine to share. In retrospect, I don't think it was that great of an idea to share, but we didn't know how the portions looked beforehand. The pizzas were good for sharing, but that was pretty much it. We ordered two orders of the pumpkin dumplings (definitely not enough for eight people), an order of the mussels (I didn't get to try any), several pizzas (I think around five or six), the brussels sprouts as a side, and a lot of wine (four or five bottles...which is a lot for eight people now that I think about it). \n\nFood that stood out: butternut squash pizza with goat cheese and pumpkin seeds and the brussels sprouts because of the balsamic honey. \n\nThe dessert was great: salted caramel pot de creme with rosemary cornmeal cookies. It was for my friend's birthday dessert, but I had a bite and it was so good. I think this might've been my favorite part of the meal...\n\nOverall, I thought the food was good, but nothing amazing. I think I came here again, I would get an entree that isn't a pizza. We got the pizzas since we figured it was the easiest thing to share among eight people. Good wine selection - I expect the drink menu to be extensive since I saw a pretty nicely stocked bar. I would give this place another chance, but I don't think I would voluntarily go back here right away since there are so many other great places to eat in this lovely city.", "author": "Steph V."}

I mean who wouldn't want to come in just for the namesake? Scratch my \"Starbelly\" why don't ya!\n\nOur dear friend from Chile was visiting that weekend who had quite an expansive palate, I learned. He had two requirements (1) it had to be in Castro and (2) it had be really good food! The only place in Castro or near off that I could think off that was decent (1) Bisou - French, and (2) Destino, Latin American!!  Neither was a hit so thank you Starbelly for saving the day!! \n\nOnce inside, the ambience is trendy and cozy.  The metallic tables and barn like feel reminded me of my visits to Wisconsin - where I got lost driving and all I could see were pasteur of forever greens and barns galore!\n\nAs for their dishes, do try the following:\n\n-- (1) white bean puree, black olive tapenade & grilled flatbread.  It will fill your tummy real good but enough so you can continue on.  The white bean was light and not pasty.\n\n-- (2) house made pumpkin dumplings, brown butter, sage, pumpkin seeds & shaved goat cheese. OMG - you must absolutely try this and order at least three!!!  One serving is not enough for three grown men!  Well, at least with us.  We like to pig out without the mess! \n\n-- (3) fresh spaghetti, starbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, tomato sauce & basil.  OMG, this should have been my order. I had to bring my fork over and borrow a few noodles and more.  It's like Lucy borrowing sugar from Ethel and she takes the whole bag. The simpleness of this dish made it really standout.  I highly recommend.\n\n-- (4) Santa Maria marinated bavette steak, yucca fries, grilled green onion & salsa verde (it was good but not great).  The steak was a little tough, though they did cook it rare which made our visiting friend gleam with smile like that commercial toothpaste lady with the big mouth!\n\n-- (5) lamb links served with hummus and baby greens. This was my dish and well, it did not kick ass like the spag and pumkin squash, but I wouldn't mind having it for lunch again.\n\nAnd now for the drinks\n--- do try their Calicraft Brewing Co. \"Cali Coast\" Kolsch, malt, fresh lemon, straw.  It was quite refreshing and quite enjoyed the lemon malt taste to it!\n\nAll in all, our experience was memorable. Our visiting friend from Chile had his lashes batting the whole time, flirting with our waiter who reminded me of a dirty blond hair Superman!  He insisted in taking him to go!  Just my luck!

More of Casual style dining. \n\nThey brought us 2 glasses of champagne to start the evening, Eric or Erik was our waiter that night and did a phenomenal job. Personable, knowledgeable, and directed us towards exquisite menu selections. \n\nWe started with a mushroom pizza (gruyere, onions, and thyme) and added bacon - spot on perfection for us. \n\nThen he had a glass of the Gruner Veltliner which was superb for $13. I would rather pay a couple bucks more for a really good glass of wine than a Gruner that didn't have the layered complexity this one had - really great, good minerality with a nice kick of acidity. I had the Southern French white which was also pleasant. \n\nThen we got to main courses: He had what he always orders, The Bacon Spaghetti. I decided as a kid that I would never order spaghetti out because it's never going to taste like my Mom's. Well this is an entirely different experience - flavors that I've never had put together before and I would definitely order that Spaghetti!\n\nI had a perfectly cooked piece of Halibut with a delicious sauce and a Fava Risotto!! \nSo good is making me hungry right now. \n\nI chose a bottle of wine with some help from Eric and Mark (the Manager - was very helpful!!). The Ruby Bush Mourvedre from Australia at $42.00. Oh My God this wine was so good I want to buy a case of it. And at 42 dollars - it's a steal. I usually only taste Aussie wines this good when they're closer to a Hundred. \n\nWe finished the meal with some delicious home made ice creams - and then Eric brought out a Caramel Pot de Cr\u00e8me (on the house) with a candle in it. \n\nA 50th Birthday Truly Celebrated!!", "author": "Rew C."}

Funny how my almost all LGTB group ended up in the Castro. \n\nMy friend, who had invited me to this event, had bought a table. What exactly that entailed, I don't know, but I guess that she paid a sum of money that will eventually go to charity and that Starbelly also donated a table.\n\nTo be quite frank, I wasn't impressed. I understand that because it was basically free food, we were not given big (normal) portions, but the tasting portions we received were not only rather small but taste wise didn't sweep me off my feet either. \n\nWhile they were skimpy on the food, they were generous on the wine (oddly enough). Our glasses were filled to the brim, even though at the end of the night no one really managed to finish all three flights of wine. (Oh, and water replacements didn't really make it to our table, unless we asked for it.)\n\nI know, I'm probably being unfair to lament about mediocre food & negligent service when I received the meal for absolutely free.

He did reward me with lots of champagne to replace my lost fluids. Then we decided to journey back down the hill for dinner. Chad chose Starbelly because I'd never been there and he was pretty sure we could get a table without a reservation. Luckily he was right, although it was almost full. We were seated in the patio and this being San Francisco, I'm glad they had heat lamps. The ambience is very California coastal casual, laid back and lots of wood everywhere. \n\nWe ordered glasses of wine but quickly upped to a bottle LOL. I was still tipsy from the champagne so I don't remember the name of the wine (very out of character for the wino in me), but noted that Starbelly had a strong wine list and nice variety of California vintages plus wines from around the world.\n\nWe both ordered the applewood smoked chicken pot pie with wild mushrooms. This was not Swanson's frozen pot pie. It was huge, made from scratch, full of flavor and hearty! So delicious! At this point I don't remember if we had a pizza too but I doubt it. Things were fuzzy from the wine. I do remember we were so full we passed on dessert. \n\nSo bottom line, if you get the pot pie you might not need anything else.

We met at 8 p.m. with a reservation and all was squared away, ready to go. Servers were great, I have no complaints about the service.\n\nAmbiance: warm, despite the chilly night, softly lit (almost so much so that it was hard to tell it was open from across the street, but I like it). A little on the noisy side, but I may be a little noise-sensitive. \n\nFood is the reason it is 3-stars for me. The white bean dip was amazing, but the rest of our food was sort of ho-hum. My partner and I shared the white bean dip, Starbelly salad, and a vegetarian burger. The starbelly salad was tasty, but could have been developed a bit more in the flavor department (pepitas, perhaps - they were on the cheese plate; finely cut red onion?), and the vegetarian burger, while crunchy (nice!) lacked some flavor and maybe a little salt. Fries were good - house-made, but resulted in some really small pieces which made me self-conscious about shoveling tiny-fries into my mouth, and it was hard to dip in the ketchup provided. \n\nSo - if I were around in the area, I might try it again, but I wouldn't make that lonnnnggggg trek (again, I jest!) from the Richmond over.

Each time the wait was prohibitively long and we weren't ready to hang out an hour to get in, and we went elsewhere.\n\nSo finally, last night when it was recommended from a new friend, I hinged for a second. Then thought about it and realized that after a couple of years, and on a Wednesday night, and relatively early, we likely wouldn't have to wait. I was right. In we went.\n\nThe seating was cramped. Now I'm 6'6 so I get it, I'm not the norm. But that said, it was a tiny little table in a tight corner and my (5'6, 135lb.) friend literally had to slide the adjacent two-top a foot right to squeeze in and take his seat. Not sure what we would have done if it were occupied or if that friend were, let's say, 180 lbs. It was a bit too tight, even by urban standards.\n\nThe waiter was a bit of a SF cliche. Tight ironic t-shirt and hipster facial hair. Bored expression. Slight attitude. Must've been on his way back from a casting call for \"Looking\". I lived in LA, I'm used the pretentiousness... but it wasn't a welcome addition to the night, let's just say that.\n\nThe aesthetic of the place was perfect. Modern, clean, yet naturalistic and even \"woodsy\". A+ for that.\n\nThe food was delicious as promised. The brussell sprouts were excellent and the pumpkin dumplings were just okay. I enjoyed them, but they were tiny and expensive and just okay. Wouldn't order them again. The butternut squash pizza, on the other hand, is one of the best pizzas I've had.\n\nOverall, gorgeous place, convenient location, delicious food, a bit spendy, and the hipster servers need to stop being a cliche.

Oh, how grateful I am that he did! Starbelly has a wonderful, rustic vibe that reminds me a lot of a more chillaxed Matchbox (for a local reference). We were seated on the back patio which is covered and has heat lamps (since SF is cooooold, man! Even in--especially for--August!), and our waitress was super cool.\n\nWe started with a couple drinks -- they focus primarily on beers and wine, so I helped myself to a cider, and then ordered a bunch of things to share since they all sounded so good! They each deserve a soliloquy in their own right, but I'll try to keep this short and sweet for you all (as best I can... we all know my tendency to stray toward the verbose, hahaha).\n\nWhite Bean Dip with Roasted Eggplant: Like a mild, smooth, creamy hummus, this stuff was delicious and I'm pretty sure it was only a modicum of social decency that prevented my cousin from licking the bowl clean. It's served with two pieces of grilled pita.\n\nHeirloom Tomato Crostini with Burrata: Holy. Mouthgasm. The burrata was SO creamy, SO light, SO incredible, and the tomato underneath and balsamic reduction drizzled on top made it like a crispy bite of caprese salad -- but amped up to the extreme. I HIGHLY recommend this as an app or small plate. Comes with two pieces.\n\nMushroom Pizza: Again, absolutely delicious. SO many varieties of mushrooms, plus sweet red onion and cheese on top? My cousin indicated that Starbelly's pizzas in particular are very good, and I was NOT disappointed in the slightest. They have a woodfired taste, super crisp crust, and was all-around delicious.\n\nAnd finally, the Creamed Corn with Mascarpone: I don't really even have words to describe how delicious I found this. It wasn't really so much creamed-creamed corn as you'd think. The corn kernels were all still very visible and weren't cooked into oblivion. There's a dollop of mascarpone right in the middle that melted into the corn and just made the entire thing generally incredible. It's a side dish, and I highly, HIGHLY recommend tacking it onto your meal. You can thank me for it later.\n\nSo! All in all, a delicious meal that was actually fairly reasonably priced, too! Between the two of us, I think the bill came to around $70-something? So like $35 per person, And with two drinks each, I think that ends up being pretty damn cheap, really, for the quality of food. I would absolutely return, though I want to try the owner's other two restaurants now, too!", "author": "Gretchen F."}

Starbelly has been on my list of \"places to try\" since I spied the over easy eggs on their pizza's.  We called ahead and they luckily had a table for us ready upon arrival.\n\nWe decided to go the family style route and ordered different dishes to share. I have to say that the food or service did not disappoint.\n\nhouse cut fries & three dips 6:\nNothing special about the fries. They were the skinny cut crispy kind which you cant go wrong with. The 3 sauces were a nice touch but the kids and most of the adults preferred just plain ketchup.\n\npan roasted black mussels, Mexican chorizo, market chili & cilantro 10\nOh man this was nomnom. The mussels were fresh and the chorizo along with the chili and cilantro gave it a nice kick! Order this!\n\nhouse made chicken liver p\u00e2t\u00e9, buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade & grain mustard 10\nOk to say I was skeptical about ordering this is an understatement. I am not really a fan of pate. I mean..I think its ok depending on where you eat it and I never go out of my way to order it but the waitress insisted that its one of the most popular dishes on the menu so why not? WOW is an understatement.. the dish came with a slice of their house made pate, dijon mustard, some kind of jam, with toasted sourdough slices. When you add all these ingredients together and take a bite? My friend explained it perfectly when he said \"its like a flavor explosion in your mouth' DELICIOUS. YES ORDER THIS! and make sure you smear the pate on the toast then the jam and mustard. It all goes together!\n\nmarinated beets, cara cara orange, basil & raw goat's milk feta 6\nIf you're a beets fan then you will love this dish. Simple just like the description.\n\nstarbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, arugula & green goddess dressing 14 \nI had them add a few eggs onto the pizza.. so so so yummy! The freshness of the arugula, the creaminess of the perfectly over easy eggs, the saltiness of the house cured bacon, finished with their green dressing put this pizza over the top!\n\n fresh spaghetti, starbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, tomato sauce & basil 12 \nWe originally ordered one but had to add another order since this was such a hit at the table. The bacon really does it. Their house bacon is cured pork belly.. heavenly with the fresh spaghetti and I love the kick of the jalapeno. Simplistic but everything worked well together. \n\nBoth the hubs and friend had their specialty cocktail called the \"Walking Dead\" Good but very strong! They both had 2 and had a nice buzz. \n\nService was spot on. Thanks to the hostess for finding us a table at the last minute on a friday evening. For the waitress with great recommendations. And the busboys for keeping our water glasses full.\n\nTotal bill.. a little over a $104 plus tip. Reasonable prices for fabulous food, how can you go wrong?! \n\n5 stars", "author": "Cynthia A."}

After an unreasonable delay for service, our food arrived with three out of three disappointments. The loco moco ordered \"medium well\" came rare if not tartare. Hawaiian loco moco is covered in gravy, but theirs was drizzled with soy sauce. The chilaquiles arrived barely warm and without chorizo. Clearly all but the egg had been prepared in advance; the taco chips were soggy and indistinguishable from the flat pieces of chicken, as both were covered with a tasteless chili sauce.  We held out hope for the  bacon/arugula pizza until we tasted the cardboard crust--crispy on top but dense and chewy underneath. The waitress was apologetic, but should have offered to redo the dishes, not just heat up the burger. Apparently changes in the kitchen staff have made what was once a go-to place in the Castro no longer what it was.", "author": "Bruce L."}

When we were seated at the long communal table someone immediately took our order for mimosas. We placed our food order and waited a really long amount of time for our food to arrive at the table. The server apologized.  It took so long that our mimosas had already been fully consumed. We didn't really have a problem with that, but we did have a problem feeling we were rushed after our food arrived. Three different people tried to take our plates away before we were finished. There is one gentleman who might be the manager but he was also the expediter at the food counter. He asked if we wanted anything else and we said we were finished. Within a few minutes he came back again and asked if we wanted dessert. He was apparently annoyed that having finished our meal we took a few moments to chat. He didn't mind that we waited an inordinate amount of time for our food to arrive.  Beware of going to this place during busy times.

Our server was very personable and helpful with getting our orders in a timely manner.

SO DELICIOUS between the two we tried. Very yummy with the fruity flavors and the alcohol is very subtle.\n\nFor the food...I really enjoyed the house made chicken liver pate. It comes with buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade & grain mustard and in my opinion, you have to have it all together to truly enjoy it. The contrasting flavors definitely scintillated my taste buds. \n\nThe pan roasted black mussel was also something I would recommend. The chorizo definitely gives it a little bit of a spicy kick and complimented the mussels well. I ended up dipping the fries into the sauce/broth that was leftover. \n\nLastly, the fresh spaghetti needs an honorable mention. The flavor itself tastes much like home, but what's distinct about this dish is the texture and consistency of the actual noodles. I enjoyed the thicker and chewier texture of the spaghetti which made this typically \"normal\" dish, different.", "author": "Vincent L."}

It tasted more like apple juice, but diluted with water. \n\nStarbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, arugula & green goddess dressing ($14) - This was delicious!  If you love thin crust pizzas (like I do), you'll love this!  I liked that the sauce was piled on cause most of the time it causes the crust to be soggy.  I only wish there were more jalape\u00f1os on the pizza.\n\nBlackened catfish,house made tasso, okra, & sweet pepper risotto ($18) - Very fresh and nicely seasoned! I liked that it didn't have the \"muddy\" taste.  \n\nSalted Caramel Pot de Creme ($8) - The size of the pot de creme was decent.  It was very smooth, but didn't have a strong caramel taste.  \n\nButter cornbread, Bacon Jalape\u00f1o Ice Cream & Jalape\u00f1o Jam ($9) - The anticipated dish!  Maybe I had high expectations, but this didn't AMAZE me like I thought it would.  The ice cream was topped with bacon served on a warm grilled cornbread with jalape\u00f1o jam.  I was expecting more jalape\u00f1o flavor in the ice cream, but didn't get it.  It was tasty, but like I said, I think I had high expectations.  \n\n**SERVICE**\n\nThe hostess greeted us when we walked in, which doesn't always happen at restaurants.

Nothing too special, just your standard fries with what tasted like ketchup, mustard, and pesto.\n\nChicken Liver P\u00e2t\u00e9 with Buttered Bread, Sweet Onion Marmalade, Grain Mustard ($11) - My friends LOVED this appetizer because of the variety of textures and flavors that accompany the p\u00e2t\u00e9. I thought it was alright, but I'll get to my favorite appetizer in a second.\n\nBurrata di Stefano with Cherry Tomatoes and Basil Puree ($9) - Another great sharable appetizer. The waitress said this was a bit like putting together your own bruschetta, which is pretty accurate. \n\nCrispy Brussels Sprouts with Balsamic-Honey and Bacon ($7) - The p\u00e2t\u00e9 is popular, but this is my absolute FAVORITE. We had to order an extra one for the table. If you didn't like brussel sprouts before... you will after this appetizer!\n\nChorizo Pizza with Sunny Eggs and Cilantro ($15) - The cilantro really pulls this pizza together with the chorizo, and the sunny side up eggs are a nice touch, especially if you get the slice with the exploding egg. Love this one!\n\nMushroom Pizza with Gruyere, Thyme, Roasted Onions ($16) - This pizza was too mushroomy for my taste, and I could hardly taste anything else on the pizza, so unless you're a huge fan of mushrooms...\n\nSpicy Italian Sausages, Mascarpone Polenta, Roasted Sweet Peppers, Onions, Tomatoes ($19) - My favorite dish of the night. I was looking forward to trying this, and the unity of flavors between the spicy sausages and the creamy polenta was totally worth the wait.\n\nBavette Steak, Yucca Fries, Grilled Green Onion and Salsa Verde ($25) - I thought I would like this dish more than I did. The yucca fries were good, but the flavor of the steak was a bit underwhelming. Beautifully presented, though.\n\nLast tip is to make a reservation to eat here, especially for a large group of people. And if you arrive early, just grab a drink at the bar.

Two of my friends responded almost immediately with Starbelly, assuring me that I'd like the place. Sorry, point of this now long-ass anecdote: Starbelly! It's the place to be when you're hungry and alone in the Castro.\n\nThe place was close to empty at three on a Friday afternoon. I walked in with my backpack, sat at the bar, and felt quite comfortable. The restaurant was charming and casual, with a clean, modern look. The bar was great for dining solo. The bartender served as my waitress, and later, my guide to the nearest train station. She was really nice, and I wish I'd taken down her name.\n\nMy original lunch plan had been to eat sandwich leftovers that I'd accidentally left in my purse overnight, but my date with self at Starbelly was very pleasant, well worth the $30 I hadn't planned to spend. I ordered a cocktail and the spaghetti, which one of my friends had recommended. I read a Jeff VanderMeer novel, ate and drank slowly.\n\nStarbelly doesn't have a full liquor license. They serve beer and wine, as well as a handful of cocktails made with port, sherry, vermouth, a variety of liqueurs and apertifs. I had The Other Demon, a cocktail of Kina L'Avion, lemon, and charred jalape\u00f1o. It was a lovely cocktail, mellow and balanced with an underlying layer of spice.\n\nThe spaghetti was delicious, fresh thick ropes of pasta in a chunky tomato sauce with Starbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, basil, and a few ribbons of cheese melting on top. The bacon was particularly good, substantial and smokey with great texture.\n\nI'd come to Starbelly now and then if I lived in the city, but as it is, I will keep it on my radar for future visits.

The place was busy inside, but it seemed like they could have handled us if we'd walked in.  It was a hot night, but the interior was mercifully cool. \nWe are vegetarian and ordered the grilled fig salad (with blue cheese panna cotta, cress, and almond honey balsamic), the veggie burger (which came with fries), and the roasted corn pizza (with aged cheddar, Aleppo chili, and lime cilantro aioli). We were pleasantly surprised by the rather affordable cocktail menu, and also ordered the Starbelly 75 cocktail (vermouth, ginger, cava, and lemon) which was gingery but not too sweet and very refreshing. Overall, we enjoyed the pizza the most. We were trying to decide between ordering this pizza and their market mushroom pizza, but ultimately went with the roasted corn because the topping combination was one we haven't encountered before and seemed perfect for summer. The crust was about average but the roasted corn and aioli were fantastic. We though the veggie burger, which reminded us of a falafel burger, was just okay-- we were fine eating it, but would probably not order again. The fries were surprisingly dry-- not sure if we got the dregs of an old basket that had been sitting out or what. The grilled fig salad was small but yummy. \n\nIf we were to come back, we'd probably go with their pizza, and order off the \"small\" and \"snacks\" sections. \n\nThis place seemed like it could handle a big group as well.", "author": "T K."}

I will say the food was great. Our server, however, is probably the reason we will never come back to the restaurant.

I understand it's a Friday night, and patience might be low towards the end of the night. But the service we got was not the same as the service the people next to us received. Essentially, there really was no service. He just wanted our order and just place food on table. Not once, during the course of our meal did our server ask how our meals were. While our other table was constantly being catered to. I asked for more bread that was never brought, while the table next to us got a free meal for something that was the customers' own mistake. When I asked for the check, he barely acknowledge me, not a word or simple reply was exchange. He went immediately back to catering to the table next to us. When we thanked him for the check there was no reply. The difference in the customer service provided was so blatant, I wouldn't recommend this to any of my colleagues. \n\nOverall, the food was great. As I've mentioned my first time here was great.

It was distracting and unpleasant.\n\nHowever, the liver pate was out of this world!  Served with buttered and grilled, hard crusted bread with a side of ground mustard and caramelized onions-- this was one of the tastiest dishes I've had in a long time.  Clap! Clap!

We added white cheddar to this medium cooked burger and it was excellent.\n\nWe also shared a tasteless pizza margherita with added mushrooms.  It looked great and presented well but there was absolutely no taste to the sauce at all--and, the basil leaves were just placed on top after the pizza was cooked.  I looked at all of the other diners that were eating pizza and every single one of them was shaking a jar of red pepper flakes over their pizza.  I guess their pizza needed flavor too.\n\nService was great.  We ended with the warm toffee cake with mascarpone & medjool dates.  Winner!  The cake was fabulous.", "author": "Thomas D."}

Good thing we had reservations, because this place was packed. We were promptly seated in the outdoor patio area. It was a cold rainy day in SF but they had this area covered and had heat lamps so it was great. \n\nThe food was really outstanding. My boyfriend ordered the chorizo pizza. The flavor was delicious and the fresh cilantro completely hit it out of the park. Finally, the eggs on the pizza provided some amazing yolk porn ;)\n\nI had the chicken and waffles and was equally satisfied. The chicken breading was delightfully crunchy and the chicken itself was flavorful. The waffles were fluffy. My only feedback is that I had to ask for syrup and it seemed strange not to automatically include syrup on the side for chicken and waffles. But our waitress brought it quickly so the syrup crisis was instantly averted. \n\nMaple bacon doughnut was also delicious (I mean it's maple and it's bacon, how could it not be) but not worth $4.

On the day of we were a tad bit late because finding parking in this area is so difficult! So Tip #1; reserve enough time to look for parking. We were seated right when we got there. If there was one thing out of the whole experience that I would complain about, it would be the seating situation. We were seated right next to the bathroom so there was a lot of traffic going by us all the time, and the thought of being so close to the bathroom is just unnerving. Also, in restaurants like this, I feel like they try to pack as many tables as possible, so the table next to us was awfully close. I like my space and not having to feel like I'm dining with the party sitting next to me. Other than that, I really enjoyed the overall experience of this dinner. My boyfriend and I shared:\n\nSnacks:\nHouse Cut Fries and Three Dips \nBread & Olive Oil\n\nSmall:\nBurrata di Stefano\n\nPizza: \nMarket Mushroom\n\nPlates:\nVeggie Burger\n\nThe bread and olive oil came out first. Nothing really special about it in my opinion- not to say we weren't satisfied though because it is exactly what it says it is. Shortly after, we got the Fries and the Burrata. The dips that the fries came with were ketchup, a basil pesto, and one more that I cannot remember. The fries were delicious, but I am always a big fan of french fries. We ordered the Burrata because I had seen it recommended so many times and needed to try it for myself. I'm not too sure if I would order it again though. Then came the veggie burger. This one I was a little iffy about because I never usually order vegetarian dishes. However, I was very pleasantly surprised by how well it tasted! It might be my favorite dish from the meal. Since we had already ordered the fries and dip, we were able to get a salad with the burger instead of fries. The last thing to come out was the Market Mushroom pizza. It was also really good but we were so full that we took most of the pizza home. Everything we ordered came out to around $55 so I am definitely satisfied.", "author": "Michelle C."}

The hostess was kind enough to apologize and told me the night manager, Tessa, would contact me back that evening to resolve. She never did. I called the next day and was given the same message. This is ridiculous given it's their fault and likely the case of a server looking to increase his tips by upcharging and hoping the patrons wouldn't notice.

We chose the front of the restaurant which was nice but retrospectively we should've sat in the back patio. We never actually saw it but everyone who walked in the front door chose to sit at the patio--probably because of the sunny weather outside.\n\nAt any rate, you must go with the Chicken Liver Pate (what they're known for). If you're like me, you probably have never had something like this. It's worth trying for the first time and shouldn't bring up gross solid organ taste thoughts (like the liver and onion scene in Doug). It actually sort of reminded of bone marrow because of the texture, appearance, and service with toasty bread and jam. I think the toasty bread makes it taste 10 times better.\n\nWe also had some pizza and fries, both delicious, but the real highlight of the meal was the liver pate.

The first time, I had some sort of cheese pizza (cave aged gruyere, thyme, mushrooms, roasted onions: why can this restaurant across the menu identify beef as \"Prather Ranch\" and hazlenuts as \"Oregon\" and Gruyere as \"cave aged\", but they can't actually tell you what type of mushrooms are on the pizza, well, that's just me), which, after finally getting it, was nauseating. Gruyere is an oily cheese - wonderful in fondue, but on this pizza, perhaps along with the 'roasted' onions (isn't that practically the definition of onions on a pizza), created a slimy mess which literally dripped with oil. The pizza itself was basking in a pool of its own oil. The slimy gruyere and onions happily slid off the slice into the oil pool on the pizza pan when you picked up a slice, meaning you had to kind of re-assemble the pizza with cutlery to actually eat it - don't think of touching the slice. Unfortunately I did so which immediately coated my fingers with unpleasantly fragrant unctuous oil like melted vaseline, I'm sure somehow managing to coat my body like a special effect from \"The Matrix\". Nauseating. Well, I decided to give the restaurant a second chance, and in another visit tried a different pizza - pizza margherita, with fresh mozzarella and basil. So simple, what could go wrong with tomato and cheese coated bread for $15? I threw caution to the wind, and even asked for chorizo also on the pizza. After waiting too long (should we say something?), out came the pizza. I picked up a slice, and what normally I'd expect to find - a crisp crust with a thin tasty layer of tomato, warm-brown bubbly cheese, some fresh basil and chorizo - was actually apparently a can of tomato soup served on a flat wet bread round with a cheese crust - sort of a tomato version of onion soup gratinee, with the croutons around the soup instead of in it. This was revealed to me when I picked up a slice, and naturally the entire tomato/cheese/chorizo/basil complex slid off with a plop into the pool of tomato soup. I know it's asking a lot, but when you offer pizza on a menu, it would really help to actually be able to serve, you know, edible pizza. My guest and I got up, laughing, and took the pizza to the main cash register, with the poor waiter, and said we had to leave, here was $10 for the ice teas, the pizza was inedble for a second time. They were of course mystified why I didn't find the pizza staggeringly delicious until I pointed out it was actually tomato soup on a flat metal plate disguised as food. When they saw the soup-like pool on the pizza plan, the sad pizza slice echorche (that should have been the menu description), with doe-eyed sadness they bid me adieu with apologies for their inability to serve, well, food. The mystery lies unsolved in my mind. How could the cook get something as elementary as pizza wrong, over and over again in different variations? Did the waiter servicing the pizza not notice the pool of oil/tomato juice on the pizza slopping in the pan? Did patrons not think pizza slice echorche was unacceptable? Had nobody every complained? Did the front-of-house people think that they should not call a manager about pizza soup? Alas.", "author": "Joe F."}

You're in the Castro!\n\nFor starters we got the mussels with chorizo, which were AMAZING.  Something about seafood and chorizo just clicks, and these people have it down to a tee.  My date and I would have been fighting over it if it wasn't for the portion size, which was quite generous.\n\nAnyway, we were recommended the bacon-arugula-green goddess dressing and it was absolutely delicious.  I don't even like arugula but the bacon was delicious and the greens went perfectly with the dressing.  If I recall correctly, it was well-portioned without being overly expensive too.  \n\nA few things to improve on though -- maybe a larger waiting area?  Even for just a 10m wait, I felt very cramped, especially when the hostess started talking to one of her friends.  Additionally, no one likes to be seated next to the bathroom, especially when there are other tables open.

The chicken pate is rich, salty, and fatty which goes great with the accompanying mustard and jam. Just spread it all on a nicely toasted sour dough bread slice and sip it all down with their wine mixed cocktails. Pizzas are pretty good here as well. The crust is a nice soft chewy gourmet texture that is definitely distinct to this restaurant. \n\nStarbelly is definitely a great date place or special occasions spot. The interior is a nice subtle rustic hipster vibe but by no means pretentious. The patio in the back is one of the hidden gems in the city on a rare sunny sf day.

BUT because of the holiday, they were serving only their special holiday menu items. No pate. I was crushed, but decided to drown my sorrows in a light lunch here anyway. :)\n\nMy husband and I shared the following 2 items (and we were stuffed afterwards!): \n\n- Bibb lettuce salad: Oh my god, this was one of the best salads I have ever had: Soft bibb lettuce, grilled chicken breast (still very juicy), two thick slices of bacon, cherry tomatoes over a luscious but light green goddess dressing! It was mouthwatering, and even my husband adored this salad. \n\n- Chorizo pizza with cilantro and sunny eggs: Good, but not flavorful enough. The eggs were too wet and when you grabbed a slice of pizza, all the toppings slid off the slice you were holding. So, it was kind of difficult to eat as well as not as flavorful, since the toppings practically had to be eaten separately. \n\nHowever, we definitely want come back to try some more goodies at this gem in the Castro!

If it weren't for the service, this place would probably be rated 1 star for the food.\n\nThe brussels sprouts were the best thing about this meal. Deep fried and covered in a perfect mixture of balsamic, honey, and crisp bacon, the brussels sprouts were some of the best I've had.\n\nSomeone at the table ordered french fries, and they were bad. I can't remember the last time I thought french fries were bad. Half of the fries were a half inch long, like they were trying to make hash browns and decided instead on fries. How do you dip hash browns in fancy organic ketchup and aioli?\n\nThe catfish was cooked well. It was fresh and well seasoned, and very flakey. But, while the risotto had at least the standard restaurant toothiness, it was severely underseasoned. I'm guessing they were going for a cajun theme with the blackened catfish, okra, and (not andouille) sausage. It didn't work.\n\nAnd then the worst item on the menu: the spaghetti. My god, I haven't ever ordered a dish I couldn't finish, until now. It consisted of pork belly chunks, movie theater jalape\u00f1o peppers, and a slightly overcooked spaghetti in a worse-than-prego tomato sauce. Please, for the love of Thomas Keller, do not order the spaghetti. It's like someone got high and hungry, and threw together a bunch of leftover shit they found in their pantry.\n\nThe fact that they would even serve that spaghetti would warrant giving this restaurant 1 star. But the service and brussels sprouts were good, so I've decided to give them 2 stars.\n\nThis goes without saying, but it was overpriced. Would have been overpriced if the spaghetti was anything more than free, let alone $14. I cringe when I think about eating it.", "author": "Jefferey L."}

I came in for brunch with family that I hadn't seen for years & our experience was anything but Relaxing. \n\nYes, Their food is quite good. The Chilaquiles were nice, with Choritzo sausage in them. The fried chicken with waffles was quite interesting and the Yoghurt with fresh fruit, granola, and honey was a bit nice for a starter or light breakfast. The pizzas looked quite good. The drinks were the highlight for me. The Sangria was really flavourful with heaps of fruit inside. Very fresh, refreshing, and just lovely. They also have great Mimosas and a lovely Grapefruit cocktail that one would drink in the morning for brunch I suppose. The presentation of the food was quite beautiful.\n\nI am taking 3 stars off for the RUSHED Seating and the slightly RUDE Service which was compromised; I hate the Community Table. It was slightly uncomfortable & awkward. They are really FUSSY about seating. They take Reservations but if you dont have one chances are you might have to sit at this very long and high table shared with other guests. \n\nThe stools are quite high and its a bit risky that one might fall - I had a foot injury at the time and was worried about the improper seating arrangements. I was limping & was worried about sitting on the stools & the, Staff either ignored me or pretended to be too busy to notice although they should pay more attention to customers & those who have special needs.\n\nAlso, the food is served quickly and this isn't really a spot for a long breaky/brunch. They want you to eat and get out quickly. The minute I finished my breakfast and put my cutlery down they cleared my plate!

First was brunch with a group friends. Service was super slow, they forgot some of our dishes, and the food took forever to come out. When it did, the eggs were hard and overcooked and everything else was dry from sitting under the warmer for too long.\n\nEven more recent was New Years day dinner. This was the last straw. The hostess tried to seat us in the cold patio area and gave us detached attitude when we requested to sit indoors. Perhaps, she should have asked to begin with instead of assuming we wanted to start the new year by freezing our asses off! Anyway, she tried seating all subsequent parties outside too with about a 25% success rate. \n\nOur waiter and the timing of food was simply offensive. We sat at our table for a prolonged period before we were finally greeted. The first round of drinks came out ok as did our appetizers. Then I swear it took 45 minutes to get out entrees!!!! The four-top beside is we're able to order their food, get all the drinks, appetizers and entrees from the time our appetizers were cleared and the time our entrees arrived! For god's sake, does it really take that long to cook a burger and a pizza?!?! I was pissed at this point, but it doesn't stop there. To add insult to injury, our server avoided us for the duration of the meal and we were left to sit there with our subpar food until we could finally flag him down for our check. This probably took another 30 minutes, sheesh!\n\nAnd if anybody cares, the sardines were greasy and the burger was cold and dry. And yet again, you've managed to make your pizza crust flavorless and chalky. Thought you'd like to know because nobody there bothers to ask while you're eating anymore.", "author": "Vicente G."}

The burger itself looked burnt even though I had asked for medium well. For an $11 burger, I expected a burger to be of high quality with hopefully a gourmet twist. Unfortunately, the burger did not even come with mayo or ketchup. Only lettuce, tomato and red onions. The burger was nothing special and trust me, I have eaten tons of gourmet burgers every month.\n\nThe fries itself were ok and were just soft and tasted bland. They taste like In N Out fries. If I had knew, I would have told them to make the fries crispier. My friend had the margerita pizza which he thought was ok and was overpriced at $16 for a pizza slightly bigger than a typical small. Other than that, stick with the small plates. The highlight had to be the chicken liver pate with bread. That was incredible.

We are from Chicago, so we were excited to be in a city where the sun actually shines and wanted to take advantage. Starbelly has an outdoor patio in the back that is covered. We went for lunch and mentioned our sun issue, and they came over and retracted the patio roof for our table (most other patrons wanted the shade). We thought the service was fantastic even beyond this nice gesture. They also had a nice beer list and this amazing pizza with Starbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, arugula & green goddess dressing.", "author": "Heidi B."}

The patio was full - it was a nice day - but we were able to sit next to the glass wall inside the restaurant looking out at the patio. The d\u00e9cor is clean and the vibe is good. I immediately liked Starbelly. \n\nThey have the kind of menu I love. Everything sounds good and it only takes about 90 seconds to decide. My friend and I decided to share a Gruyere, mushroom, thyme, onion pizza and the chilaquiles with chorizo. We both ordered beer from the eclectic offerings, trying ones we've never had, and really liked them. The service was great, the food came out quickly and the bill was $45. \n\nThe pizza crust was perfect, thin with just the right amount of flake and chew. We ate every bite of food and were just a tad beyond satisfied. The pizza wasn't as flavorful as I expected but was still good. The chilaquiles were awesome. I don't even know what they are but I could have eaten this dish all day. So delish! Not very spicy but really flavorful. \n\nOnly one unisex bathroom here in the middle of the restaurant so if you need to go, you'll either line up in front of everyone or keep your eye on the door.

For me, this place has everything. First of all, the staff is very polite, friendly and engaging. I've never had a bad experience in the bazilion times I've been here. And the food is delicious! For brunch, we had the Chilaquiles and the Fried Chicken and Waffles. Both were absolutely scrumptious! The chicken was nice and moist and the Chilaquiles couldn't have been more flavorful. We sat in the back patio area which has a clean simplistic feel to it. I love this seating area. It's covered so you don't have to worry about getting too much sun (when that's an option). To quench our thirst, we decided on a bottle of the Prosesco. It was so tasty that we ended up letting our nice waiter talk us into ordering an additional bottle after our meal. \n\nStarbelly you make me happy!", "author": "H P."}

Luckily, on my most recent trip, I had a very friendly waiter who was attentive without being overly so. I appreciated that he had recommendations (when I asked), and they were all spot-on!\n\nFavorite dishes:\nHomemade chicken liver pate\nStarbelly bacon pizza with arugula and green goddess sauce\nSalted caramel pot de creme with rosemary cookies - I ADORE this desert, there's a smokiness to the caramel, accented nicely with sea salt - and it goes beautifully with the cookies. I don't always get dessert when I go out, but I order this every time I go to Starbelly!\n\nExcellent drinks:\nThe Cask of Oloroso: slightly citrusy and spicy, very nicely balanced - perhaps too drinkable! :)\nFrench Cowboy: very refreshing, with a fun combination of strawberry and sage. Not at all too sweet. There's a very slight bitter aftertaste.\n\nOthers:\nSunset in Seville: nice and refreshing but not remarkable.\nThe Declaration: the madeira gives it a bit too much sweetness up front, and I didn't love how the flavors came together.\n\nCons:\nSuper crowded inside - even compared to other SF restaurants.\nTheir wine list isn't reliable.\n\nOne time we had a lousy experience (hence the 3 stars), when my husband and I brought a friend for his birthday. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation, requested outdoor seating (which I had also asked for when I made the reservation), and waited for a table to clear. Three people who arrived about 15 minutes after us and had a reservation for the same time were seated almost immediately outside. We asked about our table, and from the conversation between the hostesses,  it was clear that one of them had completely forgotten about us. They finally sat us inside (after we had waited for 45 minutes), shoved in an unpleasant corner next to the bathroom. They apologized but that was it.\n\nBottom line: overall good food (some is excellent), great patio, but they won't go out of their way to make it up to you if they make mistakes.", "author": "Kate Z."}

One of my friends who has eaten here several times before commented that he's noticed that about the same hostess every time too. I mean, if you're going to be the first person diners deal with when they enter your restaurant, at least FAKE being welcoming. She got all bent out of shape when I asked if it were possible if we could all be seated together. I even went so far as telling her that it's absolutely ok if we can't. She made it happen, but her attitude and body language made it looked like I was totally ruining her day. Then she was like, \"I can seat you together, but we have another big party coming in at 6:30.\" OK... thanks I guess.\n\nWe got seated a while later. I was still pretty irritated by the initial encounter, but luckily that went away fast after the great service we received from Keidi and all the delicious food we ordered. For appetizers, we had the pate and the white bean puree, and I think between all of us, we ordered almost all of their entrees on the dinner menu. I had the italian sausage with the mascarpone polenta, which was awesome. \n\nWe double checked about the initial time constraint, which Keidi noted wasn't actually an issue, so we stayed for dessert.\n\nWould be 5 stars if their hostesses were better... hosts.

They just want to highlight the beneficiary of their laid-back comfort food - our bellies. Well, my bulbous belly at least since I finally tried dinner here after a promising dessert experience last September. The Castro is in need of a comfortable place like this, and it definitely wins the award for best use of a former Asqew Grill space. \n\nWhat honestly strikes me first is how reasonably priced the menu is. The highest priced entrees are $22 (the lamb chops and the bass). Most everything else is in the mid-teens, the small plates even less. Jamie W. and I were seated in the back right next to the restroom door, so we got quite a view of the customers. It was buzzing with activity but surprisingly not overly loud as you would expect. Just a constant hum of conversation with pockets of laughter.\n\nWe started with the $9 Grilled Little Gems, Cara Cara Oranges, Raw Milk Feta and Oregon Hazelnuts - a warmed salad with a nice little bite (see photo). Grilling lettuce would seem like a lost cause, but somehow it worked. The salad was followed by the $11 Dungeness Crab Hush Puppies with Louie Dressing (see photo). It was a trio of deep-fried balls, a bit too dense for my taste as the crab weighed them down considerably, but slathering the Louie dressing helped. The entrees were better, standard diner fare with unexpected touches.\n\nJamie had the $12 Spaghetti with Starbelly Bacon, Jalapeno, Tomato and Basil. The jalapeno really gave it a kick that you don't quite expect, and the saltiness of the bacon brought it close to carbonara in flavor. I went even more traditional with the $16 Half-Rotisserie Chicken with Warm Potatoes and Winter Spinach Salad, which was as Marie Callendar-like as it sounds except the seasoning was a lot more robust. It was all good stuff and well worth hanging out for a while since it is such a convivial space in a great 'hood. I'm sure my \"Check-In\" count here will grow in the coming months. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...plentiful comfort food, nicely priced for a modest night out \nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...I like what I said last time...it is comfortably hip and unapologetically square all at the same time \nSERVICE - 4 stars...better this time perhaps because we ordered a full meal \nTOTAL - 4 stars...yep, I am a Sneetch with a Starbelly...oh, the places I go", "author": "Ed U."}

Thanks to 3 of my close friends for taking me out to SF for a nice day of dining, exploring hidden gems of the city, daytime drinking and best of all...shopping! This place definitely fulfilled my tasty tastebuds for some good ol' brunch before enjoying the rest of our day of festivities. \n\nI absolutely love the simple decor of this restaurant! Starting from the farm-style tables to the very well-lit lighting and some sunrays to filter inside and the back outdoor patio area, I already knew I would be a returning customer. The staff was superb! All the finishing touches really came together after being seated and eyeing the whole establishment but it was the food I was looking forward to checking out.\n\nSkimmed through their short list of breakfast/brunch items; seems that everything off the menu would be more than just good. I knew it would be amazing! Of course, I wanted something different. I went with my gut; chose the Sunnyside Joe's dish. My friends got the chicken and waffles, loco moco, a side of truffle fries with a trio of sauces, Dynamo donut (yes they serve it here) and simple eggs, sausages and roasted potatoes dish. Sunnyside Joe's really hit the spot. The dish came out beautifully crafted, prepped and tasted like the best comfort food I've always imagined. Starbelly offers a pretty large portion so my friends and I were able to share our food tapa style.\n\nA good meal to start off our day, mimosas, lavender-like lemonades and planning our full day ahead; this place is a keeper. Not overly priced, good portions, inviting atmosphere, and delicious food; how can you not like this place? I'm a FAN!", "author": "Fraulein C."}

We popped in here at about 2:30 on a Saturday and say on the patio which was GORGEOUS. It was light and airy and breezy and we loved the rustic wood with all the succulents hanging down. Our sever was so adorable I just wanted to take him home in my pocket, and he was incredibly helpful and knowledgable of the menu. As for the food - our suggest-y friend raved about the Starbelly pizza: bacon, jalape\u00f1o, arugula, and green goddess dressing, and it by no means disappointed. It was bacony deliciousness with a hefty pile of my absolute favorite greens and just the perfect amount of jalape\u00f1o. My husband ordered the butternut squash pizza which just blew my mind. It had some very autumny flavors which surprised me right at the beginning of spring, but I am obsessed with squash and those sorts of flavors so I didn't mind one bit. Roasted butternut squash, ricotta, black garlic, and roasted pumpkin seeds. To DIE for. I also had the asparagus soup with lump Dungeness and I loved it so much - it was perfectly light and refreshing and the Dungeness was just the right rich touch. Like I said, we don't get down to the city much but whenever I am looking to eat somewhere whenever I'm there, I almost fear I'll never try anything else because I'll want to go to Starbelly every.

I called Starbelly, and she said they had a table for us if we came by right then. We get there, and get seated immediately at the bar. So far so good. \n\nThen the food came.... And it was phenomenal.  I had a fried chicken poboy with a jalape\u00f1o slaw, and she had a burger with everything (literally everything in the kitchen) and a mimosa. I'm realizing this is more of a lunch review now as I type it, but it was the brunch experience so whatever. \n\nThe fried chicken was so tender, maybe the best I've had in the city. Black pepper and cornmeal breading maybe. Next time would do the chicken and waffles though. \n\nBurger was the best I've had here too. With bacon,avocado, cheese, it comes out to 19 but it was perfect.

The pizza sauce was a bit spicy, which was confusing since they served it with a side of red pepper flakes. The modern trend of adding spiciness to everything including mixed drinks is infuriating - it should always and only be an option for those with muted taste buds. My extensive travels have taught me that hot spice is most often used to mask mediocre products like old meat, tough meat, unfresh seafood, etc. After all, why would you want to overwhelm the tastebuds when you are being served the highest quality products. You wouldn't. The menu did not make clear that this was to be a spicy pizza. Everything else was excellent.", "author": "Josh K."}

It may seem very minimal but having worked in restaurants for years I have seen hosts/greeters who lack the passion and level of service she provided. \n\nAfter being sat our server greeted us and answered a few questions. I don't recall the servers name since it came across incredibly casual. I don't recall any specials being announced or any introduction. It was essentially \"Do you want sparkling or flat water\"? I was interested in ordering a beverage but the impatience shown by the server didn't give me much time to order. \n\nI ordered my burger medium and it was red/pink/bloody. I was starving so I didn't want to wait anymore and just ate it. The bottom bun was soaked completely through and it fell apart while I was eating it. It was good but to me medium has a little bit of pink on the verge of being completely brown. \n\nThe ambience is nice. The tables looked like they were made from old shuffleboards. The lights were made from cardboard.

No back up for a specialty item?), so I ordered the burger.\n\nThe grilled cheese sandwich arrived cold, and the soup tasted good, but was an unappetizing fluorescent orange. The burger came out extremely well done though it was ordered medium,  It was dry and tasteless, the onions and tomato looked and tasted like they had been prepped the day before. The onions were so acidic, the plate stunk of them. The worst burger I have ever been served.\n\nThe caesar salad was served untrimmed on the bottom and the croutons looked and tasted like they came form a turkey stuffing package from 1995.

I've come here 2x in the last couple months: once for dinner and once for brunch (just yesterday). Mostly because I live a block away and I heard it's good for brunch. I enjoyed my brunch experience more so than my dinner experience, but I still think there are way better places to check out in SF.\n\nBrunch:\nRoasted Porchetta (2.5 stars): Sounded good on the menu, but the actual dish wasn't as appetizing as I thought. Bread was nice and toasty, but the porchetta meat was a bit bland and the salsas/arugula that were also in the sandwich did not bring out that much additional flavor. Wasn't horrible if you're craving a sandwich, but not spectacular.\n\nChorizo & Eggs Pizza (4 stars): Was tasty! I liked the tomato sauce they used on the pizza, chorizo/egg/cilantro were a genius combo... But for $15, I think they could've hooked it up with a bit more eggs or learn how to spread the egg love a bit more. I'm pretty sure that there were only 2 eggs for the entire 6-8 pieces of pizza. \n\nDinner: \nSmoked Eggplant (1.5 stars): Was not that tasty. Eggplant was kinda chewy rather than soft, it was too smoked to the point that it tasted a bit burnt, and the marinara sauce was a little too overpowering for the eggplant.\n\nRoasted Butternut Pizza (3 stars): Not nearly as good as the chorizo & eggs pizza. The pizza didn't feel cohesive... just a bunch of ingredients thrown on top of the pizza. But I do like chevre cheese, so I still managed to eat a few slices and pack a couple to go.\n\nFresh Spaghetti (2 stars): The texture and look of it reminded me of Chefboyardee spaghetti because the noodles looked really soft and the entire thing was really saucy. This dish was pretty salty, especially since it also has bacon in it. Overall I think it was just too thick, salty, and fatty for me... which was a bit misleading since the name sounds so refreshing.\n\nService was ok (better for dinner than for brunch). The back patio was pretty cute ... I would suggest eating out there if it's a semi-nice day. It's heated, and it has cute lights over the canopy.

I love their outside dining area, you are surrounded by plants all over the wall, the there is a tent which cover you from the sun so its not too hot. \n\nThis time i ordered their smoked fried chicken which came with a cole slaw salad and cornbread. Also ordered sangria. \n\nokay, i heard some rants about this smoked fried chicken, but in all honesty, it is NOT even all that at all! it had no flavor at all, the chicken wasnt juicy, the batter had no taste. i feel like its just regular fried chicken that has been left to cook longer to give it a darker color. Popeye's and KFC chicken tastes better than this, and this is a disapointment. it needs to be seasoned well, what i bit into was nothing but flavorless. \n\nnext is the cole slaw salad which had slices of raw jalapenos. ok, the taste salad dressing is good, but adding raw jalapenos to it was not a good idea at all. a cole slaw is supposed to be a refreshing cold salad to eat. Because they added raw jalapenos, those jalapeno slices made the whole salad taste like i was eating raw chillies and mayonaise. The jalapenos were OVER POWERING in spice that i did not enjoy what is supposedly \"refreshing cole slaw\". but they should have done was, make the jalapenos into smaller bits instead of slices. it was just a wrong combo, i ended up picking out the jalapeno slices one by one. and dont get me wrong, i can eat REALLY REALLY SPICY food (Thai spicy from Thailand kind of spicy not american thai spicy). lol \n\nmoving on folks, to the cornread.. i thought it was a bit on the dry side. i think it needed more butter and or milk. it would have been great if they did a jalapeno and cheese cornbread instead of a tasteless dry corn bread. \n\nOkay so i had a bad experience by choosing the wrong meal for me.. Absolutely no biggie. Like i have mentioned before, i have been to this place several times before, and such foods like their Pate will keep me coming back for more. \n\ncheers :)", "author": "Steve S."}

The balsamic-honey glaze gives it a hefty dose of sweetness to cut into the grease combo of bacon and oil.

It had been recommended to us by a number of people and the place was jam packed, so we had high hopes. We sat outside on the front patio because there was no wait and it was a nice day. We ordered the basic farmhouse egg breakfast and the Sunnyside Joe.\n\nThe farmhouse breakfast was very plain (as expected), but it lacked any type of distinctive flavor. It was extremely boring and dull. Even for eggs and potatoes, the meal lacked discernible taste.  The Sunnyside Joe was a bit better, with nice flavor coming in from the onions and spinach, but overall was not as good as it could have been. Given the same ingredients, I could have done better at home. Starbelly needs to step up its meat game in these dishes: the farmhouse dish had fatty undercooked bacon without much flavor and the Sunnyside Joe used groundbeef that didn't add any flavor or dimension to the dish. The service was friendly and helpful, if a bit slow, but overall no problems.\n\nOverall, we did not enjoy our meal as much as we enjoyed people-watching on the corner at this spot in the Castro. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. We could have made this meal better at home for a lot less money.", "author": "James B."}

The food is so tasty!  I absolutely love so many of the items on the menu.  The menu does change for lunch/brunch week/weekend and also seasonally.  Not to miss:  The Starbelly Burger, The Starbelly Salad, the brussel sprouts (dinner only!) and don't forget to save room for dessert!  If you order the burger (as I often do....) ask for a side trio of their special aioli!\n\n2. The ambiance!  How cool is it that their bar/community table is actually an old \"lane\" from a bowling alley?!?  The outer patio, the inside dining area - and bowling lane dining are three different \"feels\" in an overall spacious dining area for San Francisco standards.\n\n3. The people of Starbelly!  Yes, I saved the best for last!  The Starbelly staff are all so delightful - I will tell you about my favorites.  First, there is Robin Rodriguez.  I believe he is the owner/manager of the place.  He is just friendly and accommodating in every way.  (I dine here at Starbelly often) and one time there was a brand new hostess in training who greeted me.  I had a reservation - and she didn't know me as a \"regular\" client.  She told me there would be a twenty minute wait (even with a reservation?) and I was NOT happy about that!  She asked if I would like to speak with the manager - and I said, \"yes.\"  Robin recognized me, greeted me, apologized for the misunderstanding - and sat my table right away.  He even gave me his business card and reminded me not to hesitate to contact him for any reason.  LOVELY and cordial!  I have been in the restaurant several times since, each with yet another pleasant experience.  The day shift hostess, Jordana is just delightful.  She has a radiant smile and also a super sense of fashion!  She is sweet and always makes me feel like a VIP.  There are also:  Nick, Niles, Adam, & Francesca!  Each of these wonderful Starbelly Superstars is a hard-working, friendly, efficient professional.  \n\nDO NOT hesitate to stop in for a late lunch either!  I keep a mental list of ALL the restaurants nearby that will actually serve lunch between 2pm and 5:30pm.  NOT many, by the way, but Starbelly is always happy to see me - even if I come in for lunch at 3pm.\n\nHooray Starbelly!  thank you for your wonderful food, ambiance, and service!

I recommend that you try to attend on a sunny weekend morning, warm enough that you might be able to sit outside on the back patio.  The inside is nice too, but I think that it is more appropriate (and intimate) if you sit inside for dinner meals.\n\nService:  Never one to rack on service, I find this to be the main reason for a -1 for Starbelly.  Yes, they serve you your food and drinks graciously, but some of the servers for the dinner/night shift have been particularly aloof as to simple manners.  This has not been the case, however, for daytime waiters and waitresses (and I don't really know why).\n\nFood:  Some is very, very good; some is impeccable; some is just okay.  I particularly recommend the home made chicken liver pate or the levain french toast.

Not tripping over myself to come back anytime soon, but it was a lovely meal in a great setting.\n\nSaturday 8:30p - holiday weekend and it was not crowded. Seated immediately.\n\nWine selection was extensive & fabulous, mostly in the $35 - $45 range. The cocktail list looked very yummy too.\n\nMenu... I actually didn't know it was pizza/ flourey stuff dominant (later found out owner has Delfina links). We opted for something simple - Butternut Squash dumpling, Starbelly pizza and the toffee cake.\n\nThere were moments of brilliance...\n- Dumpling was DIVINE. Dumpling skin was like a wonderful al dente ravioli skin. The filling was balanced sweet, savory. Brown butter with a hint of heat from fresh black pepper. Score.\n\n- Toffee cake! Reminds me of butterscotch pudding. I am a sucker for anything caramel/ toffee notes and it was warm, gooey, tinge of salt. Brilliant\n\n\nNot so brilliant was the star of the show! I suspect the Starbelly Pizza spent a bit too much time in the oven. It was strangely very crunchy with very little chew. If this was the intended texture, then it's just not my preference. The topping was very nice and balanced though.\n\nIn my world this is a hung jury. Let's see if I have another chance to come back.", "author": "Joyce L."}

I was a little surprised to see two not overly large scallops.  They were really good though!  Our table also shared the bacon and jalapeno pizza, which was not spicy, but very tasty.

One reason we picked this place was we weren't set on the time to meet up and this place makes a policy of only reserving up to 50 percent of their capacity. A definite plus for folks wanting to go out last minute and have a reasonable chance of getting seated. We decided to share everything and ordered a bunch of appetizers and a couple of mains.  Split pea fritters, starbelly salad, smoked trout, and white bean puree on flat bread.  All very yummy, I think my favorite of those was the smoked trout.  Then we also ordered a burger and the spaghetti.  Burger was good, though I am pretty picky.  I liked the brioche bun they used, and the spaghetti was standard fare.  The restaurant also sports a decent wine selection and the waiter seemed pretty knowledgeable about the various wines they had.  Overall quality of the food good, the service very friendly and the prices reasonable. We sat out on the patio and it was quite enjoyable.  The dining areas overall are very nicely done.

The only thing we liked out of the several dishes we ordered was the pate. But when we ran out of bread with about 2/3 of the thing left, we didn't get more bread until we were almost done with our dinner. Super slow service! Friendly, but incredibly slow. At least the bread refills were free..\n\nThe spaghetti was just spaghetti. I can make tastier, more flavorful spaghetti than that. The pizza had like 3 pieces of chorizo and fresh cilantro (who can't make that either?). The squash salad was terrible. I couldn't eat more than one bite because it tasted like raw squash. The pork belly was rough and chewy with some odd flavors/sides that didn't really blend. \n\nParking is terrible. It took us around 20 min to find something. Some jerk also took a knife and carved out a ton of paint on my driver side door, which made the situation worse. \n\nSpend your money elsewhere. If you want pizza, go to Papa John's.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-11-18", "description": "Before going to a show yesterday, hooked up with a long time friend and we ate here.  I must say, Starbelly's a charming little social restaurant that's pretty well priced with very good friendly service.\n\nSince my friend made the arrangements with Startbelly to assure that we could get seats (thru an apparent 45 minutes in advance phone reservations available option), the logistics of eating here was pain free.  Also to my surprise, if you eat here at around 7pm, there's plenty of parking around.  I wasn't too far away.  Coming from the East Bay, I was expecting that the biggest problem would be finding parking, but twuzn't the case.\n\nAs for the food, the liver pat\u00e9 was very good.  It comes with toast and two interesting sides of French seeded dij\u00f3n mustard and minced carmelized onions.  What is cool is that if you put the pat\u00e9 on the breads and top it with the carmelized onions, it can almost play a joke on the palette and taste like peanut butter and jam!  Sounds weird I know, but if you're a pat\u00e9 lover, you won't be disappointed with this side (5 stars).\n\nThe salad wasn't that great.  It's the kind of salad where you can not pick it up with a fork and requires skill just to put it in the mouth.  Besides, no tomatos or salad charm to be that great (only 3 stars for that).\n\nNext we split a....I cannot recall what it was called....but it was essentially a meatball that wasn't meat but outshell fried texture meatball shaped thing that had an inner explosion of cheese.  It was very delicious, but I have to doc off one point because had it been steaming hot, it would've been perfect.  Unfortunately it was only warm on the verge of luke warm. ( 4 stars)\n\nThe Cabernet I had here was pretty lousy considering it was $9/glass.  It tasted like a cheap Merlot (2 1/2 stars)\n\nFor the final dish, the waiter recommend that goat cheese and butternut squash pizza.  It wasn't spectacular only because a normal pizza with tomato sauce, mushrooms, garlic, and pepperoni would've tasted better.  But, it was interesting.  Guess I just wasn't ready for something that adventurous or maybe I was full from the appetizers.  One positive is that this place definitely mastered the texture of the pizza which was perfect.  Just would've tasted better with a more traditional pizza topping.  Note to self: next time I come here, try a tomato sauced based pizza. (4 stars)\n\nAll in all, it's a 3.75 star place that I don't mind rounding up to 4 stars.  This place could even turn into a 5 star place, but it's falling into that trend of SF restaurants that cooks with too much sugar or honey or some kind of sugar based flavoring.\n\nA word to Chefs: sweet is ok in dining, but if the eater notices the sweetness, that means too much was added (case in point: the minced onions with the pat\u00e9).\nPortions were very good here.  2 drinks, 3 appetizers, and pizza split between two people's gonna cost around $80 which is pretty reasonable for SF. (5 stars on price).\n\nAll and all, Starbelly's a viable place to eat at in the Church/Market St. neighborhood.", "author": "Tony U."}

My god, are those propane heaters (suspended precariously overhead) turned all the way up?  When I overpay for dinner, I expect a modicum of comfort.  Call me crazy.\n\nStar belly did not provide this.  Unfortunately for them, hardship during dinner does little to improve one's palate.  Remember the Donner Party?  Yeah.  They got so cold they didn't realize they were eating EACH OTHER.  With that being said, I don't remember much of the meal.\n\nThe things I do remember, are less than flattering.  Our waiter, a young peppy Filipino chap, was generally flippant and unresponsive.  When I asked about the \"Lonza\" on the charcuterie plate, he declared it was, \"Good.  A little fattier than other meats, but house-made and delicious.\"  It was, in fact, not delicious. It was 90% fat, 10% lean; exactly the opposite of what a lonza stagionata should be.  House-made or not, it tasted like crap.\n\nThe mussels were pedestrian and unimaginative.  Fresh, but slathered in an oily \"house-made\" chorizo (suddenly the most ubiquitous meat in San Francisco), jalapeno and cilantro.  Zero imagination.\n\nEven the pizza failed to live up to expectations.  Squash, sage, and pepitas (another omnipresent SF menu item, as chefs ride out their Fall gourd stocks), sounds a whole lot more interesting than it actually was.  The crust was overly salted, the flavor profile unoriginal.\n\nIn fairness to Starbelly, the arctic temperatures are out of their control.  However, proper heating elements and placement is certainly not.  If you, as a restauranteur, book reservations and seat people in an outdoor environment, their relative comfort is a primary concern.  Heat deprivation does nothing to enhance my appreciation of your restaurant.  Rather, it gave me ample opportunity to focus on the other aspects of the dining experience that I didn't like, elements that no doubt I would have overlooked had my tootsies been warm.\n\nSo, will I try Starbelly again?  Most probably I will be forced to: my girlfriend loves this place.  But next time?  I'm wearing fucking electric socks.", "author": "Sean O."}

I didn't know much about Starbelly except that if Heather had chosen it, then I am in good hands. \n\nWalking in, I was immediately impressed. Starbelly is a cute, bright and airy neighborhood restaurant in the Castro.  A long wooden bar that also serves as the communal table is the focal point of this eatery; along with the display of wine bottles neatly stocked up in the contemporary wooden cabinets on the wall by the bar. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J7_-faNq_Ag9qTOlDn81Pw?select=BdleQIOwww3ee8d3HJARww http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J7_-faNq_Ag9qTOlDn81Pw?select=bZu__fPGDD5M3C7Q-6RYNw\n\nI caught a glimpse of al fresco dining at the pretty wooden patio in the back.  Heather and I opted to seat at the casual 2-4 seater table with metal chairs in the main dining area. \n\nThe whole place has a casual and cheery feel to it. Service was friendly and very efficient. As soon as we sat down we were given a choice between regular or complimentary bubbly water. We chose the bubbly, nice touch!\n\nOnce again, Heather and I ordered family-style to be able to enjoy and \"critique\" each dish. \n\n1. CRAB LOUIE SALAD: Since it is the very beginning of the crab season in San Francisco, we thought it was best to try this dish. And we were rewarded with big chunks of sweet Dungeness crab meat on fresh lettuce wedge and not overpowering dressing.

SQUASH THIN CRUST PIZZA WITH GOAT CHEESE AND PEPITAS: I love pumpkins and squash but I was not so sure about them on pizza. At first bite this pizza put away all my worries. I thought that squash, goat cheese and pepitas on pizza would be a brave culinary attempt that could easily fail but this was a well executed dish. The result was a harmony of earthy fall flavors on a thin crust. The pizza was nicely grilled and slightly charred (but not burnt) in the wood-fire oven. A delicious autumn dish! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J7_-faNq_Ag9qTOlDn81Pw?select=48ZW8X4GOVcEDWDb8ZQfrw\n\n3. FRIES WITH 3 DIPS: Uneven cut fries. 3 dips including ketchup. Nicely salted. I've had better fries but these were nice fillers. They give you a lot! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/J7_-faNq_Ag9qTOlDn81Pw?select=e7YtXlHDsaXNJr8NCmW8yQ\n\nThe dishes at Starbelly are seasonal. The chef makes use of fresh ingredients. They are most delicious in their simplicity but combinations of flavors are amazing and refreshing on the palate.\n\nOnce again, Heather and I had a wonderful \"girl-bonding\" lunch in the City in the midst of our very busy work day.

The food was OK, but the hostess left a lot to be desired and really left a sour taste in our mouths. \n\nI'll revisit this review if the customer service improves.", "author": "Natalia B."}

Starbelly sits in the heart of Castro and it was poppin' even on a weekday night.\n\nWe tried a selection of cheeses, charcuterie, and other nibbles as starters.  Round it off with some nicely tossed salads and an assortment of pizzas (bacon, margherita, and mushroom).  All were good, but I was really itching to try dessert that night!  The dessert selection of salted caramel pot de creme (my favorite), rosemary cornmeal cookies, toffee cake, and rice pudding were good enough to satisfy any sweet tooth.\n\nFor any company function, the highlight of the night was the necessary consumption of the most expensive bottles of wines and Starbelly has an excellent selection!  My favorites were the Malbec \"Maucho\", Casa Patronales and the Cabernet Blend \"Borderlands,\" Desperada.\n\nOverall, this Starbelly is a solid choice for a get together, but none of these food items kept me drooling.", "author": "Kathleen W."}

The staff is all friendly and the atmosphere is trendy, hip, cool, etc.   They even have a romantic covered patio in the back of the restaurant.  \n\nFor starters, we ordered the burrata di stefano (with cherry tomatoes, basil, grilled bread) .  Of course, let's face it, when is burrata not delicious?  For my main course, I ordered the albacore fish plate which was decent, but I would try something new next time.   I actually don't think it's on the menu anymore (they seem to change it often).  Anyways, dinner was going pretty well up to this point....\n\n...until.....we decided to order a pot de creme for dessert.  A small spoonful of the salted pot de creme caused my taste buds to have a dance party.  But the best part was that it came with rosemary cornmeal cookies that you can use for dipping.  The rosemary combination with the salt and the carmel creaminess created an amazing moment in my life.  I never wanted that moment to end, so after basically licking the bowl, we ordered another pot de creme.  \n\nAfter a good dinner and two pot de cremes, we both left with a wide grin, a happy tummy, and new favorite dessert.\n\n\n\n\nFun fact: Starbelly was created by the same team behind the popular restaurants Beretta (mission) and Delarosa (marina).", "author": "Juliana K."}

When we went, the dishes that stood out were the chicken liver pate. It was sweet and did not have a irony taste.  The onion jelly worked well with the pate and the crisp bread.\n\nThe chirzo, egg pizza that we order was excellent. All the flavors worked well together. Who knew that a soft cooked egg on a pizza really works?\n\nThe entree that I had was the halibut with shrimp.  This was the most undesirable dish. The halibut was overcooked and dry. The shrimp was overcooked.  Yet hungry, I ate it.  Bad mistake. I should have sent it back for a new dish.  \n\nFrom this experience, I gather that the appetizers and pizza's are the choices to choose from the menu.

Our weird afternoon started with a \"must-try\" pizza from this fine establishment.\n\nThe layout and general decor is quaint and stylish with a hint of hipster, which is the case with many places in the area to be fair. The patio definitely takes the cake in terms of seating so aim for spot there if you can.\n\nWe chose the weird pizza, of course, and ended up with a beautiful presentation of chorizo and egg pizza ($15). However, even though I'm a fan of thin pizzas, I found the plate to be mostly crispy bland bread crust on the edges, rather than the actual flavorful center. In fact, I'd say 30% of the slice is just plain bread and 70% is the good stuff. The chorizo was a great idea but I wasn't so sure about the egg. It made the piece messy and undelicate, which is the opposite of what a thin-crust pizza should be.\n\nI hear good things about the desserts here but alas, they only serve donuts during lunch.

The ambiance, the food, the service, it was all on point. We dined on the back patio and with the heat lamps on in the evening, it was just right. \n\nWe ordered the white bean puree with eggplant as an appetizer, the bread that came with was the perfectly warmed grilled, yet soft with a slight saltiness type and the puree was smooth and quite tasty and even though I'm not the biggest eggplant fan, even that part was enjoyable. \n\nI ordered the asparagus and crab cream soup - nice light asparagus flavor, substantial pieces of crab. The only tiny dislike here was that the soup got cold a little quickly as we were sitting outdoors, I think it would be safe to assume that if we had been indoors, this wouldn't have been a concern.\n\nHe ordered the meatloaf, it was warming, hearty and brought back memories of childhood. \n\nWe shared the pate because he is a fan and I was willing - it's difficult for me to place judgement on this dish as it was only my second time having pate, but I'd certainly order it again if I was to head to Starbelly. \n\nSo, that all being said, food was good, enjoyable. \n\nThe service was attentive but soft-spoken in a charming way, from the host to the waiter to the busser. All appropriate for a Sunday evening dinner. \n\nOne thing to note is that the spot is much larger than it appears as you walk through the front door - the patio out back is very substantial so don't miss out on a nice meal if, as you peer through the front window, it appears busy.

It was my birthday, and last night we wanted low key, and that's exactly what we got. The bartender was great, offered plain or sparkling water within seconds. I got an Apple Cider on ice (I guess ice is how they do it, so I had it the way they suggest). \nDining partner came, we instantly moved to a table in the rear of the restaurant, on the window side. I like it there cause its away from everyone, and you get a glimpse of the patio which promptly closes at 9:30PM. The lights were dimmed there, and we started our service. \n\nPizza and Brussels sprouts with bacon (sorry but you cant go wrong there, except the bacon was a bit over cooked, however, it did add a nice flavor and crunchy texture that Brussels sprouts usually lack, so I cant complain on that nor mark off points), and crab garlic pasta with garlic bread. The garlic bread was so good, I almost wanted a whole loaf, spread with melted cheese just so I could make my own pizza out of it. Hands down, it was the best flavor, crispness and quite honestly, not overpowering nor greasy. The crab pasta, fresh, had a little chewy pasta texture unlike Ive ever had before, not quite al dente style, not underdone or overdone, just so extremely fresh and cooked to perfection you actually got to feel texture wise what pasta SHOULD be! The whole thing was great, though I wish they could bump up the amount of crab in the dish just a little bit more. However, again, no points off and no complaints cause frankly, the flavor and texture made up for it. \nOur server was great, very attentive, not overbearing, she liked my Christmas light backpack - so thats instant points there, even if my backpack is tacky, and I know it is, compliments and smiles go really far for me in a restaurant. She was very professional yet welcoming and casual at the same time. Which I think makes an experience! Her water bottle trick, which I commented on, not a single drop outside my glass, was stellar!

It's an easy walk from my house, the food is decent, and service is ok. So when a bunch of my friends from back home came to visit, I naturally thought, hey lets go to Starbelly. \n\nSince it was kinda a last minute thing, I called them up on a Saturday morning and asked if it would be possible to seat about 10 people that night around 8pm. The first girl I talked to said it would be no problem, just to call 45 to an hour before and they would put my name in.  She also said she would let the hostess know that I was going to be coming in with a big party. So everything seemed good to go. \n\nI called about 7pm and the hostess picks up the phone, I explained to her that I had called earlier and wanted to come in with 10 people in about an hour or so. She had THE WORST ATTITUDE. She said, \"Well no one told me, I'm going to have to get manager approval.\" she put me on hold and when she returned she told me that they WOULD NOT seat me. I explained that I had called in the morning specifically to make sure that it would not be a problem. She then said, \"Well good luck with your night. Bye.\" and just HUNG UP ON ME!\n\nI was almost dumbfounded that they would treat me like this, someone who has brought thousands of dollars into this business and always talked highly of them. No matter what I thought of them before, this left a VERY SOUR taste in my mouth... \n\nThat night Rouge Ales Public House got upwards of $500 in business from our party alone.

In this case, a friend was in town and wanted to try Foreign Cinema, but I wasn't ready for a fancy schmancy dinner on a Sunday (good thing we didn't go, it was actually closed for a private event). He happened to be book shopping in the Castro so I searched for options nearby, and that's how we came upon Starbelly.\n\nI've enjoyed each visit to Beretta, so I was looking forward to a similar-ish menu and heard good-ish things about Starbelly. I knew beforehand that the reviews for this place were mixed so I wasn't expecting an outstanding food adventure, but something good. It was fairly open when we arrived and were seated easily. Really nice interior (loved the wood paneled walls) and an outdoor patio that I wasn't able to check out, but comfortable and inviting vibe. \n\nWhat we ordered:\nEnglish pea burrata crostini - there's a pea crostini at Beretta that I really enjoy, but I can't say the same about this one. Even with the addition of burrata, the crostini was fairly bland and forgettable.\n\nChicken liver pate with marmalade and mustard - the combination of pate, marmalade, and mustard was heavenly. Generous portion of pate as well that was well-shared amongst 3 people.\n\nMussels with chorizo - not a fan of chorizo in general, so I probably shouldn't judge this dish. There was also a sour flavor (perhaps lemon or lime?) that didn't really blend well with the mussels for me.\n\nWild mushroom pizza - not bad, but not great. Pizza at Beretta or even at Zero Zero is better.\n\nBeef burger with swiss cheese and fries - the fries were the actual star of this plate, but the burger was still solid.\n\nGlad I crossed this off my list, but I'll stick with the sister restaurant.

We sat out back in the patio area. It was a bit chilly, but then--this was also the coldest week in a long time. The coffee was excellent, and I liked that they gave you the option of still or sparkling water, gratis. \n\nMy party of three shared the margherita pizza with added eggs and arugula, the caesar salad, and the two eggs with bacon breakfast.

My girlfriend called ahead to put our name on the list.  We showed up on time and then were made to wait for another 45 mins.  I don't fully mind the wait but we literally stood waiting next to a vacant table for 45 mins and watched as no one ever was seated there.  At one point we inquired about the vacant table and the hostess told us it was reserved for someone else.  After the 45 mins passed my gf received a txt from the restaurant saying that our table was ready (despite the fact that we were literally standing right there).  The hostess offered us the table the had been vacant for 45 mins that we had already been told was unavailable.  I simply scoffed and should have known that this place was a waste of time but we sat at another table and had our meal.\n\nThe waitress was really uninterested and couldn't wait to leave our table.  \n\nWe had a good cherry and greens salad.  The one positive.  \nI had the pasta with jalapenos and bacon, it was meh.\nMy gf had the steak, it was overcooked and also meh.\n\nI think this place needs to re-evaluate things.  \n\nOh yeah, also the price of this meal was silly.

They had a cream soup with a stewed cherry on top that was the most unique pairing of flavors! Can't believe it took me a year to visit Starbelly, but here is what I ordered:\n\n- Lambrusco (one that NYTimes recommended but I couldn't obtain through the SF distributor without special ordering a case)\nI liked the pairing with my food. It tasted like a slightly carbonated sangria. It's not the most complex rose I've ever tasted (V. Sattui's Gamay is more complex) but it's definitely good for the price at $7 a glass.\n\n- Chicken liver pate\nTasted just as good as foie gras.  It's made with 17 ingredients and was extremely fresh. The bread, grainy mustard and preserves complement this dish perfectly.\n\n- Pork Sugo\nThe handmade noodles were so soft, just like at Delfina!\n\nThe prices here are totally reasonable such that most could go frequently.", "author": "SiliconValleyShoeGirl L."}

Went to Starbelly for the outdoor seating and relaxed ambiance. Wow was I pleased. I called about 45 minutes before I wanted to be there and was able to get a reservation for two (this may not work for larger parties). We did not wait to be seated once we arrived, this is a big plus for me considering the number of places you go to that still make you wait 30 minutes despite a reservation.  We sat in the back patio, the area was clean no flying creatures in site, heat lamps were in abundance around the dining area. Our server was pleasant and attentive. \n\n\nWe ordered the white bean puree, cucumber, chili oil and grilled flat bread to start. If I hadn't known it was a white bean puree I would have thought I was just eating hummus. The dish in my opinion had either not enough bread to go with the puree serving size or too much puree to go with the  two 1 inch triangular pieces of toasted bread. We went with the latter idea and asked for more bread. \n\nFor the entrees we ordered the  blackened catfish  and ranch burger.  The portion sizes of the entrees were good. The burger was perfectly cooked to medium rare. The Challah was fresh, soft and toasted. The burger was fantastic! great flavor. The fries were really tasty with the extra cracked pepper kick they added. \n\nAs for the catfish, who would have thought it would go so well with andouille sausage risotto! So good. The catfish was crispy on the outside but still had great flavor and wasn't dry.  \n\nAll in all it was a great dining experience!", "author": "Joel Z."}

I suggested that it would have been nice had the person on the phone had given me that information rather than saying \"we have space at the community table\" and then confirming our 8 reservations. Just a suggestion. That was the point it got weird and she got overly animated and smiley tilted her head and very fake nice and in an uber obvious super  fake way said...

I called in for a last-minute dinner reservation for a party of two last night, and we got it without a problem. A college classmate and I had a tasty dinner while catching up, and we enjoyed ourselves immensely! \n\nWe shared a plate of Dungeness crab hush puppies with Louie dressing - you have a choice of having 3, 4 or 5 of the hush puppies so we opted for 4 - it's nice to have that choice. She had the pizza with asparagus and hard-boiled eggs (looked yummy!) and I had the Ranch burger with house-cut fries & pickle on a grilled sesame bun - I added roasted onions for an extra $2, and it was juicy and delectable! I had a large Anchor Porter (nice, smooth local dark beer) and then a small one a bit later (good times!). \n\nWe shared a salt caramel pot de creme - heavenly! We were so full before dessert, but we just couldn't help ourselves, it sounded too good to pass up! \n\nReally nice, attentive service with a very cool environment. I easily arrived on Muni and took the F Line home. Lovely, just lovely! \n\nShared small plate+hamburger+large & small beer+shared dessert+tax +tip = $40 (not bad, not bad at all!)", "author": "Maile N."}

Starbelly was not my first choice, but after being thwarted at three nearby eateries we threw in the towel.\n\nThe solemn truth is that everything tasted fine, but so solemn that the meal was hardly one to yelp home about. We had dungeness crab salad which was too bland, a wrought-iron mini-pot of pan roasted mussels with cilantro and chorizo and chile which was definitely not bland, and a generous serving for the price. The pizza with mushrooms and gruyere was okay-definitely filling, but not a memorable pie. A side of brussel sprouts was okay-not the best and perhaps under-roasted. The dessert-a salted caramel pot de creme-was the answer to my prayer to be more than whelmed. It was divine, with a perfect rosemary cornmeal cookie to scrape that salted caramel cream right out of the jar. Interesting and fairly priced wine by the glass selections so we toured the vino world to fly away from this milquetoast dinner. A glass of Malbec, then a Cabernet Sauvignon from Paso Robles were my lifeline, with that dessert, of course.\n\nService was great, and put a positive spin on just being whelmed-not overly attentive nor negligent. Just there. I'm not surprised that this place is owned by the same people as Beretta and Delarosa. There's something just lacking from both of those places in terms of both soul and substance, and a bit too overwhelming on 'style'.

We were expecting to wait awhile given how packed the place was, but we were pleasantly surprised. For dinner, we had one of the pizzas and the burger. The pot-de-creme for dessert. It's often difficult to manage expectations when you're eating at a restaurant that is also a bar -- you expect a better drink selection (which Starbelly features), but the food isn't usually that great. I was definitely wrong. This was high-quality food. The burger was probably one of the best I've ever had, and I LOVE burgers.\n\nThe place does get a bit loud, so don't eat here if you're looking for a quiet dinner. Eat here if you love fine food!

It had been about a year since my last visit, which, as I remember, I enjoyed somewhat.\n\nIt was embarrassing. With all of the really wonderful restaurants that WANT you to dine with them, Starbelly doesn't seem to understand that concept.\n\nThe service from the hostess was minimal. She mumbled something about \"This way...\" and then started through the restaurant so quickly, we had to jog to keep up. She pointed to a table on the patio and then turned and walked away, ignoring my question of which table she wanted us to sit at. Still not sure, we sat. Just in time to have a waiter come by and tell us we were at the wrong table, and he rushed off. Still not sure where to sit and never having been asked if we wanted to sit outside (especially when the interior had only 5 tables full and plenty to spare), we left. The hostess didn't even look up from her station as we walked by. Nobody seemed to care one way or another.\n\nWe strolled down to Barracuda Sushi and were treated with respect, warmth and stuffed full of terrific food.\n\nWhat really confuses me are the myriad of 4-5 star reviews for this restaurant. Are we visiting the same place? Do the staff suddenly change as I walk through the door? Is it me? Is it imperative to show up drunk, or get drunk quickly upon entering? Are the folks writing these rave reviews, just too embarrassed to admit they sat through a horrible meal and actually paid for it? I really don't get it. \n\nWell Starbelly needn't give another thought as I wouldn't darken their doorstep for the winning ticket for the Super Lotto!", "author": "Doug W."}

Most of us had burgers on the brain but then we saw that they had fried chicken on the menu we all pretty much made our decision.\n\nThen our waitness came back and apologized and said we had the wrong menu, and replaced it with another that was missing the fried chicken and a few other items that sounded tasty. I guess it went downhill from there.\n\nRegardless, we ordered some fries and bread to sustain us and some mulled wine to warm us up while we reconsidered the menu. Nothing catastrophic here, just some annoyances that put us further down the disappointment spiral. \n\nFirst, we all got carded when we ordered mulled wine. We're all over 30, which I guess is a big compliment, but it got kind of weird when one of our 5 didn't bring her ID and then the waitress had to mull it over whether to serve her. I fully understand the implications of servers risking their job to serve underage people, but all I'm saying is that it didn't help our motivation. Second, the mulled wine was $9 a glass and literally was 3 sips. More like a wine taste vs. a full pour. Led to instant banter on the staffs' concern we would get drunk because they didn't believe our ages therefore deserved a sip. The wine was also served in a wine glass so it became cold instantly. Pretty much a miss there.\n\nWe also ordered bread, which came with 3 small pieces and a few ladles of olive oil. It was $2. Again, not a big deal but there were 5 of us, and it would have been nice for each of us to get 1 piece, or at least told we should probably get 2. Again,  I'm not expecting free breadsticks and salad here, but it's a bit of a cheap move. The fries were fine, and they came with a few dipping sauces which were good. \n\nI guess we just simply couldn't recover from the loss of the chicken, then the small snafus that followed. I would like to return again to really try the food and give this place a proper chance, but won't be soon. I'll get my mulled wine elsewhere in the meantime.", "author": "Kelly R."}

We both commented about the fact that there were not many people there, so having a leisurely lunch would not be a problem. I specifically told our waitress that we wanted to take our time, and to please NOT bring one course out while we were enjoying another. She assured us that that would not happen. I was only halfway through my pate course when our fried chicken sandwiches were brought over. I did say that I had specifically ask for that not to happen, and was told that they would be sure and not bring the dessert out while we were eating our sandwiches. A cold dessert would not have been a problem anyway. They could have taken the sandwiches back, but really didn't care. If I had been eating the salad, it would not have been as much as a problem, however eating the pate with its accompaniments didn't work, while eating the fried chicken sandwich. They also just handed me the plate, and I had to take it in my hand, and move everything else around. I quickly tried to eat the pate and move on to the sandwich. The fried chicken sandwich. I guess to not lose money on this deal, they had cut the chicken extremely thin. So thin and small that it was hard to find underneath all of the slaw. The sandwich was mostly slaw and roll. In addition to this, I had ordered a side order of fries, asking if they could be extra crispy. I was assured that they could be, but they were not. I did not want to seem as though I was complaining in front of my friend, so I said something to someone on my way to the restroom. He asked if I wanted another order, but I turned him down. They did end up bringing a bowl of still not crispy fries to the table. I took them with us, thinking that I could leave them for a homeless person after that. After all of these problems, I still left a very generous tip. I foolishly gave more consideration to the people at this place than they gave to me.

It was over a half hour until we got our food (I KNOW it doesn't take that long to wood fire a pizza and it wasn't that busy).  Good thing we had a lot of catching up to do with our SF hosts!  \n\nWhen the pizzas came (let me be clear, TWO of the THREE came together, the third took an addition TWENT MINUTES - is this a joke???), they were delicious, despite our having messed with the \"specifically designed\" flavor pairings (lol, still can't get over how yuppie that was).  \n\nI should also say that the tables are very close together (but who are we kidding, it's San Francisco, EVERYTHING is close together!), and that if someone near you orders the pizza that was \"specifically designed\" to be smothered in gruyere cheese, you will spend the remainder of your meal wondering if your eating partner removed his/her dirty gym socks nearby.  Ick. \n\nBOTTOM LINE: The service was below average, the food was good, but not good enough to return.  If you're living in or visiting a foodie paradise like SF, you can do better.", "author": "April C."}

We were seated in the back patio, practically on top of another occupied two-top, which we thought was odd considering there were many other open tables.   Back patio is very nice, btw.\n\nAppetizers: french fries and chicken liver pate.  The french fries were not great: we got the dregs -- a basketful of just tiny chips of broken french fries.  The chicken liver pate was served with toast, spicy mustard and onion jam/jelly, which they called \"marmalade\".  It was good, although ordinary.  \n\nAfter we finished our appetizers, we waited THIRTY minutes for the mushroom/gruyere pizza and the applewood smoked chicken breast.  As we were just about to ask our server to bring us the check for just our appetizers so we could leave, our entrees finally arrived.  My dining partner didn't like the chicken at all.  And although I also thought the smoke flavor was a bit overpowering, I didn't think it was that bad -- but it wasn't great.  The mushroom/gruyere pizza was HORRIBLE.  It was literally dripping with grease and the crust was a soppy, soggy mess.  Very unappealing.  Just way too much cheese --  couldn't even taste the mushrooms, onions or artichoke hearts at all, the cheese was so overpowering.   Note to staff:  go easy on the cheese.  Although I love gruyere, a little goes a long way...\n\nOn the way out, we walked through the main dining area, which had filled up by the time we finished our meal.  The \"vibe\" inside is nice, if you like very loud.  It's a big, open room with lost of hard surfaces.  There a couple of big, very long tables which would be shared with other diners.   There are also a few two and four tops scattered around.   The overall atmosphere, to me, seems to be an overly self-conscious attempt to be hip and trendy.   \n\nBill was about $70, not including the tip.  We had no drinks or wine.  $70 is simply too much for less-than-mediocre food when there are so many wonderful places to eat in the city.", "author": "Johnny G."}

Mary Tyler Moore over Rhoda, All in the Family over The Jeffersons - you know how it is.  But in this case, I am a much bigger fan of Starbelly than of this group's original restaurant, Beretta.\n\nI had lunch there with a friend a few weeks ago and it was a great experience.  Starting with the friendly service, and a large and well thought out beer list, I immediately felt the casual,down-to-earth vibe of the place.  We were on the same page.\n\nWe started with a bowl of beautifully roasted padron peppers with olive oil and sea salt - perfect in its simplicity.  Followed by the chicken liver pate, which was smooth and tasty with a thin layer of fat for extra flavor, it was off to an excellent start.\n\nFor our mains, we shared the porchetta sandwhich and the oyster poorboy.  Poor oyster poorboy was a little bland, but the porchetta was very tasty.  Made in house and slow-roasted in the old world tradition, it's a great way to treat pork and lends itself well to a sandwich topped with 2 different salsas and nutty arugula.\n\nDessert was pretty good - a pot de creme and 2 cookies, but I think there is some room for improvement here.  i will happily go back, sample some more desserts, and report back.\n\nThe decor is light and cozy-modern, with a nice outdoor space in back.  Lots of room at the bar, too.\n\nIn a neighborhood where the old standby restaurants seem a little bit  dated and worn, this is a welcome addition, and I look forward to my next visit.", "author": "Liz S."}

My waiter  did warn me about this but I decided to give it a try.  I then had to flag him down and  I asked him to replace it with something similar to a blue moon.  He chose delerium tremens which was good but for $10 a bottle I would  have preferred  a blue moon  for a few dollars  cheaper.\n\nLiver Pate-  Really good and highly recommend with an awesome relish.  Only problem is when they gave  the dish the server said let us know if you need more bread.  There were five of us there  and they only gave 4 slices  of bread so immediately we had to ask for another slice of bread.  \n\nPersimon, duck porciutto frisse salad-  This was a huge disappointment.  Only 4 of us ate this  and my portion was a a shaved dime size piece of porciutto and persimon and 3 frisse leaves.  The flavor profile  was good but not great and portion way too small.\n\nSpaghetti-  This portion was  good  but  the spaghetti was good but not great.   The ingredients and pasta were  fresh but I prefer more al dente  thinner pasta.  The bacon was good but I wish they made it  more like my mom's carbonara style with beef  egg onions and mushroom and cheese.\n\nChorizo  pizza-  Highlight  of the meal.   Great  chorizo  sausage nice and spicy  and I liked the runny egg.\n\n\nButternut squash Pizza with goat cheese-Had some  from the table  next to me and it was  great as well.\n\n\nEnglish Toffee  Pudding Cake-  Great  but way too  small  to share  value was poor.\n\nCreme de pot-  Rosemary  Ginger Cookie and Creme by itself were good  but together the  rosemary ginger cookie overpowered the creme.   \n\nOverall  the food was  great and I would definitely come here  again for the liver pate and pizza  but  the other dishes were either not memorable or lacked in value.

Not here...or at least not last night.\n\nI arrived first (of 2) and the water guy asked if I wanted Still or Sparkling. I took Still and told him I didn't know what my friend would like so he left both bottles.  Friend arrived and Waitress (Elizabeth) comes by and grabs the first bottle of water and chugs his glass full (no inquiry of which water he wanted - so why bother offering two types?)\n\nWaitress was instantly ready to be taking our order. Geez, we had barely been seated and hadn't seen each other for at least 2 years (dining out is a great venue for people to connect). I understand that waitstaff folks earn a lot of their income from tips and table turns are important (how many times have we all read this?). Rushed from the get go and Elizabeth's agenda was already getting in the way of my attempted Dinner Experience.  So all of that is a ONE Star.\n\nWho in this City serves a poor burger? Medium means NO CHAR but that's not what I got. No inquiry about the food. Sometimes you just have to let it go.  Oh, and my fries were the bottom of the barrel. I had to nestle around to find a fry longer than 1\".  That's a ONE Star too.\n\nThe check came and I gave her my CC (I didn't look at it because it is what it is and I can't see without my glasses). When she returned with the bill to sign, I saw (with my glasses on to give her the tip) that it wasn't our check. Accidents do happen but barely an apology. She seemed annoyed I had noticed as this added more time to occupy the table. Or, just more work for her. \n\nAs a Gift, I still left her 20%. I know it's an expensive City and we all have bills to pay...but said waitress just felt plain down and out GREEDY to get her tips.\n\nIt's a nice restaurant (despite the constant dimming of the power surging lights over the table - will they never address that since their beginning?). The Hostess was very pleasant and accommodated my last minute table request. But there was NO Experience to be had here.  ...and that is about a FOUR Star (but sure not enough to pull me back).

Doesn't shine as brightly though when compared to other trendy comfort food competitors across the city.  Probably the type of place that can become a local favorite once you know what to get and what to avoid on this uneven menu.\n\nPopcorn Clams: Just the strips, not the whole belly.  A lighter batter compared to the dense shell you'll get at most seafood shacks.  Appreciated the herbs in the coating.  Was digging the Old Bay remoulade... always good to see Old Bay being embraced!\n\nCrab Fritters: More like crab-flavored fritters as it was pretty light on the actual crab meat.  Too bready for my tastes and dry without the dipping sauce.\n\nCheese Plate: A good selection of local cheeses.  What really struck me was the care put into the accompaniments.  We're not talking a simple sliced pear... how about preserved kumquats, honeyed pistachios and huckleberry jam!!!  \n\nRotisserie Chicken: Not necessarily better than anything you'd get Safeway or Boston Market.  Soft and tender, but could use more flavoring and/or some sort of innovation on this boring standby.\n\nLamb Chops: The two lamb chops were great: perfectly seared with medium rare on the inside.  I don't think there was much seasoning on it, but it really didn't need it.  Was disappointed in the cheese grits since they were pretty bland and reminded me of plain polenta.\n\nPorchetta: Roli Roti has ruined me since I expect restaurant porchetta to just as good as street porchetta.  Sadly I found the meat section too dry, the fat section too chewy and the skin overly crisp.  The salsa was a nice touch, but acted like a mask rather than an enhancement.\n\nBrussels Sprouts: If only parents learned to cook this way, you'd have fewer domestic disturbances involving finicky kids.  The leaves were braised so the outside was crispy while the inside was chewy.  It wasn't overcooked so you avoided the nasty sulfur taste.  And the bacon, wow, love the big pieces.\n\nCaramel Pot de Creme: I'm all for salted caramel, but they took this to the extreme.  My blood pressure must have jumped a few digits after all that sodium!  The creme itself was enjoyable, but tasted more like butterscotch than caramel.

The restaurant is located in the glorious Castro on 16th, not too hard to find... definitely quite busy and popular so reservations are a must. Upon checking in, our wait time wasn't too long for the table but the space is very small so be prepared to be sitting close to other tables... you can definitely hear other conversations so if you are looking for a romantic spot- this probably isn't the best choice... Atmosphere and decor has that hipster trendy vibe to it....   Our server was awesome- super personable, funny, and attentive. She was prompt with our \"first course\"- maple bacon doughnuts and our bubbly! The doughnuts were very tasty and I recommend starting with one or two to share at the table (don't spoil your appetite!)... However, the main course seemed to take awhile and what we all ordered should NOT have taken that long to cook. We ordered the Starbelly Pizza for the table to share and it was SOOO good, definitely a must!! However, the smoked salmon scramble my bestie and I ordered to split was ice cold. NO BUENO! We sent it back immediately and they probably just re-scrambled the eggs so it wasn't really super great. My other friend had the basic egg/potato/toast dish and she seemed to like it and another friend got the margarita pizza subbed with burrata cheese and some sort of italian meat, can't remember which one... It looked a little oily to me but that could have been from the meat... Again, at least for me, the Starbelly pizza was the best- the green goddess dressing and bacon really complimented the pizza so well! Good crust and right amount of sauce and cheese.... I definitely want more soon!\n\nSide note: Two of my friends kept complaining about some fish smell, perhaps from their fish tacos? (it was before we ordered our meal)...

While solid options to start off the day, I'm a breakfast guy through and through - so no first quarter meal is complete without eggs... which is precisely why I ended up ordering the fried egg sandwich. This baby is nothing like what your momma used to make, it's a modern twist on an American classic. It comes open-faced on an artisan bun, with thick ass Starbelly bacon (some of the best I've had since reintroducing it back into my diet) and two-year aged cheddar. Couple that with some home fries and a breakfast salad of mixed greens, goat cheese and cheery tomatoes... and you've got yourself a pretty respectable first meal of the day.\n\nOne thing that kinda chaps my hide is when restaurants advertise \"brunch,\" when it's simply breakfast on a Saturday or Sunday morning. I understand it's special because Starbelly isn't typically open in the a.m., but it'd be swell if there was some kind of incentive like bottomless mimosas or something. A singular price for multiple rounds of bubbly is my idea of a Sunday brunch, but maybe that's just me.\n\nWhile on the topic of adult beverages, they have some pretty creative concoctions available for your drinking pleasure. Stuff like Mexican beer and tomato juice with a chili salt rim, Starbelly Shandys (beer and lemonade), Pimm's Cups and sparkling wines with a shot of vermouth. All are definitely worth a try, if you're down for some day drinking.\n\nThe atmosphere is pretty cool as well. It's not a hectic greasy spoon type place, and it's also not overly bougie either. They make great use of the sky lights above, creating a very casual and comfortable setting. The tables are a little small, and the communal table can be fun (granted you get seated next to some cool people), so try not to order too many different things at once, as it gets a little bit cluttered.\n\nCan't wait to try dinner sometime!", "author": "Ruggy J."}

Awesome beer selection. \n\nWe came here around 6:00pm on a Friday and it was not terribly crowded (although we were there early). We sat at the communal table which was a refurbished bowling lane, really cool. Waitstaff was so nice and friendly. Sort of a hipster vibe although in the Castro.

We get there and the hostess says it'll be 5-10 mins to be seated at the community table. Well 20 minutes goes by and she finally takes us to our seats, the ones that have been vacant and ready since we got there! But alright, not a big deal at least we are seated. So then we both decide to order the Sunnyside Joes and we were both extremely disappointed. The only thing I could taste was metal from the metal pan it was served on. It had absolutely no seasoning or flavor. So we ordered something else, (feeling bad because we hate too waste food but that dish was awful) I ordered the Banana and walnut French toast because you can't go wrong with French toast, right? Wrong. My French toast was cold, along with my bacon and I literally got one end piece of a banana on it. I had to also ask for a napkin, silver wear, syrup and more water. My boyfriend got the chicken and waffles because we noticed a lot of people ordered that, but his chicken was very dry and his waffle was burnt! He too had to ask for syrup and coffee and water refills. And it wasn't only us, the people next to us had to ask for their silver wear, more water and syrup too! \n\nI don't know how this place is Michelin recommended. Terrible food and bad service. I've eaten at a few Michelin starred restaurants and never have I had an experience like that. I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND this place to anyone. There are plenty more and far better restaurants in the neighborhood.", "author": "Karissa C."}

Mind you, while our waiter appeared to be entertaining his friends who were just finishing up their meal at the table adjacent to us.  Then a bit more endless waiting, and to top it off.. we were told that our pizza was delivered to another party by accident and that another one was being made immediately.  \n\nThe waiter did seem somewhat sincerely apologetic, and did give us a complimentary custard but he should have been paying more attention to the other tables than leisurely focusing his immediate attention on his friends.. at our convenience.

Still need to work out the kinks.\n\nThey have seating up front, an extended bar with community seating on both sides, and a patio out back.  Nice ambiance.  Open kitchen.\n\nStarted off with the pulled chiken, jalapeno, and endive slaw sandwich.  Sounded wonderful in concept.  However, execution left a lot to be desired.  The chicken, jalapendo, and endive was drowning in mayonnaise, so much so that one could barely taste the distinct ingredients.  No hint of jalapeno flavor whatsoever.  I mentioned to the waitress that they may want to scale back on the mayo in this sandwich, and she said she's heard that from a number of people.  Then change it Starbelly.  Nobody orders this sandwich for the mayonnaise.  Let the stars shine, and don't drown them!\n\nThe fries accompanying the sandwich were pretty good, and the (presumably) house-made ketchup was fantastic-tart yet sweet.\n\nNow then, the star of the meal was the squash and sage, black garlic, fresh goat cheese, and toasted pepitas pizza. This was a bit of a revelation, with unexpected flavors--bright highs, and deep lows--finished off with the crisp pepitas.  Might take a bit of getting used to for some, but I enjoyed it.  A tad oily, but other than that, a winner!\n\nService was friendly, unobtrusive, but fell a tad short in not offering anything in recompense for our unhappiness with the sandwich.\n\nI may return for the interesting pizzas, or for brunch or drinks.

I've had red hawk before which was good. The hard cheese (which I can't remember what it is) was really the best out of the three types. It came with some wheat bread (although I'm trying not to eat too many carbs) so I ate most of my cheese with the pear slices. It also came with some really good toasted almonds and pumpkin seeds.\n\nOur next dish was the chicken liver pate which was the best out of the evening. Very savory and just melted in your mouth. It came with some really great caramelized onions and bread (more carbs!) which just sealed the deal. It also came with some handmade mustard but we didn't touch it since it was alright and failed to comparison to the caramelized onions.\n\nWe finished the night with the roasted octopus and some baked crab thing.\n\nThe octopus was cooked just right and a good size portion. It also came on top of a really good chickpea salad (highly recommend unless you don't like octopus).\n\nThe crab dish looked like it was baked in with some egg and cheese or something in a baking dish and served with bread (again!?).

I enjoyed my experience a lot and I must say this is my new favorite American/Italian eatery in the entire city. \n\n------------------------\nThe Details:\n------------------------\n\nFood - \n\nAppetizer #1 - Housemade chicken liver pate, buttered bread, sweet onion marmalade, and grain mustard\n\nOh so good. Given the fact that I usually do not order pate, just the combination of the various components of this dish worked well together and provided a great start to our meal. The sweet onion marmalade was especially delicious. \n\nAppetizer #2 - Housecut fries with three dips\n\nGood, but typical fare that you can find at most modern American eateries in the city. Nothing special here. I must admit I do not remember the dips offered to us and maybe that is all that is needed to be said.\n\nEntree #1 - Pizza margherita with burrata and basil \n\nStrictly based on a comparison with the same dish at Beretta, it was practically the same (with maybe Beretta slightly better). The burrata was still very creamy and complimented the rest of the pizza ingredients well. \n\nEntree #2 - Fried chicken (i apologize, but i don't know any other further description given that the item is not listed on the online menu)\n\nThe fried chicken was really, really good. I normally prefer the dark meat of chicken based on its moistness. On this occassion, however, I have never tasted such moist and tender white meat in a fried chicken meal. I was initially reluctant to order this dish because I had more than my fair share of failed signature fried chicken dishes all over the city.  \n\nService - \n\nIt was good and sufficient for a lunch meal. The wait staff was cordial and polite and I have no complaints. \n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my lunch at Starbelly. This place was so tasty that it made me appreciate (and maybe even order) dishes I usually don't care for, such as pate and friend chicken.

It was as busy as you'd expect for early-ish on a Wednesday evening, which is to say, not very.  Nevertheless, they stuck us in a dark corner, even after we requested another table.  The other table wasn't reserved or anything, and they sat other couple at it minutes after we sat down.\n\nThe food was pretty meh. We got three small plates and a mushroom pizza to share.  Small plates were: fried calamari, sweet pea fritters, and the grilled sardines.  The calamari was delicious - by far the best dish of the night.  The fritters were way too overcooked for the lightness of the insides.  Almost tasted burned.  And the sardines were two whole grilled fish, each roughly eight to ten inches long.  They were surprisingly pretty bland and awkward to eat.\n\nFinally, the mushroom pizza.  Undercooked and bland - not much more to say.\n\nThe desserts were good, though.  We shared the toffee cake with mascarpone, and the salted caramel pot de creme with rosemary cookies.  The bf thought the cookies overpowered the pot de creme.  Both dishes were delicious, though.\n\nThe beer is quite good, as well.  Very impressive list of both draught and bottled.  It took our server forever to notice that we needed more drinks, so we finished our second beers well after dessert was done.\n\nThe service was pretty poor.

The food is amazing and I love the decor of this place. The patio is amazing place for brunch as I have sat there 3 out of 4 times I have been there. It's wooden and reminds me of sitting in someone's backyard if they were rich, earthy, and eco-friendly.\n\nI've had 3 of the pizzas here. \n1. My favorite was the seasonal butternut squash pizza with pinenuts and goat cheese. The crust was perfectly thin and crispy. The ingredients were all super fresh as well. \n2. My second favorite was the bacon pizza with arugula and the special \"goddess sauce\". Yes this sauce deserves to be called \"goddess sauce\" because it was a delicious mix of herbs with a lil kick to it. My favorite thing about this restaurant is everything tastes fresh because they use local ingredients (I think). The arugula totally balances out the bacon in sweet carb harmony.\n3. The third pizza I had was the gruyere mushroom pizza. While it had a thin crispy crust - the usual components to a good pizza, the cheese was overpowering and a lil runny ? Pass.\n\nMy other favorite here was the sunnyside Joe's. mmm. This bad boy comes in a skillet so it stays nice and hot the entire time. The ground beef, cheese, spinach are cooked into a skillet, and then topped by 2 sunnyside eggs. When you eat it you slice your fork and let the yolk ooze onto it, mmmm drool. The beef is super flavorful even thought it's just ground beef. The spinach and cheddar do a nice job balancing the dish out. \n\nI'm not a huge cocktail person, nor am I one to drink before noon, but I always manage to have a Pim's cup when I'm here. It's refreshing and the perfect summer drink. \n\nI just moved out of SF and I'm already missing this place :*(", "author": "Grace Y."}

We oder one of the top bottle of wine from your menu, and expensive dishes. We were not there to save money...\n\nIn the past I suggested starbelly to friends. While I will see them during these holiday season, I will make sure to let them know not to visit this place again, as they don't really care about customers.\n\nThe overall feeling was that as our table was mess-up from the very beginning the waitress didn't really care about us any-longer . She was probably thinking we were not going to tip her, or something.

We were completely appalled and were not sure how this happened.  Not wanting our broccoli to be cold when our entrees arrived we politely asked the waitress to please bring it back to the kitchen since we wanted it as a side with our main course.  As far as I know that is the definition of a side.  From that point on our waitress was no where to be found.\n\nSomeone else brought the other courses. The pizza was ok, but I felt the crust was not charred enough.  It tasted doughy to me.  My pasta was interesting, it had jalape\u00f1os in the sauce, which was just plain weird.

Even on an 80 degree Saturday in September (around 7pm), we were lucky enough to get a table right away (though the restaurant remained packed the rest of the night).\n\nThey don't have a full liquor license, but they get pretty creative with the cocktails: \n- Starbelly 75: Like a French 75 but with a ginger kick. \n- Champagne cocktail: prosecco and bitters, probably my favorite. \n- Pimm's Cup: pretty and pink, fresh with cucumber and basil.  \n- Calimocho: cool presentation, served in a Mexican coke bottle.\n- There was another champagne cocktail with some orange in it, which was also good (can't remember the name now)\n\nAnd they have house sparkling water, which I love.\n\nOnto food..\n- Chickpea fritters: like very crunchy falafel, nice and salty\n- Albacore tuna: seared, pink in the middle served with cucumber and avocado, light and good for summer\n- Seared raw beef: like a carpaccio, loved the summer fruits on top (the meat itself was well seasoned, too)\n- Burrata and heirloom tomato on crostini: loved their burrata, and this was probably the favorite starter\n- Chanterelles: lots of flavor, topped with a small amount of cheese - this would have been great with crostini or over polenta\n- Fig, blue cheese, arugula pizza: definitely add the serrano ham!  Thin crust, served on a high platter, good combination of flavors\n- Prather Ranch Burger: with white cheddar, and we added an egg, which made it much better.  I actually really liked the challa bun since it soaked up lots of flavor but wasn't too heavy.  Fries on the side were ok (needed a bit more salt for my tastes, but I also enjoy way too much sodium)\n- Pork sugo: served over baked polenta with lots of cheese.  The flavors reminded me of a lasagna, and it had a comforting, hearty flavor. This would be great on a rainy day.\n\nDesserts:\n- Warm toffee cake with medjool dates in thin dried strips, mascarpone.  This was the favorite dessert, though I think ice cream would have made it even better than the mascarpone cream\n- Salted caramel pot de creme: not as rich as I expected, loved the rosemary cornmeal cookies!\n- Humphry Slocombe ice cream: jalapeno bacon.  Not really spicy or smoky, but salty and sweet, which was good.  I'm not sure what happened to the jalapeno and bacon, though.\n\nIn the end, for 3 people, it was about $75 per person after adding in tax/tip, which wasn't too bad considering how much we ordered.  The menu has a good variety, so there's something for everyone. The space isn't huge, but it can accommodate moderately sized groups, especially out back on the patio. Parking wasn't too bad on 16th street.  Even though we got lucky, I would recommend getting a reservation.\n\nStarbelly is not a place I hear a ton of hype about, but it has a strong following for a good reason.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

Do they sound like crazy people?  Do they complain about the inherent nature of humanity in unreasonable ways? Do they assign stars in a manner inconsistent with their own narrative?\n\nReally?  I cannot give much weight to a review from someone who complains that a house-made, well-executed $9 quinoa burger is overpriced because it didn't come with enough sides.  You are either 20, regularly eat at Subway, or both.\n\nStarbelly is transcendent.  Meltingly perfect pate with onion jam so good, I asked if it were available for purchase.  It was not, but our ever-kind waiter filled a pint soup container and packed it up for us gratis. \n\nWe ordered other small plates.  Butter lettuce salad was clean and lightly dressed with perfection. Also fantastic were the pumpkin dumplings with brown butter, sage, lemon, and goat cheese.  My other half does not eat goat cheese and I asked that it come sidecar. After the dish arrived, our kind waiter spotted the cheese on top which we hadn't noticed.  Rather than taking it away, he left it for me to enjoy, apologized, and said he would bring another order out as requested. So thoughtful.\n\nAlso great was his recommendation that we forgo the pork shoulder we chose and opt instead for the pork \"sugo\", a shoulder stew with mozzarella over polenta.  He shared that since we were sharing, it had more pork to enjoy and was a more unique dish.  \n\nA salted caramel pot de creme with savory-sweet cornmeal and rosemary cookies were a perfect finish. This was perfection. Again, the waiter steered us to this over the equally appealing arborio pudding with smoked almonds. \n\nWine and beer selections were thoughtful and interesting.  Prices were very reasonable for fine food in SF, and the service could not have been more gracious. We had 3 'small' plates which were not that small, 1 entree, 1 dessert, and coffee, plus 2 drinks and the total was $90  Are you kidding?\n\nEven the positive reviewers for this place say, \"It's great for Castro.\"  Get over yourselves.

I have never experienced anything like this in 10 years San Francisco dining.  Starbelly's staff was unable to handle a very small group of unruly customers, who through their obnoxious hand clapping, one-upping shouts of \"ole!\", and attention-calling clanking of silverware with glassware, had ruined the dining experience for over 60+ patrons in the restaurant, who were previously enjoying a decent dinner.\n\nAfter 15 minutes of futile conversation, the six of us had to request the check and pack our food in the middle of dinner!!!  The wait staff was well-aware of the situation, and management had several opportunities to remedy the situation, but offered nothing but profuse apologies and paralysis.  We left the standard 20% tip anyway on the $200+ mid-dinner bill, but it was not deserved.\n\nFor a restaurant of this caliber, I would expect this type of situation to be managed.

What came to my table was a lukewarm, average-to-bland pie with tiny, tough little arugula leaves scattered on top, and then too-thick slices of American prosciutto strewn on top of that.  \n\nTo me, if you're going to serve prosciutto on a pizza, it needs to be thiiiiiinnnnnnn enough to bite through.  I don't need to be gnawing the ham off the slice or forced to chew an entire piece of prosciutto with one bite.  And why in the world would you not put the meat down on the hot pizza, then add the arugula on top.  You want the prosciutto to get a little heat from the pie more so than the arugula.  This feels like a pizza made by somebody who doesn't care about pizza.\n\nMy companion's spaghetti with bacon was ok, but oversauced and a little too sweet.\n\nWe started with dungenees hushpuppies which were also served lukewarm, undersalted, and a tiny portion for the price.\n\nInterior is nice, service is quick and good, but I was disappointed by  the lukewarm, bland food.", "author": "Kevin S."}

That's fine, your word against mine, but if you're not into the customer is always right thing, at least be nice about it.  I might go back, but with so many other great restaurants in the city and even within a couple of blocks of this one, I may skip it.", "author": "Nicole D H."}

The fried oyster salad with bacon and tomatoes was really good, as was the dry pan-roasted muscles. The white bean dip was okay. \n\nThe cod brandade was a bit of a dissapointment for me, probably because I did not know it was going to be really creamy mashed potatoes without enough cod flavor for my clumsy palette to detect (spouse could taste the fish and loved it - go figure).\n\nOur waiter and the serving staff seem to care about what they serve and our series of dishes came out quickly. They are open pretty late, which is still a challenge even in the Castro. I also appreciated their good use of space: in a small area, they have maximized the table space without jamming everyone together.\n\nI would give four stars except for the price: for that much money, I expect pretty damn good, so it is just above average (3.5 stars). If I end up trying their patio seating, I will probably bump them up to four.", "author": "Richard H."}

Starbelly is not known for it's pies and with all the recent additions in San Francisco as of late, Starbelly is lost in the crowd and you never hear anyone ever mention them as being one of the best. Well they are. Again, very simple thin crust Italian style that include your traditional favorites such as the margherita which is outstanding.

The blue cheese and fig which I believe is seasonal, so if you see it on the menu SNAG THAT SUCKER!\n\nAnd another overlooked little piece of Heaven. The burger! Everyone these days is trying craft a kick butt burger. Starbelly has mastered the perfect burger! Sure Marlowe gets the pub, but Starbelly can hang with it.

First there was confusion over our drink orders, since my first, second, and third choices from the \"on draught\" beer menu were unavailable.  we did get free tastes of Red Seal (not on the menu), which made up for it . . . and the friend's original beer order, which we didn't realize had gone through, also eventually made its way to the table.\n\nWe then confused him by ordering the beets and endive to start, with him only hearing the beets part.  I took charge and clarified this later, so it was again all good.  All told, we shared the roasted beets, endive dish, calamari, and butternut squash dumplings.  The calamari was amazing, and the curry mayo inspired.  I messed up by not realizing there was goat cheese on the beets until too late; we asked for it on the side with the butternut squash dumplings.  Unfortunately I am very sensitive to goat, so my manfriend happily relished the beets - he says they were good!  The endive was enjoyable.

The entire operation was quite smooth from making reservations (good availability on a Saturday) to food.\n\nFor starters, we ordered the split-pea fritters. The fritters themselves were very crispy and not greasy at all. The seasoning was a bit off and the bitterness of the splitpeas were a bit too pronounced. The curried yoghurt dipping sauce was clearly the best part - creamy, slightly sweet, tangy and savory. The starter was good and crunchy with a nice sauce, but otherwise unremarkable.\n\nWe both ordered the burger (mid-rare) with bacon and cheddar. Overall, the burger was excellent; the beefiness came through very well. The proportions of bun to patty were well chosen and the cook on the meat was about right. The thin shavings of pickles were well suited to complimenting the rich meat. The balance of all the elements comes together here. I'd come again just for the burger, but the fries were an excellent side - fried perfectly crisp and well seasoned, almost addictive with the burger.\n\nThe service was quite attentive, despite the bustling atmosphere (packed to the gills). We never waited long for anything and even at the end, the service was reasonably fast.\n\nUnfortunately, the atmosphere is the weak point. The tables are awkwardly placed and the cheap aluminum frame seats really don't fit in with the wood features along the walls. The spacing between the tables also doesn't quite make for the most comfortable experience.\n\nThe pricing is more than reasonable and comes to around 20$ a cover when all is said and done.\n\nAn overall good experience.

The pizza crust was toasty and light.  I'm a   \nbig fan of crisp bacon and sadly the one on my pizza was not.  It still had delicious flavor, but was more of the soft ham texture than crisp bacon.

I wanted to see what all the fuss was about and finally got the chance to when I was in the hood.  I went here sans reservation on a Saturday night after The Little Mermaid Sing-Along at the Castro theater (another awesome thing you Yelpers need to get your butt to).  As expected, the place was brimming with folks.  There were about 3 big parties ahead of us and we were given a 30-45 minute expected wait time.  I usually hate waiting but decided to grin and bear it.  Luckily a space opened up at the bar and we were seated in 15 minutes flat.  Woot!\n\nThe space here is modern and warm.  It's not too small like most SF restaurants though they could use to put more bathrooms in a place that gets so busy.  The bartenders who served us were friendly - they offered us sips of the wines we ordered to make sure we liked it first before they poured the entire glass.  We ordered our food and vino pretty much within 5 minutes of being seated and within 15 minutes, our plates of food were presented to us in all their delicious glory.  Points for serving us quickly on a busy Saturday night, I turn into a monster if I don't get dinner in my belly by 10 pm. \n \nWe ordered the burrata appetizer, my friend had a pizza, and I had the fish dish.  The burrata was not the best I've had, but it was up there.  My friend's pizza was good too, but again not the best I've had either.  The fish dish had a creamy yummy sauce that made my hungry belly happy .  We ended our meal with an apple crisp sans ice cream.  Unfortunately they were all out of Humphrey Slocombe secret breakfast so we were a little disappointed - I think the crisp would've tasted better with it!  \n\nThe pricing is about as expected for a restaurant like this so I can't really complain about that.  Between the two of us we spent ~$80 for appetizer, wine, entrees, and dessert.  Overall, a great place to go on a date or to celebrate a birthday or anniversary.

We chose patio seating since it was finally a nice day in SF. Since it was nice I didn't expect them to have their heating lamps turned on, which was definitely a con.

I finished 1 glass before our salad even came out. \n\nWe ordered the Crab Louie Salad, which was extremely delicious. Romain salad lightly tossed in dressing. One egg. Cherry tomatoes.

With that said I have worked in the Castro for years and it can be a challenge but it can also be a blast. Instead of enjoying the community and their space it is just a turn and burn money making chain.\n\nFrito Misto: I have never had a bad frito misto in my life and I would have never thought it possible. It's like making bad french fries. It was made of the thinnest slivers of onion, tiny green peppers and carrots. Flaccid and super thin veggies. It looked pathetic and I don't know how you could possible remove the taste of an onion and pepper but it was flavorless and unseasoned.\n\nCrab Salad: I absolutely love love love crab and to drown it in a mayonnaise dressing was so very sad.\nThe frisee was so saturated it just looked like a white blobby mess.\n\nMargarita Pizza: The crust was way too thin in the center leaving the sauce and cheese to saturate to pool in the middle.", "author": "Gee C."}

And definitely not worth the wait and the poor service. I ordered a \"breakfast pizza,\" which took forever, and when it finally arrived, I was truly disgusted. I RARELY send food back; practically never, but this was not ok. The \"pizza\" came out with what looked like a completely raw egg cracked on top. I have no problem with an over easy egg; I'll even enjoy an egg sunny side up on occasion, but this was raw. Like cracked on top of the pizza, placed in the oven for a few minutes, and then brought out to our table as if I was honestly expected to eat it, raw. No thanks. When I asked the waitress to send it back to have the egg more thoroughly cooked, she argued with me about how it was \"supposed\" to be. \n\nI should have taken this as a sign and just written Starbelly off my list entirely, which we basically did for 6+ months. But no, I had to go and try to give them a second chance last week, which was a mistake, and we didn't even make it to the table. \n\nIt was one of those rare warm evenings in SF and my wife and I wanted to grab some dinner where we could sit outside and enjoy the beautiful weather. Starbelly, having rightly anticipated that this is what people would be after on such a nice night, decided to impose a prix fixe menu on anyone wishing to sit outside, at the cost of @ $25/person. To be fair, the menu they were offering looked great, but I just wasn't hungry enough to eat my weight in roast pig and mac & cheese. While I'm sure they thought this would be a great way to take advantage of the nice weather and make a little extra money, it just came off as a way to take advantage of their customers. Honestly, they would have been better off imposing a $10 surcharge per person to sit out back.  At least that would have been a more honest approach. \n\nWe left and went and enjoyed a wonderful dinner at Catch, just up the street. We grabbed a prime spot on their front patio - for no extra charge.", "author": "Natalie N."}

My friend and I were seated promptly in the outside (covered) heated patio as the restaurant was quite busy on a Thursday night.\n\nOverall, the food was good, but like previous reviewers have stated, its not \"knock your socks off\" worthy. The prices seemed a little overpriced (especially for the pizzas) but nonetheless the items we ordered (bread, burrata, and chicken pate) were flavorful. I must say the house made chicken liver pate was the winner of the night. Creamy deliciousness slathered onto a crispy buttered piece of artisan bread, topped with a caramelized, sweet onion marmalade and whole grain mustard... WHEWEE. Effin' delicious I tell you.\n\n-1/2 point for the server giving our food all at once knowing full well our table was too small to hold everything all at once. Literally, plates were hanging off the edge and it felt like we were playing tetris to make everything fit.\n\n-1/2 point for prices. Being a chef, I know I'm biased, but some of the prices are absolutely ridiculous. I know restaurants need to make a profit but goodness gracious.

She knew when to show attention but also keep her space, and I appreciated that. Overall, a really enjoyable dining experience.\n\nGood food. Great company.

It's a casual, loud-ish resto perfect for first dates, big groups, weekend brunches and rainy-day carry-out. The fact that we've been there 5+ times in 3 months speaks to the versatility of this joint.  The covered, heated outdoor patio elevates this resto's status in our books. (However, it closes at 9pm for noise reasons). Note that Starbelly does not take reservations for small parties, but you can call 40 minutes in advance and they'll put your name on the waitlist, and a table should be ready by the time you're there.  If not, the bar is pretty big and you can down some red-wine sangria while you wait (its sweet, but not too strong, so don't go overboard or you'll feel it in the morning).\n \nThe menu changes slightly throughout the seasons, but they don't always update what's on their website, so don't be surprised if they don't have something you thought they would.  Often they'll have a good enough replacement--for example, over the summer they had this awesome Fig and goat cheese Pizza for $14 (add prosciutto for $3--totally worth it), but now Figs are out of season and they've replaced Figs with Pears.  Liked the figs a bit more, but can't really complain.  We've heard of a weekly picnic that Starbelly hosts in the summers. Haven't been to one yet, but we're sure it won't disappoint.\n \nOther dinner favorites include House cut fries and dipping sauce; Spinach and pear salad; scallops; Prather ranch burger; Spaghetti w/bacon\n \nThe brunch is just as good as dinner. Favorites are the Chilaquiles, French Toast, Chorizo and egg pizza (available for brunch and dinner).\n \nStarbelly also has a good wine list and above-average beer selection. Our criticism is that most of their best dishes seem to have the same key ingredients: bacon, chorizo, pear, goat cheese. This place is good, but some menu innovation would certainly be welcome. 4 stars\n \n-A&L", "author": "AdamLowell C."}

Okay... we finished this in about 30 seconds and had lots of olive oil left over with no bread to dip in it.\n\n+Little Gems, Market Oranges, Raw Goats Milk Feta, Kalamata Olives & Shaved Red Onion: The cheese was very good, but the salad was not very flavorful.\n \n+Cornmeal-Fried Oysters: Small portion, slightly soggy, and (again) not very flavorful.\n\n+Seared Scallops: I forgot what came with these, but the dish was (obviously) not very memorable.\n\n+Starbelly Pizza (Starbelly Bacon, Jalape\u00f1o, Arugula & Green Goddess Dressing): I really enjoyed this flavors on this pizza.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-21", "description": "I have heard an inordinate amount of good things about Starbelly. Michael Bauer, the food critic for the Chronicle, rated their french fries among the best in the City. The Examiner gave it an extremely enthusiastic review back in June. SF Weekly wrote it up as one of their Hot Lunch places back in August 2009. So am I the only person in San Francisco who doesn't get it?\n\nAfter all the press, I expected to have a very hard time getting a table. I picked a cold, rainy October night to give it a shot and was able to walk right in the door. The waitstaff was kind, pleasant, but somewhat disinterested. After enthusiastically demanding to know our drink order (\"Have you decided what you're having to drink?!,\" he demanded, thrice, within a few minutes of being shown a menu), we were left to stew for 15 minutes with our food orders.\n\nThe menu itself follows a pretty classic San Francisco/Nouveau American tradition, namely seasonal food to include the following: pasta, roast chicken, hamburger, salad. All seasonal ingredients, of course. \n\nI had the duck confit with polenta, grilled mission figs, and a salad. My dining partner had the roast chicken, and we shared a side of the fries. The entr\u00e9e plates were huge: massive serving platters of calories. What merits this place a three stars is that much of it was tasteless. I expected a rich, dark duck, but instead got mostly gristle and fat. The skin was extremely greasy and oily. The polenta lacked texture and was very buttery. And the mission figs (all three of them! wow!) were all right. Frankly, for the richness of the meal, the salad was overkill and boring.\n\nAnd oh, the fries. What a fabulous letdown these fries were. After being praised so highly, I expected greatness from these fries. Instead, they were over salted and tasteless. And when I saw over salted, I mean it. They were disgustingly salty. A tremendous disappointment, seeing as how people in Belgium can turn out exceptional pommes frites in tiny shacks on the side of the road. \n\nFor all the praise, you'd have thought that Starbelly was in direct competition with Frances. And while I'm willing to grant an off night, this was pretty bad.", "author": "P Z."}

Luck indeed.  \nWe got one of the last small tables on a crowded Tuesday night and the incredibly friendly and efficient servers made us feel most welcome.  The small beer list included Trumer, my favorite Austrian Pilsner (now also brewed in Berkeley), excellent with the wonderful grilled Pimientos de Padr\u00f3n, a small Spanish pepper.  The salads were uniformly good, the day boat scallops perfectly cooked, rich and sweet.  I tried the special pizza with local blue cheese, mission figs, and prosciutto - a combination that went well together.\nA warm seasonal berry cobbler and deep espresso rounded out the dinner - this was a great way to start my SF sojourn.", "author": "Thor T."}

Like its sister restaurant Delarosa in the Marina, Starbelly decor is easy, modern, clean yet fun. Bonus is that Starbelly offers patio seating, lit and heated.\n\nWe were eager to try a few dishes:\n- Fritto Misto ($5): fried veggies, or rather onions, broccoli crowns, and lemon slices, were dusted with seasoned bread crumbs and fried. Served with an aioli sauce, I was happily delighted with the fried lemon slices. It wasn't bitter; rather it left a fresh lemon fragrance on one's palate.\n- Broccolini with Hazelnuts (~$6): A few stalks of tender broccolini were roasted with garlic seasonings and a light dusting of ground hazelnuts. I liked the unique pairing though overall the broccolini wasn't as impressive.\n- Pizza - Starbelly bacon, jalapeno, arugula & green goddess dressing ($13). This was a combination of savory from the bacon and complementary bitters from the arugula leaves, but evened out by the creamy basil dressing. Surprisingly good combo.\n\nWe really enjoyed the ambiance and food. Great place for a simple dinner but one that is just a step above the ordinary.

This is my second visit which was on May 3rd (nice hot night), both memorable but this one just was a show stopper.\n\nWe made a reservation (same day) and asked to be seating in the outdoor (covered) patio.  Soon as we arrived we waited only a moment before being seated. This might be silly to some to point out but I went to West of Pecos on Saturday and waited 45minutes after our reservation time!\n\nAt Starbelly, our server was so nice (Kyle), we are super chatty and he took the time to make conversation with us and explain the menu and comment on which food he liked best and why but also what other people find enjoyable. He also took the time to explain where the chef raises some of the food that they serve there. Overall he came off completely genuine and informative. You can alway tell when someone enjoys their job!\n\nWhat we ordered (there were two of us). 1 bottle of Sauvignon  Blanc - Le Grand Calliou, it was only $32 which is a steal as it tastes great and our server said it was actually a favorite of his. Then we started with the chicken liver pate($10 and so worth every bite). This was great! It comes with a generous amount of both pate and bread. Delish! Then we had the English Peas Crostini with Burrata ($10 I think... amazing), again amazing, two good slices and generous amounts of Burrata, perfect for two. Then we shared a pizza due to the recommendation again from our server. We ate the Starbelly bacon, jalape\u00f1o, arugula & green goddess dressing ($14). This was the perfect amount of food for the two of us who came with an appetite...we always do though.\n\nWe did of course have the most amazing and a top dessert in my opinion in SF which was the salted caramel pot de cr\u00e8me, rosemary cornmeal cookies ($6). Every bite is simply amazing and worth a review in itself.\nWe rolled out of there with a huge smile on our faces.\n\nAmbiance was great, noise level was perfect. \n\nThe servers name was Kyle and he was simply the nicest guy who took his time making sure we loved every moment of our visit to Starbelly! Someone give this guy a raise, bottle of wine, something!\n\nThis place is hands down a winner. I live very close to a Delfina's which was a favorite spot of ours now, this place is.

I'd been eying the menu online for a while and every time I walked past the place I wanted to stop in and have a glass of wine and a small plate of something yummy.\n\nAnyway, this was our first experience eating there. My husband made reservations, because we'd seen how crowded it could get, and headed to an early dinner at 6:30pm.  I was not at all impressed with the hostess, who barely looked at us, and when I asked her a question didn't bother to answer or acknowledge me.  That was disappointing.  Even though the restaurant wasn't full when we arrived we still spent upwards of 10 minutes waiting for someone to come by to get our drink order.\n\nAfter we did get waited on things definitely picked up.  We had a bottle of some lovely Argentinian Chardonnay, and split about every snack/side that was available rather than ordering full entrees.  The meat platter, and cheese platters were delicious, and had great flavor.  We shared a Starbelly salad, which had a nice peppery dressing, but what stood out the most to me was the Hominy Carnitas soup.  It was like eating an enchilada in soup form, delicious.\n\nWe had a very nice dinner, and during our actual meal we were waited on llke kings, but after we'd finished everything it took a while to get us out of there because no one ever wanted to come back and check on us.\n\nAnd while this has nothing to do with anything, I loved one of the servers who brought out our meat and cheese platters, she presented them with a \"it's a meat party\" exclamation, and she was very animated and fun.

The worst part of the night was the service, by far. Our hostess sat us down without giving us menus. She didn't seem to have the flow down correctly - she waited a very long time before coming back to us, and then there were 2 other servers we interfaced with. One of them was great; the other one seemed frazzled. The worst part, however, was the food runner. She was a younger looking girl with dark hair in pigtails. When she first came by to drop food off, she said, \"Will you move that?\" She was trying to get us to move dishes on the table around so she could drop off our mussels. I've never had a food runner blurt something out like that. The rest of the night, she'd literally drop dishes onto the table and she had the shittiest look on her face, like she was angry to be at work.\n\nWish I would've tried the pizza - it looked great. The mussels and chorizo were good, the broccolini was pretty good and the pork chop was a humongous hungry man portion - definitely better for splitting. \n\nThe sound level in the back area is deafening.

Mussels with jalapenos and chorizo.  This was aaamazing.  The mussels were fresh, and the slight hint of spiciness from the jalapenos coupled with the saltiness of the chorizo really went well with the mussels.  \n2). Half-rotisserie chicken with bacon asparagus salad and potatoes.  The thick cuts of bacon were soo hearty with the salad (in a great way).  The rotisserie chicken was moist and well cooked.  \n3).  Pork shoulder with cheddar grits, grilled pears, and greens.  It was a bit salty and burnt around the edges so I was not a huge fan of my entree.  All of the pizzas that were coming out looked so good that we had to try them soooo. after an exhausting Sunday Funday  traipsing around Dolores Park and the Castro, we came back the next night for dinner again and ordered...\n4). Mussels.  Just as good as the night before, but I felt like the order was smaller this time around.  However, we did ask for more bread to soak up all that delicious sauce.\n5).  Fried oysters.  The bff loooved these.  I am not a HUGE oyster fan, but still found these crispy treats pretty good.\n6).  Fries with three dipping sauces.  Ehh, I've had better fries before.  The fries were not super crispy, and could have used a bit more seasoning.\n7).  Pizza with starbelly bacon, jalapenos, arugula, wild mushrooms, and green goddess dressing.  This pizza was so freaking good.  The dough was fresh, thin, and crispy.  I usually don't eat crust, but I sure made an exception here.

The fries are some of the best in town.  The dipping sauces are good - flavorful.  But one of them is ketchup.  I think they need to do without the ketchup and add one with a bit more spice to it.  \n\nCaesar salad is good.  I would omit adding the sliced avocado and add some more lettuce.  Croutons are good, dressing is good as well.  More of a cream based caesar dressing as opposed to an oil based caesar.  Depends on what your likes/dislikes are.\n\nMargherita pizza is good, and I added the home made sausage to it.  The center of the pizza is a bit wet, soft and limp - whereas as you eat towards the crust, that is really where the \"oomph\" comes in.\n\nSalted Caramel Pot de Creme was awesome.  Not to much salt, not too little.  \n\nNo full liquor license, so they have beer, wine and some vermouth drinks.

I'd give it 4.5 stars, but the overall 3.5 Yelp!  rating leads me to top it off with the full five stars. \n\nFirst off, the liver p\u00e2t\u00e9 is worth a guarantee -- and I don't say this lightly: if you like p\u00e2t\u00e9, you won't find any better in the city or anywhere. I've had some dope p\u00e2t\u00e9 in my day (including at a French wedding), but Starbelly's has found the magic combination--slather a bit on their fresh toasted bread and top it off with a touch of homemade jam and mustard...and you're off to fatty, contented nirvana.   \n\nDrinkwise, I love the option of smaller beers -- I tried four beers at the equivalent of two pints and the price is right: $3 to $4 a pop. \n\nThe apps were great, though I'd avoid the scallops -- the lone over-priced offering at $14 for 3 tasty, but awfully tiny bites. The kale was salty in all the right ways and the split-pea soup as good as that dish is going to get. \n\nBoth my fianc\u00e9e and I and our friends had the chicken and risotto as a main dish, which definitely impressed and can easily be split between two people. We also got a mushroom pizza for the table, which we gobbled up despite being already well on our way to stuffed. \n\nLastly, the owner hooked us up with a pair of desserts and some Madeira (full disclosure: we were dining with two Marriott concierges), which was the icing on an already delicious cake. The service was very correct and the setting is top-notch, though a bit loud. Overall, we were thrilled with our experience and will undoubtedly be back for more.

On her last evening in SF, we took her to Starbelly.\n\nStarbelly, sister restaurant to SF staple Beretta, proved to be an ideal location for a cozy Sunday night winter supper. This resto, given its menu of Italian comfort classics with a contemporary and Californian spin, is constantly busy and bustling with small groups and couples filling the tables. The menu is easy to pick from and Starbelly offers a balanced selection of microbrews (draft and bottled - including one of B4F's favorites: Hitachino Nest White Ale), wine and non-alcoholic selections - just don't come here looking for liquor, spirits or Diet Coke because they don't have any.\n\n Our dinner for six consisted of the following:\n\nSalad: Little Gem Lettuce Caesar with Avocado & Starbelly Bacon ($6)\nArtisan Pizzas:\n    * Starbelly Bacon, Jalapeno, Arugula & Green Goddess Dressing ($13)\n    * Market Pear, Blue Cheese & Wild Arugula, adding Spanish Ham ($14+$3)\nPlates:\n    * Fresh Spaghetti, Starbelly Bacon, Jalapeno, Tomato & Basil ($11)\n    * Half Rotisserie Local Chicken, Warm Potato & Winter Spinach Salad ($16)\nVegetable: Cheddar Grits & Wilted Winter Greens ($6)\nDessert: Caramel Pot de Creme\n\nBacon, Jalapeno, Arugula & Green Goddess Dressing Pizza. Bacon's the shining star of this pizza.\n\nStarbelly Bacon, Jalapeno, Arugula & Green Goddess Dressing Pizza - The quality of the pizza crust is very similar to Beretta and the green goddess dressing was what really made the pizza memorable with its zesty flavor in combination with one o life's pleasures: bacon.\n\nSpaghetti with Bacon, Jalapeno, Tomato & Basil - perfectly sweet and tangy sauce with the spicy kick of jalapeno and the fattiness flavor from the bacon. Excellent swirl-the-pasta-around-the-fork capability.\nHalf Rotisserie Local Chicken - few places can make a chicken moist, savory and incredibly juicy and Starbelly hit the mark as  this chicken was definitely tender and well-seasoned.\n\nWhat stood out about this experience was the hustle and bustle of the overall restaurant, comfort food selections and excellent array of microbrews.. Starbelly is ideal for sharing a bunch of options a la family style and doing so kept costs bearable without breaking the bank.\n\nWould come back again but probably with a group of 4 so you can really share much of the food. What would I do without Beretta and Starbelly?! \n\nNo reservations - but feel free to call ahead and they may just put your name down before your arrival. Street parking.", "author": "Jessica C."}

There was amazing gazpacho, that I hope will return next year, and really good beer.  We didn't eat a full meal, for various reasons.  \n\nThe second was brunch.  There was French press coffee, an amazing open-faced croque monsieur, which was very rich.  Jack had very good French Toast.  (No, it isn't a French restaurant, although this visit was very French).  Our server was very nice and came to check on us enough, despite being quite busy.  We had a great time.\n\nThird, we had dinner! (Yay!).  Sadly, I don't remember my entree right now.  All I remember is the salted caramel pot de creme with rosemary cookies.  So fantastic.  We did sit at the bar, but were still well taken care of.\n\nMost recently, we went for drinks and dessert, after sushi at Domo.  Kindof a strange combination, I guess.  But Starbelly is close to home, and so it was more of a logistics thing, I guess.  They were very busy, and so we sat at the bar again, but this time at the \"non-dining\" end, which is made up of 6 seats for those who just want drinks, mainly.  Our bartender took care of us, including comping my first beer, which was my \"second choice.\"  (First, I was told that the beer on tap wasn't quite ready, so I ordered another.  Then, he came over and told me that the beer was not going to be available, and that he would comp my beer.)  That was so nice! :)\n\nAnyway, much love to this place.  Additionally, I'll add that they do have outdoor seating, but have a strict curfew, as their resident-neighbors obviously have sensitive ears (and/or like to not have bar noise out their windows all night)...and I can't blame them...but the curfew is 9:30...not 10 or 11.", "author": "cyndi t."}

Too bad they didn't have the Apple Bacon Donut because the Cherry Cornmeal I ordered did not compare.\n\nI would love to see more breakfast options here since they only had three breakfast dishes and a whole lot of lunch items like burgers, salads, and pizzas.

Thanks to the fresh ingredients and simple cooking.   The food is typical, fresh with not over powering flavors.  We ordered the Mushroom pizza with white sauce on it.   It's okay.  Not too bad, but nothing to brag home about.  The salad was fine too.  My strawberry cooler is too sweet for my taste.  I had to keep adding water to it.  Over all the food is just \"okay\".  (BTW, they do not have much vegetarian option.  People seems to like their \"Bacon\" a lot.  Vegan people, forget it.   They got cheese and cream on almost every dish).  I wish restaurant like this can have more VEGAN and Vegetarian options.  \n\nThe restaurant itself is very lively and a great place to have a gathering.  They have a big table for party.  The heated patio is nice, but only open till 9:30PM.\n\nThe pricing is not too bad, but watch out for the San Francisco healthy tax.  You will need to pay and tip extra.  Our bill came out to be about $30 per person, which is on the expensive side, since we didn't order much food.  Just a drink, a pizza and a side.\n\nWill not go out of my way to go again.

The bartender was great: offering suggestions, explaining sources of menu ingredients and mixing up some pretty looking drinks of the alcoholic and non-alcoholic variety. Food highlights were the burrata with heirloom radishes, shaved italian hard cheese, olive oil and rock salt as well as the gruyere grits and wilted greens. The fried oysters with old bay aioli were good but not great. I always think I'll like fried oysters in po'boys but it's never what I envision. The scoop of HS 'Secret Breakfast' ice cream was perfect and the wine selection was more than sufficient.\n\nThe space is incredible. The patio out back was calling my name but it wasn't open (I will be back for picnic tuesdays). It's designed to the nines but the acoustics are pretty bad. We had to yell at the bartender to be heard and even then, we only transmitted about 2/3 of the conversation. \n\nAll in all, a good place to grab a glass of wine and share some small plates.

For the prices they charge and the hip vibe they try to emulate, there is little in the quality of the food that could even begin to justify either. (doughy \"thin\" crust pizza with over-salted sauce and bland pot pie, both of which, judging from their temperature had been waiting a little bit to be delivered) Then the Star or our Starbelly Experience, the waiter was clearly apathetic to us and much more interested in his other tables--the one's with bigger checks. Even so much as complementing a female patron on the softness of her jacket. (Yes, he touched the sleeve.) \n\nI can forgive late food if the server is at least pretending to be apologetic to make up for extenuating circumstances, but when he is the paragon of efficiency, attentiveness and exuberant charm with every other patron around us ... THAT is insulting. I didn't expect him to touch my jacket, but a little more focus and a simple, \"sorry about that guys\" and perhaps 10 mins. into the meal, \"hey i hope everything's okay?\" would've sufficed... but of course that would've taken away from the quality time with that woman's jacket. The people helping him, from the busser, to the expediter or other waiter had way more personality, professionalism and competence. \n\nHuge notes to MANAGEMENT for your STAFF: when serving people do not reach across the long table to serve or pick-up food.. It wasn't that busy tonight, walk AROUND the big table or is that part of the charm? Being handed plates like you're at some hipster cafeteria? OH and tell patrons that the hooks for the jackets are underneath towards the middle of the table, otherwise they risk touching the big wads of gum also stuck underneath the table. yup, definitely a caffeteria vibe.\n\nOkay, back to chuckles ... so clearly having written us off, when it came time to ask for our check, I had to wave him down and ask, \"Are you our waiter?,\" after staring at him directly in the eyes TWICE  after which both times he swerved to do busy work at other patron's tables. I wasn't mad about the late food.... but his ignoring us pretty much ruined the night. I'm sure in a weird way tipping him poorly only makes him a worst waiter, he'll continue to think that bigger checks = bigger tips, which does make sense, but really he should just learn that great service all around, regardless of the check size = bigger tips. \n\nStarbelly is lucky that it is popular, but its certainly NOT because of its stellar staff or impeccable food. My recommendation? If you absolutely do not care about the quality of your dining experience, then you have arrived at your premiere destination -- sit down and prepare to be underwhelmed. (this is my 5th time here in a few years and it has been consistently poor to mediocre at best) but then again, I didn't have a drink with my meal.

I didn't think you guys were coming, so I crossed you off. It'll be about 20 minutes before I can seat you.'\n\nWe'd arrived 10 minutes EARLY for our reservation, so we didn't understand why she'd think we weren't coming, but ok.

Other people came and put their names in, and the hostess kept telling us. 'You guys are next to be seated. You're next.' But then, she would seat other parties, people who'd come in after us. We were totally confused, especially because there were only 3 of us, and she was seating parties of 3 and 4 ahead of us. We kept asking her what was going on, and she'd reply, 'You're next! You're next!'\n\nAn hour passed. \n\nAn HOUR. Were we idiots for waiting? Maybe. But we really wanted to eat there, and, by that point, we were just being stubborn. And we were getting a huge, bitter laugh out of the hostess, who, by this point, had simply turned her back on us and pretending that we weren't there. \n\nFinally, a table opened up, and we were the only ones waiting. But it needed to be bussed. Did she bus it? Nope. She stood there, DOODLING, and waited 10 minutes for a busboy to finally come out and clear the dirty dishes. \n\nShe seated us, but apparently didn't tell the waitress that we were there, because another 10 minutes elapsed.

For appetizers on my last visit we had the burrata and salumi plates, which were full of sodium-rich fatty goodness.  I had the burger for dinner, which was really delicious.

Well, there's a book entitled \"The Sneetches and Other Stories\" that tells the tale of a species of bird-like creatures, some with stars on their bellies and others without. It forms the basis of discrimination amongst their ranks, and much hullabaloo follows entailing removing and stamping on stars. \n\nIt's apropos that this trendy eatery was deemed \"Starbelly\", for the decidedly hip flock and pack the tables from communal to two top. Askew Grill be gone! At this point in the game, its a battle between the neophiles and the epicurean cognoscenti, so naturally the wait is unbearable. And though the staff is cordial, the waiting area is wee. Benches outside would be nice.\n\nAs my dining partner, Oksana T remarked, the open kitchen plays like a Benetton ad; folks of every color bustle about slinging California eats like clockwork. Broken down into small plates, apps, salads, pizzas and mains, the menu caters to every level of hunger swimmingly. \n\nWe claimed the fried clams, soft and cornbread battered with mayo disguised as remoulade (yum, but add some zing to that dip), the grilled octopus on slaw (overly charred), starbelly salad with butter lettuce, goat cheese and cherry tomatoes (boring dressing, needs acidity), and the mushroom pizza with roasted red onions, gruyere and thyme (one dimensional). It's rare when I wouldn't re-order any dishes upon return as none were particularly outstanding, but the prices were reasonable and tasty overall. \n\nProbably most remarkable is the drink list, but surprisingly not because of their alchemy of the spirits (they only have an inherited beer + wine license). For me, 60% of the allure of a cocktail is in the art of its concoction, yet their \"all ages\" potions blow me away. Jasmine tea with lemon and sage, served in a coupe glass. Darjeeling tea with lime, basil and egg whites. I will forgo alcohol for creativity.\n\nIn conclusion, I prefer the moody, tipplelicious experience at Beretta though likely I'll pop back occasionally to see what's brewing. \n\n[3.5 stars]", "author": "Ligaya T."}

Like many, I was excited to see a restaurant with a decent pedigree enter the Castro. Quality food in the gayborhood was at hand. Well after waiting awhile for the hubbub to die down--well, it hasn't. I figured out the secret of calling 45 min ahead to get on the list (and wait 90 minutes or more) for a table at what is quite the hot dining spot.\n\nWell, two visits later, the word that most comes to mind when I think of Starbelly is uneven, especially foodwise. I've sampled elements of pretty much each part of the menu, and they ranged from delicious to just not working at all. The chorizo mussels were full of flavor, cooked perfectly, and generous, while the crab hush puppies were a bit more concept than delivery. The blue cheese, pear, arugula and ham pizza was dominated by the cheese, and the crust was limp and damp. The burger I had on my first visit was delicious, as were the fries. On my second visit, the lamb chops I ordered were very despondency's flavor, but so fatty that I think I only got about one or two meaty bites per lamb chop. (In that dish's defense, the generous portion of grits on the plate were amazing.) In all, the quality of the food seems to depend on what you order.\n\nThis was not true of the service; it was consistently good... not rushed, attentive, and friendly. Also, the servers seem to be well-versed in the nicely rounded wine list. Also the host really does try to get the patient in pretty much as promised.\n\nDespite the curse of their location, I hope Starbelly makes it.

I never had that feeling of being the burdensome large party from anyone who interacted with us.\n\nI really enjoyed the beer list and the Shandy (beer and lemonade), as well as the chicken liver pate, warm spinach salad and Starbelly bacon pizza with jalapenos and green goddess dressing.  We were all amazed at the size of the pate and the great mound of grilled bread with it.\n\nI was disappointed in the sardines though.  We expected a few little ones, but it was one whole fish that was hard to eat.\n\nI would like to go back during the day on the weekend and sit in the back with the covering pulled back.

They hired in staff that seem to care about good service and good food and take pride in their work.  And they created a robust wine menu with a nice smattering of wines to select from.  And finally, they put together a diverse menu with something for pretty much everyone.\n\nI would consider this a great place to go for a conversation or a date.  \n\nAnd despite my earlier comment related to proximity for me, it does have location, location, location going for it (centrally located in the Castro district).\n\nI recommend giving it a try and I betcha you'll like it.", "author": "Dennis H."}

If only that wasn't the best part of the meal. \n\nCool decor, nice ambiance, alotta of guys, but we are on16th and Market so what else could one expect. Went there for brunch and I have to say I was dissappointed. \n\nAs one last reviewer pointed out, they are new and like an awkward teenager. I can give you a little leeway in this area while the place finds its legs, but some of my issue are issues that will not change even once they have their stuff together. \n\nHere is my list of complaints\n\n1) Waitress that rolls her eyes when  you ask her for stuff, she was working the front of the restaurant around noon today if any management is reading this.  Multiple times by the way, it was as if we were bothering her with our requests and she did not know the menu very well. If it were my business I would give her the axe.\n\n2) Homemade catsup sounds good on paper, but honestly that stuff would be better served if you called it chipolte salsa. I am a catsup lover. I hate when restaurants do this to look cool. It never is good, anyone that loves catsup usually love Heinz.. Offer both. Yours is a dissappointment with my potatoes.  There is a reason why heinz catsup has a 60% market share in the USA. \n\n3. Food came out all over the place. I ordered their (delicious, a must order) donut and coffee for starters. 10 minutes later the donut comes out without the coffee. When I asked my server for my coffee, her curt response was, \"I told you the coffee is french pressed and has to steep\" she forgot that she had also said that it takes about 4 minutes and this was 10 minutes later. I ordered a side of eggs and they came out before my food did and were semi cold. My semi warm french toast , which is mediocre at best was supposed to come with fruit, it did not, I had to ask the waitress where the fruit was, for which she told me it did not come with any. I asked her to grab the menu, and of course I was right and she was wrong. Lastly I asked for my bacon to be extra crispy and it came out cooked medium and I had to send it back. \n\nWhat a dissappointment. Although the pizza smelled amazing. \n\nMy recommendation is drop the server, hire more hot chicks like the petite brunette at the door and get your food shit together. The place has potential.

We popped in here last night at around 6:30 with a party of 4 and were told our wait would be about 50 minutes. It was actually about an hour and a half.  They were fairly gracious to be honest, but the wait was interminable. There is not really a good place to just \"hang out\" here but we made it happen at the edge of bar.  I would note that our observation was that they have WAYYYY more two tops here so I'd suggest sticking to that dining size until further notice. \n\nOnce we were seated we really did enjoy perusing the menu, they have some awesome virgin drinks which we really appreciated with one of us on the wagon and another on antibiotics.  We started with the mixed peppers in olive oil and salt and they were fab. We also had the corn with marscapone which, while a small portion, was fabulous.  We also enjoyed the japanese cucumber salad and the muscles.  Of note, the salad is also very small, I'd share it with two people max.  The dressing on the salad really made the cucumbers pop! \n\nFor our mains we had the spagetti which was good, but perhaps a little too bacon-y for my taste.  The romano (I think...) beans with tomatoes were excellent as was the mushroom pizza.  Yum! \n\nOur waitress was a gem and was very attentive, which was hard given our packed in location at the community table.  She gets 5 stars for good service. \n\n\nAs we walked out of the restaurant at 9:15 pm I noted that a variety of tables had opened up so I would suggest hitting this hot new spot after the 9 pm time slot and you can avoid the never-ending wait that accompanies any new dining location.  \n\nAll in all I'm pleased that we have a nice, new local resto.  Given I live a mere 2 blocks away I'm sure that we will return and get to enjoy some of the other gems on the menu. The pate walked by and my mouth watered.

Highly recommended.\n\nHouse cut fries with three dips - The fries were made *perfectly* with a fantastic fresh potato, perfectly salted, and nice and crispy.  The three sauces were a fresh and delicious basil aioli, Old Bay remoulade, and a house-made catsup.  I'm not really a fan of catsup to start, and this was a little too sweet for me.  The remoulade and aioli were both fantastic.\n\nHeirloom tomato gazpacho with spicy avocado & basil oil was lovely, but under salted.  Once we added a bit of salt, it was fantastic.\n\nRoasted Mariquita Farms padron peppers, sea salt & olive oil - These were slightly undercooked and underseasoned, but overall they were very fresh and delicious.  I attribute it to the first night jitters.\n\nGuanciale pizza with wild nettles and parmesan - Absolutely delicious.  It's a flatbread style pizza with a cheesy and tangy sauce.  I liked it, my partner wasn't a huge fan.

Well I'm glad I did. \nThe decor is great, like I knew it would be (complete with my favorite communal dining table)...and the garden/dining area outside? Can't wait till it's open. They have some amazing \"art\" installations by Flora Grubbs and boxes filled with herbs, lettuce, tomatoes. I hope they're planning to use it in their food. \nMy friend and I decided to share a bunch of the smaller plates. We had the fries with three dipping sauces (only the aioli was worth dipping), mini corndogs (same mustard and catsup as the fries, boring), fresh corn with marscapone (too small of a portion!), butter lettuce salad with hazelnuts and figs (I hate blue cheese, but this was good!), and the heirloom tomato gazpacho with avocado (by far my favorite item of the night). For dessert we had the peaches with olive oil ice cream from Humphrey. Good combination, but a little on the pricey side for the portion and basically no preparation (this did not take a pastry chef to prepare). \nService was superb. I definitely think they've taken these bad reviews and worked out the kinks.

I don't know why, but when I think of the Castro, I think of things other than food: cheap and stiff drinks, cheaper and stiffer boys, and the awful 33 Muni line. But after going to Starbelly, I've decided that I need to eat out in the Castro more often (no pun intended, ew).\n\nI walked into the restaurant and immediately noticed that the decor is simple and modern, which is a nice change from the overall loud aesthetic that you get from most establishments in the Castro. Started off with a Pimm's cup, which was crisp and delicious-- just like how a Pimm's cup should be. The menu is pretty varied; however, I ordered the spaghetti because I wanted something simple after working a 12-hour day at work. I usually refrain from getting any type of pasta because I follow this ethic of not ordering food at restaurants that I can easily make myself, but this spaghetti was pretty damn delicious. The pasta was perfectly al dente, the marinara sauce was fresh and flavorful and didn't taste bland as if it were jarred/canned like most places (which is another reason why I avoid pasta dishes at restaurants), and the crispy bacon bits really were the best part of the entree. I would happily order this again and again.\n\nThere was only one negative aspect of this meal. After my Pimm's cup, I asked for a Tom Collins and our waitress told me that they only serve beer and wine and their specialty cocktails, so she was going to ask the bartender what they could do. I didn't mind too much because I've been to a ton of restaurants that have similar schticks. She comes back and tells me that the bartender recommends that I get some other drink on the menu without telling me what was in it. I said sure, assuming that the bartender knew what a Tom Collins was and that he was going to pick something that was a little similar. Wrong. Instead, our waitress comes back with a sparkling wine cocktail that had no resemblance of a Tom Collins. This didn't ruin my experience at Starbelly, it was just annoying that I got something totally different than what I wanted.

Wanted the Starbelly Salad, but they didn't have the ingredients so opted for a Cesaer. Not sure what their idea of a salad is, but mine includes a least some dressing. Theirs was a small amount of romaine lettuce, a quarter of a small avocado and a smidge of Parmesan, with no discernable dressing. Also split two pizzas with my friends: margarita and a pear one. The first was the best thing of the night but not very remarkable and by the time we finished and the pizza had cooled, the crust was leathery. The second was not very good. \n\nThe Castro apparently needed a moderately priced pizza joint because it seems to be doing great. I may give it another try or I may simply grab a slice from one of the many other good pizza joints in the neighborhood.", "author": "Kevin M."}

We arrived at 10 and asked for a table for 3.  I saw a table that had just cleared out, but it was next to a drunk couple that were clearly not happy with each other.  The host said she'd check what was available and didn't offer us that table.  She didn't mention the couple, but you know she wanted us to be comfortable and have an enjoyable experience; she was cool, calm and collected - exactly what you want in a host that mans the door and manages the riff raff.  However, we asked to sit at that particular table (to avoid the communal table) and she happily sat us there.\n\nNext encounter (the server), she was very good at giving us strong suggestions for food and you could tell she was being geniune vs just saying what was top of mind; she went through section by section (small plates, pizza, to entrees etc.) and gave us her top choice.   Also she checked in from time to time and gave us just the right amount of attention.  My man friend found a rubber band from one of our entrees and made a mention to the server.  We just wanted to mention it, so that another guest doesnt choke on it.  We weren't expecting anything at all.  She responded in a way that restaurants should but don't these days; she quickly cleared it away, didn't charge us for it and gave us a comped dessert.  I was really impressed.  \n\nSomehow, we got into a conversation with the manager about the food, my man friend is a bit chatty sometimes,( ok me too when it comes to good food and we love having discussions about it).  We asked about his favourites and told him it was our first time.  He went to check on what we ordered and comped us some grilled peppers to give us something a little different to round out our meal, which I thought was a really nice gesture.  \n\nThe food was all very well done (and very affordable!!) with a few exceptions here and there, but my main favourites were:\n\n-Mussels - perfectly cooked.  (i detest restaurants that overcook them into these dried shrivelled tiny pea)\n-Chicken Liver Pate - phenomenal and perfect comfort food for a cool SF night\n-Japanese cucumber salad with heirloom tomatoes, olives, feta, and arugula - just wow wow wow, perfect balance of flavours, textures, and tang (the feta was amazing) \n-Margherita pizza - nice thin crust and tangy sauce  - i saved a slice for breakfast and it was still tasty cold\n\nDesserts are ok....get one to share, maybe ice cream since its from humphrey slocombe (get the olive oil with sea salt if they have it - amazing!) - all others where flour / eggs/ baking is involved, I would just pass and enjoy the small savoury dishes.", "author": "Miss H."}

Not only did we wait a good 10 minutes before anyone even noticed us and took our drink orders, but the drinks took ANOTHER 10 minutes to arrive.  The food was pretty good, although I did find some gristle in my pulled chicken sandwich... a little too much for my liking. And true to form the food took its sweet time getting out to us.

It's been opened less than a week, so I'm open to the idea that I might need to revise my review upwards in the future.  \n\nMy friend and I went for a late lunch at around 2:00PM on a Saturday.  The place was maybe 15% full.  The waitress was very helpful and funny, and gave us suggestions on food and drinks.   The place has a similar vibe to Beretta, which I like.  The design is cool, but in a way that's no longer unique.  Unfortunately, the venue and waitress were probably the only things that were notable.  \n\nI ordered a frittata and my friend ordered a wedge salad.  We also had two of their non-alcoholic cocktails; both drinks were tasty enough, but nothing special.   \n\nAs I said the restaurant was mostly empty, but it took about 40 minutes to get our food.  Not unreasonable, but hear me out:  my frittata was obviously pre-made, the egg had congealed to the point that I had to use a knife to slice it, and the sauce had also turned to the consistency of old ketchup.  The whole thing could be charitably described as lukewarm.   My friend's salad was a wedge of lettuce with grilled chicken, bacon, and a cream-based dressing.  Before the salad was delivered, the manager came over to apologize that they had oversold their bacon and that there would therefore be no bacon in the salad.  He did graciously comp the salad.  \n\nWe really did want to like this place, but when your signature is bacon and you run out in the middle of a Saturday, that's a problem.  Also, when a lunchtime re-heat of an old frittata and salad takes the better part of an hour to get through, it doesn't send me running back. \n\nI might go back, but not for a while.  Maybe these are all kinks, and this will get better.  But for now, I'll let them work out their problems on someone else.", "author": "Bucko W."}

Their homemade ketchup was an interesting combination of your normal ketchup mixed with a sort of a marinara sauce, with a distinct sweetness to it.\n\nWe HAD to order the spaghetti because we saw another group getting it and it looked really good, and it was. The thing about Starbelly's spaghetti is that it's quite spicy - they cook in jalapenos and chunks of their house bacon into the sauce. You'll feel the tingle of spiciness on your lips after every bite. Also of note, the noodles are quite thick, more like a spaghettoni. But it came out cooked perfectly al dente. Overall the spaghetti was delicious.\n\nThe space was small but nice and the decor was simple. People were packed inside and it was fun sitting at the large communal table.

There's tables, a long two-sided bistro area, and bar seating.  The bistro seats are very close so you need to be a \"plays well with others\" kind of person to enjoy these.  Service was great though and the wait staff very friendly.  My biggest impression of the space was \"these people are HAPPY\" and that included staff and customers!\n\nI had a great dish and a very good dish!\n\nThe asparagus soup is beautiful!  Subtle green color with a mild asparagus flavor, chunks of crab meat on top, and a black-garlic swirled into the bottom of it.  I have never had black-garlic; it was a sweet slightly tangy flavor, but not \"garlicy\" like you'd assume.  The combination of flavors was very good.\n\nI also had the burger with frites.  It was very tasty, beautifully done (medium rare inside).  It was a lot to eat so if you like a lighter fare, it may not be the right selection for you, but it was good.\n\nI had an asian beer to drink that was very nice too - refreshing in an unusual way.  There's several wine and unusual beer selections.  \n\nAll in all, this was a little bit spendier than I thought it should be.  I dropped about $55 with tip for the food above and two beers.

The pro:  very friendly staff, fresh ingredients, interesting menu, nice wine list, good dessert (summer crumble - yum).\n\nThe con:  First, although we got there at about 5:30 and there were a lot of 2-person tables available, we were seated in the rear right by the restroom (like 2 feet from the door).  Call me paranoid, but does the fact that we are older with gray hair make us poor candidates for those nice window tables in the front, 3 of which were available?  Shame on me for not asking to be re-seated.  I did not know how very many people would be using that restroom (at least 15 during our meal, opening and closing door, waiting, etc.).  The restroom door should be set apart by a ledge, partial wall or something.  It is an eyesore and a real annoyance for those close by.\n\nI thought the 3 little corn dogs were tasty but overpriced even at $5.\n\nWe got a lot of attention up front but it took a long time before our server took our order and even longer to get the check.\n\nSome of their food is spicy when it should not be.  What is with spicy spaghetti sauce?  I didn't order it because I was warned (which is a good thing) but why have spicy tomato sauce that a lot of your pasta-loving patrons won't be able to eat?   The gazpacho, which I did order, was too spicy too.  \n\nIf I were rating the food it would be more like a 3 1/2.  It's not that I'll never go back.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-21", "description": "My friend and I went to Starbelly on opening night. As one of the first five people to arrive on the official opening night, I decided to seat myself at the edge of the community table. I started with a champagne cocktail with vermouth and a touch of bitters. Although the combination would be good for bitter lovers, I wasn't a big fan of the cocktail. No matter. \n\nWhen my friend arrived, she opted for Blush Rose champagne and I tried the New Mexico champagne. We swapped tries and I was definitely a fan of the Blush Rose champagne (and had one after). \n\nFor appetizers, we decided on some fancy in-house, organic mini corn dogs. These come in threes with a side of ketchup and spicy mustard. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to eat the corn dog with a knife and I fork, or as a regular corn dog -- straight from the stick. I decided to go primitive and use the stick. The 'corn of the dog' was delicious -- sweet with a nice hint of crispiness to the exterior and just the right moisture inside. I give it a thumbs up for these fancy little dogs.\n\nFor our main dish, we decided to share the lamb cheeks with cheese grits and collards. Now, this was an absolute favorite. I give my friend credit, as she chose this (and, typically, I would not think of lamb cheeks as delicious). The lamb cheeks were braised so the meat melted in your mouth, with a wonderful sauce covering. The cheese grits, mixed with the sauce and greens were delicious. I'm not finding the right words to give this dish justice. I guess it was something about the combination of texture, taste and the right amount of fat gave your brain a really satisfied feeling. There was no gamy aftertaste and the texture of the cheeks was perfect. I highly recommend this dish for meat and lamb lovers. \n\nFor dessert, we tried the fig with Humphrey's balsamic vinegar ice cream and crumbs. When you initially put a bite of the ice cream, fig and crumble into your mouth, you get the 'wow this is amazing' reaction. Something about the combination of the slightly tart ice cream, texture of the crumble and sweetness of the fig triggers the happy sensors in your brains to go wild.\n\nI was going to deduct a star from this review because of the champagne cocktail but just because I'm not a bitters fan, others may find the cocktail delicious. \n\nI think this is as good as it gets, especially on opening night. And the waitress with the red hair (never got her name) was very attentive, answered all our questions and was great. Not to mention, all the staff members chipped in when it got busier towards the end of the night. What also made this an A+ experience was the community table. We sat next to two folks that made the experience even better: a photographer who is writing a book on life in a restaurant but a surgeon by day (and friend of the owner) and the SF fire inspector that needed to be there to ensure everything was up-to-code on opening night since the restaurant opened a tad bit earlier before everything was done. \n\nCongratulations on a successful opening night, Starbelly!", "author": "Chubby D."}

The first thing I noticed is that the restaurant is not very big. We were kept waiting for upwards of 10 minutes, ostensibly because they were waiting for a table to open up. Mr Q ran to the restroom while waiting and noticed a bunch of empty tables in the back, so we were not really sure why we had to stand up there for so long, especially since there was no place to sit while we waited and barely any room for 2 people to stand. I also noticed one of the employees seemed a little ocd...she rearranged the umbrellas that were left at the front, straightened all the menus into neat little stacks etc. To me if there are customers in the restaurant that should be your first priority, not standing up front looking bored and straightening things that don't need to be straightened but hey, it's not my restaurant. \n\nThe food was pretty good-I had the strata and Mr Q had the Sunnyside Joes.

After a rainy few days, the unexpected February sunshine made the patio seem very appealing.  I had the Croque Monsieur with one sunny (sunnyside-up egg), my friend had the Joe's scramble.  The CM was generously made with ham, lots of gooey cheese and thick slices of light, eggy brioche.  The scramble, nicely presented in a small individual skillet, got a very favorable thumbs up from my friend.

And considering that this new restaurant,  Starbelly, was just a few blocks away in the Castro, it's a shame that it took me until December to check it out.\n\nI've gone there for brunch a few times and have been really impressed, nothing I've had has been short of very, very good.  A simple one page menu features a ton of rich new American comfort food offerings.  The chilaquiles with house-made chorizo, corn chips, chile sauce and cilantro is mouth-wateringly good, and will crush any hangover you bring in there.  The open-faced sunny-side up egg sandwich with cheddar and Starbelly's delicious thick-cut bacon is a solid favorite, too.  The sourdough flapjack or the sour Levain french toast are great too if you're in the mood for those.  And the burger: it's legit; Prather Ranch beef on a grilled brioche bun with choice of aged white cheddar or Pt. Reyes blue cheese, bacon, and roasted onions.  I go with the cheddar and bacon, and the onions on the side.  It's a stand-out burger and up there in the Zuni and Spruce echelon fo sho.  Both the dinner and brunch menus feature a variety of thin crust pizzas, as well a surprisingly diverse beer selection.\n\nService has always been friendly, warm, and attentive and the decor also parallels that of Beretta: a long communal table is the middle of the dining room, and the rest is a blend of bright varnished wood and brushed silver metal.  It's clean and spare but not boring, filled with rich accents that capture your upon each visit.  One edge Starbelly has over Beretta is a full back patio with open sunlight.

The first occasion was a nice intro to everything they had. I would pass on the porchetta because I was not expecting the skin/fat to be baked onto the pork. It was a bit unnerving... Today, however, was thoroughly perfect. It started with the sardine appetizer, which was topped with a tangy blend of peppers and capers. It was fresh and tasty. I ordered the Canadian cod w/ carrot sauce over a bacon/brussel sprout mix. The fish was cooked perfectly, and sucked up all the carrot sauce, which was slightly sweet. The savory and texture was added by the bacon and brussel sprouts. Everything just tasted damn good. Also try the Mexican coke w/ red wine... its refreshing. To top it off, in these tough economic times, their prices are super reasonable.", "author": "Thomas L."}

Everything is just right for a high class local joint - nice interior, good seating, not too much flash.  The food is uniformly good - the superb cole slaw sandwich for lunch, the burger, the appetizers, all of it says \"we're kind of pretentious, but we're kind of trying not to be.  Look, you can have a corn dog!\"  It works. Very SF that way.  Cf. Father's Office in Santa Monica, which also has accessible food but fully owns the pretension.  SF vs. LA in a nutshell.  I like them both.\n\nLike Father's Office, the owner of Starbelly cares about beer.  The place does not have 50 choices, but it has 15 great ones that go with the food.  They have Hitachino, which is the new hit in beer circles, they have random belgians, they have some nice locals.  And they are thankfully taking a stand against the Pabst phenomenon in this town.  Mustaches and PBR were never a good idea - keep them in the 19th Century.  Watch Tombstone rather than wearing it, please.  And go to Starbelly - the slaw's comin!", "author": "Brian D."}

She's a pretty hardcore foodie much like myself and so I trusted that any restaurant she would introduce me to would be just as wonderful as she is.\n\nAnd you know what?  Starbelly fit the bill.\n\nIt was a welcome back to my other old friend, the Castro, replete with the parking god(dess) bestowing upon us a space on the street out front.  Walking in I enjoyed the lovely rustic ambiance of the place, and hey, is that their own herb garden in the back patio?\n\nD.F. (darling friend) was eager to try the fig, blue cheese and prosciutto pizza so we decided to share that as our main course.  We started with burrata, heirloom tomato and basil on toasted bread.  Rich and wonderful, good olive oil, amazing tomatoes, but not enough bread.  We had to ask for extra bread, but somehow I didn't really care because ...burrata....\n\nOrdered a Primitivo (also known as Zinfandel in the U.S. to you wine geeks out there) and when the glass arrived I remember tasting it and getting kind of confused.  A few minutes later the manager came by, apologized, and said that the server sent over the Carmenere instead.  Ah ha.  But hey, I got to keep both, so yay.  (Unfortunately don't remember the names, so can't really tell you what exactly I drank.)\n\nOther than that (to me, minor) goof, our server was just plain awesome, I hate that I can't remember her name, but she answered all of our questions and was attentive and oh so sweet.  \n\nWhen the pizza came to our table we devoured it pretty quickly.  Strong blue cheese flavors, which I felt overpowered the rest of the ingredients - even the peppery arugula.  Still a tasty, tasty pizza.\n\nFor dessert I order the toffee cake with mascarpone and dates. She ordered the caramel pot de creme with rosemary cookies.  This was hands down the best part of the meal.  I think she and I wanted to pick up our respective plates and lick them clean.  Absolutely swoon-filled accolades to both dishes!\n\nSo overall my experience at Starbelly was great.  Was it a combination of the company and the restaurant?  Perhaps.  They served fresh, vibrant flavors, but not what i would call outstanding - good, with a rustic elegance I suppose - so a perfect neighborhood establishment.  Dessert was the star.  This, as well as the service, are reasons I will come back.", "author": "Mo R."}

No complaints here, I am deeeeelighted. \n\nThe one thing I thought was odd, was how many people 'touched' our table serving up food, wine, clearing, watering, etc. There is still that new restaurant flow that needs to be perfected. The patio was not open yet, which was a shame because it would have been a great weekend for patio dining, but the FOOD is delectable.\n\nI was going on the light side and ordered one of my mainstays---ceasar salad---it is a personal journey of mine to try every ceasar salad in the United States. It was wonderful small two heads of baby gem lettuce with a decadent, simple creamy dressing and two slices of perfectly ripe avocado. I love how they shave the outside of each avo slice to get rid of any burgeoning brown spots and just make a perfect presentation. Truly scrumptious, could've had a double serving! I also got an appetizer of deep sea scallops pan fried in a creamy corn sauce. They were simple and quite good as well. BUT, for a special treat, I asked for bread and they brought out two thick pieces of toasty whole wheat french bread that had been grilled in butter. Oh the decadence of it. \n\nMy companions shared the mini-corndogs which were a big hit and Brian got the jalapeno spaghetti (not sure he would get it again, said his mouth was on FIRE), Matthew ordered the Mt. Tam Pale Ale braised lamb cheeks which he seemed to enjoy and I should have tasted because those cheeks looked amazing. I love me some cheeks.\n\nThe prices seemed reasonable and I think one reason is because the portions are quite small. However, the table next to us ordered the half roasted chicken which looked like a large portion and smelled delicious.\n\nAlso, Liquor, yes. They do not have a liquor license but were quite creative with their beer and wine cocktails. I ordered a 'Lillet on ice' which is how they stated it on the cocktail menu. Um.

Well, I love the chicken liver appetizer to start.  Wonderfully creamy and served with outstanding jam and chutney.\n\nI'd be hard pressed to choose between pulled chicken sandwich and roasted porchetta one - both are bursting with flavor.  The fries are, of course, a great accompaniment to them or the very nice burger.  The salads are great, especially the generous dungeness crab.  (But the dedication to seasonal ingredients lost us the wonderful cucumber salad from when they opened.)\n\nOn the spring menu, there's a outstanding asparagus pizza with caramelized onions and truffle oil, but all the pizzas I've tried have been great.\n\nAnd then, everything they say about the salted pot de creme is true.  The rosemary shortbread cookies are the perfect complement.  It's a not-too-sweet dessert that I can't get often enough.\n\nService is incredibly friendly and very indulgent.  They're not too helpful in ordering, just because everyone seems to like every dish.  (But, heck, I do, too.)\n\nIf the weather's nice, just sit on the back deck and enjoy it all.\n\nDespite the rave, I'm giving only four stars, because dinner isn't quite as satisfying as lunch.

The cheddar was sharp which matched well with the bitter greens. Salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. Loved those hazelnuts - added great crunchy texture to the salad. The roasted peppers were a nice treat - I think it would probably be even tastier with a bit of toasted garlic on it. Yum. The diver scallops were nicely browned yet still tender and moist on the inside.  I wasn't too thrilled with the puree -the sweetness overpowered the delicate flavors of the scallop. The scallops were nicely flavored on their own.\n \nLast but not least, my favorite of the night was the mussels. The broth was INCREDIBLE - so many layers of flavors - it was a party in my mouth! We even asked for more crostini after all the mussels were gone. We just couldn't let that delicious broth go to waste. \n\nWe had the pot de creme for dessert.

My experiences however were completely the opposite. \n\nAfter running into a good friend at the gym we decided to have lunch together. I suggested Starbelly. I had noticed it opened and stopped to read the menu a few nights before. The place was jamming that night so I already had an idea about had dinner might go down.\n\nWe arrived around 12:15 p m on a Friday afternoon and were promptly seated. Our server Kelly Nicolaisen ( amazing artist I found out  later) seamed like she was on roller skates. She would float in and float out at all the right times. She helped me refine my selections \nso that I got exactly what I was craving. Oh boy was I satisfied. Both my friend and I kept getting distracted from catching up by the amazing food we were putting down.\n\nBefore leaving we had the pleasure to meet Danielle who was able to answer all my excited questions about where the kept the Starbelly sneaches, how to get in for dinner, the concept , the inspiration and anything else I could think of in my foodie high.\n\nThe following night I went again with my boyfriend and two friends ( I am working my way thru the menu since I live a block away ;-}  ). I knew to call ahead to be put on the list. This was at 7:00 p m on Saturday. After being on hold maybe 15 seconds ( thank  you for that) I was told that we could be sat around 8:30. I was also told that I could call back around 8:00 to check on the status of our table. ( I liked that)  After calling back at 8:00  they said our table would be ready in 10 minutes. ( Most excellent) We arrived to a packed house. People outside, inside, and everyone was smiling. I was so excited to share this experience with my friends.\n\nWe were set down within a few minutes and were seated at the corner of the communal table. I purposely positioned myself so I could see into the kitchen. I felt like the cat that caught the mouse. I had the best seat in the house. I could see the front ,the back, and into the kitchen.\nOur  server Margo showed up to help orchestrate our evening. She was knowledgeable, interested and quite the charmer. At one point in the evening she even said she felt so lucky to be there because everyone that she gets to interact with both guest and co workers are nice and fun and interesting. ( Loving that). I am not going to go into the eight dishes that we ordered and devoured. You will have to come and navigate those waters for yourself. Trust me, you will love me for that. \n\nPart of the way thru our meal you will never guess who shows up to our table with a dish for our table , the chef Adam. ( I am dying now.) He says \" I hear you have been here a few times\".  I explained to him just once but I plan on coming back for sure.( someone had been talking to the chef) \n\nMy evening was complete. I later obsessed on Allison's command of the kitchen after Adam stepped into the expediting role,  Allison is the Sous Chef . I commented to Margo our server about how impressive she was in the kitchen and she said \" they are so on point together\". Well need I say more.\n\nThere are some wonderful rooms in this city to dine in. There are interesting selections of  food prepared amazingly.  However to me there are few restaurants were you feel like you are part of the experience and not the audience. I am so grateful that Starbelly is now part of the fabric of my neighborhood.

A bit of burrata, with a few grapes on toasted bread - it's all you need!\n\n- Coriander dusted scallops, white corn puree: everyone who tried this agreed it was absolutely delicious.  It is served with just 3-4 scallops so you may want a double order depending on the size of your party - or if you want to make this the meal which I heard several of my friends say they would!  If you love scallops this is a for sure order.\n\nThe main course I had was fresh Spaghetti, starbelly bacon, jalapeno, tomato & basil  and I was left underwhelmed with this one.  There was way too much bacon, thick chunks - so note to those that don't like a lot of meat - do not order this dish.  I was most intrigued because of the jalapenos which was a nice flavor in the dish - but overall I would skip this one.  My husband ordered the Pizza - market mushrooms, gruyere, thyme & roasted onions and he thought it was good but it didn't knock his socks off.\n\nMy recommendation would be to perhaps skip some of the larger plates and make an evening of the small plates here.  Their snacks, salads and small plates were all note worthy - so that's what I will probably do next time I visit.  \n\nMy other recommendation is go for the dessert!  In fact, I would give their desserts 4.5 stars!  We ordered the following to share:\n - Salted caramel pot de cr\u00e8me, rosemary cornmeal cookies: Perfection!  This was amazing amazing amazing!  The rosemary from the cookies combined with the salted caramel was a fantastic flavor dream.  I recently wrote that Pomelo's Hazelnut Chocolate Mouse was the best dessert I have had in San Francisco, but Starbelly's Pot de Creme gives it a serious run for its money!\n\n - Scoop of Humphry Slocombe seasonal ice cream: The flavors offered were the Harvey Milk and Secret Breakfast - seriously amazing - both of the flavors.  It was perfect for sharing as well!  You really just need a few bites to appreciate the taste.\n\nI would give the savory foods 3 stars, but the sweets at Starbelly are first class 4-5 stars!  I'll definitely be back for an evening of small plates and desserts!", "author": "Kavita M."}

Upscale restaurants have a hard time surviving in this neck of the woods, often being replaced by fancy bars, that sell OK food.  I have now eaten there on three separate occasions and each time it has been its own eating experience.\n\n#1 Back in early December with our funky cool staff.  14 people for dinner in this small restaurant was not the easiest feat and yet they managed to fit us in.  Since they were running about 15 minutes late, they provided us with three (or four) free appetizers. Dinner was excellent, served hot and the herbal infusions (green-jasmine tea with sage) blew my mind.  That night I had the apple-celery root salad, the fish of the day and the Salted Caramel Pot-Du-Creme.  Considering the size of our party, everything was spread out nicely and the timing of service was great.\n\n#2 and 3.  Two times in one week (Gialina was packed)  Second round I had the Prather Ranch burger, and I can honestly say it was the best burger I ever had.  The meat was a perfect medium rare like I ordered it and it lacked the heavy, greasy feel of Niman Ranch Beef.  The fries are thin cut and crunchy, the way they should be.  I even managed to eat some of the beet salad, and that is the biggest compliment to the restaurant, since I detest beets (up there with tongue and liver, damn Eastern European upbringing).  More of the amazing herbal tea infusions (they seriously are like crack) and we had the toffee cake for desert which both my husband and I are a sucker for.  Our server on Wednesday night was AMAZING and entertaining :)  We had a great conversation with him about Cairo.  Saturday night the service was good, not as great, but then again, it was around 9PM and crowded.\n\nSo TTK (things to know):  \n\nThe wait can be grizzly on the weekends.  You can call 45min/ one hour ahead and put your name on the list.  They soon will take limited amount of reservations per night, so if you are good at planning ahead the whole wait thing will be behind you.\n\nContrary to what a lot of people say, the restaurant is fairly loud.  The back is better for group conversations, but at the communal table you definitely have to speak up.\n\nThey serve super late on weekends, so you finally have a place to go after seeing a movie at the Castro.\n\nParking in the Castro is a bitch.

The salads are a nice choice and an easy way to take out some meat where it was offered.\n\nIf you're a vegan, this place isn't offering you much choice at this time though. The waitress agreed.\n\nGo with Yelper Liz S.  and it's hard to give any place less than 5 stars but in this case, until they fatten up the veggie options, it remains a 4 star.

For example, the Pimm's Cup was a very generous pour garnished with a slice of cucumber and a sprig of basil. One gets a tiny whiff of the garnishes during every sip.\n\nThe wine list is also different and wonderful compared with other restaurants in the area. Many of the wines are Spanish or South American, and the selections are impecable for each category, making any uneducated choice a tasty one.\n\nWe had the salumi plate to start and requested that the server choose the specific cuts to serve. All were very nice, and the board was served with some olives, fresh mustard, and toasted bread. My only thought here was that the portion of the salumi itself could have been bigger.\n\nI ordered the spaghetti for the entre. I know, I know. I can make pasta at home. But that's what makes it such a good way to evaluate whether the kitchen staff knows what they are doing or not. Besides, Starbelly's spaghetti has a little bit of jalapeno in it, which gives it a tiny zing. The freshly shaved parmasean on top was nice too. I really enjoyed that spaghetti!\n\nSince we were drunk and already impaired by the time the dessert menu came, we decided to order dessert wine instead of sweets. The muscat was a little too sweet for me - almost like syrup. But the Zinfandel! Good Lord, was that tasty! Not too sweet, and there was a touch of tannin remaining.

This salad had potential because all the flavors were there, but they were muddled because the ingredients weren't proportioned correctly.\n\nMarket mushroom pizza with gruyere, thyme & roasted onions - they murdered this pizza with too many red onions. The overwhelming, sweet red onion flavor completely masked the taste of the gruyere cheese and delicate mushrooms. What a tragedy. \n\nPan roasted black mussels with Mexican chorizo, market chilies & cilantro - the chorizo added a meaty richness to the mussels, but it was difficult to enjoy because the mussels were so puny. If a restaurant does not have decent size mussels, they should not serve them. Period. \n\nGrilled Sonoma lamb chops, cheddar grits & braised greens, fresh quince chutney - finally, a well-executed dish. The lamb chops were juicy, well-seasoned, and nicely complemented by the quince chutney.

In case you were wondering (and I was!) gnoccho, is similar to gnocchi except that it's served in more of a pie-like situation, as opposed to several small dumplings. This dish in particular featured a square block of the stuff topped with a pork ragout saucy situation and cheese. Filling to say the least, but very tasty! The entire table agreed that the best dish we tried was the side of Brussel sprouts though. Thats right, Brussel sprouts! Cooked to crispy perfection, mixed with crunchy bacon and topped with a drizzle of balsamic reduction, these little suckers were magnificent. I could have easily made a meal out of them, but I'd hate the miss the rest of the deliciousness on the table. Starbelly doesn't have a liquor license, but their wine-based cocktails were winning nonetheless. Try the Starbelly 75 with prosecco, ginger lemon, and wine liquer. Yum!", "author": "Katie C."}

I first went here in pursuit of their highly recommended burger, and I became a devotee immediately when I looked closely at the menu which is thoughtful and inventive with flourishes of haute cuisine seldom found in casual joints.  True to my calling I ordered the cheeseburger although there was plenty to tug at my heart instead of that burger including tantalizing pizza's, some down home sandwiches, beautifully described salads as well as sandwiches, entree's and compelling side dishes.  It's a light hearted, fun restaurant that takes food seriously and fun the same way.  The physical plant is clean and lean, there is a trellised patio with outdoor heaters when needed, an elevated family style table, a small wine and beer bar and a well trained staff who are thoughtful, attentive and fun.  The burger is a true winner as are the fries and service, but since that first visit, I've tried salads that are inventive and excellent, appetizers like the mini corn dogs that are addictive and a couple pizza's that are as sensational as their choice ingredients.  Entree's have consistently been avante garde and really well executed, so I have trouble classifying restaurants that can make high dining a simple, fun experience for the masses.

This seating arrangement makes for awkward dinning especially at the already tightly packed tables. \n\nThe food was good but not memorable, we had both the fries and the clams for an appetizer which were okay. We then shared the mushroom pizza which was rich and flavorful and on a decent (for San Francisco) thin crust. The highlight of the meal however was the Chocolate Peanut Butter Desert! This desert was very good and caused us to definitely leave on a high note. I would skip the appetizers just to leave room for the desert. \n\nFor service, our server, Lauren was amazing! The food was timed perfectly, the water glasses were always filled without even noticing her filling them, and she was always there to answer a question but didn't hover over the table. \n\nThe total bill for 2 appetizers, a pizza, wine, coffee and desert, plus tax and 20% tip $70, which seemed to be very reasonable. \n\nI would have to give Starbelly:\nDecor : 4 stars\nService : 5 stars\nSeating : 2 stars\nFood : 3 stars (4 for just the desert)\nPrice : 4 stars\n\nI would go here again if I was in the area and there was no wait, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get here.", "author": "Katie P."}

Starbelly is firing on all cylinders.  For a long time there was a drought in The Castro--at least in the food department--and now with several good eateries like Kasa and Eureka there is another good one--Starbelly.\n\nThe California fare restaurant has a small yet well edited menu of both small and larger plates.  The wine and beer list is equally small but well chosen.  And to bring it all together is good service that dialogues with it's patrons and does so equally and thoughtfully.  I had the super fresh Octopus salad which was well balanced with spicy arugula and the citrus elements sewed each distinct flavor together.  I enjoyed the Prather Ranch burger with what seemed a lot of french fries--I was thinking how could I eat all of these?  But the were completely light, crunch and delightful.  The housemade ketchup was another plus--I am tired of high fructose sweetened mass produced ketchups.  This is a nice ketchup that allows you to enjoy your fry but not bury with overly thickened and dangerously sweet ketchup.\n\nI could have eaten dessert but could not imagine eating a dessert by myself--that would have been too much.

No big deal... I had no problem waiting a few extra minutes for my pizza.  Stuff happens.\n\nThe manager owned up to the delay, apologized, and comped everything.  Not just my pizza... but my beer as well.\n\nToday, eating with a friend, we sampled a lot of items on the menu... from the pate to gazpacho to a bibb lettuce salad with chicken and homemade bacon.  Everything was fabulous.  To end, we went for their cheese platter.... and to be honest, we weren't thrilled by it and talked to our server about what didn't really work for us.\n\nThing is -- it wasn't BAD... it just wasn't something we were knocked-out by.  We probably ate 1/2 of the the platter... and in no way were knocking it.  It just didn't please as much as the rest of the food.\n\nWhen the server came back, she said she'd removed the cheese platter from the bill.  Amazing.  We both protested a bit -- saying that even if it didn't strike our fancy, we weren't sure there was anything wrong with it.\n\nThe amazing thing was -- when we talked about the cheeses on the platter, she had a binder full of info about the cheeses available.  Even though these weren't our favorites... Starbelly clearly goes out of their way to educate their staff about what they serve.

Further back more tables.  It has an up tempo vibe suited to eating, drinking, talking.  I liked it..  Service was good and for the most part food was good as well.\n\nA salad of grilled little gems with orange, feta, and some nice crunchy hazelnuts was a great beginning to a meal.  Next a misstep.  Fried dungeness crab hushpuppies were piping hot.  But unfortunately there was no taste of crab.  Only filler.  However, pan roasted striped bass with chanterelle mushrooms and celery root puree was a big winner.  Perfectly prepared.  Lovely to the taste.  I only wished for more on the plate at the price.  However, I suppose good food is supposed to leave you wanting one taste more.  I wanted one or two tastes more for a dollar or two less.\n\nOne other thing.  No bread.   I would have liked some good, crusty bread with some good sweet butter.", "author": "David D."}

This was my second visit to the place but since we were a large (14 people) group, I had a chance to try many more of the dishes. \n\nWe started by ordering a bunch of small plates. We likely could have just dined on the small plates and appetizers. The stand-outs were the chicken liver pate and the scallops. We ended up re-ordering the scallops twice, just because everyone enjoyed them so much. The creamed local corn was also excellent.\n\nI had a pizza margherita with ham for my main course, which was quite good. I couldn't resist the salted caramel pot de cr\u00e8me for dessert and I'm glad I didn't. It was just about perfect; the byplay between the salt and the sweet was wonderful.\n\nIf you like beer, I recommend the Curieux -- at $26 (for a 750ml bottle) it is the most expensive beer on the menu, but it was also the tastiest.\n\nThe atmosphere was noisy but fun and the service was pretty good. It was a little slow in places, but we were there for 3+ hours and didn't really notice the pace. All in all, a great time.", "author": "Bruce H."}

In all seriousness folks, this place is for carnivores.  My date and I split the burger and porchetta then washed them down with a couple beers, you know, for hydration.  \n\nThe porchetta was a juicy, crispety, cruchety slab of swine heaven.  You need to cut it just right to get the right layers of fat, meat, and skin in each bite.  But a little work pays off.  They season it just enough to bring out some flavor but not overpower.  The waitress tried to snatch away the plate before I had finished the skin but I snagged it off her tray as she walked away.\n\nThe burger was high quality once they cooked it right.  We asked for medium, they brought out raw.  It mooed when I cut into it.  But they rectified the situation quickly and gave me a free beer for my troubles.  Once properly cooked, the burger tastes like backyard BBQ.  It's got that smoky charcoal flavor to it.  Reminded me of the 4th of July.  God Bless America.\n\nThe place (unsurprisingly) is loud and cramped.  Don't bring the Mrs. here for a quiet, romantic dinner on the town.

However, I was served an order of fried chicken that was mostly raw and pink in the middle.  Unfortunately, I did not realize this until I was 1/4 of the way done with my meal. I was a bit nauseous when I realized this and nervous of getting sick as well.  However, I did proceed to get a replacement chicken dish, which arrived about 15 minutes after my friend was finished with her meal.  It was still a bit undercooked for my comfort, but I decided to take most of it home so I could heat it up and cook it further.  My main disappoitment was that  no manager ever appologized, nor did they offer me any small compensation.. even a complementary coffee would have been nice, b/c it really is the thought that counts.  Needless to say, I had quite the stomach ache that night, but thank goodness I did not get sick.

They need better coordination in the kitchen to ensure that people get their food in time for them to eat together. Good restaurants will watch out for this.\n\nMy wife ordered the burger, which came out undercooked, and she sent it back. Everyone else had finished their dinner before we realized that my wife's food had not arrived yet (we were already having a lot of fun so did not notice the time passing). When I called the waitress to inquire about the burger, she said that it would take another 10 minutes because my wife had asked for it to be well done; it was at least 20 minutes since we had sent it back. We canceled the burger and I asked to speak to the manager. The chef (Adam Timney) came by. I explained to him what happened not expecting anything other then an apology. What I received was a defensive attitude and a comment that the delay was due to my wife ordering a second burger, this ticked me off - typically a good chef or restaurant manager will accept constructive feedback when it's given, not this guy.

Since we weren't super hungry and only wanted to nosh, we ordered the cornmeal calamari with remoulade (which wasn't remoulade but actually mayonnaise with Old Bay seasoning), the Starbelly salad, and the Starbelly bacon and pepper pizza.  I had high expectations because I love Beretta and was expecting the quality to be similar.  \n\nHowever, that cannot be said.  Although the prices are in-line with those at Beretta, the food is unfortunately quite mediocre.  The cornmeal clams were greasy and separated from the batter as soon as you picked them up, the salad was totally flavorless, oily, and lacked acidity, and the so-called Starbelly bacon on the pizza was akin to chunks of fat that slightly resembled pancetta, but with much less flavor.  Despite the fact that the food was bland, there wasn't a salt shaker or pepper grinder in sight.  I guess the only good things I can say at this point are that the interior design is cool and the wine list is decent (the Primitivo at $6 a tumbler is quite a delicious value).  \n\nThat said, I'll probably be back since they've just opened and will hopefully work out all of their kinks in the kitchen.  Bottom line, I wouldn't travel from my hood to eat at Starbelly but if I were in the neighborhood, I'd definitely dine there again since the Castro lacks good and/or imaginative dining options.", "author": "Doug V."}

I love the wood planked walls and extra long bar, but everything else just seems kind of half-finished and I hate to say it: dated. Why install massive shelving on the walls if you aren't going to put anything on them? Just hang some art instead; it's way more interesting to look at. And the lime green and pumpkin color scheme just seems a little too Ikea. However, what Starbelly lacks in decor cohesiveness, they more than make up for in taste, service, and value. \n\nWe tried a few dishes off the reasonably priced \"snack\" options list - three perfectly crunchy mini corndogs with a killer housemade ketchup and olives with flatbread. Both were great dishes and a steal at $5. Next we sampled the butter lettuce salad with hazelnuts, figs, and a blue cheese vinaigrette. The dressing was deliciously vinegary and not too creamy, which is just how I like it. \n\nThe pizza wasn't as good as Beretta's but I don't think it's trying to be. The one we picked - with cherry tomatoes, salumi, and mozzarella resting atop a well-sauced, perfectly crisp and slightly charred crust - was great tasting and pretty big for a mere $15. I could have stopped here, stuffed and happy, but we also ordered the lamb cheeks with grits and greens and spaghetti with Starbelly's own bacon, jalapenos, and basil. Both were excellent dishes. I loved the thick tubes of spaghetti and inventiveness of the additional ingredients used in the pasta but beware, the dish is super spicy. \n\nAll this food and a bottle of wine for about for about $100.

Their Michelada lime was an interesting exercise: spicy, salty, tangy and refreshing all at once, and their Madeira Hot Toddy was a nice finish to my meal (but they were out of the Spiced Honey Stout which I REALLY wanted to try).\n\nI first heard of Starbelly when it made the Chronicle's short list for the best fries in the city, and because I have a rather large affection for fries, it immediately made my list of places to try. So of course my very first time there, I got the house cut fries with three dips. I'll give them extra points for making the fries in-house, but if you think the perfect fry has a crispy exterior with a moist and almost flaky interior that can stand on its own with a light dusting of salt and perhaps some pepper, you might have mixed feelings about this. In our mix of cuts, some fries were perfectly cooked whereas others were limp and soggy. BUT, the fries come with three dipping sauces: a basil aioli, a romesco, and a house-made ketchup and I LOVE dipping sauces. So while the fries are not at the top of my favorites list on their own, the dipping sauces definitely help to elevate them on my list.\n\nDespite my affinity for burgers, I would actually recommend the rotisserie chicken. It's moist, tender and extremely flavorful at once. This is the epitome of how I think chicken should be served.\n\nAnd finally, do yourself a favor and get yourself a pizza. On my first visit, I had the great fortune of sitting in front of the kitchen. An unwanted pizza margherita came out, and instead of tossing it or putting it under heat lamps, the waiter decided that we looked hungry and gave it to us. Happiness++. That waiter was a genius, because I now must start off with one. He got me hooked.\n\nAs you might imagine, I really appreciate the service here. Service on my first visit was outstanding/superb/tack-on-any-number-of-other superlatives, and while I didn't find the same perks on successive visits, I have no complaints. \n\nIf you're driving, be prepared to walk a few blocks as parking spots are rather elusive. And there may be a wait once you get there, but it's worth it.", "author": "Brent I."}

Whether you come for a light snack, full dinner or just coffee and desert, the ambience is warm and friendly and it's run in my opinion by a staff of caring and intelligent people which is reflected in the food they serve. \n\nThe restaurant has a number of good appetizers to choose from, many of which are of the vegetable type, ie, grilled local artichoke & lemon aioli or split pea fritters. When they serve their spinach appetizer, don't think, just get it and eat it!  You can also find delicious salads as well, like the asparagus & mixed chicory salad. \n\nFor entree's, the number one entree that I've had is the spaghetti with bacon: to die for!  The pizza is awesome, and the restaurant also serves fish, spare ribs, steak, pot pie, and burgers.\n\nIf desserts are your thing, try the warm toffee cake with mascarpone & medjool dates: off the hook! Make sure you order a small or large french press coffee to compliment the cake or any of their other amazing coffee products. \nThe restaurant sports a moderately sized dining area and bar as well as back patio with heat lamps. This is a fun place!", "author": "Dave M."}

It looked a little crowded, but we luckily got a table right away... which is always a plus in my book. \nWe ordered a couple of \"large\" beers, which were actually pint size (is this normal in most restaurants, or am I totally a lush? Ha!) but they were pretty good. I forget what I tried but I feel like it was a double IPA or something ridiculous.\nOur server was friendly, but didn't know the menu because she \"didn't work there\", which I found sorta odd, but maybe she normally works at Beretta or something. So basically she couldn't answer any of the questions we had, but she did send someone over to our table to answer our questions... after we had already ordered. \nWe started with the cheese plate, which was reasonably good. We each got a salad... I got the Starbelly Salad and my girlfriend got the Little Gems salad... I would recommend either.\nThe best part of the meal for me were the Mussels and Chorizo that we ordered. This was my first time trying mussels and I was really skeptical, but the broth, chorizo and pepper combination was really good and my fears of the shellfish subsided.\nAfter we had finished eating, our server dropped us the wrong check. Maybe she was just having an off night. \nAll in all I would say that I would go here again sometime to try some of the other interesting sounding small plates on the menu.", "author": "Liane V."}

Between the two of us, we ordered a few different things and split.  The warm olives and flat bread were pretty much just mediocre.  We split the little gems salad, which was delicious, but on the smaller side.  We couldn't say no to dungeness crab hush puppies with louie dressing, and I suggest you follow suit - super good.

I also saw a Fried Oyster Po Boy on the menu that day and I just had to go in a try again. Fried Oysters in any fashion are my favorite food. \n\nThe good service and atmosphere were not enough to raise my star rating for them. The Po Boy was supposed to be served on a toasted ciabatta roll but instead came out on a baguette. The bread was way to hard and crusty for the delicate, succulent oysters. Each bite completely smashed and pulverized the oysters and left scratches on the roof of my mouth. The oysters were done right and the bay aioli was lightly seasoned, which I wished were more flavorful. The fries were lengthy this time, unlike the last time when we had a basket of the leftover short ends. And the Caesar salad was really tasty!", "author": "Foodie F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-09-23", "description": "We were tremendously excited to try Starbelly after reading their first posted menu, which included some of our favorite ingredients: nettles, guanciale, and (imagine!) lamb cheeks.  The reviews in the local press were positive, and we saved it for a treat.\n\nTo make a long story short, a few things were good, but nothing was worth going back for, particularly considering that the restaurant was so loud that it made my ears ring.  Mind you, I went to My Bloody Valentine last year.\n\nThe full story:\n\nWe had a party of four and wanted to take the other couple somewhere special.\n\nStarbelly only accepts reservations for parties of six or more.  Everyone else is invited to call up to an hour in advance.  I was sternly warned that 7pm on Friday was peak time and we might not be seated until 8:30.  I called at 6 and made a 7:15 appointment.  To my delight we were seated right away even though one of our party was running late.\n\nHere is what we ordered and what we thought of everything:\n\n0) Darjeeling tea, lime, basil, egg white:  if it's lemonade, call it lemonade.  \n\n1) popcorn clams with Old Bay remoulade:  surprisingly flavorful and gently chewy\n    \n2) spicy sausage stuffed sage leaves: porky, with perfectly crisped sage leaves\n\n3) warm olive tapenade, chili oil & grilled flat bread:  very balanced yet flavorful selection of olives    \n\n4) pan roasted black mussels, mexican chorizo, market chilies & cilantro:  the mussels were tiny and the chorizo was just plain sausage.   The broth was ironically weak and no bread to sop its deliciousness up?  I'm missing Chow already.\n\n5) grilled baby octopus with fennel & radicchio slaw:  the octopus was not fresh.\n\n6) pan roasted diver scallops with nettles:  OK, so the scallops were (for once!) cooked perfectly and were not at all chewy.  Nonetheless, the nettle puree it sat upon was too weak to impart any flavor.  Disappointing!\n\n7) pizza: guanciale, wild nettles, parmesan:  a few tiny scraps of guanciale, no nettles, and a weird crust that might have been gluten-free.  The sauce was a bit on the zesty side for my native Italian partner, but I thought it was really the pizza's only redeeming feature.\n\n8) Mt. Tam pale ale braised lamb cheeks, white cheddar grits &, braised greens:  we had two orders of this at our table.  Mine had a heavy layer of potent salt which made the first few bites quite challenging.  I probably should have sent it back, the other order we had for the table didn't have this problem.  The cheeks themselves were very fine, meltingly tender, and pleasantly mild in flavor.  My partner and I agreed that the grits and the greens were good with each other but overwhelmed the cheeks. \n\n9) berry crumble with humphrey slocumb ice cream:  one of our party complained that the crumble was not crunchy enough.  Mine was a riot of flavors, not unpleasant although unusual.\n\nI will say that the service and the pacing of serving the food was excellent, particularly impressive given that the restaurant was full.\n\nAgain, the noise level was off the charts.  I'm tempted to call OSHA!", "author": "Seth G."}

He opted for a simple salad and spaghetti while I tried a chorizo and egg pizza accompanied by the cheddar grits with roasted greens.\n\nI think I got the lesser meal because the pizza was kind of soggy and the chorizo didn't have much flavor.

It was simple fare: salad, mac&cheese, corn on the cob, roast pig, and ice cream sundaes. But everything was *exquisite*. The salad dressing was amazing. The mac-and-cheese had artisan bacon in it. The pork came with two fancy (and delicious) salsa-type dressings: a mint one and a chili one with some kind of pickled fruit in it. The ice sundaes had homemade sauces (chocolate and caramel) and included a banana that had been split and dressed with sugar that they caramelized on-site with a blowtorch. There's a server to seat you and bring you drinks but the food itself is buffet-style. You can go back as many times as you like (I saw one guy hit the buffet at least 6 times, we manage to limit ourselves to just seconds). This was $25/person.

It was served the crispy side up (brown) on top of mushrooms (deeper brown) which tasted greasy. This sat next to a divine celery root puree that was so over powered by the fried butter taste that you would never taste the celery root and the mushrooms only exacerbated the problem from a visual and taste perspective. Honestly, what was the chef thinking with this dish when he/she created such a wonderful meat dish? Oy! Brass tacks; you couldn't taste the fish at all due to the greasy flavor.\n\nSide dish: brussel sprouts. Good quality brussels cooked perfectly but bland- they needed an additional oomph with a bit of salt (not available on the bar) or garlic or something. They were served with a shaven parm but that did not really add any flavor.\n\nThe dessert: a very good banana fudge sundae.\n\nOverall, I was disappointed because I clearly got the wrong meal which ruined the entire experience. I felt jipped at the price. :-( \n\nI would go again if someone else insisted and I would stick to meat.", "author": "pamela h."}

Everything was awesome, from the baby octopus to the roast chicken (moist, salty and delicious!) to the thin crust pizza.\n\nMy only complaint (another service detail) is that we ordered a pizza with wild nettles specifically because we were excited about the nettles and when it came, it had radicchio instead. We told a couple different servers and they all acted confused and said they had to check with the kitchen. 15 minutes later, it was confirmed, yes, the pizza had radicchio instead. Um, we know! I just wish the server had apologized when we first brought it up and asked if we'd like something else. We would have said no and enjoyed the pizza, minus the irritation.

My b/f wasn't too amazed by his hamburger and my other friend got his steak comped because it was too overdone.  I forgot what the others ordered, but I didn't hear any complaints.\n\nThen we ordered three desserts and an additional was brought for my friend's bday.\n\nThere was coffee ordered at the end as well.\n\nWhen we got our bill, it was a mere $152.00 for 8 people (including a bottle of wine) who left totally full.

I tried and waited not more than five minutes for a table when I got there.  Awesome!\n\nPassing by the bar towards our table, cocktails and the whole bar ambiance looked really nice. Too bad they don't have liqueur license.  That one drink with a cucumber slice looks just like the one on the website picture:  impressive.\n\nInterior is a little strange.  Hard to explain.  It kinda looks like a boy with oversize pants. :)  Seriously, it looks bigger than it should have been.  Tables and decor are so spaced out that the ambiance gets killed.  Lighting was a bit too bright too.  I don't really know which restaurant opened first, but in Beretta, the atmosphere feels just right.\n\nStaff was all nice and professional for sure.  We were notified what they were out of instantly which I always appreciate than finding out an hour later.\n\nWe started with popcorn clams, fries and brussel sprouts.\n\nPopcorn Clams:  Not a bad one although the coating felt a bit overkill from time to time that I almost didn't taste any clam.  Sauce was ok.\n\nFries:  Nothing special.  Sorry.  Sauces were more of a highlight than semi-soft fries.\n\nBrussel Sprouts:  Done just right I have to say.  Yummy!\n\nAfter apps, we continued with the spagetti with tomato, basil, bacon and jalapenos.  First it tasted great:  proper amount of jalapenos, juicy bacon.  Pasta really defined aldente.  I mean it surpasses SPQR and A16 by the way it was made and cooked.  Hands down.  Then I realized I didn't really taste any tomato nor basil? I guess tomatoes were bland and not flavorful. Basil was maybe overcooked?\n\nDesserts made us happy again though.  Yogurt sherbet was off the hook with its addictive sauce.  The salt in the pot de creme was delicious and very complimentary with the dessert.\n\nFlow of service was fairly good.  Except we waited for brussel sprouts for a little while, but they made it to the table eventually.\n\nThis place definitely has potential to be a great place.

We arrived at 10am (its advertised opening for Sunday brunch on its website) to try to snag one of the first tables.  However, our plan was foiled when we entered and the hostess informed us that they decided to move their opening time to 11am that day because the kitchen had been slammed in prior days and needed some extra time to get ready.  Huh?   Rather than wait an hour we took our business elsewhere.  \n\nHowever, determined to give it a try, our party of 4 arrived on the following Thursday night at 6:30pm.  After a brief wait we were seated in the rear of the restaurant at a 6 top.   \n\nOur server promptly offered Hetch Hetchy's finest sparkling or still and oriented us to the menu.  We started with the corn dogs, fried clams and butter lettuce salad.  All were served promptly and tasted great.    For entrees we ordered the diver scallops small plate; the fig, arugula and blue cheese pizza (but restrained ourselves from adding the Spanish ham); the spaghetti; and the porchetta.   All dishes were fantastic.  Standouts were the pizza - the flavors were wonderful and the crust a perfect balance of crisp and chewy, and the spaghetti - perfectly al dente with a nice amount of spice from the jalapeno.  We skipped dessert, but one of our group did order a decaf espresso.  It was considerably delayed, but we didn't really notice because we were enjoying our conversation.  However, the waiter comped it without solicitation.  Nice touch.   \n\nAdditionally, the waiter, who was very well informed about the wine list and offered just the right amount of background on the bottles we asked about, recommended a bottle of Qupe Marsanne with the meal. It was an excellent choice and worked well with the variety of dishes we had selected.\n\nOne note: the restaurant is NOISY!  After we left, all 4 of us were hoarse from speaking so loudly and our ears were ringing a bit.    \n\nAll-in-all, a great experience.  After 2 weeks, the kitchen seems to have hit a good rhythm.   Service was attentive, well informed and well executed.   Also, the price point is set appropriately.  We all agreed the bill was more than reasonable for the quality of the food and service.", "author": "Jonathan W."}

Good.\nI'm a sporadic reader of the sfeater blog but checked it last week and read that Starbelly would be hosting a crab feast to celebrate the opening of Dungeness season.  I immediately called and was thrilled to snag a table at 8pm (they were doing seatings at 6pm and 8pm).  \n\nWe entered the restaurant not having eaten there before and having no idea what to expect from the crab feast.\nI was pleasantly surprised to be led to the covered patio, attractively lit with twinkle lights, and was happy to see newspaper on our table.  The pleasant surprises just kept coming all night.  Starbelly handled the crab feast beautifully: you sat down, saw a menu of what you'd be getting and then were promptly served a demitasse cup of ridiculously good crab bisque.  SUPER rich so the serving size was perfect.  They had the winemaker of the wine they were pouring AT the feast, so he came by and started us off with some blanc de blancs.  Then, it was basically a buffet which included ceasar salad and a guy in front of a grill and a huge pot cooking both house-made sausages and, of course, the CRAB!  They offered melted butter and a creamy-style sauce as accompanyments.  You could go up as often as you wanted for the food.  We were also offered chardonnay with dinner and appreciated the generous refill policy.  \nOur server was lovely and full of personality, the free-flowing wine was a big plus and the crab was outstanding.  I actually ate most of it with no sauce and just enjoyed the sweet, fresh claw meat scented with Old Bay.  \nThere was apple cobbler for dessert but I just enjoyed more crab.\n\nAt $49/person, this felt like a deal and a half!  What a smart use of the patio and a great way to showcase both the restaurant and our local seafood treasure!  Our server said they'd do similar events in the future and to be on the look-out for them.  I absolutely will be and look forward to returning to Starbelly to try out their regular fare.", "author": "Auburn D."}

Perhaps due to the fact that I can't get the food out of my mind. I have tried: the house cut fries with three dips - heavenly. I always trick myself into thinking that all fries are created equal. One taste of Starbelly's fries proves how completely false that is. They are dense and crispy strips of delight. The three dips a perfect treat for the indecisive, and a nice substitute for the typical katsup. The domestic cheese plate has some incredible cheeses on it. I have been spoiled with knowledge of superior French, English and Irish cheeses so it is hard to find cheeses in California that have a robust or deeply nutty flavor. Somehow Starbelly has found them. If they have Brussels sprouts on the menu, get them. They know how to cook 'em exactly the way they need to be cooked. Every time we go in we get a pizza. We have never been let down. The half rotisserie chicken is a lot of food, but completely worth it. I am desperate to try their Pot Pie, but alas, it was sold out and then off the menu.\n\nOn top of savory and sweet treats, both light and comfort-style filling, Starbelly touts a cozy yet chic decor. The place has the wooden essence of a cabin, with the streamlined sexiness of a modern art store. It's the perfect spot if you aren't dressed up but want to enjoy a hot night out, and works well if you are dressed to the nines. Not many places can pull that sort of feeling off.\n\nBe sure to sample the cocktail list. I highly recommend their bartender Ben, (tall chap, reserved - but the kind of reserved that is enticing, and so knowledgeable about what drink will suit your taste). Starbelly has it all, friendly and charismatic staff, delectable food, and a superior setting.", "author": "Tawnee K."}

On Thursday we had the worst experience.  We made a reservation for 6:30.  My two friends arrived at 6:20 and I got their at 6:25.  The server was not bad nor was she exponential.   We order apps, three entrees, a bottle of win, several additional glasses of win and desserts. We got the check and we were finishing our drinks, when we were told by our server  they needed our table and could we move to a communal table.  I was annoyed.  There were folks that were at the restaurant before us and they were still linger and yet, they needed OUR table.  We got our first order at 6:40.  We got the check at 8:25 and Danielle, our server,  wanted us out.  I am sorry that they overbooked but guess what- NOT MY PROBLEM.  Oh, it gets better.  The manager is clearing our table with our wine still in our glasses and he says, did you have a good time.  When I responded, actually no.  He was a deer in headlights.  (Little coaching: do not ask a question  if you do not want a sincere response.) When I stated, we were here for less than 1 hour and 20 minutes...we were not done.  Why the rush?

And my work is one hundred per cent guaranteed!\" -Sylvester McMonkey McBean (The Sneetches)\n\nIndeed, Starbelly had what we needed.  We walked in plain-bellied, and walked out...well, while not quite starred, our bellies were definitely grinning from love handle to love handle. This may have been due to the fact that three of us ate enough for six people, because gluttony loves company.\n\nVirtually every element of our experience at this restaurant was awesome: the d\u00e9cor, the service, the bar, the food, and the vibe. BEa-u-TI-ful.\n\nThe d\u00e9cor was modern and minimalist, very Zen. My feng was shui'd by the tasteful details, like the wood paneling, cardboard lamp shades and bowling lane bar/group table. The bowling lane is a great way to \"see\" the menu based on what other people are eating (just don't turn your back or your neighbor might give in to temptation...\"you gonna finish that?\" nom nom nom).\n\nOliver, our server, was helpful, attentive, engaging, thoughtful, and reminded me a bit of Mr. McBean with his Dr. Seuss-esque handlebar mustache. He made some great recommendations, and was eager to assist in our gastronomical seppuku.\n\nOur ritual began with some cocktails. I've never seen a bar offer such an assortment of mixed drinks without hard alcohol.  We had a Calimocho (coke and red wine) that got HUGE props for its presentation - a coke bottle stuffed into a cocktail shaker filled with shaved ice. The Housemade Pimm's cup with cucumber and mint was also a hit.  But the standout of the night was the mango Michelada - beer and mango juice, with the glass rimmed with a blend of cayenne and salt. (A portion of the proceeds from this particular drink go towards the Maitri Organization, which is an SF-based non-profit group that runs a women's peer to peer help network.)\n\nOur food parade:\n- POPCORN CLAMS: nummy fried clams, perfect consistency and ratio of batter to clam, but ultimately these were just sponges for the old bay remoulade (and we could have used 2-3 times more remoulade)\n- House-made CHICKEN LIVER PATE: this was stellar - rich flavor, a smooth consistency, and a hint of sea salt and chive in every mouthful. Whoa.\n- MUSHROOM PIZZA: mmm...gruyere, thyme and roasted onions - brilliant combo. Zero complaints; and very reminiscent of the pizzas at Beretta.\n- Prather Ranch BURGER: THIS was a damn GREAT burger. Ours was with aged cheddar, and it was moist, juicy, and groan-inducing. The fries were a most excellent compliment, however, to me they were ever-so-so-slightly undercooked i.e., if you held one between your fingers, it would flop over instead of standing up straight (...yeah, sometimes the joke is just too obvious to be worth stating).\n- ROASTED PORCHETTA: I can see a lot of people balking at this entree - imagine a slice of roasted pork belly the size of a Frisbee, which is easily 50+% fat. Granted, it is an authentic Italian delicacy, but it can catch people by surprise. We opted to have a dish of sea salt brought to our table, which we sprinkled over the fattiest portions - this cut the oil, and added a bit of texture, and was a great assist to the dish. The salsas (dashes of each) were an interesting, but not unwelcome accompaniment. The wilted greens, however, were oily and didn't add any character to the dish.\n- SPAGHETTI: WWHHOOOO-HOOOO!!!! THIS was the highlight of the evening. The smokiness of the house-cured bacon, roasted tomato sauce, fresh basil and the jalapano kick: Party. In. My. Mouth. The spaghetti was thick cut, and per-fect-ly al dente. After the first bite of this dish, all three of us needed a private moment.\n\nEVERY item on the dessert menu is appealing. Our guts were completely bursting by this point, but we couldn't not have one dessert. We went with Ed George's peaches with Humphrey Slocombe ice cream. They were out of the olive oil ice cream, so we asked for the balsamic-caramel flavor (against their recommendation). While both the peaches and the ice cream were delicious on their own, the flavors clashed. Still, our amateur mistake, and no marks against our lovely hosts.\n\nWithout any doubt, we will be back because at some point, our bellies will go back to being plain, and our bellies will once again want to have stars upon thars.", "author": "Nils E."}

And, as it turns out, the hours you print on your receipts?\n\nDecided to return home since we live nearby and go back at 11:15.  There were a few tables already seated and we were seated at a table in the back of the restaurant.  There were two women already seated at a table near ours.  Then we waited.  And waited.  The two women near us finally gave up and left.  We flagged someone down who clearly was not supposed to be our server, but she took our order anyway.  She brought the iced tea we ordered and then we never saw her again.  Food runners brought the food, but didn't know who ordered what.  Thinking it was a reasonable request, we asked for some ketchup and then waited some more.  Since he clearly forgot, we asked someone else.   The ketchup finally showed up, but it sure would have been nice to have it while the fries were hot.\n\nThe food was disappointing.  The frittata (unsurprisingly, spelled incorrectly on the menu) was barely warm and, as another Yelper pointed out, it was clearly pre-made.  C'mon folks...even Cafe Flore can manage a made-to-order frittata!  The pulled chicken sandwich is not pulled chicken.  It was chopped chicken and mayonnaise (also known as chicken salad!) with some slaw on it.  I love a good chicken salad sandwich, but call it that so I have a reasonable expectation about what I'm going to get.  \n\nWe never did see our server again.  The guy serving all the tables around us, who probably was supposed to our server, came by after our plates had been cleared and asked how we were doing.   Too little, way too late.  To top it off, there were two women chatting with each other at the host stand as we left.  They didn't even bother to acknowledge us, much less utter a simple \"thanks.\"\n\nWhere's the management in this mess?  The people we saw all seem to be new to the restaurant business and there doesn't seem to be any management watching the store to ensure a smooth opening weekend.  Given the pedigree of the owners, I expected a whole lot more.  Maybe they'll get their act together, maybe not.  Will I go back to find out before they disappoint a lot more people and end up closing?  Dunno.", "author": "Glenn R."}

We were greeted well by the hostess and seated immediately.  That was the end of the good experience.  We sat for upwards of ten minutes before the waitress appeared and brought us water.  We ordered a bottle of champagne and one small oj for mimosa's.  This complex drink order was 10-15 minutes in the making.  Only after the waitress brought the mimosa's did she take our food order.  We've now been sitting here for 25 or so minutes.  Two of our meals come rather quickly, but the 3rd was no where in sight.  We waited a few minutes but begrudgingly began to eat while it was still warmish, only to find that there isn't any flavor to our dishes.  Even the figs had no flavor.  I don't know how they did it, but had I not seen that it was a fig on my fork I would not have been able to tell you what I was eating.  Almost another 10 minutes later, the long awaited burger arrived but didn't stay long.  It was ordered to be medium, but was so raw you could've milked this thing!  Disgusted and just over the whole experience, my friend sent it back and asked that it just be removed from the bill.  As a consolation, the manager brings us a trio of doughnuts to finish off our tasteless meal.  While eating the treats, the waitress stops back by and comments on how they bought them from \"a Mexican girl who rides her bike around selling them\".  She acted like this is a charming selling point.  Ummm...EW!! Where were they cooked? Who's touched them?   At this point we finished off the champagne, which was the best part of the meal, and got the hell out of there.  \n\nThere are certain things you can expect at a new restaurant, such as slow service.  In this case, the entire waitstaff standing around gabbing by the kitchen while most of the room is looking to them for their food.  This forgivable situation can easily be remedied by either a quick refresher on customer service, or termination.  What is inexcusable is the off timing of the food and it coming out raw.

Perhaps it was an off night in the kitchen but....\n\nFOOD: the food is 2.5 stars....yes, and I'm being generous. The appetizers and salads are small (salads doused in white vinegar), the calamari Small Plate, while tasting very good, had only a tiny spoonful of calamari, the pizzas were very disappointing, the desserts were better. Since the pizzas are the mainstay there, I'll explain. They were salty, cheese not so great, toppings very very sparse and the crust dull and under-baked. The Margarita and the Fig/Arugula pizzas fared the best of our choices.\nDRINKS: their wine pours are generous, which is nice. \nAMBIENCE: if you have ear plugs, bring them. The decibels are ear-piercingly, blood-drippingly painful--at least inside that night; the patio may be a bit calmer. \nSERVERS: they were busy...out it comes, down it goes on the table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-08-20", "description": "It goes without saying that Starbelly is going to be better than Asqew Grill, so I give points for that alone. To be honest, I looked at the dinner menu for this place, and was not that stoked to try it, simply because most of the items are things that I don't normally crave. Don't get me wrong: it's definitely a creative and varied selection...it's just not 100% in my comfort zone (brunch, however, has me drooling).\n\nBut I'm glad I let my friend drag me to dinner because the food was delicious and it was a very pleasant dining experience (though loud, like others have mentioned). We decided to split several things: the caesar, the popcorn clams, and the burger. Here's the breakdown:\n\n*Caesar salad with butter lettuce, avocado, and buttery croutons: honestly, I was a bit skeptical about avo in a caesar, but this salad was great. Supper yummy housemade dressing and just enough of it. \n*Popcorn clams: must've been littleneck clams as they kind of looked like squid tentacles to me (tasted pretty much like calamari, too), though to be honest, I've only ever had clams straight outta the shell or clam chowder. The homemade Old Bay remoulade made the dish for sure (and be forewarned that it is rich, rich, rich!). \n*Prather Ranch burger, house cut fries & pickle, grilled brioche bun (with cheddar, of course!): probably the best burger I have ever had. It was melt-in-your-mouth tender and went well with the bun and heirloom tomato. The fries are shoestring style and honestly didn't look that great, but were quite tasty (and I don't really like fries). The clincher, however, is the housemade catsup and grainy mustard. The mustard is to-die-for. I'm a huge mustard aficionado and I would bathe in this stuff.\n\nTo round off our dining experience, we ordered a bottle of wine. It wasn't until we were a half-a-glass in that we noticed it was actually a more expensive bottle, which we had not ordered. Rather than just offering us the price difference--which would have been totally satisfactory to us--they  apologized profusely and comped the whole bottle. It was also quite nice that the self-proclaimed \"wine wench\" was really on top of filling our glasses--we didn't lift the bottle the entire meal. \n\nIt's clear that Starbelly is really aiming to please in these opening months, and here's hoping it stays that way. I will definitely be back--next time for brunch!", "author": "Jasmine F."}

Here's why:\n\nHostess was curt to the point of being rude.  Server was friendly and knowledgeable!  But, our table was so bright I felt like I was in a spotlight.  I asked the server if she could dim the lights, and she said they would \"do that later in the evening,\" and I swear the lights got BRIGHTER a minute later.  \n\nSo, the ambiance didn't work for us, fine.  How about the menu?  Our wine that was essentially unpalatable, and the food we ordered was unimpressive at best: Brussel's sprouts burned on the outside and undercooked on the inside.  No flavor, and I suspect they had parmesan even though we informed our waitress that one of us is lactose-intolerant.  Crab hush puppies fine, but $11 for balls of fried dough with hardly any crab flavor/meat seems excessive.  Mushrooms with croutons and fried egg were exquisite.  Sardines were HUGE and had HUGE bones to match -- not terribly pleasant.  \n\nI bet their pizzas are great, but we won't be back.  I noticed they dimmed the lights on our way out.", "author": "C.

Maybe I was impressed because I've been so conditioned to bad meals in the Castro neighborhood, or maybe it was because the food was really tasty at Starbelly? Both are true, but my review is based on the really great food at Starbelly. \n\nWe had a salad, soup, a couple small plates, pizza and dessert. Many of our choices were based on recommendations from the helpful server.  The Starbelly salad coupled with the gazpacho (w/ spicy avocado) was fresh, simple, tasty and perfect for the rare 90 degree SF day.  Both the clams and the mussels were excellent.  The fig, blue cheese, arugula and spanish ham pizza was a tasty disk of crisp perfection. We based our dessert choice on the recommendation from the server and were not disappointed. I wouldn't normally have chosen lavender pot de creme on my own, but it was heavenly. The bill was surprisingly reasonable for the number of items we had. \n\nI'm not a drinker, but they seemed to have a great selection of beer, wine and newly popular Pim's housemade cocktails. \n\nNow for the bad, the hostess was disorganized and a bit sour. I'll chalk that up to the fact that the restaurant was new. It took longer than it should have to get our seat, but the bartender was friendly, and the communal bar great for people watching. So it wasn't so bad. \n\nOverall, highly recommended, especially in the Castro. This place would be very good in the foodie Mission, but in the dining desert that is the Castro, it's an absolute gem.", "author": "Robert M."}

I live down the block, and my girlfriend and I had both been looking forward to trying it, and finding a great new place to frequent.  Unfortunately, I am not able to write a good review.\n\nCalling Starbelly:\nThe person taking my reservation was less than helpful.  I was immediately put on hold for 5 minutes even though I made sure to call at an off hour.  Then, after giving them my name, a short easy to pronounce last name, they later repeated it back to me incorrectly.  This is a small thing, but it is a pet-peeve of mine, and shows that the person doesn't really care about their customer.\n\nService at Starbelly:\nThe hostess was wonderful and sat us immediately.  That was the end of our good service.  We waited about 15 minutes to see our server.  Somewhere around 10 minutes in, our server sent someone to bring us water, and in the mean time we watched our server taking his time and chatting with another table.  This set the tone for our service.  The rest of the night it was if my girlfriend and I were an annoyance to the server that he had to check in on every 30 minutes.  My girlfriend and I have both waited tables before, so we always treat our servers with the utmost respect.  We didn't have any questions, we had our orders ready, used our \"pleases\" and \"thank yous\", we were ordering multiple drinks...service was still terrible.  It was emotionally painful for me to tip less than 20%, but I still regret that I even tipped as much as I did.  I always give servers the benefit of the doubt, but this service was unacceptable.  I do think/hope that we just got \"the bad server.\"  Everyone else we dealt with seemed very nice, and the other servers seemed to be much more friendly.\n\nFood/Drinks:\nThe drinks were great.  I wish I had just come here to sit at the bar and grab a couple of drinks and appetizers.  The mussels were also amazing.  The chorizo was a great touch and the sauce was by far the best part of our meal.  Unfortunately we had to pay for an order of bread to enjoy it because the mussels only came with one small piece of bread.  We ultimately had to purchase two orders of bread and olive oil even though we didn't want the olive oil and it was wasted.  The fried oysters were okay.  The pizza was adventurous to a fault.  I respect putting lemon on a pizza, and it may have been good if it was subtle, but the lemon was overpowering.  It was all we could taste, and we couldn't finish it.\n\nI wish I had liked Starbelly, but I won't be going back.

For the neighborhood and the price, it's a solid contender but I would not travel on freeways or bridges to get here. I will limit my discussion of food to my recent meal (last weekend). The hush puppies were oily, not spicy enough and limp. The albacore salad was good - the fish was fresh but it was a little too heavy on the mayo and anchovies. The pizza had a delicious crust but suffered under the weight of too much tomato sauce without enough zing to balance out the roasted peppers on it. The garlic on the broccoli side we ordered was burnt. Worst of all though was the undercooked (think hot pink) drumstick that came on a platter of otherwise decent roast chicken. When confronted with the situation, our detached waiter grabbed an equally unemotional manager who told us that the chicken was brined for taste and color was not raw. (The other pieces of chicken on the platter had no such fluorescent color.).

It's like food Russian Roulette.\n\nThe Service: Somewhere between bad and terrible--the last time we were there, a friend's order got messed up (see: raw chicken above), so they brought us a \"complimentary\" side of bacon...which later wound up on our bill. \n\nThe Drinks: Yum--The Pimm's Cup is so delicious and I would keep coming back just for that, if it weren't for the other issues.

Maybe because it can be tricky to find parking around here?  Perhaps because the crowd reflects the \"diversity\" of the neighborhood?\n\nDare I make a slightly political statement, but neither of the aforementioned should matter when it comes down to great food, friendly service, and an overall fantastic atmosphere.\n\nI am a big fan of Beretta and Delarosa.  To complete the trifecta, yesterday I took a friend to lunch here.  It was a Saturday around 1:00 pm and we had both worked up a ravenous appetite from our morning of docent training at the SF Symphony.  \n\nFirst, I have to rave about the brunch menu.  Around here, brunch has grown to encompass things beyond your basic waffles, granola and scrambled eggs.  (These were options, though!)  But if you love the light and crispy pizzas with genius flavor profiles (squash/sage/pumpkin seed/goat cheese, anyone?) there were 4 or 5 available.  Hungry for a sandwich?  I had the porchetta which is not to be missed!  The arugula and jalapeno relish accent the salty warmed pork beautifully.  The had three salads which sounded remarkably fresh and light.\n\nSo now matter what you're looking for, Starbelly is sure to serve it up!  With a smile... or at least good style.\n\nAnd my inner Martha Stewart was totally drooling over their outdoor plant boxes.  The interior is ultra stylish and even the pizza boxes are adorable.  Hard to resist, really.\n\nI can't wait to go back for dinner.  In Beretta-fashion, I would expect the cocktail list to be impressive.  A follow up review is already in the cards.

Sadly, the good service ended at the door (see below).  Food: Really good!  Some standouts: 1) Roasted pork shoulder - yummy combination of sweet (grilled pear) and spicy (salsa verde) which complemented the pork on a bed of cheddar grits perfectly; 2) Pan roasted mussels - served with chorizo, chiles and cilantro.  Deliciously spicy and enough sauce left over for bread dunking; 3) Starbelly bacon pizza - I love arugula on pizza and this pie did not disappoint.  All in all: fresh and flavorful ingredients at very reasonable prices.\n\nCONS:  The service.  We were treated to sub-standard service by three different wait staff haphazardly assigned to our table.  Here are some highlights:  1) We ordered the cheese and salumi combination to start and were given four (4) pieces of bread.  For nine people.  When we asked for more, it was as if we were requesting extra saffron or truffle oil.  By the time the extra bread arrived, we were done with the appetizers.  2) We ordered a bottle of wine.  When the waitress approached me to pour a glass, I asked her to start w/ the person that had ordered it so he could give it a taste, not realizing that he already had done so (again, party of nine and we were on opposite ends of the table).  Major attitude as she corrected me, and if she could have stuck me in a corner w/ a dunce cap for making such a mistake, she would have!  3) When one of the main dishes arrived, we were barked at for not clearing our table to make room.\n\nAll in all: Sorry, Starbelly - no more business from us.

We don't live in SF although that may be changing in the near future. \n\nI had heard from someone that Starbelly \"wasn't perfect, but it was sure nice having a decent, grownup restaurant in the neighborhood.\" So our expectations were kept in check. \n\nPerhaps it was just our server. Or Leah the hostess. Or one of the several people that stopped by our table through out the evening, but everyone was incredibly friendly without being cloying. \n\nI thought the food was quite good and the price-point felt appropriate: not a value-restaurant, but not overpriced by any means. \n\nWe had the pate, the octopus, the clams, the porcetta, and the lamb cheeks. The pate was great. The clams were pretty good (my SO liked them significantly more than I did). The octopus, highly recommended by this site as well as the server, was a bit of a letdown. Not crispy enough, not flavorful enough and not all that wonderful. The lamb cheeks were good. The meat was well-flavored and the accompanying greens and grits were delicious. The porcetta was, for me, a pretty interesting dish. It's basically a pork belly and the restaurant included a good deal of the fat. In LA (and I imagine in most of SF), it's a bit odd to see that much unctuous fat on a plate. I asked the server about the reaction to the dish (I mean, let's face it, there are some very body-conscious men in the neighborhood as well as the restaurant itself). She said some people pick around the fat, others eat it. I thought it was great. Fat doesn't scare me. But I don't think the dish is for everyone. It also was well-received by the reviewers, but it wasn't hard to imagine someone freaking out over it. But the pork was delicious: not too dry and not overly seasoned. \n\nThe chocolate doughnut is terrific. The accompanying ice cream is great and the chiles add just the right combination of interest. \n\nI have to say, for all the complaints people have had over the wait (it's a new, popular restaurant...call an hour and a half before and put your name on the list...at least they don't make you STAND there and wait for that long), I thought it was well worth the money, the effort and the expectation.", "author": "Emil W."}

So.........where to go?\n\nI remembered an article I read about the place and their communal table made from a piece of bowling alley floor.  So we spun around to Starbelly and were pleased to hear they could seat us immediately.\n\nThe main reason I'm giving this 4 stars is because the wine list didn't work for us.  We tried 5 of the reds by the glass, but none of them met our expectations (and honestly I DO NOT think we're the worst of the wine snobs out there).  We ended up ordering a bottle of Chilean red which turned out to work just fine.  But as you can imagine...this had us a bit worried about the food.\n\nDelighted to say from here the rest of the meal was fantastic!  We ordered:\n- grilled baby gems salad\n- fried smelt\n- roasted beets\n- asparagus/crab soup\n- pork with wilted greens and grits\n- affigado dessert\n\nAll really fantastic - but my favorites were the salad, smelt and beets.   Next time I would add the pate and roasted chicken which looked amazing...\n\nMy only other issue?  The service was a bit too fast.  Everything must have been put into the kitchen at the same time...so I felt a bit rushed.

The food, the atmosphere and the service are all outstanding! \n\nPizzas have a nice, thin crust and are delicious. Several unique combinations as well as the classic margherita. \n\nPasta has a wonderful handmade texture and flavor and I like how they use jalapeno for spice rather than red chili. It gives the dishes heat with a fresh flavor rather than the stale heat you get with dried red chili.\n\nThe crab louie salad is the best thing on the lunch menu hearty, fresh and tons of flavor! That and a glass of wine is the perfect lunch!     \n\nI have not been disappointed by anything i've had yet! In every dish you can taste the quality of the fresh ingredients! Nice wine list which pairs very nicely with all of their dishes!\n\nThe pot de creme is outstanding, with just a sprinkle of sea salt. Its the kind of thing that makes you want to eat forever! \n\nAnd the service adds to the quality of the meal. Everyone is friendly and attentive. The one and only problem i had was taken care of quickly and professionally and i couldn't be more pleased; i found a hair in my salad once. The waiter notified the chef who came out  immediately. He took responsibility for it (eventhough it wasn't his fault, the guy was bald!) , appologized and offered to make me a new one, or make me something different. And, they also comp'ed my drinks!  \n\nDinner time can get a little crowded and the wait can be quite long; but its a good sign that they're doing something right that makes people want to wait outside for an hour to eat here!\n\nMy hat's off Starbelly!", "author": "e p."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2010-01-26", "description": "Maybe because it's later (around 8:45 p.m.) Sunday night, and wine by the glass is always a gamble, my first experience at Starbelly is disappointing.  I hear it is staffed well, so despite it isn't love at first sight, I will return for second chance.\n\nParking is always a bitch in that neighborhood, so I make my own space next to a real one in the bank parking lot. (Any officer would see the extra line if he used his imagination.)  It works.\n\nUpon entering, chance serves my friend and I well, and we are seated at a well appointed little table, right next to the giant window that looks onto the patio, which, on a nice sunny day, is the ideal brunch spot, I imagine.  Thankfully, despite the wet and cold out there now, it's warm and cozy inside, even next to our big window.  Bon Iver's \"Skinny Love\" is meandering on the soundwaves, and my ears smile. Good soundtrack all through the meal. I'm happy I can hear it.\n\nWe each order a glass of Primitivo del Salento that is sadly \"uncaricato,\" (uncharged).  We're not starving, but want something to spread the ribs and tantalize the tongue.  I'm an adoring fan of most things Southern, and am bemused when Bay Area chefs attempt a fusion of all-things-fresh and Californian with the iconically heavy, tasty soul food.  So of course, I order the Dungeness Crab Hushpuppies with a louie sauce.  For a fusion, they're perfect! For a hush puppy, they're perfect!  Crisp, fresh out of the fryer, and best yet, filled with succulent crab meat.  They are the highlight of my meal, and worth capitalizing.\n\nMy friend orders the roasted wild mushrooms with a great levain crouton and sunny side up duck egg.  Innovative dish, but the shrooms are stinkin' burnt - so long, Flavor! Pity, it's mushroom season.   And dare I say it?  In my opinion, the dish lacks salt.  Two points for texture - the duck egg saves the night.\n\nWe share a pizza that also comes out a bit worse for the flame...I'm sure the subtleties of aged blue cheese and pear would come across more clearly if my tongue wasn't so focused on a burnt, dry crust.  Bummer.  The Spanish ham, on the other hand - kudos to that!  Tasty, moist and amply covers the top of the pizza.\n\nDessert.  Rosemary shortbread cookies accompany a salted caramel pots de creme.  Once some of the abundant sea salt is dusted off the top, the pots de creme is indulgent and everything one can hope caramel pudding can ever be.  The saline theme is a bit over-bearing when it reoccurs too heavily on the shortbreads.  Nevertheless, crunchy bits of rosemary in the buttery cookie keep my mouth wanting more, and as long as I skim below the surface of the pots de creme, I am quite satisfied with cookie and pudding.\n\nYa get another shot, Starbelly.  Only one try on a Sunday night is not fair.  Here's to a brighter second go-round. May you shine brightly.", "author": "britney b."}

I love that you can get $3 10oz beers (I don't need a large 16 oz for lunch, so that is perferct.  Please don't ever take that off the menu).\n- Food is solid.  I wouldn't say amazing but with the price point the way it is, I think it's great.  \n- Had the side salad, hot-dog, and a beer.

I don't know of many other spots in the area that fit that bill.\n\nSuggestions to the owners:\n- add some description to that chicken sandwich..sounds dry/dull the way it is written.\n- keep in mind the business/client customer lunches as your place is great for that.\n- maybe add some specials on purchasing wine during the day - not sure how you're going to sell any bottles during the day at those prices...maybe add more options to the by-the-glass.\n- don't mess with the 10oz beer...it's perfect and gets folks drinking and enjoing and buying.\n- on that note, your beer selection is under-rated.\n- one that outdoor patio is open, hype-it.\n\n\n\n\nJust a solid place, I think.

There is Kris (Chris?), our (hot) server, twice, who was attentive and polite and also had some kick-ass old-school glasses. There was the hostess, whose name escapes me, who sat us within 4 minutes of our arrival even though our party of 9 arrived in bits and pieces.

The same server also cleared my plate and asked me if i wanted any dessert.  The only time my actual server came back was to drop off the check and compliment my shoes.  I will definitely go back because the food was quite tasty, but some work definitely needs to be done about the service.", "author": "larry w."}

I think I'm the wrong demographic for Starbelly...it's definitely something for the 30-somethings (and under.)  It has all the hallmarks of the trendy, youth-oriented restaurants springing up around the city:  no real decor to speak of; reservations only for large groups, so a solo diner is relegated to an uncomfortable backless stool at a communal table; extremely loud (but good for eavesdropping); a mishmash of small plates which are good for grazing with drinks but difficult to build an actual meal from.\nThe saving grace is the quality of the food.

As we discussed whether to leave and find another place to eat, the hostess practically begged us not to, assuring us that \"I want to make it up to you.\"  She seemed sincere and she convinced us to give them another chance -- so we stayed.  In retrospect this was a mistake.  The only thing that they did was they brought us a bowl of complimentary cold french fries and 2 other small appetizers that we didn't order, and that was it.

My friend's burger was ok, but the fries were freezing cold and had to be sent back.  And, that was the best part of the meal. My pizza (squash with pumpkin seeds and black garlic) was absolutely inedible. It was tasteless and dripping with oil, literally. Don't misunderstand...I'm not one of these people who blots the oil from my pizza or anything like that...what I mean to say is that it was literally as if they took a half a cup of oil and dumped it onto the crust in lieu of anything that might have given it actual flavor. Not wanting to waste it, I took half of it home, only to throw it away after I picked up a slice and the plate was filled with oil. Yuck. Starbelly, a copious quantity of olive oil on pizza does not mean that it will taste good. I will not be back after this episode.

The drinks accommodate all, from the underage to the lush, offering a wide selection of refreshing virgin concoctions as well as fun cocktails, and various wine and beer.  My date and I shared the clam popcorn, chicken liver pate, mussels, marinated Japanese cucumber salad, and the spaghetti.  The clam was more of a super crunchy batter than anything else, while the pate was overwhelming in portion as it was rich.  I enjoyed the salad because I love Japanese cucumbers and they paired well with olives, tomatoes and feta cheese.  The mussels were average, since the broth that accompanied them wasn't as praiseworthy as others I've had elsewhere.  However, my date and I both agreed that the spaghetti tasted fresh and delicious, with just enough basil.  As for the drinks, I prefer the champagne cocktail over the calimocho.  My date wanted to try the fig crumble with caramel balsamic ice cream which was interesting but not so indulgent.

J and I were late, and when we arrived by 7, we found that, luckily, the half of our party that arrived on time, was allowed to be seated without us (some places don't). And, we werent the latest people (yay), more came after. I had a strange but good drink, it had tea and egg whites and other stuff, but it was cold, and in a martini glass. It was a cocktail but with tea instead of alcohol. Tasty. We ate family style, and I think almost all of the starters and small plates got ordered. I (and others dining with me) would say that the small plates and apps are the best parts of the menu. The entrees listed were pretty boring and plain looking. I honestly couldn't decide which I wanted, because they all looked rather dull. Fortunately, we all decided to skip the entrees and just nibble. I liked the pate, although it could have used more bread to go with the amount of spreads they gave. The crab puffs were good, as well as the fries (especially the green dipping sauce), and the cheese/pear plate. I really enjoyed the mussles as well, and since J and I were the only ones on our half of the table who liked mussles, we got to eat quite a lot of them. Also ordered, that I did not try, were a cold cuts plate, an olive plate (ick olives) and some large, whole, sardines, which we passed to the other side of the table. To finish, we ordered some pizzas. I had a piece of the pear pizza, which was good, but kind of bland. All of these filled us up pretty well, so we skipped dessert. The restaurant itself was nice looking, and convenient to get to, once I realized where it was, and our waiter was very friendly. They had bottles of water right on the table, so I never had to go thirsty, which is always a major plus for me. I enjoyed my dinner a lot, but although my friend who invited me LOVES this restaurant and comes ALL THE TIME, I think it was just pretty good. I would come again, if someone else suggested it, but probably not venture there again on my own, and when polled, J had the same opinion as mine.

Oh the service. We had a waiter that I'd had at bacar before and he was delightful there. Here, I don't know what happened. We didn't see him much, had to flag him down a few times (though the food related issues were not his fault) we sat forever waiting for the check and waiting for our cards to be rung up. Non-waiter issues on service were worse, we called before we ventured out there, they told us they opened at 4pm for drinks. We got there at 4:45pm, and were turned away, they weren't open yet. Maybe you should communicate that with the whole staff. We sat down at our table probably around 5:15, and were told by the hostess, \"I don't think this will be a problem, but I need this table by 8pm.\" Honey, if we take more than 2.75 hours to eat pizza and appetizers and drink beers, I'm going to guess it's not due to us, it's due to slow service. Our salumi plate came out with just 2 of the 3 items, we had to ask to get our 3rd item. We ordered the bean puree, it never arrived, but showed up on our bill. Which brings up the huge bone I have to pick with Starbelly's owner/sister resto, Beretta.

The pessimist in me would say that it was 3/4 empty, which made our server's slight disinterest in our drink order somewhat annoying, but not tragically so. Speaking of drinks, I know this is a touch nit-picky, but I don't understand a beer menu that refers to a \"small\" and a \"large.\" When I order a \"large\" beer I am expecting more than a pint. A pint is not  \"large,\" a pint is a pint, so call it a pint and stop playing games. A large beer should be something in the neighborhood of 20oz. The BLT was solid but the fries were soggy and over-seasoned. I like flavorful food but shouldn't be driven to sneeze the second a plate is put in front of me. But alas, I can't base an opinion on the inconsistent fries as much as I would like to. Instead I will base my opinion on the quality of the ceasar salad, which was downright dreamy. In the end the space won me over, my wife enjoyed her food and even though the service was slow, it wasn't exactly unpleasant enough to leave a permanent negative impression. I will definitely give Starbelly another shot.", "author": "crow s."}

We were just going to poke our heads in and move on but I'm glad that we were able to get seated. Overall it's a nice place with good food and a friendly staff. The day we were there I believe was their first weekend. They were out of something and you can sense they were a bit in the weeds but as a former waiter there was nothing terrible in our experience. The michelada with mango was mmm different but alright and for charity. My salad with tuna was very delish, a decent sized portion. I love olives so I was happy.  The stringy fries were nice n light n guilt free- the portion was moderate and great to share with others that like to indulge in the occasional somewhat not all that healthy treat. What else? Others at my table ordered vegetarian friendly foods, some drinks and they were all happy. The signature quirky donut was the only thing that was a little out of place. I'm not into that sort of thing and the guy that ordered it wasn't all that pleased either but... it did disappear. So there. The place itself is very sharp. As a new place in a good location it's also great to people watch. I think they will have a patio too. That would be good. I generally don't like shared benches and bar stools.

Neat, clean, service WONDERFUL!  Steven was our waiter and could not have been more attentive and pleasant.  He obliged by taking photos of us together with BOTH our cameras.  We had a great selection to chose from, but had the BLT.  It was the bomb!  Fresh tasting, great flavored bacon, FABU bread and we even split the small salad and an order of fries with the 3 spectacular tasting \"dips\".  We left JUST enough room for a shared dessert, the hot fruit crumble!  We were in heaven!  No one \"rushed us out\" and let us chat and chew to our hearts content.  The weather was perfect and never even circled the block-got a parking spot right nearby!  All in all, a wonderful place and we can't wait to take our husbands back to treat us to one of their weekend brunches soon!  Nice new addition to the Castro area!  Don't miss this.  All the best luck to them.  Anyone that braves this economy and opens up a restaurant must REALLY love what they are doing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-08-23", "description": "I have now officially become a Starbelly Stalker. Yes folks, I have dined at Starbelly six times in the scant week that they have been open and every experience has been top-notch. \n\nThe beauty of Starbelly is that it is not striving to be the next in your face, avant-garde, hipper than thou flash in the pan.  The partners Edmondo Sarti, Deborah Blum and Adriano Paganini, Executive Chef Adam Timney, and the entire staff are passionate about creating a comfortable yet sophisticated atmosphere. All of this is delivered with grace at a price point that is shockingly reasonable for an SF eatery.\n\nThe interior design is quite brilliant. They did not rely upon the use of the same tired formulas used throughout SF's culinary scene that other restaurants try to pass off as hip and original even though it really is just so ten years ago. You know the style... enormous pivoting steel doors, uncomfortable seating, statement light fixtures, and pseudo-green touches. Starbelly's style, on the other hand, is chic, comfortable, and truly green. Anything salvageable left behind by the former restaurant was repurposed and or reused. Walls and patio are clad in reclaimed lumber of various shades, species, and sizes. Lighting is simple, yet stylish, recycled cardboard or glass pendants. The bar, which transitions into the communal table, was created from a repurposed bowling lane - totally fun! One of my favorite touches is the bar's surround which is a stroke of genius created from the icky old Askew table tops which have been chopped to size, applied in a staggered pattern and stained a flat black creating a very cool texture.  I cannot wait to be able to sit outside on the gorgeous deck and dine surrounded by those lush vegetable/herb boxes which were planted by the Chef himself who I hear is an avid gardener.\n\nThe opening events were spectacular. The servers and busboys were all amazingly cheerful and attentive. The food was beyond scrummy.  The comments overheard from fellow attendees were astoundingly positive. Everyone was clamoring over the food, which was lip-smacking and abundant. The kitchen staff was sharp and service was so good that many people could not believe that it was a brand new restaurant yet to open. Several attendees immediately proclaimed their love and desire to marry or otherwise steal Chef Timney. (One of these proclamations came from a couple that had been sent to crash a tasting dinner by a food-writer friend of theirs.) While kinks in the sound-system early in the week did cause the music to be party-atmosphere loud, (can you blame them for being excited?) the bugs seem to have been worked out and at my last meal was at a quite pleasurable sound level.\n\nBecause I have had a variety of out-of-town visitors of all ages (4yrs-60+) this week I have returned multiple times since the opening. I chose to bring them to Starbelly because the menu really has something for everyone. The list of farms showcased on the Starbelly website is a true testimony to Chef Timney 's passion for showcasing the purity of his ingredients which shine throughout. \n\nI have tasted much of the menu so far and have loved every bite. To highlight:\n\n* Brunch: We had sourdough pancakes, French toast, Greek yogurt with granola and market fresh fruit, and the fried egg sandwich. All were awfully delectable as were the Calimocho and French-pressed coffee. \n* House-made Mini Corndogs: D-licious!! Tender and juicy homemade hotdog bites dipped in a fabulously fluffy batter. These are a big crowd-pleaser and the reason for my return visit tonight. \n* Muscles w/Chorizo (Mmmmm...chorizoooo) | Octopus | Scallops: As with all of the seafood on the menu, these luscious dishes were treated with the care and respect needed to properly cook them. They were divine.\n* Leaf-lettuce Salads: While these are admittedly more simplistic than the trendy mixed and micro green salads that dot the city, they are utterly refreshing.\n* Pizzas: Starbelly pizzas how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. Queen Margherita would have been quite proud of her namesake. The tomato sauce on this and the other tomato-based pizzas was beautiful and delicate and brought me back to Italy in one bite. Figgy pie...better with or without ham I cannot decide. I just must eat it both ways over and over and over until I can determine a winner. \n* Prather Ranch Burger: Simply the best burger in ages! Chef Adam's catsup & mustard recipes are so tasty as are his other sauces. \n* Lamb cheeks: Really make me want to traipse through the countryside pinching little lambies. These are succulent and tender and not overly seasoned which would obscure the delicate flavor of cheek meat.\n* Desserts: LEAVE ROOM. It seems as though the non-traditional ingredients in the desserts are confusing to some diners. I wish that I could stamp the menus with \"Shut up. Don't think. Just eat. You will say, 'YUM'!!\"\nOkay, I have gone on long enough. Explore the rest on your own. See you at Starbelly!", "author": "CJ S."}

More often, not. The issues that others have reported here with slow, incompetent service have been consistently true for me, too. One problem seems to be dispatch from the ktichen. Dishes come out of the kitchen and they go randomly to tables. Courses come out of order. Things you didn't order show up. Stuff you order never shows up. Soups come without spoons. My most memorable visit was when my soup came without a spoon. I sat with my soup for a while, then I finally saw my server and asked her for a spoon. I watched her pick up a spoon by the bowl (i.e., the eating end) with her bare hand and offer it to me. The fact that it was a teaspoon and not a soup spoon just added insult to injury. I don't know how they make hiring decisions for wait staff, but hiring is obviously not based on skill or experience. Wait staff don't know the food and they don't know food safety, and nobody at Starbelly seems to know or care about what they don't know. I live a block from this place and I never go there anymore.

All the salumis, pickles and assorted condiments were smooth and tasty! We shared the apple and celery root salad which made you forget that you had no actual greens.  Shared 2 diverse pizzas, the bacon, jalapeno & arugula as well as the market mushrooms with gruyere with roasted onions. Both are on the thinnest crust imaginable (the kind I love) and both had nothing but the freshest and tastiest ingredients. It will make you stay clear of thick crust, nasty, old & stale, childhood-type pizzas.  One of our friends got the hamburger made with Prather beef and the absolutely wonderful Pt. Reyes blue cheese. While it was good, it wasn't great. I think our pizzas made him jealous and he had to say it was a good burger no matter what!  Ending it all with the rice pudding was divine.....even if you're not a rice pudding fan, you will love this version with the sweetest (but sour) cherries and hazlenuts that just stand out amongst the melt in your mouth pudding.  Ambience is fun but a little loud. It is difficult to hear across the table but for such great food, it's worth the need to lean in a little to hear your friends.

I have to admit I was a little \"iffy\" about the name at first, but after eating here, it's now my new San Francisco favorite!  The ambiance is upscale casual and hip, yet very comfortable and down to earth.  It has just enough noise to feel alive and happening, but not overpowering in any way.  The food is amazing!  Everything from appetizers to dessert was great - nothing skipped a beat!  We were a big group and tried many things...I especially loved the little gems salad, french fries and spicy pizza!  I will NEVER forget the chicken - anyone who comes to this restaurant MUST order that dish!  Wine list is well priced and pretty diverse.  The service was warm, welcoming and friendly and went out of their way to accomodate us.  It's even located in a convenient, easy to find spot!  (This is important for out-of-towners...)  I'd recommend Starbelly to everyone I know!", "author": "kimberly s."}

Our party of 3 stopped in at 7:00 on a Saturday to put our name on the list while we had a drink across the street for the estimated 45 minute wait. After 45 minutes turned into 2 hours and we were finally seated. The hostess offered us two complementary appetizers to make up for the awful wait and things were looking up. By 9:00 the place had been packed for several hours and several choices were no longer available so our entire party ended up ordering the porchetta a dish that I'm often eaten in Italian markets, where it's usually served on a panino. I lived in Italy for over 6 years and this is not a dish that is often found in restaurants; possibly because it is difficult to present in an attractive way . Starbelly's version of porchetta was a center cut so large that it covered the plate. The sauces slathered on the meat were quite tasty ; but, the serving was so large that throughout the meal, my plate resembled a biology project gone amuck. In the dim light it was also difficult to distinguish between the tasty white lean pork and the white glutinous fat that surrounded the lean meat. This added up to inevitable mistakes and awkward dining moments. The dish was tasty; but, it's really not restaurant food.--more pork belly than Starbelly. If Starbelly would open up a booth at the Castro Wednesday market and sell this on a roll, I'd be the first in line. But, as presented it didn't work. I usually don't rush back to restaurants where I've been kept waiting for 2 hours; but, Starbelly is so appealing that I'm sure that in time I'll give it another try for a late lunch when the crush has subsided. The rest or the menu was appealing and if their pizza is as good as Baretta and if they'll add Pesche's warm octopus and potato salad to the menu, I'll be your biggest fan; but, the Porchetta was Misery on a plate to eat.", "author": "Rick F."}
