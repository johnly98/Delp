The inside of the restaurant is gorgeous with high ceilings, large windows and a great fireplace. We ordered 3 small plates all at reasonable prices and they were all delicious. I had the Crispy Garlic Fries and they were exactly as advertised. They were crispy and had just enough garlic. I find that often garlic fries are over seasoned or greasy and that was not the case here. 10/10. My partner ordered Buffalo Chicken Wings and really enjoyed them (but he made me eat his celery as usual lol). We shared the Chicken Nachos and asked for no black beans and jalepenos on the side. They got it just right. The chicken was moist and not dry and the dish was more than enough for a meal.

I was not the only person dining alone at 10pm looking tired and disheveled. There was also a family, a group of people that looked like business associates, some women that appeared to be on a Mom's night out and couples barely speaking to each other while they watched sports on the silent TVs.\n\nI ordered the Evian water for $8. I'm not sure if that was what I actually got or not as the server delivered it with the bottle already opened and the lid in hand. I'm going to suspend my cynicism and say it really was designer H2O, because I don't want to believe I might have been scammed.\n\nThe Salad Nicoise (about $18) was smaller than I expected, but the kitchen got my request just right for the tuna to be just  little bit more than seared. The salad came with one piece of bread served on a salad plate that the waitress put over my bread plate creating a teeter totter effect - an action that now seems a bit stranger than it did at the time. I was offered another piece of the very dry and chewy little roll (that reminded me of a bag of bread I got at a big box store once) when I was almost done with the salad. I said yes on principle, and ate it because I'll apparently eat anything made of flour that can be loaded with butter.\n\nI ordered a $4 Ginger Ale when the salad arrived and was offered a refill two bites away from finishing my salad. Surprise! I actually declined.\n\nIf I ever stay on the North Point Hyatt or the hotel across the street again, and if I have gone all day with out eating and it's after 9pm then I will absolutely return -  if just for the warm pub like atmosphere and the cozy electric fire place that is almost hidden from view.

The server we had at the start switched with another with no explanation or apparent \nreason. They were friendly enough considering your in the tourist area. Don't expect them to chat or joke around with you. Not much for smiling either.\n\nThe food was outstanding. We order two pints the Ahi Tuna Poke and the Crab and Clam Chowder. The tuna was tender and fresh, very light and tasty. The chowder, wow. Light, creamy and with crab in it in addition gave it an amazing rich flavor I haven't seen anywhere else on the pier. It was served in a bread bowl, as is tradition, but they also toasted the bread which gave a nice light crunch, great for dipping. \n\nPrice was reasonable and considering the other options in the area, very affordable.

I'd walked by this restaurant a few times but hadn't tried it until last night.  \n\nMy partner and I walked in and from a first impression, the place is a nice establishment. Immediately we noticed a sign that asked the customer to take a seat and a server would be with us to take our order so we looked around for two seats.  A server immediately pointed at a few options and we took a seat.  Service was prompt and attentive, there were a lot of staff which allowed them to walk around and check on the customer - some even went around filling glasses with beverages similar to fine dining.  We then placed our orders, burgers with truffle fries.  When our food arrived it looked very appetizing.  The only problem was the taste.  I found it to be very bland and boring for the price $16 a burger plus $1 for any add ons. I asked my partner what he thought of his and he too was not impressed.  \n\nAll in all, the service was good but the food lacked anything special which made the entire experience a bit vanilla.   In thinking about it now, even the service was just bland, it felt very scripted and rehearsed like when you go to a real old resort hotel or an old country club.  If there was one change I'd make, it would start with the kitchen and then I'd look at the service approach and add something unique to help differentiate the establishment from any other typical place.  \n\nHope this helps.", "author": "Gabriel B."}

The ambience is wonderful and waitress was courteous and friendly. But the food was more than lacking. I ordered two pizzas, the truffle mushroom with feta and the classic pepperoni, while my wife ordered a Caesar salad.  The mushroom pizza wasn't bad but wasn't good either -- just a big nothing.  The pepperoni pizza lacked almost all flavor except for the horrendous sauce which tasted like it came directly from a tomato paste can with no seasoning at all.  I tried to scrape some of the mushrooms and feta onto the pepperoni pizza hoping it would help but it was useless.  My wife's salad was no better and was merely lettuce with a little bit of uninspired dressing on it. We ended up leaving almost all the food, paying our over $80 bill and going to bed hungry.

The food tastes highly processed, and came to our table cold.  Our waiter forgot to tell the kitchen my request to leave the jalapenos off my nachos...and then tried to convince me that they weren't very hot, so shouldn't bother me.  That took incredible crust to suggest to me, because I'd made it very clear when I gave him my order that I won't eat jalapenos, and would send the dish back if they were on my food when it arrived.  I made good on my promise, and by the time he brought out a new plate without jalapenos, everyone else in my party had already finished their meals :(\n\nOur server was Russian (he told us this) and very grumpy, especially because we had a child in our party, a well-behaved 2-year-old who made no mess, unlike his mother, who accidentally knocked over her glass of water.  The server seemed to assume the toddler was responsible, even though we assured him he wasn't, and the glass itself wasn't broken, just on its side.  Regardless, accidents happen, a good server takes these things in stride and doesn't make his customers feel like criminals over a spilled glass of water.\n\nWould I go back here?  Maybe, if I was in the neighborhood and Albona was closed (as it was that night).  But generally speaking, there are thousands of other restaurants in this city with better food, more gracious service, and significantly lower prices.  That said, it's clean, spacious, and located right across from a hotel, near the Embarcadero...so for tourists who are looking for a decent place near their hotel to grab a margarita with a friend, this is a solid choice.", "author": "Amy L."}

So I ordered the crab & shrimp Louie salad and my husband ordered the sourdough grilled cheese w/ fries. The grilled cheese was really good (I don't know about $16 good, but it was still delicious & buttery). My salad, however, was definitely NOT worth the $19 we paid. The shrimp were very small and obviously not fresh in any way. The crab was also very cold, like it was just thawed, somewhat watery, and had a packaged taste to it. The drinks are $4 a piece for soda & iced tea. The service was very good, though, and we liked the atmosphere.
