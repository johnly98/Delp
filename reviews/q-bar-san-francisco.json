Lots of Castro bars are known for making simple stuff - vodka cranberry, vodka coke, gin and ginger, etc. But Q Bar will turn out a good dirty martini or lemon drop.\n\nIn my last review, I said a lot of things I'll call \"heterophobic.\" Sorry! I think Q Bar has changed in the past two years - events have definitely focused a bit more heavily on making queer spaces. Even dollar drink Mondays - insofar as I've been - have become more subdued. But I do know LGBT people who still have that lingering feeling that this bar is \"too straight.\" Let me at least clarify that: there's no such thing as too straight. The gay community should and does welcome diversity in sexual orientation. It's just that some Q Bar patrons don't always seem that reciprocally welcoming. But my hat's off to management & owners for doing their best with it and changing their event lineup.", "author": "David S."}

I was holding my cardigan (tiny ass sweater), set it on the empty bar where no one was ordering, to tie my shoe and the bartender pushed it on the gross sticky floor and  yelled at me \"no shit on my bar\".Before leaving that night, I approached him and told him, in a nice tone, I'm sorry if my sweater was in the way, but I would have appreciated if he would have asked me to remove it instead. Now this guy was very tall, I'm a 5'1.. he replied to me saying It wasn't him who did it, it was a customer and that I'm coming at him very aggressively. HE LIED! I saw his whole body fling my sweater at me from the floor and make eye contact with me! And then told me I was being aggressive.. idk his name but that guys is a piece of shit.

Lots of people dancing and having a great time. Was super fun to be a part of. \n\nThe prices were good, too... especially for being in Cali and S.F. I pay the same in Boise, Idaho; however, there you got a chip for a free drink, which was bad ass!  2 for 1 drinks... good drinks, too! \n\nThe only thing that I didn't like was that there wasn't a toilet.

By this time, I was very upset. The bar back scurried out the bar avoiding eye contact, then the bartender approached me. He condescendingly asked, \"What's your problem, it obvious you have a problem, I made you another drink.\" I explained to him is not about a whiskey and coke its about their rude bar back and disrespectful customer service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-01", "description": "Revisiting my review after a few more visits. Here's a cautionary tale for the ladies. \n\nI always come on weekends so I don't know how the other days are like. But Q Bar can always be relied upon for something memorable, whether it be pleasant or an event that makes you wish you had brain bleach. Here is one such event: \n\nSCENE: Picture a pervy old bisexual...straight...I don't know...just pervy old dude trolling around trying to pick up on young girls. My friends and I came here together for a girl's night out (+1 male DD) and we're all women in our mid 20's. The guy tried to pick me up first, presumably because I look the straightest out of all my friends? I was too tired to humor anyone and he's not the team I bat for, so I turned him away. Thus, he moved on to my friend. She was buzzed so she too turned him away. So third time is the charm. Mr. Pervy moves onto the next friend who's too nice for her own good and they start dancing. \n\nSince he reeled one in, he thought he had an \"in\" with us and forcibly grabbed everyone to join in. I really wasn't feeling it and I don't think any guy ever has any right to grab a woman so I quickly danced away...backwards and into the crowd. Seriously, who does this fool this he is? Hugh Hefner? Gross. Minutes later, I felt bad for bailing on my friend and leaving her with a creeper so I turned back to help her get away. What do I find? A highly traumatized friend. In the short time I was gone, he got aggressive and tried to ambush kiss her. He wasn't drunk either, just drunk on his libido. Fortunately, she grabbed our male friend and he pretended to be her boyfriend so the predator left the club because he didn't want any altercation with a guy. \n\nAcronyms that oh so accurately describe how I felt after hearing a disturbingly graphic recount of the incident: \n\nAt the time: DNW\nImmediately afterwards: FML...FHL...\nIn retrospect: LMFAO (only funny when you're no longer in the moment and your friend has a sense of humor)\nOverall impression: WTF...ugh\n\nWe also see a few lesbian cougars every time we come here so keep in mind that this place has a tendency to attract older patrons, one of which might be an aggressive pervy old guy going to a gay venue to pick up girls! He's lucky he didn't mess with me because I'm not as nice as my friend and I would've kicked him in the balls. Ladies, if you come here, watch out for yourself and don't let your guard down just because you think you're safe at a gay club.", "author": "Nancy C."}

At 4 in the afternoon, the room was already in a buzzing state of dranktitude (cheapest bar I've ever come across in Castro!) and jumping with dance energy thanks to a deejay that spun an engaging set of hip-hop and R&B (kind of a rarity here, from my few experiences).\n\nWhile in line to get in,w e got flashed some bubbies; not an uncommon occurrence. It kind of sets the precedence for what mood can be found/facilitated inside. After round number X of shots of Y, we swam through the crowd and took to the dancefloor.\n\nAs ever, the narrow room starts to warm up pretty quickly, especially when people are busting moves (dance and non-dance related) all over the place. It gets downright hot. And also \"hot\". I got grooved up on while one the dancefloor, I tried to delicately deflect it, but was thankfully saved by a friend when she saw me floundering.\n\nI can't, for the life of me, remember what the decor or ambience is like in detail. I do remember there being soundboxes/stages opposite the bar where half-nekkid people dance and gyrate against each other once the music/mood/libations get to flowing.

This is mainly because a good set of my friends smoke, and this bar has a smoking room. \n\nQ Bar is I think what would happen if you took Lime's aesthetics, Badland's lighting, music, and bar, and Mix's appeal to smokers. The overall result is quite successful. The bar is consistently well staffed, knowledgeable, skilled at crowd control, and with solidly poured drinks. They've never gotten a drink wrong, and always stay attentive and fast. Interestingly, they're also no-nonsense about even slight rabble-rousing. I've seen them on numerous occasions order a patron to leave. This is actually quite appreciated. \n\nThe music is typical top-40 dance fair, with the expected gay appeal. No surprises here. Still, their sound system is extremely well executed. \n\nYes, there are sometimes go-go dancers.\n\nThe smoking room is interesting in that unlike the inside of the bar, the smoking room is fully lit. No idea why, though it is quite helpful. The smoking room is also thickly doored, so the noise level from inside the bar rarely bleeds over. This makes it reasonably easy to carry on a conversation. The only minus is that the smoking room is terribly terribly ventilated, so you will come out of there smelling like the world's most eclectic ash tray.\n\nThere are really only 2 minuses. The prices feel about a dollar more than everywhere else. Also, the cover to get in tends to be a bit higher than you'd expect, especially on an event night.

It's still the size of my closet, but the new lighting effects, plasma screens behind the bars and what sounds like a new and updated sound system, give this place a completely NEW feel.\n\nI usually only frequent this place two nights a week. Wednesday nights for Booty Call and Friday nights because there's no cover all night. The drinks are always cheap and power packed, and I like their arry of specialty cocktails.

That was when I decided to take a break from the Q. \n\nYou have to have a plan of attack when you to go QBar on a Tuesday night... Seriously. Best protocol for the Q on a Tuesday night:\n\n1.) Hit coat check. There is NO room for your purse or bulky jacket on the dance floor, in the bathroom line, in the smoking area... ANYWHERE. And really, it's hot in there. Body heat people. You don't NEED that jacket. And really, if you are coming here on a Tuesday night... chances are you are a lesbian. Everyone knows lesbians don't need purses. Duh. Get a key chain and a cigarette case. Done.\n\n2.) Hit the bar. Find your favorite bartender, or anyone who is available really. Be aggressive, but not a dick. Order two drinks. Both doubles. Slam one, take the other out to the smoking area.\n\n3.) Hit the outside smoking area.  Omit obviously if not a smoker. Smoke a cigarette, sip on your drink, converse and survey. Take it all in. Yeah, soon you'll be on your way.\n\n4.) Get in the bathroom line. IMMEDIATELY. It's going to be long as  fuck and by time you finally get to the front, you'll need to pee. Trust me. You just drank two doubles.\n\n5.) Regroup your friends and DANCE YOUR ASS OFF.\n\n6.) At the end of the night, REMEMBER you checked your shit... drunk ass.\n\n7.) Drunk pizza next door.

There's a lot of grossness, especially in the form of very unattractive, horrible dancers (mostly girls) dancing on tables, platforms, what have you. I was getting dirty looks from really obese girls that thought I was stealing away their gay boyfriend, little did they realize that he was kind of the person who brought me there this evening. Also, the bartenders tend to be pretty rude once you become drunker and sweatier, and they will be much nicer to your gay boyfriend than they will be to you. That's just how it is.\n\nThe redeeming qualities of this bar include: friendly gays having a good time and being nice to you (if you're not a fat bitch), good dance music, the butt-ass naked man smoking a cigarette nonchalantly out front about 60% of the time, the proximity to Nizario's pizza and Hot Cookie.", "author": "Y K."}

It definitely has a club feel, but there's  an area where you can chill out, sit down, take a break, etc.  **SMOKERS** - they have a complete separate area for smokers, kind of like at Vertigo.  \n\nWhy it should get 1 star:\n$2 cover? What? Make it no cover or $5.  A $2 cover is just weird.  My main complaint about this bar? The rude DJ.  I go up to request a song as normal (David Guetta's Sexy Bitch), he doesn't see me, so I start waving my arms.  He ignores me while texting on his phone.  I finally yell, Hellllllo, and he annoying looks over at me and says \"what do you want?\"  I say I want to request a song.  He says no.  I say Why?  He says just because.  Fine, no need to be a dick about it.  He could've just answered me immediately and said something like \"sorry hun, we don't take requests.\"  That would've been fine.  No need to be an asshole.

First of all my wife and I were visiting friends in San Fran and they took us to QBar last Sat. The drink specials were great and the space is nice but that's about the only nice comment I will say. At first we had to clear a table of empty drinks so we can sit. Then we had to grab some bar stools since there wasn't enough space but not even 10 minutes later the bartenders asked for the stools so they can put them away to clear up the dance floor but we were no where near the dance floor. We thought that was weird and rude. Then we see a woman in a wheel chair being kicked out. One minute she is on the dance floor enjoying women dance around her and the next I see her being escorted out. After that incident I companied my wife to the bathroom and the door was closed like normal bathrooms are suppose to be. So we go in and my wife uses the bathroom and I'm behind the door putting on make up where the mirror is at and some guy who works there slams the door open hitting me in the back with the door. I asked why did he small the door and he said the door needs to be kept open with an aggressive annoyed attitude. I told him he didn't need to be so rude. So he left but then my wife comes out of the bathroom and closes the door to piss him off but it back fires and he approaches me to tell be if I close the door again that I will have to leave. I told him that I never shut the bathroom door the first time or the second time. He didn't care only warned me that I was going to be escorted out for shutting HIS BATHROOM DOOR! I asked for the manager and he said he was the security. He literally got in my face in a confrontational position to the point he made me so mad.. Im not one to so upset but the way he made me feel got the best of me. I was so mad/sad that this was happening to me. I ended up pulling my friends from the dance floor and asking if we could leave. I don't think I've ever been treated so rudely and with so much anger coming from an employee.

I then said, \"Really?\" and he said, \"Oh, you are so sexy.\" Him and I talked.. Then eventually his ex b/f came over and began talking with us.

It was awkward, but I didn't understand why he kept flirting with me.\n\nThe bar here is nice. It's definitely a GAY bar. You won't think the passable straight crowd of Moby Dick when you go here.

Supposedly people go to bars to meet people, but as far as I could see everyone was hanging out in the groups they came with--whatever to that, too.  I visited on a Thursday night and it wasn't that crowded, but from the other reviews it sounds like Saturdays get crazy busy.\n\nThe only thing that matters as far as I'm concerned is that I met my new favorite beer here--Longboard Lager.  WOW.  It just keeps going, and the flavor is perfectly balanced between sweet and bitter (in my opinion).  On top of how awesome it tastes, it was a great deal.  Q Bar also has a great Happy Hour going.  Go for Happy Hour, ride the Longboard, you'll love it.", "author": "Jin D."}

Drinks were reasonably priced.  The music was great; it was like top 40's pop dance stuff.  The variety of girls there was great.  As an out-of-towner, it was clear that most people come pretty regularly, but everyone was nice and willing to talk.  The coat check guy was very friendly!  There's not really a dress code; just come as you are.

It screams San Francisco and doesn't try and be LA or Vegas at any point. Locals, music lovers, and party goers know that.\n\nThere are a lot of straight people that party at Q-Bar. You have the gay sponsors to thank for that. Majority of the straights that visit the Castro know that Q-Bar and their goers are cool, hip, and they leave with a positive attitude.\nSeven nights a week, Q-Bar always has something different going on.

A friend of mine told me they've already been cited twice for overcapacity. It's actually not the funnest in the world to constantly be bumped into when you're trying to dance, especially when those people aren't dancing and are just trying to get across the room, but I digress.

I guess this review isn't about any of that or the staff. I don't know how often people have there things stolen from here, but since it was my first visit there.. it makes me think all the time? I was pretty much watching my bag the whole time too. I had put my bag on one of those tables that people were dancing on, and had friends' jackets on top of it.. and we were dancing right in front of it.. guarding it. But when we were leaving for the night.. right when I grabbed my bag, I noticed that the front zipper was open.. and my ipod was gone. So my one star review is for that. I'm just upset that I don't feel safe going back here anymore. The thief was really good! I was never more than 3 feet from my bag! And it was in a corner!\n\nHm, I guess since this is a Yelp review, I should say something about the actual place and not just the thief huh? \nGot it: Q Bar attracts good thieves.\n\nSo, whenever someone asks me about or references Q Bar, I'll respond with, \"oh yea, that's where I had something stolen from me for the first time ever.\" Or whenever someone asks me about my first Yelp review, I'll respond with, \"oh yea, Q Bar.

A dance company I was a part of had a short lived gig go-go dancing there (Imagine me dressed up like a little native boy shirtless in a loin cloth and a big feathered headdress).  After a long enough time I started to get friendly with some of the bartenders.  The Wednesday night Booty Call party ended up taking a place as my favorite night out.  If you haven't been, there's a weekly photo set done in the back room where you can get your picture taken.  The host, Juanita More, is one of my favorite people.  Ever.\n\nI went to the opening of Q bar last week.  Noticeable changes included the color switch from red to blue, the removal of the optical illusion mirror wall behind the bar that drove me nuts, the back seating gutted out, and those TERRIBLE tabled hung from poles that every drunk idiot tried to dance on (I'm still shocked that on one ever died).

Drinks in Frisco are sooooo much cheaper. Went on Tuesday (ladies night) it was ok. Female bartenders were quick and awesome. Then went back on Wednesday (boys night) and the male bar tenders were jerks. Waited FOREVER just to order. I ordered my usual, Ginger ale and belvedere, and he charged me $9. The night before I paid $7 for the same drink. My friend ordered the same exact drink from the same bartender and only got charged $7. I was discriminated against for being a female and he's probably pocketing that extra money. I've NEVER EVER had that happen to me. I will never go there again. Also they refused to sell my friend that doesnt drink, a Ginger beer. Their excuse was that they could only mix it with liquor. Ridiculous. They couldn't even pour some in a cup for him. I rather go to 440 where everyone was super nice and didn't over charge me for being the only female at the bar.", "author": "Liseth A."}

I went to the Q Bar on a recent Saturday night, which is when I used to always frequent the BOC, and almost nothing has changed inside.  Here is what did change:\n\n*No cover! :)  This is probably just a promotion for a few weeks though\n\n*Drinks were more a bit expensive, and smaller.  BOC was known for huge, strong drinks.  This reputation is not valid anymore with the Q Bar.  3 Vodka/Red Bulls was $27, and the glasses were smaller than usual, and not especially strong\n\n*No bench seating in the back... why would they get rid of this??\n\n*Q Bar banner on the front\n\n*Different bartenders.  For BOC, Saturdays used to always have extreeeemely attractive shirtless guys bartending, usually straight guys there for the tips.  Not a big deal for me, but definitely nice eye candy.  They were not present at Q Bar anymore.\n\n*One positive change:  better dance music!  They were playing really good funky house all night, and they removed all the furniture at about 10 PM and there was plenty of room to dance.  I really liked the dance vibe!\n\nAll in all, almost nothing changed inside.

Leave your shitty ass homophobia in a state pen, and go have some fun. I admit, I was a bit homophobic going at first, not really knowing what it really was to be inside one, the type of gay people I would meet, and when I would get groped. Surprisingly, and to my stereotypic relief, I didn't get groped, everyone there that night were super awesome, and the music... well, let's say I need to get back there with my friends again. I was there shooting for a friend who wanted to bring me as her photographer, and thinking I would be bothered and mobbed in a rowdy way for pictures, but it was quite calm. At bag check, I talked to Brittany a lot and she was such a wonderful spirit. I would go back to just say hi to her and watch her dance. What a lady! Beautiful too, if I may add. The drinks there are pretty damn stiff, and they only take cash so come ready. The place gets packed on a Saturday night, so expect crowdedness and a restroom line. My first experience at a gay bar was well-received, quite memorable, and I unexpectedly got hit on too. =)", "author": "Yao S."}

After buying a few rounds the bartender even bought ME a drink! awesome! The crowd was goodlooking and friendly and I loved the music. Parking was okay- there was a parking lot across the street.

On Tuesdays (Ladies Night) and Wednesdays (Booty Call) the line goes out the door down the street. But what happens when you get in? There's no place to go. It doesn't look as crowded the rest of the days, esp thurs through Sunday, so those are probably better. I've been on a Saturday and Sunday night before when someone I knew was a dancer there, and it was dead. This past Monday, Jason L was visiting SF, so we went out for dollar drinks. I am not a drinker, but he is. It was crowded in there. No line out the door, but nowhere to go once you got in. It took him forever to get drinks, and they tasted like juice. I know, because I tasted them, as did our friend. I had had zero alcohol the whole night, so any drink should have tasted alcohol-y, but this tasted juicey. I suppose that $1 is still a good deal for a cup of juice, but that's not what people are expecting, right? The music was..weird..but I was actually glad it wasn't the typical castro music. It wasn't pop or hip hop or house or rock or country, I don't know what it was. Not my kind of sound, but at least it's something different, because castro music is usually too bleh homogenous. The crowd was very young, college kids, maybe, and hipstery. We didn't stay long, my friends didn't feel like drinking all of their juice, the music was too loud to talk, and there was no place to stand. I think this is trying to be a club, which is fine b/c I love clubs, but they need more space to do so.", "author": "Merredith L."}

The staff is A+, always friendly (hello people if you don't want service people to be rude to you all you have to do is not be an idiot or a douche and things will work out fine).  I am a waiter, I know these things.  Just smile and be polite and not a sloppy mess and things will workout for you.  The great thing about the industry in SF is that we have the right to refuse service which is such a beautiful thing, otherwise we would be overrun by idiots.  So on with the review.  Drinks are good, I would go here if I wanted to get really drunk and not spend a ton of money, however tipping your bartender is good karma and they work very hard so I would plan on $40 per person if you wanna get smashed.  I'm a light weight by the way.  Badlands happy hour would be the other place to go for good drinks, but QBar is consistently strong and average price.  I can never say enough good things about the staff so I have that covered.  The bouncers have always been chosen extremely well, they recognize me and let me cut the line when it is all the way down the block so that is cool of them.  The crowd here is awful considering I used to party here with a bunch of gay boys my age who seem to have gone elsewhere.  I like lesbians don't get me wrong but for some reason girls are always trying to pick fights with me up in there and it really puts me off.  A girl about 4'11 got pissed when I didn't have an extra cigarette and I very politely said sorry and no and she proceeded to freak out at me and start calling me fag and put her hand at my neck all threateningly.  I was like wtf.  I hate fighting but for some reason girls in that place love to spill your drinks and then get pissed at you because it's on them and you are the man so it's your fault.  I guess I should just not come here on ladies night but unfortunately it's my only night off and unfortunately the Castro seems to be all of the sudden overrun by idiots with no manners.  So my message to people is if you're going to be a rude dumbass to a bartender or DJ or what not, don't expect them to bend over and give you a little kissy on your behind and bashfully flutter their eye lashes at you.  It is too bad that I don't feel like i'm going to a gay/lesbian bar anymore and it's in the heart of the castro.  I go for the bartenders and the music.  The people who crawl out of their rats nests for dollar well drinks on Monday (my other night off) are almost tolerable, although the friendly familiar faces are why I go to Q Bar, and how else are you going to pack out a bar on a Monday night during a recession?  Very smart in my opinion.  So go you hordes, to QBar and keep spending your money there because the staff rules and the drinks are fantastic and they know what kind of music you like.", "author": "Jonathan M."}

I had not been in this joint in over three years since it was called the Bar in Castro.  Against my better judgment I decided to give it a try and boy do I regret it. I ordered a round of drinks for my friends and I and when I was going to pay using my card, this rude bartender tells me in a very demeaning manner, \" we only take cash\". At that point one of my friends pulled out cash from his wallet and paid for the drinks. As the bartender turned around to get the change, I said to my friend, \"they don't have a sign indicating that they only take cash\". At this point the same bartender turned around, and in a very arrogant way said \"who comes to a bar without bringing cash with them\". So, I told him that \"it was my prerogative if I wanted to use my card, and that the establishment did not have a sign indicating that they only took cash, otherwise I would have pulled money out\". At this point he tells me that I needed to settle down or else....I am never going back there again. My experience was just like the name questionable. Note to bartender: Be nice to people, or get another job that does not require human interaction. After we left this hideous place, we went to another bar, that guess what...had a note indicating that they only took cash, and I was able to pull money out and avoid any confrontations. If you like rude service, than the Q (questionable service) is the right place to go,", "author": "Ulices P."}

I loved the old BOC, (except for all those cheesy parties they started toward the end, which are now at the BOCH, aka the transfer, aka bridge and tunnel coke house... cheesy). The Q bar has the SAME super hot staff, (none of them wanted to work at the cheesy new BOCH, or with the old owner that never paid them,)  and the remodel is coming along nicely. To all these folks saying \"it looks the same\", DUH. They just got new owners! They are remodeling but keeping it open so everyone can see the changes, which by the way are supposed to be done by the launch party at the end of march. The smoking patio already looks a million times better than it used to! Cheap drinks, no cover, great DJ's, and great location right in the heart of the Castro. Drinks aren't the only thing those hot bartenders make stiff... And I asked a few of them how they felt about the changes, and they were all exstatic, and kept saying how they loved the new owners and how the vibe in the Q bar is so much better than it used to be. I agree, and will keep going back for more.", "author": "cash m."}
