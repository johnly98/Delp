I had been there before when it was a karaoke bar and Chinese restaurant. I discovered they changed the name and management. We came in took the elevator up which was very small can fit maybe three people at a time. We was greeted and sat by the window. My god father order a lot of food as I ordered potstickers and soy sauce chow mein. We drank tea which I think was jasmine very tasty and filling. My order of Potstickers came and they were bigger than I'm use to I'm use to getting 6 small ones and I got 3 big ones. The soy sauce chow mein was different as I thought the noddles would be bigger like chow mein noddles and they where really small and sticky. We enjoy the food and the service. We was so full we couldn't finish our food but we took it home. \n\nLocation is in a strip mall with Safeway, Bank of America and Walgreens right in the Diamond Heights area.", "author": "Elizabeth G."}

You get a number from the hostess and watch the tv monitor to see how you're progressing in line, and your number will be called verbally when it's your turn.\n\nWait was not long for a Sunday AM For two - approx 15-20 min. Usually the wait isn't too horrendous on a non holiday weekend.\n\nAnother pro here- lots of parking. It shares a lot with other stores inside a plaza so parking is usually not a challenge unlike other dim sum places. \n\nFood-it still comes out on the carts but you can also place your order via marking the menu. Once you mark it up, hand it to any server and they'll print out a list of items you ordered. Each waitress who walks by with food will check your slip and place your ordered items on the table. We tried many items and my favorites were the beef tendon and chicken feet. Dim sum tastes vary so much but what I can say is that the food is fresh, isn't overly seasoned and comes out hot! None of the dishes we dined on were off-point.\n\nWhat's the most amazing here is the service... for a Chinese place (heh) it's got amazing service:\n\n- they clean your table promptly\n- they will clean your table before they allow you to pay or pack up your leftovers\n- they will pack your leftovers for you\n- they are nice\n- they have manners and will smile and ask you things politely\n- the managers have an intercom system to speak to the kitchen to communicate orders \n- tea was refilled promptly (leave the tea kettle open so they know its empty!)\n\nOnly downside is that it is a tad pricier than other joints but i am Definitely coming back!", "author": "Karen H."}

You'll find lots of parking too as they're located next to a Safeway with a huge lot. Its also very authentic cuz the majority of the patrons are large Chinese families, so you know if the grandma's come here, then it's authentic!\n\nAs for the food, they've had a lot of health code violations, including a Yelp popup referencing it, but to me, I've never had any issues and have never seen anything alarming, but who knows what goes on in the back of house... I'll gladly stay blissfully ignorant in this case. But they have great salty egg yolk custard buns, salt and pepper fish, shu mais and dumplings and noodles and...

There's a little bit of a language miscommunication it's little hard to communicate and I noticed when they're talking to their own culture they seem a little bit more friendlier and more generous with their portions, if you're not Asian good luck trying to get what you want that's why they only get it 2- Star.

Food last time was pretty good. This time we ordered similar dishes and it fell a little flat. \n\nPluses: The prices are fair, definitely not on the cheap side though. Parking is free and easy, there's an open lot. \n\nNegatives: Waiting time can be up to an hour during weekend around noon or holidays though. If you're not to familiar w the place I would recommend you call ahead to check the wait!\n\nOrdered the \"sea cucumber w chicken rice noodle,\" which looked great coming out. Chicken tasted flavorful and tender. The noodles only had flavor on the outer layer and there wasn't much sauce. There wasn't much sea cucumber either. Overall 3/5, not worth $25 \n\nAlso had the typical \"fung zhao\" which is Cantonese for the marinated chicken feet dish. Not bad, pretty flavorful and tender. The beef ball today was not so good. Tasted bland and kinda old. Egg tarts were yummy. The \"xiao long bao\" which is like a soup dumpling typically eaten w red vinegar, was ok. Not much soup inside. I was looking forward to the \"pancake roll w beef shank\" a lot because the last time I tried it I told myself I'm definitely going to order this again. It's like a Chinese pancake with beef and some cucumbers and veggies in it, dipped in sweet hoisin sauce (the dish has a Vietnamese style to it in my opinion). This time around, the portion was smaller, there was less meat in it, so it wasn't as satisfying. \n\nOverall the food we ate today wasn't really up to par. It was either ok or not that great. I'll still come back because it's convenient and they do have some good stuff. I always love their fried taro balls for example.\n\nUsually I'd probably say they get a 4/5 on a good day and 3/5 on a bad day. Today was a bad day.", "author": "Connie L."}

I don't know when the transition took place but you should keep this in mind when reading older reviews. \n\nThe menu is vast with almost too many choices causing confused ordering, something I'll correct on a future visit. Eg I ordered steamed tripe when I wanted spicy tripe as shown in my previous review photo. There are multiple siu mais; we ended up with a shrimp and pork one that happened to be delicious. Other items we liked a lot were \"pan fried black glutinous rice w/chicken\" and \"steamed dumpling w/bean curd paste and pork\". Of note, the good chili paste is made in house and they're quite proud of it.\n\nHarbor Villa is very popular in the area; the dining room was full at 1:30 pm on the first sunny weekday in weeks when we should all have been outside. 100% Asian clientele, except for me, which I take as a good sign.\n\nNote: the takeout window downstairs has a completely different menu: some dim sum items and the usual Chinese American steam table selections.

As a pescetarian, it's hard to find a dim sum spot that serves anything beyond the typical haw gao and shrimp cheung fun dishes. But not at Harbor Villa...they've got a ton of seafood options, and then some!\n\nListen, I've heard of their health code violations that shut them down a few yrs back...but personally, I haven't seen anything alarming myself. So I'm not crazy alarmed by this. But I do understand there are things that happen in the back kitchen that we may not see. \n\nMoving on, parking is a plenty here. They've got a TON more seating than most dim sum spots in the city. You get a number when you arrive and get thrown into a bucket based on the size of your party. There's a TV in the front telling you which number they're seating for each of those buckets, and a woman up in front calling out the numbers in both English and Chinese. It cracked me up today bc the numbers she was calling out in Chinese and English today didn't match up (she was saying 842 in Chinese and then 942 in English), so everyone looked confused af. Not gonna lie, I didn't care too much bc my party size was smaller so we were in the 100s bucket. When we arrived, there were 11 tables ahead of us, but 8 of them either left or weren't paying attn so we got seated within 20mins or less. It was great. \n\nPro tip: there's a homemade hot sauce that you can ask for here. It's amazing. Love a good homemade hot sauce. It goes w everything! My fav dishes to order are the haw gow (shrimp dumpling. It has great skin wrapping that doesn't fall apart), salty egg yolk bun (like the custard bun, but salty sweet), salt and pepper fish (perfectly crispy and seasoned), and durian pasty (be warned: it's pretty pungent. Gotta love durian for this one). \n\nNow staffing. Typical Chinese service. They ignore you unless you yell the loudest. Not my fav thing to do, but my tricks I've figured out is who to wave down for what I want. For hot sauce and water, get the bus boys attn bc they'll make it happen fastest (they're in all black). To place the order for dim sum, wave down the head waiters bc they can enter it into the system while bus boys can't (they're in all black + vest). To pay, get the managers attn bc it'll need to go thru them in the end anyways (they're in button up shirts w ties). Happy dim summon!", "author": "Jennifer L."}

Word to the wise, don't come here on a holiday like Thanksgiving. My parents and I waited over 1.5 hours for a table. To order, you mark off what dishes you want on a menu and hand it to your waiter. There are no carts being pushed around. The menu includes pictures and descriptions in Chinese and English. There is a great selection of dim sum choices and food is tasty. It is on the pricier side though.\n\nFor dinner: I have found that for large parties, while ordering from the set menu is more convenient, it is more cost efficient to order items from the menu. I have had a few waiters who have tried to strongly convince us to order a \"special\" or two, which can be very annoying. If you order too much food for the table, the waiters will move your entrees onto smaller dishes to make room for the other dishes. My favorite dish is the one with crab and deep fried salted pumpkin squash. A bowl of red bean soup is served as dessert. \n\nAll in all, it's a decent restaurant. Because it is a busy restaurant, it can be hard to flag down a member of the wait staff.", "author": "Katie C."}

As a technology executive in an interracial marriage, I frequent Chinese, Dim Sum and other Asian-Pacific restaurants frequently. This restaurant was also shut down 7 times for health/safety violations, so they changed their name to get a blank slate: https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Loophole-Allws-SF-Restaurants-to-Hide-Health-and-Safety-Violations-Including-Cockroach-Infestations-379682951.html  \n\nFirst after entering and seeing many open tables the host didn't seem interested in seating me.

About 10 minutes went buy and no one approached our table to take our order, ask if we wanted water or anything.

So, I waited patiently trying to flag down a waiter for another 5 minutes or so (had been sitting for about 15+ minutes now) with no service whatsoever.\n\nFinally, I started to wonder what was going on. My children were now complaining that they were thirsty and hungry and still no one would serve us. Then my wife joined us. My wife is Chinese-American and I am a Caucasian male.

She did not even know how to do service recovery and apologize. Come on, own it! Even if you made a mistake,  you could have apologized, correct what you did. How can you be a sample to your staff? Forget it, some of the staff/manager are rude, too. The male boss just stood there and watched, did nothing about it. How embarrassing this is for your restaurant? Also, this Asian guy and his two friends should be ashamed of theur behaviors, almost like illiterate. You do not know how to line up and do NOT HAVE ANY MANNER! The poor hostess and some of the staff were probably afraid to confront the boss. Other eaters watched what happened, too. People see what you do and say.  You can never win people over if this is who you are, not your staff, not your customers,  not your family and friends. Watch out for karma.\n\nOther than the low health/safety score you saw on this restaurant, if you can lie about seating/reservation, what else can you lie about? \n\nThis restaurant has been changing the registered owners and registered names (All Season to Harbor Villa) to hide its history of being forced to closed 7 times due to poor food sanitation/safety. But they are the same group of people running the restaurant. It was on the news:\n\nhttps://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Loophole-Allws-SF-Restaurants-to-Hide-Health-and-Safety-Violations-Including-Cockroach-Infestations-379682951.html\n\nThis is already not acceptable for restaurant staff helping certain customers to cut line. This is embarrassing when you don't admit/apologize when you were straight up lying and being unfair.\n\nThis is why certain dim sum restaurants always have long wait time because of these corrupted behaviors (esp the ones with big names in SF and Daly City).  Lacking basic etiquettes makes you NEVER EVER be ranked or compared to nicer restaurants.", "author": "Elm E."}

Parking and seating is ample, and the decor is typical of a large chinese dim sum/family style plates restaurant.  Their window views of Diamond Heights is nice, especially when the fog rolls in and touches the houses on the hillside.  The food was good and consistent in the past, but recently has been hit and miss.  Their standard dishes typical of chinese restaurants still meet its mark, but new dishes have been disappointing.  We saw pineapple sauteed beef cubes and was like okay let's give this a try.  Came out where pineapple chunks from a can was more than the beef cubes.  Wasn't pit together well at all like the chef just slammed canned pineapple and beef together.  You know you can tell with the taste and look if the chef really put thought and heart into what was cooked or not.  Definitely don't get this dish.  The nice $10.95 quail deal use to be good, as there wasn't a limit of how much we can order.  But recently, even though the ad never stated this, the waiter said we could only order 1 per table, and then any additional ones will be $14.95.  We were like what is this some rule you just make up based on what we order?!  We bet if you ordered expensive food they will let you order as much of the quail you want at the special price.  Although convenient to go to with the parents when we go visit them, and they have good spacing as we have a baby daughter with all her baby gear so would have given them 4 stars just because of sentimental bias, it goes down to 2 stars due to recent food and service quality.

If you are uncertain about the yelp rating on here, don't bother listening to it because the true test of a Chinese restaurant is not the yelp score, it's the amount of Chinese people waiting for a table and every weekend, this place is packed. So packed that the parking lot is filled up in no time.\n\nI can't believe people are still complaining about service at a CHINESE place. Sure there are some standards but let's be realistic, Chinese places have terrible service, at least from a western perspective. From a Chinese perspective, it's spot on.

The price of the food you order here is not worth what you pay for, the food was very bland and expensive. The shredded beef pan fried noodles had some mystery meat and did not taste like beef, it was possibly the leftover ground meat they had.

Honestly, not every dim sum tastes great but they have certain unique ones that other restaurants don't have! It really depends on what you order! \n\nI would recommend trying the following for LUNCH:\n\nDim sum: \n-Steam dumpling with bean curd paste and pork (my parents love this but it's ok for me, it's like a Zhong Shan speciality I suppose) \n-Taro roll with minced pork and shrimp\n-abalone chicken feet\n-spicy chicken\n-lower duck bill with basil\n-pumpkin in salted egg yolk\n\nNoodle: \n-abalone and beef stew noodle (only $14!!, can get oily sometimes)\n-Fish chow fun \n-pan fried vermicelli with lobster/meat/whatever\n\nPorridge: \n-Fish porridge (order a live fish and have porridge and meat for chow fun!), \n-Crab porridge (whole crab, YES, I love the freshness of the crab in the porridge) \n\nDessert: \n-sponge cake (it's soft and fluffy here!!)\n-cashew nut puffs (one of my favs!)\n-sweet coconut rolls\n-taro paste sweet bun\n-sticky rice flour dumpling (comes with 2 salty ones and 2 sweet peanut ones)\n-Po tat\n\nAS FOR DINNER: \n\nI'm always a seafood (or SEEfood, HA) diet person so love their:\n-Salt and pepper crab\n-Ginger and scallion lobster\n-Live shrimp: boiled body with salt n pepper head \n-squabs (can't go wrong)\n\nAs for service, we come here really often so their service has been pretty good for us- constantly changing of plates, refilling tea, brings us napkins etc. quickly, and the waiters (even dim sum ladies are nice!) spark up a convo or so every time!", "author": "Eva C."}

It's been a year since the first time I came here and it's hard to get a seat here for dim sum in the morning. Memorial Day is where all the families gather together to eat in the morning.

The area here isn't too big, it holds an average amount of people here. It's very noisy in here because this restaurant gets super packed. I love how they have both the menu where you choose what you want and the cart style where food is being pushed around without needing to wait. Of course ordering the food off the menu will get you exactly what you want. They have a lot of different dim sums here including the sweet side of the desserts.

For the most part, it's pretty authentic Cantonese cooking, at least for dinner. I haven't had any of their dim sum, so I can't comment on that. Service is pretty good for a Chinese restaurant, but that's probably because of the area and how many white people are in the area. Honestly, the view is great, and I like the ambiance (nice for a Chinese restaurant in that not everything is sticky and dirty), but the portion sizes are small, and prices are steep for Chinese food (with each plate costing around $10-$15). I think if they downgraded their size, they could be much more efficient. Doesn't look like they ever fill out.\n\nWhat's good? Interesting dish of wasabi pig's stomach and boiled chicken (it's served cold). Not really Cantonese, but flavorful. Pea shoots are good as always, and I liked the sauteed, albeit raw, whole garlic cloves. Everyone and their brothers have a picture of the cubed beef, and it's rightfully so. That is their best dish. The beef and veggies are sauteed perfectly, and the beef is ridiculously tender. E-mein is great as well and has crab meat instead of the usual lobster. Still made very well. Braised tofu and bok choy? Standard quality stuff. Not too gloopy or salty either. What really helps out with these dishes is that they're not made with heavy hands. There's a little MSG, but for the most part, it's cleaner than most Chinese restaurants in their flavoring. Good place to try out, but it's a little out of the way and pricey to return on cue.", "author": "Danny C."}

LIES. ALL LIES. Take me for example. Even though I religiously carried my Algebra for Dummies book as my bible in college, I couldn't tell you today WTF a quadratic equation is much less divide a bill for dinner. :X\n\nOn 12.28.11, my friends and I came to All Season for our annual holiday dinner purely out of convenience; they have a parking lot.\n\nAll Season has a lot of unique things on the menu that you can't find in other Chinese restaurants like Monk Fish Liver, Unagi Egg Roll, Fish Bladder with Sea Cucumbers, Braised Fish Head Stew and Rose Flavored Soy Sauce Chicken just to name a few.\n\nF O O D\n*WESTLAKE BEEF SOUP ($10): 3 STARS \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lMCEPzboR8E1Rw-v2ZjCSA?select=Xre-RQTpBdL-C-qvGO7CeA\nSmooth and comforting, the soup had silky threads of egg whites and tender bits of beef.

The skin was removed from the duck and served separately from the duck meat. The tiny baos weren't deep enough to fit the duck skin so it had to be folded into it. This did allow you to taste more crispy fatty mouth-watering layers.

The sight of people grabbing the menu not looking for food but to use it as a fan is almost amusing, except when I'm one of people. \n\nThe wait is also god awful. They told me it was a half an hour wait. LIES!!!! It was easily over an hour.  More than double! This is not an acceptable margin of error.\n\nDishes were not as clean as other reviews indicate. At least on my plate I could see traces of what the previous user had for lunch.\n\nFood was OK. Nothing spectacular compared to other dim sum places.  Given their desire to save air conditioning money, I can't possibly see how they would spend on fresh ingredients.\n\nTo cap it off, the receptionist was rude beyond believe, especially when confronted by other dissatisfied customers about the unreasonable wait.\n\nIn conclusion, this is one of the worst dim sum places.  We should have higher standards than this place can offer.  This place deserves to cease to exist.  They don't deserve my money and I'm definitely boycotting this place.", "author": "W S."}

Free easy parking itself is already big value for dining in San Francisco with expensive parking lots and parking tickets.

Surprisingly, there are not many dim sum restaurants that keep you coming back. Well, after trying this place, I hate to say it, but the search continues.  \n\nAll Seasons is not bad, but as many reviewers have already said, it's not spectacular. The dim sum is good. The standouts for me were the Woo Kawk (taro puff) and the Black Sesame Rolls, which you rarely find at dim sum restaurants. The Woo Kawk was crispy with a good filling that wasn't overly salted like most places. The Black Sesame Rolls tasted like black sesame and reminded of the ones I had when I had as a child at Hong Kong Tea House, a notable dim sum in Chinatown that was recognize by the locals as one of the best during its existence in the 70s and early 80s. \n\nAll Season also non-traditional, non-Cantonese dim sum dishes such as their Sticky Rice Flour Dumplings wrapped in bamboo leaves, which was probably by snacks found the Zhongshan province of China. The dish came with 4 pieces, 2 with a savory filling and the other 2 with a sweet filling. It's the first time I've tried them and they weren't bad. \n\nAs for the other dim sum dishes I tried, which included Har Gow (shrimp dumpling), Beef Balls, Sticky Rice Wrapped in Lotus Leaf, etc., they were okay.\n\nOne thing to note, All Seasons offer a wide variety of dim sum that are paraded around the aisles on carts. However, not all the dim sum offered are found on the carts so if you don't want to wait around for the one you want, just order it off the menu.\n\nWhen it comes to price, All Season is comparable to Zen Peninsula and The Kitchen in Millbrae. It's not the most economical dim sum restaurant, especially since they don't offer that many options in the \"small\" to \"medium\" categories, but it's also not as expensive.", "author": "Albert L."}

However, I seriously care about the way I am greeted and treated upon entering. This part greatly reflects my dining experience. First, some of the wait staff are friendly and attentive when they are needed. Also, the one thing they do here is very interesting and that is the menu to customers as they walk them to their assigned table.\n\nI look over the menu items carefully, mark a number for the desired item and a wait staff comes and bring it to the kitchen. There are times when we were able to be seated upon entering the restaurant so I liked that. The wait staff should be extra alert to when they are needed.\n\nHere are some of the reasons for my rating:\n1) Sometimes this place can be very crowded (Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Year's Day)\n2) Sometimes it takes them about 10 minutes or longer to bring customers their orders\n3) I agree with Erica L's point in consideration of hiring additional staff members to speed up service (service efficiency and accuracy)\n4) Maybe it is because I don't always go out to for dim sum on a daily basis\n\nUPDATE FOR 6/20/2012:\nDim sum items are typically around $2-$5 each, quality of the food here is enjoyable. I did like my meal here, the items look fresh and delicious.\nHere are some of the items I ordered:\n- Shrimp Rice Roll\n- Shrimp Dumpling\n- Pork Dumpling w/ Mushroom\n- Egg Yolk Custard Bun\n\nThe dim sum items may be a little pricier in comparison, the taste is better than the items you get at Chinatown dim sum restaurants.

It is only after a few listens that you come to realise the show is paid advertising, and what is actually sub-parness or extreme mediocrity is elevated to embellished deliciousness of the highest order of bull feces, thus making the discerning real foodie (aka the listener) wonder how these motormouths can be taken $eriou$ly.\n\nAll fears were put aside once we got up there, it's quite swank. And the place quickly filled up on Sunday night. For a Cantonese seafood restaurant in Diamond Heights area, it's very impressive, way more so than Yet Wah who had been doing the American Chinese thing for years. The next nearest half decent Cantonese might not be till you get to the Sunset, or perhaps Ocean Avenue area.\n\nNoted live (or partly comatose) seafood in the tanks: geoduck ~ $26/lb (I guess that's cheap given that geoduck population is shrinking faster than George Costanza and prices are skyrocketing even at the soooshee barz that come near $35 / lb), crab, lobster, live abalone (probably farmed), humongous sturgeon that just barely fit the length of the tank, some humongous red fish of a similar size (sadly floating on its side, a sign that the gills or floaters are in a bad state), coral/sesame grouper (good for steaming) that looked very sleepy but who can blame them for being packed densely inside. Not bad for a showcase.\n\nA glance at the menu....hmmm very close to Crab Island in Daly City. Scattered regional Chinese type dishes....some Hunan, a few Sichuan, some Cantonese (familiar) and some.....Zhongshan regional Cantonese? What's this bucket chicken (not KFC version) that's poached and served in a wooden bucket and garnished with cilantro? Interesting...but not $10 more interesting, yet quite a few tables are getting this. The Chinese characters on the menu are traditional, not shorthand. Just overly mindboggling.\n\nThe slow fire stewed soup of the day? Sea coconut with chicken....uhm no thanks. How can a Canto restaurant have hot and sour soup too?\n\nSo here it goes\n\nEmpress chicken - poached chicken that was cold (ie pre-made well in advance). The nice thing is that the broth or essence the chicken was poached in, turned into gelatin that penetrated the area beneath the skin and meat, creating a fairly good delicious experience. The chicken used was the \"wong mo gai\" (yellow fur chicken, aka range chicken, lots of bones, little meat but lots of flavor). The downside? The ginger scallion oil was overly salted, and whatever remained on the plate was a layer of grease. No wonder it tasted ok. The meat was a bit too chewy for my liking and the marination/spice rub was not complex enough.\n\nChoy sum in superior broth with a meatball made of fish + tofu - not bad...good quality green veg stems, and the fish + tofu balls reminded me of the stewed vegetables (nimono white board special) with fried stuff tofu at Gombei in Menlo Park and San Jose.\n\nblack pepper beef filet with taro fries - best dish of the night. Taro fries (stir fried, not battered) was a great pairing with good quality thick julienne beef, with some bell peppers. Good with rice.\n\nComp'd dessert - red bean soup. Watery, sweet, and not enough dried orange peel flavor. Silver House (San Mateo) nails it down the best with a thicker consistency and dried orange peel (and quality red beans).\n\nA good 3.5 stars kind of place, authentic enough for Diamond Heights area and fairly impressive. Potentially better than Crab Island.", "author": "Ken K."}

Delicious jellyfish, duck (peking too), asparagus chicken (crunchy veggies and savory black bean sauce that's not too salty!), and steamed crab over sticky rice.  \n\nWalnut soup (dessert) = delicious!!!  I'm allergic to peanuts (as of 2011), so this was a wonderful alternative!!  (If you want it, make sure to request it well ahead of time, because it's a lengthy process to make this dessert.  They actually peel whole walnuts, then they roast them, and then they handcrank grind them for this soup.)\n\nService = friendly.  We had the \"VIP\" room, the private section, so we had different experience than if we had been in the main dining area.  The \"VIP\" room is a bit drafty, and probably would see up to 40 people at most (and it'd be a tight squeeze).\n\nLocation = where Yet Wah #2 used to be.  They've updated the place quite a bit.

A table to our left got there way before we did, but by the time our third dish came out, all they had was their white rice.  Funny though cuz my table had to ask the server at least 6 times (no joke!) for our rice before someone finally brought it to our table.  Definitely, not enough kitchen staff or servers to support the amount of customers.\n\nSuch a shame too since I actually don't mind their food.

Larger groups get B, C, D tickets.\nWait time on a Sunday at 12 noon was fairly quick, only 15 minutes. My super Chinese mom attributes this to All Season being on the pricier side and the poor economy, so less people. Still, there was a good number of people waiting. \n\nService is a total miss. I don't know how many times we asked for water, water refills, hot sauce, soy sauce, and napkins. At one point my friend gave up and just grabbed napkins for us. Typical Chinese restaurant I guess.\n\nThe food itself, not bad. I can't even remember exactly how many dishes we had but we ordered way too much (woops.. That's what happens when dining with foodies)\n\nThis restaurant has goose liver fried rice on their dinner menu. We tried to order it during dim sum hours but we were told they did not have goose liver that day. The waiter recommend to us the dry scalloped and egg white fried rice instead. It was actually pretty good but needed a little bit of white pepper. \n\nMy winning dish of the meal was the shark fin soup dumpling. \nBe sure you order this in advance because it takes a REALLY REALLY long time to come. The broth was PERFECT. Minced yellow chives in a light delicate ginseng.. oh man. Hit the spot. Probably one of the better shark fin soup dumplings I have had at dim sum in a really long time. Ample amount of seafood in the dumpling as well. \n\nI also really enjoyed the stewed tripe (but I felt it was a bite overcooked, I like mine with a slight bite) but the flavor was definitely there. Had my usual chicken feet in black bean sauce but we also ordered the chicken feet in abalone sauce. Really liked the abalone sauce but I was too full to keep eating!\nDurian puffs are huge here with a helping spoonful of durian paste on the inside.

That's just a sign that it's a good Chinese restaurant. =)\n\nPerhaps the best indication that All Season serves excellent - not just good - dim sum and Chinese food (dinner items) is that it's packed during peak hours. In fact it was crowded with a wait time of 30 minutes for a party of 4 only two weeks after it reopened. The traditional dim sum items are up to par but I judge dim sum places on the \"special\" items they serve that aren't always available in other restaurants. Some of my staples at this place are the pancake with curry sauce and salted egg pumpkin. \n\nI won't lie. The service at this place isn't spectacular. At high times you are expected to just go in to eat and leave quickly. The waiters get overwhelmed and so forget your requests so you'll need to gently remind them. I've experienced the same at other Chinese restaurants. I've found that things go better if I go in with with low expectations for service. \n\nPerhaps the draw for this place, other than the food, is the ample parking available.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-10", "description": "I am speculating that the only reason this place got a health rating of 65 out of 100 is because maybe the inspector was not bribed enough, because even their restrooms were very clean in sharp contrast to other Chinese restaurants which are literally filthy and still get higher health ratings.  This restaurant was renovated after it took over from the previous proprietors not that long ago, which makes it cleaner than those others foreign to the concept of all purpose sanitizing spray cleaners.  \n\nI have to defend this restaurant from the unfair health ratings.  The food is fresh and above average in taste.  However, as so many other Chinese restaurants are forced to compromise authenticity to stay in business, it has to stick Americanized Chinese renditions on its menu. Most gastronomical unsophisticated and culturally limited diners judge Chinese food if it tastes safe, not truly exotic.  These must be the type of diners rating All Season low. I bet when these unhappy diners travel overseas, their dining destinations are more mainstream safe.  These are the hamburger, meatloaf and fried chicken crowd who thought soy sauce was venturing into the unknown.  I would give it another star later if it can find away to infuse its menu with greater authenticity of its Chinese cuisine; and toss in a few dishes to coddle the redneck Americanized palate.\n\nI am suspicious of those whose entire critique focuses solely on dim sum without trying other main entrees on the menu.  One of the critiques commented that she liked the dim sum because the choices were not \"out there\", meaning she enjoys Chinese food as long as it appeals to her blander palate.

It's Mother's Day and Happy Mother's Day to all you moms and soon-to-be moms.\n\nMy brothers wanted to take mom and pop out to dim sum. They live in San Mateo County and we're in Alameda County. And I had to be at work in Livermore at 1pm. So, we chose the All Season because their website says they open at 9:30 am. The website also says that they take reservations but when my brother called, they said not for Mother's Day. I suggested that we all arrive by 9:15 to ensure we would get into first seating. Fortunately, they arrived by 9, when the restaurant opened. STRIKE ONE!\n\nWe were seated near the front door which kept getting propped open in spite of the cold wind that entered the restaurant. It wasn't the staff holding the door open but the guests that arrived later and had to wait for a table. My brother kept getting up to close the door so the wind wouldn't blow on our 87-year old father. The staff did nothing to help remedy this situation. STRIKE TWO!\n\nThe food was coming out very slow at the beginning so we decided to mark a sheet to order some menu items. When the waiter came to collect the sheet, he pointed out that two of the dishes were not available because \"the kitchen doesn't open until 10am\"! STRIKE THREE!\n\nWe took a ton of food from the steam carts, trays that were being carried, and then, after 10am, re-ordered one of the original dishes that we wanted.

Why spend 20 minutes searching for street parking in Chinatown or on Clement street, when there is a free parking lot just outside the restaurant. Lots of people seem to be thinking the same exact thing. Once you're inside and upstairs, it's noisy, crowded, with warm aromas filling the large, light filled restaurant, just as it should be. \n\nMost importantly, they have all my Hong Kong classic dim sum favorites served in carts like: \nLo mai gai- steamed sticky rice with chicken in lotus leaf wrap (not too salty and less fatty than most other places)\nSteamed cha siu bao (not too salty and less fatty than most other places)\nCha siu so- bbq pork in puffed pastry\nHar gow- shrimp dumpling\nPan fried tarrow cake with chinese ham\nBraised whole chicken feet - (not my personal favorite but a very popular dish among HKers)\nFried noodles in XO sauce (order off the menu)\nExtensive selection of Chinese teas for the table to enjoy\n\n*The one item I avoid from here is the xiao long bao, in my opinion it's not even worth ordering, the skin gets stuck to the aluminum tin foil they use as a wrapper and there is hardly ever any soup inside of the dumpling, rendering it rather dry and pointless.\n\nOverall, the prices are super reasonable given the overall quality of the food here. Expect to pay a lot less for dim sum of similar quality to Yank Sing. Now it's easy to understand why this place is becoming so popular.\n\nTips: Try to get here early, the free parking lot gets pretty crowded by noon, especially on weekends. When it gets crowded it's also kind of a tradeoff between sitting by the windows or sitting closer to the kitchen and getting first dibs on the carts as they come filing out with steaming hot new dim sum. Sometimes if you are waiting on a particular dish, it helps to alert one of the other cart ladies or manager about it so they can mention it to the proper person and get you what you want. Lastly, if you are coming by yourself and just want to park, grab, and go they have a great take out dim sum counter on the ground floor level just under the restaurant. \n\nNote: I have not eaten here for dinner and would recommend this place for brunch or lunch only.", "author": "Mark Y."}

Do note that I find that the quality of their food isn't as consistent if  you come here right when they open - I suspect they use prepped stuff from the day before since they open so early.\nWhen this place gets busy, it can be a hassle to get a number and wait with the crowd due to a small waiting area. Try and have your party together (especially for large tables) as they may not seat you until everyone is physically near the restaurant.\nI don't feel too pressured into ordering as they walk around - you can also order off a menu which includes a lot of their specials which I recommend you to take a look at.", "author": "Jason B."}

What I can't ignore was that the food was absolutely disgusting and the preparation and service utterly filthy. It's pretty clear that the management of this place simply doesn't care to provide good service, see that food is of decent quality, and that it is prepared to an acceptable standard and served under clean conditions -- there's an endless line of people who will pay to eat the garbage they put out, so no need to change.", "author": "david p."}

For a table of 7 people, the bill came to about $156 or so. Not too shabby.\n\n- The short ribs were a bit on the sweeter side; it was different but still tasty. What I loved about it was that it fell off the bone as I bit into it.\n- We ordered the green onion pancake (yes, I'm an ABC and I love these side dishes). It was probably the best green onion pancake I've ever had.\n- We got the duck steamed bun dish. It came without the meat and we thought - OK maybe that's how it is? When we were finished with all are dishes, the duck meat came out. WTH? -1 point. \n- We thought our vegetable dishes had a bit too much oil in it.\n- Soup was amazing.

The plate can best be described as greasy but flavorless- what a disappointment.  And to top it off, no fortune cookie either!

Using common sense I decide to ask if there's a wait for jsut 2 before immediately leaving. I stand directly in front of a staff member and she looks through me, ignoring me for a good full minute. Finally i ask her if there's a wait for 2, she still ignores. I get more in her face and yell \"IS THERE A WAIT FOR 2?!\" She points to a DMV-style tv screen that has letters and numbers on it- exactly the screen at the dmv but more jazzed up with a background on the picture. I look at it blankly and she says \"get a number\" so I repeat \"IS. THERE. A. WAIT. FOR. 2.\" How the heck do I know how their retarded system works? How often are numbers being called? Are there any tables for 2 already waiting? What is the average wait time for a table for 2? WTF!!! So then she says \"half an hour\" so I b-line to the door. Couldn't get out of here fast enough. They put me in a bad mood for probably the rest of the day. Horrible service, idiotic LAZY seating system. This place is never busy, Yet Wah went out of business prob because of the awkward location- I'm sure this place will be gone soon. Hopefully the new place will spend their money on paying competant staff instead of a tv to display numbers to tell guests when their table is ready.\n\n*Take-out window was almost as bad, the lady working there was pushy and tried to tell us what we wanted instead of chow mein since they were out.

If it was up to him, we probably would not have been served.  And he missed one of the things we had on the menu.  \n\nTo the food itself:\n\nMost of the items were only okay.  One standout was the cilantro and shrimp dumpling - it did have some amazing flavor.  It's hard to believe, but the deep fried lobster dumpling was flavorless - yes, lobster!

It was a weekday, early afternoon...\nNot packed at all, so we grabbed window seats, and were served as a party of 3, because she brought her baby along. I guess, a seat is a seat, so it's okay for them to charge us for it. Oh wait, they didn't even offer a high chair...I had to grab it after 15 mins. of being ignored...Hmm. And they didn't offer us the candle to keep our tea warm, despite the other three tables in the room having one. (Yes, I counted how \"full\" this place was). At this point, I did make a crack that being with a white girl wasn't helping me get the extra service I often see at Chinese restaurants.\n\nLuckily, my friend's not picky at all, and it was the convenience of parking, that I suggested we go for dim sum here. I'm only deducting just one star, to be fair... Food is just ok, I warned her not to bother with the xiaolongbao dumplings, cuz she got excited seeing those on the menu. Thankfully, she listened.\n\nWe got the cilantro rice roll (because I can't find too many places that make it, so I just HAVE to have it). The scallop rice roll - never again, \"where's the scallop?\" Shrimp siu mai, of course, can't go wrong. I've noticed theirs is bigger than the avg. maybe that's why it's pricier.\n\nOverall, we had a decent time, between juggling the baby and keeping things in his mouth. He seem to enjoy the attention by tea-goers! But we were totally ignored by staff. No tea refill, and service was slow...is one way to put it. I usually don't mind this too much, but even when I'm trying to pay? I finally managed to flag down a manager in the sea of empty tables, but he forgot to bring me my check. Funny thing, he came back at one point, and realized this...but I wasn't going to wait another 10 mins. So we walked up, and I paid, after hovering for a bit.

Around 1045, the place was full and a short line was forming. I really like this place because it is clean and they have zhong shan style dimsum. Everything I got was pretty good. Ordering food at this restaurant is really confusing. They have menus where you mark off what you want,give this to the hostess, and the server will bring it to you. The hostess will put a printed list on receipt paper of your marked items on your table. But they also have dim sum carts going around that have the same items as on the menu, they will put the dish on your table if they see you marked it on the menu receipt. If you want something else from the dim sum cart, they have a completely different stamp card on your table. More or less marking off the items on the menu is useless because half the items come in the carts, only specialty items/dimsum are hand delivered, but there is no way to know that based off the menu. Lastly, they only charge you for the stamps on your stamp card or paper receipt. If you wanna leave early, you won't be charged for all the items you marked off on the menu if you haven't received them.\n\nOver all, now that I got the hang of this confusing a$$ menu system, I would come here again for the clean environment and good food.

An angry couple kept wanting to see the manager but she refused to speak or even acknowledge them. It was kind of awkward seeing how the management was incapable of confrontation. Customer service among the other staff, however, was okay. \n\nWe ordered the $188 pre-set course for 7 people. Fried rice with oregano had an interesting and strong taste that we have not never tried from any other restaurant. Everything else was really salty! We thought the food would be good since it's quite crowded but we were wrong. Food's not great and it's expensive. Needless to say, we will not be returning.", "author": "Pansy L."}

So this place is no exception, especially because of the long lines on weekends for dimsum, but by the sheer number of natives who come here to eat with their family and friends every weekend, you can tell that the food is authentic.\n\nI came here with my boyfriend for weekend brunch - the wait was 20 minutes, after the manager opened up a private \"VIP\" wing to accommodate huge demand. So we ended up sitting at a private room with six or seven other tables - definitely less noise, and we had one dedicated waiter serving all of us.\n\nWe sat down for tea first - definitely recommend chrysanthemum tea. Its aroma is calm and peaceful. We ordered our small plates of dimsum while the carts made their walkabouts. Xiao long bao was juicy and flavorful. The scallion pancakes were extra fluffy and buttery. Shumai were tasty and well made. On a whole, it was a satisfactory dim-sum experience, but the restaurant experience, especially the waiting time, could be better managed.", "author": "Nancy L."}

My family had booked pretty much half the restaurant but, unfortunately, there were not enough seats to go around. I feel as though given the number of guests, the restaurant should have done more to reserve more tables for our party. My grandfather ended up standing around scouting for potential tables to snag for the party. \n\nThe food was plentiful and pretty good. It was buffet-style and there were servers to put food on your plate. I think it's both good and bad. Good, because there's someone serving you. Bad, because you can't control the portion sizes. There was chow-mein, fried rice, a whole roasted pig, fish and veggies, string beans and chicken, chicken drumsticks, egg rolls, and more. Everything was good except the drumsticks, which had a weird yellow-coloring to the skin. I thought it might be a curry-spice but it could also be bad oil. \n\nService, surprisingly, was very good. There were so many demanding Chinese guests (you know what I'm talking about) but the servers never flinched or seem frazzled when we asked for more tea, cups, or extra chairs. Instead of directing us to where we can get certain items they brought them directly to our table. Of course, that attitude changed slightly AFTER we paid but still, good service overall. \n\nOverall, I think it's a decent Chinese restaurant but not recommended for large parties. They also have a To-Go deli downstairs for quick dim-sum and pastries.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I asked two of All Season patrons who were smoking to move away from the side walk today, as I have asthma (and lots of disabled people live in the area).  They acted like they didn't understand me, replying in Chinese, but when I further stated that they must smoke at the Sidewalk on Diamond Heights Blvd. they stated they can smoke anywhere that they want to and that I was \"a little Bitch\".  \n\nThis is a smoking issue, not a racial issue as they inferred.   All Seasons is good for business no doubt, but they have single handely taken down the environmental quality of the area with excessive smoke, trash (cig butts), and customers who don't live in our area and could care less what happens to the neighborhood. \n\nEnough is Enough. \n\nI will not be threathened in my own neighborhood by chain smokers who have no regard for anyone else, including their own children.  Small children are always seen with these adults and they are embedded in smoke plumes from their own families.  \n\nIf you agree with me, contact the Diamond Heights Shopping Center property manager, the President of the Diamond Heights Community Association, Supervisor Scott Wiener, and Captian O'Mally of the Ingelside Police Station, which has juristriction in the area.

The lazy susan took brute strength to turn. We arrived at 5:30 so not much of a crowd, but the service was horrendous. They did not ask what type of tea we wanted and just gave us Jasmin. We had to ask for water. They said the menu was fixed for CNY, but later on we saw other tables ordering from the regular menu. They did accommodate by letting us order two items off the fix menu so the kids have some to eat. The host lady comes over and commented \"the food has all arrived\". Had she gone back and check she would've known we only had half the dishes come out. We asked several times where our steam fish dish was, they reply it's coming. Yes it finally arrived towards the end of our meal. The servers did not take away our dirty plates. One server came over and was ready to take away a dirty plate so there's room for the fish, had his hand on the plate then walked away from the lady that brings out the food. WTF! The lady wait there holding the fish plate decided she can serve us and put down the fish plate and took out the dirty plate. I've not been to an service oriented restaurant and received such bad service. The only saving grace is the food was okay. Fish and crab was excellently prepared, however the soup was tasteless. If this restaurant is to survive, they need to really look at the details and properly train their staff. I did not feel as though anyone there wanted to work there and took their job seriously.

Service was alright, can't really complain. \n\nOrdered the sticky rice in lotus leaf, moist, but I've had better. The Shanghai Dumplings were pretty good but there wasn't very much soup inside the dumpling. Their chicken feet was whole chicken feet, very rare now-a-days. The soy sauce chow mein was lacking soysauce? It tasted very bland. Also ordered the chinese donut wrapped in noodle. You can tell that the donut was refried cause it was EXTRA crispy, definitely not how it's suppose to be. \n\nI think because of the location, some come here to act like they're wealthy, not so much for the food.

So, even though we weren't super big fans of the food, we were dismayed at the kind-of-forced closing of Yet Wah.  And so we were prepared not to like this place (particularly since it has no bar!).  But we'll be fair.\n\nThe decor is similar but spruced up.  The servers are eager and obviously a little uncertain about this and that, but we had no complaints at all, and given the obvious attention to making customers happy, we are sure it will only improve from there.\n\nThe BIG item is the menu(*S*).  We are what they referred to a couple of times as Americans (= non-Chinese), and they have what seems to us a kind of old-fashioned--but probably sensible in many ways--policy of treating Americans differently from Chinese.  So we were given a menu full of familiar take-out standards: kung pao this and general tso that.  No mention of fresh seafood at all, despite the fish and shellfish dancing about in the tanks center-stage.\n\nMy wife took charge and found menus at the register that are completely different, and include dishes apparently regarded as unsuited to American patrons---gooey-duck this and goose-feet that.  But also fresh fish with ginger sauce, crab, etc., etc.   If you are looking for generic \"take-out Chinese\", take the basic menu, but if you have foodier hopes, ask for the Chinese menu.  We felt that we had to represent for the Americans, and my chop-stick skillz were at full-tilt (okay, I suck at that, but then I suck at fork skillz too).\n\nEverything we ordered was from the Chinese menu: a spicy (not very) soup with shrimp, scallops and other seafood (delicious, and the seafood was remarkably tender for being in a soup), fried tofu (SO crispy, salt-and-peppered with sliced fresh chilis---yum!), a pumpkin, yam, and some other stuff dish which was cooked just right and tasted as healthy as it looked, and finally the fresh (live until a few minutes before we ate it) sea bass, served gutted but whole for us to dissect (the servers DID seem a little skittish about how we Americans would handle that).  The fish is steamed and served in a ginger sauce---cooked just right and really, really tasty, with a sauce that was just light enough not to swamp the delicate flavor of the fish.\n\nNew place, so expect refinements, but our bottom line is that there is GOOD FOOD here.\n\nOne of the other reviews suggests the possibility of adding a bar.  From the way it's set up now, I doubt it.  But that would be awesome (doubly so if they could hire the amazing Aree to run it)!\n\nAs before, the easiest parking in SF, elevator accessible, an event room, and anyway a  huge space so no reservations needed ever.", "author": "Mark C."}

Better than the majority of places in HK. I know my dim sum. ;-)\n\nYou go to places like \"All Season\" for the food, not the atmosphere. If I wanted atmosphere, I'd expect to pay 1.5x to 2x more compared to this restaurant. This place is really noisy and not classy at all. I was surprised I didn't have to share a table with someone (which is pretty typical of dim sum places in NYC). They have a loud speaker near the door, where they yell out your number.\n\nThe dim sum is pretty decent here (7/10). In my opinion, to test the quality of a dim sum restaurant, it's best to order their shrimp dumplings and their soy sauce or XO stir fried rice rolls (Changfen or Cheongfun depending if you speak Mandarin or Cantonese). The shrimp in their shrimp dumplings cut up a bit and a little on the small side but compared to many dim sum places I've been to, they are pretty decent. Rice rolls should moist, soft, and springy; this place hit the spot for me.\n\nWe also ordered their steamed BBQ pork buns and egg yolk buns (nai huang bao or naiwong bao). My wife eats the egg yolk buns and I only like BBQ pork buns. The quality is pretty good; not too sweet. My only gripe is that they stick little fat chunks in the BBQ pork filling.\n\nTheir tea is crap and they charged me $2 per person! To their credit, most dim sum restaurants serve really crappy tea. The quality of tea that they serve is only worth $0.05 per pot. At home, we usually drink Tieguanyin quality that is approximately $5.00 per pot or appx $1200 per pound (It's still cheaper than a cup of coffee Starbucks!!). I'm definitely bringing my own tea when I go for dim sum here in SF.\n\nI lived in Beijing and Shanghai for the last 10 years and miss good Cantonese dim sum. I'm happy to return to North America.

I mean if you are a manager then you shouldn't be touching the customers utensils unless you replace or cleaning it off. \n\nThe food was already overprices, and we didn't have just one waiter but we had 5 including 2 of the managers. We ordered pork buns and the menu clearly said 4 pork buns, when the food came out we only got 3. So I asked about the pork buns and one of the waiters stated that the pork bun with the 4 on it is just the number of the order. So I asked for a menu and I pointed out that and the told the manager and got it almost at the end of us eating. \n\nFinally because I believed the service sucked, I decided not to leave a tip. I paid about 40$ from the bill then the manager looks at the bill and sees i didn't leave a tip, then says \"can you please leave a tip, i need to pay my workers.\" I find that disrespectful to do so, I know you have to pay tip sometimes but in this case i believe they didnt deserve it. \n\nI only gave 1 star just because my friend and i believed the honey walnut shrimp was good", "author": "Joe D."}

It's gonna be a long one.\n\n*That's what she said!* Hahaha...I've been watching too much Office. \n\nI'm going to go with the positives before delving into the negatives, but expect more negatives. It's usually how it works with children too.\n\nThe decor and ambiance of this place was really nice, so I had high hopes.  The prices are pretty high for a dim sum place too, so that factored into my expectations.  The wait was not atrocious, so another plus.\n\nWhen we got seated, things went downhill.  They took our order for tea. 2 place settings for 4 people. Not a big deal, so we waited.  Behold! The 2 settings we did have were dirty and stained brown (I can only assume it's tea). I tried not to make a big deal and wipe it off with my napkin. EH! Didn't come off.\n\nNext, a lady encouraged us to order food, but we said we'd wait for our tea and utensils first. She said it'd be quick; she was wrong.  We sat there for about 5+ minutes trying to flag people down. We got someone, asked for utensils and our tea. He comes back with one plate. Umm....okay. Our food was getting cold and more waiting. Perhaps it was because we were seated in the corner, but damn, this sucks. The food was not bad.\n\nSmall plates range from $1.99 to $2.60, but most are $2.60. Medium plates $3.40 and large plates $4.10-$5.80. I've had a lot of dim sum in my life, so this is on the more expensive side. Just sayin'. \n\nHonestly, I don't feel like we were asking for too much. I didn't expect to be waited on hand and foot, but they couldn't even get us the right number of settings. Getting our tea just a tad sooner and some clean plates/cups would've been nice. Just abhorrent. I think we waited longer for our tea and utensils than we did for the actual table.  \n\nMy mom tried to be nice and say, well, this is a grand opening, so maybe they don't really have their shit together or are short-handed. To which I replied, well, honestly, if this place was a person and this is my first impression of them, well, they suck. She agreed. We finally got our tea 15-20 minutes after being seated, which is pretty long comparatively.  \n\nWe were all pretty hungry and unhappy by this point, so instead of waiting for the dim sum carts that barely came by, we just ordered food off the menu. *Sigh* We ordered their \"special\" where you get an order of porridge and pan fried noodles for $22. It was alright. As we all know about my gluttonous ways, I didn't eat that much because I was so over this place and just ready to leave. I guess it's good that for one day in my life, I decided not to overeat. \n\nAlas, it was not a great experience. I was sad. This is sad. I will pray for you, All Season.", "author": "Dolores L."}

Well, the location and the decoration already tell me that it won't be cheap. However, a dish of $13 with only half of the plate portion is not very convincing, no matter how tasty it is.\n\nThe chicken is nice but the pig's foot is a failure. It's too tough to be edible and the skin was not even crispy. The Chinese broccoli was good but how difficult to make a good veggie dish and it's just overpriced. \n\nWe did not order rice for everyone but the waitresses just kept giving us more even we have asked them to stop.

Great service, they are are on it with filling the empty tea pot or they hustle to clean up for the next guests.  I loved the view of the trees even though it is the parking lot.  We ordered the special chicken with the slight spicy and garlicky sauce.  Go early because the wait can be long and crowded.  They have a little room in the back, like a private VIP room when their main room is filled.  Bring a big party to try everything, because the choices are so much and your tummy can fill only so much.  They let you pick from these colorful, mouthwatering menus.  Everything comes out from the kitchen hot.  They do have carts that come around for those who have to see the real deal.  I like this system.  No need to wait for your favorite dim sum to show up or not show up.  My other favorite is the sesame mochi, the filling oozes out and you actually taste the sesame.  Did you know the more black sesame you eat, you have less white hair (for Asians only, not sure for non-Asians, but that's another study someone should do).  Back to the food, drool until the food is in front of you. Thanks to SL for recommending this hide-away place.  The noise level isn't bad.

But the night I went there for dinner I was with family and extended family, a dozen hungry Asians in all.  We ordered one of their set dinners and added an extra dish of veggies... Plain and simple stir-fry veggies, literally 3 ingredients and 1 min on the wok. \nEverything came out first, another surprise was a veggie dish with deep fried tofu.  Now, one doesn't expect a hot dish with partially frozen tofu but sadly that was exactly the case.  The tofu was not cooked entirely, in fact I bit into ice, tried another one to be sure, same issue. Told the waiter who promptly took dish away. Only to have it returned a few mins later LOOKING EXACTLY AS IT DID!  Rather than making a new one, they merely microwaved it!  The icing on the cake was the extra veggie dish I mentioned, when we told the waiter we ok longer wanted it & to remove from our tab, they said \"oh it's already on it's way\" and it comes out a few mins later after our entire table has been cleaned off of plates.  I don't usually write bad reviews, and what's more I actually liked this place as the food is usually pretty good.  However my family and I will think twice about this place next time.", "author": "Kevin C."}

Still, waiting over an hour for Chinese food is no bueno. After ordering 5 dishes and 2 soups for 5 people, the only thing we got in the 1.5 hours we were there were the soups... they were ok. Everyone was getting restless and started people watching. The table next to us had well over 20 people and they looked BORED. One dish came out like every half an hour and it had to be divvied up slowly by 20 some people. The only other thing that kept us occupied was the 2 episodes of Friends on their flat screen TV... the volume was off and we played \"guess the episode\"... \n\nHaving not eaten a whole meal, we still shelled out $50 bucks for 2 soups. Hoards of Chinese patrons left at the same time, striking up conversations about their common fury. We agreed, kitchen's fault, not the wait staff. Wait staff were polite and you could tell they were embarrassed by the slow food service... they should have went in and hurried the kitchen!! \n\nAs big as their faux pas was, I would come back to give them another chance, probably not on a holiday.", "author": "Cynthia W."}

If you grew up in norcal (SF), you've probably tried almost all the dimsum places that exist in the city and by now... if you are like me, are pretty bored or sick of most of them. This place opened recently so I had to get my lazy ass out of the house on weekends and give this place a try. \n\nIf you come here on sat or sun morning, u better come here early or make reservations because this place is pretty packed. With no reservations, table for 6 on a sat morning had about a 30min wait. Luckily, they serve dimsum until 5pm so it's cool if you need to sober up in the morning after a long night of partying. \n\nWe were seated by the corner but that didn't stop the carts from coming by. LOVE IT. We didn't have any down time for eating and the decor of this place is pretty nice! Parking is a slight battle since it is located inside a shopping center with grocery stores and other small shops so put on your helmet and drive like you are in chinatown. \n\nI came here with 6 people.. ate everything we wanted to and the bill was a shocking $52 (including tax and tip). I couldn't believe it!  The selection was great, and of course you can have special orders as well. The dinner menu looks really nice from the pictures on the website so I really wanna give that a try next time.\n\nAnyhow, come suck your chicken feet, slurp on your thousand-year-old-egg-porridge, drown your mouth with your shanghai dumplings, and grub on all the delicious shiumai and hagao's here because your wallet won't mind it at all and your taste buds will thank you.", "author": "Mishi W."}

Also, no seating area for people waiting--though they pulled out one chair for only one of the elderly ladies waiting.

The wait was the typical 25-30 mins for a Dim Sum restaurant.  The atmosphere is fine.  Truth be told, I would've never known about this 'hidden valley' had it not been for the article.  Anyway, the food is alright.  It's at par with the other Dim Sum joints in Millbrae.  A notable mention is that it offers black sesame roll which in today's Dim Sum arena is few and far between.  This dish is old-school Hong Kong dim sum which they made it quite well (not greasy).  I don't see it offered in most other places.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-12", "description": "The greeting was much better than the standard one most Chinese restaurants manage (\"HOW MANY!!\")  It often takes a moment or two to regain my composure after the abrupt accusatory inquiry from the hostess.  My favorite experience was when \"HOW MANY!!\" was followed by \"YOU!!  SIT!!\" \n\nBack to the ALL SEASON experience.  It was dinnertime.  The hostess said welcome or good evening or something to that effect.  She smiled.  So far so good.  The atmosphere was a notch above the type of Chinese restaurant where as many tables as possible are crammed in and the lights are painfully bright.  The tablecloths were clean, but were upside down on our table, and on the ones nearby.  This place has the obligatory ignored TV blaring from the wall, tasteful decor, and appropriate lighting.  \n\nThe food, it pains me to say, was sad and bland.  The veggies in the sizzling rice soup were only frozen peas and carrots (maybe from a Costco giant bag?)  And none of the four dishes had any character to entice us to pay a repeat visit.\n\nThe staff brought us forks as soon as we ordered.  One was clean and the other had food encrusted on it.  Never mind; they went unused.  It is, for better or worse, a pet peeve of mine when waiters assume that non-Chinese diners could not possibly know what to do with chopsticks.  \n\nThey charge $1 for each tiny bowl of rice.  There are two schools of Chinese restaurants when it comes to rice.  Usually this is a trademark of restaurants which are trying to be fancy.  In this sort of restaurant, you won't know their rice policy until after your food has been sitting in front of you for a while, since many restaurants seem to bring the big container of rice out well after the food arrives.  After a few minutes, you realize it's not coming, and flag down your waiter, who invariably acts surprised that you'd ask for rice.  The question they always ask (and I have no idea why, but they do, and they did it at ALL SEASON) is \"steam rice or fry rice?\"  Now If I wanted a dish of greasy fried rice, I would have ordered it along with my choices on the menu. To me the question seems absurd, as I have ordered a wide range of tastes and textures, and can't imagine eating them over anything but plain rice.\n\nNow we get to the grave issue of the name.  ALL SEASON is so awkward to say as written that I suspect most of us sneak an \"S\" on to the end just to ease the pain of saying it.  I do wish the business owners would have consulted a native-speaker of English before spending thousands on their signs and menus.  We would have cheerfully offered this advice for free:  that \"S\" is not optional.\n\nThis reminds me of a take out menu that was attached to my door recently.  It was from a local Chinese restaurant, full of photos and bright graphics.  The menu items were listed in English and Chinese, but nowhere on the menu was there the name of the restaurant in English.  There was only the name in Chinese characters on the front.  Someone had pasted a small white label, approximately the size of a fortune cookie fortune, on each of what was presumably a run of thousands of menus.  This faux pas, along with the error of ALL SEASON, shows either a ignorance of the English language, great carelessness, or an unwillingness to ask for advice.  Or mostly likely a combination of all three.  \n\nThere are much better choices if you want some real Chinese food.  I'd go again only under duress.", "author": "tout le monde a."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-12-18", "description": "My husband and I decided to try the restaurant for dim sum (we have tried the take-out downstairs and it was fine, if a little pricey).  We were really excited about maybe finding a local place to go (since moving from the E Bay to Glen Park we've not been lucky finding a replacement for an easy to get to, decent food, and reasonable price dim sum in the City). $100 at Yang Sing just isn't something we can do on a regular basis.\n\nI will admit that we got there at the wrong time to not wait (11.30 AM on a Sunday), and I would have been concerned if they didn't have a wait at that time.  So, my complaint is not with the wait (around 1/2 hour for 2 of us).  However, when our number came up, things got a bit unacceptable.  \n\nThey called our number - we saw the open table up against the window (we were joking that we were going to get the good table).  Off of a sudden two women get sat down there and the woman at the front desk looked confused and asked us to wait.  Another 5 minutes and then she takes us to another window seat and apologized for the wait.  We sit down, plates put down (actually, us holding them up as they dry off the table),  and then the front desk woman gets a call and asks us to change tables again.  She then leads us to the back corner, at which time we just walk out since we both felt that we'd had enough.\n\nThe waitress was nice and apologetic and was responding to others actions/directions (so I don't blame her), but both my husband and I came away not sure if the issue was that they were trying to save the 4 person seats and a 2-3 seater came up last minute, if the owner's friends showed up and were placed ahead of us two times, or the fact we were one of the only non-Asians (and only mixed race couple) in the place so that they didn't have an issue shifting us around in a way they wouldn't have done with someone else (I truthfully don't like to play the race card, but this is one of the times I did have to question what was going on - left to my husband this last point would be expressed much stronger and include @%$#?!).\n\nSo, it may just a bad organizational gaff where they wanted to put us at a table that only fit 2-3 people to save the other table for a party of 4; however, good customer service would have been to leave us at the table and not screw around with us a second time.\n\nWhile we would both have loved to find a local dim sum place, our search will continue, with trips to Alameda for our mid-price option at East Ocean and Yang Sing for when I can face the bill - at least I feel if we are sat down at either, we'll be allowed to keep the table no matter who shows up after our number is called.", "author": "Cat R."}

We thought we'd beat the Mother's Day crowd and try out a new place for our family to celebrate Mother's Day.  The food would have received three stars.  I've had better.  The service was ok, but the food coordination earned this restaurant the two stars.\n\nTo start off, some of the dishes weren't clean.  The person who brought the soup bowls must have felt a little bad because he had to take some of the bowls back and replace them.  We also noticed that the steamed rice was not hot and seemed like it was \"re-used\".  Either that or they just don't know how to cook and serve steamed rice.  \n\nWe had ordered ten dishes for a party of nine.  \n1 - Jelly Fish (3 stars.  Hard to mess up this cold plate standard). \n2 - Hot & Sour Soup (3 stars.  My mother makes better, but it was OK)\n3 - Peking Duck (2.5 stars, but could the duck be any more skinnier....where's the meat?  That and the duck could have been less oily)  \n4 - Deep Fried Tofu (3 stars.  Don't eat it without the soy sauce mixture unless you like bland fried tofu)\n5 - Ginger Garlic Lamb (3 stars.  I have a fine tuned palate and I am actually able to tell the difference between lamb and beef, even if it is in sauce.  I swear I had a chunk of beef mixed in with lamb)\n6 - Curry Shrimp Chow Mein (2.5 stars. Too dry and not enough shrimp)\n7 - Salt & Pepper Pork Chops (4 stars.  Eat this hot.  The meat is tender and the peppers were \"hot enough\".\n8 - Glazed Walnut Prawns (3 stars.  Just OK and not enough.....)\n9 - I don't recall the name, but it is some sort of tofu dish.  Diced tofu in a sauce my nephew said it looked like it was just the hot and sour soup thickened.  It tasted like it had preserved salted turnip as an ingredient.  But everyone else said I was mistaken.\n\nKevin the waiter was as I said before....OK.  He couldn't help the fact that another server brought to our table a dish of Curry Prawns instead of what my brother ordered, Curry Shrimp Chow Mein.  Given the amount of shrimp in the Chow Mein, we might have fared bettered with the Curry Prawns. \n\nAnd as the final nail in the coffin, we seemed to have ordered a tenth dish.  A steamed egg custard dish.  First Kevin was made aware that we were nearly finished and the last dish had not arrived.  A few minutes later we sent up my sister in law to talk to what looked like a manager type (he was in a tie and jacket).  A few minutes after that we were given dessert and the bill.  At first we had thought by now they must be ready and reminded the person who brought the check we were still waiting.  But when she went around looking like the dish was not ready, seeking the manager, we decided to end this comedy of errors.\n\nAt least we got dessert.  Hopefully this is not typical of the restaurant, and it only happened because we were their guinea pigs for Mother's Day Sunday.", "author": "Glenn N."}

The Lobster noodles were the best I've had in a long time!\n\nThe place is very busy with a line out the door.  I can't tell how long the wait was since our area was reserved.

I immediately asked (in Cantonese) for the Chinese menu. The waiter said okay, but after a few minutes no such menus were forthcoming, so, properly schooled by my fellow Yelpers, I went over to the hostess station and retrieved them, rescuing my friends from sweet and sour pork. However, when we tried to order the authentic stuff we had no problems or resistance in our doing so.\n\nLotsa interesting stuff on that menu. \n\nWe decided to start with a jellyfish appetizer. I've previously had jellyfish that came in a vinegar sauce. Instead, this had a very mild flavor with a bit of sesame seeds and 0.001 of spiciness. The two white guys enjoyed the jellyfish; the Viet guy thought it was just okay. I give it 3.5 stars.\n\nNext was the strangely named (so strange I have to look it up on the menu -- go download it, by the way, it's full of food porn)  Aweto Flower & Black Fungus; it came with the flower, the fungus and some kind of squash (Yelp won't let me include Chinese but the squash is in the Chinese name of the dish but not in the English name). the squash, which was not bitter melon, was the highlight of the dish, as well as having a flavorful, very light sauce. I give it 4 stars.\n\nThen came the Braised Chinese Eggplant in Clay Pot. This was extremely flavorful. Despite the pepper symbol on the menu, I didn't find it hot, but it was eat-down-to-the-bottom-of-the-serving-dish good. 4.5 stars.\n\nThe last is hard to judge. We ordered Stewed Pumpkin w/ Yam in Coconut Milk, but they were out of pumpkin and suggested taro. It was not bad, but not that interesting either. 3 stars with the taro, but we would have been better off ordering something else and ordering this dish another time when they had the pumpkin. We didn't bother to take the remainders home. They did comp us a mango pudding each and a shared green tea pudding in compensation. The mango was decent, 3.5 stars. The white guys didn't care for the green tea but my Viet friend liked it.\n\nService was friendly if occasionally random.\n\nI would definitely eat here again because the higher price tag is justified by the quality and interestingness of the food.", "author": "Charles B."}

Until then, this is certainly a thousand times better than the Yet Wah that dished out salty, tasteless food for soooo many years!  I ordered the Crab E-Mein to go, and before I could tap out a text message it was ready.  When I saw that most dishes were $9.99 - 12.95, I almost walked out.  I felt it my duty to try it as I saw a lot of people there and it was 7:30 in the evening.  They won't see me a lot with these prices, but I am glad to know that there is finally a decent restaurant in the hood.  I will try a few other dishes, as the noodles were mighty tasty and they don't seem to use a lot of msg or salt.

Easy to find location and ample parking - 1*.  Our plates were replaced to a clean one and dim-sum dishes were removed as soon as it's empty - 2*.  Staffs are friendly and attentive - 3*.  Although majority of the dim-sum we want had to be ordered on a check list, food came out fast and piping hot - 4*.  Taste, look, and quality of food is comparative to Koi Palace and Zen.  We had 8 dishes of dim-sum and the check came out significantly less than when we went to the other upper scale dim sum houses - 5*.   The pro of All Season is that it opens at 9:30am on Sat. & Sun. which is earlier than the competition.  The con is that some specialty dishes are not available before 10am because the head chef comes in at 10am.  There are plenty of other dim-sums to hold me till 10am.  I'm an early bird, I'm happy to be able to get in earlier and start sipping hot tea while I study the menu and wait for 10am.  I highly recommend All Season.  I know the reviews here are mixed.

The chicken in a bucket was something new that I've never seen or tried before. I thought it would be satisfactory quality but it turned out to be ver savoury and fresh. The egg white fried rice was delicious. The egg white in particular was flavorful and a tiny bit crunchy. The roasted squab had crunchy skin and tender. We ordered more dishes and they were good too but these three were the bomb. The service was great and  plentiful. The restaurant is up scale and beautifully designed.

We were greeted in a very friendly manner since the owner was a family friend and we were seated and served tea almost instantly. It took us a while to order, but when we finally did, the dim sum came pretty quickly. We were given a  dish of Preserved Duck Egg Pastry that was very good and with a nice amount of flakiness. I liked the dimsum but I thought that it was on the pricey side. The restaurant itself was absolutely beautiful. By 11:30-ish, the restaurant was near filled and the noise level reached the standard, comforting loudness of a good restaurant.

When we asked her how long do we have to wait until we get seated, her answer was \"you only waited 20 mins wait a little longer or go walk around before asking me AGAIN.\" Again? We only asked her once. After we were seated, we waited another 1/2 hr before our first dish was served. We ordered the exact same dishes for both tables but all of the food came out mixed up. We ordered lobster but one of the table got crabs instead. Service there is really slow. The hostess and waiters were not professional. They never really bothered asking if everything was alright. We ended up getting up ourselves to get extra napkins and plates. Honestly I think the kitchen needs a little improvement and organization. Two of their waiters made this experience a better one that's why I gave it a two star. They knew that they screwed up on a lot of the dishes so one of them even said we don't need to give him tips because we weren't really provided with the services.

I saw several other tables checking this menu, and if they didn't plan on accepting it, why even give it to people?  So then we waited to see what food they had carting around.
