{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-10-21", "description": "Cafe Claude, you are a French Cloude floating amid the SF financial district.  A little piece of Paris for the hefty price of San Francisco - a little food staycation for those that want more than food... like jam (no, not the fruity jar-ed kind - the melodic kind). I like that this restaurant integrates a musical live jazz experience with the romantic French prose of food - the escargot; the wine; the French onion soup; the chocolate soft cake.  It is an experience for the taste buds - and for the ear buds over a most memorable experience with your best buds (the human ones).  \n\nIt is nice that the people running the restaurant are  from France, and are very helpful and kind in making recommendations and providing decent service (though it could have been a bit more efficient). \n\nWhat dishes did I enjoy?\n\n(1) The escargots en croute.  I liked the buttery, garlic and parsley infused reduction with shallots and anchovy - and how the escargot were baked in like delicate swirled angels sleeping in a puff pastry blanket.  \n\n(2) My favorite dish was the french onion soup (soup a l'oignon). And is the oignON spot ON. My only constructive criticism about this dish is that I wish it were less salty. However, the onion soup gratinee had a most beautiful red wine aftertaste that married well with the melting emMENTAL cheese that is a mental wonderland. The baguette crouton was sliced in the perfect thickness to create a golden ratio of onion soup. \n\n(3) Actually - I take that back. My actual favorite dish was the dessert. The Moelleux au Chocolat was in fact my favorite dish here.  The soft chocolate cake was not too sweet - which I appreciated as the bitterness of the chocolate was able to come through to surface in its natural roughness. The Creme Anglaise vanilla sauce was poured in, melding in with the chocolate to form a chocolate-creme anglaise combination that was black and white harmony at its most intimate peak. \n\nWhat dishes could have used perhaps a little more thoughtfulness?\n\n(A) The Casserole de Champignon. The ingredients were great - the farro verde, the king trumpet mushrooms, the carrots, the broccolini and kale.  I just wish there were more flavor other than butter. And I wish that there was more to it. I am a person who appreciates simplicity when it comes to good food - but there is simplicity done thoughtfully and tastefully and simplicity done in the other direction. I am afraid this fell in the latter category. \n\n(B) Confit de Canard. The duck was crisp, but it came at the expense of moisture, for I have never eaten such a dry piece of duck in my life. I was also a bit disappointed at the portion size. I did appreciate the warm puy lentils and the fris\u00e9e; and I enjoyed the flavor of course mustard against the duck.  \n\nCafe Claude, I applaude that you share a little piece of France - and beautiful live music with it - in the oft busy SF life.

There was candles on the tables and dimmed lights.\n\nNow the best part, the food...\n\nAssiettes de 3 Fromage ($18) - 3 different cheeses out of a variety that you can choose from. Unfortunately I do not remember the names of the cheese, but I like 2 out of 3 of the cheese that we chose. My friend likes salty cheese but it was way too salty for my liking. The honeycomb and walnuts were tasty though.\n\nMoules a la Proven\u00e7ale ($19) - these mussels were in a very tasty saffron tomato stew. We got the larger one and after having the cheese appetizer and the mussels.. I was already pretty full. The mussels were cooked nicely and the stew was a great compliment with the mussels. It also came with a baguette with olive tapenade but since I do not like olives, I took a bite and put it down.\n\nEspadon ($27) - the pan seared swordfish was delicious. It also came with cherry tomatoes and potatoes. At this point, my stomach was bulging out of my jeans but it was so good that I finished the fish.\n\nCreme brulee ($10) - I was done eating at this point but we decided to share a dessert to try anyways. The creme brulee is pretty big and great for sharing even with maybe 3 people. I took a few bites but I was so full that I didn't have room for more. It was the best creme brulee I ever had. It was so soft and creamy and the glazed part on top wasn't too sweet. Amazing, and I didn't even need coffee to go with it.\n\nService was great. Our server was attentive and filled our water whenever we were low. He made sure regularly that we enjoyed our food and that we were doing okay. He even sweeped off the bread crumbs from our table when we were transitioning from appetizers to our entree.

Made reservation on OpenTable a week ahead of time and requested special occasion treatment due to my husband's birthday celebration. \n\nWe were greeted and seated outside in the COLD weather and despite my complaint about having made a reservation and special occasion we were directed outside to dine at metal chairs and tables instead of the upscale sitting inside with white linen and proper atmosphere. The heaters didn't work well, we sat there in our jackets the entire time and made for an all together a lousy experience!! \n\nThe appetizers escargot and foie gras were mediocre, the escargot was a bit on the tough side and lacked the flavor we are used to. The niciose salad was a disappointment as it was prepared with canned tuna, nothing fresh about it. We ordered 3 onion soups and found pieces of charcoal burnt onions inside the soup!! Not very appetizing.\n\nThe trout was probably one of the better entrees that we ordered. Others were steak tartare, steak and fries, and crispy duck. They were all OK nothing great. \n\nThe dessert was probably the best part of the dinner which was chocolate mousse, apple tart and creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e (please note the extra star is for the desserts).

It was a busy Saturday night and there was a live band playing, people laughing and the energy felt very....French. But France in the 20's where everything was romantic in a gypsy sort of way.\n\nThe real reason I am writing this review is because our server Jillian was incredible. She greeted us with a warm smile and told us a few favorite things on the menu she enjoyed. We talked about bottles of wine and she upsold me a bottle that was way worth the price. All of her suggestions were delicious (the duck!) and she checked in on us in a timely manner.

They looked good, though I did not partake.\n- I ordered the steak frites. The fries were fine -- standard, crispy shoestring ones. The steak was mediocre. It was quite sinewy and a little tough.

After looking on opentable I thought this place would be a great spot to check out. We had a reservation for lunch at 2:30PM but after running late from another event they were more than willing to change it to 2:45PM. Thank you for that! \n\nThis location is in an alley so don't expect to be finding on the street casually walking by. I actually like that since it's hidden from all the crowds and to me makes it a little more special. Once you come up to the place you realize that there is an outside area and a small indoor area. The place has a black mirror wall that really expands the place and you realize how small it is. Bathrooms are also through the back door & shared I believe. \n\nWHAT WE GOT: \n\n- Escargot - Not my fave. The puff pastry was a nice touch but I thought it tasted better with the bread vs the escargot itself. \n\n- Steak & Fries - I asked for it rare and it came pretty done. The steak wasn't cooked evenly and while I was excited about the bone marrow butter, I thought the taste steak/meat was covered by the gravy they added on top. The french fries were super crispy though which I enjoyed.\n\n- Crispy Duck - The crispy duck was perfectly crisp on the outside while staying juicy on the inside. I wish there were other sides vs. what it came with since it felt like something was lacking.\n\n- Solace - Get this! If you're a fan of gin and want something refreshing this is a great option. \n\nOverall, the service was OK. The waitress was sure to make sure she was available when we ordered and asked for the check, but aside from that it felt hands off. TBH it was nice spot to check out but I don't think the food/portions warranted the high prices.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

I will forever and always dote on French cuisine just as much as I dote on French art such as that of my Claude Monet.  So, it was quite fitting when my fianc\u00e9 I found ourselves seated at a fantastic cafe named after my favorite artist (not saying that Claude Monet actually inspired the naming of this restaurant).\n\nThe presence of live jazz music made up for the lack of lily pads, but the music-induced ambience sure made me feel as if I was enjoying myself in little old Giverny.  The music filled the entire interior and exterior space, and as my fianc\u00e9 and I were sat outside we enjoyed the lovely weather in addition to the fantastic music.  I believe that the live jazz music only occurs on Thursday nights (though I could be wrong)...if I'm not wrong, you should plan a date night here on Thursday's!  Even were you to come on any other night, Cafe Claude is brilliant choice for date night, especially if you do opt to sit outside (given it is warm enough - but don't worry, there's heated lamps).  Sitting outside gives the sense that you're in a Parisian alley, enjoying all the luxuries of life.\n\nAll this and I haven't even gotten to the food.  Though everything else makes the trip to Cafe Claude worth it, the cuisine is the star.  We ordered the escargot to begin with, and that's a must as this escargot is topped with some beyond good pastry substance.  Then we got the croquet madame, charcuterie board, and the French onion soup for splitting.  This was the second best croquet madame I have had (the very best being in Paris) because of how perfectly balanced and rich every ingredient was.  The French onion soup was also in the top 5 best that I've had - and this soup was huge!  So that was all savory and delicious, but we ended on a high note by getting the chocolate cake souffl\u00e9 which was just as good as those you would get in France.  Clearly these chefs were trained well!  \n\nThere's also some superb cocktails here; I've been having a constant craving for any drink that infuses some lavender or rose...and I found myself in luck here when finding the Sparkles in the Sky cocktail.  It was so good that it was almost impossible to keep myself from throwing it back just like that.  I had to be a classy lady.

Softest and tastiest swordfish I've ever had in my so far short lifetime. I, myself ordered the duck/ confit de canard ($26) and came with lentils over some type of salad. I was surprised with the lentils since I expected to not enjoy it as much as I did. It definitely helped that was some nice pork pieces mixed in with the lentils. I would have preferred less of it though. The duck itself was tasty but had some really dry and stringy parts that I had to leave because they were unchewable but it was a small amount. \n\nMy sisters ordered (the 2 of them) the steak frites ($28) and the casserole de champignon ($20). The casserole was probably my second favorite dish. It's not very colorful but it's really delicious and I just love baby carrots. The dish was very comforting too. The steak was definitely the most disappointing dish since my sister had asked for medium rare and her steak was completely done and she didn't tell us that the steak was so chewy it was hard for her to eat it until we were out of the restaurant. \n\nOverall I had a good experience with only a couple setbacks but I would definitely suggest going with the seafood and chicken dishes! The staff will be awesome and super sweet!", "author": "Stephanie C."}

She seemed genuinely apologetic and mentioned how she implemented a corrective action for herself- she would ask the customer to be on hold if she were to ever to feel as stressed as she was earlier that afternoon. This way no other customer would have to experience the unpleasantness I experienced.

We were seated at a nice table without any issues, and proceeded to order the RW menu and added on some escargots (a must-order for me!). We ordered:\n\n-Escargots: delicious! They came with these little pastry puff hats, which added a slight crunch. There weren't as many herbs as I usually like, but still very good. TIP: Don't eat all of the complimentary bread- save some so you can dip them into the butter/herb remnants in the wells of the escargot plate. Yum!\n\n-Salt Cod Brandade Croquettes (RW): there was a bit of a hiccup because our waiter told us after we ordered that they didn't have any croquettes anymore. I told him to come back again because my friend had gone to the restroom and obviously couldn't make a choice. When she got back, she said that she didn't want to do the RW menu anymore. The waiter came back and told us that they were already in the process of making our food and it was essentially too late. What's the point of telling us after we ordered then telling us that we can't change it! Luckily, the guy came back around said that he was told that they had enough croquettes for the two of us. The croquettes were very good and I'm glad we were able to have them after all of that.\n\n-Hanger Steak a la Plancha (RW): sadly very disappointing. My friend got it medium and I asked for medium rare. The waiter didn't double-check which one had which, but it didn't matter because they were too well cooked on both sides. Way too much chewing to enjoy this. \n\n-Roasted Apple Crumble a la Mode (RW): very, very good. I had a terrible experience with a similar apple crumble at another french restaurant, and that crumble attempted to get the right balance of caramelized apple/sugar/crunch. This one got it right. \n\nOverall, still enjoyed it, although I would avoid the steak in the future. 4/5.", "author": "Elodie T."}

I sh*t you not. \n\nWhy would you give a table that went through the effort of making advanced reservations the worst and most unwanted table in the joint? Sure there's a heat lamp on one side that kept one arm of the two people on the end of the table mildly warm, but we all had to leave our jackets on, I was freezing from head to toe, and at one point a skittish pigeon attacked our table. No thanks. \n\nOur servers were largely absent and we ended being waited on by 3 different people, including the host. Our lunch took far longer than expected and the only reasoning we could offer was because no one server wanted to come outside to serve because it was way too cold... and they wouldn't have been wrong. We would know since we sat out there in our jackets still shivering for almost 2 hours. \n\nI got the soup of the day (lentil) served in a bowl but not even topped off all the way so it was more like a cup with an extra large brim around it only drawing more attention to how sad the portion was. The creme fraiche couldn't have looked less appetizing if it tried (see photo if you think your stomach can handle it) and the soup was soooo watery yet full of all the fleck-y grainy stuff you'd expect to find at the bottom of the pot. My table-mate and I who also had soup had to wonder if they watered down what was left in an attempt to (barely) fill the bowl to complete the order. Soup du Jour? More like river water. \n\nOn the bright side, my frites were good but I'm a person who loves a soggy fry and I seem to be in the minority on that.\n\nEach time a different server would bring out a round, there was always confusion about where the drink, or dish, or coffee went at the table. Every time. Every single thing. Some basic serving and table seat numbering would have helped them avoid the mix-up every single time they brought anything to the table. \n\nIf the price point were lower they'd absolutely be a 3-star restaurant but for a $10 a cup of watered down soup, a \"reserved\" table in the cold with the animals of alley, and absent service, 2 stars seems right on the money.\n\nThey should be embarrassed about the experience they so carelessly provided.", "author": "Candice G."}

Doesn't get any better than that! I had the opportunity to come to Cafe Claude with a good friend just for the last night of the 2017 San Francisco Restaurant Week, which for all intensive purposes can serve as the perfect gauge to what kind of food they serve on a normal day. And Cafe Claude was offering up a real nice option four full courses for only forty dollars for SFRW. You cannot get a better deal than that! \n\nWe came on a Sunday evening, where it was busy inside but with decently cool weather outside we chose to sit under the heat lamps and a big covered awning. Nothing like French Food in a San Francisco alleyway on a Sunday evening! At 40 dollars a person for their 4 course pre-fix dinner, it was an affordable way to sample new dishes that aren't normally featured on their daily dinner menu. We began with a rather large amuse bouche otherwise known as the Gravlax Tartine which was a pumpernickel toast topped with house creme fraiche, bread and butter picked radish, salmon roe and frisee. Then we moved on to a Charred Chicories Salade topped with macerated carrots, French feta, spiced walnuts, pear and drizzled with a toasted walnut vinaigrette. The main course featured an Alsatian Braised Pork mixed with a healthy does of potato dumplings, roasted apples and braised rainbow chard. We wrapped with a Creme Brulee dessert which was made with Tahitian vanilla. \n\nI really loved the pumpernickel toast with a heavy dose of sweetness and savoriness thanks to all of the creme fraiche. The Salade was filled with a ton of veggies but couldn't get over all of the extra \"roughage\". I really liked the pork dish as cooked well done but nicely tempered with the dumplings and all of the apples and chard. The highlight for me was the divine creme brulee because you can never go wrong with dessert especially with an after hours coffee or wine! The service and ambiance at Cafe Claude is always on point whether you are sitting inside or out on the street. As the night wore on, the place got even busier especially outside on their makeshift patio on the street. It didn't really feel like Parisian dining tonight as Cafe Claude had more of an East Coast vibe to its atmosphere. This meal gave me a real feeling for the kind of meal they serve every night at Cafe Claude and I can't wait to go back to sample their regular menu.

All in all, my experience was certainly not negative but I had definitely been hoping for more.\n\nI made a reservation one night about two minutes before making the 15-minute walk over for my reservation at the bar. When I arrived, I was already impressed by the heated seating outside (although I was not ABOUT to be out there because it was cold) and the nice ambience, even visible from the outside of the restaurant. When I entered, I saw that there was no bar seating, and the host informed me that one party had finished their meal but had been chatting leisurely for ages. Long story short: It was sort of funny because the host went to talk to the manager, and then they talked to someone else, and I knew they were trying to find me a table because they kept looking over at me in their hushed whispers...in a few minutes, the manager came over and explained that bar seating probably wouldn't open up for a while and that if I would be OK with a table (which I was--solo dinner before heading to the airport) I could be seated right away. \n\nAfter a while, the friendly waitress came over and gave me the wine menu, from which I proceeded to solicit a suggestion to accompany the confit de canard (duck confit). She smiled and said, \"That's an easy one...the pinot noir from Bourgogne.\" I was definitely pleased with her recommendation and had a second glass later. \n\nI ordered the onion soup as an appetizer, and thought it was good although not particularly flavorful. The cheese was sort of a mass, so it was sort of like soup with the cheese added onto the top. Onion soup is one of those things that I find French restaurants either do very well or just very OK, and unfortunately, this was the latter for me. I followed this up with the duck confit, which was overcooked (which made me very sad!). The crispy skin on the duck was nice--actually, a very nice touch--but was overshadowed by the fact that it was overcooked. The duck was accompanied by lentils and fris\u00e9e, which was oddly a bit overpowering. I kept coming up on these very noticeable chunks of onion that were very jarring. \n\nThe venue had wonderful live music all evening and overall an excellent ambience. It's relatively small with a nice vibe, and I could tell that people really enjoy themselves here. I would totally come back here for happy hour to enjoy a glass of wine and music with friends, although I think I will move onto some other French restaurants on my list for my next trip to SF.

Too bad none of the things I wanted was on the happy hour menu tho :(\n\nMy friend and I shared a couple of dishes: foie gras, steak and frites, escargot, and steak tartare (5 oz). This was actually more than enough for 2 people.\n\nFoie gras (3.5/5)\nThis dish was overall pretty sweet. It came with two slices of toast, similar to French toast to me, with mandarin slices and a generous slab of foie gras, which was super fatty and rich. Overall, it was enjoyable, but savory + sweet was just a little odd for me. \n\nSteak and frites (3.5/5) \nThis dish gives you a very generous portion of meal and fries. The fries were perfecttttt. However the steak was a bit too cooked for my liking. I asked for medium rare, but this was closer to medium or medium well, so it was also a bit tough. Comes with a fat slice of bone marrow butter which gives it a great flavor though!\n\nEscargot (5/5)\nSuper delicious garlicky buttery flavor to it! Would totally come back just for this dish. Ask for extra bread to dip it in he delicious garlic sauce! The escargot itself was very tender and the little flakey pastry on top paired perfectly with it.\n\nSteak tartare (5/5)\nI loveeee steak tartare! Cafe Claude gives you an option for 3oz or 5 oz dish, and obviously I ordered the 5 oz. It ended up being too big of a portion even for someone like me and a friend to share, so I recommend getting the 3 oz next time.

Be prepared for expensive wine.\n\nI was there with two others and we shared two salads (Nicoise and frisee), the Croque Madame, and the beef tartare.  I thought the Croque Madame was excellent.  The bread was buttery and crispy, and the egg was cooked perfectly (runny yolk, solid white.)  The frisee salad would have been wonderful but the yolk of the egg wasn't runny, which was disappointing.  But it was well dressed and the slab bacon was crispy on the outside but still  had a nice chewy heft to it.  The tartare was respectable, but a little heavy on the capers.  I think the tartare at Wayfare Tavern is the best, but at least Cafe Claude's was far better than the last two I've had (at Cafe Prague and at Etcetera Wine Bar where they both put tomato products in, yuck!)  \n\nWe were seated outside and even with the heat lamps and protective plastic tenting, it was still quite chilly, I had to keep my coat on for the duration of our meal.

I started with the escargot which was bathed in a garlic butter sauce. For my entr\u00e9e, I had the Coq au vin. The red wine sauce was delicious, especially with the little bits of pancetta floating in it. Finally, the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e melts in your mouth. The custard is perfectly creamy and sweet and the caramelized sugar is just the right color of caramel brown.

We were a party of 3 for a weekday lunch and our food came out 2 hours later. My gf was hangry and trust me you do not want to see the hulk unleashed. Finally got my order which was supposed to be a medium rare steak (all three of us confirmed with the server to have it this way) but it came out well done. WTF. After waiting so long for our food?? Come on now.... did the chef take a smoke break and leave the meat on the grill? didn't even bother sending it back at that point with our flight or fight instincts on overdrive for nourishment. Tried to pay our bill but couldn't find our sever. Def tested my patience in front of my gf's sister who I was meeting for the first time. Hopefully not the last after this horrendous meal. \n\nMy advice: skip this place and checkout the nearby other restaurant options instead. This place needs to step up its game. Not worth the time or money unless you want to leave disappointed.", "author": "Sung P."}

When cafes opened on Belden Alley and began serving dinner al fresco I was mystified.  This was the same alley that housed dumpsters full of restaurant waste all day and down which I'd seen rats routinely darting.  Cafe Claude opened on another alley, Claude Lane, and I felt similarly though I'll admit to enjoying a post-work drink there now and then.  \n\nIt'd been years since my last visit but on this evening I walked here from the new MOMA with friends in tow who knew not where we were headed.  What still looked like sort of an abysmally dark alley was seen through their fresh eyes as we ventured down the lane.  Then, stepping into Cafe Claude we were greeted in a way that helped overcome any reticence I might have been wrestling with.  \n\nAll eyes in my party lit with joy when we entered to a trio of jazz musicians (sultry femme singer included) in Cafe Claude's entry.  It seemed as though we'd stumbled into a very well-known (to others) secret and it felt both romantic and very special.  Remember this place if those are the feelings you're going for.  \n\nNo one was sitting outside and it still looked less than appealing to me.  Indoors, however, was packed.  Two tight rooms full of diners enjoying French bistro fare and wine with musical accompaniment.  Ooh la la, tres chic.    \n\nDespite what was an overly long wait between first course and entree (and for which no explanation was given), the food and service here were good, enhanced by the ambiance.  I enjoyed traditional Soupe A L'Oignon ($11) and a Salade with Lardons.  The Steak Frites ($28) wasn't best in class but it was still good and worked well in this environment.  Others at my table had Trout Amandine ($25) and Coq Au Vin ($24) and registered satisfaction.    \n\nDespite falling off my radar the fact that Cafe Claude is still packing them into the FiDi on a weekend night says something for the appeal of their offering.  Be certain to visit on a night with live jazz (Thursday - Saturday, 7 - 10 p.m.) as it'll smooth over any minor flaws and deliver what I'll now call a perfect ambiance.  \n\nIn a dark San Francisco alley.  Who knew?\n\n*  Other stuff:  $1 oysters and $6 cocktails + bites (poutine anyone?) available during HH.  This might just be Cafe Claude's sweet spot.", "author": "Tracey A."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-12-18", "description": "ALLEY WAY RESTAURANT\n\nOne of the advantages of working in the Financial District in SF is that you can eat at several interesting places nearby your work. Even though most of the eateries are chain restaurants. What I noticed is that there are quite a few French eateries around the Financial District. There is one that is about 2 blocks away from my work - Caf\u00e9 Claude.\n\nI ate at Caf\u00e9 Claude two Thursdays ago for lunch. I previewed the menu. The item I intended to order was the bavette steak with bone marrow butter as that butter sounded very tasty. For dessert one item that looked appealing was the cr\u00e8me brulee made with tahitian vanilla. As an art history major one of the artists I studied was Post-Impressionist artist Paul Gauguin who visited Tahiti. That was the reason why I thought of ordering the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e8e. When I got to the restaurant the poulet roti got my interest because it came with foie gras bread pudding. Then I pondered that if I ordered the bavette steak I can order a foie gras appetizer, which was foie gras po\u00eale on toasted brioche. I did take my time to order. That resulted in cutting my lunch time and I decided not to order the cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e8e for dessert. Instead of buying two items - the bavette steak and foie gras - I decided to order the poulet roti that came with the foie gras bread pudding. I also decided to order the pomme frites.\n\nThe poulet roti was half chicken as you get the breast with the drumette portion of the chicken wing and the leg quarters. The sign of a good roasted chicken is if the breast is moist. The breast of the roast chicken was moist. I liked the bread pudding as you can taste the melted foie gras inside it. Overall I like when foie gras is the focus of the dish as you can really taste the foie gras. The fries, which cost $8, were ok. However something was missing about the meal. At first I couldn't figure why. Then I remember Thomas Keller stating how he loves to cook food to invoke memories. The last time I ordered a roast chicken with a side order of fries was when I ate at Bouchon in Yountville four years ago. The roast chicken at Bouchon was one of the best I ever had because of the crispy skin and moist meat of the breast. The fries, which cost $7, were plentiful and crispy. The meal at Bouchon was the best combination of roast chicken and fries I ever had. That might seem harsh to compare a Michelin star restaurant with a caf\u00e9 but most of all it's about the value you pay for the meal. I felt that the fries at Caf\u00e9 Claude weren't up to par as they cost $7. Due to my lunch at Caf\u00e9 Claude I felt the rating I gave was valid given the price I paid for my meal.", "author": "Gerald R."}

We just had 5pm dinner at this very French restaurant which is located up an ally. We liked the menu so our concierge made 5pm reservations for us. Dining early is great cuz you can walk around Union Square after a 2 hr meal while it's still light out during the summer. To start we had a California and French Chardonnay. We prefer the oaky buttery texture of most California chards so my second glass was of the Napa varietal. Whenever I go French, I always have to have the silky texture of foie gras; this was terrine style thus it didn't look like a liver! The house salad was the best I've had. I chose the duck over chicken; it was ok as the inside was a little dry but crunchy it was on the outside. My wife had the trout which was smothered with green beans. I think I need more coaching on French cuisine as I need to appreciate the different preparations. For dessert, we shared a soft chocolate cake which most Hawaii residence know as Roy's chocolate souffl\u00e9. It was outstanding. Their latte paired beautifully with the chocolate cake.

Steak tartare was quite bland (not salty or peppery, nor tasting of meat, really), although the steak was decently fresh. Got the creme brulee as a dessert and the sugared crust on top was the perfect thickness, although the portion size is definitely sufficient for two.\n\nLast time I had the coq au vin and it was just okay. \n\nI definitely think that if you are to come here, sitting inside would be a much more enjoyable experience than the tables they have in the alleyway, given that it is less cold, windy, and that they have live jazz inside!\n\n2.5 stars for me, but I'm sure I'll be back again with coworkers.", "author": "Nicole H."}

The baguette was tougher than I'd like and served cold, but this is normal in French cuisine (I guess French people must have strong teeth)\n\nRegular menu entree:\n$22 Confit de canard (crispy duck leg confit, lentils, fris\u00e9e, chopped egg): The duck itself was delicious and distinctively roasty though a bit dry; at the end of the day I prefer the juicy duck breast from Absinthe. The spicy lentils did stand out and reminded me a bit of Moroccan food. Overall I was content because this dish turned out filling with the well portioned duck and the side of lentils.\n\n$40 Prix fixe:\n\n1. Alsatian tarte flambee (puff pastry, caramelized onions, creme fraiche, bacon lardons): Mmm buttery flakey puff pastry! The sweet caramelized onions, luscious creme fraiche, and hammy bacon were excellent toppings, all outstanding on their own and balanced in flavor and texture by the endives. Curiously, it's built like a taco and looks like a taco, but way fancy.\n\n2. Carbonnade flamande (Flemish beer-braised beef, pearl onions, winter root vegetable puree): Frankly I was disappointed with the portion size, but if you eat it reeeeaaaaallllllllyy sloowwwwwwwwlllyyyyyy and mindfully appreciate the nuances, you will be more satisfied because you will notice the culinary finesse going into this dish (and also because it will last longer and feel less small). The beef is so tender, you could probably sneak it into someone's juice cleanse without them noticing\n\n3. Choux aux chantilly (almond profiteroles, vanilla bean cream, orange gastrique): Tasty and a nice sweet dessert at the end of the meal, but nothing too special and it's somewhat difficult to taste the almonds and the orange. (FYI gastrique is a sweet and sour sauce, not gastric acid as I had been thinking)\n\n(Word of caution: the lighting outdoors may not have the best layout. Boo was seated under the lamp so cast a shadow over the table and complained in exasperation that it was difficult to see what he was eating!)\n\nAs some reviewers pointed out, service can be a tad bit slower than what you're used to in the hustle and bustle in-and-out of SF--Cafe Claude is good for relaxing over a French cafe experience that is authentic even in the laid-back vibe. Presentation may not be the most photogenic either, but this is not a trendy place like State Bird. Don't worry too much about documenting your food on Instagram; instead, soak up the ambiance in its entirety, and don't be in a rush if you can help it! \n\nCafe Claude is quite neat when it comes to the details. Everything is branded with the restaurant logo reminiscent of the Tour d'Eiffel (the menu, the check, even the little piece of paper covering the butter). And the overall setting somehow pulls of casual romantic: classy with the live jazz, unpretentious with the splendid but basic outdoor patio seating under an awning, and quintessentially Parisian in its quaint location tucked into an alleyway.

But man oh man, my lunch here yesterday was a complete disappointment from start to finish. \n\nSo here's our experience went down...\n- I booked our 12:30pm table via Yelp Reservations first thing in the morning. I received a few text message confirmations. Everything seemed all set for our party of 4. However, when we arrived at 12:30 on the dot, the frazzled hostess had difficulty locating our resy. I'm not sure if she ever did find our reservation in the system, but she decided to seat us outside on their patio. Now keep in mind, it was raining and cold this particular day. Sitting outside in a FiDi alleyway wasn't exactly ideal (especially when we saw vacant tables inside). Alas, we found a table under a heat lamp and decided to make the best of things. \n- It took about 10 minutes before a server greeted our table and took our drink order. And then it took another 15 minutes for those drinks to arrive and for us to then place our food order.\n- I ordered the Croque Monsieur with mixed green salad (a French bistro staple). My co-workers ordered bowls of the Lentil Soup, and our business client ordered the mussels.  We also got an order of the pommes frittes for the table to share. Long story short, the food took quite a while to arrive. My Croque Monsieur tasted like it had been sitting out for a while. And the salad that came with it had a dressing that was so salty that I finally gave up after a few bites. My co-workers felt that the lentil soup was fine (albeit watery in texture) but not exactly memorable. The mussels seemed to be a hit with our one lunch buddy. But the fries were lukewarm and soggy. \n- Our over-worked server was friendly, but she would disappear for long patches of time. And we finally had to hail down the hostess to order espresso + dessert and someone to bus our table. \n- My co-worker ordered a non-fat latte. After waiting 10 minutes (and after everyone had already received their coffee and espressos), she was then notified by our server that they don't have non-fat milk. And the best part was when they told her \"We don't serve non-fat lattes because we're a French restaurant.\" Um... ok? Then why did you accept her order in the first place? And correct me if i'm wrong, but you're a French bistro in San Francisco (one of the biggest coffee meccas in the world). \n- Lastly, we had to remind our server about the slice of chocolate cake we had ordered for dessert. They finally brought it out 5 minutes after our bill arrived.\n\nSo to recap... after an hour and a half, we finally received our check ($180 - after tax + tip). \n$180 for five mediocre, lukewarm dishes; pretty much non-existent service (even though the restaurant wasn't full), and we had to sit outside in the cold. Good thing no one at the table ordered wine or cocktails, otherwise the bill would have been much higher. \n\nThe last thing I want to do is disparage a business (I fully understand how hard it is to operate a busy restaurant). But management needs to be aware of when things aren't working. Believe me, I want to give Cafe Claude another chance... but it's going to be a while before I forget this underwhelming lunch experience.", "author": "Kevin B."}

The interior is pretty small, but the booth seating makes it more comfy and cozy. It seems like most of the seating is made up of the covered seating out front. Dining outdoors in Claude Lane is almost a nod to the sidewalk cafes in France, while the dim lighting inside is a more intimate setting. On weekends, there is live music that lightly emanates in the background. Even better, they sometimes have 1000-pt. Opentable reservations.\nMr. Joy & I were taking in the ambience when certain details felt familiar and I realized I had been here before. Has anyone else ever had a deja vu dining experience? Anyway...\n\nWe started with fresh bread wrapped in newsprint with butter filled to the brim of a ramekin. So many delicious things on the menu. Between the mussels, duck confit, & coq au vin, I had a hard time choosing.\n\n$14 Steak Tartare - hand chopped raw flank steak, quail egg, mustard, cornichons, capers, shallots, parsley, croutons:\nThe tartare was prepared tableside, but the tables were too close together. Our server's mixing station was out of my line of vision, so I couldn't really see what was going on. The end result revealed a smooth and creamy steak tartare. The accompanying ingredients were easy to pick out and had a mild tartness, but weren't too strong and didn't overpower the steak. The thin, buttery slices of baked baguette were thin, crunchy vessels for the tartare.\n\n$28 Steak Frites - bone marrow butter, peppercorn bordelaise sauce, pommes frites:\nThe flank steak was a small portion, but it was still pretty juicy for a lean cut of beef, especially with the bordelaise sauce. The bone marrow butter, surprisingly, was green. Mr. Joy, the fry connoisseur, also said the frites were very good - crispy and seasoned well with herbs.\n\n$24 Coq au Vin - mary's chicken, bacon, mushrooms, onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrot, red wine sauce:\nClaude makes coq au vin just how I like it. It was served in a cast-iron dish, which helped keep it warm throughout the meal. The chicken was super juicy and falling off the bone. Next to the chicken, the cipollini onions are my favorite part. They just taste taste so sweet and juicy. Their red wine sauce, surprisingly, was rather light in color. It still had the savory, tart, and buttery notes of a red wine sauce though. The consistency is not very thick, but I prefer the sauce to be not too heavy. Like some coq au vin dishes that I've tried in France, it tastes like chicken sitting in a rich broth as opposed to a thick sauce. The only thing minor thing I would have changed was they could have cut the carrots smaller so it would have been easier to eat.\n\nWe left with satisfied taste buds and full bellies after realizing we had consumed a nearly all meat meal. Well, as true carnivores, it wasn't all that surprising. Service was as delightful as the food. Our server was very sweet & friendly, and spoke with an enviable French accent. I'd definitely come back for a repeat experience, or for happy hour when they offer $1 oysters, croque sandwiches, and affordable cocktails.", "author": "Joy W."}

I find that many restaurants that only have one vegetarian dish, often have a bland offering. That was not the case here. The dish was cooked perfectly, and was flavorful.\nIn all, it was a very nice experience, and I look forward to returning soon.", "author": "Rayleen W."}

I had originally planned to bring my date to Gitane to see if we could get a table right away, but were unable to. We then decide to walk around for a bit while waiting for a table to open up over there, only to find ourselves at Cafe Claude 10 feet later. The live jazz music that was playing really influenced our decision to dine here instead, and I, for one, am glad we did. \n\nWe shared a plate of foie gras po\u00eal\u00e9, and for our individual dishes, I ordered a coq au vin.\n\nFoie gras po\u00eal\u00e9 - Translates to \"pan-fried foie gras\". Once you get past the fried exterior of the liver, it absolutely melts in your mouth with a savory finish. There are candied peaches and small bits of bread accompanying the dish, I recommend you pairing them together. The sweetness of the peaches mingles with the lightly smoky, savory taste of the foie gras, resulting in a sultry tango of flavors that prep you for more. Or in our case, the next dishes. \n\nCoq au vin - Mary's chicken, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrot, and the ever-so-divine red wine sauce. The chicken was moist, fell off the bone, and tasted delicious. As much as the other toppings were good, it got kind of annoying fishing for them since they were small enough to make it difficult to pick up with a fork. Small veggies aside, I still enjoyed this dish immensely, mostly because of that sauce. Even after I finished everything, I tried to lap it up with pieces of bread. \n\nNote to self: Never underestimate the power of live jazz music to heighten the dining experience. \n\nCafe Claude has redeemed themselves in my eyes, but maybe I'll just play it safe and come back for dinner only in the future.", "author": "Viet N."}

Located in an intimate alley in between the busy streets of San Francisco, it's a romantic and cozy setting for lunch or dinner.  It makes you feel like you really are in a bistro in Paris. \n\nToday we had a late lunch and everyone except me ordered the Croque Madame.  I had the quiche Lorraine.  Very cheesy, tasty and rich with a side of greens to make it healthy :).   The croque Madame looked buttery and cheesy and even better with the egg on top.  of course we had to have a couple of orders of fries since there were five of us total.   \n\nMy only negative with this visit was the service or lack there of.  It took the server quite a while after we were all seated to ask us for our drink order.  She passed by a few times tending to the other table but not even a look or glance over our way to acknowledge us.  This really bothers me, especially since we did have a party of five.  After the order was take , she never came back to refill our waters or ask if we needed more to drink.   Maybe it was bad timing or she was having a bad day.

We were seated in the vestibule area that's in the alley, has a very Euro feel to it and I imagine on nicer days has potential to transport you off the continent.  \n\nService was great, helpful without being intrusive.  We ordered a glass of wine and the steak tartare (large) to start.  I LOVE steak tartare.  The meat was fresh and of great quality.  I could have eaten another order of it and left extremely happy.  We also ordered the Ratatouille soup which was blended.  If it didn't have dairy in it, I would have eaten more of it.  The few spoonfuls I took were really wonderful.\n\nOn to the entrees I ordered steak frites rare and N got fish, I think it was trout.  We both left very satisfied but I think I got the better end of the deal as my steak had bone marrow butter on it.  I'm quite the carnivore.  Portion sizes are spot on, we both left satisfied but not overly full and no one had to roll us out of there.  We also ordered dessert of creme brulee' and I decided it's vacation and since we were headed straight back to the hotel, the creme brulee' would be worth the discomfort.  It had the perfect silky texture and sweet without being cloying.  The calories here were certainly worth it.  \n\nI did feel a little uncomfortable in my PNW attire, self imposed but places like these deserve a little bit of an upgrade and not hiking clothes.

Like a place has to be reviewed by you before it can be validated. Sheesh. But really, I can't believe I've never Yelped Cafe Claude before. After all, I used to come here with my co-workers after work constantly in the '90's. They had live music. They still do. Why did I stop coming? Ennui? Quel dommage. Anyway, I came back for lunch with a couple of colleagues, and it was quite nice and not at all crowded. Pardonnez-moi, Claude.\n\nEven though Gaspar Brasserie is more elaborate, Cafe Claude is still the most authentic feeling French bistro in the FiDi although both are owned by Franck LeClerc. Strolling on Claude Lane may stir memories of the back alleys of Montmartre in Paris. As if I knew. However, I've seen a Truffaut film and an episode of Rick Steves' Paris series, so that must make me a Francophile par excellence. The menu is classic bistro fare with no exceptions. We first started off with the $14 Salade D'\u00e9t\u00e9, a lovely melange of heirloom tomatoes and lemon cucumbers with herb oil, tomato coulis, and crispy shallots (photo: http://bit.ly/1KiPgqg). Yes, that was indeed an idyllic taste of summer. One of my colleagues went for the Salade Ni\u00e7oise, which was presented in classic fashion.\n\nUnlike the perfunctory presentation I received at the Honey Bistro, the tuna confit was piled high on the lettuce, along with the haricots verts, olives, potatoes, capers and anchovies with the hard-boiled eggs decoratively placed on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1LBoVkz). My $20 Moules Frites came next, and the pile of mussels were flavored pungently with a garlic confit, shallots, white wine, dijon, and saffron (photo: http://bit.ly/1NFcaZu). My one minor complaint was that there could have been a few more, even for lunch, but the pomme frites were perfectly crisped and seasoned and placed in a rumpled faux-newspaper (photo: http://bit.ly/1i947aj), the same as the sliced crusty baguette (photo: http://bit.ly/1Eov7N2). I should probably wear a beret and smoke those little French cigarettes next time I come.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...classic bistro fare doesn't disappoint\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...closest I'll get to Paris for a while\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...mostly attentive, they should speak with Maurice Chevalier accents\nTOTAL - 4 stars...wish I had not waited so long to return as it is still a jewel", "author": "Ed U."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-06-28", "description": "After reading some reviews and reviewing the menu online, I was so excited to visit Cafe Claude for lunch. I'm in SF for a week and I fully expected to fall in love and eat there every day for the rest of my visit. Unfortunately, I was disappointed from the moment I walked in the door.\n\nI arrived at 1:35 for a 1:45 lunch reservation. The hostess met me at the door and the first thing out of her mouth was \"Do you have a reservation?\" (Note: it was obviously the end of lunch time with several open tables inside the small dining room and the remaining diners clearly reaching the end of their meals). When I told her I had a 1:45 reservation she pointed out that I was 10 minutes early and they had not turned over my table yet. She asked if I wanted to sit outside instead, which I did not. She directed me to wait at the bar and handed me a cocktail menu and wine list to peruse while I waited.\n\nAfter maybe five minutes the hostess informed me my table was ready and brought me to the worst table in the dining room - a two top at the end of the banquette with a large column on one side. It was such a tight corner that the chair for a second diner was at a 90 degree angle to the banquette instead of across from it and about 25% of the table was actually pushed up to/in front of the corner column. I squeezed my way between the tables to sit on the banquette where I basically had no room to use my left arm and sat with my left hand in my lap the whole time. There was a four top table next to me with two older ladies at it and on the other side of them were two open tables.\n\nAfter a couple more minutes my server came over and just said \"We have a soup of the day, it's beef and vegetable.\" and then just looked at me. I asked for sparkling water with lime. She may have given a quick nod and then walked away.\n\nSeveral minutes later (and with no water) the server returned and literally said \"Are you ready to go?\" I asked about my water and she explained that she has to wait for the bartender to get the bottle for her. There had been no one at the bar since before I entered the restaurant, so I'm not sure what the hold up was. I ordered the salade maison to start and the steak frites medium rare with a side of aioli.\n\nA few minutes later the hostess who originally sat me came over with my bottle of sparking water and a glass - but no lime. A couple minutes after that my salad arrived.\n\nThe salad was very good - the champagne vinaigrette was just right and the lettuce was fresh - and I really enjoyed it. When I was finished my server cleared my plate and left a steak knife but left my fork (I kind of expected a clean fork for each course).\n\nSteak frites showed up and, no surprise, no side of aioli. After a couple of minutes my server noticed I had received my food and remembered I had asked for aioli, which she then brought over. It was orange, so I asked what it was seasoned with and she told me it was harissa. Seems a little odd for a French place and I really didn't care for the flavor with the frites, but my only other options were ketchup or spicy mustard. The steak and marrow butter were very good and cooked perfectly, but I seem to have been missing the port-shallot sauce.\n\nAdditionally, there did not appear to be any bread offered during lunch. If a place is going to advertise themselves as \"A virtual European vacation tucked in the heart of San Francisco's financial district near Union Square, this charming French restaurant provides a Paris fix via \"tr\u00e8s d\u00e9licieux\" cuisine, exquisite service and lovely Left Bank atmosphere.\" I kind of expect to have some baguette and butter.\n\nTo summarize, the food was quite good but the service I received was a huge let-down and I will not be going back. I really expected more when I was spending $40 plus tax and tip on lunch for one. Tr\u00e8s triste.", "author": "Andie T."}

They label themselves as a cafe but they are more of a full service restaurant . We stopped here for a late lunch after visiting the newly opened SF MOMA . We were starving and the waitress ushered us in quickly and offered us a table of our choice. The decor and ambiance is reminiscent  of what a french cafe like ...tables are closer together, as are chairs, creating a more intimate and 'bustly 'feel ... especially during busy times. The waitress quickly went over the specials and offered assistance with the choices that  we eventually made. \n\nWe ordered the carrot soup and the waitress continually had to remind us that there was no cream in the soup. It was absolutely wonderful. it had a fattiness and creaminess that was unbelievable especially considering that it was just vegetables and broth. The soup was an apt metaphor for food made well; how just a few ingredients expertly tweaked can create magic! \n\nWe also had escargot as an appetizer and the server made sure we had good hunks of crusty baguettes to sop up all that precious butter. Escargot too were excellent. Everyone at the table decided on the croque madame and in each instance the sunny side up egg provided an excellent sauce for the sandwich. I would have liked some bitter micro-greens on my plate, just to counterbalance the unctuous salty, creamy (yet crisp on some bites) flavor, but that was the only little flaw. \n\nOverall an excellent quick bistro stop with little complaints.", "author": "Umar G."}

It wasn't really needed on a Sunday but I figured to be safe.\n\nWe got seated promptly.  \n\nWe were alone in a corner by the window, which was cool.  But also next to the bar and it seems this place is popular for their bar?  You had some folks just there for drinks so we were accompanied with a small little rowdy group of men right next to us for the first half of our dinner (one wearing jeans a few sizes too small and with crack showing...not the Restaurant's fault, but not my favorite view).\n\nWe decided to share the following:\n\nFrench Onion Soup: Tasty!  It was good.  Not sure if I would say this is the best I've ever had but it was good.  Gave a great amount to share, generous on the cheese.  I liked it.\n\nSteak Tartare (large...which equates to 5oz versus 3oz with the price difference for $17 versus $14): I mean this was raved upon on Yelp so I had to try.  A server came, asked for how we liked it (spicy please...which appeared to be a few more dollops of Tabasco).  It was fresh.  I enjoyed this dish.\n\nHouse Pate Assortment:  duck rillettes, chicken liver mousse, pork campange.  My favorite was the chicken liver mousse.  So good.  It also had some mustard, grape thing.  Tasty.\n\nSteak Frites: Bavette steak, bone marrow butter, port-shallot sauce, pommes frites.  Sadly, can't say this blew my mind.  I was also surprised with the steak as I'm used to the thin steaks and this was a smaller but thicker cut.  They cooked it well, but this dish didn't remind me of France.\n\nService was nice and courteous.  Sitting in there in the dim lighting with the rain outside reminded us of our honeymoon so it was a nice dining experience.\n\nPrices were reasonable.\n\nI might return here again.", "author": "Kim D."}

The roommate was working on vday, so I decided we should have dinner last Tuesday to make up for it. I've been craving French onion soup and Cafe Claude is close to work, so it seemed perfect!\n\n*Dusty road: bourbon, benedictine, dry vermouth ($12)\nNice and light. Not as boozy as I thought it'd be, but a good starter cocktail to ease me into the evening.\n\n*Escargots en croute: garlic butter, parsley, pernod, shallots, anchovy, puff pastry ($12)\nWhere was the butter sauce in this? I love dipping bread into each little groove and getting all the parsley butter, but there wasn't much there. And not much garlicky flavor either.\n\n*Cabernet sauvignon: 2011 medlock ames, alexander valley ($14 glass)\nGood glass of wine. Nice and full bodied.\n\n*Moules: mussels, shallots, garlic, white wine pistou ($11)\nI thought the sauce would be better. It didn't have much garlic flavor. I just tasted a lot of white wine and shallots.\n\n*Salade maison: little gem lettuce, shallots, herbs, sherry vinaigrette ($10)\nGood, but some bites were super salty!\n\n*Soupe a l'oignon: onion soup gratinee, emmental cheese, baguette croutons ($11)\nEh, just your average onion soup. Needed salt and pepper to balance the sweetness of the onions.\n\n*Coq au vin: mary's chicken, bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrots, red wine sauce ($24)\nOkay, so this was a good chicken dish. But if you call something coq au vin, it should have some red wine flavor. I couldn't really find much.\n\n*Steak frites: new york steak, bone marrow butter, peppercorn bordelaise, pommes frites ($28)\nSo I ordered my steak rare. But this came out blue. It was still raw in the middle! I was already full by this course, so I didn't really care. And we were bringing it home for the roommate to reheat and eat later, so I didn't say anything.\n\n*Creme brulee: made with tahitian vanilla ($8)\nNice crusty top, but super runny for a creme brulee. I liked the flavor though.\n\nThe service, however, was excellent. Our waitress was super friendly and accommodating. She coursed everything so we'd have a nicely paced dinner.

Despite making reservations via Yelp and showing the hostess our confirmation email, she had trouble finding us on their iPad. After the first hiccup, the hostess proceeded to take us to their outside area despite there being 6 open tables inside. Hubby wasn't dressed too warmly because we expected to be indoors all day, so I asked the hostess if we could be seated inside. \n\nShe refused, saying that those tables were reserved for customers who had reserved before us, back in October. So we are treated like second class citizens because we didn't make reservation earlier? I had never heard of such a thing. Note to owner/management: if you are going to have a policy like this, kindly state it on your website that only people who reserved early get to eat inside! Or renovate the outside dining area so that customers don't feel like they are eating in the gutter freezing their butts off! In fact, while we were eating, an elderly lady near us tripped. Somehow, Cafe Claude thought it was smart to cover the curb of the sidewalk/step with a rug that made it a tripping hazard. \n\nClearly the outside area is a big issue seeing from many other yelp complaints. I just wish I had read them before making a reservation. \n\nAnyway, the food was alright. I had the duck confit and hubby had the daube de buoef.

I love that it is tucked away in a little lane (glamorous word for alley, I expect), so its away from the hubbub of  FiDi. \n\nI'm glad our reservations were for inside since despite heat lamps and the plastic coverings, the patio was still a little chilly. The restaurant itself is quite small - so much so that once you are in the foyer you are basically at the bar. We were seated right away and nestled into our table and decided to order off the regular menu since the Restaurant Week menu was not as appealing to us. Our waitress, who seemed bonafide French, was super sweet. We ordered steak tartare (the larger portion), French onion soup to start, both had the coq au vin entree, and finished with the chocolate mousse. The steak tartare was prepared table side and we were able to request it mild. I loved watching the assembly, though I wish we were able to see it more closely; that was hindered by the space and also that it may not have meant to be a spectacle. The tartare was super fresh and had great flavor! I don't usually like French onion soup but this one was stellar and had a special umami most of them do not. My coq au vin was fall off the bone and a large portion, but was the first time I could remember that I needed to put salt on a dish at a restaurant. I was dismayed they don't offer souffle, but we had the chocolate mousse that came with a vanilla bean cream and wafer cookie that was the perfect ending. The mousse was more reminiscent of a pot de creme than a fluffy mousse in case you were expecting the ones with lots of holes. \n\nWe were lucky enough to come on Saturday - a day they have live jazz during dinner! The ambiance, warm staff, and mellow music really made for a delightful evening. Pre-tip the bill was around $100 for two which was agreeable for the experience.

Finally had to ask that font of all wisdom, my phone.\n\nI had requested outdoor seating. At first I was on a table right under a heater, but after the run felt too hot. The very nice waiter moved me, but within a few minutes I felt cold, as the outdoor area is in shade & wind. I did not want to ask to be moved again, so figured I'd just manage. Maybe next time come early when it's not crowded & sit indoors.\n\nOK, food! I got the Sparkles in the Sky, Salade de Chevre Chaud, Confit de Canard, and Creme Brulee. A bit of confusion over water, asked if I wanted water I said yes, then another person said do I want still or sparkling, I said sparkling. Ended up with a glass of regular water and a carafe of sparkling.\n\nBasically - everything was good. Cocktail, very good, slightly sweet but not overwhelming, mild enough so it did not knock me over, very pretty shade of lavender! Salad, excellent, don't know what they put in dressing but it was really good, loved the pecans. Goat cheese spread on brioche croutons. Practically a meal, in fact, pretty close to what I eat for lunch when I prepare my own, although fancier. Loved duck; when I see duck on a menu I rarely order anything else. The duck was falling off bone, crisp skin, not at all fatty. Liked the lentils and big pieces of bacon (is that what they were? A smoked pork of some kind). The creme brulee had a good thin crust, and was rich and creamy, although a tad lacking in vanilla flavor.\n\nI ordered a pot of tea to have with entree. Next mishap. The hot water comes in a metal pot and it's heavy (tempted to say Heavy Metal!). The pot has a narrow base and flared sides, so it's not just heavy, it's top heavy. The ground outside is not level and the pot toppled right over, spilling hot water everywhere. Fortunately it did not get in my food or on me, but my two magazines got very wet. I later had to carefully unstick the pages. The waiter very promptly and without being asked came to the rescue, moved everything to a new table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-10-19", "description": "When visiting San Francisco, it can be a real challenge finding an ideal French restaurant that blends romantic, intimate, and classy. With that said and done, \"Cafe Claude\" offers everything you're looking for in a cozy and ambient atmosphere. And surprisingly, for a city that has an endless list of award-winning restaurants, finding somewhere to dine was trickier than I had anticipated.\n\nLocated directly in the heart of the Financial District and only a few blocks from Union Square, \"Cafe Claude\" is actually tucked on an alley way. Parking in this part of town can be very scarce any day of the week so its best to use public transportation or take a cab. However, on a Saturday evening around 7:30pm, I was able to score a parking spot less than 2 blocks away which doesn't happen very often in downtown San Francisco.\n\nI come here with my fianc\u00e9e, Claudia as I had already made reservations (via-Open Table) prior to arrival. As expected, the restaurant was bustling with hungry customers inside and out. And when I say out, there is a large area where people are seated outside; I'd have to say that I am not entirely thrilled by it as it takes away a lot of the charm of the restaurant. Fortunately, we were seated inside and placed directly in the middle of the restaurant.\n\nThe overall interior is as French and European as you can get.  Everything from the decor to the French artwork placed on the walls, this place truly feels as if you're dining in Paris. Keep in mind that the inside is relatively small so don't be discouraged if you happen to eavesdrop in your neighbors conversations. One thing that had me sold on dining here is that \"Cafe Claude\" offers live jazz music Wednesday through Sunday. This was one of the major reasons what inspired me to dine here as French cuisine and jazz music go hand in hand.\n\nAs we were seated, our waitress explains some of the specialties of what they're offering. Now I don't like to criticize but her French accent was a bit hard at times to understand but fortunately I was able to pick up most of the words. We brought a bottle of our red wine where they will charge a $20.00 corkage fee. As an appetizer, we decided on splitting their \"Ch\u00e8vre\" (for $14.00). This was a salad that consisted of baby lettuce, warm goat cheese, toasted levain, apples, candied walnuts, and drizzled with cider vinegar. Our salad comes out within 5 minutes and is complemented with a French baguette.\n\nAs far as our main entrees, I decide on ordering the \"Coq Au Vin\" (for $24.00). This meal is a free-range chicken that includes bacon, mushrooms, pearl onions, fingerling potatoes, roasted carrots, and red wine sauce. My fianc\u00e9e decided on the \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" (for $23.00). Her dish is a complete roasted half chicken paired up with seasonal greens, Ni\u00e7oise olives (which were omitted from her dish by request), rosemary, and lemon. Both of our dishes arrived within 20 minutes.\n\nAt first glance, the servings that are offered at \"Cafe Claude\" are very generous. You definitely get your moneys worth as the entire presentation was simple yet effective. I was pleasantly surprised with the how tasty my \"Coq Au Vin\" was. The red wine sauce had a zesty flavor that complimented well with the tender pieces of chicken. It also had a unique homemade taste that is not found at a classy French restaurant and something that I would enjoy at my mom's house. I also tried some of my fianc\u00e9es \"Poulet R\u00f4ti\" as this was extremely tasty. The chicken was very moist as it had the perfect amount of lemon and rosemary that balanced out the dish very well.\n\nSince we still had a little room left for dessert, we decided on going the safe route in ordering their \"Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" and 2 glasses of champagne to go with it. That hit the spot as it had the perfect amount of crust on top with the creamy filling underneath. Overall, if you're looking for an above average French restaurant in San Francisco, \"Cafe Claude\" is a restaurant worth checking out. Was it the best I've had? No, but it was very good and you won't be disappointed.", "author": "Donovan H."}

We saw there were two tables in a window area so we asked if we could be seated there and she said it was not possible as they were reserved. We were seated in a booth and spent two hours there and during all two hours no one was seated in the window area we requested. My husband ordered a chicken dish and I the duck. Both were over cooked, dry and salty. We ordered Duck liver as a starter and were served a thing like duck liverwurst. The wine I ordered was $17 per glass and tasted like it was a box wine. My husbands Vodka Cran was made with a  low end vodka. All in all not a place I would visit again,  Bad service and food !", "author": "August C."}

I had to ask 3 times for lemon for my water. Annoying. I asked for olive oil and balsamic for the bread and I got olive oil but no balsamic. If you don't have it, just say so.

I noticed the alley Cafe Claude is in yesterday when I was walking over to Le Central for lunch - see review - and I stopped to take a peek at the place and the menu. With another business lunch coming up today, I thought I'd give it a shot, and I am glad I did.\n\nThere is outside seating in the alley, which is a plus on a sunny San Francisco day, although I decided to sit inside today. The decor is really reminiscent of a French bistro/brasserie, from the paint color on the walls, to the furniture and furnishings, to the white jacketed waitstaff. Bread arrived in a little basket lined with faux newspaper paper, and the baguette crust was just right. The menu is typical French ware, what you would expect in a brasserie. My guest head the Nicoise salad, which I did not taste but looked good, and she was happy with it. I had the Croque Madam - your grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a sunny side up egg on top - to be eaten with fork and knife, comes with greens.\n\nI will come back - and even consider it a dinner spot with a romantic interest - for more, as everything on the menu looks scrumptious", "author": "Massimo M."}

The sweet and savory raisins and capers play made the dish interesting, went well with the buttered haricot and trout.  I also asked for a side salad ($10) which consisted of a small plate of bib lettuce and a few slivers of radish, dusted by chopped tarragon.  The lettuce was fresh but plain.  Honestly, for the same price, I would opt for the entree sized, also overpriced salad from across the street at Mixt.  My coworker ordered the Steak Frites ($23), medium rare.

However, on a vacation to SF, we decided to try this place on a whim after our reservations fell through at Chez Panisse thanks to a 90-minute delay on BART (I'm really, terribly sorry that your city has to deal with such an egregious transit system...but I'll Yelp review them later....)\n\nThe portions were good for the price and I enjoyed my dish, the coq au vin, which was chicken, bacon, veggies in a red wine sauce. She got the tuna ni\u00e7oise and wasn't as impressed - not that it was necessarily bad, but the tuna was quite salty. The service was excellent - our waitress was quick to take care of us 110%. For anyone who enjoys French food, I'd recommend this place. It's casual but not too casual and the food is decent and it won't entirely break the bank.", "author": "Josh E."}

Need I say more but good food so you decide lol\n\nUpdate: laughed so hard we cried at how comically bad this was. Good thing I had great company. \n\nPost Dinner Thoughts: Arrived at 8:44pm for an 8:45pm reservation so I was feeling pretty good about it. Hostess told us it would be just a few minutes... as at least 5-10 other couples showed up to be told it would be\"just another minute\".\n\n15 minutes later we were seated, so things were looking up. Right off the bat, we ordered two glasses of champagne and two cocktails, ready to celebrate our Valentine's Day night. I would say at least 15 more mins went by before our champagne glasses were served. We then ordered our two identical 4 course prix fixe menu items with the wine pairing. 10 mins later our first cocktail order and 4 small (very small) pieces of bread came.\n\nA good 25 mins later our first wine pairing came out, and another 5 our first course. Great pairing with fairly delicious soup.\n\nOur second wine pairings came out about 15 mins after the first dish was cleared, but this time I'd say we had to wait about another 15 mins before our second food course arrived... \n\nThen 10 mins after our second course was cleared, our third course arrived!! This seems like great news, except that what's the point of a wine pairing if it isn't delivered with/before your food?? Another 10 minutes were spent alerting someone and waiting for our wine to be delivered. Once it was though, the food was delicious.\n\nLastly, and most hilariously, we were offered coffee which we accepted. Our waiter then came over holding the bill and asked us if we would like anything else... Maybe our fourth course prix fix dessert??? It ended up being absolutely delicious but come ON my girlfriend literally laughed until she cried because as realistic as she is, this was just ridiculous!!!!!!\n\nTl;dr: good food, good wine pairing, not worth $300+.

VERY DISAPPOINTED.\n\nWith the new addition of a 2nd dining area at Cafe Claude, all the asian couples were seated in this newly added area. If you were asian, you were seated in this part of the restaurant. Even if only part of the couple was asian, they were still seated in this area. The girlfriend and I thought this was weird. I personally thought that this was very, VERY uncool. Being as this is the bay area and San Francisco especially. I'm still shaking my head at this establishment. To ensure that was possibly an accident, the girlfriend and I decided to leave through the back of the of this dining area so that we would walk through the other part of the restaurant; and to my disappointment, there was not one asian person seated in the main dining area at Cafe Claude. This is FUCKED UP!\n\nNow on to the dining experience.\n\nAs I made reservations 2 days prior, and arriving 15mins late (thanks bay bridge traffic) we were seated right away in the new dining area. When we checked in at the main part of Cafe Claude, only 25% of the tables in the main dining area were filled, so as to why the hostess chose to seat us in the secondary dining area, I have no fucking idea why.\n\nOur server was cordial, polite, and informative. She was professional and a terrific reflection upon the establishment. The wait for our food was the exact opposite. We and the tables around us waited about 45-55 minutes for our mains dishes. How do we know, we spoke with our surrounding tables. One couple joked and said \"we thought the long wait was because they didn't like us\". We noticed how the men were constantly looking at their watches as they waited for their dishes. We noticed how the women looked around for the server to bring their mains. Mind you the restaurant was NOT packed. This was the day before Valentine's day. I can only imagine that the wait would possibly be doubled. Maybe if you were NON-ASIAN, your food might be served to you faster.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers. The escargot and foie gras. Those took about 20 minutes until there were served. For our mains we ordered the bavette and coq au vin which took about 50mins. 50 minutes, seriously. For dessert we ordered some type of chocolate cake and coffee. That took 10mins.\n\nWe arrived at 6pm. We left at 8:50pm. Over 2 and a half hours for 2 appetizers, 2 mains and 1 dessert. If it wasn't for the glasses of wine we ordered and the wonderful company of my girlfriend, this dining experience definitely could have been a very, very disappointing night.\n\nIf you are asian, I advise you to dine else where as there are so many other wonderful places to eat in San Francisco. And when you go dine there, ensure that the restaurant does not segregate you to one section as Cafe Claude.\n\nOnce again, I am very disappointed with this establishment and will not dine here again.", "author": "Paul U."}

The restaurant looks like an authentic Parisian bistro, which is nice. The tables are a little too close together, like in France though.\n\nService was friendly & pretty good. The French servers kept on refilling our waters without us ever asking. We never had to wait too long between the appetizers, entree & dessert. \n\nMy husband ordered the soup of the day: carrot & orange. Pretty good but average. Nothing too amazing. \n\nHe then had the Steak Frites. I'm from France and I told him, as he ordered, that Steak Frites is really just Beef & Fries. It may sound fancier in French but it's a very simple dish (a good one if it's well made, sure) that you can eat in many other kinds of restaurants! \nIn my opinion, you don't have to go to a French restaurant to have Beef & Fries so my advice to you is to get something French that you won't eat elsewhere: like the Confit de Canard, or Foie gras- unless you're vegan. If so, you unfortunately don't have many options in French restaurants except the sides maybe.\n\nI had the salmon served medium rare. That's how I like my salmon. It was a little bit more than medium rare but still moist and good. The potatoes served on the side were again very average & some were undercooked. There was nothing that made this dish stand out from other salmon dishes you'll eat in other restaurants. I definitely won't remember this salmon.\n\nFor dessert, we split a moelleux au chocolat. While it was good, it could have had a more liquid center. Fruits on the side would have been nice as well. It was a bit boring and so was its presentation. Maybe we're just boring in France ;-)\n\nWe had a good time but we probably will not return even if we did appreciate the staff's professionalism & the decor of the restaurant.", "author": "Leslie S."}

That was probably one of the only things that was hard for me to figure out about this place.

We had to pass a few small outside tables before getting to the main door where we were greeted by a lovely young woman who quickly escorted us to our table. I really have to say that the ambiance was fantastic. The entire restaurant was on the smaller side and dimly lit which made it very intimate and romantic. My fianc\u00e9e and I had taken our seats and immediately were introduced to our waiter.

This time however, the establishment has made a loyal fan out of me, and next time I'm in Union Square, this will be my place for French fare. A big plus for the ambience.

There was a genuine French family at one of the outside tables (I don't think they were paid extras!) which was reassuring.\n\nThe bill for 4 of us (drinks, deserts, coffee and a bottle of Sancerre) was $350 including the $60 tip. Very reasonable for San Francisco - and cheaper than flying to France for the night.\n\nFor a picky vegetarian this was the best meal I've eaten out in ages.

For lunch, I purchased one of their pasta lunch time specials for $25 dollars (with tax + tip the total was $30). Paying about $30 for lunch is ridiculous--especially when the ingredients to make this dish are less expensive in the grocery store. However, I gave Cafe Claude the benefit of doubt and thought the food would justify the exorbitant price--it didn't. \n\nThe box of fettuccine alfredo with pea sauce, lima beans, and shrimp was swamped with an oily and bland pea sauce. The shrimp were dime-sized, and of skimpy portions in the pasta. There were only eight pieces of dime-sized shrimp in a box of about two and a half cups of pasta. Cafe Claude made sure the pasta lunch box was packed with lima beans that were under cooked and tough to chew. As a result, I ended up throwing away the lunch. It was just too nasty and messy to eat. Now, I understand why people avoid lunch time specials. Cafe Claude is not worth the hassle or hype.", "author": "Sarita S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-02", "description": "Let me preface my review by saying that Cafe Claude has been our favorite restaurant in San Francisco since 2009.  Seriously, we were their #1 fans.  We live in Portland and a trip to Cafe Claude is always highly anticipated.  The food was always fantastic, reasonably priced, great service and a fun atmosphere.  We tell everyone to go there...\n\nThat being said, I am sad that I have to reduce my rating from 5 stars (I would have given it 10 stars in 2009) to 4.  They always treat us very well---our service was great again last night.  However, if I was rating the food only, I would reduce the rating to a 3.  I'm not sure what has happened, but the food has really diminished.  When I was reading through the reviews last week I was startled to see that there were several negative ones.  I figured they must be wrong.  Nope.\n\nThe escargot was delicious.  I was reasonably happy with the coq au vin.  I thought it was flavored well and tender. I am very sensitive to salt and did not think it was overly salty as others have said.   I would order it again.  My husband and son both ordered the duck confit.  The duck was tender, moist and full of flavor.  It was the plate itself that failed.  The lentils were terrible---dry and totally tasteless.  The frisee wasn't much better.  The duck could have been improved with a light port sauce or any type of sauce to accompany.  The duck would pair much better with a mashed potato, hash or a light pasta.  My husband commented that he felt the food had just been dumped on his plate with no caring.  \n\nAs always, the service was very nice.  We visited for our combined birthday/anniversary dinner and the manager brought us complimentary champagne.  Our server brought us a delicious chocolate mousse for dessert. VERY NICE touches and much appreciated!!!  Our waiter, who is French, was also outstanding.  The great service is why I am giving a 4 instead of a 3 for the restaurant overall.\n\nThis review is hard for me to write because we have been such big fans.  On our first and subsequent trips we would moan in pleasure with every bite we took.  This time, we were making excuses to each other to justify the food...\"They must have a new chef, must have someone new in the kitchen, it's still good, just not great, my coq au vin is pretty good....\"  It's not good when one goes there.  We just wanted to love it as we normally do.  We also heard the lady at the next table complaining about a corn cake and some others stating that it's not as good as it used to be.  The restaurant was not as full as it once was.  It used to be packed.  We had late reservations, so that could be why.  Or, it could be that word is getting out that it's just not as good anymore.  I hope Cafe Claude is listening and takes the words of their devoted customers to heart.  I would hate to see this once-wonderful place go out of business.\n\nOverall rating 4 due to the great service,  Food alone 3.  :(  Please work on fixing this so I can return Cafe Claude to my Favorite Restaurant in San Francisco!  We are returning in October and hope to see great improvements!  Also, my YELP profile asks where I want to eat my last meal on earth.  It has said Cafe Claude since 2009!  I don't want to change it, but at this point...", "author": "Deb P."}

Don't expect to be able to see jazz bands perform because they play in the corner, in an isolated area from all seats.\n\nOn food (4 stars): \nWe (a party of two) got steak frites and Coq au Vin. The steak was cooked to medium rare with really nice Bordelaise sauce. The fries were a little too salty, and honestly were not anything impressive. If someone told me the fries were from McDonald's, I would not have known. Coq au Vin was on the generous side in portion size, and the broth/sauce had bold, really savory flavors. The chicken was tender (fell off the bones!), and the garnishes (chestnuts and potatoes mostly) were nice. \n\nFor dessert, we got Paris Brest. The waitress described the dish as a fluffy bagel with creme, and yeah, that's what it was. I would have liked more blackberry sauce to go with the chou. It was very light and refreshing, and I'd recommend it for people who don't want to get heavy desserts.                  \n\n\nOn service (2 stars): \nFirst of all, I arrived a little early (about 15 minutes) and I wasn't offered a drink for 10 minutes, just sitting there. I asked the waitress about their Grenache blend - because I wanted to know if it was Grenache-Syrah blend (I love those), and she had to ask the bartender before coming back. There aren't many wines on the \"by the glass\" list and I would have expected her to be more knowledgeable.  \n\n*** Update: I used to have a rant here about how the restaurant gave me a little note about how \"Our international guests often ask about tipping.\" and that continued to suggest a 15-20% tip. I was offended because I (now I realize wrongfully) interpreted that the restaurant assumed some things about me because my party was all Asian. The manager of the restaurant messaged me and (apologetically) explained that the Cafe actually gives the little note to every table, in which case, I understand. (I still don't quite get why the restaurant would choose such a potentially offensive practice, but maybe they'd figure it out.)", "author": "Wonhee P."}

But they found me a table right away, without reservations.\n\nI was seated next to a table with what I thought at first was a \"power couple\" that was meeting up for lunch squeezed in between their busy schedules wearing their best fancy business attire.  But couldn't help but laugh inside at their conversation as it evolved. He was single, she was recently divorced. She was totally into him.  He was clueless.  She was talking negatively about her ex-husband and dropping all sorts of hints for him to pick up and guide him.  He was focused on the food and had conversational vocabulary heavily reliant upon the words \"yum\" and \"tasty.\"  She kept escalating her hints until she finally got through to him by the time of my main course by being rather direct.  They did end up working out the details to meet at his place after work once he got clued in to her desires.  Oy....Lunchtime drama.\n\nIn any case, on to the food.  They brought a nice baguette with excellent butter.  A good start for a bistro!

The steak was served with a classic Bordelaise sauce that was velvety and intense in flavour.  The steak was cooked perfectly medium rare towards the rarer side, as I prefer.  It was very tender and well seasoned.  They had clearly rested it well before slicing as it was extremely juicy. The fries were standard fare with a little herb dusting.

It is located in an ally along with several other eating establishments.  We  made a reservations (which I recommend) via Open Table and that went without a hitch.

A birthday event would probably not be as appropriate if you have more than 10 people. \n\nThe best part, and exactly the reason why we came here, was for the live Jazz music. The band is fantastic but the down side is, you don't really get to see them throughout dinner since they are crammed in a tiny corner next to the bar at the entrance of the restaurant. Also, the band (consisted of 3 individual) takes frequent breaks throughout the night (or at least when I was there) so don't expect live music for the entire course of dinner. \n\nAs for the food, it was fabulous. We started off with the famous Escargot, which was our first time trying it by the way, and although it was rich, it was indeed fantastic. It was definitely a decadent start for the night, but fortunately, our main courses of two different types of fishes wasn't too heavy. We opted for the special of the night, Monk Fish with kale and potatoes and a lobster sauce, and for me, the Arctic Char with veggies on the side. The veggies honestly, was amazing, and to me, even better than the char, but that's probably because I am a natural veggie lover. Both fish dishes were cooked extremely well and very well flavored. The monk fish was a very interesting texture, more chewy and tough than normal fishes like trout or cod, but the different twist made it enjoyable. \n\nNow, for the grand finale, was the JAW DROPPING CREME BR\u00dbL\u00c9E. OH-EM-GEE this creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e was hands down the best we have ever had.

We were seated, were given menus, and twiddled our thumbs as we waited to place our orders and as the restaurant itself still seemed to be waking up. I mentioned some $5 off deal that popped up when I checked into the restaurant via FourSquare and was given a brush-off by the hostess as the discount was never addressed afterwards. Who cares about $5, but why the heck is it even on the app?? \n\nSo, we placed our orders and were somewhat disappointed by the lack of nonalcoholic beverages. The bread came out and we were left to eat it with our hands and no appetizer plates (the server placed it down and speed-walked away from the table). Snail forks were provided before the escargot came out (and the server again disappeared) so we had to signal for someone to come so that we could even ask for appetizer plates. The escargot was incredibly delicious and piping hot -- if a snail fan, I would highly recommend it. Whatever it was baked in tasted excellent over the bread. \n\nOur sandwiches subsequently came out and the ingredients were really fresh. The sandwiches were good but nothing amazing (I had the house-cured beef and my companion had the chicken). The fries however were quite delicious. We also opted for a dessert afterwards and the apple tart was good but again nothing to write home about. at. all.\n\nThe overall experience was disappointing as I had higher expectations for Cafe Claude. The prices were moderate for the quality and quantity of food.

Delectable to the extreme! Nearly as delicious was a dish my date and I shared: the escargot plate, which was buttered and served with garlic and puff pastries.\n\nThough we were only there for brunch, we kept hearing about The Mondo Trio. Apparently during many evenings, Caf\u00e9 Claude hosts live jazz performances from groups such as them (who were scheduled for later that day) regularly!\n\nWe had been walking for awhile that morning to find a decent restaurant for brunch.

The service was very good though became less attentive as the dining room filled.  The noise level also increased pretty dramatically from our early seating to prime dinner time when we were paying.

We received medium rare steaks that were closer to black and blue -- one got sent back and the replacement was not good and remained uneaten.  The fries were very good.  The cut of steak was not great though for the price it was to be expected.  We also tried the house salad where the most prominent flavor was salt.  The swordfish was very good with excellent flavor and balance.  For dessert we all ordered the moelleux au chocolat.  The concept here is exactly the same as one of our all time favorite desserts, molten chocolate cake with creme anglaise.

We were a little skeptical with almost no one in the restaurant on a weekend, but it slowly filled up.

The wait for food wasn't too long, but the bread they served while we waited was very dry, cold and hard (at least heat it up a bit, no?), and the appetizer salad I chose had large leafy greens that were DRENCHED in dressing. I choked on the dressing about 4 times while trying to eat it before giving up (the vinegar was kind of burning my throat). My friend got the soup and it tasted decent, a lot of cheese if you like that. At this point we're very disappointed in the restaurant. The quiche I chose was decent, it smells like Asian egg tarts and had bacon and eggs in it, tasty. And the salad that came with the quiche was much better, not overdressed or too large to try to eat in one bite. The cookie dessert to go was also really hard, but edible. \n\nAll in all, I think the entrees here may be worth trying, but their \"restaurant week\" menu is not impressive.

Yet they try hard to bring you cuisine similar to what you'd find in Paris run if the mill bistro.  Pate and cheese are all edible but it's not that original umami taste originating from aging fine ingredients. You just taste the salt.  Nothing more.  We ordered others including steak tar tar, firies and steak. And a couple others. All bad tasting and all salt soup. Stay away from the food. \n\nThe seats are arranged too closely together and the place is super loud.  Nothing cozy about this place. And they are not that comfortable. \n\nThe waitress who served us got the \"fleece the fine residents of SF con scheme down to science.\"   We ordered regular plain water.  She said no problem. We have Evian and that is our plain water.  I said fine but I don't want to pay for water.  She again says that is the plain water we offer and charges us $7 anyway.  \n\nI wish I can say something nice for the wine selection but French wine sucks compared to CA cabs. Actually, French cuisine ,unless a modern chef infused it with additional taste pallet, pretty much is cheese, grease, baguette and SALT.  No wonder Parisians are always ticked off at something.  You eat bad food and you'll be pissed enough to cause a revolution or conspire with the Italians and Spaniards to steal spice from the orient. Yuk.  Stay away.", "author": "Allen K."}

Unfortunately this place was just an average, 3 star for me! The location is sort of hidden, but apprantly really noticeable with all the reviews. \n\nThe menu had appealing options that I had difficulty choosing from, but I settled on their open faced sandwich \"Croque Madame\". It was basically a sandwich with ham, cheese, some kind of creamy sauce, and an egg on top. It was really good, don't get me wrong, but I just wasn't amazed by it. I felt like the quality of food was equivalent to a regular restaurant, not how a fancy restaurant should be. There was so much freaking cheese and creamy sauce it made the dish feel really heavy. There was a salad to balance it out, but it wasn't enough. \n\nAs an appetizer, we got the patte. The bread was good, but not addicting like some place I have been to. The patte was okay.

Fail on you Yelp. \nAfter my last experience here on Valentine's Day which wasn't great (read below) cafe Claude asked us to come back for a complimentary dinner. So we did, and it was GREAT. We'll be back yet again, and I'll once again update my review from a 2 to a 4 star rating.. I guess I'm very easily persuaded.. (Used to be 5 stars but .. Baby steps) \n______\n\n\nI hate leaving this review because I have been to Cafe Claude maybe 30 times in the last 6 years. It's been one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco but in the last year it has gone down hill terribly.\n\nThe last straw on the camels back was last nights dinner, Valentine's Day 2016- $75 3 course + amuse bouche -prefix menu- all reservations, should be pretty easy to prep for one would think. \n\nWe got there at 8:45 for our 9pm reservation and was told our table would be ready at 9. We grabbed a drink at the bar ... Then another one..and at 10pm we were finally seated. We were given menus but no one came to take our order from the very limited prefix menu for another 40 minutes. We ordered but was told they were out our choice of first course (truffle soup) but instead they had a delicious carrot soup we should try, so I said that was fine.. 20 minutes more go by before someone brought us a breadbasket with the hardest, most stale bread I've ever had, anywhere.. We had to give up as you couldn't actually chew through it.. So we continued to wait until finally they brought out our \"carrot soup\" or .. Last minute carrot water.. It really was- clearly a Hail Mary they threw together after realizing they didn't have enough of the \"good appetizer\" - it was terrible and we sent it back and told them so. Then at this point we also told them they still hasn't brought us our amuse bouche .. Which, as far as I'm aware goes before the first course? They then came running out with that, and due to our frustration over the carrot juice they even brought us a beet+goat cheese salad which was delicious. We got the remaining courses in a \"steady pace\" there after which were all .. So so.. Nothing too exciting.. Except the pork main which came with a sauce full of Wazabi that would randomly just punch you in the face every other bite.. After all was said and done, it was 12:30. 3.5 hours spent waiting for nothing. The manager came over and apologized and said they had comped all our wine for the evening but still left us with a $175 bill for the food, which honestly- they shouldn't have charged anyone for that evening - it was a joke.\n\nWhile we were sitting waiting we were looking around at other couples at the other tables.. And it seems everyone was just looking around at each other in frustration.. Did they forget about us? What's going on here? Is this a joke.. ? If this had been a 2nd or 3rd date, 3.5 hours could have been the ultimate challenge.. I can only imagine.. \n\nI feel bad for cafe Claude.. It used to be magical.", "author": "Adam O."}

Although the atmosphere and live music was nice, overall I was disappointed with the food and service here. \n\nUpon stepping in to the restaurant, we waited about 3 minutes before we were greeted by the hostess. She was on the phone during the whole time and we weren't sure if we should wait for her to help us or get someone else's attention, since she clearly saw us but didn't give any signal that she would be with us shortly. So, it was awkward for those few minutes when we didn't know what to do.\n\nOur server was nice and friendly.\n\nThe pate trio, for $18, was pretty underwhelming. Of the three varieties, only the duck liver was good while the other two were just off. What disappointed me most was the week-old bread that came with this dish; it was dry, tough, and a downgraded for this dish as a whole.\n\nThe steak tartare was also a disappointment. The staff would make it on front of you as part of the presentation. She asked how spicy we would like it to be, so I said \"medium\" which to her means literally one drop of tobacco sauce on a large order. There was no spice, no kick, and no flavor. We probably ate less than half the dish.\n\nThe Frisee salad was fine.\n\nThe pork chop was probably one of the redeeming dishes on their menu. The meat was cooked nicely and it was tender and juicy. But all the stuff that came with the dish were just okay and did not really complement the dish.\n\nWe enjoyed the live music.", "author": "Al B."}

After having lunch at the Ferry building, me and a group of my friends were walking around the area and we stumbled upon Cafe Claude and thought this might be a nice place for some coffee and dessert. The outside area where we wanted to sit was COMPLETELY empty (see picture), so we went in and asked if we could be seated outside. The hostess or waitress told us they were busy and could not accommodate 4 for dessert only, we would have to get lunch. While this would be totally acceptable if they were actually swamped, her attitude and the fact that there was NO ONE outside pissed me off enough to write this review.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-12-23", "description": "Words cannot describe how much I love Cafe Claude. I'll try to do it justice to the best of my abilities!\n\nI came for a lovely evening dinner with my girlfriend. We had agreed to shake things up and make things fancy. Following Google Maps, we were directed into a shady little alleyway tucked away within the vast SF urban landscape. But shady it was not! Quite the opposite...it was packed with a decent handful of restaurants, with loads of outdoor seating.\n\nUpon entering Cafe Claude, we were whisked away into a very charming French restaurant with an amazing ambiance. The dim lighting, the incredibly talented jazz band, the intimate seating (esp. for two)...it was all very romantic.\n\nWe were seating right away, early even, at a table in the corner of the restaurant. Our server came by immediately, and was very helpful and polite. She provided some excellent cocktail recommendations, and attended to our every need. She even brought out what looked like a giant nail filer to whisk away the crumbs off the table after our meal and having finished the bread. (Sad to say, I just might be uncultured, seeing as I've never encountered a restaurant that does this. Completely mind-blown when I saw this.)\n\nMy girlfriend ordered the Confit de Canard, while I opted for the Porc. For cocktails, my girlfriend ordered the Hummingbird, while I got the Vieux Carre. For desert, we ordered the Creme Brulee.\n\nThe Confit de Canard was well cooked and still moist. A solid dish, with a solid duck flavor. The meat complimented really well with the lentils and greens.\n\nThe Porc was amazing! Cooked medium, and placed on top of a delicious stew of sweet potato, cabbage, and other goodies, I was completely satisfied with my dish. The meet was really tender, cooked to perfection, and still quite moist.\n\n**Amusing fact** - as the waiter brought us our food, he exclaimed: \"watch out, the plates are hot.\" Oh indeed they were, sir!! Quite a surprise to see Cafe Claude doesn't warm up their plates, but heats them to a very high temp - excellent to keep the food warm throughout the meal!\n\nBack to the review~\n\nOur cocktails were really good. The Hummingbird - a mixture of St. Germain Elderflower liquer, sparkling wine, soda water, and fresh lemon juice - was well made, and the perfect light cocktail for my girlfriend. A solid recommendation by our amazing waitress.\n\nMy Vieux Carre - a combination of cognac, rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and bitters - was also a solid drink, touched with a slice of orange rind. In comparison to another vieux carre I've had at a fancy SF speakeasy, I'd say this probably takes the cake. Rather than the dry taste you get from some vodka or gin drinks, this had a really heavy, flavored taste from start to finish. It also went well with the Porc dish.\n\nTo round things up, the dessert tasted great! Their creme brulee was really smooth, compounded with an intense vanilla flavor, and a nicely caramelized crust on top. My girlfriend and I were left wanting more afterwards, but after all the food, we were both quite full towards the end.\n\nOverall, an amazing dining experience. A very romantic/intimate place to bring that special someone for any special occasion, or if you're just in the mood for something different. Enjoy the food, enjoy the music, and just immerse yourself in this delightful French restaurant! Cafe Claude is a must if you ever find yourself in San Francisco!", "author": "Kevin J."}

This was a little bland for me. \n    sauternes mousse - goose liver marinated in sauternes wine. When I had my first bite of this, I immediately thought of my dear friend Manda Bear B. Sauternes always make me think of her. Actually, wine makes me think of her. She's so fabulous! \nMy only gripe with the pate is that I wish they gave us more crostinis. 3 girls, 3 pates, and only like pieces? COME ON!\n\nsteak tartare (larger order, $17) - hand chopped raw flank steak, quail egg, mustard, cornichons, capers, shallots, parsley, croutons. I am a huge fan of steak tartare. It is probably one of my favorite dishes. Cafe Claude mixes the tartare tableside. Extremely fresh! The flank steak is of outstanding quality. Great bite to it, yet still fatty.

Still, Cafe Claude has got a pretty good hold on steak tartare.\n\ntruit amandine - farm raised trout, sliced almonds, pole beans, sauce meuniere. Trout amandine can get screwed up royally.

Everything was fresh, and delivered at the perfect temperature.  \n\nSo why did I give this a 1 star?\n\nYou can have the best meal in the world, but if you don't feel welcome by the establishment, is it really worth dealing with snobbery?  I mean, it started with our waitress basically just 'getting by' with her serving of us.  And I observed her attention and constant conversation to the people on both sides of us.  Mind you, I used to wait tables for 7 years, and I watch Restaurant Stakeout, so I'm very keen on this.\n\nBut to make matters worse, the manager, Haley, completely ignored our table, and would give the best customer service to the couple on each side of us.. She literally prepared food, chatted with them, gave one guy a glass of wine on the house, and we didn't receive a single complement.  Funny thing is that she's judging a book by its cover when the reality is, I'm having the most impact on Haley's career.\n\nSo to all of you reading the reviews, you can use your best judgement when dealing with this.. The food is great, but there is a ton of other restaurants in San Francisco that are amazing and you won't feel unwelcome and ignored by the staff if you are wearing Tshirts with your company name on it.\n\np.s .The only reason I knew her name is because I asked another waiter.  And I'm never coming back.", "author": "Kory A."}

We were told we would have to wait until the dishwasher wash able to wash some. So we waited. After quite a long wait the assistant arrived with some glasses used for white wine. When I questioned her on this she said they only had 10 glasses even though the table next to use had a party of 6 all drinking from the larger red wine glasses. My point is that we were treated like 2nd class citizens from the moment we arrived with our own bottle of wine. I will never go back, especially for a special occasion.

Recommend reading if you have food allergies. \n\nCame here yesterday for lunch with a best friend and her newly acquired husband celebrating their exchange vows only about an hour before. We were a large party who ordered either the flat iron steak or trout for our main course (apps we had were fine).  All was going fine until not even 3 minutes into eating our main course that my friend's son began complaining about a stinging/tingling tongue and itching around his mouth. He was having an allergic reaction! Shit! Wait...he's allergic to fish SO he ordered steak.  Well after back and forth questions with the wait staff and the manager to investigate how he could be having this allergic reaction it was finally discovered that they cooked the steak and fish on the SAME flat top. Next to each other! Juices from both cross contaminating the other!! It's NOT a grill, but a flat top! \n\nIn all, the staff/manager mishandled the situation to the point of no longer having anyone in our party as return visitors and some have been many times before. The manager was more concerned about whether we had informed the waitress about the food allergy and she did not report to the kitchen properly. How about \"Are you ok?\", \"How do you feel?\", \"Do you need medication, a doctor?\" Then what we were told was that we should have informed her.  Again...he ordered steak so why the hell would he need to report any food allergy to pesce! Also, another excuse the manager gave us was that it is also a small kitchen \"SO!!, you're filthy!,\" is what I would have liked to respond but we are cordial people. Kitchens can be pretty gross to begin with, but I can only imagine what else goes on back there. Ughhh. \n\nOh by the way, he is a sous chef at an upscale restaurant in the area (was never mentioned); he just kept kindly asking to speak with the chef to better understanding what was going on. For how politely he dealt with the situation he should have been treated with far more hospitality. Far more. Just disgraceful in my opinion. \n\nIn the end, he was never offered another dish and we had to ask them to remove it from the final check. Not sure if they apologized? They were just kind of insincere and unaccommodating. This type of shit would not fly back east. Just keeping it real. \n\nSide Note: As a New Yorker, I cherish the NYC Department of Health's Restaurant Inspection Results grading system because of shit like what happened at this place. What happened here was elementary food handling/prep course stuff that I'm sure every member of Claude's had to take. It sucks he had a reaction and luckily I had benadryl to share with him, but I just keep thinking \"Shit, thank god no one ordered chicken!\"  I suffer from crazy food allergies and chicken is one of them; I go into anaphylaxic shock immediately. Hence, the arsenal of benadryl and my epi-pen which is always on me.", "author": "Dee S."}

I've only had it once before and I'm not a huge fan of butter/really rich food so please keep that in mind.  I'm also not too much a fan of the texture.  With that said, I felt like all I tasted was butter and parsley.  The texture was a little too chewy for my taste.

Anyways, I thought the steak and fries were pretty standard/nothing out of the ordinary.  The coq au vin was a little too rich/not enough variance in flavors and honestly, the chicken was dry.

The arugula was fine but didn't really match well. \n\nFortunately the server was very considerate and removed the appetizer and moved us on to the main course. I had the flat iron Steak Frites. And my boyfriend had the Coq Au Vin. My steak was cooked perfectly and I thoroughly enjoyed the Bordelaise Sauce. I tried to scoop up every bit of sauce with the fries. The slice of herb butter that they put on top of it was ok but I wish it would have been melted on top as opposed to just sitting cold on the steak. My BF liked his chicken but said it wasn't anything amazing.\n\nWhen offered dessert we thought \"why not?\" So we got the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. I also got a cappuccino, which was amazing. I dunked the little dark chocolate they gave us to make it a slightly more sugar blasted sweet sip. When we tried the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e it was pretty good. It tasted a little too milky and you could tell that the custard hadn't hardened quite enough to be ready for br\u00fbl\u00e9e. Oh well I still liked it. \n\nWe did have to wait quite a while for our check. The manager/hostess? said that she had to do a tar tar service which slowed here down. One would think that she would help out and bring the check for the server? \n\nI don't think I'd come back to Claude. It was just ok. I did, however, thoroughly enjoy the live jazz band.

Maybe it's because I'm comparing them to Jeanne D'Arc (I went to try their restaurant week menu not too long ago and their food was just fantastic), but the menu was not very impressive in general. First course was the toast with smoked salmon and beets. The salmon was fishy and the bread (pumpernickel) was over powering. The salad was bitter and the braised pork was just too heavily garlic. By the time I finished half of the plate, I was getting really sick of it. Chard also had a really weird texture, like I was chewing on soil. The gnocchi was the only tasty item on that plate. The final course was the creme  brulee. The sugar coating was too thick but the bottom was cold. Why in the world would I want to pay 40 dollars for this emsemble of food? I know that restaurant week meal is provided at a discount but this was....just..like they didn't even want to put any effort in it.\n\nNot worth the money.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-30", "description": "I'm giving it an \"okay.\" The atmosphere was charming though a bit empty feeling. However, as we went at an \"off hour\" not lunch/not drinks/not dinner time, it made sense. We had a comfy seat in the window (the alley outside was deserted however, so, not much people watching or amusement out the window) Service was fine, not too much or too little; it was just right. My personal preference actually, so service would get a 5/5. Thought the hurried comings and going of the bus people, with staggering stacks of dishes didn't really add to the charm though. \nThe \"kid\" wanted to try escargot, so escargot she got. Had never tried them before, and they must have been great as she ate every last one. If you are fan of these, I have to suppose these would be 5/5? Personally, they haven't invented the drug that would make them (even butter, garlic, and puff pastry aside ...) make me want to try them. Perhaps starvation might work? Though I'd more likely resort to cannibalism if push came to plane crash. Hopefully, I won't find out anytime soon.  The crusty French bread dipped in the tasty butter leavings was delish. \n\nI ordered a glass of Chardonnay but (as in too many of my reviews I think)  felt I needed to call for a measuring cup to justify the meagerness of the pour. I also noted that it was infinitely less than chilled, and closer to room temp. My imagination said it was as if it were the dregs of that particular bottle? So, not quite enough to serve, but far too much to toss or to justify opening an extra bottle over? Well, picky-picky me. \n\nSo I had the salad Nicoise and was rather disappointed. The tuna was of some tinned variety - a bit too salty, a bit too oily (It may not be \"classic,\" but I've grown used to and fond of the charred on the outside and raw in the middle slice of ahi these days when they say \"tuna\" ) and the potatoes also seemed \"tinned.\" So salad: 2/5 ? \nThe kid had the quiche, which was surprisingly brown considering how almost runny the interior was. Tasty, but 3/5 is the best I could say. \nWould I go again? Possibly - the charm is undeniable. But I'd pick a better time, a better day, pay for corkage and order something other than the salad Nicoise for sure.", "author": "Mrs. R."}

There were at least 1-2 other restaurants/ bars in the alley.\n\nWe were pleasantly surprised when I walked into the restaurant because it was a completely different world from the dark alley!

Blame it on the Bordeaux.\n\nThis place oozes with romance. I really don't see how you could have a bad date tucked into one of Claude's sumptuous corners, sipping a flowery rose, and being serenaded by some smooth jazz and your waiter's sexy Uruguayan accent (hola Enrique!) God, I wanted to hide under the table and stay here for days...years, maybe. It is that special.\n\nThe food is classic bistro fare - you know, the glamorous artery-cloggers we travel to Paris for: steak tartar, soupe \u00e0 l'oignon, coq au vin, truffle mousse. And of course, those prettily-named wines that make us feel so fancy. Enrique poured me a tempting line-up of samples before I settled on the crisp Macon-Villages. And then...my life felt suddenly complete.\n\nThe service is impeccably classy, with foreign accents galore - French is definitely the dominant force here, in the food, the attitude, and the sensual mood of the place. Although I dined here with a girlfriend, the date-y feel of it wasn't weird. In fact, it was a great spot for a leisurely girls night. The waiters really know how to lay the charm on THICK. Sigh...\n\nWe were in such a daze of delight when we left that I forgot to grab my gigantic purse (truly, impossible to miss) and when we were blocks away, nearly at the BART station, Enrique came running around the corner calling \"excuse me! excuse me!\" in that darling Latin-tinged tongue, and graciously handed over my forgotten goods. My hero. \n\nI cannot wait to escape to Claude again. If I loved it this much on a Wednesday night, it must be unbearably wonderfully on one of their live jazz evenings (Thurs-Sun).

Its very difficult to turn down the double portion for $3 more and it was not a regretted decision to go for the full dish. We also had the p\u00e2t\u00e9 platter which was just as good. The martinis before dinner were also very well made.\n\nFor mains we had the lamb shank, which was a Saturday special, and truite amandine. It was extremely tender and had an amazing sauce. The trout had a great flavor combination of sweet savory from the raisins and sauce. Everything was classic French cooking and didn't disappoint at all.\n\nThe wait staff was competent and friendly. We didn't have any issues all evening. However, the couple next to us accidentally had their two orders of lamb brought to them before their appetizer. When the waiter was informed he apologized, took their entrees and rushed an order for their appetizers and after they finished that brought two more orders of their lamb. The staff handled their situation extremely well.\n\nThe decor of the restaurant is very pleasant but some of the tables are fairly close together and make it difficult to relax during dinner.", "author": "Michael S."}

Food, service, and ambiance are all above par; and while their food is not always impeccable and perfect, I never had a bad dining experience there. Cafe Claude is easily one of the most consistent restaurants in San Francisco.\n\nThe past two months I had dinner there three times, with visitors from out of town on each occasion. Their soup and salad portions tend to be less generous. Frisee aux Lardons is delicious, with nueske's bacon. I usually have the Soup du Jour since the onion soup, which both my guests savored, is too heavy for my stomach. Soup of the day can be a carrot soup served cold.\n\nAssiette de 3 Pates include country style pork, chicken liver and truffles, and goose liver marinated in sauternes wine. We all agreed that the black pepper slightly overpowers the pork flavor. Goose liver found favor across the table and was the first pate consumed in whole. Chicken and truffles also went well together.\n\nPlats ordered: Angus hanger steak was prepared medium rare up to the liking of my guest from Hong Kong, who is actually French. The cider brined pork tenderloin is just perfect with the roasted apple in mustard-tarragon-cognac jus. I can't help helping myself from my friend's plate.  Coq Au Vin is a safe choice if you like chicken. Mine came with two drumsticks and a thigh cooked in red wine, mushrooms and bacon. \n\nThe meal was brought to a final note with the flourless chocolate cake, the chocolate mousse, and the tarte aux pommes. Skip the dessert wines since they aren't very special, and the portion is smaller than a prosecco.\n\nDinner for 2 with two drinks each: $165 with tips\nDinner for 3 with a bottle of red and dessert wine: $269", "author": "Matt Y."}

Knowing of the French places near the French Consulte, I focussed there. I'm a former resident of France and appreciate the food tremendously.\n\nUnfortunately, there were so many negative reviews of so many of the places, including Cafe Claude, I just set it aside in desperation, figuring we'd just walk around and pick a place based on a pretty full restaurant (actual attendance speaks louder than reviews). Coincidentally, my wife's hairdresser just a block away highly recommended Claude, so we went.\n\nSuperb. Except for them serving bread and butter (unsalted--so I have zero idea of what all the \"too salty\" reviews are talking about) before the meal for American expectations, it was totally authentic. To wit:\n\n1. The veal sweetbreads were divine. I saw a veganesque review that actually complained about the name. Uh, how do you respond to that kind of utter ignorance? They were succulent, essentially natural meatballs in a preparation that allowed them to stand largely on their own.\n\n2. The Steak Tartare was precisely French. Hand chopped steak like I do at home (it's not hamburger folks) and even in the \"spicy\" configuration I asked for, it's French spicy, which means more of the provincial herbs and spices, not hot, not salty, not peppery.\n\n3. They know how to serve a whiskey: ice cubes on the side.\n\n4. The Onion soup was actually FRENCH onion soup and not AMERICAN onion soup so many of the ignorant, negative reviews complain about. See, French onion soup is not served such that it burns your mouth (French serve all food not extremely hot nor cold--except ice cream--because you get more flavor when food is in a smaller range from room temp, warm or cool). Nor is FRENCH onion soup thickened with corn or potato starch to make it \"hearty.\" It's a near demi-glace beef broth made from roasting bones & marrow, boiling them for a long time, letting the broth reduce and concentrate flavor, then introducing onions. Many French really don't even eat the croutons or much of the cheese, because it's never a meal. It's all about the oniony flavor of a light beefy broth.\n\n5. They had a lamb shank special and it was perfect. So Frenchy.\n\nIn all, a perfect meal where I left invigorated, massaged with flavor, pampered with good service and made the drive back to San Jose without the slightest hint of comatose remorse after so many American styled meals of excess.\n\nGood job.", "author": "Richard N."}

The meal totaled $130 (quite a nice date dinner) which included two soft drinks, three appetizers, two entrees, and a split dessert... Me and my girlfriend can eat! \n\nWe had the French onion soup (I would say 5/5 stars, very flavorful and umami-licious), the beet and goat cheese salad (I would rank this as 4/5 based on the sheer uniqueness of the house blended cheese!), the moules frites (4/5, very cleaned and well prepared mussels in the traditional French way, and the sauce was fine). For entrees, I had the steak-frites and she had the coq au vin. I would give my steak a 3.5/5 due to a vein of gristle that had been left in the somewhat tough meat, but the demi-glaze, the marrow coumpound butter, and french fry accompaniment were the three highlights of the meal for me. Amazing, though I am a bit of a French-fry-fiend (who isn't?). The coq au vin was 4.5/5, several notes of flavor and the meat was moist, dark meat. The dish cried for something to balance out constant flavor of the sauce-we used the delicious baguette. The dessert was the classic creme brulee, 4/5. Nothing special, but consistent and good. Less eggy and more velvety custard.\n\nOverall the meal was nice. Our service was great throughout the night and we left stuffed and happy.", "author": "Zach G."}

We always thought of it as a cozy place with reliable good (though not exciting) food. We needed a place to meet friends and thought \"let's go back\". What a disappointing experience.\n\nIt started with the host. When we got to the restaurant there was one table occupied. The host proceeded to seat us at a ridiculously small table for four. This table would barely hold two comfortably. We discussed this with him and he insisted we sit at this table. We asked about two two-tops that had been pushed together and he said he was saving them in case a bigger group came in and he needed to move things around. So we sat down and waited for our friends. After just a few minutes my wife started getting claustrophobic so she got up and insisted on a new table. He finally relented and moved us to a more comfortable table.\n\nThen a single man came in. The restaurant was still pretty much empty. The host puts him in an adjacent (and I mean very adjacent) table seated so he is facing us. It was like we had an audience for the rest of the meal. Our bar order was messed up (my dry martini came extra dirty). The salads were all watery and tasteless. Entrees were meh.

The service is friendly and thoughtful.  They brought me 2 glasses of complimentary champagne, so why only 3 stars?\n\nThe tables in the back can be a bit loud for soft conversation and I'm not a huge fan of the food.  I recently had the New York steak and neither the cook nor the seasoning were great; green salad was 13 or 14 bucks, which seemed a little overpriced.\n\nYou'll probably need a reservation or you'll end up eating outside (where you can't really hear the music).

It's a little hard to find so make sure that you search around before giving up. Also I wish I had looked up when they had live music! I assumed Saturday night would be one of those nights, but it wasn't. I hear their performances are really fun and exciting to watch, so I wish I had checked when that would be happening so dinner could have been more interesting. \n\nService: My reservation was for 8:00pm but I still had to wait about 15 minutes which was slightly annoying because I had made the reservation a week earlier and it was only for a party of 2. But besides all that, the servers were all very courteous and the food came out in a timely fashion. \n\nFood: We ordered a french onion soup to start with. This was way too salty, and really made the soup just hard to eat itself. We had to take really small bites (because we arrived really hungry) to take it down. My friend ordered a lamb dish, which unfortunately he said was way too salty and did not have any flavor (besides the salt that is). I ordered the baked macaroni and cheese plate. Unfortunately this place was overhyped. Basic mac and cheese is really easy, but this place did not even live up to that low standard. It again lacked flavor, was way too thick in terms of cheese, and even after dousing it in the only hot sauce they had on the premise, I still did not like it. The part that I did like about it was the baked part, because the crisp was just perfect and it wasn't too hard to break into like some baked mac & cheese plates. \n\nVerdict: I will NOT be coming back. So ridiculously pricy for food that was either too salty or just not flavored. Only good stuff was the service and the cute ambiance in the restaurant. There are numerous restaurants in the city that are also fancy, similarly priced or even cheaper, and actually have great food!", "author": "Anu P."}

Yes, it's a cute little restaurant in some alley in the Financial District, but this place has too many high stars and probably undeserving stars.\n\nFirst off, our party of three was squeezed into a tiny table, when there were obviously larger tables that were never occupied throughout the night.  I understand the attempt to make the place look and feel like Paris, since one of the best meals I\"ve had in France was in a cozy little restaurant with my neighbors a few inches away from us.  That being said, this place didn't need to try to make it too cozy when there was space.  Dishes and glasses piled up on our table that was clearly too small for three people.\n\nSecond, we ordered TWO of the appetizer plates to share, the assorted plate and the cheese plate.  Somehow the waiter got it wrong and brought the charcuterie plate as well, for a total of three appetizers.  We didn't bother sending it back, because they all looked so good and they were good.  Unfortunately, that was the best part of the meal.\n\nI ordered the Omble Chevalier, which I thought was the closest thing to a Bouillabaisse, my favorite French soup.  Disappointed, especially after waiting forever for this dish to arrive.  I understand that this may take a while to make, but really a good soup should have been prepared well in advanced, and this clearly wasn't.\n\nWaiter disappeared and came by whenever he felt like it, in really long intervals, meaning that I could not get my water glass refilled in a timely manner.  In the end, we could not find him to get our check and possibly the host took care of us.\n\nWine list contains only French wine, fine this is understandable, but I found that they tried too hard to mimic a French restaurant in Paris, that they have failed their local crowd.\n\nMaybe I've been spoiled by the NYC food scene, maybe Californians aren't too picky about their French food, but either way I was not impressed.", "author": "Tina Y."}

It started off well as we ordered foie gras and steak tartare. The foie gras dish ate sweet and needed a bit of texture and acidity. The steak tartare could have been cut a little smaller and all the way through, but the flavor was good. The biggest problem I had with the dinner was the entree and service. The pappardelle duck confit, squash and Brussels sprouts pasta was probably the worst pasta dish I've had all year. There was no flavor, absolutely bland. The kabocha squash overcooked and lacking uniformity.  There was hardly any duck in the pasta...But the worst part of the dish was the noodles were all clumped together!!!  I have to say, I don't think even Olive Garden's noodles stick together like that!!!  It's pretty difficult to ruin a pasta dish, so congratulations, your chef did a great job in achieving that. I had to flag down a busboy to refill our waters, and I wanted to tell the server how terrible the pasta was but he never even asked how our meal was. The only reason I continued eating was because I was so hungry and I didn't want to wait another 40 minutes so they can recreate a terrible afterthought of a dish!", "author": "Cookee L."}

I knew I'd have to either walk or take public transportation (I don't really like cabs), so I was looking for restaurants that'd be worth the effort.\n\nI planned to have dinner with a couple of ladies so I wanted the mood to be lively and the food to be delicious (we're all foodies). After doing a quick Yelp search around the area, I came upon Cafe Claude. Hmm, \"french\" food or sushi? Tough call but I felt I'd appreciate the ambience of Cafe Claude more than the local sushi joints.\n\nAfter a five-minute walk in high heels, I arrived at the alley where I'd have to go through to get to the restaurant. I don't know if it was just dark but I couldn't find it at first and had to walk back and forth a little while until I realized where it was. It's tucked away in between other restaurants. \n\nWhen I walked in, I noticed the lighting was nice (romantic, even), and they had a live jazz band playing. Cha-ching! I sat down immediately but felt that the booth had really mushy chairs. Bad for my back, actually. And although I'm a tall woman, I felt a tad short because the table was tall compared to the booth.\n\nAnyway, we ordered some drinks and a side of fries. Mm, the skinny, marinated fries were delicious! Those were gone in a hot minute. Then our main dishes came out. I ordered the coq au vin, and the chicken was really tender. The meat just fell off of the bone! The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the coq au vin wasn't as hyped up as some people on this site made it out to be. Also, our waiter wasn't all too attentive, and so the service didn't really stand out to me.\n\nI'd definitely come back here for a date night or something in the near future but heck, if I'm traveling up to SF to try the food, I'll most likely pass this restaurant by and try some of the other places nearby. I guess it just goes to show that the food wasn't all *TOO* memorable.", "author": "Stace K."}

It is tucked down an alley - Claude Lane - so I would never have found it just walking around The City. Overall, the atmosphere was very intimate and the food very good.\n\nThe highlight of my meal was my starter.  I had the frisee aux lardons - frisee salad with pork belly and soft poached egg. The saltiness and richness of the pork and egg combined nicely with the sherry vinaigrette and bitter greens. The \"Thon\" - coriander and fennel crusted tuna, heirloom tomato, corn ragu, and cumcumber sherry consomm\u00e9 - was delicious, and the cr\u00e8me brulee was a nice finish.\n\nThe service was good overall, though dining later on Sunday night I sensed my waiter was ready to wrap up and head home. He was helpful in finding us some aperitifs that suited our tastes, but then he took our food order without our wine order and I had to ask for the wine list back. While I was waiting for a refill of my coffee, he was folding napkins behind me. I actually liked his style other than these missteps.\n\nThere was also a couple that was quite overzealous in their embrace of the romantic atmosphere. We were close to asking them to get a room.

I thought the quality of the food was just A-OK (3 stars) at most.  I would definitely not wait in queue to eat here next time.\n\nI came on Tuesday, 24 May 2011 for dinner with a friend. We made reservations; however, did not need them.  We ordered the following:\n\nFrench Onion Soup ($8.00 x2) - I was so underwhelmed by this soup.  I wanted to return it, but was too lazy and didn't want to offend anyone. I would not order this again, and I suggest you avoid it yourself. \n\nPommes Frites ($6.00) - We ordered this as a side. They were actually not bad. I enjoyed them.\n\nSeafood Stew ($23.00) - My friend ordered this and said something was off about it.  I didn't have a taste, but he said he'd avoid this if he ever came back. \n\nGrilled Trout ($21.00) - I ordered the grilled trout... the fish was a bit over-cooked, so it was on the dry side.  Otherwise, the flavours were fine. \n\nAlong with a glass of wine ($10.00) and a bottle of Badoit sparkling water ($7.00), our bill came to $83.00 + 8.21 tax + 3.32 Healthy SF tax + 20.00 tip = $114.53 total for the two of us.\n\nService was okay.. our server came across as cocky (but I'm sure he didn't mean it that way).

We had to \"settle\" with this place, but you never know when you're going to stumble upon something you might really love. \n\nOften times at French restaurants, my brother and I get weird looks or we'd get seated in areas where we aren't seen, like a tucked away room with no one else in it.  Discrimination is no fun, but we got none of that here!  Is it 'cause I'm young n' I'm Black n' my hats real low? Do I look like a mind reader sir? I don't know. \n\nThe waitress was super nice and she speaks French, definitely legit. She recommended that I get the Bouillabaisse as it was the special of the day (Thursdays). I've been meaning to try Bouillabaisse for a long long time now and sadly, the other entrees they offer didn't seem very appealing so this was a pretty easy choice. Well...IT WAS THE MOST AMAZING SOUP/STEW/BROTH/WHATEVER HANDS DOWN. The Mussels that came with it were just alright, they were small, but tasty. The Rockfish Fillet was just alright too, but it went well with the flavorful stew. The bread they had laying underneath was simply perfect, it soaked in everything and became this concentrated flavorful bread brick of good eats! I have no idea what I just said, but this dish has got me speaking jibberish! Get it if you show up on a Thursday!\n\nI also tried the Steak Tartare and it was pretty good. It's mixed with a few items: capers, shallots, anchovies, and horseradish. I might pass on it next time though, but it was definitely worth trying. The Faux Filet was not bad at all, but let's just say my brother fell in love with my dish and not his.\n\nOur server was attractive, speaks French, and was polite and not at all giving us the cold shoulder like we have now come to expect at these types of places.

There was no other way I wanted to spend my birthday than in my favorite city, eating French food and listening to live jazz. I found the perfect spot. I made reservations for 8:00 p.m. because the live music begins at 7:30 p.m. and ends at 10:00 p.m. I planned to spend the whole evening there.\n\nWe walked there from our hotel. It was tucked in a cool alley with some other cool-looking bars/restaurants. I liked the outdoor eating area. The place was small but packed and happenin' which was a good sign. The lighting was low, moody, and romantic. It was an awkward layout though and a bit cramped.\n\nI got there exactly at 8:00 and our table wasn't ready :( It seemed as though they gave it to the two girls in line in front of us. And it was a nice table by a window facing the alley activity. I didn't verify, I just assumed and it bothered me a little. We had to wait about 15 minutes to get a table, way in the back by the bathroom...\n\nThe food was OK. I had the Truite Amandine. It was pretty tasty. It was a complete trout fish, split open (butterfly style) with the bones removed. It had good flavor with an interesting mix of small cauliflower, almonds, capers, and raisins in a Meuni\u00e8re (brown butter) sauce. It was very good. The meat was soft and I didn't find any bones. Though it was not filling at all. That's why the French are so thin! lol My friend had the velout\u00e9 (garlic and cauliflower soup) and the Porc (sliced pork chop with sweet mustard jus and onions.) Aside from cuisine, the French are also known for their pastries. For dessert we split an apple tart which was not fresh and tasted like those packaged pastries from the gas station. \n\nMy biggest gripes are that initially our reserved table wasn't ready and we were seated by the bathroom way in the back and the fact that the band took their break during my ENTIRE meal. It was a real bummer. Practically the whole time I listened to nothing or non-jazz music on the house speakers. We ended up leaving after we ate and of course, the band came back but I just wanted to return to the hotel and crash for the night. \n\nI figured the meal and drinks would be expensive because 1.) It's French food, 2.) It's San Francisco, and 3.) I was also paying for live music. But overall the experience was \"meh\" and not worth the $112 I spent.", "author": "Catalina V."}

Tucked away in an alleyway where this restaurant got its name, is a cafe with an inviting patio area right on the street. Inside is a cozy interior marked by a curved zinc bar, period posters and vintage tables. The atmosphere welcomes intimate conversations but keep it PG since the tables are close together.\n\nThe cocktail list enticed me with a barrage of choices: do I go for my favorite vesper or try one of the pastis drinks? Absinthe and Pernod aren't usually my top choices in a cocktail but the combinations they included in their drinks were enough to pique my interest. I eventually went with a more classic drink, a French 75 made with sparking wine, gin, grenadine and lemon juice. Perfect for brunch and won't make me loopy before my hair appointment.\n\nCarb watchers, beware. They serve Acme bread that you can chew on while you wait. (yes, I saw the delivery guy on my way out!)  Try your very best to resist. \n\nThe bistro menu remains true to their French roots with French onion soup, quiche Lorraine, croque madame, etc. The cream of mushroom was a special of the day and it was supreme! especially with a drizzle of truffle oil and sprinkling of fresh chives. \n\nMy Albacore tuna salad sammy with lettuce, hard boiled egg, olives and anchovies were piled between thick rosemary ciabatta bread. The serving wasn't huge, but I was fully satisfied. I actually didn't have room for dessert.\n\nService was so much better than our previous brunch experience at Cafe dela Presse just down the block. Our server let us be, since we had months worth of catching up to do, but was present when we needed her. \n\nThe next time I need another dose of Parisian flavor in my life, I won't hesitate to think of Cafe Claude.

They were not in the shell so we didn't have to worry about taking them out.  They were cooked with garlic, butter, parsley, almond, pernod, shallots, anchovy and a puff pastry on top.  This was my first time having escargot and it was ok, consistency is a bit weird for me, but the taste wasn't bad. If anything the ingredients masked the snail taste (if there is even one). For the main course, I had the cod and it was AMAZING.  I'm always afraid to order cod as most times I've had it - it's been too salty. But this was just done right.  Very simple and light, the swiss chard really add a nice taste to the fish.  He ordered the whole trout which was very lemony.  I thought it was delicious, but if you're not a big lemon fan, this may not be the fish for you.  Also, it's the whole fish, so the portion is bigger than the cod I had. Lastly, for dessert, I had the apple tart with caramel, I loved this as well! Not that sweet and light and simple.  He ordered the soft chocolate cake which was simple and good, but I like my dessert best. We shared a carafe of red wine (couldn't tell which as the server had suggested it for us).\n\nService was ok with staff filling our wine glasses. It was nice having the live music and I appreciated how it didn't get too loud.\n\nLoved this place for the food and ambiance, I would definitely return!", "author": "Kristine W."}

The waitresses were cute (one had a french accent!) and the service was great, they kept coming back to refill our water and to ask how everything was.\n\nTo eat : First we ordered the escargot (5/5) I've never had escargot before -beware its REALLY hot- but it was sooo good! Thoroughly enjoyed it! Then we ordered the steak tartare (5/5) EXCELLENT and the charcuterie sampler with pickles (5/5) really great too!  The coq au vin (5/5) chicken marinated in red wine had really good taste to it, and the Gnocchi (5/5) a must!! was UNBELIEVABLY GOOD. One of the yummiest things I've ever eaten!\n\nDessert : We ordered the Creme Brulee (5/5) a must!! and the Moelleux Au Chocolat (5/5) -hard to say name for chocolate cake- was very thick with flavor and the Calvados dessert brandy to go with it (a bit strong for my taste but had a hint of apples)\n\nOverall : Great atmosphere, great service, EXCEPTIONAL food and dessert.

Quite small inside, but they made up for it by adding tables outside in the alley--very reminiscent of other European cities (Barcelone, Roma, Venice, to name a  few). \n\nThey had a jazz trio the night we were there, and we were seated outside--perhaps this was better for us as it might have been a tad loud inside. The outside seating was perfect for us and allowed us to converse in a romantic environment (it being an anniversary dinner after all!). Check the calendar for schedules.\n\nWe had the assiette pate and macaroni gratine for starters--both fabulous (I preferred the macaroni just slightly), and then the confit cunard (duck confit) and coq au vin for dinner...both were fabulous as well! We wanted to order the entire dessert menu as everything looked good, but settled for some good old fashioned French dessert: the creme brulee...didn't disappoint either!\n\nI loved everything about this place, and will DEFINITELY be back! It would have been a pure 5-star review for me, except the rest room fell a bit below the standard of the rest of the establishment.

We were probably the rowdiest group there, but the waitress was very patient with us as we got seated and proceeded to ask questions about the menu. \n\nSince we were all starving, we quickly decided on the steak tartare to share, which was FANTASTIC, at least in my state-of-mind at the time, it was very good. My dinnermates also had the french onion soup that looked piping hot and had a ton of melty cheese on top. Must try that next time!\n\nThe entrees were brought out very quickly after and small table became crowded with coq au vin, faux filet and porc. None was THAT memorable, but every dish was good.

To my pleasant surprise the steak tartare was prepared table side, and done extremely well.  The portion was generous, and the flavors were well balanced.  I've had steak tartare in a few places in Hawaii, and Colorado.  Cafe Claude is by far the best.  \n\nAs for our dinner, the Mrs had the pork chops which was a light dish with huge natural flavors.  The pork chop was the star of this dish, but the supporting cast of; cubed apples, butter beans, cabbage really rounded the flavor palate.  I had the duck confit.  A dish that consisted of the duck, fris\u00e9e and egg salad, and what I think were black lentils.  The execution of the individual components were well done, but together was confusing.  \n\nThe reason for only three stars?  Service.  I've read the service was outstanding at this establishment.  I will have to disagree.  When I failed to receive an order, and decided to cancel it the waiter seemed to challenge me by calling me \"boss,\" and saying \"it's up to you\" with sarcastic overtones.\n\nI will definitely dine at Cafe Claude again, and will not let someone's bad night ruin an otherwise great dining experience.", "author": "Trevor A."}

Lighting at night is dim but warm. Ambiance last night was complemented by the great live jazz band that was playing throughout the meal.  Because the space is pretty small, you definitely will be getting to know the tables right next to you...especially when they have to limbo around you to take a bathroom break.  Better start off with some drinks...thankfully the cocktail list is extensive and they don't mix 'em weak.\n\nUp to bat 1st...Pate Sampler.  They basically have 4 pates and you choose 3.  All of them are tasty, but the Truffle Mousse one is the supastah of the bunch...for sure.\n\nNext up...Entrees.  Last night we sampled the Coq Au Vin and the NY Strip special.  Coq Au Vin was tasty & well-prepared...but not mind blowing.  The NY Strip however took things up a notch.  Cooked perfectly and drizzled with an intense but not overwhelming blue cheese sauce...this dish seriously rocked.  The side of steak fries and sauteed greens was delish as well.\n\nLast to bat...Dessert.  The Tart Tatin is essentially an upside down apple pie.  Apparently this was our waitress' \"favorite\" dessert.  We must however have totally different tastebuds since this tart was nothing to write home about.\n\nOther than the dessert, the meal at Cafe Claude was really quite nice...like a solid 3.75 stars.  If you're in the Union Square neck of the woods, I'd say you should trek over to Claude Lane and check out Cafe Claude or Gitane...can't really go wrong with either choice.", "author": "Justin L."}

My now-husband introduced me to that place in March of 2008 as our first date :), then I came back once with a coworker, once with a group of friends, once with my mum, and finally for lunch with a group of 14 people (friends & family) on the day of our civil marriage ceremony (!) ...  Basically, whatever the occasion is, whoever I am with, I am confident that I will have a good time and even impress my guest(s). \n\nThat makes Cafe Claude one of my favorite restaurants in San Francisco, my favorite refined but still affordable French restaurant (I am very French myself) and the #1 place that I want to go to if I am not in the mood for sushi.\n\nAbout the food. This is your diner recommendation:\nTo Start: Escargots en Croute. \nFor the main course: STEAK TARTARE!!\nTo Finish: Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e\nI would have happily provided an alternative selection but they have changed the menu again.... grrr, I am averse to change and that means I am no longer expert about Cafe Claude's menu. Plus, I can't get over the fact they don't serve Coquille Saint Jacques or Seared Ahi Tuna any longer (that was in 2008-2010, the sauce that came with it was succulent). But new menu items are keeping it exciting. \n\nTheir steak tartare is fantastic, very colorful and fine in flavors and presentation, served in a professional fashion and with perfectly toasted bread.  I am not expert in steak tartare (which woman wants to be?) but I've had steak tartare in many different locations in the US or in France and this one is easily ranked #1.\n\nThe ambiance is warm, romantic and classy. Very enjoyable. If you sit outside, make sure to sit under the heating lamps, they create a comfortable atmosphere. Further away it starts getting dark and chilly. \n\nI have always received average good service. For the 14-people lunch party on our civil marriage day, Kandis took care of us in a very professional way. It was nice of Cafe Claude to accept our large party in the middle of the afternoon, they don't usually do that but we had special circumstances as, like said above, my husband and I had our first date there ... \n\n... that's for our love story at and with Cafe Claude :)", "author": "Annabelle G."}

Originally, I planned to go to Gitane but there was a long wait and we were hungry. We decided to check out Cafe Claude because it had caught our eye on the way to Gitane.\n\nFirst off, I love Claude Lane - what a cute, romantic little alley way. When we walked into Cafe Claude they were able to seat us right away. I enjoyed the atmosphere and decor - very casual yet classy.\n\nOur server was nice and service was attentive. We had a few cocktails, all of which were great tasting. Food was also great - most dishes we loved, a few were okay. After looking at the menu and wanting to order everything, we decided to order 1 entree and share a couple other appetizers (which they call small plates here).\n\nWe shared the Pate De Campagne (pork pate), Coquilles Saint Jacques (scallops), Tartare de thon Rouge (ahi tuna), Pates du Jour (pasta of the day), and their Macaroni and Cheese.\n\nWe especially liked the Pate and Pasta of the Day. I'm glad the server suggested the pork pate over the others, since he explained to us that it was the more traditional version and their other options were on the sweeter side. The Pasta of the Day was a Rigatoni with Pork Belly in it - YUM! Excellent, excellent dish. I was a little disappointed in the scallops - the scallops were good, but the dish was mostly sauce and mushrooms. Don't get me wrong, I love saucy mushrooms, but if I'm paying a decent price for scallops, I want more! There was just too little of it. Tuna Tartare was okay and the Macaroni and Cheese was excellent but unfortunately by the time we got to it, we were getting full and the creaminess of it made it difficult to eat.\n\nOverall, great little restaurant.

Items ordered were the steak tartare, chevre salad, onion soup and the Nicoise. The Nicoise was my order- generously topped with tuna confit, green beans, egg, olives, capers, potato and anchovies. It was delicious. It's unclear as to whether the tuna confit is made in-house or if it's canned in olive oil, but either way I enjoyed it.

Even though I lived in Paris for a year, I could never bring myself to order it. The 1-2 combination punch of raw beef topped with a raw egg yolk was just too intimidating.\n\nSo Friday after work I went out for drinks with some co-workers. Lovey Girl met up with me downtown and we went over to Caf Claude. I'd already enjoyed a few margaritas before we got to the restaurant and I was feeling daring. I ordered a Beterave (beet) Salad (delicious) and, of course, the Steak Tartare. They bring it out to you with little dollops of chopped cornichons, capers, echalottes, parsley, and mustard on the side, and of course, topped with an egg yolk in a robin's eggshell. The waitress asks me if I like it spicy and I say pourquoi pas. She expertly mixes up some spicy dijon mustard and olive oil in a bowl, then combines in the steak and all the sides before spooning it back into my plate.\n\nI took my first bite and was totally hooked. It was tender and juicy and delicious. I'm kicking myself for not having tried it before now. I'm usually pretty good about trying new things, but this one took me a while.

I tired making reservations at various places but there was all these freaking rules, like signing a contract and putting down half the deposit, a group our side needing a private room and we wouldn't be able to dine until 8:00pm.  UGH.  But when I called Cafe Claude, they were very nice about making sure they could accommodate our group, and were very polite after I had to change the date and time from the original reservation.  They asked if we could pre-order our food, which wouldn't work out too well with our group and agreed to allow us to order off the menu.\n\nWe got seated and half the group disappeared to go shopping, but the very sweet waiter was accommodating and took the drink orders for the few of us that were at the table.  We were still waiting for other to arrive from the airport so we settled in with our drinks and ordered appetizers.  We got the Fromage (cheese plate) , Charcuterie (cured meats) and Assitte de 3 Pates (assorted pate) to share.  We really enjoyed all the appetizers.\n\nNow came time to order the food.  Half the table ordered the special of the night, Florida prawns on a bed of polenta.  They were the biggest prawns I have ever seen, sweet and delicate.  The dish blew us away.  I didn't take note of what other people ordered, but everyone was more than pleased with their food.

I ordered the special for a Saturday lunch--a glass of Sauvignon blanc 2009 with a smoked salmon salad and a carrot-tomato soup (no cream). My girlfriend ordered a glass of rose wine with steak tartar and goose liver. The goose liver was a win and the steak tartar had various groupings of onions, cilantro, and other plants.However the coup de gras was sitting atop of the dish; a pour-ready raw quail egg waiting to cascade down the mountain of raw meat and make sure one realized it's possible to be classy and barbaric at the same time. My girlfriend said she felt like a monster eating all the raw food yet loving it so much.\n\nThe ambiance: tucked away in Claude Ln in the financial district this is easy access for bridge and tunnel crowd, as well as the locals.

Overall, everything was just good, but I'm not pining away for anything I had there, so 3 stars seems most appropriate. \n\nThe French Onion Soup was delicious. Not too salty. \n\nWe had 2 pates: Campagne Black Pepper and Truffle Mousse. I liked the campagne more because it had a stronger, more robust flavor, but it was more on the dry side, so it crumbled a bit when I tried to spread it on the cracker. The truffle mouse was smooth and glided across the bread nicely. It had a nice delicate flavoring, but I still preferred the campagne. \n\nAs Cafe Claude was the 4th stop of me and my friend, Angela W's hunt for the best beef tartare in town, we obviously ordered the steak tartare, which was better than the tartare at Gamine or Chez Papa Resto, but it didn't come anywhere near Bix . . . \n\nPommes Frites fries were nothing exceptional. They were yummy, but it's pretty hard to screw up french fries. Well, I guess some places can screw it up when their fries get soggy before serving, so kudos for getting it to our table while still crunchy and hot! \n\nWe also had their wax beans special were nice, but Angela W. loved them, so my ambivalence to them might be due to my slight aversion to vegetables. Butter lettuce salad was nice, but unexceptional. Plus, some mushroom pasta. \n\nOur server was very helpful, and checked on us with enough regularity for us to ask for extra condiments, crackers, and cocktails, but not so much that he almost became another dinner companion. \n\nThe bartender, however, might need to take a refresher course on making drinks. We had a clear view of the bar from our seats, and could tell there were no other orders, but ours . . . and it still took FOREVER for him to make 2 simple cocktail concoctions. \n\nTotal Bill after being stuffed to the brim and 2 cocktails each: $122.94 (not including tip).", "author": "Christina L."}

So awwwwwwwesome.\n\nIt was cute. What was better than cute is my date order me a glass of wine of a varietal I had never heard of, forget about tasting. It was Tannat Berthoumieu, a drier delicious French varietal, normally a blending grape. This impressed me because I found it to be confident and smart to go out on a limb and impress the girl who knows a little something about wine and food and all that jazz.\n\nWe ate a few things: Brussels sprouts, Quinoa salad, Pommes Frites, the kitchen even made me some spatzle that came as a side for one of the other dishes. \nThis alone I would DEFINITELY return for...those little starchy thingys were perfectly cooked and sauteed up making them the star of my dinner. \n\nMy date, who is now my beau (YUP), had the Coq Au Vin. Never liked the stuff and this did not change my mind. Still don't like it. Which is fine, because I didn't order it. Other people like it just fine and that's cool. More spatzle please!\n\nI have to say the Tarte aux Pommes was a little on the smaller side, and there was no ice cream to be found...maybe it's just my arrogant American ways that I want my tart and Ice cream too. \n\nOh well, four stars for charm, SPATZLE, a new wine experience and our first kiss. \nI'll say yippee-ye-ki-yeah to all of that that Cafe Claude has to offer.", "author": "Violet J."}

Perfect for a FiDi workday power lunch with personality or an escape from Union Square madness during the weekend.\n\nSoupe a l'oignon: A fancy name for French Onion Soup.  Nice crispy cheese layer with a savory broth tasting heavily of red wine.  Solidly ranks amid the better French Onion Soups out there.\n\nPotato & Leek Soup: Reminded me of a warm vichyssoise.  There was some sort of oil drizzle on top, perhaps truffle oil?  Creamy and subtle, perfect for a chilly winter evening.\n\nSteak Tartare: Boo for using flank instead of the better filet mignon.  Yay for delivering the plate unmixed allowing the patron to assemble the cornichons, capers, egg yolk, mustard, parsley, shallots, worcester sauce, tabasco and black pepper to taste.  Not the best (yes, that's you Bix or Harris) but a nice runner up for offering high user engagement. \n\nTruffle Mousse: You had me at truffle.  Chicken liver by itself is nice, but it totally becomes my favorite in the p\u00e2t\u00e9 plate with the addition of this wondrous tuber. \n\nSauternes Mousse: Not as great as the truffle mousse, but I believe that goose liver is inherently richer and more sophisticated than chicken liver.  A nice contrast to the plate.\n\nP\u00e2t\u00e9 de Campagne: Seems like every other pork p\u00e2t\u00e9 I get at French restaurants.  A little fatty tasting so best doused in mustard.

I tried to tell them otherwise, but they insisted.  And, they were disappointed.  The jazz was limited to a 2 piece band stuck in the corner between the bar and the door.  Once inside the restaurant, you could barely hear them.\n\nAnd, things didn't get much better from there.  First, our table was super crooked and when we pointed it out to the waiter, he basically said it would have been such a hassle to try to fix it, since the table was already set.  So, we just left it, but it was really weird.\n\nI was excited to try the spring pea soup, which is one of my favorites.  But, it was weird.  It tasted like peanuts.  The pate was also just okay, but they probably don't even make it on site.  The only thing that earned them 2 stars was the steak tartare.  It was excellent.  It's mixed at the table and big enough for 2 people to easily share.  It was tasty and spicy and I loved it.

We started with the escargot and the pate with the black pepper, and a carafe of the Bordeaux. All were delicious, the escargot was not overly buttery like in some places i have had, it was nice with a pesto feel. \n\nFor dinner i had the Gnocchi with corn, tomatoes, green beans and brown butter! Oh my gosh this was the best gnocchi i have ever had, and i order gnocchi everytime i see it on the menu. it wasnt a traditional gnocchi, it was much more soft and ooey gooey delicious.  it came with this great corn that was nice and crisp for the crunch and these little tomatoes that were so juicy when you bit into it that the whole bite was this tasty explosion in your mouth! My boyfriend got the steak, asparagus, and fingerling potatoes. he ordered it medium rare, and it was exactly that, not overdone like everywhere else. It had a nice red wine sauce i believe, but i only got one bite because he ate it too quickly to share!\n\nFor dessert we went with the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, and the poire cognac, which is pear flavored. the creme brulee was just as it should be with soft center, nice and crispy top with a little dusting of powdered sugar, and the cognac went well with it. this was my first time having a cognac, but i sipped slow and actually quite enjoyed it. \n\nEverything here was an A++, especially the service. We were i think the last customers seated, and had a bit of a wait for our food, but the wine came out quickly, and we were not in a rush to eat anyways. our server was very apologetic, even where it was not needed, and she also shared with us that she is from bordeaux where our wine was from!

However, these are the cornerstones and getting them right is very important. To that end, Cafe Claude succeeded, delivering a well prepared French meal. The wine list looked interesting, but I brought my own wine and was charged a $20 corkage fee.\n\nThe ambiance: it is in a small \"alleyway\" with outdoor, partially covered, seating available. Inside there is a small bar, and two seating areas. The cafe has a clean but well executed interior.  Further, seating is spaced as it would be in Europe - tight.  It can be intimate on a slower night, but a little hectic otherwise. On weekend nights there is a live band playing theme-appropriate music, not quiet Jazz, but laid back nonetheless.\n\nService: we were there on a busy night; service was attentive without being annoying. \nHowever, had to wait ten minutes or so when ordering ap\u00e9ritifs at the bar.", "author": "Oleg A."}

It was my first visit, and it won't be my last.  I wasn't going to get a salad but since everyone else in the group did, I quickly added on to the order.  We got beet salad and goat cheese salads.  The goat cheese salad came with bread and it looked good.  The beets were a little orange in color and looked like ahi tuna slices.  i was afraid to try them initially but it wasn't bad at all.  Golden beets are still my favorite, and now I can say I've had 3 kinds of beets - golden, red, and orange. \n\nI ordered the rainbow trout as my main course.  The moraccan lentils under it were too salty but the fish itself was good - moist and not too flakey, also fresh tasting.  I should have asked for a lemon slice to drizzle over it.   It would have enhanced the flavor.  I ended with an apple tart which was okay.  I've had better at trader joe's (sorry to say).  Maybe my taste buds aren't refined but at least you know that theirs was made and not store-bought. \n\nService was excellent.  Someone in our party wasn't sure which wine to get - she was in between 2 choices, and the waiter not only made a recommendation but  brought out a little sample of each for her to try.  She went with his recommendation.  Not too many places will do that.  Also, since they have been in business for more than 20 years, they have perfected their menu and the waiter said he could wholeheartedly recommend every dish.

I e-mailed the manager a week before requesting a reservation and even a reserved table since this was a special evening and she was more then happy to accommodate my request - very appreciated.\n\nThe Escargot En Croute (our snails were topped with a very delicate puff pastry with liberal amounts of garlic and butter (w/ plenty of bread for dipping) was delicious and I enjoyed the evening special of pasta a rock shrimp while she had the trout. Both dishes were nicely balanced proportions and the service was attentive and quite knowledgeable.\n\nFor example. My girl was looking for a not too sweet, not too dry white wine to go with the trout and the waitress made a recommendation. Turns out my girl loved it and the waitress did us the favor of writing down the name of the grape, vineyard and wine label, and even imparted the knowledge of the various tiers of the wine and how its character changes during the aging process. All in a 'for your information' tone and not the 'let me snub you with my massive amounts of vino knowledge'.\n\nBetween the special accommodation, light live jazz in the background, fresh cuisine and authentic 'Monsieur, Madame, Bon Appetit!' we left with a smile on our faces are are looking forward to our next visit.", "author": "Jason M."}

CLASS. You walk down the charming alley of Claude Lane and you just know. There's the Vespa parked in front, the heated covered outdoor seating, up the stairs and the atmosphere envelops you, the people are smiling, the aroma is intoxication, the full bar is a promise. \n\nWe were seated near the window by a cute Parisian-esque girl, our server, cute as a button and friendly as could be told us the specials, was sweet as pie and even in a high-scale place like this, we were right at home. \nSignature cocktails are strong, and truly, not to be missed. Mine was the Aviator and let me tell you, it was the only drink I needed. \n\nDown to the heart of it, the food. I chose the Pork Tenderloin with green beans and a gorgeous, gorgeous honey buttery sauce that just fills the plate with luscious viscosity of appley-honey warm sauciness. The deciding factor for me was that this came with caramelized apples, Lordy, was I not disappointed. \n\nMy Mom got the Crouque Monsieur with their legendary fries, BEST in show. Crispy thick, but very light bread, bechemel that was creamy and accented the beautiful ham perfectly. Cheese on top, of course and you're biting into all worlds of taste. The fries, these are everything you want them to be in a shoestring frie. Not at all greasy, never limp, just crisp with a bit of salt and puffy potato inner. \n\nDessert - Creme Fraiche Cheesecake with rhubarb and strawberry compote, fresh strawberries and a sprig of mint. But it doesn't stop there. Bits of a flour, butter, brown sugar mixture that must be fried to make crunchy bits were strewn on the plate. It was like a crunchy delightful little crust to accompany the cake. And of the cheesecake. So very extremely light and lovely on your tongue. \n\nAs we were devouring the last course - just like everything else - our server brought us each a complimentary glass of muscat, as a toast to it being my Mom's Birthday. Class. \n\nI can't say which is better - the service or the food. We fell in love with the first step across the threshold and I know we will be back. We even contemplated staying in the city just so we could come back for dinner. \n\nTip: order what we did and share. You will not BELIEVE how amazing the Crouque Monsieur and the fries are when dipped in the sauce that comes with the tenderloin. Ridiculous.", "author": "Katie W."}

So I'm all sweaty, out of breath and pissed off for the trouble I went through to get here and I don't even get a table to see the band.

While the location is decently central relative to Union Square, the restaurant is also a quiet and cozy restaurant. \n\nMy favorite dishes at Cafe Claude are the frisee salad, tarte a l'oignon and the chef special cod. The frisee salad striked the perfect balance of acidity and the bacon just worked so well with the salad. As for the onion tarte, I loved the pear on top of the tart and the pastry itself was crisp and delicious. Finally, the chef special cod was cooked perfectly and I loved the sauce that came with the cod. The top of the cod was also seared nicely. My friend's entree, clam linguini, was made really lightly as well so it wasn't too heavy of a lunch.\n\nI would stay away from the mussels because they are not the freshest batch out there, but everything else is worth a try!

Very busy and noisy.\n\nStaff great, attentive and keen although the hosts were confused and could do better.\n\nFood was poor.  The onion soup was abominable.  One of my favorite dishes, and one that I make a lot at home, this was one of the worst I've tasted in a long time.  Large chunks of onions with no evidence of caramelization at all.  Looked like they'd just chucked in some chopped onion into some bad stock. Very strong mushroom taste (stock?) when they should have used a good, beef stock.  This is a relatively simple dish which relies on good cooking and patient caramelization of the onions for flavor.  Not evident here at all.  OH said the pate was okay.  Complimentary bread was hard and a bit stale.  The toast with the pate was good.  \n\nCoq au vin was better.  Much more like the real thing but portions were very small.  It apparently came with fingerling potatoes but I counted only one, thumbnail sized piece.  It was absolutely edible and average. If I'd gone to a friend's dinner party and they served it, I would have thought, good effort!  It was very amateurish.  The dessert was better but still not quite right.

It was cheesy and the bread was thick enough that it had a nice bite to it. The bechamel sauce was creamy and the ham nice and smoky. The fries that accompanied the dish were crispy and perfectly salted. For dessert, I got the chocolate mousse. I was expecting something light but it was really dense and chocolatey. Very rich and surprisingly not too sweet. \n\nI had a wonderful experience here and wish I lived in San Fran so I couldn't frequent this cute cafe often.

After moving away from SF, I decided to go back to my favorite restaurant while visiting the city for work. \nI started with the onion soup, one of my favorite.\nI guess the chef has changed as the soup was not at all as my taste buds remembered it. This one was too salty, with not enough bread and barely any cheese on top. It used to be with a crispy cheese layer, that became a half layer of not that crispy cheese.\nThe bread brought to the table was cold. It was not bad but I feel like bringing hot bread to the table is such a delicate touch.\nNext was the fris\u00e9e salad which was really good. The potatoes were warm, the poached egg still runny and the sauce perfectly balanced. That was a hit.\nFor desert I tried the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e. It was really good. The top was crispy and it was warm. It could have been slightly more hot but that would have been to make it perfect. It was close to it enough.\nOverall the meal was really good but not as it used to be a couple years ago. Just because of the onion soup, I removed one star.", "author": "Yannick B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-14", "description": "I've been to Cafe Claude two times in the past 4-6 months and have experienced extreme inadequacies in both food and service. Let me get right into it.\n\n1) One one occasion I ordered the Coq Au Vin. Everything about it was pretty delicious but, about half way through, I realized that there were no fingerling potatoes in the dish. So, I asked the waitress - \"Does the coq au vin come with fingerling potatoes?\" The reply - \"Yes! Does yours not have any?\" Me: \"No, no fingerling potatoes found.\" Her: \"Oh I'm so sorry about that!\" Then she walks away. I was expecting to receive some potatoes after that. Nope. Nothing and no further acknowledgement. Weird. \n\n2) We stood at the bar once while waiting for our party to arrive. I ordered a Manhattan. A couple sips in, I realize there are two floating gnats/flies in my drink. I discreetly let the bartender know. He quickly takes the drink away and five minutes later produces another Manhattan. He does not say \"Sorry\" at least once. No \"Terribly sorry about that! Your drink will be free of charge.\" There are a lot of people I know out there that would FREAK OUT after this - he was lucky I don't take much mind to such things. \n\n3) On another occasion I ordered the Faux Fillet. I ordered it Medium Rare and it came to me Medium Well. The steak was chewy and lacked flavor. The only thing good about the dish were the fries. \n\n4) Ordered the Steak Tartare - it was so heavy with mustard that I couldn't taste anything else. Good thing I was hungry and didn't mind so much. \n\n5) Service. Just some general thoughts here. It's not really a big deal, but it seems like a lot of the service people accidentally step on each others toes. Bussers will take some plates, the waiter a few, some people get waters, some don't. One person brings the bottled water, while another brings something else. It just seems a little amateur at times. \n\nDon't get me wrong though, there are definitely some great things about Cafe Claude, but they don't really make up for all the bad that has occurred. But, I'll mention them anyway!\n\nGood stuff - the live music is great. It's always very entertaining, but not too loud as to make it so ALL you're doing is listening to the music. It's still very easy to have a conversation. It's subtle, yet present. Despite my bad experience with the cocktail above, I really do think they mix up a great cocktail. I also really like their glassware. If anything, maybe Cafe Claude is a great place for a cocktail and a couple appetizers, or maybe a cocktail and desert. The service, despite a bit on the side of amateur, is very friendly. They are always smiling and charming. This is a joy. The ambiance is nice. I enjoy the lighting, the table settings and decorations. The outside seating is enjoyable. \n\nTo conclude - I will not be coming back to Cafe Claude for dinner. I won't be opposed to going if someone else plans a dinner there, but I won't be recommending it or going out of my way to eat there anytime soon!", "author": "Matt S."}

After looking for a while I found Caf\u00e9 Claude on Yelp. As it isn't on a Main Street we didn't just come across it, however it was well worth the detour. \n\nInside the restaurant you will be welcome with a warm cosy ambiance. It is very clean and warm with gentle lighting. The bare steel structure of the building adds spirit to the restaurant. \nMy mom chose the asparagus salad (salade d'asperges) while I went for one of my favorite salads, the ch\u00e8vre (commonly referred to as \"salade ch\u00e8vre chaud\" in France). On top of that, we ordered some charcuterie on the side. \nWe were both very pleased with our fresh, tasty salads. My ch\u00e8vre salad was definitely above par and as good if not better than many i've eaten in France. The charcuterie plate was good as well, it was more Italian than French but there is absolutely no problem with that.\nIn terms of service, we didn't have to wait at any point in time. The waiters had our full attention.\n\nIn the end, as two French people, we were impressed with the quality of the service as well as the food. I will definitely come back again, probably to taste the tartare as I am a big fan. I would definitely recommend Caf\u00e9 Claude to someone who wants to eat good French food at a very decent price. And I would classify the restaurant as above average in comparison to French restaurants.", "author": "Scott G."}

It's mostly just an excuse to wear really mismatched clothing and act bitchy to everyone I meet, but as any of my friends would tell you, I'm not really that mean. I just wish I was. Just like I wish I was truly french.\n\nThere is no better way to spend an afternoon than with someone who is very special and important to you. Drinks at a bar is one thing, but lunch is different. Perusing the menu and ordering a St. Germain cocktail, while wondering if a Sex on a St. Tropez Beach is as uncomfortable as the act itself sounds, you chat lightly about your friends and how Saveur had a wonderful issue about butter. After deciding on the soupe \u00e0 l'oignone, the conversation turns to why it's not more acceptable to just shovel food in your mouth because obviously, that is the most comforable for the two of us. We decide against it to spare the embarrassment of the establishment.\n\nAs the sandwiches are brought out, the things we complain about suddenly stop having so much impact; that yes, this in life shall pass as well, just like I will on the menu when I come here again with my pan poulet. Not to say that it wasn't good--the egg was different and the butter lettuce and mayonnaise was the perfect accoutrement to the bread's buttery outside, but the chicken itself was bland and unsavory. I'm almost positive that they have much better dishes on the menu. \n\nTypically this would have ended with a cigarette, coffee and dessert, but you can't smoke in restaurants anymore and I'm sure my dining companion wouldn't have appreciated me slowly killing his beautiful vocal chords with my bad habits. Instead, we shared a flourless chocolate cake with a vanilla bean creme anglaise, and a cafe au lait to sip along the way. \n\nI've mentioned this before: there was something *missing* in that cake. For some reason there has always been one ingredient that is left out--don't say flour, it's not that. One of my dear friends, a pastry chef, decided to make a recipe specifically for me so that it wouldn't miss anything; and it didn't. But it's worlds away from being sold in any restaurant, so for now this was the best subsitute. Two raw sugar packets in my coffee later, I am now completely ready to stay up all night.\n\nWhen we were done, a friend of his called and he mentioned a childhood story about how his friend would shove his face under the water in the pool. Then I shared the one about how my brother ran up to me while I was sitting down and farted on the back of my head and almost broke my neck doing it. My friend says, \"Well..with that kind of thing, there is that whole time issue.\"\n\nAnd this is how we know Jaime is truly supposed to be french; because there is nothing more classy than telling each other embarrassing stories from our childhood after a wonderful meal.", "author": "Jaime L."}

My friend, Greg, introduced me to this gem a few years ago, and am so grateful to him for doing so.\nThere's so much to love about Claude. It's in a hidden alley, with outdoor tables, and you feel like you are fine dining in Paris.\n\nWe had the cheese plate to start off with along with our bubbly (yup, ordered a whole bottle). I can't remember all of the cheeses, but my fav, of course, was the goat cheese. The basket of bread was finished almost immediately with the scrumptious cheesy goodness.\nMy entree was the 'flat iron steak, flamb\u00e9e au cognac, white wine, green peppercorn and gratin dauphinois.' The translation - abolutely, divinely DELISH! Steak was cooked to perfection (medium) and the sauce was so flavorful (and not salty), and the potatoes were scalloped and cheesy (double bonus).  \nThere was not a bite left on my plate... well, ok I lie, there were some green beans....\n\nOf course, for dessert was the creme brulee.

($10 appetizers, $25 entrees)\nFirst, when I asked about 2 wine choices, the waiter recommended the lesser-priced one \"Because it has more body and will pair better with the chicken.\" The down side?  Almost all of the wines are French and carry no description other than the name and region.  (No designation as a \"Pinot Noir\" or \"Cabernet\", etc.) But as I said, the waiter was quite helpful! $9-12 by the glass.\n\nThe escargot was good for beginners - a baked pastry version.  My wife and I, having sampled escargot at several restaurants (Including in France) were not impressed.  BUT...\n\nThe Chevre salad was INCREDIBLE. A variation on the \"spinach, apple and walnut\" salad, this is a must-try if you like the normal versions.\n\nMy wife ordered Coq Au Vin (chicken in a wine sauce) and it was delicious (dark meat).  I had the \"pork  in apple cider\" - I always order pork as my wife isn't fond of it so we never have it at home - and this was the best I've ever had. Highly recommended.\n\nThis restaurant is not exactly \"quiet\", but still romantic.  That could be because we were in the same room as the bar.  There are 3 separate dining areas:  The bar area, the side room, and outside in the alley!  (The heat lamps are excellent, I hear.)\n\nOh - and the jazz singer was excellent, too.

Just then the Manager appeared from the back with our checks and made a snippy comment towards our group and having to make change for some cash.\n\nAfter almost $100/person, we all felt the food was lovely but service made for a disappointing experience.

Lacking in flavor for French Onion, but the porc and Cauliflower soup made up for it, at least for me. Just make sure you get the right dishes (according to Yelp, I guess?)  and make little room for dessert because it's a great way to finish off the meal. \n\nIt's located in a little alley that looks like it came right out of an alleyway in Paris. The outdoor seating looked nice but we opted for indoor seating. I came here on a Sunday night with my family, and we had already made reservations, but it was not too busy and we were seated immediately. The ambiance is warm and nice, and we missed the only day that they don't play live jazz (darn!). Many people just had jeans and regular shirts on. Being a teenager, I thought it would be too grownup for me, but it wasn't extremely weird. Our waiter was super nice too.\n\nWe ordered the cauliflower soup (not on the menu), French Onion Soup, and the Truffle Mouse for appetizers. Cauliflower soup was amazing, but the French Onion wasn't the greatest. A bit of a muddled salty taste, but its hard to compare after having that soup in France. I also prefer Gruyere cheese, not Swiss. Also, my parents liked the one at Cafe Central better. I personally loved the Truffle Mousse, so full of flavor and a great combo with the dijon mustard and little pickles. \n\nI got the cider brined tenderloin. Had an amazing jus and the pork was moist and flavorful; probably the best dish I've had in a while. My sister got the salmon with Israeli couscous. The salmon was lacking in flavor, but the couscous tasted great. My dad got the lamb sirloin medium-well (we don't like pink meat too much). It was a bit dry, but had good flavor. The chickpeas and vegetables were a bit odd, but tasted pretty good. My mom got the coq au vin (chicken w/red wine, bacon, etc). She wasn't too crazy about it, and didn't really expect the chicken to be on bone, but the sauce was really flavorful. \n\nDessert was moelleux au chocolate (flourless chocolate cake). Perfect amount for the 4 of us after being super full from appetizers and entrees. \n\nI'm not sure if I would come here again, not because the food was bad, but because I would like to experiment with different restaurants.

We sat outside in the alley, but honestly, the atmosphere of this place made me feel like I was in a cafe in the back streets of Paris. This place really knows how to pull it off. It wasn't just a run of mill type of place either. Our waitress spoke to us in English with a really heavy French accent (not that I or anyone in our party minded - it is the language of love). It really added to the feel of the place.\n\nThe place was quite fancy, but did not have that snobby attitude that most places that rank high in the fancy mark are diseased with. Brulee, souffle, just about anything was ordered for our dessert and it was more than eagerly shared among my dessert companions. \n\nI'm not really a dessert person, but this place opened my eyes more to the possibility of enjoying dessert. Especially how it was made, how everything tasted. My Creme Brulee even had fresh raspberries and it was just one of the best ever. \n\nI would highly recommend this place for desserts and light drinks.

And similarly, the fare is some of the stuff you'd see at that cafe - onion soup, frisee salad, cheese & charcuterie, escargot, scallops, pasta, trout, and other standard fare.\n\nBut the food isn't cafe-standard. It's definitely cooked by a chef with creativity in the air.\n\nMy beet salad was the dish of the night. Chioggia beets (red/white striped) are cooked gently, sliced thinly and served over a blue cheese creme fraiche puree that's to die for. Garnish with chopped hazelnuts & tarragon and your taste buds will thank you. (The menu says there's banyuls somewhere in this; maybe in the puree?)\n\nMy charcuterie plate was what you'd expect. No surprises here, though the tastes were very nice & balanced.\n\nMy scallops were terrific. I'll let you read the menu (mornay sauce as primary feature), but I eat - and cook - a LOT of scallops, and this preparation will definitely rank high on the list. VERY tenderly done scallops, the cheese sauce very light & fluffy, fresh mushrooms adding great texture & flavor. Just good.\n\nI ordered an Aviation cocktail; not on the menu, but the bartender got it right. And a 1/2 carafe of a good rose wine that went well.\n\nThe female waitstaff & hostess all appear to be France natives, which lends a really nice feel to the place. The server I had was very happy & friendly, and gladly assisted me with my poor attempts to use as much of my \"tourist french\" as I could when ordering (just for fun). The table (bus) person was also nice, and very quick to fulfill my requests for things like a couple extra toasts for the charcuterie (which is important to do fast when you're actively eating).\n\nI'd go back here anytime. The menu isn't huge, and isn't \"grand cuisine\".

So, I started off smitten.\n\nAs is appropriate in a French restaurant, the waiter was attentive, efficient, and just polite enough. He seemed to be there just when we wanted him.\n\nFor the three of us, this stop was more about catching up with long lost friends. However, good food is always a compliment to great company, right?\n\nMy bf ordered steak tartare. That was a bit of a risk. Perhaps he was feeling the romance in the air. After all, a good steak tartare is fantastic. A bad one...well, fortunately this was a good one. While it wasn't amazing, it was classic, fresh, and nicely plated. All of the appropriate accoutrements were there and plentiful. Perhaps a higher grade of beef would have pushed this over the top.\n\nI ordered the pork filet with carmelized apples, white balsamic vinegar, and honey cream sauce. The filet was moist, cooked evenly, and obviously paired beautifully with the apples. \n\nThis is traditional French cuisine prepared and served just like it should be. I am a bit biased after having eaten many times at a local bistro that is simply astounding. So, really, I'd like to give this place 3.5 stars. \n\nAmbiance, a hideaway location, proper French food...this is a lovely place for a date or a chat with a friend whose company you have missed for years.", "author": "Lori M."}

Our waitress recommended the Quiche Lorraine to me since I wasn't in the mood to eat something hearty. She said it was her favorite and I trusted her judgment. Let me tell you it was SUPERB! It's the size of a small candy dish and it was very moist on the inside, with a nice flaky crust on the outside. It came with a light side of mixed greens. Quite easily the best light lunch I've had in a while. The rest of the folks enjoyed their Croque Madame (a staple at any French restaurant) which was not bad.

The service was really friendly and professional. The decor is appropriate but you can see it's a bit aged. The food was ok, my warm chevre salad was correct, salve for having my cheese served on slices of bread instead of a warm slice of breaded chevre itself, as the menu stated (I don't eat bread so this was a surprise). Tartare seemed a little different from my expectations ( this is obviously a personal preference), but fresh and you could mix it yourself with a variety of condiments. The glass of cremant was a little expensive at $14, and also, I have ordered another wine but was too hungry and in a hurry to exchange.

Today, I ventured out of the typical SF cold into the welcoming warmth of Cafe Claude.  \n\nFirst off, Claude Lane is just PACKED with beautiful, exciting looking restaurants!  I went into the cafe at about 5pm to find that the tables out front were set but empty, inside seemed about the same with two French accented men chatting amicably over a couple of pints at the beautiful bar.  I asked the pleasant bar tender if it would be ok for me to take a table for just a coffee while I studied and he smiled and said I could use one of the two up front in the window.  It was cozy, charming and perfectly suited to my needs!  The coffee itself was ok: I got a cafe au lait which was a little watery, but it came with a dark chocolate square, which I liked.  \n\nI studied, undisturbed until about 6:30.  By then lots of people had ambled in for drinks and dinner and it was getting pretty noisy.  Not unpleasantly so for a restaurant, but a bit much for concentrating on my assignment.  \n\nAs I got up, the lead maitr'd or manager (couldn't tell) asked me if I'd like to stay for dinner and explained that there would soon be live jazz.  She further elaborated that from now on there would be jazz every night, and not just a few nights a week.  I thanked her ~ her hospitality was warm and genuine ~ but declined.

I had meant to go there in a long time, and I picked the right occasion to give it a try - what a captivating place!\n\nThe restaurant is relatively small, with a nice patio area. The interior looked more appealing to me, with its dimmed lighting, jazz band playing and sensual decor. We sat at the very back of the restaurant, where we could still enjoy the music, but at the same time carry a good conversation comfortably. Yes, that was the most important thing as we had a lot to catch up on.\n\nI ordered a glass of Sancerre, a French white that went really well with the special: seafood risotto. What an entrancing experience! Maybe it was the fact that I had the worst seafood risotto in my life a week before (see previous review), or maybe it was the ambiance or circumstance. But all I can say is 'wow'! The perfect texture, the perfect flavors, fabulous presentation!\n\nBig ordered the Truit Aux Amandes (pan-seared trout, almonds, white mushroom lemon sauce, fingerling potatoes, romano beans). His dish was also delish, and although he was a little hesitant about going to a French restaurant, he was really happy with my suggestion. ;-) \n\nThe service was attentive, and I really appreciated that they gave us time to just enjoy our meal and conversation without interruptions.

The waiters are definitely French, which brings you even closer to France.  With seating inside and out, the place does tend to fill up during the weekday lunch crowd.\n\nStarting off, they are generous with their bread and I agree, it's yummy. I couldn't stop eating it either.  I chose the Pan Poulet  ($10) - roasted chicken breast, tomatoes, butter lettuce, egg, mayonnaise, and mixed green salad.  The sandwich was on a Ciabatta type bread and it was average.  The dressing on the salad was nice and tastier than the sandwich unfortunately.  My companion had the Quiche Lorraine  ($8.50) - pate feuillete, crme fraiche, bacon, and egg.  We also shared the Tarte Tatin ($6) - upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  The dessert was simple, I had hoped for a little bit more sweetness or a wow factor.  \n\nOverall, the food was decent, service was fine. Nothing really spectacular or horrendous either.  Perhaps their other dishes might fare better.", "author": "Teri C."}

I was assured it didn't.\nWhen the dish was brought out, i could smell the onion before it was even set in front of me.\nThe server was fairly nice about it, and the chef offered to make me a new one, sans onion. I was impressed by this, and excited to try the dish.\nUnfortunately, the dish just didn't work for me. The goat cheese totally overpowered the tuna, and the quail egg added nothing to it whatsoever.\nI still held out hope for the entree portion of the meal.\nAnother let down....I had the Truite aux Amandes. I've had the equivalent of this dish at several other places, (all of them doing a better job with it.)\nThe dish had no taste, no real flavor at all. I rarely complain about food being too bland ,but this definitely was.\n\nAfter the replacement appetizer, the service was lacking.\nWe were never asked if we wanted another drink, or bread refilled. (We didn't want either one, but it's still proper service to be asked.)\n\nWhen someone brought out our drinks at the beginning of the evening, we practically had to flag her down after watching her offer our drinks to another table.\n\nWe decided to skip dessert, nothing looked very interesting.

Seriously, you'll pay a lot more at the \"other\" French restaurant up the street, and you won't get nearly the quality of food or service.

Other standouts include the steak tartare (which I wouldn't dare to eat most places) made fresh tableside, the seared Ahi tuna Nicoise salad (which surpasses anything you'll find in France), and any of the special pastas at lunch.\n\nThe wine list is a little pricey (two glasses of $15 Chardonnay will cost more than your meal) but well selected.

We had reservations at 6, but because of the rain and traffic on 101, we got there at 7.  They were really kind about serving us outside, and I think it was better out there.  This place is pretty popular (they make reservations in two hour intervals as in you can only stay and enjoy for two hours before the next party needs your spot) so it was packed with people at every table.  We sat outside with umbrellas and a canopy protecting us from the mist/rain and a heater beaming down on us.  The whole setting was romantic because everything was beginning to get dim, and by the time we got there and got seated, the jazz band started to play.\n\nI'm not a French food connoisseur, but definitely hope to be one day, but Cafe Claude has definitely expanded my fondness over French cuisine.  I recommend the iron steak and the pork filet.  My friend ordered the stead it was succulent.  It was so tender and juicy.  I got the pork filet and, I'm not usually a pork fan, but having a bite of the pork and apple and caramel/honey sauce was really really good.  I believe I should order pork more often.  The service was very attentive and extremely cordial.  I had Hemingway's death in the afternoon cocktail special and soon found out that I don't like it.  The substituted it with the cabernet sauvignon and was extremely happy with the flavor mix with the pork.\n\nWhile I was enjoying my food, chatting with my friends, and listening to the band, I took a glance at our location.  It's typically a Parisian alley where there's pretty much a road for one car to get through, but instead of a road, it's restaurant patios.  There was a street light that glowed a golden orange from above, people walking by, keeping snug and under umbrellas, next to the stone building right next to our spot, and thought, this somewhat feels like a French restaurant in France with a bunch of American tourist.\n\nMy dinner with my friends was terrific.

We did our research here on yelp and picked this placed based on the great reviews. We had a great day prior to coming here: relaxed at our lovely hotel on Union Square, then went for a walk, visited Neiman Marcus for high tea and got our make up done  there as well, bought out new outfits and headed out for dinner and  jazz. We love jazz!\n\nWe arrived about 5 minutes early for our reservation. We got seated promptly. The place looked cozy and not yet filled in with people. Our server came by a few minutes later. It took a few minuted to read the menu. The drink menu was not too exciting and I could not see what I can actually order from there, so we decided to order salad and soup at least  since we already took a few minuted to read the menus. The server came by the second time to ask what we want to order for the main course. We each ordered a dish, but then (I saw another server holding a huge salad \"por moi\") I asked if we can please just have one chicken dish because I really wanted to save room for desserts later.\n While looking at the menus at the beginning I felt very rushed and embarrassed. The server never smiled or even introduced himself and just looked plain bothered to talk to us. Meanwhile we are sitting there like two polite Californians  (idiots, we should have complained) and smiled back with every question or reply. For my drink I ended up getting just a lemon drop for the lack of other interesting choices and felling of being rushed. When my salad arrived with a side of goat cheese covered toast, I thought that glass of red wine would actually go wonderfully with it, so I also asked our server for a glass of Bordeaux. .....hmm 5 minutes later I am still guarding my salad and goat cheese toast for the arrival of the wine..... another 5 min later a manger comes by and somehow misunderstands that I am waiting for a glass of wine and brings a glass of water instead...ok, I can see the confusion: I already have a lemon drop in front of me, it is a bit loud and hard to hear, but I also have a glass of water TOO! Besides, it is very simple to just repeat the guest's request back so there is no miscommunication. Whatever! The manager realizes that there has been a little mistake and promised so come back with a glass of wine.....  My poor salad is getting tired!... hmm  another 5 minutes passes ...a hostess brings my wine. All the while our server is passing back and forth by our table without a worry in his face, probably because he is not even looking our way... FINALLY I enjoy my goat cheese and wine! Needless to say that the main dish arrived before I can finish my salad. The server literally just puts it in front of my friend and walks away. She catches him before he leaves and asks for a share plate (although we did say that we want to share). If you are constant restaurant goer, enjoy good food and appreciate and respect a good service ...you probably don't need to read beyond this point. \"Nuff said!\n\nHe brings the share plate with such a face that I just want to say \"I am sorry\" right away... not sure for what, but...maybe it was my hair, or my friend's hair... don't know. At least it seemed that other guest's hairdo were somewhat approved by our server (we did see him smiling! Aha!). My lovely dear friend who is so quiet, sweet and polite, and always smiling - she says to me \"I am sorry, I feel like maybe we did or said something wrong?\" Besides of my turmoil building inside, we really didn't feed into the bad mood - we were just happy to get together and enjoy our evening. The chicken dish was ok, When the plate was cleared the server comes back and  drops the check on our table \"Thanks.\" \n...................................................................ok.....I clearly remember saying that we were saving room for dessert. It is still at least an hour before closing... WHAT IS YOUR DEAL ,\"DONKEY HOLE\"? Oh, yes, of course we would like some coffee, thanks for NOT asking. REALLY? Management told you that you should not ask your guests if they want some desserts of coffee? REALLY? REALLY?\n\nRight there I pulled my phone out, called the KULETOS restaurant to see what time they close and if we could come in for dessert. \n\nYou know guys, I usually can't leave a place without leaving 20% tip ...I REGRET that I left 10. KULETOS was absolutely lovely!", "author": "Anastasia B."}

The ambience is amazing and the food is top notch. \n\nWe were seated immediately when we arrived and started off with drinks.

Now don't get me wrong, our relationship status has nothing to do with this.  We just so happened were planning to catch up since he was in town (and nothing more than that if you were thinking so... haha) and a lot of the places we considered were closing because we had to go after I got off work and so we were thinking of a great place around the downtown area.  We both agreed that we would LOVE to find that French restaurant we went to for lunch back when we were dating and since I remembered what street it was on but not the name, I simply googled \"french restaurant by bush street\" and this place came up on top.  I was 100% it was the place because the name sounded so familiar so we gave it a try! Didn't take long to find parking (thank goodness) and we saw the nostalgic ally way it hides in and we were SO happy! They weren't too busy either so we were able to get seats pretty fast.  You would not believe how nostalgic that place was to us.  It was definitely a different setting and some decorations were different (I mean, come on, it's been YEARS since the last time we were both here) but we had so much fun recalling where we were sitting, what was around, and etc.  \n\nSo a few years ago we came here for lunch and ordered some sandwiches with pommes frites which are delicious.  I love thin fries and it's what they serve here.  This time around, we were here for dinner and I seriously wanted to try everything. We started off with the pommes frites of course and escargot (the last time I had it was in France so I had some expectations of it).  The escargot did NOT disappoint me at all.  It tasted so similar to the one I had in France at Le Zeyer but they added fromage on top which I thought was such an interesting touch, which made it all the more amazing! I believe I ordered the Confit De Canard that night and my date had the Coq Au Vin.  I seriously loved that duck.  The texture was exquisite and I'm REALLY picky when it comes to food texture, but it was on point.  Trust me, this night was amazing with the food and atmosphere and I guess my date too ;)  And of course, I cannot end a french dinner without cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e! A-may-zingggg! I mean, it's not the best I've had but I just love cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e hehe I will definitely come back again and I recommend anyone to try this place!", "author": "Lisa L."}

By reasonably priced, I don't mean cheap.  On the other hand, they won't bend you over and break the bank like other French restaurants.  Plus, the food is fantastic.  The caf\u00e9 is tuck away in a narrow alley bordering Union Square and the FiDi.  They have a delightful patio that is great on warm, sunny days - heat lamps make it bearable during the chilly San Francisco days.  Inside you'll find an elegant but casual atmosphere.  Dinners are always lively, though the dining room is never too loud to enjoy a pleasant conversation with your dining companions.  \n\nFor dinner, we skipped wine and went straight to charcuterie.  Our first course was their pate plate, a choice of their three house made pates.  We went with the rillette du perigord, sauterne mousse, and truffle mouse.  The rillette was made with shredded duck meat and duck fat.  Honestly, it was my least favorite because it conflicted so much with the other selections.  The sauterne was quite nice.  This combination of chicken liver, truffles, and cepes had a sweet aftertaste and a pleasant texture.  The truffle mousse was outstanding.  Deep, rich, and creamy, the truffle carried an beautiful low note that lingered, enticing you to make spread after spread.  \n\nNext came a petit plat de escargot en croute.  Holy butter bandit batman!  These vehicles for butter, garlic and salt made me roll me eyes into the back of my head as I groaned \"oooooooooooohhhhhhhhhh!.\"  The snails are served sans pesky shells, reducing the mess of having to pick those pesky buggers apart.\n\nOur entr\u00e9e was their special of the day, duck leg confit with braised chard and fingerling potatoes.  Damn!  Tender, succulent, moist - the duck leg melted away in your mouth.  The rich sauce, a beautiful, dark and deep broth, made me want to lick my plate clean.  The chard was cooked to perfection and the potatoes were little buttery starch balls.  For sh*ts and giggles we tried the pommes frites - fresh, crunchy and delicious.  \n\nCaf\u00e9 Claude is delightful restaurant with great service and fantastic food.  I will definitely be back again and I can't wait to try their sister restaurant Gitane in the near future.", "author": "Thomas S."}

We arrive here Saturday night 7 ish and waited at the bar for only 20 mins. Sat us at a table right outside the band which was good since we didn't have to deal with the crowd. My date and I ordered the duck, rustic lasagna, sweet pea soup and the liver spread platter and it was all amazing. To top it off they made in mistake in sending us potatoes au gratin but the waitress said no charge. Inside the decor is laid back not too flashy, the only thing I would worry about is coming in too late and wait for a long time. Sure its a little pricey but you are in the city at night for your average worker.

We originally wanted to come here last year, but we booked too late and this restaurant couldn't accommodate us.  Now that we're smarter now and booked ahead of time, we are both very excited to dine here in a few weeks.  I booked online on 1/13 through yelp for a table at around 6 pm.  My boyfriend and I love jazz music, which was main reason why we chose this place.  Plus, the food looks amazing via yelp photos (Thanks guys!! :D), and the decor looks great.  Through their website, it stated that jazz music starts at 7:30 pm.  I thought that since our reservation was around 6 pm, we would probably only listen to about 30 minutes of jazz music (which is better than none).  However, I received a call the next day (1/14) from a woman who wanted to confirm my reservation for Valentine's Day.  She also called to tell me that Cafe Claude will be doing a prix fixe menu that day.  The menu has not been finished yet, but will be posted online by 1/25.  She was very nice and answered all of my questions (I had a lot because I wanted Valentine's Day to be perfect; who can blame me? lol).  One of my questions was regarding the jazz music (because I thought we would only hear 30 minutes of it).  She told me that on Valentine's Day, the band would play at 6:30 pm instead of the usual 7:30 pm.  I was so happy because now my boyfriend and I get to enjoy the music that we both love while eating.  I also asked about the seating because I wasn't sure if I had the option to choose either to sit outside or inside the restaurant.  She told me (again, very nicely) that since we had made a reservation, we are automatically to be seated inside unless we want to sit outside.  All in all, she deserves 5 stars for her awesome service (and patience) with me, and both my boyfriend and I are very excited to enjoy our dinner on Valentine's Day.", "author": "Diana H."}

As we approached, the narrow alley, outdoor seating under an awning, and the cute Vespas parked outside immediately made me feel incredibly nostalgic for Europe.\nWe were seated outside, directly under one of the heaters, which was perfect since the evening was typically San Francisco-chilly.\n\nWe each ended up ordering Egalites for our drinks and an order of pomme frites for a starter.  The fries came to us hot and crispy, and also delightfully light!  I wish I knew the secret to creating such a perfect potato product! *swoon*\n\nI had the pork medallions while my friend opted for the salmon special.  I will honestly say it was the best pork I've had to date.  It was incredibly tender and flavorful, and I used crusty bread to sop up every last delicious drop of sauce.  My friend's salmon was equally wonderful - the combination of herbs on the salmon provided such a fresh and flavorful taste.\n\nDuring dinner, the food came quickly, and the waiter was attentive without being annoying.\n\nI'm sorry to say that we didn't have room for dessert.  'Tis a sin, and one that I'll have to rectify the next time I'm in town.", "author": "Christine G."}

So, all in all the atmosphere was wonderful.  \n\nI started with the french onion soup which I can safely say is over 50% cheese and crouton.  I'm not complaining, because, well, who complains about cheese and crusty bread?  But it could use a little more broth.  Wow, I can't even believe I just asked for more broth.  \n\nNext I had the beet salad which was perfection.  I happen to love everything about beets (other than the stain they leave on your teeth, napkin and sometimes clothing).  The cheese in the salad was nom nom nom.  \n\nIt is a very nice lunch spot that I certainly recommend.", "author": "Amy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-07-16", "description": "My husband and I went here for le Quatorze Juillet. Though the festivities for this event were a disappointment, the restaurant was a good find. Some people find it nifty that this restaurant is in an alleyway but I don't but hey, the world isn't revolved around me! I can't really give 5 stars to any restaurant but this place comes close to quality french cuisine. It's the best we've had since we moved here from France. (please note we've only tried a good handful).\n\nTo start, my husband ordered for our party of 6 an Haut M\u00e9doc. Comme je ne bois pas d'alcool, il m'a dit que c'\u00e9tait une tr\u00e8s bonne bouteille. To keep us from dying of hunger, they kept us calm with fresh bread and hurriedly brought us our plate of escargots topped with gratin. It was perfect btw! Then only reason we didn't want to wipe it clean was because we wanted to save room in our bellies!\n\nI then ordered the pork with gratin on the side and my husband ordered steak with fries and the gratin as well, being that it is one of our favorites side dishes. For dessert, we shared the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e and it was very scrumptious. Everything was very high quality. The pork was a bit undercooked for my taste but even if, I ate every last bite. I had a bite of my husband's steak and the sauce was just right, not too rich not too bland. Our waiter was french and spoke french to us and english to our vegetarian friends. (We'll make it a habit not to bring them along with us next time we go to a french restaurant being that two of them only ordered fries and a salad, this resto is not vegan friendly). Anyway, we always enjoy it when we can have a nice convo in french with our waiter without the parisian attitude. The location is alright. I had to park in the garage nearby but it wasn't too pricey. The staff was also very professional and kept their cool even if the noise made it hard to hear. \n\nThe down side was that the decor was a bit average. Not at all tacky just boring and predictable. Having worked near la tour eiffel and seeing it daily, I'm sick of seeing it plastered everywhere outside of France. I know it is the symbol of France but there is much more to France than the tower and I think for those who have never been, it would definitely be appreciated if those best kept secrets were to be shared. Anyway, I feel that they could have been more creative with that. It's quite noticeable because the place is a bit small (to no fault of their own) and (I don't know if it was because of Bastille Day but it was crowded. I guess for all these reasons it didn't give you much of the desire to want to hang around longer than you needed to). \n\nI will sum it up by saying my husband and I both agreed that despite the price for the wine and being just a bit jipped for the price for the food in comparison to what you could find in a little brasserie tucked away in Paris for a more reasonable price, we'll take into consideration that this SF and say we're definitely coming back and are sure to be regulars (ou bien, pour ceux qui parlent fran\u00e7ais: les habitu\u00e9s) ! \n\nau fait, c'est dommage que les prix sont un peu chers, on aimerait bien y aller plus souvent.. !", "author": "Lana I."}

We gave up, parked in Chinatown, came close to hitting a motorcyler who tried to steal our spot (but we both fit), and wandered towards Union Square.  Cafe Claude was located  near Banana Republic, around the corner of Loehmann's, and in an alley where no cars could get through.  You better not get lost!\n\nThe space is tight with many small tables.  It is also loud, so no need to keep a hush hush voice.  Foodwise, I recommend the beef tartare, and let them mix it for you.  Do not mix it yourself, that would be bad.  It's not as good as Jeanty's *sniff*, but probably the best one in the city now that it's competitor left.

We went here on a Saturday night and it was still a bit early (6pm) so the restaurant was just getting cozy and chatty with people.  The server came within seconds offered us water and drinks.  We were studying the menu for quite a few minutes and the server took our orders - we got a filet mignon, a tuna dish, a pork tenderloin dish and of course...the steak tartare (I've done some prior research and found that this seemed to be the signature dish).\n\nThe food came pretty fast - I'd say in 10 minutes, so that was always pleasant for a person such as myself who's born impatient.  The steak tartare was prepared tableside and looked delicious - and it tasted delicious.  I'd say if I had to compare this to the Bistro Jeanty steak tartare, this tasted much more light, smooth and tangy.  I still do like the bistro jeanty tartare, but if i had to choose, i'd go with the cafe claude tartare...\n\nThen the dessert round - we shared a thing of the tarte tatin and the creme brulee.  Creme brulee is just one of those desserts that i don't get into so i wasn't blown away by it.  The tarte tatin was good and cleanly prepared, but I am not sure that it was mind blowing either...Compared to the entrees, I feel as if the restaurant had some room for improvement in the dessert department.  \n\nOverall, service was pleasant and efficient, the food was great and the ambiance was also very good - we stuck around for a little bit of the live jazz performance and it was such a nice touch to end the evening!\n\nConclusion:  Will definitely return to this joint to satisfy my steak tartare cravings!", "author": "Mike P."}

It's been 2.5 months since I went to this place) for us since I was so clueless. She REALLY took her time even though she saw me drooling. After 4 mins (yes, I timed her), I finally got to eat it.

But break out of your hypnosis, and treasures like Cafe Claude will gradually reveal themselves to you. \n\nThis restaurant has the atmosphere of an authentic Parisian bistro, and the food to match. I went with the moms and one of her friends after work one evening. We had a nice citrusy bottle of Chablis to set the foundation for the meal. We started with a delicious -- I mean, unusually flavorful -- beet salad, plated in the fashion of a poke or tartar. We followed with delicious, simple \"salades de la maison\", which I believe were butter lettuce or some similar leaf that the chef had dressed in a very spare but holy-schnikes-delicious mustard vinaigrette, with a little diced tomato and some herbs on top. \n\nMy entree was outstanding -- a simple vegetarian lasagna with bechamel. It was light and pillowy with the right balance of savory from the tomato and veggies and sweetness from the cheese. A true winner.  The rest of the table had the trout, which got high marks as well. \n\nDessert was an apple tart that I strongly recommend (served a la mode, of course). And, no joke, this might have been the best coffee I've ever had. Just get a plain old cup of decaf and resist the urge to load it with sugar and cream -- I swear this coffee tasted sweet and rich served black. \n\nOh yes, and the live music on Thursdays is perfect.

I always choose arugula :) \n\nThe tuna nicose salad is really good but depending on how you like your tuna. I like mines seared and this one is a bit cooked. So make sure you state your preference. \n\nI HIGHLY recommend the Gratin Dauphinois - sliced potatoes, gooey cheese and herbs so rich and creamy. Tastes great with the complimentary french bread.   \n\nYou cant leave this place without having dessert! My top three favorites are:\n- chocolate moose (so light and fluffy - comes with a cigarette cookie) \n- Cr\u00e8me Coconut (flan - not too sweet and very light and refreshing)\n- Creme Brulee (its on STERIODS! - HUGE so good! I suggest sharing with a friend.\n\nService wise its a hit or miss. \n\nBe prepared to be in a dim light room and tables are really really close to each other.", "author": "Rose L."}

Sweetbreads for hors d'oeuvres.

I arrived with four co-workers for lunch and we were offered seating in the covered outdoor area. Although it was chilly outside, the heaters were working so we were reasonably comfortable. Our server arrived after about 10 minutes to take our drink orders. I asked for hot tea and when it arrived the water was tepid.  Another in our group requested a glass of water and had to ask for it twice over a lengthy period. It took about 30 minutes before our server came to take our food orders, then over 45 minutes on top of that before the food arrived.  With one steak frites order the steak was practically raw (only seared on top) and had to be sent back twice before it was cooked enough. My quiche Lorraine was watery.  Someone else's fries were saturated in oil. When we brought the raw steak issue to the manager's attention, he did give us a credit on our bill, which is why I'm giving this review 2 stars instead of 1.  I'd like to give Cafe Claude the benefit of the doubt on this visit and think that they were having an off day. Hopefully that was the case.", "author": "Judy J."}

Tucked back away from the loud main street, it's a must try for city goers. \n\nI took the birthday girl here for a little dinner. We strolled in without reservations and totally lucked out. They had one table available- YES! We were even entertained by the live jazz band. It's brilliant that they funnel the music on speakers throughout the restaurant. \n\nThe birthday girl had the French Martini which was *SO* yummy. I ordered the Hemingway's Death in the Afternoon (Absinthe and sparkling wine). It tasted just like black licorice. That would be fantastic if I liked black licorice but I don't. I knew I wasn't going to be able to finish it so I asked if I could get a glass of wine instead. Our server obliged and I was content with my perfectly dry yet crisp glass of Sancerre. I wasn't charged for the black licorice which was even better. \n\nOnion soup - I'm not a big fan of onion soup but this experience has changed that.. I'm sure this is how onion soup should taste. Perfect!\n\nPasta of the day - penne with tuna, salmon, cherry tomatoes and olives. Such a light and refreshing summer pasta dish. We also tried the Truffle Fries with an aioli dipping sauce and they were scrumptious. \n\nWe noticed that the back up servers to our main server gave us more love and genuine attention. In busy restaurants this is usually the case. Luckily our server was a hottie and had the sexiest accent ever. So I won't hold his server short comings against him.\n\nI totally feel like I hit the jack pot when I find places like Cafe Claude. Unique, quaint and full of charm.

He had the French 75 and I had the Fraternite. The French 75 was pretty good, and had a strong wine taste/smell. On the other hand, I thought the Fraternite was absolutely amazing. The alcohol taste was minimal, and didn't taste very strong, but it definitely was quite strong. I have low tolerance and I already felt a buzz before I was even halfway through my drink. Smells amazing too - can definitely detect the pear liquor in it.\n\nHad bay scallops as an appetizer and it was so, so delicious!! We shared it and we were sad that it was gone so quickly. Boyfriend ordered the Coq au Vin as the entree and I ordered the Truite. The Coq au Vin was definitely the winner here. Boyfriend started using the bread to soak up the remaining sauce so he could keep savoring it. The Truite was good, but not overwhelmingly exceptional. The greens that came with it was delicious though, and so were the lentils! Skipped on dessert because there wasn't anything on the dessert menu that we felt extremely compelled to order.\n\nOverall, service was decent, and our waiter checked up on us a few times, though we did have to flag him down to get more bread and the dessert menu because he didn't come around for a while, but I think that was mostly because they were slightly understaffed. The waitress explained to us that they only had two servers that night so they were trying to be careful not to overwhelm them. That said, the only available walk-in seating was outside, so be sure to make a reservation!\n\nWonderful experience :]", "author": "Sharlene C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-09-21", "description": "Classic, romantic, unpretentious french food tucked away in an alley near Belden Place. The ambiance is warm, the service friendly, and the food (while not particularly fancy) is done very well. Bistro food at its best.\n\nMy boyfriend and I started with the rillettes du perigord - duck meat prepared confit style with french mustard, salad, and cornichon garnishes. My entree was the porc au miel, which was absolutely amazing. The pork was tenderly cooked to perfection in a honey-cream sauce with a white balsamic vinegar reduction and a side of haricots verts. I'm not usually a fan of sweet entrees, but with a glass of Vouvray Sec, the pork managed to balance the sweet and savory flavors of the plate wonderfully. My boyfriend had one of the daily specials - a tomato-based fish stew with ahi, mussels, and scallops, which he thoroughly enjoyed. For dessert we shared the mousse au chocolat with fresh whipped cream, which was a bit traditional, yet ultimately satisfying.\n\nThey have a good wine list, as well as house cocktails creatively combining french ingredients - pastis, elderflower liquer,  and sancerre, to name a few.\n\nThe service was friendly and the atmosphere welcoming. The reason for my one-star deduction was for the poor timing of the drinks - despite ordering everything at the beginning, our cocktails arrived after we'd already finished our appetizers and our wine after we were about 1/3 done with our entree. The waitress was nice and apologized on behalf of the bartender, but the timing was a bit of a bummer.\n\nOverall, a great find near the usually tourist-y Union Square area.", "author": "Britt M."}

The restaurant was 90% full when we arrived on time and we were seated right away.  Service was excellent.  Our server was very attentive and had a cheerful smile.  Throughout the whole night, our glasses were never out of water and empty plates got removed in a timely manner.  Also, it always adds some cuteness to a restaurant when there is live jazz band. \n\nWe ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees and 2 desserts.  Appetizers we had the Cod and Potato Souffle and Frisee salad with Bacon and Poached Egg.  Both were delicious and came in good size.  The souffle tasted like a fluffier version of a potato puff but it was not heavy at all.  The frisee salad was a great way to work up the appetite, given that the vinaigrette dressing was very refreshing and simple enough to prepare your tastebuds for the upcoming flavorful entrees.  \n\nWe picked Saturday's special, the Lamb Shank, and the Trout for our entrees.  Again, they came in good portion, not a big dish but just enough for fill the stomach.  The Lamb Shank was perfectly cooked.  Meat fell off bone once the fork stuck in.  It was very flavorful.  The trout was neatly done, with it being folded open and sauteed on the side with the skin.  Bone was all taken out.  The buttery and lemony flavors from the sauce kept the fish fulfilling but also refreshing to the stomach and the taste.  For desserts, we went for the cream brulee and the chocolate mousse.  They were no surprise compared to the standard cream brulee and chocolate mousse, but we liked them more than the others because they were a little less-sweet relatively.\n\nWhat we did not like about this restaurant was that, the dining room could get pretty stuffy and warm, maybe a little too warm.  The dining room also wasn't very spacious and tables were kinda close, with a full bar and a 3-people jazz band.  Noise level was moderate to loud, with the live music and all the chattering.\n\nOverall, this was still a cute and quality restaurant to go for a romantic date or intimate couple dinner.", "author": "Charcoal B."}

Good wine, prices not cheap but fair for the quality and quantity.\nI used yelp reviews to select this restaurant and am glad I did. It is not easy to find since it is at the end of a little alley or side street and not really on a main drag, but the search is rewarded by the find of this great place to eat. The food is really excellent and the wine list extensive and widely varied. I ate outside which is not the most charming of surroundings, but the beautiful San Francisco evening (they have two or three of them every year) made it silly to eat inside (and it was full anyway). I had the marinaded chicken which is served in a nice juice or sauce and accompanied by vegetables, much like a stew. It was superb! The herbs and spices used blended to create a flavor that was a work of art and a reminder of why the French are famous for their cooking. When I first ran my eyes over the price list, I debated leaving (I am a retiree on a fixed and dwindling budget), but am very, very glad I decided to stay. I chose a wine I did not care for as much as I had hoped, but that just made me glad I bought a glass instead of the whole bottle.\nAt the end of my meal, the restaurant hosted a live band and I enjoyed the couple of tunes I listened to before leaving. They offer this only on certain nights and the group varies from one night to the next, but I thought the music was a nice complement to the meal that I had just completed and I was glad I came.\nI get to San Francisco two or three times a year and have eaten at many great places, but this is certainly one of the best.", "author": "Paul L."}

Man was I disappointed.  I was there for a romantic date-like dinner and  we were crammed in so close to the table next to us that the table had to be pulled out to be seated.  We were the only couple in the front dinning room, all others were 3 and 4 tops.  Not a date place.\n\n  The first thing we ordered was the French onion soup and it was fantastic.  It gave me great hope for what was to come.  Next we ordered the steak tartar and although it was very good, it was NOT made tableside as others have mentioned.  I had the Agneau.  The lamb sirloin was alright but had a fair amount of grissle in it and the  braised endive was not only braised but literally burnt to the point of being inedible.  My friend had the filet mignon which he enjoyed pretty much.  The bite I tasted was ok but not great.  We finished with the chocolate mousse which was like eating a basic pudding.  Very thick and heavy , not light and fluffy.  Yet another disappointment.  As for the service, it was adequate but the waiter never once smiled.  In conclusion, if this is the best French restaurant San Francisco has to offer then the city should be ashamed.  For a city this large with a plethora of fine restaurants, this is a huge disappointment.", "author": "Tim R."}

The prices are actually not bad for San Francisco.  I just wonder what's happening in the kitchen.  I had the Steak Frites, and was not impressed.  I ordered the steak medium, which usually means a warm pink center...it didn't just come out medium well with light pink center...it was well done, browned all the way through.  How do you go from an order of medium and get well done?  The Chevre salad...not a good balance of flavors.  Too many walnuts and apples, not enough cheese.  And finally, the side of green beans is a fennel bomb in your mouth.  I like a little something to spice up the vegetable, but they over did it with the fennel.  So, not really sure what's going on in the kitchen.  But I love the location, the space, the service.

Conveniently located in between the Financial District and Union Square, Caf\u00e9 Claude is hidden on what feels like a Parision alley (Claude Lane).  The bustling tiny yet comfortable caf\u00e9 with a curving zinc bar, vintage tables, and period travel posters imported from France is a nice retreat amid the San Francisco skyline.  \n\nEntering the dimly lit restaurant with beautiful live Jazz music, I was prepared to be transported ...  After asking for water that the busboy had already managed to slip in front of me while I was immersed in the menu, the waiter good naturedly joked with us about their methods of teleportation (needless to say I am a geek and went with a geek).  He was patient and very helpful as we scoured the way too enticing menu.\n\nThe food, which was actually not as over-priced as one might think, was fantastic!  To start, we shared an order of Rillete du Perigord, shredded all-natural duck meat Pate, and Escargot, smothered in yummy butter garlic pesto sauce with cheese on top. Making sure to save room for dessert, for my main dish, I ordered the carrot cr\u00e8me soup with gruyere cheese, which was nicely complimented by the house bread, and stole a few bites of perfectly cooked lamb ...  For dessert, in addition to the cr\u00e8me brul\u00e8e, we shared the Tarte Tatin, an upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.\n\nNeedless to say I was in heaven for what we both considered a belated birthday treat.   We did not need to talk much as we indulged our appetites and enjoyed the ambience, even though the vintage table with a large base was slightly awkward and uncomfortable.  The jazz music, which is live Thursday to Saturday, made the evening.  On a warm day, I can imagine the outdoor seating would also be relaxing and can imagine that Caf\u00e9 Claude has equally enjoyable yet different atmospheres for lunch and happy hour.  I will have to go back ... but will try to remember to make an Open Table reservation given Caf\u00e9 Claude's growing popularity and positive Yelp reviews.", "author": "Anne K."}

It was a Monday, so there weren't any Jazz performances, but we still enjoyed ourselves.\n\nAmbience was lovely. Situated in a small alley, the restaurant seemed like the perfect little secret.  They have some tables in the alley with the main restaurant seating up the stairs.  After seeing some other reviews, when I called for reservations earlier that day, I asked to sit by the window (not exactly knowing what we'd be looking at. Gotta be adventurous, right? :o)).  The guy said he'd put in the request, and, upon arrival, guess where we sat!?  Yup, by the window indeed.  While we waited for my bf's friend to arrive, we ordered a glass of wine and relaxed with the light music playing in the background...overlooking the patrons sitting outside.  Almost seemed like I could be sitting at a cafe in France...almost.\n\nService was attentive but not annoying. Two thumbs up.\n\nFood was delicious.  I had the French Onion soup, and the two boys had the special Tomato Soup.  Good start.  Ordered two apps - some clambake thing which tasted like New England clam chowder and steak tartare.  I've had better steak tartare at EO in NYC.  For entrees,  my bf had the pork, his friend had the filet mignon, and I had the coq au vin with a side of spinach.  The pork was a nice savory sweet, the filet mignon melted in your mouth, and my coq au vin had a nice, intense sauce.  I will say that my chicken was a tad on the dry side.  I was hoping for a melt-in-your-mouth experience with the marinade, but I was a bit disappointed.  Dessert was basically a coconut flan (but they called it something else for some reason), and it was wonderfully light with just the right amount of coconut.\n\nThe bill was not so light, but it was my  man's birthday, so who cares! :o)", "author": "JaShin T."}

Outdoor seating under heat lamps and an awning can be nice in all but the nastiest weather, while inside definitely reminds me of my trip to Paris.\n\nFood and service were both delightful. My \"concerns\" mostly revolve around personal preference, so don't take them as complaints. I found the duck pate' a little course, though still delicious, and it came with a pair of cornichons and other pickled vegetables--always a pleasant counterpoint. The escargot sauce was not as strong as expected, though that did allow the quality of the already de-shelled snails to shine through. The sauce over my lamb was delicious but somewhat overpowered the lamb flavor; however, a combination bite of lamb/sauce/bacon/beans (the components of the entree) blended perfectly and was truly outstanding! Rounding off the meal, my bourbon creme' brulee was excellent. The bites I had of the soup de jour (carrot) and the tart tartine were also quite good.\n\nA live jazz trio began performing around 7 or 8 in a tiny alcove next to the impressive bar.

The French food here will never taste quite as good as the food you'll find in Paris, probably because the produce and the ingedients are quite different.\n\nNevertheless, the food here is pretty authentic.  I ordered the French onion soup.  It was rich and a bit salty, but very good.  My entree, the trout, was also a really good pick.  It came with a lemon butter sauce that didn't overwhelm but perfectly complemented the delicate fish.  It's so rare to find a restaurant that can serve up such a delicate filet without overpowering it.  The fish came with green beans and a side of boiled but sweet fingerling potatoes.  \n\nThe menu is small but typical of a Parisian bistro.  Coq au vin, streak and frites, lamb and other typical bistro items round out the menu.  \n\nI've heard that service here is quite snobby but I guess the management found out about that reputation and took it to heart.  Our French waitress was attentive and polite.  \n\nI ordered up a cafe creme to end my meal.  It was a rich, perfectly brewed cup of coffee with wonderful crema. \n\nOn a side note, I was really really surprised they have cafe noisette on the coffee menu.  Cafe noisette is an espresso with a touch of hot milk that brings the color of the espresso down to the color of a hazelnut.  I've never seen cafe noisette on any coffee menu in California, so that's a nice reference to a real Parisian cafe.", "author": "Audrey Y."}

I do consider myself a reliable sounding board for what is good. As such, I declare Cafe Claude to be very good. Worth a visit, and a return visit after that.\n\nWe went on a chilly Saturday evening, around 6p, and since we didn't have a res sat outside. I found it to be adventurous (\"outside\" is in an alley, dressed up, but alley none the less). As for the chilly night, the bottle of wine took care of that. \n\nWe had the french onion soup which very good. I'm not a soup fan in any case, but how could you pass up trying such a staple of french cuisine. Along with that we had the Rillette du P\u00e9rigord. Again it was good.\n\nFor the mains we had a Lamb dish with dark sauce and cassava beans. It was outstanding. Along with a Pork with a light cream sauce and sauteed pears, again outstanding as the creamy savor sauce complimented the lightly sweet pears.\n\nThe desserts were also good, in line with the appetizers, but it was the main meat dishes that truly stand out.

All of the vegetables were spot on and the sauce was incredible. \nTruite aux Amandes (5/5) - The wife raved about how well her trout was prepared and judging by how she cleaned her plate it would be hard to disagree.\n\nDessert:\nCr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e (5/5) - Simply unreal. Perfectly done.

Cafe Claude nailed it! \n\nWe came here on Friday night to hear Lori Carsillo sing beautiful jazz while enjoying dinner and cocktails. We arrived a bit earlier than our reservations so we sat around the bar (fyi the space is very limited so coming here for just cocktails can be hit it or miss it with space). We tried the sex in st. tropez, fraternite, and dirty martini. Everything was good but the fraternite stood out - tasty, refreshing, and dynamic. The bartender was very friendly and knew about customer service. \n\nWhen we were seated our waitress greeted us in French (a nice touch) and was very knowledgeable about dishes and specials. We ordered tuna tartare, steak tartare, the special bass, and lamb. With every dish the ingredients were quality and prepared to perfection. The veggies in the bass dish were cooked but still retained their crispiness and flavor. The lamb had a delicious reduction on top. The tuna tartare was YUMMY. The steak tartare is mixed right in front of your table - our only issue was that it had too much dijon, which killed the flavor of the actual meat (fine by me as I still can't get used to eating raw meat...fish yes but meat no). \n\nFor dessert we had espressos and the creme brulee - one of the best I've ever had. \n\nAlso the bread and butter they give is for some reason extra tasty...maybe the butter is made in-house? \n\nThe ambiance is also great - people sitting around enjoying conversations, wine, and food. No one is in a rush and the mood is very European. Especially since this place is tucked away it escapes the downtown san fran vibe of yuppies and tourists. \n\nOne thing to mention is that this place does end up being pricey - I believe for us it came out to roughly $200...but if you're looking to treat yourself (or your date ;) ) this place is TOTALLY worth it. \n\nGreat food, great service, great ambiance, and great music.", "author": "Sasha B."}

Everything from the ambiance to the service to the food was great!\n\nMy boyfriend took me here on Valentine's Day and I gotta say this was the perfect choice.\n\nSETTING: It's a cute little restaurant in a little alleyway so I like the seclusion of it. If you've never been here, just a note, it's off Bush Street in between Kearny and Grant, closer to Kearny. The street is pretty small so you might miss it if you drive by it. We only found it when walking on foot. The restaurant isn't big but it's very cozy. There was live music the night I went so it made it that much nicer. \n\nSERVICE: First of all, I expected service to be somewhat shitty since it was Valentine's and it was ridiculously busy, even at 9pm (we had a late dinner). However, our service was so great. Our waiter Roberto was so attentive and friendly but still gave us our space. He also gave us great suggestions since we had never been there before. He even asked us if we were big eaters and suggested that we order less since we wouldn't be able to finish it. He seemed to know the menu inside and out and gave us a full breakdown of each and every dish we asked him about. It was the most informative service ever haha. If you ever come here, I hope you get him because he just makes eating there so much better. \n\nFOOD: \nFirst of all, I think the portions are pretty generous considering the prices. It doesn't look big at first but trust me, I was STUFFED before the entree had even come out. I think our meal came out to about $80 for 2 but considering the generous portions and the quality of food, I think it was totally worth it. Plus, I left with mad food coma. \n\nThey had a 3-scallop special (it's not on the menu) which was really good but they don't make it that often so if you want to try that, come on a big holiday or something. It's basically 3 huge scallops in this buttery sauce. The scallops are scallops but the sauce is what makes this great. \n\nSteak Tartar was great. They prepare it right in front of you and it FILLS you up. Be sure to ask for more bread because trust me, you'll need it. \n\n3 p\u00e2te plate was SO good. I've never had p\u00e2te in my life but we got the chicken, duck and goose liver. Let me just say, the goose liver is SO damn good. I've always heard good things about it but damn, it's like heaven in your mouth lol \n\nLastly for dessert, we got the creme brulee. It comes out in a pretty big dish so hopefully you'll have room to finish it. It's pretty good, it's not spectacular but at this point, I was so full that my only goal was to finish this. \n\nAnyway, I definitely recommend this place. Bring a date here or even come here with friends. The food is worth trying and I recommend sharing all your food so you can try a little bit of everything.

What could be more romantic and charming?\n\nWell, the food for one.\n\nIn short: skip this overpriced, salty-fooded, bad wine tourist trap.\n\n------\n\nI had high hopes for Cafe Claude and was looking forward to having a nice dinner with my girlfriend to celebrate our year together. The outdoor seating area was packed full as was the restaurant inside (in sharp contrast to its neighbor, Gitane, just down the alley which appeared empty at 7pm). The ambiance was nice - dark, small tables, intimate.\n\nWe ordered a plate of charcuterie, the coq au vin, the bouillabaise, and a side of pomme frites. The waitress seemed very informed when she rattled off wine to pair with our entrees and we went with her suggestions.\n\nThe first red flag was the bread placed on the table. Sliced baguette that was stale. Oh, it's probably a fluke, I chided myself. Slather on some more butter!\n\nOur pathetic plate of charcuterie turned up. An uninspired selection of 3 cuts. Not particularly flavorful, rich, or interesting, served with cornichons, 3 dabs of mustard and 4 slices of bread. For $19. Ouch. Still, I convinced myself that the entrees would be better.\n\nThe wine arrived, huzzah! That excitement fizzled when I tried my \"bold, full bodied white wine\" - it was boring, that kind of bad wine that's been open and sitting around funky. My girlfriend's red was no better. \n\nOn to entrees! My bouillabaise seemed promising - the monk fish was cooked well and the mussels were bouncy perfection. Unfortunately the dish was ruined by being almost unbearably salty. I ate the seafood because I hate to waste food and I think I was still trying to convince myself that it was good. But I could not finish the bouillabaise or the hunk of bread soaking up what should have been delicious broth. For $26 how could it be this bad?? \n\nI hoped the coq au vin would save the day but my girlfriend said it was average at best. I tried a taste - the chicken and sauce were decidedly sour. Not that unctuous sour tartness that results from cooking meat with wine and animal fats but the funkiness that comes from food starting to go bad. Ugh.\n\nEven the pommes frites were ruined from being way too salty!\n\nI regret not speaking up when the waitress hurried by to ask \"how is everything?\" I could only manage to squeak out \"Oh, pretty good...\" when I meant \"it's too salty, it tastes unpleasant...\"\n\nOffered a selection of desserts, I quickly declined any more food from this establishment.\n\nBased on other reviews, this place seems to have a Jekyll and Hyde personality. For hit or miss food I am not willing to pay $60+ per person.\n\nNext time I will remember that golden rule of dining out in San Francisco: always avoid dining in tourist areas, no exceptions, not even for cute-sounding romantic French cafes.", "author": "j s."}

We were looking for a place that said \"special outing\" but not pretentious, and when I asked a friend of mine for suggestions, he suggested it right away.\n\nWhen we arrived, the beautiful hostess seated us right away.  Unfortunately, my family is big and tall, so when we sat down I felt a bit uncomfortable due to the size of the small table.  But this wasn't a problem at all as the plates were cleared after each course in a timely manner, and things felt spacious enough.\n\nWe started off with the cheese plate (which is offered both as an appetizer and as a dessert).  It was great.  They served a slice of good brie alongside two other interesting cheeses, one goat and one sheep cheese.  The plate came with three crostinis and candied walnuts, and a very good port/honey reduction drizzled and smeared across one corner.  The slightly pungent flavor of the sheep/goat cheeses along with the deep sweetness of the reduction was a pretty tantalizing experience for $16.\n\nI ordered a french onion soup... perfect.  My brother had a house salad (the \"maison\" for those who are looking for the name of the salad on the menu), and the salad had a great flavor and just the right amount of dressing.\n\nWe each had a different entree: roasted lamb, flat-iron steak, and I had the special for the day, Beef Bourguignon, aka Beef Burgundy.  We each sampled each others' dishes, and I thought the lamb was very tender and moist, and the sauce was exquisite.  The flat iron steak was a perfect medium rare, and had a wonderfully caramelized crust.  Again, the sauce was right on.  The French just get it right when it comes to sauces, I guess.  The beef burgundy got a little dry where one of the pieces I had was well-done.  The sauce on my dish was too rich, and the flavor dwarfed the vegetables in the dish (peas, carrots, and potatoes) rather than bringing them all together and accenting them.\n\nWe each had a glass of Macallan's, and sipped throughout our meal.  It was a nice touch... a good call, brother.\n\nOne very cool thing about the night was when I made a trip to the restroom and stopped our server to ask him if they could do anything special for Father's Day.  He explained that they never did anything for Mother's Day nor Father's Day, but he thought about it for a moment and said, \"How about a little glass of muscat wine for everyone after the meal?\"  I thought it was perfect.

Something, that is missing from many restaurants. We ordered Duck, Chicken Coq Au Vin, Maison Salad and Pomme frite. The menu is on one page so choices is somewhat limited but very good! My only issue was the wine list that seemed too expensive for a bottle, which is usually what I prefer to do when buying more than 2 glasses. \n\nIt was also, nice to have staff that spoke French and English that adds to the ambiance of a French restaurant when you can speak french too.", "author": "Marc V."}

In fact now that I'm thinking about it, its time to go back again!  \n\nI had the quiche Lorraine with a salad and we got french fries for the table.  They have the BEST kind of french fries, skinny and not too crispy with just enough salt.  Yum, yum, yum!  Fabulous waiter who was entertaining and perfectly attentive the entire time.  Great ice tea - I like that they brought me my own carafe of it because I drink the stuff like water.  Nice atmosphere and not too noisy, which was nice.\n\nTwo things could be improved: at lunch I felt the lights were a bit too low and the booths were tiny for four of us.  Not much you can do about that I know, but something to note.\n\nAnd now...I've decided to go there tomorrow.  Yum yum!", "author": "Erika M."}

We made our reservations through OpenTable.com and had no problems when we got to the restaurant.  \n\nThe setting was very intimate and romantic.  Like other reviews have said, the tables were close to each other but didn't make you feel like you were intruding on other people or vice versa.  \n\nWe went on a Friday night and listened to the live jazz.  They were very pleasant but not a main attraction.  I would say not to go just based on the jazz (which is what I was looking for when I found the restaurant).\n\nWe took our time eating and had a long meal.  We had 2 cocktails before dinner and a half-bottle of wine with our meal.  For a first course, we had the endive salad with blue cheese and walnuts, pat\u00e9 de rigellard, pat\u00e9 de campange and the steak tartare.  Main course was the Agneau with scalloped potatoes.  To finish dinner, we had the cr\u00e9me brul\u00e9e.  All of this was shared between the both of us and we hadn't eaten all day.  Even with that, we ordered one dish too many.  \n\nThe utter satisfaction we felt after leaving this place was enough for us to rave about it for the next 3 months.  I will definitely be going back to Cafe Claude - however, it will have to wait until I get my waist back as the meals are super-rich!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-12-30", "description": "I met up with Euni and Zel as one last rendezvous for food and good company before they headed back down to SoCal before I did.  Coming out of the Montgomery BART station, reminded me of why Skid Row remained \"Skidded out.\"\n\nCheap Chinese Food, Crackheads screaming out obscenities, and your fashionable Hipster Business Consultant all on the same block, go figure. Back on topic, we finally got here after drifting about, discussing which streets to turn on and such. A notable restaurant on my bookmark list for a good year and a half, I get to see why so many people enjoy and appreciate this small French Get Away in an SF Alleyway!\n\nGoing inside, it is it dim with splash of bright red and an authentication of location (Euni says this place is as legit as French can be in the Bay Area, go figure). After waiting for several minutes, the waitress sat us down and urged us to order in 10 minutes otherwise we wouldn't be able to order brunch (boo, for lack of compromise). I hate being rushed to order stuff, so it made me a bit disappointed. Looking through the options for a good 5 minutes, here's what we decided to order:\n\nDrinks:\n-Waters all around\n-1 glass of ($15.00 for a glass and $60.00 for a bottle) Lalande De Pomerol  Ch\u00e2teau Haute-Goujon, Bordeaux 2002 \n\nDishes:\n\nSandwiches:\n-1 order of Quiche Lorraine; consists of: pate feuillet\u00e9e, cr\u00e8me fraiche, bacon, and egg\n\nEntree's:\n-1 order of Paleron De Flanchet ; consists of:\nflank steak, marchand de vin sauce, served with pommes frites\n\n(I couldn't recall the third entree that my friend Zel ordered but it was also delicious)\n\nDesserts:\n\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e; consists of: 'bourbon' vanilla bean\n-1 order of Sorbet du Jour; selection of Ciao Bella sorbet (plum and mango flavors chosen)\n-1 order of Cr\u00e8me Coconut Cafe Claude's house flan\n\n\nLet's start with the missing entree, although I wasn't able to recall which one it was. The mysterious green dish escaping my memory banks served its purpose by fulfilling my appetite, probably my more preferred dish to order over my Flat Iron Steak any day of the week. Apologies for the lack of detail on that note.\n\nNext, the Quiche' was decent and size and of course filling for my friend Euni. Although just like my mother, she too has an inability to take a lot of rich food within a short period of time. Therefore, I guess unlike her I can continue enjoying the culinary delights the French can offer at a greater magnitude. Then comes my dish the Paleron De Flanchet, was alright. Tender (as it was served medium, but preferably medium-rare per suggestion of the server) but not enough to satisfy my love for steak. The sauce, was good with the pomme frites, and I decided to decline the use of ketchup.\n\nThe wine, my god for $15.00 I considered it a bit of highway robbery initially. If, Euni didn't mention to me that any wine from Bordeaux was worth the price hike I probably would have cried foul. But no, alas it did its job in pacifying my post-economic recession rage. I was smitten and smothered with the smooth rouge hitting my tongue. No spice, no fuss, all nice (another bottle to add to my ever growing wine collection).\n\nLastly the desserts, the sorbet (consisting of plum and mango) that Euni ordered was splendid. Sorbets not being my thing since the invention of \"Push-Pop creamsicles\" made me appreciate tartness. Then came the coconut flan of Zel's, very creamy. I actually wish my mom and other dessert specialists were to re-create this masterpiece for me personally in the future. And of course, my Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e was outstanding (much better than Shin Sen Gumi's in Fountain Valley, Ca. and Bijou's in Hayward). \n\nSo even with all this good food, why such a mediocre rating? Service...I can't stress that enough. Like Somerset, I felt our table was a bit overshadowed, although our waitress apologized the delay in our receipt and change after paying for the meal ($85.00 altogether with tax and tip). I can't believe their detail in service is lacking. Maybe it's because we came in at a time when they were transitioning shifts from Brunch to Dinner...I'm willing to give them that. But until, I come back for a dinner experience my rating still stands.\n\nOtherwise, I really enjoy what you brought in terms of French cuisine as far as my experience is concern. I'm definitely willing to give this place a shot again, and maybe with another Lalande De Pomerol on hand.", "author": "Ryan M."}

Non j'adore.\n\nThat in mind, my friends surprised me for my birthday by taking me here, DESPITE knowing my opinion.\n\nInteriors: There's something that flows to my aesthetic eye when a restaurant uses oranges and reds in their design. Tall ceilings and an awning outside (for diners who want more of an authentic cafe experience). Different dining areas sectioned off make for interesting architecture, and the tall glass windows are great to peep out if the conversation at the table is lacking.\n\nSpace between tables is average. Nothing to brag about.\n\nDrinks: Bonjour maman! I had a couple of the same cocktail (the St. Germain whatnot with elderflower liquer and sparkling wine) and it was pretty damn good. Prices are a bit higher, but the quality of the drinks justify the $$. My friends all enjoyed their varied cocktails.\n\nA great, but not ravishingly impressive wine list (oui, Francais).\n\nFood: I'll admit it; I'm biased. French cuisine doesn't do it for me (in fact it's my least favorite). I find it bland and I usually get really bad acid reflux from it. That in mind, the menu was all right. Not a huge selection that was interesting enough to inquire about.\n\nThe goose pate was fantastic. Props to a smooth texture and just the right amount of herbs. The menu is split into starters, small plates and entrees, allowing guests with lighter (or heavier) appetites to pick and choose.\n\nThe scallops were basically the only thing that sounded swallowable to me and were cute but uneventful. A friend had the raviole (not a typo) which was somewhat of a joke; a pasta \"wrapper\" sided with the mushroom filling on the side. She didn't even know how to eat it.\n\nDessert-wise, we all split the creme brulee (which was generously given to me gratis as a bday thing), which was decent and authentic. The other desserts didn't really pique any interests.\n\nService: EXCELLENT. Considering that it was busy, our server was extremely attentive. Even though he was fantastic, the wait between dishes was really long. Once ready, the food presenters knew whom had ordered what (a nice little service). The hostess was also totally on game.

The key to this is that they don't try to be what someone thinks a French restaurant should be.  They just focus on running a great restaurant that happens to serve French food.  It sounds simple, but most French places in the city don't get it.\n\nCafe Claude is completely lacking in pretension.  For example, the wine list isn't a book - it's a list.  And it changes regularly. And it's cheap.  And it's good.  The menu is likewise relatively short and to the point.  It's a fine mix of standards with some creativity reserved for the specials board.\n\nWe typically do three of the following: a charcuterie plate, the steak tartare, onion soup, pommes frites, escargot or cheese plate.  We also tend to jump on their specials.  There is nothing on the menu that I think twice about ordering.\n\nThere isn't a better way to spent a drizzly night in SF than in Claude Alley under the awning and the heaters, if you know what I mean.

I had heard about it a while back but never really followed up on the hype.  I went on a Friday around 6pm with my friend and was seated immediately.  From beginning to end I thoroughly enjoyed my experience.\n\nI think what added to it's charm was the fact that it was tucked away in a little alley.  It looked tiny and welcoming, just like a little bistro you'd find in Europe.  The wine list is on point (it is a French restaurant after all).  Our server recommended a delicious white that was only $9.  That says a lot that he didn't try to upsell us on the alcohol.\n\nNice, freshly baked French bread and butter.  One teeny little issue was that we ordered a French onion soup to start and it never came. Don't know how the dish got lost there since we ordered all of our food at the same time.  However, everything else we sampled was great.\n\nOne dish that I unfortunately can't remember the name of, reminded me of oysters rockafeller because it was twice baked on the half shell.  A delicious mix of shellfish in a cheesy, cream.  Yumm... it's heavy, so I suggest it as an appetizer to pass around.\n\nThe vegetable lasagna was quite possibly the best I've ever had at a restaurant.  Admittedly, the veggies didn't come out too much (I think there was eggplant and zucchini somewhere in there?), but the noodles were cooked perfectly and it was so comforting, cheesy and satisfying.  I liked the fact that it came in it's own individual ramekin, clearly showing that these are made to order.  You could tell because it came out piping hot and soft.\n\nLastly, we had the creme brulee for dessert.  Since we never got our appetizer we decided to do dessert instead.  It was very simple and elegant - but not unlike anything I've tried before.\n\nWe left just as the band got started.  Could not believe they crammed a live show into that teeny place.

And to think, I was seriously considering canceling dinner plans here because I was tired during the day.  \n\nThis meal, this little establishment, was absolutely fantastic, in every little way.  I am grateful that San Francisco has many of these little treasures, just waiting to be discovered.  It makes me feel like. . . I never want to leave this city by the bay.  \n\nI came here with a friend tonight, thanks to a recommendation from Betty W. (spanks much!), and we ate up a storm.  Almost everything we ordered was excellent; it was like they could do no wrong.  And my favorite part was that they didn't stop surprising me with the food.  Surprising you in the best kind of way.\n\nWhat was surprising and good?  Aite, here we goes:\n\n+ I started out with the endive salad, and my friend ordered a special that they had this week, a fondue dish.  My endive salad was delectable, probably one of the best-tasting salads I have ever had.  The creamy dressing was light and flavorful; the bleu cheese, walnuts, and apple slices were a nice complement.  I enjoyed it immensely.  I also tried my friend's fondue dish, which was basically a bunch of toasted baguette slices in a big piece of brie.  It was quite good, a little too heavy for my taste, but my friend seemed to enjoy it.\n+ Next, our main dishes came, along with a side order of pommes frites. I got the pork filet, recommended by our wonderful hostess, and my friend got the roasted lamb sirloin.  The pork filet was FANTASTIC.  Tender, slightly sweet, tender.  Did I say that twice?  Well, only because it was so. . . tender and delicious.  I loved it.  I also tried my friend's lamb dish; he really liked it, but while I thought it was good, it was still a little too...strong in flavor for me.  The pommes frites were a bit disappointing; there was nothing spectacular about them and I've definitely had better ones before (Chouchou's has some great pommes frites with mussels!).  That's why the review loses a star.  Those fries were just kinda meh. \n+ For dessert, we ordered the sorbet du jour.  It comes with two scoops, so I chose strawberry-basil, and my friend chose lemon-rosemary.  OH. MY. GOD.  It was INSANE.  It was an EXPLOSION of herb flavor.  Really got some punch!  The fruit flavors were really subtle, but the herbiness was, just, as said before, INSANE and strong - in a good way.  That was one big, very good surprise.  Talk about being creative and inventive in the best kind of way!  It was a nice, light, clean finish to a meal.  Definitely recommended after all the other heavy foods!\n\nI also wanted to add that the service was impeccable; they changed our plates and everything between every course and were so friendly, gracious, and warm.  Very much appreciated.  The place is also cute and intimate, located in one of those little alleyways that are so popular around Union Square. \n\nI think this review loses points only because the pommes frites were so generic, and the bread at the beginning was just okay.  I was expecting Ratatouille Bread, and although it made an ever-so-slight crunchy sound, it didn't live up to expectations in both the sound and taste categories.   \n\nNonetheless, it was a fantastic, delicious meal.  Come for the food, the ambiance, the great service.  Places like these are part of the reason why I love living in San Francisco.  Eating in a little French place in an alleyway.  How awesome is that, right?  It's a really good food city, and I'm realizing it more and more.", "author": "Vivian C."}

P\u00e2t\u00e9 Campagne\ncountry style pork pate flavored with black pepper and red wine\n**my favorite. can really taste the pepper but still you can taste the pork**\n2. Rillette du P\u00e9rigord\npork free, shredded all-natural duck meat, duck fat seasoned & cooked confit style\n**This was pretty good also. It was my boyfriend's favorite**\n3. Truffle Mousse\na creamy all-natural petaluma poultry chicken livers, truffles and c\u00e8pes marinated in sherry\n**This was our least favorite. Taste was odd.

I don't know what was on top of the fish, but it tasted like candied lemon or orange shreds of some sort. It was VERY refreshing.**\n\n- Agneau $23.\nroasted lamb sirloin with garlic, bread crumbs and emergo beans \n**I expected better flavors. It gave the impression of some sort of comfort food, but didn't meet my expectations. It lacked strong \"comfort\" taste, but my honey liked it so maybe it was just me. It was cooked PERFECTLY (medium rare, the way lamb should be cooked!) I just didn't like the sauce. I wouldn't pay $23 again for that dish though.**\n\n- Cr\u00e8me Brul\u00e9e $7.\nmade with 'bourbon' vanilla bean\n**can anyone say YUM-O????

She didn't look very friendly, so I got the BITCH vibe from her. Her name is SOPHIE. I did NOT like this SOPHIE girl a bit. As we were finishing up our bowl of bread and butter (which was also very tasty), our pate plate came out... without any kind of crackers or bread of some sort... I don't know about you, but I can't eat pate but itself. So my honey asked her for more bread and she said that it will take a few minutes because they had to get more. OK understandable, no rush. As we waited with the last of our first batch of bread, she walked by and for no reason said to my honey something along the lines of \"I'll get you your bread, you don't have to be so stingy about it\".... WTF??? are you flippin' serious?? How do you say THAT to a customer? That TOTALLY ruined the mood. What could've possibly made her say something like that? I have NO idea. Oh and everytime we said \"Thank You\" to her, she NEVER EVER said \"You're Welcome\". WHAT IN THE FREAKIN HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?\n\nAs we finished up the pate, we left the last pate behind because it wasn't our favorite one. She comes back and is VERY adamant about us finishing the last pate. FIRST, she suggested adding some salt and pepper to it... So I did and we tried it after she left our table. Still didn't like it. She came back and was ATTEMPTING to suggest something about the salt grinder, which had NO point. Something about the salt crystals being so huge and she even OPENED up the grinder to show us.... I'M SORRY, BUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS THE POINT IN THAT? There WAS no point. You have just wasted a good few minutes of mine and my boyfriend's dinner time together to talk about your DAMN SALT GRINDER.\n\nYou don't freakin push a customer to finish something if they don't want to. I did not like her A BIT.\n\nI left 15% tip anyways because of the food.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCome here. This place is pretty good. I'm sure other servers could've given us better service and would've been much NICER.\n\nFreakin Sophie, man. UNBELIEVABLE.", "author": "Heidi C."}

I could have stayed and eaten coq au vin all night, but we were full!  This was complemented with a glass of Montagne St.-Emilion Bordeaux, which delighted My Lady.  \n\nDessert consisted of mousse chocolat, paired with a Cuvee Parce Freres Domaine de la Rectorie Banyuls -- a red sauterne.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-27", "description": "I love raw meat so I couldn't pass up the opportunity to eat steak tartare with some friends, one of whom hails from Paris. \n\nWe happened upon Cafe Claude after a confusing run around at Cafe de la Presse who were advertising Steak Tartare as their special on Wednesday nights, but in actuality, the raw beouf dish is only served on Tuesdays.\n\nHonestly, I didn't mind. I'd rather go to a different restaurant and be served fresh raw meat than stay at a restaurant where the freshness could be questionable. \n\nSo, the server at Cafe de la Presse recommended Cafe Claude for Steak Tartare and we headed over, resigned to the fact that we were probably going to end up eating cheap Chinese in Chinatown.\n\nWe were mistaken.\n\nCafe Claude not only has one of the cutest outdoor alleyway set ups in San Francisco (with heat lamps), but the interior of the restaurant is a very good replication of what you would find in Paris on a warm summer's night, complete with warm incandescent lighting, fans rotating overhead and a dark wood bar near the entrance. You can almost feel Toulouse-Lautrec, Balzec or Verne hovering over their French comfort food in the warmly lit and secluded corner booths.\n\nThe BF and I shared a large Steak Tartare, complete with a raw quail egg, diced cornichons, relish, finely chopped parsley, shallots, and mustard. We added a couple of drops of Tabasco and worcestshire to the mound of boeuf and mixed our own with glee. \n\nThis was the first time he had tasted Tartare, and he loved it. The chuck was very fresh, with a good amount of fat mixed in. The seasoning was perfect. I think my only comment would be to have either more quail eggs or just one good large cage-free chicken egg to bind the ground chuck more. \n\nYet, I still say YUM.\n\nWe also split a Coq au Vin, which is a homestyle chicken stew braised in red wine. Although I highly doubt they pick out roosters for this dish, it was fragrant and hearty, with the chicken meat falling delicately off the bone and chunks of mushrooms and pearl onions. My friend who sat across from us used the last of the French bread and wiped the sauce clean off the plate and into his mouth. \n\nThe delivery of the cheese plate after dinner was timed a little off, but the cheeses were pretty good. One goat, one Brie and a mild bleu. \n\nCocktails. Best name for a French cafe cocktail ever: Zidane Coup a Tete. Binky had this, and I believe it had 3 or 4 different alcohols mixed in. I had a classic Gibson, where I asked for well vodka and they gave me Ketel One.\n\nLet's just say the dining experience was very satisfying, and I realize how much I miss good French cuisine. Service was a little strange, I don't think I've ever had a server write \"18% tip not included* by hand onto the check or forget the last course of the meal, but I'm over it for it was an overall positive experience. \n\nAllez les bleus! \nVive la France! \nMangez plus de Steak Tartare!", "author": "May T."}

This little slice of awesome has been sitting in my bookmarks for who knows how long.  \"I'll get to typing out your review one day\" I would promise but the day never seemed to come.  Well lunch today reminded me of why I love the Cafe Claude experience and moved me to finally express my feelings for all to see.\n\nI really had no idea where I was going to eat today so I started my usual stroll by places familiar in search of the right spot to fill my belly.  However, I did not want my belly too full.  So as I was walking along I started to think to myself, \"where can you get something that has amazing flavor in a relatively small package?\"  Being that I was now walking along Kearny it hit me...CAFE CLAUDE!!!\n\nSo I walk up to the little alleyway in which the cafe is located and was greeted with their signboard listing today's specials.  I was actually a little heartbroken when I saw that I was going to have to chose between two items that I knew would be wonderful, either the pasta bolognaise or the pan seared scallops with mashed potatoes and a hollandaise sauce.  I knew no matter which one I picked I would have my mind on the other one, wondering if I made the right choice.\n\nLucky for me, there was no wrong choice.  My waiter, whose name I unfortunately did not memorize, recommended the pan seared scallops.  Not because it was better than the bolognaise, but because I had let him know that I was hoping to eat something a little less filling.  He also suggested that I have the endive salad, which was delicious and a great preparation for the scallops.\n\nThe pan seared scallops, the hollandaise sauce, the mashed potatoes...what can I say about something so close to perfection?  My goodness when I took that first bite of the scallops I was so happy.  You couldn't possibly sear them any better.  They had a nice slightly firm texture and the flavor mixed beautifully with the hollandaise sauce.  I thought that I would pass on the mashed potatoes since I didn't want to leave with a heavy stomach but they were whipped wonderfully.  They weren't runny or too dense.\n\nI'm usually obsessive about brushing my teeth after lunch but today I want to savor the flavor in my mouth.  I don't care if I run into one beautiful lady after another, I'm not trading my cafe claude flavor for kissable breath anytime soon.  I will most definitely be back soon to hopefully have another chance at the bolognaise, which I am sure will be just as tasty.\n\nAside from today's lunch Cafe Claude has some tasty sandwiches.  The most memorable was a crab sandwich I had the first time I stopped by Cafe Claude for lunch.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the sandwiches on the menu.  Items that I have had my eye on but have yet to try are the soupe a l'oignon, quiche lorraine, and the gratin dauphinois.\n\nThe staff here is pleasant to outstanding.  They are all warm and friendly and manage to serve you well without hovering over you while you enjoy your meal.\n\nCafe Claude is also an excellent place to grab a drink and/or listen to some great live music.  The alleyway location and the warm interior are major pluses also.", "author": "Luis M."}

Here in LA, we have Bouchon and they also offer a dish that is nearly identical to Cafe Claude's Steak and Frites.

And being newbies to the place, my friend and I decided to enjoy a nice dinner with a bottle of wine, shared appetizers and our main courses.  Dessert would have been the perfect ending to our dinner, but honestly, after eating all that food, my tummy just didn't have room for it.  But no worries, I'll definitely make up for it the next time I visit, since so many visitors seem to rave about the desserts there.\n\nWe started with 2 appetizers.  Escargot en Croute (garlic, butter, parsley, almond nutmeg, shallots and anchovies)  & Coquilles Saint Jacques (scallops, shrimp, mussels, mushrooms, bread crumbs, gruyere).  Both were delicious!  Although I would have appreciated the escargot more if they were served in their original shells, the preparation and the flavors in this dish, along with the little puff pastry shell on top truly made me appreciate this delicacy.  The mixture of the seafood in the Coquilles Saint Jacques along with it's creamy texture made it a wonderful delight to eat.  All the flavors dancing in my mouth had me savoring every bite.\n\nFor our main courses, we ordered the Ahi (seared ahi tuna, onion confit, bacon, soy green peppercorn sauce) & and Agneau (roasted lamb sirloin with garlic, bread crumbs and emergo beans).  Both dishes arrived exactly as we ordered it.... lightly seared for the Ahi and medium for the lamb.  \n\nAll in all, I would have to say that the food and the service turned out nicely.

The waiter we talked to at the closed restaurant recommended Cafe Claude, and I'm very glad he did.\n\nNot being very hungry, I opted for two appetizers: a pat\u00e9 sample and steak tartare.    \n\nThe pat\u00e9 was, as expected, rich and tasty, but I didn't think any of the three were anything special.  My sister and I both liked the chicken best.\n\nThe steak tartare was the best I've ever had, and I've had tartare at an actual sidewalk cafe in Paris.  The server prepared at the table to taste, and he left me the bottle of tabasco in case I needed more (I didn't: he did it perfectly).  The meat was bright red and looked so good I could have eaten it even before he mixed it up.  I can't wait to come back here and get more of this!\n\nMy sister had the steak, which was also quite good, but we agreed that the tartare was the best thing there.\n\nA friend and I both got the Bouquet to drink.  It was very complex and interesting (muddled lavender!), and I was in general impressed with the variety of drink choices they offered.\n\nMinuses: If you're vegetarian, there aren't a lot of options.  This is apparently normal at Parisian-cafe style French places.  However, the three vegetarians in the party claimed that the french fries were phenomenal and ate two orders even though two of them had already had a full dinner and were just joining us for drinks.\n\nAlso, there is a street-level entrance in the back, so don't let the stairs scare you!", "author": "Avani W."}

It's in a little alley but it's still attractive and sheltered enough from the main streets that you can sit outside and still carry on a conversation.  \n\nThere were a few little hiccups when we arrived; the hostess who was very friendly initially got distracted by a phone call so we ended up feeling foolish waiting in the middle of the action while she finished up and ignored us.  Not a big deal.  There was also a little friendly rivalry going between our waiter and the manager; they kept trying to outdo the other with knowledge of food and the menu.  It felt like there were a couple barbs under the smiles but again it wasn't mean spirited and was a bit entertaining albeit unusual.  \n\nI was all set for the Croque Monsieur until I heard the specials.  Hmmm, mini scallops with summer squash?  Done... that's probably healthier anyway right?  Oh, they're drowned in butter?  Never mind about the healthy, but very tasty.  \n\nThe restaurant was very clean, and has a welcoming atmosphere.  Definitely worth a hit if you're in the area, I think I'll have to eat here a few more times by convenience to get a better sense of the place.", "author": "David K."}

GOD. Heaven. \n\nAnd in a nutshell: \n\nI've waited to try both lunch and dinner from lovely Cafe Claude before sharpening my critic's pencil in anticipation of some review writing so I'll have to say that I have nothing (save a few pointers) but praise for Cafe Claude.  \n\nIn order for you to understand the sheer size of my belly that now needs  stretchy pants, please see the following list of what I consumed (greedily and without guilt - well not TOO much guilt) during two occasions for lunch and dinner:\n\nPigging out - First Round - GO! (Lunch)\nFrench 75 - This has got to be the tastiest champagne cocktail ever!  I forget exactly whats in this but I believe its rosee with grapefruit and lime juices - packs a nice punch and fizz, especially for an afternoon lunch or brunch.  I really liked this one, plus it looks pretty!\n\nCheese Plate w/ Fleur de Vert w/ cranberry, pica portuguese, Runchon - This was such a GOOD deal.  Cheese plate was only $16 and had huge slices of fabulous cheese.  The Fleur de Vert w/ cranberry was soft, creamy and absolutely, RIDICULOUSLY yummy with a hint of sweetness on the tongue; Pica was very creamy and had a brie-like texture with a nice milky smell, and the Runchon was fabulous with the dates and honey supplied on the plate.  \n\nCroque Madame w/ Pommes Frites & Salad - HOOOOOMG.  The Croque Madame PWNS any sammich out there. Straight up... PWNS.  Crisp toasted bread with ham, and grueyre cheese melted with a lovely sunnyside egg on top?  What the F*XOrz.  It was so good.  The pommes frites were thin and crispy but the insides were not soggy and the dipping sauce was just right! This plate even had an accompanying salad, that was drizzled with olive oil (I presume). PERFECT. \n \nQuiche Lorraine - only having a bite of this. I'd have to say it was pretty damn good. But i really did prefer my Croque Madame much better :D\n\n-----------------------------\nPigging out - Second Round - GO! (Dinner)\n\nLe Petit Ecolier - Tasty little bugger, but not much alcohol in it.  I would suggest something else if you're interested in a *real* cocktail. \n\nPommes Frites - Very good, same rating as above in the Lunch portion of the review.\n\nEscargot - Okay, snails - probably not exactly the food you'd eat everyday, but hello, if I can eat cow tongue and not flinch then I think I can handle some wimpy little snails.  F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S!!!!  Kinda expensive for $10 for 5 little snails, but damn were they good.  Baked in some sort of special crockery with five little holes topped with round disks of baked bread or some sort of flaky pastry all broiled under a tasty oily concotion.  It was like SUPER MINI SNAIL POT PIE.  YUM.  YUM!!!\n \nFlank Steak - Very very well done \"medium rare\" steak.  Cooked on the outer edges with a good rare on the inside, this steak was yummy though I wish I would have had the Coq au Vin for my main dish. \n\nCoq au Vin - What praise I have for this dish.  Fabulous, hearty, rich and absolutely satisfying any time or place.  Soft, falling off the bone chicken with pearl onions, bacon and a wonderful wine sauce.  Not too salty, not too bland, just perfect!  Loved this; I had to stop myself from stealing it all from a hungry bear! \n\n------------\n\nResult: Me= KO and Cafe Claude = WINS AGAIN!\n\n\nReally though, a fabulous bistro with great atmosphere and better than average service.  We were seated as requested and it is a very cute, romantic restaurant; love the outdoor seating and the windows allow good ventilation though I could see it getting really hot in the summer.  Nice live jazz music and a very comfortable noise level.  \n\nAll in all a four star experience, could get expensive fast, but definitely a cute place to take a loved one or someone special for a nice dinner out.  :)", "author": "Linda C."}

It's great for lunch too.\n\nIt's classic - I've been going to Cafe Claude for over 15 years and it's not changed at all and I hope it will be around for years to come without changing\n\nIt's dependable - no need to make reservation months ahead like with most of the trendy hot spots.  I'm always surprised how easy it is to get a table there with short notice.\n\nIt's flattering - the lighting there is very forgiving and after a bottle of wine, we all look good, right?\n\nYou feel sexy in it - it's French!\n\nThe food is exceptional.  I love the steak tartare prepared for you table-side.  The french onion soup is always good as is the cheese and pate plates.  The salad nicoise with the seared ahi is both healthy and scrumptious.  \n\nThe bottom line is this.  No matter the time of the day, it just feels good to hang out there.

Actually, even he asked what I was thinking about every dish I tried which was quite fascinating. I tried the onion soup, but it disappointed me, since it was too liquid, there was not enough onion in it, and the bread was giant inside the bowl, but they were really generous about the cheese on top of the bowl. They have really good salads, I definitely recommend. However, my expectations were really high for cream brulee since this is a French place. It didn't turn good, because the dessert was really cold, but it's cream bruleee, right? it supposed be kind of warm after caramelization of sugar. Another thing was, all the vanilla beans were sitting on the bottom and I realized that they actually use real vanilla beans instead of vanilla flavor when I finished the dessert, which was pretty sad. On the other hand, the barman said they changed the dessert chef, they are kind of trying different things, and it's good to hear about comments. Overall, it was good, but I was expecting more from this price since 2 out of 3 dishes turned out unsatisfactory.", "author": "Tugba K."}

There's nothing I don't love about this place. \n\nMy favs are the Charcuterie Plate, the onion soup, and the pate plate. Every main dish has been wonderful, but they change those quite a bit. My husband loves the Moules Frites and the escargot, but I can't comment as that's not my thing. \n\nThanks to my hairdude at Chakra that told me of this place many years ago!

I read in someone's review that when she goes to Cafe Claude, it feels like she is having an affair.  I am having an affair there too...with the restaurant!  Dining there makes me feel that I am being totally taken care of and enveloped in sexiness and deliciousness.  I know I am going to have a great meal, and that the server will of course reccomend things that will tantalize and delight my palate.  The lighting is so flattering that when I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror, I am instantly turned on.\r\n\r\nHere are the sordid details for you:  charcuterie plate, coquilles st. jacques, steak tartare (prepared tableside with the cutest little quail's egg on top), coq au vin...and a lot of red, red wine.  \r\n\r\nThis is a lovely spot for a date, dinner with a friend, a meal alone (seriously, it's one of the few places you can do that and not feel freakish - instead you feel like a person of great intrigue and mystery), or a casual lunch.

The butter they served with the bread was so creamy and tasty, it set the bar for the rest of the meal.  I had the endive salad and the onion soup.

My wife had the poulet roti which, of course I had to have a bite of, and it was excellent!  I've had poulet roti at Thomas Keller's Bouchon before and Cafe Claude's was waaaaay better.  We also had the pate plate and that was amazing.  \n\nI know, I know...I started this review talking about the frites and yada yada and I would rate Cafe Claude 3 stars, but 4 stars is about right considering the poulet roti and the pate were great!

I can't even count the number of times I've been here, and the number of people I have brought. It's very hard for me to find good brasserie food like the kind I was used to eating in Paris, and let me say, this place does a fantastic job. \n\nI've ordered the croque monsieur/madame far too many times and I have never been unhappy. It comes with an ample amount of delicious french fries (seasoned so well, I don't even need ketchup! it's so un-american of me!), and salad. This is a very fulfilling lunch to say the least and I usually feel somewhat guilty for finishing the whole thing. \n\nAdditionally, I've had the quiche lorraine, the mousse au sauterne, les epinards, your mom, the potato gratin, and the steak tartare. That last one is probably my favorite (apologies to your mom), as it is very hard to find steak tartare for a decent price and now I've started to crave it! Doesn't that sound arrogant? \"Ohhhh dawwwling how I crave steak tartare!\" Sad, but true. The best part is the menu is amazingly cheap for the amount/type of food you are getting. How can you pass up a great $10 lunch!?\n\nThe staff has been very good on all occasions, and are especially friendly when you start speaking french! The only downside is that it is in an alley, so there isn't much sunlight and you can't watch people walk by.

The ambiance was very warm and intimate, and live jazzy music started about halfway through our meal.\nWe shared the escargots to start. The snails were deliciously drowning in garlic-parsley butter, with little \"croute\" hats on top. I wish there had been more than six - very tasty!\nIt took us a while to figure out what entrees to order as both colleagues are limited eaters at the moment (one is gluten-free) and the server was a little fussy about substitutions. Which in a small kitchen on a busy Friday night, I suppose I can understand. \nBeing delightfully food issue-free, I immediately went for the pan-roasted salmon, which turned out to be a good idea. The seared-to-medium fillet was perched atop French lentils with bacon, and dressed with a tangy horseradish cream. The dish was rich enough to stand up to the bottle of Cotes du Rhone that we shared.\nI stole a few bites of the white bean and artichoke ragout from the lamb plate, but was unimpressed. My favorite entree turned out to be my friend's trout aux amandes - perfectly cooked trout was slathered in lightly toasted almonds and a white wine lemon sauce (that inexplicably contained mushrooms?). The green beans were somewhat uninspired but the butter-drenched fingerling potatoes were very good, as butter-drenched items tend to be. \nI also had a bite of the moelleux au chocolat, which was soft and chocolaty good.\n\nThe special was described as a blue-nose sea bass and it sounded really good, but it was 29 bucks! My salmon was only 19, and I just can't see another fish entree as worth those extra 10 bucks. I was also surprised that steak frites were not on the menu.\n\nI can see myself coming here for lunch occasionally, as Claude Lane is basically across the street from my office.

I've eaten tons of french cuisine (mostly in Qu\u00e9bec), and I have a better-than-average idea of what's what with this sort of thing.\n\nThey're located at 7 Claude Lane, and there are outdoor tables, as well as a fine assortment of tables in the appropriately-lit (read: slightly dim) interior. We found the service to be transparent (i.e., no drama) and efficient. Lunch is served 11:30am to 3:30pm (M-Sat), dinner is served 5:30 to 10:30pm (M-Sun), and there's an apr\u00e9s midi (hors d'oeuvres) menu from 3:30-4:30pm.\n\nSo, there's no breakfast available, unless you keep musician's hours, in which case the World's your oyster.\n\nOkay, now the fun part. Lesla ordered soup du jour, split in two (to share, in other words). The soup, which was celeri (that's the french spelling, just sound it out, et voila!), was outstanding. Simple, delicious and perfect.\n\nI ordered the pate du campagne, (listed as \"country-style), and it took me way, way back to authentic, country-style french pate ... A decent pate, such as those found in super markets and even specialty shops, is really adequate, in its own right, but this was the real deal. If I'd closed my eyes I could have been back on Peel Street, in Montr\u00e9al, where we had a deli on the ground floor of my three storied apartment house, that made their own, on-the-spot, or this family's home on the riviere Dordogne, that I'd \"roomed with\" once upon a time ... mmmm, not 'exciting' (which it doesn't aim to be), but authentic.\n\n For our main lunches, Lesla had the salade Nicoise, and I had the pasta du jour (which would be \"pates du jour\" in accurate french). I tried Lesla's salad, which she just-this-minute reaffirmed  was \"the best I've ever had\" (and she's had quite a few) and it was easily the best I've ever had.\n\nMy pasta, a delightful mix of penne pasta and a tomato-oriented sauce, was delectable.\n\nThe pasta, itself, was 'probably' homemade, but, in hindsight (this is from memory of a couple weeks ago) I can't be sure. The logic of it all (the fact that every aspect of the food was perfect) dictates that it was freshly-made. But with one of the \"thicker\" (i.e., tomato) sauces, it isn't as apparent in hindsight. The \"thinner\" sauces make it easier to distinguish the superior, freshly-made pastas, because one characteristic of the freshness (made-the-same-day) pasta is that it has edges, or surface 'texture' that allows even the thinnest sauce to \"cling\" to it. It's most apparent with \"aglio y olio\", or that amazing \"pasta con vongole\" that I reported on from the Sausalito resto, called Fish, a while back.\n\nSuffice it to say, my pasta was really delicious.\n\nWe skipped dessert, opting for a cappuccino, for Lesla, who reported it as being \"excellent\" and an espresso double (ordered, in engli8sh, as: double espresso), for me. My espresso was-how shall I put this?-adequate. I have a review of another coffee place, back in the Montr\u00e9al area, and I absolve every place I've ever been for having \"really good\" espresso, for most people's tastes, but \"adequate\" (at best) as far as my own taste buds are concerned. C'est la vie, ne c'est-pas? ... bien oui.\n\nI've seen reports for numerous places that discuss, in part, \"rude\" or \"poor\" service, and while it's true that even the saints must have had their share of bad, if overlooked, days, my long, wandering 'experience' has yielded this little 'bon mot', as far as the service is concerned: As ye sow, so shall ye reap. Or, as Otis Redding once said, \"Try a Little Tenderness.\" \n\nCaf\u00e9 Claude is also on a nice lane, in a too-small, but wonderful little 'french-ified' part of San Francisco, and you want to go there, you know you do. So go!\n\nBy the way, the map shows a few garages in the area, but probably the closest (and public/cheaper) one is at Sutter & Stockton (not on the map). Also, the St. Mary's garage apparently has had issues with parking attendants stealing things from cars. Yikes! Consider yourself alerted.", "author": "Brian S."}

Ok, so it was ok, but for the price it should have been a bit better.  First, it took a while to be acknowledged by the waiter and after looking at the cocktail menu and deciding on the drinks and our selection, he quickly said we do not have Campari... huh?  I had to point it out on the menu and they did have it and the bartender did a good job of Campari and soda.  The entrees, Omble Chevalier...(with salmon) and Coq au Vin were fine, but the onion soup was beef broth with no onion flavor, onion bits boiled out of flavor and not even tender were topped with lots of gruyere, the crouton should not have been submersed under the cheese layer and soggy.  What makes a good dining experience is consistent quality throughout, service and food. My husband's beet salad had 3 slices of prosciutto but sliced so thick it was hard to understand what balance could have been achieved among the texture and flavors.

Very heart warming, and very Parisian as my boyfriend says!\n\nThe tiny restaurant hidden by a tightly packed bunch of umbrellas down a dark, tiny alley is a perfect contrast to what is hidden inside. The place was packed! We were seated in a more quiet part of the restaurant, near a wall mural made to look like you were looking through 'glass' to the 'outdoors'. Ok, so it was near the bathroom/storage area, but it wasn't too disruptive.\n\nNow on to the meal...my boyfriend and I ordered the goose liver pate (we asked the waiter if this was the real deal and he said yes, of course, it's a French restaurant!), the onion soup, coq au vin, and the lamb (medium rare). The soup was savory, cheesy, and bready..very hearty! The pate...was simply fabulous. Creamy, not overly rich, smooth, very refined. It was delicious on the dinner bread. \n\nThe coq au vin was strong on the senses - rich, thick sauce, and chicken that fell off the bone. Came with fingerling potatoes, pearl onions, and bits of bacon (?). It was a heady dish. The lamb was not gamey at all, and very delicious. It was delicate on the senses, but the accompanying herbs, beans, and what looked to be pancetta, provided a fusion of flavors on the tongue. In addition, there were two tomato halves covered in finely chopped herbs - very dramatic flavor!\n\nThe service was friendly and enthusiastic, but not in your face or overly attentive. The music was not quite the 'typical' jazz I expected (like lounge). It was more new age this evening, but it could have just been the artists. I'm curious to hear what the other jazz artists that perform there sound like. I love jazz more along the lines of John Coltrane or Miles Davis.\n\nWill definitely be back, can't beat the romantic atmosphere, good eats, and all for a decent price.", "author": "Katherine P."}

She demands I put on some fake eyelashes. I decline.\nWe take the bus downtown and she proceeds to walk me down some sketch looking alley called \"Claude Lane\" off of Bush. I'm scared, but suddenly there are pretty murals on the walls, maroon overhangs, and some white cloth covered tables. \"Cafe Claude\" doesn't have very good signage, but its the one with the maroon overhang. The green overhang belongs to some Irish Pub.\nI'm still confused, so she sits me down and the waiter brings us the menu. First thing I see is \"Croque Monsieur\". I squeal internally since the waiter is watching me. You see, a few weeks ago, well actually...for a couple weeks, I have been lamenting that I won't be able take my trip to Europe this summer as I had wanted. I was complaining that I wanted French food. And I wanted it now. And my mom brought it to me.\nUmm, can you say amazing? And this is during the time when I should be taking her out...I mean, mother's day and all. But anyhow, so I'm having a freaking heart attack of happiness because we pretty much could be in France with the outdoor seating and God help me there are Vespa scooters parked nearby.\nSo we order. Decided to share our courses instead of ordering individual. My choice. Mom took a Lactaid so everything on the menu is free game. Chevre cheese salad to start- chevre goat cheese on toasts, bed of greens tossed in amazing vinaigrette, apple slices, candied walnuts, cherry tomatoes. Standard, but come on guys, the cheese was all crispy on the outside and gooey inside. Mouth orgasm number one.\nFor our entree, Porc au Miel. Umm, sweet things and salty things together is my specialty. Tender pork tenderloin ( was that redundant?) in a honey caramel-ish butter sauce with haricots vert and caramelized apple slices. Rich and a generous serving so I'm glad we shared this.....so we could make room for the pommes frites. Umm, fried in duck fat anyone? And served with ketchup AND some spicy mayonnaise looking thing that I have been missing all my life. I really had to pace myself. I really did. Especially since my mom mentioned chocolate cake. Chocolate anything makes me happy, but recently I've been training myself to be a sort of snob. Valhrona or bust, y'all. So I had some high expectations for that chocolate cake....which ended up being a souffle like contraption under the nickname of Moelleux au Chocolat with creme anglaise. This will be the name of my first born child. I'm sorry Bushi Tei Bistro, my souffle de-virginizing at your place was totally not the real thing. This was it. Melty, but dense, not watery, a intense chocolate sensation that lingered on the tongue. And that creme stuff that looked like condensed milk....with the cool raspberries on top and the heat of the chocolate....No words.", "author": "jeddie k."}

The BF and I drove down to Belden Lane on Sunday evening hoping for a miracle that some of the restaurants would be open so we could enjoy the warm weather - only one of the Belden places was open and it wasn't what we were looking for so we opted to head up to Cafe Claude instead.  It was a great experience - sitting outside, people smoking around us, very European and the service was also very European.  We  weren't rushed between courses, our plates were perfectly timed and I had wonderful wine recommendations based on what I was ordering.  \n\nThe BF got the pasta of the day which was fantastic, albeit it very rich.  My sensitive stomach could only handle about 5 bites before it became grumpy with me.  I opted for the mushroom ravioli as my main which was interesting.  It was not like any ravioli I had ever had before.  It was a semi-large plate of delicious mushrooms in a port reduction sauce and one large flat noodle on top and one large flat noodle on the bottom of the plate.  It was different, but tasty.  We ended up getting four apps and one main plate, and three beverages - all for around $85.  It felt like a steal considering how full we were when we walked, rather, waddled away.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-07-04", "description": "This is yet another late review from our San Francisco visit in October 2011.\n\nThe people who work in the dining room and front of house have wonderful energy and obviously love working at Cafe Claude. I personally believe this makes a big difference especially in the restaurant biz, where the work can be grueling and dealing with the public can be draining. When employees have a passion for what their company represents (or their \"mission\") and can be proud of the product coming out of (in this case) the kitchen - your clientele picks up on this consciously or subconsciously.\n\nSo needless to say the atmosphere is truly wonderful. It's just as much about the employees as the beautiful decor. We started at the bar where the bartender was super nice even though it was very busy. This is something we rarely ever encounter in Washington, DC (bad service town). It was even more refreshing since it was our first time - the bar is small and most everyone else seemed like a regular. We were being treated no differently! How nice. :) The cocktails were strong but balanced and delicious.\n\nI thought the jazz trio was fabulous. They had a singer on a few songs - really nice. These musicians, as well as the singer, are real true-to-life artists. We don't get that at Washington restaurants which made me appreciate them all the more.\n\nAfter about 20-30 minutes at the bar we were seated at our table within 5 or 10 minutes of our reservation. Now this is something that frequently is *not* the case when we have reservations at a Washington restaurant. We're on time but for some reason we cannot get seated until 30-45 mins PAST our rsv. This was not the case at Cafe Claude and was a refreshing change from our experiences at home.\n\nOur waiter was super nice, funny and knowledgeable about the food and wine. We only ordered entrees but he didn't try to up sell or if he did was so casual about it I forgot. This is also another technique which the staff at Cafe Claude could teach to Washington restaurant employees. While I understand the need for up selling - there's a right and wrong way to go about it. Here it was the right way.\n\nAlthough we did not do appetizers we did share a dessert and it was just as delicious as our main courses (which were btw coq au vin, the best we've ever had and pork tenderloin another *the-best-of* ). \n\nWe also ended up ordering cognac and a brandy with our dessert (tart tatin). It was autumn and it just made the dessert and after dinner drinks perfect. \n\nSo restauranteurs, there is no need for your staff to engage in the \"up sell\" if what you offer is thoughtfully prepared delicious and graciously served. \n\nCafe Claude was and still is one of the very best restaurant experience we've had  and will always be tops in our travels on our next visit.\n\nPS - If mgrs, chef or owner(s) read these reviews and have any heart for those of us living far far away from your beautiful restaurant and charming city, is there any way possible to get the recipe for your coq au vin?

With a live band playing, the lighting and decor, the atmosphere deserves a solid 4.5/5. It was a Friday night, the place was cramped, we didn't have reservations and wound up waiting half an hour for a table. We ate outside, which was probably a mistake, because despite the heath lamps, outside you really lost the wonderful atmosphere that indoor seating provides. You can't hear the music, and at night the charm of eating outside wanes a bit. \n\nThe food was just not that great. I had the pasta of the day, which was a seafood pasta in a light sauce. The salmon chunks were over cooked and basically tasted like canned tuna. Other seafood was completely nondescript.

I'm glad I did. Had the glazed pork chops with caramel apples. It was perfect.I'm usually cautious about ordering pork chops at restaurants, either it's overcooked and tough or it's undercooked which will make me sick.

I ordered the French onion soup with the thought that I wouldn't care for the escargot. Both appetizers were fantastic. Who knew I liked snail! When our meals came out they looked fantastic and they tasted just a as good. The steak was cooked perfectly and the sauce on top was delicious. I have to say that I was a little disappointed in the fact that the meal was served with French fries. Kind of took the fancy level down a notch. My girlfriends lamb shanks were amazing!! The lamb fell off he the bone and was extremely flavorful and the vegetables that came with it were equally delicious. We had creme Brule for dessert and just like our dinner it was great.

There was live jazz musicians, low lighting, and intimate parties everywhere. We had reservations and were seated promptly. Our host and waiter were very nice and everything we had was so good! Unfortunately I don't remember what anything was called because i barely looked at the menu, but I know something was braided pork or beef and that was super yummy! The one thing that I did personally order was desert where I had to get the creme brulee! It was so good and possibly even the best part of our meal just cause of my bias to sweets :) Anyways I would definitely come again and if you men are looking for a spot that your lady friends would love, pick Cafe Claude.", "author": "Jackie M."}

Late Autumn, 2009 or October 2009, date range or put late Autumn in French\nif you are going for a pretentious/elegant deal by putting a date you should update it everyday. The food came out 2 minutes after we ordered it frighteningly fast. I bet if you were to reboot your iphone upon placing the order, your food would beat your iphone.

I know it is a bit of a clich\u00e9 for to say that for a French Bistro, but i think it is important to think of your first drink to be an appetizer getting your plate ready for the next course. Anyway, i digress: So, friends kidnapped me from my work for a tasty, all-be-it expensive, lunch.  Since Cafe Claude is right around the corner, i let them lead the way.\n\nWe started with drinks, of course, and then had the stake-tar-tar (15).  Now, let's ponder this little tasty dish which can taste like heaven or cause you to call your mom to save you from stomach cramps.  Well, needless to say it had a soft, silky texture and with just a hint of smoke. TIP: when ordering stake-tar-tar, make sure they use a quail's egg and that hey crack it right in front of you as we recived at Caf\u00e9 Claude.  Do not get skimped with a chick egg as the taste will not mix properly. We did expect the waiter to mix the stake for us for a bit of a show, but we were sadly disappointed when they just gave us the plate and walked away.  Oh well, so much of constancy.\n\nMoving on, we decided to try the sandwiches which we each tried different ones so we can trade. The Croque Madame (11) was smoke, light and with ample veggies. Pan Roti (10) was soft, moist and tasted of rosemary and the Pan Poulet (10) was a bit dry, but the flavor was succulent to the tongue and left a lovely peppery after taste.\n\nYes, I know it might be a bit much for sandwiches, but if you think about it, Subway is only 5 bucks cheaper and these sandwiches came with salad.  This said, I would recommend highly their lunch", "author": "Jai D."}

The service was spotty, with pseudo-French waiters whose best claims to Francaise were their aloof, negligent manners.  We couldn't decide whether their French accents were fake or not.  They sounded odd, and one of them said, \"eXpresso,\"  instead of \"eSpresso,\" which is not a mistake I'd expect a genuine Frenchman to make.  But they forgot at least one order, and failed to refill our drinks, so maybe they were French.\n\nCroque monsieur was great, and onion soup was good.  But the real stars were (as to be expected with purportedly French fare) the desserts!  Creme brulee had excellent flavor (bourbon vanilla) but the texture was far too mottled to be ideal. The Guittard Chocolate Mousse was awesome, with great flavor and perfect texture.  But the Moelleux au Chocolat was absolutely wonderful.  Best dessert I've had in weeks!  It was like a molten chocolate cake, but in a ramekin, with a batter that was perfectly undercooked to yield a moist, soft, slightly dense texture.  Over it was poured creme anglaise that added even more moistness and flavor.

Outside seating are laid out throughout the alleyway with plenty of heaters to keep the chills away.  (Of course, a bowl of french onion soup should cure any and all chill bugs)\n\nWe started the dinner with Coquilles Saint Jacques, which is a seafood mix consist of scallops, shrimp, mussels combined together with Bechamel sauce topped on a scallop shell and sprinkled with bread crumbs.   The flavor balances perfectly with the smooth texture and buttery mouth feel.  The small side of bread with pesto is a wonderful touch.  \n\nFor the main course, I went with Paleron Sauce Poivre Vert; which is essentially a flat-iron steak with special peppercorn sauce.  The meat was seared to a perfect medium-rare with no excessive juices.  The sauce was wonderful and pairs really well with the lean flavor of flat-iron steak.  There's also a side of gratin dauphinois stacked to a beautiful little tower finished with cheese browned to perfection.  The poatoes are absolutely delicious and enough portion size to fill you up in case the meat couldn't quite cure the hunger. \n\nWe finished the night with an order of Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e.  I can't say it's the most spetactular Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e in the world but the crust was perfect and the custard was smooth and delicious.  It has a very authentic French taste to it.  I think you'll really enjoy it if you're a Cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e fan. \n\nOverall It's a great spot for a quick night get away, an opportunity to imagine yourself in Paris without the dollar shock of most French restaurants.  2 main courses, appetizer, a wine and dessert came to $78.", "author": "matt c."}

However, after waiting to be seated for over 30 minutes (we had a reservation) with no apology, explanation, or anything, I became annoyed. Once our food did come, it was all good, except pretty overpriced for what we got. The one exception was the salade de chevre, which was very good. There aren't a lot of veggie options so be prepared to order a couple of small plates, which add up fast. I tried the mushroom ravioli and was a little surprised to find it arrive as a thin, round piece of pasta lying on top of some mushrooms in a port sauce. The mushrooms were tasty, but I was at a loss to understand where the other half of my ONE ravioli was! I always thought that ravioli, by nature, had two sides with something stuffed in the middle. Apparantly not here. The atmosphere was nice though - I think I'll only be back for happy hour.\n\nUpdate 8/29: I have to give one star back after being contacted by the restaurant to apologize for our having to wait. I also received a full explanation of the concept behind the unconventional ravioli. I still don't quite understand that concept (I did live in France for two years and never saw ravioli like this), but still, I applaud them for caring enough about their customer service to respond.

Plus it was raining and my stomach was growling with impatience. So Cafe Claude would have to do.\n\nI had been here for a weekend lunch before, but the atmosphere at night is completely different; it's much more livelier with people hanging out at the bar and a small jazz band in the corner.\n\nWe started off with the special of the day: moules frite, fries and mussels in a delicious white sauce. I've had some good mussels in my lifetime and these were fantastic. I would go back just for this dish.\n\nThe coq au vin was rich, full of flavor, and completely enveloped the senses. Unfortunately, despite it's interesting description, I found the Coquilles Saint Jacques to be a rather disappointing low, the main reason I can't give Cafe Claude 5 stars. It's a mixture of seafood in a creamy sauce topped with bread crumbs and baked on a shell. The taste was just off. It's hard to pinpoint what exactly I didn't like, but after 2 bites, I remember thinking I didn't want to finish it.\n\nI love French places tucked away in little alleyways and Cafe Claude does it well.

According to her, the server was new & inexperienced.  Now, I'm not one to turn down free meals & I can forgive people who are new to the job, so I thought why not?  Nearly a month later, we went back.\n\nI'm not sure what kind of operating structure Cafe Claude works on, but it was kind of chaotic.  When Dana B. & I came in for lunch at 12:30, there was no one at the hostess stand.  We did see the 2 hostesses run around as runners & bussers before acknowledging us, which was interesting.  After a small wait, we were seated.\n\nThe food is still quite yummy & the pommes frites are like crack.  I polished off the entire portion on my own!  We had the same server as before, which filled both Dana B. & my heart with trepidation.  Thankfully, there was no butter spillage this time around.  We did see the waiter knock over a full carafe of water at another table (fortunately, the patrons had already left) & break a water glass at another table while clearing plates (patrons still there).\n\nI did appreciate the GM getting in contact with me though to apologize for our first experience, but this particular server needs serious help in slowing down!\n\nSo, if you dine at Cafe Claude for lunch, the food is excellent, but bonne chance with the server!\n\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\n3.5 Stars.\n\nA co-worker & I ventured here for lunch to enjoy the the outdoor seating.  Claude Lane is much nicer than Maiden Lane--it's more quaint & there were FAR less flying rats--aka pigeons--so we expected a pleasant lunch.\n\n5 stars for the food.\nPortions are much larger than expected, so you definitely get your money's worth.  We started out with the Rillette du Prigord, which was so rich & delectable.  Next, we each got a sandwich (mine was pork tenderloin & hers was the tuna), both of were very good & came with a side salad.  We also split a side of pommes frites.\n\nI docked a 1/2 star for lukewarm water & no ice in our water glasses.  Nothing makes me enjoy a meal more than drinking a carafe of water that has been baking in the sun.\n\nAnother star docked for the lackluster service.  It started out fine, but towards the end, it was super slow & shoddy.  As the servers were clearing away our dishes, they moved so quickly that they splattered melted butter from the butter dish all over my co-worker.  Not the most pleasant ending to a meal.  If Cafe Claude had great customer service, the server would have taken an item off of our final tab, but that didn't happen.  Also, we had to make several requests to get our check.\n\nOh well, c'est la vie.", "author": "Jenny M."}

Oh well...this one is good.\n\nI was getting scared that I picked a tourist trap when we started punting tourists out of our path while we walked by the china town gate, but because Claude \"street\" is a little back alley, this restaurant is camouflaged enough to leave it beyond the sight of the camera haulers. You can sit outside on a heated patio which is walled on 2 sides, thus making it kind of private. We ending up sitting inside - perfect ambiance there. Modern, but not sterile. The right music volume, and the right kind of down tempo. \n\nA very innovative cocktail list for sure. A lot of stuff on there are French takes on classic american drinks. Its impressive the number of things that they were able to pull off that were oh so French, but didn't delve into fusion.\n\nPresentation of our beef tartar appetizer was impressive...they make it for you at your table. The taste matched the presentation - who ever thought a pile of raw meat could be so great? I had the lamb confit, and my friend had the trout. No complaints about either. The carmel/coconut dessert thingy we got (sorry...this was after 3 cocktails...my memory started going fuzzy) was good - perhaps a tad sweet, but it is dessert people.\n\nThis place was truly batting 1.000 for me, and came very close to earning a rare 5 star rating, but our waitress was a little strange. She wasn't mean or rude at all, and I totally dug the fro + kylie minogue giant red hoop earrings, but here were some issues: 1) She had a hard time recommending a drink to my friend (but after 5 minutes of deliberation, she did pick a good one) and 2) After I finished my cocktail, she grabbed my glass and took off with no mention of another - I had to grab the bus boy to request a second. So like I said, weird.\n\nYou could have any kind of dinner here - formal, casual, interview, mom, pre-gaming for bar hopping, etc. would all fit. You just better like French food - they don't do fusion stuff. I'll be back because of its versatility...its a nice little gem in a neighborhood where I typically need to find a diamond in the rough.", "author": "Sean C."}

Or the pate plate-- a little decadent but worth it. \n\nI also love to stop by after a hard day of Christmas shopping when it's really cold out for the the amazing onion soup. it's a small place so it's cozy and most importantly it's walking distance from union square.  The wait staff has over the years has become less surly, but still very french. The  chicken dish is savory and absolutely amazing, it's like a a party is happening on your tongue with all the subtle favors going on.   The pork dish is also dam good.

They're open later than usual (or maybe I'm used to east bay places closing early) so we were able to eat a good meal at 9:30pm. \n\nThe service was a bit slow considering the amount of guests left at the restaurant, but the servers were very friendly, attentive, and helpful. The ambiance was also great. It's really cozy and and the decor has some nice upscale-but-not-snobby touches. \n\nWe started with a french onion soup and the (peppery) pork pate. My sis-in-law got the mushroom ravioli and I got the lamb sirloin. The soup and ravioli were soooo yummy. The pate and lamb were good too, but a little too salty to my taste. \n\nThe food came out slow and on any other day, it would have been perfect, but with my sis needing to study for a final and me having to get up early for work the next day, we felt kind of rushed to eat the main course by the time it came out.

There was a heatlamp overhead that provided just enough warmth for a nice dinner.  There was seating inside but there was a live band and we opted for fresh air and conversation instead.\n\nWe started with a pate dish, we opted to try 3 from their list of 4.  We had the champagne, truffle and rilette.  The rilette isn't your typical pate.  It's more like ground up meat, pressed together.  It wasn't liver so the texure was different.  The champagne and truffle was nice and creamy but honestly, you could have gotten the same from a grocery strore or deli.  Still, it was a good dish.\n\nWe opted to have the large sized steak tartare as an entree and also went with the evening's special...NY steak(8 oz) with foie gras and truffle demi glaze(Yum!).  The steak tartare was highly anticipated as this is the only restaurant I know that serves it. Meat was very good(flank steak), mixied with quail egg, worstershire, mustart and other ingredients.  I was actually disappointed in the dish as the most prominent flavor was mustard.  The dish resembles tuna tartare except with steak.  \n\nThe NY steak was cooked perfectly to our liking and the demi glaze had a hint of foie gras, but couldn't taste the truffle.  The special was $28.  Came with an arugula salad and pomme frites(aka fries).  All 3 items were good. This dish by far was the best of the three we tried, even the pomme frites were good.", "author": "Will I A m."}

In all honesty, I was aiming for Gitane but it was closed for lunch...on a Saturday...near Union Square. This ended up to be a good little find.\n\nAmbiance (4): Loved the little cafe atmosphere and the decor of the place. Clean, semi-modern cafeish, and comfortable with outside seating to boot. It was a little bit chilly that day and the place is in an alley so passed on the outside seating but it was nice to have. According to their website the furniture was recovered from a Parisan cafe so I guess that's that.\n\nFood (4): Good food that hit the spot. The menu was composed of salads, sandwiches, pates, charcuterie options, and some main courses. The main courses didn't pique my interest but the other French cafeish selections were what we were looking for for lunch. Squash soup special (good to go), endive salad (that doubled as lettuce wraps...tasty!), chicken liver pate (I came, I saw, I gobbled it up), and the porc sandwich (a French version of the Cuban sandwich...memories like the corners of my mind). All the food had a nice clean and lively taste. Not too heavy and presented in that French way, if you will, were it seems modest and subtle and not overbearing and excessive (I am looking at you Cheesecake Factory). Great spot for lunch and the little bar looked liked a great place to post up after work. Also, if you are in the mood for some liver action and don't want to hit up fancy French inspired place, you can easily get your fix here.    \n\nService (4): Attentive and friendly server with good recommendations. We felt welcomed and there was nothing lacking overall. \n\nValue (3): All prices were reasonable and again, great spot for lunch. Not sure if the menu changes for dinner. \n\nOverall: This was a great spot to stumble upon. Stop in for a great lunch with great service.", "author": "Alvaro H."}

The Dine about the Town menu was the way to go. I was very disappointed with the pasta. It tasted like hamburger helper. Everything else was pretty good.

Just the way I like it; a quaint little French restaurant down a tiny alley-like, more than street, Claude Lane that serves up some outrageous dishes.  Had the pleasure of dining at this establishment on a first date and it made an already wonderful date, fantastic!  Decor is very traditional French.  Servers are non-traditionally attentive; which was great because we had one hour before a show and when informed, our server made sure our orders were prepared and presented in a timely manner.  My date had the Betterave salade (a wonderful compliment of flavors and contrast of red beets, peas, and feta), followed by the special of the day Plat (believe it was the fillet ragou), paired with their Garnet Pinot Noir...needless to say, she loved it!  I had this incredible Rillette du Perigord cooked in a confit style, which tasted heavenly!  I followed with this absolutely bomb of flavors form the Porc au Miel which i shared with my date,  whom just loved, loved, loved! Also paired with the same wine, and finished with the best prepared sidecar cocktail...again, my date tried and just fell in love!  Noise level was reasonable, and privacy was adequate for an intimate dinner.\nPrice was reasonable, service was great and attentive, and despite my date feeling rushed because of the following show, and the quality and presentation was worthy of a solid 4 stars!!!

I was obsessed with the steak tar tare. Marcel, the former GM, used to come to the table, pour a little olive oil and whisk it into the quail egg on top of the hunk of meat, creating a little mayo/aoli emulsion before mixing it with the onions, capers, mustard, etc.\n\nThey've gone through several different chefs. I hate to be the type of regular that chefs hate, because I like the dependable nature of going to Cafe Claude and knowing what is good: the steak tar tare, french onion soup, charcutarie plate. There used to be an heirloom tomato salad; I completely fell in love, then when the chef changed, the salad disappeared, breaking my heart. \n\nThe service can be inconsistent. Sometimes I feel ignored, other times it's friendly, on point and professional. Recently the service has been very good. I came in at 6:58 pm one night with a girlfriend and Ladies Happy Hour 2 for 1 drinks were just about to end.

I hope so.\n\nThe ambiance is lovely, the menu selection all very tempting, but our 90-minute leisurely lunch (which we'd planned the extra time for) became a hurry to finish.  \n\nAuthentic French atmosphere and cuisine.  I'd like to come back and give the service another chance - and also to hear some live music.  \n\nWell, and because Cafe Claude is just fun to say (I mean, say it with me:  \"Cafe Claude\")!

I will have to admit there are not a lot of choices as a veg and even less, if any, for a vegan.\n\nI settled on the artisan cheese plate with a selection of three cheese (brie, blue, and double cream cheddar...I think). To accompany the cheeses there were candied apricots, fresh blueberries, and a few walnuts. The bread is alright but could be better considering it is a French restaurant. I also ordered a side of sauteed spinach which was great.\n\nThe onion soup looked tasty.

AMAZING. Minced rare steak prepared with a quail egg, tabasco, oil (olive), and other flavors, mixed table side.\n\n2) Escargot - Delicious-with very prominent butter, parsley, garlic flavor and a puff pastry to top it.\n\n3) French onion soup - Delicious- A must-get. Cheesy goodness topped soup that is flavored just right. In other places, this soup tend to get \"too salty\".\n\nEntrees--\n\n4) Filet Mignon - Again, Delicious- Thick filet grilled to perfection with foie gras black truffle sauce\", and fried balls of mash potatoes. In whole, very tasty, but not standout like the appetizers.\n\n5) Porc au Miel - Pork chops - Seasoned slightly sweet (from the caramelized apples and honey cream sauce) very good, but no where compare to NOPA.\n\n6) Pasta of the day - Cannot recall what, but sword fish & tomatoes sauce - The cousin ordered this. Just from the sound of it, does not sound too tasty. I tried a bight from the cousin's dish.. I would pass on this.\n\nCoq Au Vin - Ordered this because of the numerous yelp references. However, I thought this was good, but not outstanding....slightly too salty. \n\nDessert\n7) Mousse au Chocolat - Not too rich, but decadent chocolate flavored goodness. I can eat 100 of these if I dont care at all about my weight.\n\n8) Cr\u00e8me Coconut - I had this here once before and I was thinking about it every night for 2 weeks. This is soooo delicious. Smooth coconut creme flan that was just the right consistency. The bitter coffee/caramelized sugar on top gives it the right touch. The first time I had this, there was little bits of dried blueberries that just capped everything off.  The second time i ordered this, no dried blue berries!!!

We ordered ourselves some drinks and patiently waited until we could order from the dinner menu.  \n\nWe ordered:\n*chicken liver with truffle oil pate - I ordered this b/c most reviews mentioned the pate.  My bf has never had pate and probably never will again after nearly hurling after first taste.  The pate was good, but it's definitely an acquired taste.  I like pate in small amounts, but anything more than that, the rich liver taste is too strong.  This appetizer would be good to share with a few people b/c they are very generous with their portions\n*small steak tartare - delicious with a nice bite provided by the dijon mustard and diced cornichons.  Even with the small order, I think it was too much raw red meat for just two people.  I just can't stomach so much raw red meat and didn't feel too well afterwards.\n*chevre salad - refreshing and so good!  one of the best goatcheese salads I've had.  The salad had crunchy and sweet slivers of green apple, candied nuts and a perfectly tart and light dressing.\n*coq au vin - so savory, hearty, and flavorful!  I loved swiping my bread in the abundant pool of sauce surrounding the chicken.  i just wish the bacon was more crispy.  this dish was the highlight of our meal!\n\nOverall, I think the food is great and service is friendly.

Their sommelier is Sean, who also does the list for Gitane right next door. \n\nI haven't had a bad experience here yet. This is biased though, as they know me and know that I send a lot of my hotel guests here since it's great and just around the corner. \n\nThe menu is classic French bistro food, which would I would choose for my last meal if it ever came down to that.  \n\nBest items on the menu are:  the onion soup, which is perfectly and delicately flavored, not the saltwater that most places try to pass off as French onion soup. The pat\u00e9 is house made and deliciously rich. I'm a huge fan of the escargot en croute and the steak tartare, which has a roughly chopped texture to it which I love. They prepare the tartare tableside as well. \n\nThe coq au vin is a rooster braised in wine for hours so it falls off the bone, wonderfully tender and rich. The lamb is quite good as well. Everything reasonably priced, in my opinion.\n\nNow for the beverage side. \n\nThe list is is almost entirely French with about eight California selections. Most of the wines on this list are under $100, and all very reasonably priced. I love bev programs like this because the wines are super good value. Ask for Alex if you need help navigating the list, he is extremely knowledgeably and good-natured. \n\nIf you're looking for a wine white and can deal with some residual sugar, try Francois Chidaine's \"Les Tuffeaux\", a semi-sweet chenin blanc from Montlouis in the Loire valley.

I loved this place as my boyfriend & I first walked up, adorable in the quaint little alley nestled between a couple other restaurants owned by the same people. We sat outside and it was chilly but we were close to the heater and we were bundled up so it was fine. we got a couple drinks and ordered the steak tartar, it was brought out with all the accompaniments, mustard, pickles, capers & such where our server mixed it for us table side, it was delicious! We also ordered a 3 cheese plate. In the midst of things another couple arrived to the patio, which has 3 long 'community' tables. One table was full of one party, our table and the third table only had one couple each, leaving 6 more seats per table. We were really having a nice quiet romantic time and out of 12 seats available they chose to sit right next to us, practically on top of us. We were going to have dinner here, but it just got awkward and intrusive, very inconsiderate. Our server, Yamona, was trying her very best to be accommodating, she could see we were uncomfortable. She offered to give us a little single two-top table where two ladies were finishing up with coffee, so we ordered another drink and decided to wait while we finished our cheese plate. Unfortunately the ladies were taking quite some time, meanwhile the couple next to us seemed to get more and more irritating. So we decided to just head out and get a bite somewhere else. Our server felt so bad, she asked if we'd like to move to a table inside, we declined and so before bringing us our check she brought us a complimentary bread pudding. She was a great server and really expressed a genuine concern. It's nice to have real kind service. We will be back to stay for dinner next time! Thanks Yamona & Cafe Claude", "author": "K W."}

Had a reservation on a Wednesday night. It wasn't too busy but waited quite a while for the staff to notice me and check me in.  Ordered wine (bar staff were friendly and helpful, allowing me to taste a few wines before deciding on a bottle).  Had one of the pates to start, and it was pretty good. But half way through it, the waitress brought out the main course (we had both ordered the coq au vin)!  I said that we would like to finish our first course, before starting on the second course, so she took the food away. Is this 'normal' to be served the main course whilst still enjoying the appetizer??  Unfortunately, when we had finished the pate it seemed the waitress didn't want to serve us (perhaps she was embarrassed by her mistake?) and so it took a while for the plates to be cleared and the main course brought out.  And that's when Cafe Claude really went down in my opinion....  the two plates of coq au vin that had been brought out 25 minutes earlier had been sat under a heating lamp, and were now brought back to our table!!!  The plates were dangerously hot and an unpleasant 'skin' had formed on top of the food.  Surely a restaurant such as Cafe Claude could manage to serve up 2 fresh plates?!  The food was just fine, though certainly nothing to write home about.\nFor dessert, we had the creme brulee, which would have been very nice, had it not been warm on the outside and cold in the middle.\nAll in all, I really believe Cafe Claude can do better.  But for the $$$, I'm not sure I'll try/risk it again.", "author": "Izzy A."}

The steak tartar was amazing and the coq au vin was wonderful as well. The only reason I did not give them a 5 star was their by the glass wine list and the escargots . My husband and I tried 3 of the reds and did not like any of them. With France having such an amazing selection of wines from small growers that are reasonable price, I was surprised to find such a disappointing selection. I stuck with the champagne which was nice. The escargots had a breaded topping which I didn't like and the flavor was not the traditional butter and garlic. To finish off our meal we had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e which was delicious and perfectly made. All and all I would recommend this restaurant but probably by a bottle if you want a decent red wine.", "author": "Kenda H."}

I was a bit out of it when I arrived. \n\nATMOSPHERE: I don't know - I was just recovering from a 6 hour nyquil-induced nap that knocked me out for the duration of my flight in.

The waiter was just like \"hokay\" and brought us one dish of pasta and six french snails. At first we thought it was peculiar that only one of us had pasta, but we figured since its a french establishment, maybe they were playing up the whole chivalry thing and serving the girl (wayyyy) before the men at the table. We realized this was not the case after we slurped down our snails, and by combining our powers of deductive reasoning, collectively came to the conclusion that our order had in fact been misinterpreted (understandably so). When we brought it to our waiter's attention, he began to defend himself, but stopped himself, apologized, and went to the kitchen to remedy the situation. He made our two additional dishes of pasta du jour top priorities in the kitchen and we were inhaling our orders minutes later.\n\nFOOD: Awesome.

Ignore the voice.\n\nCafe Claude is a charming place, from the shaded outdoor seating to the tables packed in their small space. The hostess, who sounded French, was extremely gracious and found us a table at lunch on a Friday without a reservation. \n\nAnd the food, oh the food. To be honest, the bread basket that starts the meal contains sub-par French bread. But the small dish of beautifully fresh and creamy butter that accompanies the bread more than makes up for it. The menu isn't large, but there's something for pretty much everyone on it. I ordered a croque monsieur, which came with frites and a small salad of arugula . You're definitely doing yourself a disservice if you don't get it. I haven't had a croque monsieur this good since Paris, and the bechamel was perfectly seasoned. One word of caution, however. If you do get the croque, you'll most likely have to defend your frites from your suddenly agressive dining companions. They're that good.\n\nMy dining companions had the pan roti sandwich, which was amazing, and the quiche lorraine, which was disappointing compared to the sandwiches. \n\nOverall, if you're looking for somewhere to have a nice French meal and good wine (and you don't mind splurging), Cafe Claude is the place to go (but make a reservation!).", "author": "Victoria N."}

My love affair with french food is actually relatively new and I am not sure how I discovered this love, but it is here and Cafe Claude made my Sunday in the city just perfect.  This place is a hidden gem tucked neatly in a dark alley near Union Square and as soon as you walk up you see the darling tables on their small patio and you immediately think you are in Paris.  It was a chillier night in San Francisco, so we decided to sit inside and we were given a cute little table for two tucked in the back of the main dining room.  Not only do I have a new love of french food, I also have a new love for gin based cocktails, so I was thrilled to see an extensive list of specialty cocktails. I ordered one, can't remember the name, but it certainly was delish!  We started with the onion soup and it was perfect! The cheese melted across the top, the salty/oniony steam, the perfectly grilled crouton, the perfect onion soup.  For our entree, I had the veggie lasagne and my husband had the Ahi tuna, both amazing.  My hub wins the award for better meal of the evening, but we thoroughly enjoyed both.  Unfortunately we skipped dessert, which I almost NEVER do, but we had a box of ghiradelli chocolates waiting for us in our room.\nThe only, and I mean ONLY reason I am not giving Cafe Claude 5 stars is because our service was a little slow.

This place is real nice for client meetings, dates and small celebrations with family and friends.

I am not sure if the meal took that long because service was slow or if they try not to rush you, but either way I enjoyed myself.  Everything on the menu was very good, the pasta of the day was only so-so, and the desserts left something to be desired.  The waiter was a bit snobby, but I don't particularly mind that, and a bit intrusive when clearing the table (NOTE: his elbow was put right in my face several times).  The ambiance of the restaurant, aside from being a bit loud, is very nice, as is the outdoor seating, and I love the fact that it is tucked away in a little alleyway away from the hustle and bustle of Sutter.  I will definitely be going again.\nP.S. Reservations very much recommended.", "author": "John T."}

It is a bit hard to find so keep your eyes open for Claude Lane. amidst all the clothing stores.  The staff was great - helping us immediately with our stroller and wet umbrellas.  They efficiently sat us down and so started the excellent service.  They answered our questions and went about making sure that we were comfortable.  They even took our stroller inside and kept it until we were ready to depart.\n\nI was not as hungry so I settled on the chicken sandwich which was basically grilled chicken breast, bib lettuce, tomato, mayo on a soft bread roll.  Wow!  All I can say is the homemade mayo and the fresh baked bread made this sandwich very good.  Accompanying the sandwich was an uninspired green salad tossed lightly with a vinagrette.  It is amazing how simple ingredients prepared fresh and served without fanfare make for the best dishes.  My wife got the special - lamb shoulder with root veggies.  She ate it all up before I got a taste.  Must have been good.\n\nMy mother ordered the salmon with pesto.  The salmon was grilled nicely sitting upon seasonal veggies with plenty of pesto drizzled about.  Likewise, I did not get a taste.  She said it was delicious.  \n\nOkay, now the little nits.\n1) The water glasses are very clean - there was something scary and black floating around my glass.\n2) The bowl that contained the bread had a dried up piece of spinach or other greenery stuck on the insides.\n\nBut the service their is great and they really take care of you.

I must have come on an off night--it was Wednesday--because my friend said that it was excellent when he went.  Maybe it's because I had to order sole, the most boring fish on the planet.

The creme brulee was horrible.  The sugar crust was way too thick, and the cream didn't taste right.  \n\nThe servers were hot, but incredibly rude.  It was a freezing San Francisco night and I was seated near the door.  WIth my scarf, hat and gloves I was still cold.

The inside is really cozy and romantic, but it's kind of annoying that all the tables are so close to each other so I'm sure everyone around or next to you can hear your conversation. With that being said I opted to sit outdoors and it was at a good temperature with the heat lamps and all. However I kind of wish I sat inside since there's not much to look at when you're outside in an alleyway.....(the only alleyway I'd dine at is probably the Belden place one since you get that feeling that you're in a diff place/country as opposed to Claude) I think the staff here is really nice and helpful as for the food it can be better. The image of my entree is still vividly in my mind...not for the better in this case. I got the trout and when it came out I nearly lost my appetite. I was expecting a nice filet of fish to be nicely decorated and cut but it was just a regular trout with skin and all....i mean it tasted all right but it didn't look appetizing at all =/ the coq au vin tasted good but le charm's is better.

I made reservations the day before after reading yelp reviews and also one of my book club members LOVES this place. Got a 6:30 reservation and thought we would have a long, romantic meal before seeing a new movie at the Westfield. \n\nAs we walked up the little street that Cafe Claude is tucked away on, we were reminded of Europe and the fine restaurants that line the tiny cobblestone streets. We were excited. We were seated immediately, despite being 10 minutes late. The table was squished in between two other two tops, and we were close enough to the other two couples on dates that I kinda felt like we were all in it together. Like it wouldn't have been out of line for me to put my fork on their plate and grab a bite. But I resisted. After listening to the conversations on both sides of us (we have discovered that this is what a lot of couples do after they have been together for almost a decade, listen in on the people on first dates and make amused faces at each other rather than cover old ground). Our waiter approached and asked if we would like cocktails. Yes, we did. GF ordered a delicious sounding margarita type thing and I ordered something that I attempted to pronounce with a french accent. When in Rome. Our waiter was not amused, and sternly told me that he clearly speaks english. Hmm. Not off to a great start. Well, nothing a good cocktail can't fix, and they were both worth the $11 (see previous review). For dinner we decided we would get the french onion soup, the coq au vin and the mushrooms. Hands down the best thing was the mushrooms. Man, if I went back in time, I would order the mushrooms for all three courses. Delicious.\n\nAll of it was good, and the live jazz was real nice (GF said it reminded her of the jazz flute part in Anchorman) and relaxing. However, our waiter just seemed mildly annoyed at us throughout the whole meal. I could tell he took his job very seriously, and was probably excellent with people who knew their wine and french food. Nothing (except the mushrooms) stood out and made me say \"I'll be back to this place again and again and again!\".", "author": "Natalie D."}

I went for dinner last night with two of my girl friends after a couple cocktails at the St. Francis. Slightly buzzed and super hungry, our eyes were a little bigger than our tummy's and we ordered way more food than we needed. That being said - we cleaned every plate.\n\nOur server was very knowledgeable about the menu including the cocktails and wine, and gave us just the right amount of attention - I don't like server's who disappear but I also don't like the stage five clinger server's who are at your table every 2.5 seconds bugging you. Sidenote: he was also easy on the eyes. I might go back just for him.\n\nAnyway...the food! We ordered the cheese plate to start because we were starving. This is probably the only thing I wouldnt order again. Small portions and not very exotic cheese - it tasted like brie, machego and mild white cheddar. Although the fruit accompanying it was great. Next the french fries. I don't even like french fries, and I loved these french fries and I loved loved the dipping sauce. For entree's we each ordered something different and of course all tried each others. The pork was the best by far, followed by the ahi and the rack of lamb. All three plates were presented as deliciously as they tasted. Lastly - dessert/my favorite part of any meal. Creme brule and flourless chocolate cake - I was a happy girl.\n\nI went to bed smiling post Cafe Claude - buzzed from the french wine, full from a great dinner and amazing dessert, and giddy like a school girl from the hot waiter.

My one gripe is the close proximity of the tables to each other...so much so that the girl at the table next to us interjected in our conversation in order to point out that my friend was right and I was wrong in regards to our discussion.   How the shit am I supposed to make facts up to impress my friend when I have wikipedia- lady within earshot of the conversation?   If this were a family style restaurant then proximity is cool...but don't expect to have any private, intimate conversations here.\n\nService was ok.  Always friendly and accommodating, but never proactive.    Every stage of the process, from ordering wine all the way up through getting our check required us to call a waiter to our table.   That's just not good service...but again, their friendly attitudes somewhat made up for their ninja-like invisibility.\n\nThe important part, of course, is the food.  I had the Ahi tuna tartare with goat cheese and a nifty quail egg sitting on top.  It was well presented and incredibly tasty.

Good news because guess what you guys need it! I have been eating at cafe claude at least once a month with my mother on Saturday afternoons. The food has always been good and the service okay.  Nothing spectacular but nothing awful, until the past week. We had an 12:15 reservation. We get there at 11:45 and it's empty. We ask to sit in the window the RUDE receptionist looks at her ipad and says it's reserved. There were two open tables, I ask about the other one. She says she can't sit us there. Then we ask if we can sit in the front part of the restaurant, she glimpses over and goes the only thing we can offer is in the back or one tiny squeezed in two-top. We opt for that. The waitress is rude, doesn't read the specials, doesn't take drink orders.  Finally we just order, I get the butter lettuce salad and my standard croque-monsieur. My mom had the quiche. The salad was wilted and over dressed. My mom's quiche was cold and my sandwich was burned cold as were the fries.  I complained to the waitress so she brought out more fries but when the bill came, she charged us for everything even the extra fries. So sad to say they just lost a regular.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-05-18", "description": "On a brisk day in San Francisco, my girlfriend and I were meeting for lunch.  Going back to my old hood, I knew parking would be a problem so I pulled into a nearby lot and made it to a small alley called \"Claude Lane\" and found Cafe Claude.\n\nWhat an adorable place this is!\n\nThe restaurant has a spacious patio area with perhaps 15 tables or so, and a swanky interior that one would not expect to find in this alleyway.  We had made reservations, and entering the restaurant, I was quickly greeted by a friendly bartender with a wonderful smile, and soon, the host.  I asked about outdoor seating, and was swiftly seated outside.\n\nOur waitress was French, and very attentive.  I ordered a glass of Sauvignon Blanc while waiting for my friend (1 pm PST, but 5 pm somewhere in the world) and took in a deep breath.  It was one of those moments where you really appreciated living in San Francisco.  On a glorious May afternoon - the weather was simply perfect.\n\nOnce my friend arrived, we ordered a glass of wine for her and were chatting too much to even look over the menu.  The server came by twice, and we asked for yet another 5 minutes, and she was ever-so-pleasant about it.  It's one of those very tempting menus - with daily specials and a fine mix of France and some Italian fare.  We finally decided that we would share a french onion soup, arugula salad, a pork tenderloin sandwich with pomme frites.  We happily chowed on the fabulous bread while waiting for our order.\n\nThe soup arrived, and it looked good.\nNow, let me say that I am picky about french onion soup.  When it's good, there is nothing like it.  I will never forget an bowl of french onion soup I had on a freezing cold afternoon in Paris, sitting at one of the outdoor patios on Champs Elysees, thinking life was truly wonderful.  Sitting at Cafe Claude was as close to that moment I would get while on this continent, and I was looking forward to it.  But as my spoon entered  the soup, I could tell immediately that it wasn't hot enough.  The cheese should not sit atop this soup like a pie crust.  We ate about half without complaint, but when our server asked how it was - I casually told her it was  good but not hot enough.  It was PROMPTLY taken away with apologies to heat up - but 30 seconds later, a man that seemed like the manager came by and apologized, while informing us that a brand new soup would be coming out immediately.\n\nA+ in service!\n\nThe arugula salad was extremely good - fresh and tasty.  The pomme frites were crisp and fried perfectly - though I am a bigger fan of thick steak fries.  The sandwich was outststanding with every flavor bursting alive.  My friend requested their aioli - and spread that on the bread, and it was a match made in heaven.\n\nWhen all was said and done, we had been there for 2.5 hours (and they never made us chatty girls feel rushed) and gone through several glasses of wine each.  Mostly due to the wine, the bill came to about $90 before taxes / tip  - and I should note, the cost for  food alone was reasonable.  \n\nAfter lunch, it was a quick walk to the shops in Union Square where we \"whored\" out our eyes to all kinds of temptations, and worked off the calories by briskly walking from store to store.  \n\nCafe Claude is appropriate for virtually everything.  Whether it be a business lunch, or a girl-date like I had - or even a romantic evening date, Cafe Claude fits the bill for almost everything.  The only exceptions would be very large, rambunctious birthday parties or events that would otherwise ruin the quaint, intimate and romantic setting for other patrons.  \n\nFactor in the truly professional and respectful service, real Frenchies as servers with great food --  and Cafe Claude makes my \"Date List\" for sure.\n\nNext time:  DESSERTS!", "author": "Grace K."}

I had high expectations after reading Yelp reviews.\n\nThe restaurant is tucked away in a somewhat shady alley, but the interior was very modern and nice. I was a little surprised that they didn't have coat check, especially considering how little room there was between adjacent tables (difficult to stash your thick coats and bags).\n\nThe waitress was lovely, and she was very attentive and helpful, especially when we were trying to choose our wine.\n\nI was pretty disappointed with the food. I really wanted to like this place! The bread they brought out was cold and tough, and the butter, though soft and @ room temperature, was unsalted :( But of course it wasn't that big of a deal since they had salt and pepper grinders right at the table.\n\nI got the coq au vin, which from the reviews, should have been fantastic. Did I miss something? Did I go on a bad day? It was one of the most bland dishes I've ever had at a restaurant. I am typically very sensitive to salt and I tend to undersalt my food when I cook, but I found myself reaching for salt multiple times during my meal. The mushrooms and the bacon were tasty, but both the chicken and potatoes were seriously underseasoned. Even when I tried to soak up the sauce with the chicken pieces, this hardly improved anything, because the sauce didn't really have much flavor. This whole experience might have made more sense if I had completely blown my palate by eating something strongly flavored for an appetizer, like olives or something, but all I had was bread and butter. Also, parts of the chicken still tasted alcoholic :'( Lastly, I was expecting the pearl onions to be more tender, but they weren't really cook through (but maybe they are supposed to be this way?). I had to ditch them because I didn't want to eat get stinky breath from eating almost-raw onions..\n\nBoyfriend had cod and stewed bell peppers and tomatoes. The fish was okay, and I liked the bell peppers, but my boyfriend didn't like them too much because they were too vinegary.\n\nFor dessert, we had apple tart. It was really small (too small to share), but tasty.\n\nAll in all, I was disappointed. I was really looking forward to this dinner, too! I'll probably try Bouche next time. I doubt I'll be coming back to Cafe Claude.\n\nBTW: Don't get there too early if you want to enjoy the live music. I was really looking forward it but they didn't have it for my 6:15 reservation (not too surprising, I guess). It was obviously my fault for not checking out the details carefully, but this made me a little sad :(", "author": "Jieun C."}

We started with the cheese plate which was very worth it even without the honeycomb which they failed to mention was replaced by honey. We ordered the French Martini's and they were decent although not spectacular, although I did manage to order a second one. For our mains we had the Pork with apples and the Steak (skirt steak although they call it by another name). Both were outstanding and you would not go wrong with either dish. The portions were good sized and we were stuffed but still wanted to do the creme brulee which was one of the better ones I have had.

During a business lunch meal, I tried the large steak tartare (don't mess around with the small unless you have a small appetite, it's only a $3 difference).  Now at first, I guess some people might be a little weirded out since it's literally just raw meat mixed with a raw quail egg, capers, and other spices.  But disregarding the possibility of contamination of bacteria/parasites that comes with consuming raw beef, it definitely is a very recommended experience.  It goes best with some kind of bread/crackers and the entree does come with 4 croutons (not quite enough for the amount of meat you get in a large steak tartare).

The ambiance was perfect- tucked away in an adorable alley with multiple covered outdoor areas for the few restaurants, which I assume are owned by the same people, with heat lamps and a setting that reminds you of a perfect version of France.  Inside it was dimly lit but not stuffy, and we were immediately seated at a table in the cozy but comfortable front room. \n\nI got a sparkling brut rose to start from France at the suggestion of our waiter and it was great.  So many things on the menu stood out, but finally I decided on an onion soup to start and splitting the Poulet Roti, a roasted chicken, and the macaroni side.  The soup was better than some I've had in Paris- the broth was so flavorful and rich and the cheese was brown and bubbly on top.  The bread served with it was impossible to stop eating.  The chicken that came next was amazing.  It was served with grilled chard and black olives with a light and perfect broth like sauce at the bottom of the dish.  The skin was crispy and the inside was cooked through while staying moist, which is rare since hardly anywhere cooks chicken the way I prefer.  The side of macaroni was incredibly rich so you only wanted a little, but it was a great accompaniment.  It was creamy and rich with tiny cubes of lardons and an herb and breadcrumb top.\n\nI don't know what could have made this meal better.

Instead of going to my usual haunts, decided to try something new.  She was staying at the Hyatt Union Square so it was VERY convenient.  Made reservations on OpenTable and we were promptly seated.  We had a lot of catching up to do so based on other reviews that I read indicating that service was very fast - we slowed things down and ordered one at a time.  Started with a nice glass of Gloria Ferrer champagne ($11) and a 3 cheese selection (a double cream; goat cheese; and a harder cheese - cannot remember what kind).  It was service with nice dark nutty bread, and a small pot of honey and a chutney like spread.  Very tasty.  Had a bottle of French pinot noir for about $65.  One of the cheaper bottles on the menu.  We each had a starter salad and it was very fresh.  It is a small salad and not suitable for sharing.  We did share the entr\u00e9e - Coq au Vin.  Delicious!  It was slow cooked, with a dark roux-like sauce, and tender veggies.  Presentation was nice as it was served in a skillet.  We passed on dessert - were given menus but were not hungry for it.  About half way through our meal (we were seated at 6 and left around 8:30) a nice jazz band started playing.  They set up in the front of the restaurant and we were about 2/3 of the way into the restaurant so it was the perfect noise level.  It would have been too loud if we were sitting closer.  The service was VERY good - prompt with the water refills.  They did not rush us out of the restaurant.  Did not offer bread with the entr\u00e9e but promptly delivered it when we requested it.

I hesitated before agreeing since the first time I'd been here, I had such an awful experience. Not only was the food mediocre at best but we had to wait an hour for our entrees! \nSince my friend loved it so, I decided to give it another try. This time, service was actually good! Our waitress was friendly and the food came out in a timely fashion. \nThe bread was a little on the stale side. \nWe started w/the Tuna Tartare - instead of avocados, they used goat cheese. Very interesting flavors and definitely full of flavor. Not bad! \nI had the special of the day - mahi mahi w/mashed potatoes and grilled bell peppers. I was a little bland for my taste. \nShe had the lasagna which was sprinkled with something sweet which she liked, even though we couldn't figure out what it was. lol. It was decent. \nThere was a live jazz band playing that night by the bar. Def. a romantic setting. \n1 star for my first dining experience \n2 for my second \nAlthough my company has always been amazing, the food itself remains abysmal.", "author": "Cheryl P."}

The wine was a 4 oz pour for $15! from the Russian River!\n\nFood was good and service was great! We really liked the cute alley way and the restaurant decor. If you don't mind paying a lot for the \"wine by the glass\" it's a 4 star. But, it's a 3 star in our mind. \n\nI'd suggest they add a \"house wine\" option (white and red) or a larger selection of wines by the glass at $7-$10 per glass.

Thanks to Goldstar (if you sign up, mention my name) and their half-price tickets, Li'l Big Man and I found ourselves on the way to a fabulous ACT play \"The Quality of Life\".  Not wanting to drive and be faced with a huge parking bill, we BARTed, with enough time left over to enjoy ourselves in The City.  Taking MontgomSt exit, we strolled up to Cafe Claude.\n\nIt was a spectacular warm evening, and as we approached the little alley it is in, I had a flashback to a similar evening in Paris, and another small street lined with restaurants and filled with animated diners.  Cafe Claude, long a favorite of mine, completed the illusion perfectly, as our gracious French waitress, charmed by my son's perfect French, served us our guiltiest pleasure decadent dishes: escargot for the boy, tender, with just the right bit of garlic, basil, butter and pastry shell; a trio of pates for mom - rillettes, almost sweet and cardomom-y, truffle pate, and a sauterne pate, both sensuously creamy and fine-textured.  Steak tartare, expertly mixed by our waitress \"a table\", a lovely mixed green salad with just the right amount of dressing to give us a break from all that richness, and last but not least, the flourless chocolate cake \"moelleux\", more like a souffle than a cake, with Creme Anglaise in a pitcher alongside, just in case the heart-stopping luxury of the confection wasn't enough by itself.\n\nAt no time did they treat my 13-year old like he was anything less than a true gourmet, possibly because he was pronouncing everything so much more correctly than me.  As we sipped the last of a perfect cappuchino and sighed contentedly, we marveled at how much pleasure a meal could bring.  Then we strolled through Union Square, with the beautiful lights and mix of modern and old urban sensibilities, and felt ourselves lucky to live where we do.

The fries were also a hit with the group.  4 Entrees, 4 glasses of wine, 2 desserts = $220 with tip.

It's just a few little steps down Claude Lane, off of Bush St near Grant, and it's the cutest little spot for a tete a tete. \n\nMy hubby and I were staying at Hotel Des Arts, just a couple doors down, and made reservations for dinner at Cafe Claude on the recommendation of a fellow Yelper. My first impression started at the phone call. The woman was very friendly, and she didn't act like I was calling last minute for a spot the next evening. She simply told me that either of the times I requested were available, and happily booked me for one of them.\n\nThen, when we arrived, the hostess greeted us with a friendly, \"Bonsoir!\" took our names, and walked us to a nice little softly lit table. \n\nThe waiter (wish I could remember his name) with a French accent, was SO helpful with our choices... even to recommending that I not order the haricot verts with the coq au vin because it wasn't a great combination, and he suggested the soup du jour, which we both LOVED... it was a cream of bell pepper soup, which my hubby finished completely, so the waiter left his spoon in case he wanted to help me finish mine. LOL. Also, when I ordered a cheese plate, the waiter said that if we felt too full to get a dessert, that we could cancel the cheese platter later. We ended up doing so, as I fully enjoyed my coq au vin, which was very flavorful and the chicken very tender, and my side of gratin dauphinois (cheesy potatoes) so that by the end, we probably shouldn't have even had dessert, but he convinced us to try the flourless chocolate cake with creme anglaise, and it was perfectly small and delish!\n\nAlso, we managed to get our first drinks during happy hour, and when we were nearing the end, the waiter told us that if we wanted to order more, to let him know then, as happy hour would be ending... we got $4 'tini's, mine a 'Cucumber Presse' and his an 'Orange Dreamsicle'. Not only that, but they give you the little solitaire shaker so you can top yourself off when you finish up your first glass! Can you say halleluja? HALLELUJA, mes soeurs et mes freres!  \n\nAt the end of our meal, we looked at the damage and were happily surprised that with our four drinks, soups, main courses, side dish and dessert, that we came just to $100. That is, until the waiter realized that he'd left the cheese plate on there and took it off, and then our total was UNDER $100!  Can you believe it? We were ready to pay and they tell us, 'Oops! We charged you too much, let us take that off your bill...' \n\nBetween the cozy romantic feel of the place, to the delicious food, to the excellent service and affordable price, I'd have to say that this was one of my favorite dining experiences in San Francisco. For serious, people. This place rocked.\n\nSo go! Eat! Be merry, at Cafe Claude! Bon appetit!", "author": "Shari D."}

I used to be a big fan of this place.  I liked the decor, the service was always good, and the french onion soup was nothing to shy away from.  However, I was highly disappointed with one of my last visits.  Well in advance, I made reservations for 8pm on a Friday.  Let me rephrase that....I made reservations for 8pm on Bastille Day.  My dining companion and I arrived on time, as usual. ( i have this thing about being late I just think it is rude!) We were told that it would be about 5 minutes, perfectly acceptable for a busy french holiday at a trendy-ish french restaurant.  Now, being smashed like sardines on Claude lane with all of the other people that seem to want celebrate their french heritage (ie. an excuse to drink heavily) with no wine in hand, we started to become a little annoyed.  Our dinner reservations were at 8 and it was 8:45.  OK fine.  I admit I am very impatient, but being Bastille day and all I was trying to let it slide.  until...until...my friend asked to use the restroom.  She was told no \"I am sorry, I can't let anyone in.\" says the roided out big man in the yellow jacket in the deepest toughest voice ever.  Apparently the words \"staff\" written on the his back made him oh so important for the evening.

We had gone to Union Square earlier to look at the large Christmas tree and to do some last minute Christmas shopping.

This restaurant is located a couple of blocks from northeast of Union Square.  It was cold that night, and we preferred to sit inside.  However, all the tables inside were booked, so we decided to stay and eat outside.

The waiters are definitely willing to pratiquer en francais avec vous.  The food is awesome and reasonably priced.  The have demi bouteilles de vin (the rose is GREAT from the Rhone region in France) and we ended the lunch with a couple rounds of Pastis...A+++++++ for food, service, and atmosphere.  If i worked in the Financial District, I would be here every day for lunch.", "author": "Jenny W."}

This very charming and very French cafe and bar, as we soon discovered, is a perfect stop for after work cocktails. Around 6 pm it was not too cold, so we opted to sit outside on the patio without the aid of a heat lamp. Our waitress quickly took our order of three very different cocktails. I decided I would try a drink composed of pear liquor, elderflower syrup, and coconut, while Kenny decided to be oh so adventurous and order a ho hum margarita that you could probably get anywhere. Taka's cocktail was rather unique- gin with green tea and some other flavorings which I cannot remember. The drinks arrived in martini glasses, the extras saved in individual small shakers. The coconut concoction was perfectly clear, so much so I could have mistaken it for water. Tasting sweet, smooth, and mostly of coconut, this tropical drink was a big hit at our table, especially for Kenny, who,  as expected, decided that his drink was boring, and begged to switch with me. As I was in a kind and sharing mood, I let Kenny have my drink and I took the margarita which was pretty standard, save the fancy presentation in a martini glass. The green tea- gin cocktail was surprisingly tasty as well. \nWhile we only stuck around for one round of drinks (after all, we were headed to Zeitgeist) we did not get to try their food which, by one look at the menu would appear to be quite special.

The alleyway is a charming backdrop for an impressive jewel-box bistro.  \n\nThe food: simple, well-prepared, French inspired classics ranging from steak tartar (prepared tableside) to onion soup.  (Both of which are worth coming here for alone).  Don't miss their cheese plate--the Brillat-Savarin is a turophile's fantasy.  With entrees under $20 and a decent wine list, Claude is perfect for a low-key, spontaneous dinner.  \n\nThe staff here is attentive and very accommodating.  I have always had great service, even when it's busy (and it does get busy).  The only downside to this otherwise excellent restaurant are the restrooms, which are shared with the rest of the building.  It's jarring to step into the dingy common hallway to access the restrooms when enjoying an otherwise fantastic dining experience.\n\nOne last consideration:  for the smokers out there, they have a few tables outside where they'll let you light up to your heart's content (the alley isn't too windy and there are heat lamps to cut the chill).", "author": "Elijah T."}

Although this popular restaurant and bar has a pretty intimate atmosphere, you'll find a lively crowd accompanied with live jazz here Thursday through Saturday nights. I haven't been in years and figured it was time to refresh my memory, so my friends and I came for a visit. As we walked up, we passed by the folks dining outside and could hear the cool music coming from the windows. =)  \n \nBy the time we sat down, we were all starving. Raechelle is a huge charcuterie fan, so we shared the platter of artisanal meats and pickled veggies. We also shared the endive salad with blue cheese and walnuts, which was fresh and light. In between courses, we kept peering over at the steak tartare that was being served tableside next to ours. It looked so good. We told eachother we would defnitely come back for that next time. For our mains, Joann and I were feeling carniverous and opted for the flat-iron steak. My steak was a little tough but I still enjoyed it....I just kept thinking I should've ordered it \"medium\" not \"medium well'. Raechelle had the trout with haricots verts & toasted almonds which she thought was just okay. I think she would have enjoyed it more if it had no bones.

The location is a bit hidden, which I like because it seems like you are going to a secret spot... although, it is good... and as such it is hard to keep it a secret.  As you walk up to the alley it is located in... you all of the sudden feel like you are transported to a land far away... well... as long as you don't sit outside looking towards Bush street. But no worries... they have this divider up to cover that up... so... you don't really see it if you sit outside.  \n\nThis place can get a little packed at times, so make sure to make a reservation or go at an off time (as in, not at noon for lunch) because it gets a little harder to find a spot.) The d\u00e9cor is very nice, a bit dark, so it totally gives it that feel like you are in a little bistro in Europe.  This last time I went, I ordered the Saumon, that would be Salmon for us non French speakers. This dish is just delightful!  Everything from the presentation to the flavors is great!  This dish is pan seared salmon with fava beans stew, pistou (this is Pesto), egg plant caviar, and basil leaves. All for the wonderful price of $13.   Since I was working... I decided against being a lush... I got the iced tea... perfect brew, light and tasty. My lunch companion sampled the Pan Bagnat which is albacore tuna with aioli, capers, shallots, ni\u00e7oise olives, tomatoes, crumbled egg, and anchovies.

Walking down the alley you almost feel as though you are in Europe.  Upon entering you were consumed with everything French.

We notified the waiter of our luke warm soup and they didn't miss a beat and brought it back tot he kitchen and served us another piping hot bowl.  Soon thereafter we had the pleasure of watching our steak tartar being prepared table side.  All eyes appeared to be on us, as this is a dying art in dining.  The tartar was to perfection, rich with just the right amount of spiciness from the mustard as we requested.  This was paired with an endive, bleau cheese, green apple and candied walnut salad.  All washed down with a beautiful 2000 Bordeaux.  (We ordered a half carafe realizing later that we were only charged for a glass, too late we were already home when this was discovered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-09-26", "description": "Serendipitously profound.\n\nTo start off, we both had randomly selected this restaurant on our own accord.  It's quite amazing that when we touched base that day, we both came up with Cafe Claude.\n\nThe venue itself is tucked away into the many nooks and crannies the FiDi possesses.  If you walk by the alley while on the phone, you'd be sure to miss it.  But once you pass the uninviting pseudo wall blockers, you'd find yourself whisked away into a seemingly another city.  The French speaking Asian lady-owner quickly hosts you to an assortment of tables both inside and out.  We sat outside, heat lamps on.  The atmosphere appears to be frequented by Financial District business people that know the best kept French secret in town.  However, we did sit next to a table of French gangsters with their import cigarettes (they got up and smoked elsewhere like gentlemen),  white pants, no socks, and skinny shirts with the collar wide open.  That actually was a plus to the whole experience.  Just to hear a table of people laughing and speaking French.\n\nOnce inside, the place opens up to 10 or so tables.  A live jazz band is squished into the corner.  A tad loud, but the music selection was smooth and nonabrasive.  An 8 stool bar and a hellava wine list helps to ease the wait.  And on a Saturday night with 8:30PM reservations, I would say it was at full capacity, with patrons still waiting for a table.  The place is quaint but the vaulted ceiling made it feel just right.  Warm low set lights and candles kept the joint hazy and optimal for sharing that nice red.  They boast quite a wine list, but unfortunately, its not online.  The decor is a mix of strategically placed frames and photos - trendy, but not so much where it gets too mind boggling.   Good masculine and feminine balance.\n\nAll servers were French and spoke with a thick French accent - very nice touch.  The service was professional, a bit dry but fair, not too much on the entree suggestion pitch, but overall way above par.\n\nBrochette - $12 black tiger prawn salad with mango, etc.  Yum.  Tasty scrimps.\nTartare de Thon Rouge - $12 raw ahi tuna, goat cheese, quail egg.  tuna was fresh and firm, goat cheese was almost Philadelphia Cream Cheese-ish.  Not a fan of the cream cheese.\nCoq Au Vin  $17 - chicken with red wine sauce, bacon, mushrooms and pearl onions.  very tasty and dense.  chicken was off the bone tender.  sauce was a mild reduction with a very herbal scent.  good stuff.\nAgneau $23 - roasted lamb sirloin - these deli pre-sliced lamb slivers had a lot of taste.  however, the medium rare ordered came out a tad too raw.  The intramuscular fat (marbling) was undercooked giving it a little chewiness and yes, you guessed it, a need for dental floss.  But the sauce was mildly tart and delicious.\nPommes Frites $5 - Must have frites.  Perfect seasoned and fried.\nTarte Tatin  $7 - the upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  eh, actually was disappointed with the inverted apple pie from 7/11.  the apples were overdone and soggy, it looked real dark, and the taste was can-like.   Pass.\n\nOverall, the experience est bonne.  You still get that city-feel with the sounds of blaring of taxicab horns without all the visuals.  You really do feel transported to a private French cafe.  There are no other restaurants in that alley, so it has that exclusive feel.  Our server let us dine for hours, without interruption or hint-dropping.  Definitely a great place to intimately share a great meal, tap a bottle of wine, and ultimately create long lasting memories.", "author": "Isaac L."}

We showed up around 5:20 and were told they didn't open until 5:30 So we took a walk around the block and found our way back down the dark little alley that the restaurant sits in about 5:35 The dining room (which isn't very large) was half full. We were able to get a table with the assumption that we would be done by 7:00 (i guess someone had the table reserved at 7:15)\n\nAnyway on to dinner: \nWe split a large steak tartare ($16) as an appetizer. It was about the right size for 2-3 people and the table side preparation was fun and it was nice to know exactly what flavors to expect along with the beef.\n\nI had one of the specials of the night, 3 lamb chops in a garlic wine sauce ($24). It was flavorful and moist and cooked to order, but failed in comparison to the pork my girlfriend had ($20). It was served with baked apple slices and green beans and was covered in a white balsamic, honey sauce that my mouth couldn't really pin down. It wasn't really like anything I'd ever had. The sweetness of the balsamic and honey melted together with what tasted like browned butter into something magical\n\nFood and service were worthy of 5 stars, but the music in the dining room was a little louder than I would have expected for a french restaurant which made conversation a little difficult so I marked it down a star", "author": "Bill H."}

Service was great, food was delicious. We shared the escargot - how couldn't you enjoy this doused in garlic and butter topped with a puff pastry! He then had the soup of the day, cream of cauliflower and I had the salad with toast and goat cheese which both were extremely satisfying. For our main course, he had the \"coq au vin\" - a chicken stew marinated for 5 hours and he devoured it. I had the \"thon\" which didn't come with what it said on the menu but was tasty. Would have liked it cooked a little more rare, it was a tad on the dry side, but no complaints overall! As we were incredibly stuffed, we though we had to try dessert and we got a flour less chocolate cake which was probably the richest desserts I've ever had, and so worth it!

The trout was swimming in butter, which as it turns out, isn't always a good thing, especially not when the vegetables are also bathed in the stuff, and the coq au vin was on the salty side.

First Cafe de la Presse changes, now Cafe Claude (and Cafe Bastille for that matter) has gone downhill.  Haven't been there for lunch, but dinner on Sat night was pretty boring.

Small and cozy, this French bistro oozes with old world class. Some might feel a little claustrophobic because the tables are so close, but I for enjoy looking at what my neighbors are having and chit chatting about our delicious dishes. When the weather gets warmer, I'll definitely be back to dine in their outdoor patio. \n\nOur server was adorable, attentive, and oh-so-helpful! He helped my date dissect the menu while I ordered using my rusty 4 years of high school French. He humored me quite a bit. We started off with a trio of pate--peppercorn (tastes like the pate in Vietnamese sandwiches), truffle mousse (fabulous, a must have), and confit-style (tasted rancid, avoid at all costs!). For our entrees he had the lamb smothered in a red wine reduction while I order the coquilles saint jacques. The lamb was delicious, but nothing special. The coquilles on the other hand was like nothing I've ever had; like a seafood pot pie, the scallops, shrimp and mussels were delicately cooked in a creamy gruyere sauce, placed in 2 giant seashells, and then topped off with a crispy breaded top. Heaven. Differing from the norm, we topped off the night with the chocolate mousse (the creme topping tasted like creme brulee!!). \n\nThank you Cafe Claude, I'll be back!", "author": "Linda T."}

Ancient cigarette butts wedged between softly worn cobblestones. Casually dressed post-work drinkers leaned against the brick, conversing vehemently with their hands. A woman dwarfed in a navy trench speeds around the corridor, her wedge heels announcing her departure. I paused at a London style pub before entering Caf\u00e9 Claude. The restaurant spilled onto the street with delicate tables and a generous billowed awning. The indoor dining area bathed in candlelight. The air thick with wine, butter and cream. Well coiffed bar patrons made room for us as we followed the zigzagging hostess to our table. The rest was a flurry of deliberation, exploration, and endorphic satisfaction.  \n\nWe started with a few modest glasses of '07 Cartlidge & Brown pinot noir, bread and butter, and a salad of red beets, snow peas, feta and pistou. For our entrees: a traditional vegetarian lasagne laden with roasted eggplant, zucchini, spinach, tomato, b\u00e9chamel, herbes de provence; and steak tartare with cornichons, capers, egg yolk, mustard, parsley, croutons, and shallots. To our surprise, the tartare was crafted at our table. Our server cracked the quail egg and mixed the herbs and raw meat with dramatic flair and severe wrist movements, the grand finale was a pinch of pepper and garnish. The whole experience was fantastic and incredibly suspenseful because it seemed like he'd never be done (sort of like Rowan Atkinson's shop character when he created the never-ending package for Bill Nighy's extramarital necklace in \"Love Actually\".) The dish was well worth the anticipation, especially when followed by their upside-down apple tart with caramel sauce and whipped cream.

We kinda did that with Cafe Claude, cept for one of us had been there quite a bit before- and it was in an alley way in downtown San Fran, and well we are already in that city quite a bit, and well its not at all the same thing, except for the plane ride...  Either way... Cafe Claude delivered!  \nThe steak tartare is why we go back, and almost always what is ordered- unless a tempting grilled steak special is happening that night.  The menu is small but each item receives the fine details required.  Never has the food not impressed- and its as reliable as a bay fog.  \nThe atmosphere is the expected shi-shi decor of a French cafe in downtown Fran, but i actually prefer to eat in the alley way instead of inside the restaurant- its sort of adds a little to the whole \"authentic experience.\"  \nThe servers are all french models, or models with faux french accents, but do a great job of pairing wine selections with meal choices.  They are attentive and understand how to make experiences memorable.  \n\nOne tip: Reservations are not always a requirement.  We have stopped in at an average dinner time and managed to get a table for two more than once.   So if you are in the area and jonesing for some french food served by french models and paired with california wine- just ask for Claude.  Well actually just ask for a table.

I mean it was OK... we were in no rush.. we sipped on wine and enjoyed our pate.... but cmon... it was weird that people who came in after us got their food so quickly and we had to wait so long...

Here's what I do remember though....\r\n\r\nSitting at the bar at lunchtime, the light doing weird things to the shadows in the weirdly shaddowed alley outside. The constant feeling that out of the corner of my eye I should be seeing an indoor palm tree and Humphrey Bogart sitting at the other end of the bar in a white tuxedo. The pleasant and chatty bartender, who was, mystifyingly, French. I remember the service being very good, the steak tar tare even better. If that's what I ordered I'd remember that for sure, but it wasn't. I remember the calming effect of the patio and a rare April San Francisco day with sun and not rain, and some charming company. \r\n\r\nFor these reasons I think you should go (sunlight and company not included, some assembly required). I'm sure the food is good, but I was a bit too filled with caffeine and adrenalin to remember.", "author": "Graham D."}

That was a bad idea. It was near impossible to get in here and my fiancee was very annoyed (not at them but at me). They really pushed people around for us and they were able to squeeze us in on the patio out front. Ted almost left because he has this weird aversion to eating outdoors at a restaurant but I convinced him that it is worth it. And boy was it! I ordered the tuna again because I still have dreams about it and I couldn't miss out and Ted ordered the filet. He was cautious but it turned out to be outstanding. Again with the sauce business. The sauce on Ted's steak was so yummy I wanted to take a bath in it. I don't know what they are doing back there in the kitchen with their sauces but I. Am. Loving. It!

The room we were seated in was small and very loud, the combo playing in the bar area made it very difficult to carry on a conversation. One waiter was serving the entire room so service was a bit erratic.  We started with a carafe of the Sancerre which was light and refreshing.  We split two salads between three people, the chevre and the maison.  The chevre was fine, but the maison was much better, delicately coated with a light mustard vinaigrette which didn't overwhelm the butter lettuce. For entrees we had the poulet roti (generous portion, but slightly overcooked), the saumon, (which was good), and the cod (the best of the three entrees, the vadouvan spice really enhanced the dish). We went with the waiter's recommendation of the Sancerre rouge to accompany the entrees.  (An uncommon pinot noir from the Loire region).  It was a disappointment at $68, a bit thin, short finish).  For afters we had the tarte tatin and a chocolate cake.  the tatin was a small round of curled up apples on a circle of crust, nothing memorable, the chocolate mousse-like cake was much better.

On most weekends, they have a jazz band playing.  Depending on where you sit, you're probably not sitting right by the band though, so it's not going to be super loud.  It's cozy - read, tight.  So you may find yourself staring at the food on the next table while you await your order.  Nevertheless, this place transports me to a warm cozy cool French bistro in Paris.  MINUS the cigarette smoke and snobbish Frenchies.  WONDERFUL.  :-)\n\nFor starters, we had the coquille st jacques and the escargots - great, smothered in butter garlic pesto sauce with puff pastry.  We mainly had the Steak Au Poivre for our entree, a classic French bistro dish.  In fact, that's how you judge if a bistro is good, by the steak au poivre (or steak frites).

My first ever croque monsieur was consummed here.  I liked that sandwich so much that my co-worker and I used the word \"croquer\" to mean \"Let's go to Cafe Claude for lunch.\"  Fast forward ten years to my most recent experience there.  We arrived a little after 1pm, and the hostess told us that it would be about a fifteen minute wait.  The place was still full, but the lunch hour rush was dying down.  Most diners were finishing up and getting their checks.  We sat down after about ten minutes, with the expectation that we could order and be out of there in another thirty.  Big mistake.\nOur waiter didn't come by after we sat down.  He served the tables around us, but he pretty much forgot about us.  Nothing irks me more than to see patrons seated after me having their orders taken before me.  This is exactly what happened that afternoon.  My dining companions and I pretty much knew what we wanted, so we gave the universal symbol that we were ready to order (menus down on the table).  That didn't work.  I had to have the hostess chase the man down.  Lunch ended up taking an hour and fifteen minutes for several other reasons I'm not going to get into at this time.  I should have known better.

The food here doesn't venture far from traditional French (our selections included onion soup, coq au vin, and foie gras), but it is French done well.  The crowd might be a bit uppity, and a filling meal will run you about $40 without wine, so Cafe Claude is probably best reserved for a date, formal dinner, or special occasion.", "author": "MScott S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-05-13", "description": "Tucked away in a little alley off of Union Square, this French Bistro serves some wonderfully classic cuisine. Live music on Friday and Saturday, so if a high decibel disturbs your digestion, go another night. Our server rattled off the specials with such a thick French accent, we had to ask him to repeat when he returned. If you have never tried Steak Tartare, this is the place to order it. They bring the ingredients and mix it at your table. The cornichons make all the flavors pop. The Coquilles St. Jacques were a little disappointing, in that there didn't seem to be any distinct flavors that stood out. Red beets, feta cheese, and snow peas are creatively presented in the Betterave. Gratin Dauphinous was a rich combination of potatoes, cream and Parmesan. Creme Brulee and Americanos were the perfect finish to a relaxing 3 hr. meal. This is a place I will add to my favorites.", "author": "Arlene C."}

Upon reading my negative review, the CC manager contacted me and invited me back to give Cafe Claude another chance.  I decided to make a lunch party/meeting out of it with my manager and co-worker, and the meal proved to be a mid-week afternoon delight for us all.\n\nThe service was fantastic, not just for our table, but for all of the tables that I observed outside.  The manager in addition to the wait staff made constant rounds to make sure that \"finished\" plates were removed and that beverage glasses were full.  We started our meals with a classic caeser salad, which proved to be a cut above the rest of the caeser salads that I've had with the cubed tomato.  My friend decided to try the cream of carrot soup,  which I thought was too pretty to eat.  Since I've always been partial to chicken (long running joke with my parents), I selected the Poulet Roti for my entree, and it was served with some of the freshest herbs that I've ever tried in a restaraunt meal.  The fresh rosemary inspired me so much so that I plan on adding it to some of my own cooking.  My mates chose the salmon, which looked equally appealing.  As compliments to the chef, there were no traces of the meal left on any of our plates.\n\nTo cap off the meal, I had a cappucino and twisted everyone's arm to try the creme brulee, which turned out to be my boss's favorite dessert.  She also proclaimed it the best she has ever had.  All the way around, it was a very enjoyable meal and I plan on returning regularly for lunch/dinner.\n\nAdditionally, I was very moved by the manager's course of action.  She truly cares about the place that she works at, and takes personal satisfaction in knowing that each and every diner walks away as a happy customer.  I don't like posting negative reviews, and I know that I wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of them. However, I sincerely appreciate the outstanding customer service that I received from  Cafe Claude.\n\n\nOriginal review\n\n\"I've dined here one another time back in January, and I don't remember being overly impressed then and I definitely wasn't  impressed on my last visit.  My most recent visit was to celebrate the booking of my upcoming visit to Paris (yay!) and hopefully this dismal lunch wasn't an omen of things to come.  I ordered a croque monsieur with side salad.  The sandwich was soggy and incredibly greasy.  Also, affecting the sog factor was they put a fistful of soggy probably day old frites in the takaway box.  If my feet weren't hurting from the stupid shoes that I was wearing, I would have marched right back over to take the food back.  I think the other French places in the neighborhood are better.\"", "author": "Amy Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-07-31", "description": "My already-overdue first review of what is actually and very possibly my favorite eatery in San Francisco was originally only two lines long (though very enthusiastic!)... and that is wholly unacceptable. So I'm updating it now, a year later, to give you the full scoop on why Cafe Claude is so dear to me. \n\nFirst of all, I love their Soupe a l'Oignon, Steak Tartare, Coquilles Saint Jacques, and Escargots en Croute. (Last time the soup was a little disappointing, but I'm willing to overlook that since it was a busy night and life happens.) I'm a creature of habit when it comes to my favorite things, so I don't typically stray from those options... But I've tried others' dishes and I can honestly say that pretty much anything you get here excels in both quality and quantity, so you're bound to find something to suit your needs or preferences. Most importantly, it's consistently fulfilling... as French cuisine, fortunately, tends to be.\n\nThe ambiance really does it for me though... As a Barcelonian, I often miss that quintessentially European atmosphere and they've really managed to capture that essence at Cafe Claude, from the decor to the lighting, so that's a lovely touch. Jazz evenings are delightful, unless you're trying to have an intense conversation, so that's something to keep in mind, but I personally enjoy it every time. The customer service is reliably good, ranging from polite to warm, depending on the person, but I've never had any complaints. While I've experienced and sincerely enjoyed eating outside on their alleyway tables, I love the atmosphere inside and typically prefer to stay in the warmth of their dining rooms... but both are excellent options, weather permitting. Ultimately, Cafe Claude works for every occasion, but is always uniquely charming, which is quite the accomplishment and, in my books, completely deserving of 5 stars... so with all my heart and stomach: merci, Cafe Claude!", "author": "G.

The location is simply perfect - tucked away in a little alley, you feel as if entering someone's charming secret hideaway.  I can't imagine many people stumble in by accident!  The restaurant is fairly small with modern decor, low-lighting, and lots of red.  I fell in love immediately!  The menu is fairly small, but boasts some mouth-watering options...whereas the wine list is quite extensive.  We were very pleased with our inexpensive bottle of red.  For nibbling, we shared a charcuterie plate with some excellent duck and pork pate, and for the main course, I indulged in some fusilli with roasted chicken and veggies.  Soooooo delicious!  I had an incredible and somehow fairly light coconut flan for dessert paired with a refreshing Bastille Bellini.\n\nOverall, the experience was completely delightful - a perfect spot for a love affair with food!\n\nTwo major pluses - the prices are *very* reasonable and the French waiters are *very* adorable!!!\n\nI wish we had such afforable French dining in Boston, but I will just have to visit San Francisco when I crave la cuisine francaise!", "author": "Victoria W."}

I don't know if that's what they do in France or whatever, but it kinds of makes me wanna sleep. Luckily i was hungry, and i kept eating the bread so i wouldn't doze off. The waiter was nice and he kept helping me pour water everytime i'm at half glass. It's like they have some sorta alarm in the back where someone's water get half full and they beep the waiter, and he comes running. Like i said earlier, i've never had French food so i have no idea how it would taste like. Everything was new to me and it was good and it was satisfying. I don't know why, i but i couldn't stop eating the bread. It was either i was just hungry and just ate whatever but damn, that's like the most bread i've ever eatened. Plus, i like to dip stuff so those little cut up breads worked perfectly. I probably wouldn't go back on a regular basis, it's the kind of restaurant you try once and move on. I'll probably go there if it's like a special occasion or just some random nights where you're like \"hmm............how bout them french fries\" and then you're like \"wait.....................french fries aren't french\".\n\nyeah....................o_O.......................randomness.\n\no yea, the welcomer chick (i don't know what you call them, welcoming person?) is pretty.

Still perfer fish but for meat lovers the lamb has a nice texture.  The ahi tuna had a unique taste.  Try it and you'll understand what I mean.  \n\nTables are very close to each other.  I recommend making a reservation before you come.  I think the hostess needs a little more training in customer service.  She seemed overwhelmed but how can you be overwhelmed on a Tuesday night?

The sausages were served with lentils and small onions (I think they were martini onions... I don't know the exact name) and roasted peppers.

We sat outside because it was a uniquely sunny day, and we couldn't let that pass unacknowledged. The interior is quite nice, though--very warm and romantical or whatever.\n\nI was pretty into the food, frankly. And I do love French food. And I do so love goood French food. I had the salade nicoise, which was a little Americanized, but in a good way. The dressing was a kind of vinnaigrette rather than a traditional mayo based one, which I liked a lot better, and the tuna was seared rather than cooked through, which I liked a lot lot better than traditional nicoise faire. I spent a month in Nice once, and I ate a lot of shitty nicoise salads--Cafe Claude's version is my favorite thus far.\n\nMy friend had the Croque-Madame, which is a gruyere and ham sandwich with a fried egg on top (oh i missss Croques!), and it looked pretty damn good. She claimed that its appearance matched its taste.\n\nFor dessert we shared the moelleux, a dense and flourless chocolate cake. Man, whenever there is flourless cake on the menu, I always feel obligated to get it just because it's cake(!) and I never get to eat cake (CAKE!). It doesn't always pay off though, although this cake was spot-on. The cafe noisette (espresso with a tiny bit of creme was done sort of weirdly though--they just put like a half a teaspoon of foam on top instead of adding creme. The espresso was good though.\n\nOnly bad thing was that the outside seating is sooo close together that you really have no choice but to spend your time either purposefully ignoring or begrudgingly listening in to your neighbors. \n\nPrice wasn't great, but wasn't awful either.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-10-05", "description": "For some reason, I thought this place was off of Kearny.  I was really close...it's actually in a little alleyway off Bush nr Kearny.  I walked up and did a onceover of the place.  The front definitely looked like a cafe straight from France.  The interior however, was a little more modern with just the right amount of color tones spread out about the space.  One of the hostesses quickly welcomed me in and was ready to seat me, but I told her I was waiting for a friend.  When my friend arrived, we decided to sit outside under the awning, which nicely protected us from any stray raindrops.  My friend had the same comment about how the place reminded her so much of a Parisian cafe.  Having never been to France, I agreed and took her word for it.  We sat and chatted for a while, sipping on Bastille Bellinis.    Our waiter came by several times to see if we were ready to order.  We couldn't decide right away.  I'd never been to a French restaurant before and I knew ordering french fries from anywhere else, does not qualify (BTW, they actually serve French Fries and French Beans here).  I didn't know what to really expect.  The menu is actually fairly diverse for being French.  I take it that there's a South-eastern France/Italy influence which would explain why pasta is on the menu and one of the specials of the day.  We ended up settling on THE ravioli dish for my friend, and the Coq Au Vin for myself.  I say THE ravioli to prepare potential diners for the single approximate sized 4\"x4\" ravioli that they serve you.  I didn't try it, but my friend was a little disappointed that it was only one piece.  I chose the Coq Au Vin (pronounced Co-Ka-Van, which I remembered from a 3's Company episode...and confirmed when my waiter repeated it back to me...I've never taken French mind you) because the chicken sounded like it would be prepared nicely.  I was greeted with 2 pieces of chicken...a leg and thigh (my favorite pieces)...covered in a wine sauce with mushrooms and something else that I forget.  Excellent dish.  Chicken was moist, and I made use of the sauce with the dinner bread provided.  I didn't realize that sides had to be ordered separately, but it was ok.  It was just the right amount of food for me (actually, I wouldn't have minded seconds).  We passed on dessert this time, but I'm sure there will be a chance to sample it another time.    I would definitely go back to sample more off the menu...along with a few more Bellinis too.", "author": "JeFF T."}

This last visit was Ladies' Night (The Heartlettes) and when we showed up they didn't have a table ready for us.  With a little complaining they made up for the inconvenience with a free glass of champagne.  We were only seated about 15 minutes late and from that moment on, it was bliss.  French food can be quite expensive (especially in San Francisco)...this is great French food at a good price.  Nothing too over the top.  The waiter was very knowledgable about the cheese, wine pairings and the food in general.  He was very warm and attentive and made the experience wonderful.  The ambience is slightly noisy, but very cute.  You feel tucked away in a little alley in France...left to enjoy your meal leisurely.  Food is meant to savor, so I enjoy when you have moments to break (or drink) between dishes.  I fully recommend this restaurant (just not for large groups b/c of the noise).

I went in for a salad, had their general dinner salad - it was relatively simple concoction of butter lettuce, onion shavings, and tomatoes, with a really tasty and unique dressing involving raw mustard. It was so good I decided to try the pasta. Meatballs were excellent, plentiful, and big. Perfect combination of pasta, meatballs, tomatoes, olives and cheese. Again, it wasn't complex but they cooked it perfectly. Having such good luck so far, I decided why not stuff myself completely by going for dessert as well. I tried the flourless chocolate cake, Amazing! Ate the whole thing even though i was already totally stuffed. And all in all, the place is not cheap by any means, but compared to other places I've been in the area it wasn't too bad on the high end. Also, the staff were really friendly, funny, and charming.

We had an early lunch and there was no problem getting a table; when we left, around 1:00 pm, I could see that those behind us may not have been so lucky without a reservation.  The lunch menu looks good and prices are about what I've come to expect, which is to say priced so that commoners like me who are paying for their own can have something to eat but probably can't have wine or dessert without thinking 'what have I done to my food budget for the week!'   I had the pasta of the day, which was chunks of pork loin and vegetables in a glace that was a little oversalted, over fusilli.  My partner had the salmon sandwich.  We both had an espresso to top it off.  Nice lunch?  Sure, and I may go back for cocktails to see how that works.  Is it special? Is it a hangout?  no.", "author": "Laura H."}

We asked for a table outside, and so we wedged ourselves in between two other couples. On the way I managed to almost spill everyones water at all three tables. How was I to know they used TV trays as patio furniture. Having never dined at a true French bistro, I didn't realize that it meant literally rubbing elbows with the person next to you. After finally settling in we ordered a couple glasses of wine and a beet salad for an appetizer. In my opinion, that was the best single dish I ate in San Francisco, and is probably one of the best dishes I have ever tasted. The combination of the beets, feta, pistou, and snow peas tasted like spring. (I know beets are a fall vegetable, but so what). Amazing flavors. I ordered the roast chicken with olives and lemon and my wife ordered the Crouque Madame. Mine was cooked very well, the flavors blended beautifully. my wife was not quite as enthusiastic about hers, but the accompanying pomme frites were very good.

Started with the cheese plate and the seafood raviole.  Both were rock solid and the cheese really accentuated the wine and I LOVE it when that happens.  The pomme frites were killer with a spicy aioli.  Lastly, we got the beef carpacchio.  This was THE dish to get to top them all.  They bring out a tray of ingredients including, dijon mustard, capers, fresh ground pepper, a quail egg, some chopped greens onions and a mound of finely chopped raw beef.
