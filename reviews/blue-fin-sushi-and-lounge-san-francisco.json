I ordered their Omakase $40. The menu says to order 15 minutes in advance and boy was I blown away by it! First of all the price is incredibly reasonable and the presentation is BEAUTIFUL! The  Omakase came with:\n- uni w/ quail egg on top of a fried shiso topped w/ Ikura \n- amaebi\n- walu\n- Ikura \n- hamachi\n- king salmon\n - hamachi toro\n- kurodai (Japanese black bass)\n- ankimo \n- Maguro and salmon sashimi\n\nThey also now have dollar oysters all night! They're super fresh and not cheap frozen oysters like other places that sell dollar oysters and there's a different  happy hour each weekday! Definitely going to be coming back again!", "author": "Ting Fei L."}

It's my neighborhood go to bar. \n\nThe ebi was nothing short of delicious, topped with black caviar and fresh to the gods.

You're also not allowed to choose from the happy hour menu when using a groupon. \n\nWhat we ordered: \n* Walu sashimi - pretty good (4 pieces for $9)\n* Spicy crunch maki - loved this!!! Must get here! I'm not a huge sashimi fan, but the sauce and deep fried texture really mixed well with the hamachi, sake, tai, shrimp, and onion. Also, the presentation of the dish was great. ($11.95)\n* Volcano roll - normally called Lion King at other places. It's the baked California roll with salmon on top drizzled with house mayo sauce. Good and decently sized. ($11.95)\n* Gold Mine roll - California roll with raw salmon, mayo, and roe on top. Pretty basic and not worth $13.50 \n\nService was good, and the portions were fair. I also love how this restaurant is connected to a bar! I'd probably be back to try the happy hour dishes and check out the bar.", "author": "Miranda T."}

There was no wait on a Wednesday night at around 8:30pm. We ordered a Omakase which had to wait 15 mins for the chefs to make it. The Omakase looked beautiful. It has 6 pieces of nigiri and 6 pieces of sashimi, serving with 2 pieces of Ankimo and fresh wasabi. The uni on the plate was something we ordered separately but the chefs put it with the plate. For me, the Uni and the fresh wasabi were the best from the plate. Everything else on the Omakase plate looked pretty but missing that touch of freshness and sweetness. We also ordered Amaebi nigiri which were quite small, good thing about it was that they gave us options for the shrimp head, either fried or with soup. Some other nigiris that we ordered were Hotate and Unagi, same thing with the plate, pretty and reasonable size but missing the freshness and sweetness. Overall I won't give it a 5 star because a Japanese restaurant should always provide FRESH fish but other than that, it is all good.", "author": "Eugenia K."}

All of the fishes we had were very fresh (unagi, salmon, tuna, yellowtail). Of the house special rolls, I would recommend the salmon roll (baked salmon) at a decent price point.\n\nCustomer Service: Attentive waiter/host who check up on us on multiple occasions and had a very positive attitude. He might've been the owner, I'm not quite sure, but I noticed that he treated his coworkers/staff very well.\n\nAmbience/Atmosphere: Sushi is served in both the restaurant and the bar/lounge.

The Rock n Roll was okay and dry (better with soy sauce), but the romeo and juliet was very bland. I enjoyed the fish but it wasn't fresh enough for a sweet taste on their own. It was probably over a day or two old, repeatedly refrigerated. I mean that's okay but I remember wishing for Ponzu sauce instead of soy sauce because it just tasted really wrong with soy sauce, and bland without it.

After all, there aren't many restaurants in the Outer Richmond that can feature a restaurant and bar/lounge joined at the hip.  Man, if only the food could have be more exciting!\n\nOffering a mix/fusion of Asian dishes, Blue Fin's menu is almost as unique as the restaurant itself.  Sushi, appetizers, noodles, salads, entrees, cocktails and more certainly wins them points for variety.\n\n- B52 ROLL - Spicy Hamachi, Shiso Leaf, Cucumber, and Tobiko...$8.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-fin-sushi-san-francisco?select=tt1JWNwETdIA55C_MsJlrA#ubBHo_SxCD_G3-1BWsgElQ)\nPretty \"meh\".  I liked the shiso leaf, but the heat from the fish was diffused by the cucumber.  Not awful, but it didn't do much for me either.  I don't think I'd get it again.\n\n- ROMEO & JULIET ROLL - Salmon and Avocado wrapped with Soybean Paper, topped with Scallop, Tobiko, and Spicy Mayo...$10.95\n(see above)\nThe three of us agreed this was the best roll of the night.  The roll wasn't heavy on rice or mayo, and the salmon and scallops seemed decently fresh.  Certainly worth trying.\n\n- CATERPILLAR ROLL - Eel and Cucumber topped with Avocado, ...$9.50\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-fin-sushi-san-francisco?select=tt1JWNwETdIA55C_MsJlrA#DbCHaAeKxxfQhtXj8Oh8og)\nThe taste was pretty standard, but it's not a bad choice.  Although it's comparable to any other decent sushi joint, both the portion and price were quite friendly.\n\n- TAKOYAKI...$6.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-fin-sushi-san-francisco?select=tt1JWNwETdIA55C_MsJlrA#vt-DSQnE9Mfl1A2wsVossA)\nI love takoyaki, but this one underwhelmed like almost everything else we tried.  Even though the pieces were sizable, they were light on octopus given their size.  The bonito flakes were nice though. \n\n- KIMCHI FRIED RICE...$10.95\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/blue-fin-sushi-san-francisco?select=tt1JWNwETdIA55C_MsJlrA#nIROaT9KrIinNZyxvEY9HQ)\nI didn't expect much and that's what I got.  It was apparent just from the looks of it that there wasn't much kimchi flavor.  Given how it tasted like a generic fried rice dish, I think we might have been better off with the unagi fried rice we were eyeing.\n\nTo be honest, it kind of bums me out to be giving Blue Fin only three stars.

It was sushi rice wrapped in raw salmon, topped with tobiko and a quail egg.  A few of my favorite things. :D  \n\nThe live scallops that they had on their specials menu and the Ice-land roll, I could have done without.  The walu that topped their iceland roll had a water-y, just thawed taste.  \n\nService was pretty good! All the waiters and waitresses were attentive, although they didn't seem to have a system, because 3 of them asked us if we wanted drinks, one right after the other. haha All the food came out super fast too!  Right after we placed our order, we saw the sushi chef making it.  And at the end of the meal, they gave me a rose in honor of Valentine's day.", "author": "Kay A."}

The sushi/sashimi was quite generously portioned for the price, and the quality, freshness, and taste were quite decent. The volcano roll, although on the smaller side, was quite rich and filling. Service was courteous and unobtrusive, and the place is fairly clean with a showcase aquarium highlighting a snazzy entryway.\n\nThere's a quieter sushi bar and restaurant on one half, and a livelier lounge on the other.

My mom had their seafood ceviche (I don't eat anything raw so I didn't try it) and said it was delicious and very fresh. \n\nReservations were easy - open table! We didn't even have to wait a second.

Who can pass that up?! So today, my bff and I finally had our sushi dinner here. Upon entering, silly me didn't realize there were two doors, one for the lounge and bar area and another for the restaurant part. Whoops. But the bartender was friendly and smiled while I pointed to the other side apologetically. We got seated next to the fish tank (nice view...but poor fishies had to watch us eat their friend...).\n\nUpon sitting down, we got served iced water and some pickled cabbage. We ordered the $50 sushi boat, which we came here to try, half a dozen oysters with uni and quail egg, stuffy mushrooms, and lady finger roll. We got the oysters first and the mushrooms and roll came shortly after. Then our final surprise...the sushi boat...IT'S HUGE!\n\n5/5 Oysters - I never tried uni before and surprisingly, it matches with the oyster so well. I loved it! Very fresh and sweet.\n4/5 Stuffy mushroom - It's stuffed with spicy kani. A teeny bit too spicy but yummy nevertheless.\n4/5 Lady Finger roll - I don't remember what's in it, but it's wrapped with soy paper. Crunchy, warm, and delicious.\n6/5 Sushi boat - Yea...it's so good, I have to go over the 5. The reason why we ordered the roll was because we didn't expect the boat to be so big. But when the waitress put it down, it actually is the length of the table! It contains four more regular oysters, a shrimp head, assorted sashimi, assorted nigiri, and california rolls. Sashimi was so fresh and sweet. My first piece was the hamachi sashimi and I almost had goosebumps when I put it in my mouth, almost.\n\nBy the end of our dinner, I was working overtime to finish the last of the food. It was super worth it. Super friendly servers that kept our tea and water filled at all times. Always smiling. So I had to tip them well! Definitely coming back for more!", "author": "Sandy F."}

Although I have never officially dined in the restaurant,  I have ordered a few sushi rolls and other dishes and really the menu is hit or miss. The ambiance is mellow and cozy in the bar. Even though  I go infrequently to the bar I will often see the same set of locals. \n\nDuring my infrequent visits over the last five years, I have only ordered a few snacks to accompany my beer or cocktails. The small dishes have been somewhat tasty, however usually err on the side of being overly salty and overly fried.\n\nRecently the bar management installed three electronic dartboards. Unfortunately these dartboards have taken up an inordinate amount of room and have forced patrons to crowd into one side of the bar dining room. It is an awkward arrangement to say the least.\n\nLocal bars in this area are few and in between and Bluefin is acceptable contender. I would not recommend it as a place to socialize with new people or meet a potential new friend/cuddle buddy. But if you have a hankering for a cocktail and live within a five block radius of bluefin, this bar will fit the bill nicely.", "author": "Carole B."}

So don't make the mistake I made by wearing heels to walk up and down the hills of the neighborhood. \n\nMy two cents: get the spicy girl and payroll! The spicy girl consists of a medley of white fish completely enclosed by sliced avocados. It was pretty much an avocado ball filled with fresh fish! I could have eaten a million spicy girls (no pun intended) because those balls of awesome goodness were to die for. The payroll is a simple roll of eel, avocado, and cucumbers but was pretty scrumptious. The kimchi fried rice was also pretty good but not as memorable as some of the sushi. The egg on top was a bit overcooked and not as delicate as it should have been.\n\nAlthough the sushi is pretty decent, the prices aren't.

Little did we know in a few stops the bus was jammed packed and I became a little nervous because I never been there and didn't want to get lost. We picked up a lot of Chinese people in Chinatown where we gave up our seats to the elderly.

In the other half, we were pleased to be seated next to an aquarium where I found Nemo. I was disappointed that they were out of the Live Aoyagi, Live Uni, Awabi, and Live Aji. The disappointment soon went away after we found out we arrived during happy hour. We started with $3 Anchor Steam, $4 well drinks, and $3 yakitori. Everything we ordered after that was amazing:\n\nIka Maruyaki ($10.95)- Grilled squid. although not the best I've ever had was still pretty good.\n\nKaki Special ($18.95)- The best oysters I've had on the trip!! Each oyster was bigger than what I got at Hog Island and was equipped with a slice of uni, ikura and a quail egg. I never imagined the textures and taste would go so well together. Amazing.\n\nKim Chee Fried Rice ($10.95)- I'm not a fan of Kim Chee so I never ordered this dish at other restaurants. This was my first time trying it and it was a success. I am now a fan because it is very very good. \n\nTakoyaki ($6.95)- Another item trying for the first time. These octopus filled balls were DELICIOUS!!\n\nA few more happy hour drinks and a few more skewers of yakitori completed my meal. Blue Fin Sushi had made my night and exceeded my expectations.

And to round it out, a solid deal.\n\nI almost never order hot items from a sushi restaurant (why?) but I had to try the miso scallops. They were perfect; not too done or underdone with sliced scallions and a healthy dose of tasty garlic. \n\nThen, I had a yummy 10-piece plate of sashimi and it was so good. The white toro with tiny bits of crisped garlic was to die for and the blue fin and hamachi, fresh and delicious. The slices of sashimi were generous and it was super-fresh. Heaven.\n\nI finished with (yet another, so unusual) hot appetizer of the \"mushroom stuffy\" (portabellini mushrooms stuffed with snow crab and what was on top? tabiko?.. it tasted and looked like caviar so perhaps).\n\nEverything was terrific. I couldn't find a single flaw.\n\nDining alone, I burned off the rest of my Yelp deal with an order of \"to-go\" beef shortribs and vegetables. The owners were fearful it wouldn't translate the next day but I had them prepare the beef \"very rare\" so I could pan-sear it without over-cooking it.\n\nEven if I myself ruin that dish, I'm sure it'll be a stand-out. \n\nYes, Blue Fin delivers.. but only up to Divisadero, no exceptions (sob). So if you live somewhere between Clement and 18th and Divis and whatever cross street, you're in luck. West of their location, I can't speak to that but give 'em a call to see.\n\nAnd I'm sure delivery will be great and dine-in... \n\nPERFECTION.\n\nThank you Yelp! for turning me on to a great new restaurant find.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-19", "description": "We always wanted to try this place.  Finally got the chance with the Living Social coupon.  From what I had heard about the sashimi and rolls from another friend who dined there earlier in the week, I was warned to skip the rolls and sushi.  \n\nLike huh? How can I do that when it's a sushi restaurant but, I heeded her warning.  Was told that the sushi was bland and not very fresh. \n\nReally sad considering I love sashimi and sushi.  Ok, I lied.  I did have a tuna/salmon tar tar appetizer.  Had to feed my salmon craving somehow.  The presentation of the tar tar was rather sloppy.  There was an attempt to make it look presentable but it missed its mark.   Just staring at it I was hoping and praying that I wasn't going to get sick after eating it.   It really didn't look appetizing.   It looked too slimy.  Looks aside, I  will say it was tasty though and I can happily report I didn't get food poisoning.\n\nWe ordered  2 entrees which I had an inkling was a huge mistake.  It was a semi-mistake. OK, a mini mistake.  Screw it - it was just a mistake.  We ordered beef sukiyaki and miso sea bass.  Our server informed us that they were out of sukiyaki.  Huh?   How can you be out of sukiyaki?  Strange.   Worried now.\n\n So we ordered beef teriyaki.  While the steak was ok, they were rather skimpy on the teriyaki sauce.   The menu described it as a steak basted with sauce.  They really should say  - it's a steak lightly drizzled with sauce.   Even after we asked for more sauce, it came in a tiny ramekin and the kicker was that it was cold.  Really?  Couldn't warm it up in the microwave for at least 30 seconds just to heat it up?  You would think that an entree that is costing $15 would get sauce that is at least warm.  \n\nOn a good note, the sea bass I have to admit was cooked perfectly and was quite flavorful and moist. \n\nThe overall presentation of all the entrees that we ordered can be summed up in one word- sloppy.  Seeing boiled carrots sliced haphazardly Flintstone style with broccoli as a garnish on each entree was a major turnoff.  At least cut the carrots like you care people.  Slicing the carrot on a bias might have saved my overall disappointment with the appearance of each dish placed before me.   Even our rice was sloppy looking.  Hard to do but they did it.  Rice was sticking off the edge of our bowls and not even mounded correctly.  It was really rather disappointing.   Blue Fin needs to understand that part of the thrill of going out to eat is to feast with the eyes.  Presentation and dare I say looks are everything.  \n\nOn the whole even though the sea bass was good,  it will not be enough for me to set foot in this place again.  My long time curiosity about this place has been cured for good.", "author": "Cris H."}

My boyfriend and I like to use Groupon or Living Social deals to try new places. I mean you can't really beat paying $15 for $30 worth of food for a place that you're not even sure you'll love, let alone like. But I'm going to reiterate, I should've learned my lesson three Living Social deals ago...\n\nWe came here last night for dinner excited for some good sushi. We had heard some good reviews and when we arrived, the place was busy. It took forever to find parking (but that isn't saying much when you're looking for parking in the Richmond District.) Another thing was, we made it just in time for happy hour! Cheap booze and good food? What a lovely combo. \n\nFor me, if all started with the menu. There was so much going on! It was difficult to read, not to mention difficult to turn the pages. Those things need to be wiped down with a CLEAN, UNUSED towel every night. The pages were black and the text was purple and blue. IMO, text should've been neon to make it easier for people to read.. .Strike 1!\n\nWe didn't order too much, just some pretty simple dishes. We wanted to start with the grilled whole squid as an appetizer so we ordered that as well as some Walu (butterfish/escolar and if you've never tried it, go find some because it's to die!), a 49er roll, Poky Salad, yakitori, and some hot sake and a cold sapporo (not on the happy hour menu.) Keep in mind that we wanted the squid first. \n\nAs we're waiting for our food, our lukewarm \"hot tea\" came out. It's called HOT tea! Serve it hot or serve it over ice, come on! ...Strike 2! \n\nWaiting...waiting...waiting... Walu, 49er roll, and poky salad all come out at about the same time. Yay! But wait, where's my squid? Anyway... We're eating, eating, eating when we realize... This food is warm? Raw fish is warm? What's going on? So the temperature of the food was an issue. The only things that came at the correct temperatures were the beer and sake. Actually, the sake was 10x hotter than the tea! ...Strike 3!\n\nMy boyfriend decided to add an unagi handroll. Yum! While we were waiting, the yakitori finally came out. Ok, this was when I wanted to walk out the door. Yakitori is chicken and you should ever eat chicken raw. IT WAS NOT COOKED ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!! A real chef would know not to serve raw poultry. Get a real chef in that damn kitchen or be ready to fight some really angry people when they find out that you're chicken is the reason why they've got salmonella poisoning! Disgusting.. .Strike 4!\n\nImmediately, we sent back the nasty yakitori. Our waitress was very nice about it, apologized, and brought us a bowl of wakame salad on the house. Sweet because I love wakame salad! ...It was room temperature. Unagi handroll came out. Looked pretty good, boyfriend was happy, we were both happy. Cool. So what's next? What are we missing...?\n\nSQUID! Finally. Came out with no explanation as to why it took so long. It tasted like it had been sitting, waiting to be served. At this point, I was sort of done with the place. Finished by sake and beer, got the check, and got the hell outta there. Waitress offered us some free dessert, but we just wanted out.\n\nYou're going to get mixed reviews about this place. People obviously like coming otherwise it wouldn't be so busy, but I'll never come here again. 1-star for the pretty fish I got to sit next to and 1-star for how nice out waitress was.

Miso soup is pretty hard to mess up, and the edamame may have been the tastiest dish we had that night, probably because we were so hungry. \n\nThe food was pretty pricey for the lack of flavor.", "author": "Le T."}

Throughout the meal, not once did our waiter come by and check in. Table next to us, judging from how they're just speaking Cantonese with them and constantly bringing out drinks and complimentary stuff, gets undivided attention. I mean, they're even there longer than I'd been there.\n\nAnd the food. I don't think it was terrible, but I wouldn't go back. To say the least, getting a stomach ache from mediocre food and horrible service isn't all that worth it to me. If you're in the Richmond, there's way better Japanese than this place.

You order, you get your food, they leave you alone, you eat. This is exactly what we experienced at Blue Fin and can't imagine it any other way. It ain't Hillstone or Blue Fog Diner, people. No one is going to come and kiss your butt and ask you how your sashimi tastes. The two servers that worked our table were perfectly friendly and efficient. We asked for our check, big deal, she saw we were having fun, good for her. She got her 20%.\n\nOn to the sushi: very good! Excellent menu, lots of creative rolls (Maui Roll, Hawaiian Roll and much more) and all the simple ones you can think up. Their walu sashimi was excellent. Their cocktail menu rocks, lots of creative options including a grape concoction that should I have been 22, I would have ordered it in a heartbeat.\n\nAmbiance: awesomeness! Who knew?

I made sure to ask so we were not billed differently since we were in the lounge before happy hour ended and the great waitress we had, checked and said it is off the total bill so we were able to enjoy a few happy hour prices with our yelp deal. We just showed them our email confirmation on our cell phone and they checked us out. This place seems to be the place to be in the area.

Yes they offer a lot of things, yes the menu is full (by the way looking at the menu hurt my eyes because of all the colors - where's the simplicity?), however they some how ran out of uni and fresh sea scallops. Are you kidding me? On a SATURDAY NIGHT, EARLY Saturday night. All we wanted that night was uni, sea scallops, oysters and hamachi kama. \n\nNeedless to say, we left $3 for the didn't-touch-tea, and the semi-eaten-edamame.", "author": "Vanessa K."}

We had a party of 18 on a friday night so we were seated in the private room they had in the back. The restaurant is pretty small so I would imagine large parties only being able to fit in the room in the back, so reserve ahead of time if you plan to have a large party. The room in the back is separated by curtain blinds so it's not completely closed off from the restaurant which is nice.The decor was very modern and gave us enough privacy so that our loudness wouldn't be disrupting to other diners. They did play top 40 music throughout the night as well and it gets louder later on in the night when more people start coming in for the bar/lounge feel. Our dining room was right by the bar too so you can have the option of ordering your drinks at the table or ordering at the bar separately.\n\nThe service was very prompt and the waitresses were really friendly and efficient. Our table was ready by our reservation time, they came in and took our orders shortly after everyone settled in, and the food came out fairly quickly with no mix ups. As far as the food, the food was just okay - nothing to write home about. Pricing is a little higher than standard Japanese restaurants but reasonable. But the place gets four stars because it's a great place to dine with a bunch of friends, has a good variety of drinks from beer, sake, and mixed drinks, and plays music.

Parking is pretty troublesome; restaurant decor is modern and the screaming happy hour deals are a sign that patrons aren't exactly rushing in over the quality of the food. All $200 was blown on food so I like to think I've tried a fair sample of what blue fin has to offer. \n\nThere were a few memorable dishes; Nama Kaki w/ quail egg and uni - pricy but not bad for 6 oysters on a half shell plus extras. The Seab(r)eam Tataki was also a pretty fair combination of flavors that I enjoyed. Finally the butterfish sashimi was something I've never tried and tasted fresh and clean. \n\nMost items however left a mediocre impression. All nigiri & sashimi (excluding the butterfish) looked (in the display at the sushi bar) and tasted a little old. Some were slightly grainy, some had a tough texture, and all simply did not have a fresh taste. Most disappointing was the uni: the quality was poor; the sacs were destroyed or simply purchased as low quality. The taste was slightly metallic-like and utterly disappointing. December is supposed to be the ideal month isn't it??\n\nThe takoyaki was average, not scalding hot as it should be, and scanty on the octopus; the miso scallops were overcooked; the poke salad was poorly balanced, the rolls were just a mush of flavor, etc. etc. you get the idea, the meal came off in the end as mediocre and slightly disappointing- that should earn a place 3 stars. 1 more star off because as I lie here writing this review, my stomach is churning and definitely not happy.

The key word there is reservation, meaning we called in advance and gave them a heads up about our group.  Why did our dinner take 3 hours from start to finish?  I wish I could say that it was 3 hours because we ate our food and proceeded to sake bomb the night away, but instead, we left sober with frowns on our faces from the frustration we felt at this f\"ing place.\n\nLet me break down the chain of events that went down here.  \n8:00pm - arrive for our reservation\n8:30pm - receive menus\n9:00pm - receive waters and waiter takes drink orders\n9:15pm - wrong amount of beers arrive\n9:30pm - orders are taken\n9:45pm - wine ordered at 9pm arrives\n10:00pm - food starts arriving sporadically\n10:30pm - food for the birthday boy finally arrives\n11:00pm - everyone is finished eating and waiting for bill\n11:30pm - idea to ditch bill surfaces due to impatience in waiting for bill, but bill finally arrives \n11:45pm - attempt by restaurant to save face by giving us 3 orders of fried banana ice cream fails as everyone is ready to just leave restaurant already\n\nAlso, while we were waiting around for random things to be served, like our food or drinks, we noticed all the servers just looking into our area like we were in some type of quarantined area for SARS.  At the end of the night, one of the servers buddies walked in and he decided that giving his friend a pound and hug and ask him what he was doing there and shoot the sh*t with him was much more important than getting us our bill.  Thanks for the excellent service Mr. Dragon BallZ.  Maybe he was in celebrity shock since his friend did come in with all Lakers gear on and his last name screen printed on the back of his jersey.  But the last time I checked, Jeremy Lin played for the warriors and wasn't a short, chubby asian guy.\n\nI'd never go back here again.

Parking definitely sucks around this area or we just had really bad luck when we came, spots were being snatched up right in front of us. \n\nThis place was surprisingly a lot smaller than I expected, especially from seeing the outside storefront. But half of it is a restaurant and the other half is a lounge. Not sure what the lounge offers other than drinks, or if you can also get food there? I didn't read the other yelp reviews that closely before going. \n\nMy husband and I came on a Friday night at 7:30pm, but we called ahead and made reservations figuring it would be PACKED on a friday night. I think we got lucky on that note because it wasn't packed or as busy as we thought it woudl be. It's a small place so it doesn't hold a lot of tables, but there were a few empty tables when we arrived. \n\nFirst off, they give you a bowl of complimentary edamame. A total plus because hardly any sushi places that I've been to ever gives complimentary edamame. Downside is that the edamame wasn't fully cooked, it was hard to pop the beans out of the pods. You should be able to bite into it and slide the bean out easily. This one you had to gnarl on it to get it out. But hey it's free! \n\nWe ordered the Chicken Kara-age because it looked different than the normal chicken bites, this one was on the end of a bone, like a chicken wing with the meat pulled down to form a lollipop. It was very yummy and crispy. Mhmm good. \n\nAnother appetizer we ordered was the Salmon and Tuna Tartare. It came with a side salad on the plate which was yummy to have some fresh greens with japanese food. The tartare wasn't as fabulous as I would've thought, it was still good but I could hardly taste the salmon in the tartare, the tuna was overpowering it. I would've loved just a salmon tartare by itself. Still good, it's just a personal preference. Also in typical-tartare fashion, it came with wonton chips to spoon the tartare on to eat. But oddly it also came with shrimp chips. \n\nA definite plus side that my husband and I totally appreciated was the price for sashimi. Usually sashimi for us is super duper expensive that we can't justify getting as an appetizer. Here at Blue Fin Sushi, this wasn't an issue. Super reasonable pricing. And the sashimi was fresh too. We ordered the Salmon sashimi and the Shiro Maguro (white tuna). Mhmmm both yummy. \n\nWe also ordered a few rolls - yes we were being heffers, but we had a $60 yelp deal to use up. The rolls were all awesome, we got the Romeo & Juliet, Ice Land Roll and the Volcano Roll. They were all soo soo good. The only slight downside is the Volcano Roll was stuck to the foil after baking it, so it was a chore to get it off the foil. They need to use spray-on oil before baking, it would help a lot. \n\nOverall, great place to eat, great service, great food, parking sucks! And prices about reasonable. \n\nAt the end of the meal, they give you an orange for palate cleansing and dessert. Also another point to note, great service! Anytime we had a plate that was empty of even chopstick wrapper, there was always someone to swoop by and pick it up. They were super diligent! Love great service! If only more restaurants were like this.", "author": "Grace L."}

Just so it gives a nice crunch which leads you into the goodness inside.\nChicken Kaarage is quite good, fried juicy goodness..becareful its hot and the juices spraying you lip wont feel good.\nRaw Oysters - simple freshness...add Tabasco and lemon please\nAmaebi and Hamachi - fresh deliciousness...\nSalmon tatare on a shrimp chip - eat it when it comes out otherwise the chip gets soggy..not that it wont taste good but shrimp chips taste better crunchy!\nFried Ika - tasty fried squidy goodness..\n\nIve had a couple rolls here too and they were quite good..cant remember the names but usually with rolls you cant really mess up unless there is like cream cheese or something...I really dont get why people like that in their sushi..\n\ncream cheese? come on....\n\nanyways, blue fin is a tasty place and Ive met wonderful people and made lots of fond memories here...", "author": "phillip w."}

Last time I was here, the mafia like sushi chefs and waiters were dining and wine'ing their friends who occupied a large table near the sushi bar.  I kid you not -  the sushi chefs kept bringing over sashimi and then down a shot of sake with the people at the table.\n\nMeanwhile, we had been waiting 30-minutes with no sign of any food.  Finally, I have to wave down a waiter and ask before their realized that our order had been neglected, even though our waitress passes our table a ga-zillion times in those long 30-min (but never checked in abour our order).  We didn't even get the sashimi salad all the dishes arrive, then the salad turned out to contain a bad piece of sashimi, which made me spit it out.

Featuring Hawaiian-style spicy white tuna over mixed greens, the Poky (sic) Salad packed plenty of heat.  The B52 Roll, with spicy hamachi, shiso leaf, cucumber, and tobiko, was also a winner.   The hamachi (yellowtail), tobiko (flying fish roe), unagi (barbecued sea eel), and shiro maguro (white tuna) were all super fresh and tasty.  Blue Fin even had live hotate (scallop), which was melt-in-your-mouth good.\n\nWith the associated bar, there were many American craft beers, but no Japanese beers, on tap.  The limited sake list could use some additions, but it did offer sufficient selections to complement the food.\n\nThe expert sushi chefs are knowledgeable and fun:  be sure to share a glass of sake with them.  The wait staff is top-notch:  friendly, attentive, and fast.  Prices are reasonable (for The City):  sushi for two with plenty of beer and sake came in just under $100.  As a nod to the poor economy, Blue Fin even features a special dollar menu on certain days:  for every $30 you spend,  you can get one item off the dollar menu for $1.\n\nWith a cool bar on one side and awesome sushi on the other, Blue Fin has it all.", "author": "CJ G."}

My friends got this sushi combination platter for $28.00, but it looked fresh. Maybe the sashimi is better at this place. I was disappointed that this place didn't have bentou boxes! \n\nThe waiters were very good at refilling tea and water though. The place played music you would typically hear at a bar or club, which was a little different. I guess they are trying to draw in the younger crowd.

As I was washing my hands, I watched him shake his whoopsie and walk out the bathroom without washing his hands, after catching eyes with me as I was washing my hands! Who does that, no less a Chef in front of a Customer?! We caught eyes, and still he was such a gross human being that he went, \"Oh well, I'm sure he doesn't mind me touching his raw fish with my penis hands.\" Absolutely gross. I went back to the table, told my Party immediately, and then told the Waitress that we would not be dining because of what I just saw. The Waitress looked more annoyed with us leaving then apologizing for such a terrible incident. As we walked out, the Waitress went to confront the Chef, who immediately through up his hands like it was no big deal, and that we were overreacting to someone not washing his hands after touching a potential petri dish of STDs, body waste, etc, and not want that on my raw, uncooked food. I will never eat here again. What's worse, the food here was great, until I found out what the special ingredient was. \n\n\nOriginal Review:\n\nSushi is really good here. The toro is pricey, but comes in large delicious portions that are well worth it. The only reason it is not a 5 star rating is that the service is slow. Not bad, just slow.

So good, I rarely eat sushi anywhere but at Blue Fin, and I've brought several other friends there for dinners who have left the restaurant with the same sentiments.\n\nThe service is fantastic. The staff are friendly and attentive not overbearing. As soon as you are seated they bring you a dish of edamame and a cup of tea. The menus are well designed, with pictures depicting in compete accuracy what you can expect when you order. \n\nThe food is...well, I'm practically salivating as I write this. Fresh, tasty, well presented. Did I mention fresh? The Miso Scallop appetizer is mouth watering and every bite is scrumptious. The Mushroom Stuffy is also worth a try.\n\nI try each time I go there to try a new roll but some of my personal house special favorites are:\n\n- Iceland Roll\n- Rainbow Roll\n- Hawaiian Roll\n\nThere are also the usual assortment of expected sushi rolls...California (with real crab), Alaska, Spicy Tuna, Philadelphia, Rock & Roll, etc. All of which are well made and tasty, though I prefer the House Specials simply because of their medley of flavors.\n\nPersonally I haven't tried any of the entrees but a friend of mine ordered the Salmon Teriyaki and raved about it as she was eating, so I assume their entrees are of equal exceptional quality.\n\nAs if the sushi isn't enough - and trust me I've gorged myself on one too many rolls in one setting - ya gotta leave room for dessert. The Lychee Sorbet is sure to delight your palate, but...my very favorite...the Fried Banana with a scoop of green tea ice cream. YUM!\n\nPrices are reasonable. Parking on Clement Street is difficult but rather than waste time looking for a spot, park in the parking lot on 18th between Geary & Clement and walk over.

She rarely strays from the usual california roll and spider roll! What the??!? So she pretty much knew nothing about the fish here. I judge a place by it's uni. The uni here was creamy but not very fresh. I had the Sea King which was a roll with avocado, some other stuff, and uni!!! I've never had a specialty maki roll with uni before.

It took a while for the waiters to get to us and we have to flag him down. When we got our plates for appetizer, there was one plate that has left over food in it. It makes me question how they clean their plates or if they reused it after serving it to people. \n\nThe appetizer that we ordered were garlic fries, buffalo wings, calamari, and crab cheese rangoon. And couple of well drinks. \n\nI must say their garlic fries was cooked in a high temperature where its crunchy on the outside (which burn my tongue) but gets soggy real quick after it cools down. I didn't really taste the garlic on the fries, and I am assuming that they use garlic powder salt because it was really salty and powdery. (not worth $4 dollars) \n\nCalamari is a big deal to me when drinking. And I must say the taste and the portion sized (1 measuring cup size amount)  they served was such a let down. I even question if it was even a squid that they serve because i don't taste the squid flavor at all. And the portion is very small (1 person can finish it and still be hungry)\n\nThe crab cheese rangoon is horrible. I'm like \"isn't there suppose to be crab meat  inside this wonton? I understand its happy hour, and atleast put imitation crab but theres just runny cream cheese inside it. And I don't think they use the right wonton wrapper for this one. \n\nAfter eating everything else, I didn't even bother eating the buffalo wings. For one thing its 4 pieces and its 4 dollars. that's like $1 dollar per wing... You're not really saving money here... \n\nI give 1 star on the happy hour drinks because they were okay and decent. It's kinda hard to screw up a drink. \n\nAfter the disappointment with the happy hour stuff, I was still willing to try their sushi atleast try to redeem themselves. I tried their Volcano roll, it was mediocre to the very least. Its passable for a sushi. but it was 9.50 per order and its 6 rolls. For that taste and serving size, i would say its only worth 6.50. \n\nI'm surprise that this place got 3.5 reviews... \nMy friends and I walk out of there and we all agreed that were never coming back to this place.

Although it was cool, it's not bite-sized but that's alright. We also got an order of raw oysters which seemed to be a pretty good deal. In addition, we tried their two-piece Kobe beef sushi but it wasn't really anything special. People always told me about how great Kobe beef was but this place made it alright; it was super pricey for two itty bitty slices of beef.

It was hard for her to read the menu so I had to read some of the items to her. We just ordered different stuff and shared. \n\nWe ordered: \n\n- Raw oysters with uni and quail eggs: everything tasted extremely fresh, and even though I don't really like uni, I didn't mind it since all I was focusing on was the oyster! \n\n- Miso glazed seabass: I usually love chilean seabass, but the way they cut this fish made it dry and when it broke apart in your mouth, it kind of felt like little pellets. The sauce was also very salty. \n\n- Romeo & Juliet roll: good but waaayyy to much rice. \n\n- Seaking roll: Ordered it with salmon instead of unagi because my mom doesn't eat unagi. Pretty tasty. \n\n- I had amaebi nigiri: the amaebi was a little mushy, but I like the fact that they give the fried heads with it and not charging for it. I hate when restaurants charge extra for the fried heads. \n\nWe also had one of their cold house sakes. Don't remember the name, but it was yummy! \n\nOverall, I don't think I would go back, I've had way better sushi for a cheaper price at other places.", "author": "Ashley C."}

It looked like it was so ashamed to be served that it wanted to crawl inside the shriveling nori and die.  Definately NOT worth the $5.95.\n\n$1 hand rolls!  I would have paid exactly one dollar for what I was served.  \n\nThe other tables ordered so many jive-ass rolls that their experience made up for our lack of an experience.

Asked the guy over the phone if they have Shiro Maguro Toro and he said YES and then told me my order will be ready in 30mins.

Came back in 15mins and my order was 'being packaged' and I had to wait another 10mins. Don't tell customers to pick up their order in 30mins when you can't have it ready in 30mins. Total wait time, 1HR. Then they tell me a customer eating there ordered the last Shiro Maguro Toro, excuse me? They just told me you have it and now they don't, so togo customers aren't customers? On to the sashimi, I have no idea how their \"chefs\" can even call themselves chefs, more like kids holding a knife cutting fish.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-11", "description": "It's interesting. I write this review after reading multiple reviews of how OVER attentive the staff was. Perhaps they've been reading yelp and decided to push their service in the other direction, though the way that they've chosen to do it is rather like a pilot realizing that he has flown too high and, in response, crashing his plane into the ground. \n\nWe chose blue Finn, it now appears given the 3.5 star rating, either because it was late (around 10:30), or because I allowed my girlfriend to choose the restaurant that evening. \n\nNow, blue finn is open until 12am on Saturday night so sayth their menu and website, yet as we entered the young waiter at the door looked at his phone and back up at us as if we were trying to slam a party of ten into the restaurant five minutes to close. Once again, we arrived at 10:30. \n\nWe were reluctantly brought to our table and I got a good look at the restaurant. The decor at blue finn is awesome, very modern and clean, however the cleanliness was offset by the large odorous stain that arrived with my girlfriend menu. I took it upon myself to replace that as the host who brought us to our table played with his iphone and chatted with his apparent friends. We waited a good 10 min to talk to anyone until finally our waitress came to the table. \n\nNow I didn't expect a TON from a waitress at a place like this but i do expect certain things. Things like, you actually know what the fuck a gin and tonic is. I mean really. How could you work at a restaurant with a full bar and not know what a gin and tonic is? After taking time to explain what a gin and tonic was, which made me feel like i was doing a damn disorono commercial (god i hope someone gets why that's funny) she apparently didn't know what well gin was either and instead, brought me a list of gins written by the bartender, all top shelf. I got tangaray and tonic which came so promptly that it blew past my girl's mojito (a house specialty) which came almost five min later. Why one would bring two drinks ordered at the same time at different times was a bit baffling but by this time i had a new distraction. Namely, the young man who had brought us in smoking directly outside of the restaurant, visible though the window. Now, this was okay with me but I decided to watch to see if he deemed it necessary to wash his hands post-fumeulously, He did not, and instead busied himself setting tables and eventually brought our next drinks. \n\nIn sort, the service here, fast or slow, attentive or lax, is just plain bad. We were one of two tables in the entire restaurant and failure was, most certainly, afoot. \n\nFood-wise, it's not terrible, and not that great either. I mean it's passable as sushi, the salmon sashimi i got was of good quality and their menu is interesting. I would like to try their folie gras ningiri at some point but not in the near future. All in all, i would pass on this place for sure. There are many a great sushi restaurants in sf and Blue Fin does not number among this group.", "author": "Logan H."}

We came to the intersection of Clement and 20th and we noticed that we had options. There was Minami, this hot pot restaurant and then Blue Fin sushi. Minami was crowded, the hot pot place looked dead, and Blue fin Sushi was just right. Not too crowded but wasn't too dead. \n\nYes.........the prices here are a little higher and the portions are a little smaller. Never had a roll that cost 14 dollars and some change. The rice was just a little too mushy for my taste but overall it wasn't too bad. We had white tuna sashimi which was good, the fried chicken which was very flavorful, california roll.......I know why do I always order this, I just like it, Toro which was very fresh, this raw oyster with uni and quail egg.....i didn't have any but my friends said that the ponzu overpowered the uni, and the seafood roll which was an unagi roll with uni on top of it.

The first two times I was here, the sushi chefs and waiters were very engaging with me. They even drank with me. I think that's very important at a Japanese restaurant and especially if you're sitting by the bar, you don't want to stare at chefs who does nothing but make sushi. It's also a Japanese culture for the chefs to be engaging.\n\nThe food was...well, let's just say they have good days and bad days. Catch them on a good day, then they're good. Catch them on a bad day, well, they're still ok, but I wouldn't go for the sashimi.\n\nThe best feature of this place is definitely the lounge right next door.

Blue fin tuna (you kind of have to get it, right?) is expensive as always, but is so soft and buttery, you'll be glad you ordered it. I often get boring standbys like rainbow rolls, caterpillar rolls, sake nigiri and a cooked roll here and there to mix things up, but our group of four liked everything that came to the table.\n\nThe decor definitely made for an interesting conversation topic; my roommate described it as \"euro disco,\" and it's actually accurate. Salt-water fish tank and blue mood lighting abounds, and I'd add that it feels a hair like old-time Vegas as well with that wacky casino-style carpeting.\n\nI don't often find good dessert options at a sushi resto, but yay: green tea ice cream and fried banana and ice cream.\n\nFun fact: It's connected to a sports bar next door, so you can (I hear?) eat your sushi in there if you prefer that to euro disco.\n\nFREE DELIVERY!

Sometimes that Safeway/Trader Joe's stuff just won't cut it. So my friends and I decided on Blue Fin since it was in the City, close to where most of us live, and looked reasonable in terms of pricing.\n\nWe had a reservation for about eleven people, and upon entering we realized that our group alone took up a pretty fair amount of space; overall the place isn't that big. Half of Blue Fin is a restaurant while the other half looks like a bar/lounge. Atmosphere-wise it's pretty nice, with dim lights and modern decor.\n\nThe menu isn't nearly as expensive as you'd imagine for a place that looks this nice, but some items look questionable - check out that \"Sunny Day\" Japanese pizza if you get a chance. I ordered a pair of special rolls and an appetizer and it came out to be a little over $20, which isn't bad. Everything was tasty and came in moderately sized portions (including the wasabi/ginger ... DAMN), and by the time I was finished I felt pretty full and satisfied. I think most of my friends felt the same.\n\nService was quick, and they were pretty patient with us considering we had to wait an extra hour for a few stragglers who couldn't find parking - that's the risk you take on a Friday night on Clement though, right?

Informal.  \n\nTheir specialty rolls are great and sometimes I crave them.  There regular rolls and nigiri are good.  They also have good burgers and other foodstuffs if you don't eat sushi, but the real joy I get there is on Sunday mornings.\n\nSunday mornings the bar is open early for all those who like to watch sports and for those wishing to nurse their hangovers.  The bartender whips up this concoction called a \"ramos fizz\" which is a light citrusy gin fizz that will knock out any hangover faster than you can say \"bloody mary\".  Their breakfasts are okay but their early lunch menu selections are actually pretty good.  The only down side is they don't serve sushi until the sushi bar opens in the evening.\n\nI've spent many a sunday morning or afternoon here.

We had the live scallop that was presented 2 ways: sashimi style and lightly sauteed with green onions and what appeared to be pieces of monkfish liver and squid.  Next, we had a sashimi plate of butterfish, more squid and white tuna toro.  Then we got the \"seabeam\" (snapper) tataki and finally, the unagi fried rice.  My partner also ordered 2 temaki rolls.  Every item was as good as what we hoped it would be, if not better.  The sashimis were so fresh and generously cut (but be sure to ask for the prices on items marked \"MP\" so as not to get a sticker shock when your bill arrives).  The tataki was so tasty!  The fish was lightly cooked from the hot oil that was poured over it.  The flavor from the (invisible) garlic and onions just made this dish from an otherwise mild tasting fish stand out.  But, the best dish for us both turned out to be the unagi fried rice.  We both loved the smokiness of the rice, the chunks of eel and the portion size.

Almost.\n\nThat said, distinguishing between them is a similar endeavor -- you start looking for slight variations, on the food, the service, the atmosphere. The ones that stand out win the day, while those that blend in and offer standard fare fall off the radar like so much aluminum-foil wrapping on a burrito.\n\nBut enough analogies.\n\nBlue Fin is solid. Our server was quirky, and simple things like glasses of water took forever. But she was nice enough, and not bad enough to warrant too much demerit.\n\nThe food was flavorful, fresh, and creative, all you can ask for in a sushi place. We had blue fin tuna nigiri and sake nigiri. The sake was fresh and delicious, but the blue fin was to die for. It was perfectly fatty and salty and savory and so so fresh and good. I wanted more, but I have to contain my inner glutton when eating sushi.\n\nWe had four rolls between four people: Caterpillar (eel and cucumber, topped w/avocado); Rainbow (standard, with various fish and snow crab); Spicy Crunchy Maki (hamachi, sake, tai, shrimp and onion, lightly deep fried); and Volcano (baked salmon w/spicy cream sauce, snow crab, avocado and tobiko). All were excellent, but I have to say, Volcano and Spicy Crunchy Maki stole the show.\n\nEven the desserts (green tea ice cream and fried bananas with ice cream) are outstanding here.\n\nDecor left me slightly nauseated, but that's okay. I was with good company and didn't look around too much.\n\nBest part of it all was the affordability.

The Hawaii roll is a must as well as the Volcano (love the creamy, slightly spicy sauce) -- both are filling and tasty.  I even enjoyed the Rainbow and Spider rolls-- classics that hit the spot.  Their desserts are decent though I wish they used green tea ice cream for the tempura ice cream (that's more standard, no?) and it was a bit too cakey for my taste ( I prefer a bit more crispy tempura batter).  \n\nGo to Blue Fin for the inventive and standard rolls that are always consistently good with no fuss.", "author": "Marie B."}

Lately, I've just been ordering for \"take-away\" (as the Brits like to call it) since I'm always impatient when it comes to delivery - except when it comes to pizza (and these guys have it too). Anyway, I found one of their menu's strapped to my door.

I'm usually out in about a minute.\n\nI did eat there a few times as well, and I wasn't disappointed either. The atmosphere is cool and the service seemed pretty efficient - I usually sit at the bar so I'm usually taken care of pretty good.\n\nOh yeah, the pizza. I did try a slice of the Osaka that some peeps at the next table let me try. It was good, and different. I actually felt like I was in an episode of the original Iron Chef trying this slice (I was actually waiting for some fish flavored ice cream to be served for desert).

My boyfriend loves sushi and he liked it a lot -- the only real complaint that he had about it was that the portions were quite large and therefore relatively expensive.   \n\nThey do have a fairly large American menu as well, and the bar portion of the building place is called Prime Time Grill -- we have not actually eaten inside the restaurant portion, just the bar.  I have not tried their burgers yet though I am intrigued, but their pizza is really good, and their garlic fries are excellent.  \n\nThere is a brunch on Sundays from 9a-1p where they serve their American menu as well as some special brunch items.  Don't bother with the brunch food as the hash browns are pre-formed frozen patties a la Ore Ida, and the eggs are cooked in some sort of omelette cooker that causes the outside to get a bit brown/burnt -- if you must have brunch here, go for the Spanish Omelette.  DO go for the drink specials though, especially the Ramos Fizz -- they're great for hangovers yet you still get your buzz on, and the bartender does a great job.

I've never had sushi in San Francisco that I thought wasn't at least ok until now.  Rice was cold and gooey, shrimp from their tempura rolls must have been sitting around for a while.\n\nI went here on a Saturday night at about 8:30pm -- right during prime time dinner hours -- because my cousin was in town and had a sushi craving.  This was the fourth or fifth place we tried because of course during prime-time on a Saturday night, all of the good places had a long wait.  The fact that this place could seat us right away should have been the first clue.\n\nSaturday during dinner hour you would hope that the turnover in the food and presumably the A-team kitchen staff would make the food at its best and freshest.  We had a small assortment of sushi -- New York Roll (shrimp tempura), Kappa Maki, Inari, FutoMaki, and one of their premium rolls with salmon and seaweed salad on top.\n\nThe rice was the worst I've had in any sushi restaurant.  It was quite cool and obviously not fresh.  It had no bite to it at all -- in fact it was a little overcooked and gooey and was sitting like a rock in my stomach a few hours later.  The shrimp tempura in the New York roll was heavily breaded, soggy, and cold.  It had obviously been cooked several hours before and had been sitting around, although from the heavy batter I doubt it had ever been very good.  The miso soup and wakame salad were fine, but seriously how hard are those to get wrong?\n\nThis place would still have gotten one-star from me but it didn't help that the kitchen also lost most of my order.  With the restaurant half-empty, this place still couldn't figure out that we had received only one of the seven dishes we ordered.  I had to get up from the table and track down a waiter to complain.  But as I said, this place was already a one-star before the service gaffe.  They were polite and apologetic but the damage was done.\n\nThis is the only sushi I've ever had that was worse than no sushi at all.  If this place is your only choice, save yourself some time and money and go to bed early hungry.", "author": "Steve B."}

We tried a couple of the house special rolls that were also very good. The prices are decent - $8.95 - $14.50 for the house special rolls. Their nigiri and maki rolls seem a bit more expensive than other places, but I would stick with the house rolls - there are a lot of different ones to choose from. \n\nI grabbed a to-go menu on my way out and found out they also have custom-made pizzas as well.

They give free validated parking (the lot is located about two blocks away).\n\nThe reason I am giving four stars instead of five:\n1. The music is often too loud and always cheesy.\n2. They leave the door open between the restaurant and the connecting pub. Why? It's loud.\n3. We have had at least one grumpy waitress (but usually the service is good).\n4.

I SEE YOU HOLD ON\" .\n\nAt this point, I am BEYOND angry.  Excuse me? We've been sitting here for 20 minutes and you act like we're BOTHERING you when we want you to take our order? If we weren't so damn hungry at the time we probably would've walked out.\n\nSo a couple of minutes later she comes by (no apologies or anything)...and huffily asks us what we want without making any eye contact with us. \n\n\nWe ordered :\n\nNama Kaki  (Raw oysters with uni and quail eggs) 15.95\nAlbacore Tataki   8.50\nVolcano Roll  9.50\nSpicy Tuna Roll 5.95\n\nNow the food was actually very good, especially the Nama Kaki. The oysters were fresh, and they paired very well with the uni and quail eggs. The volcano roll was delicious too, being actually spicy.\n\nI would have given them more stars just for the food alone, but I just couldn't with the kind of service we received.

My friend assured me that the last time he was at Blue Fin, the place was packed.  \n\nFeeling a little nervous, we opted for two seats at the sushi bar so that we can inspect the raw goods.  Service was great when we were the center of attention.  The sushi chefs were super nice, offering to change the T.V. channel for us so that we can watch the Warriors game.  We also managed to get freebie bite-size appetizers to start our meal.  \n\nThe sashmi melted in our mouth.  The rainbow roll was good.  The two salads that we got were also very nice.

The sauce is key, so make sure you get some on your roll before you eat it.  \n\nVolcano salad:  tasty salad with big hunks of spicy raw tuna and avocado.  We order it without the quail egg because, well, I don't like raw egg yolk in my salad.   Mix it all up before eating so that you get the dressing well distributed throughout the salad.  This is a good healthy counterbalance to the deep fried goodness described above.   \n\nVolcano roll:  baked salmon roll with spicy sauce.  Delish.\n\n***Also, a few notes about the adjacent bar/lounge:\n\nThe sports bar that shares the same kitchen and bathrooms as the sushi restaurant was recently revamped into a lounge.  Although the old school Niner jerseys that used to adorn the walls are long gone, thankfully they still show all the games on Sunday on their new flat screens.  Its far from a rowdy sports bar scene like you get at places like Underdogs, but the BBQ pizza, the full bar and the new couch-style chairs make spending 3 hours here on Sundays during football season quite comfy.

There is better service down the street, but that sushi bar recently received a mediocre health inspection report and the fish quality has gone down in recent times.

On Tuesday night, after a long stint in the library, I found myself in this category and absolutely craving some good sushi. I have NEVER ordered sushi and had it delivered, but being that I didn't feel like moving, I figured I could find a place that would deliver some sushi. It is SF after all.  Being that I am relatively new to the area, I relied on some yelp and some other online reviews which led me to this place. \nI placed the order on GrubHub.Com and I immediately received an e-mail confirming the delivery time. The delivery ended up arrived about 35 minutes late, which I wasn't too pleased with. But this place is not a skip, hop, or a jump from my house, so how mad can I be? Also, due to the nature of raw fish I was a little concerned what the uncooked sushi concoction could do to my colon after 35+ minutes without refrigeration. \nAll of the sushi I ordered was very well prepared in terms of presentation and the taste was great. I would highly recommend the Romeo and Juliet roll which consists of salmon and avocado wrapped in soybean paper and topped with fresh scallops. If you like a little kick in your sushi, but not over the top alarm spice, this is a great specialty roll. The spicy tuna and Rock and Roll - Roll were both delicious. I also ordered the sunomono which is a cucumber salad with a side of light vineager dressing. Although I usually gobble up salads at sushi spots, this one was a little sogged out as if they had cut the cucumber the day before. I am a pretty heavy eater, and these 4 items were more than enough for two meals for myself, but I always like to try out a bunch of different rolls. It was a little on the pricey side, but for the quality and the convenience of having it delivered ($20 delivery minimum and no delivery fee FYI!) it was worth it at that point in my day. Don't skimp when it comes to sushi and generally you will find you mind, body, and bathroom will be better off for it. I would definitely try it out if you have some time to wait for the delivery and you have a few extra dollars to kick down on some great sushi.

The sushi here is decent.  This place uses a  little too much rice but the sushi itself is not bad.  The albacore tataki was awesome for $1.  The skinny cow ordered a sea lion roll.  I never knew you could eat a raw sea lion.  Cows only know land animoes.  But she actually wanted the sea king roll.  I think thats the best roll you can get.  Who doesn't like sushi topped with a heaping pile of baby turd called uni?  I bet skinny cows would bathe in it.

Went on a Saterday and was told I could not use the GroupOn on a Saterday. My fault I should have read the coupon. Another couple seated next to us made the same mistake. To be fair it was Our fault not the Restaurant's. Ordered squid to start and specifically told the server to start with it. However the sushi came out first. They were good about canceling the squid. Rocknroll, spicy tuna, and alaska role. Right away I could tell the tuna was not fresh. The color while it was not grey, was less then pink, and no way even red as fresh tuna should be. The flavors just kinda blended together and tasted the same. non fresh fish will do that. I won't be back even with the groupon.  This town is full of good sushi places, and littered with bad ones.

First the order for the delivery was not to my expectations. But i also added the point that when you have something delivered it is just medicore. But when  your sushi is mixed in with your warm or should i say lukewarm entrees. THe freshness of any fish will falter. I am not sure what you guys are thinking when you do your deliveries. This is definitley not pizza that is all wet and sweaty but it is still ok cuz pizza is pizza. But Sushi????? WTF", "author": "jacqueline c."}

We also had some grilled squid, salmon w/ oyster shooters, as well as foie gras nigiri. The bar has a nice lounge feel to it and was remolded very nicely.

I don't love it - although certain items on the menu show really flashes of talented deliciousness from the chef - but I do go back.  What can I say - it is a couple of blocks from my house, they are tolerant of my baby snoozing in his stroller or staring at the fish tanks and the noise level makes it so they cannot hear him if he bitches that his mom is keeping him up too late at night (bad mommy!) - but there is not much to distinguish it from every other sushi joint in the Richmond -- other than the odd coupling with the pizza place/sport bar next door.  There are usually large groups celebrating birthdays for some reason. There are big flat panel TVs showing demonstrations of chefs making sushi.  What the owners' thought this added to the restaurant ambience I cannot fathom.  I also do find is disconcerting to sit in a restaurant full of fish tanks whilst eating raw fish - but maybe that is just me. \nHighlights are the appetizers.  If you stick to the lobster thingy and the other groovily-named apps, you cannot go wrong.  Good places for big noisy group and probably kids.

While the quality and freshness of fish is overall GOOD, the workmanship of the rolls, sushi, and special sashimi plates sucks. The spicy tuna roll had a few problems with how it was made, 1.) wayy too much rice and cucumber, 2.) roll was wayy too wide and should be cut in 6 pieces, not 4  3.) hardly any spicy tuna!!  The halibut sushi still partially had the skin on it, so it was very chewy. The tea they served was a nice compliment, although it was chinese black tea, not green tea as it should be at any authentic Japanese restaurant.  The miso soup was hot, but was pretty bland and not enough flavor. Lastly, the special sashimi plate (w/ ponju sauce) was LOADED UP with wayy too many condiments such as onions, carrots and sauce.  The dessert we ordered was the green tea frozen mocchi ice cream, which was good, but the kind they serve you can buy in the freezer section at any japanese or korean grocery market -- kinda cheap.\n\nI'm not sure if this place is owned by Japanese or not, but the details, workmanship, service and authenticity are not there.

First, the food lately hasn't tasted as fresh - not a good thing when you're ordering raw fish. Second, the main reason we were ordering from here was because it's one of the only sushi places that delivers. Unfortunately, the last time we did, their third party delivery website,  grubhub.com, somehow CHANGED our order after we hit the submit key! Literally half the sushi order was changed, and all we had done was click on the \"reorder\" link which is supposed to just redo the exact same last order and had always worked in the past. We didn't discover the change until the food was delivered and we saw the new receipt. We contacted grubhub and they took no responsibility, even claiming that the our order history had always been what we just now received. We took a screen shot of our order history as it appeared on THEIR website to prove they were wrong, and all they said was that they would try to fix this error so that it wouldn't occur again in the future. They refused to give us a refund even though we couldn't even eat the sushi that had arrived since it contained shellfish (allergies) - $30 worth of sushi that we had to just throw away.

There is a nice big aquarium in which many brightly colored tropical fish dart in and out of rocks and coral. On to the food... WONDERFUL! They have a bevy of rolls that are unique to Bluefin, and they have a little book on each table with 3x5 photos of each roll so you know what to expect. The appetizers are very delicioso (shrimp, lobster tail w/ mango sauce), but you must save your appetite for the SUSHI!!! Sadly I can't remember the names of the rolls, but the plating of each roll is beautiful.. I think it's called a volcano roll, it has spicy red mayo on it, and tuna.. oh it's so good!! A big, thick green streak of wasabi, huge roll in the middle, and fried sprigs of something in tempura batter. WOW. Don't forget to order the fried ice cream at the end either :)", "author": "O K."}

We live a couple blocks away and it is a huge plus that you can order pick up or delivery online.  The spicy tuna rolls are HUGE and the Tako Nigiri is fresh and tasty.  This was a great find for us.", "author": "greg F."}

Haven't been to the restaurant yet but I'm sure it's fantabulously even better considering the yummy delivery.  My fiance and I always order far more then we can actually consume (which is a shame 'cause leftovers don't get eaten) and add an indulgent free crab rangoon.  Spicy Tuna Roll, Volcano, Dragon, Spicy Crunchy Maki & Una-Tem rolls are the one's that repeatedly make the cut and the age-old staple: simple Tekka Maki.  Yum.", "author": "M M."}

I wait for like 2 minutes, the bartender stares at me and doesn't say anything. I finally figure out that the restaurant has a separate entrance. The first set of food came out in rather normal timing. We ended up ordering more food. I understand sometimes the restaurant get busy but the waitress forgot about my soup, which could be understandable. We waited for our dessert for like an hour, the waitress should have said something like \"it's coming up sorry for the wait\". Instead we were ignored. I get the bill and she included 15% gratuity in our bill which I found outrageous that she felt that she can provide bad service and then force us to tip her. I came to the host and I asked him to take it off the bill because I don't have to pay 15% when I receive bad service. I would have tipped 10% in an instance like this but I felt like she was trying to pull one one me. I usually tip 20% for good service but this wasn't ok with me.", "author": "Erica K."}

The fish here was incredibly fresh and it was just so damn good... oh man.  I'm the kind of person who can eat sushi nearly every day of the week and not get sick of it and if I had the dough, I'd probably spend a lot of it here.  Main problem: the video playing on both sides of the room showing how they make the sushi were distracting and the annoying music (it reminded me of the Strong Bad email about techno music... and then the bass comes in and it goes 'thump thump thump' and then the sirens come in with the obscure noir movie quotes).  Definitely worth checking out though.  Side note: they offer 2 hours of free parking if you get a ticket to put on your dashboard - I guess just roll by the restaurant, pick one up, then park a block and a half away at the lot between Clement and Geary on 18th.", "author": "Margie N."}
