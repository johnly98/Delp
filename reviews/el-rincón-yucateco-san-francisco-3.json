I've had pleasant experiences with holes in the wall when it comes to authenticity but the customer service has truly turned me away. There were no more than 7 customers including my friend and I, the owner showed us our table and fixed it as it seemed to have a broken leg once we sat. One of the two waitress took our order and thus began the waiting game. More than 25 minutes passed and my friend got his food, I tried to grab the waitress attention and asked her to cancel my appetizer but the owner jumped in and told the cooks to cancel my order. So not only did I have to wait more than 25 minutes now I was not going to get to eat? The owner and cooks were arguing and ignoring my requests but thankfully I was able to tell the waitress that I had not asked to cancel my order and they brought out the food a while later with no apologies and seemed annoyed as the arguing continued in the kitchen.\n\nTl;Dr:\n\nFood: 3/10  \nService: 1/10\nHealth Score of 88 hidden behind the register.\n\nIt's true that you get what you pay for so take your business somewhere else.", "author": "Paloma P."}

We came upon this spot by accident after walking down from a nearby bar. As a pescatarian, I was unsure about my food options...but luckily they had a fried fish dish that came with rice and beans. I'm not one to get fried fish, but I decided to go for it and start with a veggie empanada which was filled with cheese. Bae got the carne tamale and the infamous poc-chuc which is marinated pork. We both thought the food was above average for a more indigenous style of Mexican food...it wasn't the commonplace Americanized-Mexican cuisine, which we enjoyed. My empanada was not the flaky kind that I prefer, but a fried one that was much smaller in size and less filling. It was alright, I wouldn't necessarily order it again. The fried fish was surprisingly yummy and flavorful...and although the salad part was kind of a weird component in my opinion, I did like the sides of rice and soupy beans. My fooding partner said the poc-chuc was good, but he had better marinated pork on a blacktop fajitas plate elsewhere.\n\nService is minimal and small, as the shop itself is small and seemingly family-owned. The food server is also the cashier, and he is a hardworking and friendly dude. Hats off to you, sir! They had a lot of to-go food orders with people walking out with take-out boxes, and smaller groups of 2 to 4 walking in to enjoy an in-house dinner. I wouldn't come here in a large group, as space is limited...also the ambiance is lacking. Nothing looks entirely pleasing to the eye and there is no music being played, so feel free to people-watch to your heart's delight!", "author": "Jodi H."}

To be fair, I don't really eat Mexican cuisine much and I felt that this is more of a 3.5 stars review than a 3. So you should take my review with a skeptical eye.\n\nI ordered the Milanesa (Chicken), which contained breaded chicken, a side salad with avocado, rice, and bean pur\u00e9e. It's a big bang for your buck because there's a lot of food for $12.50. The chicken was crispy and it was deeply fried. So I would recommend this dish if you stop by. However to me, the rice had an odd aftertaste to it and the bean pur\u00e9e was not that good. The pur\u00e9e was super liquidly and I mainly dipped my tortilla in it. \n\nMy friend got the Zalado and it was sort of disappointing. It came with like three thinly slices of pork, some cabbage, and the bean pur\u00e9e. The portion was really small for what it cost and he probably was still hungry after the meal. It's funny because his dish costed more than my dish. \n\nMy other friend got the Puchero and I wasn't a big fan of that dish either. The meat to noodle portion was way off. There was just way too much chicken with the bones attached on it. \n\nIf I could give a tip, I would suggest that they have pictures on the menu. I thought I knew how my friend's dishes were going to be presented, but I was way off. This is random, but I thought having a sink in the dining area was actually amusing. Really set the vibe of a hole in the wall.", "author": "Victor L."}

Lucky for me San Francisco has abundant supply of Yucatan specialized restaurants. I was very excited to try El Rincon Yucateco as it was very well-reviewed. The restaurant ambience is casual. There was a group of 20 something year olds merrily discussing their favorite food. I orderd a sampler of panucho, salbute and tamal colado. The panucho with pork was delicious, not as tasty, or as big, as the one i got in Mexico ironically (everything in the US is supposed to be bigger.) After this, the rest of the food was disappointing. The salbute with chicken was definitively bland. The tamal colado with ground pork was a little off in terms of the spices that they used. It was not very tasty albeit the properly tender white masa. Even though it was wrapped in banana leaves I could not smell any fragrance that you would expect from banana leaves. Overall, I'm glad I visited it, but I'm not sure if I will come back because there is way better Yucatan food elsewhere.", "author": "Thuy V."}

Oh sure, I've been to Poc-Chuc, Yucatasia, and both locations of Mi Lindo Yucatan (both sadly closed). I've even been to the Yucatan, but I honestly couldn't describe it as anything more than Mexican with a Cuban-Caribbean twang. The twang comes from the predominant use of pork and chicken usually marinated in achiote, a sweet-spicy red sauce native to the Yucatan, or some kind of citrus for a tropical kick. Hey, that's pretty good for a Yucatecan luddite. All I know is it's Latin comfort food I genuinely like if it's prepared by people who know how.\n\nI came upon this place only because it showed up on my Yelp app, and it was a pretty easy ride on the 38 for me to get there. It's actually catty-corner from Bourbon & Branch, so there may be some hipster spillover here but not the evening I was there. In fact, there was only one other customer there, a fellow Asian but with a pocket protector and a bigger smartphone than mine. Compensating I'm guessing. Judging from the menu, it definitely looks like they know their stuff here. I decided to try a specialty as a starter, the $2.50 Salbute, a handmade fried tortilla puff topped with pork, green leaf, marinated red onions and avocado (photo: http://bit.ly/1Qzso4n). It had me at 'fried' as it was like a tostada with more character and definitely more flavor. I could have had a couple more and called it a night.\n\nSince I just had the pork, I bypassed the Poc-Chuc for the $12 Pollo Asado, which was a whle chicken leg in achiote and again with the marinated red onions and avocado. This time it came with a side of rice, sliced tomatoes, sliced radishes and pureed black beans (photo: http://bit.ly/1jcDbXX). All the accessories tasted just fine, especially the fried tortillas (photo: http://bit.ly/1KRADss), but it was unfortunately hamstrung by how overcooked the chicken was. I was bummed because I thought I was safe with dark meat but alas it was left in the port too long. However, that won't stop me from a return visit.

The food is good. \n\nAlthough enough has been said, the Yelp app insists I write more or be condemned to being a tipster. In my experience, things that end in ipster suck. For example, hipsters suck. Fortunately, there were none in this restaurant. I will continue writing because of the message, \"Sweet deets. Now put some mustard on that review!\"\n\nThe dining experience was normal. The restaurant had a few tables. The tables had either two or four chairs. There was and probably still is a sink in the dining room. People brought us food. The food is the primary impetus for the review; we ordered several food items. I recommend the poc chuc and carne asada. I haven't had the latter, but it smelled and sounded good as they gave it to the guy at the table next to us. \n\nThe service was adequate. As I mentioned, people brought us food. Our server was lovely. I think my server was overwhelmed by the intense, positive feelings I expressed after tasting the tortillas. \n\nI once heard, \"You wrote the pants off that review. We salute you.\" I agree. This review is epic. The food is probably only three star quality, but the homemade tortillas add a few stars.

Just a very comforting and hearty dish that is executed well with fresh ingredients. Big chucks of beef with rib still in it along with chopped up squash and carrot. The broth is rich with meaty flavors and the sweetness of the vegetables. Homemade corn tortilla is served as a side, and they are absolutely delectable with amazing texture. (thicker than the usual tortillas from mexican restaurants, you can smell the freshness of the homemade corn tortilla). Fresh radishes and salsa provides a nice complement to the dish. The salsa has a pretty nice kick of heat, so be careful not to douse your tortilla with it, but the flavors are complex and provides a nice boost of acidity and punch to everything you add them to. They also serve a little bowl of coconut rice that is velvety, puffy, and plain delicious.\nService is prompt, but again, you definitely come here for the food not the ambiance.

But got two of them and they are out of this world, I definitely recommend this to taco lovers/enthusiasts. For the price they are worth the try. Really nice.", "author": "Jones B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-03-13", "description": "Was excited to try this hole in the wall restaurant next to my hotel after reading rave reviews. However, my experience here was less than ideal. The food was delicious and the price was great for what you get. The service is where I felt this little restaurant was lacking. It took 20 mins to get our order taken, and another 45 minutes to get our bill. When I tried to stand at the counter to pay our bill the waitress would blatantly ignore me and walk past me while avoiding eye contact. Go here only if you have a lot of extra time.", "author": "Charlene R."}

The homemade tortillas are a must buy. I highly recommend visiting! The service was very fast and we barely waited for food. It's a small place, perfect for lunch.", "author": "Catie M."}

My partner (African-American guy) ordered Sopa de Coditos with chicken and he loved it. \nFor vegetarians like me, you have the options to request some of the appetizers or entr\u00e9es without meat.\nI ordered Empanadas (quesadillas) without cheese and server with cabbage, onions, habanero sauce and lime.\nBe careful my people, Yucatecos use a lot habanero chilli. Ask for non spicy or little spicy if you can't handle.\nThe place is too small so I recommend order for to go. But for those leaving the bars around the area is a good option to eat some food before back to home!!", "author": "Arturo R."}

The fish fillet was likely frozen fried fish fillets.  Worse than what you would get at McDonalds.  Salad was very good, had avocado in it.  Rice and beans tasty as well.  Service was pleasant.

There was a Yucatan restaurant a couple blocks away that closed a few years ago and they had a few dishes this place doesn't have, but everything I've gotten there has been absolutely delicious.
