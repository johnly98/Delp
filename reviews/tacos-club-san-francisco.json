I guess this is what I get for living in the Bay.  \n\nBut for $7 you wish the fish was actually crispy and the sauce to be decently flavorful.  Rather, the sauce was runny, they skimp on the cabbage and the tortillas were soggy.  \n\nThe al pastor had good flavor but part of the draw for this meat needs to be the char and there was none whatsoever.  The texture contrast was absent and it's not a good sign if I can make a better al pastor.  Also, no pineapple?  \n\nThe carnitas was the best one but again, if you don't have any part of it be even remotely crispy then carnitas will never really be carnitas.  \n\nAlso, no salsa bar and radishes and pickled vegetables?  This is a taco club I never want to get into again.", "author": "Jason L."}

If there were an actual taco club that I could join, I would be the Treasurer or the Secretary or some higher-up in the organization, but not the President or the VP, too much responsibility and you'd probably have to show up on time and do a lot of delegating. I think I'd feel more comfortable allocating the funds for tacos and libations, and showing up 20 minutes or so late to each meeting.\n\nThe most recent meeting of the just-now-created taco club occurred last night with my platonic bae and only other member of the taco club Hector M at Tacos Club in the Castro. I got a craving for tacos early Tuesday while thinking about what I wanted for lunch, but since I had already promised myself Turtle Tower (since this may be the last week of jury duty and TT won't be as accessible), I asked Hector if he wanted to catch some brews and tacos after quittin' time.\n\nHe found Tacos Club on Yelp, though he's a Mission local and my favorite Salvadoran, he says that \"Taco Tuesday is a white people thing\" so local taquerias may not be accommodating. Oh man, ladies and germs, this place is really DEEELLLISSSHHH. I now want tacos again just thinking about how great of a time we had. Fast service and sweet, cute boys working there, awesome $2 tacos, $3 beers, and $4 sangria that packs a punch. Also who can say no to homemade tortilla chips and perfectly seasoned guac??

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-07-27", "description": "Actually Jamie W. and I didn't mean to come here. Yes, I realize that's not an impressive way to start a review, but I have to be honest and tell you our original intention was to try Tacorgamisco across the street. The problem was that it was packed with hipsters on their smartphones, and we just had little tolerance for the surly indifference we were sure was wafting through the newly popular spot. Meanwhile, there's this space-challenged taqueria right next to Super Duper Burgers where the comparatively less fashionable apparently patronize. We were fine with that and also with the robust-enough menu that offered burritos, tacos, enchiladas, botanas (appetizers) and platos grandes (photo: http://bit.ly/1evOaZw).\n\nBoth of us bypassed the more standard items and went for what we thought might be their specialties. Jamie went for the $9.25 Al Pastor Torta in which they stuffed their spicy pork meat into an Acme soft roll with tomato, onion, crema, lettuce, queso cheese and refried pinto beans. Sounded like a tasty sandwich, but it didn't elevate above its ingredients into anything that was too memorable. Although the house-made corn chips were a nice touch, there was a nagging blandness to the whole plate, and fresh salsa was the only salvation (photo: http://bit.ly/1SaLsLn). Mine was the more ambitious $12.50 Carnitas Plato Grande where the abundant portion of slow-cooked pork tasted slightly burnt like it was left on the grill a bit too long.\n\nThere were plenty of distractions on the plate though with quite a bit of rice, black beans, salsa fresca, a grilled jalapeno and three flour tortillas (photo: http://bit.ly/1OxRVtU). However, none of that was enough to offset my initial disappointment with the carnitas since so many other places prepare it so perfectly. The place doesn't take very long to crowd up, but instead of a hipster-centric vibe, it was more of a gentrified dine-and-dash group which we found much more tolerable on a Tuesday evening. Given all the stellar Mexican choices in this city, even in the neighborhood (El Castillito comes to mind), I'm not sure when I'll be back to Tacos Club, but I'd be willing to try it again just to see if it was an off night for them.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...Mexican dishes that just miss the mark with a missing ingredient or an overlong layover on the grill\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...pleasant when it's empty but it gets to be a tight squeeze soon enough\nSERVICE - 3 stars...quietly unobtrusive\nTOTAL - 3 stars...not my favorite taqueria but not the most reviled either", "author": "Ed U."}

Lastly, the Shrimp taco was a further delicious taste of authentic, real food (honestly, the food was all so vibrant, it was a true treat indeed!).

SUPER POINTS for this ~~  The slow cooked pork was tender and falling off each other, and it was perfectly seasoned, not too salty. the rice was pefectly made. the rice wasnt mushy wet or too stiff. I got the pinto beans which was flavored well. I also tried their HORCHATA which is made of rice and seasoned with  cinnamon and sweetener. Delicous! One of the best horchata i have tasted. Also i got a steak taco which was delicous, again they give you alot of meat!\n\nI would definitely go back to this place again if i am ever craving mexican food. Its easier here to find parking rather than going to the mission  and spending a good hour looking for parking. \n\nAnother bonus i would like to add to this place is good service.

Fat burritos, succulent carnitas, tasty guacamole, and the orange-slice water is a really nice touch that separates it from the rest of the taquerias in this town. \n\nNo, wait, you know what separates it from the other taquerias? \n\nEverybody behind that counter is always happy. Every single time. I don't mean, they're pleasant and cordial, I mean, everyone I've spoken to at Tacos Club acts like they woke up that morning and said, \"Sweet! I get to make tacos today!\" They're not bouncing off the walls or anything obnoxious, they just seem to really love their neighborhood and what they do. Making delicious tacos.

I don't want to be the douche that complains about trivial things but a pet peeve of mine is when your price board doesn't match what you are actually charging me.  I complained before and got my 50 cents back with a promise that they will change their price board soon.  A month later, it's still the same issue.  Although this time I didn't complain as I didn't have the energy to point this out.  Instead, here I am yelping about this bad business practice.  If you increase the price, show it on the board and your menu.  Don't let me be surprised to see this when I check my receipt.  50 cents may not be much but we all work hard for our money and deserve paying what is written!  How can this be reported to authorities?  Do you guys have any suggestions?\n\nOk, enough ranting about the price.  I gotta say the food is really good here though.  Although, it's a bit pricey compared to the other taquerias in the gayborhood (Castro).  The chile verde burrito I have here is so tasty and has more flavor than the other taquerias. Their breakfast burrito is so good too.  Be careful though because the burritos are really hot temperature wise so don't expect to eat it right away or you will be burnt.  Like I said it's pricey as it doesn't come with free chips.  An additional sour cream or guacamole would cost you additional 2.00 towards your regular burrito.  \n\nI hope they fix their pricing issue and other yelpers, please let them know as well so it's just not me who gripes about this.  :D", "author": "flozion f."}

Here's the deal: Everyone in SF has there own things they like about burritos, so maybe everyone won't agree with this review. For me, this was the best burrito I've had in the city in years. \n\nFor years I was a SF burrito lover. I started dating someone from San Diego and tried one of the burritos down there, which put SF burritos to shame. They don't have rice/beans in their burritos - just meat and guac, which made me realize that the rice/beans just masks the flavor of the delicious meat. So, I've been ordering my burritos that way in SF for about 2 years and I'm constantly disappointed. I've been trying to make the switch to tacos, but I always miss burritos. \n\nLast night I ordered a carne asada burrito with nothing but meat and guac. It was perfect. Amazing tortilla, deliciously grilled steak, and a thick (but not too thick) guac that complemented it perfectly. Each bite I took I was sad that it was that much closer to being done. \n\nI ordered my BF a chicken quesadilla, which he couldn't eat bc he had been sick all day. Naturally, I ate 60% of it. Quesadillas aren't  really my thing, but again, the tortilla and grilled, juicy chicken were so good I couldn't help myself. The only problem is that today I feel like I weigh 400 pounds.", "author": "B B."}

Awesome chips, flautas are money and the ingredients used seem to be quality. \n\nHere's where they fall short.....\n\nNo salsa bar (WTF?). Pinner tacos. These tacos are almost $3 and they are the type you could eat in two bites; weak sauce. They should cost a $1; flavor is nothing special either. They also DO NOT hook you up with chips when you buy tacos, you have to pay $3 for them, which I did, and they did not hook up any salsa. I am sure that doesn't typically happen, but the reason I came here was because I wanted the fresh fried chips and salsa ( I knew I should have checked!!!). They also give you a tiny portion of chips. Most taquerias will give you as many chips as you want for free, so I was expecting to get hooked up when I paid $4 for some chips (quit being so stingy!)\n\nIt really sucked not getting the salsa. I probably would have given them two stars, but the service is really great, the flautas are worth coming back for, and I am sucker for fresh fried tortilla chips. Would be four if they would hook it up on the portions by about 1/4. Yes, I'm a fatboy.", "author": "Eucalyptus J."}

I hadn't eaten all day and it was almost 4 pm, couldn't stand to walk another block.\n\nI came here a few times when it was La Fajita. I really wasn't a fan of that place. Figured I'd give the redux restaurant a shot.\n\nDamn, I'm glad I did. I ordered the vegetarian cactus burrito on a spinach tortilla. Everything was fresh and delicious. It was honestly one of the best burritos I've ever eaten, and blows away any burrito I've ever had at any of the other Mexican restaurants in the area. \n\nGuy working at the counter (mid 20s, buzzed head) was super friendly, checked up on me and everything. Great service, great food. My new burrito spot in the Castro.", "author": "L M."}

So I order a chicken burrito and I also asked for a medium spicy salsa and extra chips on the side..  order came to 13.00..   no big deal..   So I am walking down Market street and I decide I want to have a few chips..  and that is exactly what was in the bag with TWO tiny containers of salsa!!!!!!     So I go back to the taco club to see what happened and the young guy behind the counter had NO understanding as to what I was talking about.   I told him that I had ordered a medium order of spicy salsa and extra chips and the burrito was only 8.00 so WHY did the order come to 13.00????   He said that orders were \"subject to change\" on the menu?????   WHAT DOES THAT MEAN??    So of course I did NOT get what I wanted so I asked for a refund..   got the refund..   young man behind the counter VERY argumentative with me throughout the WHOLE BAD experience of dealing with this situation!!
