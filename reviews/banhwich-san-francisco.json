Instead of using the traditional round shaped bread they now substitute it with a flat kind of bread. I personally like the new bread  more bc it's more crispy in texture! \n\nPro: they are very quick! You will probably get your food in and out within 5mins.

I unraveled that sandwich from its wrapper and was greeted by a pretty golden brown color. First bite, wow. Crunch, crunch. It was deliciously crunchy. How the heck? No other banh mi places ever had this amazing crunch. The only disappointing thing was that I order the #1 Combination Pork and there was very little meat in it. I did have a LOT of carrots though but the sauce was kind of dry or nonexistent. I came back again and was smarter and got the BBQ Pork (which I had meant to order originally but because my eyes saw combo pork and it was #1, I thought I was ordering the right one... HAHAHA... I need to learn to read the entire menu next time). The BBQ Pork was much more satisfying and for $4 + tax, WORTH IT!\n\nFew seats to sit at but not sure if you want to sit here because there's really nothing to look at.

(Or, should I go along with the wordplay and say BAHN?)  But with banh mi, there is indeed a fine line between just tasty vs. awesome, and Banhwich lies solidly in the ranks of awesomeness.\n\n[BACKGROUND]\n\nI used to work at the Safeway pharmacy nearby, and I would always be at a loss for what to eat for lunch.  Safeway pre-cooked food made from unsold groceries?  Eww.  Eating at a restaurant all by myself?  Forever alone.  However Bahnwich is the perfect place for a quick grab-and-go, and was also indulge-able--perfect at 1pm when you're hangry for lunch.\n\n[NOMS]\n\nI got the standard grilled pork banh mi, and every layer exceeded my expectation.\n  \n1. First of all, the bread tasted fresh and was incredibly flaky.  Despite making a mess, warm toasty baguette bread makes sandwiches magical.    \n\n2. I was unimpressed when I saw the meat being microwaved, but just because you don't see this at other places doesn't mean it doesn't happen.  It ended up tasting alright--if it were grilled to order, it would take far longer, you'd run a higher risk of under-cooked food, and half of it would probably be burnt.   \n\n3. The pate or whatever mystery sauce was used to slather the bread was savory and complex.  Although I can't assess the homemade-ness of the pate, at least it seems better than bottled mayo/ketchup/mustard of American sandwiches.\n\n4. The crunchy assorted veggies were decent, with a shout-out to the thick layer of sliced carrots for adding the satisfying texture (and healthiness)\n\nIf you aren't in the sandwich mood, the plates look good and satisfying as well.\n\n[INSTAGRAMABILITY]\n\nThe food is Instagramable, but everything else is definitely not... to be optimistic, I guess you could enjoy the ambiance of street food, but I would much rather take my food to-go.  Although the place doesn't look the best, I applaud the 92/100 health score, which exceeds many shiny-looking restaurants.\n\n[THE MARKET]\n\nClearly, Banhwich dominates: one day I went to Guerra's Market & Deli and paid $9 for a sandwich, which I was far less satisfied with than the $3.50 Banhwich.  I guess Guerrra's has a nicer ambiance, but it doesn't matter because they don't have a seating area so you have to take your sandwich to-go anyways.  Guerrera may also have better service, but that doesn't matter either because I don't mind missing out on small-talk.", "author": "Edna C."}

I got the BBQ pork and my boyfriend got the combo pork. The BBQ pork was by far one of the best I've had in a long time. The pickled veggies were crisp and there was also cucumber in the banh mi which I've never seen before. I was also really excited they didn't have jalape\u00f1os in them, since I'm not really good with spicy food. The star of the sandwich though was definitely the bread. There's been so many times when I've gotten banh mi where the bread is ridiculously crusty to the point where it just hurts when you bite it. This bread was crispy on the outside but still soft and chewy on the inside and was the perfect balance. The combo pork banh mi wasn't bad, but I definitely would prefer the warm BBQ pork sandwich any day. \n\nCons: $4 for a banh mi? I'm used to $2 banh mi in San Diego so this was kind of pricey for what it is, but the bread alone would make me come back. \n\nPs: cash only!

This place could easily get 4 or 5 stars with some small improvements. I'll start with what I really like about this place. \n\nThe food is pretty good but I LOVE their green tea and lychee milk tea. Its not actually a milk tea but more like a milk slushy but it tastes really good! The smoothies are made from powder but somehow they make it taste fresh and delicious. Their food is also very reasonably priced. \n\nThe problem with this place however is the guy who owns it never speaks or smiles. I order something and he just goes to the back and makes it or whispers something to the person working in the back. Sometimes I can't even tell if he heard my order or not. Moreover, the place has problems with cleanliness. The guy who handles the money also makes the sandwiches. I also saw a hair on one of the spring rolls they were selling in packets on the counter and told the guy so no one buys it and reports him. He just took it and threw it in the back without saying thank you or anything. I feel like if the guy working here just smiles and says thank you after your purchase once in a while and tried slightly harder to be cleaner, this place can be one of the best viet shops in sf. \n\nOverall, great spring rolls and great lychee and green tea milk smoothies. However, poor service and poor cleanliness.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

Maybe it was pent up emotions from that hot girl from the Nom Nom Truck on The Great Food Truck Race or that lengthy talk i had with my friend about the best sandwiches in San Francisco. Anyway, i had a craving and luck was not on my side.\n\nIt was 6:20. I has hungry. I needed a viet sandwich. I was confident and cocky that my favorite place, Irving Cafe + Deli (which is much better than saigon sandwich because of the pate) would be open for another couple of hours and able to satisfy. Unfortunately, it closes at 6:30. I dialed up a couple more places and they all close at 6:30 as well...at last, i found Banhwich that is nearby and closes at 7. \n\nThe reviews for this place looked okay but since i never heard of it, i had my doubts. Going in, i see this old man who was ready to close up shop. I ordered 2 combination pork sandwiches, waited 5 minutes for my French Bread (not traditional vietnamese  sandwich bread) to get toasted and excitedly went home to try out the hot sandwich...and here is what i thought of it:\n\nGood Points:\n\n1. owner was nice\n2. meat and other condiments were put on carefully and everything was in place\n3. $3.50 for a combination pork...slightly bigger than normal\n\nBad Points:\n\n1. Bread was dry. (it needed the traditional viet bread)\n2. pate (my favorite part of a viet sandwich) lacked flavor\n3. got cold within 5 minutes of receiving the order\n4. meat and everything else was just ok\n\nOverall impression:\n\n1. despite the neat presentation, the sandwich lacked quality\n2. none of the meat items were great, especially the flavorless pate\n3. at $3.50, the price was standard\n4. the bread was a major downfall\n\nBottom Line:\n\n- this sandwich reminded me of how cheap a viet sandwich is to make. I know that most places, if not all places use prepacked meats but i could taste it here with every bite. maybe the lack of customers means that the meat i ate was very very old.\n- it did not satisfy my craving and because of this experience, i am worried that my next viet sandwich will also disappoint (maybe the super deliciousness was all in my head). \n- unfortunately, this place turned me off from viet sandwiches for a while", "author": "Simon L."}

Also had a pearl tea (which I thought was supposed to be a pearl milk tea, but which turned out to be a pearl almost frozen liquid tea). But I can't complain too much about the mango or green tea ones aside from the extra freeziness of them.\n\nOverall first impressions? I still love this place. Must be the name. It's fun to say.

Unfortunately, it's the closest Vietnamese sandwich shop near my house. My first time there was actually around the time it opened. At the time my sister had a big Vietnamese sandwich phase. Every weekend we used to go all the way to Clement to go to Little Paris for their BBQ Beef sandwich, but sadly us it closed down :( So to suppress our sadness, we wanted to find a nice local shop. While we were driving on Taravel one day, we saw Banhwich. In my head I thought, what a cute name! (In Vietnamese the word for sandwich is Banh Mi so I liked their play on words.) So we stopped by and decided to try the pork sandwich. When we got home we found that the sandwich had sort of a bleach-y taste to it... somewhat bland and as if someone sprinkled something special ingredients on it. Definitely wasn't too happy with that. I gave it another try recently and it wasn't as bad as the first time, but there was nothing too striking about it. Total let down :(", "author": "Julie L."}

It was the right choice - classic vietnamese sandwiches at the right price (beats my Cafe Dolci - I guess C.D. has the $.75 downtown premium).  The bread is incredibly fresh, a result, I would guess, of the fact that Bahnwich is conveniently located next to the suspiciously-named \"French Bakery\" (like, if you have to call it that, you're probably not), and since an essential ingredient of good bahn mi is the french roll, this is clearly a match made in heaven.  The innards of the sandwich - heapings of shredded carrot, sweet bbq pork, marinated onion and fresh cilantro - stood up to the quality of the roll.
