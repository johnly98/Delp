We booked the patio with them, which is absolutely gorgeous - we actually chose this place as a reception venue before we chose the ceremony location because we've loved the enclosed yet still on the street feel of the place. Julia Galeota, their event director and the rest of the staff were so accommodating in terms of helping us reserve a date, choose the menu and drinks and set up and have a cake delivered, etc. The food was absolutely incredible - guests were commenting for days about on how good it was and how fabulous the cocktails were. \n\nThe best part, even though the patio is still attached to the restaurant and it was pride weekend (and therefore nuts everywhere around SOMA) it felt like we had the entire place to ourselves, and everything felt so secluded and peaceful. Incredible food, amazing cocktails and staff that made us feel like the venue was our home for a night, we couldn't have asked for a better place to celebrate our big day.", "author": "Sarah T."}

This place is known for their bar program and the drinks certainly lived up to the hype (I had a non-alcoholic pomegranate spritzer and she had the Shirley Temple).  We came for dinner and the overall experience was mixed:\n\n(1). Charcuterie plate (4/5) - we chose the chef's selection of 4 and it included liver mousse (excellent), chicken pate (basically chicken spam), pancetta (lardo), salami and pickled vegetables.  I am a big fan of the liver mousse.  Note that chef's  selection means no substitutions. \n\n(2). Kabocha Squash Griddle Cake (3/5) - this was OK but I couldn't really taste the Japanese squash. The chanterelles were excellent. \n\n(3). Fideo (5/5) - this was surprisingly good. The spaghetti was perfectly al dente and the bread was the perfect consomm\u00e9 soaking device. \n\n(4). Roast Chicken (3/5) - this was very moist but was a bit too salty for me. The cauliflower was OK but would have better roasted.  \n\n(5). Lemon Tart (3/5) - nice simple dessert. \n\nService was good and the restaurant itself was very impressive. It's a bit on the expensive side - with tax and tip and two drinks, this was about $125 per person. Overall, I think it's a 3.5 rating but given the price, I probably expected a more elevated experience.", "author": "Andrew S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-12-17", "description": "NOTE: This review is only for the bar.\n\nI had requested a nightcap after dinner, so towards the end of our dinner the No1DP was searching Google for a bar with an excellent bar program. Though we both like a good cocktail, his tastes are quite different from mine so he suggested a bar that I wouldn't have thought otherwise. He got this off a list that I myself would also go by (and my suggestion was actually placed higher) but his rationale is that Bar Agricole was ranked as a finalist for James Beard's Outstanding Bar Program every year since 2012. \n\nThe restaurant has a small sign that denotes its entrance. It's a little hard to find at night, especially since the restaurant is sectioned off into two parts: the heated patio outside and the restaurant/bar portion inside. There's a wheelchair-accessible ramp next to the stairs and a coat check right next to the entrance of the inside portion.\n\nWe were immediately sat at the bar upon request and were greeted by our bartender Christopher. He has been a bartender here for about 3 years and shows great passion for his craft. Considering he was making our drinks in front of us he exuded an air of confidence as he mixed our drinks, explaining the process of what goes on behind each step.\n\nI ordered on the menu a Brandy Milk Punch (with Jamaican rum, whole egg and nutmeg, $13). I saw Christopher crack a whole egg into my drink, a distinction of a flip cocktail and mixed quite well. The result is quite a slightly sweet, smooth yet potent cocktail that I don't encounter quite often. The thing about pre-prohibition cocktails are that they are to be sipped as opposed to chugged and when done correctly, make the drinker feel more mellow. Considering I usually drink my mules and spicy margaritas fast, it was a new experience for me to drink a sipping cocktail. Luckily I had a good night's sleep.\n\nNo1DP got a off-menu cocktail. Not sure what the base liquor was but the main bitter was Varnelli Amaro Dell'Erborista. This bitter is made with herbs from Central Italy along with the honey used to sweeten the bitter, which is made using the bees that also pollinate the herbs. No1DP loves his bitter cocktails so he appreciated the subtle nuances of bitter and sweet. \n\nI wish we had known about the restaurant portion because the No1DP was impressed with the dishes he briefly saw. Unfortunately it's closed on Sundays so we aren't able to make a subsequent dinner reservation. However this is definitely on my list of restaurants to come back to next time we're both in SF.", "author": "Isabella B."}

Nothing to knock your socks off but definitely enjoyable. \n\nOne of our main courses came out before our starter...that's a basic no-no. Part of dining out and paying to have a meal out is the experience. We got a starter, an entree, and another starter all within 10 mins of each other. One of the waitresses literally attempted to take away a dish we were still eating off of...I've worked in restaurants and basic training is to never touch a dish without asking if they're finished or okay to take. \n\nNot a single person asked us how our drinks or any of the food was. It was bland and horrifically overpriced. Aka $21 for a couple pieces of flatbread with some pur\u00e9ed beets and a half a teaspoon of ricotta.\n\nWere told we would have a table outside (where there was beautiful live music!) but was sat at a table too close by to the next table where I learned about our dining neighbor's entire affair. Lovely. \n\nSafe to say that date night here was a total bummer and we would never ever return nor recommend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2017-08-30", "description": "I'd been to Bar Agricole before when the service charge was built into the prices and wasn't terribly impressed with the food or the entire experience. So much so, in fact, that I couldn't remember much about it. Now that they've moved back to a standard tipping model, I decided to give them another shot.\n\nThe bartender was professional enough, although a bit transactional in that she knew exactly what she was doing in trying to sell more items to me, the customer. I know it's good business, but I can also see right through it. Although she may have had a point in suggesting a side of potatoes to go along with the Bar Agricole burger (Stemple Creek beef with wagon wheel cheese, oven-roasted shallots, and chive aioli). Even though it was fairly tasty - you could clearly tell it was a nice piece of beef - it was also quite modestly sized. The potatoes, however, were nicely portioned, although like the burger they were just a tad spendy given that service is no longer baked into the prices. \n\nThe cocktails, while again being just a tad spendy (this is the West Bay, after all) were somewhat decent, whether the whiz-bang (Scotch whisky, dry vermouth, grenadine and absinthe) or the dark rum swizzle (Demerara and overproof rums, lime and sugar).\n\nPerhaps the best thing about Bar Agricole is the gorgeous venue. Outside, there's an immaculate, contemporary, semi-shaded patio (complete with a soothing water feature) that's absolutely glorious when it's warm out, but predictably frigid when foggy. Inside, a light fixture that's too modern to be called a chandelier graces the dining room, which has a bar area as well as large, yet intimate, booths. A nice venue for a date you want to impress, or for a business dinner where you need some privacy.", "author": "Vincent L."}

The other couple had checked in already. The host was expecting us and I learned that we could choose from inside or the last 4 outside seats. Outside sounded great.\n\nSo we were ushered outside to the end of a long table that could have been a community table  - but wasn't really being used that way. It was odd...is it or isn't it? There are some great benefits to a true community table and I've had many lovely meals with strangers - but you kind of all have to be on the same page. Either you're in or you're out. Ah well...let's see how this plays out.\n\nOur friends had gotten drinks at the bar, but obviously we hadn't. So we chatted and waited and waited and chatted...and okay now it's been 20 minutes and no one has even approached us. I got a tip off as I saw someone from the very very far end of our is-it-a-community-table get up and walk over to the server station to let them know they were ready to order. Hmm. So we finally flag someone down to ask if we can order drinks, and they take our order. Almost 15 min later the drinks arrived. So if you're keeping time, that's 35 minutes from sitting to getting our drinks. And by the way - it's not that busy on this Thursday evening.\n\nOkay - on to ordering. It took a while for someone to come back to take our order - to be fair, we were definitely chatting amongst ourselves a lot - but I do feel it's a good thing to check in with people sooner rather than later to see if we're interested in ordering. Maybe they were confused and thought we did order, since the 4 people next to us started to have their food delivered and they tried to give us one of their dishes (remember? Is it or isn't it a community table?).\n\nFinally ordered and got the choripan (chorizo) and grilled flatbread appetizers, the cavatelli, the chicken, the burger and the ginger and tumeric farinata. The food was good. Great? No. But better than fine. So \"good\" is appropriate. And back to the drinks a minute. There are some interesting mixed drink concoctions - we got a dark rum swizzle and a Mary Pickford and a vodka & soda and an old fashioned, etc. - but with all that hipster-ness, no craft beer selection. One IPA. Yikes.\n\nLook, the servers were nice but not particularly personable, the food was good but not terrific, the atmosphere is lovely enough, but confusing (ie community table) - this level of restaurant requires keen attention to timing. That's just a basic necessity as groundwork to then build your ability to stand out.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-06-14", "description": "I seldom leave restaurant reviews but the abysmal quality of Bar Agricole's service compelled me to post this. As other reviewers have mentioned, the food is fine (if expensive), the cocktail selection is lovely, and the ambiance is great. We sat outside under comfortable heat lamps in their attractive courtyard. It was cozy and quiet enough to carry on conversations easily -- one perk of their low yelp rating is it never seems to be very crowded. Everything we ordered (blackened cod, pappardelle, acme bread with cultured butter, to name a few) was well-prepared and enjoyable. The problem, as I said, was the service. It was slow as molasses but also just simply disorganized, haphazard and without any rhyme or reason. Our server wasn't rude or anything, and he clearly wasn't overwhelmed by too much work; he just had no idea how to do his job. My wine order took 10 minutes to get filled -- same with my second glass half way through the meal. One person's drink would arrive first, and then the other's (ordered at the same time) would mysteriously not appear until 15 minutes later. Two friends arrived a bit later after we were seated, and nobody asked them if they wanted drinks for 15 minutes. There was a 45 minute lag between our finishing our appetizers and receiving our mains with zero management of our expectations. Then finally, after a pretty shoddy experience we ordered an ice cream dessert that came, I guess, with 3 cookies. There were 4 of us. When the waiter arrived with the dish he told us he had thrown in an extra cookie, which we appreciated and thought was a nice touch to make amends for the poor service thus far. We were wrong. Once we saw the bill we realized that not only had we not been comped the extra cookie (which would have been the proper thing to do, or he should have asked us before if we wanted an extra) but we were charged more for that one cookie than the unit price of the other three! Just ridiculous. They should really train their staff. The place has potential but at this rate it won't last.", "author": "Chiara P."}

It came in a frosty 12 oz glass and accompanied by a charming story about the husband, wife and goat that make it, but he reported that the beer itself was \"meh.\"  The bartender warned me that the drink I ordered was \"alcohol-forward\" by which I assume he meant too strong for the likes of me, which was probably right and he suggested something else, which was good, but not amazing for the price/size.\n\nEventually the oysters came. They were TINY, which is not, I suppose unusual for happy hour oysters, although these were some of the most miniscule I have ever seen --ok that's one thing, but as soon as we tasted them, both my husband and I looked at each other and wondered if they had somehow gotten frozen as they were both a bit mealy textured/watery, and had absolutely no flavor.

I had to take points off because when we were ordering the dessert we asked about the fromage blanc with Armagnac, asking if the disk was cooked so the alcohol would burn off, since one person in our party can't drink. The waitress didn't seem to understand why having any alcohol would be an issue just saying \"it won't get you drunk\" but she said she would bring the Armagnac on the side so we could add it in if we wanted. Then what came out was the cheese with Armagnac in it but the prunes on the side? Kind of weird. And the dish tasted pretty strongly of alcohol so it definitely wasn't burned off.

I also believe that \"mistakes happen\", but our experience went beyond one simple mistake. Here's what happened:\n\nThere were 6 of us paying, and the bill came to approx. $540, including tip. We each pitched in $87 per card. When the slips came back, we were each charged .84 (yes, that's cents, and not even .87 cents!). Rather then risk bad karma, we alerted the staff that we had been *undercharged*. They reran the cards, and we signed them. The next evening, I checked my bank account to find they had ran my card for $520.00(!), which overdrew my account. I called them immediately--no one answered and no one bothered to respond to my message. I had 30 minutes to get all the way back to the resto to ask that they refund me over $400 dollars. \n\nI had to sit and wait 10+ minutes for this to be sorted out. I was not comp'd for the incompetence that I experienced, nor the inconvenience of racing down there on a Sunday night before they closed. i was not offered a drink while I waited. I left with the exact overage I was owed and very pissed off. From a resto that commands such a high price point, this was not a terribly classy response.\n\nAs for the actual service, I ordered a cocktail which did not arrive until we'd pretty much finished our meal, and the Farinata was soggy and oily. I don't know how Bar Agricole obtained their reputation, but it has since gone downhill in service and in quality. If you ignore the negative reviews and decide to go anyway, stick with a cocktail at the bar, and double check your debit/credit card!", "author": "Pamela A."}

This usually happens when a menu has so many tempting options, but at Bar Agricole, it was because nothing looked all that exciting and didn't look to be enough food. The egg dishes were $16+, which is typical of SF, but were very small and seemed a bit incomplete. None of the dishes had meat or cheese. Call me a gluttonous American, but I wanted something heartier. \n\nI ended up choosing the fried eggs and farinata.

Woke up late and went to run some errands before hand in Richmond and felt a bit sweaty, weather is super warm this part of the year, so many joggers on the road, 3.3 mile across town and my brain already turned into mush. Such was how I started my day on Sunday. Surprisingly mellow atmosphere that offers a great deal of cocktails - it is a 2015 James Beard winner for cocktails spot. Decidedly simple but to the point brunch menu. Radish with salt and butter reminded me of France. Scone with honey butter was not only tasty but a bit too decadent. Girlfriends are dashingly stylish. I bear gifts. I was happy that they were liking these Parisian style scarves I got for them. \n\nWaitstaff are hipsters straight out of Portlandia, they offer water in a jar and coffee strong and black. All refilled seamlessly. Having just returned from Norway, where labors are hard to find and people are used to waiting for a long periods of time before getting served, it's nice to know that this society is still a service oriented society.\n\nWe ordered the egg dishes - baked and fried. Delicious.\n\nNo one is rushing us so we spent nearly 3 hours catching up. It's been over 8 weeks, so much has happened. One girlfriend is dreading her upcoming line dance for her son's school's fund raising, one girlfriend is battling raccoons in her newly purchased multi million dollar home, one girlfriend is getting all the permits pulled and getting ready to sell her Marin home, I'm too busy fingering out what time of the day it is and what time zone I'm at to notice that I've got a big o' stain on the front of my dress.\n\nPerfect afternoon brunch place. Well cooked eggs.\n\nFrench toast as dessert, completely unnecessary but totally worth it nonetheless.\n\nMaking plans for an autumn get away to the wine country. \n\nI take photos and put them on instagram and FB. They all look million bucks. Some of us, thankfully, age gracefully and beautifully, so much so that they cause envy among their peers. I love my lady friends who love to dine in posh places like this.\n\nI get the wait staff to recommend a cocktail that would rock my world towards the end. It was made of Jamaican rum and is James Beard worthy.\n\nI'm reminded by my friend's parting words earlier, \"Have fun with your girlfriends, but don't have too much fun.\" How could I not?!", "author": "Victoria E."}

Although the food isn't bad, the portion sizes are rather small for the price. The king salmon tartare ($12) featured a meager heap of salmon and 3 small endive leaves, and the soft-boiled eggs ($11) consisted of 3 half-eggs, each topped with a tiny piece of cod. The preparations were rather simple, and the ingredients themselves did not stand out in terms of freshness or taste. \n\nThat being said, our server was friendly and engaging, coming by frequently to check on our table.

Score! \n\nStood/half sat at the full bar after starting out our night sipping wines at Tank18 and Jamber. Switched up after dinner to cocktails, and had pleasant service with Chris, our informative bartender!\n\nHe custom-made two drinks for us, while my other girlfriend got a specialty cocktail on the menu. I thoroughly enjoyed my tequila fix which was citrus-y and a tad spicy with some type of chile bitters. It was a basic lime juice and tequile drink with the special bitters that got my approval. Ambiance is great, the more I stood at the bar and got a chance to look around. I loved the outdoors section--but it was reserved for a private party...great use of space! I also liked the sleek and modern/dim lighting of the area. They had different levels of sections, so it made it seem like you're underground in some seating areas, or up in a loft as in the case with the bar.\n\nWe only had one drink here because our friend was hoping to see someone she knew who worked at the bar, but that person wasn't working that day. This place isn't my vibe exactly (a bit fancier), and I saw mostly yuppies in casual suits as well as an older 30's crowd at the bar/sitting to enjoy dinner.

Since I was a driver and was looking for a parking spot, I was last to the table.  The seating arrangements did not allow for more than 12 and as a result a co-worker and I were put at the pointed corner of the table.  I was not able to push my chair in far enough and as a result felt like I was going to drop food in my lap all night.  \n\nWe had a pre-fixed meal that was served family style.  However, due to the way the tables were pushed together it made it tough to get the food when the neighboring person was engaged in conversation.  There were many dishes that were served, but the best was the cranberry beans with rabini.  The main proteins were pork, that was so rare it was tough to cut, and a bodega bay white fish that was just average.\n\nThey did have an open bar as part of the charges.  While I don't drink, people at the table seemed to enjoy what was being served.  \n\nWhile I know it is not the restaurant's fault for parking issues in the city, be prepared to circle the block many times in order to find a place.  \n\nI have no idea what the cost of the dinner was, but I presume that for the cost, the organization of the tables should have been better to allow people to be more comfortable.  It is also OK to tell people 'no, we just cannot accommodate that change based on our layout.'  The food was decent, but nothing that made me want to come back and eat that again.  \n\nWhat did I learn today?  The homeless guy at the parking lot poses as a lot attendant.  Don't pay him.

Not I. However, with a upcoming 3-day weekend, and a James Beard Nominee for Outstanding Bar Program, I thought what better way to get smashed but to get smashed on SF's finest cocktails at Bar Agricole.\n\nI had my plan all lined up, start with lights then proceed onto darks (all cocktails are $12). So the Mary Pickford (rum, pineapple gum, grenadine, lime & maraska) was my first poison of choice: http://bit.ly/1r7umwu. One sip and wooooweeee, it was strong but balanced and bright. Half way through, I whispered to my friend across the table who had the same cocktail: \"Do you feel it?\" He looked at me crazily. I guess he don't feel it. So then I whispered to Mr. NSS next to me, \"Do you feel it?...I feel it!\" He too looked at me crazily (he doesn't drink alkie). \n\nAs I was about to order another, I got flashbacks of our partying heydays: jumping on couches, face-planting onto bottle service tables, passing out at Lucky Penny's, and coming home with no shoes and one whorelash hanging on for dear life. I looked around our table of 12 and nobody seemed to be feeling it. Awww, we're all grown up now (I'm 90% there) and half the table is engaged. Then, I looked around at the other tables. Total civility. Umm yah, I probably should skip on additional cocktails for the sake of not embarrassing my friends and getting escorted out by management...during brunch. Save the ratchetness for after midnight. \n\nAs you could see, Bar Agricole's cocktails are buzztastic and worth every penny so it's no surprise that their bar program is a James Beard Nominee. 5 stars for their cocktails. \n\nI wish I could say the same about their food. My gf was visiting from Texas for the weekend so we planned a group brunch for her. For parties more than 10, there's a set menu with dishes shared family style for $35 pp ($58 pp including tax, healthy sf tax & 20% auto-gratuity). For each no-show, they will charge you $35. Bar Agricole's menu changes daily so what you see online is unlikely to be available the day you go. \n\nBRUNCH MENU: http://bit.ly/1mEbukK\n*Appetizer courses: melons, elderberry scones, radish & rye bread, and flatbread w/ smoked salmon cream cheese: http://bit.ly/1mEc95u\n*Savory courses: baked eggs w/ blacked eyed peas, ham & goat cheese, new potatoes, butter lettuce salad, grilled cheese sammie w/ rapini, and scrambled eggs w/ salmon: http://bit.ly/1paE7az\n*Dessert:\n--French toast w/ peaches, basil, honey butter & walnuts: http://bit.ly/WCSVZg\n--Vanilla & Peach Ice Cream w/ strawberries: http://bit.ly/1nfqI4D\n\nWhile I appreciate the value of the 11 course brunch, the menu sounded much better than how the presented dishes looked and tasted. Collectively, everything was mediocre and were standard items I could find at a breakfast buffet. Personally, I would have preferred several really solid and more creative dishes rather than 11 plain jane dishes with \"filler\" courses (read: hella carbs). A plate of radishes with 2 halved slices of rye bread? Really?! This is a Nouvelle American restaurant no? If you're a meat eater, you will be disappointed because I think we each had 2-one cm of ham from the baked eggs dish.\n\nMaybe the food was better when Brandon Jew was in the kitchen? *shrugs*\n\nService was awesome though so rounding up to 4 stars. I coordinated our large party brunch through their event manager, Ben who was professional and responsive. The staff was very attentive and made sure to clear out plates quickly and keep our water glasses filled. Food service was timely and there wasn't a long lag between courses as you would usually experience with a large group. \n\nBar Agricole is structurally a beautiful restaurant that's contemporary and minimalist in decor. We sat in the outdoor patio which was perfect for brunch and to enjoy the cool summer breeze.\n\nParking is super easy on the weekdays and on the weekends before 8 pm (central to clubs and bars) which makes it a good option for large group meal.\n\nI was hoping that brunch at Bar Agricole would be enticing enough to warrant a visit back for dinner but unfortunately, it's not a place I would come back to eat. But to drink? I already have a plan lined up...\n\nPre-fade at Bar Agricole then head over to Bootie next door to dance on the stage then finish the night face-planting into slice of pizza at DNA pizza (open 24/7).

We didn't have reservations and started with a group of three people. (Yes, we were the annoying table that kept growing!) They kindly sat us outside at a table for four to start. Later on we became a group of five and then a group of seven. The restaurant was nice enough to pull up the table next to us to make room for all the extra people. We ordered:\n\nDrinks: $11 each\n-'Ti punch - with rhum agricole, cane syrup and lime peel\n-Planter's punch - with white agricole, lime, grenadine, grapefruit and bitters\n-Sleepyhead - brandy, ginger, mint, lime, sparkling wine\n-Whiz bang - scotch, vermouth, grenadine, absinthe, bitters\n-Hallelujah - armagnac, aged agricole, vermouth, grenadine, bar spoon lime\n\nI've never been much of a cocktail person myself since I don't know much about mixing flavors of alcohols, etc, but the bartenders here are masters! The way all the ingredients complimented each other to make a finely crafted cocktail that wasn't too sweet and packed a small punch. I was in cocktail heaven!\n\nWe ordered food as well since we spent a good amount of hours there as we added people to our party. We ended up ordering:\n\n-Grilled flatbread with smashed English peas herb salad ($12)\n-Pork Pate with fennel, radish, little gem lettuces & whole grain mustard ($12)\n-Wild arugula and endive salad with kumquats ($9)\n-Manila clams with fregola sarda, green garlic, wild nettles and fennel ($14 small portion)\n-Whole wheat bigoli with spinach, green garlic and anchovies ($12 small portion)\n-Roast duck breast with rutabaga, castelfranco, yogurt and dukkah ($37 large portion)\n-Farinata with maitake, white beech mushrooms and a chrysanthemum salad ($20)\n-Roast pork loin with bintje potatoes, mustard greens and horseradish salsa verde ($38 large portion)\n\nThe food was okay. Basically there was one element of each dish I enjoyed, but as a whole, most of the dishes didn't gel for me. For example, with the grilled flatbread,  my favorite part was the English smash peas, not the flatbread. And for the pate, I enjoyed the salad that came with it, not necessarily the pate.

ANYTHING?\n\nBar Agricole is one such place. I was fortunate that bartender extraordinaire Eric Johnson was on helm the night I came in. I didn't realize I was at the hands of the master until I came home and did a bit of research on him. (some people go gaga over star chefs, but not me!) \n\nHe gave us the spiel, primarily about agricole because most of my rum experiences are limited to mojitos and fruity drinks with umbrellas. None of that here, rum cocktails dominate the menu and are as elegant as can be. Try the Planter's Punch with white agricole, grapefruit, lime and grenadine. The faint pink color makes for a pretty cocktail too!\n\nFor the first time ever, I had an old fashioned with gin! It was knock my socks off delicious and it makes sense since they use local powerhouse distillery St. George. Their house old fashioned is different as well.  While everyone else in this drinking town use bourbon or whiskey, they do a single cask cognac here. And last but not the least, a boozy but balanced Whiz Bang to round out the night. \n\nAll that drinking will make you hungry, we ate beforehand but snacked on their savory bread pudding and chicken liver mousse. Both appetizing, but pricey.\n\nIf the food and drinks don't wow you (are you dead?!) the design will.  The SOMA neighborhood is primarily industrial and it's really nice to have this minimalist modern, but warm restaurant to cool your heels in. Their space is massive and even has an outdoor courtyard area complete with a raised herb garden. The interior of the restaurant feels open with its high ceilings, but is intimate because of the wooden hull hanging form the ceiling, which is made from recycled whiskey barrels. The delicate glass sculptures suspended around the skylights adds a touch of whimsy into the space.\n\nIf there's anything more that I love than having a well crafted cocktail, it's drinking one in such a darling atmosphere. \n\nYou'd be sure to find me on the regular here.", "author": "Janice C."}

Delicious food, fantastic cocktails and a wonderful staff make Bar Agricole a great restaurant, but it's expensive (or I'm poor). I get it, though. It's San Francisco and the space is big (one of the good things about it), so rent's gotta be a killer, but I still spent a fortune and left not feeling completely full. \n\nThe staff here is exceptional. They accommodated a wheelchaired family member and went out of their way to be nice to him. I appreciated that more than anything. They are all ready to swoop in and replace your plates with new ones and fill your pitcher of water. The staff are also knowledgeable about the menu and made excellent recommendations. \n\nThe restaurant itself is quite spacious and this was another thing that I really appreciated. In SF, you get stuck being elbow to elbow with the tables next to you, all while shelling out hundreds of dollars. To me, that's not a fun experience, especially when the conversations you overhear all involve money, apps, venture capital firms and startups, and even worse when they're about creepy personal discussions. But at Bar Agricole, there are private booths and the non-booth tables aren't stacked on top of each other so you don't have to be forced to listen to someone's bad Tinder date.\n\nBut y'alls only care about the food so here it is. The food's great. We had oysters, the chicken toast (a personal fave), two different salads (both very good), the Halibut (cooked to perfection) and the pork belly (some pieces were better than others but still a good dish) and lots of cocktails. The portions are pretty small even though they claim it's family style. Or maybe we need to stop being fatties and demanding Denny's-style portions? I liked the food a lot but still felt like I could've stuffed another burrito in my mouth. The cocktails are really their standout (they cost around $12 so expensive but standard SF). \n\nThe meal for 4 people came out to something like $250 pre-tip, so it's quite expensive for my pocketbook, maybe not as expensive for you deep pocketed Yelpers.

Was it something I said, Brandon? Actually Jamie W. and I didn't come here to eat since we just finished dinner at the new Sri Lankan SoMa eatery, 1601 Bar & Kitchen (review: http://bit.ly/HRbxgN). Besides, Michael Bauer said this place had lost its foodie mojo ever since Jew left earlier this year and the freshly promoted sous chef had not found his footing yet. Now it could be a bunch of Bauer ballsac for all I know, but we did know that the consistent hallmark in Bar Agricole lies in its vaunted cocktail menu. With this, Jamie and I both heartily agree.\n\nThe place is quite a scene no matter what hour you show up in the evening, even though we were reassured by the hostess that the bulk of the bar crowd would be seated soon. Never happened. The bar was two deep most of the time we were there, and we could only manage a bit of space at the very end of the bar near the stairwell to the kitchen (photo: http://bit.ly/1hBRHWv). All the seats were taken, and no one looked ready to leave. No matter since the bartender treated us with respect. The attentiveness was what  impressed me about the service here. Considering the douche factor could be astronomical at a place this popular, I think they show exemplary grace under pressure (photo: http://bit.ly/1aQfDSj).\n\nAll cocktails are a flat $11, so that ironically made the choice harder. Jamie went for the smooth-as-silk 'Ti Punch, a tropical concoction with rhum agricole, cane syrup and lime peel (photo: http://bit.ly/19Znivu). Mine was the puckery-good Planter's Punch which consisted of white agricole, lime, grenadine, grapefruit and bitters (photo: http://bit.ly/19fMfOU). Both drinks were just the refreshing after-dinner libation that we wanted. We scanned the noisy interior to see what people were eating (photo: http://bit.ly/1fxXVCj). We saw the $80 Whole Roast Duck pass by, and it looked luscious. But $80...sheesh. The rest of the menu looks pretty appetizing, so I'm sure I'll give it a go once I find my own footing which at my age could be quite a while.\n\nCOCKTAILS - 4 stars...lovely libations most fitting for after dinner\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a bit of a scene and quite noisy\nSERVICE - 4 stars...no complaints about the bartender, they're aces\nTOTAL - 4 stars...come here for the food (as if I knew), stay for the drinks", "author": "Ed U."}

It's a good looking spot, with both inside and outside dining... solid cocktails and no complaints there.  The food though, I just don't know what happened, it's just not done with the same passion as the cocktails.  I lack the motivation to go through each plate from last night, of which there were five... but we'll use the Roast Chicken as the example.  When I asked if it's always that salty, the answer was yes, it's brined.  So that's the reason, but I'm not sure that's an excuse...  you can have brined and tasty.

Let's start with the food -\n\nWe were sat down promptly and we were very happy as it was not crowded at all. Our server Kristen came by promptly. Explained the menu and everything was set. We all knew what we wanted and then she disappeared for a bit. I know she must have gotten busy. But no service for 15 mins, the server has already lost points. I specifically asked her about a particular dessert and she said that she will hold one for me right away. When two from our group wanted to order the duck she said it was out and was replaced with some other meat. Well maybe the chef should prepare a little bit more? \n\nThe food was ok. Literally. There are a lot of other restaurants in the city serving way more delicious dishes for the price that bar agricole charges. The portions were a disaster. The small portion pasta is probably good for a kid. The server had mentioned to one of the guest that she should get the small portion. Well, she was still hungry at the end of the meal. My fish dish had five tiny pieces of the cod and more beans. It almost felt like I had ordered a bean stew that was garnished with some fish on top. $30 for that. Chef, what's up? Cost control eh? \n\nNow to the service -\n\nWell the server already had lost points in the beginning. We wanted to order some more food but she never showed up until the plates were cleared up. She came with the dessert menu and told me the chocolate tart was already over. I laughed. She said, \"thank you for your flexibility\". The menu itself is so small. How can you not stock your kitchen? She brought in a plate of cookies as a kind gesture. Which was nice of her. But then, she dropped the check with a 20% gratuity added to the check. I know that federal law states that you cannot add automatic gratuity to any checks. Doesn't matter how big the party is. This has been in practice since January 2013. Well this explained why she had disappeared and didn't pay much attention to our table. We of course gave her the 20% tip. We would have had anyways. \n\nWill never go back and will never recommend.

It was like being on an emotional rollercoaster - first, I had sticker shock upon seeing a $24 price tag for a small dish of fried eggs and pork shoulder, and $5 for a plain cup of oolong tea. Then, felt a wave of relief that tip and tax was included so the total price ended up being $30 for an entree and a drink. By the end of the meal my reference point for what a reasonably priced nice brunch meal was totally off-center. The service was friendly and quick, and I loved that you could make a reservation easily. At 12:30PM on a Saturday, there was no line and plenty of tables. They have a beautiful outdoor patio *perfect* for an al fresco brunch on a nice SF morning.\n\nOverall, delicious but pricey brunch. 4 stars for food, 2 stars for value. 3.5 overall stars. Would return again for dinner!\n\n* FRIED EGGS WITH MEATBALLS (3.5 STARS) - $24:\nFried eggs with chimmichurri sauce, on top of a bed of chickpeas and meatballs.\nThis dish was well executed, there was a nice crunchy sear on the edge of the eggs, but I was expecting to be more blown away by the meatballs since there were only two medium sized meatballs in this pricey dish. Good, but preferred the pork shoulder.\n\n* BAKED EGGS AND PORK SHOULDER (4 STARS) - $24:\nThis dish came out steaming, with probably 3.5-4oz of pork shoulder in a savory sauce and baked eggs with runny yolks. Definitely a soul warming and satisfying meal. They were kind enough to bring out a few slices of their complimentary dinner bread toasted so we could dip it in the leftover sauce.\n\n* OOLONG TEA (3 STARS) - $5:\nStandard.\n\n* FOUR BARREL COFFEE (3 STARS) - $5:\nA bit watery but unlimited pours.", "author": "Jess C."}

To start with the welcome from the maitre d' was unfriendly and stern. The menu was a little confusing, our vegetable side dishes came out before our starter. The main issue was the overall quality of the food. The charcuterie plate, which was around $28, was extremely pithy and and lackluster. I ordered the salmon, which when it came, looked like something I could have thrown together myself at home. Basically, rice, salmon and a couple of leaves, that was it. There wasn't any attention the presentation, it was as basic as it sounds. I understand that the salmon was organic etc but this was, by other restaurant standards, a very basic plate of food and for the price of $28 I would expect a lot more. None of what we ate was that good, we didn't talk about the food at all and I didn't take any photographs of the food because it was so obvious how bad it was. My husband and I were hosting some friends of our parents who had arrived for a vacation and quite frankly I felt embarrassed and sorry for them that this was their first experience of eating in San Francisco.

It's a nice ambience, with expecially cool tubular chandeliers, and the food is capital-F Fine, but hardly groundbreaking or revelatory. That was actually part of the reason I chose to dine there with my parents, who were visiting from Florida. The menu, with its chicken and hamburger and spaghetti, seemed like it would give them a classy spin on dishes that already resonated with them, and by and large, the food faithfully served that purpose. (though if you're going to serve a burger, forcing diners to order fries a la carte or be stuck with a pickled carrot is a little precious) This would be a solid 4-star review if not for the treatment of my provincial redneck hicktown family by one of the service staff. I've been stewing on this for a day, and it kinda keeps bothering me, so I'll share. We arrived a little early to catch the end of happy hour (or \"apertif hour\" in BA parlance. See? Precious) and were presented with a menu of vermouth-and-bitters-based cocktails. My mother, bless her, has no idea what aperol or camapri or benedictine or fernet is, and has likely never had vermouth outside of a martini. She asked the staff member which of the cocktails was most like her go-to, a gin and tonic, and was rebuffed with, \"Well, none of these have high-proof spirits, and a gin and tonic kind of has no flavor, so. . . \" This trail-off is not for dramatic effect, it's just the way the unhelpful, snide blurb ended. Look, I get that we're rubes compared to the desired clientele, overweight and under-dressed eating at 6 PM like we have to plow the back 40 tomorrow morning, but c'mon; my mom was embarrassed and made to feel small by this curt dismissal of her request for a drink recommendation, and that's hardly what good service is about.

The local cod was baked to perfection but was totally devoid of flavor. The saffron aioli that accompanied it looked pretty but did nothing to improve the flavor. Then, the arugula salad was just a bunch of arugula plopped on the plate with an assertive salty dressing. Plain terrible. Go there for drinks if you want to be hip but go elsewhere for food.", "author": "Cathy Q."}

Had some trouble making reservation as system told me no tables for one, but they had tables for two - so why no room for one? Took a few emails to resolve.\n\nOrdered a cocktail, chicory salad, huckleberry scones with honey butter, eggs with black trumpet mushrooms, black tea. Had not planned vegetarian meal, just worked out that way.\n\nCocktail, fine. Salad, fine. Scones, to die for, ordered more! Eggs, really good, had I think something added to the egg, not cheese, but tasted rich. Maybe just used extra yolks? Came with more chicory! Had I realized I would have ordered a different first course. \n\nOn arrival, given shot glass of raspberry shrub, non-alcoholic, really good, would not have minded a full sized glass. Then the wait person brought me a complementary glass of wine as an apology for reservation problems.  I'd already had a cocktail - and I am a one drink person! Needed a second pot of strong black tea. I thought that was a nice gesture.\n\nA few glitches, tea took too long to arrive, as they have only recently added brunch, service, while friendly, has not gotten all the bugs out. \n\nAnd no dessert menu!!! I can see they maybe don't want to keep a pastry chef on hand for brunch, at least yet. But even places that have no regular dessert menu can rustle up a bowl of ice cream. The other wait person suggested French toast from main menu. Not my idea of dessert. Then he suggested ricotta doughnuts with orange marmalade. Not what I would have picked, but they were good, light and crisp, very good marmalade. I finished what was left in the dish on a finger, which was probably the effect of that second drink.\n\nPlan to go back and try dinner, later in the year.", "author": "Carol S."}

She is an interior designer and we both loved the clean and modern decor. The interior is very spacious, with a downstairs seating area and also an outdoor patio area. LOVED the elegant bathroom too! The upscale but casual ambiance was the perfect setting for a dinner with one of your BFFs.\n\nWe both were in the beer mood and had the Eel River IPA (well priced at $4!) Wanted to try one of the $11 cocktails but didn't see any with my preferred spirit (vodka). For an app, we had the smoked trout devilled eggs with scallion and caviar. Really yummy. We split the braised pork shoulder with risotto entree, and a side of broccoli. The entree was quite big enough for the two of us and had great flavors! I'm a big fan of broccoli and it was delicious too. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake with Meyer lemon. Its texture was almost like cheesecake and a great end to our meal.\n\nI loved this place! The service was excellent from everyone... the host, the bartender and our server. I liked the denim napkins too :) They wiped the table down between courses and changed silverware (nice touch) and their timing was great with everything. I will be back!!!", "author": "Wendy N."}

We sat outside on a chilly night and the heaters made us all feel like rotisserie chickens--very hot on the top of our heads, but chilly in our southern regions. Our main complaint had to do with the professionalism of the service. It wasn't easy and smooth. The biggest thing had to do with ordering a third bottle of wine to go with the meat we'd ordered after sharing apps. We waited a full 20 minutes for that red wine, at which time they arrived with the wrong bottle. Our hamburgers were cold. They were also raw inside. By the time we got the wine, the cheese was clammy and congealed. When we mentioned the error to the server, he was defensive--\"It wasn't my fault,\" which really isn't the right response. I don't care who messed up, just say you're sorry and you'll get our wine glasses filled tout suite and things will go more smoothly than basically starting an argument. The bar tried to make it up with a free after-dinner drink, but the spell had been broken. I guess I would come back, and I get that service is tough in SF, but I'm not keen on this place.", "author": "Laura F."}

People of course said the venue was beautiful, but they LOVED Seth.\n\nThe food was also good. You have to be a little relaxed about the menu as it changes daily and we weren't able to review the food choices in advance.

The recessed lighting was also a nice touch.\n\nSplit the spaghetti -- not because the portion was large, it was quite small actually for the price, but because we'd eaten a bit before then.  The menu describes it as: spaghetti with razor clams, parsley, green garlic, and buddha hand citron.\n\nAlthough not my usual type of pasta (I love my tomato sauce), it was delicious.  Perfectly cooked to a nice al dente, clams also perfectly cooked, and the ingredients that were on the pasta (parsley, green garlic etc) were subtle but expertly flavorful.

But seriously, the plates were monstrously large.)\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn't try the hazelnut cake or the pancakes (I'm allergic to nuts), but the presentation was lovely and everyone else seemed to enjoy them a lot. The shining stars for me were really the eggs. The scrambled eggs (with potatoes, crispy ciccioli and scallions) were so moist and yummy, they practically melt in your mouth.

Service was cutesy but inattentive.  One of the front-of-house guys slammed down a late-arriving glass of wine on the table long after the appropriate course was gone.  The main server didn't really care.  I usually don't care about this kind of stuff, but these guys are SUPER clear that they're not Appleby's.  The menu is as inscrutable as it gets, as is its tiny by-the-glass wine list.  So, I'm particularly annoyed by the awful service.\n\nI got the vibe of a badly-managed place, or at least one with an abiding arrogance and utter disregard for patrons.  And despite having worked in service before, I do not buy into its \"service included\" pricing.  The only way I can voice my disdain is passive-aggressively through yelp.  There was no manager around to gripe to.

I made a note on the reservation that it was a party of two and both of us were celebrating birthdays, requesting a quieter table. Instead, we were seated 5-10 minutes after our 8 p.m. reservation and at a table in the middle of a drafty walkway where people kept bumping into us. After inquiring about a better table, we were told that it might be another 5-10 minutes if we wanted to wait. We didn't. The table next to us was probably six inches away and engaged in a very lively, boisterous conversation. This was not the \"quieter\" table I had envisioned for our birthday dinners. \n\nThe food was tasty and cocktails were phenomenal. However, we thought the beet appetizer was too salty and we couldn't figure out a good way to eat the beets with the small bowl of butter. It was a bit clunky. We both enjoyed our entrees, with the Farinata as the better of the two. When it came time for dessert, we did not think we would have to ask for a candle since I had listed that it was our birthdays on the reservation. We decided to share the bread pudding, which was not the most memorable dessert, but the bigger misstep was that the candle or birthday was not acknowledged. It was a bit of a letdown, but not a huge deal. Also, I was surprised that only drip or French press coffee was available and no Italian-style espresso drinks. I typically like espresso with dessert. \n\nLastly, while friendly, service was painfully slow and there were significant gaps between courses. We spotted our server in the corner having conversations with other wait staff when we were hoping for our next course or another beverage. While knowledgeable and pleasant, the service seemed laid back and not very attentive. \n\nI realize it was a busy Thursday night, but there are so many wonderful restaurants from which to choose in San Francisco.

Rums and darks are the featured liquors of choice, all of which are potent, unique, and fragrant. The venue makes for a fancy pre game place for all the dance clubs nearby (*see Audio Disco, Beat Box, DNA Lounge) which I think is a way better option than getting liquored up with the same lame drinks for about the same prices inside those clubs.\n\nService 5 Stars - Really warm and attentive staff. They offered coat check, was able to accommodate an additional guest in my party, kept the flow of food and drinks at a steady pace, and compt us dessert for our under cooked entree.\n\nFood 4 Stars - A short menu is always nice as the chefs can focus more on their offerings. On this night, I had the whole duck which came with brussels sprouts, mushroom bread pudding, and creamy polenta. For $80 bucks, it feeds a table of 4 and is a great value. The duck is beautifully roasted and brought out whole for everyone to see prior to it being perfectly carved.

The food came out quicker and our waiter checked in with us constantly. \n\nWe started with the deviled eggs, grilled sardine, the rabbit rillettes, and little gem salad with beets. All were excellent starters to share and begin the dinner course.  My favorite being the rabbit rillette, as it was a nice balance of salty and fatty.  The sardines were my second favorite. It was nicely grilled with a raw center.  \n\nMy main was the seared swordfish, while my partner's the rabbit sausage. When both plates came out, the rabbit sausage was huge compared to my swordfish.  Both were great mains, but I would have to say that I preferred the rabbit sausage to the swordfish.  The rabbit sausage seasoning made the taste jumped out. Compared to the swordfish, which was cooked perfectly, but relied more on the broth it was served with for flavor.\n\nWe all shared the poached pear & huckleberry gallette and the chocolate cake.  Being the chocoholic, the cake was my favorite. It was more on the lines of a flour less chocolate cake.  The deep dark chocolate flavor was pronounced and really soothed my sweet tooth.

So after my first review, Thad, the owner, contacted me and my partner, and apologized for the bad experience at Bar Agricole. So, we (me, my partner, and our 2 friends) decided to give the place a second chance. Our original party of 4 went again for part deux of our eating adventure. I must say that it was a much better experience this time around. \n\nService was very attentive. Not sure if it was because the staff may have been told to be more attentive or not in our reservation notes.  But, in all fairness, the other tables seemed to be turning in a reasonable time frame, so they were staffed adequately that night. The food was actually much better as well. \n\nOf course we had the trout deviled eggs again for appetizers. Yummo.  I think I could've eaten that the whole night for appetizer and entr\u00e9e. We also tried the rabbit rillets, grilled sardine, and the little gems salad to share. My entr\u00e9e was the rabbit sausage. It was tender and cooked well.  If it had a little bit more spice to it to give it some kick, I think it would have been perfect. It was still good, however. The sausage was cooked with a side of radicchio, which gave the dish a bit of a bitter taste. It wasn't bad like the radicchio or endive that was cooked with my pork my first time I came here, however. \n\nFor dessert we had both the poached pear gallete and the chocolate cake. Both were excellent. Compliments to the pastry chef.\n\nBen, who is Thad's brother was there that evening and came to check up on us at the closing of the meal.

Easy to get a table\nI called in an hour before and managed to get a table for 12 people. I've forgotten how that feels in S.F....\n\n2.       Delicious and creative food\nThe brunch menu changes often, so not sure if these recommendations will be there by the time you try Bar Agricole. The two poached eggs with sweet potato hash and bone marrow was amazing, although I honestly don't know if I could taste the bone marrow in the hollandaise sauce. The two fried eggs with lamb and tortillas was a crowd favorite, honestly one of the best brunch dishes I have ever had. The hazelnut cake was not as soft as I would have liked, but at only $6 and an amazing presentation it didn't really matter to my friends. The menu is a bit limited, but I appreciated the chef willing to make multiple substitutions for the vegetarians in my group.\n\n3. Nice ambiance\nBoth the outside patio and the indoor room have a really fun vibe to it. Was a great place for a relaxed Sunday brunch.\n\nI'll definitely be back!", "author": "Ashwin S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-02-01", "description": "At least, Yelp has a more realistic review than Opentable.com. I'm reposting the review that I left there: \n\n- Don't believe the menu on Opentable.com. The actual menu costs 50% MORE and has less choices. To claim that this is less than $30 per entree is a joke. \n\n- We ordered Cocktails (each of them costs $15 for some reason). Now, when I order a cocktail, I expect the size of the drink to equal AT LEAST one shot of alcohol + whatever additional liquid needs to be in there. Not so at Bar Agricole: The 'Ti Punch, for example, comes with a very large ice cube (ooooh!! aaaahh!) and a glass that looks reasonably full. My friend removed the ice cube to see what was left in and it was basically half a shot... $15. Impressive. I'd recommend skipping on the \"Mixology\" and go back to efficient bartending. \n\n- The cocktails took 20 mn to get to the table. The waiter came twice asking if everything was ok and we told him twice that we were waiting on the cocktails. Note that they have 2 bars in the restaurant and it was pretty empty when we got in... \n\n- We probably had 4 different waiters throughout the evening. One of whom should be introduced to the world of deodorants. One was delightful. \n\n- The food was ok. For the price and the service, it was well below expectations.  \n\n- The entr\u00e9es should have come at the same time. Not one entr\u00e9e, then wait 2 minutes, then two more entr\u00e9es, then wait 1 minute, then the final entr\u00e9e. \n\nConclusion: If you're going to charge the price this restaurant charges and have the attitude of a high-end restaurant, then I strongly suggest that you go back to restoration 101. Here are a few notes of advices: \n- Ladies should be handed the menu first. They should also be asked what they want to eat first. \n- When someone tastes the wine and ok's it, you don't refill his glass first - you start with the ladies, then the other guests and you finish with the person who tasted. \n- Whiskey should NEVER EVER be served in a wine / flute-like glass. I mean, come on!! \n\nFinally, thank you for the seats in front of the bathroom while the restaurant was half empty.", "author": "Francois D."}

All were solid and delicious. The highlights for me were the mushroom spaghetti and the soft boiled eggs. The pork belly was good but oddly dry. Unlike others we found the portions reasonable though as others mentioned, a bit pricey ($80 / person w/o any drinks).\n\nThe service though was really uneven. While the team was at times very attentive and friendly (offering to bring more water, bread etc) at other times they seemed oddly defensive and stiff. When we asked to have some of the leftover spaghetti bagged up to go, they acted like that was an odd request. Moreover, after the meal was over, we waited about 20-30 minutes for the check and when it didn't arrive (and we couldn't find our server) I nicely asked her for it on my way to the restroom. She was really defensive, even insisting that she'd already brought it. This was just wrong -- she hadn't brought us the check. When she saw it wasn't on / under the table she said \"someone must have swiped it.\" Very odd.  Perhaps she was just new to the job - we also noticed she consistently set the table on the wrong side for half our table (who always got their utensils on the left).

The dungenous crab salad with quinoa was super fresh and bright and quite generous on the crab portions. The oxtail terrine was beautifully presented and provided the mouth with subtle food-gasms. The miso pickled sardines gave a nice punch of flavors as well.\n\nService: Our server, while nice when she was around, was never around. 5 sometimes 10 minutes would go by without her presence. The food runners and bussers however, were on their \"A\" game, which made up for our servers lack of serving.\n\nAmbience: Bar Agricole has to have one of the swankiest entrances to any restaurant in SF. You walk through this sleek corridor and find yourself at the front of the restaurants doors. Inside, you will find cement walls and modernized asymmetrical chandeliers on the ceiling. The bar itself has an understated charm to it with murals above it back bar.

The plates lend themselves to being shared. The architecture is unusual for the city and incredibly well done and tasteful. If you are on a date, make sure not to fall into the trap of thoroughly searching through all of their two dozen cocktails and their composition at the beginning of the meal, that would be a mood killer.\n\nFavorite cocktail of the evening was the turf cocktail. Not over the top at all but it was reminiscent of a gin martini with a twist with an extra flavor twist. Would order again. Despite the large cocktail menu there weren't very many I wanted to order, mostly because there was always one ingredient (absinthe, fernet) that I didn't want in my drink. But the ones I did have were well made.\n\nAll the food was good. Stand out dish was the black cod with saffron cream sauce. The sauce was good enough to warrant asking for bread to sop up the excess sauce. Would order again. Other dishes were good but not memorable.\n\nGratuity is included in all the prices. At first glance this makes it look like a four dollar sign restaurant. When the final bill is signed it is a high three dollar sign place.  Overall this place is not a great cost value. At $80 per person I didn't leave particularly full and only had two drinks.

We brought our own wine for a corkage fee of $28/btl- they'd waive the fee if you ordered an additional bottle from them and then later had cocktails. They've acclaimed to have the BEST rated cured charcuterie board in the nation- no ifs ands or buts, it was pretty good. So far, service has been great. My friends ordered a citrus salad that consisted of beet and orange. Later they had split a chrysanthemum pesto spaghetti dish I thought was elaborately overpriced. I ordered a dungeoness crab grits appetizer dish as my entree (not much of an appetite built up in the day). Least to say I ate it ALL, but I was under the assumption it was going to be made of hominy white corn instead of yellow corn. I'm being very generous as to giving Bar Agricole 4 stars due to the ambiance and service, but I'm needing to try this place again with their other entrees to really confirm it lives up to their culinary acclaim.

I really enjoy good food and great service.\n\nWe got Bar Agricole around 9:00PM to a mostly empty dining room. The host said it would take 20-30 minutes to get us a table. We ordered drinks at the bar immediately pretty much immediately, and before we were able to get them, almost 20 minutes later, the host came to grab us for our table. \n\nOnce at the table, across 2 hours, we had to beg for service, with the waitress constantly visiting our neighbors, and never us. When we did finally get a visit, it took them 10-15 minutes to get drinks, even sparkling water. \n\nIt was probably the worst experience:price ratio in my life.", "author": "Sargun D."}

This place is beautifully decorated and has a cool vibe inside but the food and service is disappointing. Came for dinner at 9 and was seated immediately. It was exceptionally warm inside and the ice in our drinks couldn't keep them cold.\n\nServer was depressed and very short. He did not make us feel welcome and offered no input on menu choices. Drinks and food were delivered very slowly and he never came by to ask how we were doing. I had to summon him over when we needed another round of drinks.\n\nThe food was the biggest letdown. For these prices you need to have really good food in SF. The flatbread was bland, duck loin boring and oysters well overpriced. The meatball was the best thing we had and it was something I could get at a chain restaurant with more flavor and better service.\n\nThe only thing they do right are the drinks. The presidente was excellent.\n\nOverall- I will never go there again unless I desperately need a cocktail. I'd rather go to Butter across the street for Jell-O shots and fried food or get a slice of pizza next door.", "author": "Ron P."}

I know, it's been a force to contend with for awhile, with many places staking a premature claim to having the quaffs of your dreams. But when I separate the wheat from the chaff a handful of bars vie for that large part of my heart devoted to cocktails.\n\nBar Agricole is one such contender. If you are a cocktail nerd, you have probably already been here. If you're not a cocktail nerd, you probably stopped reading my reviews a long time ago. Rum based cocktail menus are my weakness, and BA's menu is heavily rummified, with drinks like the Long Rhum Buck and Presidente, although Monkey Glands is an amazing gin drink that stole my heart and knocked me over. The sexy bartenders whispered all those mixology sweet nothings like, 'house made', 'herbs', and 'bitters'. I love it when you talk that talk to me, I said, after plunking down ten dollars for these sinful creations that take some sweet time to make. The pleasure is well worth the endured wait. \n\nHaving been twice, both times on Fridays, I've sought refuge on the front patio because the bar is packed. Bye bye, bartender. Even on rainy nights the patio is a nice place to be; it's covered and has heat lamps. After a few fabulous cocktails the heat lamps are unnecessary. The entire place is beautiful, with the inside being modern and boasting an awesome ceiling sculpture, and the outside patio having an herb garden and more rustic appeal. With these drinks and the company of my beloved fellow cocktail nerds, I would be content being in a lean-to during a hurricane. \n\nWhether you're a seasoned cocktail snob or a virgin daiquiri, you'll enjoy Bar Agricole.

With this bit of intelligence, we marched in with high expectations. It was a Friday night around 8:30ish and the bar/restaurant was packed. There was not a seat available anywhere. But a last minute decision was made to brave the wet and rainy weather and sit outside. It is a covered patio, but it was cold out. A cocktail would be needed to warm us up.\n\nWe grabbed a cocktail list and drink orders were taken. \"Hot Decks\" \"Brown Derbys\" and \"Monkey Glands\" were the drink of the nights. As the rebellion went scouting for a table outside, my wife and I were left at the bar to ensure delivery of the nights libations. \n\nA hint for you, part of the fun is watching the expert mixologist craft your cocktails. Tiny bottles of house made bitters and potions lined up and carefully measured and placed in each concoction and mixed right in front of you. This is no place to grab that fast drink, these bartenders take their time but I like that!\n\nAfter a bit of a wait, our drinks were ready and my wife and I maneuvered in shifts to safely deliver the drinks to our rebellious friends.

Straight off, I have to say I did not like the ambiance; cold, modern, grey--not warm, or welcoming.  Our booth was positioned in the most awkward corner next to the bar and in front of a stairwell that led to the kitchen.  It was very dark except for a direct light above the table-it felt like an interrogation room. Not cozy.  Something should be done about this spot in the restaurant.\n\nThe server was very nice and professional-a man with glasses.  He was very attentive and knowledgable about the food.  The staff has obviously been trained to take pride in their food and service.  \n\nUnfortunately, my table continued to receive incorrect dishes.  First was the deviled eggs, then flat bread, then a salad-one after the other-before me or anyone in our party even had a chance to order food.  It was very odd, as the staff was clearly mistaking our table for another.  The staff was very apologetic and later offered a glass of wine on the house.  I appreciated the gesture in response to the service hiccup.  \n\nAnd lastly for food-hit or miss.  The rabbit and pork were not excellent cuts of meat.  There was a ricotta mushroom dish that was absolutely amazing.  I would have to return in the future to try more of the food because I have only been once.  The server mentioned that the menu changes daily, a huge trend in restaurants right now.  I think I prefer a restaurant that serves the same menu that changes seasonnaly, where each dish is well thought out. \n\nAll in all,  not crazy in the ambiance and will probably not be back, unless my boyfriend is treating.", "author": "Bret O."}

I expressly mentioned I wanted to sit on the patio as my friend was visiting me from the east coast and wanted to enjoy the nice weather in San Francisco while she was here. A woman took my reservation and phone number and said that I needed to be aware that by 7:30 p.m. we would have to leave the patio because they had a private party that had booked the entire space. I said not to worry - 2 hours would be plenty and we'd be out by 7 at the latest.\n\nGot to the restaurant at about 4:50 (was a bit early) and the man at the front told me that I would not be able to sit on the patio (note - entire restaurant was empty, I was the only guest there) because they had the private party coming and that they might arrive early.

And then just start ordering away.\n\nNow, apparently since their well respected head chef has left, the food has slipped a bit and therefore many people now say the price isn't worth it.  WRONG.  If someone else's paying, it's ALL VERY GOOD (maybe not the Bouillabaisse, kinda mehish, go ahead and skip that one)  I'd go for the Salmon or maybe try the Duck Liver.  \n\nBut what this place is known for are the awesome cocktails!  In fact I know people who only come for the drink.  Try the Monkey's Gland! Or maybe the Whiz Bang with the Absinthe, or the Jack Rabbit, or you know what? TRY 'EM ALL!  That's right drink up.

Food first: The cocktails were delicious and the appetizers we got to start (fried green tomatoes and the pate) were small but wonderful. They even had happy hour oysters, though our server was less than knowledgeable about them... more on that in a minute. I had the prosciutto sandwich (their take on a BLT), which left something to be desired. The bread was burnt and there were maybe three small pieces of prosciutto. You'd think with such little meat they would compensate by adding more tomato but no such luck. We had the french toast for dessert; this was also burnt. \n\nAs for service, it was inattentive at best. We were seated towards the back of the restaurant and I think our server walked by our table a total of 6 times the entire 2 hours we were there. There was no checking back as we ate several courses to ensure everything was ok. One of my friends had an egg dish that required a spoon. She had to leave the parts of the dish that she couldn't eat with a fork. There were also food items that were completely forgotten and when reminded of such our server made no effort to remedy the situation. \n\nOverall very disappointing.", "author": "Kristin M."}

It's tucked away between a couple of building and looks more like a warehouse from the outside.  The decor is very minimal, but trendy and the crowd is filled with young, urban professionals.  The bar area is probably the highlight of the place for me -- it has a long bar area with seating for maybe 15-20 people.  Even on a Tuesday night, it seemed to be a pretty crackin' place.  Seating is first-come-first-serve and the bartenders are friendly enough.\n\nIt's a great place to meet-up with coworkers or friends after work to get drinks and appetizers.  I'm not sure if I would come here and have a full-on dining experience, though.  The vibe is cool, but the dishes are rather pricey, even as appetizers from the bar menu.\n\nI had some of the salami sampler from the appetizer menu and it was probably the best cut of salami I have ever had.  It was delicious, rich, and not dry in the least.  There were also a few other appetizers my coworkers had that looked interesting, but they were about $14+.\n\nThe drinks are the things to get here, though.  They're unique and extremely good.  I had the Sleepyhead, which is a potent ginger drink.  It was phenomenal.  I've never been able to appreciate ginger + alcohol but I did after drinking it here.  I also had the Daquiri.  That, hands-down, is the best drink I've had in San Francisco.  Extremely good, probably in part due to the hype.  It was voted as part of the top 10 Daquiri spots in America: http://imbibemagazine.com/Best-Daiquiris.", "author": "Dustin N."}

It was one of the worst experiences I have had at any restaurant in the recent years. First off, no one was at the front to greet us and/or show us to our table. Secondly, even after being seated for about 15 minutes, no server came by to take our drinks order. After specifically asking someone to kindly send us someone to take our order, the server was very rude with no interest in recommending anything nor did she have even the least of a smile (in spite of us being super friendly and smiley towards her). Finally, soon after our appetizers and drinks had arrived, we wanted to place our entr\u00e9e order but, surprise surprise, no one stopped by for another 20 minutes by which time we decided to stop our meal midway and leave.

They explained that the evening is not one of their busiest and that they turn it into a fun theme night for the staff.  \n\nLast night, I went back and had a thoroughly enjoyable meal.  As always, the stunning styling wows you upon walking into the restaurant.  LIghting was subdued but not so dark you couldn't see who you were dining with.  The loudness level was \"exciting\" but not ballistic.  We were able to easily converse.  The music selection wasn't my favorite type of music (sounded like Rockabilly, which I didn't like when it first came out), but at least it was a good level, thematically consistent and, hey, you can't always get what you want.  Service was appropriately attentive.  Only comment I have is they should deliver their drinks faster.  They'd sell more.\n\nThe food was outstanding.  I had the escarole salad with green goddess dressing and enjoyed every bite, from the perfectly prepared golden beets to the seemingly freshly harvested escarole.  My partner has the kale salad and, to put it simply, I will be making that salad at home.  So f'n good.  I jumped on the kale bandwagon earlier this year and it keeps getting better.  We make baked kale chips with olive oil and sea salt at home for a terrifically light & healthy appetizer.  So yummy!\n\nAnyway, I digress.  For mains, I had the pork leg.  It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The tiny new potatoes were crunchy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  There was a white side sauce that I really enjoyed and some sort of green stuff on the side that was excellent.  My partner had the bouillabaisse, which was extremely tasty.  The huge crostini was a nice touch, as it was perfectly toasted and way oversized so if you ate half, that would be a lot, but you could still feel good about not eating all of it.\n\nFor dessert, we split the flourless chocolate cake.  It totally looks like a simple brownie when served.  Once you bite into, you begin to wonder if your eyes are playing tricks on you: it's light -- almost air-filled, great texture and super yummy.", "author": "Kevin M."}

Double or triple our original price point, and a place I was terribly under-dressed for, but, a good find regardless.\n\nHaving originally bookmarked this place after hearing mention of their well-crafted cocktails, with specific mention towards the off-menu (or off-season) Moonraker, there was no way I wasn't going to order one. A little pricier than most of their cocktails, at $12 instead of $10, the Moonraker ended up being a good, quality drink.\n\nFor food, Anna ordered the Dungeness crab spaghetti, while I went with the milk braised pork shoulder. The spaghetti was pretty good, with interesting flavors and spices, while the pork shoulder was also quite tasty, and as tender as one would hope for in something braised. While neither of them really wowed me, they were both pretty damn good. Sadly (or not), it seems like their menu changes fairly often, so expect to not see these by the time you make it out here. \n\nThese folks are in the $10/$30/$10 price tier, so keep that in mind, with entrees ranging from $20-$30.

We shared the stracciatella (creamy cheese on toast with fava beans) , scallop ceviche, fried squash blossom, porcini mushrooms, and shisito peppers. Of those, the squash blossom was our favorite- perfectly seasoned, nice textural contrast, and well balanced accoutrements. The mushroom dish was also delicious and so fragrant of mushroom. We were a bit divided on the scallop ceviche as one of us doesn't like uni (and also wished there were more textural contrast than the soft- scallops, uni, avocado) but the other thought it was a good dish. Overall though, it lacked the acid of your typical ceviche and we wished it was a bit less creamy.\n\nhe stracciatella was yummy (granted it's the center, creamiest part of burrata cheese) but also too tiny to be worh the $10 they charged- it was just a piece of cheese on a tiny piece of toast!

After frustratingly being told by the host that there was no outdoor seating, my date and I decided to set up camp at the bar...and it turned out arguably better than sitting on the beautiful patio! \n\nImmediately, we began bantering with our bartender, Craig Lane, who was as caring as he was knowledgeable. He was genuinely interested in our story, while at the same time making recommendations based on our favorite spirits. As with any good bartender experience, we also received an education, learning about the origins of different brandies. \n\nThe cocktail we both had was the Sleepyhead, which had initially jumped out at me (Passion Pit references tend to do that). Craig didn't know this, but recommended the drink anyway, and I was sold. Comprised of brandy, mint, lime, sparkling wine, and a beautiful housemade ginger concoction, the cocktail was not overly sweet, had a great mouthfeel, and refreshing all at the same time. Exquisite.\n\nThen the food. At Craig's recommendation, we got the Sausage Sunday prix fixe menu, and enhanced it with an additional first course. \n\nThe burrata/eggplant/peppers first course was to die for, being served over a savory romesco. We practically licked the bowl.\n\nWe also had the rabbit pat\u00e8, which was well seasoned and served with incredible mustard-covered fingerling potatoes and haricot verts.\n\nThe main course was a roasted lamb of leg served alongside it's loin with a fantastic huckleberry reduction (not too sweet, thankfully!). The bitterness of sunchokes cut through the dish quite nicely, which my palate, who tends towards savory over sweet, very much appreciated. \n\nSpeaking of savory over sweet, our dessert dish was a delectable chocolate brownie served with bourbon caramel sauce and a coffee cream sprinkled with cocoa nibs. The chocolate was a mixture of milk and dark, which again allowed me to savor the actual flavors of the chocolate rather than the added sugars that so many desserts tend to carry. Bourbon and caramel are a match made in heaven, by the way.\n\nOverall, despite the seemingly rocky beginning, our experience at Bar Agricole was fantastic, and will definitely warrant subsequent trips.\n\nShout-outs to Craig, our bartender for the evening, to the host that welcomed us in the door, delivered subpar news and politely suggested alternatives, and to Miranda, my beautiful date for the evening.", "author": "Derek B."}

If you're not looking out for it, it's easy to walk past it.  The space inside is actually bigger than I expected, and there's a huge patio area.  Tables are spaced far enough out that it doesn't feel crowded or too noisy.\n\nFood:\n- Deviled eggs: trout roe made this dish, as I don't usually like the egg yolk part. It's not cheap, though - $9 for 3 half eggs\n- Rabbit rillete: with very buttered toast (too much better for me given it was to be served with the rabbit rillete).  The rillete itself had good flavor, no gaminess, and the apple mustard was a nice, unique accompniment\n- Mushroom bread pudding: I'm a big fan of savory bread puddings, and this one had a lot of mushroom flavor\n- Rabbit sausage: lean, good flavor, not too salty.  The polenta underneath wasn't as exciting, but the English peas added some nice texture and color\n- Risotto: tons of shiitake mushrooms, green garlic, and crisped dandelion leaves.  This dish also had lots of textures and colors, which I really liked\n\nDessert: \n- Hazelnut pound cake with huckleberries: not as rich as you'd expect for a pound cake; it was actually a bit drier than expected, maybe due to the fresh hazelnuts?  It would have been better with vanilla ice cream instead of the whipped cream.\n\nCocktails: \n- Pisco sour: appropriately creamy with the egg whites, nice and tart\n- Sleepyhead: so I may have had 3 of these... slightly tart with a hint of ginger, not too sweet at all, topped with sparkling wine\n- Jackrabbit: did someone say apple brandy??\n\n$11 per specialty cocktail isn't bad at all for SF these days.\n\nAgain, the drinks here were amazing (not surprisingly given the James Beard nomination), and food takes a backseat to the mixology.

Today was the first time Bar Agricole did brunch and wow, they are NOT ready.  The 4 person table next to us sent back the one dish that was served as the other 3 dishes didn't arrive after 10+ minutes.  Then 5 minutes later the waiter tried to serve us 3 dishes that were not ours.  Our neighbors then got all their dishes except for one person.  Who waited.  And waited.  Still waiting.  We felt bad for them...but then it happened to us.\n\nPros:\n+ The airy modern space and outdoor front patio with water feature\n+ 70 degrees SF weather in February \n\nCons:\n- Food was served for everyone except one, which took an additional 15 minutes.  \n- Everyone was done by the time the last plate arrived.\n- The last plate was just fried eggs, cardoons, leeks and no bagna cauda (unless they consider stir frying the greens in sauce 'bagna cauda'.  *WTF took so long to fry two eggs?!*  \n- Wait, the 2 fried eggs cost $13?? ARGH!!\n- Watching everyone eat while you wait with no food. \n- Everyone watching you eat after they're done eating.\n- Waiter clearing plates while last person is still eating *the poor person already feels rushed after getting their dish 15 minutes late, don't try to rush them by clearing plates!*\n- Restaurants starting brunch service when staff is not ready\n\nOur waiter apologized and mentioned that it was their first day of brunch service.  But I see this as equivalent to serving undercooked chicken.  If it's not ready, DON'T DO IT.  \n\nI'm being generous with 1 star based on the potential (buckwheat beignet was good) but damnit I hate businesses that open before they're ready.

This drink was perfectly balanced and refreshing: brandy, ginger, mint, lime, with just a little bit of sparkling wine.\n- Crepe Cake. Picture 40 crepes layered on top of each other with Bavarian cream in between and fresh peaches. That description actually sounded kind of sickening to me but it was recommended and you only get a slice of this (see pic). It has kind of a creme brulee-type crispy top.\n- Fried eggs with Pork Belly. Was featured in 7x7, but they change the accompaniments (and most of the menu) regularly. This time it had avocado, semi spicy peppers, and green salsa with sprigs of something that I assumed wasn't edible but it was really pretty.\n\nAs you can tell, some serious thought and creativity was poured into this brunch menu. The service was great, the decor was cool (modern with recycled artsy materials, with a beautiful wooden wall which somehow softens the whole thing.

We were a group of 8 and decided to go for it.  Bad choice.  First of all the plates are relatively small - definitely not family style.  We ordered 8-9 plates and all left seeking a second dinner.  Also, the food is very over-priced and nothing to write home about.  The artichokes were very undercooked, the seafood was not fresh, and nothing gave us the \"wow\" factor.\"\n\nThe first thing I did when I left the restaurant was to go to the crepe stand across the street to satisfy my still-grumbling stomach. My boyfriend went home and heated up a Hot Pocket, which he said was preferable to our meal. For the prices we just paid, we should NOT be doing that. At all.\n\nThe food is seriously underwhelming. While the cocktails were okay, they were nothing extraordinary and were on par with a place like Beretta's (which serves far superior food). We even had this one super gross chicken dish that none of our party could eat -- it was just raw, cold, bland, and had the consistency of a soggy sponge. Gross.\n\nAnother reviewer wrote, \"Not a good restaurant. It is foofee foofee and for no good reason. The food is mediocre at best.Over all, not a cozy environment, attempts to be a posh place but fails and amounts to a fancy barn.\"\n\nOh so true. I cannot believe how snobby some of the staff members can get! They treat us diners like we're just in their way or something, despite the fact that, oh, you know, we're SUPPOSED TO BE THE CLIENT. The hipper-than-thou attitude that is evident in this place is ridiculous. Our server even told us this: \"If you have any questions about the food, drinks, or the space, let me know.\" The space?! THE SPACE? You mean the glorified warehouse we're in? Look, it's all very nice, but I think that, considering the quality of your food, you've got other things to worry about than the \"space\".

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-21", "description": "I've been curious about Bar Agricole for a little while. Opened in August, much of the hype was around the fresh, artisanal cocktails. I wondered - how about the food? It's called a 'bar,' so it sounds like the emphasis is on drinks first, food second. However, a lot has been said about the food as well. Food critic Michael Bauer just named it one of the 11 best new restaurants of 2010. Given my newfound appreciation for cocktail pairings, this was a must-try place on my list.\n\nTequila Cocktail with sweet vermouth, stonefruit bitters and orange - We started with this small cocktail compliments of the bar. It had a strong citrus and peach nose, and actually went down rather smooth with a pretty strong orange flavor.\n\nMoonraker Cocktail with brandy, peach whiskey, cocchi americano and absinthe - This cocktail had a strong caramel flavor; slightly sweet, yet slightly savory too.\n\nTi Punch with white agricole and lime zest - The punch had a noticeable lime flavor and an interesting sweet/bitter interplay.\n\nGrilled squid with meyer lemon, potatoes and cilantro - The squid was cooked well, yielding tender and rather meaty pieces of squid. The meyer lemon was instrumental in adding a little bit of citrus and acidity to accompany the squid, as well as the savory potatoes. Yum.\n\nDungeness crab with farro, dandelion greens and chili - The farro had a really nice chew to them - perfectly cooked. The crab chunks varied in size, and the smaller pieces were rather overwhelmed in the farro. However, when the ratios were correct, this was a delicious bite. A little heat from the chili and some extra body from the greens rounded out the dish.\n\nSpaghetti alla puttanesca with a meatball - Next was this rather ordinary looking spaghetti. However, this was a very good pasta. The pasta was al dente with a sweet and tangy tomato sauce. The meatball was moist and had some good fresh herb flavor; this was a surprisingly strong pasta, especially after having some good ones for lunch at Cotogna.\n\nLong Rhum Buck with ginger and lime - This next cocktail was probably my favorite of the night. Ginger and lime flavors were both evident, and worked very well together.\n\nWood oven roasted pork chop with savoy cabbage and scarlet turnips - The pork chop was cooked to a medium temperature. There wasn't as much of a sear as I would've liked, but we still have a lot of food flavor. The pork chop was pretty juicy too, and I liked the savoy cabbage to go along with it.\n\nChicken al mattone with chickpeas and purple carrots - We were thoroughly enjoying the food, so we ordered one more entree. The chicken was cooked okay - it wasn't dry but not that moist. However, the skin was nice and crispy, and the chickpeas and carrots combined for a little bit of sweetness and earthiness.\n\nI was impressed with the food at Bar Agricole. This is in some part due to the level of expectations (I was cautiously optimistic going in), but the food here really is quite good. And the cocktails? I had high expectations and they did not disappoint. I expect Bar Agricole to remain a popular spot for the foreseeable future, drawing in both cocktail-seekers and foodies.", "author": "Darin L."}

To top it off, the pork loin my father and friend ordered was undercooked and my black cod was a bit on the salty side. If you're going to be slow, at least make sure the food is exceptional. Far from it.\n\nWith the experience we had, most decent and reputable restaurants comp at least a dessert or drink. Nope. We were offered no such thing, even though we had been extremely patient and polite with the late reservation and the inefficient service. By the time the bill came, it was 10:45 pm. \n\nThe only reason I am not giving a one star rating is because the desert and Monkey's Gland were delicious. However, I have had much better service and food at other restaurants in the city.", "author": "Mehr G."}

Between our busy jobs, small salaries, and being away for basically a month of the year attending weddings and celebrating holidays you were sure we'd slip up somewhere. Well, you were wrong. The hubs and I are (1) not quitters, (2) always rise to a challenge, and (3) are exceptional eaters and drinkers.\n\n#52 was always going to be a surprise to us. There were places we wanted to go, but not one specifically that was a stand out. Bar Agricole had been on our list for some time, and to be honest, I thought we'd fit it in sooner. But alas,  December 31st rolled around and with one left to go the obvious choice seemed to be here. With HOURS to spare we came for drinks and apps. \n\nI was late... because I am always late...but luckily the hubs saved us two seats at the very crowded bar and ordered me a (very strong) gin drink, the aptly named Hanky Panky. Wow. I honestly think I only had one and one was enough. The hubs had two bourbon drinks (come on, you know us by now) which were named the \"Brown Derby\" and aside from sampling all of their olives we ordered the duck pate. Three drinks and some apps for $50.87 before tip is steep, which is why this place didn't show up earlier on the list. But the restaurant is beautiful and had enough gorgeous architecture/decor/things to ogle over, making a very small $11 cocktail worth it. \n\nWhile chatting with the bartender (I swore I wouldn't forget his name, but of course I did- Dan?) I let him know about our quest and how we had successfully completed it, with Bar Agricole being our 52nd place. It seemed like quite the feat to him (of course) and gave us each a brandy-esque drink as a \"congrats!\" So sweet. We ended 2012 filled with great good, drinks, and memories and thank GOD we had instagram to capture it all.", "author": "Melissa N."}

I get that some restaurants serve small portions, but this is ridiculous. I could have eaten four plates and still have been hungry. The drinks are great here, probably the best old fashioned I have had. The problem I see with that is while they have a bar and they reference that in the title of their restaurant, it is just that a restaurant not a bar. The food is nothing to write home about and expensive. The gas sculptures are worth seeing, but this is a restaurant not an art gallery. \n\nThe icing on the cake with this place is the automatic gratuity they place on the bill. They claim it is for the employees health insurance (the charge healthy SF too). If you are going to to do that just include it in the already high prices of the food. You should want to take care of your employee's and include that in your expenses not tax your patrons. A gratuity is earned by the staff with excellent service and should not be demanded by the establishment.", "author": "Eric M."}

We stopped in early on in Bar Agricole's young life for an after dinner drink, and while there was nothing warm about the welcome, and it was rather hard to get the bartender's attention, they were the flavor of the week and therefore popular with the fickle we-only-like-shiny-new-things set. So fine.\n\nTonight we stopped in around 6pm for drinks and appetizers. The very small bar was full, but the inside and outside tables were empty. Things were moving at a snail's pace at the central command post. The chilly hostess, when she did finally look up from making little scribbles, repeated what she had said to the three couples before us \"we will seat you. we may even seat you outside, as you have requested. we might sit you at a communal table. would that be ok? but i just got unexpectedly slammed, so it will be a few minutes before we get to you\".\n\nOther employees were floating to and from the reception desk. Conversations were occurring. It was unclear what the real barrier was between us, the potential patrons, and our seats and tables, which seemed so.....available. After 10 minutes of waiting for this invisible logjam to disperse, we left. My companion first called the staff \"snooty\", then \"silly\", and then we just settled on \"mysterious\".", "author": "Gwynnie P."}

Dressed with oil and locally grown herbs, the McEvoy olives ($5) were just too tiny to eat politely.  At $15, a plate of speck (juniper-flavored ham from Tyrol) with sun ripened cantaloupe was drastically overpriced. Cooked perfectly al dente, nettle spaghetti ($15) with cherry tomatoes and bottarga (fish roe) was rich and filling.  Served cold accompanied by a medium cooked egg, chicken galantine ($16) was flavorless and disappointing.\n\nIf an establishment is to have piccalilli ($6, a relish of chopped vegetables and spices) on the menu, a description should be included -- unless of course, as is the case at Bar Agricole, the restaurant is just trying to be too-cool-for-school.\n\nOrganized by producer (whites, reds, sparkling, and other offerings from one winery are presented on one page), rather than by red/white, country, or flavor profile, the wine list must have seemed novel on conceptualization.  In reality, it is not cool--simply hard to navigate.  Continuing the hard-to-use theme, the menu does not bother to indicate which beers are on tap and which are offered by the bottle.  \n\nService is friendly, but must have been addled by smoking too many organic greens.  Water took forever to arrive.  Although a fresh, yet soiled, fork was quickly replaced, a cursory pre-setting inspection should have prevented its being set on the the table in the first place.  Servers' descriptions of wines were less than adequate.\n\nYes, Bar Agricole is new.  Yes, it's green.  Yes, it's trendy--for the moment.

I made the reservation that night because I loved the ambiance, drinks and food. The servers were very professional. I ended up having 12 people (all of whom work in the industry) and while it was a great dinner, I was a little disappointed in a few things:\n\nI specifically requested certain items due to dietary restrictions of mine and several others. They called me the day of to go over details and I emphasized this. However when it came time for dinner, they put a duck confit in front of me (I eat fish but not meat) and I didn't hear what it was so I dove in..... and then realized it wasn't what I thought it was. \n\nThe vegan option was spaghetti with tomato sauce (mind you it was $90 a person) and they never put one in front of my vegan friend. When she asked the server for some, she said it was already portioned out and it would cost for extra.\n\nSince there were so many meat dishes, my boyfriend told the staff we were disappointed, they offered a swordfish, which my boyfriend opted for, trying to keep me happy, but they charged him $100.\n\nThis was by no means an awful experience and I had a pleasant birthday. I just think they could have paid a little more attention to detail. These are issues that easily could have been fixed but I left with a bad taste in my mouth. The drinks are great!

I'd heard that this was one of a few restaurants which keep slipping under the Michelin radar, despite effortful and interesting foods.\n\nOn entry, we were offered the inside, with attractive booths on the side or the  outside, well heated area. So we tookp the outside area on attractive, practical concrete tables. Behind my missus was the herb garden, beautifully integrated into the whole dining area. We asked one of the guys if he knew them, which he did; from the rosemary to the lemon verbena.\n\nThe wine list comes with the first 5 or so pages advertising more no name brands than a thrift shop sale at Gucci prices. From small champagne producers to wine makers in nether regions, everyone had a story.\n\nThey also had a wine by the glass list with some basic and not particularly great wines. The Aussie Portuguese wine was young and a little coarse while the Sangiovese was not in the best condition.\n\nBut we were here mainly for the food and it didn't disappoint.  we started with the cauliflower soup with chanterelles and chives which was smooth, and wonderfully pit together. I think there was a touch of lemon which added a bit of pleasant acid to the dish. Classy of them to split it onto two plates for us.\n\nNext came the duck liver mousse which was soft and buttery with aspic jelly underneath. The toast was excellent but ended at least one more slice to complete the meal.\nThe pork belly apparently comes from pigs fed on chestnuts or something which apparently causes the fat to become well integrated into the belly. Not sure if it's true or not but this is some of the best pork belly I've had.\n\nThe lamb was superbly cooked with sides of chestnuts, kale and apple and excellent artichoke sides.\n\nWe ordered a side of Brussels for an excessive price of $8 for a side and it ended up being the weakest dish, being on the char side of cooked.  Not really worth it.\n\nIt ended up being $123 with an ok cocktail of absinthe and orange. Superb, friendly, unobtrusive service. When it looked like we were too hot they preempted it by asking If we'd like it turned down.\n\nStrange little 4% added into the bill which I still don't understand why it was there. To prevent the real cheapos from stiffing the waiters? I didn't like it at all as it makes my customary 20% now an extraordinarily high 25%. Get rid of it as it does negate the experience a little. \n\nOtherwise a really solid, quality meal at a great venue.", "author": "Pantera W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-05-26", "description": "*Note: this rating/review is based solely on the cocktails**\n\nI've lived in SF for the past 4 years, a period of time which I fondly refer to as my prime drinking years. Not that I'm some drunken party animal, at least not all the time, but really when you think about it, there's a pretty large drinking evolution that takes place from your early to mid-twenties. For example, I used to call Blondies and Beauty Bar my favorite bars in the City. I also used to pre-party, down shots, and not know what the hell a \"well drink\" was. But like most people, my appreciation for good wine, thoughtful cocktails, and bars where you can move without getting mauled by some sweaty, drunk chick, has grown. I'm happy to say that I now have a go-to spot where the cocktails are crafted and the people are adults. That bar is none other but Bar Agricole.\n\nWithin a month of opening I was hooked. With enough space to find a spot at the bar, an amazing and sizable outdoor seating area, and bathrooms that feel like palaces, it's easy to become a fan right off the bat.  I made a promise to myself and to Craig, Agricole's lead bartender, that I wouldn't allow myself to return until I had finally written about my favorite bar. Well damnit, I want to get a drink!\n\nBar Agricole represents the quintessential San Francisco bar: a stylish yet casual (Beard Award Winning) atmosphere, a solid menu focused on local, sustainable ingredients, and the focus of this article: stellar cocktials. \n\nBar Agricole was selected as a 2012 James Beard finalist for Outstanding Bar Program for a reason. Rather than trying to recreate the wheel on every drink, bartenders here generally look towards the past for inspiration. Updating classic cocktails, or bringing forgotten ones back to life, is the backbone of many of their selections. The end result? Cocktails that are potent yet drinkable, and something you haven't tried before.\n\nUnlike many other notable bars, Agricole doesn't just have a solid, but stagnant, cocktail menu. Instead, they are continually creating and testing out new drinks and often changing the menu. In fact, while signature cocktails like the Presidente or Ti Punch never leave the menu, every time I've dropped by there's always been something new to try.\n\nBeing a gin kinda gal, my go-to cocktail of late has been the Monkey Gland. I mean, with a name that sexy who wouldn't want it? It's made with gin, citrus, absinthe, and grenadine and served the cutest darn tulip goblet you've ever seen! But don't let the size fool you, this drink is small but powerful. Other favorites include the Long Rhum Buck and a classic Manhattan.\n\nCocktails of this caliber always help remind me that even with the same, simple ingredients, making amazing cocktails is a difficult thing to get right, and that it's places like Bar Agricole that are raising the bar on quality cocktails at a national level.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

And it wasn't from the deceptive, \"Ti Punch with Agricole and lime zest,\" (in fact a shot of Agricole over a huge ice cube with some lime zest, doing little to mask the straight booze.)  With help from the menu I brought home, this is what I can cobble together.\nFour of us shared chopped liver on toast, pork pate, local anchovies and something with squid.  All four dishes came out in a mad rush within 5 minutes, as we did our best to course it out as small plates.  What makes it exceptionally frustrating is that nothing was bad.  Chopped liver was quite smooth.  Local anchovies mild and not too oily.  Squid tender.  But as we came to, \"Who wants the last one?\" no one bit.\n\nEveryone was so disappointed we almost left without dessert.  Fortunately, the one Panna Cotta we got to share was ridiculously good.  Delicately sweet, rich and smooth, I'll have two of those and skip dinner, please.", "author": "Laura S."}

The food was excellent - had the poached eggs which are served with arugula and polenta it was delicious. We also had two little ones with us and the waiter suggested that they could split the frenchtoast which was a great suggestion because the french toasts are huge and yummy. I think the drinks are probably the highlight - had supreme which is made with calvados (an apple brandy). I have to say the place is pricey - tiny cocktails are $15. Overall we had an awesome experience service was great - the drinks took sometime to come out - could be because it was saturday morn and the bar staff was just warming up.

But then- Chicken and Dumplings with fava beans, black Spanish radish, and creme fraiche - the first bite transported me somewhere else. I had to stop my conversation to express my love for this dish. It had all of these elements of comfort. It just transformed my mood which was bitter and crappy.

I actually asked the waiter how long it would be on the menu and alas, he found out from the kitchen that it was the last evening for it! Life is sick and twisted this way but I am thankful to have had it and reacted the way I did. Rare for me. Halibut with snap peas, spinach, and herb butter- enjoyed it, everything was cooked perfect and I loved the herbs. Finished everything off with the chocolate crepes and white pepper ice cream.

Yes, peers might be more forgiving than a customer off the street, but they will also see much more into the inner-workings of the machine and find flaws. Well, the Bar Agricole bar team made a slew of incredible cocktails, their own spins on classics, while the kitchen put out several items, including the highlights: roasted pork appetizers which people were melting over (I didn't have any), plus a gingerbread-like cake with sliced stone fruit and a light cream... simple, explosive flavors of spice and fruit without being overly sweet.

The entire decor of Bar Agricole is very cool and modern like we like.  The wood and concrete internally contrasted really well.  We had a few cocktails to begin and they were very good and different than the normal cocktails that we normally order.\n\nFor dinner we started with the olives and herbs, smoked cod croquettes and crab salad.  The croquettes were probably our favorite although there wasn't enough to satisfy us.  For our main meals we had the housemade spaghetti and sausage.  Both were very tasty but after the first couple of bites the spaghetti wasn't as great as the first bites.  We did like our meals though and we finished off with a lemon tart which was our favorite thing we had all night.\n\nBar Agricole was a little pricey but for a different type of meal in a cool spot I'd recommend checking it out.", "author": "Blake B."}

I ordered the eggplant soup, which shows the rich, smoky soul of what a well-roasted eggplant can be. The menu was a little confusing--there's no line break separating entrees from small plates, so price (or your server) will be your best guide. Also notable was the raw albacore with cucumber and beets and the local anchovies.\n\nWe finished with the lemon tart and espresso.

You wouldn't know on a Monday night at 8:30 pm here, where the bar and restaurant was bustling with customers very pleased with their $10 cocktails (reasonable, when compared to New York prices)  Soaring space, wood paneled walls that remind me of a Swedish sauna and wavy glass tube sculptures that look like they were designed on a computer.  We snagged the space at the end of the bar, closest to the door and felt like the lords of the realm.  The bar is lower there, so you can engage in a great chat with the bartender who will show you a reproduction of the world's first cocktail manual and patiently discuss when straws were first in vogue (gentlemen in the 1800s, to protect their rotten teeth, had their own glass straws to sip their spirits) and the origins of the metal straw with the round paddle (which they jokingly call a \"spraw.\")\n\nThe drinks we had included a well-done Manhattan, a \"Brooklyn\" which included agricole wine and two kinds of bitters, and our friends had rinks with eggs whites and another with a pile of ice heaped dramatically above the rim.

One big difference since when Bar Agricole opened is the al fresco dining expansion, which really utilizes the well-designed outdoor space quite nicely.\n\nHowever, we were seated inside (which was perfectly fine with us as it was a bit chilly).  While waiting for entire party to arrive, we ordered drinks at the bar.  The Brown Derby (bourbon, grapefruit, lemon, honey, bitters) was an unusual citrus bourbon drink but it worked well.  Wasn't as impressed with the Whiz Bang, which sounded great (scotch, vermouth, grenadine, absinthe, bitters).  The Presidente (demarara rum, curacao, grenadine orange bitters) was good but perhaps not as amazing as I had remembered fro my initial visit.\n\nBased on other Yelp reveiws, I was a little concerned with how service would be and mindful of ordering early on (including round two of drinks) after we were seated.  But I was pleasantly surprised find that the food came out relatively promptly and so no complaints at all here.  \n\nFoodwise, the sea urchin deviled eggs was fantastic - creamy, unique and decadent. Half a dozen miyagi oysters also hit the spot very nicely.  The chopped duck liver on toast was just okay.\n\nFor entrees, the black cod with black tea broth was light and refreshing, but I thought somewhat bland compared to the delicious duck entree.  The duck came two ways - sliced roasted duck breast, which were perfectly cooked and also a confit leg that was fried on one side and the meat fell off the bone so easily.  The onions and turnip accompaniments were quite nice as well.\n\nAll in all, a pretty good dinner.  However, it is pricey and portions are small so things add up really quickly.

A warehouse-feel transpires through the mixture of natural and man-made elements, such as wood, concrete and steel, in their d\u00e9cor.\n\nEats:\n\nOrdered the \"Charcuterie Plate,\" which consisted of a small serving of headcheese, chicken galantine, and lamb loin, served with two slices of French bread and mixed green salad. This was the first of firsts for me. Headcheese is definitely not what I had expected it to be. A true love- hate experience as it reminded me of liverwurst and cured sausage at the same time. Chicken galantine was a delight especially with the jelly served on top. I'm not a huge fan of lamb but the lamb loin at Bar Agricole was tender and flavorful, and not as gamey as I had imagined.\n\nAt the Bar:\n\nMoscow Mule: perfect balance between tangy, sour, and sweet. Garnished with mint leaves freshly picked from the herb garden they maintain in their outdoor patio. Loved it!\n\nTi Punch: made with their agricole rum and lime zest served with a block of ice as big as the glass it comes in. Much too strong for my taste.\n\nPresidente: rum, curacao, grenadine, and orange bitters. Taste was reminiscent of a whiskey in the form of rum.\n\nOverall experience was great.

LOVED IT. Second time I went - found it a bit flat - without the same special experience but the 3rd time caused me to write this restaurant off - altogether.\n\nI realize I am not the best judge of menu items due to all the alterations I must request (FYI - I always ask in advance if chef is comfortable with my special dietary requests before visiting a restaurant) and that is not my 'beef' with BA. who initially struck me for being so respectful of quality, sourcing,...But back to my issue - THE SERVICE. I took a girlfriend for her birthday; we were both surprised by the TWO separate servers who could not have been more disinterested in serving us through our entire meal. I couldn't tell if it was contempt for us or they were just really pissed off about something going on behind the scenes.

Well and carefully made, as you'd expect.\n\nThe menu seems to change regularly; on our evening we selected the sea urchin deviled eggs, which were Spectacular. Truly. Wonderful combination of flavors. I could eat those all night.\n\nWe followed that with a marvelous pasta & Dungeness crab dish, which was rich and hearty and spicy and very cold-weather appropo, while still keeping all its flavors in balance. Excellent.\nAlso a swordfish entree, which arrived as 4 smaller pieces of fish, seared to a spectacularly tender and juicy medium-rare, in a light Japanese-style vegetable broth with seaweed, bok choy, and grilled radish. A completely different preparation to any I've had before, and very good.\n\nWe sat at the bar, so our service was excellent and attentive.

The menu seems about 50 pages long, and each page is a different country, and none of the wines have descriptions...just really large prices. Most of the bottles were significantly over $100, which was too fancy for what we had in mind. We decided on a \"cheapo\" \"domestic\" bottle of wine for about $65.

The cocktail menu was a little far-reaching for me, so I settled on a delicious red. \n\nWe ordered the romaine and anchovy salad, not quite a Caesar, but with many of the same elements and flavors, it was light and refreshing and I loved the radishes adorning the salad. The manager also brought over the pickled herring with beets and creme fraiche... I loved the horseradish spiciness to the herring, definitely not like the herring I grew up with. I definitely recommend the dish, it was inventive and delicious.\n\nWe also ordered and shared the wild sea bass. The fish was cooked perfectly and I enjoyed the baby carrots and artichoke on the side, but to me the whole dish was too mild and needed additional seasoning, it was a little bland for my taste, so if I were to go back, I would probably try the butternut squash soup or the duck.\n\nEn route to the bathroom I noticed a large private dining room downstairs with a large farmhouse table, a great place to have a larger party.\n\nDefinitely recommend!", "author": "Jess K."}

A gift from the bar arrived when we sat down, a lovely little palate cleanser, bright, acidic, yummy! The menu had a lot going on and our server helped us make choices for the table. We decided to eat family style ( their suggestion). Each selection came perfectly timed as we finished our previous choice. Salad, pasta, crab, all uniquely flavored and perfectly cooked. I can't tell you how long it's been since a restaurant has nailed it from start to finish. I will be going back again and again.

The service was extremely slow. The server took way too long to come to the table & take our order. took 20 minutes for the appetizer to arrive (which was pickles olives & nuts ) and THEN about 10 minutes after that drinks showed up. I don't get it. And it wasn't busy either..I'd say it was 25% full.\nThe one thing ordered that was pretty alright was the mussel soup. Not good enough to make me try round 2 though. \n\nBUT whatevers. I wanted so badly for the actual meal to be awesome, but it was \"ehhh\" at best and that is being kind.  We ordered the 1/2 chicken entree. It was basically steamed veggies, with roasted chicken sitting on top of grits. I'm pretty sure there was a hint of rosemary.\n\nI didn't want to stay for dessert..staying for the actual dinner was pushing it.\nI give 2 stars instead of 1 for the ok soup & the ambiance. it was at least cool looking on the inside.", "author": "Brandyy S."}

At least, she thought she made a reservation. Unfortunately, as is wont to happen with her (she is terrible with technology), she didn't actually make the reservation. It was a bit of a scuffle figuring that out once we got there, but the host & hostess were absolutely lovely and wonderful! They got us seated right away (something that I, as a hostess myself,  know can be hard for larger parties) and a cozy table downstairs.\nThen our waitress was FABULOUS! I don't remember her name, but she had cropped black hair and was on the shorter side. She was so sweet and wonderful about everything, really helpful and accommodating when a few of the things we wanted had run out. The service was impeccable, people always wandering by and checking in. Everyone that helped us was totally lovely.\nThe food was all delicious. The oysters were perfect. Two of the mains we had (a pork with asparagus and lamb with grits I believe) were above and beyond. They had the most delicious bread and happily brought us more when we demolished the first plate. The desserts were wonderful, especially these ricotta donuts.\nThe prices throw you for a bit of a loop at first glance, but then you remember tax & tip are included and it's all worth it. I just wish we had thought about leaving an extra tip for our lovely waitress (but 21st birthday celebrations can leave you not thinking the sharpest, haha). They happily called us some cabs at the end, and we're so helpful when my mom realized she had left a bag of presents behind.\nAll in all, a wonderful experience. I'll definitely be raving about it to everyone I know, and coming back soon!", "author": "Maya G."}

The restaurant is beautiful, and the drink menu is fantastic.  I can't recall the name of my bourbon drink, but it was outstanding.  These are small plates of food, so I'd suggest ordering a lot of dishes and sharing.\n\nSea Urchin Deviled Eggs - I hate deviled eggs, but these were awesome.  They don't skimp on the uni at all, and it tasted very fresh.  Amazingly, I would actually order these again.\n\nMiso Pickled Sardines - I really enjoyed this dish, but I did find the sardines a bit on the salty side.\n\nRaw Kampachi - Kampachi is one of my favorites for crudos, so it's hard to go wrong here. Spiced, acidic, nicely seasoned and very fresh.  Delicious.\n\nGrilled Brocollini - Well cooked, but felt more like a vegetable side.  I wouldn't order it again.\n\nHead Cheese - Bar Agricole and I have something in common, we make crispy head cheese.  This preparation was fantastic, and they really utilize the fat from the head.  If you want to try head cheese for the first time, do it here.\n\nArtichoke Soup - The soup was perfect.  The potato and rosemary were subtle flavors, but there were some artichoke pieces in the soup that were undercooked and a bit chewy.\n\nBlack Trumpets - Loved this dish.  The slow cooked egg was great to mix in with the the wheatberries and really brought the dish together, and the trumpets were nicely cooked, cleaned and seasoned.  \n\nRoasted Duroc Pork - My least favorite dish of the night, for only one reason.  The pork was overwhelmingly salty on the outside, but perfectly medium and tender on the inside, yet the inside of the pork was a bit bland.  The complimenting flavors were nice, and if you mixed everything together, the dish was very good.\n\nGreat drinks, fantastic food, and a happy customer who wants to come back soon!", "author": "Nathan B."}

Great imagination, excellent taste and (I'd think) considerable expense went into the design.  Unfortunately, little skill, warmth or effect was in evidence from the perpetually frenzied but terminally indifferent staff.  \n\nWe sat down at 6:15pm on a Thursday, accompanied (thankfully) by two friends with whom we have infinite fun, whatever the circumstances.  Shortly before 7, we finally ordered, not for want of decisiveness but owing to an almost comical reluctance by various servers to give us an ounce of attention.\n\nThe winter chicory salad was a delicious start to the meal, infused with dried fruit and nuts and a tangy but modestly applied dressing.  The portion was slight considering the $13 price tag.  We followed that with a wood-roasted artichoke, farro and fried egg plate, a dish whose swoon-worthy description on the menu couldn't possibly have been matched in the finished product, which was quite tasty albeit not divine.  \n\nFive-star decor, one-star service and three-star food equaled a lush but uneven sensory experience at a languorous pace.  Next time, a new strategy: park myself on the incredible patio and wile the time away with cocktails and a salty-savory olive, nut and pickle plate.", "author": "Derek W."}

Feels like I stepped into a NY bar.It's trendy from the moment you walk in until you're seated and the rest of your experience there. \n\nThe design is very rustic and tavernish. You don't have to worry about parking around there because there's valet parking. The restaurant is very spacious, has beautiful accents of wood, and different areas of seating. The garden courtyard outside is very romantic with heat lamps and a little fountain. The inside is darker with a split bar, booths for 4, and small tables for 2 that are great for dates or small groups. Then there's a back section with larger tables for big groups where I sat with 5 people.\n\nThe execution of our plates were up to par and the service was excellent. We ordered oysters, sardines, asparagus, pasta with manila clams, and dungeness crab. My favorite was the pasta. We couldn't make it to dessert, but the panna cotta looked delicious. There's a great selection of wines and cocktails. I always stick with an old fashioned, and I was still impressed. The ambiance was great and restaurant was happening on a thursday night. \n\nIt's interesting to know this place used to be an industrial plumbing warehouse and is now taken to new aesthetic heights. The only thing Bar Agricole needs is trendy, yet fun music to complement the rest. There definitely needs to be more restaurants with Bar Agricole's design and artsy drinks in SF.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

Great decor -love the outdoor patio just at the entrance way which has herbs+other plants growing in it. Also, like the fact that apart from the main area, there's another subterranean level with windows so that both areas can see each other. Drinks list was disappointingly uninteresting-maybe because I've been spoiled by the Matt, the uber mixologist who used to be at LibraryBar!

The 2nd best dish was the swordfish w radish, bakchoy, sea lettuce in a black tea broth -the broth was very tasty!

Unpleasant\n\n* Sardine Roll Mops - very mushy and bland fish; the dish had a lot of pickled things and tasted mostly of vinegar.  No salt, and the crisp was very bland\n\n* Pork Meatball - best dish of the night; well seasoned, served on a nice piece of bread that soaked up the sauce without getting mushy or soggy.  Very good.\n\n* Yellow corn soup with squash blossoms - decent; a bit one-note.  Tasted like rich, creamy, corn.\n\n* Roasted peppers - such a shame.  There's nothing like roasted peppers, and these unusual varieties had me enticed.  However, the cook chose not to salt these, nor season the runny aoli, resulting in a plate of unseasoned peppers.  For $16.  Such a waste of good product.\n\n* Grilled Squid - Hard to tell if this was actually grilled, but it was COMPLETELY overcooked.  Total rubber.  Not much flavor, either.  Aioli nowhere to be found, nor salt.  Terrible thing to do to a squid.\n\n* Eggplant w/ Marscapone - I hate eggplant, and this dish was actually quite tasty. Unfortunately, it had been cooked to deal and was more of a paste.  Very expensive baby food.\n\n* Sole w/ Capers - never thought I'd wish for capers, but none seemed present and the dish was flavorless.  The fish was cooked to a totally mushy state that it required a spoon to eat.   More babyfood.  The accompanying potatoes were undercooked and under seasoned\n\n* Chicken - Was ok.  At least I got to chew something.  Not a very complex or interesting dish\n\n* Cheese plate - REALLY expecting a lot from this, since it's all local and whatnot.  The cheeses were very mild, and very boring.  Nothing interesting at all, and kind of shocking at $18\n\nIf you are a foodie, and interested in interesting, memorable dishes that you can tell your friends about, STRONG recommendation to avoid.  Regardless of the source of this food, there is nothing well-made, or interesting on the menu, and the preparations do not elevate any dish beyond their descriptions, nor justify the price.\n\nAside from the food, for completeness:\n\n* The service was excellent\n\n* The decor is great\n\n* The menu is organized in a very strange way; the waitress had to spend a fair amount of time indicating which things were \"starter\" sized and which were more appropriate mains.

It's designed by one of her favorite designers here in the city called Aidlin Darling Design.  You really can't tell what's going on in the outside, which I kind of like, but some random modern steel looking building.  Right when you walk inside, I instantly fell in love withe the ceiling light fixtures and the reclaimed whiskey (or wine?) barrel wood panels on the wall. We sat at the bar while we waited for other guests.  The second time I came here with my boyfriend, because I loved it so much the first time, and I wanted to show him this cool place. We also sat at the bar while we waited for our table. The drinks here are really yummy. Reminds me of drinks from Bourbon & Branch's gourmet cocktails.  The bartenders both times were really helpful. \n\nThe first time I came here, I had the spaghetti, which wasn't your typical spaghetti, with spaghetti sauce. It was like Thai style, which was still very good, but different. The second time I came here I had the Grilled yellow fin tuna, which was mouth watering delicious. The service is very good too, the waitress both times were knowledgeable and gave us recommendations. \n \nDefinitely want to come back here with friends and I was thinking of my birthday.  I do want to try out sitting outdoors in their patio which looks really cool too.", "author": "Joanne D."}

Unfortunately my expectations were not met and definitely not exceeded.  \n\nHere is a summary of the experience:\n\nWe got there at 8:20 and we had an 8:45 reservation so we knew we were early.  After checking in and being told that the table would not likely be ready early we decided to get a drink at the bar.  My \"Foxtrot\" was okay but the Ti Punch my date got was much tastier.  Small fancy drinks for $11.  I guess that's typical SF but it still bothers me a bit.  I used my card and paid for the drinks at the bar (this is only noted as it comes up again later).\n\nWe had been at the bar awhile and we noticed it was about 8:55 and the host hadn't said anything.  My date went over to ask and we were told the table was almost finished up.  Fast forward to 9:15 pm and we are still sitting at the bar.  I go over and mention that the reservation is now a half hour late and the host is awkward and strange.  In fact, this was a theme with all of the people that work at this place.  Socially awkward is how I would describe them which is NOT a great trait in a waitress, hostess or bartender.  A few minutes later another awkward girl comes up to walk us to our table.  Obviously we are annoyed at this point that its taken so long.\n\nAfter sitting the waiter was fairly attentive.  We had our menus and he helped answer a few questions I had.  Unexpectedly another (I'm assuming manager) person came out with a complimentary appetizer for our wait.  This was the highlight of our meal.  It was the raw kampachi with radish and it was AMAZING!  I gobbled up that tasty appetizer and we were both appreciative of the nice gesture.  \n\nWe each ordered 1 glass of wine and our main dishes - He had a grilled calamari dish that was very tasty and I had a pasta dish with crab that was okay.  Nothing amazing about my dish.  We asked for the bill and it came with six items.  We had only had 2 glasses of wine and 2 dishes so we noticed right away.  They had charged us for the two drinks at the bar WHICH I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR.  Obviously we had to call the waiter back over and tell him.  \n\nHe brought out the new check eventually (he often disappeared for kind of long periods of time) and then brought us their \"house made tea\" with mint and sage from their garden.  It was honestly hot water with mint and sage leaves floating in it.  Not tea, nothing special and served it small ceramic glasses that had no handles and thus were too hot to pick up (I don't understand such an impractical cup).  \n\nOverall the experience was not that awful but for a nice place with gorgeous decor and ambiance you would think the service would be much better.  Its like they want to be fancy but not and the staff leaves much to be desired.  If they step up the service, portion sizes, and the menu gets a touch better then they have themselves a chance to get to a 4 or 5 star rating.  Don't think I'll be rushing back to try it too soon though...", "author": "Randi M."}

I'm very happy I went back.  It was definitely a different experience the second time around.\n\nTheir cocktail menu is awesome.  Definitely discover it, and not on a night when you have a to work the next morning. ;-)\n\nOur server was Ian, and he was fantastic.  He was attentive and answered all questions.  I never felt like he was in a rush to leave the table.  All drinks and food were served promptly, in fact my husband commented that he's never gotten drinks so quickly at a restaurant, a huge difference than the last time I was there.  Co-owner, Ben, came to the table at the end of dinner to see how everything was and chat with us for a few minutes which was very nice.  All in all, service was on-point, friendly, and super fast.  This was a big change from the first experience I had and was absolutely appreciated.\n\nAs far as food, everything was pretty great.  We started with the smoked trout deviled eggs, which were my favorite dish served- AMAZING.  Get them.  We also had the sardine served with a fennel & sunchoke medley in a yogurt sauce which was different and interesting.  All of the dishes we ordered had strong flavors and unique combinations.  My husband ordered the rabbit sausage for his entree which, now that I think about it, ties for my favorite.  Again, the setting and combination of flavors were surprising and exciting.  Served with polenta, peas and yellow foot mushrooms, it doesn't get more Earthy than this dish.  When I told Ben that dish was my favorite, he said they loved their butcher's house-made sausage so much they decided to open an establishment just for him to make his sausages.  It was a wise choice, Ben.  I had the swordfish entree which, while the fish was slightly over-cooked (it was cut so thin I'm not sure how they could have avoided it), the setting was amazing.  Surrounded by clams, which came with two clams per clam shell- um, hi friends- and swimming, if you will, in a pond of light cream sauce with an ample amount of prosciutto, the fact the the swordfish was slightly over-done really didn't put any damper on my entree experience.  In fact, I joked with the guy who came to clear our dishes that I would like to request a spoon to finish lapping up that sauce like a starving kitten.  Seriously, if I'd been at my house I would have licked the plate.  I don't do dessert so you're on your own there, soldiers.\n\nAll in all, a great experience at Bar Agricole.  When you go, ask to speak with either Thad or Ben.  They are brothers and co-owners, and their level of enthusiasm and genuine care for their customers' experience is a great thing to see in this day and age. They definitely turned me into a fan of Bar Agricole, and I would be happy to return anytime, especially for a Monkey's Gland (you're going to have to go yourself to find out what that is).  ;-)", "author": "Nicole D."}

I don't remember exactly what I got, but I had some sort of brandy cocktail, which tasted pretty good without tasting like it was full of sugar.

OK, we'll just stand here awkwardly in front of the host stand. But, as luck would have it, two seats opened up right next to us at bar, so we sat down. \n\nThe bartender greeted us right away, and things took a turn for the better. We tried a couple of drinks, and it was clear why all the talk about this beverage program. The groovy square ice cubes and house-made tinctures really do make a difference. The bartender's charming demeanor was disarming, and his obvious knowledge of and passion for cocktails was contagious. We actually had two more for dessert.\n\nWe ordered Marin myagi oysters, which were perfectly shucked and delish. Be warned, plates here are very small. The marinated anchovies with purslane and some sort of bread crisp were a clear miss as were the deep-fried mussels with flat-tasting aioli. The squid was very good with tiny tomatoes and what looked like sun-dried tomatoes but tasted like smoked paprika, and the duck breast, although a solid medium on its way to medium-well, was very tasty with the potatoes and sunchokes. \n\nI thought that the bottle of pinot noir rose from the Loire was a great value at $36, but the overall bill of $204 = not on the list for dinner again.

If you're into architecture, I suppose it's worth at least checking out for a drink.\n\nBut everything else was just...ugh. We were there for a friend's birthday. My boyfriend and I were instantly dismayed by the prices. We opted to split an entree - chicken with \"figs\", but really just one measly fig cut in half. Not bad chicken, but for $30 (yes you read that right), you expect something amazing. And it most definitely wasn't.\n\nWe also opted to get the cheese platter ($18) to split with our group. What they brought was so measly, so thrown-together-looking, I momentarily thought they'd scraped the leftovers from another table's cheese platter onto a new plate. It was barely enough for 2 people to split, let alone 6. And 18. Friggin. Dollars. \n\nThe alcohol portions were pathetically small too. I ordered a *glass* of wine, not a taste. And in retrospect, that's what I should've told our server.\n\nWhich brings me to the service: so slow, disengaged and lackadaisical as to be nearly nonexistent. My Roomba could've done the job better.\n\nAnd to top things off, Bar Agricole apparently doesn't believe in turning on lights. OK, so you're LEED Gold certified. How nice for you.

Yuck.  Either dress up that table somehow (make it bar-height and add a wall sconce, maybe?) or kill it.  It sucks.\n\nThe people were okay, but not great.  My gf didn't like the hostess and our waitress wasn't very friendly at first, although I liked her better after she offered an extra candle for our table out in the heart of darkness.  Also, having to wait through a couple of stop-start attempts at seating us when we arrived on time for our reservation was a little odd.\n\nThe menu was a little spare, too.  Interesting dishes, to be sure, but none of the apps really grabbed us, the cocktails were almost all based on dark liquors (whiskey and its cousins), and they only had 2 (normal-sized) beers.  We ordered wood-roasted asparagus with fried eggs and spaghetti with lamb sausage, mint, and fava beans.  Both were good, but we only got 3 stalks of asparagus for $23, and the plate was too salty.  The spaghetti was better, pretty delicious really.  No complaints there.\n\nDessert was good, a Meyer lemon ricotta tart, although the \"lavender meringue\" tasted more like homemade marshmallow and was overwhelmingly sweet for the nicely tart tart.  But still, pretty good.\n\nOverall, not my favorite dining experience.  Not bad, but you can do better for the money.", "author": "Ira P."}

You didn't bother to reserve a table anywhere? You want me to find one?\n\nUh, sure. No problem? Just let me open my browser here, *click* OpenTable, *click* *click* *click*. Hey, there's a 7pm table for 4 at Bar Agricole. Score! Maybe someone cancelled. Hmmmm... need a credit card to reserve... $50/person if you cancel. That's odd. Oh well. \n\nShow up at 7pm, the front patio area is empty but all set up. Maybe for a NYE bash that will start later? I love the wood decor and the somewhat dimly lit ambiance. It's fairly quiet, but there's anticipation in the air, as people seem to be enjoying a calm meal before ringing in the new year. \n\nTurns out there's a prix-fixe 5-course NYE menu. Gotta roll with it. For four people, it's a bit of a waste because you only have 2 choices for each course except for the entree (3 choices), so you only get to try 2 things/course. The servers and front of the house staff are all very pleasant and look surprisingly happy to be working new year's eve. \n\nSo before I get into the food, I have to pay special compliments to the 'mixologists' they have here. I knew Bar Agricole was known for its cocktails, so I tried a few. They were outstanding. Interesting flavors mixed together, but still able to stand up against each other. Brown Derby with bourbon, grapefruit, honey, lemon and bitters was excellent, as were the Mary Pickford and El Presidente. Everyone at the table was duly impressed. I could definitely see myself spending a whole night here hanging out in the patio area trying all the cocktails. \n\nOk, so the food (I'll just highlight some of the dishes)\n\n1) Chestnut soup: Nice creamy soup infused with a great chestnut flavor.\n2) Artichoke barigoule with fried mussels: Artichoke hearts were tender, well-dressed, and had good flavor. The fried mussels were a good accompaniment in both taste and texture to the dish. \n3) Petrale sole with Dungeness crab: Excellent, probably my favorite dish of the night. Exceptionally fresh chunks of Dungeness crab meat, well cooked and didn't need much to highlight the flavor of the crabmeat. Only drawback was a few small bits of shell in the dish.\n4) Barley and wild mushrooms in Matsutake broth: Another great dish with several types of wild mushrooms ( I only remember trumpets for sure) in a very tasty broth. \n5) Lamb loin: Well cooked, juicy, flavorful. \n\nI was not the biggest fan of the dessert, some persimmon, absinthe semifreddo dessert, but the chocolate tart was good. \n\nThey also must go through a ton of silverware, because they change it out after each course. The server said the chefs like to make sure the diner starts anew with each course so there's no carryover of flavors from one course to the next. That made sense. The timing on the meal probably could have been faster, though. For a prix-fixe menu, you expect that since the kitchen has fewer dishes to contend with, things would come out quicker, but our meal spread out over 2.5 hours. Your ass starts getting a little sore on those wooden benches. But maybe they were expecting people to linger over their meal. \n\nOverall a great meal, although at a premium price. I would come back for the cocktails and to try out some of their dishes off the regular menu.", "author": "Saunders C."}

All I could taste was the burned char on the bottom of it which really ruined the dish since I could not taste the other flavors. I can't stand when restaurants do this- send burnt stuff out. If this hadnt been the case, they would've gotten 4 stars despite a few other issues. The best thing we tried were the fried maitake mushrooms. So delicious and perfectly lightly battered and fried. The oysters were fresh and delicious. We had several other dishes, all good enough but nothing to rave about. My only other suggestion would be to skip the dark chocolate cake- it was the driest cake I've ever been served at a restaurant... Really disappointing. The other desserts made with in season fruit were very good. The cocktails were potent so not sure about other reviews saying they skimped on alcohol- not the case at our visit.

We had AWESOME starters (the housemade bread + yogurt + harissa + herbs were amazing), in addition to gulf fried shrimp with beats and a salad. I had the pasta with clams which was incredibly small, and probably should have been half the cost it was even if it did have tip included (also I found a rock included with the clams...how did that get missed?) based on how little they serve you, but the taste itself was great. I tried some of the other dinners that were served and cannot say that i disliked a single one of them!\nTheir drinks were fine, but not for $15 a pop. We tried the scotch sour, tulip, and 'ti punch. I would skip these and stick to a bottle of wine next time, they weren't as memorable as they have been hyped up to be.\nOur server, who was very nice in person, was very forgetful and overwhelmed. I loved the idea of having tip included in everything so you don't have to think about it (I've worked tons of service jobs and hated it when someone just had a bad day and decided it was your fault for making it worse for existing), but honestly the service was pretty horrendous. It took 15 minutes for us to get drinks after we ordered, and while the food came out fairly timely, we ended up skipping our after dinner drinks because they did not come out within 10 minutes of the dessert. We arrived at 6:45 and didn't leave until around 9:15 due to the lengthy intervals of time in-between waiting to hear from our waitress, and would have liked to have been out within 2 hours. \nAll in all, this place has good food, but it is inflated in prices, the service (which is really what you are paying for) is not up to par to make up for such high costs of food, and overall really needs to be revamped to reflect the costs that are going in. If I am going to pay for a $30 plate of pasta, I would hope it a) wouldn't contain rocks, b) is at least more than the appetizer plate size (which were already small, and it was the same size), and c) comes in a timely manner. I probably won't be back as I don't think it was worth the cost, but if you have a ton of $$ to blow and don't mind the prices, the food is definitely worth checking out at least once.", "author": "Maija W."}

There is a very nice outdoor patio area which I'm sure would be packed on a Friday/Saturday night.  I agree it is loud inside but not obnoxious.  Menu is a simple one-pager.  None of the drinks actually appealed to me since most is mixed with bourbon or brandy.  \n\nMy 4 star rating is actually for the broccolini spaghetti dish I ordered.  Light, good portion for someone who wasn't starving, and it was just buttery deliciousness.  They used a thicker spaghetti noodle but it wasn't dense.  The whole dish was very light and the broccolini was chopped into really small pieces.\n\nWe also ordered the pork pate and Frito Misto (lightly fried seafood).  I could have done without the pork pate.  The pate was very loosely packed so it was hard to spread on the over-toasted toast.  The Frito Misto for the night was fried mussels and it was pretty tasty.  There was maybe 4 pieces of mussels total and the rest were fried onion (rings), squash, and fish.  I really like the aioli sauce.  It was really subtle and not overwhelming.  The light batter didn't make me feel super guilty about eating fried foods.\n\nOverrall, some decent dishes, great service but pricey.

As we walked in, the modern architecture and spacious front had me feeling that I was not in the middle of the mission, sf.\n\nI heard that they recently raised their prices- the main entree dishes were almost $30 a dish.  Granted, I do not mind paying $30 for a dish, but at thoseprices you can reasonably expect certain things regarding service/food/etc, several of which bar agricole was lacking.\n\nWe ordered the liver and pate- having read on yelp that these were some of the best dishes here, we didn't want to pass on these apps.  I am not a liver/pate fan, but my boyfriend loved the dish and said it was one of the best he tried.\n\nWhen we were done with our apps, we had to remind the bartender to take our entree orders.  He seemed really busy making those fancy drinks and he definitely needed some help.  The bar was hectic and crowded, but there were so many empty seats in the restaurant- I guess I'd say make a reservation or else you'll get stuck in the situation we were in.\n\nOur entrees took a while to come.  We ordered the short rib plate and the pork loin.  The pork loin was good, but the cuts were thin and the greens didn't really have anything special going on.  I would have traded that dish for the pork chop at NOPA in a heart beat.  The short ribs (meat itself) were ok- the meat was cooked to the point that it fell of the bone, but the greens that came with them were an absolute disaster.  They were extremely, extremely bitter and pretty much inedible.  Granted that they were half the plate, we eneded up wasting half of the dish.\n\nI really do want to like Bar Agricole- the space is beautiful and would make an amazing summertime brunch spot.  But with prices like that, there is no room for error, really.  Being that they're a relatively new restaurant, hopefully they can work out the kinks of the menu.", "author": "Clarissa P."}

This place had all the potential to be a knockout restaurant but there were so many small things wrong...\nFirst off, this is a pricey restaurant. There's nothing wrong with a premium joint being expensive, but the price point does raise the bar on the experience you expect.\nMenu: short, focused, and appealing. Something for everyone's picky preferences and well-described.\nDrinks: 4 cocktails, all nicely prepared. But at $15 per drink I expect an amazing drink. They were small and ungarnished, and a super-premium brand of liquor wasn't specified in the description, so I'm not sure where all the money went.\nAppetizers: Flatbread w/ squash & zaatar (really excellent), pickled carrots (tasty but seriously overpriced), citrus salad w/ beets (just sliced oranges w/ beets; no real value-add by the chef)\nMains: Trout & Lentils (wow!), Roast chicken (ordinary and expensive), spaghetti with chard & clams (very nice but not a large portion considering we ordered the \"larger sized\" portion)\nDesserts: Maybe the best part of the meal - tasty, generous, and fun\nWine: Nice selection and surely something for every taste\nDining room: Beautiful -- there's an outside area, a bar area, and the architecture is gorgeous. However, the booth we were in had very hard flat benches and all of our butts fell asleep during our meal.\nService: This was my biggest complaint -- servers were fine but not nearly what you expect at a place of this caliber. They stumbled on their overly-rehearsed descriptions of the dishes, they couldn't answer simple questions about the dishes, they were totally unhelpful with recommendations, seemed generally inexperienced at working fine-dining places. And they botched a simple 2-way split of the check to two credit cards. Not a big deal under normal circumstances but this is a high-end place and there's no excuse for not having really good service.\n\nConclusion: This place could be a really amazing destination.

What a cheap ass...if red wine was spilled on me during dinner I would not have been as cool as my friend.  Not to mention, we almost ordered everything on the menu as well as an expensive bottle of merlot AND he spilled the bottle I brought.  Well, aside from that...food & ambiance were great. Service and management...well if you're trying to attract foodies who will gladly spend more $$$, try not being so cheap yourselves!  \n\nVenting aside, the food and the decor of this place is pretty awesome.  The highlights for the food were the liver pate, brick chicken, crab salad & the fried smelt.  I'm looking forward to coming back. Apparently the menu is changed quite often.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-04-04", "description": "My barfly-iest homegirl was in town on business, and for her first meal in SF, I wanted to take her someplace with a similar vibe to the places we hung out when I lived in Boston - artisanal cocktails, ultra-fresh market-driven food, etc.  I'd never actually been to Bar Agricole, but it was the only place on my short list that appeared to have an opening for Friday night at about 4 PM Friday afternoon, and the hype seemed to be generally good, so I decided to give it a shot.\n\nWe showed up about 30 minutes early for our 9:45 PM reservation with the intention of grabbing a drink at the bar first (the most civilized way to start dinner, in my humble opinion), but when a couple of seats opened up and we realized how very convivial the atmosphere was up front, we asked the host if we could stay there instead of taking our table and he happily obliged.\n\nThe drinks were really spectacular.  My friend and I are typically bourbon drinkers, and the cocktail list didn't feature a wide array of whiskey cocktails, but Craig concocted us several delicious beverages off-menu, and also gave us samples of a few different ingredients (one of the rhum agricoles and some sort of fortified wine if memory serves, which, if I'm being honest, by the end of the evening it kind of wasn't).  We each had one cocktail miss, but Craig was very accomodating in both cases and just mixed us up something we liked better, which we greatly appreciated.\n\nThe food was also by and large tremendous.  We started with the radishes and butter (one of my favorite French treats), an order each of oysters (as a native New Englander, Kumamotos are not my very favorite, but it's not like I've ever met an oyster I didn't want to eat), and the chopped liver on toast, which was absolutely positively amazing, approximately seven times as good as you would ever imagine chopped liver could be.  Then my friend had the mackerel, which judging from her clean plate was a winner, and I had the squid ink pasta, which was briny and cooked perfectly al dente (which is one criterion I get severely judgmental about).  For dessert, we split the bittersweet chocolate tart - it, naturally, was incredible, and it is actually probable that the crust and not the filling was the best part, buttery and crumbly.\n\nMaybe my perspective is totally skewed, because a large proportion of the reviews here seem to be complaining about the expense, but I thought it was pretty inexpensive - approximately $120 for about six or seven drinks plus all that food, which is by no means highway robbery.  Not to mention, the portions, while not what you would expect to see at, say, Chili's, were not completely insubstantial - I mean, neither of us could manage a dessert of our own.  I thought it was a pretty good value considering the quality.\n\nAs many have noted, the space is absolutely gorgeous, and I'm looking forward to coming back on a warm night to sit on the patio.\n\nOverall, I'd give it four and a half stars, and while I'd normally round down, especially after a first visit, given all the bad reviews here by people who like, never even got in the door, I'm rounding up. Five stars on a technicality!", "author": "Renee G."}

The tongue is sliced thin--great for people like me averse to the texture of tongue (when eating only, of course). The carrot slaw provided a nice creamy element.\n\nA really well-heeled crowd.

Bar Agricole is one of four restaurants who has decided to add 25% service charge to all their price points! Food and wine!  That's right! And if you miss that 5 pt. type a the bottom of the mini menu (\"Service included\"), you're likely over-tipping. I returned to this restaurant for my third time because it was great for larger parties (6+). They would serve you a prix fix family style meal that was easy, didn't have to think about what to order and a good value. That's now been up to parties of 10+ . But I was shocked to hear this on my third visit that  the 25% charge is applicable to everyone! Even if you're dining alone! Think about it: a $100 bottle of wine costs $125 because 5% is for the waiters health union (fine) and 20% is service!! (NOT fine). I asked the server and she said they hope SF will eventually migrate to this standard. I sure as hell hope not. As for me? Not going back until they do away with this silly policy.

For the tequila drinkers, there was a special drink on the menu (wish I could remember the name) that we really liked as well - it had a kick.\n\nWe liked all of our dishes.  Standouts were the stuffed zucchini blossoms and the pork.  I thought the roasted salmon was going to be boring (the menu description made it sound like a dish you could get anywhere), but it just came together so well and the fish was melt-in-your-mouth.  The mustard greens with figs and goat cheese came out well - the figs were perfectly ripe.\n\nOne complaint - it might have been nice to have a bit of bread to soak up the sauces on the plates.  We asked for it, but only 2 pieces came for the 5 of us.\n\nDessert - if you have room, the buttermilk panna cotta is a must try.  Ours came with a strawberry rhubarb compote and a tiny madeleine that was huge on flavor.  \n\nThe coffee was just fine.  If you like herbal tea at all, order it here!

Every time my partner and I come, we've always been served by Craig (honestly, I don't want to be served by anyone else). We ask a lot of questions about liquor because we genuinely want to know and he always answers our questions with knowledge and patience.

There are heat lamps to keep you warm on our chilly city of fog--don't worry ;).\n\nThe sustainable architecture is phenomenal, with wine barrel slats lining the walls, a bar made with wood from an old barn, and these inspired, beautiful bent glass tube chandeliers that look like they are swaying from an imaginary breeze.  the wall behind the bar shelves is taken up by huge blown up panoramic photographs of shots from the streets of SF, making it feel like you are looking through a window to the SF street from this architectural oasis of rural boozecraft.\n\nThere's a private dining room at the side, with a cask-of-amontillado type feel with candles in alcoves.  And a back door opening onto Juniper street (aptly named, given the amount of gin available at the bar).  They also have a coffee bar in the middle, for you coffee snobs out there (and I know there are plenty of you in SF).\n\nThe cocktail menu, designed by Thad and Eric, the co-owners, satisfies experts in cocktail craftsmanship, dabblers, and newbies alike.  Most of the cocktails consist entirely of booze of various sorts, with delicious fortified wines like the cocchi americano and falernum.\n\nSome of my favorites:\n-the Goat's Delight, a sweet creamy cocktail with locally crafted orgeat.  \n-the Moonraker, a twist on the Vesper martini, brandy and peach whiskey with the cocchi americano.  this is Roger Moore's Bond's Vesper.\n-the White Dog Cocktail, using the white dog distilled from IPA beer mash from a local microbrew. \n-(off the menu) ask for a true Vesper Martini. With the cocchi americano, they make it like Mr. Bond (ie Ian Fleming) intended it.  The cocchi is a fortified muscat wine with quinine in it, so it tastes like the kina lillet that was in the original recipe, which is no longer available.\n\nBut really, they know what they're doing here, so anything on the menu is good.\n\nI've only had a few appetizers to snack on while drinking, and they were all good.  Will have to review the food some other time.", "author": "Fong L."}

We happily found two comfortable vintage science class style chairs waiting for us. Our first rounds were Bar Agricole standards, My second was a personal request, perfectly fulfilled by a dapper mustached bartender, who not only created a satisfying libation, but proceeded to give me a quick background on the drinks history. He is not a mixocologist, he is a real bartender. A throwback to the days of strict professionalism and craft, a cask of liquid knowledge, presented in an unpretentious love-of-the-craft style.

For my main, I ordered the grilled squid with white beans and olives.  My friends enjoyed the spaghetti with tomato, and the steak.  I thought the food was very good as was the wine.

First of all the plates are relatively small - definitely not family style.  We ordered 8-9 plates and all left seeking a second dinner.  Also, the food is very over-priced and nothing to write home about.  The artichokes were very undercooked, the seafood was not fresh, and nothing gave us the \"wow\" factor.  Then to top it all off, we ordered a bottle of wine.  The waitress didn't deliver the bottle of wine until AFTER we finished our dinner....about 45 minutes after we ordered it.

Of note is that this nook within SOMA has some great bars and night clubs with a 'not so typical' crowd; you'll have to just go see for yourself, but we were sold after a great pre-dinner cocktail at Butter in where there was a whitney houston tribute party being hosted, 'oh i wanna drink with somebody' - i didn't know so many bearded plad shirts knew the words to 'how will I know' - lol. \n\nAnyway, we headed over to bar agricole afterwards, and we were not as impressed as we would have liked to be. We've gone there before just for 'a drink' - I know, I am sensing the theme here as well - and we were disappointed before. Sadly, this recent trip was no different. \n\nFrankly, it takes absolutely too long to get a drink. The mixologists who designed the drink menu have apparently made the recipes too arduous to mix; and art, without great execution, is oftentimes only of value to the artist. This place looks absolutely fantastic inside and out. And the only thing better than experiencing a fantastic bar scene, is actually being there with a fantastic drink. However, unfortunately, no matter the size of the crowd, these guys struggle quite a bit with timely delivery. \n\nI would love to be able to say that the food is different, but again, sadly I can't. The menu was too eclectic; poached, aquatic, ungrounded. Not to be crass, but generally people look for hardier foods when they are drinking; drinking 'specialty' cocktails is no exception. Also of note is that, like the drinks, the food took too long to come. \n\nOne other thing worth commenting on is that the staff RUSHed around quite a bit; and rushing without results is frustrating to watch. \n\nI do like the concept of bar agricole. I also love what it is doing for the neighborhood. So, all in all, I might go back for a drink some time, but I will certainly make sure that I set aside a lot of time to do it.", "author": "Dahvie J."}

From starters, I would totally recommend the pork deep-fried meatballs-one of the most delicious things I've tried in my life! Only let down was the wine list.

I found the whole encounter incredibly disrespectful and unprofessional.\n\nTo add insult to injury, he wanted $1,250 just for apps and bartender service for our party before we even started talking about how much we would drop on drinks, and this is for the outdoor patio in the middle of winter. He apparently wanted to get paid for foregone food revenue from the patio. Really? How many patrons would realistically be dining on that cold patio after 9pm in winter?

I would have eaten it until bursting. \n\nThe cocktails, as many have mentioned, are excellent. I only wish I had not also ordered a bottle of wine with the main courses and stuck to cocktails, and I'm a big wine guy. That's how solid they are. \n\nWe had a cheese plate which the server recommended that was simply dreadful.

It was probably one of the saltiest things I have ever eaten. So salty I actually think that our dish must have been a fluke by the kitchen because there is no way anyone could have eaten that.

But then again as I said earlier, we are novice cocktail drinkers.\n\nThe  food was quite good.  The menu changes frequently.  The standouts were the milk braised pork (tender well season pieces of pork in rich broth served with white beans) and hand-cranked pasta with pesto (the texture of the pasta was so spot on).  Our server even mimed to us how the chef hand-cranks the pasta, so cute.  And the peach upside down cake with lavender ice cream was amazing.

What was important was that the food got there. \n\nThen we got the croissant with loquat butter we ordered again, thank you to the baby Jesus, and again no drinks yet.

And so was the corned beef brisket with poached egg and mustard hollandaise, very delectable. Definitely enough to share, along with the other items we had.\n\nThe food was good, the service was pretty good, the place was nice and the reason I only gave 3 stars was the idea of how long it took for us to get noticed and have attention paid to us, and also how long the cocktails took...and since I work in a restaurant I know sitting at a table and a drink taking 15-20 minutes, no matter how gourmet-avant-garde-pre-prohibition-whatever it is, is too long to wait.

I was shocked to find out that such a modern, spacious restaurant was squatting  next to the 11th Street ho-hummy spots (need not mention names but um \"Butter\").  Me like-y.  \n\nYet, Bon App failed me on one thing.  The cocktails' were all great (I loved my Pisco Sour and I'm a connoisseur of Pisco Sours so it pretty officially checks off ... oh they also chisel their own cubes of ice for \"on the rocks\" type drinks - quite impressive), but the bar's not really conducive to a crowd.  It's just hard to mingle around it when it's blocking traffic coming into the restaurant.  \n\nSo, here's my rec:  go when it's a little less crowded, hang out at the bar on a bar chair OR go when it's nice(r) outside, (they have a huge outdoor area, which I wasn't able to experience b/c of the cold and lack of heat lamps but am dying to go back to).  The foodstuffs on the menu looked lovely, but didn't try them, (yet).  One gripe (hence the 4 not 5 stars): the bathroom was untidy (no soap left, eck!)  \n\nOne final token - I didn't know what Agricole actually was until visiting this bar - so for a little schooling it's a rum from the French West Indies that is distilled from sugar cane.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-05", "description": "After having a drink at the bar, I joined 5 lady friends for a midweek dinner at Bar Agricole. I tried the Long Rhum Buck ($10) w/ ginger and lime which I really enjoyed. It's nice to have a selection of rum cocktails to choose from as I'm not really a brown spirits kind of girl. As with other haute cocktail parlors around town, be prepared to wait as they craft your beverage, these things don't happen in a snap. \n\nBar Agricole is quite spacious and unlike most other SF restaurants, there are a lot of booths and plenty of space between the tables. They stuck our group of 6 ladies in the farthest booth. It kind of felt like we were in Siberia until the other tables filled up, but we were able to be somewhat rowdy and not disturb the other diners. We started off with more cocktails, the Ti Punch is basically a large shot with a giant cube of ice in it (reminded me of having drinks with glacial ice), the Brandy Fix was somewhat sweet but fun and bubbly, and the Brooklyn was a bit masculine for me, heavy on the whiskey. \n\nFor food, we were able to work our way through most of the menu, sharing everything. We started with the French breakfast radishes ($4) served with the greens still attached, the puntarelle w/ endive and bagna cauda ($13), and the burdock, celery root, and fuyu persimmon slaw ($13). I was a little taken aback with the price point of the salads. While each of these salads were fresh with quality produce, they didn't showcase any super high end ingredients to merit that kind of price. They were sized appropriately for sharing with 2-4 people but still, $13 for slaw? That's almost 1/3 more than salads at other similar caliber establishments. \n\nAfter the salad courses, we moved on to the spaghetti w/ crab and Brussels sprouts ($16), a very seasonally apropos combination and quite a large portion. We also tried the delicious, moist and giant polpettone served with a grilled crostini ($18), the braised pork belly w/ clams ($24), and the pork shoulder stew with hominy ($26). Good thing that we ordered almost every piece of pork on the menu for the start of Hanukkah! \n\nThe pork belly and clams was by far the best dish of the night! For an ingredient that is all over town right now, it takes a lot to stand out. I have to admit that I did not want to share this dish and will most likely return for it. The skin was crackling and perfectly crisp, the fat indulgently rich, and the meat meltingly tender. A perfect dish for the cold snap we've been having. \n\nWe finished with the cheese plate ($15) which was unceremoniously plunked down on the table without any cheese identification. By that point, our server seemed annoyed with us. We were able to ID most of the cheeses, and called her back to ask about the unknown cheese. Instead of IDing all the cheeses, she just said what the name of the cheese in question was and walked away. I know that tables of ladies sometimes get a bad rap, but we still tipped over 20% and ordered a fair amount of food and booze, especially for a Wednesday night. I was rather put off by server's attitude. We all commented on how it would have been nice if the share plates were slightly larger than the small saucers we were eating off. At the very least, they could have changed out the plates once or twice as they were rather mucked up after 6 or so dishes.\n\nOverall, I felt like the prices were 10-20% higher than they needed to be and that some of the dishes were just ok. It's definitely a fabulous space for groups and warm weather but it will be interesting to see if they are able to make it work in the long term.", "author": "Candice L."}

We were pleasantly ushered in, going by two unoccupied booths for four, and were taken downstairs to, albeit a less noisy area, a cold, sterile space that housed four large tables and was adjacent to the kitchen??  At no point during dinner were any other patrons seated downstairs; we are an \"older\" group, maybe seating us on the main floor where the action was would have been bad for marketing??? \nOur server was a young woman, pleasant enough if not totally attentive.  For appetizers, our friends ordered a salad and we ordered vegetable fritters.  Our fritters arrived, and were very tiny.  I cut one open and didn't see anything that looked like any facsimile of a vegetable.  I took a thankfully very small bite, at which point I put my fork down, turned to my husband and wondered aloud what I was eating.  At this point, our server returned and my husband asked about the fritters.  She dismissively explained there were two types of fritters, one vegetable and one pigs ears(?) and what we had was the pigs ears.  Since I am a vegetarian and tend to react physically (not in a good way) to pork, I was upset by this information, not to mention this was NOT WHAT WE'D ORDERED! We reminded our server of our order for vegetable fritters, and she blithely commented \"oh I guess the kitchen made a mistake, I'll get the other ones.\"  No apology, just kind of oh well, ho hum, who cares.  \nWhile our spaghetti entree with brussel sprouts and truffles was very good (but a little pricey at $33), my enthusiasm for the food given the fritters episode and apparent lack of concern for the error was quite dampened.\nThe check arrived and, not surprisingly, we were charged for everything.  I guess I naively imagined that because an error in our order had been made, we might have been comped for something, dessert, wine? Nope. \nClearly, they don't need our patronage, but I would have expected a restaurant at their level to put a tad more energy into attentiveness to and concern about the customer's dining experience.  Disappointingly, that was very much not the case, and it's unlikely we will be making a return visit.", "author": "susan m."}

Unfortunately it was a big disappointment.  I was somewhat skeptical after reading reviewers comments about the size of the plates relative to price.  I've been to my share of overpriced small plates restaurants, so I figured it would be worth a try.  \n\nThe food was just sad.  There was nothing exciting about any of the food to make it worth paying at least twice what the food would be worth at any other restaurant.  We started with the $15 cheese plate.  $15 seems pretty normal for a cheese plate, but this cheese plate was boring.  It arrived with three different kinds of cheeses (unspecified) and a few pieces of crisped bread.  No acoutrements, no description of the cheese.  Prior to ordering we had also joked that the $16 plate of peppers was probably similar to the padron peppers with sea salt I've had everywhere recently for like $5-$8.  I asked the server expecting a description of something more elaborate, but our initial sarcasm was quickly justified when she explained that it was a few different kinds of peppers with a light \"pesto\".  \n\nWe had the chicken galantin, corn pudding and squash blossom.  The pudding and squash were tasty, but again, uninspired.  The only normal portion was the pudding, which was very rich.  We started with these dishes and quickly decided to end dinner early and go find something more substantial - dinner number 2.\n\nThe only redeeming factor is the nice outdoor courtyard and relatively tasty drinks.  \n\nI feel bad because this place is not going to make it very long as they currently exist.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-02-19", "description": "I met up with a large-ish group (8 of us) at Bar Agricole for a friendly business dinner.  We were seated downstairs near the kitchen, in a room with a number of large tables.  The service had started for the other members of the party present when we arrived, and we were quickly caught up with drinks and appetizers.  The major drawback of this location in the restaurant was the deafening volume.  It was impossible to have a conversation without shouting - the bare walls and ceiling made every sound reverberate, and it was unenjoyable. \n\nThe cocktails menu was diverse, and a friend had said he believed that anything ordered would be delicious.  I ordered a Long Rhum Buck, and didn't care for the taste at all.  I thought it was me, but two others tasted it and also thought it was off.  I followed up with another cocktail - the Turf Club - and noticed it wasn't as good as the one I'd just tasted that a friend had ordered.  There didn't seem to be consistency in the drink making.  Some of the other members of the party enjoyed their drinks however (and I tasted a few - they were better than what I'd ended up with).\n\nWe had the pickles to start, which were indeed pickled, but all of which tasted the same (as opposed to other restaurant's pickles, where the veggies are pickled in separate solutions giving a larger flavor profile).  \n\nThe menu itself wasn't well designed, so a number of people wound up ordering what turned out to be tiny appetizers for their mains, and the serving staff didn't mention this, which made it awkward when half the food showed up 20 minutes before the rest of the entrees.  \n\nThe chicory salad was a joke - it seriously had 8 leaves of chicory, which were large, and so tough that the person seated next to me (who had thought it would be enough for her dinner) gave up eating it halfway through the meal.\n\nI had the mushroom tart, which was good, but TINY.  It came with 10 sprigs of arugula, and while they were nice, I definitely was starving when I left. (I wanted the chicken, but couldn't contend with eating something that comes with a foot attached to it - I'd seen the chicken+foot on someone's plate on the way in, and it didn't look tasty).  \n\nMy boyfriend and another coworker ordered the potato leek soup, which they said was good - although not as good as homemade.\n\nTwo others in the party ordered the crab salad, which was laughably small, and had very little crab in it.\n\nHonestly, I've eaten at some of the best restaurants in the US, and I have no problem dropping stacks of cash on delicious food, but this was a total letdown.  My boyfriend said that with a party of 8, we could have ordered the entire menu twice, and still been hungry when we left.  I'd have to agree.  I'm not heading here again if I can avoid it.", "author": "Kim S."}

I have been a few times with my boyfriend and have always had the best experience. \nEverything from the wine selection to the food to the service is EXCELLENT! At first I was a little skeptical because they did have some unique looking dishes. However, I was pleasantly surprised. Their menu is constantly changing because they only serve things  that are in season so everything is really fresh.\n\n Last time we went we ordered the rabbit, the eggplant, a starter salad with the BEST stracciatella (that I can't remember the name of since the menu is always different) and a botte of the Benito Santos Albarino. Both dishes were rich in flavor, cooked to perfection and so fresh! It was seriously one of the best dinners I've ever had, hands down.Both times the server was extremely informed about the menu and very friendly. They give great recommendations and will tell you the truth if you ask. \n\nThe atmosphere is also nice. It's very modern inside with valted, high cielings, cement floors and a candle lit on each table.It has a very lofty kind of feel which I like. It has a long bar when you walk in and really cool looking patio in front that I've never had the pleasure of sitting on because it has been raining and/or cold.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-30", "description": "This could have been a five star review, except for the 35 minute wait for our table. Even with a reservation and arriving 10 minutes early.  Open Table, take note....  The hostess (maitre d'ess?) kept her cool throughout the overwhelmed evening (Evidence: several clusters of guests received comped appetizers/drinks when finally seated).  I don't think it due to incompetent staff or kitchen, Rather, the dining experience is phenomenal.  Many tables lingered, soaking in the the amazing industrial rustic room, the deft service (once you get to your table) and the heady yumness turned out by the kitchen.  Observations one and two won't keep a restaurant in business, so the food will always be the killer app (so to mangle businesses).\n\nBar Agricole's Killer App is the intense, flavorful rustic take on classic cuisine. Call it California with Northern Mediterranean (which could be a bit redundant). The menu is more than seasonal, since dishes change based on what is available and fresh (or that's the PR story).\n\nRegardless, what arrives at the table is impeccable in terms of provenance. Our chopped liver was served up on massive toast points (really just toast). The bread from a local baker (didn't get the name), but someplace in Provence, they are crying....The liver, not like your jewish grandmothers (okay, my grandmother was just evil, not jewish, but..)  Velvet texture (liver color, but well, that's a given).\n\nThe beer/wine by the glass selections are top notch (and selected, I believe, to complement the kitchen's style of cooking).  Yumness begats Yumness.  The appetizer labeled 'Pickles\" turns out to be a plate of pickled root vegetables, light on the vinegar, heavy on the vegetable origin.  The cauliflower was the best, high bright sharpness and super crunchy.  The beets were deep, sweet but not the sliced-from-a-can foulness you experience during holiday dinners.\n\nMy friend, J, opted for vegetable dishes: haricot verts and fingerling potatoes served in a mustard creme fraiche and a chanterelles over a celery slaw.   Again, the freshness of the produce only served to emphasize the kitchen's skill with enhancing the food with sauces and techniques. \nMy lamb and sausages over cannelli beans and chicories ruled the meat throne.  The sausages were house-made (loved the touch of anise in the ground meat) and perfect with the beans/chicories.  \n\nWe split a dessert, pulling the singles girls on the town routine.... Really, we were just stuffed and drunk...  Chevre cheesecake sprinkled with roasted hazelnuts.  Again, yumness (sqrd).\n\nOur waiter was super, offering up tidbits on the dishes, approach to the food, a super cute hipster waiter boy kept our 'sparkling' waters full (that's not an entrendre, he was just quick with the refills...)\n\nThere was great conversation, even with the next table (how often does that happen?). By the time I looked at my watch, it was 11:00.  2.5 hours, counting the aggravating wait simple melted away in the presence of great food, good friends and a stunning bottle of 'basic' red.  (another time).\n\nThis restaurant is also a relative bargain, given the integrity of the ingredients used in the both the artisanal cocktails and the menu.  I do not hesitate to recommend Bar Agricole.  Just make sure you've got extra time built into your schedule, as the tables don't turn over quick enough, but, after last night's dining experience, who could blame them..", "author": "philip c."}

We ordered several cocktails, started with a salad and fried okra with house-made aioli and split a skate-cheek & squash gnocchi and a lamb sausage.\n\nFirst things first, the decor' is phenomenal.  One entire side of the restaurant is covered in refurbished oak slats from old wine barrels that also cover a soffit (false ceiling) high above part of the dining room.  The glass chandeliers appear to be flowing in a stiff breeze, and the concrete work is nothing short of stunning.  (Check out the sinks in the main and downstairs bathrooms .. incredibly crafted by local artisans).\n\nCocktails have been spot-on delicious, both times we've tried them.  The bartenders flex their mixological muscle with each libation.  For a restaurant that has been open for less than two months, the service is remarkably dialed-in as well.  We came on a night when the owners were clearly not expecting a crush of business (Monday) and had not staffed adequately to manage the demand.  Nonetheless, the staff made us feel very comfortable and more than made up for the unintended delays.\n\nThe food was very enjoyable as well.  The skate could have had a pinch less salt, but the gnocchi was beautifully crafted and the sweet squash nicely offset the tart and savory fish.  The okra was perfectly cooked (not mushy and oily as is often the case with mis-fried okra) and the lamb sausage was nicely seasoned.\n\nI waffled on four stars vs. five because every new restaurant has a few kinks after opening.  (I mistakenly ate at Heaven's Dog a week after they opened and was so poorly served I didn't return for 8 months, only to find an amazing restaurant had crawled out of the wreckage of my earlier meal).\n\nI also have a solid appreciation for how difficult it is to open a business in San Francisco .. particularly one with as many moving parts as a large restaurant.  These folks really have done an incredible job of getting the place off the ground and the talented and attentive staff created a comfortable and enjoyable evening.\n\nI have every confidence that whatever minor wrinkles we encountered will be ironed out quickly by the folks running the show here and I heartily encourage readers to go check out the space, the drinks and the food.", "author": "David O."}

I loved the decor, the outdoor patio area, everything.  \n\nThere were two things that brought this down two stars though.\n\nOne is the entrance way.  Honestly, I thought it was a fenced in empty lot at first.  The restaurant is tucked away behind a plain fence that doesn't look like anything, with a small opening in it.  The sign is small and not easy to see.  You go through that opening and tada, there you are.  But if you don't go through that doorway, you won't find it.\n\nMy other complaint is the menu.  There were some amazing looking foods being offered, but many of the foods were things I'd never heard of.  And there was no description or explanation.  As a vegetarian, I need to know at least the basis of the dish and frankly, 3/4 of what was listed I had no idea what it was.  Is Puntarella a cheese?  Chicken?  Some strange shape of pasta I'd never heard of?  Or maybe a deep sea fish off the coast of Antarctica.  I tried searching for it on Wikipedia right there, but got no hits and frankly, I didn't want to start googling everything that I didn't understand.  The bartenders were helpful and would explain what the names were, but honestly, I don't want to be asking what most of the menu is.\n\n(And if you didn't know, Puntarella is a vegetable.  Who would have thunk??)\n\nWe did wind up settling on a cheese plate since that's pretty self explanatory and safe for a vegetarian.  And the cheeses were amazing.

I've gotten to know the partners and have been impressed with their vision and their struggle to get open in the midst of the recession.  It's obviously still a work in progress a few weeks after opening, but off to a very good start.  \n\nFirst, as an architect, I appreciate the care that went into the space designed by Aidlin Darling Design: salvaged oak siding, soffits, and tables to warm up the white space, sensuous cast concrete booths and bars by Concreteworks, Nikolas Weinstein's glass tube sculptures below the three large skylights, the front patio that's an oasis from 11th Street (which will be much more inviting once seating arrives and the plants are established), large scale photographs behind the bar, etc. The restaurant is going for certification as a LEED Platinum space, a measure of its sustainability - quite a feat.  The voluminous room is noisier than I would like, but that's typical of most new restaurants and we were able to carry on conversation.  It could also use a bit more art on the walls for warmth and color.\n\nI finally ate dinner there with my partner and another couple.  I'd been down for cocktails several times and liked the combination of fresh ingredients and sustainable liquors, and a friendly staff and crowd.\n\nWe sampled and shared about two thirds of the menu - most of the small plates and several of the larger entrees and a number of desserts - and were quite pleasantly wowed at the beauty of the presentation and the tastiness of the food.  For me the standouts were the mussels, the corn pudding, the bigoli pasta, the salmon.  Deserts were satisfying with fresh flavors. The dinnerware, glassware, and serving dishes all showed thought and care.\n\nService was quite attentive.  The waitress knew the menu well and was able to answer questions.  Other staff checked on the table continually without being intrusive.  The only lapse was additional glasses of wine we ordered to accompany the end of our entrees arrived late.\n\nI look forward to experiencing this place as it settles in - I expect it will age quite well.  The hope is that eventually they will open for lunch and maybe even breakfast, as is planned.", "author": "David G."}

After reading Michael Bauer's review and seeing that it's a finalist for a James Beard award, I figured it must be incredible. It was good, but nothing we had could be described as great. \n\nWe started, about 3 minutes after we ordered, with the cod croquettes - the crust was crispy and the fish had a pleasant smokiness to it. It was a nice start to the dinner, but not especially notable. The next dish, which was brought out at the same time as the croquettes were being cleared, was the fried smelt. The plate contained about 10-12 smelt that had been battered and fried - unfortunately, the batter was quite heavy but unseasoned. The most pronounced flavors were flour and oil. A little salt and other seasonings could have really improved this dish. We didn't finish the smelt. \n\nWe had only been seated for about 10-15 minutes by the time our plate of smelt was cleared; the service felt very rushed. The roast chicken came out very quickly as well, just a couple of minutes after the last plate had been cleared. The chicken looked great, except for the hair that was laying on the chicken. We notified the server who notified the manager who took the chicken away, apologized, and said that another order of chicken would be brought out. We actually didn't mind the wait as it slowed the evening down to a more leisurely pace. The chicken was delicious - crispy skin, very moist, flavorful meat.  \n\nWe ended the meal with coffee (Four Barrel) and the brown butter cake, which both were good. \n\nOverall, it was good but not great like I had hoped. And pricey too - the smelt was removed from our tab, but for one appetizer, one entree, one dessert, two drinks, and coffee the bill with tip came to $90.", "author": "Timothy G."}

Perhaps because it was raining and peeps were elsewhere at Halloween parties, we had the choice of a table or seat at the bar with virtually no wait.  We chose the bar.\n\nWell, so much for the Stud... one Mai Tai lead to another... and another...  And, when I told my friends next day, they were, \"eeugh... so sweet and sickly.\"  But, no my friends, not Agricole's version.

Both were delicious.  Look forward to coming back some time and sitting down for a proper meal... maybe when it's sunny and we can enjoy the spacious front patio.\n\nOh, and should say, the design is refreshing and unexpected for this part of town... felt more like LA than SF on approach... and, inside, more like NY...

We're huge fans of Thad, loved him at Beretta (we live a block away and go there weekly...) and were eagerly awaiting his new place. \n\nHits:\n- Drink Menu:  Superb drinks crafted with care.  Loved the agricole liquor.  Never had it before, great focal point for the drink menu.  Overall - better drinks than Beretta!  5 stars. \n- Some food items (if they were each $2-3 cheaper):  Corn pudding, boudin blanc sausage (the blood sausage had awful mouthfeel, but the blanc was awesome), salmon (perfectly cooked), mussels\n\nMisses - food.\n- Food: pickles, olives, squash fritters, tomatoes with bottarga (actually, this dish was good, but it was $14, and Beretta has similar stuff for $6), tuna poached in olive oil (server didn't tell us it was served cold... c'mon that's basic... and it tasted like Chicken of the Sea albacore packed in oil), \n- Portion sizes/value:  Almost every single dish is overpriced by several dollars, and is a bit too small.  \n- Food prices.  $12 for tomato/cucumber soup?  That's what Spruce charges for their heirloom tomato gazpacho...  I'd expect a lobster claw or a ton of crab meat for that price, given this ain't Spruce.  \n\n\n\nOverall Verdict:  \nYou need to decide if you are a bar or a restaurant... and get serious about the food if you want to be a restaurant.  \n\nUnfortunately, they already decided by how they set up the space.   Hidden from the street with a quiet outdoor patio - nobody will accidentally wander in here for a drink.  People will make reservations for dinner.. and that's just not working.  \n\nI so, so, so, wanted the food to be as awesome as the food at Beretta. Given the prices, I was expecting to be blown away as we ordered, but then I was sorely disappointed as it came out.  If all the prices had been $5 less per item, I wouldn't have been disappointed... but if you want to price and portion like you are one of SF's top restaurants, I'm going to hold you to a very, very, very high standard.", "author": "Adrian M."}

You walk in and are transported. \n\nWe went for a girls' night for my best friend's birthday. They seated us by the rear window and when one of the girls complained it was too cold, they moved us, no problem. The booths are hard wood with high backs, so not exactly comfortable. The space is dark, but unlike another reviewer, we didn't have any trouble seeing each other or our food. They have napkins made of denim. Weird. \n\nWe all ordered a round of pretty cocktails. They looked good AND tasted good. My chief complaint was that they ran out of food. Meaning: three of us ordered the pork chop, and the server told us there were only two left. I wanted the birthday girl to have what she ordered, so I volunteered to get something else. I was not happy about it, because nothing else on the menu jumped out at me. So I rather reluctantly ordered the swordfish, which I'm normally not a fan of because it's too firm for my taste. But I'm glad I did, because the dish was delicious. Yes, the fish was firm, but it was moist and flavorful, and I did not regret my choice. Another girl ordered squid ink pasta which she raved about. And I did get a taste of the pork chop which was so savory and juicy.\n\nThe servers were not especially attentive or inattentive. Just average.

Ugh.  Not that I don't like this place, because the exact opposite is true. But I decided to embrace the fact that I am a foodie and will go to restaurants I have been before... the city is only 7 x 7!  One of the best ways to confirm the caliber of any dining experience... is to do a return visit.\n\nI am happy to report that BA has passed the test in my book with flying colors. It's a perfect date place, The first time I was here, it was cold and raining, so the patio option was obviously null.  There is a coat check-in behind the host/hostess and an inviting bar immediately to the left of the  entrance.  BA is intimate with dim lighting and an elaborately unique chandelier in the back of the dining area.\n\nAlthough he offered, I knew I was out of his way, so I insisted to meet. He was early. And so naturally the tall, dark, and handsome date of mine was surrounded by women at the bar.  I'm not surprised, he looks like a player... literally like a tennis player... 6'3\" dark thick hair, tan muscularly built body, chiseled face, big brown eyes and perfect pearly teeth.... And he claims I'm the hottie... wow.  It's hard for me to swallow what guys say anymore. But I immediately smiled when I saw he already had a glass of red in his non-drinking hand while sipping his cocktail. And one of the girls pitched that he wouldn't stop talking about me... why on earth would she say that; did he bribe her with a drink??\n\nNearly the entire month of June has been so beautiful in SOMA, so needless to say there seemed to be more people out on the patio then inside.  That's one of the things that I love about summer... the longer days. Its was already 8pm and it was still light out! But of course as the sun disappeared, it did get a little chilly, thankfully we were under a heat lamp.\n\nWe started off with the Mizuna with black mission figs, ricotta, red radishes and pistachios... I was craving arugula, but was offered an absolutely delicious alternative.  He ordered the fried romano beans, smelt and manila clams... which I thought was ok... just trying to avoid grease-inspired dishes.\nFunny how we both sort of knew what entree we wanted, but I still had to hear from our waiter which in his opinion was the top 2 entrees... And we both laughed when he said our exact choices.  He chose the flavorful sea bass and I had the delectable grilled squid.  It's always a blessing when your date likes to share... I didn't want to assume, but so happy he offered. We shared all the scrumptious dishes.  Except we declined on dessert... no regrets there, but I am certain that too would be yummy.\nThe cool thing about BA is the menu changes... not sure if it's daily... So the chance of getting bored with their organic food is clearly doubtful. And better yet, each return visit is like a new dining experience!", "author": "Myra M."}

The first time was for our employee holiday dinner in December, a party of 5 upstairs, this past weekend for a dinner for 8 in the \"dungeon\". \n\n(Its not a dungeon! There are no whips, chains, or other medieval torture devices.) So, if you have a large party, know you will be seated downstairs, and deal with it. The lighting also seemed fine to me.\n\nLove: Amazingly sexy interior that sets the mood the minute you walk in; delicious cocktails (whassup, Mary Pickford, my Canadian homegirl, love your work!); tasty food with small(er) portions that were exactly as described on the menu; slow pace to dinner that lets you enjoy the evening. \n\nLike: the service - sure, its not Quince level, but they are knowledgeable and willing to offer opinions when asked. Some missteps - my friend ordered a well-to-do bottle of wine without asking too much about it - when it came, it wasn't what she had thought, and the sommelier explained that it was quite a special bottle, and he had assumed she knew all about it when ordering...umm, if someone doesn't like the bottle, please just replace it without taking a little jab.\nAlso, bread wasn't delivered with soup when asked. Small, but at these prices, these things are expected. \n\nDisliked: it can get hella loud in the 'dungeon'. What can you do? Just yell too. Upstairs at a booth, it was perfectly quiet, and I think we may have been the loud ones. What goes around, yes?\n\nI'll be back to sit where I haven't before: on the patio one of of those sublimely sunny days that occur so infrequently in SF that you think it was a dream.

I think the concept of shared dishes can sometimes be overdone.  1/3rd of the dishes were memorable, 1/3rd was ok, and the 1/3 I would characterize as non-memorable.  Service was a bit slow as I think they may have been short staffed.  I like this place overall and would definitely come here for drinks and food at the bar; however, as a sit down restaurant I'd opt for other places.\n\nI hope this place makes it, b/c it looks like a lot of money was spent on the interior.

Both the food and the drinks are very innovative; if you want to try something truly new, Agricole won't disappoint you.

I just love that.\n\nOne issue I had -- we were sitting at the bar for dinner. One of the bartenders was really awesome and fun, and helped us out in figuring out what to drink and eat. The other bartender however wasn't very helpful with remarks like \"I would recommend everything!\" or \"I wouldn't know how to pick between these awesome dishes\"...

For dinner I tried the rabbit terrine which was tasty and the aspic was extra delicious. I then had the sardine which mixed mediterranean flavors with californian style. Every bite was awesome but the only thing i wasn't in love with was the farro. This is my favorite grain but it just didn't do it for me with this dish I would have preferred a quinoa or barley.

Each element of the cocktail was noticeable and blended well.  \n\nFirst the service was impeccable; each person that my table encountered were superbly nice and gracious.  I found the menu very tight--a bit too tight.  Doesn't mean the menu needs to be novella sized.  My dinner mate said \"is this it?!\"  The wine list was also a bit too tight as well; and I see where they are going-- a European wine focal point.\n\nThe food was a mix of delight and acceptable.  We began with the pickles (a mixture of rooted vegetables), cod croquette were a promising start---the croquette were fresh and nicely plated.  The Chicory salad was good not great.  The Pecorino was quite nice --much smaller than I expected at $16 it is one of the most expensive and least fulfilling salads in recent memory.  I place this salad in the highly non-recommend position.  The Spaghetti with Dungness crab was a very nice dish--crab identifiable pieces and a flavors combined quite well.  The pasta was house made and superb.  The Grilled white sea bass with spinach and artichokes was fresh and nicely platted.\n\nThe desserts we had were the Grapefruit pound cake with Champagne Sabayon and the Medjhool date cake with blood orange Sherbet and hazelnuts.  the blood orange Sherbet was delightful.  The desserts seemed to be too close in the citrus category and I think there should have been a great diversity in dessert offerings.  \n\nThere was no particular dish that was stellar--which was disappointing---the plating and larger experience was a bit too rarefied.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-04-14", "description": "Before even setting foot into Bar Agricole, I had read numerous times about how it has redefined the culinary experience.  What does it mean to have the soul of bar and a restaurant, merged together?  How is this any different than any other restaurant?  Say something like NOPA, where the spirits are just as important as the Berkshire Pork Chop.  Not by much, but Bar Agricole takes it a step further.  \n\nRedefining a culinary experience is no small feat nowadays.  Several years ago, the term GastroPub started popping up and I didn't quite know what it meant.  I don't believe the Bay Area quite has one (although Magnolia and 21st Amendment are close).  Bar Agricole is nowhere near a GastroPub, however, it is similar in that I think it has created a new type of experience that is a step beyond NOPA.  One that I think deserves a new name, something along the lines of GastroBar, or a Culinary Bar.\n  \nAlthough craft beers are served, its not the main focus of the bar, and the food menu goes way beyond simple duck tacos.  I've scanned the menu daily for the past two weeks and although the details have changed, the main dish (for the most part) has not.  For example, the pork chop has been on for a good two weeks, but escarole may be served one day, and kale the next, or rapini.  The white bean puree may be one day, and the fava been puree will be next.    \n  \nWhy does this place redefine the culinary experience?\n1) The main mixing bar is done front in center in the middle of the restaurant.  The actual bar for guests is front left and separate from the mixing bar.  All the mixing of the signature drinks appears to be done at this mixing bar.  Behind the bar are several different glasses.  Some with thick rims, some with thin rims, some that are high, and some that are low.  Even the sparkling water carafe is served in an Erlenmeyer flask that has a frosted lip with a spout for easy pouring.  There are multiple different ices used (although I only came across 3 \ndespite my efforts).\n  \n2) The restaurant is very green.  The lighting used is very efficient with big large glass doors in the front and back to let a lot of light in.  The ceiling has large massive skylights with artistic glass (?) or clear PVC tubing contoured in dramatic shapes.  Each table has small fixtures that drop down from the ceiling (although the last table in the back doesn't have anything and it can get pretty dark).  The use of water in the bathroom is conserved with two different flushes for waste (very European), timed water faucets, and automated air dryers (no towels).\n  \n3) The menu is small (made on recycled paper?) with the drinks being on equal footing as the size of the food menu.  The wine list menu is sectioned by wine region and each varietal is nicely highlighted with colored, discrete bullets.   The drink cocktail list has as much, if not more information about what's in the drink than what the food list has for its information.  The drink menu is opened with the left side being the drinks and the right side being the food.  50/50, hence the merging and sharing of the experience.  \n\nIn some sense, most of these things I've mentioned are subtle and to some extent, some would argue, not really any different than any other restaurant.  However, as a whole, you're left with a certain impression of Bar Agricole.  One that is unique.  Did I just leave a bar and had food there?  Or, did I just leave a restaurant and have drinks?  Or did I do both.  As such, you are left with the defining question of Bar Agricole and for that, it is redefining.\n  \nThe prices are all laid out before you go people.  Nothing more than the usual restaurant in the city.", "author": "Mark K."}

We were a group, so we would get stuck in the dungeon.  (By dungeon I mean the lower level/basement area.)  The only lighting came from the two candles on our table and a couple that were scattered along the walls.  We had to take out our cell phones just to read the menu.  Seriously, there was not other lighting.\n\nThe service was attentive when we first sat down.  They were quick to take our drink orders.  I was impressed.  Then the service level fell from there.  It took a while to get our drinks and even longer for us to place our orders.  I'm not sure if it was being in the basement or in the dark that caused the wait staff to overlook our table.\n\nThe food was about as expected (based on previous Yelp reviews).  The portions were small (almost tapas sized) and the flavoring was bland.  It's possible that I was expecting more from this restaurant, but the food really wasn't anything I couldn't cook at home.  Keep in mind that we did ask the wait staff how we should best order.  Should we order to eat family style?  Each order our own entree?  They were non-committal with their answers.  If they suggested we order family style as the dishes are small/tapas style I think we would have been just fine.\n\nAll in all, know what to expect when you're coming here.  Avoid sitting in the dungeon and order plenty of dishes to share.\n\nI give them one star for being open (as running a restaurant is difficult enough) and another star for the building itself.  From what we could see, the dungeon had gorgeous stone walls.", "author": "Allison T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-19", "description": "The Place:  IMPRESSIVE.  \n* I had to drive around the block twice and even then I could only find it by foot -- this is not to mean that the restaurant is pretentiously hiding, but more that it managed to blend into the neighborhood without calling attention to itself.  \n* Once you step inside, past the garage-door feel of the exterior, you are SLAPPED with how open and large the space is.  There is a huge outdoor garden area that moves into a dwarfingly big (by SF standards) bar & dining area and then all of that leads into their parking lot (no YOU shut-up!)\n* The walls on the inside and outside are encased in narrow planks of bright wood.  This was one of the only \"farm-esque\" touches for what is duped a \"farm-bar\" - the rest seems stylishly modern to me.\n* I wish I had special priviledges to hoard the outdoor garden area.  I am secretly hoping that other neighborhoods don't travel for it.  It's amazing - smells just like cedar and while there are no tables, it seems roomy.  But it all boils down to - where else can you grab a glass of sparking Vouvray before walking to a show at Slims??\n\nThe Drink:  Wine was excellent - did not try the cocktails.\n*I was looking forward to trying one of the cocktails, I found the ones available to be a little too masculine for me (e.g., most were brown-liquor based).  I'm sure they're fantastic if that's your thing and you can't beat the full bar.\n*Wine.  I was impressed, my friend was impressed - probably enough to come back for even if the food wasn't amazing.  I ordered a glass of the sparkling vouvray and my server's recommendation for an Austrian red (Blaufrankisch).  My friend was even more pleased with her wine (Cremant du Jura Blanc)\n\nThe Menu:  needs some marketing help.\n*The menu descriptions were waaaaay too sparse so much that we had to have our server explain nearly each option on the menu.  For example, the menu reads \"chilled chicken with an egg\".  We thought that sounded like prison food until our server explained that they make use out of every part of the chicken's body, with the breast in the center... yada yada... six minute cooked egg...and so on.  Radically changed our impression of the dish.  Another example read \"bigoli with pesto\" which seemed really unimpressive to just serve noodles and pesto.  This dish had whole pine nuts, shaved pecorino, and chunks of eggplant in addition to the pesto.  \nThis had to be going on at other tables and eating up the server's time, but its an easy fix to make.\n\nThe Food:  Excellent.\nWe ordered Piccalilli (pickled veggies), leafy salad, bigoli with pesto, stuffed quail, rum raisin ice cream, and almond cake.\nWe loved it all, no complaints whatsoever.\n\nThe Scene:  Did anyone mentioned they are going to seat and serve guests until 1AM, every night?

There were many murmurs of satisfaction as we ate, and not so much sharing among our group (a good sign in my family).\n\nWhile our choice of a Saturday night meant it was busy, it was a bit disappointing to see such long lulls in service, which meant that the 2nd round of drinks, order placed before the courses arrived, were not delivered until after we'd finished eating and the plates were removed!

It's an upscale \"food sharing plate\" kind of place so it was a lot of fun ordering a bunch of food and passing it around family style.  We brought our own wine.  My son ordered one of the drinks and it was VERY good.  The food was great - I especially loved the trout - OMG!  and the goat cheese on persimmon toast - to die for if you like goat cheese!  We also had the oyster appetizers.  I don't know how much the bill was since my ex and his wife paid for the meal (maybe that is why I enjoyed the meal so much : )  NOT!  Seriously, we sat outside, the heaters kept us warm in the outside garden area decorated beautifully with lights.

Argricole is a type of Rum. Bar Agricole has over 10 types of rum. Although I have not tried them, the word is, Agricole Rum is a non-sweet, traditional rum which will change any assumptions, expectations and your experience with rum. \"Try it, and you will find it's out of this world,\" said our waitress. There are other stories in relation to the restaurant, its history and the selections on the menu- Ask!\nNow for the food: Roasted peppers over a creme fraiche, the roasted squid was amazing, full-flavored and plenty of it; tempura fried green beans with curried yogurt were excellent as were the roasted beets, to name a few items. The desserts are hand crafted. We were served a creme brulee custard topped with figs in curved glass dessert pot that was mouth watering and delicious. \nStaff and service was informed, courteous, entertaining and as well as attentive. \nThe new outside patio which has been open three weeks greatly expands the restaurant, changes up the ambiance and is filled with choice herbs for the restaurant. It is well-heated and has the lovely sounds of the fountain set in the corner. \nTry it and ask for staff recommendations for new selections on the menue.", "author": "Zoe S."}

Small portions for the pr$ce. It didn't blown our minds but it was tasty. We ordered the corn pudding (fluffy souffle with a nice sweet corn crunch), poached tuna (refreshing and light - but the piece of tuna was not more than a 1/2-in long) and the rolled chicken galantine with jelly and half of a soft boiled egg over a bed of arugula (that particular dish was suppose to show case the chef's creativity and for us, it feel flat). \n\nDrinks?

We arrived early to enjoy their happy hour and it was well worth it.  Two glasses of delicious chilled French Cremant and $1 oysters was the perfect starter.  Our dining choice was on the patio enjoying the beautiful S.F. weather.  Menu choices are meant to be shared and we found this to be an opportunity to evaluate other menu choices.  We did not regret this decision.  The three of us started with the Farinata, Citrus salad, and the pork belly.  All three dishes exceeded our expectations on flavors, freshness, and presentation....delicious.  We then ordered the spaghetti with clams and the wild trout...equally delicious.  The evening was complete with one order of the Amaranth cake to share and a sweet plate included in the service.  Our group enjoyed a flamboyant Sonoma County Pinot Noir from the wine list.  The service was warm and attentive with no delays in any portion of our meal.  Pricing was similar if not slightly below other restaurants in the S.F. market.

This second time however, was \"Meh\". It could've been 1 star, but I gave the additional star for the first time I've been there.\n\nThis second time is how I should review it because it is the most current. Ordered the chopped liver on toast, it was good but I shouldn't even complain about it but the portion was so big. The liver was so rich and filling that it should be on smaller crostini. Ordered the plate of their housemade pickles and nuts. Every single vegetable on the plate was super salty and sour. I think they left the veggies in the brine too long. The nuts were flavorless unless you happen to get a herb stuck to the nut.  Olives...were olives but still too salty.  After eating about a third of the pickle plate and long conversations with my date, it took a while for our entrees to come.  When the waitress came to clear the plates and check up on us to make room for the entrees, I had just said FYI, the pickles are really salty and maybe you should tell the chef to not pickle them so long.  She said \"oh. ok.\" and walked away.  Entrees came, I ordered the pork loin and my friend ordered the duck. The sauce that was on my pork loin was so tart and salty. I think they used too much lime in the sauce and the pork had no flavor. I've had better pork. The duck was super fatty, but flavorless. Duck from the chinese market taste better.\n\nOverall, I wasnt impressed this second time around on the food. It was better before. This time I kept it sober, but last time I thought the drinks were amazing! Pricey, but very well  done. No wonder the bar area is so packed and not the dining area!  But one thing I have to give props for was when the bill came, the waitress had taken the pickle dish off our bill.

It was really hard to get anyone's attention.\n\nMy appeal to the owners of this place--please prune your waitstaff and rehire more professional and courteous people. It really felt as if we had 3am Mel's diner service.\n\nAnother comment, our server basically insisted that everything is shared and that not sharing is not an option. This seemed strange and it is.

The picked carrots tasted like carrots with some vinegar sprinkled on top, they were not pickled, and the portion was smallish.

Quite the opposite; each cocktails was perfectly balanced and kept simple, yet delicious. \n\nThe food follows the same mentality as the drinks, keeping the ingredients to a minimum and letting the natural flavors of the dish speak for themselves. \n\nThe owner of the place seems to truly have an appreciation for the ingredients he is using and I will be back for more deliciousness in the not too distant future", "author": "Sam M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-06-15", "description": "Bar Agricole is a great addition to the SOMA bar and restaurant scene. Bar Agricole advertises as a modern urban tavern but it's much much more than a simple bar. It's a blend of San Francisco foodie heaven and an ultra-hip mixologist bar scene. Bar Agricole's inconspicuous outer facade tells nothing of its beautiful and creative use of space. Once you enter the front door off busy 11th Street, you are immediately greeted by an open courtyard of tables, rare in San Francisco let alone SOMA. Past the outdoor drinks area (sadly the don't allow food outside) is the actual restaurant. The restaurant's decor is impeccable. The refurbished wood tables, brushed concrete and savvy shapes of the furniture really make Bar Agricole stand out from other restaurants in town. \n\nI'd say the booze is the main reason people come to Bar Agricole. The mixologists behind the bar are excellent at mixing up delicious concoctions. The drink menu has exotic drinks such as the Knickerbocker Swizzle, Whiz-Bang and Monkey's Gland and some steady favorites like the Scotch Sour and Old Fashioned. It's a real treat to sit at the bar and watch the bartenders whip up these creative drinks. \n\nWe had a vastly different experience with the food. We ordered a few appetizers at the bar as we enjoyed our drinks but unfortunately the bartender did not \"warn\" us what we were ordering. We ordered the king salmon gravlax which was delicious but when the second plate came out it clearly wasn't risotto balls. At this point, the Maitre D' approached us and said, \"It's good to see adventurous eaters.\" We knew we were in trouble as he went on to explain the dish in front of us was boiled sliced cow's head. Yes, cow's head, cartilage and all. We didn't want to crush his heart so we decided to be adventurous and give it a try. It tasted like boiled cow's head, but oddly enough my friend ate it up. All in all, the food at Bar Agricole is too foodie and pretentious for me. I like to be able to read the menu and know what I'm ordering thus Bar Agricole is a drinks-only establishment for me. I do wish our bartender had said something when we ordered, because boiled cow head is just not a normal dish to have on a menu. If you are going to have exotic menu items in another language, the entire staff, bartenders and all, should be trained to discuss (I mean warn) the menu with customers.", "author": "Alice S."}

In the interim, we couldn't get a drink at the bar because there were only two bar tenders on staff on a Friday night. The first \"organic\" wine we had, which came highly recommended by the waiter, tasted like pear cider. \n\nThe second wine was a level better and one of the cheapest wines on the menu at $50. The main dishes, which were categorized under the word, \"FOOD,\" all sounded unusual. After some oysters we enjoyed, some odd pickled salad and another plate of lettuce topped with sliced butter - no lie - I settled on something called sheep's milk ricotta gnudi with fava greens and baby beans for my entree. The cheese looked like blocks of yogurt plunked on a loose and completely bland combination of greens. The total bill rang in at $240 for me and my wife. I heartily recommend avoiding this place unless you're a die hard groupy for trendy, organic, overpriced and experimental cuisine.", "author": "Flash N."}

Terrible service, inattention to diners, less-than-mediocre food.  Our waitress was completely oblivious to our needs, forgot drink orders, forgot to bring the bread we asked for, didn't realize we were even unhappy.  Easily 30 minutes of downtime between courses, made all the more painful by empty glasses and what seemed to be lots of waitstaff standing around.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-03-17", "description": "Bar Agricole, I wanted so much to love you.  Our experience a few nights ago was pretty dismal, however.\n\nYour wine list is the most user-unfriendly one I've ever seen.  After struggling with the little booklet that is your wine list, I finally gave up and asked the waitperson to make a recommendation.  She did, and it was responsive to my request and quite tasty.  The Cotes du Rhone we ended up ordering and paying $77 for retails for $20, I later discovered.  That's nearly a 400% markup.  A former chef friend tells me that such a markup isn't unheard of; that may be true, but it, like your food, is simply overpriced.  (I suspect that you need to subsidize that super-cool, LA-esque interior by charging through the nose.)\n\nWe shared two appetizer courses.  The lamb pate was okay.  The mostarda you served with it, though, tasted for all the world like orange marmalade into which you'd stirred some mustard seeds and a couple of raisins.  And what were you thinking with the bread you served with it?  The pieces were large and so hard--not crisp--HARD--that we each nearly broke a tooth on it.  It was like cartoon food.  Our other appetizer--radishes with butter (one of my favorite French nibbles) consisted of what appeared to be breakfast radishes, tops and root tips left on, that had been quartered lengthwise and plopped on a plate with a couple of small curls of butter.  Have you ever tried spreading butter on such a long, thin, floopy object?  It was difficult at best and required far too much attention--attention I would much rather have been paying to my companion.  The radishes, by the way, were soggy and salty, as if they'd been cut earlier and had been soaking in salt water.  Six bucks for that--ouch.\n\nIn mitigation, the arugula/rocket salad with Meyer lemon vinaigrette was quite good.\n\nIn aggravation, my duck breast was raw in the middle.  Not rare, mind you--I like rare duck breast--but this was raw.  I believe fennel was served on top, but it was greasy and unidentifiable.  What you identified as sauerkraut was pretty good--crisp and flavored with fennel chiffonade.  I considered sending the meat back, but the hour was growing late, and the duck had been served sliced and I wasn't prepared to see what was going to come back to me.  My companion had the sausage and polenta.  She didn't care for it.  I tried some, and it just wasn't...good.  The things that make both sausage and polenta delicious just weren't there--the flavors were bland and the textures were not pleasing.\n\nThe bread you served us (on request, as stated in your menu, near the end of our meal) did not taste fresh.  In fact, the last bite I took tasted faintly of mold.  I so do NOT want to go there.\n\nDessert:  my Meyer lemon tart was quite good, and so was the brewed coffee.  I'm not fond of the tiny individual containers of sugar and cream, one each, that you served me with my coffee.  What you're telling me, in effect, Bar Agricole, is how much sugar and cream I may put in my coffee.  I find that objectionable, especially with the prices you charge.  Sure, I could have tracked down a waitperson for more, but why?  Why interrupt my meal to get something that should have been given to me in the first place?  My companion's espresso looked dismal, with dark sludge floating on top, and she commented that it was bitter and tasted bad.  \n\nFor a $200 meal (including tip), it was pretty \"meh\" on most fronts.  I hope for your sake and for the sake of future diners that things improve.  As for me, I can't imagine going back.", "author": "Earline A."}

The building and architecture were really cool and I could see this as beeing a hip and trendy place to hang out for a drink after work.\nWe brought in our own wine so we skipped the drinks (which I hear are one of their specialities).  Corkage was $25 a bottle.  We started out with 3 shared dishes.  Roasted Beets with Horseradish, raw ahi tuna and the mixed roasted peppers.  All 3 were very tasty and I thought they were priced appropriately.\n\nThen came the entrees.  We each ordered a different one.\nGrilled Squid - this was a BIG portion!  It had a quite intense smokey flavor though so if that's not your thing, skip it for sure.\nHalf Chicken - again, decent size portion.  Lack any \"umph\" in my book though.\nRabbit - this was by farm my favorite at the table.  it was served \"link-style\" and the meat was super tender.  Highly recommend it if they have it on the menu.\nRoasted eggplant with tomatoes, cheese and basil - this was my least favorite (and my entree to boot!)  It was served in a shallow dish straight out of the brick over.  My first bite was cold.  (A typical problem with this type of preparation.)  I mentioned it to the waiter and he returned it to the kitchen.  My second dish (a new one, not the original just re-heated) was served shortly and was bubbling around the edges.  I thought, \"Yes!  Just the way I like it.\" But alas, my first bite from the middle was just barely room temperature.  When the waiter returned to see how things were, I told him the issue but that I just mixed it all together so it was edible and I wouldn't be the only one eating if I had to wait to give the kitchen another try.  Big disappointment, not to mention that the dish lacked any seasoning...salt would have helped!  I will say, they tried to make it right and removed my entree from our bill.

I know they typically serve what looks good and is in season but you can't tell me you can't find a good piece of beef, lamb, pork, etc. out there!\nAll in all it was a nice dinner but lacked the finess I expected based on the prices they are charging for the food.

We've been intrigued by the place for a while now, but the small menu never enticed us and the reviews complaining about the prices scared us away. \n\nThis is a cool, trendy spot, larger than we expected, with interesting decor and a hip vibe. So the atmosphere is fun. The service is friendly and professional, if a bit slow. The restaurant earns its three stars here. \n\nThe food and cocktails, however, are nothing special. The cocktails, surprisingly, were a disappointment, especially because of the raves we read in various reviews. I had the Bourboun Old Fashioned and my wife drank the Planter's Punch with the namesake white agricole rum. Both drinks were fine but better cocktails (and food) can be had at Locanda or Beretta. The food was also fine, but overpriced. We shared three dishes:\n\nThe mache with poached spot prawns ($19) was a rip-off, a miniscule portion with one prawn and minimal accompaniments.\n\nThe spaghetti with razor clams ($22) had a nice crunch and flavor but again did not justify the price.\n\nThe wood oven roasted wild mushroom with polenta, kale, fonduta & a poached egg ($19) was our favorite dish--unique and flavorful.\n\nAgain, nothing wrong with the food, just not a good value.\n\nI agree with other reviewers that this is a fun spot for cocktails and appies.

A simple summer salad with corn, tomatoes, and cucumber is $15 but the beef tartare is $12. A bowl of mussels is $22 and even a cheese plate is $18! WTH? My friend & I were here for dinner last Wed and ended up spending about $60 each, and I left hungry :(\nWe each started with a cocktail - I chose the Sleepyhead and my friend the Foxtrot. The Sleepyhead was brandy-based, with ginger, lime, mint, and a float of bubbly. It was good, but nothing too exciting. The Foxtrot was akin to a Pisco Sour but made with rum - again, didn't bowl me over. All cocktails are priced at $10, and I could have easily knocked back at least 5 of these, they were that small. We switched to the Rose by the glass pretty much immediately.\nWe then shared the marinated local anchovies. The presentation was beautiful - the thinly sliced anchovies were fanned out into a starfish shape and glistening with lemony olive oil. They were good & briny but definitely needed a dash of salt. The fried green tomatoes were very good but small - I didn't want to share! 3 rounds of crisp-breaded tomato were accompanied by 2 lightly fried squash blossoms stuffed with a creamy salt cod brandade, with some watercress strewn over the plate and aioli on the side. The big disappointment for us was the $22 bowl of mussels. My friend doesn't eat meat so they obliged us by leaving out the chorizo. Unfortunately, this meant that they left out most of the flavor too. The broth was pretty thin & watery, and the addition of cabbage to the preparation was inexplicable. The mussels themselves were quite plump & juicy though. I wish we had ordered the olive oil-poached albacore...\nMy favorite dish was the apricot galette we shared for dessert. It was almost like an apricot tarte tatin, with lots of fresh apricot flavor and a subtle almond note from the crust. The honey yogurt on the side was unnecessary, as the dessert was great on its own and deserves its own star. I'm glad the night ended on a sweet note!", "author": "Stephanie S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-10-05", "description": "A surprisingly unpretentious spot with good food at good prices and a great wine and cocktail menu, even though the interior is kind of basement-y.\n\nLiving right in the area, I was baffled when this place was being built, as the building is strangely shaped and set oddly back from the street with an awkward patio in front surrounded by a giant wall. Was it going to be somebody's house, or a dot-com office? Turns out it's a restaurant/bar, but this confusing layout is still a problem. The entrance is totally uninviting, a long, dark ramp, and while the patio is nice, in this city it'll be used about two days a year. While the interior of the bar/restaurant itself is dramatically styled, with undulating clear chandeliers and custom furniture, there aren't really any windows, at all, which just seems like a huge missed opportunity considering bustling 11th St. is right outside. Instead of a big fenced-in useless patio, couldn't they have put the bar there? While they've done the best they could with the space, it doesn't make any sense, really, since you might as well be in the basement of a mall. I just feel a tad miffed about a place turning its back on the neighborhood. \n\nOnce you get in, the atmosphere is actually nice, with a bar and booths near the front and tables towards the back. Our party of 4 was given a booth right at the front, pretty much in the crowded bar/entrance area, but the tall built-in booth sort of isolated us in our own little zone and we were very comfortable. Service was extremely friendly and easygoing, letting us wander through cocktails, apps and entrees at our own pace.\n\nSpeaking of cocktails, there's a list of about 12 house specialties, slightly modernized classic cocktails like sours and, well, old-fashioneds, and they all look fantastic, no froofy strawberry liquers or novelty crap. My old fashioned used a local gin and had a hefty slice of zest with a single giant ice cube and the perfect mid-sized glass, and it was sublime, while a friend's sour was a tiny but perfectly mixed little apertif. I'll definitely go back just to work my way through the cocktails.\n\nAppetizers were great, a couple oysters were fresh and delicious, an odd sardine thing was awesome and inspired us all to want to eat more sardines, some beets and avocados on bread were simple and hearty, and fried green beans were fun. A bean salad was also fresh and delicious. Entrees seemed to slide just a bit, my sole was somewhat bland, and the whole \"filet at the table\" thing was kind of awkward, plus it still left about a thousand little fish bones for me to pick out. A spaghetti was also a touch on the \"meh\" side. Prices were fair, though, with only my fish entree breaking the $20 mark,  appetizers in the $6-8 range and all very generously portioned. \n\nThe place was packed even on a Tuesday at 7PM, so watch out, or make reservations.", "author": "Ben G."}

The bartenders aren't particularly friendly but seem very old-school professional.\n\nMy husband had come for dinner with a friend and really enjoyed it so we returned together. I really like the vibe of this place. Very upscale, serious and elegant, but on the other hand casual and trendy. Basically it's fancy food for hipsters (which I myself am not). Everyone was really professional and seemed to be acting the part (in a good way). Our waiter was awesome, very knowledgeable and enthusiastic, but very real. He gave us the appropriate amount of time, but also checked. I feel like often at these places, the service is 'too good for you'/'too cool for you' but it's not that was at all here. The manager also checked in, stepped in to pour wine, etc, which was nice.\n\nWe ordered drinks at the bar, but before they were made, we were taken to our table and told that they would bring the drinks over. There was some miscommunication there as the drinks too a while, but again, the waiter apologized and they came quickly after that. He was great about helping us choose a wine. We're knowledgeable, but with his input, we found the perfect complement to our dinner.\n\nMy husband got the terrine to start and though I tasted it and it was good, it's really not my thing. The bread was toasted a little too much. The main course was great, I had housemade sausage stuffed in saddle of rabbit (yum!) and my husband had the duck breast which was also really good. For dessert we shared the strawberry shortcake. Often i can do without dessert, but this was worth it.\n\nThis is a great place for dinner, trendy, but great food and very well-run. I would prefer a slightly larger menu, but as long as whatever I order is as good as I had last time, I guess it's okay. There's valet parking and a great outdoor area, though it was under renovation when we were there.

Sooo 2.25 hours and four cocktails later (two a piece, I'm no lush) we finally get a table. We ordered the green salad dressed in a creamy chive dressing, the rabbit wrapped in prosciutto and a textured dish concisting of squid, garbanzo beans and croutons. Lets just say, the salad was the best dish of the three, however the croutons were way too large ... it's so awkward to try to stuff a giant crouton in your mouth and almost as bad to try and cut through it with a butte knife. The squid was a bit too chewy and the rabbit was far too undercooked and quite chewy as well. We didn't try dessert, they all looked lovely, but nothing really seamed too out of the ordinary. The hostess and he bar tenders were great, though our waitress seemed a bit out of it ...\nTo sum it up, the cocktails were great--too bad the food was meh.

It feels very open and airy and has a California modern sensibility (clean, almost spare, with lots of wood, large glass fixtures, and white walls). The bar seemed pretty lively. It also has a really nice courtyard. I didn't spend any time on it, but the fountains made it inviting. The staff who greet at the door is friendly. In fact, when I gave them my friend's name, they knew exactly where to take me (without looking that is). Both the drink menu and the wine list are intriguing. I started things off with a tequila cocktail that featured pineapple gum. It was really refreshing and very different from what I usually drink. If I had it to do again, I might have tried a glass of the Furmint Sec. The olives we started our meal with had a great flavor. I liked the large green ones best. They had a mellow flavor that really meshed well with the fresh herb marinade. The smaller olives were a tad bitter.  I liked having a few, but they far outnumbered the tasty green ones. For my meal, I had a Scotch egg to start. A Scotch egg typically consists of a shelled hard-boiled egg, wrapped in a sausage meat mixture, coated in breadcrumbs, and deep-fried. The Bar Agricole Scotch egg is soft-boiled and served slightly warm on a bed of greens with a smear of sauce (Thousand Island like, but better). It's really lovely and surprisingly light.  For my entr\u00e9e, I opted to have the artichoke. It had a terrific flavor and was big enough to share. It was perfect for as a small meal. It comes with garlic butter for dipping. The only real lag was at the end. The server did the now you seem now you don't thing that servers seem to like to do. Oh well, I was in good company so it didn't bother me too much.

Weather was awesome\n2. The decor was actually pretty interesting, I loved the light fixtures and it was very open\n3.  Drip coffee was extremely strong.  It came from 4 Barrel which is known for making some pretty strong coffee.\n4. The buckwheat beignets were delicious.  Light, flavorful and the plum was a nice addition to the dish\n5. Friend order biscuits with scrapple which is basically an omelette with mushrooms which tasted like a real hearty meal so that was my favorite out of all the dishes.\n\nCons:\n1. We tried to make reservations and for some reason, we couldn't get it online so we decided to just go in.  We got there at 12, it was almost completely empty (except for the patio) and they said they were all booked.  Weird right?  Luckily some friends made it there five minutes earlier, and they were sat immediately... Pretty weird because by the end of our brunch, there were still empty tables.. so far, Bar Agricole is junk..\n2.  I ordered the poached eggs, with spinach and prosciutto and polenta.  The dish was very bland except for the prosciutto but the polenta left much to be desired.  The eggs came out runny which was great as that would make the dish a complete waste if it wasn't, but unfortunately, there was just no flavor to save the dish\n3. The service, while not terribly sucking, was very long.  I was disappointed that two of the dishes came out first and then they had to wait for the other two dishes (for about 2 to 5 minutes)\n\nAll in all, I think I'm willing to go back and try dinner but for brunch, I would rather go to anywhere else (EXCEPT TOAST!)", "author": "Chris H."}

ALL of them did that for me. restaurants such as bar jules, absinthe and SPQR have absolutely nothing on this place. places such as jardinere, flour + water and zuni cafe do not deserve to be in the same league. it has also superseded a couple of my longstanding favorites, such as locanda, perbacco, l'ardoise, frances, cotogna and nopa. incredible. i am always so humbled when i encounter a place that does this for me. \n\nof course, not that it did not already do enough just by the food alone, just step inside the amazing space that this restaurant occupies. it is an architectural wonder for a restaurant, with beautiful light fixtures and a gorgeous outdoor patio. it is quite pretty, and is deserving of a gorgeous date. i hope that when my mother visits me that she will be my gorgeous date!\n\nthe service was also wonderful. our server who served us both meals was very unpretentious, down-to-earth and so humble. my brother and i were in very good hands with her and i applaud her for gluing the whole experience together in this wonderful dining experience.\n\nmy only complaint was that today, when i made reservations for brunch, the restaurant was busy. my brother and i checked in 15 minutes prior to our scheduled time and was advised to grab a drink at the bar and that we would be seated at our reservation time. we were seated 30 minutes after our arrival, due to the fact that the hostess forgot about us. it irritated me because quite a few parties that arrived after us (that probably did not have a reservation) were seated before us and we were not acknowledged again by her until i approached her. it would not have irritated me if i did not have a tight schedule myself today. for a first-rate restaurant, i would not expect that kind of neglect, but you know, s#!t happens.\n\nanyways, i highly recommend this place. i am quite surprised that this place has not received more 5-star reviews as it truly is deserving of them.", "author": "Charlie D."}

The surfaces are hard so it is very loud.   The cocktail part of the meal is spent yelling at each other and the entree part is spent in isolation consuming your own food and not conversing much.

First off, the space is really impressive - they obviously took great care in selecting the materials used and created an amazing space. \n\nThey had also taken great care in the designing of the bar - or I should say bars! What we liked was that there appeared to be one bar specifically for people just coming for drinks or waiting for tables and then there was one in the main dining area which appeared to make all the drinks for the diners. My friend had a Balmoral Whiskey Sour which he thoroughly enjoyed and I actually tried their fresh ginger beer which was very tasty!\n\nWe started with the duck liverwurst and the red butter lettuce salad. Both were good and came in good sized portions to share - though flavorwise nothing amazing. For our mains, we ordered the breaded pork loin and the braised short ribs. This is where I think there was a misstep. The breaded pork loin was actually quite good, but the braised short ribs were kind of basic and one of them was virtually all fat. At first, I thought maybe it just seemed like that from the outside, but as I cut through it was clearly all fat. I would have thought that the chef would notice that when plating. I would normally let the waitress know, but I was filling up fast and wanted to make sure to have room for dessert! I am glad that I did - the dessert was delicious. We ordered the lemon cake with strawberries which came topped with a zabaione and meringue crumbles. Each bite was perfect! \n\nI will probably be back since this place is very close to where I live and I really like the vibe.

I went with 3 of my friends one of which who's idea of a fancy night out is PF Changs.  She was difficult to order for but she also was a trooper too.  The reason I mentioned her is that our server who was one of the best I've had was VERY considerate to her inexperienced pallette.  Whether it was drinks or food she helped and fixed the meal just enough for her to enjoy it.  Will she be back probably not but she did learn a lot about where the world of food and eating have gone in the last 10 years. As for the rest of us the meal was excellent. We tried about 8 different plates 6 different drinks. As expected there were some hits and some misses but it wasn't be cause the food was done bad it was more the fact we were running into flavors and ingredients that were new to some of us. For me personally the hits were Duck Liver on Toast, Anchovies, Spahgetti with Cotchetino, Tokyo Turnips, King Salmon.  Seared Tuna was ok but nothing to write home about. Roasted pepper dish was good at times but confusing at others. Mostly the Padrons we didn't like which normally I would. We also had two deserts which were both plate licking excellent. Lemon Tart (server suggestion) and the Buttermilk Panna Cotta. Oh yeah the cocktails were all perfectly made and as advertised. Fruit Cup for the weak hearted was the star. For more of a kick the Moonraker was my favorite. Probably one of the best cocktails I've ever had to be honest. Overall we'd go back again (without our friend. hah sorry pal) and try everything else. The chef and the server truly cared about food and challenges their patrons to do the same.

I realize that this may be written off as a \"fluke\" but a restaurant of this caliber should not ever allow this to happen.\n\nWe arrived at 8:30pm and were told it was a 20-30min wait for a 4-person table, so we went to the bar. We got 3 glasses of wine and a cheese plate ($18), which we put on our dining tab. 50min later we hadn't been seated, so we asked the hostess who said our table was being \"set up now\". 15min later and still no table, so we asked the new hostess who again said it was being \"set up now\". When we said we'd been told that 15min ago, she said \"...ok?\" 10min later she dropped us at our table - no 'our apologies on the wait' or of any sort. \n\nAt 9:45pm we began looking at the menu and discovered a) prices were quite expensive, b) a large number of the dishes had pork (which I don't eat), and c) there were only a couple, and meager, veggie options (we had 2 vegetarians). When the waitress came to take our order we said we were debating leaving, since we'd waited so long and didn't see many food options that would satisfy our now ravenous hunger. She said she knew we'd been waiting so would send a salad to our table. She also helped create a veggie dish - a pasta entree minus the meat. We ordered this, as well as a duck dish ($28) and a single glass of wine. Here's where things got fun.\n\nAt 10:20pm, we were served the duck. The two of us waited a bit for the pasta to arrive, then started slowly eating, pausing to make it last. Even at this pace, we had finished the entire dish at 10:40pm - still NO sign of the waitress or the pasta. At 10:45pm we flagged her down and asked about the pasta. She informed us she'd done everything she could to influence the kitchen and might lose her job, and that she would send the manager to our table. 5min later he arrived with the pasta dish in a big swoop, put it on the table (\"your pasta, ladies\" - not 'my apologies for your wait') and was about to leave. I think he was actually surprised when we asked him to stay. After a rather ridiculous exchange - where he never once took us seriously until we pulled out the business card of the investor who had sent us to the restaurant in the first place - he said he would comp the meal. We of course wanted to tip for the bartender and waitress who had done nothing wrong and been as helpful as possible, so he came back to us with the total: 4 glasses of wine, cheese plate, duck, pasta = $120.\n\nNeedless to say...

That's exactly my experience.  I am not a cocktail drinker so I appreciated the bartender's measured eagerness in helping me find a specialty concoction that I really enjoyed.  He also highly recommended a local spring vegetable salad which sounds so plain but it was served with crostini and a generous dollop of the \"heart\" of bufala nestled in a grilled fig leaf (a/k/a stracciatella).  Right on! Baby shallots, beets, favas and snow peas.  It was awesome.  The rough hewn homemade spaghetti with oxtail was just ok.  I ordered, but cannot remember dessert, so I'd probably opt out of the final course if I returned.  The space is awfully cool and there is a decent amount of outdoor seating. The trance music got on my nerves a bit.  A more rock-oriented soundtrack would better fit the vibe and space in my view.", "author": "Jason N."}

Although one thing was a little odd -- one of our party ordered a gin and tonic, and we were told that they don't carry tonic?  Well, who cares -- I don't drink gin and tonics.  Anyhoo . . .\n\nFirst time, the pasta (with Dungeness) was PHENOMENAL.  Best pasta dish that I've had in years, outside of the lobster ravioli at Acquerello, but that's really an unfair standard to hold any other restaurant to.  The flavor of the pasta itself really shone through, and I literally ate the dish noodle by noodle.\n\nSecond time -- spaghetti puttanesca.  So unbearably salty that I couldn't finish.  Thanks to my immigrant parents, whose philosophy is that every molecule of nourishment must be consumed, I am NOT one to leave food on the plate.  But I did, because I felt kidney stones starting to form in my innards.  I even tried to take each noodle and discretely sort of \"wipe\" it on the edge of the dish to get some of the sauce off, but it was still just crazy salty.  It probably ended up looking like I was doing weird things with my food, because I realized in hindsight that one does not discretely \"wipe\" a noodle.\n\nAnyhow, I don't know that I'd return -- I can deal with blah food (good thing, since that's what I cook), but not food that makes me want to stop eating it.", "author": "Charmaine Y."}

The room absorbs noise well which is a plus for me.  \nBoth times I ate there I had the liver toast which is one of those little dishes you crave later.   The Scotch egg had such an unusual name that I had to try it too, both times.   The duck con fit is superbly done and is very savory.   I also tried the Sea Bass and was very happy.   I think the food here gets very high marks.   \nThe service here is unusual as the staff move in a very orchestrated way so as to not intrude.   They are omnipresent yet invisible!

Initial greeting by hostess was very friendly and kind and even though we hadn't a reservation on a Friday night at 7:30, somehow the hostess fit us in. Very gracious service.\n\nThe restaurant was overflowing with guests. Even so service was good and we did not experience the wait that others have noted here. As with a number of other SF restaurants, cocktails are interesting though the two different cocktails we ordered tasted suspiciously similar. Loved the wine list. Exceedingly well chosen. Superior,  eclectic producers with reasonable pricing. Many intriguing wines from which to choose -a veritable playground for wine lovers. A good place to stretch your wine comfort zone. \n\nFood wise, enjoyed the Puntarella salad, chicken livers on toast and crab pasta. Given the amount of people in the restaurant, food timing was slow but understandable. \n\nOne word of warning. If you intend to have conversation with your guests, DO NOT sit downstairs. Many, manta decibels higher than main dining room, which was fine as far as noise. Actually the noise was physically uncomfortable downstairs.  \n\nDo go, do explore the wines offered  and do sit upstairs.", "author": "Oolie M."}

Everything was salted, seasoned and cooked to perfection. The quail was our favorite and the spaghetti was different but out of this world.\nRoasted peppers and fried okra were fresh and bursting with true flavors. Okra, not too slimy, perfectly cooked.\n\nThe thing is, though very tasty, the portions were so SMALL to a point where we spent 90 dollars each for drinks and food ... just need to bump up the portions a little.

Our table with looked after without too much over-fussing or any pretentiousness. The staff was so lovely and friendly... and smiley. \n\nCocktails were all delicious. Monkey Glands tastes as pretty and delicate as it looks. Tequila Fix had great balance of sweet pineapple tang, and a spicy burn aftertaste. I thought the Presidente was going to be a syrupy asskicker, but it was incredibley  delicious because the bartender tamed it with the fresh citrus and orange bitters. Also a great, unusual wine selection. \n\nFood was amazing, fresh, and really showcased the ingredients. I felt that all the simple sides were elevated just the extra notch. Such as the shishito peppers and the ridiculous goat cheese sauce in the consistency of burrata cheese (whhaat?! this exists? yes, yes it does), or squash blossoms with a (smokey?) chive aoili, and the fresh ceviche paired with rich, creamy uni and avocado. \nI could keep eating the grilled squid for days and days annnd dayyyss. Honestly, smokey squid, crispy cauliflower, salty olives and bright preserved lemon pieces... there is nothing better. \nThe other guests at my table had the Oxtail soup, which they were blown away with because it had a childhood comfort of french oxtail soup, but the flavors were much better because the meat was caramelized and crispy, and the broth had deep garlic flavors with nice light spring vegetables. \nAnother dish was the porcini mushrooms with pureed hazelnut, and fried egg. Meat eaters and vegetarians alike should go crazy for this dish.. unless you don't like mushrooms... then who are you? \n\nAt first upon reading the dessert menu, I was not excited. On a personal level these simple, classic desserts typically never turn out pleasant as expected, so I was wary. However, we were blown away at how good each one was! The panna cotta was such a nice consistency and the rhubarb at the bottom was perfect (not tart). The lemon tart was great because the ricotta balanced the tartness and the crust was super buttery and crummy (crummy in a good way!!), and the chocolate cremeux was very creamy and the almond granita a great texture and added flavor. \n\nAnyways, my post shows that I think I enjoyed my night, and I think I'll be coming back!

First the restaurant itself is beautiful.  The dining room is modern and really pretty, and the bar area very inviting.  The service we got was again top notch.  The waitstaff and hostess were great.  We actually arrive about a half hour early for our reservation, and the rest of our party wasn't there.  So we figured we would hang out at the bar for our table.  When we checked in, we told them we would be fine to have a drink at the bar while we waited.  The hostess said, since our bar is currently full, would you prefer to be seated now and wait for your party there?  Really?  Awesome!  What a pleasant surprise!  I'm used to just waiting where ever there is room, and being told they can't seat me until the entire party is there.  The cocktails here are delicious. I'm very picky about cocktails and they know how to make them right.  They do a lot of prohibition era cocktails with their own twist.  And they know what they're doing.  I really appreciate a well made cocktail.  Then when we all were there ate family style ordering a bunch of apps and entrees.  All were good, we especially enjoyed the spaghetti.  Delicious.  We all enjoyed each dish that arrived.  Pacing of the courses was great, and no one rushed our meal or slowed it down.  Desserts also were good, we had one of each, my favorite was the lemon tart.

Seasoning was kind of bland but maybe it would have been fine had my fish not been so overcooked. Oh, and there were these fascinating roasted beans on the side.   Flash broiled to give them a slight crusty exterior.  It would have been great had they not been INCREDIBLY SALTY.  I could only eat a few of them, and the overwhelming salt just made my dry fish more tasteless.  Oh, and there is no bread that comes with your meal or anything to nibble on while you wait.

Thad noticed one of the girls wasn't that into her drink and made her another out of his own goodwill and gifted it to her free of charge - amazing service and attentiveness on his part.  this is up there with other places that come to mind when you think killer cocktails: beretta, bourbon & branch, rickhouse. i'd definitely recommend this place for an intimate happy hour with close friends or for cocktails at the bar with appetizers.  i hear the food here is also pretty bad ass, and i can't wait to go back and sample that.", "author": "Veronica Y."}

The service was very good.I got the gnudi and Jovanie got the spaghetti with clams. The gnudi was OUT OF THIS WORLD. i almost ordered another serving but we were going to see a concert so i didnt want to feel like a big fat pig with all the youngsters jumping up and down all around me,so i settled for the the bittersweet chocolate pot de creme. i actually pronounced the t,which made jovanie correct me repeatedly.luckily the waiter did not. and the dessert was amazing. i had no expectations based on some of the negative reviews on yelp but i was pleasantly surprised on my great experience. oh yeah,i forgot to mention the cocktails. jovanie whiskey sour was SCREAMING. my old fashioned was good but the giant eskimo igloo they were calling an ice cube was a bit hard to wrangle but it really made a visual impression.", "author": "Jim M."}

First, we had a hair in our croquettes, and sent them back. Unfortunately the kitchen was so slammed it took 20 more minutes to get our apps. Then my entree (vegetarian rice and beans with a poached egg on top) was cooked completely wrong. The egg had practically been hard-boiled - no runny yolks at all, which was the whole intent of the dish. They were so busy we couldn't find our waiter and finally had to get up and find a manager and ask him if thats how the dish was supposed to be served. He said absolutely not, sent it back to be re-done with a poached egg. 30 minutes later, the re-done dish comes out. The rest of the table has been done for some time. While the egg is now correctly cooked, the dish was so bland it wasn't even worth it - certainly not an $18 dish.  Props for good cocktails, but boo for horrible customer service (even after having to send back a third of our food there were no apologies and nothing was taken off the bill).

We had an 8:30 reservation but we were ten minutes late due to finding parking in the area.(they are near DNA lounge & Slim's) We called the restaurant & they assured us the reservation was still in place. I can admit it's not what I expected in SF. You walk up a ramp into the restaurant passing a wonderfully constructed outdoor area. Many people were sitting there enjoy their beverages. There is a huge glass door revealing the interior of giant light fixtures, modern teak accents & a lengthy bar. We were greeted by a smiling host(always a plus in my book) even though the place was VERY busy. He said we were 2nd in line to get seated & handed us drink menus to get started! While sitting there, Ben(floor manager, i'm guessing) came by with a sparkling wine & apologized for the delay in seating us! Craig is a MASTER @ what he does. I spoke with him about my drink choice(Cuban cocktail) & he said if I was willing to experiment he would craft a Whiskey Derby. (Plus he would take it back if I hated it) It had so many levels of flavors & was an amusement in my mouth! We sat there about 15 minutes and decided to just eat @ the bar since it was so busy & Craig was enjoyable to chat with! I highly recommend the chicory salad. It was so simple but a great combination of fresh ingredients. The cheese platter is also a must, it had some of the most amazing bread I have ever eaten. The white sea bass was my entree. Perfectly cooked sitting on mushrooms & leeks. TASTY! My dinner partner ordered the short ribs that were equally great! We were satisfied. The owner, Thaddeus(who is a mountain of a man, ladies)came by to see if everything was going well with us,(ended up chatting for over ten minutes), he thanked us for stopping in & then gave us dessert on the house! Date cake is all Im going to say!!! We had the Chevre huckleberry dessert too, but the date cake stole the taste test! Cant wait to get to this establishment.

It was the perfect representation of California cuisine: absolutely delicious without being pretentious. It was one of the best meals I've had in the city, and I highly recommend it!\nWe were a party of 5 and since we all wanted everything on the menu, we decided to share. We ended up ordering 2 appetizers, 5 entrees and 2 deserts + a round of cocktails and a bottle of wine. Bill came up to $270 which I think is reasonable considering the extremely high quality of the food and the service.\nThey got that we were going to do family style just from the way we ordered (one person ordered for the whole table) and brought the dishes to our table staggered and perfectly timed so that it felt like a 5-course tasting! They were extremely busy that night but it did not affect our service. The food was incredible and there wasn't a dish that I wouldn't recommend or order again. \n\nService was great, atmosphere is fun - it feels upscale without being snooty.

Drinks were good, standard S.F. shmancy drink price of $10 each... food was very good but definitely overpriced ... like, by double.  I had already eaten a full dinner of cheap sushi before I arrived, so was able to enjoy my time here by sharing two tiny plates of squid ink pasta ($17), the crab salad ($18) and a pastry dessert ($9).  What you're paying for is the ambiance and the crowd of people coveting your seat.  I also loved the bathroom sink ... superb design.  So go early to get a seat at the bar and hang on tight.  With the crowds still coming in ... I doubt the food prices will go down ... so it'll be another long while before I go back there.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-06", "description": "I did not form an opinion of this establishment on the first two times we went.  My wife is a patron of good cocktails and we landed here for the reputation as well as its close vicinity to our home.  My wife liked it from the start based on its cocktails alone.  To caveat my review readers will have to understand that we only come for Sunday brunch.  On Sundays the place is bright and cheery.  It's usually not overcrowded although since they started the brunch service the patronage has gone from just a few to so many that they are spilling out to the outdoor seating.  My initial reaction to this place was confusion.  I did not understood the architecture.  It is both modern with the wispy light sculpture and barn like with the unfinished wood paneling and factory styled stools lining the bar.  The food was equally puzzling.  Biscuits and pate sandwich were definitely very country as well as the frequently played Johnny Cash.  The cocktails are prepared exquisitely like what you'll find in the genre of the Thin Man.  These are all fine things that I've enjoyed in very different environments, but never quite in the same space.  What slowly turned me into a big fan is the attention to details this place puts on everything it does.  The drinks are shaken to a rhythm by our familiar bartender dressed like a saloon keeper.  The eggs are half beaten so you can still see the egg whites and they always taste fluffy soft.  The pickles are of a rare varieties made in house.  My wife and I had to examine very closely the garnish to figure out what it was.  My favorite is the geo-graphics used on the wine list to show region of the wines.  The attention to details even make it to the bathroom where the toilet has a dual flush, pull up for low flow and push down for a full flush.  The final clincher is the family friendly staff.  Everyone there is genuinely happy to see us - my wife, our two year old son, and me.  Over the months we see more and more families come for brunch.  It is indeed a perfect place for the adult parents of a young toddler to be able to come enjoy a sophisticated brunch and bring their son to a welcoming place.", "author": "Ryan C."}

Ate at the bar and at first the service was excellent... they offered suggestions and descriptions on the food and cocktail specials.  Got the two whiskey cocktails.  They were good... a little sweet.  The food was good but not great.  I really liked the squash fritters and chopped liver on toast.  I also really liked the haricots and mustardy potatoes.... although I thought that dish was a bit overpriced....  The rabbit and polenta was OK.  a bit salty on the rabbit and a bit bland on the polenta... which should have been perfect when eaten together I guess... but it kind of wasn't.  The wheat spaghetti w/ tomatoes was also OK... very flavorful tomatos and I love wheat pasta, but a little too much olive oil.  I did not enjoy the apple-huckleberry cobbler with honey-lavender cream.  The cream was poured in and it kind of just became a soupy mess that was more apt to eat w/ a spoon, but all we had were forks.

Well, when they finally got to us, that is.  \nAnd then there was the service.  From the moment we walked in the door (and seated 30 minutes after our reservation, without so much as an apology or a free cocktail), until the moment we left, the service sucked.  There's just no other way to put it.  No smiles.  No attentiveness.  Our drinks took 20+ minutes to arrive.  Our waitress would stop for a second then leave as we were trying to order.  Tease.  She didn't even take our order for entrees until we were DONE with our appetizers.  Actually, she didn't take our entree order at all, someone else did because we flagged him down and asked him to send her over so we could order; but in a few minutes he came back instead.  And no, the place was not remotely jam-packed so that we could blame it on them being overwhelmed.\nSo, yes, the drinks are worth going for (and the cool huge ice cubes!); the food is even worth a second shot, but I've got to tell you: if I go back and get the same crap service, well, it will be my last visit.

We had a reservation for a Friday night and waited FOURTY-FIVE MINUTES to be seated.  The hostess was not exactly what I would call \"especially sympathetic.\"  The pain of the wait might have been mitigated by a comfortable waiting at the bar experience, but no such luck - there was zero room to stand so we were either in the way of someone trying to get behind the bar or standing at the top of the stairs.  This would have been bearable had we managed to get drinks but the bartender was an unfortunate combination of too busy and not especially friendly.  In those 45 minutes most people only managed to get 1 drink and 2 of us never managed to get a single drink!  So, yes, when we were seated, someone who seemed to be far more sophisticated in the ways of dealing with people than either the hostess or the bartender was very apologetic and brought us 2 free appetizers.  That was great and helped make up for what had happened before that.  But the waiter was slow in getting to us and not especially friendly when he got there.  The food was very good (a tad too salty), and of course the free apps. helped a great deal, but we came away feeling as if this place is too busy for its own good and they can't handle the volume.  If the hosts/bartenders/waitstaff are given the benefit of the doubt I assume they are all fantastic but were overwhelmed in this overly busy environment.
