Who can resist coming here in the wee hours of the morning for some of them street tacos?! Well, I sure in the hell can't! Buuut I'm sorry to say... this location just ain't all that it's cracked up to be. Well, at least not anymore?! Maybe I came on a bad night but the last time that I was here, the tacos were just alright.\n \nLast time I was here, I was craving for some steak tacos. I got four of those bad boys because I was being greedy, but I literally could only finish two. One thing that isn't lacking here is portion size! They stuff their tacos to the max with meat and one taco is really more like two. The salsa here is BOMBSY! Their green salsa and pico de gallo are heaven! Chips and salsa are complimentary with your order and they have salsa bar where you can load up on that bomb ass salsa! Despite all of this, my experience was just meh.\n \nThe workers looked exhausted and didn't seem like they wanted to really be there. The inside was pretty dirty with several tables that were cluttered with all kinds of trash and half eaten food. The chips were stale and the steak on my tacos this time around had minimal flavor. Even after dousing them in that good ol' salsa, something was still lacking for me. And don't let me even get started on that bathroom... yikes. With the kind of business that they get here, you would at least think that they would try to upkeep the cleanliness.\n \nOverall, it's a dependable source for late night eats, but I would probably just go to their main location next time if it's not a hassle to get there.", "author": "Shayla B."}

Nothing is more worth it than getting a super burrito with chips and unlimited salsa for under $10. Seriously doesn't get better than that anywhere else as the prices in San Francisco is rising so for them to remain their low prices is truly amazing.

But again very flavorful, chips and salsa and water are free with purchase.\nUsually only one tv works but we usually go there for a short time or order to go on the phone and they always greet you with \"Primo\" (cousin) that is use regularly in many places in Mexico.

So we did what any sensible San Franciscan would do: we Ubered to El Farolito.\n\nWhen they say the city truly comes alive at night, they're not joking. As soon as we walked in we exchanged nods with a security guard. The long line (which went all the way to the door) was filled with some peculiar characters: college students, the aspiring rapper, and a couple with a little bit too much PDA. \n\nDespite that, the line went by really fast. Every 30 seconds, a bell would ring, signifying the creation of a new burrito, or quesadilla, or tacos...or whatever the previous person ordered. Now let's talk about the nitty gritty. \n\nAmbience Rating (2.5/5):\nThis place is super hole-in-the-wall. The booths, tables, and chairs feel quite old. I made a fatal mistake of wearing my pajamas. Let's just say I wouldn't recommend wearing the same clothes to bed after sitting in one of their booths. The busboy did however meticulously wipe the tables after each consequential meal. If you decide to eat at the restaurant, they bring the food to your table. A large TV in the corner of the dining room played live soccer (or football).\n\nFood Rating (5/5):\nListen folks: there's a reason why this place is filled at midnight. The food is delicious. Make sure to get the \"super\" variant of whatever food you're getting. I think that it basically just adds meat and a few other things. While I was waiting for my food, I was given tortilla chips. In a corner was a salsa bar where you could grab from to your heart's content.  \n\nI'll focus on what I got, which was the \"Super Quesadilla.\" When I took my first bite, I knew at that moment that the wait had been worth it. There was a crunchy and soft texture, and the cheese was literally melting in my mouth. The finely cut pieces of steak and occasional chunk of guacamole was glorious. At the end of my meal, I was filled and greatly satisfied. \n\nDid I mention that this was all for under $10? \n\nSummary: \nJust stop reading my review and go to El Farolito. Right now. They care about you, they care about their food, they're open late, they're super cheap, and the food is deliciously filling.", "author": "Lan P."}

I recently moved to the excelsior and started going to this one, out of 5 visits they have gotten my order wrong 3 times, always at least leaving out the guac.  Today they left out the guac again, I returned after eating the burrito and was very complimentary that I love their food but I can't keep going here if they get my order wrong more than half the time, the one on 24th is way more busy and never messes up orders.  The cashier/manager explained I was wrong every time and just didn't notice the guac because they use soupy guac that is made out of more tomatoes than avocados...well even if that was the case that's not really an excuse.  But every time I've believed there's no guac, my burrito has been pure white with cheese and sour cream, not even a green tint.  The dude wasn't even willing to concede they've ever messed up, and on top of it I've gotten the same feeling some other people have, that all the employees are assholes, if you don't respond to them calling out your order like a starving dog they yell at you and mug you.

They are the standard... I picked them up from the airport and asked them what they wanted to do and it was to get some burritos. HA! Yess..\n\nHeaded to the Mission. Found parking fairly quickly on Mission St. not too far from El Farolito. I went with a regular carnitas burrito opting for no cilantro. It was delicious... Just as I remember. Full of flavor and perfectly rolled, double wrapped in foil to consume in the restaurant or on the run. The rice was tasty and the carnitas was smoky pork perfection. I loved it... It was good to be back in the Mission enjoying some El Farolito. My other friend got a chorizo burrito and the other got a carne asada suiza quesadilla. They both were very satisfied with what they ordered.\n\n As customary, you get some tortilla chips for your table. Self serve on the salsa. Green or red, depending on what your preference is. Service was friendly and fast. We got there around 1230pm. It wasn't too packed at the time but as soon as we sat down to eat, the line started growing...

However, I've heard about how good El Farolito is, so I thought I'd give them a try and see what all the hype is about.\n\nI tried their super tacos, one with grilled chicken and one with grilled beef. Super tacos come with cheese, sour cream, fresh avocado, onion, cilantro, and hot salsa on two warm flour tortillas. There was plenty of flavor in each bite, the hot sauce has some heat, and the fresh avocado slices are rich and buttery. The grilled chicken was really good, but I thought the beef was very dry and chewy, like jerky. Two super tacos is roughly the same price as one super burrito, and although I haven't tried their burritos yet, I'm pretty sure the satisfaction and the portion for price is more worth it for the burrito.\n\nI also tried their super quesadilla with grilled chicken, which unfortunately, wasn't as enjoyable.

El farolito does not give you burnt to a crisp, dry, sitting out for a while carne asada. It's actually moist and chewy, cooked to order. \n\nParking is feasible for this location. Hint. Just north is a burger king parking lot if you go through this tiny driveway between buildings. The minimum wage employees couldn't give two fucks if you park there. Street parking is usually plentiful around. \n\nSuper burritos are always a safe bet. Get half shrimp half carne asada. Why? It's harder to meter out half portions so you usually get more. If you're ordering a regular burrito, you're un-American, but it's still good. \n\nThe tacos are just a bit pricy compared to locations in the mission, but the meats are good quality. Personally  I love tacos de lengua. \n\nOh and don't forget the salsa bar. And get a monster cup of horchata.", "author": "Douglas Y."}

My husband and I were bummed (actually I was devastated), and I was not looking forward to going anywhere else, but we were craving a burrito so we decided to come here. We got really lucky and there wasn't a long line (yet), but the guy taking orders was kinda rude and just stared at me waiting for me to speak. No greeting, no nothing. Anyway, I reluctantly ordered two super burritos, one with grilled chicken and the other with carne asada, and filled about five or six containers with their watery salsa. At this point I was soooooo sad that I wasn't getting my favorite burrito and did not think this one was going to even come close.\n\nWhen we got home I quickly opened my burrito and started eating, and to my surprise it was good. I've had burritos from here before, but it's been a really long time, so I guess I had forgotten they weren't bad. I still think the place across the street does a better job and has a better salsa verde, but my carne asada was well cooked and there wasn't too much guacamole (I prefer avocado as opposed to guac, which may sound silly so some, but I just think it tastes better and isn't all mushy). I felt it would annoy the already irritated-looking cashier if I asked for avocado, so I said nothing and prayed I wouldn't regret it later.\n\nAnyway, this is a solid burrito joint and I won't dread coming here if I have to.

I feel extremely lucky that this place serves lengua too because it's not always a common thing on menus and lengua is relatively more expensive than other meats. Although the hot sauce they put in the burrito is almost non-existent, you can always take a few steps to your left and fill up the to go canisters with their infamous green sauce that packs a good punch. Bag of chips do come with your burrito order and I believe they are made in house.\n\nI have ordered their tacos before but have had better elsewhere. Quesadillas are pretty packed full of cheese and the works depending on what you order.\n\nThe frescas are pretty good as well.

All of my friends ordered carne asada tacos (with different levels of spiciness). My quesadilla did not disappoint! The outside was crunchy and the inside was hot and cheesy. It wasn't oily. It was a generous portion for about  $10. I would and should have order another one. I could have easily finish both because I do have big appetite and the quesadilla was that yummy!\nI also got a chance to taste one of the steak taco. It was ok (I'm just not a fan of tacos). It went done my mouth quickly. It had a spicy sauce on it. It did hit a spot. My head is sweating right now by just thinking about it. Chips and salsas were ok. Chips were cold but still crunchy. It didn't taste stale to me.  \nWe left nothing on our plates. All in all I'd say we had a really good late night snack there. I can't wait to go back and try other foods on the munu. A must visit place if you're hungry and in the neighborhood. \nCheers! \nBtw, I didn't get a chance to use their bathroom. That's why I withhold 1 star.", "author": "Tawan G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-31", "description": "The rough part about not living near San Francisco anymore is being far away from this place. The burritos at this particular El Farolito have been specifically engineered for my taste buds. I don't know what they do with their grilled chicken, but as long as that doesn't change I'll make an effort to be their customer when I'm in the area.\n\nI generally get burritos, but my El Farolito saga started with the quesadilla suiza. Grilled chicken and cheese in a fat tortilla - this is a relatively simple combination of food items, no? Yet somehow it tasted like magic. When I transitioned to burritos, I started with the regular burrito. Grilled chicken was now paired with rice, pinto beans, cilantro, onions, and salsa. This combination is more complex and be a little more dynamic as I get mine without onions. The same result: magic. I've since been relatively incapable of moving past the regular burrito due to less than enthusiastic appreciation of sour cream and general lack of a large enough appetite to consume a super burrito, but it's there [and good] if you want it. The regular burrito is a little dry without the super fixins, yes, but their magical salsa verde makes up for it. This is the first place I tried horchata, and while it's not even as good as the place across the street, it's worth getting.\n\nThat more or less sums up the El Farolito experience for me. I've tried other meats (asada and lengua in particular) and other dishes (chile verde mainly), but it all comes back to that regular burrito with grilled chicken, or the quesadilla suiza with grilled chicken if I'm feeling nostalgic. I've taken almost every friend I've ever had here and most of them love the place like I do. We occasionally have to think up some thin excuses to make the trip up here, the thinnest of which was, \"Want to get El Farolito?\"\n\nThe burritos are capable of standing on their own without any input from their human consumer. I don't want to undersell that particular aspect of the El Farolito experience. If there isn't any sorcery going on behind the scenes, I'll eat my shoe - after eating this here burrito.\n\nThe price has gone up over the years, but I don't let that be a deterrent. If I'm going to go to a place whose chefs are wizards, I'm not going to be cheap. (Don't read that as an endorsement to charge more.)\n\nI have a routine where if I go during the week or on a Saturday, I park in the neighborhood above the restaurant. If I go on a Sunday, I park on the street. That part about me not being cheap doesn't extend to parking costs. If I can avoid paying even a nickel for parking, it's generally worth the effort. Yet going to another taqueria when the heart yearns for that magical Farolito goodness... the disappointment sticks for days. Weeks even. I can't betray my one true love, and when push comes to shove, I'll throw the quarters at the meter maid because this little taqueria's worth it.\n\nA note: the more popular location further up Mission is also good. The South San Francisco location is lesser tier, but good. I avoid the San Jose location despite living down the street from it.", "author": "Pedro P."}

Obviously when you stand the burrito up, the stuff inside is going to shift. But there is always one side that has the most meat, I love saving that for the end!

There's just so little time...\n\nOn Saturday, (actually Sunday, 4.24.11 ) I stumbled out of 5A5; this time on my own two feet. Both inebriated, my friend and I asked our DD if we can go eat. Of course being sober, she was in the right frame of mind when she said, \"No, we're going home...\" Hmmm, so what's a girl to do? Easy...DRUNK TEXT!\n\nOne of my friends has an insatiable appetite. He can eat like a garbage disposal and not gain an ounce (*evil eye*). He was at the same birthday bash we were at so I decided to text him. He was game and picked me up from the side of the Embarcadero and ZOOM, ZOOM, ZOOM! (Unfortunately, my other friend was nearly KTFO, so I couldn't get her out of our DD's car.)\n\nMy friend and I got to El Farolito a little past 2:30 AM. There was a short line that moved fairly quickly. Unfortunately, with old age and Asian genes comes lactose intolerance, so I decided to get a burrito instead of the suiza (quesadilla). Lengua (beef tongue) is normally my go-to meat to test how well a taqueria can prepare and cook their meat so I ordered the Lengua Super Burrito without beans which came with rice, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream and avocado. I can't remember the exact price, but I think it was around $7 and chips & salsa were an additional $.80.\n\nTHE LENGUA SUPER BURRITO\nThe burrito was HUGE, but sadly it was bland and poorly constructed. The ratio of lengua to rice was about 35/65. The lengua was unevenly distributed throughout; mainly in the middle, so some bites were purely rice. The rice was dry, bland and was drowned in the overwhelming amounts of sour cream. Cooked properly, lengua should be so soft that it melts in your mouth. However, the lengua at El Farolito was chewy and tough. The copious amounts of sour cream made it difficult to eat more than 1/3 of the burrito so I brought the rest home. \n\nThe next morning, the sour cream had seeped into the rice and through the flour tortilla making it soggy and wet, so I just picked at the lengua. \n\nThe Salsa Bar had 3 types of salsa (from what I remember): Pico De Gallo, Salsa Roja and Salsa Verde. The pico de gallo was fresh but bland, the salsa roja had a nice kick but was watery and the salsa verde was bland and watery. \n\nSERVICE:\nFast and efficient. Within minutes of ordering, your food is brought to your table.\n\nAMBIANCE/D\u00c9COR:\nLOUD and ROWDY which is to be expected, it's past 2 AM after all. Because of the high foot traffic and plethora of drunkies, tables were not cleaned and were sticky.\n\nThe one unisex bathroom was disgusting and reeked like disintegrating urine under a heat lamp.\n\nPARKING:\nWith several dive bars nearby and Taqueria Guadalajara across the street and also open late, it makes finding rockstar parking (within the block) a little more challenging. \n\nPerhaps I ordered the wrong thing and/or I came on an off night, but with SO many 5 Star reviews I expected A LOT more...especially when I was DRUNK!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

But yesterday I put my foot down and said we're going to get the carnitas and the chile verde burritos here.  So we did, and I was totally disappointed. It was the worst carnitas and chile verde I've ever had in any taqueria. The flavor and the quality of the meat were substandard. It is something I'll never order here again. Somebody was not doing quality control. I might still come back here for the beef and shrimp burritos, but never again for the carnitas and chile verde. And by the way, they're as expensive as La Taqueria. So might as well go to La Taqueria if you can stand vying for a seat.", "author": "Sammy G."}

I've been coming here since high school in the late 90's, and they haven't changed a bit (this is a good thing)\n\nI must admit, I used to be thrown off by the the fact that their decor consists of scantily clad pics of Thalia, and big-busomed Aztecan ladies with Mexican flags draped across their chests, but now it's all part of the whole experience.\n\nHere's what to expect:\n\n- Their definition of \"hot\" is consistent with what it is in Mexico, which means hot=burns your taste buds off, mild=hot, and mild=a little spicy. Please take note of this when they ask you want kind of salsa you want on your tacos.\n\n- Ceviche tostadas are damn good. They put minced jalapenos in them and they are hot (refer to definition above)\n\n- Burritos are big and they don't skimp on the meat. Good balance between dry (rice, meat) and wet (sour cream, salsa, cheese, guacamole)\n\n- Free chips and they have a salsa bar - win!\n\n- Good selection of aguas frecas - horchata, agua de Jamaica (hibiscus water for you non-spanish speakers, agua de melon (melon juice)\n\n- Tacos come in a variety of sizes to suit your taste - from plain old meat, oninos and cilantro to supreme tacos with sour cream and all\n\n- Plenty of seating inside\n\n- They're open really late so it's the perfect place to hit up after the club to fill up your belly so you don't get a hangover ;)\n\n- Nachos are ridiculously huge and chock full of toppings - they are really meant for two people, or one really greedy one\n\nI haven't met anyone who doesn't love this place.

Sadly, the cashier today was very rude and impatient...he purposely charged us for a more expensive item, I believe, because we had a long order, 6 items. His annoyance clearly showed on his face and with his tone. When we got back in line to request our refund, he gave us $1 short of what we were owed and explained that we didn't take the taxes into account. But we didn't want to deal with the attitude and potential vindictiveness. He also tried to place the blame of the rung up order on the men preparing the food, who showed him the order he had written down, our correct order--which they had followed to to a T. Yet, he charged us for completely different items and deleted some of our original items when ringing us up. I do believe he was having a bad day, but it's a shame he would resort to pettiness. And even throw his fellow co-workers under the bus. My fianc\u00e9 has been going here for years and it's sad to see that this is the service received.

I always order takeaways and for the most part their Super Burritos are quite good, so are the Super Quesadillas. I love the Salsa bar, it is quite flavourful, and I think I prefer the salsa here to Guadalajaras salsa. The staff that work here are all men whilst Guadalajara has women. The cooks will shout your number when your order is ready and they want you in and out as quickly as possible. But when you are super hungry and puckish El Farolito certainly does the trick.

I ordered the enchilada plate, a regular taco de asada and a super taco de asada. I was disappointed with the enchiladas bc the enchilada sauce was just poured over them. I'm used to having the tortilla dipped in the enchilada sauce then frying it in a pan so the tortilla really absorbs the flavor. The enchilada sauce had no flavor, I had to pour a lot of their chip salsa to give it a kick. The enchiladas were a little cold as well. The rest on the plate (rice and beans) were good and warm. The tacos were ok. I think the carne asada could use a little more salt or maybe seasoning. \nI think I'll stick to the quesadillas de chorizo. Side note, the bathrooms were cleaner that what I'd thought they'd be so good job on that.", "author": "Bianca H."}

I could eat burritos all day if I was able to stomach it.  If I could give El Farolito 10 stars, I would because I think it's one of the best places to get a mission style burrito in San Francisco. The quality of food is always very consistent and I've never had a bad burrito from here. My favorite is the carne asada super burrito, which consists of meat, guac, pico de gallo, cheese, sour cream rice and beans (I think). What I like about El Farolito in comparison to other burrito joints, say... like Taqueria Guadalajara across the street, is that distribution of every layer across the entirety of the burrito. Don't get me wrong though. I love Taqueria Guadalajara's al pastor. Bomb.com. But you know how sometimes some taquerias wrap a burrito in layers? Like you start off eating a burrito with just meat. Then sour cream, then whatever else and it's just not evenly distributed! I've never had that problem with El Faro burritos. \n\nWhat makes me a credible burrito source, you say? Credible is questionable. But I definitely have had my fair share of burritos in my day. You might think? HA! What does a little AZN girl know about them burritos? I've been very lucky to have lived in 3 of the greatest food meccas in California (SF, SD, LA), and being the burrito enthusiast I am, I've always searched for the best burrito in each city. Growing up in SF, I've lived off of mission style burritos. El Farolito always my favorite. When I went to SD for university, I lived off of San Diego style burritos (more specifically carne asada burritos from Vallarta's, Rigoberto's, or Lolita's... or surf and turf burritos from Lucha Libre and their amazing crack sauce). Currently living in LA... actually I haven't found an amazing burrito joint yet but tacos in LA are delicious. Through it all, I still love El Farolito. It just means that it is THAT good.

The food came out fast and we were half way through everything by 2:40am before we even realized what had happened. Sure, I was full and sated but I wasn't very excited. I'm not sure if that was a good thing or not, since the meal was simply forgettable. I wasn't particularly blown away by anything and I was drunk. When I'm drunk, I get blown away pretty easily. They could have snuck a jalapeno into my nachos and I would have ran around the taqueria like Speedy Gonzales, pretending my fingers were six shooters. Luckily for my dignity, they didn't.\n\nWhile my nachos were good, they were just that: good.

I get random cravings for burritos amidst other meals that I could only conclude it's my hidden \"burrito tooth\" calling for a craving.\n\nAnyway, I've had a fair share of weak burritos and burritos that shouldn't even be classified as a burrito, so when the whole world told me that I should try El Farolito for the best Mexican food, I did not hesitate. El Farolito definitely hasn't failed me since the first time I tried them. So far I've tried their quesadillas, nachos, burritos and most recently their tacos.\n\nSo here's the life changing moment. As I mentioned I'm an avid burrito fan, BUT despite having the \"baby\" burrito size I can never seem to finish an entire burrito! And I'm not really the cold food left over type of girl so I had to make minor adjustments to pleasing my \"burrito tooth\"-- I realized that perhaps it was just a \"Mexican food tooth\" rather than a \"burrito tooth\" because the last time I went to El Farolito my friend persuaded me to get the tacos instead of a burrito. At first I was a little skeptical. I mean I've tried tacos at other places and those things seem TINY. I thought that investing my money into a burrito would be the best choice because despite the fact that I can never finish it whole, I'd still be fulfilled. But somehow, I decided it was time for a change and just go with the taco instead.\n\nI went with the shrimp taco since shrimp never seems to fail. When my plate came, I already felt disappointed. I thought a six year old could eat this plate and still would have hunger pangs, but I was wrong! One shrimp taco from El Farolito does wonders. You know the story where Jesus keeps mass producing bread and fish for his people out of no where? I swear that is exactly what El Farolito's shrimp taco did for me. Even though the plate looked like it was little, somehow the Jesus behind the El Farolito kept providing me with fulfilling goodness that I was stuffed with just one taco.

I tried both places El Farolito and Taqueria Guadalajara (Across the street) on the same day and El Farolito definitely won out! The tacos, despite being $2.25 each, they have loads of meat piled a good 2 or 3 inches on their tacos. It was amazing! The pastor was the best I've had in the bay! and the best I've had since leaving Los Angeles! The chile verde and the carnitas are right up there for #2 and #3 favorite behind the al pastor! The carna asada was so-so.\n\nPros:\n- GDG: GOD DAMN GREAT Food\n- Loads of meat on the tacos\n- Friendly Staff\n- Clean (for this type of restaurant)\n\nCons: \n- $2.25 for a taco (usually $1.25 at other places)\n\nOverall: RECOMMENDED!

You really can't go wrong with pastor in the burritos or tacos.  I'm not a huge fan of their tortilla chips, they taste like regular chips you get from the grocery store,  but their salsas are good.

Pretty much the best taqueria in SF, in my opinion. \n\nMy favorite thing to get there is the simple burrito with boiled chicken. Now most folks will get their burrito meats grilled, and I'll admit boiled chicken doesn't sound as appetizing, but trust me. The liquid they use to boil the chicken leaves it both tasty and juicy and it's WHITE meat. No mean feat to keep white meat juicy.\n\nGreat for late night, as that's how most people were introduced to it no doubt. But it's great for lunch as well.\n\nFinancial District people here's an idea... if you close to BART in the Fi-Di, then your just a short ten minute BART ride to El Farolito which is right at the top of 24th Street/Mission BART.

So after years of loyalty to this taqueria I have to give them one star because of what happened to me today.  I go there with my girl and she orders her usual torta and I order a super burrito.  A few minutes after, the young lady brings me 2 burritos, I tell her politely that the order is wrong, i ordered 1 burrito and 1 torta.  I end up going up to the counter  and telling him that my order is wrong.  He says, no I thought you wanted 2 burritos so thats what I wrote down and thats what you got.  I say, look we just want the torta, we havent touched the food, why cant we just have a torta?  Guy looks at me and says \"thats your order because that is what I wrote\".  There was a huge line and I didnt want to hold up the line so I just asked for a bag so I could take the food home because I was tired of the showdown that seemed to be happening.\n\nI totally understand that these folks deal with all kinds of rude costumers and the guy taking orders has to have a thick skin, I  have seen some crazy shit at this location. You get folks saying racist things to the workers, drunk and loud folks, etc.  But I have always, and I mean always, been very polite to the folks that work there.

Close to CCSF the place isn't really around anything special but a nice neighborhood. Here I will suggest three of my most favorite items on the menu and hopefully it will get your taste buds going as well.\n\nAlways giving a generous portion of meat first up is the most common type of food, the burrito. There is a regular size and a super size that you can order. The difference between the two is one comes with everything and the smaller one comes without guac and sour cream. I use to always order the carne asada but over time my favorite had to be the carnitas. Perfectly seasoned pork with a moth watering appetite made a perfect meal. Each bite brought an explosion of flavors that never get old.\n\nSecond up has to be the nachos. Never one to shy away from cheese and chips, this place gives a healthy portion of both along with a ton of meat. Why go to some fancy sit down place and pay more than ten bucks when you can get quality for all around six bucks? The nachos ordered came out huge and fresh and I can tell you they put real cheese on not that cheese whiz stuff.\n\nLast and my personal favorite has to be the quesadilla suiza. Sometimes when I'm just feeling like something with just the meat all compacted together this is what I get. A perfect blend of meat and cheese all shoved together in a compact sandwich type deal in my opinion is amazing.\n\nSince I've been coming here for years now, I always get complimentary chips, I know that they have a policy of charging .50 cents for them but I've never had to worry about that. Just eat in and that shouldn't be a problem. I've always had the best customer service and they even serve you at the table! What's not to like about a fast food joint having some class? Try their horchata or strawberry fresca  and your set for a perfect meal. Also to think that they have a good sized location helps a lot as well.", "author": "Jason Y."}

You can never go wrong by ordering a Burrito de Pollo Asado (tons of flavor in the chicke) or a super quesadilla de carne Asada (sour cream, salsa and avacado just make a killer combination)! On another note, they sometimes  have tacos de tripas (Fried tripe). I know people think it's gross, but just order one, ask for a piece of lemon, squeeze lemong onto taco and throw some salt on it and Bam - Ecstasy! \n\nGracias a todos los trabajadores de el Farolito for making great burritos and Quesadillas!", "author": "John A."}

I really was expecting the world but I think I set myself up for disappointment.  The flavor of the meat was still very good and it was certainly a value with the burrito being pretty big and the prices being A-OK but there were a few things I was quite disappointed.  \n\nFirst off, their green salsa which you get from the side was very watery.  I really dislike watery salsa because when I end up putting it in on my burrito with each bite, it doesn't stay on top of the burrito and ends up dripping to the bottom so everytime you try to get some sauce on the top, you can never keep it there.  It ends up making the burrito soft and harder to eat as you go along.  I like the salsa think and chunky so it ends up staying on top and you can add more salsa every bite you take.  Yum!  \n\nAnd another thing I noticed or maybe didn't notice was the sour cream and some of the other fillings in the burrito.  I noticed mainly the meat, the rice and some beans but alot of the other things like sour cream, guacamole and salsa didn't seem like they were present.  I did for sure order the Super so I am assuming it is supposed to be in there but I didn't read the fine print of what the Super includes so.....\n\nThe other thing I ordered was the Quesadilla Suiza with Carne Asada.  They make a quesadilla different here as they fold it so you can actually eat it like a burrito.  Very different from anything I've had in the past.  It was really cheesy and by the time I ate half a Super Burrito, I could barely touch the quesadilla.    \n\nStill a pretty great deal and I would definitely give them another try but hopefully, it won't be like Gordo, which I have tried over and over again and it has not ONE time been KICK ASS as some customers have stated...", "author": "Mark W."}

I knew as I was driving and saw 16th, 17th, all of a sudden 26th... hrmm!!!! I mean, I remember looking on the map earlier and seeing it close to the Mission/16th st BART. I got directions, but opted not to use them because I forgot to write the address. Instead I used the google text feature and it gave me this location. \n\nAfter finally finding the place as I drove down Mission st. forever long. I parked a bit passed it, but noticed a crowd starting to form on the inside. My friend not knowing anything about Yelp kept saying that it better be good since I dragged her out here at 2am. I just kept assuring her that it was good and hoped the reviews didn't steer me wrong. Man, as soon as I walked in the door I knew it had to be good. The place was full, not only was it full, but it was full of Mexican people! that has to be a sign? no!? yes?! that wasn't racist was it? cmon now...  you know what I mean.  My friend made me refrain from eating too much. I was going to have the super burrito and super nachos along with half her quesadilla. \n\nAfter contemplating over the menu for some time I ended up just getting the super burrito with carne asada for myself hold the sour cream. For her, and myself too I suppose =) was the quesadilla with just cheese and pollo asado. Oh man, the burrito was good sized and muy muy flavorful. Every bite literally had a balance of the guacamole, meat, rice, beans, and salsa. Usually at most places you are eating one ingredient followed by another, but never all at once! It almost felt as if I was back in L.A.  again, wait no... ok maybe a little bit. The salsa verde went perfectly with the burrito. The sauce was also muy muy flavorful and packed a little spicy kick to it. I think I poured it on everything and every bite!!! well not every bite since I had to taste the burrito without any sauce first. FURTHERMORE, the quesadilla was deliche! it came in two little folded pieces with a generous portion of cheese and chicken that was also perfectly balanced with just enough of each. The sauce was so good I had to pour some on my quesadilla too. My friend just watched me go to town on my burrito and half of her quesadilla. It was funny, she made the comment \"Hey, do you realize we're the only Asians in here?\" Literally we were the only non HISPANIC ones in the restaurant at the time. I guess later on during our meal some of the Asians got out of the clubs and made their way over. I might have to subtract one star just because gas is super expensive and I don't think I can afford to drive here from the East Bay all that often, which I might have to. Perhaps I will try the other Mission St. location and see if a difference can be distinguished.\n\nNext time I will have to try the tacos, because just about everyone and their mom was eating the tacos.\n\nService = great and food was brought to our table very very expediently.", "author": "Steven T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-08-20", "description": "\"La Mecca of all taquerias\" is what many people I know call this place. I've been there 3 or 4 times. and 3 of the 4 times that I've been there, I've left very, very disappointed. \n\n      The first time I went, I thought it was alright. Not nearly as special as it needs to be to deserve a name like \"La Mecca.\" The second time, I ordered a burrito with carne asada, rice, refried beans, sour cream, and cheese. When I started eating, I noticed that the meat was still pretty pink and it didn't have too much flavor. I felt a little queasy later that night. Strike One, \"La Mecca.\" \n     The next time, I ordered the Super Nachos. I asked them to make sure they didn't add cilantro, onions, or tomatoes to my nachos cuz I really dislike those things. and not to my surprise, when I got them  they had forgotten the sour cream AND added everything that I asked them not to add. Wtf. someone said maybe it was because I ordered in Spanish and offended them, but to be honest I just dont think the place is good. Strike 2. \n     The last time that I went there, I was already skeptical. I tried a chicken burrito this time, and what happened? It was like a mix of the previous two occasions. A little undercooked, and they disregarded some parts of my order. Strike 3. \n\npeople LOVE this place. I don't know why I keep on having bad experiences here. I usually end up going to the hawaiian bbq place down the street while friends eat here and bringing my food back. It's a typical taqueria, not the cleanest, and the service is eh. So, while others may love it, i still do not see why this is \"La Mecca of all taquerias.\"", "author": "Chris N."}

I didn't intend to rhyme there, but maybe its good that I did.  Perhaps this can become one of my tenets of Yelping or something.  Back to El Farolito (which is Spanish for \"the farolito\"), I had a torta carne asada and a taco camaron (shrimp).  I also tried a few bites of the middle of a companion's carnitas burrito.  The torta was pretty good, the major knock is that I wish they seasoned or marinated the meat just a little, I couldn't taste any.  Normally, this would make me give 3 stars, but the shrimp...oh the shrimp.  it was fresh, it was sauteed in a spicy sauce with some bell peppers and was simply delicious.  Next time I'm in here I'll have to try the shrimp super burrito, which boasts a full dozen shrimp!  The carnitas burrito was very good, meat was tender, everything was in proper proportion.
