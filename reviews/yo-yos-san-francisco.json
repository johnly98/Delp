The menu is pretty simple, udon or soba noodles, chicken teriyaki over rice and prepackaged sushi rolls, dumplings and seaweed salad. You can even get half orders of udon or soba making it even cheaper. I decided to get half an order of Udon noodles ($3.50) and also grabbed a couple of rolls from the freezer on the right ($2.75 each). Payment was cash only.\n\nThe noodles turned out to be pretty good despite their rock bottom price and the broth was not overly salty. The rolls were passable. Overall, this was not a bad meal.

Uh sale on already low priced sushi I asked? What's wrong with it, was it days old? NO she replied, we never do that! Because they were closing for the day, they needed to get rid of all the day's sushi because they're awesome like that -- they ended up giving me like 3 free rolls even though I kept declining, but who doesn't want free good sushi? I think my order was $4 for a sushi roll and seaweed salad! Literally no excuse to not have sushi anymore because of cost, you have found your gem! Oh and I got the California avocado rolls, so good! \n\nI'll definitely be back and ready for some free sushi (jk, I don't expect that).

I'm stuffed after eating everything which is a nice feeling because I don't want to be starving later and spending more money.\n\n4) They are nice people who actually know the names of a lot of their customers. How rare is that? The answer is rare. \n\n5) There are other options (that I have yet to try) and still at a low price!\n\nNot too sure why there are people saying, oh I wish they seared the teriyaki chicken, or the sauce is too sweet, or the quality -- there are two people: a mom and a pop, who are just trying to make it out, give them a break.

I can bathe in the udon broth if there's a to-go container big enough for me to fit in. I've been tempted to drink the entire container and will (intentionally and gladly) do it eventually.\n\n3) the speed - don't fret if the line is out the door, military precision, remember?

Oh, that's right, Facebook and Candy Crush is for the rest of your work day, how silly of me? =)\n\n4) the price - you won't get quality food like this for the money they charge.

I think it might be because it's because this area is a lunch dead zone so they grade on a curve. There are very few places to get a decent sandwich or takeout in this odd little corner of the Financial District. It's equally difficult to walk to North Beach, Chinatown, or below Market Street, so you're kind of stuck with a dozen sub-par choices unless you want to go for a 20-minute round-trip walk or shell out for a $12 fancy salad. I tried the chicken teriyaki, which appeared to be reheated poached chicken with an overly sweet, runny sauce that permeated overcooked rice. A sad orange slice and limp iceberg lettuce with Thousand Island dressing. The soba noodle was better, but not by much. Felt kind of gross and disappointed afterward.

I decided to follow his lead, and am so glad I did. \n\nThe soba noodles themselves are amazing. I'm not sure if they make them in-house, but they sure taste like it. The broth has a great miso flavor with a nice onion-y bite--definitely one of the best I've ever had. The seaweed is--well, seaweed, but it goes great with everything else in there (tempura flakes, bean curd). I had never had tempura flakes before and loved them! Also, the mom and pop owners are really sweet. He politely asked if I wanted to put chili in my soup before closing the lid (which I recommend, even if you're not into spicy stuff).\n\nYou can also order the soups hot or cold, depending on the weather.

I got a half order of udon for $2.25 and a seaweed salad for $1.65.  AND not to mention, it DID fill me up.  If that's not a deal then I don't know what you're smoking.\n\nUdon is usually very plain in my eyes (at least in the states where there is little variation).  It's just simple, salty broth with really fat noodles.  But here they're not as fat which I actually like because they're not as slippery or filled with water.  They top it with kamaboko (that pink and white fish cake), aburaage (tofu pockets), seaweed (big slices), and little puffy things.  Before putting the lid on it, they'll ask you if you want some spice which you can sprinkle to your desire.  Unfortunately what I did notice was that the udon broth was a little too salty to drink by itself.\n\nThe seaweed salad left something to be desired because although it was good, it needs to be eaten with something (udon in this case) or if standing alone, it needs some raw fish or even squid to accompany it.  I saw that they also sell different varieties of rolls to-go which I love!

I got the only meat I could find - rolls with cheap smoked salmon and fake crab meat, and they are barely edible. I feel bloated and unsatisfied.

I'm a super slow eater too. There is only one small table in the corner with 2 stools. Luckily, no one else was expecting to sit down and eat at a place like this, so we got it!\n\nFood\n\nUdon - I cannot believe I did not see a flood of comments about how this isn't really udon. The noodle is not udon noodles, it isn't even the knife cut or the hand pulled with the slight al dente, qq thing going on. It was just some thick noodle that didn't have any of the chewiness I like in a noodle. It came out fast, the soup was good enough, I just wish it had real udon noodle. I'd take that quick frozen boiled udon I get at grocery store. I would not get this again. Confused...call it noodle soup not udon.\n\nSmoke salmon sushi - gummy, rice over vinegared and the salmon never full made it through the sushi rice slices, it was weird... the fish would only go half way through each rice sushi slices. ($2.75). Not worth getting.\n\nWakame salad - standard. \n\nSo if you're looking to support a small business with good service and eat something cheap, fast and hot go for it. I probably won't be back, but there was a continuous line during my 15 minutes in the store. Efficient service. Imagine if the food was better...this place would be even busier.

Reviews here mentioned \"better than supermarket sushi\", so I figured it was worth a try - not expecting or looking for gourmet standard.\n\nFirst concern was that the sushi was prepacked but not placed in a refrigerator unit. It was reasonably cool in that area but not cold enough. However, it did taste fresh, so fingers crossed it will be fine. Second issue was the range or choice. There really wasn't much in the way of options, and the rice to filling ratio was a little high.\n\nHaving got the gripes out of the way, this is ok sushi. Nothing particularly special but acceptable for a grab-and-go lunch. As long as my stomach remains happy this afternoon 3 stars is about right. The fish tasted fresh and the rice was good. They gave me (white Englishman) chopsticks and didn't ask if I wanted a fork. I like this.\n\nI will probably come back if I want a light lunch and I'm in a hurry in the future.

This is the second time in 18 hours that you have put me in a food coma.  I think I barely made it back to my office.  I could feel the food coma setting in as I made the 8 or so block walk back to my office.  Ahh, the safety and seclusion of my office.  Close the door, write this review, and find a comfy place under my desk to sleep it off for a while...\n\nThat being said, this place is great.  It's crazy cheap. Crazy I tell you.\n\nAnd crazy good.\n\nI got the full order of Udon soup with everything in it, as well as the addition of tempura and tofu. Yummmmmmy.  The noodles tasted much better than many of the noodle shops I've tried around San Francisco (Suzu, in Japantown, being the best, IMO).  The broth was great.\n\nI also ordered some premade sushi rolls, but I wasn't even able to eat them yet.  They look like the type you'd get from Safeway, so I'm not terribly excited about them. But the soup! Oh my. Fantastic.\n\nI'll be back.  Maybe next time I'll bring a wheelchair.  It was close this time. Too close.  I could have very easily ended up passed out on the street.\n\nOne caveat: There is no seating here. Unless you want to sit on the wife's lap. And she seemed really nice, so she might let you if you asked nicely.  It's take-away only.  I enjoyed mine, however, in a park only a block towards the water on Pacific. You can't miss it. And there is a cute water fountain/sculpture to sit near.  There were also a few really cute girls there. I don't know if they'll be there when you go, though. Sorry.\n\nUpdate: I'm an idiot and just ate some Milano cookies, even after all the talk of the food coma. Owwwww.  I'm screwed once my metabolism dies on me.

That being said, YoYo's udon soup is pretty good. Not quite there, but almost. The broth is a little more oily than I'm used to, and it comes with an inch-thick layer of seaweed and fried tofu on top, unless you ask them to hold it. (City Hall's udon has fresh veggies and not-fried tofu. MMM.) The seaweed is good, though. Mild in flavor and good for you. They're generous with the chicken, too, and it's really very inexpensive. I really like that you can get a half order for just $3.00. (It's more if you add the meat.) And, they let you shake as much chili powder as you want onto the soup, which is key.\n\nOverall, a solid lunch option for financial-district indentured servitude.

It's just a hole-in-the-wall so you're taking it back to your desk, or walking over to the park to eat it.   Lines can be long on cold days, right at noon, but otherwise, you can usually get in and out in five minutes.

Since we were coming from near Market and 1st - it was a little bit of a hike for us, but damn was it ever worth it.  \n\nThe udon is just so great and filling.

Personally, though, I'm just going to stick to the udon.  \n\nThings you should know when preparing your personal pilgrimage to Yo Yo's:  It is cash only, the sushi is terrible (stick to the udon and, from what I hear, the chicken teriyaki), and there is no seating provided (there is however a nice park where you can sit at a fountain while enjoying your soup only a block away).

So you wind up putting it on your \"to try list\" to see exactly why it's so popular. Regarding Yo-Yos, I still haven't figured out why people are willing to stand in line. Possibilities: 1) I guess because it's cheap people are willing to sacrifice taste 2)  they're lazy like me and can't walk to Myth a block down to get something gourmet 3) The cool affect: I'm cool because I'm waiting in line at a hole in the wall sushi shack. How hip of me.\n\nI'll be honest. I've tried everything they have to offer multiple times because I'm lazy and my office is right there but I would never wait in line and only go when I can squeak in at non-peak times. The noodles are so-so, and within minutes I can feel the MSG coursing through my veins. The sushi isn't great and I'm not one to risk eating bad sushi. .

I scanned the Yelp reviews in advance, to have an idea what to expect.  Well, I expected a hole in the wall, but I was surprised that the place is very clean and not at all run down or anything.  It is small, so maybe technically a hole in the wall!  But not the run down or dirty type place that implies.  The couple were both very friendly.  I am vegetarian and asked if the broth was veggie.  The broth is fish-based.  I asked if the cold soba noodles are veggie.  No, they are cooked in the same broth.  But the lady was nice and took some of the other soup ingredients and put then on rice to make a veggie meal for me.  How nice!  It was white rice, some kind of sauce, green onions, tempura batter, plus seaweed and bean curd.  The bean curd was yummy and I wished there was more!  It was ok, but not great.  Only $3.25 though, which can't be beat!  The lady was nice and apologetic about the veggie thing and said she hoped I liked the meal.  I tried to, but afterwards I had some fishy burps, so I wonder if something in there had been in the fish broth too.  Maybe I was just reacting to the seaweed, who knows?  The other vegetarian things they have are seaweed salad (cold), edamame, and california rolls.  I probably won't go back unless I feel like california rolls, but I'd definitely recommend this place.", "author": "Stacey B."}

Cheap as it gets.\n\n3  Seaweed salad:  Standard stuff.  Very good.\n\n4.  Don't miss out on the sweet rice things that are wrapped in a sweet tan colored wrapping thing.  I wish I had a better way to describe them, or even knew what they are called.  Buy them.  $1.50 . . Cheaper than a cookie, and better for you.\n\nGo to Yo Yo's!  Very good food for the price, and the two people running the shop could not be sweeter if they were on T.V.", "author": "will h."}

The owners are super friendly & the sushi chef is a freakin' riot. Watch for unique sushi creations like the \"burrito roll\" (it comes wrapped in tin foil just like a burrito...brilliant!).", "author": "Casey R."}

On days when I'm trying to eat healthy, I can grab edamame, wakame salad, and some fruit for under $5. The line moves quickly and Mr. and Mrs. Yoyo always brighten my day.

It's still pretty tasty, but the portions are smaller AND more expensive. WTF?  Hitting the customer on both ends??!!   They've started using new packaging, maybe that's what's driving the price up.  It's still very affordable, and the Udon is awesome. I really like the wheat noodle, can't remember what that's called - Soba I think it is.  Extra tofu cake. yummy.  \nRolls are ok, nothing special.", "author": "Laura H."}

Been coming here for a few months on a regular basis, sometimes even 2-3 times a week and the lady behind the counter knows what i want now...was kind of funny one time this guy who kind of looked like a homeless guy walked in and started talking about things randomly and got some free food after like 5 minutes.", "author": "kenny w."}

Take this as a good sign. The place is barely a walk-in closet, but you'll be in and out in two minutes tops. Be prepared to tell the smiling woman in back what you want, she'll ask. You're having full udon (or just half if you're not too hungry) with everything. When the nice man at the cash register asks \"spicy?\", pour a couple thumbnails-worth in there -- spicy goes a long way.

The two owners double team the restaurant and are genuinely siked to serve you. While the sushi quality isn't the best, it still satisfies your sushi cravings without going out and spending 10 bucks. The udon is where it's at, strongly recommend getting all three fixings (tofu, seaweed and tempura).

For the past year or so, I've been playing go at lunch with a coworker every Wednesday. And for the past year I have drooled over his chicken teriyaki while I much on whatever I am eating that week. With my lunch forgotten today, I decided to hop in to Yo Yo's and see what all the fuss is about. I was able to get 9 veggie sushi, a seaweed salad, and daifuku for $5 even. That was easy! The sushi was good for veggie, the avocado obviously ripe and fresh, the cucumber was tasty, and the carrot was marinated in something tangy, probably rice vinegar. The seaweed salad was good, but tasted the same as every other seaweed salad I have ever had (and was a few dollars cheaper!). I got there probably around 12:15 and there was no line, so maybe I was just lucky. If you're looking for a quick, cheap, relatively tasty lunch, Yo Yo's is a safe bet.
