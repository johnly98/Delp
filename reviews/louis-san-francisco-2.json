The wait to get in is crazy on weekends, but very quick during the week day mornings. Food is pretty consistent. You come here on a slow morning for the views. It is amazing and my only reason to really come back when i have time to eat a slow breakfast. \n\nFood:\nI have only ever ordered breakfast. When we came in i had Greg's cheesy cheese plate with chili, pancakes, bacon, potatoes and English muffin. My gf had eggs Benedict, with an English muffin. The food was great, pancakes were exactly how you would want them, very fluffy and sweet with the added syrup. My chili plate was really good, but very very cheesy. Overall a solid breakfast.\n\nService:\nAs to be expected, we came in, seated quickly, ordered and it came out quick. It's breakfast food so not much need for a lot of additional things from the waiter except box and check. Overall good service\n\nPricing: \nPretty pricy for breakfast food and service. You're paying for the view mostly.\n\nOverall:\nYou would never catch me here on the weekend, but every once and awhile during the week I will stop in for breakfast. Great place with great views.", "author": "Robert R."}

The weeknight we dined here, she was the sole waitress and host.  She was doing it all and very well. So personable.\n\nThe food however is basic diner fare, nothing fancy schmazy or innovative.

Up to date decor. \n\nI had a cup of minestrone, that came with sourdough sandwich slices n butter, and a side salad. The Mister had fish n chips.  The soup was tasty.

Who can get away with cash-only transactions these days? Doughnut shops, inexpensive pizza slice joints and very cheap hole-in-the-wall restaurants.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-01-24", "description": "I've been to Louis' twice in my few years living in the Bay Area and I have to say that dining at this restaurant is one of those experiences you should try once in your life - especially if you enjoy comfort food and views.\n\nA little background on Louis': this family owned restaurant has been here in the exact spot since 1937, when it opened on Valentine's Day. It overlooks Ocean Beach and Sutro Baths, once a famous bathhouse in the early 1900's until it burned down from a huge fire in 1966. Fun fact: there's a picture on the window at Louis' which shows what the bath house looked like back in the day!\n\nThe restaurant itself sells pure American food. From around morning til 2pm, you will have your assortment of brunch items that include popular items such as Eggs Benedict and pancakes. Afterwards you have lunch items ranging from sandwiches to burgers. \n\nThe first time I arrived at Louis', both my friend and I were spellbound by the amazing experience you get at the restaurant. Most of you have probably heard about Cliff House, that high profile, super expensive restaurant overlooking Ocean Beach. Yep, that's right next door to Louis'. As an alternative, if you just want good views with decent food, Louis' is where it's at: the restaurant is small, but it's completely surrounded by windows overlooking the beach. Even though crowds can be huge (get here before noon), definitely wait until a spot opens up right next to the windows. The experience is WORTH THE WAIT. \n\nI highly recommend you come for the brunch. My friend and I made it in time to get their Eggs Benedict with a few pancakes on the side and I thought they were great! The food wasn't too pricey and the portion sizes are enough to satisfy you. I really enjoy the service was well; generally, family owned restaurants have amazing service and Louis' is no different. \n\nIn contrast, I thought the lunch items could have been better. The second time I went to Louis', we got some clam chowder to split, my friend got the tuna melt, and I got the steak sandwich. First impressions overall was that the clam chowder was good (not too chunky and its red not white), the tuna melt was extraordinary, but the steak was pretty mediocre. The bread was a bit too hard and the steak needed more juice. That said, for the price you can't go wrong.\n\nOverall, I would come to Louis' purely for the view. The food here is great, but it's not going to be Cliff House quality or some great brunch food. You'll be satisfied, but more often than not the feeling of being next to the water without paying $$ transcends the desire for amazing lunch. \n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

There were several tables available and we got seated in the far back corner (still a good view) but I asked if we could get the corner with two windows....and with a sigh, eye roll and reluctance we were moved.  I didn't want to believe that race played anything into this as my daughter and her girlfriend are both bi-racial (black).  \nFast forward to Sunday and all bets are off on whether this place is racist or not....they are! \nRemember my niece is visiting and my youngest daughter is with me...both bi-racial....\nHere is the scene; its busy...think line out the door busy.  I drop the girls off to check in so I can go park. They call me to say that they can't add us to the list until the entire  party is there as well as an adult.  My niece is 20 and said she was an adult....this wasn't good enough, I run down after parking and we sign in to be seated, we are told it will be about ten minutes.  OK...we will wait.  A man walks in behind us and says how long is the wait for a party of four...15-20 minutes.  He says ok please add us...but there is only one person, no questions about his party or anything.  \nA couple of minutes later three young white women walk in and ask how long the wait is....they are told \"if you want to pull up one of these chairs (points to a row of empty seats where guests wait) you can sit at the end of this table here\"....so they do.  My 15 year old daughter and 20 year old niece are shocked...upset and say...\"did that just really happen\"...I said, \"it sure did...we can go.\"  My daughter says that she is hungry so we can stay but asks that we talk to the hostess privately.  So we are seated about fifteen minutes later....my daughter sits down and bursts into tears.  This is totally unlike her to be so emotional in public...I go into quiet mama bear mode and ask our server to send the hostess over before we order...who by the way took another guests drink order before taking ours even  though we were seated first....perhaps he was giving us space to console my daughter.  Anyhow, the hostess comes to our table...I tell her the situation I observed about all of the above, how it seemed racially motivated and she assures me that race never played a factor.  I pointed to my daughter several times and said...\"you have a young teenage woman crying here because of what she perceived to be blatant racism\"....you think you might want to apologize....she doesn't, she just keeps saying that we were waiting and she gave us a good table because of the wait....which I call BS...she kept saying that we asked for a booth....which we didn't....eventually she apologized to my daughter for making her sad.

She told me she would send a waitress over & still nobody came. (There were about 3 people on the floor during this time & it wasn't a busy morning either) A waitress came and took the order of the table beside us but failed to come back to take ours so I approached the cashier & asked if I could just place my order there. She said she couldn't take orders so I mentioned that nobody has come to do so & returned to my table. Waited another 5 mins for nothing. My roommate this time approached one of the waitresses at the bar just to be RUDELY cut off and told \"the waitress would be right there!\" Pointing at the single waitress waiting tables and said \"she's just finishing up she'll be right there!\" as if so irritated that we wanted our orders placed.

In a city where food can be crazy expensive, my hat is off to Louis' for serving up simple fare for simple prices. Surely you could gut the place and hang all the Edison bulbs and industrial lighting with reclaimed wood tables and turn each table for hundreds of dollars each night. But these guys just keep doing what they've done for decades: serve us that simple food and keep it cheap.\n\nThe waffle is a waffle. Small grid. Circular iron. Batter poured in, served with a little butter and syrup. The eggs are eggs. I got an eggs and chili concoction with cheese, and it's just that: eggs, with cheese, covered in chili. The breakfast is diner food. The lunch is diner food. You're not paying any premium for locally sourced organic blah blah ingredients, and maybe only a slight premium for the real estate. But a few cents on a million dollar view is nothing.\n\nThis is old school charm. Like, cash only charm (who carries cash anymore?) and we don't exactly remodel very often charm.

With the fried prawns the portion size was small with only 7 below average sized prawns.  The prawns had a good crunch on them but were not fresh. The burger was below average it tasted like the ground beef was not seasoned at all.\n\nThe best part of the meal was the Clam Chowder. It was seasoned well, not too salty and not overpowered by the acid of the tomato base which are common problems in a lot of Manhatten style clam chowders.  While the base was good, like the prawns the seafood in it was not fresh.\n\nThe place is cash only which is unacceptable for a sit down restaurant in silicon valley in 2016.  If I can buy fresh produce at a farmers market with my credit card then there is no excuse for why I shouldn't be able to do the same here.\n\nTo me this place is nothing more than a below average diner that has a great location.

The hostess was nice enough, but the server that gave us the menu and the server that took our order made It clear they did not want to be there. No smiles, no greeting, not much effort at all. The only chatting, laughter and smiles I witnessed the entire time we were there were from the cook, the other two workers and a friend sitting at the counter. \n\nNow onto the food. I ordered the classic Benedict and my husband the cheeseburger. The Benedict sauce was obviously from a powder mix and the potatoes were frozen and cooked in a deep fryer. It was overdone, dry and tasteless. The plate had no garnishment and looked unappealing. The cheeseburger was small and the cheese looked like processed cheese. The only provided ketchup and mustard in its containers. We had to ask for mayonnaise and they were chintzy about the portion. The serving of fries were only a nominal handful. We ordered a coffee (no refill or top-off offered) and a coke. Husband had to ask for a refill twice, and still server never offered me coffee. The total bill was nearly $40. OH! They only accept cash!! There is an ATM by the door and it charges you over a $2 service fee. \n\nThe only thing they have going for themselves is the view and the location.  I can't give them stars for that. They didn't earn it. It's unfortunate the restaurant uses this to their advantage and forgoes providing a good meal. I am very disappointed and will not be back ever. \n\nOh, one more thing. The place was closed for a bit for its renovation. The only thing I noticed that was changed was the bathroom. Other than that everything looked the same, maybe new equipment in kitchen or a new dishwasher, but even than, the place didn't look immaculate. Crumbs, signs of liquid drips on stainless steel and rack next to coffee maker was rusted and dirty. Gross! Maybe instead of yucking it up with their friends, they should clean. \n\nOkay, that's it for me....I'm so done, so done with this restaurant. It's a shame since its been around for over 50 years.", "author": "Kalo M."}

It's not hipster brunch, it's a regular, inexpensive place, with an amazing view.  I was so happy when they remodeled a few years ago and made it look so much like it used to look!  I think the food is simple and delicious.  Fluffy eggs, fresh greens, tasty coffee, unassuming french toast the way diners make it, not all fancy bread and fancy sauces.  And the folks who work here are really attentive and sweet, even when it gets busy on weekends.

Like yelp says A-Ok. Very much diner food. My hollandaise sauce I think came from a packet.  Not bad per say, but flavor? Not so much.  My eggs were actually poached really well.  I was impressed with that.  The potatoes, were potatoes. I think they may have been previously frozen, but were nice and crispy.  The bacon was actually pretty tasty too. \n\nView = 6 stars. Maybe 7. I mean, on a sunny day it really doesn't get much better than this.  There are some none window seats, but really not that many...\n\nService = 4 stars. Everyone seemed friendly.  The food came relatively quickly.\n\nWait = 3 stars. We waited. 15 minutes. But it was a saturday at 10:30 on a beautiful day. What are you going to do?  \n\nCoffee = 1 star. Denny's anyone?  (I actually secretly love bad coffee, so I didn't mind at all, but at $2.50 I still have to give it one star)/\n\nPrice = 2 stars.  Normal San Francisco more than I really want to pay, but for Diner Quality? I mean I COULD go to Denny's and pay maybe half as much.....\n\nIn conclusion: worth it for the view. Absolutely.

The interior looks and feels like a diner -- I personally love diners, so this is a plus. The food tastes like diner food (not horrible Denny's, more real than that!). I'm talking about the kind of diner that families used to stop at when they would take road trips all across the nation, and it gives that kind of nostalgic feel, too.\n\nI've never had a dish that made me go woah. Everything's just decent and satiating. We've tried most of the egg dishes, hamburgers, fish and chips, pancakes.\n\nService is usually great 90% of the time . . . like you would expect from a traditional diner. Am I getting the gist across here?\n\nI do love their coffee. Keep the refills pouring into those small mugs! Maybe it's the mug? I don't know. I like it better than bluebottle and all the other fancy shmancy coffees in SF. Yes, it's not as strong as a lot of their blends, but it's juuuust right every time we go whether you like it black, with milk, or whatever.\n\nAnd that 4th star? The view, of course. Unless it's a blue-sky day, it's always different when we look out and I love that unpredictability. Sometimes you'll see the fog slowly disappear and reveal a gorgeous view. Other times you'll see giant birds up above riding the wind. Sometimes you'll just see people doing funny and unexpected things out at the Sutro Baths.\n\nWe love getting the booth and bringing visiting family and friends to this joint. We've always arrived before any lines early in the morning ~7/8. Pretty easy to find parking.\n\nBest part: everyone leaves happy every time.", "author": "Michelle D."}

We only stopped in for a snack and the fries we ordered were bland and overpriced and looked like something you could find for a better price at the supermarket. Another two of our party came in just to sit and not order and while the hostess told them that ordering something would be fine, the waitress with no name rudely told them they would be \"holding the kitchen up\" and that all she could get them was water. While we waited for water refills and the check, our red headed waitress catered to everyone around us and ignored the fact that all we wanted to do was leave.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-02-18", "description": "This place was a disappointment especially because I wanted it to be good so I could make it a regular lunch spot. My takeaway was that this place rides on the fact that they will probably always get business from people stopping to look at the menu at The Cliffhouse and then swiftly running in the opposite direction (don't get me wrong, love the food at The Cliffhouse but the prices are laughable. $30 for 3 scallops and a tiny scoop of Israeli couscous? no.) SO anyway, this place knows it will appeal to somebody who wants to pay less for lunch so they still overcharge- just not as much. I ordered the shrimp louie salad. This salad has no write to be called a Louie. Scattered on a small plate, it had iceburg lettuce, a small portion of bay shrimp, one hard boiled egg, halved and 2 thin slices of tomato, on the side there was (brace yourself) BOTTLED Thousand Island dressing... my co-luncher ordered the fish and chips... shaking my head..... disappointing doesn't cover it... I want to say I'm a little disgusted. For OVER SIXTEEN STUPID DOLLARS!!!! he got 2 grease-laden pre-breaded and frozen pieces of fish which lay in a pool of oil and some fries. I will say the tartar sauce was good, the saving grace if there was one. Oh I forgot, he got a cup of \"manhattan clam chowder\" before his fish and I just have one question about this soup: Does Campbells make large cans of that soup or do you have to open one can for every 2 cups you serve? That might amount to a lot of cans... \nOh and the soda is Pepsi yuck AND IT'S $3.25 FOR A GLASS PEOPLE! \n\nSo the bitter icing on the poor quality, overpriced cake was they are cash only but they generously provide an atm where you are forced to pay a fee to get money to pay. Now, I come prepared to most places that they might be cash-only but not a place where you're spending almost $20 a plate for lunch. I bet that ATM makes a killing because the average prudent person wouldn't think a place like this is cash only and furthermore, a lot of people may not carry THAT much cash on them.

That, and it was FREEZING out, so I thought that a hearty bowl of clam chowder sounded good. \n\nI forged my way up the embankment to Louis', looked over at the Cliff House, contemplated the walk over there and then just decided to grab something at Louis since I was so close. I think I should have made the walk to Cliff House.\n\nIt was approximately 4pm on a shitty, overcast, freezing cold Friday, so there weren't many people around. I chose a booth with a good view, although it was dirty. The waitress was okay, nothing extraordinary, although she wasn't very good at her job. \n\nTo my dismay, they only had Manhattan Clam Chowder, which has a tomato base. I was hoping for a creamy New England, but oh well. It's a good sized bowl and comes with a clump of sourdough and some butter. \n\nThe soup tasted like a salty tin can. NOT IMPRESSED. I forced it down and then thought that a piece of cheesecake might get that taste out of my mouth. The waitress comes back over and I tell her these exact words: \"I think I'm gonna try a piece of cheesecake. Does that come with a topping?\"\n\nShe says yes, strawberry or chocolate syrup. I then tell her \"Strawberry sounds good, I'm thinking I'm gonna do that.\" \n\nSo I sit and wait for my cheesecake. And wait. And wait. And then wait some more. She finally comes back over and asks me if I would like anything else. I said \"yeah, the cheesecake.\" \n\nIt was good cheesecake, but their service blows ass. The wait staff act as though they don't want to be there. Perhaps it was just that day, who knows. They ARE a bit pricey for a diner and for the quality of food they serve.\n\nI honestly don't think Louis would be proud to have his name on the place these days.

You got your omelettes, salads, etc etc and my co-worker suggested we both get steaks. I was down for big slab o' meat so that's what we went with. It comes with either salad or soup. I got the soup (Manhattan clam chowder, the tomato based one!) and he got the salad. The chowder was salty as HAYYYYLLL. I practically diluted it with my water. My co-worker's salad was just...a salad with minimal dressing, overflowing on a tiny coffee saucer they used as the plate. No biggie. It was rather fun watching him poke at tomatoes as they rolled off the small plate.\n\nHere comes the worst part aka the entree/steak. Absolutely flavorless. Ok, maybe we're supposed to season it ourselves because that's how some people like to do but still!

I am a neighbor and can see them from my front window.    but alas.Here is a list of my gripes:\n\n1) greasy spoon diner food.  for some this is a plus.  The potatoes were squares that felt reheated from last night.  The omelet was grainy and runny.Yes, they were free range eggs.  Oviously they were running on my plate.\n\n Did I mention that the plain omelet starts at 8.95  add $1 for  cheese, 1.25 for mushrooms and 1.50 for bacon.   add that up  and that is expensive for mediocre at best food.  no bueno.\n\nCheck this morning for 1 omelet, one short stack and 2 coffees? plus tip? $30.    I dont mind paying $30 bucks, but it has to be good.\n\n2) I know it is a family run business, but please keep your business  problems  private.  I heard the apparent owner, or  person running the shift  whining about  how some staff member was in no shape to work and that she has to be written up.  Really?  If I am I overpaying for the stunning view, at least let me be in peace. and not hear the petty dramas.  \n\n3)Yes, the view is stunning... but  in no way justifies the price.  In the future  I will just get a cup of coffee  and walk the bluffs.\n\nAs a neighbor, i waited a long time for the new renovated Louis'.  I didn't like it before but tried it again just to see the improvement.   Prices are higher and  the food is no better.  \n\nI just hope that the new warming hut that is going in next door will force them to reinspect their menu.\n\nUltimately, the biggest issue I have is the fact that there is so much potential for this place and they just dont reach any of it.  I would love the family to really own the cuisine of San Francisco.  They could really do great food, charge double and still fill the place everyday.", "author": "maia j."}

It's a place you dive by more than visit and murmur, we shold try Louis' again, it's been too long, but you never do.   My best friend was visiting from Chicago and my lover from Boise and we were out and about playing tourists and decided to grab lunch there on a recent, sunny, midweek October afternoon.  We were seated at the counter which was fine and I chose to have their 'Frenchburger' which almost universally means a half pound patty on some kind of a french roll.  Louis' didn't deviate from the norm and soon enough I had a white oval platter with a toasted open face french roll crowned by a decent size patty covered in melting cheese. a pile of crinkle cut fries and some so so lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle.  \n\nThe place has been there more than 70 years and isn't fancy or even swell, but it's not inexpensive either.  Like most San Franciscans, I don't expect much out what I call tourist trap restaurants and this is no exception for me, so no expectations translates into no great disappointments either.  From the counter where we were seated the only view is the slit peering into the kitchen or the derrieres of the many busy waitresses, not an all bad experience but not as sweet as seal rock and the wide open Pacific Ocean on a fine, sunny October day.  Most of the menu is classic diner food and gives the feel and appearance of coming from cans and frozen packages, or an uninspired kitchen, but it is fine grub for the throngs of hungry tourists who clamor for a seat in this long standing tourist trap.

All my friends had some type of cheeseburgers, and I had the roast beef/ham/cheese sandwich on sourdough w/fries, but I asked for a \"bunless\" sandwich, and they made it my way. Although the portion size of meal was sufficient, I'm not sure if the quality of food was authentic, and what I'm referring to is their French fries- very bland and they seem like the frozen variety.  I'm happy to say that waiters were pleasant, but not as attentive as I would have liked. On a positive note...there is a magnificent view of the Sutro baths, Sutro park, Cliff house, Ocean beach and LandsEnd trail; maybe that is what justifies the high prices of food given that this is a 'touristy' place to dine. But if you want quality food, pay more elsewhere! One more thing: this place only accepts cash, so be prepared!", "author": "Vanessa B."}

We also got to enjoy the staff arguing with each other loudly the entire time, very professional!  When my food arrived, there was a hair on my fries.  I got no apology, just an eye roll from the surly waitress and \"we'll get you new fries.\"  My second plate sat in the window for over ten minutes, while multiple staff members walked by it over and over again.

The portion of a tomato that was served tasted nice on my breakfast sandwich, but on the bill it appeared with the imperial price of $3.50.    I told my waitress it was \"$3.50 too much to come back\" but she offered no adjustment, nor much understanding.

She put the party of two at the four-top, skipped over us, and seated the party of two after us, at the two-top. I asked her why she didn't put the party of two ahead of us at the two-top, so we could be seated, and she had absolutely no response.\n\nOur waiter was chill, but responsive, but good-god the food is expensive. Really? $1.25 for EACH additional omelette ingredient (but seasonal spinach is $1.75).  The place has a great view, but give me a break.

They also give you a side of amazingly fresh sourdough bread, sliced up and butter on the side to dip into your soup.\n\nMy other favorite choice is this sandwich, think it's turkey and bacon but what seals the deal is that they serve it on a huge sourdough roll. I am a massive fan of sourdough bread and this bread is fantastic! It has a leathery-like crust, golden brown and then the inside is fluffly, soft, and warm. It's the best sourdough bread I can find next to Boudines and it actually tastes quite similar. The veggies on this bad boy are fresh and crisp and so is the meat and cheese. \n\nIn fact, any sandwich you can get here, get it on the sourdough bread, cuz I think that's what just makes it.\n\nMy only dislike is that the bathroom is a nightmare.

I should have known they couldn't possibly measure up to the fantastic fair available in Dallas, but wasn't prepared for the absolutely terrible burger served to me.  The bun was a grocery store version, you know, from an 8-pack, small, nothing special.  The menu says 1/3 pound, but what came out was a lot smaller, meaning the meat was probably 70/30 or 80/20 before cooking.  No taste.  Beef for burgers should be 85/15 for best taste.  The lettuce was a piece of iceberg from the bottom area of the head. At $10.50, the lettuce should be at least a large dark green piece of leaf lettuce, the bun should be specialty bread, and the meat should be full of flavor.  The crinkle-cut fries were obviously the bagged frozen kind and unremarkable.  The view is, obviously, the only thing to come here for.  The waitstaff mostly ignored us during the meal.

They didn't have that, but they did have a large shrimp louis salad, with sourdough bread on the side.  That and a Coke satisfied me that day.  The shrimp was tender, tasty, cooked just right.  The louis dressing was served on the side, but I poured the whole thing on my salad.  Margaret had a house salad, which she said was delicious, deep-fried shrimp, which I verified were delicious, french fries, and mineral water.   We enjoyed a leisurely meal, watching people explore the ruins of the Sutro Baths below, and watching fishermen on the rocks offshore.  The surf was high, and the waves hitting the rocks splashed above the fishermen's heads.  Lots of birds flew by; it looked like the water between the baths and Seal Rocks was a regular flyway.  There was a lot to watch, and no hurry to leave.  \n\nNothing much seems to have changed here since the place opened in 1937, except maybe the price.

Never had a fried scallop. Never had a scallop I didn't like either, and WHO has ever had a fried food that they didn't enjoy to the end? Who? Show me.\n\nLimp fries and golden discs of seafood were then set in front of me. These were BATTERED scallops. Not what I was expecting, for some reason - but a treat just the same. I don't know a soul who would be full off of this \"meal\" (besides my size 0 cousin who can drink coffee and be good to go until dinner), but it worked out as a nice appetizer for the largest salad that I could stuff into that bio-degradable paper box from Whole Foods that I ran to after and ate the shit out of.\n\nLouis is one of those places that you just have to go to. You know that you will have better food elsewhere, better surroundings - but you won't get that fresh-from-the sea old tymey historic feeling that you will from Ol Louis. \nJust go. Maybe eat before...\nBut when you do, bring all your cash. This plate don't take kindly to tha plastic. And they got Anchor Steam. Yeah, you'll need your cash to get your fill of that!", "author": "Katie W."}

I'd be ok with this if the food held up a little more.  I decided to skip the breakfast for dinner idea and went with an open faced roast beef sandwich with potatoes.  The dish would have been more successful if they had never called it a sandwich.  A sad slice of Wonderbread sat under the mountain of decent roast beef, but due to the expansive lake of au jus that coated the whole plate, the bread became soggy.  Au Jus soaked bread sounds good, but when it's on the verge of being limp while dry, the wet version just tastes like a bad sponge.  The mashed potatoes were also of the decent variety, but more thick than creamy.  My date's burger looked small and sad.  As he ate it (and he did like it), I counted at least fifteen places he could have gotten a better burger for the same price.

It wasn't crowded at all, but that may have been due to the weather as it wasn't a great beach day, unless you like the fog. \n\nI'd recommend this little diner because it has a retro, sort of isolated, and cozy feel and good, polite service, and it's not like every other diner.

It has a lovely view, best you can get, if you can get a window seat. I suggest groups larger than 2 as well because they are given priority for tables. If you are 1 or 2, the counter is your place, which has a lovely view of the wait staff. We were seated relatively quickly, after being bumped twice by families (my boyfriend and I) for a table with a view. We then sat down, got our well topped off coffees, and looked over the menu. General good diner fare there. I ordered the Louis' Benedict, and my sig. other got a cheeseburger as it was closer to noon. We received our food shortly after, about 15 or so, and as it would turn out, the eggs were hard boiled through, and the potatoes were deep fried squares from a bag. Nothing more, nothing less. My boyfriend still enjoyed his burger, but it left me feeling it was lackluster. As he put it, he liked it because it reminded him of what you would make at a beach cookout. Bun, meat, american cheese, lettuce, pickle and tomato on a plain sponge bun. The fries are crinkle cut like they were bought at Smart and Final. I like the premise of this place, but it needs to come back to the future. We have fresh ingredients readily available to us, and San Francisco, is a culinary centre. Let's pick it up Louis'...and get a chef who can at least poach eggs without them turning to hard boiled. The wait staff was very nice, and I think the hostess was new, so good luck to her in my dearest sincerity, she did great considering the chaos. Getting back to the point, they need to improve their food. I walked out $35 shorter than coming in, and that was for a sad cheeseburger, badly cooked eggs, and weak coffee for 2.50 a piece...better step it up Louis'. I understand that you're still going since 1931 or something, but you really only have your location to go off of.", "author": "Brianna S."}

Its laid back and comfortable with a killer view of the park and ocean. The staff has always been nice and it has a relaxing, no nonsense feel to the place.

It's kind of a minus that they don't take reservations, and the parking sucks, but you can pretty much see if the wait is going to be terrible when you drive past.  The wait for a two-top won't be too bad, but I would never try to take a group larger than four here.\n\n  The view makes up for any of that.  I mean, I have an ocean view from my couch here, but that hanging-over-the-edge vantage never fails to impress me.  In fact I usually can't remember the name of this place and call it Cliff's.  My fiance knows what the hell I'm talking about.\n\nThey make some serious burgers, but I usually come for breakfast and order items a la carte.

One is related to film techniques the other is related to how the Internet works differently than the real world.\n\nI'd like to introduce The Yelp Effect (3/2/2008), if it hasn't been chronicled before.  The Yelp Effect reflects a cycle the good word-of-mouth on the Yelp website has on a business.  Sending business to a store, restaurant or service. This exposure adds stress to the business and makes the undiscovered charm of the place battered by too many people trying to access it. \n\nIt happened to my old favorite Thai place. It was the bomb. Now after a huge amount of good reviews what they did so well has become hard to excuse.  For years they had the Zagat sticker in the window, just like they probably take Diner's Club credit cards for the 12 businessmen in town who still carry that card.  The food was yummy and we returned again and again. With the arrival of Yelp you could see the fuss gathering in the line-to-be-seated.  Now, alas we don't go there as much. The quality has gone down under the pressure of the quantity they must produce. The charm of the undiscovered becomes a tired mistress who needs a few nights off. Some places are built for the on coming crush of interest but the ones that are not ready seem to wilt.  \n\nThis is the Yelp Effect.\n\nSo, I mention this as a warning. Yes, Louis' Restaurant is a fabulous breakfast spot. The food is certainly above average, the servers are very kind and the prices are very reasonable. The location: rain or shine - clear or foggy, will be worth the journey. It doesn't seem like you could hurt this place by driving a little more business their way. Still, I do so with respect to the Yelp Effect.", "author": "BirminghamBill S."}

Ten-minute wait with NO host at the entrance and no sign. I actually had to ask after a few minutes waiting for nobody. I was walking in and about outside while ducking inside to see if they had called my name and when it was time, a girl just said: \"I have a booth for you in the back\" and simply pointed \"over there\". Sure enough, I went there and there was an empty booth for me. After another 10mins when no waitress showed up to ask me if I were dead or listlessly bored but patient, I got up and snagged a waitress. She waited on me right there and then!! I ordered a hamburger as I hadn't eaten all day after snapping pixs at a nearby russian church, and a bowl of the red clam chowder. The burger came with one half leaf of lettuce, one tomato and two pickles and was still lousy. The fries were a standard out of your frozen bag of dead potatoes. The hamburger was so tasteless that I thought of putting ketchup on it, and did use it for the thick but tasteless fries. I make better fries and burgers than this!!!  The clam chowder was okay with something, and pieces of potatoes and celery in it, but was much tastier than that burger & fries. Ordered a root beer float and it was standard also....   \n\nOne thing that bothered me was the sight of one of the very young waitresses pouring ketchup from an almost empty bottle into another. Haven't they any sense to do that behind a partition or in the kitchen? She was slapping the bottle butt trying to get the ketchup to move, which of course attracted a lot of stares. These people don't have a lot of common sense, but do have a lot of common tasteless food.\n\nI ain't returning and I ain't recommending this place.

Me being a party of five with an infant, walks into the diner and immediately could already tell what type of place this was. The manager himself (Tommy); instead of greeting his new customers chatting it up with a co-worker about some movie he had seen (Sin city) had asked us to \"hold on for a second\" until after he finished his conversation with said co-worker. After we were seated and ordered our meals, a movie was played on my cellular device for the infant so he would be relaxed, comfortable and quiet while waiting for his food the manager makes his way over to the table to ask us to turn the volume off of the phone because he was annoyed and it was noisy (mind you the volume of the IPhone wasn't all the way up) That was strike number two, and if I'm paying money for this place I would rather not stick around for strike three. After our drinks came I had my family all packed up to leave. Our waitress brought over to-go cups for our drinks that we had paid for before we left.

The entire plate is plain, simple, greasy, cheesy, and fried.  \n\nAlthough the prices seemed a little steep for diner breakfast (about $10 a person), I wasn't there for the food.

The menu specifically warns you that eating undercooked meat may cause illness, but I've never come across a diner serving anything but a well-done burger. \n\nOf course, I wanted it medium-rare.  And it actually WAS medium-rare.\n\nMoreover, the pink-inside, charbroiled-on-the-outside burger struck me on three fronts:\n\n(1) It was delightfully salted and tasted of meat PLUS seasonings, not just meat,\n (2) It was greasy enough to make the toasted bun just a little damp, but dry enough to drip only a little meat-ketchup-mayo-mustard juice on my fingers as I went in for each bite, and\n(3) It smelled like what a Whopper would smell like if it really was flame-broiled and made fresh.  \n\nAs for the fries, I hate to admit it--because the burger was so damn good--but they lacked pizzazz.

My grandmother used to take me out here on the 38 for root beer floats.  So they get a star for nostalgia's sake.\n\nI treated myself to a breakfast here about a year ago and was shocked at the prices.  I ordered a bacon and cheese omelet (there weren't a lot of choices) which put  me out $11.  $2 more for a cup of non-fancy joe.  \nWhen the omelet came, I discovered the cheese was plastic--Kraft singles or the Sysco version probably.  I'm not usually a food snob, but for $11, I expect real cheese, please.\n\nThe waitress was very nice and attentive, but apparently Louis' is preying on wealthy tourists.  \n\nNext time I'm going to the Seal Rock Inn for breakfast.  Sure, it's not fancy, but the view is almost as good and the food is both better and much more reasonably priced.", "author": "Jen D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-02", "description": "The food is overpriced but equivalent to what you'd find in most diners.\nThe view however is SPECTACULAR!\n'Nuff said.\n\nThat should be all you need to know about this place but since I see my fellow Yelpers unable to adequately describe this place I'll continue.\nUnless you're 'touched in the head' you probably will have figured out that this place is not like most other restaurants you find in the area. The fact that its clearly located inside of a park should tell you not to expect prices competitive with McDonalds for a $2.99 sausage and eggs combo. This restaurant operates as a park concession inside a National Park folks. That's why you're paying so much and complaining about the food being overpriced. But the food isn't bad and in some cases you're paying less that what you might pay at the restaurant located on the rim of the Grand Canyon or at the fancy hotel restaurant located inside of Yosemite Park. Those places operate as national park concessionaires too and thats why the prices there are higher than you'd expect. Its not rocket science, but alas so many fellow reviewers don't get it.\nIn other words, this is the kind of place you take out of towners or tourists go to because you want to show them an amazing view of the coastline only minutes away from Metro SF and hey, you can sit and have pancakes and a cup of coffee when the weather outside is chilly as it so often is in SF (even in summer!) And you know what, its worth the extra ten bucks! So get over yourselves. There are plenty of overpriced restaurants all over SF that don't have anywhere near as good a view. Some places you go to because the food is a good value or the chef is amazingly creative, or the place is closeby and convenient. This is none of those but its still something special that San Franciscans get to brag about.\nAnyone taking the time to read the menu could figure this all out because they practically shout out to you 'We are a operating as a National Park Concessionaire! Sorry the prices are so high!' They also have a fairly interesting history which you can read about on their website. The same family really has been operating out of this location for over 75 years even before the park existed. At one time they probably did serve better scratch made food back when they owned the building and could probably afford to offer food at more competitive prices. Today, lets just be glad you can still sit a few hundred feet from the crashing tide enjoying a bowl of chili or oatmeal or fish sandwich.\nBonus points for being open early enough to watch the sun rise over the crashing surf!", "author": "R S."}

Food is traditional diner fare, satisfying as only diner food can be, and the views are exceptional.  Even better, if you're lucky enough to get Hazel as a waitress, this American original will tempt you with other diners' food, tell you in no uncertain terms what you ought to order, and generally make you feel that you've stepped through a time warp to an earlier era.  There's often a wait, especially if you want one of the window tables with a view of the Baths, but it's well worth it.  And when you're done, wander down to the rocks and wonder why someone doesn't rebuild the darn thing!

Who ever wants to order an omelette with just ham (and eggs).  Is that really an omelette.  And then have a separate omelette dish with Ham and Cheese for $2 more.  And then have another separate dish called Eggs and ham.  This is the creativity we're talking about.  Then you get crazy and order the omelette with ham and cheese and the cheese ends up being 2 Kraft singles (or maybe it was some nacho cheese) slapped in the wedge of some eggs to form an \"omlette.\"  Side orders included a half pound hamburger patty or a heated danish.  I passed by a couple on the way to the restroom that ordered a waffle and I swear it was a Leggo my Eggo waffle that I used to pop in the microwave.  Also, the men's bathroom is the tiniest bathroom that opens up immediately into a one toilet stall door that you have to sneak around to get into the stall.

This place provided me with the worst dining experience I've had in the city.  My boyfriend, his brother (who is a butcher at wholefoods, and knows good seafood) and I all decided to check this restaurant off our to-eat lists.  My mother recommended the place, because she loved it back in the 70's.  The place looked like a funky mid-western mall dive of a restaurant, but we figured looks aren't everything.  unfortunately, we very soon realized we had made a bad choice by staying.  The service was slow and unfriendly, but WORST of all, the food was disgusting.  We ordered the prawns, fish and chips, double burger and shrimp cocktail.  We figured that because of the location next to the ocean, seafood was probably a safe bet.  WRONG.  The prawns were worse than fish sticks I had as a child, the fish and chips were soggy, and the double burger, tasted like is came from a fast food restaurant.  the french fries were the crinkle cut ones that come from a large freezer bag.  The prawns and fish were of the same frozen lineage, and the burger was so thin that it probably came pre-made....from costco.  The price for all dishes was around 16 dollars a piece.  Our total bill came to 80 bucks.  Really???  For frozen, disgusting food???  The waitress didn't ask how our meal was, which would have opened up the flood gates.  I'm sure she could guess based on the fact that we barely touched our plates.  I ate one prawn and then had to fill up on gross, frozen, though somewhat more edible french fries.  The view was nice, but the restaurant didn't make the view, they made the food.

Wanted crispy bacon, no such luck.  1/3 way thru meal, bit into something HARD.  Examined it, a piece of egg colored plastic.  Waitress offered new breakfast.  My appetite was gone.  She proceeded to still charge my friend her breakfast and me my O.J. and coffee! Owner would not come out of kitchen to apologize or make things right.  Old San Francisco my ass.  In old San Francisco (I know of what I speak, 60 yrs. here) the owner would have come out , said Breakfast (all of it) is on us, and we hope you'll be back.  And all would not only be forgotten, but they may have gotten a loyal customer.  Instead, I am still angry, and can't tell enough people of my shitty experience.  Being cheap is a bad business practice, and saves nothing in the end except a bad taste in one's psyche!!!!", "author": "Dolores S."}

Staffed by high school girls who apparently dont have to be pleasant or know anything about the food service industry.  Food is comparable to Denny's or Lyons.  Low end diner food.  But the view is amazing, so the food can be terrible and it doesnt matter.  ONLY GO FOR THE VIEW, NOT THE FOOD.", "author": "Melanie J."}

We eat here every time when we are in SF,for breakfast and lunch.  The sandwiches are filling and the fries very good.  The view alone is worth the meal ticket.  Views of the Sutro bath ruins and the ocean thru big expanse of windows.  Business is brisk, but worth the wait.  Bus stop right outside, will take you down to the beach and eventually the Zoo.  The burgers are good, and breakfast hearty, just right for a Midwest girl like me!  I am glad the decor has not changed in decades--why does it have to?!  It is part of the charm of the place.", "author": "Noran W."}

It's a well-known place that's been there for a long time, but I would only go to enjoy the view on a clear day. The menu is small, and the food is average and overpriced.", "author": "Tami H."}

The prices are a little high, but the view is magnificent.  For a great burger and shake and a wonderful SF memory, I would recommend Louis'.", "author": "M R."}
