They only open on weekdays as of right now, but hopefully they will eventually do weekends! I got here on a Monday afternoon and there were a good amount of customers. I'm not sure how much the other menu items were but the tacos were $2.50 each! \n\nI ordered the Steak, Carnitas, Chicharron, Lengua, Cabeza and Al-Pastor tacos. The lady asked if I wanted everything on it and I said yes. I enjoyed all of them, but the Steak and Carnitas stood out to me. The Steak had great flavor and the Carnitas was nice and crispy. The pickled jalape\u00f1os also went really well with the tacos. There isn't much seating but they have one table that seats about 5-6 people. \n\nThe ladies working were really nice and they spoke good English. I will definitely come back to try their grilled chicken tacos.", "author": "Michael L."}

It's a no frills taco truck that specializes in putting pork and beef on top of or within tortillas or any of its carb-cousins. \n\nGo for the tacos. At $2.50 a pop, they're actually GREAT bang for buck because of the amount of meat that's loaded on top. Between the al pastor (spicy pork) and asada (steak), I especially enjoyed the asada although I'd recommend both.\n\nThere's no condiments available outside the truck so when you order, be sure to specify that you want all the toppings as well as onions, cilantro, etc. \n\nMost people take orders to-go, but there's a small table with 5-6 chairs if you can't wait to devour your tacos. No issues with empty seats cause tacos are pretty quick to eat and it's not really a place to lounge and chill. \n\nThe ladies who work here are so friendly and nice!

Sometimes you realize perks of being a grown-up in the real world, and you become less fond of undergrad days.\n\nYou can thus imagine my satisfaction with El Gallo Giro's delicious tacos served from a simple truck with fast and friendly service and prices at such a bargain that I forget I'm in SF. I got a taco plate with pollo, carne asada, and carnitas with everything. Toppings include cilantro, chopped onions, and spicy sauce with a garnish of pickled vegetables and a radish piece. It was a good balance of topping to filling to fresh soft tortilla (plus da veggies for bowel health and food porn). My favorite was the pollo: simple and perfect. The carne asada was good but I felt that it was not on part with the quality of the cuts at La Taqueria, and I found the carnitas quite dry and overcooked--not bad, but non-preferred for a pork belly addict like myself.\n\nI still can't believe that it's $2 per taco, with tax included.

In my brown bag where my burrito was served, chips and salsa was included in the bag. Oh yeah, and napkins too. The chips were nice and crunchy.  The burrito to me was not a regular burrito. It was more like a super burrito for a great price. It was about a foot long in length. The burrito was packed with a lot of tender and juicy carne asada, sour cream, refried beans, cheese, and seasoned rice. The salsa included in the bag paired wit the burrito very well.

Very opinionated about tacos...  \n\nTo be honest, I haven't been blown away by any of the tacos I've had in San Francisco.  SF has the best burritos in the world, but the tacos just hadn't been living up to So Cal.  I've found most of them to be a bit on the bland side, kind of dry.    \n\nUntil.....\n\nThis place is so, so good.  Definitely lives up to any of the best taco trucks in so cal.  Super fairly priced (4 tacos + horchata was 10 bucks), wasn't a crazy line or anything.  There's a little table right outside. \n\nHere's the notes:\n\n- I got 4 tacos: asada, lengua, pastor, and carnitas; and horchata\n\n- They come with radishes, limes, and pickled jalapenos.  All of which I love.  I like to scoop the meat up with radishes at the end\n\n- Really meaty tacos.  They don't skimp on the meat.  Awesome.\n\n- Horchata was super good.  Not too cinnamony.  Perfect.  Can't imagine better.\n\n- Asada was incredibly good.  I've generally had a problem with asada being too dry, but this one was super tender, awesome.  Possibly the best asada taco I can remember having.\n\n- Pastor was incredibly good.  Definitely one of the best pastor tacos I've ever had.  Amazing.  Kind of spicy.  \n\n- Lengua also incredibly good.  I'm now realizing my review is getting kind of repetitive.  My biggest issue with some lengua is that it is a bit TOO sweet.  Not a problem here.  It was perfect and NOT too sweet, but it was still super tender like you want from lengua.  Really good.\n\n- Carnitas was the only taco that didn't quite live up for me :/  Carnitas is usually my favorite taco, but I would say it didn't actually match up to the other tacos for me.  While I like crunchy carnitas, I found this one to be a bit too hard to chew and perhaps slightly dry.  With that said, I think it might just been an off-day for the carnitas.

As many of us food truck chasers know, the food can be pricey and is not always what you expect it to be. On many occasions, I know I have been disappointed having wasting my money on tasteless mediocrity. Have no fear, El Gallo Giro Taco Truck will help bring you back, back to the times where you can fill your belly with quick, simple and delicious food with just several dollars in your wallet.\n\nEl Gallo Giro Taco Truck is located in an unassuming part of the Mission in front of a cute little playground. The menu is simple with Tacos ($1.50), Burritos ($5-$7.50), Tortas ($5) and Quesadillas ($6.75) with your choice of meat: Carne Asade (Steak), Al Pastor (Spicy Pork), Lengua (Beef Tongue), Pollo (Chicken), Cabeza (Beef Head) and Camarones (Shrimp).  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ot7QliMsea1Bnu59Mb5zGA?select=R4CkUquJfRz-ZCNsQiegCw \n\nYesterday, 6.8.11, I needed to grab a quick dinner before heading over to the San Francisco Food Bank to volunteer and thought it would be a perfect time to try the highly rated El Gallo Giro Taco Truck. I ordered Two Lengua Tacos ($3 total) with the cheery and friendly cashier. Before even placing my change into my wallet, I was handed a plate of tacos emanating with vibrant colors saying, \"EAT ME NOW!\"\n\nLENGUA TACOS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ot7QliMsea1Bnu59Mb5zGA?select=F52moaFyAV_VSmxLG_D3YQ\nThe double layers of corn tortillas were topped with a heaping portion of thick, succulent chunks of lengua and then sprinkled with onions, cilantro and then a spicy salsa rojo. Almost the whole circumference of the tortillas was covered with lengua perfectly braised to a soft, melt-in-your-mouth tenderness. It had a rich beefy flavor which was brightened with the fresh onions and cilantro. The salsa rojo added a spicy punch and tanginess. The tacos were super fresh, simple, and PACKED WITH FLAVOR! And for just $3, it definitely was a satisfying meal that didn't even scratch the bank.\n\nEl Gallo Giro is just TOO good to pass up or by. Seriously, for once the 5 Star reviews don't lie.

It was totally worth it.\n\nIt was a sunny but chilly Friday at my new job.  I haven't really met anyone since I started working here, and I'm technically still in training.  Great, another meal alone.....   Then, one of my coworkers popped his head in and asked if I wanted to join them for lunch.  Even though I had a ton of work to do, I decided, \"hey, why not?\"  Our group of about 5 people ended up turning into a group of about 12 or so, and knowing that it's lunch time in the FiDi, there's no way we would fit everyone.  One of the members in our group suggested we head over to the Mission for tacos.  Great!  I haven't had tacos in a while, so I was pretty ecstatic.. but would we make it back in time?  \n\nAnd my problems began....\n\nI forgot my Bart ticket back at the office, so while everyone was heading down to the station, I had to run to the machine to get myself a new ticket.  The machines I went to didn't accept credit cards.. who carries cash anymore?!  So I try to look for my debit card... again, it wasn't in my wallet because I had recently switched wallets.  I scramble to a different machine, BINGO!  They accept cards!!  So I bought my ticket and ran downstairs.. everyone was waiting for me... I'm sure everyone loves the new girl now!\n\nWe hopped on the Bart and journeyed to 24th and Mission.  I don't know how many blocks we walked, but it sure felt like an eternity... at times I wondered if we were even going the right way...  I was starving and worried that I wouldn't make it back in time too.  Finally, I saw the little sign that said \"El Gall Giro Taco Truck,\" yay!  But then I saw the sign, CASH ONLY!  FML!!!!!!!  Seriously, who carries cash!?  \n\nLuckily, one of my coworkers said she'd pay for me - I am forever thankful because I was starving and the tacos smelled DELICIOUS!  A lot of people got the burritos, but I've been craving tacos since I left San Diego, naturally I had to get a carnitas and carne asada taco.  WOAH!  There was such a huge burst of flavors, and the spices just married the whole dish together.  Make sure you get the green salsa too!  It will totally kick up your taste buds.  Amazing!! I loved the carnitas!  Next time, I will definitely have to try the burrito.  Best of all, they were super cheap too!

As a non-native, I felt comfortable finding the truck despite what I heard about the Mission district.  Then again, there is something about a New England-ner desperately searching for authentic Mexican food. \n\nThe truck hosts Michoac\u00e1n-style food, which UNESCO (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) has named as traditional Mexican food.  I had the burrito, which was truly beyond what the mass food corporations deem appropriate as \"burritos\".  The pricing was incredible, the portions were grand, and the spiciness was authentically spicy.  Did I mention it also came with chips and homemade salsa?  \n\nThere was limited seating, but it's a nice spot to watch the customers ranging from blue collar workers to a teenager, in questionable attire, who whipped out wads of folded tens and twenties.  The service was homey and courteous; I really felt like I was part of the usual lunch crowd, even with a clunky black tourist camera.", "author": "Christia P."}

I picked up my brother from the airport and the first place he wanted to stop at was El Gallo Giro.   We ordered the chicken soft taco and pulled pork soft taco - it took 7-10 minutes to get, but the taco was DELICIOUS.   We scarfed it down quickly standing next to the truck (although there is a small table there too).  There was so much tender meat, the sauce was great, and it was a steal.  There weren't all the bells and whistles like sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole, etc. that you find at the chain or fast food places, but it was better without because you didn't need it.  Unfortunately they were out of the shrimp, which my brother says is the best, but I'll definitely be going back to try it.", "author": "Vivian W."}

And $1.50 a taco - there's not a better deal in the city. \n\nMUST TRY - Carnitas: Mind-blowing crispy juicy pork with just the right balance of salsa, onions, and cilantro. They make the salsa themselves (special recipe) and it's really something special - spicy with just the right amount of heat. But the carnitas are simply magical. They also give some radish and pickled jalapenos (I usually enjoy them in my post-taco bliss).\n\nReally good - Al Pastor: Spicy small chunks of pork. Carnitas beats it out with the texture double whammy (crispy and juicy) but the al pastor is solid. More heat than carnitas and generous with the meat.\n\nNovelty pick - Lengua: I'll admit, I was pretty suspicious of eating beef tongue and expected something closer to liver in texture (the other weird organ meat) but it was surprisingly pleasant. Tasted pretty much like some other cut of beef (maybe because it's chopped in small portions). \n\nSkip - Carne Asada: I love this truck, but stick with the pork options (or lengua if you're adventurous). You can find better carne asada other places.\n\nThe horchata or the mango/pineapple juice is amazing.\n\nBe careful, once you have a carnitas taco here, you'll never want to eat one anywhere else (i'm looking at you, el tonayense).", "author": "dana n."}

It's still pretty good, but I still prefer Vallarta.

I thought I was gonna get a torta sandwich, but instead I got everything stuffed inside a hot dog bun. While the filling was tasty, it was just weird having it in a hot dog bun.\n\nOverall, I'd say go her for cheap lengua and carnitas tacos. When you any other sort of tacos, go to Vallarta.

Maybe this fantastic city/neighborhood provide the opportunity to go to four different taco trucks/stands within a few blocks. Or maybe because I wanted an adventure. Wouldn't be the first time.\n\nThe plan:\n\nChicken taco at each location. See what customizing can be done. Sample a bit of each. Rank 'em. Save the rest and mix everything together for a massive burrito for dinner. Give away some as a replate. Post same yelp for all four to give context.\n\nThe verdict:\n\n1. Tonayense. Average cost at $1.75. Way above average flavor. Black beans were a huge bonus, loved the mild green sauce and oil was minimal. This was easily my favorite.\n\n2. Mexicali. Second cheapest at $1.50. Tasty. Bonus points for having a bell you ring to get their attention, as well as giving me the opportunity to use a little spanish from 8th grade/Taco Bell to ask for lechuga (lettuce). The friendly lady obliged. More good stuff with the guy who wanted to pay with an ATM card. Didn't work. The lady working and me chipped in to cover his taco. I hope that karma pays off.\n\n3. Gallo Giro. Incredibly cheap at $1.25. Bit on the spicy side. Oil content seemed standard. \n\n4. Cachanilla. Most expensive at $2.00. Tasty. Made in the same building but different prep area than Mexicali. I give them credit for being up front saying if I order at the window (Mexicali) it's $1.50, and inside it's $2.00.

A quick Yelp perusal hooked me up with El Gallo Giro taco truck which was the shining star of a number of reviews on this my most trusted of review sites. Of course it's deep in the heart of the Mission as so far every good restaurant and bar worth it's mettle has lain in wait for me to cross it's threshold; in this case, sidle up to it's window.\n\nWith ease and a 3 day unlimited transit pass I hopped 2 buses cross town and found myself a mere 3 block walk from where El Gallo Giro was supposed to be residing. Best I can get from google translate is The Roosters Turn. I refuses to translate the 3 words together, slang? Weird syntax? No matter, I approached the truck and checked out what they had on offer. The usual fare plus lengue which is becoming more and more usual. I ordered an Al Pastor and a carnitas; usually my two favourites. I unfortunately wasn't hungry enough to order three and it was after I ordered I noticed the beef head option. I have never seen beef head taco before. I'm not sure what part of the massive bovine head this meat would be but I guarantee it would be tender and delicious. Damn. Now I need to find somewhere that is doing these. Back on track... My food arrives as I am talking to a cool fellow from Nicaragua about food. His food specifically. A lot of plantain apparently.\n\nI eat the al pastor first. It is middle of the road. Not enough pineapple sweetness for me and a little too saucy - just like my ex. Heh heh heh, I kidd. It passes muster in that it was a buck fifty, it just wasn't as good as La Taqueria back home. Then the main event. The best carnitas ever. They nail the crunch to soft factor and the seasoning and fresh veg are top notch. The tacos also come with a generous portion of homemade pickled jalapeno and radish which is unique to me in regards to tacos but damn tasty. I finish up and say goodbye to my lunch mate; the SFMOMA has a Cindy Sherman exhibition going on and I must must must see it, as well as the massive collection of contemporary art that the museum has on display.

So run, don't walk to 23rd and Treat, and go get you some.", "author": "gabriel a."}

The tacos are soft, fresh and delicious and the spicy pork is divine and at $1.50 a pop great value. I have got 3 for $4 when I was running low on cash and asked them how many I could get fot $4 and they said 3 :-) This truck is off the beaten path and right by a playground so it's not particularly well known. This is not a Toyonase truck and IMHO is far superior. My only complaint about this truck is they take Sundays off which is almost always when i'm in the mood for a brunch taco. Oh well, any other day of the week they are usually their until 6ish, check them out they are delicious.", "author": "Karl L."}

The woman who runs the truck is the sweetest person imaginable--she sees me, just says, \"Tres?\"  I nod and by the time I get to the front of the line my tacos are ready.

In the mission, that means something.  The carnitas always have those great crispy fried bits, the lengua is always completely not scary, with a meaty texture and great flavor, and the salsa verde is always spicy and delicious.  Sadly, they are not open late.  Tacos are a buck fifty, with a double stacked tortilla and a good amount of everything- I usually turn mine into 2 little ones per.  Two makes a completely acceptable lunch.  Get a real sugar Coke for a total of $5, and I guarantee you happiness.", "author": "Jamie B."}
