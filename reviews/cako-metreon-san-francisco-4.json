I used their app to order and it was super easy!\n\nYou can't choose the cupcake flavors but it didn't matter. All cupcakes were tasty and not overly sweet. You'll get 3 of each 4 flavors: Red Velvet, Chocolate, Vanilla, and Strawberry. \n\nThe photo toppers are printed on edible frosting paper. They look really neat and special. I'd suggest something simple for the design. However, even if the design is complex, the printed quality will still be good. The only thing to note is that overtime, the frost papers do curl up a bit. \n\nThey also reply to your email inquires very fast.

Cake was a bit dry, with a thin graham cracker bottom that I could barely taste. The topping was marshmallow whipped cream, except it wasn't really whipped cream. It was basically just marshmallow.

One of the things I like best about them is their originality. you can always find a new flavor to try. I especially enjoy it when they make my favorite things in cupcake form. When a flavor works, it REALLY works. A recent example is Birthday cake. Between all the sprinkles and the frosting, it had  happy thoughts of childhood flooding my brain. But when it doesn't work, it can be really disappointing. A recent example of that is the thin mint macaron. That is not only a specific flavor profile, it's a specific texture. A crispy texture that can't be repeated in a macaron. The cookie in question was actually lovely when taken on it's own merits, but disappointing when you expect a certain flavor profile. It seems picky I know, but I can assure you this would be a fail on Top Chef simply because of the name. I have had other macarons from them and really enjoyed them. Another thing I really appreciate at Cako is the frosting to cupcake ratio. It's just right. Some places overload you with a mouthful of butter. I like butter, but not in such large sugary doses that you see at other places..Cako has the perfect balance  Service wise, the people working always seem a bit bored, but no one has ever been rude. That said, I always enjoy a visit. It's a guilty pleasure when I happen to be at the Metreon.", "author": "Nicole M."}

I had a work event coming up and was looking for cupcakes with our company logo on it. I chose Cako but was a little nervous because I know Cako cupcakes can tend to be dry/old depending on the day (they used to resell old cupcakes). Luckily for delivery I think they use fresh cupcakes so all the cupcakes were soft! Still not the best or most moist cupcake I've ever had, but it delivered and the logo (printed onto fondant?) was a really nice touch. I was excited to order the strawberry cheesecake because I remembered it being very tasty, but they changed the cupcake since I last had it a couple years back. There used to be a middle filling of cheese which added the \"cheesecake\" element. The pink cupcake we got looked saturated with hot pink food dye and was overly sweet. Cream cheese frosting was tasty. Overall I would definitely order again if I needed customized cupcakes, but I would avoid the strawberry cheesecake and just stick with the red velvet. I remember tiramisu was my favorite, maybe I'll try it again next time :)", "author": "Hannah K."}

There is a Cako Creamery adjacent, but my eyes were focuses on the plump cupcakes sitting in the display case. There was also a rainbow of macarons. \n\n[The Service] \nThere was one staff worker on site. Doesn't look like the place gets busy too often, which was a reason I was hesitant to try it at first. I wasn't sure how fresh or moist the cupcakes would be. The staff member was kind, no problems. \n\n[The Cupcake] \n\n-Tiramisu cupcake @ 3.78 per cupcake (including tax): It was YUMMMMYY! The frosting wasn't overly sweet at all (which I loved- since I normally hate the traditional sugary frosting), the frosting was fluffy and had a dust of cocoa powder on it. The cake was super moist and was half vanilla cake and half rum coffee flavored cake...mmmmmmmmm...my mouth is watering just thinking about it.

A talent of ours was nice enough to bring by a huge box of cupcakes.\n\nI've only had mini cupcakes from Cako. This was the first time I've tried one of their regular sized cupcakes. My love of pink made me choose the Strawberry Cheesecake Cupcake: tangy smooth cheesecake drizzled with ripe, sweet strawberries and syrup, made of moist strawberry cake, creamy cheesecake center baked into the cake and topped with a dollop of cream cheese frosting. I adore their mini cupcakes, but the full size one just didn't seem as good. The cake was too moist, so not light and springy. Not quite mushy, but close. The frosting was light and creamy, like I remember.\n\nI like Cako's cupcakes, but I prefer their mini ones. The cake and frosting ratio per bite seems to be better.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2014-03-10", "description": "I'd like to preface this review by saying the cupcakes at Cako are actually pretty tasty, and it's been one of my go-to cupcake spots in SF for the past two years. However, after my most recent experience, I'm definitely in the market for a new cupcake spot.\n\nTLDR: I placed a simple, standard order of 6 Red Devil Ice Cream Cupcakes with Cako, and they messed up the ice cream filling inside as well as the frosting on top.\n\nThis past weekend was my sister's birthday celebration, and we all like ice cream cake, so Cako was an obvious choice, since they make ice cream cupcakes (Individual portions of ice cream cake? Yes, please!). Since it was already Thursday night, and I needed the cupcakes for a Saturday night dinner, I called the Cako store at the Metreon to confirm whether the cupcakes would be ready in time if I placed the order that night/Friday morning. The girl I spoke to was really awesome (I think her name was Melanie?) and informed me that they would be ready in time, so I placed my order on Friday morning. She even gave me a 10% off code to use online!\n\nMy order details:\n\nShipping Method: Store Pick Up - Metreon\nDelivery Information: 2014-03-08     4:00pm-6:00pm \nItem: Red Devil Ice Cream Cupcake \nSKU: 623300\nQuantity: 6\nSubtotal: $30.00\n\nSeemed straightforward enough, right? I ended up not going with custom cupcakes, and I just chose one of their standard options, Red Devil Ice Cream Cupcakes, which has a red velvet base cupcake, red velvet ice cream, and cream cheese frosting (http://www.cako.com/red-velvet-red-velvet-cream-cheese-ice-cream-cupcake.html).\n\nSaturday evening, I went to Cako to pick up my ice cream cupcakes. The Creamery side didn't have my order, but the Cupcake side did. However, when one of the Cako employees handed me my ice cream cupcakes, I noticed that the frosting on top was chocolate, not cream cheese, so I asked if those were the correct cupcakes. She said yes and that they were the red velvet cupcakes, and she even checked the freezer to see if there were any other cupcake orders there (there weren't). I asked why there was chocolate frosting and not cream cheese frosting, and she looked confused, but said she would scrape off the chocolate frosting and re-frost the cupcakes for me. 5 minutes later, I had ice cream cupcakes with the correct (cream cheese) frosting, and I left a little disgruntled over the hassle they caused. They did offer me a free regular cupcake for my trouble, but that definitely didn't make up for being late to my sister's birthday dinner.\n\nBut wait, it gets better (read: worse). When we cut into the cupcakes after dinner, the ice cream inside was chocolate, aka NOT red velvet ice cream. (See the photo I uploaded.) Seriously? I specifically ordered one of the standard options so that the order would be fairly simple and there wouldn't be much confusion over the flavours.\n\nJust to recap, there are three components to an ice cream cupcake: (1) cupcake base, (2) ice cream filling, (3) frosting. Cako got two of the three wrong on one of their standard ice cream cupcake options. For $5 a cupcake you would think they could get it right.\n\nWill not be coming back.", "author": "Krystal M."}

I absolutely loved the frosting on it; not too sweet and not crazy thick. The tiramisu was just alright for me; didn't really think it was anything special, besides it made me horribly thirsty.\n\nThe girl working there wasn't really helpful either.

That last problem is *everywhere*, and it drives me nuts. Why must so many cupcake places put 3 inches frosting on the cake? So much frosting that you have to eat it separately from the cupcake, because it doesn't fit in your mouth or just falls off the cake, which defeats the purpose of having a cupcake? Enough already with the frosting madness, America!\n\nHere is why Cako's cupcakes were a success in my book:\n\n1) Reasonable cake-to-frosting ratio\n2) Frosting was fairly light, fluffy...

I got the notice from my boss on Thursday to be delivered on Monday.  So I called to place the order and was shocked that they were able to accommodate me. The Bay Areas public transportation suffered a strike and it disrupted my way to get to San Francisco, so I was in panic mode because I made the order just the week before and wouldn't be able to make to work.\n\nThis also caused a problem with the retiring employee for which the cake was made for because he was affected by the strike as well.  I immediately sent an email to CAKO and without missing a beat they told me that the could hold off the delivery until Wednesday.  In the back of my mind I was saying how will the cake stay fresh as it will sit for several days before it gets delivered.  So on Wednesday the cakes were delivered and when I took a peek at the custom cake, it was perfect!  \n\nEverything I requested was on the cake and it was beautiful.  I was nervous about how it would taste when the time came to cut it.  I have to say that I got a A+ from my director and all others that attended the office retirement party.  The white cake was moist and delicious.  It was easy to cut and the butter cream was not as sweet as other cakes I have tasted.  I mentioned that I ordered another cake from them that was an 8 inch cake with fruit on top.  That cake went immediately and the employees loved it!

It was late in the day so there wasn't a lot of inventory left.  I'd been hoping to try the Maple Bacon but, since they were sold out, I opted for the Cookies and Cream.\n\nMethinks the folks at Cako are using Duncan Hines mixes.  The cake had that sticky, fake-chocolatey, \"I came from a box\"  flavor I detest.  The fact that the cupcakes are refrigerated doesn't help matters: it made the cake crumbly and the \"buttercream\" (in quotes because I don't think it was actually buttercream) kind of crack when I bit into it.  As for the cookies and cream flavor?  There's a stale mini Oreo perched on top.  That's your cookies and cream.\n\n$3.25 was a lot to spend on this cupcake.  The only positive thing about Cako was the customer service.  The girl behind the counter was very sweet.", "author": "Joanna L."}

I ordered the red velvet macaron with mango vanilla ice cream. I seriously didn't want it to end. The ice cream wasnt too sweet and the macaron was just right, not too crunchy and not too soft. Perfection!! The rose macaron was delicious as well. I was a little hesitant because it smelled strongly like roses. But these roses did not smell like boo oo oo. It was light and slightly creamy. If you are turned off by the \"perfumey taste\" this may or may be for you. But if you're feeling adventurous please try!! But if you don't get the Macaron Sammie.... I'll be speechless while shaking my head in disapproval. Don't disappoint yourself now!", "author": "Christina H."}

The Strawberry was not bad, except that it was room temperature.  I don't know about you, but I prefer cheesecake and cream cheese icing cold - instead warm and mushy.  The Snickerdoodle was quite good and moist, a bit more cinnamon flavor could have helped.  \n\nThe service was great.

Its in the metreon which is close to my work. they have two little nooks one side for ice cream the other side for cupcakes. \n\nSERVICE: AWESOME. FRIENDLY. I would like to thank that Chris guy for always asking how my day is every time. \n\nPRICE: Its a bit pricey for ice cream. But I guess its also cuz of the brand itself. \n\nFOOD: my favorite cupcake now is the TIRAMISU cupcake. It tastes just like the cake itself. Also, I love the bailey's ice cream. You can actually taste the baileys in it but then the chocolate follows it right after making it a sweeter treat.\n\nOVERALL: good service. good food. Definitely will tell friends.", "author": "Isabel N."}

The  cashier said all she could do with the deal I bought was giving me $10 for $12!!!! WTF!!!! I wouldn't bother buying the deal if it's for $2 discount! What a fucking joke! I guess they have so many deals online that their staffs couldn't keep up of the deals and gave you another deal (probably $5 for $12 or something) instead of $10 for $20 that I bought! I redeemed it anyway. Pissed me off though. They should have at least know all of the deals they have online and let the customer use the actual deal that they bought not something else! Stupid! I don't think I would go to this cako again or at least not when this clueless girl who work on Saturday's night working!", "author": "Joey P."}

Bf and I were hungry and I want to try as many cupcake shops as possible so we stopped by. We were really really tempted to try the maple bacon cupcake, but we're not impulsive enough. I got the Snickers cupcake because the Bf was not supportive of my pumpkin cheesecake cupcake first pick. He got the pink lemonade cupcake. It was amazing!!! So good. He didn't taste the pink lemonade but he also ate it in three bites. I thought it was very well balanced, light and moist. My Snickers cupcake was alright. Super duper dense chocolate flavor. The cupcake wasn't very light or balanced, it tasted like diabetes. None of this means I didn't enjoy it, it was just too rich to eat all at once. \n\nCashier was friendly enough. She looked exhausted, poor girl.", "author": "Heather M."}

I had always wanted to try their cupcakes so since I was in the area here was my opportunity. There weren't many options left (because it was already later in the day) so what I did choose was the Strawberry Cheesecake Cupcake. It was really pretty but it was a little dry. Even though my first experience here wasn't quite what I hoped, I will still come back because I am interested to try their Maple Bacon cupcake! :)", "author": "Mel P."}

I placed an ordered on cako.com a day before valentine requesting and paying $15 delivery for be made at 12:30-1PM. The order did not arrive until 2:40PM being nearly 2 hours late. I called the line nearly four times and only had voice mails where no one can help me. After managing to reach the mall-store in SF, over 3 employees took down my info and never called me back. By the fourth time, I managed to reach an employee by the name of Claire who actually understood my frustrations and tried to reach her boss. The order came 20 minutes later.

It was sorta quiet over there which i guess was way easier since i didnt have to wait in a line to purchase or sample their ice cream(red velvet and vanilla madagascar a must try!!!!!!!!!!!!) Long story short i bought the pb&j with the tirimisu which lead to getting a stamp on my frequent buyers card and a free cupcake! it was one of the easiest trips to getting my cupcake for the day. \n\ncant wait until the target over there opens either!!!!!!!!!!! gives me another reason just to swing by metreon(;", "author": "Sandra T."}
