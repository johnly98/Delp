Wanted to get a simple bowl of wonton noodles in Chinatown with my parents and was recommended to come try this place out. And to my surprised, it was better than I expected. \n\nI ordered the regular Shrimp Wonton Noodles Soup while my parents got the Beef Stew Wonton Noodles Soup. The size of the shrimp wontons were just your average wonton size and average on meatiness, but the noodles were very bouncy and had a nice texture to the taste. My parent's Beef Stew were something they could not stop raving about. The beef were tender and soft, not chewy at all and very flavorful. Also for the price of each bowl (Shrimp Wonton $5.95; Beef Stew $6.25), you really can't ask for more... \n\nOverall experience was great. Food was good and cheap, restaurant was small but clean.

The classic slightly crunchy wonton mein with the classic pork and shrimp wontons.... tasty and doubles the portion of Hung's.\n\nI thought that the beef stew noodles were a bit too salty (they added some beef stew juice into the soup )... that made it more flavorful but also a bit too salty for me.

As noted in many other reviews, the service is a bit troublesome here, but the food is not bad. I decided to try their beef stew & wonton noodle soup. They allow for a variety of different noodles and I opted for the egg noodles. My party also ordered their rice rolls to share. The rice rolls were pretty bland with the peanut sauce. There isn't much flavor to them and I would probably opt for something else. The beef stew & wonton noodle soup was pretty good especially for the cheap price.

I tried one other occasion but they close on Tuesdays.  \n\nThough being relatively late in the lunch shift 1:30 pm, all tables were occupied so I shared a table with a couple.  After thumbing through their menu, I ordered an appetizer and a light meal.\n\nNot wanting a heavy starter I started with curry fish balls (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=gRRgBjyhu_TEJDFUNe-V1g&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  Not knowing whether they were premade or fresh, the balls were tasty with no brininess and the curry sauce was just right flavor and spice wise.  My main meal was the beef stew wonton noodles soup (https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=3Xz2Lv84mc1BnF-_szTyag&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q).  The wonton was okay with a mix of mostly ground pork and some shrimp as were the noodles which were Hong Kong style egg noodles, thin and chewy.  The protein was a mix of beef stew and tendons that were braised in a tasty five spice sauce.  Wished there were more meaty pieces than tendons but above average rendition.\n\nThe owners are multiple restaurant owners based from Toishan, best known for their Yin Du Wonton Noodle on Pacific Avenue.  \n\nThe Chinese name reads as 'beef noodle king', a change from the original which translates to \"true happy porridge\".  This restaurant no longer serves their famed congee nor do they offer their signature clay pot rice offerings.\n\nThis should be listed as a new restaurant, but, as many Chinese restaurants do in saving business registration and beer/wine licenses, they keep the English name intact.  Not a destination eating place, but not bad for neighborhood local fare.", "author": "Mike C."}

Same issue, only a few pieces of beef. Even worse, ALL OF IT WAS FAT. Not a single actually piece of meat. It's like they trimmed the fat pieces off the meat and dropped them on his plate. VERY DISAPPOINTING AND INEDIBLE. I understand quality dipping a little due to higher demand or more popularity, but this is horrible. If you see in the picture, it's all fat and tendon.

My friend grew up in SF recommended this place to me having the best clay pot rice in town, so decided to give it a try.\n\n#Soup (free): A.\nYes I have to talk about this soup. It was really good and served for free! I think they put red carrot, green carrot, pork bone and some other ingredients in it. Clearly the soup has been boiled for a very long time otherwise it wouldn't have a rich taste to it. My friend and I had 3 small bowls each of this soup. Wish we could have more!\n\n#Preserved Meat Clay Pot Rice \u81d8\u5473\u7172\u4ed4\u98ef: A-.\nPretty good. Not to a point that I would say it's exceptional but the preserved meats were very tasty (sometimes with low quality preserved meat they could taste bland) and they put a lot of meat inside. One of the key point of clay pot rice is the overcooked rice at the very bottom of the pot (\u98ef\u7126) - those are usually brownish-black color literally taste like burned rice but with the absorption of soy sauce from the top, it's one of the most unique and good flavor one can ask for. And yes, this clay pot has got it right! Although it would be even better if it's overcooked even more.\n\n#Garlic Pea Sprout: A.\nThe vege was fresh, garlic amount and cooking time was just about right.

I saw on Yelp how mixed the reviewers were, but we decided to give it a shot. We had the Chinese sausage and dried duck claypot and the \"wet\" beef chow fun (or, what I think is more commonly called \"beef chow fun with gravy\") that some Yelpers recommended.  \n\nThe lady serving us was very nice, helping me along with my broken Cantonese. And we were surprised to get a very tasty wintermelon soup to start off our meal. I had requested a red bean ice (on the Chinese menu), but they were out. She told us, though, that the meals came with sweet green bean soup for dessert -- much better than fortune cookies, IMO.  I mention this because overall ambiance can have an impact on taste and these things put us in a pretty good mood for our meal. \n\nWe thoroughly enjoyed both dishes. The claypot came with a good serving of bok choi on top, much to our delight.  The sauce was on the side, which kept things more fresh tasting.  The meats included two types of Chinese sausage/laap cheung (liver and regular), as well as the most buttery-tasting dried pork I have had, plus the salted dried duck. The best part of the claypot, though is scraping the crispy rice (faan jiu) off the inside of pot - so good. The beef chow fun with gravy was also very tasty. I usually prefer the dried style (one of the hardest dishes for a Chinese cook to get just right), but I would definitely have the gravy version again here (which also came with bok choi).\n\nAlso, when we first got there it was not very busy and most of the customers were non-Chinese tourists (something that makes me cautious), but by the time we left it was almost full and most of the customers were Chinese (Cantonese).\n\nAnyway, despite some mixed yelp reviews, I think Utopia is definitely worth a try, especially for it clay pots and the nice, family atmosphere!", "author": "Alan L."}

So though I didn't try anything else I feel confident in recommending the clay pots here as their specialty. \n\nAnd it's pretty much how it sounds, a clay pot, medium sized, filled with a whole lotta rice and then topped with a patty of meat and some halves of bok choy like vegetable. It will be be like 66-75% rice. At first I was like, what a rip off! Just rice! But no fear, the rice is fabulous. It's not the usual steamed rice you get with Asian food. Someone more informed than I can tell you what kind of rice it was. All I can say is that it was more translucent and glossier than normal rice and it's cooked perfectly in the clay pot with just a little bit of stickiness to help you eat it but still al dente with the individual grains. They give you a small bowl of sauce you pour over the rice - something salty, savory, a little bit soy sauce but a little more of something else (probably not vegetarian is my guess).\n\nOne clay pot is enough to feed two people for lunch (or in my case one very pregnant hungry friend).\n\nIt takes about 20 minutes (so they say) to cook the clay pots but ours took only 15 min probably? It was 2 pm on a Monday and it wasn't very busy though there were a few other full tables. They bring out a very plain soup to start with - barley, lotus roots, carrots, pork in a home brewed bone broth. Nothing fancy but kinda like what you expect your aunties to make for you at home.\n\nFor some reason we were charged an additional 2 x $1.60 for something on the bill. The soup? The tea? I have no idea. Lunch was so cheap and plentiful I didn't complain but if you count your pennies you might want to ask before accepting any extras.\n\nAmbiance: cafeteria style but not dirty/divey.", "author": "Jean K."}

LOL the guy mentioned 'this might be popular in china, but not here in america'... as a chinese american ... dude thats offensive.. this is authentic chinese food... you're in the HEART of chinatown, san francisco, none the less... *face palm*.. AND you're a yelp elitist... just saying, nothing personal... I guess you wouldn't know any better, because you're amercian ... and these CHINESE american dishes aren't Mcdonald's enough for you.

I guess everyone's individual preference is different, so you're entitled to your yelp review. \n\nAnyway, I'm going to give this place five stars because its really hard to find authentic chinese food in chinatown unless you really know where to go. Everything is sort of touristy. I came here with a group of 15 and we did a family style lunch, we had about 12 dishes. It was great because they brought us downstairs to this disco-ish room... so if you have a large party and dont mind being left a lone for a little while.. go here... haha its fun.

However, in reality, the experience should be consistent from open to close, so I can't base my review on what might have been.\n\nPRO: One of the few open places open late in Chinatown (a lot of places close around 6 or 7 PM, and Chinatown itself is a ghost town at 9 PM).\n\nSUMMARY: When we walked in we were warmly greeted, seated, provided menus, and then within a few moments after getting settled were asked if we would like anything to drink. Check. Looks like we are on our way to a solid experience. The menu is vast so you should be able to find something.\n\nWe ordered the egg roll (vegetarian) as an appetizer and I ordered the Hong Kong beef chow fun, while my girlfriend ordered something else (I can't recall). The egg rolls came out promptly, but were super hot. Like, you might as well be drinking the frying oil hot (though they were not at all dripping with oil). Hot is good - heck of a lot better than cold. But scalding hot - I'd like a warning please. And it's no fun being hungry and being forced to watch your food cool on the plate for 10 min before you can eat it. I'd rather it just be kept in the back until it is close to edible - maybe that's just me.\n\nThe main dishes came out while we had barely begun the egg rolls, which, isn't terrible since they were just egg rolls and this is a hole-in-the-wall type place, so I can't dock them for that. But, the meals were equally hot. Had to let those cool for a tad also. My meal was pretty lacking in beef and the entire thing was under seasoned and bland. It was like I got the leftovers from the day, which very well may have been the case.\n\nWhile we were sitting down eating, the entire staff came out and had a \"family meal\" next to us. From then on, we received very poor attention. Now, I would not expect this to happen midday, but still, it was annoying in the least.\n\nGood luck!", "author": "Brett S."}

Keep in mind, it will take approximately 25 minutes or more to cook. In the mean time, I ordered wonton noodles to share with dad. Noodles were al dente, broth was okay and wonton was better than expected. I wouldn't say it's equivalent to Hong Kee on Kearny street but it did the trick. I would order the wonton again.\n\nBack to the rice, it came piping hot with a rice bowl of soy sauce on the side. Dad added the sauce to the rice and waited about 5 minutes before serving. Yes, it was delish!! All the flavor came together perfectly. I would return just for that all by myself. \n\nThe wonderful thing about Utpoia is that they offer 2hrs free parking at Portmouth Square parking lot.

Even though they have the standard Cantonese dishes on the menu, I came here for the famous claypots. I took a look at the faded 2003 San Francisco Magazine cover (see my photo) they have framed in the window, which spotlights the $6.95 Cuttlefish and Minced Pork Claypot as #34 among the top 125 best things to eat in the city. OK, that's for me.\n\nFirst up was a cup of warm, nondescript soup (see my photo with the appealing reflection of the fluorescent lights). Then came the huge claypot topped with lots of tender Chinese broccoli (see my photo). Underneath was a big patty of pork and cuttlefish chopped up into a burger-like consistency, all of it resting on a whole lotta rice. Naturally the best part of the rice is the crusty part on the sides of the bowl. I have to admit I liked it a lot, though I kinda wished it was a fried rice to break up the carbs a bit. There was enough for two people, but I was having a bad day, OK?

I love clay pot, but this wasn't it. There wasn't much flavor to it and it wasn't done right. My friend had a large bowl of soup and stated that it was too bland and felt like the things inside were added to the soup after they were already cooked..not cooked inside the broth. Weird. \n\nAlso, I stood up to pay while my friend sat and paid in cash. As I was paying the woman kept saying to me \"you have to tip\" and I told her that we would. My friend was planning to leave the tip. I went back and sat at the table to finish my tea and the woman came and took all of our plates of our table and banged the table and said \"YOU MUST TIP!!\" and just kept repeating \"tip tip tip\" while hitting the table. We were both shocked--as we hadn;t gotten up or left the restaurant yet, and we were fully planning on tipping her--cash left upon the table as we exit--as per usual.

However, I like to judge a Chinese restaurant by its wonton noodle soup, and I kind of wish I didn't.\n\nSara P. and I headed here in search of good Chinese food.  It was recommended by a few of my coworkers, who said the clay pot was really good.  Not that I didn't have this in mind, but I was just in the mood for wontons, and if it'd been good, it would've totally made my day because after our office move, Hon's is now like two blocks down a steep hill for me, and walking up that hill on a full stomach is really no bueno.  Utopia, on the other hand, is on a flat walk of Waverly directly across from my office.  It had potential.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive, with different types of veggies, clay pots, noodles, noodle soups, meat, porridge (jook/congee) and rice dishes.  Prices start at $2.50 for a plain bowl of porridge, and goes up around $8 for most other things.  I had my eye on the minced meat clay pot, but the wontons took over my brain, so I ordered the shrimp wonton noodle soup for $4.95.\n\nIt was okay.  At most, it was a 3-star meal.  There were 5 wontons that were too hard and too densely packed into the wrapper for me, and there was a sort of funky taste to it, like they didn't add some sort of seasoning or whatnot (maybe the pork they used was bad?  I hope not, since I didn't get sick yet).  The noodles were on par with Hon's, and it's the dry-ish curly thin noodles that remind me of over-permed, over-stressed hair.  The broth, with a few shakes of salt, was good.\n\nI think I'll leave my experience at 3 stars for now, since the service was mediocre (again, it's a Chinese restaurant so it's not like I was expecting my chair to be pulled out for me) and prices and quality were just okay compared to some of the other restaurants around the area (Hon's, New HK Menu).\n\nOh, and if you go between 2:30 and 5 (I think) they have \"afternoon tea time\" specials, but they were all in Chinese so I couldn't understand what they were serving.  Boo.\n\nI'm totally down to come back here and try out all the other dishes and their tapioca teas (it looks like a place that would be good).  Oh, and the other thing that kind of is awesome: they accept credit cards.

I get water refills and extra napkins and a box for leftovers.  They're patient when I ask questions about the menu (full disclosure: I'm not Chinese.  Surprising, I know).

It's one of many in the area with ladies coming out to attract people into the business. It's a fairly small place, but we were seated quickly at a nice circular table perfect for our group. We didn't have to wait at all for our waiter to take our order, and although there was some confusion, everything got placed without problem, and with separate checks to boot! Our food arrived pretty quickly, and everything was delicious. We got the Curry chicken clay pot, orange peel chicken, general chicken, lobster with noodles, and dumplings. The only negatives of our experience were: My friend got the drink he ordered WAY late. . . like near the end of the meal. But more frustrating was the fact that we were only told when our checks came that we couldn't use card for bills under $20. . . should have had cash, but also would have liked to know this ahead of time.", "author": "Charizard B."}

When i look up at the tenement windows, or spy lights, my imagination wonders what sort of sad, sordid, wonderful, real-life history has occurred within those walls. It's a little otherworldy, like walking hallowed halls.. \n\nOK... CLAY POTS are what it's about here.... we got a lamb stew clay pot that was fall-off-bone tender, but whose flavor could have been a bit more intense, if I may ever be so candid. \n\nThe winner, hands down, were the portions of the food!!!!!!!!!!! Really large plates that were generously laden with wok power. The breaded salt/pepper shrimp was a delightful dish, as was a very special order: finely shredded roasted nori (again, plentiful) alighting roasted pine nuts, seafood fried rice.. mix it all together, and one cannot stop at just one bowl. \n\nI recall there being a flounder dish and fresh fresh gailan leafy greens. the Jingdou spareribs were quite nice, albeit tad on the fattier side.

We had some of each and nothing was overly greasy or overwhelming to the palate.  The soup was tasty and the vegetables fresh.

Oh, well.... next time.  That alone was worth $6 in free parking.\n\nThe customer base today (weekend) was a mix of Asians & Whites and a token Black man who probably likes Chinese food!  \n\nThey offer 15 rice clay pots, mostly $8 and 3 which are $10 and the one frog leg clay pot for $11.  We tried the chicken/mushroom and sparerib blk bean sauce.  Tea and the house barley/carrot soup came w/the meal. The soup was quite tasty.\n\nThey cook their rice in the pot first (our 2 seat table was in the rear with a clear view of the stove in the kitchen) and then add the meat topping later.  A couple of stalks of bok choy was finally added on top of all this.  I thought the food was good, rice a bit bland but if you add a few tablespoons from the bowl of seasoned soy sauce which came w/the meal, it tastes pretty good.  \n\nHubby prefers the meat and seasoning mixed and cooked into the rice vs. topping and feels the rice clay pots are better at Taishan Restaurant on Clement St. for the same price.

The flavor of the spare rib and sauce is totally fine but it's not done what I would call properly.  I'm not a fan of the crispiness but I do think it should be there for authenticity's sake.  I also miss the fact that they don't make soup with your pot remnants for you.\n\nOn the plus side, they serve hot lemon coke (yit ling lok) which is difficult to find as well as nai cha.

The Chinese name to this place is quite unique - ginseng satisfy porridge - but basically it's food that'll you'll be satisfy with.\n\nNow, they are also famous for their clay pot rice and is there any Chinese who doesn't LOVE this dish?  It's not a fancy dish but it's not easy to make it right.  Wherever they served them, we have tried and this place is the BEST yet.  You must know a little about this dish to understand or try to catch the episode when Anthony Bourdain was in Hong Kong.  It's rice with whatever toppings slow cooked in a clay pot -the result is a layer of crispy goodness and flavorful rice from whatever topping you choose (black bean sparerib, chicken with mushroom and chinese sausage, combo of preserved meat and chinese sausage, salty fish pork patty, beef patty...the possibilities can be endless and establishments are getting very creative.).\n\nWe ordered the finely minced preserved cabbage and beef clay pot rice - it was made perfectly.  The beef was flavorful and every grain of the rice was perfect.  The crunchy goodness was just divine and of course, the sweetened soy sauce makes the meal complete.  The plus was the rice also included some tender greens.  $6.95!\n\nWe decided to try the pork giblet porridge ($4.50) and the bok choy chicken pan fried noodles ($6.25).  The porridge was ok - the thickness was just right, the ingredients were a bit overcooked and it was lacking a bit of taste.  The pan fried noodles was tasty and surprisingly not oily as expected - the chicken was a bit 'choppy' and the bok choy was just ok.\n\nSo all this was less than $20 and we had left over to bring home, not to mention the free bowl of the house soup and dessert (taro with tapioca).  \n\nFrom looking around, I see their stir fried dishes are most popular and they all looked very good.  We will definitely return for the clay pot rice - likely will get two and try one of their 15 flavors although the frog one is always tempting. \n\nBig plus:  they validate up to 2 hours of parking at Portsmouth Square!

Waverly Place has been recently redone so it looks a little cleaner, but still it's a cool little alleyway as you walk north with the view of the old ornate buildings.\n\nEverytime we take friends there, they're like 'What? You're taking us here?' - and i'm just like 'HELL YEAH!!!' - it's not the prettiest of places.\n\nThe food however makes up for appearance of the restaurant. The dish that everyone in the world must try is the Sweet and Sour Chicken. It's to die for. First time I tried it... pure ecstasy! I was like oh. my. god. this sh!t is good.\n\nI gave it four stars because sometimes we have to wait forever, and the service is not always what it should be,,, the prices are awesome.... we never spend more than 20 bucks for two people...\n\nGive it a try!", "author": "Richard T."}

I was pleasantly surprised that the service was great (especially considering the other \"services\" I've received in and around Chinatown) and the waitress was very friendly and helpful. I asked for recommendations for the noodle dishes and she said the duck one was rather good. I went with her recommendation and loved it. It was a sizable portion for $8.95 and I was stuffed leaving the restaurant. The noodles were delicious and I received an ample amount of duck meat. \n\nAmbiance: It's not a fancy place, but rather PLEASANT. I was able to have a great conversation with my friend it was not loud at all. Great, clean place to eat, chat, and exchange thoughts.\n\nTransportation/Location: Located between Grant and Stockton/offshoot Washington Street.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-09-22", "description": "My quick rule of thumb for picking out a decent cheap Chinese place in SF:\r\nThe yellow ratio - if Chinese customers to non-Chinese customers is at least 3:2 then you're good to go on the grounds of authenticity, menu selection, and the ability to customize your order.  If there aren't enough tables of people in the restaurant to apply the ratio, well that's not a good sign in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo how was this rule successfully applied to Utopia cafe?  Well first, I was a little thrown by the name Utopia restaurant.  I mean Utopia?  That's way more whitified than something like New Sun Hong Kong Restaurant, which is essentially as redundant as saying \"Chai Tea\" and whitified normally means too salty and greasy in my book to be any good.  But the cheery yellow awning and random icicle lights in the middle of Waverly alley at least convinced my friend and I to walk up to the window and peer in.\r\n\r\nAnd that's when we applied the rule - more Chinese people than white.  Sweet.  Let's go in.\r\n\r\nHow did we fair?  Well, it was decent food!  I was still nursing (at 9pm) a hangover from the previous night, so I was craving salt and pepper fried chicken wings.  They came out quite perfect.  Tasty, piping hot, and juicy.  Plus, they had clay pot rice, which while it looked like a large hamburger patty slapped on top of a pot of rice, was savory and crispy on the edges.\r\n\r\nDespite the decent food, it's a 3 star place because I hate it when there are fruit flies buzzing around a restaurant.  I've seen fruit flies in all kinds of restaurants, regardless of cleanliness expectations, but it just gives me the eebie jeebies.

From porridge to noodles this place has all the good stuff, and it taste fresh and home made without the MSG.  I recommend their salt and pepper chicken wings... don't ask just order!

They gave us some soup while waiting for our order of clay pot and another dish.  Just one turn-off was they included service charge on the bill (we don't look like tourlists!)\n\nWe wanted to have their clay pot again, but at our second visit a few nights ago, things were little different.  All seats on the ground floor were taken so they sent us to downstairs.  The room looked like a karaoke room trying to be a banquet room; a TV screen on the wall, a storage closet with mirrored sliding doors and half-way-done drawing of cultural architecture on the wall.  \n\nThe waitress was a little rude by asking we, two of us, wanted ONLY 2 dishes.  There was not soup this time.  It took a while for the food to arrive (compare to the next table which was seated right after we were seated), but they were tasty.  \n\nThen one of the workers came down, pointed something in the back of the room and yelled at us something we didn't understand.  Looking at that direction, I realized the floor was wet.  The water seemed to be coming from back of the room.  So we switched to another table.  A few minutes later the water was coming close to our way.  We asked if we could move to upstairs to another worker who came down, but she did not understand us.  So we just grabbed everything (purses, plates, tea cups and chopsticks) and head to upstairs.   \n\nThose who were working upstairs were surprised that we showed up with all our dishes but also looked more concerned not to make things obvious to other customers.  They apologized and said our bill was being fixed.  That probably meant removing the service charge.  It otherwise looked nothing unusual to me.\n\nI will probably go there again but not to downstairs!", "author": "April H."}

We got the raw cracked egg/ground beef one, and very few places can do the rice like Utopia so it's crispy and perfectly crunchy on the bottom and sides. IT is like the best treat, you wait til you get to the bottom and it's like eating rice crisps. \n\nWe also had the lamb claypot which was very nicely done, the lamb was pretty tender. \n\nSo... if you want serious tasty chinese homestyle food, there is a reason this place is crawling with Chinatown locals.", "author": "Subie C."}

As we walked past Utiopia something caught our eye; it looked cleaner than most restaurants in the area so we went in. The service was friendly and fast. We ordered a plate rice item and one clay pot. They were both served hot and they were delicious. On the way out the owner asked us if we enjoyed our meal and welcomed us back. Our two items (including tea) with a generous tip cost $20. All in all a very good restaurant on a very special street in San Francisco. How can you beat that?", "author": "Top Cat S."}

The bad thing was it only had 2 dumplings\n\nbut can't complain overall for that price.", "author": "kenny l."}

We didn't know how to pick a restaurant, so we just picked one with a lot of old people in it. They know their stuff, right? Haha. We walked in and was greeted by the woman behind the desk. She spoke to us in English (probably because we were teenagers and had a mexican guy with us), and when I answered her in Canto, she was surprised. Anyways, we were seated in a couple of minutes. Each of us ordered our own dishes (porridge with preserved eggs & pork, salted fish clay pot, and another clay pot with squid or something). The clay pots took a while to come out, but probably because they actually cook it in the pot thing? I had the porridge and it was greeeat! Usually the egg pieces would be small, but these chunks were pretty big! I love those eggs :). The bill came out to only $20 for three dishes. Deal or waaaaht!? Gave them a big tip at the end :)", "author": "Olivia D."}
