For part two of our weekly office lunch, I decided to try Black Sands. Our delivery order arrived via Caviar on Friday, August 10th a little after 12:15pm.\n\nI got the Fancy McMuffin: Fried egg, arugula, and bacon on panorama muffin, no maple mustard ($8). I love breakfast sandwiches, so this was totally up my alley. It all melded into one comforting bite. I did wish the egg was a little runny as I love my egg porn, but the addition of the arugula gave it a nice freshness. I didn't eat the muffin part, but it looked soft, chewy, and buttery. My kind of bread if I was in the mood for it.\n\nI heard Black Sands is currently for sale. Not sure what will happen to this spot, but I'm glad I had a chance to try it in it's present state.

It was a pretty great experience, with some amazing food! \n\nWe ordered their famous burgers with fries, along with some of their local beers. The beers were pretty average in my opinion, but their burgers are DELICIOUS. You get a large serving of meat with sizzlingly melted cheese on top that just makes your mouth explode!!! I cannot get over how great these burgers were. \n\nThe ambiance is pretty chill overall - it was pretty packed when we arrived on a Thursday night, but we were able to find seating still. The staff is polite and the food came pretty quickly. It's a great place to grab a bite with friends or even go on dates (as a few people were around us). \n\n4.5/5 stars, with only a half star deducted for the average beer.

Only later when he came back inside did he ask for the name of my party -.- \n\nAfter getting seated outside, I wanted to order immediately but he said he wasn't the server. Server never came and both people in my party went inside to tell them that...like this is the first time in my life I had to wait so long to get a server and had to ask them for one -___- \n\n-Matcha Cappuccino: smallest cup ever! 8oz for $4? Like really? And it wasn't even a cappuccino! It was a latte...I was a barista previously so I've made them before. I could tell the moment it came there was no foam and it wasn't aerated enough. When I told him about it, he just said I don't like to put foam in mines typically...and I'm just thinking does he even know what a cappuccino is? He went back and brought me a milk pitcher instead of a new drink....that was a first...and it still wasn't aerated enough. Smooth enough to be a latte but definitely NOT a cappuccino! Worst part was the matcha taste was nonexistent! I would expect with less milk for the flavor to be more apparent but I couldn't even taste a hint.\n\n-Avocado toast: it was smashed instead of the whole slices unlike the pic on yelp. I took a bite and the goat cheese was too much for me, but worst part was that it was barely toasted so it was super soft. She offered to remake it and the next one came out with even less avocado!! Like really? I'm paying $8 for it and you can't even cover the whole bread!? Seriously appalled by this.\n\n-Crab Benedict: I knew the moment I saw this it wasn't going to be good. The bread was not the typical muffin and there was nothing but crab meat and the egg. At least the egg was poached properly... The potatoes weren't crispy either. Hard to believe this cost $17.\n\n-Churro French Toast: This was the best dish of them all. The texture was pretty good, and there were a decent amount of fruit too. Nothing to complain about for this dish, but still not worth $14.\n\nThe time it took for the check to come before asking and how fast they picked it up was unbelievable compared to how long we waited for our food/server. They need to get more/better servers if this business can't handle the volume of people. Also, I can't see how they skimp out on the food portion when they charge so much...\n\nMy mistake to come to a brewery for brunch!", "author": "Tina P."}

My husband and I stopped by to try it out and there was a 'sign up' sheet to put your name on a list to get seated. No one ever came to the front so I went to the bar where two seats were available. I asked if we had to get seated or if it was first come. She said we had to get seated so I went back and waited. People starting piling up behind us and still no one acknowledged our existence. Then a guy walks in with another guy and they bee line past everyone in line for the two seats at the bar that I had gone to. So, I went up and asked about needing to be seated in order to sit there and he and the same woman bartender that told me I had to be seated there said 'oh he's just getting a drink'. And I was like, I was also just going to get a drink. So he just got to skip everyone and no one said anything. She didn't seem to care at all in fact. And then still no one else acknowledged us. So screw this place. Obviously they don't give a crap about their customers. And if you're going to have a policy to sign up so people get seated in a certain order, follow it. If you don't really care, then just let people seat themselves. Don't have something that makes it look like you should wait and then let other people skip people who are following your wait policy. We won't be coming back here again or recommending it to anyone. Based on the mediocre reviews already on Yelp, doesn't look like we missed much anyway.", "author": "Drew M."}

A big high-ceilinged room with the brewing plant open to the taproom, but that sounds like a cliched industrial-space brewery; here, it has been done with a lot of style sense.  White walls, blond wood, \"black sail\" canopies over the bar.  Also a home brew shop.   Open kitchen.  And serving breakfast, for Ninkasi's sake;  how many craft breweries dare claim that?  Very full on a Saturday mid-afternoon; I was lucky to find a space at a recently-vacated corner of a table for eight.\n\nFull bar, and a good wine selection, though there's no doubt that their heart is infused in beer.  Table service only after 5:00; otherwise, order at the bar.\n\n\n\nI ordered a flight six of 5- ounce servings, rather expensive at $24:  \n\n- Rose Shrine Farmhouse Ale.  5.9% ABV.  Slightly cloudy gold, light head.  Mild grassy nose.  Yeasty, with low hopping.  Brewed with black tea and rose hips...well, I thought I could taste rose, but perhaps that's the power of suggestion.\n\nSMASH El Dorado IPA.  (SMASH?  \"Single Malt And Single Hop,\" part of a house series.). In this case, Admiral malt and El Dorado hops.  Near-clear amber, halo and patches head, small-bubble carbonation.  Weak earthy and black pepper nose.  Honey note, though not especially sweet.  Spice and passion fruit notes.  Hop bitterness develops in the finish.\n\n- Eclipse Belgian Saison.  7.7 %.  Brewed 8/21/17, the day of a solar eclipse (which, of course, was not total hereabouts.)  Concord grape nose, tart and a bit perfumey.  Malt and yeast forward, sweet and spicy; so, what's a hop?  Pils, two-row, and acidulated malts, plus a wheat adjunct.\n\n- SMASH Azaica.  6.0%.  Near-clear orange-gold, light head.  Again Admiral malt, counterpoised with Azaica hops.  Stone-fruit nose, well-balanced hops and malt.  Canned peach nectar note in taste.\n\n- Crimson Haze Red IPA.  5.5%.  Slightly hazy red-amber, flocculent cream head.  There's a suggestion of rye in the nose, though no indication of it in the description of the grain bill.  German Red-X malt and wheat.  Cascade, Huell Melon, Azaica, and Ariana hops.  Dry and a bit papery.\n\n- SMASH Baja Kolsch.  4.4%.  Clear orange-gold, halo and patches head.  Perfumey nose.  Taste is somewhat at odds with the aroma; dry, crisp, and something \"meaty.\"   Boho Pils malt, Ariana hops.\n\nSingle gender-neutral restroom; downright attractive decor, but inadequate to the size of the restaurant and barroom.\n\nTwo blocks west of the sacred Toronado and the less-sacred Mad Dog in the Fog, making for a natural pub crawl.  On the MUNI 6 and 7 bus lines, giving a connection to Civic Center BART.  Parking?  Oh, you optimist!", "author": "Alan F."}

There was a slice of fried goat cheese on top and by the end of the meal nothing was left on the plate. The table shared a burrata flat bread, which unfortunately came out after we all got our meals, but still was very tasty. Nice creamy texture from the cheese. I personally got the mussels and enjoyed them very much. As stated on a lot of my reviews, I'm not a grease fan, and the chorizo in the sauce came in big pieces and and didn't create too much excess grease. Not your standard red sauce mussels you might get on the east coast, but still enjoyed every piece of meat, seafood, and drop of sauce!

Given the options, I'd rather try something more unique and inventive, but that's just me. \n\nDuck Garlic Noodles - These are no longer on the menu, as well as the this other incredible garlic noodle dish (I can't remember). The last time I came in was on chef Eric Ehler's last day and this was one of his specials. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. Hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had. I realize it's futile reviewing it at this point, but kudos for such a fantastic dish. They also had another garlic noodle dish once (I want to say bulgogi and burrata but I can't remember) and it was incredible. I haven't tried the crab noodles yet but my heart yearns for the garlic dishes long gone. \n\nAll the cocktails and lattes are wonderful. I always try a cocktail and/or latte when I come in (sometimes both). Sometimes the service is super slow and that's my biggest qualm with this place. Even when it's not terribly busy, it could take a while for someone to acknowledge my existence, and that's always frustrating when you're sitting at a bar and there are literately 3 bartenders walking past you and ignoring you. I actually got snarky once and asked if I wasn't dressed well enough to be served because I was in yoga clothes and had been ignored for 20 minutes at a practically empty bar and the bartender snapped into present time and took my drink order. Sometimes the staff seems a little pretentious but I've gotten lucky with a few more down-to-earth servers. It makes a HUGE difference.\n\nThe bathroom is rad as hell. Coolest public restroom ever. The overall aesthetic of the whole place is fantastic. Love the tile floors and marble tables and black accents. The lighting is usually really good for photos too! These are the things that really matter, after all. \n\nSincerely hope they bring back more asian dishes on the menu and less american ones. I know it's a brewery and they're appealing to the general masses, but some of the dishes that used to be on the menu were SO killer and it's lacking now. Come back!\n\n(I'll upload photos later)", "author": "Nikki I."}

Unlike others, our service was actually pretty good - attentive and quick - No complaints there.  \n\nSo why the three stars? Well for a brewery they only had 3 beers on tap - Their IPA was out and there was no pale ale, lager or pils, just a red ale, kolsch and brown plus a cider that doesn't really count as a beer.  I tried the Red and Kolsch and both were very good but usually I'm expecting at least a half dozen beers if not more to sample when going to a brew-pub.  \n\nI was also really looking forward to the burger which a number have listed as one of the top 10 or so in SF and it was disappointing - I always am looking for a medium - rare but it came out more on the medium side - I was super hungry so just dived into it but it wasn't really that juicy.  Seeing how things were being cooked it seemed almost like an assembly line - not a lot of care and personalization.\n\nBlack Sands has a lot of potential if they keep their beers on tap and add some more variety also pay a bit more attention to how things are being cooked - It's a great space and with a bit more maturity should be an awesome place - I'll probably be back but will wait a few months and see if things change", "author": "Roy D."}

The oolong tea was really good. I wanted to try green tea, but it had coconut, and I hate coconut.\n\nThey have smaller menu for brunch, but we tried the Fried Rice and the Chicken and Biscuit. The fried rice came with a soft egg, celery, onions, a spicy sauce, and we added pork belly. I got the fried chicken and biscuit with gumbo gravy. The fried chicken was a chicken breast that was seasoned with mild spices, there were two small biscuits, and a nice gumbo gravy. The gumbo gravy was the best part of this dish. I wish there was more of it because it makes the dish. Even a smidge more spice.\n\nI will definitely come back and try some of the other dishes available.

But they are dragged all the way down to the floor with horrendous service. \n\nMy latest experience at Black Sands was terrible. Point blank: It is absolutely irresponsible for this restaurant to operate on a first-come first-serve basis for tables. Especially during a Friday night. I couldn't count how many groups of people came in and then promptly left when they were left wondering how in the world they were going to snag a table without the help of a server/host or a queue system.\n\nI could excuse the lack of a waiting system if the bartenders/staff looked busy. However, I watched as a female bartender poured \"bartender's choice\" shots for everyone on the left side of the bar (and herself) multiple times during the night. If you have the time to be doing this, you ALSO have the time to be helping the 5+ groups of people organize themselves, find a table, and not just stand aimlessly at your front entrance. So, instead of serving 5+ more parties, you forced them all (including ours) to leave and take our money elsewhere.\n\nAs your popularity grows, rethink your business model on these busy nights and rethink how you staff your restaurant. I'm NOT the only Yelp reviewer here commenting on your poor service, so take note. I believe your servers would be better equipped to handle sitting guests better if you had a waiting system. I believe your revenue would increase because you're attending to customers who are otherwise leaving. And watch your bartenders, because having them take shots with already-paying customers while more groups watch is comedically terrible.", "author": "Kenny H."}

Beers are offered between 10 - 16 oz and priced around $5-$7 each depending on what you are enjoying.  They also note 'coming soon' so you can check out what to expect next time you come.  I grabbed the red IPA, a nicely balanced beer, not overly hoppy and it paired perfect with the AMAZING house made olives.  Honestly, it is odd to say how fantastic these olives were but the flavors they packed into these little things were out of this world. And, I also felt fancy AF nibbling on these things with the chopsticks provided. This place is all about keen attention to detail making the slightly higher price tag for the area totally worth it.\n\nI will be back to check out what they are brewing and offering here next.

They have fairly small menu, but they cover the major brunch categories - eggs w bread (either in sandwich form or otherwise), eggs not w bread, something sweet (ricotta pancakes), something healthy-ish (salad, granola) and of course something a little different (biscuits and gravy, breakfast fried rice).\n\nAdditionally, if you're looking to enjoy adult beverages to start your weekend day, they offer a wide variety of cocktails and their house made brews.  They have very high quality tea, as well as coffee options.\n\nService: it's seat yourself which isn't super clear from the side door.  But, it's a small space, so not a big deal to walk to the front and realize it.  The wait staff is prompt and friendly.  They are happy to explain anything on the menu.  While they check in on you regularly, I never felt rushed. \n\nFood: The food is high quality, and the portions are on par with most brunch places.  I didn't have them, but it looked like 3 plate-sized, fluffy pancakes was in an order of pancakes.  The torta a la cart was a very significantly sized sandwich, and the tartines are equivalent to a sandwich w a very generous portion of salmon.\n\nAmbiance: It's lively inside but still reasonable for conversation.  The decor is what I might call \"clean hipster,\" with white penny tile, light marble bar tops and black seats.  They also have some outdoor seating on the side, and some pretty cool wall art in the bathroom.  In fact, check out the bathroom!\n\nPrice/Value: As far as SF brunch goes, this place is pretty inexpensive if you stick with non-alcoholic drinks for brunch.  The portions are more than fair for the price and the quality of the food is great.\n\nOverall: I'm definitely a fan, and while I wish them the greatest of success, I also sort of want to keep this place a secret as a reliable, \"low maintenance\" (read no hour-long wait) brunch option in the neighborhood.", "author": "Sara E."}

While the bun here made the burger a little better than a double double, it did not make it more than triple-the-price better. Same goes for the fries. While marginally better than In-N-Out fries, in my opinion it wasn't double-the-price better. Everyone loves In-N-Out because they make tasty burgers for cheap. The $13 burger here should be a significantly different experience.\n\nFor beer I had the brown. It was fine, but ultimately forgettable. Service was also slow.\n\nUpdate: I was contacted by the owner who left me a nice message about how they price their burgers. While I realize that In-N-Out has the advantage of scale which enables them to offer lower prices, I still feel that if you can't at least get somewhere in the same ballpark price-wise, then I personally wouldn't choose to put the burger on the menu.

Besides their usual seasonal fruit and granola, french toast, there was maybe 5 other things to choose from.

It came with goat cheese and some kind of nut mix on top. The granola was crispy and perfect. Coffee was great. Another thing I love is that they add the tax to the price already so when they say something is $7, it is $7. It's great. Anyhow, I plan on coming back next week to try the Benedict. I drive to Berkeley once a month to have the best ones at Venus -- I've tried them in so many places in SF to great disappointment. But the ones at Black Sands looked solid - if anything the bread didn't looks soggy which is my biggest complaint. Great spot.", "author": "Miriam L."}

It was lively and and had a cool urban vibe.\n\nWent back specifically to enjoy a nice weather day as they have good outdoor seating and wonderful bright light. \n\nWe hit the Snack Menu 4p-6p.\nThe smashed burger was nothing more than a Jumbo Jack with wimpy patties too thin to not overcome. Medium rare was fully cooked with a hint of pink..\n\nThe onion rings are wrong. Never expected to have large papery dried fish flakes hanging off the the rings. This made the ribs taste poorly. If they were thinking to use them to add a salty flavor jut use salt. \n\nMy friend had a cheese dip and tortilla chips with a liquids sauce with a few jalape\u00f1os drowned in the sauce.\n\nThis is not grub pub food. It is more like fish food. Some chef over thought the menu and tried to do some crapy samurai fusion. Too bad.\n\nSuper disappointed. I would only go back to drink beer. Also do not recommend to go at 4 pm... There was no wait staff and the bar tender was too over stretched to provide good service.\n\nThe kitchen did get the food out fast.

Beer was great and the place seemed awesome but unfortunately the same can't be said for the food and service. After about 30 minutes the flatbread came out and we were told our fish tacos were on the way. Meanwhile the people next to us had come in, ordered, received their tacos and were finishing up. After about 55 minutes the tacos arrived with the smallest piece of fish I have ever seen, it didn't even fill half the small taco. Watching the service the food seemed to just go to random tables depending on who grabbed the plate. A new group of people seated next to us also had their order come out wrong and piece by piece.

Five minutes later the Benedict I ordered comes out and I can see the under cooked eggs jiggling around but I decide to taste them anyway. Stone cold!!

There was a crush of people at the bar and the bartender was pretty clearly overwhelmed.  We tried to stop a server to give our order.  We were told to order at the bar.  Server explained to us that \"we are a brewery, so we don't do table service.\"  This line of reasoning makes no sense when you consider how many breweries in the city have table service. \n\nWe noticed people squatting at tables (seating is at a premium) while waiting for friends to show up.\n\nOur food was excellent, the burger perfectly done, and we all raved about the tacos.   But it took a really long time, and servers kept trying to bring us food that other tables had ordered.  It became a joke between us and the two tables next to us, that we were just going to start claiming each others' food.  People were good natured about the hiccups, but there was definitely some collective eye rolling.  \n\nMy husband and I both had the beer flight; the beers ranged from fine to \"wow, would totally drink this on the regular.\"\n\nWe would love to return, because it's a gorgeous space and literally on the block we live, but it takes too much energy to deal with the uneven service, when all you want is a good beer, good food and to enjoy the company you're with.", "author": "Lorin Y."}

The pickled vegetables were delicious, and the chicken wings were a pleasant surprise of flavors. The burger was unmemorable. There was a house saison on the menu that was really fantastic, would highly recommend it to someone that enjoys Belgium style beers. Only complaint in the food department was that there were only three chicken wings in the order. Typically chicken wings means sharing in a group setting, but it is a little tough to share three. Also $16 for three wings is a bit outrageous.\n\nThey still have a lot of kinks to work out, mainly in the service. It was unorganized and a bit chaotic. We were seated at the chef's bar, but our waiter didn't show up for quite sometime, leaving us to wonder if we were supposed to be ordering somewhere else. Beers took an abnormally long time to materialize, waiters were unsure where to make room to put plates down, a split burger to share came out on one small plate.\n\nOverall I would give this place six months to mature, master their logistics, and then come back and try the food again.

Bacon was super cold.  I asked for a replacement.  That order was warm but super fatty.  Gravy biscuit was so-so.  Food overall a 2.5.  They apologize for the order mix up and discounted the bill.  I appreciated that enough to not write the place off.\n\nVisit 2: walked in around 3pm. Place was DEAD.  I ordered a cold brew coffee to go.  I was told, sorry, we don't do take out coffee service after 2pm.  I thought that was super weird.  Why would you turn away customers when your staff is just standing there twiddling their thumbs.  I can see if it's 8pm and you have a packed bar, but when there is more staff than customers? Doesn't make sense.\n\nVisit 3:  (well, not a visit). I was in a big rush on a Sunday morning.  I called around 11 am and asked to do a takeout order.  I was told \"you have to come in person to do a takeout order.\"  WHAT?! I can understand a no-takeout policy.  But what the heck is a \"take-out, but only if you come in to order\" policy.  That kind of defeats the purpose of trying to save time....\n\nAnyway.  Two stars.

One interesting thing was by the time we were ready to order our second round they told us that they were already out of the Mosaic.  This befuddled my companion and I considering that it was only about 7:30 but i'll chalk it up to it being the favorite.  The bar also had an extensive cocktail menu.  I ordered just your standard Manhattan to see how it stood up and was very pleased with the results.  THINKING they may have had home made bitters but didn't ask.\n\nFood 9/10:  The menu is not the longest in the world for dinner but they hit all the right notes for shared plates and good entrees at a reasonable price.  I ordered the fish tacos and loved the spicy chipotle sauce and radish like slaw.  Friend had some sort of fried rice with a fried egg and this did not last long on here plate before she unhinged her jaw and engulfed the plate.  Wish we had tried the side of fries, we could smell the garlic aioli wafting from the kitchen.\n\nCannot wait to go again on a free night and recommend you do the same.  Friendly bartenders and a low key scenery.", "author": "Ryan F."}

I tried Black Sands about a month after opening for food and beers.

The menus need a complete re-hauling and you need people who can cook. \n\nCouple of suggestions: \n1. Hot food should be hot; cold food should be cold. Don't serve salad on a hot plate. Polenta should be very hot (and throughly cooked). You would not serve a cold beer in a warm glass would you? Try the polenta at Brenda's. That is how polenta should taste. \n2. Season the food. Salt and pepper is your friend. \n3. Weird combinations are just that - weird. That's why they are not done by others. Keep it basic. It's a pub. \n4. Don't try to be everything to everybody. Again, it's a pub. Simple food done right will fly out the door. \n\nThe place is beautiful inside and I know a lot of money must have been spent on the remodel.

Food was okay - tried the breakfast polenta and chile verde. Smaller portions and not super filing. Toast was great though. Beautiful interior and great service. Would go again for beer and to try the dinner service.", "author": "jennifer m."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-22", "description": "Went to Black Sands a few weeks ago. I live across the street and love that there is even more opening up in the area! I had the cold brew and a chorizo breakfast sandwich. Both were great! I thought the sandwich was a bit expensive for what it was. I want to say it was $10+ when it should really be something like $6-7. \n\nI love the environment: open, clean, and spacious.\n\nWould definitely come back here!", "author": "Viet N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-03-10", "description": "San Francisco mediocrity. I went with a friend the another night and we sat at the bar. The wait staff was confused and couldn't be bothered to be helpful.  I had the burger, which was really an $11 big mac.  Actually, thats an insult to the big mac. there was no flavor, it came with nothing, the bun was just bland, the patty was crunchy (not how i like my burgers). I mean, I'm not a big fan of maven across the street, but their burger just kills this place. My friend had the taco salad and she did not like it one bit.  Even the beers were boring.  How can you have 12 beers on tap not one is drinkable.  It shocks me that this place can exist, but then i remember that SF loves mediocre boring food presented in a fashionable way.  Try at your own risk.", "author": "Noah M."}

And as an extra plus, the cool kids haven't quite figured out that this place exists, so we've never had to wait to be seated (though I expect that to change soon).  So Black Sands opened up on a pretty inconspicuous corner of Haight Street.  It doesn't have much signage (if any) on the outside, so it's easy to mistake as just another overpriced SF living unit.  But if you actually notice the glass door leading into a dining room, consider yourself in luck.  What lies inside is a food and drink experience that will make you ask \"why have I not coming here my whole life?\"  For starters, it only opened last year, so i can forgive myself for that.  What is somewhat less forgivable is that I haven't yet tried everything on my menu. But that's also difficult since they rotate their dishes quite frequently.  But, alas, the dishes I have tried have all been ridiculously delicious.   Ridiculously.  I have come at breakfast, for pre-dinner snacks and cocktails [yes, the concept of pre-dinner snacking is totally acceptable to me], and full on dinner.  Blown away every time.  My most recent meal involved a fried chicken sandwich, roasted fingerling potatoes, pumpkin seed hummus, and some bourbon.  In short, it was perfect.  I've actually had their fingerlings on a few occasions [they are part of the starters menu, which they begin serving at 4:00] and feel that every meal here should start with an order of these.  Also notable are their cocktails.  I'm no longer 21, so I really detest sweet bombs.  However, i find a lot of cocktails that are intended to be less spring-breakish to be, well, disappointingly odd tasting.  Not so at Black Sands.  Their cocktails are subtle and smooth and will make you feel like a Humphrey Bogart movie.  One note, this place doesn't have a big wine selection, so leave your fake ability to detect citrus notes at the door.  But trust me, you won't miss it at all.", "author": "Ash T."}

These guys have been super helpful for those looking to start brewing beer as a hobby. Now, the restaurant is open and they offer amazing beer and great food.
