The staff are really nice and definitely have their regulars (I love places with regulars). I ordered and they double checked my request for no tarter sauce. My order came out in less than 10 minutes and I couldn't wait to feed my craving.\n\nThe sandwich was pretty good. Nothing spectacular, but I wasn't expecting spectacular (I was expecting a good fish sandwich that wasn't from said archers place). Price point was reasonable and fries were also delish.

Based on the photos previously it seems like a small place but is in an interesting spot. Spotted beside a hotel, it has not a lot of seating. It appears to serve some of the basic options which are done well. Ended up going with some friends to get their different types of wings and ended up getting their Sweet Chili, Teriyaki, Garlic and their Medium wings with a side of their fries.\n\nSweet Potato Fries - More of an average cut. With a right amount of texture and crisp outside.\n\nMedium Spicy Wings - Not too spicy as other places would call it. More of a mild spice when referencing to a typical sports bar Buffalo wing and more comparable to the spiciness out of a mild Thai entree.\n\nGarlic Wings - Very crispy and very prominent flavor of garlic. Has kind of the profile of pesto when it comes to dryness of the garlic. Overall excellent.\nSweet Chili - Very saucy and flavorful wing. The sauce reminds me of the Thai Sweet Chili sauce used for egg rolls and other fried foods. Simple, but tastes very sweet with an extremely light sense of heat from the chili.\nTeriyaki - Good based sauce that resembles Teriyaki well. Especially if you enjoy Teriyaki sauce and wings, this would be for you.\n\nOverall I would recommend this place as it is pretty reasonable for prices for wings and provides other essentials such as burgers, and fries at a decent price. They also have a Happy Hour between 3-6PM here.", "author": "Frank O."}

This hole in the wall spot stands out from its neighbors but it won me over with their superb wings and crisp fries. I have only had the wings drenched in the \"Hot\" flavor, but it's been so good that I have not tried out the other flavors. The wings come with your classic accoutrements of celery and ranch. The sauce comes with just the right amount of heat and vinegary flavor and since the restaurant does not skimp on the sauce there is a nice amount leftover to dip for the crispy fries.  \n\nThe menu also consists of burgers and salads but the other menu options were disappointments. The burger consisted of a thin, unseasoned patty and a flimsy tomato. The salad felt like an afterthought. It's clear that the stars of this restaurant are the wings and nothing else.

Double Decker was the closest thing to us because we were not about to spend $27 on fried chicken.\n\nSo...the place looked bigger in the pictures. PEOPLE, can we please take photos that accurately describe the atmosphere?! Y'all with your fancy schmancy shots making it look like this place had more seating than it actually did...why?!\n\nAnyway. Yes, it's small, yes, it's attached to a Days Inn, so yes, I would've been skeptical, but you just can't go wrong with a burger that is simply a burger. Also, in the Asian-restaurant style I grew up with, EVERYTHING is all over the place and I think I must've been in the area where EVERYTHING goes. I grew up with this. You probably did not. I was used to it. You may not be. Probably something to keep in mind if ambience is more important to you than delicious burgers.\n\nBuddy got the western, which I totally wanted but I hate ordering the same thing, so I picked up a turkey buffalo burger (buffalo in that it's like buffalo wings, not like it's a buffalo or a turkey that thinks it's a buffalo or vice versa), because I was trying to be healthy. But yeah, I was at a burger place, and that wasn't gonna happen, so I ordered garlic fries because I'm a damn adult.\n\nWe sat down at the few tables on the ground floor. Kinda grimy, but it looks like that kind of place, so whatever. Food came pretty quickly and was astoundingly delicious. Funny how you look at an unassuming place and think the food isn't gonna be good. That's your damn mind playing with you. What I learned is that I need more buffalo turkey burgers in my life. It's easier to eat than a buffalo chicken sandwich and extra delicious, despite being really messy. It's okay, though. The garlic fries saved all the things I spilled, which made them even more delicious.\n\nHere's the important thing, though. The little baby child is kind of close to being in his terrible twos. The tables are not exactly stable. So the kid pushes the table and the drinks fly off and it's a mess. Oh man, did we feel bad! But the guy was so nice about it. Straight up graciousness right there. He understood and remembered when his kids were that age, he told us as he cleaned our mess. He even gave us fresh drinks.

For $8.50, I get a pair of Medium rare patties, American cheese and the usual condiment in a seeded bun. Every item is sold separately. So I ordered a small basket of Onion Rings for $2.50 and an iced cold bottle of Fat Tire for $4.00. The simple burger is good and not overly greasy. And the burger prices are fair, despite being located in an area known to have a few competitions in the area. The side of onion rings was okay and nothing too exciting. \n\nThe Chinese dudes operating the tiny burger joint were cool and treated me well. \n\nThe joint also serve Buffalo wings too.

I've stuck around watching them load boxes of frozen food into the kitchen to know everything else is frozen, which explains why even the fresh garlic used with the fries can't hide the frozen fry taste. Then again, almost everything here is fried since the other half of the menu is finger foods or chicken wings.\n\nWings are a good deal & they do offer some beer on tap which is even better when you swing by during happy hour.

Errr, I only eat the mild...\"\n*Cricket Cricket*\n\nAfter the Uncorked! Wine Festival on Sat, 5.22.10, my friends and I decided to came to Double Decker for an early dinner at 5:45 PM. \n\nFOOD:\n*Bucket of Half Mild and Half Hot Buffalo Wings($29.95 for 50) -I'm a fan of spicy foods and slather sirarcha, chili oil, chili sauce, etc over pretty much and everything and anything w/ the exception of desserts of course. \n\nIt was ok. The \"hot\" wings at DD were flaming hot and made my mouth burn. Upon finishing one, it felt like I just crammed a handful of flaming hot cheetos down my throat. The sauce was more spice than anything and not very tangy. More butter was needed to add a more savory finish. After eating several \"hot\" wings, I had to switch to the \"mild\" wings which had the spice most similar to tabasco sauce. The wings themselves were crisp, however, b/c they were overfried and fairly tiny, the meat was a little on the dry side. See pics:\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2qv3jQh4qTwgvYuTMBUrHw?select=g_A2qnqabgsd2JoRrOIr-w\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2qv3jQh4qTwgvYuTMBUrHw?select=EAP3SKIHPS5A8yCCk9r5wg\n\nThe blue cheese dressing was super creamy w/ pungent chunks of blue cheese crumbles which helped cool down the spicinss from the wings. The celery was very fresh and crisp.\n\n*California Burger ($6.95): It was ok to good. The Neiman Ranch Patty was thick and tender, but it was a little on the dry side b/c it was overcooked to a well-done. However, the swiss cheese, avocado, and mayo helped solve the dryness issue. The bun was only toasted on one side which made the the staleness of the bread more apparent b/c the crust and center was slightly hard and not fluffy.\n\n*Garlic Fries (Large - $3.45): Meh! Although it was well-seasoned and there was no shortage of minced garlic, the fries were soggy and held onto the oil like a sponge. Because they use fresh potatoes, I think the problem is they're not soaking it in cold water to draw out the starch. \n\nCC's accepted.\n\nSERVICE:\nDD is very causual; you order at the counter and they bring the food to you. The cashier who didn't know how 'hot' the inferno was seemed very aloof. It took about 10 minutes to get out order of wings, burger, and fries.\n\nAMBIANCE/DECOR:\nDD is very divey and is an odd U-Shaped. It's attached to the Days Inn next door. There's 3 small tables on the first floor which seats 6 people. The upper level seats about 14 people. There's flat screens on both levels which was on the local sports station. \n\nPARKING:\nStreet parking only which can be a little difficult in Hayes Valley. \n\nI wouldn't make a special trip to DD for their burgers or buffalo wings b/c they weren't very memorable. There's a lot of undiscovered places in the city, so on to the NEXT ONE!", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Unfortunately, Double Decker hasn't mastered the art that is the buffalo wing. Their wings are too soggy & not crispy enough. I don't want to feel like I'm chewing on pre-cooked chicken skin. Gross!\n\nI understand that this place has been around for quite some time so I'm sure they get other items on their menu right but I'm not coming back here.

Came here last night for a western burger, garlic fries and beer and boy, was it good. The staff was friendly, the burger was tasty, and the fries were so crispy and perfect. I split my burger with my friend who got a California burger. We both liked the western burger better but the BBQ sauce was pretty cold and chilled the burger a bit, but still delicious. The only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 was that it was a little more expensive than what I expected (~15.50 for burger, small garlic fries and a bottle of anchor steam), but I will certainly come back often when the burger crave hits. Those garlic fries were cooked to perfection and maybe the best I've ever had.", "author": "Sarah B."}

Try getting an order of the delicious fries with your wings.  They're a good compliment.\n\nThis is no gourmet restaurant, nor is it your local dive bar.

They could paint headlights and little signs that say \"Leicester Square\" or \"Tower of London\". Oh and they could get a bunch of those movable trolls from the \"It's a Small World\" ride in Disneyland, the ones dressed like royal guards that do high kicks in unison, and put them outside the windows. Yeah I like that...and then they could paint George Michael propositioning a cop at a urinal. Oh wait, that was in LA, wasn't it?...but hey, they could play \"Rule Brittania!\" on a loudspeaker. Is it a wonder to you that I'm not on HGTV Design Star?\n\nLike many others, I always thought the compact space adjoining the Days Inn was a bit eccentric to put in any eatery beyond a motel coffee shop. Previously, it was the pricier Zoya, and I think it was a sushi place before that. Now it's Double Decker Burgers, which seems like a more appropriate match since it is two floors and kinda shaped like a burger. It's just too bad that it's on Grove away from the heart of Hayes Valley since it's the type of place that would probably attract spontaneous foot traffic.\n\nI had their signature $7.95 Double Decker Burger, and it was quite good if a bit sloppy (see my photo). They use Niman Ranch beef, but nowadays, who doesn't?...and they melt both American and Swiss cheese on it. Its most direct comparison point is Pearl's, and it even comes in the same red baskets. They have chicken and veggie options as well, and buffalo wings is their other specialty. French fries come separately, and you can get a small basket for $3 - good homemade variety and not too oily (see my photo). There are five small tables on the ground floor and more seating upstairs where you get a panoramic view of...uh, the Grove and Gough intersection. Yeah, how pretty...uh-huh.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...good burger and a better deal than Flipper's if you want a straight-up burger without the toppings\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...a squeeze in there\nSERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly in there though it seems a mite overstaffed even on a Pride Saturday\nTOTAL - 4 stars... give it a try...I'd like to see this one succeed", "author": "Ed U."}

I can get in and out in 10 minutes even without calling ahead. Full disclosure: I eat veggie burgers which may cook faster or something\n\n- Speaking of, they've changed their veggie burger patties and they're waaaay better\n\n- New buns that are far softer and seem fresher. Almost doughy but in a good way. Really good\n\n- Fries are on the greasy side but are crisp and consistent. Very few softies.\n\n- Lettuce is portioned and balanced.

Far superior to the nearby Chez Maman West and Absinthe (which, to be fair, are not burger joints). If you are in/around Hayes Valley and craving a burger then look no further. The decor is, well, nonexistent, it's a tiny spot attached to a Days Inn. That said, it was totally clean and had plenty of seating, including an additional upstairs level just for dining.\n\nThe burger delivers a juicy and tender interior with a delectable crisp on the outside. I think the secret here is in the sourcing - the ground beef all comes from Niman Ranch, which is an Alameda based collective of livestock producers who raise and process animals ethically and responsibly. Whole wheat buns with fresh lettuce/tomatoes/pickle are rounded out by perfectly melted cheese (in my case both Swiss and Cheddar on the \"Double Decker\" burger).\n\nWell worth a visit for any burger connoisseur, you will not be disappointed. There is beer and wine as well, and a nice little happy hour, although again, don't go for the ambiance, this place is more concerned with making great food quick and easy than having a nice looking place.\n\nAs such, it's definitely not a date spot; nor vegetarian friendly (a few salad offerings that don't seem to be the strong suit of the place). This is a great spot for inexpensive, yet high quality food of the burger/wings/fries variety.\n\nEnjoy!", "author": "Sam P."}

The first thing I had already known somewhat, but the second thing surprised me.  I'll elaborate more in just a bit.\n\nI stopped by Double Decker tonight.  I have seen this little restaurant in passing, and I always assumed it was the motel restaurant of the Days Inn located next door.  That's not the case at all, and thanks to Yelp and some very positive reviews I decided I wanted to try the burger here.\n\nI ordered the Double Decker Burger and a small side of French Fries.  There's a photo of the burger posted by the restaurant in the photo section on Yelp, and I recalled it looked delicious.  It turns out that burger looks exactly like it did in that photo.  Two beef patties (they use Niman Ranch beef here), pickle slices, a lettuce leaf and both American and Swiss cheeses melted on top of the meat served in between a fresh seeded hamburger bun with just a slather of mayo on the bun.  Normally it comes with onions and tomatoes also, but I wasn't in an onion mood and asked to have it omitted.  Fresh tomato was cautiously left off due to the recent bad tomato episodes outside of California.  What'd I think?  It was a very good burger, and with each hot, juicy bite I could feel my arteries harden.  The fries were just a bit oily but excellent with a nice crispy exterior surrounding hot, meaty potato in the middle.\n\nDiscovery Number 1: There's an old Chinese saying that my parents use to use on me that loosely translates into, \"The belly is full, but the eyes are not.\"  In other words, I'd be completely stuffed, but the sight of more food left me wanting more.  So there I was eating my burger as other patrons walked in to order Double Decker's Buffalo Wings.  I witnessed others enjoying these wings outside the restaurant, and I came to the conclusion that I had to try some wings too.  After I finished off my burger and fries I got up and ordered a half dozen Buffalo Wings.\n\nThe wings come in three degrees of heat - mild, hot and inferno.  Now I knew I couldn't handle really spicy foods, but I was certain I could handle something labeled simply as hot.\n\nDiscovery Number 2: I found out what a real wuss I am when it comes to eating Double Decker's \"hot\" Buffalo Wings because those wings left me sniffling and teary-eyed.  Dripping with a tangy, spicy sauce those wings were explosive.  I cried my way through the entire half dozen and happily enjoyed it.\n\nYes, I'll be back.  But the next time they see me here I'll take my wings on the mild side.  \n\nWhat's better you ask?  The burgers or the wings?

I've gotten delivery from here twice and while everything tasted good, the food arrived lukewarm. The delivery time was reasonable, so I'm going to blame the temperature on lack of insulation during transport.\n\nThe burgers are easily the best thing to order. If that was the only thing I tried and it was the right temperature I would probably call this place four stars. The wings and chips are an interesting combo. The chips at the bottom soaking in sauce are great, but the wings don't really have much meat on them. The onion rings are pretty average, but make a good side for a burger. The milkshakes aren't bad, but I would call them slightly overpriced for the quality.\n\nIf you're thinking of trying this place, go in person and don't get the wings.", "author": "Cameron P."}

After he slurped down the first, he stared at the menu with that look of hesitation. It was a battle of self-will & it was glaringly apparently he didn't want to win. So, second shake he had.\n\nI ordered a spinach salad & was presented with one of the biggest salads I've ever had in SF. (Firewood cafe may be in close competition) The way to win my heart is to give me a massive salad. It's easy & cheap enough to provide a customer with--make me feel like a veggie queen.

It's a strange little space connected to a Day's Inn Motel on Grove between the Opera House and The Western Addition.  I normally don't trust restaurants that cover walls and windows with photo's of their food, but this joint looked like they posted their own pictures and they are authentic.  A cool young Asian dude took my order and he's like in your face the second you enter the doorway.  I thought it was really tiny until he told me I could wait for my food upstairs, but I chose a table out front on the street instead.\n\nI usually opt for a restaurants signature menu item so here I ordered the Double Decker, a soda and fries and outside I went where I waited about five or ten minutes for my grub.  There was a steady stream of customers coming in and leaving, so food was always being cooked but there was no frantic feeling.  I was happily surprised when the guy who took my order appeared with two red plastic baskets containing my delicious looking burger 1st and my fries 2nd.  The burger consisted of two patties, one draped with melted swiss, the other with melted cheddar, cooked to perfection resting on a toasted sesame bun.  A wide swath of mayo covered the bottom under the meat, and there were pickles, tomato, onion and lettuce on the side.  \n\nThe fries were obviously house cut rather than frozen and had the added pleasure and taste of being twice cooked or pre-blanched which adds depth and richness to the fries, delicious!  My first bite into this thick and gorgeous burger was heavenly, hot juices, good meat, melted cheeses and a toasted bun are beautiful things when put together like this.  I didn't give this place a 5th star because there was a lingering taste that just didn't match all the other great attributes of the place, but I have no idea if that was me on a bad day or something in one of the ingredients.

Go for the all-you-can-eat or happy hour specials.  The owners are very friendly too.  I'm sure I'll be back.\n\nTHE DETAILS:\nI had the all-you-can-eat special for 11.95 and the homemade chips.  If you're not going to eat a lot, then the 1/2 price dozen wings during happy hour (M-F 3-6pm) is a great deal.\n\nThe wings are on the small side but I suppose it's not a big issue when it's all-you-can-eat.  They were nice and crispy, which is how I like them, but they are heavily sauced so the crispiness goes down a bit if you let them swim in the sauce for too long.\n\nI started with the inferno, which was surprisingly spicy.  It had a good flavor without being overly sour, which is problem with a lot of wing sauces.  I've had hotter wings before, but these were pretty spicy.  After I finished my original 13, I decided to try the hot.  These were OK but the inferno had more flavor, so I went back to the inferno.\n\nThe fresh potato chips were an interesting option.  They were good, but nothing special.  I'll try the fries next time.", "author": "Richard C."}

On first bite you'll think to yourself that it's not so bad and that the people getting up every 2 minutes for more water are just wimps. However, this heat creeps up on you, and next thing you know you're only trying to finish the damn thing in order not to look like a wuss. They're good though, and I can see their addictive properties. Definitely not complaining. The hot wings also live up to their name, and I ate several of those. Blue cheese dressing is served as a dip, as are celery sticks for cooling purposes. \n\nThe fries are pretty good - slightly crispy with the skin still on. They reminded me of a somewhat thicker version of In-n-Out's fries but more irregularly-shaped. It wouldn't surprise me if they've never been frozen. However, I'd definitely forgo the burger ($5.95, no sides) next time - they do advertise Niman Ranch beef and while I'm sure they're not lying, I found the beef a little bland and the color slightly unappetizing. I can get something yummier from In-n-Out for cheaper. \n\nNo fountain soda, but they do have beer so it balances out. I like the upstairs area that can be reserved for groups, though I'd imagine if you weren't sitting up there it'd be hard to eat in as the space downstairs is very limited. \n\nSome of the wings and the occasional fry had these weird stringy packaging material attached to them - at first I thought it was hair, but the consistency was different enough to where I'm pretty sure it wasn't. However, it was a little gross, and it's the reason it's a 3 - after all, I'm not going to seriously penalize a wings joint for not having a good burger. \n\nOverall it was pretty okay, and the Wednesday all-you-can-eat wings for $11.95 is a really good deal - odds are I'll be back, but not for the burger.", "author": "Sus...

Putting it on my fries I had one of those \"this is not the usual ketchup moments.\"  I actually started dipping my fries in the wing dressing...\n\nAnd speaking of the wings -- I ordered them \"inferno\" style.  Now, I am *not* the person to ask about levels of spiciness.  My brother says when people ask me that sort of question there should be a sign under my face that says: \"Professional Driver.  Closed Course.  Do Not Attempt.\"  So, when I say that the wings were pleasantly spicy, you can calibrate that remark for yourself. ;-)  \n\nThe wings are your basic traditional buffalo-style preparation.  Butter & Crystal sauce.  I believe that the \"inferno\" variation adds several shakes of cayanne pepper to the mix.  This makes for a nice spicy-on- the-tongue-as-well-as-the-back-of-the-throat feeling.  The wings come with celery and nice thick blue cheese dressing for dipping.  \n\nIf you need plenty of wings to make you happy, they have all you can eat wing nite on Wednesday.  \n\nI'm glad there's another option for a tasty inexpensive lunch in Hayes Valley.", "author": "Stephan W."}

At least I hope it was chopped garlic and onions. hahhahahah\n\nThe chicken wings are very small.  Not worth getting messy for such a small piece. The taste is there, but for me.............I need a chicken wing that is bigger than my pinkie. \nGarlic fries were old.  They probably need to change the oil or make these fries made to order.

That's always a good sign.\n\nThe hot wings, by comparison, were very good and could be eaten without severe discomfort.  The potato chips were very good, fried and salted just right.

This is awesome, because only locals hang out.  And because it's a sportsbar vibe, there weren't a ton of pretentious foodie SF types milling about.  So I felt real comfortable.  There was a TV showing the game.  My boy Jake was down to watch the game and drink a beer.  He ordered a beer and got some hot wings.  I ordered a double decker.  Now this burger reminds me of a fancy Double Double from In N Out, which is definitely a compliment.  The meat was high quality, the flavour was great, the food, ultimately satisfying.  It was like having a delicious burger brick in your stomach.  I drank a coke and watched the game for a minute.

These wings fell right on par with the others.  They were alright.  The flavor of them was very  \"Franks\", nothing special.  They were smaller and less meaty than other wings I have had in the city.  This might have been a problem except that I was there for all you can eat wing night, Wednesday.  I love the concept - but some meatier wings would have been better for me.  On the plus side, the location is fun, the place is really cute and fun, and the staff were really nice.  They were responsive when I ordered more wings - which I did several times and in the end I really had a fun time.\nA suggestion to getting the most out of All You Can Eat Wing Night.  I ordered wings the same way I order Jack and Cokes at the Blackjack tables in Vegas.  When the shapely cocktail waitress brings you a drink order another right then.  Then you are never without a drink - or in this case wings.  \nWe sat upstairs out of the wind - but on those warm nights I bet sitting out on the street would be extra fun and when that night arrives - worth another trip.", "author": "Bill G."}

What sells at Flipper for 10 bucks you can get here for 6. And I think they actually  do a better job of grilling the meat, tho the burger is not quite so thick and wide as Flipper's, &  there's no acoutrement of salad on your plate- but - (big but) for no frills, this was not bad. The burger had all that (ALL the fixings) on it. And no roaches either!\nThe salads are good but they ought to give you a larger container of dressing- somehow there's just not enough to really get the greens all wet, since they load it up with a good healthy dose of them...\nTheir real problem is space. Not a lot of it considering the amount of business they are getting at the lunch hour, which means a longer wait if you are upstairs, perhaps, but then it's interesting eating there- just a little cramped I would say.\nThe hot wings are pretty good, and since I like hot wings that'll make you sweat, these really did the trick.

We had a all cousin dinner and all 19 of us took up the upstairs of the restaurant.  It was very clean as we had 6 kids with us.  On to the food.  \n\nSince there was so many of us we were able to order burgers, wings and several sides.  Since I wanted to try both the burger and the chicken buger I shared with my cousin (I know which one..well one of them that was there) and my sister.  The California Burger...very tasty (they use NIman Ranch beef) and just the way I like it.  With melted swiss and creamy avocado.  I definitely didn't have to add anything else to it ie. ketchup.  The California Chicken....i know same thing as the regular burger.  Hey I gotta give myself an opportunity to come back to try the other burgers here.  The chicken was very good and juicy.  Most places with chicken burgers they usually come out dry but definitely not here.  Definitely a must if you are a white meat lover.  \n\nHmmm..now the wings or the sides.  Let's go with the sides..I would need more time to think of how to describe the wings.  The garlic fries were really good...there was garlic bits all over the top.  Definitely don't eat this if you are planning on kissing anyone after.  The chips very also very good.  The kids were definitely fighting for this.  We will definitely order 3 and not 2 the next time.  Now the onions rings were also another good side to have.  Yes they look exactly the way they are in the picture.  The batter was perfect and fried to perfection.  We also had a regular fries but I assume they were almost like the garlic ones...what kind of aunt would I be if I fought the kids for it.  \n\nNow onto the buffalo wings mild, hot or inferno.  I tried all three.  I started with the hot and boy was it spicy.  I can definitely eat spicy but my goodness my mouth was on fire after my first wing.  Good thing I had a pint of Hef to kind of kill the fire.  Then I tried a mild...I know wrong order the hot got too spicy after a while.  There was a little spiciness but definitely a good choice if the hot is too hot.  Then 3 of us crazy ones decided to try the inferno since one of my cousins had previously tried it.  After half of a wing he couldn't talk.  So what I did was i licked it first and my whole mouth was burning.  Then I took a bite and I was on fire.  Chugging my Hef I just jammed the rest of the wing in my mouth and lived with the burning and drank the rest of my beer.  I think my tummy ached after from the inferno wing.  I will definitely come back again for the hot and mild wing but don't know if I am brave enough to eat the inferno one again.  \n\nDefinitely a great wing and burger joint and another plus they deliver.  I have already sent some of my friends here to try it.  You definitely won't be dissappointed.", "author": "Allison T."}

On one hand, you have the homestyle burger like your mom used to make - an inch thick, maybe grilled on the barbecue.  This is a delicious kind of burger, like the kind you get at Zeitgest or Bender's.  On the other hand, there is the old-fashioned hamburger stand kind of burger, ala In-N-Out, delicious, but in an entirely different way.  Double Decker is of the second sort, and it is magnificent.  To risk heresy, it's better than In-N-Out.  Greasy, American Cheese, onions in the meat.  And the fries are great too.  And the building is a throwback.

For those who like their wings HOT, you need to brave their inferno buffalo wings..it's got a real kick to it!  Hot crispy wings drenched in their house made super spicy buffalo wing sauce. YUMMY! Their signature burger, the double decker is good as well; they use all natural beef by Niman Ranch which is another plus.  I had the double decker without cheese, but added bacon..mmm!!   Two succulent patties topped with bacon, lettuce, and tomato on a fluffy, lightly toasted kaiser bun.  Are you drooling yet?!  Their thick cut fries are fried when ordered, so they come out hot and crispy!   I prefer this place over Flipper's, the food is way better and the owners are really nice and friendly!", "author": "Pegs C."}

They taste good and the prices are reasonable. However, its not the burgers that bring me to this place. Their wings are great and so are the garlic fries. The prices are very good. \n\nOrder yourself a burger and split an order of wings with your friends. I personally like to mix my wings between mild and spicy. They have one thats even hotter but I haven't tried it yet.  \n\nThey also have water on hand in the upstairs dining area which is useful when those wings start to get to you. \n\nAnother cool thing about Double Decker is that the staff are pretty cool people. Oh yea... they have big screen tv's both upstairs and downstairs. Go check them out.", "author": "Giacomo R."}
