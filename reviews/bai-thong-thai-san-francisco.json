This was my first time visiting the Hayes area, and I was amazed to see so many food restaurants. My family and I decided on a Thai cuisine; it has been a cuisine I added into the list of food to try and eat. \n\nThe restaurant is pretty and also cozy, which also meant the seating area is few. There were empty chairs and tables, but we waited until the staff directed us to a table. This took a little time for it looked like there was only one staff who was taking orders. After sitting down, it also took a while to retrieve the menu. Right beside our table, there was a stand that stored menus. We first debated if we were supposed to get the menu on our own or wait until the staff delivered it to us. Eventually, the staff did deliver our menus, but it was an unusual moment. \n\nThe time when taking the order and the order arriving was fast. The time to receive a check is a hurdle, so if you are on a time crunch (concert or a performance is happening soon), I would recommend leaving your table and paying it at the counter. \n\nJumping to the food, we ordered the Thai fried rice, Pad see-ew, and the crispy calamari. Two members of the family drank coffee, so we decided to order lightly. The portions are good for a light eater, but the crispy calamari helped finish the meal with a full stomach. My favorite is the fried rice. It is the taste I like: the subtle toasty flavor. We ordered to have the pork option and it went well. The pork is cut into bite-sized pieces and the meat is tender, so is easy to eat.\n\nThe Pad See-ew was delicious too. The noodle was flat, wide, and very thin. I think that helps absorb the sauce and flavors. The thickness is easy to eat with a fork. We have ordered it with the beef option, so the flavors were bold and very good. The vegetables were cooked tender, so there was no chewing hassle. \n\nLastly, the appetizer, the crispy calamari. I am very glad we have ordered this because I was feeling of eating squid. The squid was tender and sweet, and the fried batter was crispy. It was cooked with onions and the sweetness of the onion brought out a mellow flavor. \nThis appetizer came with a sauce: a combination of mayonnaise, siriachia, and wasabi. This went very very good with the fried squid. I don't eat wasabi very much because I don't like the punching pain in the nose. However, the wasabi gave a fresh taste in the mayonnaise sauce. \n\nThe food was very good, and I enjoyed my visit. The only downside was that because there was a wait time for the lonely staff running about, there were tables of impatient customers. Again, I would recommend to take the menu to your table and pay at the counter.", "author": "Mito I."}

Having played golf earlier the last thing i wanted was a restaurant in HV (Hayes Valley) with a line out the door or having to walk forever to find something. The place was so empty we thought it was closed. But no it closes at 11 and considering it was a bit after 9, I figured we must be between foodie rushes. Bae has met co-workers here for lunch and vouched for it being decent. \nThe signature dish I compare all Thai places to is the pad Thai I had in Bangkok with Shrimp and fried tofu.  So I got it here. \nGreat value for $16 bucks! It was not the best nor far from the worse. \n\nService was strange another test I have is if they bring out the trilogy of spices when I ask for hot spice. \nThey only brought me sambal olek (chili garlic sauce) which I added liberally. Normally the trilogy has pickled Thai chilies, sambal and a dry chili. I know they have it. Because as the restaurant started filling up, a solo guy who was very particular ordered (no I wasn't dipping in on his conversation, he was just that loud) got it in the sliver holder with 3 glass jars of spices. I suppose I had to be particular. The waitress who took the order from me was stunned. Apparently I made the order of shrimp pad Thai in a very close Thai accent. She looked at me really hard with a smile said you don't look It but you order with Thai accent. Which should have been an indication that the chili trilogy should have come with my dinner. \n\nAnyway the pad Thai was a huge portion with fresh noods, sprouts, lime wedge, nuts off to the side, lots of giant prawns and plenty of big cubes of tofu. We couldn't finish it. (I hoped to make some homeless soul happy by handing over the paper carton as we walked back to the car, no homeless in sight!) it needed heat and sambal didn't bring it up to Bae keeping her fork outta the plate hot. \nFortunately I have Thai chili's at home swimming in my own rice vinegar/ fish sauce with a bit of Stevia and sliced shallots concoction. That should make left overs a hot delight!", "author": "Craig G."}

I used allset to dine-in quickly, and:\n- The food was reasonably priced\n- There was a TON of it\n- It was pretty good if not amazing\n- The staff was attentive and friendly (mostly)\n\nI got the Chicken Pad Thai, which is my gold standard (along with larb) for Thai food, and it was...alright. At first I was even a little disappointed since it's clearly anglicized - it had a garlicky taste and was missing some of the real savory, rich notes that the best Pad Thai has (not to mention any nuttiness). \n\nThe more I ate, though, the more I discovered it was actually pretty solid. For one, this place has probably The Best Fried Tofu I've had, bar none. Their was plenty of it and it was fried to perfection - just the perfect golden outside, perfectly cooked inside. For another, this is probably the largest single portion of Pad Thai I've ever been served. For the finale, I discovered how delicious adding spice to this really made it. They'll bring out three kinds of things to spice-it-up, and they're all *really* solid. Their spicy sauce and flakes are spot-on, and the jalape\u00f1o juice really brings out the flavors.\n\nThe other funny thing was that the place was totally empty (granted it was 445PM, not a common time for dinner) when I waked in, and it took them several minutes to notice I had arrived. Beyond that, though, they were great about bringing water, etc.\n\nI guess you could say the whole experience started off on an unimpressively but ended up really rounding out just fine. I wouldn't give this place any awards, but I definitely wouldn't mind dining there again.\n\nI have literally an entire second serving of Pad Thai that I had leftover...can't wait to eat it.", "author": "Chris S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-11-17", "description": "Dropped in here because my companion and I were too hungry to walk any further, but now I wish we would've kept going. \n\nHealth inspection warning aside, I foolishly thought maybe the resturant had improved since the slew of critical Yelp reviews, but upon the food arriving I realized just how wrong I was.\n\nThe two entrees we ordered were the pad see ew with chicken and spicy string beans with pork. The pad see ew was soggy; the noodles were in disintegrated piles over the plate (you can see for yourself in the pictures below.) And look - I know better than to expect five-star plating, but in this case the unappealing presentation belied the actual quality. The broccoli was undercooked and bland, with the chicken being heavily underseasoned (for some reason the piling of woefully sweet sauce on top didn't do anything for it upon biting down.) \n\nThe spicy string bean with pork was the real disappointment of the night, though. Even though the menu boasted the little red chili that's supposed to indicate spiciness, the actual dish was heavily sweet, consisting of more ginger and garlic than actual chili. In fact, the only evidence of \"spice\" I found were the red flakes floating sadly on top of the greasy soup of sauce like they had something to prove. The pork was in dry, thin strips, tasting of mostly sawdust, and the beans were as waxy as a raw candle. \n\nMy companion even pointed out that their water had been poured to them lukewarm, barely even cold. Good God. If you can't even get the temperature of the water right, then consider exploring a different career path.\n\nWe left disappointed, without finishing either plate or with a doggy bag. Wouldn't consider coming back within my lifetime, unless the food quality magically improves and the chef learns to take criticism. At least the service wasn't god awful, but if the only positive thing to say is \"this part wasn't terrible\" then there's quite obviously something wrong.\n\nWord of advice: trust the reviews.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-01-30", "description": "There is a sign in the window asking patrons to boycott Yelp, claiming Yelp bullied people and kept them from writing good reviews. I thought that was odd; I 've been \"yelping\" for years and never been censored, and the reason I tried Bai Thong Thai was because of good reviews on Yelp. So if i give it 2 stars, it's not because Yelp \"bullied\" me, it's because they deserved it.\n\nI had a 5 PM dinner reservation; when they open. There was one couple ahead of me, who were seated by a window. There were several small tables available by windows, which are considered the better seats, but I was seated interior. It's not a huge deal, food is primary, and maybe I'm being over-sensitive but many places do treat solo customers, especially women, as less.\n\nBut food is primary. I ordered Angel Wing, Tom Yum soup (vegetarian) and Roast Duck over rice.\n\nWings were best, although not at all crispy, good taste. The soup was overwhelmingly sour. Thai food is supposed to be more balanced. But it would have been a good palate cleanser/sinus clearer between courses. Except halfway down the bowl was a huge wedge of raw, pallid, flavorless, out of season tomato. Not traditional and added nothing to the soup. Duck is a fatty meat, but has lean parts. This duck was fatty, not very flavorful, and sparse; the dish was mostly rice.\n\nThen they brought the check without asking if I wanted dessert, a big no-no. I asked for vanilla ice cream, I had thought about coconut but figured I'd stick with the most basic thing that no one could goof up. The ice cream was in a pretty blue dish with a swirl of chocolate. It was FULL of big ice crystals. That happens when ice cream partially thaws and is re-frozen. Aside from aesthetics, it left me concerned about their food storage habits. \n\nIronically, after earlier trying to hustle me out, when I did finish I had to wait a long time for check, finally had to wave the wait person down.\n\nFind myself agreeing with Michelle N who said same prices a Lers Ros but with worse food and service.", "author": "Carol S."}

First, I specifically said \"no green onion\" and the soup came up with a lot of onions atop, I didn't want to bother with them so I started picking them out one by one. The waitress watched the entire process and didn't say anything - did she forget that I said no green onion? Or did she just don't care? Then the main course never came, and the waitress just went to the other room with a glass of wine and hung out with other girls in that room. I wasn't sure what's going on so I went to that room asked her where's the main dish, and she looked astonished, went into the back and started cooking....... this is like surrealism in the form of a crappy restaurant, please don't go to this place so that it can be out of this neighbourhood fast.

The lights were on and 2 women were behind the counter welcoming me in but the door wouldn't budge.  It turns out the door was locked.  That might have explained why there were no other guests inside.  Either they locked up early and decided to let me in to order or they had left the doors locked all day and didn't realize it.  Hmmm....\n\nI was given water while I waited which was nice and the check came to pay for my take-out order.  I decided not to leave a tip as I usually do if I'm picking up the food myself since the payment is for the price of food, and there was no service given.  I noticed a change in one of the women's demeanor after that moment.  The food was yelled out \"Your order is ready!\" as I was just sitting at the table directly in front of the counter.  I don't think the yell was necessary, and why wasnt the water called out when it was ready?  I could've easily walked to the counter to grab that as well.\n\nAll-in-all the food was tasty.

Bai Thong is never packed, you can walk in anytime before showtime and get a table.  There's a reason for that.\n\nThe food here is a step above cafeteria food, some hit and some misses.  The portion is small and the price high.  The service is also hit and miss.  On a normal day when there are few people, the service is not bad; but there is no reason for you to come on a normal day.  On a busy day, like on weekends or some important premiers, this place has a lot more patrons and the staff is overwhelmed.  They are not rude but not well trained - I saw plenty of mixing up checks, bringing food to the wrong table, forgetting things, ignoring customers because they are so busy, etc.  Every mistake means they have to spend more time fixing the mistake and it just pile on to the point where they are just scrambling.  If you have to come here on a busy day, my advice is to be proactive and grab the attention of the staff and be prepared to flag them down several times before they come.\n\nNow, with that said. This is not a complaint - I like them for exactly what they are and I DO NOT want Bai Thong to change anything.   There is a reason that you can always find a table at this joint when every restaurant around there is packed to the sidewalk - it's because enough people decide that, \"Oh screw it!  I would rather starve than go to Bai Thong!\"; that I could get a table and I don't starve.  \n\nThis is the last restaurant you should go to in this part of the city but that's exactly why Bai Thong deserves three stars for those times when you have to eat, can't wait, and don't mind paying a lot for mediocrity.   \n.", "author": "Unai L."}

All of the vegetables were overcooked, and I'm going to give the kitchen the benefit of the doubt and say they were boiled, but they just as well could have been cooked in a microwave. The pad Thai was sickeningly sweet, and the Thai iced tea was even sweeter. The red curry saved this from being a one star review, as the sauce was helpful in distracting from the limp zucchini and string beans.\n\nInterestingly, this place has a sign in their window crying foul at Yelp, claiming their reviews are being censored.

Location and menu looked great. Our orders were placed and taken down quickly. But there was a real time management problem in the kitchen. We ordered within 5 minutes of being seated, but somehow it took 15 minutes just to get waters on the table, 25-30 minutes for the first dish to be served, and another (awkward) half hour or so before the other entrees made it out for the rest of our group. We had to beg our friend who received his food so far ahead of the rest of us to eat, or I'm certain it would have gone cold. When the check was handed to us (the correct version--they had initially overcharged us for an entree), we asked to split the check three ways, which they refused to do for some incoherent reason. This was particularly obnoxious, since they have a sign displayed in clear view which says that checks can be split up to FOUR ways. But, after spending nearly two hours (mostly waiting) here, we just wanted to get away, and figured out another division of payment. \n\nThe food here is okay, but the service isn't acceptable. Two other patrons seated nearby were not willing to wait as we did, and threatened to leave or actually left out of frustration over the same time management issues we encountered.

The fresh mango on top was absolutely delicious (could've eaten it without the curry but dipped in the curry was even better). The curry was light yet still rich and all the vegetables inside made it a very filling meal, easily split into two portions. Even though $13 is more than I would expect for a place like this, the curry was so good it was worth every penny. \n\nBasil Tofu- very average basil tofu dish. I liked the sauce it was cooked in, but not enough to pay $10 for it plus the cost of rice. \n\nRoommate tried the tomyum soup which she liked and also was a big serving size, but again for $14 which is quite a bit for soup. \n\nVerdict: For looking like a very regular thai restaurant (no extra embellishments in service or ambiance), it was too pricey. My roommates and I paid $50 for dinner when I could likely get the same priced food at a nicer restaurant with better ambiance in the city (ex Lers Ros nearby.

We came in as a group of 20 after my sister's graduation since I had made a reservation for this place a few weeks beforehand. We were seated in the back room and also did my order online to make things easier for them.  We started out with the duck salad, a beer tower, and two bottles of Pinot.  When we came into the restaurant it was quite empty for Mother's Day yet they were slow at getting us our drinks.  Of course we know we had a big group however they should've been a little more prepared since they knew we were coming.  I knew they were busy therefore I assisted in pouring the drinks for my family and was extremely patient with the service.  Next came our curry dish however only one came and we ordered three therefore we had to continuously play the waiting game for food.  Our beer tower emptied rather quickly and we asked for another beer tower and that took over 15 minutes before they were able to get it to our table. Then came the pad see ew, pineapple fried rice, eggplant with tofu and basil, and the sweet and sour fish.  The food was flavorful and fantastic however the service was too slow for our liking.  I really wanted to like this place and I will definitely come back and hopefully they will have their service issues fixed.

There was only one waitress working, and in spite of there only being about 4 tables full, she seemed vastly overburdened. We ordered a bottle of wine, soup, two appetizers and dinner. \n\nFirst, my dinner came out. Then a long while later his appetizer came out, and almost immediately his dinner came out. Then my appetizers came out about 15 minutes later. We asked about the wine and they apologized, and forgot it again. Then, finally, another woman brought out a bottle of wine. We both pointed out that it was a red wine and we had ordered white. She told us that we were wrong and uncorked it anyways. She poured it into my glass and, surprise! It's red wine. She then went into the back for a while and eventually found the bottle of white we'd ordered about a thousand years ago. At that point I asked her what had happened to the soup I ordered at the beginning of the meal, and I guess they forgot? Given the order of the rest of the meal, I have no idea. \n\nI got my soup and there was a bug in it. I immediately picked it up, went over to the counter and quietly but politely told them that there was a bug in my soup. An older woman grabbed the soup, looked at the bug and then really rudely and loudly told me that I was wrong, it was a spice. I told her that spices typically don't have legs and wings. Then, she started arguing with me about it. I had laughed off everything else before that, trying to make the best of it, but that was my breaking point. Also? Her solution was to fish it out of the bowl with her fingers and throw it away. I walked away and back to our table because at that point I was pretty much done with the whole experience.

For this being my first visit, the first impression of any restaurant is of the utmost importance. My first impression walking in offerred a pleasant ambiance that was not matched by the food our service.\n\nWhen I was finally seated, I waited a long time to be greeted and taken care of.

The faces of other patrons were not of a good mood, so I decided to go straight for entrees figuring I would be waiting longer if i did.\n\nThe food was fair, but from studying culinary arts and have studied and traveled abroad, it just didn't match up to what I expected. Thai food is normally full of flavor and keeps you coming back for another bite until your plate is finished.  I have been in the service industry now for 23 years and have a good eye for a  restaurant that is ran smoothly. This is far from it. It most likely starts from the front of house as they can control the speed of the kitchen, the happiness of the customers, and the temperature of the food. (My food was delivered luke warm if you can call it that)\n\nI stopped into this location on a weekday about 6:30.

After 30 min (!) we were served. All that the beef curry needed was a stamp from Purina and my partners fish looked like a large coster. Over cooked and no meat. They apologized and slipped us the bill to a whopping $38 for unedible food. Stay away!!!", "author": "M F."}

It's very attractively presented in a salad bowl (literally) on a plate. And everything was really fresh and savory. Also had the Tom Kha (Coconut Soup) which was good but I guess there is coconut milk but no actual coconut in this one . There were a good number of customers on Friday night, but not so many that we had to wait. The Thai ice tea is good but not as good as other places I've been to. Service was fine but why is it that no matter what restaurant a person goes to the waitstaff inevitably comes over when your mouth is full of food or you're in a really good conversation and they ask you how your food is and do you need anything? And then when you would like to talk with them, they often just can't be found? Life is funny that way.... My friend had the beef salad and we both finished everything. Saturday night, due to the weather, we were the only ones in there at 8pm! But it seems to have resulted in more duck on my salad and more beef on his and a lot more chicken in our coconut soup. Also, the first night, there was sliced pear in my duck salad, the second night, no pear, but there was pineapple instead. Both were very good. Bottom line I would say, the food is three to five stars depending on which dish (we'd been before, not just these past two nights) the wood chairs are not the most comfortable, the service was good, the decor - I like the photos. Didn't care for the fluorescent green paint in the hallway to the restroom!", "author": "Lia H."}

They were so accommodating to decorate the back room they reserved for 20 plus people I bought in so beautifully with flowers, special white table cloth and silverware.  Hospitality throughout the event was so great too! Two-Three servers were constantly there to serve us with food and drinks, and not to mention, all the food were so tasty!!! (I'm a sucker for thai food and went pretty much all the well-known ones in the city, but this one is especially my favorite!!!) All the appetizers were excellent! Crispy Calamari is def one of my fav.  All the entrees were so good too! My personal fav are Ginger Stir-Fry and of course Pad Seew! My friends were raving about Emerald Fried Rice too! Overall, any food we had, we were so pleased :) We brought in our own cake but they didn't charge us for it! The owner Jin is such a nice woman and she made sure that the day was gonna go hassle-free, and yes, it was the best experience ever!  I highly recommend this place for casual dinner get together to birthday party or even a budgeted wedding reception like I did! The ambiance of the restaurant is so nice that I'd guarantee you'll love this place as soon as you'll walk in! Highly Recommended!!!!", "author": "Cake T."}
