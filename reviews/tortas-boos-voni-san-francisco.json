{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-08-12", "description": "Man has this place gone downhill since I was there last, 6 yrs ago. The service was T E R R I B L E. The torta was SUCH a waste of time and calories. I'm going to outline my thoughts on this place divided between service and food so if you don't care about one of those categories, you can read accordingly\n\nSERVICE:\n\nSome of the worst I've had. We were made to wait to order our food while the cashier ladled salsa into plastic cups and fastened them with lids. When she finally decided to come take the order of THE ONLY customers in the building, she was rude and seemed bothered by us. More on why that was in the food section. We sat down and another customer came in. He asked her what she recommended and she put a menu in front of him and walked away! After he ordered she said \"to go, right?\" and he responded \"um no I'll eat here\" and she basically rolled her eyes. About 5 mins later my dining companion received his tacos. 5 mins later the other customer received his torta. 15 minutes later, my companion was done eating his tacos even tho he was trying to eat at a snail's pace and I still had not received my food. He heard one of the cooks say in Spanish \"did this go out? The pierna torta?\" Because the cashier was so lame and unconcerned with her job, the cook's inquiry went unanswered, unbeknownst to us. About 15 mins later we were gathering our things to get up and demand a refund and leave, when the cashier all of the sudden ran to the back and came out with a torta bun in her dirty bare hands and handed it to the cooks. They had JUST begun making my food. We had been there almost an hour at this point- the other customer was long gone. We were the only people in the shop. No apology, no explanation, just a skimpy, crappy torta on a dirty bun finally tossed in front of me. And there's no way that was Pierna but I wasn't going to complain and wait longer and receive more attitude and potentially unsafe food. \n\nFOOD:\nHow on earth can you call your restaurant \"Tortas-[anything]\" when you have such a limited torta menu? The special of the day was Barbacoa tacos so my dining companion asked for a Barbacoa torta. The girl working at the register responded (her actual words) \"uhh barbacoa TORTA?! What do you mean barbacoa TORTA?!\" So he replied, \"a torta with barbacoa\". We were then told that was impossible, that they only make barbacoa tacos, so he asked if they could just use the meat from the tacos for a torta and she said absolutely not. So he ordered two tacos, which I knew meant he was annoyed because normally he would order like six tacos. I ordered a pierna torta. The barbacoa tacos came to the table and were excellent. The meat was tender, flavorful and juicy. The tortillas tasted homemade. There was one paper thin slice of avocado in each taco and a small sprinkling of onions. If this place had better service, they would be well worth the $3.50 per taco price tag, in spite of the skimpy accoutrements. The torta was terrible. They either made my order wrong or do not know how to make pierna but I didn't ask because I received my food 30 minutes after the other person in my party of two had finished his meal. The tortas are entirely bread. It's seriously 4 inches of bread with 1/8 inch of fillings. Each half of the torta had one paper thin slice of avocado, it was a total joke. The meat was terrible and appeared to just be deli sliced ham. There was nothing else distinguishable in the sandwich because everything was so skimpy. Maybe a teaspoon of beans spread over the bread? It was like they used an aerosol can to apply it. \n\nSo pick up barbacoa tacos to go but never come here for dine in and never get a torta. Eat the barbacoa at your own risk because they are not following food safety rules. But it might be worth it for the barbacoa because it is actually really good. \n\nI'll never be back.", "author": "Emma H."}

We saw a lot of people come pick up orders, so it seems like takeout is popular here. My friend ordered one of their vegetarian tortas, while I went with #7 ham omelette with beans and potatoes ($9.75).\n\nIt took a while for our food to be ready, probably because of all the takeout orders. After waiting for close to 30 minutes, our food finally came out. I didn't realize the breakfast plates would come with tortillas, but I rolled with it and made breakfast tacos with omelette pieces topped with beans and potatoes. Yum! Unfortunately there was a lot of bell peppers added to the omelette which I ended up picking out, but I'm used to that as a pretty picky eater.\n\nMy least favorite part of the platter was the potatoes, which were extremely bland. My friend really enjoys potatoes, and even he agreed these weren't good. Disappointing since they looked quite spiced up and yummy.\n\nMy friend absolutely loved his torta and even said it's the best he's ever had, so I would definitely recommend getting that here.\n\nParking was a bit hard to find as it is all street parking.

The restaurant is small so we usually just pick it up and go home since they can be crowded around dinner time on weeknights or lunch time on weekends. \n\nThe sandwiches are all about $10, but are DEFINITELY large enough to make two meals out of.

Practically in Daly City, it's pretty much a place I will go out of my way to visit, since I'm no longer in the neighborhood. They don't have many vegetarian options, and I doubt anything is vegan, but I'm willing to forgive them for accidentally putting a piece of salchicha in my torta de huevo because the rest of it (I ate around the sausage) was so good. It hits every spot the way no one else can. The bread is perfectly toasted to stay 80% soft, the mayo/cream combo reminds me of San Julian, and the queso is as fresco as possible. So simple, so good, and easy to mess up, make no this place a gem. I genuinely wish I could finish the entire thing in one sitting sometimes, but also glad I can't (because it lasts longer).\nFor an average price of $10 with tax per dish, this is not a bad way to go.", "author": "Astrid V."}

But no, it's Boos Voni.  Located right off of Geneva and Mission, next to Bank of America.  \n\nWalking in Boos Voni, it reminded me of an old diner with about four booths and a bunch of stools in front at the counter.  Quite an extensive list of tortas to choose from, about 30 tortas total.  Along with a few breakfast items and other options but it's obvious this is a torta spot.  \n\nMany people rave about Torta Cubanas because of its sheer size and combination of ingredients.  Too me the many flavors get lost in the mix and leave me feeling full, guilty, sleepy, and farting mess.  Much better to me are the simple tortas like Milanesa de Pollo.  So that's what I ordered:\n\nMilanesa de Pollo:  it's breaded and fried chicken breast.  Along with everything which includes lettuce, tomato, onions, mayo, queso fresco, and jalape\u00f1os.  Not to be overlooked is the fresh salsa verde they serve at Boos Voni, it's delicious.  \n\nThese torta sandwiches sell from $6.50 to $9.00 depending on which one ordered.  I have a big appetite and even I would have preferred to share my torta.  But I was all by myself so I had no choice but to gorge.

For $8.25, I get the grilled steak with salsa, guacamole, jalapeno, grilled onions and crumbled queso (Mexican cheese) in a LARGE Mollette roll. This is one \"huge\" sandwich that I've ever dealt with. All the key ingredients are cooked to perfection.

The eggs were scrambled perfectly with the beautiful blend of peppers onions and tomatoes. The potatoes were seasoned magically add the warm tortillas you have a breakfast out of a Spanish moms kitchen. It tasted like home. My wife had the breaded beef torta. She loved it.

The small space has plenty of seats with about five 4-chair tables and 6 stools at the counter. The women that operate this place are friendly.\n\nNo, the name of the place is not Italian. Boos Voni = \"Bugs Bunny\" (already explained by others). A good example of Spanglish. The menu also includes Sopes (listed on white erasable board) and plates served with rice and beans (listed on papers tacked to wall). Drinks (hot chocolate, juices, aguas frescas, etc.) come in 2 sizes: medium and large cups. There's also a refrigerator that holds bottles and cans of assorted soft drinks.\n\nThis is one of the few places that serves Champurrado (thickened hot chocolate drink). On weekends they have red menudo (beef tripe soup), garnished with shredded cabbage and sliced radish. It's those small details that give this place a special appeal. \n\nLast night I ordered the milanesa de pollo (they also have beef milanesa) plate ($8.50). It was good, 4 thin strips of tender pan fried chicken served with rice, refried beans, and salad (freshly sliced lettuce, onions, radish, and avocado). It comes with handmade tortillas inside a tortilla warmer. The carefully assembled plate looked and tasted delicious.

This torta is the size of a meteor.  If I have to estimate, i'd guess this torta has about 5000 calories.\n\nWhatever, it's not like I'm here for a diet.  This is how I feel about this sandwich.  Sometimes, you get the urge to just eat something big, fat, and clogs your artery.  It's like fried chicken and fast food.  So if you get the urge next time, you should definitely try this out.  \n\nAnyways, all the meat simply meshed together and there's no way to differentiate one flavor from another.  It's not a bad thing, but I will probably go for one type of meat next time to truly taste the specific meat.  I really like how the bread was soft and fluffy that it soaks up alot of the juices.  The avocado was also a plus.  A picture of the Cubana is available in the photo section if you want to see how it looks like.\n\nOverall, this is a good sandwich and it's worth $9.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-07-30", "description": "There are a few schools of thought on the torta.  The primary difference is the bread: telera or bolillo.  With a nod to Tarantino, this choice is as significant as chocoloate vs. vanilla, or The Beatles vs. Elvis.  The choice of bread speaks volumes about the person making it and even more about the person who prefers eating it that way.  The telera skews to excess.  The bolillo is more refined.  \n\nWhen I lived in D.F. I had 4 torta places in my rotation, each for different reasons.  2 were based on geography (1 at work, 1 at home) and the other 2 were based on being the best of their own schools of \"tortalogy.\"\n\nSince moving to SF in 1998, I've learned a few more things about the science of the torta.  Notably, that the burrito is king in NorCal.  Most taquerias put the torta on the menu mostly out of obligation since I'm typically the only person eating one in the restaurant.  But in the places where the torta IS king, the telera is the crown.\n\nTortas Boos Voni wears this crown proudly.  I don't even remember what else is on the menu because I only came here for the Cubana.  And I've got to tell you that it's just exactly like the ones I used to get in Coyoacan.  From the top, it's sporting:\nBread\nMayonnaise\nLettuce\nAvocado\nFried Egg\nHot dogs\nBacon\nHam\nMilanesa (fried beef, like a breaded minute steak)\nOnions\nPickled Jalepe\u00f1os\nMore mayonnaise\nBread\n\nYum, yum, give me some!  All the reviews are true:  The Cubana is huge.  It really is big enough to feed 3 adults.  But if you truly love your tortas, you'll want to save what you don't put down on the first pass for lunch the next day.  Yes, it's missing some standard issue items, like refritos on the bottom slice of bread.  However, this sandwich is absolutely authentic and the ladies that served it up were as nice as can be.  I am definitely a fan of Boos Voni and I can't wait to come back.  It's a hell of feat for a sandwich to transport you 17 years and 2000 miles, but Boos Voni has done it.  With apologies to King Torta in LA, Boos Voni is the real King. \n\nFinal note: I, like most of my high-AQ friends, never did like hot dogs on my torta.  Even in D.F. I asked them to sub in chorizo and I've never received a funny look.  Last night I wanted to have it straight off the menu to give it a fair assessment.

Sometimes we don't share the same love, so he insisted on bringing me to sample some \"grub'n sandwinches!\"  I ordered my sandwich, but unfortunately was sidetracked by a special.  I know this place is known for their tortas, but if something labeled \"special\" it must be good...otherwise it'd not be on the menu.  So he says just order the chile relleno and we can share it--to see if it is in fact special.\n\nSo, i'm smacking my lips thinking of the food.  My torta comes out...boom.  It is savory and delicious and because of the salsa with the chips, my tongue is virtually numb to the jalapenos in  my sandwich.  Fine...the special comes out.  I'm excited.  I get my lil torn corn tortilla, slice a piece off my relleno add some of that salsa, toss in a smidge of beans and rice.  I am chewing and in the midst if my soft cheese and pepper is the 1/4\" end of a toothpick.  I am startled but realize that maybe it's just a tidbit that was slightly overlooked.  Talk about overlooked, I tell the owner and she's like \"Yes, toothpick.\"  She points out there is probably more in the relleno.  Man, don't they normally pull those suckers out!?  I sliced my relleno across, not the along the length...what the hell. I got a piece of it, but there was still 2 toothpicks inside.  I know i'm acting a little butt hurt about this, but no one warned or indicated that there might be toothpicks left inside.  When looking at the dish, it didn't even look indicative that there were toothpicks.  I know they use toothpicks, but come on.  Give a girl a break and warn her next time. \n\nI would have liked the review to be out about the delicious tortas, but I can't stop thinking about the damn toothpicks and her reaction.  She was very nice, but geez.  Not enough to overlook something so potentially dangerous.", "author": "elizabeth c."}

Bugs Bunny!! but WB Sued them and they were forced to change their name to Boo Voni by cleverly disguising their name using the Spanish pronunciation as a cover in which the majority of the customers are unaware that it is named after a WB Cartoon character a flea bitten varmint named Bugs Bunny!!!

Now, at least, I'm a FULLER and FATTER FAT ASS, which is good news for everyone.  I just had a divine torta from Tortas Boos Voni.\n\nThis place is legit.  It's the type of place that I like because when I walk in, there's only Spanish being spoken, and it makes me a little uncomfortable because I feel left out.  But that's why I live in SF, so I sack up and order.  Everyone is polite and friendly.\nThe bread is soft on the inside, crisp on the outside and buttery all over, fully complimenting the panoply of flavors that is this place's torta.  I had half of the Cuban and the Hawaiian and I'd recommend both.  The Cuban had a distinct earthy, meaty flavor, kinda smoky, kinda reminded me of comfort-food sausage.  The Hawaiian has ham and pineapple in it and a crazy kinda sweet cheese.  The salsa verde and roja are delicious and some of the best I've had in San Francisco.\n\nTo sum up, I was hungry and instead of being merely satisfied, I had a blissful experience.  Thank you Tortas Boos Voni.  Maybe someday I will figure out what you're name means.", "author": "Ricky R."}

Why or how is it that someone who claims to be Mexican or be anything Mexican go so long without enjoying one of these little pleasures in life?\n Well, good question with a good answer. You see, I am slightly spoiled when it comes to good tortas, and was afraid to be disappointed with the tortas in this area. I was right, I am disappointed, but only a little. Also, those things are not good for diets, and if I was going to splurge on calories, I wanted it to be worth the weight gain. Why not just throw it away, someone might ask? Well, Mexicans don't throw away food. There are starving children in this world and its a sin to throw it away.\nAnyway, the torta I had wasn't what I was used to but it was good. It was also huge, that I was not used to, so in a way it made up for the flavor. The bread was a bit on the dry side (and it wasn't because it was grilled, it was just dry), and the chili sauce was good, but not great. If they changed those 2 things I would likely gain a lot of weight over the coming year.", "author": "Leticia B."}
