You begin with some cold apps, start going ham on nigiri, and then some hot apps are thrown in. Definitely loved doing omakase because it was comprised of a lot of items that I would have never personally ordered. And when you do omakase, you can always tell the chef what you would rather not have and if there's something you have been craving (which for me was yellowtail :) ). \n\nI compared the experience to Hinata (my most recent omakase experience in the city), and I noticed the flavors on the nigiri were well balanced. I could actually taste the fish, then everything else it was seasoned with. Rather be overwhelmed with wasabi/seasoning. \n\nOmakase is definitely pricey so if you have a budget in mind, I'd voice your concerns before starting your journey.

All served with ICHI's famous Japanese potato salad. \n\nI decided on the Mapo Dog and the Negi-Hama (yellowtail) maki, along with other a la carte items. \n\nMy order:\n\nMapo Dog - This is probably the most interesting hot dog I've ever encountered and oddly enough, it worked. These mini frankfurters were served with traditional house-made minced pork mapo tofu poured on top and sprinkled with sliced scallions and sesame seeds throughout. A fusion I didn't quite understand at first, but the flavors began to meld as I continued eating. Strangely enough, this combination felt surprisingly natural. \n\nYellowtail Maki - Fresh and tasty. No complaints here. \n\nSpicy Tuna Roll - This was delicious. Nice and spicy. You get about 4 pieces. \n\nSpicy Hotate - This scallop was fresh and great. I'm extremely picky about scallops and these came out soft and non-offensive. Perfect. \n\nTheir famous potato salad - This was beautifully homemade and full of American-Japanese flavor. A great medley of fusion ingredients. \n\nLast, but not least, I ordered the Yama Shioyaki, which is fish collar. I asked the server what the chef recommended that day, and he said it would be the Big Eye Snapper because it would be the most flavorful. Not for the squeamish or faint at heart, but if you enjoy fish in its entirety, the Kintokidai Snapper is an absolute beauty. It's served with its head, but when plucking away at its collar, you'll discover some of the softest, moistest, and most luscious bites. \n\nWhat I mostly appreciate is that they served my meal with fresh grated wasabi. Oh yes, I do notice. \n\nRestaurant is small, but really cozy. Service is knowledgeable and incredibly friendly! \n\nI'll happily return, restaurant week or not!", "author": "Ann S."}

The size is ideal to feel like you're getting lots of attention from the sushi chefs, and I love the decor....the blue walls, the art made from uni boxes, etc.\n\nThe first time I went here, I was actually underwhelmed....then I realized we made the mistake of trying to order a la carte and not really understanding anything.  You MUST do omakase when you come here.  There's no minimum or maximum, so you can make it as affordable as you want.\n\nWe usually do between 10-12 pieces per person, plus two a la carte appetizers, and leave feeling very satisfied....and we normally pay about what you would for a set omakase menu at other spots (about $95/person).  All of the sushi chefs are incredibly nice and - unlike other places - are open to avoiding things you know you don't like (raw shrimp) or incorporating things you love (uni).  The fish has always tasted very fresh to me.  The rice has always been lightly sticky and lightly vinegar'd.  And I love the creative preparations.

Since I last dined there, the chef has had a health scare and has unfortunately downsized the restaurant and moved it into its smaller original space. \n\nNevertheless, when I last visited, it was for omakase, which should still apply to Ichi's current venue and reincarnation. I found it to be a much better experience than its currently middling Yelp rating would imply. \n\nOne caveat with the omakase, though: it's not a prix fixe affair, but one where you run up a potentially unlimited tab until you're full. That having been said, for the 16-18 pieces of nigiri sushi and other small dishes that I got, I felt the whole experience was of good quality and value. \n\nSeared or specially seasoned items were especially yummy, whether a seared piece of medai (Japanese butterfish) with sake soy reduction and its skin left on, a nicely glazed piece of shima aji (striped jack), a serving of Hokkaido hotategai (scallop) with green tea salted yuzu, or a beautifully seared and prepared piece of engawa (fluke fin / flounder's edge). \n\nAnother highlight was the Canadian botan ebi (spot prawn) which was presented live, and then (sadly) prepared super-fresh - that is, slaughtered on the spot. It did indeed taste incredibly fresh, with the remainder of the shrimp (its head) then served fried. \n\nOverall, the omakase was quite a satisfying, value-friendly experience where you get to try lots of different pieces of fish, and where you get to see the sushi chef's skills up close and personal. While Ichi might not have the hype of a Michelin star, it's still an enjoyable, high-quality experience.", "author": "Vincent L."}

To start, I ordered the chef's choice sashimi plate- the fish was definitely below average quality, at a way above average price price. I was going to get the miso clam dish next, but I was so turned off my the hostess' attitude and the poor quality fish, I just cancelled the rest of my order, got my check and left. $35 later, I have a couple pieces of questionable fish in my belly and a bad taste in my mouth.

Fortunately 5 minutes away ways Coco's, Fumi Japanese Curry, and a number of other great spots. But before I could get there I saw ICHI Sushi and even though I had sushi plans for dinner I saw hot dogs on the menu and I hadn't had a good dog in a while.\n\nThough Yelp and the sign said they close at 2, the great server Laura waved me in. There were a few groups finishing up their late lunch so I had choice of wherever and decided on a table as the sushi bar was pretty empty. Later I saw why - the chef in the back corner was prepping the fish for dinner, cutting some, seasoning others. They looked great!\n\nThe lunch menu is a bit limited - the hot dogs, some basic maki rolls, some salads. Actually they have more drink options for lunch than food options. I went with the Japanese Dog, a Negi-Hama roll, and a glass of cold sake.\n\n-Negi-Hama: your basic hamachi and scallion roll.

He stated he'd dress all of our fish for us and no soy sauce would be given. Each piece of fish he laid in front of us he explained in detail (its name, where it was from, sauce he used and preparation). The chef used very unique toppings/sauces I haven't seen at other sushi bars like: green tea salt, preserved pepper paste, Myer lemon salt, a myer lemon compote and a sake and soy reduction. Possibly all made in house? Well for sure the myer lemon ones were in house cause the chef said he had a myer lemon tree and brings the lemons to work to use. Very sustainable if you ask me.\n\nCan't comment much on service since we sat at the bar and didn't really order any kitchen items.

Its raw seafood is the most popular of all the palatable dishes.  My love for sushi never ends; therefore, I go to any sushi bars and try different kinds of fin fish and shellfish coming from the Tsukiji Market of Japan.  After many attempts, anything straight from the special menu is a hit and miss.  If there's any fish I haven't come across, I take it right away.\n\nLast Thursday evening was a perfect moment at ICHI Sushi to try a pair of nigiri one last time.  I'm glad walk-ins are acceptable.  Plus, I get to sit where the sushi chefs are.  My first pair: kelp cured fluke of Busan, Korea.  No soy sauce needed; a little hint of lemon juice with less wasabi; taste good enough.  My second pair: blue shrimp of Caledonia.  But where are its respective fried shrimp heads?  That sushi chef with moustache and glasses said no heads.  Good grief!  I once tried shrimp heads that are fried and I love it.  Before I put the whole raw shrimp into my mouth, I asked the same sushi chef about the shrimp tail, and he said no tail.  Then, he take back the pair of shrimps and chopped off the shrimp tails, and give it back to me.  What on earth!?  Is that how he taught me!?  Headless, tailless; it's like there's no beginning, no end!  Reminds me that I'm missing something, which is why my mom tried to tell me to \"have head have tail\".  Anyways, time for a taste.  There's some of the soy sauce in the shrimp with a some presence of wasabi.  Done!\n\nI came to ICHI Sushi bar for one good reason, sushi etiquette.  In one of the yelpers' photos, I've seen how they eat nigiri the right way, so I followed their example.  At first I came to have a seat, given a lotus leaf with some thin slices of ginger.

My friends got the omakase, which I tried bites of. To be honest, the fish and the rice were a bit on the dry side. He felt the same and said the omakase has been better.

We liked the cucumber!), and hot (salmon broth, fish). Of the sushi, our faves were the yellowtail, katsuo skipjack, ocean trout inidashi, and uni.\n\nRAW\n* Medai Tataki (pork chicharron, ponzu vinaigrette, shichimi. $12 for 2pc) - 4 stars\nLess pork than I though, mostly some sprinkled crunchy pieces of chicharron, but still great combination of flavors. The fish had a good texture.\n\nSKEWERS\n* Momo Yakitori (chicken thigh, tare. $4 one skewer) - 5 stars\nAmazing. Juicy, full of flavor. Use the extra spices they sprinkle on the plate, and drizzle the meyer lemon. I usually don't like to drizzle lemons, but theirs are so juicy & sweet, I was able to even eat a slice. \n\nHOT\n* Miso Asari Clams (pork, miso broth, kuro oil. $11) - 4.5 stars\nSo delicious! Before we even tasted it, we could smell all the spices. I thought it was sesame oil that made it smell so good, but whatever that kurt oil is made it amazing! It also had a kick of spice that we loved. This was a broth but it was very filling. The clams were little bursts of juicy meat. I only wish there was a little more pork and it wasn't ground so small. The spoon you get is really thick and makes it very difficult to scoop up all the pork!\n\nDESSERT\n* Granita ($7) - 3 stars\nThe only dessert option of the night.

This is my only negative one. \n\nMy realtor and friend were celebrating my new home so the I was not personally concerned about the cost, just to set the precedence that the price point is not a preempting factor. \n\nI was quite intrigued by the sushi selection as it was a variety that was not typical of my extensive mid to upper grade sushi experience. \n\nNigiri sushi si $4-7 per piece. That means $8-14 per normal 2 piece serving. \n\nIn lieu of hot sake (which is ok for upscale sushi establishment), I opted for a delightful rose'\n\nSake was average of 13 per glass/ 70+ per bottle. \n\nThe restaurant took pride in cultivating the culinary taste of a variety of flavor with the fish. \n\nI can understand respecting a chef's pairing of flavors with taste.\n\nHOWEVER, DO NOT ASK FOR SOY SAUCE, let alone wasabi. \n\nThe staff will fight you and take you down. \n\nWe made the cardinal sin of asking for soy sauce and wasabi. \n\nI am still stunned at the resistance I received at the request.\n\nLaura did her best to explain that the chef took great care in selecting the flavors to not over power the fish. That was their \"thing.\" \n\nWhen we persisted to request soy sauce and wasabi, she deferred to our server. \n\nWe asked our server Amanda who again explained the chef's intentions. \n\nAt the price point charged and tasting the sushi we pointed out that we respected the chef's intentions, but for our taste we preferred some soy sauce and wasabi. \n\nI finally had to get firm and ask whether they wanted to compromise our enjoyment of the expensive sushi for the sake of the chef's creative vision and insisted that I was the customer paying for my meal. \n\nAmanda finally complied by \"slamming\" down 2 dishes, soy sauce and wasabi in a way I have NEVER experienced before. \n\nNot only are we paying upper end prices, we are experiencing elitist service. \n\nAt that point the celebration took a sour turn. \n\nI tasted each piece with and without the soy sauce and wasabi. I really enjoyed how the chef added the additional unique flavors. However, I am sorry, it was immensely complimented with a little soy and wasabi.\n\nWe had more sushi coming. \n\nLaura was able to rise above and move forward with a positive attitude that significantly helped to shift an uncomfortable experience to one that ended on a decent note. \n\nAmanda had lost me. It wasn't until the end of our meal and time for the tip that her attitude had changed. \n\nThe bill before tax was $188 for 2 people. The sushi flavor was fun, but NOT worth the fight.\n\nI don't know what my friend/realtor tipped, but the experience was soured enough that I will NEVER go there again. \n\nI graciously give them the 3 star rating for the freshness of the fish and creativeness of the flavor along with the intimate ambiance.

Most sushi places, do state on the menus or comes with a fixed price on your bill. Even though each dish came out flavorful and fresh, had we known about it not being fixed priced or that we were being charged for each individual dish we wouldn't have allowed them to bring out all 15 courses. Our server was good on asking us about food allergies, and how the Omakase works (they keep bringing out the dishes unless you say done) but we wish she let us know that your charged per dish/sushi and not fixed. More of a cost background would have helped (left the important part out!). We had also had made reservations and requested bar seating but didn't get to sit at the bar.

The restaurant itself is beautiful, with clean & modern furnishings. They also have a high top sushi bar that you can eat at. We were able to make reservations at the last minute as well which was very convenient! \n\nSince we've heard so many great things about ICHI, our expectations were a little high. Unfortunately they were a little let down which is why I gave 3 stars. The service was pretty slow. We felt like we had to keep waving down our server to put in our order, ask for water, ask for our check, etc.\n\nThey had a nice selection of sake, so we ordered the Dassai which was smooth, clean, & floral. However, we were bummed out because it was served to us in water glasses. This is the first time I've been served sake this way. Normally we get the beautiful flask and small ceramic sake cups which is half of the fun!\n\nROLLS: We shared the Spicy Tuna and California rolls. They were simply good. Nothing out of the ordinary. Each roll contained 6 pieces and portion size was average. \n\nSKEWERS: The Momo Yakitori was grilled perfectly and served with a light sauce. This was probably my favorite bite. My friend said her Butabara Kushiyaki (pork belly) was also tasty and well seasoned.\n\nNIGIRI: My friend had the Salmon Roe but said it \"tasted funny.\" Not sure what that really meant and I didn't want to try it after her comment. I had the Albacore Tuna which was tender and had a light sauce. I thought it was very good. The Wagyu Beef was a little dry though.\n\nAll in all, this place was good, but not outstanding. In my opinion, I think Pabu is better but I'm at least glad I got to try ICHI Sushi + Ni.", "author": "Chisholm T."}

And service was impeccable.\n\nRather than reviewing each piece of food, though I could easily do that from memory, I'll highlight some revelatory moments for me. I will be interested to read other diners' highlights from their visits to ICHI as I am sure there are many more than what I list here:\n\n1. Nigiri: A large mural on the wall highlights some important points for sushi beginners (and even veterans like me) to know - it's ok to pick it up with your hand, eat it in one bite, do not dunk it in wasabi soy sauce. \n\nAll the fish was super fresh, and the origins are listed on the menu. My wife has lived near the water for much of her adult life, but has always been wary of raw fish. Until last night.\n\nThe unsung hero of nigiri, the rice, was spot on, fresh and just the right flavor and texture for sushi rice.\n\n2. Service: Our server knew expertly what each piece of sushi and each dish was, how it was seasoned, and where the fish came from. Same for the drinks. She (as well as the support staff) were somehow always there but not there, if you know what I mean.\n\n3. Clams and uni (sea urchin) and eggplant: I have never been a fan of any of these foods, but since everything was so good I decided to get back into the game with all of them and was so glad I did. If you've ever had a bad experience with them, ICHI will redeem them for you. \n\n4. Shochu: is a Japanese distilled spirit, usually about 50 proof, which makes it somewhere between sake and whiskey in alcohol and flavor. Although Japanese whiskies are all the rage these days, shochu is the national spirit of Japan. ICHI offered two: Iichiko -- clear and fermented from barley -- and Kakushigura -- which is lightly aged in oak and has a slight tint therefore. I had one of each as well as a shochu cocktail. And will be heading to my local liquor store to pick some up to keep in the home bar.\n\nI could say more, but you get the point. If you live in San Francisco (like my sisters), lucky you. If you are visiting San Francisco (like me, an ex-pat), do yourself a favor and check out ICHI.", "author": "David Y."}

I don't know, maybe.\n\nICHI Sushi is a clever, swanky, pop culture-forward sushi bar on Mission near Bernal.  It's a fun, hopping spot.  The fish is fresh, but should the words \"omakase\" pass your lips, prepare to fork over major cash for the pleasure of the chef's choice.  Be prepared too that this popular spot may be running out of lots of items if you arrive after 8 pm, as it gets busy here, even early in the week.\n\nICHI highlights for us on an energetic late Monday night, included a wait for a seat even at 9 pm, but fortunately we were sipping a terrific Henhouse Saison at the roomy back bar.  Soon, we were seated in the front sushi bar.\n\nWe were steered towards the Okonomiyaki (japanese pancake) and it was the best I can remember eating in the U.S.  Really delicious.  \n\nWe read on Yelp that this place was a value, but of coarse omakase is the exception to that rule.  It is, the chef's assessment of the best in the house. We doubled down on experience over value and the nigiri that arrived was good and fresh, with wasabi and soy (and in some cases shiso added), already applied at arrival. You are not given any soy sauce, since all the heavy lifting (i.e. application of soy) has been done for you. Its a near perfect application. Admittedly, I'm now left wishing this was the standard everywhere. I felt truly spoiled. Signage on the walls reminds you that nigiri is to be eaten with your hands. Music to my ears. The sushi chef announced a lot of items were \"Japanese\" as in Japanese snapper etc. which I'm assuming means its frozen and flown in?  \n\nA very enjoyable experience, but expensive. If you are used to paying about $100 a person for a good omakase, then (gulp) you will not be disappointed.

Didn't really have a great first impression because the layout of the restaurant is actually a maze. if you're sitting towards the front of the restaurant, you can only get out one way, and the tables are too close together to walk through. Figuring out how to get the bathroom also required a double take.\n\nThere are a ton of options available on the menu. Many people recommend the omakase on Yelp, but we were told it would be in the $90+ range. Instead, we opted to try a few of their more izakaya style dishes.\n\nMiso Asari Clams: A salty mixed miso soup with clams. It was very oily but delicious.\n\nThen, some nigiri. We got the Maguro Zuke, Saba, and Shiro Toro. I didn't like the large amount of wasabi they put on these, since they used fake wasabi. The maguro zuke had very little flavor, and literally tasted like nothing. The other two were a bit more flavourful, but definitely not worth the $3.5-4 per piece price. We were pretty disappointed by the quality of the fish.\n\nWe then got momo yakitori, which is chicken thigh. The meat was very tender and juicy, making us want to order another skewer. We chose the buta katu niku kushiyaki, which was pork shoulder. Also amazingly juicy and delicious. A single skewer was only $3.50 each, making it the best value to price ratio on the whole menu. I'm surprised no one is talking about these skewer dishes at all.\n\nWe also tried the kampachi kama, which is amberjack fish collar, the best part of a fish. Very delicious and more filling than most items on the menu. This was $12 and great for sharing. \n\nWe were not full after finishing all the dishes I named above, but had already spent ~$30 each so decided to call it. \n\nThe service was friendly overall, the interior is very modern and clean, although the layout really bothered me.

They're both outstanding, and Ichi is nearly as good as Nakazawa for a fraction of the price. The omakase is simply stunning, with amazingly delicate and complex dustings of shiso, many kinds of pepper, wasabi, and even salt among the many pieces. Of course the fish is superb.

Until they stop trying to over-control my dining experience, I'm never going back.\n\nPros: The drinks were great (excellent sake recommendations from the waitress), and the yakitori, nigiri, and rolls were delicious.\n\nCons: I can't stand how they're so stringent about waiting for all party members to be present before being seated. The first time I came here was when the restaurant first opened. I had a reservation for 2. I was 7.5 months pregnant and asked to be seated, and they wouldn't seat me because my friend was late. Did I say I was 7.5 months pregnant? After several firm requests they finally seated me. Geez. I got better treatment on the BART. Fast forward to my second visit earlier this week, and they were still stringent about the \"everyone must be present\" rule. It was a Monday night and there were at least 6 tables open. Finally, they gave in and seated us when 3 of the 4 of us were present. Ugh. But that's not the worst.\n\nThe worst is their absolute control over soy sauce. I understand that the sushi is already pre-seasoned and doesn't need it - fine. But my friend ordered rice with soy sauce. They served it first, and when the sushi came out, they TOOK THE DISH OF SOY SAUCE AWAY so she \"wouldn't be tempted.\" Is this elementary school? Is this the USSR? Are we in a lab? It's shocking to what degree they went to control the dining experience. It just ruined the whole thing for me. My toddler has more freedom at her daycare.", "author": "Cali K."}

With SFRW deals, my friend and I decided to give this place a shot. We were actually kind of dumb and ended up not opting out of the discovery menu (where 1/3rd of the price is for drinks, and we didn't feel like drinking tonight, so not a viable option) and got the omakase instead. Omakase or go home yo. \n\nThe place has some pretty sick artwork when you first walk in and is actually super popping. You typically expect Japanese restaurants to be quiet, calm, and serene... but this one is loud. Loud af actually. Don't go here if you want a super romantic date/are with someone who talks quietly. It's loud.\n\nAnyways, this omakase is apparently more traditional than others. I didn't realize that rather than having a set budget, they just feed you until you're good. You can see my attached pictures, but basically we got two giant nigiri plates, which is what Ichi specializes in. I think we tried an total of maybe about 12-13 different nigiris? Yum yum. Every cut of fish was the perfect size--not a super generous fat chunk of fish, but a really nicely refined cut. \n\nSome highs and lows. High was definitely the ocean trout in both nigiri and cooked form. Who knew trout could be so good?!?! The nigiri form was definitely my favorite piece of the night--there was a nice flowery flavor that made the flavor really pop as well as a nice citrusy tang--would definitely recommend asking for more cuts of ocean trout if you're here! Ocean trout in soup form was also super spot on--radishes were a great blast of flavor. Low was the ikura.. Pretty sure it was sake soaked? I guess if you like sake or are already drinking it with your meal then you'll like it, but I'm not a fan and oh god it was so hard to finish. Not a fan at all. \n\nBeyond those comments though, I thought the experience was solid but not amazing. I felt that while the nigiri slices were great... sometimes the wasabi really overpowered the flavor of the fish so it was hard to enjoy it. Another common problem with their mackerel is that they like to serve it with ginger, but again, the ginger overpowers the flavors. I liked the subtler flavors--we had a scallop nigiri that had green tea salt on it which was really subtle but interesting. All in all, the fish cuts you're getting are definitely fresh and worth the money, so I think it's worth the money. Final bill per person after tip came out to be about $89. \n\ntldr; solid sushi; nothing mind blowing but pretty good nonetheless. place is really loud though", "author": "Jasmine X."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-07", "description": "The word of the day is: overrated. The fish is undeniably of exquisite quality, but it is prepared with HASTE and INATTENTIVE culinary practices that will leave the dinner wanting more after parting with 100-200 dollars, even if dining simply as a duo or a trio. At prices most restaurants would be proud to charge for two pieces of nigiri, ICHI demands 5-7 dollars PER PIECE. This is a WILD ride above market prices, netting the restaurant some 5-15X profits per pound of fish! \n\nI have been making my own fresh, sustainable sushi for the better part of the past decade and I can tell you that ICHI gouges its diners. It is quite unfortunate that I had to find this out the hard way. \n\nUnfortunately again, their rice is incredibly dry and was served quite cold underneath fish which was otherwise well-prepared. Their maki likewise left much to be desired, with flavors drowned by cheap ginger and pale wasabi. \n\nI would not review any restaurant poorly if it had not come in so far under par with prices so far above par. It is the DIFFERENTIAL that demands this low rating, and I promise you it was earned. With challenging reservations and inattentive staff who will over-sell you on everything, it's a wonder this place attracts any return diners. Perhaps sitting at the bar would net slightly better service and warmer rice with more moisture and flavor to complement the fish... but I will not be returning to find out. \n\nTL;DR: \n\nDry, flavorless rice + talked-up fish that's definitely pretty great but WAYYY overpriced. Go somewhere like Saru or prepare to drop $$ on real Omakase somewhere else if you're a true sushi fan. This place attracts trend-chasers, nothing more. :/", "author": "Noah K."}

ICHI, however, failed my expectations, both foodwise as well as the general attitude of both the sushi chefs and staff.

Upon requesting him for our orders, he often replied with short replies like \"how many?\" \"What? Tell me how many?\", all the while engaging with other patrons in a friendly fashion. Perhaps I irritated him with my politeness, or my choice of sushi.  I don't know.  Bottom line - maybe the food is good, it's not great, but it's no Saru or Maruya.

Is it because it's hipster and not exactly what you'd find in Tokyo?  Please people, relax!\n\nI went through a sushi craving to the point where I started perusing high end sushi experiences, and saw that ICHI has been getting a lot of press (for starters, 7x7 features them on the 100 things to eat list).  We made a reservation for a Friday night at 9:15pm and when we showed up, this place was PACKED! Sitting at the sushi bar was an absolute must for me, but unfortunately that meant we had to wait 30 minutes to be seated.  I'm not sure why or how that makes sense, and if it weren't for the fact that the sushi was amazeballs, I'd probably have more complaints about the fact that I didn't receive a single piece of food until 10pm, or 45 minutes after my reservation. Ok, moving on.\n\nSo, if you're going to remember anything from this, it's that you MUST order the omakase.  Not to be a snob, but for the people who sat next to me who ordered the two orders of the California Roll, why did you waste your time coming here? We went about 17 pieces deep, and threw in the chicken wings and fried fish collar from the hot food item list.  It was definitely an aggressive night, but hey, my LA Kings won the Stanley Cup that night and I was going to celebrate.\n\nHighlights from the omakase included the hirame with chili and green onion, the saba with the egg yolk vinagrette and fried leeks, the barracuda, and the super sweet hotategai (giant scallop).  The tamago ended the evening, and while it wasn't warm, it was definitely quality.  The excellent quality of the fish here is what really blew both of us away.  The rice wasn't overly salty, and our sushi chef graciously put the shoyu or additional sauce on for us, so we never needed anything else. Dinner came out reasonably priced, including the hot food and some beers.  Something \"strange\" that we noticed was that we were charged per piece, not as a general \"omakase\" pricing.  Either way, ICHI sushi was definitely a great experience and while their sushi isn't what you'd find in the traditional sense, their quality of fish is absolutely on point.", "author": "Lisa I."}

I know, I'm horrible. \n\nHaving been to Ichi at their former location a block away and loved it (my review: http://bit.ly/1bP7qPR), I was ecstatic to check out their new location (across from Pizza Hacker) that opened on Tuesday. The new space is about three times larger AND they now offer a izakaya (Japanese tapas) menu.\n\nWhile they now accept reservations on OpenTable, I hate their reservation policy. Not only do they require a credit card to secure reservations (with possible cancellation fees), I received ZERO dining points. WTF. Additionally, I made reservations for Wednesday at 5:30 pm and requested sushi bar seats. When calling to confirm my reservations, I was told that sushi bar seats are first come, first serve regardless of whether or not you have reservations. Hmmmm, this defeats the purpose of making reservations no? I hope they consider changing this but until then my rating is rounded down because of this. \n\nTo secure sushi bar seats, we waited in line 15 minutes before they opened at 5:30 pm. Do come early because all the sushi bar seats were taken before 6 pm. Beware of line cutters, people. This fobby Azn couple thought it was perfectly OK to chain smoke in front of the restaurant and blow the smoke toward bystanders, then cut everyone else in line when the doors opened. Grrrrr....\n\nOne important thing to note is that you can only order from the full menu (sushi & izakaya) if you sit at the sushi bar side. If you sit at the izakaya bar side, you can only order from the izakaya menu (no sushi).  \n\nCompared to other izakaya restaurants, the izakaya menu is very small and focused with about 10 things on the menu: 5 cold dishes and 5 hot dishes. An absolute must order is the Motsuni ($9.75): http://bit.ly/1d5wtci. The English cut short ribs and beef tripe were incredibly tender and the sauce was full of robust umami flavor. A total Japanese comfort dish.\n\nSeeing how much I enjoyed the Omakase at Ichi's previous location, we requested a Nigiri Only Omakase which will range in price depending on how many pieces you order. We each had 14 pieces (including oysters) which was about $65 per person which was reasonable. What I appreciated (while some may not) is Ichi doesn't provide soy sauce or wasabi and the sushi chefs will explain every fish being presented.  The sushi chef (we sat in front of Darin/Darren) will season the pristine cuts of fish with various accoutrements like green tea sea salt, ponzu, garlic oil, etc that will best highlight that particular variety of fish. Why ruin a beautiful cut of fish by dunking into a pool of soy sauce? The shari (rice) was perfect; seasoned well and didn't fall apart upon picking up. If you're like Mr. NSS who is chopstick challenged, it's perfectly fine to pick up the sushi with your hands to eat. \n\nLike a good sushi chef would do, Darin/Darren started the omakase with a variety of firm, white fish selections and then progressed to a more fattier cut like umi masu (ocean trout). Their umi masu was so AMAZINGGGGGGG that we ordered two orders: http://bit.ly/1oWLFkj. If you like sake (salmon) and/or toro (belly), this is a must order as it was like a triple cream butter that just melts effortlessly in your mouth. \n\nHere are pics of our omakase sets: http://bit.ly/1l2hCaC and http://bit.ly/1cuwN7t. \n\nIchi's omakase ranks among my top 5 places for omakase along with Akiko, Ino, Yume (Alameda), and Sushi Sam's (San Mateo). \n\nA tiny drawback is Ichi doesn't serve ankimo,  blue fin otoro, or unagi because they're not sustainable. I can appreciate that but I since foie gras was banned, ankimo is the only way I can get some type of fix. \n\nExpect to spend about 2 hours if you partake in omakase and also because they're crazy busy...even on a Wednesday. \n\nWhile I do like their new, hip location playing hip hop in the background, I found the sushi bar seats were so close to each other that we were rubbing elbows with our neighbors. It would have been nice if there were hooks underneath the bar for coats and purses. \n\nI'm usually adamant about only going to Japanese owned and ran sushi joints but Ichi is the exception. While the sushi chefs may be white boys, they do sushi ohh soooo right.\n\nShout-out to several parents who brought their kids to the sushi bar with them. Not only were they super well-behaved, they seemed to have enjoyed eating sashimi and nigiri. Love that they're such adventurous eaters at a young age. \n\nMe: \"If we have kids in the future, we can bring them with us for omakase.\"\nMr. NSS: \"Sure..under one condition?\"\n\nMe: \"Ok....?\"\nMr. NSS: \"You can foot the $500+ bill.\" *Evil laugh*\n\nMe: \"On a second thought, maybe bento boxes are a better idea....\"", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Think gastropub/northwest decor complete with large signs on the walls and art with a bar feel.\n\nWhat I had: Strictly Omakase Nigiri/Sashimi+ Some Apps\n\nWhat I didn't have: Did not order any of the hot food or California type rolls.\n\nValue: I would say fair, not over priced for what they serve, but it ain't cheap either. I find myself capable of pricing sushi for what they are worth and found it to be right on the mark.\n\nWould I tell my friends: Yes for beginners and novice folks. Good for first dates. But I would throw some caution to purists alike.\n\nWould I come back: For Omakase, no. I would however return with friends to try the other choices on the menu. It had a good selection of cooked food that would like to get to sometime soon.\n\nLast thoughts: I'm generally a long time fan of non traditional sushi, the Morimoto inspired era. I am not against trying out new flavors and even citrus pairings and such. However lately as I'm getting older I am finding traditional or Edome style sushi best. Although I enjoyed the sushi very much, there are others I enjoy more around SF. Next time I return I'll stick to the basics like maguro and mackerel nigiri, and add some California type rolls in there along with non sushi offerings they serve. Spicy tuna and spider maki comes to mind. I really do enjoy this place, although reading my review may not seem like I do. I just did not find all the extra added flavors and toppings on a simple piece of fish and rice necessary. I enjoy my sushi clean and simple. I find there is always room for these types of places in cities that take sushi seriously. A really good spot in a city of plenty, they had me at the rice preparation alone. Something that the majority of bad sushi places just don't know how to prepare.tf", "author": "Juan G."}

Perhaps if I were to try their omakase I would be more favorably impressed, but having tried other omakase in the city such as Pabu, Kusakabe, Zushi Puzzle and more, I can't see myself shelling out money for ICHI. \n\nMy friend and I happened to get in during happy hour time, so we each got the chirashi with uni and then split some nigiri and a roll with ocean trout. I think my favorite was probably the ocean trout roll, which was fresh and flavorful. The chirashi had good sashimi, tamago, cucumber, and the rice was properly cooked. I was mostly disappointed by the nigiri, my wagyu was overseared and I wasn't impressed by the flavor, and the nigiri pieces were incredibly small. I appreciated that they seasoned and customized all of the pieces, but I didn't find the quality to be on par with the price, especially compared to other amazing sushi places in the city. \n\nIt's a chic, trendy atmosphere, but unfortunately I wouldn't go back for more sushi.", "author": "Kate M."}

It's the service that seems to be absent minded at this new location.\n\nWe got to the restaurant at 5:40pm for our 5:45pm reservation. Instead of walking straight in, we opened the door and there was a huge line waiting. We thought it was people who were waiting in line without reservations, until the party in front of us said they also had reservations. I don't know why it took so long to check everyone in. We asked for a seat at the bar. Nope, only 1 seat available.\n\nIt took forever for them to take our order. It took forever for us to get our order. We ordered 11 pieces of nigiri - it's fine that they gave it to us a few at a time. But when the first plate came to our table, only half of the nigiri came. As in, they gave us one piece of 4 different fish we ordered first. So we got this awkward plate, and it was embarassing because it looked like we were being cheap, by sharing nigiri or something. We told the waitress, she said the rest of the order would be out shortly. I checked the menu to see if each order includes 1 or 2 pieces, thinking it we forgot to order 2 pieces. Nope, the menu says 2 pieces per order. Huh. It ended up taking about 15 mins to get the rest of our 4 pieces of nigiri....\n\nIt was taking a while and we decided to order some Cold Somen with Shiso. We summoned one of the workers, who said \"I'll get you your waitress so she can order it for you.\" Being that it took 5 mins already to get someone's attention, we were getting irritated. How hard is it to put in an order for us? What made me upset was that they were checking in on all the tables. The table before us, they asked if they wanted another beer. But they couldn't ask us if we'd like to order anything else? Another annoying thing is the worker that spoke with us was making rounds to all the table with another employee. So two people together couldn't put in an order for us. Very irritating!\n\nGranted, the fish was amazing. This is the place to go when you are craving fish from Japan. It's very fresh, exotic, and definitely for sushi lovers only! I believe the special menu changes every night, and I can't remember what I ordered...only can recall the Anago, and ocean Trout. One downer was the Uni from Hokkadio. It didn't taste like Hokkaido Uni...for all you uni lovers out there who have tried both Santa Barbara and also the sea urchin from Japan, it was disappointing. I don't know if they had both in the house...but if they did, perhaps they switched it by accident. Just judging from the service, I could see this easily happening.\n\nI also enjoyed the broiled fish selection. Most restaurants only have Hamachi Kama, but this place had about 5 different variations of this. I loved trying another type of fish! (can't remember which one we got). Somen with Shiso was really delicious. It was refreshing and modern.\n\nI give this restaurant some slack since it's only a few weeks old. But their service needs to get with it!", "author": "Jocelyn L."}

I could've slept in! C'est la vie. I decided to make the best of it and have brunch. But, not wanting a wait, I pulled up the handy reservation app and the first to come up was ICHI Sushi + NI Bar. Perfect. I'd just read about their new brunch in Inside Scoop and the menu sounded divine.\n\nMade my way down Mission St and walked into some great music. The Giants game was on and I had a view of it from my counter seat. Perused the menu and decided I needed an appetizer, an entree and a dessert. So I ordered a half bowl of the NI Bar Ramen with the kuro and chili oils, the ICHI Chirashi with the uni and the Tamago French Toast. \n\nThe kitchen was going crazy as it was their first brunch. There was a bit of a wait for the food but hell, I had a whole free day and the game was on. Then the food came pretty much all at once. It looked like I ordered three entrees but technically it was only two and a half.\n\nI looked like a little pig. And. I. Did. Not. Care.\n\nThe ramen was very tasty and I really liked the kuro oil. Chef Tim explained to me how its made and I truly appreciate the work that goes in to making that amazing flavor. I enjoyed the chirashi but wished the rice was a tad stickier.

They tailor to your table depending on what type of food you're able to eat. IE: Are you OK with shellfish? Do you eat all types of meat? Any allergies? They ask you a few set of questions to determine what selections the chef will have prepared for you. There isn't a set number on how many dishes will be served. It is determined by how full you are towards the middle. When they check in with you, you can definitely add more dishes or stop there. You can choose either a hot dish/cold dish. Even dessert! The price range for the omakase is between $60-$100. I really like this omakase option. Now onto the food!\n\nThey really specialize in nigiris (sashimi lying on top of rice). Their fish indeed are very fresh. They even have fish all the way from Hawaii!! Their nigiris are flavored by the chef, so they do not serve it with additional wasabi and soy sauce. I enjoyed the hot plates much more. The clams were so flavorful! I recommend ordering that.

I made reservations a few weeks in advance for a 7:30pm dinner on a Friday night- however, there were still a couple of tables available along with seats at the sushi bar for walk-in customers when we arrived. We were seated away, and I convinced her to do the omakase with me. Our server was really helpful, and thoroughly explained the different options we had with the omakase- we could opt for sushi/nigiri only, or a combination of dishes + sushi/nigiri. We could also let them know if we had any allergies, or foods that we didn't like, and also if we wanted to eat something in particular. I loved the flexibility of their omakase, and we opted to go with a combination of dishes + sushi/nigiri, and let the chef choose for us. Our omakase consisted of:\n\n-Cucumber Salad ($6, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi-sushi-ni-bar-san-francisco-2?select=6HOOBDsRU8CqBwzEkdw9xA#6HOOBDsRU8CqBwzEkdw9xA): Delicious- I loved the miso dressing they used for this salad, and the cucumbers were super fresh, crisp, and crunchy. I could eat a few bowls of this.\n-Maguro Avocado Salad ($12.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi-sushi-ni-bar-san-francisco-2?select=6HOOBDsRU8CqBwzEkdw9xA#sqE77a6p547sf0eg9I9Tjw): Just ok.. the tuna was fresh, and I enjoyed this dish, but it wasn't so amazing that I'd want to order it again, especially for the price. Skip.\n-Hirame ($7) / Suzuki ($8) / Tai ($6.50) / Katsuo ($8) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi-sushi-ni-bar-san-francisco-2?select=6HOOBDsRU8CqBwzEkdw9xA#kwPw16hEteL0dqFNi0ixWA]: I normally wouldn't order any of these as nigiri, and I didn't really love any of them, but they were all good since they were so fresh.\n-Inada ($8) / Shima Aji ($8) / Wild Sake ($7.50) / Shiro Toro ($8) / Sanma ($8) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi-sushi-ni-bar-san-francisco-2?select=6HOOBDsRU8CqBwzEkdw9xA#z2Pq9DaMhYujjU9EBFDWrA]: The toro and wild sake were definitely my favorites, but all the nigiri were really good since all of the fish were fresh. \n-Ocean Trout Dashi ($9.75, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi-sushi-ni-bar-san-francisco-2?select=6HOOBDsRU8CqBwzEkdw9xA#G6z87SAgAZUtGNV7cCWNdg): Yum! I wasn't excited to hear that this was part of the omakase, but I was happily surprised. The ocean trout was cooked well, and the dashi had a good umami flavor- recommended!\n-Pork Belly ($11.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi-sushi-ni-bar-san-francisco-2?select=6HOOBDsRU8CqBwzEkdw9xA#_6ELkmIsENwMx28uJ-X4mA): Good, but not amazing. Some pieces of pork belly had the perfect crisp to tenderness ratio, but one piece was overcooked and dry. Skip.\n-Uni ($4.25/1 piece, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/ichi-sushi-ni-bar-san-francisco-2?select=p9sJ7Em0CuO2nhRlyB6_Ag#p9sJ7Em0CuO2nhRlyB6_Ag): Good, but not amazing. I would only order this again if I had a craving for uni.\n\nOverall, we had a great dinner at ICHI, and if I came back, I would love to build my own omakase now that I know I can order just 1 piece of nigiri. One of the only negatives was the really small table- my friend and I are short Asian girls, and we felt a bit cramped. Also, the seats weren't the comfortable, and my legs started feeling numb towards the end of the meal. The other negative is the lack of parking in this area- there is very limited street parking, and very little parking that is really close to the restaurant, so you're almost guaranteed a short walk.

I've been twice, and the repeat offenders have been the umi masu iridashi (ocean trout in dashi broth), sushi rolls, and kushiyaki plate (chef's choice of skewers). We discovered the umi masu when told that there was no salmon on the menu, and the ocean trout is very similar in texture and fatty-ness. In my opinion, it is not nearly as flavorful as salmon when covered up with avocado + cucumber in a roll, so I'd recommend getting it in the umi masu iridashi. The sushi rolls are a steal - high quality fish in an 8 piece roll, for $8? Not just \"spicy tuna\"? As for the kushiyaki plate, which will come with 3 meat and 1 vegetable skewer, these do not disappoint. They're actually not so difficult to split either, unlike other kebabs that will literally have you flinging meat across the table as you un-skewer them.\n\nI have also tried the kama shioyaki (fish collar), miso asari clams, nasu (eggplant), and nigiri. I would definitely recommend the eggplant if you're a fan of the veggie. The nigiri have been fresh and pretty good quality, albeit a little small. Otherwise, the fish collar had too many bones in it, and the clams were just okay.\n\nWe've been here for happy hour, which didn't really have any of my favorite things, but did indulge us in the nasu ($4) and fantastic shochu cocktails ($10). Those cocktails are sour, refreshing, and intensely cucumber!\n\nOne odd thing about ICHI is that their omakase just sounds like a fancy way to get you to buy 12 pieces of nigiri. It's actually a la carte, as you select your own fish without any sushi-master guidance, so... just order a la carte.\n\nI'm torn between leaving a 3 or 4 star review, but the price and several okay dishes are holding me back.", "author": "Stella A."}

The place was jam-packed when we walked in, but the bar seats seemed to turn-over quickly, so we probably could have walked in sans reservation.\n\nAnyways, our table was a little on the uncomfortable side.

A few minutes later our drinks came out. I went with the RW menu while the hubs opted for the omakase. The pricing and quantity for the omakase is a little ambiguous. You pretty much tell them how much you want to eat and they gauge accordingly, so the fish pricing varies your overall cost. All in, I was pretty underwhelmed. I thought the sashimi was ok, the salmon being the best. The two rolls (CA and spicy tuna) were forgettable. There was a strong mayonnaise flavor which masked the fish. The last course, clams in broth, was also a huge miss. Sadly, I couldn't get past the look of the dish. Honestly, like a bowl of sewage water. The broth was overly-salted.

The sushi at Ichi Sushi was great!\n\nIf there is one word that would describe sushi here, it is \"playful.\" There seems to be no structural or stylistic boundary with the sushi pieces here. You'll see a variety of fish, with different dressings from yuzu to plum. Unlike the high-end sushi places I had been to where chefs tend to be more disciplined in their attitude toward the craft of sushi-making, the chefs at the counter, all on the younger side, and are more open and seem less constrained by the rigor of the craft. Yet, I really loved the free-flowing approach, and there were really outstanding pieces that had remarkable texture. Various pieces like three line grunt (which came with plum sauce on top), tuna, Japanese mackerel, amberjack (with yuzu dressing on top), fluke fin muscle, toro and uni were all literally melting in my mouth. I went with the omakase option where the chef brings about 12 pieces. I should've kept ordering more pieces, but instead I also tried a couple of hot dishes. Unfortunately, they were somewhat underwhelming compared to the awesome sushi pieces. Both pork belly and ocean trout karage in dashi broth were more or less ordinary. \n\nThe restaurant has that perfect hipster vibe that will make it an ideal place to grab dinner before a night out at Mission. There is a diverse selection of sake and a somewhat more concise list of wine. Getting a reservation wasn't too hard as long as you book a couple of weeks in advance, but the place was absolutely packed on a Friday night. Given that the flow of traffic tends to be on the faster side, I think you can probably try walk-in too. Ichi Sushi was a pleasant surprise that shows sushi at San Francisco is no slouch.", "author": "Ken S."}

Yeah, it's in Bernal Heights which is not hustling and bustling but at least it's easy to find parking, and hey, you can get Mitchell's for ice cream afterwards :)\n\n$1 oysters YASSSSS. And it doesn't get crowded here like most places in the city because it IS far from everything and it's not close to BART.. The oysters were really good. It came already dressed with ponzu - so you don't use the typical cocktail sauce. SO GOOD - simply: fresh & sweet.\n\nI believe the beers were $3-6 or so? Phat pint! I forgot what brand of type of beer were offered but it was decent stuff (I think I got a Stella?! @_@!).\n\nWe also had the Yuzu chicken wings which is usually $9.50 but I believe it was $6 or 7 for HH. SO GOOD. Dry fried chicken wings with SO much flavor and light/crispy batter. PERFECTION. Perfect with the beeeeeeeeeeeeeeeer.\n\nThe interior is modern, clean, and simple. It looks like their mission is going back to the tradition and basics of basically showcasing the fish / ingredients and not doing anything super crazy or adding a bunch of sauce.

The omakase was on the 7x7 list, so we gave it a shot.  FIrst of all, we had a reservation and since there isn't really a good place (yeah, there's a small bar, but it was already packed with others waiting for their table), so the three of us stood in the corner awkwardly for at least 15-20 minutes waiting for our table to clear. Granted, maybe 15 minutes isn't that long, but there's more...\n\nSo we get our table, order, and start to chat it up not noticing how much time had passed when we got our first dish.  I can't quite recall how many dishes were brought out, but let me just say that we had at least 10.  Usually it would take some time for the first dish to be brought out, but after that it's smooth sailing right?  WRONG!  In between each dish we waited at least 20-30 minutes.  When you're hungry, that is just way too much time in between bites.  Remember, this is omakase, so it isn't like you're getting full plates of stuff slowly.  Another thing that turned me off, was the hamachi collar.  Yes, I'm used to getting my own, and granted there have been a couple of times where I had to share with ONE another person, but one collar for THREE people?!  Craziness.  \n\nNow service was slow, but when we expressed a complaint about an especially salty dish, we were nicely surprised by an alternative dish that was much better.  The food was good, but nothing spectacular.  I gave this place 3 stars hoping that my experience was just a fluke of being short staffed, but given all the new sushi joints popping up, I don't think I\"ll be back anytime soon.", "author": "Rachelle T."}

He also loves to surf if you ever want to sneakily bring that into the conversation!\n\nWe got about 11 pieces of nigiri and they were all delicious.

In particular, you must try those clams! It comes with an amazing broth and pieces of ground pork. So unique and it's on the 2015 7x7 must eats list! The fried chicken wings were also pretty good, in fact, my brother devoured ALL of them without even giving us a chance to steal more than a few bites.\n\nI would come back here for the nigiri when I'm close to the mission and for those who love hot dishes and red meat, the skewers and hot dishes are worth trying as well.

Despite letting the waitress know this we were served two egg based dishes and at the end of the night the pescatarians were still hungry because there had been only one vegetable substitution in the hot part of the omakase. \n\nFinally, it took forever to get the food. We were hungry which we let the waitress know but despite that there was still about a half hour break between each dish.

She grew up in the San Fernando Valley and never really knew much about this thing people called \"sushi.\" \n\nOne day, she and her best friend were shopping at the Beverly Center and they decided to check out this new restaurant called Todai.  Now, if you never had the pleasure of dining at this establishment, their offerings were kind of the equivalent of a giant shit stain on brand new white sheets. Delicious. The \"salmon\" was flourescent orange. The \"rice\" tasted like stale cardboard. And it was all-you-can-eat, so as you can imagine, the quality was simply amazing. Safe to say, Stephy now hated \"sushi.\" Sushi could go fuq itself.\n\nAs young Stephy got older, she and her friends were lucky enough to have things called expense accounts and she soon discovered amazing LA sushi places like Nozawa, Sushi Ike, Park Sushi, Hama, Sushi Gen and Asanebo. Stephy liked sushi now. Stephy really liked sushi now. Why is Stephy referring to herself in the third person? Knock it off, Stephy, you're creeping us out.\n\nCut to 2010 and Stephy is living in SF. Now with a honed palate for truly amazing sushi, a friend takes her to Ichi one night in it's original location and her mind is quickly blown. Like, it seriously exploded all over the sushi counter. It was ridiculous. In fact, a few customers are still probably suffering PTSD from witnessing her reaction. But that is neither here nor there. She couldn't understand how something so amazing had found its way onto her tongue. She couldn't even put into words how incredible this food was. She developed an insta-sushi chef crush on owner Tim Archuleta and wonders if he is actually (Food) God himself. Because, yes, THE SUSHI HE IS SLINGING IS INCREDIBLE ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY MAKE YOU BELIEVE IN RELIGION!!\n\nShe then becomes a regular. Actually, die-hard devotee is more accurate. The old location closes (terribly sad day) and the new location is born and she won't shut the fuq up about how incredible this place is. She takes dates there, boyfriends, local friends, out of town friends, anyone who foolishly thinks they've already had the best sushi in SF because she knows after an omakase experience here, hahahaha, good luck with that, you just got schooled! See what I did there. Schooled. Fish. Okay. Move On.\n\nHaving now eaten here a good 25+ times, I can tell you this with 1000000% certainty: You will be hard-pressed to find a better dining experience in SF. The caliber of fish. The sustainability. The amazing staff. The vibe. The music. The sake. The happy hour. The Ni Bar. It is everything. It's the reason you were born. It's the attainable bucket list item. And it is seriously one of my favorite restaurants on the planet. I would have dirty, raunchy sex with this restaurant if it let me. I'd even marry it afterwards. And still have dirty, raunchy married sex with it! DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW DEEP MY LOVE IS?!?!?!\n\nIf you listen to nothing else today, listen to me now. Go to Ichi.

I've been here close to a dozen times dating to their original space, and they always deliver a delectable variety of nigiri with each piece uniquely seasoned with its own bright and unique accents depending on the fish. Some of the cool things they add are shiso, green tea salt, soy reduction, and yuzu. I usually ask for a 10 piece, but I am sure they will accommodate any size tasting you desire and cater it to your tastes. I pretty much like to try everything, so I leave it in their hands.\n\nBecause they adhere to sustainably sourced fished, you'll get some fish that isn't as popular (like Red Eye Snapper and Ocean Trout, for example) \n\nMore and more places do this, but don't execute it quite as well as Ichi... Whenever you order a piece of sweet shrimp nigiri (Ao Ebi), you will also get the deep fried head to go along with it. Whenever I have ordered it, the head has come out piping hot and super crispy. If there was a menu item of just the heads, I'd order it in a heartbeat. \n\nThe other thing I like about this place is the music. They always seem to play a selection of music from my Golden Age (the 90s) which will always earn some points with me. \n\nOverall, one of the better sushi bar experiences in the city.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

But my experience at Ichi+In makes me feel in some sense obligated so all future diners can avoid the confusion we experienced. \n\nFirst a quick evaluation of the experience:\nNigiri - delicious, unlike any other sushi experience I've had in San Francisco. \nSkewers - amazing, best non-fish item of the night. Pork shoulder and flank steak were unbelievable, we could have made a meal out of these (and may do so in the future)\nMiso Clams - disappointing after the hype, was hoping for more depth of flavor in the broth. \nCorn with Miso Butter - delicious, more places should serve fancy iterations of corn on the cob.\nAmbiance - bustling/lively, to be expected on a Friday night at 7, interestingly, died down around 8.\nService - friendly, willing to offer advice and recommendations, but also the reason this review isn't 5 stars. \n\nThe reason I'm writing this review is because there is at least one server who cannot properly communicate, in basic/blunt terms, what Omakase is, and none of the comments I've read on Yelp since have explained it either. We're we naive and should have known going in? Maybe. But when asked if it was our first time dining, we said yes, followed by \"What's Omakase?\" Because we didn't know, and think that would be made clear by the question. \n\nOn the menu, Omakase just says \"Chefs choice - ask your server for details.\" Per our server, Omakase \"consists of an assortment of chefs choice fish and several small plates. It's super flexible!\" She says, \"if you like or don't like something, it's super customizable.\" \n\n\"So... How many plates... Err... How much do you get with it?\"\n\n\"However many you want! Like I said, it's super customizable!\"\n\nI'll spare you the rest of the exchange, but what our server is trying to say in her most delicate dance is \"Omakase is allowing us to choose your meal, with any input you would like to offer, then we will give you a bill for everything you ate. We can bring you as much food as you would like and will create a full priced, itemized bill for all of it, which you will receive at the the end of the meal.\"\n\nSo if you're thinking to yourself, \"Self, what's the difference between ordering off the menu and Omakase?\" Nothing. Except you only choose as much as you want, and the chef chooses the rest.\n\nIt's hard to argue that there are more appropriate and accurate words to describe Omakase than \"super flexible\" because it is literally ordering food that is offered on their menu, then paying for it, like you would at every other restaurant that you order food off the menu. \n\nThose who know me know that it takes a lot for me to \"complain,\" if that's what you call this review. And let me be clear, I am NOT complaining about the quality of the food, I am NOT complaining about the prices and I am NOT complaining about the friendliness of the staff. But last night, was a first. No quantity listed, no price listed, no explanation why there was literally no criteria associated with Omakase. And ultimately it made perfect sense - and honestly made for a fantastic meal! \n\nWe're we naive for not knowing what we were getting into, yeah, turns out we were. But our server had the opportunity to clarify and communicate clearly so we could fully enjoy the beautiful and wonderful culinary journey we were about to embark on. A chance to allow us to fully appreciate what was happening and make the most out of it. And that was the missing piece. \n\nWe'll be back. I'm sure we will, because the food was too delicious not to go back.

San Francisco sushi does not get better than this, and you don't have to wait for 2 hours to enjoy it.\n\nJust remember one thing: when you see me come in the door at ICHI, remember who turned you on to this place, and make room at the sushi bar for the hungry bald guy.", "author": "Cameron C."}

The freshness and flavor that is packed into every piece is a marvel--simple flavors come together with incredibly fresh fish to form a complex. Even the pieces that aren't for the faint of heart, such as anago and uni, are so enjoyable that anyone can love them. \n\nMy two favorite pieces were the inagi and shiro toro. The inagi was so fresh and wonderfully seasoned. Shiro toro completely melts in your mouth, and is exploding with flavor. \n\nOmakase at Ichi is truly an otherworldly, ethereal experience with food.

We also ordered the goma ae, shishito peppers and edamame. The goma ae was great because it was peas shoots instead of the standard blanched spinach, it was heartier and had a great crunch. The shishito peppers were also great, a nice salty, lemony garlic-y flavor going on with them. \nI appreciate that they serve all sustainable fish, that is great and for the sake of our ocean, all sushi restaurants should follow suit.

I was so wowed by the quality of the fish, that it topped the list of go to sushi restaurants in SF. When my sister came to visit from Chicago wanting some good sushi, I chose to take her to ICHI. We ordered about 8 different fish, and almost ALL tasted fishy and old. I was extremely disappointed by the quality of fish that was served. It even tasted dried out like it had been sitting around for too long. In fairness, the albacore with onions was delicious (I think since there was a marinade it was not as necessary to provide top freshness). They have the right approach, just really need to address the freshness issue with the sushi. Unfortunately I'll be looking for different sushi spots, and will not be returning.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-25", "description": "I really wanted to like this place, based on what I've long heard about it.\n\nOn the good side, the staff are very friendly. The sushi is also generally the star here, with the emphasis on the core ingredients and less on dressing it up (or disguising inferior fish). And there is a good emphasis on the daily specials -- since when it comes to fish, it's always about what's freshly caught.\n\nThey have many Japanese varieties you don't always see in SF sushi joints. And what you don't see are many of the unsustainably fished staples at most sushi restaurants, such as unagi, etc. You can also go full on omakase here, and the sushi chefs will take care of you with a variety of things to try out. This can get pricey, however, as I would call this place a little more expensive than the norm for SF sushi (especially given their smaller nigiri sizes).\n\nThey have some nice sake options (cold, of course) on the menu as well.\n\nWhat wasn't so great about ICHI is that the sushi didn't shine here - for being the star attraction. The service is a bit discoordinated, as it's easy to order dishes that come completely out of the order you requested. There are also often long or short gaps between plates, as it is not well-metered out. Then comes the weirder stuff.\n\nI didn't mind the gentle lecture on the proper way to prepare and eat nigiri, even if being told what you already know is a little like being a scolded child. So I get that any wasabi or soy added to the nigiri is at the sushi chef's discretion of taste (unlike the rolls). But if you're going to give me that lecture, you had better deliver wonderfully flavorful sushi where I wouldn't be tempted to change a thing. That did not happen, and the sushi fell a little short.\n\nBetween that and a conversation with one of the wait staff about their cold sake (\"we could make one hot for you\"), I got the strange sense that ICHI is lost somewhere between sushi newbies and sushi patrons who know what to expect. And that's OK -- there's nothing wrong with teaching or learning a few things.\n\nBut there is a fine line between honoring a cultural tradition and parodying a cultural stereotype. Here ICHI seems to follow a number of paint-by-number superficial details of what makes a Japanese sushi bar while missing out on creating its soul. You get the \"irasshaimase\" greeting, but all the sushi chefs look like skateboarders from Orange County. As if they got together at a Vans-sponsored skate park and decided, \"Wouldn't it be cool if we acted Japanese and started a sushi place?\"\n\nThe rest of the wait staff is whiter than a Walnut Creek Cheescake Factory, thus it begs a question: how would you feel about a soul food restaurant run entirely by ethnic Chinese where they spoke in ebonics and lectured you on how to properly prepare and eat collard greens with grits?\n\nAsking for something a little more authentic of your sushi, whether it's steeped in Japanese tradition or something decidedly Western, shouldn't be a stretch. But hedging by trying to accomplish both is a recipe for failure. It might fly in Norman, OK, but not when you're just a couple miles from SF's Japantown.\n\nWith so many better Western or traditional Japanese options in SF for sushi, I won't be back.", "author": "Teddy B."}

The walls tell you to eat this way because the fish is the best and because it's the best it's super expensive. The walls make no mention of the prices that's on the menu. \n\nHonestly I didn't realize that sushi is meant to be eaten upside down and without sauce until a Japanese friend told me years ago. And that's cool. But I like soy sauce with my fish. So paying gobs of money for a morsel of fish isn't my thing. Which is to say Ichi clearly isn't for me. And that's fine.  \n\nYes this place is more expensive than than most sushi spots in SF. But it's authentic....ok. So does authentic equal expensive. Here it does and maybe that's because they are in a foodie area.\n\nWhatever the case the food is good but you will likely be hungry after leaving.  So come with a fat wallet and leave with an empty one.", "author": "Joseph M."}

We ordered Kusshi oysters, the rare yuzu beer, along with the famous fried chicken. \n\nOysters were a bit expensive but fresh and sweet. Fried Chicken was good but in a subtle way.

It's not bad, but different.\n\nAs we move to a table at Ichi Sushi, we ordered some nigiri and sashimi. The dinner menu is a bit sheer, but simplicity at its best. We ordered spicy scallop and spicy yellowtail, along with Uni, Amaebi, Tobiko and the best one of the night was the Tai, Japanese Sea Bream. Everything was fresh and mouth watering.

The yakitori was decent but nothing to write home about. Overall, this place lacks heart and flavors are bland. I don't mind if a place suggests that you should not use soy sauce on your nigiri when the chef has already seasoned it, but in that case you should be able to tell it was seasoned and it does not need to be mandated.

Even on a Wednesday night, we couldn't get a reservation until 9:30, but we had a drink at the bar and ended up being able to get seated earlier. We were at sushi bar the whole night, so pretty much all of our interaction was with the sushi chefs. They were great - personable, funny, and they were good at choosing and explaining the sushi.\n\nWe ended up deciding to let the chef choose 5 pieces of nigiri for each of us to try. The fish was really fresh and delicious, and we all got to try things that we may not have ordered ourselves. One of my friends is a little pickier and he catered to what she said that her dislikes and likes are. We ordered a couple of rolls and the pork shoulder as well, which were all good, but the nigiri was definitely a stand out for me.\n\nWhen the bill came, we were all pleasantly surprised that the price matched up with the quality of food and experience. Especially since we let the chef choose and he did give us things that are usually more expensive like toro and uni. It's so nice to find a sushi place that is actually good and not outrageous!\n\nThe reason why this place is getting five stars is because once I left, I knew I wanted to come back. I wouldn't say this was the best meal I've had in my life, but it was great, and the sushi chefs, atmosphere and price make ICHI sushi a keeper.

I'd heard so many great things about the place that I definitely wanted to celebrate with delicious sushi on my birthday.  When we got there, the hostess quoted a wait time of 45 minutes which was cool, so we went next door to drink margaritas. \n\nAn hour and twenty minutes later, she still hadn't called so I went back over to check and she told us that they wouldn't be able to seat us before the they closed so we were, pretty much, shit out of luck. In sum, the hostess couldn't even be bothered to call and tell us we wouldn't get a seat and had us sitting around for almost an hour and a half waiting to not get seated. \n\nEven if it hadn't been my birthday, it was a pretty dick move, so I celebrated at Emmy's where the hostess was far more competent and accommodating even if it wasn't exactly the celebratory meal I had been hoping for.

We were sat at the sushi bar (too close for comfort), a little too high and uncomfortable chairs. \n\nWe had the prefixe menu which came with drinks(a cocktail, Sapporo and a generous amount of cold sake which came out at different times according to how far along we were on the prefixe menu). First we had maguro sashimi. I typically don't like Maguro but this sashimi was delicious! \nSecond, we had 3 peices of nigiri. The two that stood out to me the most was the ocean trout (must try!!)  and the seabream! A pesto wheat noodles dish came out which was also pretty good and refreshing. A little salty, probably needed one more squeeze of lemon to balance it out. Next we had chicken, pork shoulder and steak on skewers. Chicken was nice and juicy with a kick of spicy. Pork shoulder was a little dry. Steak was juicy also. We also ordered wagyu beef nigiri and toro nigiri. I liked the wagyu but it was a little tough.

Drinks - beer (5 types), sake (8-10 options?), and one cocktail on the menu - meh.  Customer service - harmless, but meh too. I wouldn't go back.  If I lived closer to the place and if there were other things to do in the area, then I might eat there again out of convenience and proximity.  I would not go out and actively seek dinner at Ichi Sushi + Ni Bar.  I also don't understand why it's called Ni Bar - they only had one cocktail on the menu and about 4-5 beers on the menu as well.  I was expecting a more selection of cocktails and Japanese beers.  Echigo beer needs to be added to the menu!\n\nWe were very excited and eager to eat here and put in a reservation on a weekend that we felt like celebrating something - it was our menniversary.  So...being super excited to eat out and have good sushi, this may have raised our expectations...maybe - trying to be fair here.  If you wanna read more details see below...\n\nSAKE: The waitress we had was friendly, but she wasn't very knowledgeable on the sake. We were hoping to have a flight of sake - but this place did not have such a thing.  (*note there is no unfiltered sake here). We ended up getting the Cat's Meow ($9) which is an ume, shiso adult beverage.  It's not like umeshu - so don't get it if you are thinking it's similar and sweet because it is not.  \n\nAPPETIZER: Shishito peppers DELICIOUS!  So good!  Could have been slightly salted more, but it was tasty.  Love those little things.  Albacore tataki - the fish wasn't that fresh - and i felt it wasn't that flavorful.  I have had tataki at many places, and this one was just alright...dry almost.  It wasn't bad, but it is probably something that I wouldn't order again.\n\nSUSHI: We ordered nigiri (magurgo, amaebi, and seared shiro maguro).  Waitress suggested that we NOT use wasabi or shoyu on the nigiri as it had other sauces/flavors added on it.  We were excited by this - nothing beats a good piece of raw fish that doesn't need soy sauce or wasabi to mask the flavor.  Maguro was definitely fishy...needed soy sauce on that one.  Amaebi was sweet - but it was a weird texture - mushy, creamy, and slimy...did not taste fresh.  I have had really good amaebi where the texture was light, crisp, and refreshing.  Seared shiro maguro was okay - nothing to write home about.   Inari was inari - good old simple sushi - you can't screw that up.\n\nMAKI ROLLS: Vegetable futomakiwas good - again, nothing to write home about. It had gobo inside and I love the crunch of gobo.  Spicy albacore was the best maki roll that we had - and probably the best sushi we had that night.  I recommend.\n\nAMBIANCE: Trendy.  Was definitely nice, hip & cool.  I like the mural on the wall that explains how to eat sushi.  Wasn't too bright or dark in there.  The old school hip hop music was awesome - had a \"name that tune\" competition with my boyfriend during dinner.  What is it with hip hop and sushi?  Why are they paired together like that?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-04-29", "description": "Some reviewers mentioned pretentiousness, I see it as entertainment. It is a little difficult to take young(er) people following \"traditional rules\" seriously. If there was a 90 year old chef at the counter threatening to boot me out for asking for soy sauce, I can go with the flow and shut up. When someone much younger does it, hell yes, I'm going to ask for soy sauce just to see what will ensue. \n\nThis is not a giant piece of fish on a giant slab of rice place; the flavors are delicate and layered, the rice is compact and well-shaped, the flavors can be unexpected, just enough to wake my senses in the middle of auto-feeding to say, \"hey, slow down, something special's going on here.\" \n\nBack to the soy sauce, there aren't any on the tables, there also wasn't a lump of wasabi with every plate--things I've gotten used to seeing in sushi restaurants. When asked, we were told each piece was appropriately sauced/wasabi'd as the chef intended--fair enough and I agree. But, upon further pressing to different table attendants, we were given the tiniest pencil eraser size ball of wasabi and a bottle of soy sauce that was soon taken away from us by another server while we were distracted. Asides from the excellent pork belly, flavorful barracuda nigiri, and scrumptious skewers, acquiring and losing that soy sauce bottle was pretty good entertainment for the eve. In retrospect, maybe the beer influenced our amusement. \n\nWe arrived at 5:30 on Monday once the shop opened, it was fairly full by 6, but had plenty of walk-in seats in the rear for small groups. The crowd and the styling of the place leans to the young, but the food quality will satiate all fine sushi fans. It can get a little loud when full, very attentive staff. No desserts on the menu, but Mitchell's Ice Cream is around the corner. A solid place, a good place to eat on your own so you can focus on the flavor.

Words cannot explain how good ICHI was but I will do my best to describe the deliciousness-y, goodness-y heaven I infested tonight. \n\nLet me start off by saying I love sushi. And not the spider roll, fried sushi kinda sushi. I'm talking salmon roe with quail egg and monkfish liver kind of sushi. I had read about ICHI in 7x7 and how it was voted best sushi in the 2014 Eat + Drink Awards and I knew I had to try it. I can say with certainty it was the best sushi I've had in San Francisco. I even overheard (ok, let's be real, I was totally eavesdropping) a chef saying that the fish was flown in that today fresh from Japan and will have another delivery on Friday. Talk about fresh! Right when you walk in the door, you're greeted and hit in the face with fresh fish smell.\n\nWe had 10 different things that we ordered, but I'll talk about the highlights. The first thing we tried was on the daily special sheet, the Samekawa Karei (aka Japanese Sharkskin Flounder). Wow. I think this was the best tasting piece of sushi I've ever had. They quickly cooked the skin with a blow torch and placed it on top of the fish. Wow. You could taste every little flavor that was on that piece and it was amazing. The Kampachi Kama (salted Albacore collar) was mouth watering-ly good. I'm sitting here drooling just thinking about how good it was. Came out hot (which is huge in my book) and so absolutely tasty. It's so hard to describe, but just trust me when I say to try it. The Ikura (Salmon Roe) was also the best I've ever had. I make it a point to try it at every sushi place I go to and ICHI had by far the best.\n\nWe had Daniel as our sushi chef and he was wonderful. I will be for sure requesting to sit in his area every time I go here. Not only did he know what he was talking about but was able to make great sushi (which was a given I'm sure but he seemed better than everyone else!). Two times I asked him to surprise us and he did not disappoint. First we had a roll with eel and cucumber which was still warm from the freshly cooked eels. NOMS! Then he made us uni with cucumber and salmon roe and a fish crisp to start. Everything worked together so perfectly I wanted another one but resisted.\n\nOverall, I recommend this place to true sushi lovers. I can't wait to go back and try all new things because I know that it will not disappoint. Thank you Daniel for the wonderful experience and looking forward to your new treats!", "author": "Sabrina D."}

(I didn't try tuna as usual because most places in the US have awful tuna. Toro is OK mostly but \"Akami\" in the US just sucks. I stopped eating Tuna after moving here from Japan.) \n\nWhy 3 stars if the quality of fish is very good? I didn't agree with \"chef's choice of garnish/sauce\" on a lot of nigiri pieces. It is sometimes simply better with a touch of wasabi and soy sauce on nigiri than Yuzu, etc. I appreciate this restaurant is showing that sushi or sashimi is not supposed to be over-dipped in excessive wasabi and soy sauce but I also want to enjoy my nigiri as the best way possible. They seem to use a lot of Yuzu on nigiri but some fish really just call for a touch of wasabi and soy sauce instead of Yuzu.\n\nWould I be back? Maybe. If I figure out how to ask for a little wasabi and soy sauce without offending the chef.

Nope, sorry, can't agree. I've had sushi at 9am at Tsukiji market in Tokyo, I feel like I know what I'm reviewing. \n\nAs with any hipster SF joint our table wasn't ready when we arrived on-time for our 7:45p reservation. 30min wait. Kind of par for the course, unfortunately. We had one restaurant week menu and sampled other items a la carte for more variety. The chirashi was good, as was the restaurant week bincho tataki. The rest was ok, but nothing to write home about. The miso clams were downright disappointing and the sashimi or rolls, though the fish was expectedly very fresh, didn't blow my mind. \n\nThe bottom line is, my neighborhood sushi place does better, with as fresh of fish, and we usually walk out having eaten loads for $65 (price of the Ichi restaurant week menu) for 2 people. Ichi was priced too high to not wow us, and it did not wow us. We won't be recommending it or returning.", "author": "Kendall G."}

We went in on a Friday night around 7, and they quoted us 25 minutes to wait, and almost exactly 25 minutes later, I got a text from the hostess saying that a seat at the bar was ready. Even though we didn't wait there for the 25 minutes, I appreciated that we could've hung out at the bar in the back while waiting for the table. \n\nI agree with all of the other positive reviews saying that you should go with the omakase, although what I appreciated most if that the sushi chef asked us to order some things we liked, and then he could add some sushi that would complement what we ordered. It wasn't that we just had to pay a ton of money without any control -- instead we were able to tell them what we liked and didn't like and ordering a bunch of other interesting things at the same time. Everything the chef prepared for us were delicious and fresh, and the only things we didn't like were the things we ordered.\n\nUnfortunately, two of those things that were not great were the two beef dishes we ordered. The beef tataki was a bit on the tough side, perhaps just a bit overcooked. Also, the wagyu nigiri had a great taste to it, but was also a bit on the tough side. It didn't melt in your mouth like other similar dishes I've had at other high-end sushi places.

I had to pick where I wanted to sit and couldn't order food from the other section. Because it's Friday evening and the sushi side was full, we settled in the 'hot dish' section. \n\nWhat was strange about the hot dish section was there was sashimi (raw seafood without the rice underneath) on its menu. So it wasn't hot dish only. The whole point of divvying up the restaurant into raw and hot sections was moot? (Not to mention I have never been to a 'Japanese' restaurant that has this kind of set up) To add to confusion, I tried to order the one and only (sake) cocktail on the menu and the waitress had trouble knowing if it's available and took her more than 15 minutes to check both sides to find out. If you had only 1 cocktail on the menu, you better frigging know if you are serving it or not.\n\nAs for the food, the quality to be fair wasn't bad but just of tiny portion. Real Japanese portion. So the sticker price may not seem much, it adds up when you have to get full. In the end I paid $75 for food and a couple of drinks and was still kind of hungry. \n\nI always lament the fact that there aren't many good Japanese (or Asian) restaurants in the city (given its reputation as a foodie haven) and this is another shining example of this inadequacy.

The reviews would lead you to believe that this is the Holy Grail of sushi in San Francisco, and while this is better than Barracuda (sorry, neighborhood sushi spot!) it also wasn't as mind-blowing as expected.\n\nWe arrived a bit early (how did MUNI get us to our destination early, I'll never know), so we sat in the back of the restaurant, the NI Bar, as it were. I was half-expecting this place to be overrun with people, given how highly-publicized this place has been, but it was actually comfortable for a Friday night. The decor was very simple and, in actuality, left a bit to desire. I felt like it was very \"Ikea\". Perhaps I am used to my sushi joints being a bit more 'divey', but this felt like it was trying to be elevated, but didn't quite hit the mark. \n\nOur reservation time came and went-- we weren't seated until 30 minutes after our 7:45 reservation. The host seemed a bit frazzled-- she couldn't remember names (not really a problem) but we didn't get much of an apology for the extra wait. Again, not much of a big deal, but reservations usually mean avoiding some wait.\n\nWe were seated at the bar itself, which was not a problem for 2, but could be for larger groups. The dining area feels a bit tight-- I wouldn't recommend this place for large groups (which can be great, as there weren't any birthday parties doing sake bombs..)\n\nWe placed our orders directly with the chef, who was friendly and knowledgeable. The man next to us seemed to be going through an extensive run on the menu, receiving piece after piece, causing a reaction that led my boyfriend to describing it as an \"O-face.\" Needless to say, I didn't have the same experience, but this is where my aforementioned lack of sushi-eating experience may make me biased. \n\nHowever, everything I did have was delicious, and despite pondering aloud what we would eat later in the evening, we left pretty full. Highlights included the Spicy Albacore and Vegetable Futomaki. I did not partake in it, but my boyfriend loved the Tuna Tataki. We also opted to start with the Shishito Peppers as an appetizer, which were roasted with great flavor.\n\nSo, in the end, it was a pleasant experience, despite an underwhelming decor and delayed service.

Everything was delicious and flavorful.\n\nI see some reviews complaining about the prices at ICHI, which I will readily admit are on the higher end. But you have to realize you are not going to get a 5-star meal for a 3-star price in a place like San Francisco. I suggest ICHI for special occasions and going with true sushi lovers.", "author": "Joshua L."}

I would say that this is my 2nd favorite sushi place in the US, right behind my beloved Yasuda in NYC. The fish here is amazing and the variety is great. Also the waitress was extremely knowledgeable about the fish and the tastes, I had asked her for a few recommendations and picked amazing fish. I didn't try the rolls I am more of a nigiri type of guy so I ate that. I was also really surprised with the price extremely reasonable, I had a party of 4 and we ordered a ton and we repeated many fish and had an $80 bottle of sake. The bill came in just north of $250 with tip. This to me was not bad at all. When I go to yasuda in NYC I spend that much for a party of 2 and with no sake. \n\nI will definitely update this when I go back,  hopefully in 6-8 months. I live on the east coast so I don't get out there too much but would recommend this place and for a first date is good too as long as the person you take really values good fish.", "author": "Emiliano B."}

I continue to believe that San Francisco just doesn't have great sushi. LA in my opinion has basically the best sushi in the US. Try sugarfish in LA. Beats basically all sf sushi places including Ichi. Fish was fresh here but look that's a given - give me something interesting and exciting. Do something new. Surprise us with a medley of interesting and complex flavors. Shock my taste buds - wake us up and show what you can do with your rice.

This place is just a dump, the sushi was very amateur- low quality rice, CHEWY seaweed. The clams had sand in them, some deep fried thing we got was cold and way too greasy. Granted we didn't get their set menu, but if they screw up the rest of their food this bad I feel sorry for the schmucks that drop $100 on their fish. Bad part of town, bleak interior and failed hipster vibe. They also appear to have charged my card twice.  Maybe the original founders had a decent intent for the place when they opened, but as of now it's horribly executed.

There's not much more to be said about ICHI other than the upgrade has taken something already great and made it even better.  There's really only one way to eat here and that is ordering omakase at the sushi bar.  The benefit of eating at the bar is that you have access to ordering from the izakaya menu as well, but vice versa is not true.\n\nMy sushi partner and I were lucky to snag bar seats without reservation, but only because we were the first to arrive.  We didn't know they took reservations now, so we were lucky with our gamble. Don't take that risk and make one... and again always opting for seating at the sushi bar.\n\nHead Chef Erik again masterfully creates course after course of awesome nigiri. Really, there was not one bad thing we ate, and we packed away over 20+ pieces.  From the izakaya menu, we went for the steak and chicken thigh skewers, both were juicy and tasty.  Also picked up an order of miso clams in some sort of spicy sausage broth, which we enjoyed too, but probably will skip next time... need more room for sushi.  I recommend the ICHIbeer too, which went very well with the meal.  Overall, we left full, satisfied, and still wanting more.\n\nWith both the service and food being spot on, ICHI lives up to its deserved reputation. We'll definitely be back... but just need the wallet reserves to recover.", "author": "Mercutio k."}

The fish selection is good, of high quality, and the portion size of the negiri is correct (one bite). Kind of surprised that they don't offer an oshibori (hot towel) before the meal. Or perhaps they ran out the night I ate there? The sushi rice was, unfortunately, the big flaw in their sushi. The sushi rice was cold (grabbed from uninsulated containers), and a bit too much pressure applied when forming the negiri. Sushi is sauced (soy sauce) by the chef, and patrons aren't given access to additional dipping soy sauce. Only at the top sushi places in Japan do they engage in this method of sushi presentation, and I think it's pretty arrogant of ICHI to ape this practice.

Well...Ichi Ni isn't quite how we remembered our experience but I would like to say the sushi is fresh and different from what you'd get at your average Japanese / sushi restaurant.  We were fortunate to sit at the sushi bar and had to order the omakase.  We had 12 pieces - baby yellowtail, amaebi + mackerel from Japan - probably the best fresh mackerel I've ever had, Hokkaido uni, and it goes on were the most unique.  Something about the rice didn't seem on par - I couldn't put my finger on it.  I wish there was more seasoning on some of our pieces like how I remembered at Ichi.  We tried 2 hot dishes - sea bass collar which was pretty basic but the sushi chef recommended it.  I probably wouldn't order this again.  The 2nd was the chicken meatballs that you dip in a egg yolk with green onions and this was on point.

But where to start, So we get there my party of 3 waiting on the 4th and of course even though we are on time our table isnt ready. but whatever it is friday night I have been in the restaurant industry for the past 20 years I understand weekends can get rough. We get sent back to the back bar to wait we sit down in a stool made for a thin child crammed together so tight to the table behind us its like playing tetris to sit down. We sit and the lady bartender has her back to us wile she \"pours\" tap drinks with her cell phone in her hand and doesnt turn around for ten minutes. And the bar is packed she probably lost 100 dollars ignoring her clients whatever I didnt come her to drink anyway. We eventually get saporo's they arent especially cold or good. We get called to our table which ends up being sushi bar seats with even smaller stools i think if thats even possible, they are unbalanced and extremely uncomfortable. It is hard for me to believe some restaurant designer decided to choose these if they actually tried them out ever.\nWe get seated and our menus, i already know we are gonna get f$%#ed, skewers, hot menu, steak sushi, I hate fusion. The sushi menu is equally frustrating once I realize each order is for a single piece of sushi. Honestly their pricing for single pieces rival real for star places in the bay that never make mistakes and offer you 2 pieces per order. I really regret not sticking up for myself and and ordering individual pieces over the omikase which the other members of my party picked. What is really messed up is that they have no set price for the omikase even at the end everything is individually priced u may as well order individually or the just order for u and all one piece at a time. I work hard all week I dont like to eat one piece every 15 minutes as my end of week reward. \nAnd of course we get the one white chef, listen I am white I am a restaurant worker I am not trying to be prejudice, but I like a traditional feel from my experience and a white guy who tells me how he learned to prepare sushi by working there and never had any formal culinary training is pretty disappointing considering what they were charging. I also like to my sushi chef to act a certain way. Dancing around and doing the madonna vogue dance when a bad eighties pop song comes on is incredibly disappointing to me and if you dance like this in front of patrons your taste cant be good.\nI order a side of rice from the hot food waitress she never brings it, but of course I get charged for it.\nThe fish selection wasnt impressive, Most had mediocre fresh flavors, I hate when they sear the top i dont understand the point unless its eel, it just makes it taste fishier. They sear a piece of steak for one course and drape it over rice and call it sushi I dont think it is. Its not even tasty. They dont give u wasabi or soy sauce here...I dont even know what to say about that. I dont especially like pickled ginger but I ended up eating three stacks because they sushi comes out so damn slow.\nHonestly the best part of the meal is the chef choice skewers we got that wasnt on the omikase menu all that stuff was real good. Also the toro we requested as our last piece of fish was excellent although we had to pick it for the chef who didnt figure to include it our omikase naturally. which makes me seriously question his judgement. \nI could really get into the individual pieces but whats the point. These new hip hop playing fusion spots without any real interior design or traditional sushi  values really turn my stomach even when the bad quality fish doesn't. \nI told my fellow patrons they never get to pick the friday night restaurant again if they expect me to roll with them. I honestly just dont get spending money like this on such a weak experience. I just dont get this town sometimes and what the citizens of it are willing to except....", "author": "Bob C."}

We had a resy for 9:30 and arrived on time, but had to wait about 15 minutes for 2 spaces to open up at the sushi bar. With open seats at the Ni bar in the back this didn't bother us one bit as we sat drinking a pint of Hitachino until a spot opened up at the Ichi bar. The atmosphere is more trendy than traditional, but the sushi although modernized with their spin isn't just hype. This is not your traditional Japanese sushi place, so traditionalists would probably not like it, but if you want a modernized spin on sushi then Ichi fits the bill. I also respect that they don't give you soy sauce and a bunch of wasabi at the sushi bar so you can make some horrendous concoction of wasabi soy sauce to overpower your sushi. People who are complaining about how the sushi chefs want you to eat the sushi the way they have prepared it make me laugh. You want to dress up your crunchy roll go to another spot. \n\nWe started with a cucumber salad and ordered a bottle of Hakkaisan Junmai Ginjo Sake. Every piece of nigiri hit the spot and the combination of flavors and creativity are on point. Our sushi chef Eric walked us through about 12 different pieces of nigiri and one piece of cod collar. I would say the only piece that missed the mark was the tako (octopus), it was a little tough which can be common in octopus if you don't work it before you prepare it. Since dinner resys are hard to come by, I never understand the people that come to a sushi place and order california rolls and chicken teriyaki. The people wearing their scarves inside sitting next to us kept glaring at all the assorted cuts of fish the sushi chef was handing to us feeling jelly that they went with the california roll.", "author": "Anthony V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-07-01", "description": "Reading reviews here it is hard to know what about many restaurants that attract the diverse and contentious crowd of people who might later post their thoughts on Yelp. Nonetheless, wading through the absolutist partisans and enemies of a place like this one is left with a certain amount of anxiety, even fear; can ANY place live up to the expectations - positive or negative - expressed on a forum like this? I doubt it.\n\nIn any case, we dived in, sitting at the bar and going for a joy ride. Our chef (in the station next to the boss man), was amiable, solicitous, and seemingly competent. He asked us if we had any things we wouldn't want to miss or anything we particularly didn't want, and then proceeded to produce a fairly steady stream of nigiri from the fish under the glass in front of us. \n\nWithout referencing any other sushi venue in the city, or indeed without mentioning any sushi place I have ever been anywhere, and even without worrying about anything that the restaurant's owners might or might not have said about the food, their concept, or anything else, but just letting the seafood and rice speak for itself, we can pronounce ourselves fairly satisfied with the experience, and left  with a good taste in our mouths, happy to have taken the time to visit the place.\n\nOn the plus side, the fish, scallops, and shrimp we had were served in pretty interesting ways, tasted fresh, and while not truly plentiful in portion, were not stingy, either; the drinks service was conscientious and, as mentioned, the sushi chef was attentive and eager to please. There was lots of good tasting sushi.\n\nOn the down side, much of the sushi, despite being fish of different species, for instance, all tasted the same. It is really hard to understand this given that I have never experienced this anywhere else. I have to wonder if it is not somehow a function of the drive to make of the experience eating here some kind of ritual of sushi \"purity\", whatever that might be. Our chef offered in passing when setting down our first nigiri that it was \"seasoned the way it was supposed to be\" or something similar; of course, since we had heard that Ichi does not brook the use of extra wasabi and soy sauce, this aside was absorbed without comment, and even with some pleasurable anticipation. But the fact is that all the effort then to make the sushi \"special\" really just boiled down to applying a fairly narrow range of seasonings (including various ponzu concoctions, a number of spicy or salty condiments, etc. - and none of them bad, mind you) to whatever fish was on hand, without, it seemed, any particular thoughtfulness about why that particular combination might be especially apt. \n\nOur conclusion was that in a perhaps misguided attempt to pursue something like \"perfection\" the concept of honest ingredients of the highest possible quality was somehow distorted by a penchant for novelty for its own sake. Our chef was, as far as we could tell, following a playbook as rigid as that which controls every action of a burger flipper at Mickey D's; instead of a spontaneous interaction between the chef, the materials, and us, we got a fussy, preset packaging of the fish of the day which ultimately produced something akin to mass production, even though, I will happily add, it was all pretty darn good.\n\nWe thought that perhaps by combining this level of passion and skill with something less self-conscious and more open-hearted, this place really might have a chance of becoming the \"best\" sushi place in the City, whatever that means instead of a 3+ star novelty with potential...", "author": "Ken K."}

He went into detail with every nigiri that he served and he answered most of our questions, and really friendly too! The reason why I'm giving them two stars is because the service wasn't that great, the place didn't even have a sign that says Ichi Sushi + Ni bar, and we got double charged with two of the food that we ordered.

Ichi clearly aspires to be a cut above your average strip-mall soy sauce & wasabi california roll factory.  Its a noble goal.  Sadly, they fall pretty short.    Upon entering, my first impression was a strong sense of deja-vu.  The layout felt very chipotle-esque.  It can be quite charming, if somewhat uncomfortable, when the entire staff of a japanese restaurant shouts out greetings in unison.  Honestly, it just feels like they're trying way too hard when a dozen white people do this in Japanese.  Of course, this is all relatively trivial in comparison to the food.  Good food goes a long way.  Unfortunately, the sushi was pretty disappointing.  Flavors tended to be heavy handed, often unbalanced, and all too often totally overwhelmed the fish.  The fish was, at times, of inconsistent texture - soft at one end, a bit chewy at the other.  Honestly, I had low, albeit hopeful, expectations at the outset.  SF is not known as a great sushi destination.  Generally speaking, I like what they are trying to do here.  I just dont think that they're doing it particularly well.  They certainly arent delivering much value at this price point.  Take my advice - save your money, make reservations at Kuskabe and prepare for a truly inspired japanese meal.", "author": "Alex L."}

The first time we ate there was a year ago and we brought a friend who was visiting from LA. We had such a good experience and the food was tasty and memorable. This new visit however was memorable for far different reasons. We did not have a reservation, but arrived right when they opened and there was already and hour and 45 minute wait, so the less than hospitable hostess asked if we would like to sit at the bar. We decided yes, but she told us we could not order nigiri at the bar...when we asked why she didn't really seem sure herself. So we sat at the bar anyway and ordered away! The  bartender took our order down (in her head) then came back twice to review our order with us, she apologized and exclaimed \"Sorry I am on a lot of dayquil right now.\" That was an off-putting and confusing response. We also asked her why we couldn't order nigiri at the bar and she said \"because the sushi bar can't keep up with the orders.\" \n\nThe food took ages to come to our table and finally we asked our dayquil sedated bartender if our sushi was coming..She then ran to the sushi bar to get it and gave it to us. We asked for some soy sauce and she said ok, then started pouring drinks and completely ignored us. We each took a bite and nearly spit it up. If you have ever eaten warm sushi it isn't a pleasant taste. We immediately asked her if it had been sitting out for a while because it was warm and she insanely replied, \"I don't know, I can't see through the wall.\" I can honestly go on and on about how terrible the service was, the lack of hospitality, and the lack of deliciousness from the food, but I think it is quite clear this was a less than average dining experience. The tattooed inhospitable bartender needs to really be taught a lesson in service and overall decent hospitality skills.  \n\nI feel bad that ICHI has taken a turn for the worse, because it is such a rad place in a great location and my first memory was a great one. \n\nHospitality is everything and there was none at all. I hope ICHI is able to instill a sense of hospitality in their employees because no matter how good the food is, the service will always have a far lasting affect on people. People always remember how a restaurant made them feel, and they made us feel terrible.\n\nI absolutely hate writing bad reviews, but it was an experience I wish I could forget.

No worries, it's California, and good food usually translates.\nSo, my wife, son and I got the last table at the bar and grill area. Unlike most 5-8 year olds, my son loves himself some Sushi, but we were told by the server that the bar side he couldn't have anything from the sushi menu, as the Sushi chefs were too busy, and they don't serve that menu on this side of the restaurant.  Fine, I said, we'll order from that menu, but I asked if I can I get a sheet of Nor for my son to use with his rice, so that he can be placated by 'rolling his own' rice and seaweed maki with a sheet of nori, while his mom and dad enjoy an adult night out at the same time? Nope, says the restaurant... not allowed. \nDespite the fact we are about to drop $200 on a meal, the management wouldn't budge on the kid-friendly aspect of giving my kid a sheet of seaweed from the sushi bar... the waitress asked the manager, the manager said \"no\". So, after a quick deliberation, we decided that we'd try a more kid flexible place. Just as we were leaving, they finally served us a beer we had put an order in for earlier. We refused it, as we had decided to leave.  They gave us problems, asking us to pay for the beer.  At this point, I just let them know that we didn't want it, and we were leaving. The manager stopped me on the way out, and engaged with me about our leaving... it was way more conflict-y than I would have wanted, and not kid friendly.  I usually don't place a premium on service, but when it's this bad, I have to.

Go eat tea sandwiches with your mom somewhere else if it's too loud.\n2) Erik. Effin. Marinovich. He did the mural. Yeah, that mural.\n3) Freshest fish in town!\n4) Best sushi chefs you can find (yeah, that means you Erik!)\n5) The staff is accommodating and there to help you. Hats off to Shasta for holding it together!\n6) In every piece of sushi/sashimi you can taste the freshness of the fish - regardless of what they add to the fish, be it yuzu, soy, scallions, ginger, etc. You taste the FISH in all of it's amazing glory.\n7) Best fish collars. For days.\n8) The chef/owner Tim comes out and greets us. He's awesome. Maybe even super awesome.\n9) They got Almanac to brew them a signature beer. A bay-area beer-brewing darling makes ICHI a special beer! Awww yeah.\n10) They make all the other sushi joints seem overpriced for what those other joints offer.\n\nThere you have it. 10 points for the ten stars they deserve. If you think they're too expensive or too fancy or too loud or too pretentious or too anything other than awesome then go somewhere else.", "author": "Eric M."}

The folks who run the place are some of the sweetest I know, and the chefs are incredibly talented. \n\nMy boyfriend and I made a reservation, and were super excited to see the new space. When we showed up, the group ahead of us was just wrapping up so the hostess suggested we have a drink at the bar while we wait. No biggie. The server at the bar was helpful in recommending a sake and we had the Ichi beer, which was full of flavor but refreshing, as well. Then, we went a little crazy ordering from the bar menu: clams, eggplant, chicken wings, cold somen. Everything sounded delicious. I had to remind my bf that we still had omakase to make room for. He was undeterred. He said we could do it. \n\nOur table at the sushi bar opened up more quickly than we anticipated and before our dishes arrived at the bar in the back. But, the hostess said that they'd get delivered to us at the sushi bar and helped us with our drinks. The seating at the sushi bar is a little squishy but not uncomfortably so. Perhaps the people next to us were just taking over more than their allotted space. Either way, it was cozy, in a good way, for the two of us. \n\nOur sushi chef, Daniel, introduced himself. We told him we wanted omakase, that we eat any and everything, and that we had ordered a bunch of dishes from the bar already. He said no problem; he'll take good care of us. Then, the influx of food came -- one dish at a time so not overwhelming. The clams with pork was amazing. I wanted a bigger bowl of that. I would eat that all day. The grilled eggplant was super flavorful. The chicken wings were tender and juicy. For the sushi, I can't remember all of what we had because we had so much but the standouts were the scallop (incredibly sweet and buttery), the shrimp two ways (raw body on rice and fried head on the side -- the fried head was delicious; I wish more places served fried shrimp head), and the uni (amazing how something can taste so much like the sea). I was stuffed. I couldn't even eat the last complimentary piece that Daniel put in front of us. \n\nEverything we had was delicious, exquisitely prepared, and all the nigiri had the right balance of warm rice and cool, perfectly seasoned seafood. I would put a bite in my mouth and just let it sit there for a second before chewing and savoring the flavors and textures. My boyfriend, who I was a little concerned about since he likes dunking his sushi in soy sauce with lots of wasabi, was beyond okay in trusting Daniel. He didn't ask for soy sauce or wasabi, and enjoyed each bite. That's a huge win. \n\nAnd, as for the price, it was totally reasonable for how much we ate and drank. So, for the quality and creativity of the food and the attentive but not overbearing service, Ichi is on the top of my list of sushi places in SF.", "author": "Susan T."}

The restaurant is a dark grey room, bar stools where cheap and uncomfortable and crammed together. The service was just ok. Sake and beer selection was no-existent (not even any Nigori)..Very loud, so could barely hear what the chef was handing me.  I must have asked him to repeat himself 10 times....Oysters were overpriced and way to salty...Bring back the Kumamoto oysters..Overall, i would never go back to Ichi, its kinda lost its charm...Its just another SF sushi bar now......", "author": "John S."}

The progression was thoughtful and tasteful, culminating in an unbelievable dessert. Highlight was the crab chawanmushi. But also loved the gindara on parsnip pur\u00e9e. The prawn with pickled cukes comes to mind too.  Loved the yuzu sake that was served just before the yummy dessert. Chef Erik outdid himself. What a perfect way to ring out 2014.", "author": "Linda A."}

I could go on and on, but suffice it to say that this is - hands down - the best sushi place in the city.  Freshest fish, dishes that allow the diner to really experience the taste of the fish, not dress it up with gross mayo sauces or hose it down with soy sauce.  Be prepared to let the food melt in your mouth. The cocktails and sake are great.  The customer service is friendly, accommodating, and everything I want and need a San Francisco mom and pop to be.  And the prices are absolutely reasonable and a great value for the flavors and fun ambience.  I highly suggest gettin' crazy with the Omakase style and let the chef choose your dishes for you.  During my second visit, we gave the server a per person budget and threw out some favorite fish and flavors of ours. The dinner that followed was extraordinary and, of course, exactly what we were willing to spend.  Plus we learned a lot about dishes that we didn't know before and were served new items that we wouldn't have ordered on our own but are now new favorites.  See what I mean?  A total experience.", "author": "Kim Lan G."}

This place is a pure rep of gentrification right here. Food is clean, no doubt. But waaaay over priced and nothing crazy mind blowing original. I spent almost$120 for two of us. Full of white folks, with no neighborhood rep whatsoever. And that says something. I had to check to white girls from getting in line at opening bc they thought they could  cut  bc \"they had reservations\"... that kinda place.  We ordered the house ichibier  ($6), maguro and hamchi  nigiri, chicken wings ($9.50)- beef tataki (14.50)- pork belly (11.50)... cali roll (6.75)... mostsu nikomi (tripe and short rib) ( 11. 75)... tataki we order one Skewer of pork shoulder (3.75) and one Skewer of flank stea (3.75)... seriously everything was good. But really NOT GREAT. To.much cash for the what it is. I would come to just try nigiri and short ribs dish. The service was dope but food took foooorever to come out. Im bummed. Thats a lot of cash to spend on a dinner.", "author": "Amber M."}

There were empty tables and we were still told the wait would be an hour. I guess they were honoring reservations even though they didn't all come in. We waited at the bar, and the bartender was awesome - cute, sophisticated and personable, and also helpful with suggestions. Around an hour later, we were offered two seats at the sushi bar. It was well worth the wait. The sushi was delicious and not overpriced. The manager came by and asked how we were doing and apologized for the wait. We didn't have a reservation, so we were fine with waiting. The sushi chef was entertaining and friendly as well. I look forward to returning again - with a reservation!", "author": "Gina R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-06-12", "description": "Had a very good meal here, ordered Omakase, which is apparently the way to go.  I would concur since many of the sushi we received, I would have never known to order. \nOff the hot menu, the chicken wings, were dry and none of us got what the big deal was. They need some sort of sauce to compliment and the beef, was just ok.  Next time I think I'll try the pork belly and the clams, my friends weren't into either.  \nWe went on a Tuesday at 5:30pm because that was the only time we could get a reservation.  I was baffled during our whole dinner why Open Table said they were so booked and when we called the restaurant directly to see if we could get a 6pm reservation they couldn't accommodate us, but during the entire length of our dinner, at least 2 hours, there were open tables all around us.  I think the hype of it being the best sushi restaurant in the city maybe just that, hype.\nHowever, the food was good and the service excellent with a nice looking space and vibe.  I will go back.  Especially since it's down the street from where I live.", "author": "Anne S."}
