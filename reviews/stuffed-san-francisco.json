It's like a divey restaurant if that's a thing so don't come here expecting a nice ambiance because you're not gonna get that. This is a no frills sort of establishment where the main seating is bar seating, so come in with an open mindset. :)\n\nStuffed is a one man show churning out pirogies and polish sides. I have learned that they used to make the pirogies fresh and on the spot but it looks like now they make them in the morning, store them in a warmer, and then pan fry them as they are ordered. \n\nThe food is pretty cheap I'd say! Each one is $4 or you could get the meal sizes (2,3, or 4 pirogies with 2 sides for $10, $14, $17 respectively) and they are hearty sized and filling!\n\nI decided to get the 2 pirogies and 2 sides deal for $10 and chose borscht (a polish soup) and cucumber salad for my sides. The borscht was really good and the two friends I was with agreed! It was light and heartwarming, with large notes of dill). For my pirogies I ordered the jalape\u00f1o and the spinach & feta I believe. They were SO good - really filling from the potato and flavorful, with saut\u00e9ed onions on top, adding a nice touch. They also were nice and crispy from the pan sear. The jalape\u00f1o one definitely had a nice kick! I'll be back to try the mushroom one and the avocado one as those were sold out. \n\nSubtracting one star for service. One of my friends didn't get the borscht she ordered until we reminded them and both had to remind about the beers they had ordered. Overall though, I'd recommend Stuffed as a simple spot to grab some hearty Polish grub at a good price point!", "author": "Sabina S."}

Dana the owner and Dwayne are gracious, lovely people.

I am glad Stuffed is back to doing what they do best; serving up delicious perogies in a chill spot! \n\nBy the way, perogies are NEVER made on the spot, anywhere...it is a labor intensive project; you have to make the dough, then you put in the filling and boil.

My grandma used to make them, my mom used to make them, my aunts used to make them etc.. We would eat them at least once every 2 weeks and they were always served for Christmas, weddings and all the important celebrations. You get the picture. I know what pierogis are. Stuffed pierogis don't really remind me of pierogis I grew up with. They are giant, tough and fried while Polish pierogis are always boiled and only if there are leftovers you may fry them the next day. I went to Stuffed 3 times over the past 2 years. The first time I thought that the food was decent and inexpensive. The second time is was passable but disappointing. The third time I knew I would never go back. The place is depressing, has the abandoned feeling to it and the food is not appetizing. Look at the very color of their borsch. It doesn't look like borsch and it doesn't taste like borsch. The pierogis' dough is tough and the stuffing combinations weird. The place doesn't feel Polish at all... It just feels like someone's afterthought. Maybe someone started it with good intentions but got bored quickly enough and moved on to better things. This place has no Polish spirit and its food doesn't give justice to Polish national cuisine, which, while executed properly, can be addictive and memorable.", "author": "ania w."}

I'm sure I've walked by this place over a dozen times in the past year it's been open, but I didn't take notice until it showed up on my Yelp app when I was looking for a late-ish dinner after work. I scratched my head since the address looked like it was on the same block as El Farolito next to the 24th Street BART station. Sure enough, it's right across the street in between two discount stores. It's a narrow space with a long counter and tables out in a sheltered patio (photo: http://bit.ly/1ryVbi5). There not a single soul in the place, not even the owner, but the minute I looked down at the menu, he came out of the darkness to take my order.\n\nI know what pierogis are - dumpling aficionado that I am - but I needed a refresher from the owner, especially how they make them. These are not the potato-cheese creations that you would expect to buy in a Krakow deli. No, these reflect the owners' Midwestern background as they are bigger and carry a broader variety of fillings like smoked salmon, bacon cheddar, goat cheese and spicy avocado sausage. I decided to take advantage of the $13 Two-Pierogi and Whole Sausage Meal with Mushroom and Jalape\u00f1o my two selections (photo: http://bit.ly/1zPFRR0). It was quite a plateful of food as it also included Sweet Purple Cabbage Slaw, Apple Sauerkraut and Cucumber Salad.\n\nIt was delicious comfort food especially with the caramelized onions strewn about, the split pork sausage juicy and spicy and a dollop of sour cream as a finishing touch (photo: http://bit.ly/1HZNW54).

I did chat a bit with co-owner Andrew Schoengrund since I was rather concerned the place was completely empty all the time I was there. He assured me weekends are busy when there's a game on. That's when I realized that this was not targeted to those looking for a full-fledged dining experience. Rather it's a destination for weekend warriors and club-hoppers looking for a quick bite.

The bottom line is that the pierogi were decent, but I had a few issues with the place.\n\nWe had four different kinds. The original (potatoes and cheese) were quite good and fairly close to what they should taste like. Those were served with onions and sour cream and had a nice soft texture. The cheddar and bacon pretty much tasted like what you would imagine, with the bacon flavor dominating. Those came with sour cream as well. Jalapeno pierogi were green in color, with a filling that was similar to potatoes and cheese, but had some fresh jalapenos blended in. Spicy and pretty good, but nothing traditional anymore in terms of Eastern European food. Finally, the blueberry pierogi were a good choice for desert and were served with a sweet mascarpone type of topping. One person commented that they tasted like the blueberry and dough did not go well together, which was a good point, but did not bother me. They were not too sweet.\n\nOn top of that, the Polish sausage was disappointing as it tasted more like a big hot dog than a real Polish sausage. The red beet soup (borscht) was pretty good and had pieces of shredded beet and some sour cream to lighten it blended in. A lot of the fresh salads that came as sides like red cabbage or cucumber were just ok.\n\nI had an excellent lemon ginger beer, I think it was a Radler, which I've never had before. It was surprisingly good. However, this brings me to the negatives. After a few minutes I noticed a fly floating around in my beer. Then I noticed several other ones flying around us. The place itself could use some decor and it looked like it could be bit cleaner.\n\nI would recommend Russian Renaissance on Geary instead for inexpensive Eastern European food.", "author": "Tim Z."}

So what better stuff to write about than the great stuff they serve at Stuffed!\n\nStuffed located on Mission Street near 24th Street serves up freshly made pierogies and other Polish inspired specialties.  I had them bookmarked on Yelp seemingly forever when I finally tried them last month.  I loved their food so much that I returned for more this weekend.  For those of you not in the know a pierogi is a dumpling usually boiled then either baked or fried consisting of a filling of mashed potatoes, meat and or vegetables.\n\nMy first encounter with the pierogi came many years ago in possibly the last place you'd expect.  Sold under the brand name \"Mrs. T's\" the little potato and cheese dumplings were boiled up and served to event participants at the finish line of the world famous Escape from Alcatraz Triathlon.  Served with a bit of marinara sauce and a dusting of parmesan cheese those little dumplings became a staple of mine in training for various races in which I took part in.  Finding the brand in my supermarket freezer became a bit of a chore though, and I eventually gave up looking and returned to more common pasta dishes for my carbo-loading and training ways.\n\nIt had been at least 10 years since I've had a real pierogi so I was excited.  I ordered the 2 pierogi meal with a jalapeno pierogi and a bacon cheddar one (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stuffed-san-francisco?select=FylvFlTVxWKZUqAhkKjDqg#QPaRawibu3D0ot_IG1rU5Q).  The pierogies come with a sweet red cabbage slaw and a very different and very delicious sauerkraut which incorporates apples and caraway seeds all sweetened with a bit of agave.  I got to choose between a creamy cucumber salad or a cold asparagus salad for which I chose the latter.  Everything on the plate blew me away.  I especially liked how the dumpling dough for the jalapeno pierogi was infused with jalapeno.  That was my favorite of the two.\n\nThis past weekend I happened to be in the neighborhood again for the Carnaval San Francisco parade, and after standing under the hot sun for 6 hours of Carnaval fun I immediately thought of Stuffed for a cold beer and more delicious pierogies.  Going with the theme for the day I ordered an icy cold Corona with lime and a 2 pierogi meal with the smoked salmon pierogi and the spicy avocado sausage pierogi (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/stuffed-san-francisco?select=FylvFlTVxWKZUqAhkKjDqg#FylvFlTVxWKZUqAhkKjDqg).  My salad choice for the day was the bell pepper broccoli salad.  Once again I enjoyed everything on the plate but I found I liked the spicy avocado pierogi with its smooth potato and avocado puree and chunks of sausage even more than the jalapeno one.\n\nStuffed offers delicious pierogies in many varieties including a blueberry dessert one that is served only during the dinner hours.  They also began pickling their own vegetables just a few weeks ago.

We quickly ordered a couple of their pierogis.  Once we ordered we were told we could sit anywhere which we did.  They have a couple of board games available if you wanted to play which is kinda nice.  There were only 2 people working that night.  One being the waiter/cashier and the other being the cook/dishwasher.  It wasn't very crowded...just a couple of 2 people parties other than ourselves.  The waiter was pretty friendly despite forgetting to give us water, utensils, and the drinks we ordered.  \n\nWe ordered the mushroom and cheese, bacon and cheddar, spicy sausage and avocado, and traditional pierogis with the strawberry pierogi for dessert.  The dishes came with purple slaw, apple sauerkraut, and a brussel sprout salad which were all interestingly flavored.  In my opinion, the best pierogi was the bacon and cheddar.  It definitely had the most flavor other than the strawberry dessert pierogi.  In my opinion, the other pierogis lacked flavor and were very heavy.", "author": "Christine D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-05-12", "description": "I wanted to love this place more than I did. I had been wanting to come here for a while, and then finally made it here, but don't think I'll become a regular of this place. It's located right on 24th and Mission, across from El Farolito, so it's pretty easy to get to via BART or the 14. There's a few tables outside, a few tables inside, and a bar area with stools and 2-3 TVs. Expect a casual meal here and for music to be playing fairly loud (sounds more like a bar than a restaurant) - this probably wouldn't be my pick for a first date since it's a little bit loud and dingy, but fine for a group of 2-4 people (based on the seating available here).\n\nYou can choose between the 2 pierogies meal ($10), 3 ($15), or 5 ($20), and each comes with purple slaw, apple sauerkraut, and a salad or soup. There are a lot of different flavors of pierogis, maybe around 10-12 different kinds, including 2 dessert ones (at least as of May 2016). I'm sure the flavors rotate, and there are certainly some unconventional flavors, both for the filling and the dough. If you haven't had a pierogi before, it's like a giant dumpling that is filled with usually potato and cheese and partly steamed / mostly pan-fried. They are not really the healthiest for you, but it's good comfort food on a cold night and pairs well with the sauerkraut and sour cream. They have some interesting flavors like cream cheese & salmon, bacon, potato & cheese, avocado and sausage in a spicy jalapeno dough, spinach and mushroom in a spinach dough. The dessert ones they had were blueberry and a sweet potato one. \n\nTo be honest, the one that I liked was the traditional one, as you can't go wrong with dough, potato and cheese, with fried onions on top. I also got the spicy one with avocado and sausage and thought it was a bit of a weird combo. My boyfriend said this one was his favorite. I also got the spinach and mushroom one but it was a bit bland.\n\nBeers are $5 - they have 5-6 kinds of tap, and bottled beer. The soup they had was borscht, which was a beet soup which was interesting but not a must-have. The cucumber salad was mixed with sour cream and tiny - like smaller than a little scoop of ice cream - maybe the equivalent to 1.5 tablespoons.\n\nWe chose to eat inside at the bar to catch the Warriors game, but I don't know where we were sitting had a ton of beer residue from the taps, but there were fruit flies everywhere. In between bites and mid-conversation, we kept on swatting fruit flies away from our food and from trying to take a swim in our beer. My boyfriend said he thought he may have eaten one in the midst of everything. Not to be mean, but I almost felt like I was eating in a trash can with so many things flying around me. \n\nAll in all, if you want pierogis or polish food, this is a good place. It's definitely not one of my favorite places in the city to eat, but I'm glad I tried it. It's fairly inexpensive and pretty filling (actually the food is pretty heavy), but if I went back, I'd get takeout.", "author": "Christina L."}

I read about all their problems with getting the correct permits, the delays of their opening date, etc. so I have sympathy for them. Opening a new business is never easy and I know there are issues to be worked out. \n\nI came here on a Sunday and they were offering 5 different pierogis: Bacon & Cheddar, Buffalo, Mushroom & Spinach, Original, and the Salmon & Cream Cheese. We tried one of each and our total was $18, without drinks. We didn't get any beer because none of the beer is on tap and I have bottled beer at home so it's rare for me to want to have bottled beer in a restaurant. \n\nMy favorite pierogi by far was the bacon & cheddar, but this is because it actually had some savory flavor to it. The rest were REALLY lacking some savoriness to actually makes this comfort food comforting. I appreciated the attempt with the buffalo, but it had too much saltiness from the buffalo sauce and the blue cheese--too many strong flavors in one without balance. The others: mushroom, original, and salmon were unfortunately kind of bland. Many of the choices came with some lightly saut\u00e9ed onions on top of the dumpling. I liked the translucency of the onions, but my boyfriend said it was just as if they were going to caramelize them, but took them out of the pan too early, but I suppose that is a matter of preference. \n\nBeyond the food not being what I expected, there were some issues I had with the set up of the restaurant. There were some tables outside that had regular chairs, but many of the other tables had stools that were uncomfortably high for the height of the table. If you sat on the stool your knees would ram right into the table top. Not comfortable and it makes for  a messy mealtime. Also, not all the tables had silverware/napkins on them and there was no central area where you would get them for yourself. This just makes it confusing. Is it okay if we take it from a different table? Should we move the whole container of silverware to our table?

My baby by the way greatly enjoyed the pierogi! I cut it up to small pieces and they were perfect for her toothless tastebuds.\n\nWhen later my friends ordered dessert as an add on, the staff forgot about it until we reminded them at the end.

I realize that right outside at 24th and mission some citizen was loudly and obnoxiously exercising their right to free speech. I realize the employee was probably trying to drown out the noise from outside. When I asked him to turn down the \"music\" he smirked at me but did so. Then we had the pleasure of his conversation with a female employee who used either the word f*** or s*** in every sentence. And they could not tell a chicken pierogi from a salmon pierogi. Don't order the polish sausage either. They smother it in american mustard (probably French's brand). I am polish and I don't know one polish person who would do that to a polish sausage.

We made reservations and arrived Saturday night to only one dude working in the entire restaurant. Thus, we set up our own table (which consisted of chairs of varying heights and comfort), fetched our own glasses, etc. This wasn't a big deal at all, it was just odd how there was literally only one dude working here. And when you make a reservation, you kinda expect there to be a table set up.\n\nFor what we then realized was a self-service dive (don't get me wrong- some of my favorite places are dives), it was then odd how it took about an hour to receive our food. You come to a place like this expecting to be in and out quickly - especially when you're not receiving any service / are quenched for thirst due to the lack of clean glasses in the restaurant and the poor dude working doesn't have time to both cook your food and wash the glasses. \n\nWhen it finally arrived, the food was good (the cheddar bacon one was our fave) but nothing at all to rave about. Kinda tasted like cafeteria food which was disappointing after waiting for so long.\n\nI have no complaints about the dude working there - for being the only person there, he held down the place pretty well.

I'm a huge fan of the mushroom, bacon-cheddar and avocado-sausage ones. The smoked salmon was tasty if you like salmon, but I'm not sure if I'm a fan of it in pierogi form. If you have a sweet tooth, you MUST try the blueberry dessert pierogi too.\n\nThe only downside is that you can't just order a ton of pierogis.

I like to support local businesses; not because I feel sorry for them, but because they make great food and treat you like family and I do think it helps their business to Yelp it.\n\nI read the negative reviews for this place, and ask you to consider the people who wrote them. Have they been to the restaurant multiple times? Did they have preconceived notions about what they wanted? Do they seem like someone you would want to share a table with or are generally help, well-adjusted individuals? I think I have an idea for my next screenplay. \n\nNow to the food *not for thought*. I came here without knowing what a pierogi was, and was foolishly expecting a filling and meat-heavy piroshki-like experience. So I avoided it for a while, and of course I was wrong. These babies are light and not too greasy, yet they absorb alcohol well (for your hangovers). The flavors range from very powerful (the buffalo, which is too powerful for me) to very subtle (I like the goat cheese the best). Avocado and mushroom are both good choices. I haven't tried the bacon one yet, as I don't eat very much pork. In the end, I think all of them are pretty good and just different enough to keep you coming back for more.\n\nMy favorite part is the the various toppings included with your meal. Both the asparagus and cucumber salads are really light and refreshing, mixing wonderfully with the flavor of any pierogi. The hummus and sour cream are fun. And, ooh! look! there is wonderful sauerkraut and sweet red cabbage finely chopped! They really tie it all together and make it so fun to eat. That's what Stuffed brings to the table; it's casual, lighthearted and hearty without being disgustingly filling. I actually don't feel that 'stuffed' if I just order 2 pierogis and call it a day. \n\nAs the neighborhood improves I think this place has the potential to become an institution. The owners, Andy and Dana, are there every night serving you personally with heart and soul. You get to watch them make the food right in front of you. Dana's dad bottles the wine. No techie vibe here. They are improving their menu and evolving, and I'm just so thankful to have something besides pizza and burritos to eat while I sit and drink my beer and watch the Nature Channel with my girlfriend on one of their two huge TV's.

Obviously I was, that's a ridiculous question. Don't even pretend like it would make you upset to eat a bacon and potato perogi. It would be like your birthday. Anyways, It was good perogies, like the kind your friend from Milwaukee or Chicago would have to resentfully admit was 'yeah, that's pretty good.'\n\nAnd they all seem like really nice and friendly people, but mostly, I really enjoyed eating those perogies.\n\nIf you like perogies, this is a place that for a relatively small sum of money, will give it to you so you can put in your face-hole.

You're more likely to run into Pablo here than Posey.\n\nThis restaurant has set itself up in the middle of a smallish setup, similar in dimension to many of the taquerias around here. \n\nIt has a pleasant patio area outside, with tables. Inside there is a long counter stretching the length of the restaurant where you can chill and chat to the owner and other pierogi lovers. \n\nThere's only a single table inside at the back which can seat a family comfortably. \n\nCouple of TV's playing whatever and Indy background music. Sets of handmade dominos litter the counter. Nearly beat my missus for the first time. Lost by 2 points.\n\nThe booze menu is limited and cheap. Got myself a $2 miller, I think it was, but could've splurged on a PBT ( in honor of their Midwestern roots). Which brings us to the food..\n\nThey wanted to try something which they hadn't seen in SF, which they found in pierogi. While in Poland you can't go a mile without running into a pierogerria, this is the only one I've seen here.\n\nAnd they're not bad. The flavors run an epic gamut from more traditional ones like potato cheese ones to weird ones like salmon. They sell them in plates of 2 or 3 including a salad\n\nThey are larger than I've seen in Poland but they were tasty. Some were a little thicker than others, which comes with hand making.\n\nWhere this place is truly outstanding is in the salads. The plates come with a choice of salads and from the coleslaw to the sauerkraut, these are truly great. So much so we bought some to take home.\n\nWorth a visit in your gastronomic hunts.", "author": "Pantera W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-03", "description": "Just went to this place for a friend's birthday this past weekend (1/31/15), so we ordered several types of pierogi, the cheddar bacon and the buffalo pierogis being my favorites.  The borscht was good too.\n\nWhat was really lacking was the quality of service.  They were understaffed.  We had one guy come take our drink orders, then another person came later to make recommendations, then the guy came back with some drinks, only to find that he forgot one drink order.  Then the other person came back with the missing beer, then the other guy came with another beer that the other person already covered.  They didn't communicate with each other because it seems there were only two folks doing the order and servicing.  The food took awhile to get doled out...we ordered at least 6 plates of different pierogis...which was fine because it gave everyone in the party to mingle and chit chat.  But with dishes all coming out at different times, is was hard for folks to wait for the particular pierogis they really wanted.  There was no thought about presentation, and it thinking back, it was like going to a cafeteria.\n\nSo ultimately, if you're looking for quality food, and it's just you or a small party, and go here knowing that service will be spotty (the servers were always polite and accommodating...they just need more of them), then I think you'll enjoy the experience.  However, if you're looking for a full service, decent food presentation and you're in a larger group, I'd pass.  It's good, but the whole experience was ok.  The place is setup like a big \"greasy spoon\" sorta diner, with seats at the counter and tables only outside.  This is more divey than a quality sit-down/full service sorta place...very casual attire.  I would give TWO stars, but staff was pleasant, so they get THREE starts from me.", "author": "Kona L."}

We instantly thought of something like Thanksgiving dinner. Stuffed is a word that equates to feeling like we just had the most epic meal of our lives and not only are we now so slated that we can't move, but also, that the journey there was totally worth it. Let me tell you, our expectations were not let down.\n\nI know what you're thinking: What the hell is a PIEROGI? I thought the same thing when I decided to try this random food I've never heard of. The menu seems a little intimidating  when you first walk in because you don't quite know what you're ordering. But...salmon, mushrooms, bacon, and cheese. You can't go wrong with any of those. We asked Andy, the manager, for a recommendation and he said, without hesitation: \"mushroom pierogi and salmon pierogi.\" But then Dana, the owner, chimed in with, \"Don't forget the bacon and cheddar pierogi!\" \nSo we ordered two of each. They arrived in front of us in under ten minutes with a side of hummus and sour cream for each basket. As we took our first daring bite of the salmon pierogi, it was something we can only compare to a giant ravioli?... Actually, it's utterly incomparable to other foods. It was a flavor blast that instantly put a smile on our face. We thought for sure that the salmon pierogi had to be the best one. And then we tried the mushroom pierogi. And then we tried the bacon cheddar pierogi. Even now, we can't tell you which is our favorite. We were dumbfounded that something we had never even heard of could be so good. It's like never hearing of pizza and trying it for the first time. \n\nThe atmosphere in this bar-styled restaurant was so easy going and chill that it was easy to try something new while enjoying an Anchor Steam / Blue Moon, while casually trying things off the menu. \n\nHighly recommend this restaurant. By the end, we were most certainly STUFFED. We'll be back tomorrow for more, because there is still more PIEROGIES to try. \n\nThose who dare...benefit greatly!", "author": "Jason N."}

We tried the traditional, bacon, salmon and mushroom (bacon was the best). Nearly $30 for lunch for 2, and we were still hungry afterwards.\n\nMake the pierogis bigger if you're going to charge $4-5+/per pierogi (they come in orders of 2-3 with a tiny side of slaw or kraut).

Service was friendly and quick.\n\nMy dinner group got a mix of different pierogi. I didn't think that I would like the salmon pierogi, but it actually ended up being my favorite! The salmon is not overwhelming with a fishy flavor, and the dough is delicious and warm. A close 2nd favorite was the goat cheese and spinach one. \n\nI definitely felt satisfied after two pierogi, but it was so good that I went ahead and ate the third one.", "author": "Ellie M."}

The Pierogi was good and the beer was just as good. Reminded me of being back in some humble joint in Chicago. No pretentious SF attitudes here, just good food and beer. \n\nI can also say that I was so stoked, I bought everyone in the bar a beer... twice. It's not really that big of a deal considering beer is midwest cheap. A tall boy (24) of Pabst is only $4. I can't think of any place that's cheaper than this. \n\nService was fantastic and there were friendly faces all around. It's nice to be in a place that's down to earth, friendly and homey. This is the place your drunk Polish grandpa would go to hang out with his friends after work had it existed years ago, but hey you can still bring your drunk Polish grandpa here!

Sadly, Stuffed is not all that great. It's not even that particularly good. We tried the mushroom one, which is beyond bland, and the bacon one. The bacon one was flavorful, only because bacon has such a strong flavor by itself, it's hard to miss. Not only were they bland, but the dough is kinda chewy and hard in some places. These bad boys are pricey too, 3 of them for $13! Ouch. And is you want the salmon one then it's 3 for $15.", "author": "Elysia D."}

It nails traditional polish Pierogi dishes for hardcore purists but it also has new unique takes on the pierogi idea: like avocado and salsa, salmon, jalapenio, mushroom. All Polish people living in the Bay Area should try pierogi at Stuffed. You won't be disappointed fellow Poles. The owners are super friendly and they like to share their story. Even though they are not Polish, they nailed the dumpling experience. On another note, the layout and decor leave space for improvement and the music selection could be better but, these are just minor details. Overall, delicious homemade, and hearty meal.", "author": "Monika B."}
