The fried rolls were ok, they came piping hot so be careful!  The sauce that came with it tasted like something I could get at the local Chinese market, so nothing fantastic.\n\nHowever the BBQ pork and the curry?? To die for!  Both dishes taste just like how my mom makes it at home.  There's a dipping sauce that I'm sure the base is a mixture of soy and fish sauce that goes perfect with the pork.  And the red curry... excellent!  The chicken was so tender and the curry was do flavorful and service with bamboo and bell peppers.  The only thing that was missing were Thai eggplant and potatoes.  Definitely reminds me of my moms home cooking.  And the rice came in a silver metallic container, very legit.  \n\nI'm definitely coming back and definitely recommending this place for everyone!", "author": "Nyla K."}

Most recently, I've been a fan of their garlic fried rice, which is so simple yet tasty!  They also have a new roti appetizer with a curry dipping sauce (with a variety of flavor options to choose from)- I tried it with the yellow curry sauce and thought it was amazing!   I'm also a fan of their saut\u00e9ed dishes, and a recent favorite was their cashews with crispy chili.

As soon as we walked in, we didn't feel welcomed at all. There was only one more patron waiting for a take out order, and the rest of the restaurant was empty. Maybe that is why we got such poor service from the waitress. First, when I ordered my drink, a Heineken, she clearly lied about being out of it, and \"forced\" me to buy the imported beer that was more expensive. Then, after serving our meals, she never came back to see if we needed anything extra, and when I tried to get her attention to get an extra napkin, she ignored me and pretended she couldn't hear me; so I ended grabbing one from the next table. And after that, she just came to tell us that they were closing in 10 mins., which \"forced\" us to swallow the other half of the plate and drink very fast, giving me a slight stomach age. Lastly, she came with a bill that we had requested to split in half and which she hadn't split, and my friend had to pull out a calculator, and with taxes the cents amount came with a .2 followed by several digits that rounded up to .3 cents; but the waitress was rounding the amount up to the closest fifth cent, which my friend started to say it was incorrect. And he had a good point. A principle is broken because they steal cents from every single customer every day that in a year it adds up to hundreds. And that's the same case when they lie about being out of domestic beer; they want to make more money by not giving you a choice of buying domestic beer. Needless to say, my friend didn't want to leave a tip and neither did I; but my friend paid with a $20 dollars bill, and got his change, while I paid with a credit card, and I guess because of that the waitress was definitely expecting a tip from me. But because I didn't give her one, she started to confront me in such an aggressive manner that I thought she was going to spit on my face or something like that. So, my friend and I got up and started exiting, and the waitress was so furious that she wished me a bad digestion because I mentioned her rushing us to finish our meals, and in her lunacy she came to close and slam the door behind us three times telling us all along that \"American people were very nice.\" I still wonder what she was referring to as \"American people\", if white people exclusively (since my friend and I are not), or maybe she was being sarcastic. For their food, I wouldn't say much either since I was pretty disappointed with their chicken in garlic sauce that didn't smell or taste like garlic at all.", "author": "Lyon B."}

We live across the street from Manivanh, and LOVE the food and service at this restaurant. It was 14 of us, the bday dinner was perfect, the service was amazing. My husband said it was the best birthday dinner he had. \n\nI called 3 days ahead to book the back room. Came 1 day ahead to give them our food choices. I asked guests to pick between the satay or chicken coconut soup, pad thai or fried rice, roasted duck basil, snapper with garlic sauce, or duck curry. These are our favorite dishes. We wanted our friends to try them. \n\nI dropped the bday cake, flowers, decorations, and name places the day of the party. My hubby and I showed up earlier and set up our music station, he used his bose speaker and phone to play his playlist. \n\nDinner was served on time, servers knew who ordered what, drinks kept coming (beer or wine only), the servers were able to bring food in and out seamlessly, until finally the birthday cake showed up. \n\nEveryone had a great time and really loved the food. The ambiance was so relaxed and homey, we were so comfortable and pampered there. Big THANKS to Ann and Po (spelling?) who made this dinner so successful.", "author": "SS s."}

I hate being that \"guy\" to walk into establishments with less than 30 min to closing so I called around & Manivanh answered.. with little hope in my head that the kitchen may still be willing to take an order for pickup. They kindly took my order with 20-25 min to close. I arrived with about 7min to close and there they had my food bagged up ready to go. Took it back home and was very satisfied and grateful for this late meal. \n\nThe next following day I was planning on dinner with my aunt whom is local to the mission. She suggested Manivanh. (Ha ha I just had it yesterday but I was super happy with the previous service from the night prior I had to say yes.) Service extremely friendly 2nd time around. Food was great I believe we ordered an assortment of prawn, chicken, & eggplant curry dishes. The prawns are plump & sauces are on point.\n\nToday about 3 months later I am writing as I just returned from a work trip in Europe. Manivanh my go to place for great service & food first came to mind. I felt the need to hit this place being back in the city. My new favorite \"sea food basil\" side of rice & Thai iced tea. Really great textures with all the seafood/shellfish being cooked well with the sauce/each other. In my opinion this place has perfect portions to feel full, but not that food coma state full where it hurts to walk. The staff has a down to earth friendly vibe that is calm not pushy.

After having recently dined here for dinner, I've realize that this is probably the most authentic tasting Thai that I've experienced in San Francisco. It is rather not that difficult to prepare decent tasting Thai dishes (which many places are able to achieve), yet easier to screw up with too much added sodium, or not enough spices that results in an ill-attempt and pure blandness (which A LOT of places are successful in doing). \n\nSadly, It actually feels like a novelty to have a restaurant elevate a simple red curry dish of bamboo shoots, saut\u00e9ed onions, and pork into something that is balanced and refined... because Thai in the Bay Area has recently become synonymous with such adjectives as quick, cheap, and easy.. yet unfortunately nothing else.  I didn't adjust the level of spice in the dish, because I always think that a good indicator of quality is how the spices actually work with the dish (which this does as it is perfectly infused), and I almost ALWAYS leave Thai places with leftovers but I literally licked my plate clean here because the quality was so spectacular.\n\nThe restaurant itself does not feel too crowded which I absolutely appreciate, is dimly lit, and is warmed up by the balsa wood panels on the walls, and the intricately carved teak reliefs.", "author": "Ty T."}

The food is outstanding.  It's no surprise that this special restaurant won a Bay Guardian award for Best Thai Restaurant in a Place You'd Least Expect To Find One!  Lunch time is crowded with hordes of San Francisco General Hospital staff descending so dinner is a better time to try it out for the first time.  \n\nManivanh is definitely a family affair, with Nang at the stove, Sam chopping and helping with food preparation and, at various times, the four daughters, and their partners lending a hand.  Their efforts results in a meal fit for a king...or queen....and every morsel is to be savored...Thai food at its best.\n\n2-21-08  UPDATE  This is still one of my favorite spots in the entire city - there are few other Thai restaurants I would even consider.  I saw someone said it had no ambiance - but I think it is a pretty nice, peaceful spot in the midst of the Mission hustle and bustle, with wooden carved Thai scenes, the shiny brass bowls, and the wood paneled walls.  \n   As for the staff, well, maybe because I've eaten there at least five hundred times ( maybe more ), they're like family to me - but I see them greet everyone warmly and, at least, half, by name.

I lived in Thailand for a fair stretch (both north and south) and actually paid the owners of a guesthouse I lived in for a month to let me work in the kitchen. In the long run, since I ate with the cooks, I saved money on meals and fast-tracked my Thai language and cooking skills. Highly recommended if you can swing it and don't mind being the target of nigh constant ribbing, ridicule and burns from hot oil spatters. \n\nAnyway, I ordered a broad range of dishes for take out: \n\npad kee mao gai (drunken noodles with chicken) - greasy lumpy noodle blob, short on basil and veggies, chicken so-so \n\nTom Yum Kung (spicy soup with shrimp) - they gave me Tom Kha Kung (coconut milk soup with shrimp) instead and it was... hmm, over oily and over cooked with none of the fragrance one hopes for in Tom Kha. Strong notes from the lime lives, galanga (not ginger), and lemongrass were expected but not detected. \n\nGai Pad Med Ma-Muang (cashew chicken) - pretty tasty though the sauce was thin and watery and a little on the generically \"brown\" flavored side. \n\nNeua Pad Bai Horapha (beef with basil) - lite on basil flavor, sauce tasted just like the cashew chicken sauce with a little basil thrown in. beef was iffy. \n\nThey did serve everything pretty spicy though (as I requested). I'm not entirely sure what impedes the serving of good Thai food in this town. Maybe there needs to be a better Thai to Mexico connection? Since, as we should all well know, 90% of the restaurant food in San Francisco is cooked by central americans. \n\nSometimes, I think Thai restaurants have (like some Chinese and Italian ones) been conditioned to serve what their patrons expect; greasy, heavy on the meat, low on the heat, knock upside the head with flavor stereotypes (peanut sauce, coconut milk etc.). \n\nWhat's a snooty Thai food snob/bitch to do?", "author": "Milk N."}

Iced Thai Tea & Coffee ($2.50 ea) were standard and satisfying.  Rice is charged per bowl/serving ($1.50 ea)...no brown rice option (awwww).  Spice quotient is wide-ranging & very customizable, so gun-shy and zealots alike can eat happily....just tell your server how hot you like it.\n\nPrices are lower than average (i.e., most expensive item is $12.95 for seafood specialties; other items average $8.95) and partially makes up for otherwise forgettable food.\n\nPretty blah experience, which isn't so good given we were so hungry and easily pleased at that point....service was minimal (only 1 refill)...also wouldn't run multiple cards, though somewhat forgivable since profit margin is so low with their low prices. \n\nMost likely will not be back...too many other options out there.", "author": "Amy K."}

I couldn't help but think about how successful this place would be on one of those restaurant makeover shows! It has a lot of potential. The other thing was that our server seemed to be the only one working the house. She was great, personable and did a good job, however she seemed stretched and it felt uncomfortable sometimes watching her. She was taking cash, running to-go orders out the door and attending to the tables.

First, the vegetables with \"chef's special sauce\" was bland and the beef looked freezer burned.  The chicken Pad Thai was doused in an orange sugary sause.  Just gross.  My mate was still hungry, so she got the highly recommended (by the waiter, who was, again, very nice) beef salad.

How authentic or fresh or compromised for the American palate is this going to be?\n\nManivahn is actually in my neighborhood--24th Street, in the Mission. I promise to not be biased. In fact, I move around quite a bit in the city to find good Thai food and it is mostly at least good. Sometimes the flavors are a bit contrived and the different dishes muddle together after a few bites.\n\nNot so with Manivanh!  This is my fourth time dining there, so I have a more complete picture of both their menu and consistency. \nThis is the real deal. Love the Larb Ta Hu (a salad with Tofu, mint, orange slices, etc)---light and well-balanced and a great way to wake up the palate.\n\nAlso the Plaa pad ma kur (terrible Thai on that one)--basically a lightly breaded and sauteed rock cod in a light, yet flavorful sauce. Delicious and delicate and a crowd pleaser. \n\nBetween those and the eggplant & chiles in a special chef's sauce, the perfectly-executed sticky rice and the almond-oil tea, I am quite impressed each time.\n\nThe only gripe is the lack of music in the place. Now, I am very loquacious so I am not one to fear the awkward silence that can happen on dates and so forth, but I do enjoy some aural ambiance. Need to discuss that with staff on next visit.\n\nOh, almost forgot to mention the lovely wall art. Deep-carved scenes of the Ramayana and Floating Markets as well as Apsaras really lend to authenticity.\n\nJust get some music in there and it'll make this one a FIVE STAR!!!", "author": "Carmine R."}

For me, that's just a little too high.  Maybe if this place was only $6/$7 would i give this place another try, but as far now, i think i'll stay away.", "author": "H. L."}

They use the Vietnamese pho noodles which is chewy in texture the way I like it and the sauce is very good.  My coworkers and I always share a couple of dishes and it's just enough food without making us feel bloated or overly stuffed afterwards, leaving enough room for the delicious fried banana and ice cream dessert.
