Between the rainbow sign, the history, sometimes the lines, House of Nanking has a reputation in the City. And I finally got to try it.\n\nMy date originally was craving dumplings but as we walked nearby, I mentioned the stories I had heard of HoN and she made the decision for us to go there. Fortunately for us, we timed it right where there was no line and got the seat by the door.\n\nFeaturing a more specialized menu than other Chinese restaurants that feature everything in the kitchen sink, you get the sense that House of Nanking has perfected what they have and that's what you get.\n\n-Pork Dumplings in Spicy Sauce: These were just okay. I felt we could have gone for the pot stickers, and seeing the table next to us get the eggrolls, I will definitely order those on a return visit.\n\n-Famous Sesame Chicken: I mean, its what they are famous for. A plate of crispy sesame chicken with sweet potatoes. These were good and I get the hype but the pieces weren't as chunky or tender as other places.  This also could have been due to the late evening.\n\n-Crispy Rice Noodle Tower: We got it with pork, I recommend getting it with Shrimp. Still good, but make sure you eat it all as it doesn't leftover well.\n\n-Blossom Tea: You get a liter mug of tea with the blossom at the bottom. And I feel this was slightly sweat, which I enjoyed. Also always good for warm tea on a cold San Francisco night.\n\nThe staff was excellent and incredibly hardworking. \n\nI wasn't necessarily blown away but I get the hype of this place. I definitely want to come back and try more of the dishes I didn't get a chance to, from the eggrolls, pea shoots, and more.\n\nAlso before you leave, read some of the great articles or pictures they have across the walls.", "author": "Michael C."}

A friend recommended we get dinner here because his ~Uber driver recommended it~ and neither the friend nor his Uber driver were Chinese so I was already skeptical tbh but I was like okay sure why not. It's in Chinatown - it can't be that bad right?\n\nWRONG BINCH I WAS SHOOK. I get here around 8:15pm and this place is packed! with people of mostly non-Chinese descent but it's okay because it's packed so something must be good here right? I ordered Fried Onion Pancakes and Fried Pork Potstickers and my friend ordered something else. Ok so far so good.\n\nWe waited around 10-15 minutes and the first dish came. Ok good turnaround time!! Not bad House of Nanking I see you. But this dish is the fried onion pancake and let me just tell you in NO chinese restaurant have I seen them make the scallion pancake (\u8525\u6cb9\u9905) the way they do here. Instead it's literally a bunch of scallions tossed in between two crisped layers and smothered with peanut sauce. It wasn't the peanut sauce so much that disappointed me as the fact that fundamentally this dish is NOT \u8525\u6cb9\u9905. But ok. I guess some places be trying to do art, so fine. 3/5 for the flavor, and my disappointment is just a side effect of artistic differences.\n\nAnyway not soon after the second dish comes which is my friends dish. He starts eating it, cool. But then 5 minutes later they come out and are like oops wrong dish and take his dish back. Ok to be fair it's also actually the wrong dish and maybe it's the friends fault for not paying attention to what he's eating but also maybe they shouldn't have taken a used dish back to the kitchen. Kinda sketch for health/food waste reasons. But at this point in the night this place would have gotten a 3/5 from me easy.\n\nAnyway it's another 15-20 minutes and my pork potstickers still haven't arrived and the restaurant is kinda clearing out. so i flag the waiter down and tell him and he says oops he didn't hear it and he'll put the order in. at this time the rating drops to a 2.5 because i very clearly remember ordering my two dishes so it's not a matter of hmmm did I forget to say it?\n\nBUT HERES THE KICKER. when the pork potstickers come out and the waiter brings them to me... THEYRE NOT POTSTICKERS BUT DUMPLINGS BINCH. (ps let me elaborate here - this isn't an artistic difference like ~oh they just make their potstickers differently~ no they literally got me the steamed dumpling DIFFERENT ITEM ON THE MENU instead of the pork potstickers) So i'm just like OK at this point imma just eat them bc me and House of Nanking are officially done. I don't know how you can put in an order wrong on the second time you're supposed to put it in. It's honestly ridiculous.\n\nI told the waiter later and they did comp the dumplings but come on? I came here with really optimistic expectations, but that kicker kills.\n\nAlso, it's really weird that I always end up having super bad experiences at Kathy Fang related restaurants :/ because I had a terrible one at Fang too. I swear to God I'm cursed or something because other people seem to be having a fantastic time to be fair. But from my experience here tonight, I'm never coming back.

When we told the waitress that it was our first time to the restaurant, she took our menus away and said that she would pick out for dishes for us that we would love. We were really nervous about giving up control of our selections, but we were all afraid to say no to her. \n\nWe Loved every selection! She prepared two off-menu dishes for us and two more standard dishes. Of particular note or the two off-menu dishes. I would have never ordered them on my own but they were amazing. There was a tender beef that melted in your mouth: it had bok Choy and came with a light flavorful sauce.  The other dish was a shrimp and chunk apple with a honey mayonnaise glaze. Who would ever think that apple and shrimp went together - but it really did! It was lightly and sweet and very refreshing to eat. \n\nThe prices were reasonable - it cost is about $80 for 4 of us.

You wouldn't be able to find spots quite like this in San Diego. Of the many Chinatown spots we go to whenever I'm in town, House of Nanking stuck out for me. You can spot the famous colorful sign from streets away.\n\nMy sister and her boyfriend (both locals) brought me here. We came here for lunch during the week and upon walking in, it was crammed with all walks of life - locals, professionals, and the *necessary* cute old Chinese people (that's how you know it's a good spot). Perhaps it's the nostalgia of going to family restaurants with my grandma and grandpa... but it's hard to hate a place that has old people who look like they've been going there for years, who probably have also been ordering the same dishes. And you wouldn't believe how many tables they tetris'd into this small space.\n\nWe started with the rice porridge - it was so good!! My only negative is that I don't like peas and they throw in a generous amount. We then ordered the fried calamari and pea shoot salad. For the salad we asked to add scallops, which was a great addition. My sister enjoyed the calamari but I found them just a bit vinegar-y for my taste. It's just a matter of preference I guess. The calamari was tender (not at all rubbery) and their house satay sauce complimented it well. The salad was amazing. It was really light but still very flavorful. There's nothing worse than an overdressed salad. The scallops were also really tender, but perfectly crispy on the outside. This place treats their seafood really well. By the way, the house blossoming tea is a MUST. \n\nService-wise, they are so quick! I can see why it's a hotspot for professionals - you can definitely be in and out in 30 minutes. It's also one of the spots where it's definitely a plus to know your order beforehand. You'll most likely have a server arrive upon seating.\n\nI'd love to return and try their other teas & dishes - hopefully in the near future. I highly recommend!", "author": "Rhonda P."}

The door was open and there was a small fly but other than that the place was sufficiently neat.  Its charm made up for its age.\n\nI asked for tea and was quickly provided a tall glass brimming with an understated black (maybe green?) tea with a delicate flower standing in the middle of the glass.  \n\nI ordered a simple dish - the house noodles and Chinese market greens - which also arrived quickly at my table, fresh and hot.

I looked over the menu and found several things I wouldn't mind trying, so off we went.\n\nWe started off as a party of two, but turned into a party of four by the time we left. It's a bit of a walk over from the Moscone Center, so by the time we arrived it was a little bit before 6pm. I've been told that there are lines down the block the later it got, so I was very happy that we were able to get seated right away. It was a Friday night - I was half afraid we'd have to wait for a while.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of dishes and shared family style - as it should be in any Chinese restaurant.\n\nWhat we ate:\nFried Pork Pot Stickers\nChinatown Market Greens - Bak choy\nSalt & Pepper Shrimp with Mushrooms\nFried Tofu with Peanut Sauce\nDry Braised Green Beans\nCold Sesame Noodles\nScallion Pancake with Peanut Sauce\n\nMy favorite was definitely between the Dry Braised Green Beans and the Fried Tofu.

But everything tasted really, really good.\n\nService was about the same as your usual Chinese restaurant - quick, brisk, and efficient.

As other reviews have mentioned, this is an authentic flavor that's pricey, but absolutely worth it for the price. The fish was aromatic and had been butchered and lightly fried before being made into a milky white soup. The tofu as well was tender and crisp -- a great variety of texture.\n\nSo, why the 1-star review?\n\nI usually don't care about service. Places with lower-than-average service often have the best food, since their waiters are too busy bringing the orders to the numerous guests. However, House of Nanking was egregious and disappointing on two counts.\n\nFirst, the house was not busy when we sat down. We waited for our water and reminded the waiter politely that we'd like waters. After affirming, we went another several minutes without water. When we reminded the waiter again, he pointed at my girlfriend and impatiently told us to wait.\n\nI felt we'd been waiting a while. From an onlooker's perspective, maybe we'd been impatient. Regardless, from my perspective, you never disrespect customers as an employee. This was an unnecessary breach of respect -- we hadn't shouted, demeaned, or demanded in any way.\n\nLater, when we saw a neighboring table get their 4 orders of rice, we realized that each bowl was larger than we'd expected. We asked a server that we change our order to 1 rice instead of 2. At this point, neither of our entrees had arrived, and neither had our rice.\n\nOur entrees arrived before our rice and, indeed, we were brought 1 bowl of rice. We enjoyed our food and got our check, and we were charged for 2 bowls of rice. No problem -- simple misunderstanding. We told the wait staff.\n\nShe thought for a full 3 seconds before saying, \"No, we gave you two orders of rice in one bowl. We gave you more.\"\n\n0) The hesitation made obvious that she was thinking of an excuse for not having to reprint a receipt.\n1) They didn't give us more rice.\n2) We were two people. Why would House of Nanking decide to give us one bowl to serve two people?\n\nThey were busy at this point, and we had plans for the afternoon. Rather than argue, we paid our bill and left.\n\nI hate complaining about service.\n\nI just want the bare minimum -- for the food to be brought to me, for any errors to be corrected. You don't have to have a good attitude, you don't have to fill my water every 3 minutes. But don't be intentionally rude, and don't lie to me.\n\nWell-made food that left a bitter taste as a result of disrespect and neglect from two wait staff -- a middle-aged gentleman and a slightly younger woman.", "author": "Dan Z."}

House of Nanking has been able to take some of the more traditional Chinese dishes and put a twist on it and serve it to mostly what seems to be tourists. For instance, I usually only get Pea Sprouts at a typical Cantonese family restaurant but they have it here and do a good job with it. I introduced my friends from the South to the Pea Sprouts and they were surprised to learn of another new tasty veggie. The Spicy Won Ton Soup has a white broth and has rice in it which is totally different from the clear broth we're accustomed to seeing. There's usually a long line and you might have to share a table with others because they have a ton of people to move in and out. Most of their staff isn't too friendly but it does add to the experience and it's kind of expected. They focus on the food more so than the service.", "author": "Jen L."}

The noodles are really thin and the soup is so flavorful. It's a little thick and the color is pale. The pieces of fish that were simmered are still there, but they aren't the highlight of the soup. It really is just the stock.\n\nThe twice cooked pork was interesting since they added basil and chili powder into the dish. I don't think they did it as traditionally because there wasn't any bean paste and the pork was really fatty.\n\nThe ribs, eh...I wouldn't get them again. They were deep fried and the sauce wasn't sticky so it was hard to add flavor. I heard it was authentic, I just didn't like it that much.\n\nThe shrimp and eggs, nothing special. It was like shrimp and eggs cooked together, with very few chives.\n\nThe fish filets we thought were going to be spicy since it was similar in naming to couple's delight. However, it really was just fish filets without too much sauce or flavoring IMO.\n\nThe duck reminded me a lot of drunken chicken.

The dishes were more exotic and unique from what I recall, but not too memorable as I didn't note to myself that I should need to return if ever I am back in San Francisco. There is one dim sum place I've noted to revisit every time, but Nanking hadn't made that list.

Chinese food in Chinatown are more Cantonese style since it is pack of old immigrants from south China. So better having dim sum in Chinatown rather than other style of Chinese food. Sometimes I will come to Chinatown for dim sum to experience the lost atmosphere of old time.\nThe service, it is complicated to say. Let me tell u the story. First was good and like any other Chinese restaurants here. Waitress came and asked. My hubby and I needed time to decide. \nAfter 10 mins, we made our decision. So in Chinese restaurant don't wait for waiter or waitress come. U have to gave them a sign that u are ready to order. I did that. One of waitresses standing in the back noticed me and told me that she would send one. Then one middle-aged lady came, but she ignored me and began to clean the table next to me. First I didn't have any negative feeling coz I knew they were busy. Then she was gone. \nI raised my arm again. The same one told me the same thing. Mins later the previous lady passed me to pass some food to the other table, and she ignored me again. Now I felt hurt! Why she kept ignoring me! She knew I was ready to order food! \nThen the third time. Finally I was pissed! And told them I was here waiting for 30 mins! And the ignorant lady raised her voice and shouted to me saying that she was busy. \nWell, This is how you treat your customers?!\nThen the restaurant manger realized the situation and came to serve my table. He is nice guy. \nThough I did find human hair in one of my dishes. The manager retreated that one and gave me an offer that I can order one more without charging that one. \nI didn't wanna argue anymore coz I was exhausted already. \nI definitely won't step in this restaurant once more, though the food is better than its neighbors.", "author": "Anna Y."}

It was a lot of batter and not that much meat.  I think an older version made it famous and people's excitement about being in Chinatown keeps it famous.

Our party was immensely grateful that we came across this restaurant because the food was delicious. There wasn't a single complaint in our whole group. \n\nThe food is served family style. The portions are huge, so keep that in mind when ordering. We were told to wait outside for about ten minutes while space cleared for our party of five waited. We were seated in half the time, but ended up being seated a table with a young woman from New Zealand. Yes, they will seat you with strangers. In our case, it worked out wonderfully, but I could see this getting a little awkward if on a date. \n\nThe food was excellent. I ordered the veggie egg rolls which are served in a pair and are almost a meal unto themselves. I also ordered Salt & Pepper shrimp, easily enough for two people, it was outstanding. It was seasoned perfectly and the shrimp was plentiful (not stingy like most places). In some ways, I think House of Nanking is slightly underrated by reviewers and I can understand why. Firstly, the space is too cramped, but that's a good thing because business is booming and House of Nanking is doing something right. Secondly, when we looked around everyone had something bottled to drink. At first we ordered water and were each brought warm tap water, without ice. Not sure if the temperature was intentional or not, but it certainly did the trick. It was a weird moment, but our group felt compelled to order sodas after the warm drinking water delivery.

Be prepared to give your order right after you're sat or you'll wait a while before they come back", "author": "Mai D."}

The lunch menu was also disappointing with few options.\nThe food was just ok; nothing spectacular or memorable. \nOur bill was $92 and we ended up tipping $6. The lady taking orders caught sight of this and demanded we tip more. Although we didn't feel the service or the food deserved more, we obliged but looking back, I regret giving into her demands as it builds up her ego and confidence to continue demanding more money from customers, as if her service and food was exceptional when in reality, it wasn't close to.\nOverall, based on service and food, I will not return and would not recommend.", "author": "Hello E."}

Food is good and tasty. Service is good and order time is reasonable.  We had the sesame chicken, pot stickers, house noodles, shrimp and mushrooms. All were good. The only thing I dont care for is when you order a coke and you get a can. Also be aware of the prices. Although the food is good their prices have went up and very expensive. Two can of coke were over $5.00 cant rember the change. For what we had it ended up close to $60.00 $57 and some change. So be prepared to dig into your pockets. We would come down to the city time to time and stop here, food is consistant. But with prices increased. it will be less. theres lots of good places to eat in the city at a good price.

Was within walking distance so off we went. \n\nI typically check to see who is dining in specialty restaurants. This one I saw the majority was non-Asian diners and took this as a sign that the menu has been adjusted for foreign tastes. Went in anyway and was seated right away. Were given menus that looked like the business had gotten their money's worth from them. \n\nWhile trying to decide what to order, a server came over speaking English very quickly and asking us if we like beef, chicken or seafood. Said chicken and seafood. What kind of seafood, shrimp or calamari? If we liked sweet or not. Said sweet. \n\nI asked her for the house noodles too. We were asked what we wanted to drink so we both ordered hot tea. \n\nThe tea showed up in beer mugs. In the tea was this round ball shaped object. Was told it was a tea ball. The ball starts to unravel and just like a blooming flower it opens into a blossom with a string of flowers rising from the center. Pretty neat. \n\nWithin 10 minutes our food arrived. All we knew was we were getting shrimp, chicken and noodles. \n\nThe chicken came as fried pieces in a garlic and soy sauce coating with slices of what tasted like potato and slices of some crunchy green vegetable. The chicken was crisp and tasty. \n\nThe shrimp also came fried with a batter coating and covered with a white sauce. Was told it was honey shrimp with apples. The apples were battered and fried too. The honey shrimp was tasty but I didn't like the fried apples. \n\nThe house noodles showed up and was topped with sliced cabbage and some other greens. The menu said it was egg noodles but what we got didn't resemble egg noodles that I know of. Taste was plain and the noodles were too soft. \n\nSo, overall it was okay but I wouldn't go there again. Just nothing real special after I noticed quite a few of the other tables were getting the same chicken, some the same noodle dish. \n\nThey don't even need menus since they pretty much order for you and everyone else in the restaurant. That's probably why lots of diners got the same dishes.", "author": "Barry A."}

I said I would pay with cash for the tip, which is usually appreciated.  Immediately, the waitress stood behind me waiting for the tip, hovering over me, waiting for her cash tip.

If we'd have landed at this place when I was a child, and the food tasted as it did yesterday, I'd not ever have eaten Chinese food again. Sad really to see what could have been and what now is. Probably bordered on the worst meal I've ever consumed in the city. (Although truth is I barely consumed anything after tasting everything)\nThe staff opted to curate our meal. At a capable dining establishment this is a good sign. You'll get the chefs choice and it'll be creative and very fresh. \n\nIt was anything but. From the gloopy gluey battered shrimp with apple chunks to the syrupy sauce atop the onion cake, the raw cold bok choy beneath the cubed and battered steak, on to the hunks of tofu swimming in that ubiquitous brown sauce to the inedible watery bland rice soup, I don't know which we despised more. \nSad really. The product wasn't bad but the preparation however was abominable. I felt as though they saw us as some tourists from the Midwest who knew little about Chinese food and just gave us whatever to placate us. The mall Chinese food #1 special would have been delicious comparatively. \nWhen we arrived they asked us what sorts of things we would like and then never bothered to get the answer and proceeded to bring out poorly executed dish one after another. By that point, I wish someone had executed me; yes it really was THAT bad. \nWe came with out of town guests whose palates had experience and they left feeling equally as dismayed and hungry. I felt horrible not having waited for a table at the delicious dim sum place up the street, and apologized profusely.

Once you get in, get ready to order.  The food comes out hot and swift.  All at once.  Do not get offended when the server drops the bill while you're eating.

The service is fast, food comes out fast and you're pretty much all done within 30 minutes - which is the only reason I can think of as to why people go. The food taste like fast food Chinese food - literally. I ordered the onion pancake- it was weird, mushy when I expected to be crunchy like I've had it before. The cold sesame noodles were good and the sesame chicken was extremely chewy. So overall, I was expecting a more rich Chinese food experience which is definitely not house of Nankings thing.

We ordered two sodas and the woman that took our drink order brought back two cans and two straws. It wouldn't been better if they were in cups, or at least given me a cup with ice! But, no. I received two dirty cans of warm soda. \n\nMe and boyfriend like to look through a menu completely, especially if we're new to a restaurant. So the same lady comes back, asks us if we're ready. We politely tell her no, she scoffs, and leaves. 2 minutes later, she comes back and we tell her we're still looking... leaves again. Literally, another 2 minutes pass and she comes and I'm like NO. We need more time. And she just stands there, waiting for us to order. So, when me and my boyfriend finally decide- we order the famous chicken, the house onion cakes, and the dumping soup. \n\n15 minutes later, our soup comes out and this time a man comes and he sloppily serves us our soup, dripping it all over the table. I don't know if he was the owner, but he didn't really looked like he cared at all that we were there. After he poured the soup, he dipped. \n\n5 minutes later, our chicken and cakes come. All three were so delicious and yummy when hot. Very flavorful! The food got a little cold along with the flavor, but I enjoyed it while it lasted. \n\nNow, comes the check that we had to ask for. All came out to about 35 dollars and come change, boyfriend hands them 40. WE HAD TO LITERALLY ASK FOR OUR CHANGE. The man that served us the soup took our money and put it in the register and left it there until we asked for our change. He finally gives it. As my boyfriend was walking back to the table, he gives me the 4 dollar and something cents. I KID YOU NOT, the man follows from behind, with his hands out, saying \"the tip was not included with the total\" and leaves his hands out waiting for me to give him the money. Normally, I would just leave it on the table, but he would not leave until I gave him a tip. I looked at my 4 and gave him 2 for being such a dick! He takes the 2 and laughs and starts talking  shit in his language, I'm assuming. \n\nLOL, I did not really care. I would have given him the whole thing if not more, if service had been more satisfying. You're supposed to be serving your culture on your plates! The food may be good, but the atmosphere there is so terrible! Me and my boyfriend seriously can not believe how GREEDY and MONEY HUNGRY those people are.

Anyway i ordered the house fried rice with shrimp and beef, he explained i would be charged extra for the shrimp and beef i accepted. Brought me the food and it had 2 pieces of shrimp on it. So i waited until he came back and i asked him if that's all that i would get is two shrimp? Especially for what i was being charged and he said yes. Then i asked him, how come he didn't tell me i would only get two, or at least have that on the menu. All he said was DO YOU WANT IT?! very impatiently. When someone talks down to me like that i don't care what's in front of me i don't want it anymore I'll take my money and business elsewhere. He took the plate, didn't apologize or offer any sort of solution like maybe a few more shrimp or anything.

After doing a quick search we saw House on Nanking show up on several \"best of\" lists and decided to give it a try. We were glad we did.\n\nTheir sizzling rice soup was much brighter than most versions I've had with a lot more lemon in it, plus more fresh veggies like zucchini. I wasn't necessarily expecting them, but they were a nice addition. The rice was nice and crunchy and the chicken had just a little bit of heat to it, which was a nice change. Usually that soup is just about the rice, so it was nice to make the meat a little better. \n\nWe also had some of their pork dumplings which were very good, stuffed with lots of the filling and the sauce for them was really nice as a contrast with lots of vinegar.\n\nFor our entree we split their sesame chicken. This may not be the most adventuresome choice, but it was cooked perfectly with a good crunchy shell and moist chicken inside. Paired with a little white rice, the sweet potatoes and the sesame sauce were really good.\n\nIt was very busy, but we didn't have any problem getting in and getting a table. We were back by the area later that night and the line was probably about 20 people out the door, so it get pretty busy if you don't catch them during a lull.\n\nI'm sure there are lots of other great choices in the area, but if you're looking for some good twists on some classic versions of American favorites on Chinese cuisine, House on Nanking fits the bill.", "author": "Seneca G."}

The quality of the food is good, and the service is still in a big hurry to get you in, although the cramming is less necessary, but the prices have gotten out of touch.

The Chinese menu serves authentic Chinese food, and the English menu serves Americanized Chinese food. My friend and I were able to read and communicate to our waiter in Chinese, so it wasn't too bad for us. But seeing as this is a popular tourist eating destination, I feel like the menus should be universal. \n\nI'm conflicted because for one of our dishes we ordered a \"honey beef\" (not sure the exact translation to English) and it was BOMB. I have never had a dish similar to this in the past, so it was extremely unique. It was crispy, sweet, and so flavorful. This dish alone I would have gave this restaurant an immediate 5 stars. For our second dish, we ordered a \"dried shrimp/pork noodles\" (not sure the exact translation to English again). The noodles were ridiculously oily, and legitly tasted as if the cook dumped the whole jar of black pepper.

What is worse is that we specifically mentioned that one of us had a shellfish allergy and they accidentally for us shrimp and mushrooms instead of salt and pepper mushrooms. After that, they made errors in the bill by billing us for extra items. That's just unacceptable. Anyway, we got the bill corrected and while we were paying, the senior manager came and stood at our table and said extremely loudly that the tip is USD 7 (13%). This was exactly the amount the corrected on the bill. I felt extremely uncomfortable with her hostile manner and we just paid, but I'm quite shocked that this is the standard of their service. \nFood - is just about average, but the pricing suggests that it would be tastier / more authentic. For instance, the sesame chicken is simply fried chicken pieces (like KFC chicken nuggets) thrown in a honey - soy sauce. There was no depth of flavours and no complexity to the dish. That is fine most of the time, except the dish is priced higher than the quality of food they're serving. \nAmbiance was nice with light streaming in from the big windows.

The texture of the tofu was like nothing I've ever tried before - the tofu pieces had a fried, crispy, breadcrumb-like exterior but were somehow not greasy. The inside was so meaty yet soft. I really enjoyed the accompanying salad - a bunch of fresh greens drizzled with some type of light and slightly tangy dressing. So good!\n\nSome warnings: if you order hot tea, you will have to pay for it. I asked for hot tea thinking it would be complimentary but they brought out the tea in these big beer mugs.

Best Chinese food I've ever had! As soon as you walked in you could smell deliciousness. It has to be an area favorite since every table was filled and continued to be filled once the previous party left. We ordered the pot stickers, Nanking sesame chicken, and scallops. All had a different flavor profile. My favorite was the chicken. It had a little bit of sweet and spice that was just perfect. The chicken was crunchy and every bite was a little piece of heaven. Let's just say we were upset when we realized we had eaten it all. A must go to when in San Francisco!", "author": "Angela R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-12-10", "description": "This is my favorite Chinese Restaurant in America!\n\nHere's how I always order here. I bring a group of 2-6 people and wait for a table. Sometimes it can take over an hour to get a table. Then when we sit down we tell the waiter/waitress that we'd like the chef to select our food for us. If someone doesn't want pork/seafood we make that clear at this point but other than that we don't specifically request anything. We order drinks and eat the food as it comes. I've never had a dish that I didn't enjoy.\n\nFor the more picky eaters out there just be warned that there are 2 menus. The english menu has your standard american chinese food and will be \"good\" but wont be the reason this place is famous. If you don't speak/read chinese you should try to download an app that can translate for you since the Chinese menu is what you're going to want to order from.\n\nAlso, be warned that if you're taking forever trying to figure out what you want the staff might come off as a little rude. They're not there trying to cater to your every need. They're just going to get your drinks and bring you your food. If you need them for anything other than that you'll have to raise your arm, flag them down, or even raise your voice to get their attention.\n\nAs long as you enter this with the right mindset you're going to love it. It's not what most american's are expecting in terms of service but the food is so good it's definitely worth being a little accepting of the difference in culture.", "author": "Justin E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-29", "description": "PSA: NOT A TOURIST TRAP AND NOT AUTHENTIC FOOD. CHINESE FUSION. BUT IT IS SO DAMN GOOD. THAT IS ALL. \n\nI think this is important to say the latter because those are the majority of the negative reviews. People came in expecting authentic Chinese but it isn't that - but it is probably some of the best food I've ever had. Zagat has named it one of the top restaurants from 2012-2015 so for 4 years straight critics have given it pretty good ratings. \n\nWe got here when I pulled over a cabbie and said, \"We want to go to Chinatown and have good chinese food. We don't know where to go, where do the locals go or what's just good?\" He said, \"Honestly, I don't remember of any place specifically. There's this one place that other cabbies have told me to go to or recommend. Not sure exactly where but I'll get you close. It has Nanking in the name for sure.\" He ended up getting us within a block and we weren't disappointed to say the least. \n\nNow that we've established it's Chinese Fusion and what not, this is absolutely delicious. This is more family style cuisine, aka order everything you want and share with everyone at your table. We got the house noodles. Get those. Please god get those. So good! Not sure what there is in them... but it's magical. We also got something with beef, plum sauce, and a pancake (tortilla). Whatever it was called since I forgot.. it was delicious. Best thing ever. \n\nI also ordered the detox berry tea and it was sooooo good! It came un-traditionally in a beer stein and the loose leaf tea was roaming freely in the beverage. But the glass stein allowed you to look at everything in it. My tea also had rose buds that were floating at the top which made it pretty to look at too. I was sad I didn't finish it it was so tasty - and I'm not a tea drinker. \n\nAt the end, my boyfriend and I were stuffed but we wanted to keep eating we enjoyed it so much. The waiter had already dropped the check but we asked him to add on a to-go order of whatever is their best selling appetizer or whatever they want to get rid of at the time. He understood dropped a new check and we had an appetizer to go in about 3 minutes. It ended up being the potstickers. Once we got back to our hotel, digested a little more, we ate them cold and they were still tasty. I can only imagine what they tasted like hot. Nom nom. \n\nFinally, the service was fine in my opinion - I've also read some poor reviews based on that. This might not be totally PC but if I go to an Asian restaurant... I don't expect super sugar coated service. Especially if they are busy. Nor do I expect table convo. They want you to eat, enjoy, and leave to get as many people in and out. Culturally they are fairly short but they by no means mean to be insulting or rude. It's just like... \"what do you want? Perfect we got you, bro!! You done! Great! Come back soon!\" I thought our servers were friendly. It was great :) \n\nOne last thing and I promise I'm done: Because the venue is small for the popularity (yes locals come here, I think there were mostly locals here, perhaps a few tourists like myself but that's it), they pack the tables in, so I compare the seating to European style. Very close and you can hear most everyone's conversations. So just don't talk about your crazy drunk escapades or your ideas about starting your drug cartel and you'll be fine. \n\nPro: Tasty, deliciou, unique fusion food, quick service, to-go orders, sit down, reasonably priced, a block or two from the main Chinatown strip, about a .8 mile walk from the Warf.\n\nCon: If you want traditional/authentic food not your place, some really believe it's a tourist trap but I disagree, there were tons of locals, some people don't like close seating, but I don't mind. Some people may think the .8 mile walk is undesirable from the warf and being that it is uphill. It was about a 10 min cab ride for us.", "author": "Rebecca A."}

The food was okay- some people may believe it's authentic Chinese food- salty and greasy, but I've had better in other restaurants to be honest. However, what really gave this place one star is their service. After paying the bill and stepped out, one staff ran to us and claimed we left without leaving the bill on table.  I showed him my purse, saying I kept the customer copy only, nothing else and my colleagues also told him they saw it on the table. He insisted it wasn't there and I felt I was accused of not paying the bill. Me and my colleagues decided to go back with him to check ourselves. After stepping into the restaurant, another staff asked why we took away the bill. Omg I felt sooo insulted!

I was the only Asian eating at this place and 2. It was packed with a sea of white folks/ tourist. No bueno. Reasons besides why I ended up here.. \n\nThis is a place to go if 1. You're white and can't be asked to actually walk a block or two up to see where the Chinese are actually eating at and 2. You lack a bit of observatory common sense 3. You like fried food.\n\nAs a Chinese, I've rarely/ almost never seen lemon as a topping for a fish soup (the extra fish was FRIED-- hey, if I wanted fish tacos?), and secondly, have never seen half cooked tomatoes and PINEAPPLES diced up (with crispy rice) in a lettuce wrap. Fried shrimp, no thank you. It's easy to hide non fresh seafood, k guys? \n\nOh and $5 Tsingtao beer?

I would eat here again and recommend it to others as a delicious option in Chinatown. Our favorite dishes were the sesame chicken, salt and pepper pork belly, melt in your mouth calamari, crispy garlic beef (not on the menu) and the honey shrimp.

I know it's very popular and the food here has a unique twist on northern Chinese cuisine. My party ordered the beef wrap, dumplings,  sesame chicken, green string beans, shrimp and mushrooms, and chow mein. The portions were smaller than usual, so we had to order double of several dishes so our party could all enjoy it. All very good quality ingredients, the flavors were there, but I felt it was a bit heavier on the salt than I'm used to. I loved the piping hot goji berry tea to wash down the food. \n\nWe were mistakenly served potstickers instead of dumplings and after we had them divided on everyone's plates, one of the waitresses came back and made us give back the potstickers and then took the plate away which was an odd and awkward experience since I was eating lunch with my manager and her manager. I think if we were given the chance, we would have just paid for the potstickers since we had already touched them and had them on our individual plates. Not sure if that plate of touched potstickers was served to another table afterwards which poses for a question in sanitation? \n\nI didn't love or hate the food here, I just feel bewildered.

I should not have had high expectations after coming in and observing the atmosphere. There was not a single Asian diner. If you have had real/authentic Chinese food, do not expect much from this place. \n\nWe were greeted and seated immediately upon entering. This place is so small and busy that you share tables with other parties. We decided to order one item from the menu and then allow the staff to choose four dishes for us, since that's what this place is known for. They ask if you like shrimp, beef, chicken, etc... and from there, they surprise you. I like the concept. Unfortunately, the food was not at all appetizing. This is very Americanized Chinese food that is overly salted, but aside from that, poorly seasoned and overly cooked to dryness.\n\nIn addition, the dishes do not come with rice. Our food was dropped off at our table and we were not asked if we needed anything else. We had to flag someone down to ask for some rice and we were told that rice would be $1 per bowl. We were fine with that. When we were brought the rice, they had put \"5 bowls\" worth of rice onto one plate - definitely not 5 bowls worth. \n\nNot once did anyone ask how the food was. We asked for our check and our total came out to almost $100 (not including tip) for just 5 dishes. The one dish we ordered off the menu was $12, so I guess the 4 \"surprises\" were almost $20.

Not terrible, not great. \n\nThe issue is the service. Some terrible, rude, greedy people run this establishment.\n\nWe witnessed the couple sitting next to us getting shook down for a tip by the waitress. \n\nWhen it came time for our bill, they were reaching for our receipts before I even finished signing my name. I held my receipt until my partner was done signing hers so we could have them over together. They still tried to grab it right out of my hand. \n\nDespite watching me sign the receipt over my shoulder, they later accused me of not signing my receipt and demanded I show them I signed it to the point of loudly yelling at me in front of others customers. \n\nI regret coming here and never plan on coming back. I advise you to stay away. They should be embarrassed. I'm certainly embarrassed for them.\n\nChong Qing Xiao Mian is right next door.

We were a group of four, so got a table to ourselves, but saw that others were sharing. \n\nAs a british consumer, it's hard to judge american portions, as they all look pretty damn big to me, but it came in big sharing plate mounds, which is how we always ate chinese at home so we were pretty happy. Sesame chicken was a particular fave with us. \n\nI've seen on a review or two, complaints about hygiene, which isn't something I spotted at all. \n\nOverall we were pretty happy, and I've recommended it to friends happily since.", "author": "Hannah M."}

We ordered the Spicy Wor Dumpling Soup and Cold Sesame Noodles (this was recommended on Foursquare).\n\nPositives:\n- Seating was quick and we didn't have to wait outside for very long.\n- Waiters and waitresses were quick.\n- Gave us a Chinese menu (but we couldn't read it unfortunately and seemed way more expensive)\n\nNegatives:\n- Definitely did not cater to a Chinese audience because the flavors were all not Chinese and no chopsticks! \n- Very loud and crowded. You will most likely share a table with other people.\n- The soup was too salty and small for something that's usually served for the whole table (again, this restaurant caters more to individual meals).\n- The cold noodles were the biggest disappointment.  Nothing like what we imagined and basically tasted like noodles with Italian dressing over it.  I ate all the veggies but the noodles weren't even worth taking back home.\n\nIf you're looking for an authentic Chinese restaurant, go somewhere else even if it doesn't have a line.  If you want food that's really salty, sweet and sour at the same time, this is the place to go but it's unfortunately not for my taste.  We noticed that there were hardly any Asians in the restaurant but the line drew us in and that was the mistake that we made.", "author": "Jasmine C."}

I have been here only a few times and have learned a very important lesson: DO NOT order off the menu, but rather have the owner order for you. Somehow, he's able to look at you and know what your preferences are from there. Then out of nowhere, four to five dishes come out of nowhere! I have no idea what I ate, but it was amazingly good for the standards that I hold Chinese food up to. All you have to say is the magic words, \"hook me up.\"\n\nThis used to be a little hole in the wall, but over time, it has grown and grown and now looks more like a more mainstream restaurant than it did years ago.

House of Nanking gets a 3.5 in my book for its not bad, not the best food and its kind of wack service.\n\nWe started with the 4 piece green onion pancake that had 1 piece of shrimp in each piece. Kinda skimpy if you ask me, but I'd give that dish a 3. They were kind of on the crispy side, but I didn't mind it so much.\n\nAnother starter we ordered was the calamari. It's ring style calamari, so if you're looking for the fishy and squid like kind, this ain't the one. It didn't come with lemon and the sauce was poured on for you instead of on the side for dipping, so I wasn't impressed. If you're a calamari connoisseur, it's definitely not worth your money. I'd say pass and I'd give it a 2, by the way, it's also a bit oily. \n\nAs much as I enjoy the oily Chinese dishes,  I love to test the green option/s they have in store at these kind of spots, so, I ordered the shrimp lettuce wraps, which came with a mixed veggie stuffing; mostly frozen veggies and peas, cubed squash and about 8 pieces of medium sized shrimp. They gave several pieces of lettuce for the wraps. The veggies were doused in a brown, sweet (but not too sweet) sauce. It was on the thicker side and I think the dish would have been better without so much sauce to go with this being one of the only  healthy options, as this is one of the cleaner (light and healthy) options of food here. Overall I'd give it a 4. \n\nHouse of Nanking was decent Chinese food. I'd give it a 3.5, but since service wasn't great and the main guy/owner was there making sure he made quick bucks, I'm going to give it a 3. The waitresses were alright, but they're probably trained to keep the line moving, so they don't get too personable. We went before 6 and it wasn't too packed, but half an hour later, there was a huge line waiting to get in.

The sesame chicken was all in all my favorite platter, nothing to complain about there, but the rice noodle chicken tower was bland and had no taste, the lettuce wraps were also bland and the servers were throwing Lettuce on the plates without any gloves and turning it around to throw it on the table. The silverware and cups seemed very dirty and asking for a straw or more water seemed like such a hassle for the wait staff. The service was very rude and would even eat food and snacks in between service while serving. This place is a NO-GO for me. Been there done that, never going back.", "author": "Jesse R."}

I've had great Chinese/Chinese American in DC NY and London.

Last trips for us were about 2pm on a weekday recently and also this past Christmas. It is as ever noisy and crowded, but now it is also pretty dirty as well. I don't advise wiping your table with the provided white paper napkin unless you really want to know how much. We ordered sesame chicken, pot stickers, spinach salad and pork egg rolls. The chicken was extremely tough. They clearly dumped some frozen into the deep fryer, dumped a few seeds and treacly sauce over the top and job done. The pieces weren't close to uniform and many were just stuck together in a lump. The spinach leaves we're fresh, but destroyed by several pints of the same brown sweet sauce that graced our chicken. Chicken came with some edible starchy roots of some type. The pot stickers are also deep fried. This may or may not be the Nanjing style but they are really hard to cut and probably also came from the Food4Less feeezer. The egg rolls, deep fried, featured a hint of ginger so they won the taste test, but the bar was very low. Tough to get out of there for less than $50. They feature an interesting hot tea that comes with what looks like an alien pod floating in your cup of hot water. When saturated it sinks to the bottom and blooms into a flower. It is pretty, but as a source of tea, the flavor is not particularly distinguished. Avoid.", "author": "Douglas S."}

We were sat down right away and then greeted by the owner who asked us a few questions on what types of foods we prefer, vegetarian, meat, spice level, etc. Then he said he'll prepare a dish for us accordingly. We were a bit hesitant at first, because we like knowing what we get but this was a first time experience to try.\nThe interior has two seating sections. Most of the patrons were non Asian, so I can tell from the start that the place steers on the side of Asian fusion.\nBesides the mystery dish, we also ordered the sweet potato and eggplant stir fry and hot tea.\nThe hot tea had goji berries, and came out in a big glass mug. It tasted pretty good, and kept me warm.\nThe sweet potato and eggplant was cooked in a very flavorful sauce, but a bit too salty. I really liked the texture of the eggplant. However, the sweet potatoes were undercooked, and not sweet. It tasted more like a regular potato. I like my sweet potatoes fairly sweet and softer.\nThe second dish, prepared by the chef, was a stir fried cauliflower and crispy pork belly. The sauce was pretty good, not overly salty, and I had mostly the cauliflower, while the boyfriend took the pork belly.\nThe meal came out to be $35, a bit more than we expected, since it meant the two dishes were $15 each. And I didn't think they were worth that much. The tea was around $4, quite expensive compared to other Chinese restaurants. And a tub of white rice was $1-2.\nAnyhow, I wouldn't come back again since there's many more authentic Chinese restaurants down the street in Chinatown.

House of Nanking will move two tables (meant for parties of four) about two inches away form each other and seat two parties. It's almost like the hella Chinese places that have two parties share a large round table to seat more people. \n\nFOOD:\n-- House Special Sesame Chicken = OK? Not bad but not amazing. Sweet brown sauce smothering fried chicken pieces, accompanied by sliced orange (yam? carrot? sweet potato?) and green veggies (cucumber?). Tastes kinda like general tso chicken. The staff use bare hands to top the dish off with sesame seeds... after pressing the register's touch screen and other things. I HOPE THEY WASH THEIR HANDS AFTER HANDLING DIRTY DISHES.\n-- Melt in your Mouth Calamari = Eh. The texture of the calamari pieces is nice since you don't have to break your jaw gnawing away. The batter is light but doesn't stick to the calamari well because of the light citrus sauce making it soggy. Chewy, yes. Crunchy, nada.\n- Pork Egg Rolls = Decent. They taste different than any other egg roll I've ever had. They make nice appetizers, sure.\n\nSERVICE: Sub-par Asian service\nLess pleasant than usual Asian service.\n-- \"Wait outside!\" when they have customers waiting to be seated.

Fried rice at Panda Express is way better\n\nChick n lettuce cup- oh hell, wtf is up with those chunks of raw tomato. You know Chinese folk don't put raw anything and certainly not 1 inch cubes of raw tomato in a stir fry. The stir fry itself was weird. It was a scrambled egg concoction with rancid chicken meat and raw tomato.

Alright, it's not really that far, but high heels can turn the most innocent walk into a slog to the top of Half Dome (read: ouch). Nevertheless, I refuse to wear running shoes with a dress or a skirt, on principle. \n\nI had previously tried to go to HON (ha) and failed (see my Dumpling House review for the explicit details). Be careful to note where you're at, because the Dumpling House next door is quite popular, and it typically has a line going out the door. If you're prone to attacks of sudden onset ADD like myself, you might just get in that line if you're not paying attention. And that would be tragic. \n\nSince then I have been to HON twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and I kind of love it. \n\nStrangely, the item I love the most at HON is the steamed pork dumplings. I think dumplings are so satisfying, and the ones that are not deep fried tend to taste better to me. HON's dumplings do not disappoint. They are the perfect texture (and I'm a freak about texture), and cooked to perfection (I.e., HON gets that \"steamed\" does not mean \"boil\" the sh*t out of them). But all of that aside, order these dumplings simply for the sauce they come in--what the FRAKK is that sauce? It doesn't taste like peanut sauce to me. It's nice and cool yet pleasingly spicy and delicious. Yes, please. \n\nI've also had the sesame chicken, since HON describes it as their signature dish. It's served with yams (or some kind of sweet potato) and a green apple garnish. The portion is huge (please be advised that you will need assistance finishing this dish, and that I'm available to help). But it's pretty tasty. It's very filling, of course, because it's fried. The yams are a surprisingly good element of the dish, although they will make you feel pretty full as well. I can get one order for take out and live off of it for three days, easily. Call me crazy, but I don't think it's diet. \n\nI'll be back for the garlic fish and the melt in your mouth calamari, naturally. The soup looks bangin as well. I want all of it. \n\nThe interior of the restaurant is split into two rooms, mostly with large community tables. The service is supremely efficient (read: lightening fast). The Tsingtao is flowing like wine.  \n\nNever mind the restaurant next door, this is what you want.", "author": "Sunny S."}

I did hear that they do tend to have a long line - but we were lucky that night! As a Chinese restaurant owner's daughter - I'd say I am pretty particular about dishes from Chinese restaurants (if I even go to them at all!) But this place definitely had some delicious flavor that made me a fan.\n\nPork Wonton Soup - HIGHLY recommend! They add a small twist where the broth that the soup comes in is reminiscent of Tom Kha thai soup. It wasn't so citrus-y flavor wise so it did not overwhelm the taste of the pork wontons. The Medium was enough to feed my group of 3 people for two small soup bowls. Great as a starter/appetizer dish.\n\nHouse Special Fried Rice - We shared the rice and it was good as well! Nothing particularly special about it (honestly if a Chinese restaurant can't get their Fried Rice right, then we got a problem). \n\nSnow Pea Leaves - We got the Snow Pea vegetable dish and that was delicious! Highly recommend as a flavorful veggie dish to go along with any meat item you choose.\n\n5 Spice Porkchops - Flavor was good but there was only about 4-5 slices 4 oz thin slices that was barely shareable between 3 people, so just keep that in mind for trying to go family-style. \n\nOverall a pretty great try and would definitely recommend for people trying to find a place to eat in Chinatown!", "author": "Tracy L."}

While the service is always kind of like they are doing you a favor, it fits with the style of this restaurant.

I don't know what Peter Fang does to make that sauce so good but when you have a little of the dumpling sauce mixed with the peanut sauce... hello. Awesome! Just ask him to bring you a crispy chicken or shrimp dish, something with his incredible veggies, some dumplings and a Tsingtao beer and that's all you will need to complete your China town eating experience in San Francisco. Apparently David Letterman and The Rolling Stones have the same opinion as they eat there or order to go whenever they are in town (so I've heard). I like the remodel they've done.

Can't believe I haven't yet reviewed House of Nanking.\n\nHere's the quick 'n' dirty version of what you need to know (in no particular order):\n+ Gotta try the calamari as well as the sesame chicken with sweet potatoes\n+ If you are a tea lover, order the blooming mug of tea. It expands right in front of you!\n+ Sure, you can eat with chopsticks, but they'll default with a fork, which is fine by me.\n+ Service is nice enough, not the friendliest, but they make sure you order plenty of food and get it fast.\n+ They now accept credit cards, so no worries about hitting up the ATM before your visit!\n+ If you go right at noon, there isn't a long line out the door to score a table.\n\nGreat spot to take out of town guests who want the real SF experience.

We stood in line before they opened, and I had high hopes.\n\nWe ordered the house fried rice and house noodles and they were both okay. Nothing special. The calamari (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED, according to them) was NOTHING special. It was fried, and no sauce, so I'm not sure what's so special about it. \n\nThe worst part of the experience was the service. It place looked dirty, our server was eating and shoving noodles in her mouth in front of us like she hasn't eating in years. No one speak English. They have poor manners.

There was a line that formed shortly after we sat down, so it's clearly popular.  Like most places in downtown San Francisco, it looks like it's been there fifty years or longer, and has the classic dark lacquered wood furniture and walls.  The seating is packed together tightly and, while there are silk flowers in vases that haven't been dusted in a while, there is nothing of note that stands out about the decor otherwise. \n\nService:  \nWow.  The service here takes some getting used to.  If, as others have noted, it is the standard for restaurants in Chinatown to get you in an out while addressing you as little as possible, then this restaurant definitely met that standard.  The total conversation from the server from start to finish was as follows:\n\"Two?\"  Flopped two menus on the table with a loud slap.\n\"What do you want?\"  Orders taken.  Food later placed quickly on table.\n\"Your check\".  Flopped check tray on table.  \nI understand we were not regulars, and we were not friends with anyone there, but this made me smile.  I hadn't seen interaction this efficient in a place without a kiosk.  In other words, don't come here to commiserate on the human experience, or to connect with your fellow humans in the Chinese Restaurant industry. \n  \nFood:  \nThe food was good.  Not great, but good.  The menu looked unusual and had many what seemed like great choices.  I had the wonton soup, which was huge, and a shrimp dish, which was good.  Not great.  Which overall sums up my experience at this very popular restaurant.", "author": "Robert M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-03-24", "description": "Recently wandering in Chinatown after an appointment downtown, per chance, I happened upon the storied Nanking House that Kearny built.  Around mid-afternoon, the restaurant was empty, and I realized the opportunity that had presented itself. Most of the time I've passed by, there has been a line outside the door. I'd never brave that line, and certainly not by myself when I'd only be able to sample one dish. To make matters more challenging, the restaurant closes early, at 9p (which is odd being so close to the bustle of Columbus Avenue). \n\nI had heard many things about the House of Nanking. Among them and most notably, the servers allegedly will bring off-menu dishes to the table once dietary preferences and budget are disclosed. I'm vegetarian, so upon sitting down, refusing a menu, I asked my server to bring me a something vegetarian and spicy. She looked at me as if I were - excuse the expression - speaking Chinese. She had no idea what I meant or what I wanted.  Instead, she turned over the menu, pointed to a section, and said, \"These are all vegetarian dishes\" and left.  When she came back, I further probed and asked what she might recommend or if the kitchen could create something. Nope. The handful of vegetarian dishes on offer all sounded pedestrian and uninspired, none of which was spicy. I once again tried to explain what I had understood to be the strength of the Nanking experience, but she didn't seem to care. So, I gave up. In the process, however, I discovered that all of the soup broths are vegetarian, even the wonton soup (but the wontons have pork), and that none of the vegetarian items has oyster sauce. There are no vegetarian potstickers, but there are veg egg rolls. Notably, few of the traditional favorites of Chinese staple -- such as Kung Pao, General Tso's Chicken, Mongolian Chicken/Beef -- were on this menu. Nothing was spicy.\n\nI started with the Hot & Sour soup. Not great. I appreciated that the soup came out hot (as in temperature), as soup should but often does not. I could see wafts of steam emit from the bowl, but the flavor was neither hot nor sour. Lots of drizzled egg - definitely not vegan - but no julienned vegetables or mushrooms to which I'm accustomed. It wasn't bad, but this is not the flavor profile that would inspire me to re-order in the future.\n\nFor my entree, I had asked a different server, if I could have the Sesame Chicken (EVERYONE around me ordered it and raved) but with tofu instead. The man refused, shaking his head. Then I asked him about some of the veg entrees on offer. Are there vegetables in the tofu dish? Was the mushroom dish deep fried or stir fried?  He walked away, uninterested. On this particular day, the indifference of the staff is not something that engendered affection. Had my mood been different, I may have chalked it up to \"Chinatown\" charm - like a Jewish deli in NY in which the snarly responses are part of the ambiance - but even in the hustle and bustle of delicatessens in Manhattan, there is a sense that the indifference is part of the gestalt. Here, I felt like the man couldn't be bothered. I thought at that point of just paying the bill and leaving, but I really wanted to sample an offering from the Nanking Province of SF, as it was unlikely that I'd be coming back anytime soon. So I asked him if the Salt & Pepper Mushroom dish had a sauce. He answered, \"Deep Fried\" (which it wasn't), and walked away. He understood English, proved moments later when I told him that I'd just go with the Salt & Pepper Mushrooms. His response? \"No cancellations.\" Not endearing.\n\nThe mushroom dish was in the range of decent to good, but ultimately boring and uninspired as I had feared. This was literally a plate of small button mushrooms in a brown sauce with fried basil (nice touch), not a mixture of different varietals of mushrooms. The sauce had flavor - the menu said that all sauces were original creations of the Chef/Owner Peter Fang - and I appreciated that, but it would have been more tolerable as a side dish or something shared. On the plus side, the food was cooked super quick, arrived hot, and did not appear to contain MSG.\n\nBased on my experience, I can't recommend House of Nanking, but I also can't not recommend it. I won't go back - it's not practical - though my one experience didn't leave me enthralled: I didn't get much help from the staff; I wasn't impressed with the service; and I couldn't order off-menu, which other reviewers claimed to have done. Finally, while I appreciate Mr. Fang's consideration of vegetarians, the menu shows little creativity. Omnivores, however, appeared happy with their Sesame Chicken (and House Noodles), and that was mostly what everyone else ate.\n\nAll in all, the food was a serviceable 3-stars.\nService was a weak 2 stars.", "author": "SalsaBoy S."}

Overall, the food is good. Fresh and tasty. They would have earned an easy five from me had it not been for their famed sesame chicken, which for us turned out to be a pile of seasoned batter with no traces of chicken. So I read it is delish but unfortunately I can't comment on it because I never got to taste it. But what I can comment on is their dubious business practice: How can you call a dish sesame chicken and forget to include chicken? That is wrong. I get that you are busy and you can accidentally let a bad one, or even three, slip, but when you have multiple customers complaining about the same issue -we now realize that this had happened to many others- and still neglect to address the problem, then we are speaking of something else.

The chicken, contained in the dish I ordered, sesame chicken, a speciality of the house, was very tasty.  BUT...I did not expect half of the portion to be sliced sweet potatoes, with the chicken on layered on top, which gives the impression of a large serving.  I also did not expect to pay $4 for hot tea, served in a large beer stein.  I have never paid more than a buck or two for a pot of hot tea in a Chinese restaurant. In summary, the actual entree portion was about the size of a lunch special portion at another restaurant(which would have cost half the price). San Francisco demographics are changing, perhaps things are this way because people are unaware of what restaurant food costs elsewhere? Twenty dollars for one padded entree, a small bowl of rice and a giant glass of hot tea(which is an unruly portion. I suggest going elsewhere unless you have a large wallet.

This is like your typical Chinese food restaurant - loud, squeezy and long waiting line (no reservations) outside. However, it is also dimly lit and has a semblance of an asian fusion restaurant, I guess to cater to a more caucasian crowd?\n\nBeing Asian, I spoke to the lady boss in mandarin, and she showed me a special menu (written in Chinese) which I presume is reserved for Asian customers. She also immediately made recommendations on what to order, even going so far to telling us not to order a certain dish since it was \"not good\" and more catered to a Western palate. In the end, she ended up making all the orders for us since we were rather undecided. I must say, the food was really good and authentic Asian :)\n\nThe signature \"Melt in your mouth calamari\" is definitely the best dish, and really literally melts in your mouth.

Stir fried dishes were regrettably predictable with overly sweet sauce soaked in a sea of grease. A lot of the ingredients were deep fried and then stir fried to achieve a good crispy texture.

I was so happy that they weren't that busy considering that it was a Saturday night. We ordered Shrimp packets to start. Really crisp & delicious. We also ordered Pork & Chicken dumplings. They were so so so soft. Exactly what I wanted & expected. The flavor of the sauce that it came with was also really tasty. The only thing that bummed me out was the Sesame chicken! The chicken was good, but the dish was mostly yams covered with sauce. I felt like the name of the dish should be \"Sesame Yams\". But those dumplings earned 5 stars on their own.

However we certainly enjoyed our lunch here. There was nothing that blew us away, but we recognized the food as just really good food. The pork dumplings were scrumptious, I really liked the sauce as it was on the sweeter side and took the edge off the saltiness of the soy sauce. The house egg noodles were good, simple and filling, and made for a good rice substitution while eating the sesame chicken. The sesame chicken was definitely worth ordering. They do the batter right as it's not too much nor too little too give it that satisfying crunch. The sauce is one of the better sauces I've had. I only wish I had another stomach to try their other dishes.", "author": "David K."}

Last time I came here was a few years ago, and the experience was not so good. So, I thought I gave it a try this time when my friend suggested coming. \n\nOverall, we were pretty disappointed. We ordered onion pancake and pork egg rolls for appetizer. I liked both of the dishes and thought they were unique. We had house fried rice, fried calamari, and one vegetable dish to share. First of all, the fried rice doesn't have the ingredients that were described on the menu (no zucchini, eggplant, sweet potato), and it tasted plain. Second, the fried calamari was saggy and sitting in the lemon flavored sauce. Lastly, the vegetable didn't look appetizing as there were only a few pieces on the plate sitting in some sauce.\n\nI think I wouldn't try House of Nanking again because of the two bad experiences.", "author": "Jamie C."}

Absolutely the worst and rudest service from the moment we walked in. Then - a mix up in the kitchen of two of our four  orders led to a most unique and ridiculous scene I've ever experienced. The manager, after we (myself, wife and two daughters) politely wished to discuss why the honey beef became the garlic beef and why the honey shrimp became the mayonnaise shrimp (the waiter late told me the honey was mayonnaise and sugar) proceeded to literally argue rudely and put her fingers into my daughter's dinner, picking out the shrimp one by one-- with her fingers. When we indicated we would not be paying for the dish, she began shouting at us, with a restaurant full of customers.  She claimed since we had already eaten all of the shrimp we must have liked it. We tried three (my daughter my wife and myself).   The dish was disgusting but the service was worse.  Overall the wait staff was horrible, but as we left no fewer than four staff apologized to us.    \n\nMy days at Nan King are done and I would encourage any and all to try somewhere else.

Honestly less than half of the dishes we ordered we considered even okay in taste. I've had a lot of Chinese food my entire life and I would rate this food as low-quality take out. Each dish we ordered came out at random times and the dishes were messy and unappealing to look at-much less eat. The worst had to be the wonton soup which came in some weird mix of rice, noodle and extremely bland soup water that looked like old dirty rice water! We did not finish a single dish more then half way. \n\nAfter we paid for our food with card and left tip in cash, one of the servers immediate went to collect the receipt and tip as we got up and actually had the audacity to ask FOR MORE TIP.

Read the most recent reviews, and you can judge for yourself...\n\nBased on the 3.5 stars from a quick Yelp search and the long line in front of the restaurant (about 20 people), we decided to give House of Nanking a try...especially after the waitress kept telling us that the wait was no longer than 20 minutes.  She either lied or can't estimate time well because we ended up waiting for over 40 minutes.\n\nThis wouldn't have been a huge problem except for the LOUD, intoxicated homeless guy who kept approaching everybody in line and getting close enough to practically kiss them!  The crazy thing is the restaurant manager and waiters saw the guy soliciting everybody, but did nothing to ensure the safety of their customers in line.  Luckily, my friend is a big guy and would have taken him out with one blow.\n\nSo after finally getting into the restaurant, I noticed that a waitress was wiping down the table with a dirty towel.  The table was soaking wet, and my friend ended up wiping the table off with a napkin.  Three waitresses just watched as he dried the table!  Overall, the restaurant was dirty and a health hazard in many respects.\n\nThe worst part of the experience was definitely the food.  FYI, we ordered three dishes and paid over $43, which included paying for steamed rice.  YES, they charge for \"Uncle Ben's tasting\" steamed rice.  \n\nSo here's the breakdown of why the food was so bad:\n\nSesame chicken = right before the dish was served, we saw the cashier (who had been handling money and credit cards) pick up a handful of sesame seeds and tossed it over ours and another customer's chicken dish.  Gross!  The other issue with the dish is that the thinly sliced sweet potatoes were not cooked all the way through, and they were bland.  The actual chicken was okay, but nothing spectacular.\n\nSalt and Pepper Shrimp with Mushrooms = The entire dish was deep fried and bland.  The shrimps were deep fried in a tempura batter, but it needed both salt and pepper.  The mushrooms were soaking in a puddle of oil.  This dish should be called Bland Shrimp with Oily Mushrooms.\n\nLast but not least was the crispy noodle dish with beef.  This was the most disgusting dish that I have ever eaten from a Chinese restaurant.  There were three of us in the party, and none of us could eat more than a few bites.  The \"crispy\" noodles were basically placed on a plate, and the sauce which consisted mostly of vinegar was poured over it.  There was way too much vinegar for that dish.  We couldn't tell what else was on the dish.  I think I recognized remnants of beef somewhere in the dish.\n\n4 words on the customer service: \"IT SUCKED BIG TIME!\"\n\nSo the good news is that I'm happy to write this review for my fellow Yelpers to help them make an informed decision.  The bad news is we all have heartburn, and we're on vacation!  Ugh!", "author": "Grace L."}

To be honest, I don't remember what we ordered because we pretty much let the wait staff pick all the dishes, anything that was super good and enough for 10 people. We had numerous dishes, all of which were super delicious and left me in a food coma. So when you come here, just tell them to order you the best menu items and trust that your tummy will thank you later. Service was...well, you know how service at Chinese establishments are, so keep your expectations low in that department.  Not sure how much the menu has changed in 6 years, but I loved this place. I walked by here recently, and there was a line out the door, so my assumption is that it's still living up to the recommendations.

I understand that some people fault the place because it isn't authentic-- but on the other hand I've been to China and have a mental aversion to dishes with unrecognizable animal parts. Bottom line, the food here is consistently delicious, even if it is modified to meet Customer tastes. I first came here years ago, before the most recent renovation, when there was a counter, and Francis Ford Coppola was having lunch. I figured I made a good choice. Since then, every visit to San Francisco includes at least one meal here. I've never been disappointed. What I especially appreciate is that your server will let you know when you over order.

How about our server giving us 4 waters from the same area that the dishes were being washed or maybe his dirty hands that were all over the rims of the glasses when he set them on our dirty, sticky table?  Maybe it would be another server eating a hard boiled egg at a table in the main seating area and then spitting out the parts she didn't want and then drying bowls with a towel that she had on her lap??  Should I mention the dirty plates that were at our table??  \n\nThe sizzling rice soup that wasn't sizzling but actually looked like it was left over from another party?  The garlic beef we ordered that never showed up until we had completely finished our horrible meal?  The rude server???  Kathy, I could go on and on but it's not worth my time.

In the go-go 90s they used to stay open much later. It could be 10 at night and we would look at each other and say, \"shrimp cakes!\" and that would be it. HoN has always been inexpensive, but they never used to be cheap. Now they are both, and I'm sad to see the loss of a great North Beach institution.\n\nTo be fair, House of Nanking probably jumped the shark several years ago. I haven't frequented the place much during the last 10 years so I can only imagine they have degraded by degrees--or perhaps their quality dropped suddenly when a certain standard-maintaining chef died or retired. That certain chef is sorely missed.\n\nI have uploaded a photo of their current version of shrimp cakes, and you really have to be familiar with the music of Neil Young to fully grapple with such a stunning drop in care and vision. They used to be round, carefully pinched and textured pucks stuffed with shrimp, onions, peas, shallots, and other vegetables, and topped with a delicately spicy ginger peanut sauce and sprinkled with minced scallions. Truly divine. And now, like Neil, just tired sadness.\n\nI won't linger on in the abstract: this is about the Nanking that was, and is; not about me! Suffice it to say that the food now cannot be distinguished from many of the other nearby quick and greasy Chinese purveyors, and survives only on the power of legend. In time, that too shall pass. A single tear rolls down my cheek.\n\nGoodbye, House of Nanking.", "author": "Gary P."}

They have one menu for Chinese in Chinese and one for American in English. \n\nFish soup with thin noodle, tofu and wonton. Not Cantonese one! It's so good!

I took all the recommendations from other reviews but was still so let down with the entire experience. \n\nThere was a small wait when we arrived about 10 minutes and when we were finally taken through the tiny restaurant the person leading us just signaled us where to go because we couldn't hear her over the noise. I was starving and ready for a fabulous meal but the people who worked here just seemed to want to feed everyone and get them out as soon as possible. \n\nFirst let's start with the ambience. We came on a Sunday night and it was dark, very crowded ( no space between you and other tables) and VERY loud.  The place is dark and messy and they store all there stuff all over the place. I'm surprised this place has passed a health inspection. The chairs are so uncomfortable but that is the smallest of my complaints. We got menus (which look like they are the originals from the 80s) with pen marks crossing out the old prices and hand written new prices (so unprofessional). Also the plates we were given were different. Mine was white and my husbands was a blue bowl. All of these things would have been excusable had the food been good. \n\nWe were then greeted by a rude woman who asked \"what do you want!?\" We ordered sesame chicken, house noodles, and shrimp packets. She then grabbed the menus from the table and walked away. I was going to order one more thing but I guess she thought it was enough food for two people and cut me off. \n\nAbout 2 minutes later we got the shrimp packets which were disgusting! Literally a piece of dough with frozen peas and 1 tiny shrimp inside doused in peanut sauce. Gross. I then asked for a knife and the guy said \"you want a knife?! Ha!\" as if it was such a ridiculous question (he ended up brining two knives and just dropped them into the table).\n\nA few minutes later came our house noodles which are similar to Top Ramen. They were ok but nothing special. Then about 10 minutes passed and we got the sesame chicken which was over breaded, over friend, and drenched in sauce. I asked for some water but the lady just shot me a look (never got the water). \n\nWe then asked for the check because we were getting sick from the abundance of sauce and oil we just ate. No one asked how our meal was or if we wanted anything else. We then walked around Chinatown and would look into every nice restaurant and were so upset that we chose Nanking. \n\nDo not go here!

He came back multiple times within a span of a few minutes and didn't give us a chance to peruse the menu. When we were ready to order, he grunted all the way through and didn't even make eye contact.\n\n----What we got----\nHot Tea: WHAT KIND OF ASIAN RESTAURANT CHARGES $3.50 FOR TEA? The tea came in a mug, real authentic...\n\nShrimp Packets - Fried wonton wrappers with shrimp inside: definitely didn't live up to the hype and the ratio of wrapper to meat was off\n\nSteam pork and veggie dumplings with spicy soy sauce: pretty good, I liked the spicy soy sauce\n\nSesame Chicken - w/ sweet potato and garnished w cucumber salad: unique dish, nothing memerable\n\n\"Melt in your mouth\" Fried Calamari: this was disgusting! It was soggy and oily.. If I could give this negative stars, I would! Melt in your mouth? Joke was on us, the oil and batter was melting all over our mouths.  My stomach is churning just thinking about how oily these things were. Blech!\n\nPork Chop - bone in: I didn't like how they gave us a huge pork chop with no knife and expected us to eat it with chopsticks.  Since this is family style, it should've been chopped up\n\nLettuce Cups with Shrimp - battered and lightly fried shrimp with mixed veggies: I've never had lettuce cups with fried shrimp and mixed veggies, but I don't think I'm a fan of it.  My speculation is that they took a popular dish (fried shrimp and mixed veggies) and made it into a lettuce cup dish by adding lettuce.\n\nMy takeaway is that this place caters towards American tourists and if you don't look like a tourist, you won't be treated with respect.

I can literally give you a list of negative moments from my one visit.\n- we had to call our waiter twice just to get our drink order in, he left as soon as he took the order and never came back\n- Chow mein was burned to a crisp\n- A lady came by asked me if I was ready to order, snatched my menu, and gave it to another table and left!\n- they brought out our orders one plate at a time in 10 minute intervals, just enough time to have everyone's food be cold :)\n- mid meal my friend asked a lady for a sprite since we noticed where they got their water from, it never came\n- lots of other things, like no hellos, how are you, basically what you would expect from a busy McDonald's on their worst day\n\nWhat forever became an inside joke to me and my friends was that at the end of this root canal experience was when we went up to pay a lady snatched our receipt and tried to charge us 20 dollars more than what it said. She said that was the tip she had earned and refused to accept anything less. My friend just kind of stood there for a minute before my wife jumped in and said she couldn't legally charge us whatever tip she wanted, especially given that she didn't even service our table. Another server came up and said well people usually tip 10% so you can tip that instead, that's when I jumped in and said alright so it is up to us to determine what we tip,  we then paid for our meal and left!

He comes up to our table, talks to the people looking Chinese asking if we speak Mandarin.  One of us says he does and I say I don't but I understand some Cantonese.  He then asks us what village we were from.  He seemed to recognized my ancestor's village.  Next, he asks if any of us have been to House of Nanking before which none of us have.  So, he recommends he orders for us since he can relate to our ancestral village.  After scribbling something in chinese in his notepad, he hands it to the cook and he moves onto the next table.\n\nAbout 10-20 minutes later, we receive about 5 different dishes none of which I know what they are.  One is a veggie dish which I think is bok choy with garlic.  Next is something that resembles a Taiwanese oyster pancake with brown sauce on top.  Then there's a fish soup dish.  There's also a tofu dish with greens for our vegetarian friend.  Finally, there's a 5th unknown dish which I still don't know what it is.  The food was pretty good.  I expect something cheap since the place looks somewhat of a dirty chinese restaurant hole-in-the-wall style and they have minimum wage immigrants.  What I didn't expect was a $90 bill for the 5 dishes.  That's about $18 a dish!  I expect maybe $10-12 tops but that's being generous.

It was really difficult to write the review however when I got to my hotel room and opened up the packaging I was so disappointed. My life is very busy as traveling across the globe is part of it.

Unfortunately the food I had that evening from your establishment wasn't repairable. Because I'd spent the day walking I was too fatigued to come back, otherwise I would have given ya'll a chance to make it right. Alas, I was visiting and may not be in the area for a time again. I'd read several reviews and the reason I choose the sesame chicken was because it IS your signature dish. After writing this updated review I went and read other recent reviews. They all had the same experience. FOOD AND SERVICE SUCKS. I'm not sure why you are writing to make it right because you should've gotten it right the first time. You and your shop get no sympathy from me and I'll be sure to tell everyone of my traveling buddies to stay far far away from your establishment.

Fish soup has great broth, wontons, and plenty of other good items. The potstickers (crispy) have a great peanut sauce with bold flavor. The calamari had good crisp and was nice and tender. Pork belly off the chart - be in the mood for fat because the pork is nicely layered - the sauce is excellent. Paired with flowering tea - tasty and quite entertaining to watch. \n\nSecond meal we went for a few different items. We switched up the soup for sizzling rice soup - similar broth but brand new flavor with lemon, peas, chicken, and of course, rice. Potstickers were a definite reorder and gobbled because you could count to 10. Sesame chicken, shrimp with mushrooms, and saut\u00e9ed vegetables (pea shoots and spinach with garlic and onion I think) rounded out the meal. Sesame chicken is popular and has great flavor! Also includes sweet potatoes. The shrimp was nice and crispy and mushrooms carried great flavor and were cooked perfectly. Vegetables were nice and light with delicious garlic flavor (who doesn't love garlic!?).  Paired with fruit tea - light and, you guessed it, fruity - but not overpowering.

When I was a little kid, before I lived in San Francisco, my mom and I would come here after recommendations from friends and family. Came here again and was just a bit disappointed. Its still quite good, but not as good as when I came here ten years prior. \n\nAnyways, the potstickers with the thick sauce is awesome and the Nanking chicken is a must order. It is in a sketchy neighborhood and a bum actually came in grabbed a bunch of our potstickers and threw them at another guest. (I can't make this sh*t up) The staff apologized and gave us a new plate and I appreciated they did this and I thought they handled the situation as best they could. Just letting everyone know though that its not that staff's fault that its in a bad neighborhood. Don't let it deter you from checking out Nanking!", "author": "Cody M."}

The good news is there was no wait for dinner, but after eating there, we now understand why.  The quality and service have really gone downhill.   We ordered the sesame chicken and chicken fried rice.  The sesame chicken meat was very fatty and the fried rice had very little flavor.  The waitress never came back to check on us or offer us any sauce.   Very disappointed.

Not kidding, the reason we flew from Orange County to San Francisco was mainly just to eat at House of Nanking. My husband I find ourselves on a weekly basis commiserating that there just isn't anything as good to eat in SoCal.\n\nOften for dinner there can be a bit of a line. It is a small restaurant so there usually is a wait, but the line moves extremely fast. They seat diners as quickly as possible - often sitting right next to complete strangers (this is not a great restaurant for an intimate, romantic meal). The service is very fast, abrupt and you may even feel a bit like they are pressuring you to eat and leave quickly.\n\nWe find the staff's rudeness kinda funny. They are absolutely on top of all your needs - refilling drinks, bringing food out quickly, etc. If it was bad service, I'd be frustrated. Instead, it's just a staff that is too busy to be friendly and too aware that there is a line of people waiting to get in to allow you to sit and sip on the last of your diet coke for 20 minutes after your food is finished.\n\nStill, despite all that, it is worth it. The food is outstanding, memorable and will leave you truly satisfied.", "author": "Kaitlyn M."}

The food is really good but it's just better-than-usual Americanized Chinese food with interesting taste combinations that make it a place to seek out from time to time. \n\nSo the primary novelty, if you know what you are doing, is to just tell the order person, usually the owner, an amount that your table is willing to spend and see how he works that all in. 15-20 dollars a person usually nails it in terms of a dumpling appetizer and a plate per person. It makes it a lot easier in terms of figuring out what you want :(the menu isn't that big but you don't have to second guess yourself). The first main plate is almost always the Nanking Chicken which is basically Sesame Chicken, Hunan style. The second plate is always something more interesting. We've had some sort of odd peanut crusted chicken one time, and last night, we had spinach salad with fried fish. \n\nAnyway, it is a tourist trap and it is basically Americanized Chinese food with a twist. But it's still very good... and terse service makes it very efficient once you get past the line.", "author": "Hj W."}

I came here for a quick bite, and while it was very speedy, the food was less than memorable.  I couldn't help but notice how decidedly Americanized this Chinese restaurant looked and felt.  Each table had napkins with a fork and plate (no chopsticks or rice bowls - oh the horror!), there was a serious lack of Asian customers, and the decor felt more like a diner than a Chinese restaurant.\n\nWe ordered the sesame chicken with sweet potatoes, house made noodles, and garlic calamari.  All foods were tasty, but heavily fried and/or salted.  The calamari was okay, but the batter was more soggy than anything else due to the garlic sauce.  I think a better approach would be to have the garlic sauce in a dish on the side to leave the calamari crispy.  The noodles and chicken lacked the hot wok flavor that characterizes my favorite Chinese dishes.  I enjoyed the house noodles the most, but they still tasted like something I could make at home.  Unlike other Yelpers, I didn't mind the service too much.  The waitress was cordial enough. \n\nI would suggest coming to House of Nanking if you are in a hurry to have a meal in less than 20 minutes.  However, for any family gathering or authentic Chinese food, I'd head over to R&G Lounge, Hong Kong Lounge, or Kirin Chinese Restaurant.", "author": "Brittany N."}

Coming back for Thanksgiving weekend I knew I had to squeeze a trip to Chinatown to get some more House of Nanking.  This place has become my Mecca for Chinese food.  It can get busy and crowded there so try to come during a non peak hour. Just like last time the place was packed and so going during non peak hours you have a better chance of getting seated right away.  Be prepared to get friendly with your neighbors because it's almost all community seating.\n\nIn 2009 I ate here twice and my husband and I got the following items: vegetarian noodle bowl, crispy calamari with spicy coconut sauce, sesame chicken with sweet potatoes, and lettuce wraps with chicken.  All four of the dishes were delicious.  My favorite item has got to be the lettuce wraps with various veggies like cucumber, peas, onions with pineapple and mint with chicken wrapped in crispy lettuce.  For my 2013 trip we ordered the calamari and vegetable noodles.  Still just as tasty as I remember.  Adding in some steamed rice we mixed the remaining sauce from the calamari for a spicy and sweet treat.\n\nThe teas are really amazing, especially the blossoming flower tea and the antioxidant fruit tea (which you can order hot or cold).\n\nSome people may not like how rushed and hustle bustle this place is. I don't mind it it at all.  I've been to enough Chinese, Japanese, and Vietnamese restaurants where this is what to expect from a business that hasn't been overly Americanized, and I am more than ok with it.  My food comes out quickly and I don't have to deal with making pleasantries with the server. I want my food and she wants to get paid.  This is a mutual thing to agree upon.  \n\nAlso if you're not sure what you want to order, just tell them how hungry you are and say \"pick something for me.\"", "author": "Elizabeth C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-04-10", "description": "SUMMARY:\nI'm 1.5 gen Chinese-American, but I've grown up learning what authentic Chinese food is. The Bay Area has a growing number of authentic Chinese restaurants, but HoN is not one of them. First, HoN is neither authentic nor good Chinese food. You don't get what you pay for here - it is really expensive for disgusting food. Secondly, you get worse-than-usual Chinese customer service to boot.\n\nContinuation of story from previous review:\n\nOur bill was something like $25 per person for sharing 3 dishes and a soup. Go to any respectable place in Oakland Chinatown and it'd be like $30 TOTAL for 3 dishes and a soup, and it'd be good food. R&G Lounge is even more expensive, but at least their quality measures up.\n\nWe wanted to leave no tip for our experience. However, Chinese/Korean restaurants and services will typically come after you and say, \"You didn't leave enough tip.\" We half-expected the waitress to start yelling at us in front of our visiting friend and the completely packed restaurant so we left a small tip that would show that we didn't forget to pay tip, this is exactly how we feel about you and your food and service.\n\nI NEVER rate a Chinese restaurant based on its service, so this 1 star is for the food alone. I'll mention service but it won't affect the number of stars I give b/c I rate purely on food quality. I've been to many really good Chinese restaurants with rude service. In fact, I have a rule of thumb - the dirtier the restaurant and the ruder the service, the better the food. HoN has no right to be cocky and rude when the quality of their food deserves to shut the restaurant down. There's a couple legit places in Chinatown, e.g. R&G Lounge just a block away, and extremely legit places further out west in Sunset.\n\nPeople differ on the importance of service vs. food quality. I say that if they had AMAZING food with the RUDE service experienced (even though this rudeness was above and beyond other rude restaurants I've been to), I'd be giving 5 stars. My bf says that if at least the service was good, he wouldn't be complaining as much about the food. He wouldn't think it's good, but at least he wouldn't be demeaned like a child. We paid for our visiting friend because we were so embarrassed and sorry to have taken him to such a bad place. Due to how repulsive the food was to our taste buds, we didn't finish any of our dishes except the soup and boxed it all up...and nobody wanted to take it home. My bf and I ended up taking it but I refuse to eat it, so it's all on him. :P\n\nI think it is important to steer everybody away from this restaurant until they improve in the quality of their food first and foremost, and secondly, their customer service. If they never reach the second goal, that would be fine, but for heaven's sake, make edible food!", "author": "Esther Y."}

I have never been so we tried to grab dinner there about a year ago. Unfortunately it was Chinese New Year so Nanking was closed which is understandable so we figure we try again when the opportunity presented itself. Last night we decided to make a trip to the city and finally see why so many people love Nanking.\n\nRegretfully, Nanking wouldn't let us in. We arrived at 9:20 PM but a very rude waitress told us that they were closed even though their web site states that they close at 10 PM on a Friday night (you see the same thing when you do a Google search). She essentially slammed the door on us as we were about to walk in (door was propped open as we were approaching the restaurant). There were clearly people inside still eating and waiting for food and there were enough open tables to seat us. Plus there were a few other customers who arrived at the same time as us but were also turned away so Nanking felt the extra business was not worth their time.\n\nThis is the first time I have ever written a review for a restaurant I have yet to eat at which does seem odd but I feel people need to know how deceptive Nanking is about their closing times and how rude their service people are. Yes, I do know that service at a traditional Chinese restaurant is not what you expect from most restaurants and I am totally OK with that as I am a Bay Area native and have dined at traditional Chinese restaurants before (you don't go for the service but for the food!). But Come On Man! You couldn't even at least say sorry we are closed or at least honor the closing time you post on your web site?! \n\nWe tried pleading our case to the waitress telling her that we drove all the way from Redwood City just to try Nanking but she didn't even bother to listen to us. I get the feeling that Nanking is coming down with a strong case of arrogance since they know they are the renowned Chinese restaurant in a city like SF which prides itself on good food. Note to the management, if you want to keep your restaurant as the top Chinese restaurant in SF, honor your closing times and treat your potential customers with a bit more respect. I can easily get good Chinese food at so many places and I hope you make the necessary changes so that this doesn't happen again to any one else. I've struck out twice with Nanking. Not sure if I will try for a third time to eat at this supposedly really good Chinese restaurant that apparently felt I was not worth their time to be a patron at their establishment.", "author": "Gus E."}

Our plates and spoons were dirty with oily bottoms and dried food stuck to them (Bad impression). Tried their HIGHLY recommended Melt In Your Mouth Calamari which was just soggy little pieces of Calamari drenched in a very weird sour garlic sauce. The Sizzing Rice Soup was the best dish; crispy rice in a tasty Basil Chicken broth. Also had the Scallop in garlic black bean sauce; very sweet sauce with shredded assorted sizes of Scallops on top of spinach which was disappointing as well. Also found a random Shrimp tail in the Scallop dish which shows lack of attention to detail and consistency.\n\nAfter our meal, I've come to realize that there are 2 menus?! Why was my group not given the choice of the authentic Chinese food menu? If translation is an issue, I highly recommend getting new updated menus that infuse both so everyone gets an equal choice on food selections. I was also going to comment on the old rugged paper menus inside the plastic sleeves; they looked very unappealing and chewed up.", "author": "Alex K."}

It's an incredible fusion of the various styles of cooking, with Mr. Fang's signature touch on several of the dishes they serve.  \n\nThere are a lot of wonderful things I can say about this place...  Over the years I've developed some fond memories.  If you've never been here before, don't hesitate, and don't let the long lines or communal seating arrangement scare you away.  Enjoy the food, because every single thing here is good, and make your own memories.\n\nTIP:  If it's your first time and you & your table are indecisive, ask the staff to order for you.  You won't be disappointed!\n\nANOTHER TIP:  Be adventurous and don't go for the stuff you find at Brandy Ho's or your local mall's food court.  It's a real shame when people come to House of Nanking for egg rolls, pot stickers, sesame chicken, and fried rice.  Instead, try something you won't find on the menu anywhere else.", "author": "Jaszon S."}

Unfortunately, after my last experience here it is unlikely that I will visit this restaurant again. It looks like whatever left of the service has gone down the tubes and the overall unremarkable quality of food paired with the crappy service no longer seems worth the long wait.\n\nAfter waiting for 1 hour in the cold, our party of three were initially asked to take a table that seats 4. However as soon as we sat down and old waitress came along and yelled \"NO\" we could not sit on that table and instead were taken to another table for 6 where we shared the table with another party of 3. I don't mind sharing a table but who yells at their customers?\n\nThe quality of the dishes didn't seem to match what I recall from my previous visits. For example the szechuan chicken appears to have reduced to only about half plate of chicken and the rest was sliced potatoes. \n\nWhen we received the bill, I was shocked to see that a gratuity in excess of 20% had already been added to the total! We were not even a large group - just 3 people. \n\nTowards the end we were having a conversation after finishing our meals when a waitress came along and asked if I had signed the receipt and when I said yes, she rudely asked me to give it to her as if she wanted us to get up and leave immediately. \n\nEven though I have visited this place several times before and have actually brought friends/family here when I've had visitors in town I will no longer be doing so as the crappy service combined with just OK and not so remarkable food no longer seems worth the time visiting this restaurant anymore.", "author": "Pranab P."}

I was brought here by friends when I first moved to San Francisco and have been a big fan ever since.  I'm a vegetarian and every non meat dish knocks it out of the park, but my staples are the house noodles, string beans, fried tofu and eggplant. My non vegetarian friends are equally impressed by their meat and seafood dishes.  The lines are long but that is just testament to how good the food is.  It is no frills, simple interior with service that gets the job done----the Ritz Carlton it is not.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-11-15", "description": "Before heading up to SF, I polled my Facebook and Twitter friends on places to eat for the obligatory marathon victory dinner. As you can see, I keep traditions in tact. Nanking was mentioned several times however it wasn't exactly close to our hotel so we had a fun (read: challenging) time mapping out a route to get here without having to take the car. \n\nThe journey proved to be quite an adventure. It was freezing cold and the wait for the trolley was 30 minutes long. Good thing I took a nap. The trolley stopped a mile away from our destination so it was another uphill walk (mind you I just ran up a few hills earlier that day so this was NOT fun) and in through China Town before we reached Nanking. And then there was a line. I was thankful for my jacket. It was freezing cold out there.\n\nThe line outside Nanking is common but moves fast. It's not first come, first serve either. It's actually controlled by the amount of space they have, so if you have a small party you'll be seated faster. Since it was just the two of us, we were standing in the back, managed to take a few pictures, and were seated shortly after that but near the door. If you complain about your seat or want to switch, you have to wait outside again so we braved the elements and the rush of wind from outside. \n\nNanking is a well oiled machine and a tightly run operation. They're all about quick and efficient service here. You can't lolligag and take your time shooting the breeze here. They need to keep the tables going. Upon being seated we were given menus and water, the next time around she brought us our order of flower tea, and then took our dinner order. There's no \"can you give us 5 minutes please?\" So look at the menu or know what you want in advance. \n\nThe Flower Tea is amazing. It's loose leaf tea and a flower bud. The flower bud opens up in the hot water and creates an amazing taste bud tantalizing flavor. It was perfect for the cold weather and there's nothing quite like it. \n\nNext up was our pork pot sticker appetizer. This was my first time trying pork and it was similar to chicken. I loved the flavor and the sauce. I could have easily had a few more. \n\nOur main dishes consisted of the house favorite - the sesame chicken, salt/pepper shrimp with mushrooms, and the chow mein. The sesame chicken was amazing. The chicken was perfectly spiced and crunchy and the green beans went along with it very well. The chow mein was a little too much for me. The sauce was very heavy and I could barely eat it. The shrimp and mushroom were also good. I preferred the mushrooms vs the shrimp though. \n\nOverall, I think this was an amazing meal. I would definitely come here again if I'm in town.", "author": "Sukhraj B."}

They dump the food on the table and walk away with barely a backward glance. No smiles, no pleasantries and apparently they have a problem with ice because they look at you funny when you ask for some in your water. \n\nMy mother, who is allergic to dairy, refused to eat the wonton soup due to its uncharacteristic milky appearance. My dad asked the waitress what was it that gave the soup it's creamy texture. She said something in a thick Chinese accent that we just couldn't understand. She walked away in a huff. I thought maybe it was coconut milk. My dad shrugged and went back to eating his soup. However, a few minutes later our waitress magically appears at our table with a GIANT tub of powdered Coffee Mate! They put Coffee Mate in wonton soup!

The wonton soup has a milky broth that had a strange taste to it. The famous house of Nanking sesame chicken was the greatest disappointment 1. It was too sweet and salty 2. The chicken was over cooked and dry 3. The sweet potato didn't really did much to compliment the chicken. All in all the place caters to tourist and white people who don't know any better.

It is very rare for me to rank a Chinese restaurant so highly since I am Chinese and I know good, authentic Chinese food...HOWEVER this place is an exception.\n\nI came here a few times and every single time I have had a fantastic meal.\nIf this place is so good, why is are there such negative reviews? Well, I figured out that there are a few reasons...however, its definitely not because of the taste of the food. I think the reason why its ranked lower is that it can get quite loud in the restaurant ( its a Chinese restaurant, what you do expect?) and service is seemingly bad but thats really just another Chinese thang (they may not say hi or bye to you, etc). The female owner seems a bit harsh and rude but thats just her being her; she means well and wants her customers to eat well.\n\nFood wise: There are few things i LOVE. \n1.) Get the house noodles. JUST GET EM. SO GOOD. I don't know what they put in it to make it taste so good. Its a secret recipe and its a house special; just get it--no question.\n\n2.) Sesame chicken- flavorful and not too overwhelming salty. The portion was great too.\n\n3.) Eggplant- I LOVE IT. Get it if you want something other than meat. its really well made.\n\n4.) Potstickers -Drenched in vinegar, soy sauce and some kind of chili. This is a great appetizer\n\n5.) Tea dranks -filled in large beer like cups.....taste great though! \n\nI will be coming back here over and over and over again.", "author": "Eileen W."}

We stopped in for a late lunch on a Sunday afternoon and were pleased to be shown to a table right away. Unfortunately, that was the best part of the service experience. The food--as always--was excellent, but the surly, inefficient staff was irritating. \n\nWe received menus right after sitting down - one-page \"rice plate\" menus. We had to ask twice for full menus, which were effectively thrown at us. A young Asian couple seated after us received full menus immediately. Hmmm...\n\nWith lunch ordered, we sat back and waited...and waited...and waited. Even though we didn't order family-style, that's the way we were served. As a result, one person received his order and FINISHED EATING before the last person was served. One person ordered a rice plate and was promptly served a large plate of steamed rice, only to receive the actual entree about 25 minutes later.\n\nAdding to the unpleasant experience was the young man delivering the food. He sauntered up, dropped the plate on the end of the table and walked away without announcing the dish or attempting to learn who ordered it. \n\nInterestingly, a number of cases of beer were stacked in full view in the dining room. On top was a wet, used dish rag. The space next to the rag was used as a staging area for food awaiting table delivery.  \n\nThe bad attitudes and spotty service make it very difficult to recommend this place, despite its strong reputation and great food.", "author": "Steve L."}

We weren't sure if we just ordered or what was happening. \n\nCouple minutes later the waiter came and took our orders. And 10 minutes later we had our food(super fast!). I ordered the famous sesame chicken and I can say that it was amazing. The honey sauce is something magical and the sweet potatoes perfectly complemented the dish! It was by far the best Chinese food I have ever eaten. I do recommend ordering mild as the regular version is spicy by default.\n\nYou are definitely not coming here for the service!

We got three little leg pieces and a few joints that you couldn't get anything out of. I felt so barbaric trying to crack open my food with my fingers.\n\nThe Beef Wraps were filled with what I've come to expect Chinese delivery beef to taste like. These stringy and chewy beef pieces either had an \"off night\" or Mid-west Chinese delivery is actually quite fantastic and of equal taste and quality to Nanking.\n\nThe Sesame Chicken was the least impressive, according to our party of four. Most people liked the standard taste of the Chow Mein, which was actually good.\n\nI loved my blossoming tea, it was so beautiful.

The bathroom... which was blocked by a few servers who refused to move to let the lady out of the bathroom, or to let me in. I ended up squeezing past them as they stood there staring at me, unmoving.\n\nNow I've only seen this type of bathroom at shady 7-11 stops. The floor was soaking wet. There was so much water (hopefully) on the floor, they required a raised mat to for you to step on in front of the sink. The toilet was stained and absolutely filthy. The soap dispenser couldn't have had anti-bacterial soap in it... it felt more like a mixture of dish soap and water, with the same consistency. Gross, gross, gross.

Apparently ownership changed a few years back so perhaps this is why, but needless to say we were less than pleased with the experience. \n\nMenu was limited (the menu on yelp is accurate and inclusive of all choices) food was mediocre at best and service was AWFUL. Staff seemed miserable and literally stood over the top of my husband while he signed the check. Frankly, I'm ok with poor aka \"short\" service in this type of place considering it obviously stays busy, but the lack of remote concern regarding our dining experience or even eye contact for that matter, was disturbing. Especially considering we waited patiently in line for almost an hour at and were clearly to eager to try a \"local\" favorite. Our enthusiasm was greeted by a staff consisting of the seemingly inconvenienced.  \n\nOverall expect nothing at all traditional or unique. Seriously, I had to ask twice at the table for chopsticks (both ignored as staff looked straight at me and turned to walk away) so ended up going to the register to ask a third and fourth time (I'm not kidding....4 TIMES!) for them myself. Truthfully though I was so excited to finally try this place out that I didn't care. Still super pumped, WITH my hard earned chop sticks, I rushed back... to shear disappointment. \n\nIn short, the food wasn't horrible, it just simply wasn't anything spectacular or unique for that matter either. It arrived quick after we finally ordered about 15-20mins after sitting down so it was hot and I will note, the peanut sauce on the \"shrimp pockets\" was tasty but nothing that I would return for. Regardless hot mediocre Chinese is better than cold so I gave an extra star for this alone.  \n\nMain dishes were smaller than average sized and came with no rice or any other side item. This is also not a huge issue considering most portions are often too large BUT, I'd rather at least have good Chinese (X&Y or other various places in South Bay) and take leftovers, than pricey small portions of mediocre Chinese with poor service. \n\nFinally, In all fairness, maybe we caught it a bad time (5pm on a Sunday) but I'd do yourself a favor and either ask the locals where they eat or at least avoid waiting in line for a potentially similar deflating experience. Instead, go somewhere with a line of 'returning' customers rather than out of towners/tourists and avoid an epic yelp fail.", "author": "Wendy F."}

Don't worry about Chinese I'm sure they'll help you with the menu in Chinese if you wish.

It's a hole in the wall place with excellent food.  Ordered the goji berry tea, onion pancake with is peanut sauce and the Nanking chicken.  The order came very fast.  Within 10 minutes. The goji berry tea is great.  Served in a mug with the goji inside.  I was hesitant at first but it's very good.  The onion pancake is a nice and crispy on the outside and super green onion inside.  A good appetizer.  The Nanking chicken is the star of this show.  It's a boneless deep fried chicken with sweet sauce.  Almost like sweet and sour chicken without the sour.  It is also accompanied with fried yam smothered in sauce.  If the yam wasn't drenced in sweet sauced it would have gotten 5.  But you know, your here for the chicken and not the yam.  If your in Chinatown and you need to check Zagat rated place, SON!", "author": "Chris P."}

From the moment you arrive you know this isn't going to be a good experience.  The lady who runs the front is sickened by the sight of you and let's you know it.  She tells you to wait outside, then grunts at you when she has a table open. Next, she'll proceed to throw the menus at you before walking away in disgust. \n\nThe staffs treatment of you is almost comical or Saturday Night Liveish, but it isn't a joke and it is happening to you. Why am I not getting to the food?? Because it is as pedestrian as it gets. Multiple items on the menu aren't even available. And yes, when you order something they don't have, they get pissed, walkaway, and punish you by making you wait 10 minutes or more to get your chance to order again. You better get it right this time!! And whatever you do, don't you dare ask for ice cubes to go with your water!\n\nFinally, the cleanliness or lack of takes the cake. I'll have to say what I witnessed was a first. The angry server who was completely flabbergasted that I wanted ice in my warm glass of water is the same guy who clears the tables. Here's where it gets good.... Instead of using a clean cloth and some sort of disinfectant to clean the tables he gets much more creative. He takes the previously drunk from water glasses still on the table, sticks his hands in them, gets his hands wet with the saliva filled backwash water, then sprays that water on your table, but don't worry, he uses a filthy rag to mop up the saliva water that just cleaned your table. \n\nThey never come back to see if you need anything or if the food is good. They don't care. The only time they care or pretend to be nice is when you get the bill. Then and only then do they feign interest in you. Worst experience ever and there are 228 other reviews that sound similar.", "author": "David W."}

We wanted a taste of Chinese food, and she suggested this one. We arrived and at first glance were hesitant to go in... it was a 'hole in the wall' type restaurant, and as soon as we opened the door it was evident this was a real neighborhood place, authentic chinese food with no ambiance. We had actually made a reservation, but it was obviously not necessary - this was not a place that one made reservations at. We were actually seated right away, and before we had a chance to take a breath the waitress was trying to take our order! I had read on the reviews that they turned the tables over quickly but this was a bit too much. Anyway, I politely told her we had just sat down. She was actually fine with that, brought us some requested tea, and only came back when she saw we were ready. The tea was served in big glass mugs (almost like a beer mug) rather than traditional tea cups, but the tea was excellent, and very hot! There was a blooming flower inside, coming out of the wrapped tea leave holder which was pretty cool. \nWe ordered Onion Rice cakes ( A bit too onion-y for our tastes), wonton soup (fantastic!!!), chinese pork dumplings (Terrific!) and egg rolls (mostly pork, good flavor but not what we were used to). We also split an entree of their special sesame chicken (very flavorful) served with white rice (clumpy, not hot, but serviceable). Considering what we got, the bill was very reasonable. It took a bit of time for our server to give us our check, but we sure didn't feel rushed like we had initially. She was very pleasant, chatted with us a bit, and was very efficient throughout. In fact the other server that brought our food was very nice as well. We noted a line of people waiting outside to get in, soon after we had sat down. Most waited 15-20 minutes to get a table, but the line kept forming. The place stayed busy but they moved people along nicely. As mentioned we never felt rushed after the initial encounter.\nIf you want authentic chinese food in a typical neighborhood restaurant in Chinatown, we would definitely recommend it! There are lots of restaurants in the area of course, but I would not hesitate to return.", "author": "Rand T."}

We finally decided to give it a go based on high praise from a friend. As it turned out, we got lucky and there was no line and we were seated immediately.\n\nBut frankly, you'd better know what you want before you walk through the door. And bring your own water. There were four of us, they brought three waters (and two menus). It took us several tries of hounding everyone we could see (most of whom ignored us) before we got that fourth water...complete with floating, dead bug. We got the menus too, but only for a couple minutes before they came by and took two back. And when my poor dad had a question while trying to decide between two items on the menu, the waiter decided enough was enough, snatched the menu right out of his hand, and left. We had no idea what my dad was even getting until they brought it.\n\nAs it turned out, he ended up with the Bao Bing Wrap, which was delicious. The meat literally melts in your mouth. The rest of the dish is a waste of time, though; some lettuce and flimsy flour tortillas. We also had the Salt & Pepper Shrimp, Sesame Chicken, and House Noodles. The chicken was good, though the shrimp was definitely the best dish. The noodles were ok; not bad, but not memorable. We also tried the pot stickers, but weren't impressed.\n\nBottom line, if you know when to go and what you want, then the food is worth it.

I cannot believe this is my first time reviewing the restaurant. Heck, I have been rocking one of their tshirts for years. Sadly, I cannot give it a good review at this time.\n\nUnfortunately, the last time I went, I had a similar experience to that of a recent review. I showed up at 11:55am, I believe they open at 12p, and the woman seemed disgusted that I was there. They do not have their hours posted on the door and I attempted to ask what time they open, only to be shunned. The lady had a serious bad attitude. She is tall and has short black hair.\n\nThe food is great and everyone else in the restaurant is friendly. But Mr. Nanking, for the sake of your business, you need to address the attitude of the tall woman working in your establishment. My wife and I spoke about her attitude and negativity and I almost considered leaving as a result of her unfriendly demeanor.", "author": "Justin R."}

We've been coming to House of Nanking since we moved to the Bay Area 25 years ago. I think the food has always been consistently amazing. It's creative and innovative and I've had the feeling many times that I'm eating Chinese food for the first time. It's really not Chinese food as much as its fusion-American-Chinese. It's always packed, almost always has a line out front and it's really sort of rare to see many Asian faces there. Peter Fang is brilliant and I clearly remember him 25 years ago NOT allowing me to order what I wanted from the menu. I'd say, \"I'd like the Mongolian Beef\" and he'd say No, you get Nanking Chicken instead. What? I can't order what I want here? Hilarious! The place used to be about half the size it is today and the tables were lined up right next to each other to insure the maximum number of diners could be served. You got to know the strangers next to you pretty quick and often we would share food! No question, service was rude too...but who cared! We were having SO MUCH FUN and the food was so good! \n\nThere isn't a member of our family nor good friends who have come to visit over the years that we haven't brought to House of Nanking. We give them the tour, Golden Gate Bridge, Lombard Street, Coit Tower...etc, and we always finish the day off with dinner at House of Nanking. Last night was my daughters 15th birthday and we asked her what she wanted to do. She said she wanted to bring her best friends to House of Nanking. As usual, we waited in line to get in, got crammed together at one of their long tables next to some strangers and got lucky...Peter Fang himself waited on us! I haven't seen one of their menus in years.  I just tell Peter to bring us whatever he wants! The pot stickers might come out after the entrees and only half our drink order arrived...but who cares. Everything we got was fantastic and fresh tasting! The vegetables are perfection...not overcooked. I can't really tell you what we had....but it was delicious. \n\nMy only suggestion is, put aside your preconceptions about eating in a restaurant and let this place do its thing.

There were several seafood and vegetarian options on the menu and prices were very reasonable.  We both ordered hot and sour soup which was perfect for a cold windy evening.  I ordered the five spiced pork and the bf opted for the famous sesame chicken with sweet potatoes (there is a reason they have branded it famous). Dishes are a la carte. Unfortunately, I wasn't too excited about it as much of it had some large pieces of fat.  I was extremely jelly of the bf's dish, which he so kindly shared a good portion of it with me... so good.  The house red wine was standard, but great for $3.75 and a generous pour.  The service was fairly quick and no-nonsense.   During the course of our dinner, there always seemed to be a line outside.

You know what I'm talking about, right? Whereas good food prepared in a Chinese way is a sublime and delightful experience, chinesefood more often than not is a greasy, if not somewhat indulgent experience best left for those moments when it's the sole desire of your belly.\n\nHouse of Nanking is the previous, and while it's not the universe's most shining example of crafty and creative Chinese food, it's pretty darn good. chinesefood places are a dime a dozen, and Nanking is more like a several dollar find.\n\nSpeaking of money, it's not going to cost you a ton. Yes, chinesefood is cheaper, but our eggplant served with sweet potato was really remarkable, and the winner for the day was scallops. Sweet, soft, savory, and sublime all there on a plate for the plucking. Scallops can be so wrong (like chewing on a tire from my old Construx\u00ae blocks) but when they're right, they're just stellar. Hopefully they maintain their standards at Nanking because I'd love to come back for more.\n\nSweet Jenny L ordered a flowering tea and this was my first experience with the whole flowering tea phenomenon. For the uninitiated, you drop a tea ball into hot water, and over the course of he meal it slowly opens into a beautiful flower and a subtle tea. Like a science project, only for your beverage.\n\nThe staff was all smiles (though speedy during the lunch rush) and we were in and out and back to the office in a snap with bellies full of food that's Chinese.

For starters, we had marinated bok choy (was a little on the bitter side but was rather refreshing to eat as an appetizer). Then came the calamari, which i thought was probably the best dish of the nite. It wasn't your typical \"crunchy fried calamari\" but rather a bit more chewy, but still good. It was drizzled with a coconut sauce that was actually quite tasty. The next dish was a \"shrimp cake\" which was basically Shrimp wonton with peanut sauce drizzled over it and I felt it was a bit overbearing & killed the flavor of the shrimp.  The final 2 dishes came out about 5 min later. Sesame chicken & fish filet with sauteed spinach. The chicken dish again, way too much sauce. So much so that i had to eat a bunch of rice to tone it down a notch. \n\nIt took longer for us to get seated, then to actually order & eat.

Since the little ones were with us, we asked the kitchen to make chicken and broccoli with no seasonings of any kind (which, after a couple of confused looks, they obliged).  Sesame chicken was very good as many other reviews state, and the sweet potatoes on the side were delightful, but my favorite was the pork ribs (baby backs).  Sticky, sweet, salty, and savory all at the same time. I could have eaten three orders.  Green beans added, well, some necessary green.  They were well-cooked and not over-cooked.  I saw other tables ordering soups, which looked amazing, and the calamari looked pretty good to me, too.  \n\nService:\nIt was obvious that many people read up on the \"order quickly and don't make a fuss\" policy here, because everything  happened super-fast.  Our food arrived very quickly, special order for the kids and all, which I thought would annoy the staff, but if it did, we didn't know it. When I needed another Tsing Tao, all I had to do was make eye contact with anyone (server, busser, whoever) and raise my empty bottle.  A quick nod acknowledged my request and thirty seconds later I had another cold one.  Other reviews mention \"the angry lady,\" but we didn't experience any anger.  Just fast, efficient service.  And they do accept credit cards these days, which is great.\n\nVibe:\nDark, homey, and noisy in all the best ways.  Not a place to linger over your meal, especially since you are likely to be sharing your table with other diners, but that isn't a problem for us as the children rarely offer us the \"lingering luxury\" anyway!\n\nFamily-friendly:\nYup.  Just like all Chinese restaurants I have been to.  I especially liked the communal-table-style seating; when seated with \"strangers,\" my kids are apprehensive enough to be quiet (at least at first), and then after they warm up they get a kick out of talking to the others at the table.  It's like built-in childcare, especially since others find our children much more charming than we jaded parents do by dinnertime...\n\nSummary:\nSolid food delivered quickly and many good dishes to enjoy.  Some may complain that the food is a bit less than authentic, but I don't care.  It's tasty food and I would not hesitate to come back alone or with the family.", "author": "Aneesh B."}

I love scallion pancakes in general, and this one was practically a meal in itself, covered in a heavy, but tasty, tamarind-based sauce.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-11", "description": "For over a decade I've been hearing about a Chinese food restaurant located in Chinatown that has amazing food that I had to try. Although I'm not one to feed into over hyped opinions about restaurants, I finally had the opportunity to try it this place out so I took advantage of it. So last Sunday My wife and I took two friends and tried out their lunch menu. My wife loves the food here and will always be a fan. Unfortunately for me it did not live up to all the hype.\n\nWhen we first arrived parking was just terrible and almost impossible to find. The location of the restaurant is in the area of china town where it is so clustered and busy that it can be a headache to find parking. Let me put it like this, unless you get lucky and find street parking you're going to have to park in a garage. Luckily we found street parking so we then walked to the Resturant  and I realized that it's a small place. Due to the size there's not much wiggle room to sit down and feel comfortable in. There's very little to no space in-between you and other tables. This can make things very tight and at times uncomfortable. Also the restaurant has very dim lighting, which makes it hard to see others if you're there to entertain friends or family.\n\nSo we were shown to our table which had a rustic look and feel to it. It had some classic charm to it but the chairs are small and made out of wood. So after a while sitting down can be very uncomfortable. Another thing I noticed is that due to the size there must be little, to no room in their back storage area. Because they keep a lot of their beer, as well as other things up front. It kinda makes things look chaotic. There's beer, and a bunch of random supplies all over the place. It should be in back-stock but unfortunately with no extra space, they just leave it in the dinning area. I guess you can say their making the best out of a bad situation.  So We ordered the Potstickers as appetizers then moved on to the main courses of chow mein, fried rice and sesame chicken. Followed by the fried onion cake drizzled with an amazing peanut sauce. I mean this peanut sauce is so good that you can put it on a shoe and eat it!! Lol\n\nThe food was delicious and had flavor but in my opinion it was good, not great. The fried rice had tons of vegetables in it and at times a little bit too much. So much that during some bites that's all I tasted. I would've preferred a better balance between the rice, vegetables and meat. The chow main had a little bit of a salty after taste too, but it still held its own and I would recommend it. Once again you get more onions and saltiness in every bite more than anything else. The sesame chicken was good and one of my favorites of all The dishes I had there. Although, I do wish the actual pieces of chicken were little bit bigger, it still was one of the highlights of the meal. Unfortunately with the Sauce glazed over the chicken it was a little bit dry and could've used a little bit more tenderness to it. So the last dish was the onion cake. It was a tasty dish as well but with the large amount of onions in it, if you're not a fan of cooked onions then I suggest you don't order it. I felt the peanut sauce created a great balance and allowed me to enjoy a dish that it comprised of mostly onions.\n\nUltimately the place is decent and I would definitely go back to try other dishes but don't believe all the hype. Try you're best to ignore what everybody says and simply make your own decision on this location. based off of what I was told and for so long. I don't think it could've ever live up to what I envisioned.", "author": "Donald W."}

Seems they're trying way too hard to resemble the service of a Chinese restaurant from \"an episode of Seinfeld\". While the \" get in, eat, get out \" factor of this place may help make this dining experience \"real Chinese\", the food is far from it. Maybe this is to be expected nowadays from the historic Chinatowns of American big cities.\nThis place is a tourist trap and a bit of a disappointment. From the moment you walk in, the one thing you will immediately notice, is the lack of Asian persons eating here. Having, lived, worked, made Asian friends, and dined in the San Gabriel Valley for 16 years, this was a red flag. Chinese restaurants in the SGV don't make their food to serve tourists, they make it to serve Chinese people that don't speak a word of English, that just came from China, and demand only authentic delicious, and reasonably priced (due to the competitive market here) of Chinese restaurants. \nCheck out this article about San Gabriel Valley Chinese food, from 1999 but it applies even more so today ;\n\n http://m.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/going-all-out-for-chinese/305473/\n \n\n    When a place like this automatically tacks on an 18% gratuity charge for a group of 4 adults and one 5 year old, it should be another red flag, and for their slightly better than nonexistent service, a joke at that. I see reviews before me have mentioned or complained about them charging an automatic gratuity, and the management/owner exclaim as to how \" appalled\" or \"surprised\" they are, and that they would like to pinpoint the problem to resolve it. Well guess what? Months and months and months later they're still doing it, so obviously they have to intention of stopping the scamming of people that don't check their bill, so Kathy, please spare me the fake lines of your shock.

We did not drink the water, needless to say.\n We ordered a crispy chicken, fried chicken, like an orange chicken of some sort, and there were yams, instead of Asian sweet potatoes. Yams are for traditional Thanksgiving dinners, not Chinese food.\nFortunately I like yams,  I'm not a Chinese food purist snob, although I prefer it authentic, and so the yams worked for me.\nAgain, don't come here thinking you're going to get Chinese food, rather, you will be getting Chinese inspired food.\nAs a side note, hardly any, if any at all, of just about every single Chinese restaurant I have ever been to in the vast San Gabriel Valley area, has ever had service as crappy and rude as this. Although these places may differ from what traditional Americans consider good in terms of hospitality, they still provide quick, well focused, cordial service, without being in your face, asking if is everything OK every 5 minutes. Maybe the idea that Chinese restaurants give crappy service comes from the comical exaggerated movie and TV depictions, and the mistake of comparing traditional Chinese restaurants to traditional American ones. This place takes it too far.\n\nMinus points for lack of authenticity\nMinus points for crappy service\nMinus points for hygiene\nMinus points for stupid auto 18% gratuity charge\nMinus points for pissing me off by saying something in Chinese when i asked about the 18%, and thinking I wouldn't understand you.\nPlus points for decent, although not real Chinese food.\n\nPS. I've lowered my rating due to management's response to complaints and negative reviews with a generic \" we hope you will give us another chance by coming and spending your money here again.\"\n\nRight right; your staff sure doesn't act like a \"fusion\" type of place. More like a no class type of place.", "author": "Juan P."}

Ive read rave reviews about it and it always seems to be quite busy.\n\nTo start off with I had the detoxifying cold tea which was really lovely. I love the bits of fruit that are in it! And the best thing about it are the free refills. I had 3 of them and they were very refreshing. \n\nI ordered the Fang's Panfried Garlic Fish (crusted in Asian spices, served with seasonal garlic chinese veggies [bok choy i think and some onion] ) along with rice. My first impression was that the serving was quite small for $13.95 especially considering it didn't include rice. The fish was very airy and light, the greens very sweet, not as spicy as I would have liked but it was very good and I left feeling satisfied. \n\nThe service was fine I dont know why people have issues with it. I quite like to be given my drink and order and be left alone.\n\nI do recommend coming to this place in a group of friends or family so you can try as many dishes as possible although they are quite pricey and that is one reason I am only giving HONK 3 stars. They must be making good margin on the products they serve. \n\nThis is not a place to have a leisurely quiet long supper at. Order fast eat and enjoy and leave. The staff are very quick to get you out as soon as possible and there's no question why considering the massive queue for their food. \n\nGlad I didn't order the sesame chicken which seems to be quite common among Chinese Restaurants apart from the Sweet Potatoes.

Especially after a long day of sightseeing it was nice to not even have to think about what to order.  \n\nThere was soup, shrimp, fish, scallops, beef and chicken, the dishes kept coming at the perfect pace and stopped at the perfect point before we were too full.  I loved it.  Everything was delicious and while it may not have blown me out of the water, it exceeded my expectations and we had a blast and for that NanKing you get 5 stars from this Chicagoan.  \n\nThere's always a line I hear, but it moved very quickly and we were seated within 15 minutes of arriving on a Monday night.  \n\nDid I mention that the bottles of wine are $14 and aren't too shabby?

A cute little old man came up and asked if this was our first time then said he'll \"take care of us\" as he was the chef and owner.  I told him that I didn't want the typical Orange/Sesame/General Tso's chicken-sugar-hybrid and wanted something authentically Chinese.\n\nWe started with an appetizer that was a huge mushroom that was cut and put on our plates. We then got this fish dish and beef bok choy. The fish dish was okay; I think it tasted like something my grandma would cook so it didn't seem like anything different what I typically eat. The beef boy choy, on the other hand, is a different story. Very, very tender beef that just melts in your mouth. A bit of curry spices, boy choy, and some stir-fried onions made it a very delicious dish. Definitely would come back just for this.\n\nWe got the bill and the mushroom was $10!

Not too spicy and the eggplant was still tender. \n\nHouse of Nanking is a super small restaurant and great if you don't mind making new friends while eating your meal. It's cafeteria style seating and you are seated wherever a space is open. A line almost always forms outside the restaurant around 7PM, so be prepared with a jacket! Also, have the staff order for you! One time, they just asked us what flavors we liked (spicy, sweet, salty) and what kind of ingredients we preferred, and then served us a great meal of all that was mentioned above. If you are close to the Chinatown area, try this place out!", "author": "Paul C."}

It is by far very tight seating inside you are basically elbow to elbow with your neighbor but everyone was very social. Waitress came over to take our order she didn't seem very pleasant and I was by far shocked when she walked away when we weren't even done ordering. We ordered the onion cakes those were good, the house noodle not so much I informed them that we didn't like it and they refused to remove it off our bill or even offer a different plate after the fact that we waited 40 minutes for our food, our neighbors were seated promptly and yet received they're food before we did..they also rush you to get out.I will honestly say that our visit was an unpleasant one and our plans of going back will be slim to none.", "author": "Lourdes L."}

I am glad I stopped in this place.\n\n  This place is small and dimly lit but had windows on the street that let in a nice breeze.  While looking at the menu a female waitress approached us and asked us what we liked and asked us if we trusted her To choose for us.  I said yes my partner was a little reluctant.  I said I liked shrimp and my partner said chicken and we ordered a bowl of wonton soup.  After a few minutes the lady brought a big bowl of family Style soup and some shrimp that had been fried with apples.  Both items were exceptional.  A few minutes later she brought out the order of Sesame chicken that was served with fried sweet potatoes that had been thinly sliced.  \n\nThe food was absolutely amazing...a little pricey but worth every penny.

This restaurant has been open forever and is always crazy packed.  I came to do the typical touristy crap and found this place from Frommers. This is the first time coming to any type of restaurant where they can make a \"custom menu\" for you. What is a custom menu you may ask? The day that I went, I think the owner came by our table, if you tell them that you want them to order, they start asking some questions to get a flavor profile so they could completely make a menu on your likes and dislikes and your country of origin. They asked what country we were from, we said Thai, they then asked if we wanted fish, chicken, beef, vegetables etc. We named a few proteins and the owner places the order and said \"ok, I will take care of you.\" It's kind of like a custom Omakase, if you will. Well, there was about four dishes for the four of us and honestly, I thought the food was excellent. Yes, it's touristy, yes it's crowded, yes Rachel Ray approves of it but at the end of the day, you give me good food and I will be happy. The food, since we mentioned we were Thai, had some heat to all the dishes. I wouldn't say the food was 100% authentic per se, but the flavors on everything really worked. On the dishes, they gave us a fish dish, a vegetable dish, a chicken dish and I forgot the last one but truly amazing food.

He was walking through the dining room and the server kept YELLING and darting towards her other employees to stop him.   Finally she rushed back and slammed his \"separate check\" down at his spot on the table.  \n\nI couldn't believe it!!!    The poor kid goes to use the toilet and this crazy, incompetent server accosts him and treats him like a criminal.   \n\nI had asked her for about 5 things that she forgot, including napkins and water, I flagged her down to explain how rude she was and she walked around a bunch, ignoring me, and when she came back she had our check in her hand!\n\nI told her, can I please have the things you told me you were going to bring me 20 mins ago and also that her treatment towards our guest was extremely rude as he was just going to the bathroom.   She screamed back in her pea-sized brain voice, \"I didn't know!!!!!!!!\"\n\n\nI am a server and I usually always tip well.   This time I had no qualms stiffing the incredibly rude server.  If there was a way to talk to anyone at this place who gave a crap I might have complained to them.  \n\nThis place just abuses the fact that they are popular and forces their guests to deal with an awful atmosphere because they know no one will stop going.\n\nBut I, for one, am waking up the street to the 100's of other good Chinese restaurants next time and saving my time, money, and stress.   \n\nIf any women servers of Nanking can or do read this, you should look for a new career!

The first time I was here it was after just moving to the city and this was my first stop in Chinatown.  After exploring Chinatown more this last year, visiting china last month, and my most recent stop here this weekend I realized how great this place is.  We showed up at about 5 on a Saturday for a super late lunch.  No wait at all and sat down.  What first surprised me was how low the prices were after visiting several other Chinatown restaurants I forgot how inexpensive this one was!  And for huge portions!!  I get that people are thrown off by the restaurant but this is Chinatown not some Michelin star restaurant!  To me it just adds to the experience.  Especially after visiting Beijing where so many of the restaurant are like this- its just part of the fun!  We ordered some house wine and the pour were amazing- 3.95$ for a full glass of wine is a deal in San Francisco and the wine wasn't that bad at all!  I thought the chardonnay paired really well with some of their heavier dishes.  But anyway back to the food- won ton soup was like nothing I  have ever had and it was amazing! A little creamy and the won tons were outstanding.  We got the sesame chicken again which did not disappoint.  The house noodles were a big hit as well.  We ordered the bao bao beef which was very tender and flavorful.  WE ordered a couple other items but those were my favorite.  I will keep coming back here whenever I am in Chinatown- what a great place for an incredible price!", "author": "Kate F."}

(cue for delirious Peter Lorre-like laugh)\n\nHey, did you know if you go to the business location listing on the SF Dept. of Public Health site, you will find a yes-or-no column that asks, \"Symbol of Excellence?\" I'm sure only a meager few would be surprised to find the response under House of Nanking to be \"No\". I had been curious to come here since it became like a totally rad place to go in the nineties. On MTV, those self-absorbed housemates from \"Real World - San Francisco\" came here to have a couple of their passive-aggressive confrontations to figure out what to do with Puck.\n\nThen of course, chipmunk-cheeked Rachael Ray found it, or at least one of her minions did, on one of those $40-a-Day-But-I-Don't-Tip episodes. And Jamie Oliver came here to once again prove that the British have steel-belted palates. Their smiling faces adorn the walls of this hovel of a place. I just want to know who the press relations manager is for this place. I'd hire him or her in a flash.\n\nI came here for lunch today totally expecting a wait but got lucky - if you should pardon the expression - and landed the little table facing the window. The girl in the House of Nanking T-shirt simply waved in my direction to sit. It took quite a while to get anyone's attention - for a menu perhaps, a glass of water - because a loud Aussie family wanted a detailed explanation of every item on the menu and then they needed to repeat them to each other. Actually, \"loud Aussie\" is a redundant descriptor.\n\nFinally, I got a well-worn menu, but here comes local legend Peter Fang looking somewhat constipated and fully expecting me to be prepared to order the minute his pen hits his pad. To his chagrin, I was indeed prepared and didn't let him suggest anything to me. I ordered the $9.95 plate of chopped snow pea shoots with eggplant chunks. It came with a truckload of yams cut into matchsticks, and it was all slathered in some kind of lubricating sauce I couldn't quite make out.\n\nThe eggplant was better than I expected, but the snow pea shoots tasted like they were barely acquainted with the wok. I do like the smell of a freshly mowed lawn but not on my plate (...did ya hear that, Cafe Gratitude?). I also think yams as a stir-fry accompaniment are odd. They might as well given me a burnt marshmallow topping and sang \"Jingle Bells\" to me at the same time.\n\nTen dollars seems a bit steep for an all-veggie dish no matter the size (judge for yourself in my photo). Service was pretty much at their convenience. The dirty dishes left by the preceding customers lingered for about five minutes before anyone thought to pick them up and wipe down the table. You can probably guess I had a pretty lackluster experience at the mythic House of Nanking. No wonder everyone was so bitchy in that Lombard house on \"The Real World\".\n\nFOOD - 2.5 stars...somebody get me my hedge clippers, the plate needs to be cut back\nAMBIANCE - 2 stars...Rachael and Jamie can smile all they want..it still feels like Sam Wo's North\nSERVICE - 2 stars...indifferent to surly...they run the gamut from A to B\nTOTAL - 2 stars...House of Nanking?...how about House of Yanking...My Chain?", "author": "Ed U."}

This is a typical SF Chinatown restaurant. Do not expect attentive service. Expect no-nonsense service. They want you in, they want you out, food will arrive quickly. If you want a white tablecloth restaurant with a solicitous maitre'd, what the hell are you doing here?\n\n2. This is not an \"American-Chinese\" restaurant. It's an authentically Chinese one. You will likely not be familiar with most items on the menu. That's a -good- thing; it means you're eating something you would not likely find in McKinney fucking Texas, or Salt Lake, or wherever the hell you're from. Go with the flow and experiment.\n\n3. I read some other reviews and found people whining about parking. Parking? Seriously? This is San Francisco, why the hell are you tooling around in your ecologically catastrophic death machine? You never heard of public transit maybe? And ok, North Beach is up a hill, but Kearney is an adequate cycling street, and it's in the SF bike share area. If you want parking, stay in McKinney and eat at the goddamn Panda Express, god help you.\n\n4. I had the fried onion cake as an appetizer, which I found interesting, but don't recommend. Interesting because it's not a stereotyped scallion pancake; a different texture and substantial chunks of onion. I don't recommend it, because it was covered with a thin peanut flavored gruel. I would either have preferred a soy-and-vinegar dipping sauce, or something more like sate; edible, but unsatisfying.\n\n5. I also had the scallop tower, which was fantastic: a citrus-flavored brown sauce, a watercress-like vegetable I am not sufficiently knowledgeable to identify, underlaid by a root vegetable. Totally delicious, and worth going there for.\n\n6. But I'm sure some Americans would consider the portion size small; scallops are an expensive ingredient, of course, and I also doubt any European would balk at that.\n\nSo you know: Fast in, fast out, don't expect elegance; authentically Chinese, some dishes better than others, if you need to park don't come to SF, I walked away happy.\n\nWhat more do you need to know?", "author": "Greg C."}

It was the WORST decision. \n\nAfter we walked in, a waitress asked us how big the party was. I said \"six\" in both English and Chinese. She pretended that she did not understand me, and responded \"One person? You can sit in the corner then.\" She was really rude and arrogant, and just turned around and left without seating us anywhere. Then someone else came and pointed us to a table.\n\nOur waiter who took our order seemed to be just as rude and racist. When we asked them anything in Chinese, they would reply in English even though they were speaking Chinese to each other. We ordered a soup to share but they would not bring any additional bowls, although the table next to us received bowls with their soup order. We had to ask for rice with entree orders, and our waiter did not for once refill our drinks. They penned a gratuity onto our check. Some restaurants mention this may be added on the menu, but we saw no such warning. The waitress just stood by our table and watched us when we signed the receipt to make sure we paid the tip, which was very intimidating.\n\nOverall the experience was just awful. The whole time we felt like we were treated with disgust and disdain. I would NEVER go back there and would advise anyone who wants a pleasant dining experience to avoid it at all costs.", "author": "Justin H."}

However, if you are open to waiting and exploring some food that you probably would not normally order then eat here. We waited in the long cash only line for about 45 mins. When we were ready to be seated (there was 7 of us), the waiter asked if we had any allergies...  No but does a vegetarian count? Whoosh server disappears. Ten minutes later food starts coming out. Wft?  Did we order this?but who cares. First a Bok choy dish, next some rice and tofu dish (who eats tofu, but the vegetarian) he only got a taste, the rest of us scoffed this dish down.  next a fish dish and chicken dish Wow   What a whirlwind. The food the tasty and fresh. I am not sure what each dish was but it sure was delicious and cheap.  The bill was split 7 ways. 17 buckaroos a piece seriously.", "author": "Sarah C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-10-11", "description": "Zagat-rated and we're the only Asian diners in the entire (albeit small) Chinese restaurant. Two warning signs from the beginning.  I grew up eating American-Chinese and Chinese food so I have definite preferences for my Chinese food. It's similar to how my classmates hated cafeteria food but I thought it was great because I had no reference for how meatloaf, spaghetti or pizza should taste. Well, I've realized that I never agree with Zagat reviewers on Chinese food.\n\nThe food is greasy, edible, but nothing special.  Our first dish was the garlic fried fish dish. Rather than garlicky as described, it was very sweet. I can't recall eating such a sweet fish dish before and was not fond of it. The house noodle dish was boring yet too salty (keep in mind, I'm on a restricted sodium diet). Just sauce and noodles with a bit of greenery. Eggplant dish was ok and glistening with grease. They were very prompt in bringing out the first two dishes.\n\nThe main thing I remember is how they rushed, rushed, rushed us. We came on a Wednesday after 9pm so I understand.  While growing up and working in a Chinese restaurant, I hated the latecomers too. However, you can't be so blatant about it and you can't rush us when you're the reason for the delay.\n\nFirst, after asking if it was our first time, the waitress said, \"Ok. Chicken, fish, calamari, pork!\" and tried to clear away our menus. I'm indecisive so I was somewhat ok with this but my friend was completely flustered. We said it was too many entrees for 4 people, so the waitress said, \"Ok. Chicken, fish, pork. No? Chicken, calamari, pork!\" We asked her to come back for our order.\n\nSecond, we ordered three entrees and rice. They gave us entree 1, entree 2 and the bill. I thought it was strange to receive the bill before all the food. Apparently, they forgot entree 3. If you're trying to rush us, bring out all the dishes so we eat in a reasonable amount of time, i.e. before closing. Since there was a delay in the food, we stayed past their closing time.\n\nThird, they mopped the floors, moved the tables, and turned on the bright lights as we were finishing with dinner (I did not note if it happened before or after their closing time of 10). I found the whole situation hilarious and joked to my friends, \"Excuse me. I'm going to use the restroom before they lock that up too.\" Another point of hilarity: a piece of the handle flew off the bathroom sink when I turned on the water. I screwed it back into its divot, so easily fixed but watch out for it.\n\nIN SHORT, this food is edible but I wouldn't make a special trip to eat here if I were a tourist. When I moved here from the Midwest (via San Diego), I was ecstatic about the availability of so many things I couldn't readily get before such as dim sum, steamed buns, whole steamed fish, roasted duck. House of Nanking, on the other hand, is Americanized Chinese food. It is no better nor worse than any Chinese restaurant you can find across America. Unless you are homesick and are seeking comfort in the familiarity of home, eat somewhere else. Try something you can't find at home.", "author": "Yan E."}

I was always skeptical since I know it usually attracts tourists. I came with a friend around 5:30ish on a Friday and was seated right away. It was quickly getting busy. My friend spoke to them in Cantonese so the waiter assumed we could read and gave us a secret Chinese menu! They have a secret menu and the dishes are different than the American menu. We ordered the stir fired tofu with pork and shrimp and the dry fried-spare ribs, which was what the waiter recommended. The dishes were definitely very flavorful but a little salty for my taste. The dry-fried spare ribs were too vinegary for my taste but my friend liked it. It is supposed to taste sweet and sour. They definitely provided better customer service for us since we were Chinese.

Once we went inside for a late lunch, the place wasn't really very crowded but there were plenty of customers. We were seated and wondering what to order, then came the chef. He asked us whether we eat spicy food and eat all kinds of food. Then he said he will make something for us that we would like. He took the menu and went to instruct the cook the meal.    \n\nFirst, we received onion pancake as an appetizer, that was not even on the menu (I think). It had stuffed green onions in a pancake fried, and topped with a sauce that was spicy but too much. I had lots of Chinese food, but never this one. This was wonderful. Then he have us a chicken curry with broccoli and green beans with a bit of cabbage in it. This was just as flavorful and very tasty, the sauce was more like a Thai curry sauce.  Finally, we received a shrimp plate with apple, both the shrimp and the apple was similar to that you will find in 'Bang bang Shrimp' by Bone Fish only milder, and more tasty.

Worst experience of her entire visit.  I can live with no atmosphere but the food and service were horrendously bad.  We came for lunch on a Friday.  My husband ordered the short ribs which were so fatty and gristle riddled they were inedible.  He pushed the plate away after two bites - not that anyone there checked back, noticed, or even cared.  My sister-in-law's meal was just okay.  My meal never came.  Apparently, serving a table all their meals at the same time isn't a high priority.  When I asked the waiter where my lunch was, he was very snotty and said they cook the meals one at a time and it would get there when it was ready.  Alrighty then.  By this time we were all eating off of our guest's plate.  Can't remember what it was but it was unremarkable.  I eventually canceled my order since everyone was finished eating and by this time I was afraid the kitchen or the waiter would spit in it.  Terrible experience and very disappointing for our guest who wanted so badly to eat good Chinese food in Chinatown.

Getting a group of 6 in a crowded restaurant quickly in this city can be tricky at best but within 5 minutes we were seated with menus and drinks were ordered. \n\nDespite accidentally bringing us 6 beers rather then 4 waters and 2 beers, they were quick to fix the error and take our orders. Given only one of us had had experience with the restaurant before the waitress, after we had asked what she recommended, basically suggested an order for us. One of our members was gluten free AND Vegan and they didn't even blink an eye.  SO nice!  \n\nThe food came out quickly (though my only complaint is that it would have been nice to balance the vegan with the non-vegan dishes so our vegan friend didn't have to wait and watch us eat). And the food was amazing!  So fresh that we joked that they must have live animals in the back they killing and preparing as we order. The flavors were unlike anything I've tasted in Chinese food in the past. One dish combined fresh raw tomatoes, cooked shrimp, crispy rice, and basil which seems like a weird combination but \"OH MY!\"  My mouth still waters for it. So yummy. There was a crispy beef with bok choy.  It melts in your mouth.  Fried calamari that wasn't tough and chewy but rather soft and almost melted in our mouths.  Everything was amazing and absolutely delicious.  Extra added bonus for supporting both Vegan and Gluten free needs.  Loved it and would totally return!", "author": "Renata P."}

Sure, it may not be the most authentic Chinese food, but this Chinese American also doesn't feel it veers very far off either? There are several vegetarian/vegan options, and the eggplant/sweet potato dish is definitely delicious and perfectly sized.

Was very disappointed with lunch experience about two weeks back.  \n\nService from the beginning was less than satisfying starting with menu's that appeared to be designed for tourist (about a dozen items on laminated page).  After we ordered, noticed others asked for the standard menu which appeared to have greater selection of food options.  Waiter never offered  other menu option.  \n\nWhen food arrived, appeared to be warm but as if it was made sometime before and put into a food warmer (buffet style).  Came to the table within five minutes of our ordering.  We had the house Chicken and the mushroom dish.  Both were average in taste and not memorable.  Regarding the rice, Wow! Came on a flat dinner  plate and was not warm (also slightly over cooked).  \n\nFinally, when we arrived (around 2pm) place was about 1/2 full (would expect service to be pretty good).  Waited about 5 minutes for someone to come to our table.  About half way through our meal place filled up quickly.  This is when the person that seated us (may be owner) started hovering near our table and within a few minutes put the cheek on our table.  We were still finishing lunch!  Tried not to pay attention to her or the older man that also was hovering near the door (looking our way).  Finally finished lunch and plates were gone.  Guess they were trying to move us along (we were only in the restaurant for about 35 minutes).  Know there was a wait but I guess they forgot we were also paying customers.  \n\nUnpleasant experience and food was just ok.  Will never return.", "author": "Steve F."}

A lot of fellow yelpers also mentioned the long wait to get in, but luckily there was no line when we arrived, and were sat immediately.\n\nIt is family style, so we all picked a few dishes and had a little bit of everything. We ordered the famous sesame chicken, which many people have said is the best item on the menu here. We also ordered calamari, chow mein, shrimp fried rice, and something with beef in it. Like another review had mentioned you literally tell them what kind of meat you want and they bring something amazing out! \n\nThe sesame chicken was so amazing! We all loved it and thought it was delicious, so good and tasty, couldn't get enough of it, lol. The Calamari was also awesome, but a little spicy for me, but I ate it anyways, because it was so yummy. I love fried rice, so I was pretty sure there was no way this one would let me down, and I was right! Totally yummy with lots of shrimp in it, yummmmm. \n\nThe chow mein was a huge disappointment! The noodles were super thick, slimy and yucky. The noodles were also way too spicy and just lacked any real awesome flavor to them. If they had been less spicy I might of enjoyed them a bit more. The mystery beef dish was also really good, and I did not have high expectations for it at all. I usually find a lot of Chinese beef dishes mediocre, but not this one. The beef was very juicy and tasty and came with veggies. \n\nService isn't great of course, like most Asian restaurants, but the food is awesome. We also didn't wait that long for food to come out, but they sort of bring one dish at a time, which can be annoying sometimes. I would definitely agree that this place is great, and will for sure be back next time I'm in town.", "author": "Jeanette S."}

Seriously, for those who have never been to China or just need to understand, that the Chinese mean business... Hell, they make everything and we buy it here. So when you come to an authentic Chinese restuarant, don't expect the waiter/waitress to say \" hello, my name is Lee and I'm going to be your server today\" Here... Your lucky if you get them to let you order. Which happened to us. First of all, there is a wait.. not too long, but you stand outside and patiently hope there is a table enough to sit 6 of you on a Saturday night. After 15 minutes, we sit... woman comes by and quickly says \" What do you want to drink?\", better be ready. Now, as for ordering, Peter.. THE OWNER, BIG BOSS, and CHEF, whose picture was staring at us above, comes by with his little pad of paper, nothing comes out of his mouth, so, I do the thinkable, ORDER and I try to order fast, he looks at me and starts to take our menus from the table, YIKE, did I offend him? and he says \" I'll order for you\", WTF? OKAY, are we going to argue with the BOSS. LOL!!! AND HE DID, every 5 minutes, another dish came out, with every different taste, not like in China where all the dishes start to taste the same. We started with the sizzling rice soup, the infamous sesame chicken, the beef was by far delicious, it actually had an Indian spice flavor and the Walnut Shrimp with apples, yes, apples, which clearly made it sweet and flavorable. Some noodle dish, which apparently looks like another signature dish, since I saw every other table ordering and eating it too. It was a fun experience too, just watching and hearing them screaming back and forth, don't expect a quiet, romantic dinner when your here. Part of the enjoyment of going out is not only having a delicious meal, but having an experience that you'll be able to write it on Yelp and hopefully have the enjoyment of reading! :P", "author": "Alice K."}

The restaurant itself is nice and clean and the staff moves quickly, but are still the typical Chinese waiters. \n\nMost of the dishes are offshoots of traditional Chinese dishes. The calamari was decent, but lacked a flavorful sauce, the fish was cooked well, but also lacked seasoning. The egg plant was good. I recommend that if anything. \n\nThe chow mein was average quality, but for the price was not worth it. The restaurant is right in Chinatown, but was filled with only tourists.

My wife and I ordered two wonton soups. My wife!s came along with my main dish. I requested they take it back and they did. The wanton soup then arrived and looked more like oatmeal and had some ingredient that  I could only compare it to sand. I asked for mustard and was advised they had none. While I was  struggling with the soup, my egg roll arrived and I sent it back and asked for my bill. I had eaten two spoonfuls and that was enough, for besides not being to my liking, I was afraid I was going to crack a tooth. When I order initially fried rice, I could not ascertain whether it was with pork or chicken and could not  get an answer. I should have left then, for the manager and waitstaff were rude , bordering on arrogant. When we were seated,we were placed with six strangers and fortunately they were delightful.

It was drizzled in olive oil with chilli and garlic and only lightly grilled which meant it had plenty of crunch (good when served cold). We also had the prawn dumplings which were nice but there was something in the sauce that I personally wasn't big on - it had a certain tartness that lingered on my plate and unfortunately I revisited a few times when I served up another dish on there.\n\nEntrees:\nNow for the best part, their classic sesame chicken did not disappoint - I would highly recommend this. We got the the pork stuffed mushrooms too, which were a bit boring in my opinion however my girlfriend really liked them. I think all the garlic from the Bok Choy must've ruined my pallet as I found the mushrooms a bit tasteless. \n\nService: \nWas great right up until I asked if I could get change back for the cheque as I didn't want to give an excessive tip (over 30%). This seemed to be a huge inconvenience to the waitress and she proceeded to throw the change (literally) on the table in front of me. It made me laugh but also want to tip less than I'd planned, however in light of the great food and the previous waitress who'd been fantastic all night, I didn't. \n\nAll up:\nGreat, reasonably priced food and drink.

But that's the thing: \"real Chinese people\" don't go to House of Nanking.  The most Chinese thing about this place is the shitty service.  After you're greeted and seated, they've exhausted their smile quota, and can no longer tolerate being patient or friendly whatsoever.  If you hesitate even for a second to order or ask a question, they will have sprinted away, visibly and sometimes audibly frustrated you've wasted their time by being indecisive.  Normally, I wouldn't be so bothered by this, but I don't like paying \"white people prices\" for \"Chinese service.\"\n\nSizzling rice soup - unlike any sizzling rice soup I've ever seen, but it had a lot of vegetables in it, so that was good.  And the lemon (ONE slice - stingy much?) made all the difference.  I hear they sometimes put sweet potato in it.  Not this time I guess.\n\nVege ABC - no longer on the menu, but they still make it if you order it.  It has eggplant, tofu, and mushrooms.  They didn't skimp on the eggplant at all - the pieces were huge.  The tofu tasted fresh and had a nice medium texture - not silken, but not firm-and-fried-dry either.  The stuffed mushrooms were SO good.\n\nThe braised green beans were braised green beans.  Nothing special, just more expensive than what you can find anywhere else.\n\nThe blossoming flower tea was fun to watch and came in a generously filled mug, but it wasn't very strong, and I think they sweetened it (just a note in case you want/expect it unsweetened).\n\nI probably wouldn't come back on my own volition, but my vegetarian friend thinks it's glorious, so I'm glad I got to try a place that so pleases his palette.", "author": "Jenn C."}

She asked her hotel for recommendations as she was craving good Chinese food.  So we trudged off to find this place.  Had to wait a few outside on the sidewalk for a table, nearly retching from the stench emanating from the street (it was foul).  However, once we got inside we had fun.  First, don't expect anything fancy.  It's an absolute hole-in-the-wall. You will sit elbow to elbow with strangers at long cafeteria style tables.  Hey, it's a chance to chat up your neighbors. \n\nThey are busy at Nanking most of the time so they don't mess around.  They'll slap the drinks down and split before you can open your mouth even to thank them or ask for anything else, literally.  They don't do it out of meanness or inattention.  They are usually just really swamped.  If you are a person who needs to be fawned over and chatted up by your server, don't come here.  Take their tea and shut up.  Figure out what you want to order and know they are happy to take special requests as well.  Order several plates, share, enjoy.  Their portions are generous.  That's the fun of Nanking.  You want fancy, go to Perbacco and overpay.  The server there will fawn all over you while they take your money. \n\nI have taken several people to Nanking since and we have always enjoyed it and they have asked to go back on additional visits.  Yeah, we've had to wait sometimes for what seemed like forever to get the server's attention.  Not a big deal.  If you have a show to catch, say something ahead of time.  I've always enjoyed their food.  I almost always order the same thing (chicken, black bean sauce, vegetables, spicy please).  My guests are more adventurous but have always said they enjoyed their food.  Don't want greasy, fried...say so and you'll get something more tailored to your tastes.  I had not written a review yet--I don't know why, but I'm reading so many complainers here today, I just felt I had to put in my two cents.  I don't understand why people feel EVERY restaurant should be white table clothes and 5-star service.  Sometimes it's just about he experience.  Chill out and live a little. I'll get off my soap box now. \n\nAnyway, I write this knowing I am going again for lunch with my Aunt (she likes Nanking and is asking to go back--and she's in her 80s!) and so I will come back and add to this review very specifically about our dishes that we order today.

As an Asian wife to a Caucasian husband, I did not expect a drop of racism when ordering.

Without giving us an opportunity to say \"no thank you\", the waitress swiftly left as quickly as she rushed our order. I understand that the chicken is their most popular order and that the waitress simply wanted to recommend their signature dish, however should my husband be allergic to sesame or any other ingredients in the dish, the consequence would be more severe than a simple loss of autonomy.

You will have to share a table with another couple unless you have a large party.  This is great because it allows you to meet other people and mingle.\n\n4. Please do not insult the chef by asking for soy sauce or anything else that would offend.   If you do something stupid like,  ask for soy sauce with your rice,  it will be slammed down on the table in front of you.  \n\n5. If you order flower tea and they don't have any... They will bring something else substituted.   I hope you like it.   Just like when waiter shows up for the first time and you're not ready to order. He will order for you.  \n\n6. If multiple people in your party order the same thing, they might bring you something else to mix up dinner.\n\n7. Sometimes there's a line.  It's totally worth waiting. Even if it's pouring in the rain, it's worth it.\n\n8. This restaurant can appear to have some of the rudest people serving you but have you seen service in Europe?   Exactly.\n\n9. If you need to find a place to park, good luck, I hope you took public transportation.\n\nSummary:\nIf you're in San Francisco and you want Chinese food head to Chinatown.  I'm glad I did.", "author": "Bob R."}

I went here for a quick business lunch and all the dishes we tried, about 5 in all, were pretty solid.  They did have this amazing tea with a flower inside that \"opened\" up as it soaked up the hot water in a big glass that almost resembled a beer mug.  \n\nOne thing that I did not take a liking to is how pushy and rushy they were during lunchtime.  We had a group of about 7 people and about 5 happened to be Chinese.  The waitress kind of just assumed all the Chinese people understood Chinese and settled to \"negotiate\" the lineup of entrees with the guy that looked like he'd most like be from Hong Kong or something.  Therefore, she just disregarded whatever we thought we wanted and said \"I'll just bring you some dishes.\"  Thank goodness it was on company budget because I've never seen this happen before and I'd be steaming mad if she happened to bring me dishes out of my price range.", "author": "Albie F."}

Turned out to be just a bit too pricey for us, and did not seem all that special. \n\nFirst of all, the wait in line was crazy. The line wrapped around the building just to get in to the TINY restaurant. Waited for about 20-30 minutes. The place was packed. If you have more than four people, be prepared for a LONG wait. We watched one group of about 6 people wait for far longer than we had to wait...totally not a good place to bring a big group. Plus, you may have to share a table if you have three people. Not a chair goes to waste. You will get very friendly with your neighbors because the tables were so crammed together. \n\nTotal was over $67 for three people. Yikes! However, I must say that the food was unique. I got the detoxifying fruit tea...it was quite amazing, and stood out from the rest of the food. It had crushed fruit at the bottom, which gave it a sweet flavor. Definitely worth the $2 or $3. \n\nThe orange chicken was pretty good. Crispy and unique. Unfortunately, I don't quite remember everything we ordered, but it was all good. I noticed that the food seemed less greasy and more fresh than other Chinese restaurants I have been to. They altered the typical recipes to have more vegetables (and new vegetables that I had never seen with Chinese food before). Definitely was fresh and good. \n\nOverall, if you want a different twist on Chinese food, come here.

But why complain about authenticity when the food is just good?  \n\nIt's also true that the waiter will create the order for you.  We sat down as a party of 6 and then we all stared at the menu.  Our waitress came by for our orders and asked, \"First time here?  Ok, I make order for you.  Are you hungry?  Any vegetarians?\"  Of our party, I don't eat meat, one doesn't eat seafood, and another doesn't eat pork.  The waitress took care of us and definitely didn't leave anyone hungry.  Usually as the vegetarian, I get gypped and only get one or two vegetarian friendly dishes.  The waitress brought us an appetizer for all of us to share, 3 vegetarian dishes and 3 meat dishes.\n\nWe got:\n- Onion Cake: not quite like a scallion pancake like at authentic Chinese restaurants.  It was good, but the sweet soy sauce drizzled on top was a bit too salty\n- Calamari: reported as some of my friends' favorite of the night\n- Mushrooms: tasted kinda plain to me, but some of my friends really liked it\n- Stir-fry Beef\n- Shrimp and green beans\n- Sesame Chicken with Sweet Potato: you know it's inauthentic already when they throw in a sweet potato.  but hey, it works so don't complain!\n- Tofu in black bean sauce: the tofu was so good because it's crispy on the outside, soft and silky on the inside with a touch of sweetness from the sauce\n- Pea shoots: refreshing because it was our only true vegetable dish that wasn't fried in a bunch of oil.\n\nService is horrible if you're not familiar with the popular chinese restaurant ways.  For a popular chinese restaurant, service is quick and to the point.  If you want something, you need to be aggressive.  Forget raising your hand... when any waiter walks by, you shove the empty rice pot in their face or ask for the bill or ask for change -- and they won't be offended.  \n\nI'm glad the waitress created our order for us.  Otherwise, we probably wouldn't have known what to order and some of it probably wouldn't have been the best food.

It was just a block away from the hotel I was staying at, and it was a nice change of pace from driving around to eat. My girlfriend and I popped in around lunch hour, and we ended up sharing a table of six with other customers.\n\nAlthough I was expecting pretty good Chinese food (based on my prior expectations and the other experiences I had at other Chinese restaurants), I wasn't blown away by the food. By far the best item we ordered on the menu was the bao bing wrap, which was amazingly delicious. The beef (I think? I can't recall of the top of my head) was very savory and tender, and the duck sauce and scallions were perfectly balanced. The waiter actually helps prepare a couple wraps for you to show you how it's done. The rest of the dishes weren't that memorable, though. The sesame chicken was perhaps slightly above average, but nothing memorable. The dumplings were a bit of a disappointment...deep frying the dumplings made for a flavorless outer skin, and the peanut sauce that was included clashed with the pork and herbs in the dumplings.\n\nService was typical for a Chinese restaurant - that is to say that it wasn't particularly attentive service, but they were more responsive and filled up my water more than others I've been to. The price was pretty reasonable, and I can see why it was pretty packed during a weekday at lunchtime. It's a nice place to stop in and have standard Chinese fare - better than your basic generic cuisine, but not a place that'd be on the top of my list to visit right off.", "author": "Asuka N."}

The food is REALLY good but every time I go I am shocked by the service which is some of the worst I have ever experienced. \n\nUsually there are \"floaties\" in my water, when I ask for new water they bring me water that still has strange things floating in it. I have had to return silverware several times b/c it usually has hard and dried food on it. This last time my plate had crusted dried food on it. Also, this last time I went, it took 6 minutes to get water and when the server brought it to me he was holding my glass by the rim with one thumb actually in my water! When he handed me the water, the rim of the glass had grease lining it where I was supposed to put my mouth.\n\nAnother huge annoyance is sometimes they decide they don't want to bother taking our credit card and demand we pay in cash. The best way around this is tell them you don't have enough cash to leave a tip with and then their story changes and their credit card machine magically fixes it's self.\n\nI don't know if I would recommend this place to anyone.

Was so excited to be there and experience the city and the people. Read some awesome reviews on this place so thought we would give it a try. Not being from here we were having a hard time finding parking but hurried and found somewhere and hurried to the restaurant. When we got there we were waiting for a couple people who had just gotten up from their table to exit the building because it was so small in there. We went to go through the door to sit down and the old man came flying over and pushed us back out the door. Without saying a word like \"I'm sorry we are closed\" or anything he shook his finger at us and slammed the door on us. Leaving us standing looking in at the many people still seated inside. \n\nThen after looking at their website finding that they don't close until 930 and we had arrived at 5 to 9, I was even more disappointed. \n\nAs I am a restaurant manager where I am from I was very unimpressed with the way that we were treated. Especially with knowing you are in a tourist city where a lot of people come to try the food and experience what you have, instead leaving with distaste for the place. \n\nI hope this review will help people not make the poor choice in going to this restaurant.

They get away with the rude service and subpar food because day after day, tourists and hipsters line up around the block and it's galling because the food at Jia's next door is so much better.

And since I ate it I have to pay. My dish was $9. The menu says beef can be added for 2$. Why on earth would I want something that is almost twice as much as my meal as a \"side\"? Clearly there was a misunderstanding. Instead of trying to clear this up she raised her voice and then walked off while grumbling about it some more. Her scene even got the attention of multiple tables near by. \n\n2.  Two water glasses had dried food on it. And when another person at our table received more water there was a red floating \"thing\" in it. \n\n3. There was 10-15 minutes between each guest at the table getting their meal. \n\nI'm sad because I want to like this place. The food is good. I could possibly overlook the second & third issues.

Once you enter, you'd see that the floor and walls are dirty. Once you sit down, you'd notice there's no chopsticks, and the menus look grimy with sticky bits of who-knows-what all over them. Once you look around for the inexistent chopsticks, you'd then notice that this \"authentic\" Chinese restaurant lacks Asian customers. If this doesn't compel you to get out and find a better place to eat, then wait till the food appears. For example, the pork potstickers have the outside texture of old cardboard. Add the slightly bitter peanut sauce which is covering them, and you get the sort of meal that a mediocre cook would create in his/her bouts of infantile culinary experimentation. \nThe low mein looks like something one could buy from Costco and heat in a microwave. \nThe wonton soup has old fish chunks inside, and it has too much salt added. (Maybe to mask the old fish flavor)\n\nOnce you're done gagging on your meal, the check appears. To top off the whole unauthentic \"authentic\" charade, they also like to sneakily add in extra items to your bill.

It was the Sesame Chicken with sweet potatoes that did it for me! \n\nDuring my most recent visit, the place had been remodeled since my prior visit 4 years ago. It is no longer dipped in red and white tile but has a much more calming natural wood look. The only decorations on the walls are still the restaurant's many awards and celebrity autographs. The owner still sits in the corner, discerning ever customer that walks through his door. Fortunately, some things never change.\n\nPlease, if it is your first time, don't insult the chef and order for yourself. Allow a culinary master to bring out the most inspiring dishes of the day. You will NOT be disappointed! Earlier today our meal consisted of pork won ton and crispy rice soup, potstickers in a sweet glaze, honey tempura green bean and shrimp, Sesame Chicken, a delicate beef, tomato, and mushroom salad, and a large bowl of steamed rice. Every time I have eaten here \"family style\" as they call it, the Famous Sesame Chicken has been served, so no need to worry there.\n\nIf you are visiting the city or have yet to explore this exceptionally fantastic restaurant, take the trek downtown and eat. here. now.

I then said, do you see our table, every empty dirty dish is still here non of our drinks have been refilled you never checked on us once and I had to get up 3 times to get help. You are lucky to get anything. Then she gave me a dirty look and stormed off with my receipt. This place was not worth the $70 we spent for dinner and there are plenty of other places to eat in Chinatown that are much better in SF. \n\nI have had better food and service in Ningbo China for a fraction of the cost, this is one SF Chinese waitress that has lost her native roots and does not represent her country very well at all.

Got seated right away on a Thurs night, but waited probably 10mins just to order drinks (aka glasses of water which should have been brought out immediately). And then our waitress forgot about us. Maybe? Had to hail her down to order dinner. Tried the house noodles - nicely spiced fettucine noodles with clovers(?) & zero veggies, dry braised green beans, and sesame chicken (really the only menu option for chicken). Overall tasty, but @ $10+/dish, only one with meat and no side of rice, that seems overpriced. \n\nTo top it all off, we tried to split the bill on 2 credit cards. She comes over, looks down, and says \"$25 minimum credit card\". No apology, no workaround, no nothing. ok then ..one card it is. \n\n\"Fun\" dinner experience if you're in the mood to socialize with strangers and take attitude from angry Asian servers.

ARE YOU KIDDING ME? \"It is an American tradition\" he said and we told a tip is not mandatory and is based on service and he argued with us for about 5 minutes. After arguing with this man, we got up and left. I have never been treated so disrespectfully in a restaurant and I will not go back.", "author": "Megan C."}

Our group got several dishes and we shared family style. We had the Sizzling Rice soup and it was my favorite part of the meal. Rice, chicken, corn and other veges in a chicken type broth with a kick. Awesome! We also got the house noodles which weren't my favorite. There was a salad with vinegar on top which over powered any other flavor. We got the house fried rice and it was ok. The fried eggplant was really good. And finally the sesame chicken was awesome! There was a lot of sauce on it but super good. Overall great meal for good price.", "author": "Monica P."}

We didn't mind the brusque service; the place only had about 8 tables and there were 200 people waiting to get in...\n\nTimes have changed. The restaurant more than doubled in size, apparently back in 1996 or something. I ate there yesterday for the first time in about 18 years. Everyone in my group loved it. It was lunchtime, with a moderate crowd and no wait. The service was friendly and quick. The potstickers were great (my picky son ate two orders); the \"Green Lettuce Wrap\" (it's on the menu now) was very tasty, if a bit oily, and other folks really enjoyed various fried rice and mushroom dishes.\n\nThis place was a destination 20 years ago, and won more than its fair share of \"best of\" awards.

The onion cake came out first and it looked similar to a crepe with red and green onions inside with soy sauce drizzled on the top. It was very good and not too oniony. \n\nThe second dish we received was the fried tofu in black bean sauce.  The fried tofu was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The sauce was not over powering and we loved it. The second dish we received was the egg plant and greens. This was the house vegetarian special. It was flavorful and impressive.

They  have big giant wood tables which you may have to share with many others. But, hey that is part of the fun!

The 4 of us sat incredibly close to a couple who wasn't talking much at all. I bet they heard every bit of our convo...not the business. We got there on the 4th of July at around 5:30pm so there wasn't a wait at all, but as we were leaving there was a line out the door. Crowd was more touristy, but could be attributed to the holiday.\n\nService was fast, which was a plus. The food came out like within 10 minutes. \n\nFood: We ordered the famous sesame chicken, green beans, and a veggie chow fun. To be honest I was sort of disappointed. The food was really greasy, came in small portions, and honestly didn't wow me. Not sure if Ill be coming back, considering all the other options around town....

I had such a horrible experience last time that I gave exact change for a $72.11 bill on my last visit.  I would have given them a negative tip if I could have.\n\nI think the problem is that the owner is no longer there to supervise and the staff doesn't give a F.\n\nService sucks.  We all know that.  They throw food at you, never listen to your requests,  and act as if they are doing you a favor for stopping to listen to your request if you wave at the frantically.  Given that tips are about service, I really do not feel bad at the $0.00 tip.  But I used to tip because the food was good.\n\nNothing was good this time.\n\nThe rice had so much water in it that it came out as a giant blob.  The grains were not distinct from each other and it was more of a paste.  The peanut sauce pot stickers used to be fantastic but now they taste like they are from trader joes and covered in syrup (what happened to the peanut sauce?).  The nan king chicken was sitting on sauce, rather than being covered by it.  They are getting so lazy.  And it used to come with some green things that tasted great, but no more.  Burnt tasting on top of it all.  I could go on about the rest of the problems, but suffice it to say that it's no longer what it was, and it's a shame.  I wish the owner would come pack and whip them back into shape.\n\nOh, and they used to take credit cards, but no more.  I wish they had mentioned that to us at the start as we had to scrounge to find enough cash.  It's embarrassing when your trying to treat someone and then you have to ask them for money.  \n\nThe only thing I enjoyed was the look on the hostess' face when she counted my $72.11 in cash for a $72.11 bill - hopefully they got the hint.", "author": "reza n."}

I love the food here, the Mu Shu tofu is outstanding, the sauce for the sesame chicken is delicious, and the chow mein is so unique. Unfortunately, my positivity ends there. I make effort to visit the restaurant everytime I'm in the city- a couple times a month. Yesterday around 1pm the door was locked, and the hours of operation sign was removed, yet there were people dining inside. I phoned the restaurant and no one would answer. All staff also ignored me outside the door and wouldn't open it to speak to me. I returned today and again, the door was locked, hours of operation sign removed, and no one answered the phone, yet people were dining inside. Finally a woman delivering produce showed up and one of the workers opened the door for her. I basically had to stick my head in the door to get the workers attention. When asking what the deal was she responded, \"we open later- like 5\" and went to shut the door as I tried to ask if they would be opening late the following day also. She closed the curtain in my face and left. If they are closed for a private event, multiple days, they could simply place a sign on the door to avoid confusion. Her behavior was very unprofessional, and this woman was so impolite I question whether I will ever return.

I've never heard a server tell someone they can't have something that is on the menu. That rudeness was unacceptable.\n\nI must say, the man who appeared to be the owner was very polite. Again, the food was excellent and the kind of place where the server just orders for you. Which is fine, but I just think that the CUSTOMER should dictate that, not the other way around.

First, the restaurant is located in SF Chinatown, but we were the only two Asians eating in a packed house full of tourists. The entire theme for the menu conveys the message: \"You order it, we'll fry it.\" I was shock at the possibility that you could go into an expensive Chinese place and the only food choice presented was all fried--even the green union pancakes. \n\nTheir tea was... strange: it is filled with leaves, roots, and other \"colorful\" exotics that I couldn't tell what it was. The table nearby asked us what was in the tea and I wished I could exoticize it further just to mess with their minds. By that time, I wasn't even in the mood for humor knowing that I had to pay for that piece of deep fried green onion pancake with brown sauce slobber all over it. By this time, I was wondering whether there were anything left in the restaurant that actually captures the flavor of Nanking.\n\nOne of these days I'm going to stop listening to that friend of mine. If I were to rate this place on its fried food, I would rate KFC higher for being honest for what it sells. As for the sesame chicken, I could get it at any restaurant named Panda and pay less for it. On that day, I deserve to be punished for committing the crime of going into a Chinatown restaurant filled with non-Asian customers.", "author": "Daniel L."}

The prices on the items were few and expensive. (Rice is separate and tea is extra) Maybe with these prices the food would be plenty or extremely tasty? Incorrect, the portions are incredibly small and the taste is nothing special. I got the 13 dollar calamari (the menu says highly recommended!) and the 10 dollar eggplant. \n\nThe calamari was an incredibly small portion and it tasted okay. It was lightly fried and vinegar and pepper was used for taste. Nothing special. The eggplant in chili sauce was cooked right, but the sauce was more sweet than spicy. \n\nThis came after quite a bit of waiting and when it came, the incredibly rude waiter just left it on the edge of the table. Instead of rice in a bowl they give you a big bowl of rice to put it on dishes set for you. Amazingly enough, my first dish was dirty and was rudely replaced with no apology. While eating the food I could see the waiters touching the food after constantly wiping their hands on a dirty rag. What's wrong with that? They accept cash only. \n\nUnlike other Chinese restaurants, House of Nanking has no sides (such as hot sauce, soy sauce, and etc), so I asked for some hot sauce. The waiter did not respond and when I asked again he started yelling about something and got the hot sauce. Unlike the usual Sriracha hot sauce, the hot sauce was a dark brown color with chili seeds in it and was incredibly oily. \n\nI don't see why this restaurant received so many awards or why people line up to eat at this restaurant.

Once inside, you can't help but notice the grease sliding down the acrylic panel separating the dining area from the wok pit.\n\nWe were seated at the tiniest table imaginable for 3 people, and of course, I was seated in the aisle.  Every time the waiter walked by, I was bonked on the head by an elbow or tray.\n\nThe menu was vast and interpretation was impossible, so the waiter recommended the best items.\n\nThe chow mein arrived on a dinky plate that was nothing short of being mediocre.  It lacked substance and any taste.  The vegetable dish that followed would have been better if it were not for the amount of grease it was wallowing in.  The meat dish that followed was too salty and fried....I did not even touch that.  In the end, I sneaked over to a Mediterranean joint for their hummus and baklava.

Every time I would pass by it there would be a long line of people outside waiting to get into the cramped little restaurant. \n\nI think that it's pretty unanimous that mainly white people love this place and most Asians hate it which is pretty evident since a vast majority of the patrons are white.  Being half white and half Asian, I really wondered which side of my heritage would dominate in terms of my palate.  My dad (white) use to rave about this place when I was a kid.  My mom (Chinese) never liked this place and referred to it as Americanized Chinese food.  In this case the old adage of \"mom knows best\" played out true to form as evidenced by my two star rating. \n\nFirst of all, I thought it was hilarious that they don't even provide you with chopsticks, only forks.  I'm really curious if they even have chopsticks here for the patrons.  A buddy and I ordered the pork dumpling appetizers, salt and pepper shrimp with mushrooms, and the obligatory order of the famous sesame chicken.  The pork dumplings, covered in some kind of sludge that I think was supposed to be a sauce, were probably the worst dumplings I've ever had!  The shrimp was okay, but the rest of the dish wasn't very good.  The sesame chicken was decent, but was very interesting in that it was served with sweet potatoes.  The rice they gave us also did not seem freshly cooked, but much more like day old rice that was reheated. \n\nIn sum, this restaurant is like an overpriced Panda Express and by no means should be considered Chinese food.", "author": "Erich D."}

I really enjoyed their \"Country Rice Chowder,\" a dish my grandmother would frown upon because the ingredients are all scrambled in, making a colorful mess, but that's something I always did with my food.\n\nTheir dishes are geared towards a more westernized palate, as they offer \"fried calamari\" and \"mushu pork.\"\n\nMy last visit wasn't as memorable as the staff can be a bit rude, but I think it's worth visiting at least once. Hopefully the tastiness of their food will make up for their service. However, right before I left, I witnessed the waitresses struggle with guests upon separating the checks.

All the MSG?\n\nThe people working there are downright rude and inattentive.  You have to wave them down aggressively to get any service.  They avoid eye contact on purpose.\n\nI once asked if I could have the food made without MSG and the server practically ripped my face off for asking.\n\nMOST IMPORTANTLY, the cleanliness.   The place is N-A-S-T-Y!  You know what I'm talking about.  You know no one is washing their hands.\n\nThe first time I went there, as I was waiting for the restroom, I saw someone drop food on the floor and throw it back into the vat.  Ok, so I'm sure this happens in restaurants all the time...............BUT............does this happen all the time?\n\nI'm here over Thanksgiving break (dad in town) and I'm waiting for the bathroom again (yep...got a small bladder) and I spot the owner's wife do the following:\n\nTouch her shoe.\nWalk over to a big pot of something soupy and steamy.\nReach her hand in the pot.  A full fist into the very hot pot.  Grab a handful of some mushy looking stuff.  Put into her mouth.  Then she grabs some salt or spice or something, pours the spice in.  Then with that same hand (that now contains the mushy stuff, her saliva and her shoe germs) puts the hand back in and continues to eat like that - like a damn animal.\n\nPATHETIC!  SICKENING!  \n\nAnd it wouldn't be so bad if the people that worked there, particularly the owners, didn't have such a nasty attitude.

The food was so good, that I wasn't worried about the fact that service was a little on the slow side. We ate the following:\n\nSteamed pork dumplings: These were average. The dumpling wrapper is thick and doughy, so you taste more of that than the filling. Sauce = gooood.\n\n3 tiered baby peashoot salad: Fresh, crispy, delicious! The waitress suggested that we add crispy rice and mushrooms and these additions really took the salad up a notch.\n\nPanfried garlic fish: Clean, flavorful, mouthwatering! Sweet and savory!  We have been craving this fish ever since..\n\nWe did not try to sesame chicken, but it looked awesome and a lot of other people were eating it. The atmosphere is casual and comfortable. Some people were hanging out, taking their time and enjoying a bottle of wine with their lunch and others just came for a quick bite. They serve a couple different teas and also have a very small wine and beer list. I will be returning to this place on my next trip to SF :)", "author": "Mollie E."}

The Hot and Sour Soup was as visually beautiful as it was delicious in a layered, complex and just the right amount of heat - way. The Steamed Dumplings in a Black Bean Sauce were .... divine. Why didn't I think of this? Of course, it makes so much sense to pair these wonderful dumplings with a wonderful sauce rather than serve them plain with some soy on the side. Brilliant! The Sesame Chicken was delicious beyond belief and the Tower of Noodles with Braised Fish was more subdued but equally delicious. I felt guilty at the price we paid. NOT ENOUGH !!!! The service was consistently chinese restaurant style - in that \"I cannot care less that you are here\" but who cares?

I had heard of House of Nanking, how it was good (some white person told me that), and that the lines were always out the door. So when we got there and there was no line and no wait for our party of seven I was like wtf ok.\n\nSo we sit down and before we could glance at the menu, the supposed \"head chef\" comes over and says \"First time here? (all of us nodding) OK I Create the  menu for you! It will be good no worry!\" He didn't even ask us if we liked seafood, what kind of meats, no MSG (ha), no dogs or cats, etc.\n\nWhat came next was a barrage of dishes like I've never encountered before. At first came one dish which was gobbled up quickly b/c as mentioned above we were fucking STARVING and COLD. Then, came three more, then two more.. As the speed of the dishes came crashing down faster and faster the eating frenzy among us became more frantic. Eyes were darting back and forth, food was flying everywhere, eating sounds resonated..  and before we knew it we had completed nine dished within 15 minutes. It had to be some kind of world record we wondered. \n\nAs for the same sauce comments, I think I might have to agree.. the sauces were very interestingly close in taste..  but that might have been from combining nine dishes together within 15 minutes.

Our favorite orders were the sesame chicken with delicious sweet potatoes on the side and the crispy (not overly greasy) pot stickers. \n\nThe table next to us had some sort of button mushroom side dish that looked excellent and I meant to add it to our meal, but by the time the food came out we had so much eating to do that I knew we wanted nothing to do with another dish. \n\nThe bill for 4 was really not that bad.

My only nitpick, and the only thing that kept me from giving five stars, is that when you add chicken to a noodle dish the chicken is a little on the dry side.  But that doesn't stop me from ordering it because it's still damn tasty.", "author": "Blevins L."}

I've been coming to this gem of a place for some epic and tasty chinese cuisine for years.  Never noteworthy for service, the turnaround time was sick, and the food delectable.  Until today...\n\nAfter tearing through the onion cakes with a peanut sauce, three quarters of our fried rice, and almost our entire Chicken Nanking...we met our little friend.  Nestled in the fried rice like sweet baby jesu on a bed of hay, and undoubtably as  flavorful and robust as the surrounding constituents, a COCKROACH.  The girlie saw it first, immediately turned her head and began fitfully dry heaving....anndd up and out of the restaraunt.  Im left to consider whether or not she might be pregnant, or perhaps my occasional flatulence at the table was unsettling for her...but then I glanced down and saw what the ruckus was all about.  I brought the detritus to the traditionally cantankerous staff.  We usually accept their poopy pants disposition in leiu of high quality cuisine, but today...I couldn't find the space.  After some significant deliberation and cantonese banter, it was determined that they would change their abusive disposition to only moderately offensive, and remove 'said' rice from the bill.  After she lost her lunch, she lost her restraint, and stated that 'We won't paying for anything within a ten foot proximity to the cockroach fried rice'  and furiously departed the restaurant.  In the fury of departure, we left my messenger bag at the table... and after retrieving it, I am left with a latent fear that some of the cockroaches made it into my messenger bag to colonize our apartment.

A base of soysauce, sugar, garlic, vinegar, & chili peppers with maybe fermented black beans thrown in is no big deal.  Fresh?  well that's a minimum  expectation in San Francisco.  The portions here aren't overly generous  (for the price).\n\nA quite viscous seafood soup with a fried fish & 5 won tons thrown in was wierd.  And $24.  Skip the blossoming Flower Tea @ $3 ea.  i wasn't impressed.  A pot ot tea to share would've done just fine.  Or order beer.  Their signature onion cake was overwhelmed by a sweet peanut sauce.  No, not good.  Their fried calamari did not show any hint of \"fried\", much less \"crispy\".  It was unremarkable!  Three other dishes and rice completed our lunch.

For the main dishes me and my boyfriend ordered chow mein and sesame chicken. Wasn't amazing. Tastes very average. Then my boyfriend asks how come there are no beef entrees to choose from? Our waitress says \"I will order you beef!\"  Ok why not. So glad we did. The beef melts in your mouth. We both were like WOW! I have never had anything like that before. It was crispy on the outside and very soft on the inside. It melted in my mouth. It was on a bed of bok choy cooked to perfection. Had the perfect bite to it.

Of course, my virgin buds had to have a taste. It was crowded, but we were lucky to beat the massive line that formed literally ten minutes after we were seated. It was crazy, busy, noisy... But this is all expected, seeing how popular this joint is. \n\nThe waitress sat us down immediately, and though she seemed a little rude, I'm sure that was just her trying to get us fed fast despite the amount of people present. After some deliberation, we decided to order the Melts In Your Mouth Fried Calamari, the Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken, Chow Mein, and steamed rice. The calamari was lightly coated with Asian spices, fried, and served in a lemon garlic sauce. According to the menu, this item was \"highly recommended.\" Being a huge fan of calamari and finding it necessary to order it wherever I go, I didn't particularly love the calamari at Nanking. However, I did appreciate the fact that there were two calamari options, the second being Tender Saut\u00e9ed Calamari. I'm fairly certain that I did not like the Melts In Your Mouth Calamari because of the lemon garlic sauce, which distracted the normal taste and made the calamari somewhat soggy, which is not to my liking since I love love love crunchy calamari. Thus! I will wrap this up and say that the calamari was alright, but not to my personal liking. I am however looking forward to trying the Tender Saut\u00e9ed Calamari. The Famous Nanking Sesame Chicken consisted of crispy chicken bits soaked in honey sauce and served with sweet potatoes, and some sort of strange fruit that tasted like apples. Two words: Absolutely delicious! The Chow Mein consisted of thick round noodles saut\u00e9ed in soy ginger onion sauce with seasonal veggies. This too was absolutely delicious. We collectively came to the conclusion that these two entrees (the chicken and chow mein), were very authentic and individually deserve five stars. Though the rice seems very insignificant and is rarely mentioned in reviews, I will however say that the steamed rice at Nanking tasted quite good, and not like the overly plain and boring rice I've eaten at other Chinese restaurants. \n\nThough the environment and atmosphere at Nanking was for the most part busy, I did however appreciate the very quaint setup and homey feel. Though it was not located in the very center of Chinatown, I did like how it was somewhat far from it, but a walking distance away, and surrounded by beautiful buildings. Our only complaint was the portions, and how they did not equate to the prices of the items. We felt that compared to other similar Chinese restaurants, the portions could afford to be a bit larger.\n\nOur overall rating is 3.5 stars with potential, but we are willing to give Nanking the benefit of the doubt and go ahead with four stars on Yelp instead of three. Yay for rounding! And happy happy eating!", "author": "Mari H."}

It was a big portion with lots of pieces of fried tofu. The house fried rice was also pretty good. The only thing I didn't like was the onion cake.

Just make sure to down the food with a bucket (approx 32 oz cup) of their awesome unfiltered fruit tea and leave with their rediculous t-shirts. \nI saw a dessert which was a pastry set on top of a small cup of plum wine, heard it was good but didn't try it yet (always too full by the end of the meal!).", "author": "Allen Y."}

I didn't have any issues with the service or the atmosphere as many people posted.  I was, however, a little underwhelmed by their most popular dish, Sesame Chicken.  I did like that it came with sweet potatoes, but I guess it was just too fried and gloopy for my taste.  The menu doesn't have standard Chinese fare...I'm not sure if the items on the menu are House of Nanking specialties or if they're more authentic dishes so my ordering options were pretty limited based on my lack of experience in trying the other things on the menu.  Price was good and food was decent, but I'd probably try somewhere else next time I'm in the area.", "author": "Sushi X."}

Is it worth the price compared to the zillion other similar restaurants nearby?  Probably not, but since I only go to San Francisco for business and I can expense my meals, I think the price is great!  ZING!!\n\nI got wonton soup, and the udon noodles with chicken.  The wonton soup had 3 big wontons and was also full of rice, an unexpected surprise (they don't do it like that on the east coast!).  I definitely could've made a meal of that and an appetizer.  The udon was delicious.  It was a large portion and spicier than I thought it would be.  I loved the texture of the noodles.  I don't remember what my coworker ate for his entree, but he enjoyed it too.\n\nWe ate late, around 2:30, so there was no line, but I can definitely see why people would line up for this place.

He says that most restaurants in Chinatown are just expensive Panda Expresses, so we needed to go to this place.\n\nMost of our food was great! I loved my wonton soup and eggrolls. The wonton soup is not your normal wonton soup; it has lemon, cilantro, rice, and chili oil in it. The eggrolls had big chunks of pork in them and a nice peanut sauce. Both unusual, but very good.\n\nMom got the corn rice chowder with fried potstickers. The corn rice chowder looked like porridge and didn't taste like much. The potstickers were great! Dad and my brother got the sesame chicken and it was great because it had a great sauce and came with sweet potatoes and chayote (I think). My other brother got beef chow mein and quickly inhaled it.\n\nBill was $65 before tip, so it was really reasonable for 5 people to have lunch.

There would be a line going out the door, the service was kurt, everything on the menu was delicious, and when you ordered chow mein the noodles were thick and explode in your mouth with spicy goodness.\nToday I decided to revist the old Nanking'. I was lucky enough to find a meter, but there were garages on every block, so parking wasn't the issue. I wish I could say the same for this dining establishment. I came in around 3pm, there were a few patrons sitting around, but most of the place was empty. I had to go looking for my server, and when I found her she sat me at a filthy table without a menu.\nAfter about 15 minutes I had to flag her down again, and explain that I was in a hurry, so she complied by giving me a menu. I ordered the Chicken Chow Mein, and a water.\nI had to hold my purse on my lap because the table was too dirty for me soft leather bag. After another fifteen minutes, I flagged down another lady, who I believe may be one of the owners. I asked her to wipe down my table. She said for me she would.\nThe chair opposite mine was still covered with food, but I tried to be zen and not focus on that. \nMy chow mein had finally arrived, and my first thought was what happened to the thick noodles? It was still good, but not worth $11 bucks, especially for lunch.  My waitress never came back to check on me or refill my water. I had to waive my wallet around to get them to bring me my check.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-30", "description": "First and foremost, I would not say that this is \"authentic chinese food\".  The food that we ate here was nothing like what I have ate anywhere in China, Macau, or Hong Kong.  The food that you will find here is Upscale, Gourmet Americanized-Chinese Food.  If you are wanting a more legit taste of Chinese Food, don't eat here and go to one of the hole in the wall places. \n\nThere was a line outside the door and it was fairly long at that. I think we waited about 15-20 minutes, so it wasn't too bad.   The restaurant was packed.  They don't have high chairs, so just keep that in mind if you have a little one in your party.   Also, the service was terrible. It was scattered and did feel like we were being somewhat rushed.n\n\nThe restaurant appears to be very vegetarian and allergy friendly. If you tell them what you can't eat, they seem to work with you. They also had alot of veggie options on the menu, so that was much appreciated.  The blossom tea is really cool, and has a good taste.  The braised tofu with broccoli was outstanding and had really awesome flavor. The tofu was cooked perfectly. Hot and Sour soup was some of the best I have had, and it was just the right balance of hot and sour. The house noodles were okay, kinda plain and didn't feel like anything to write home about. My husband loved the seasame chicken and it came with some yams on the side. He said the flavor was great and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  He also really liked the salt and pepper shrimp. \n\nOne thing I absolutely did not like. The server brought a dish to our table and set it down. It didn't look like what we had ordered, but we weren't sure, so person in our party poked it with their fork (yes it was unused but you still don't know someone hadn't ate off the fork and then poked the food). The server realized she put the wrong dish on the wrong table, came over to us, saw that we had poked the food, proceeded to take the dish back and gave it to another table where it should have gone originally. This to me is not okay and I think should have never been re-served to another table.....\n\nThe price was kinda steep.  For 5 of us, with teas, soup, and 4 dishes, it came to 107$.  I didn't feel the price matched the portion size, which was somewhat on the smaller end of the spectrum.  Also, we wanted soup for the whole table, and instead of bringing a large serving and dividing it up as most places do, they charged us per a bowl.  This was also questionable since the other tables near by all had large bowls of soup, but this wasn't on our menu......The other tables all were also of asian decent, so maybe that's why since from other reviews it sounds like there is either a secret menu or one in chinese with more options?  In any event, even tho it was slightly more on the expensive side and wound up being about $25 a head after tax and tip, I suppose it wasn't that pricy.... The decor is plain inside, and I guess if you went to the same restaurant but with fancier decor, the price you would have spent for the same meal probably would have been more expensive, so it was a good value considering that. \n\nHowever, with those few things aside, the food is really tasty and stands out from the crowd. It is definitely worth trying!", "author": "Stephanie L."}

It's good, but definitely not worth the wait to get in, the bad service or the price.  This is a perfect example of a good place resting on it's laurels and letting itself go. I'm not exaggerating my disappointment. I \"discovered\" this place over 20 years ago, before the reviews, the lines and the expansion. I made it a point to dine here the 4-5 times I made it to San Francisco. This time I brought family & friends. I was so embarrassed after talking it up for so many years & waiting outside in the rain to get in. The waitress (not server) practically ripped the appetizers out of our mouths after we questioned her since they didn't look like what we expected. She had brought us the wrong (but similar) order. It went downhill from there. The one plate, out of all that we ordered, slightly worth the effort of eating, was the sesame chicken & whatever that appetizer was that the waitress practically ripped out of our mouths.  Again, nothing to brag about & certainly not worth the price.  Everyone courteously picked at their food until I did the right thing and announced the place sucked & we were leaving in search of decent food. My attempts to express our concerns about the \"horrible, horrible\" service & food were completely ignored. I figured my time was too valuable to waste it making a scene. So, I paid the entire bill (I didn't let anyone else contribute for that!) including, I think, the appetizers brought to us in error.  Not a penny more. Not a single penny towards gratuity!

We told her a couple of must haves.  \n\nNeedless to say out kids were not fans of the appetizers and soups and just the adults had them (with plenty left over so we wasted some $$).  One of the main course for the kids came at the end so by that time they were a bit cranky.  \n\nLastly to make matters worse...we found two different plates with hair in them.  We notified the server (who was also the manager) and she looked at the plate and took it away.  She never said sorry about that which was the most disappointing.  We then found another hair in our soup and showed to another server.  He saw the hair and took it away and never said sorry.  It was ironic at that point the lights in the restaurant were then dimmed.  We talked to the manager about it and she showed very little remorse and said it wasn't a problem with any other tables and made us feel that we were being too demanding.  We pointed to the kitchen and the staff and there was one in particular cutting up the food with long hair and a long braid so put two and two together. \n\nThe manager did give us price concessions but the bottom line is there was no remorse on their side.

The orange chicken was tasty, but not plentiful.  I will say they have the best veggie fried rice I've ever had.  The fried rice is the ONLY reason I gave this place 2 stars. And for the first time in my life in a chinese restaurant, we were never given a fortune cookie at the completion of our meal!

What they lack in curb appeal is made up for tenfold in taste.  The restaurant is composed of two dining rooms composed entirely of communal style tables.  After sipping on my Tsingtao for a few minutes the steamed pork pot stickers arrived.  They were served over the most savory black bean sauce.  The sauce didn't overpower the dumplings as the pork taste really shined through.  It was at this point in the meal, I realized that we were in for a real treat.  If the rest of the meal was a good as the first course, I was going to go back to my hotel room, content and very tired.\n\nMinutes after finishing the pot stickers the entr\u00e9es started to roll out.  So the timing here was very impressive. I never felt rushed but the food came out real fast.  First the salt and pepper shrimp came out.  U20 sized shrimp lightly fried and accompanied with mushrooms and onions were seasoned wonderfully.  Then the sesame chicken came out paired with sweet potato slices both of which covered in a soy/ fish sauce that was very addictive.  To round out our dinner, we also had the house fried rice.  It was light and full of flavor.  It wasn't greasy as most house fried rice's are.\n\nI would recommend House of Nanking to anyone looking for a great Chinese dinner.", "author": "Ben G."}

Everything was sooo well prepared. My mom thought this was the best Chinese food she's ever had - this is such a San Francisco staple - everyone should go here at least once. I've been here about 4 times total now, and when I went yesterday, it was the best I've had so far - everything was so amazing. Their veggie mushu is deeeeee-lish. The vegetables are sauteed so well and the pancake/tortilla thing you put them in was really thin and light. The house noodles are recommended over the chow mein also - that's what one of the waitresses told us. Great decision. \n\nMy mom and I are both vegetarian, and we were highly impressed. You can find so many dishes for vegetarian people. I also love how hole-in-the-wally it is. It adds so much character to the place, and it's hustling and bustling.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-24", "description": "Attention to all House of Nanking newcomers: Before you go to eat here, you have to first decide what kind of Chinese food you like. Authentic or Westernized? If your idea of good Chinese food is Panda Express and egg rolls with sweet & sour sauce, then you'll LOVE House of Nanking. It has everything you'd ever want from a Westernized Chinese restaurant -- overly sweet and thick sauces, overly deep-fried meats, non-spicy spices, and starchy soups. It has a very bustling, crowded atmosphere that will make you feel like you're truly in the night districts of Chinatown.\n\nSo why do I only give House of Nanking two stars? Because, personally, I'm not a fan of Westernized Chinese food. Actually, for me, I feel like House of Nanking serves food that is just a tad better than Panda Express, but around 4 times the price. It was way too much sauce, probably to cover the subpar quality of the actual meats and vegetables.\n\nIn addition, the waitstaff is very pushy -- they seem to think they know what you want even though you clearly say you don't want it. We wanted to try the Country Rice soup, but the waitress told me that she thought I would be much more satisfied with the Spicy War Wonton Soup. We went back and forth about 3 times, before I just gave in. The problem was that when the Spicy War Wonton Soup came out, it was luke-warm, too salty, and had way too much pepper in it. When you say \"spicy\", I expect spicy from chili, not spicy from being over-peppered. Thanks Waitress, you're wrong about what I want -- and I now I have to pay for the $7 soup that I didn't like and I didn't even want in the first place.\n\nThe sesame chicken was okay -- pretty comparable to Panda Express's (which is sad, btw). The glazed eggplant w/ sweet potato is pretty good -- a little too saucy.\n\nI should have known that \"Zagat-Rated = Non-Authentic\" when it comes to Asian food. The entrance is covered with Zagat stickers and awards proclaiming it to be the best Chinese food in SF (probably voted by non-Chinese people) -- that should have been my first red flag to not enter. Especially when just a block away, there are streets littered with truly authentic, much-more delicious Chinese restaurants.\n\nDon't get me wrong though, I'm not dissing those who love Westernized Chinese food. To each his own. Just make sure you love it, before you fall victim to all the raves and awards.", "author": "Roy C."}

The way to order is to figure out what type of meat and what type of vegetable dish you'd like.

Disappointed. \n\nThe beef was this interesting dish - the large pieces of beef were deep fried (almost tempura like). The flavor was so-so. The bok choi however was cooked to perfection. Just enough to cook it without losing the crispiness. \n\nThe house noodles had interesting flavor but I wouldn't say they were amazing. Not sure if I'd order this a second time but it was still good. \n\nThe green beans were probably my favorite - cooked perfectly once again. Crispy yet cooked with very good flavor sauce. I would order these again. \n\nThe scallops were prepared very simply with a mild sauce and spinach leaves (also cooked perfectly). \n\nOverall I thought the products were fresh but I was a bit disappointed with the protein dishes. The chef does, however, know how to cook veggies. \n\nAnother issue with this place is price - roughly $14 a dish? At a Chinese restaurant??

Normally I would get offended and would have a mouth full to say about the crappy service. After working in the service industry for 7 years, I expect nothing but the best service! But this was something else...\n\nSo we come in somewhere between 5 and 6 pm on a Thursday! We ask to sit in the other room, no sorry other room closed... ok fine can we sit over here from the door- no this table taken! So- we ended up sitting by the door! I am still trying to squeeze myself in to sit down, and the server comes over and say ok... ready to order (while snapping her gum in her mouth loudly) - umm.... we haven't seen the menu's yet! Ok! brings over menu's say's ok ready to order... so we nicely ask for another few minutes!\n\nLet me start with the fact that I love chinese food- growing up in san francisco, I have been exposed to the best and worst of it! But the downside of me eating chinese food is I am always sick! :(\n\nAnywho- we ordered the hot and sour soup- which was extremely fresh and delicious, it tasted completely different that I have had it anywhere else, I didn't even as for pepper or hot sauce! incredible!!! we also ordered general tso (Sp) chicken which came with crispy sweet potatoes- yummmy, it also had some sort of pickle apply looking ordeal on the plate which I was absolutely loving! we also had the sizzling beef which was also extremely delicious! I had a glass of their house merlot, which was great...\n\noverall the food is great- I liked the ambiance, the service is so ridiculous that it's hilarious. \n\nwill definitely be returning again!!!", "author": "yana Z."}

This is the kind of place where you get in, order, eat and get the hell out. No lounging around after your meal, they will not allow it. In fact, they once turned the lights out on my cousins and I then proceeded to drum their fingers on the counter and glare at us until we finally left. Again, it's their gig, that's what they do.

Although it might seem a bit touristy &amp; violates the \"If you're looking for true Chinese food, go to one w/ mostly Chinese patrons\" rule, but I do recall enjoying their food the last time I ate there about a year  &amp; a half ago.\n\nOwner/chef Peter Fang opened his diminutive restaurant on the edge of San Francisco's Chinatown in 1988, & lines quickly began forming out the door for his accessible, homey cooking.\n\nSince then,  the restaurant has doubled in size, & the quirky Fang works the front of the house while other cooks prepare the food. Visits from Food Network luminaries such as Jamie Oliver & Rachael Ray, whose smiling mugs adorn one wall, have helped maintain Nanking's popularity. Lines of tourists & locals alike often still trail out the door, rain or shine. Often, his more traditional neighboring Chinese restaurants sit near empty in contrast.\n\nTo eat at Nanking, one must be aware of how Fang operates. He delivers a brusque attitude (in part to keep the busy flow of customers moving in & out) that can take some by surprise. He likes to size up the tastes of the customers after a quick hovering & observational recon & tends to prefer to recommend, no -- decide what you'd like, if you allow him to.\n\nAnd more times then not, he'd hit the mark. This most recent visit, he delivered a chicken chow mein & a beef wrap dish that met both our approvals. \n\nAlthough there is no mention of it anywhere at Nanking, I recently found out that Fang also runs & owns a sister eatery, the Fang Restaurant on the 600 block of Howard Street.\n\nSanta's yelper sez: \"If you let Peter decide what to eat, you won't go wrong (especially if he has served you before), but the 12oz. Cokes for $2.00 a pop (no pun intended) was steep!\"", "author": "Tadashi Y."}

Advice. Ever. The only thing I specifically ordered was my Tsingtao beer and glass of water. \n\nI can't remember what the food was, specifically, but I do know that it was DELICIOUS. We had spring rolls, some chicken, garlic fish, some beef, and I think maybe more chicken?

One scallop was cut in 3 or 4 thin slices so it's not worth what you pay for $13.95. There must have been 3-4 in total. Very sneaky. Both tasted great but I could get more elsewhere for the same quality & taste.\n\nGetting to the germaphobe part. I'm a people watcher. I watched the servers. The same lady that took our order, handled several different pens, the fridge door, a cash transaction, 2 credit card transaction, used the computer and several plates, used her bare hands on the lettuce leaves!!! She was serving the family next to us. She took each lettuce leaf (cupped in her hand), put the meat inside then put it one in each of their plates. The family of 4 did not even care. I don't understand. \n\nThe same lady then continued on with her job then later went to another table & did the same thing. This time with tortilla looking things & once again, using her bare hands then putting the meat inside, folding it then serving to every person on the table.\n\nThe same lady went back to the food area, she put the back of her knuckles on this dish she was about to serve (to feel if it's hot enough i guess)  then she spoke to another server who did the same thing! The lady then put it back under the warmer. \n\nBy then my stomach had done a full routine of a triple back hand spring & I wanted to get out.\n\nThe place is a mess.

My dining companion was eager to alleviate his HoN-nostalgia and we decided to pay a visit to the most hyped Chinese restaurant in the city.\n\nSurprisingly it's not crowded, maybe it was a Saturday. We seated ourselves and studied the menus closely. I have been aware of the hype and fame of this joint, which is not popular among local Chinese. From a quick once-over of the place I realized I was the only Chinese person!\n\nMy dining companion and I quickly decided upon pot-stickers, an eggplant and vege dish, and the house signature sticky sweet sesame chicken with sweet potatoes. Presented beautifully on long rectangular plate are pot-stickers with peanut dip. That was the first time ever in my life that I see pot-stickers deep-fried. The batter must cater to American palette and the dip coordinate fairly well with the flavor of the dumplings! Off the tangent in authenticity but the taste isn't bad.\n\nThe eggplant vege dish tastes more like one you'll have in a Thai restaurant. It's simmered in basil and garlicky sauce. The sesame chicken is my favorite of all the dishes. For what it is, it's done perfectly in taste, texture, and coordination with the sweet potatoes. Perfect dish for white rice.\n\nThe overall verdict: House of Nanking might not dish out the most authentic Chinese fares, but at least they serve delicious American-Chinese food and have done it right. (This is meant for P.F. Chang's ear). One star off for thin service.", "author": "Matthew Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-02-27", "description": "Came here with a group of 5 for dinner last week. Located in the heart of Chinatown, it is one of those longstanding Chinese restaurants that has withstood the test of time. They usually will not seat you until your entire party is present, and you will likely have to share a table with another group unless you have a huge party, or you're a party of two. (This is just a consequence of the layout of the restaurant.) Instead of choosing/ordering things off the menu ourselves, we asked them to bring out a good combination of foods\n\nHere's what we got: \n- vegetable dumplings\n- sesame chicken\n- fried calamari\n- stirfried baby pea shoots\n- salt and pepper shrimp with mushrooms\n- white rice\n\nThe food here is solid. The restaurant doesn't try to be all fancy, and obviously, they serve generic Chinese food. But I think they do it pretty well. I really like that their food isn't overly greasy. Even the calamari, which is straight up fried, didn't leave a filmy/oily sense in my mouth. The vegetable dumplings are delicious. You get about 8 per order - they are filled with really fresh veggies and pop perfectly into your mouth. They were maybe my favorite part of the meal. \n\nBottom line: good food! reasonably priced. I would definitely come back, esp for those dumplings!", "author": "Kei N."}

We believed the waitress when she told us to trust her in selecting the best dishes for us.  As we waited for our food to be served, I looked at what other tables have ordered and I knew right away that we have picked the wrong place to come for dinner.  There was nothing Chinese at all in the food they served.  Almost all the dishes, other than vegetable dishes, were so \"shiny\" as they were drenched in tons of grease.  The onion pancake ordered for us was so unappetizing and bland that I could not bring myself to finish my share.  The beef dish we ordered also looked and tasted crappy.  I definitely felt guilty feeding my stomach with such poor quality food.\n\nAlthough the restaurant may have catered to the Caucasians, I think that it still has cheated them of the Americanized Chinese food experience with the poor quality, extremely greasy, tasteless but expensive food they serve.  By the way, while we were there, one of their own waiters walked in with take out (which looked better and more delicious) from other restaurant and enjoyed it at one of the open tables.  This may not mean anything but I can't help but wonder why the Chinese waiter did not have the chef cook up something for him from the kitchen.  Panda Express is certainly better than this place.\n\nI have eaten at many authentic Chinese restaurants in which the service was horrible but serve excellent dishes.  However, the lousy service at those places was nothing compared to the rude treatment that my party and other customers received here.  We were not served the drinks we ordered until I went up to the waiter to demand for our water and soda.  I was also yelled at by the rudest waitress ever when our soup came and I accidentally moved the bowl soups.  She yelled, \"Don't move the bowls!\".  IWe also saw the same waitress spill beer on another customer and instead of apologizing, she walked away!! \n\nIn short, this place is not worth visiting despite of the number of stars it has received.  It is overhyped and the quality does not meet the price it charges.  Speaking of charges, the waitress has told us it's a cash only place (there was no sign at all in the restaurant, mind you) but I saw with my own eyes that she allowed credit card payment to a Caucasian customer!!  Not honest at all.\n\nI normally have no complaint about the small space a restaurant is in, but I can't help but wonder if the place met the fire department regulation.", "author": "Annie C."}

People were standing in line down the street, the dining room was cramped & a little grungy, but the food was awesome and inexpensive...I especially liked the Tsing Tao prawn dish, made with Tsing Tao beer. \n\nIt's been a while, but I happened to be in the neighborhood and stopped in late on May 13, 2010. A good point is that they were open until 2200h, which is about 30-60 minutes later than restaurants in my neighborhood. The dining room has also doubled in size (they lost the counter & opened up next door) and there was no line that late. A number of people were eating, but no chinese folks. (bad sign?)\n\nI was by myself & seated at a table for 6 with 2 people just finishing. I'm fine with the \"community table\" concept. The gentleman that came next left after he found out that everything on the menu contains MSG.\n\nTsing Tao prawns were no longer on the menu. I asked about them and were told that they would still make them for me. Great! I also ordered hot tea & a cup of rice. Too bad I was by myself, as I would have liked to try the house noodles and other dishes.\n\nI first got an inkling that something might be amiss when I had to ask for chopsticks. Hmmm....catering to tourists? The Tsing Tao prawns arrived -- a bowl of zucchini with a few shrimp cocktail prawns (6 or 7?). The sauce was tasty, although I thought I could taste more MSG than Tsing Tao. But otherwise the dish was not as appetizing as when I had previously been to the House of Nanking (they opened in 1988). I was surprised when flower tea arrived in a beer glass...a little hot to hold. The cup of rice seemed OK.\n\nI was a little shocked at the bill. $13.95 for the Tsing Tao prawns, and $2.95 for the tea! The cup of rice was 75 cents (within expectations).  When I ordered hot tea, I had expected it to cost about $1. The entree somewhere between $8.95 - 10.95.\n\nWith tax and tip, this ended being dinner for $21.....definitely not worth the price.\n\nWish I could have sampled some more dishes, but I'll probably won't be back.\n\nBy the way, they don't like to take credit cards. \n\nLonging for \"the good old days\"....   :-0", "author": "N.

I'm SOOOO tempted to throw a dart at it and order whatever the dart falls on. =D\n4) Free mystery soup with your meal. It seems like the soup is whatever leftover that they have in the kitchen - spinal cord, chicken feet, carrots, mystery meat - and then they boil the mess out of it. The soup itself tastes good if you don't think too much or look too closely at what's inside the soup.\n5) Chili, soy sauce, vinegar, ground pepper condiments in little containers in the middle.\n6) Freaky (to an American anyway) menu items: frog, pig intestine, sea cucumber, hairy mushroom, etc.\n7) The waiters are there to take your order, give you food and drink and give you your check.

Granted they were running some renovations if I remember correctly, and it was always chaotic, messy, sacs of rice piled up everywhere, but the food was good, and it was impossible to wait patiently outside in line without drooling all over your shirt whilst staring down the people in the window with their mouths drenched in tasty tasty sauces...\n\nThis past Sunday we were craving Chinese food. Without even thinking about it we found ourselves outside this joint and decided to wait in the small line that formed outside. The people in front of us were raving about how they had driven into the city all the way from the peninsula just so they can eat here. The people behind me were SF residents. Given that demographic, I was sure the food would have been as tasty as it was 5 years ago.  I also wasn't expecting hoards of tourists.\n\nWrong about tourists. Wrong about taste. Wrong about HoN. The menu had very limited dishes. It didn't even list Mongolian beef. I wonder if it was just the menu they use on weekends or when tourists are in town? Possible?\nWe asked the boss of the joint if they did have Mongolian beef anyway to which he nodded. When it came out, it was a few pieces of beef sitting on this puffy, huge, gigantic bed of fried cellophane noodles. The vegetable of choice was a few string beans. My elephant memory remembers the \"vegetable\" bit to consist of more than just string beans\nThe un-cleanliness didn't bother me, as I never remember it being particularly clean. What I found particularly shady was the Sharpie-written sign that said \"cash only today\" Judging by the grease stain and dust glued to the sheet of paper, their today lives perpetually. \n\nIt breaks my heart to realize that what had been my Chinese restaurant choice by default every time I craved Chinese food, is not even top 10 these days.", "author": "Elo\u00efse A."}

She wasn't kidding. We were seated quickly, served quickly and given the check without asking quickly. It's very efficient, but in a good way. \n\nMy two friends and I shared the fried calamari (which was so-so, but semi-chewy, so I'd say pass on that), the sesame chicken (which was great) and the stuffed mushrooms (which I had never had in Chinese food form before, but were delicious and something unique). We also each ordered a \"serving\" of rice which came in a massive heap, so they don't skimp on portions here. The prices are pretty reasonable, and we had some Tsingtao to go with our food, so it was a complete experience.  \n\nThe atmosphere is that of a very busy, popular and great Chinese restaurant. People running everywhere, overall high decibel-range and little in the way of friendly service, but I know that's not the reason to come here.

It was less than half the size it is now, twice as dirty and the line to get in wrapped around the corner. The food was different, inventive sauces and ingredients giving traditional dishes a new perspective.... and then the tourists found out about the place.\nSince then, they've modernized and expanded the space. The service is still pretty much what it was back then (expect your appetizer to show up 20 minutes after you've finished your meal), but the food does not live up to the memories of the '90s. As people have mentioned numerous times, many dishes use the same, or similar sauces, so when you go in it is best to know what you want and not let the owner order for you. unfortunately, this will often be met with a snide attitude...\n\nI wouldn't avoid going back to the House of Nanking as long as there was no wait and someone in my party had requested going, but I'm not likely to pop in of my own accord anytime soon...", "author": "J.

I get it, its in North beach and occasionally some one famous will come in, but let me tell you everything from the service, to the food, to the ambiance is bad. We had a group of 4 and thankfully there was no wait as we showed up at just the right time. We ordered the following:\nPlum wine - This shit is delicious! BIG problem was that they did not have a bottle and when we asked to order a bottle they gave us no option other then saying it wasnt available in a small size only the $64 large size... WTF? If they cared about service they are easy solutions to this problem.\nChicken Mu shu - OK this is crazy. I love mu shu, and one reason I do is because it supposed to come with plum sauce. This Mu shu cam dry with only rice  wraps. Also the mix of veggies they use was strange.\nSesame chicken - Very good. By far the best thing we ordered.\nVeggie Chow mien - pretty good nothing special\nBeef fried rice - was not good, just not.\n\nSo the food was so so. The service was terrible. A nice man sat us and took our drink orders and then a woman took over for the food  and the rest of our visit. She was moody and inhospitable. Our food all cam out at different times which made enjoying dinner as a group and celebrating my friends Birthday difficult. This was especially difficult for my friend who is a vegetarian because two dishes came out that she couldnt eat before hers arrived 15 minutes later. The waitress missed the appetizer I ordered but that was probably for the best.\n\nBy the end of the night my guy friend was nauseous and indeed had to pull over while driving because he felt so ill. I believe a small bout of food poisoning followed. I would never go here again. There are plenty of great places in North Beach (Brandy Ho's was next door) and absolutely fantastic places in China town which is like three blocks away.", "author": "Vero V."}

There's a line out the door, the staff is mildly entertaining, the service is relatively good.  I really want to say enthusiastically -- \"YES! I LOVE YOU TOO!\" but, this relationship fell short of a connection.\n\nWell, you may ask, what is the missing piece?  What caused the lack of a love connection?  And the good o' and true -- \"WHY DON'T YOU LOVE ME BACK?!\"  Please allow me to explain.\n\nFirst of all, upon closer inspection, this place is a tourist trap.  I would say at least 80% of the people who were dining were from out of town.  Yes, they've had celebrity chefs like Jamie Oliver and Rachel Ray to visit and eat their food.  That should be enough of an endorsement to say their food is great.\n\nAh, there's the sore spot!  Let's go further -- It's the food!  I do agree, they do use fresh ingredients -- they get away by throwing fresh basil into every dish.  The party that I dined with left the food order up to the owner.  What an opportunity to take advantage of those who have no clue how to order!  We had a total of 8 dishes for a party of 6.  \n\nWith the exception of the stir-fried sugar snap peas, everything else was either fried or completely drowned in this syrupy sweet sauce.  We were fed well, but I definitely felt a ball of lard forming in one corner of my stomach as the meal progressed.\n\nWell, that couldn't have been too bad -- but here's to add insult to injury, the bill came out to $180 (including tip).  $30/person?!  For mediocre \"fusion\" chinese food?!  I don't think so.  I've dined better on $30/person at any other chinese restaurant with a full banquet meal which included jelly fish and other exotic dishes that were not fried and drowned in syrup.\n\nI'll have to say House of Nanking, you might be a beacon of light for out of towners but you're no home in my book.", "author": "Mei C."}

The service was a little confused at first, but not about anything important. We had to ask for water 3 times and somehow wound up with 5 glasses for 3 people. But they made up for that by bringing our food incredibly quickly.\n\nAnd the food was wonderful. The sesame chicken was, as other commenters have said, the best I've ever had. I would also recommend the house noodles. I would even recommend the melt-in-your-mouth fried calamari, and this is coming from someone who has a pretty strict \"no mollusc\" policy (exceptions usually involve chowder with bacon).\n\nAll-in-all, it was an excellent experience. Contrary to what other commenters have said, despite the packed house and high turnover rate, I never felt rushed. And after a few communication difficulties were resolved, the service was quite good. The prices are not terribly cheap, but for what you get, it's a fantastic deal.\n\nOne note - all the dishes I had were very heavy on the garlic.

Good thing I went here early so the line wasn't too bad.  The only reason I went here was because it had really good ratings on Yelp and it was really close to where we were standing.  It's a really small place. Only one person could walk thru the aisles at a time. The waiters had to wait for each other to go first before they can go. I should have known it wasn't good from the moment I stepped inside. It was full of foreigners.  Not a single Asian, not to mention Chinese person in sight.  Me and my peeps were the only Asian people there. The line started forming right after we got seated.  And again, only foreigners. The waitress pushed the special fish soup that's not on the menu, and we order the sesame chicken and calamari. The calamari was my fave out of the three.  However, it was not \"melt in your mouth\" as it claims on the menu.  The sesame chicken was really salty, and not as good as Panda's Express orange chicken. The soup (I still have no clue what it was) was very funky tasting.  The fish was not fresh, the broth was white like milk and had a lemony taste to it, and there was way too much vermicelli in it.

Located in the outskirts of Chinatown, there was a line out the door just to get into the restaurant - something you usually don't see unless the restaurant is something awesome.  We decided we'd head into here on our first night, and tried a few different dishes.\n\nI understand that this isn't supposed to be traditional Chinese, that it's supposed to be fusion between Chinese and American, but the two flavors just didn't mix well at this restaurant.  I've been to other places that bind the two effectively, but this was just poor quality on many levels.\n\nA lot of the dishes were too slobbered with sauce to bring out the flavor of the actual dish.  We ordered the grilled calimari, but they brought out deep-fried, so we had to send that back.  When the right one finally did come out, it was over-cooked, making it too rubbery.\n\nWe didn't want noodles on the side, so we got some rice.  The rice was under-cooked, like it was going to be used later to make fried rice.  We returned it, and asked them to please bring out some fully-cooked rice that we could enjoy with our meal.  When they came back, it was cooked a little bit longer, but it was still very under-done.  I would think with a restaurant that goes through so much rice, they would know how to at least cook it.\n\nOverall, I wasn't very impressed with the dishes.  If it was delicious food, I'd have no problem waiting in line and paying a bit of cash for the meal, but as it was I feel that I wasted time and money for something that wasn't good at all.  I hope my experience was just one random bad one, because I can't understand why so many others give this place such rave reviews.  I definitely won't be returning here, though.", "author": "Garrett P."}

The sizzling rice soup on the other hand was extremely good. The crispy rice added an extra dimension to the dish. Our waitress recommended the onions cake and we got a plate of that.

For example, the hot and sour soup--so amazing in the past--was almost tasteless this time.  Same with most of the other dishes, with the exception of the poached scallops.  Not sure how to explain the decline, although I know the owner now spends his time at Fang (his daughter's restaurant) and may be less involved in upholding the quality at Nan King.  Whatever the reason, the food was completely unimpressive and not worth the trip.  Sad to see this great San Francisco gem slip into total mediocrity.", "author": "Paul W."}

I suppose Zaggat can be thanked for this, but come on now! Because of the tiny size of the restaurant, you are forced to sit next to other parties in a way that suggests that you are all together. while this would be jim dandy if we all had manners, I and my GF were forced to sit next to a couple who left their manners at home. They barely tipped, sent their bill back because there was a .75 cent over charge for rice they didnt order, and they never used \"please\" or \"thank you\" a single time to the server who while busy, still got every single thing they needed quickly. \n\nOh, then to top it off as I was walking out the door I called the guy who was at my table a \"tool\" underneath my breath. He heard me, and then proceeded to call me out and have me come back and call him that to his face....I did. I also kindly explained that where I come from you say \"please and thank you\". The man was stunned. Never have I seen someone go from ready throw down to being outright embarrassed to be alive.

Wanting to show them a complete tour of tried-and-true SF restaurants, I kept Nanking on my shortlist.  On the last day of their visit, we decided to give it a shot.  Our idea was to split ONE DISH since none of us were very hungry.  \n\nWe walked in at 12:30, the height of the lunch rush.  No worries, we were seated immediately.  So far, so good.  But that was where the good times ended.\n\nWe had looked at our menus for about 7 seconds, when, all of a sudden, Ms. Crazy Nanking lady approached us.  \"First time here?,\"  she asked us.  We replied \"yes.\"  GONE were the menus, locked up in her tight little fist.  \"How hungry are you,?\" was her next inquiry.  Speaking for the group, I replied that we were just \"a little\" hungry.  Then she asked us what we like.  Unsure as to where this was going, we agreed: Shrimp, Beef, Chicken, we like everything.  VHOOOSH.  She was gone.\n\n1 appetizer, 3 huge courses (one shrimp, one beef, one chicken) and 1 weird flower tea thing that didn't taste like much, and $53 later, the three of us sat there, stunned.  Were we just totally railroaded, or what?\n\nThe worst part was that none of us liked the food!.  Mom and grandma each tried a piece of chicken, but put it back.  When we complained, crazy-girl just said, \"oh really?  most people like it.\"  Too bad for us, I guess.\n\nI know this place has a cult following; we could tell by the line outside the night before, and the lunch rush that day, but look, what's the point in yanking away the menus when it's clear that your patrons are new to the game, and don't yet \"get it?\"  \n\nI wasn't amused, and we all left hungry and ticked off.

I Yelped for a Chinese restaurant where the owner is very bossy and orders for you and House of Nanking came up. When we went, however, it was very different. It's rather dark inside and the doors are covered by a curtain so don't be deterred. \n\nWe ordered the sizzling rice soup, fried calamari, sesame chicken and sauteed eggplant as well as some hot tea. The rice soup was not what I was expecting as it had many more ingredients in it than I was used to and the rice didn't sizzle as it slid into the soup. =T The fried calamari was delicious and tender. Chinese-style fried calamari is not your typical calamari with golden-brown batter. It's very lightly fried and allows much more of the natural flavor of the calamari to come through. The sesame chicken wasn't anything spectacular - it tasted much like other sesame chicken I have had but I did love the fried sweet potato squares that came with it. Last but not least was the sauteed eggplant. It was delicious! Flavorful, tender and moist, it might have been my favorite dish.\n\nThe coolest part about this restaurant is the hot tea. I was expecting typical Chinese tea but out came three ginormous glass mugs (they almost looked like beer steins) filled with amber liquid and with a plant floating on top. However, after a few minutes, I noticed that the plant slowly sank and was opening up. And a few minutes after that, the flower (as we found it to be) blossomed! In the tea! And it didn't just blossom at the bottom but spread out a stem and blossomed up into the mug as well! Awesomeness. The tea itself is very sweet so if you're not into that, don't get it.\n\nIf you can find street parking, it's free after 6 p.m., but if not, there are several public parking lots nearby that are reasonable.", "author": "Christine P."}

I was so excited!) but the sauce was way too salty and overpowering, and then they just filled in the remaining space on the rest of the plate with as many leafy greens as they could fit, mostly to absorb the flavor, and an enormous bowl of rice.

I failed to follow my own rule and paid the price. The litany of disasters was unbelievable:\n\n1) Nasty, greasy onion pancakes doused in a sweet, nasty peanut sauce that doesn't exist anywhere in China\n2) A mushroom, basil and onion dish that tasted overwhelmingly of onion and used button mushrooms instead of the wide variety of delicious fungi used in Chinese cuisine.\n3) Green beans that had never met garlic and were made in the same nasty peanut sauce\n4) Awful moo shu beef that were mostly fat and stuffed into a pancake.\n\nI am appalled that this place merits a line outside in a city with so many wonderful dining options, and dares call itself Chinese. Do yourself a favor, leave the line outside the door to the tourists, and go to R&G Lounge further down Kearny or Koi Palace in Daly City.

This restaurant is an insult to Nanjing, and to Chinese food in general.  It's NOT shanghai style cuisine.  It's SHIT STYLE CUISINE.   I only ever came here because my caucasian friends insisted. Greasy, fried, syrupy, MSG laden, lots of fried noodles and frickin WATER CHESTNUTS.  You know, WE DON'T put fried noodles and water chestnuts everywhere.  ESPECIALLY the light, sweet flavored Shanghai style.  The food is perhaps what Mr. Chau strives to be.\r\n\r\nYou want shanghai food?  check the richmond.  Shanghai noodle shop is OK.  shanghai dumpling house is mediocre.  Jai yun near chinatown is ACTUALLY nanjing style food (which is similar to shanghai style), and is AWESOME.\r\n\r\nThe Place sucks--I have to squeeze into this little hallway between tables because there was like nowhere to sit.  And I'm not small.  Lighting is so bad I can barely see my food--probably intentional, considering how bad the food looked and tasted.  Tables were sticky, which is typical for cheap chinese, but not for the amount I was paying.\r\n\r\nThe Service sucks--I walk in and at my place setting, guess what:  a plate, and a fork.  Yup.  So I look for a waiter cause I just want a bowl and a pair of chopsticks.  No one in sight.  I can't even flag one down when I get up and walk around.  So I just grab my own bowl and chopsticks from the waiter area.  And then proceed to force-feed myself my meal.  And then pay like $15 for it.  Split between 5 people.  THIS IS JUST WRONG.  $15 at a good chinese restaurant would get me an above average meal that would fill me.  THIS WAS SHIT.  I had to go get a pastrami sandwich around the corner afterwards, to get the taste out of my mouth, and to fill me.\r\n\r\nIf this were the last restaurant on earth, I wouldn't eat here.

Overall, it just didn't meet the hype.\n\nI am sure you get a better experience from dining in. Get a couple Tsingtao's an order of the crispy beef and I can see this being bomb.com.

I have not eaten here in nearly a decade and it was my plan to never again but family obligations overruled my good intentions.\n\nThe chef/owner/now the dictator front of the house guy told us that he will order for us.

We got a fish dish that had a slightly different sauce (sauce #2), but we remembered it as the sauce that topped the wontons served earlier.  The noodle dish had sauce #1.  The mushu pork was okay but tasted a lot of sauce #1.  And so forth...\n\nI could tell even the kids were disenchanted with the place but politely thanked me for a good meal.  Despite my best efforts, my sister beat me to the check which I think was three times that we would have paid at a better joint in Chinatown.

It wasn't what we expected when we had ordered it- it comes out like deep fried beef pieces tossed in mayonnaise. We were all expecting slices of beef, sizzling in a clay platter or something.\n\nService is pretty good as long as you're aggressive as well, i.e. raising your hand and saying \"excuse me,\" though most of the time their many, many servers are on hand. Again, you're in the middle of Chinatown, so you have to remember you're never going to get 5-star service; it's just not what we do anywhere in Chinatown!\n\nI'd take out-of-town buddies here again, but as a native local, I wouldn't eat here regularly, only because of the prices and how far it is from where I currently live.", "author": "Noreen S."}

For a Wednesday evening, right after work, this place was crawling with tourists and left me with a look of despair on my face as soon as I walked in.  I ignored my flight/fight instinct which told me to get the fuck out of there and sat down at a wobbly table.\n\nEverything that pro-HON Yelpers have said are exactly what I hated about it.  \n\n1)  \"It's great for groups!!\"  No.  It's not.  Stay home.  You groups are annoying!  Tell your friends to go somewhere else with more space.  There were groups EVERYWHERE.  Co-workers.  Families with children. Large groups filled with overly-exuberant tourists.  Why did they decide to invade HON?  Could it be because ....\n\n2) \"Rachel Ray, [the most annoying women on television], ate here [and told EVERYONE with a stomach that it was fabulous?].\"  I was eating among Ray-ophiles.  That sucks.  I have better taste than that!  Everything she promotes turns to shit in my mind as soon as that association has been made.  Remember how people used to love Katie Couric?  Just you wait for Rachel's turn ...\n\n3)  \"The owner takes your order!\" It's great to have that sort of intimate touch, but the man has the tendency to hang out.  Don't hang out with one group of one-timers (tourists) for 20 minutes while starving couples or regulars begin to gnaw on eachother for sustenance.  Not good for repeats ...\n\n4) \"I love Nanking Sesame Chicken.\"  Used to be mind-blowing, but now it's just a messy, sticky, mound of fried sweetness on a fancier plate.  What happened to the thicker slice of sweet potato with the steamy inside lightly tossed in the special sauce?  My dish was soggy, and the sweet potatoes were mere slivers.\n\nI'll miss you HON.

On my first visit, we went in one side of the restaurant, were led thru a narrow space thru the kitchen in the back, and then out to the other side of restaurant. Quite literally. Bizarre. \n\nI'd only go at night and eat by the glow of the hot pink neon so I couldn't really see the layers of grease caking the walls, floors and the cardboard boxes lining the windows in front where one of the chefs was doing his thing standing on top of an old foot stool to hover over a wok. \n\nI've heard they've done some work on the joint in the last few years, but I still prefer to go the take-out route and suggest you do too.\n\nDisclaimers aside, the food has rocked every time I've been there over the last six years. Just thinking about the pea shoots (something you don't see often enough on Chinese menus) makes me salivate. Don't even bother looking at a menu. Tell your waiter how hungry you are and let them do the rest. Don't look down, don't think about all of the health codes you've just witnessed being broken - just enjoy!\n\nTip: Two words. Take-Out.

The Mu Shu featured peas instead of cabbage last night when I was there. No authentic Chinese place would make the substitution, but I think HoN does just because thats whats cheap and fresh at market. Its still good though. Everything is really tasty and served very fast. I might take some exception at the tea ($2 a mug! And I'm not a big fan of the floating flowers) but I haven't had a bad meal here. The To Miou (Pea Shoots) with minced pork is particularly good, as is the scallion pancake with peanut sauce, but I think its hard to go wrong.\n\nThe Experience is all about brusque servers who know what you want better than you do.

Back when I was a freshman at UC Berkeley, San Francisco to me consisted of North Beach and China Town (my friends and I would laugh at the tourists who went to Fisherman's Wharf... that was before I realized that Fisherman's Wharf is just a place that San Franciscans go to get away from the San Franciscans who are trying to get away from tourists). \n\nI had heard about House of Nanking from a friend who spoke in low, grave tones about this leetle hole-in-the-wall on Kearny. He told me that Francis Ford Coppola ate there. He told me that Herb Caen (who?) immortalized it. Well, if Herb Caen (who?) immortalized it, then it must be Really Something. \n\nI loved the packed-tighter-than-sardines-in-a-telephone-booth delirium of the place. I loved the little spiky-haired, no-nonsense chef-owner who gave us our order. I would later tell all my friends and new initiates--with the same low voice and arched brows--that THIS was the proper way to order. I loved being in on something. Conspiracy = quality.\n\nNow, a decade later, I have dissed my enchantment. The gauzy film of inexperience has been liften from my wizened eyes. Or maybe it was a gauzy film of burnt sesame oil. But House of Nanking is a smirking fraud.\n\nI'm not saying the food sucks ass (though it can, on occasion); it's just that the hype stinks worse than yesterday's cabbage, and there is a uniformity to the dishes that is not surprising, just...well, not up to the hype. In fact, I could go to Becky's Chinese in Rockridge (see my other review) and gaze at the awesome wooden model boats hanging from the ceiling as I slurp up my PACF (perfectly average chinese food) and save $6 on BART fare.\n\nMy cousin is still under the spell.\n\nSave yourself a trip: go to Eric's (you heard me) in Noe Valley instead.", "author": "Zak N."}

But what it's certainly not selling is its food...at least, not Chinese food.\n\nI went here with a friend from Texas who had received a recommendation from friends.  After waiting in line for about 20 minutes, we were quickly ushered inside to a cramped table in the corner, next to the kitchen.  We had a short chance to look at the menu before someone came over and asked us what kind of stuff we liked - seafood, shrimp, beef, chicken.  Well, that was that, after giving what basics we wanted, and knowing we would have a mystery menu.\n\nThe soup was interesting...a wonton soup that had wonton skins that were much tougher than they should be, with a little bit of chili oil and herbs that I would usually associate with Vietnamese cuisine.  Then came the food...a sesame chicken, a braised tofu, and some sort of braised beef.  While tasty and certainly not bad, by the end of the meal, I found everything tasting rather similar - a little vinegary, a slight taste of salt and other flavors.  Overall, it really just seemed to fall flat.\n\nAnd surprisingly...considering we only had four dishes for three people, a total of $20/person including tax/tip seemed a little steep for Chinese food.  As my friend's girlfriend remarked, it certainly wasn't Chinese food by usual considerations.\n\nIn general, I don't think I'd recommend this place to anyone - there are better places in Chinatown, and most certainly in the Richmond or the Sunset.

The writer wrote this restaurant up for cheap/good digs.\n\nWell, it really wasn't cheap, and it was far from good.  I would say that we have pretty good taste in food, having lived in some of the most culturally diverse cities--Chicago, L.A., and have tasted our fair share of different cuisines, but the food here is far worse than a Panda Express (in fact, I would prefer that).\n\nTo begin with, was the ambience of the place.\n\nThis is a little hole-in-the-wall type of place, and the interior is bare bones, w/ metal picnic chairs, grimy tables and cracked dishes.  The dishes come pre-fingerprinted and the rice bowl looks like FIDO's water dish.  \n\nYour drinks arrive in cans, no glasses, which I was actually thankful for, as I could wipe off the tops.\n\nThen there was the manager.  Upon sitting down, she approached us and brusquely asked if this was our first time here.  When we said \"yes,\" she started interrogating us as to what foods we like--\"You want soup? You will eat the special Won Ton Soup! Do you want chicken or beef?  Chicken--then you have to eat the Sesame chicken.\"  I tried to pipe in, as that was not what we wanted, but then she rushed off with our order.  \n\nWhen the soup arrived, we receiced a bowl of WATER with bits of fried chicken that were soggy (flavored like KFC) and some won tons.  The won tons were ok, but literally, the broth WAS water.  No chicken stock, no salt/pepper.  Water.  \n\nThen, came the sesame chicken.  I'm not sure what part of it was sesame, as there was no sesame flavor/seeds/etc.  It was basicaly a mound of gristly fried to death chicken bits (if there was a shred of chicken in the batter) smothered in a heavy orange/teriyaki sauce that was very heavy.  Accompanying this were sliced yams that would have been fairly tasty, had they not been smothered in the same sauce.  \n\nThe whole meal, you could hear the staff yelling back and forth in the background.\n\nThe sesame chicken came to $8.95 and the won ton soup was also $8.95!!   Just down the street  (1 block) is R&G whose rice plates start at around 6-7 bucks.  \n\nIn sum, very abrupt, rude staff, horrible atmosphere (worried I may contract something), and the worst food in general I have ever eaten and I've eaten Chinese/Vietnamese food for over three decades.  Don't go here unless you're bringing someone you really don't like...", "author": "Tommy L."}

It was early in the morning and I was a bit irked, but managed to smile at the TSA agent standing by the machine and said, \"good morning, how are you?\" To which he replied , \"I'm doing just great and how are you?\" so I replied, \"I'm just fine and dandy.\" He laughed and said that my \"fine and dandy\" was about as sincere as his \"doing just great,\" and then asked where I was headed. When I replied \"San Francisco,\" the agent beamed and said, \"Best place to visit in the world! You MUST visit the House of Nanking!\" He proceeded to write the name and street location (Kearny Street) on my boarding pass and handed it to my husband as I went into the machine. I posted a photo of my boarding pass on Facebook, and no sooner had I done so, when half a dozen friends said that I MUST go to House of Nanking! So, the TSA not only screens you now, but gives you decent restaurant recommendations. Well, I was very happy I took the TSA agent's advice and made the sojourn to House of Nanking. I had a delicious dining experience: I would definitely recommend ordering the onion cake (a tasty take on a scallion pancake, but more crisp, fresh and served with a yummy peanut sauce) and the flowering tea (a lovely flower opens from a little ball of leaves floating in a beer stein-sized glass). The onion cake was so compelling that a couple dining next to me asked me what it was and I obligingly gave them slices to taste: the portions were so generous, I could not finish it by myself. Further proof of the onion cake's allure is that I was sitting in the window with my back to the street and a man came into the restaurant and said to me, \"Excuse me: I was walking by and had to ask you what you are eating--it looks so delicious!\" I told him it was the onion cake and that he should try it, as it was indeed delicious. The man proceeded to sit down at another table and ordered the onion cake. The service was perfectly pleasant and obliging and I was very happy to have had my very delightful House of Nanking moment. As a matter of fact, a week later I wound up sitting next to a San Franciscan at Cafe Sabarsky (at the Neue Galerie) and asked her if she had ever been to the House of Nanking: as it happens she had not, but she wrote it down and said she would go.

I ordered the house noodle specialty which was solid, but a little pricey at $10, given that many Chinatown places (if they served Shanghai-style noodles) would sell a larger portion at $6-8.\n\nOverall, I was very underwhelmed.

Getting seated after a half hour wait outside, we were given two menus for seven people. They might as well have given us none, as our waiter refused to allow us to pick our dishes. Through a strange mix of aggressiveness, unintelligibility, and our unwillingness to brave the streets - he persuaded (or rather forced) us to submit to his will. We tried to get in at least a couple of instructions - no beef, no sweet sauces etc that were marginally respected.\n\nThe food arrived quickly, I suspect, because they were just serving whatever was being cooked up by the kitchen. That being said, the sizzling rice soup was great, and unexpectedly spicy. The rest of the dinner (onion pancake, deepfried potstickers, some fish dish, sesame chicken, mushrooms with onions, shrimp with spinach) was hardly impressive. The one exception was mushu pork which was unedible - spare yourself please.\n\nDefinitely not an experience worth repeating.", "author": "Looja T."}

At first I love it, then I realize its not so great. \n\nFirst of all, it's sort of expensive for me as a college student. To get enough food to fill me up, it will take some $$ at this place. It is only around $10 a plate, so at first you think it is only a tad more expensive than your normal corner chinese place... but oh are you wrong. You'll have to order at least 4 plates to feed you and one other person.\n\nThe food there is really good, but don't expect variety. The chef / waitress will treat you to what he thinks you will like (as long as that's what you want him/her to do). However, this is easy for him as they only have 5 main entree dishes (IIRC). And they all use the same sauce. However, I LOVE their sesame chicken, and the soup I had there is the best soup I've had in my life.  Perhaps this should warrant 4-5 stars? I dont know, because like I said, there are only 5 main dishes, all with the same sauce.\n\nService isn't the best in the world, but I wasn't expecting much from this type of the place, and so I haven't removed any stars due to this. Just remember you wont see any smiling faces if that is what you are looking for. I will mention though that I celebrated my birthday here with my parents when they visited me. My parents gave the owner of the place a birthday cake, he turned off all the lights in the place and had everyone sing happy birthday to me. That was pretty cool for a birthday present.\n\nI don't know why the wait is so long to this place (another downside). Chef Jia's next door is just as good in my opinion. In fact, I make a trip downtown one to three times a month to eat at Jia's. At least there I can get some cheap, good chinese food with variety.", "author": "Aaron M."}

Now that they've expanded, expanded and expanded again (including the prices) it's not nearly so special, walls of awards and signed chef photos be damned!  Bring tourist friends here whose Chinese food experience is limited to LaChoy out of a can or take-out eggrolls and chow mein.\n\nDO NOT LET THEM ORDER FOR YOU!!!  This is a quaint, carpe diem experience that you can leave to the uninformed, scared tourists.  Definitely order from the menu and insist on what you want.  If you let Peter, the owner, order for you he will bring you the most expensive, most common dishes on the menu.  Counter surly with surly - it's not like they need the repeat business or will treat you any worse!  Part of the secret is learning the \"Code of Nanking\" which includes knowing what you want when Peter comes to take your order (if you don't know right then he may never return), expecting the food to be thrown on your table (part of the charm) and not being afraid to speak up if you want something (they won't accommodate you otherwise).\n\nAs for the food, the Nanking Chicken is the signature dish and is a must-have.  Other things I recommend are the fried tofu with pea shoots (they only serve this in season), the sizzling rice soup, the mu shu beef and the shrimp puffs served with a peanut sauce.\n\nWhile there are very few Asian patrons, it helps to go with someone who speaks Cantonese so you can be assured of slightly better service (which isn't saying much).  There are certain items NOT on the menu that seem to only be available to those who can order in Chinese.  Go early to avoid the line, although it always moves quickly.  And don't be afraid to yell out to a server if you need something - it's the only way they'll give you the time of day between getting seated and getting the bill.", "author": "Jon B."}

You've gotta go to House of Nanking. Best. Food. Ever! And Let the owner order for you\". So naturally, I was excited and followed directions.\n\nIf you've heard anything about the owner, you must picture him to be similar to the Soup Nazi on Seinfeld, at least I know I did.  I went to have lunch with a friend and finally check out House of Nanking.  We asked the owner for suggestions which meant he just wrote down what he was going to send over. I've got some food restrictions so I asked for shrimp only entrees, at which he tried to convince me for a moment to get beef or chicken instead (to mix it up a bit), but I politely declined (hoping not to anger him and get banned from the restaurant! haha)\n\nEveryone sits pretty close to each other, whether you know the people next to you or not.  Somehow it's not too awkward though, except when you stare at each others food wondering what it is... The food he sent over was pretty good, and the few times I've been there he's surprisingly sent over different entrees everytime. The food is good, but I will say that around my third visit I felt like all the hype was a tad bit overrated.  The food is good though so check it out, the Sesame shrimp is pretty yummy!\n\nThe only part I wasn't too crazy about is that althought I really like that the owner sends over an entree he thinks you'll like, it made me a little hesitant in asking too many questions about ingredients entrees since it was never really \"approved\" by me at the time of ordering.  This has resulted in sometimes getting veggies we're not too crazy about or sauces that we thought were just okay, but I guess it's also the opportunity to try diff entrees we might not otherwise order. \n\nOh and the service (especially getting rice) is a bit slow... We've gotten our entrees many times before the steamed rice made it, and by the time the rice gets there, the food is a little cold... not too happy about that.", "author": "Shafaq C."}

In the old days when it wasn't always crowded, the owner (the friendly cool guy who walks around talking to customers in the restaurant) would come to sit with customers (those who can speak Mandarin would have a big advantage) and ask them what they'd like to eat.  Then he'd get up and either give the orders to the chef behind the scene or he himself would prepare the dishes.  These dishes were nowhere to be found on the menu.  I love this style!  It's also known in Japanese as \"omakase\", meaning chef's choice for the whole meal in English.\n\nIn recent years, there has never been a time that I don't see a long wait line in front of the place.  I doubt the owner has time to take care of the cumstomers on such intimate level anymore.  But what do I know right?  I am just a guy from LA.  Maybe the locals have more insights.  It wouldn't hurt to find the owner/chef and ask what's good for the day.  You'll be surprised.\n\nFinding a parking space is a painful process, especially when hunger and downtown SF are both present in it!  Last time I was there I parked 3 blocks away by a parking meter, and then I had to run to a local Chinese market to buy some fruit to get coins for the meter...and it was raining!!!  Welcome to SF!  Bring your piggy banks with you.\n\nAnyway, this place is a \"must go\" in SF.  Oh, I almost forgot.  Do order its Tsingtao Beer chicken (not sure if it's on the menu but that's what I always order without looking).  It's as tender as the famous Italian chicken marsala, but perhaps not as fatty.", "author": "Takechiyo L."}

I'm definitely more picky than the average Bay Area guy, especially with \"Chinese\" food (see my PF Chang review), so after having so many prejudices floating around my head about this restaurant, I did not expect much.\n\nWe waited about 15-20 mins outside in line, and felt judged when the owners of Chef Jia's Chinese Restaurant glared at us with their heavy eyes.  Even after hearing some possibly remotely racist comments from those around me, the night was not starting off well.  The one saving factor House of Nanking had prior to eating their food was the fact that all the wait staff was Chinese, who actually spoke fluent Mandarin.\n\nThe decor inside is such that it's modern, and the menu is a very basic 2 page menu obviously written to cater to the masses.  With words like \"velvety\" used to describe fish, I already started to assert my premonitions about this being another PF Chang.\n\nI'll echo what every yelp review here says in which the service is horrible.  After seemingly getting our \"in\" and street cred with the owner by speaking Chinese to him, we were ignored as those non Asians around us were being served first, despite ordering after us.  We bothered them 3 times to see about our food, and finally it came.\n\nAs I said before, I was really wanting to give this a walloping one star review, but the food was just that good.\n\nSteamed dumplings, salt & pepper pork chops, and the sesame chicken were on our agenda for the night.  All definitely were more americanized with relying heavily on the sauce to make the dish.  I'm no expert on Nanking (or Nanjing, wherever you may be from) cuisine, but the modern dishes in which the food was served, the lack of chopsticks being offered, and just the overall ambience, hinted to me that this was not 100% authentic.\n\nBut no matter.  The dumplings were amazing and tasted hand made.  The chili/garlic sauce it came with was perfect.  \n\nThe pork chops were equally as good, if not a tiny bit repetitive, as the sauces between the 3 dishes seemed very similar.  They were crispy and well seasoned, to complement the chili/onion sauce that came with it.\n\nThe \"House of Nanking Special Sesame Chicken\" was the most disappointing.  While it was still good, it just didn't really differentiate itself from what I can get at Panda Express.  It came with sweet potatoes that seemed a bit of a stretch to mix with the chicken, however, still yielded a good taste.\n\nIn the end, my mouth was incredibly dry that night due to the expected overwhelming portions of MSG that were used, but I really can't knock it for that.  \n\nAs a Chinese American who loves food, I feel dirty for eating there and enjoying it.  I'm definitely going to check out Chef Jia's next door to see if I can redeem myself and support a more \"authentic\" establishment.\n\nIt's really confusing to see why there aren't more Asians in the restaurant, given the quality of the food.  My theory is that the more traditional ones get turned off by the demographic and the modern-ness of the restaurant, and as such, choose to avoid such a place.", "author": "Jeff N."}

And like that, our menus were grabbed from our hand. Asked what we wanted to drink, we simply replied, \"beer.\" A minute later, 5 green bottles of beer appeared. \n\n\"You like seafood?\" the woman barked at us again. We all nodded. \n\nWhat came next, between numerous rounds of unlabeled green-bottled beers were dishes of unbelievably good chinese cuisine. I wish I could remember what any of them were, or called, but since we didn't specifically order them, we simply dug in to each plate as it hit the table. I do remember at one point arguing over who got to lick the plate clean of the sauce a shrimp dish came in. \n\nI can't recommend Nan King enough.

Yes!\nIs there always a line? Yes!\n\nKnowing these three things, Nanking is still awesome! I mean, you don't even use a menu there. That's half the fun of eating at Nanking to begin with.

I hadn't been there since before they took down the seating counter and remodeled the place, yet the service was just as I remembered: whatever. But realizing long ago that it's nothing personal, I ordered some tea (a lovely, loose spring blend of green tea, jasmine flowers, and Chinese wolfberries), my favorite Tsing Tao Chicken and some veggie chow mein, you know, for good luck.  The server looked at me sideways when I ordered the Tsing Tao Chicken and said through narrowed eyes that had pegged me for a tourist, \"You ever order zhing-dao chicken before?\"  I told her that I had, and that it was my favorite. She shrugged, sort of smiled at me and walked off.  \n\nThis is the thing, while the Tsing-Tao is the only dish I order here, it takes some time to prepare. But it's worth the wait -- the result is velvety, thinly-sliced chicken breast and equally thin zucchini that has been marinated and cooked in the slightly sweet beer sauce. The noodles arrived shortly after the chicken, and were the thicker, chewy variety that are wok-sauteed with big chunks of broccoli, onions,  and cabbage. \n\nEverything was as good as I'd remembered, and way too much food for one!  At the end of my meal I happily packed up my leftovers imaging how yummy they'd be for dinner.

Yes, you have to wait a long time in line - but such a nice line, with such interesting people - and it gives you time to gaze through the window at what other people are eating and think, \"Hm, that kind of looks like pad siu,\" which you can then attempt to order when you sit down - and be rewarded with something that isn't pad siu at all, but something else you've never had before that is *outstanding* in flavor, freshness and ingenuity.

I'm not against trendy spots, but for me there has always been a skepticism surrounding this place. What with the whole: \"I just love how they just serve you whatever and you don't even have to order!\" ... Yeah well I can think of another place where they do that: PRISON*. \n\nThe dishes are tasty, despite being sloppily prepared and presented. The sweet and sour crispy beef dish comes to mind. \n\nMy main point about Nanking has always been that this doesn't resemble any Chinese food I've ever had and I'm an honest to goodness Chinaman. See when Chinese food comes up, us Asians like to say that because we know a little bit about it. I grew up eating bizarre foods that would evoke looks of absolute terror from my friends over for dinner. Of course, my grandparents would proceed to talk smack, saying awful things like \"those damn ghost boys dont eat anything!\" (By the way if you are wondering if those Chinese guys at the corner store are talking about you, they are. )\n\nMy Chef Grandpa even had quasi-fusion phase, featuring such groundbreaking dishes as \"hot dog fried rice\" (sometimes even \"vienna sausage fried rice\" when funds weren't tight) and \"breaded chicken cutlet with ketchup sauce\". Still, I feel that those experiments were more catered to the Asian palate than the dishes at Nanking.\n\nBut on to the good things: I did enjoy their \"tea with all the floaties in it\"... whatever it's called. I also sorta liked the chaotic atmosphere, with the rowdy groups of twenty-somethings merrily gulping down overpriced Tsingtao, the budweiser of China. \n\nBut who am I to talk. I speak caveman-grammar Cantonese and drive a Ford car. I got D's in Math 53 and 55. I must be the worst Chinaman ever.\n\n*to be perfectly fair, you can ignore the draconian owner's suggestions if you want.", "author": "Vic W."}

Really bad service, the dishes (ALL 5 dishes we ordered) had the same mix of veggies (zucchini, peas, onion, garlic and little tomatoes and carrots) and most of them also had the same kind of \"crisps\" as a way to create volume.  It was a great disappointment because we had to return 3 dishes out of 5 and the \"mom\" (owner now) came to yell at me that I had to paid even if we returned them but I was not the only table complaining so she agreed that we paid only for what we consumed.  The wine came from a box, the soups from a can and the lettuce wraps came with one 3 half leaves.  \nIt is very sad to see this place going down the drain in such short period (we found that the last time our meals were the best ever as always, was about 1.5 yrs ago).

It is about the food, and continued excellence.  Whenever I am in New York or San Francisco, I immediately think of Chinatown, and certain restaurants come to mind.  In New York--the Port Arthur, Hop Lee, and Wo Hop.  In San Francisco I think of House of Nanking, and R&G Lounge.  I truly had a different experience last night.  House of Nanking has been truly adventurous with their menu, and has really created a new cleaner atmosphere unlike the traditional Chinatown restaurants.  A new sign, decor, tables, chairs, waitresses in uniform, and an open kitchen--can you imagine.  I had the wonton soup with sizzling rice.  It had a little punch to it.  The green tea is like a good home remedy.  My grandmother used to give me a small cup of tea like this when I was sick.  She told me I could only drink that much and no more.  It always did the trick, but who knows what was in it?  I also followed my waitresses recommendation and had the fish.  It was deep fried with a spicy sauce and served with some lightly oiled spinach and garlic.  It was wonderful.  I readily admit that I miss the old school metal pots, and their Nanking dishes, and congee style soups.  As I sat their I saw the celebrity pics on the wall including Rachel Ray, and Anthony Bourdain.  I do miss many of this restaurants old dishes, but noticed the many college students eating lettuce wraps, and mu shu chicken with apple slices!  The raved about their food.  We even had very friendly, customer service oriented waitresses.  Imagine that in Chinatown--I am still stunned.  Part of the reason I am giving this restaurant 5 stars is that they have done change well even for an old school diehard like me.  I do miss the old dishes, but these are obviously healthier dishes, with less salt, etc.  We are in California!  I hope Wo Hop and Hop Lee in New York never change, but if they do I hope they do it like the House of Nanking!  I was very satisfied and full from my meal, but not tired and sluggish.

The wait was abnormally long for no reason (had called to make reservations but that was a fail), the service was terrible (rude, no water refills, mistakingly not bringing enough plates or silverware and us having to ask 3 times before getting them). A couple of us ordered the one shrimp dish on their menu, and it was literally terrible and I didn't finish mine. I'm not a picky eater at all.

After looking at him a little like 'uh, we don't know' he took our menus and said 'I choose, you like' or something like that... so we kind of hoped for the best (how bad could it be?) and said ok (not that at that point we had any choice, owner man was gone). It was fabulous! Chicken, beef, shrimp, some fried wonton appetizer things, mushrooms, rice, noodles, mooshoo stuff (my friend called them fajitas - she's so cute! wink), flower tea... about $80 after we were done. Kind of pricey, but so GOOD!! \n\nThe only thing that was confusing was when we gave them our Visa card, the girl said 'cash'... like they don't take Visa? So we gave cash, but do they take credit cards?? Weird. I guess it was a good thing we had cash... sometimes I only go out with plastic money. But they take Visa, do they? Does anyone know?? They must... I just cannot imagine... \n\nI have some more friends coming up from So Cal in a few weeks and we plan to go here to try it again, make sure it was not a fluke. They are much pickier than the other group, so we shall see. ;o) I would recommend this place to anyone wanting some good Chinese food in SF.

With that said we let the \"locals\" order for us. \n\nTo start we had spring rolls, a shrimp \"quesadilla\" (lol! I can't recall the name of it!) and mushu pork. All delicious! The spring rolls I believe had pork and eggplant (?) and were served with a tangy sweet and sour sauce. The shrimp dish had a wonton type exterior with shrimp and veggies in side. Light, crispy and flavorful! The mushu pork was a bit different than what I'm accustomed. I've had mushu and most often it's shredded pork and veggies. At Nanking it was sliced pork (mostly lean but some fat...ew!) and large slices of a veggie I can only liken to a cucumber. It looked like sliced green apple but tasted like a cross between a cucumber and onion. I'm not exactly sure what it was but it was good! \n\nFor our main course we had the crackling beef and sesame chicken. While I didn't partake in the beef (I just don't care much for beef in chinese restaurants, so often it's not cooked well done enough for me and I find it to be a bit chewy) the sesame chicken was quite good! Lightly battered and served with sliced sweet potatoes in a slightly spicy and sweet sauce. DELISH! My favorite dish of the lunch choices!\n\nI also just had to mention their tea. I didn't order the tea but there was a woman sitting next to us that did. It arrived with a lump of green tea leaves bundled together in a glass cup with hot water. Within a few minutes it bloomed into a mini garden in her cup! It looked too beautiful to drink! \n\nOverall the food was well seasoned, flavorful, not greasy and served in nice generous portions. The service was prompt and efficient. Not very friendly and hardly personable but not rude or discourteous. \n\nThe food was quite good and there are other dishes I would love to try!", "author": "Syd M."}

I drove up to San Francisco this past weekend and got to try this restaurant.  I left the sunny L.A. weather, stood in a long line in freezing, foggy, windy conditions, to go inside and be seated on chairs that did indeed resemble lawn chairs.  We were practically sharing a table with a couple we had never met before, the manager did order for us, and still I LOVED THE FOOD! and I had a great time.\nI have to admit the three of us who went thought it weird and were somewhat speechless when the manager asked if it was our first time there and then asked for the menus back.  He said, \"I'll take care of you, I'm chef,\" but he did ask what type of dishes we wanted.  Being the picky eater that I am, I managed to blurt out, \"just no seafood or pork please.\" He repeated it, \"no seafood or pork, ok, I'll take care of you.\"  The server came back with Sesame Chicken, Crispy Beef, and what I'm guessing was the vegetable chowmein.  The food was absolutely the best \"chinese\" food I've ever had.  I don't know how authentic it is, but I really don't care.  It was good, it was different, I had no complaints, and if I make that trip again I will definitely stand in line one more time.", "author": "Monica G."}

I heard about it from locals who said, \"Just go to where you see the line.\" Walking through Chinatown, I was suspicious of the places that had someone on the street begging you to come into a particular restaurant. If you're good, you don't need to beg for business.\n\nLIke you read in other reviews, the service is awful--no genteel Chinese Mr. and Mrs. welcoming you into their fold. After waiting 30 minutes, I was seated at a nice table when suddenly I was evicted and told to sit next to four guys who had been ahead of me in line. I could tell they really didn't want to make friends, even for an hour, but when I asked the girl, \"Do I really have to move?\" I was told, \"YES.\" So I had this awkward situation of sitting with four guys in town for the same event as I but trying to pretend like I was at a single table.\n\nBack to the food. If you are looking for \"something for everyone\" like you see in every other Chinese place, forget it. What I had was fantastic. I started with the pork egg roll. Believe me, after eating a roll packed with nothing but shredded pork (tasted barbecued), I'll never go back to the standard number filled with cabbage and mysterious ground meat.\n\nThen I had the moo shoo with shrimp. The shrimp were pan fried in a coating with ginger; I was trying to stay away from fried food but this was too good and not at all \"fried-like.\"  I didn't really waste time on rolling into the Chinese pancakes because the shrimp and zucchini, which comprised most of the vegetables, were so good.\n\nI did hear another table complain about the salt. My dish didn't have any MSG and was not overly salty or I might be writing a different review. The service? They kept forgetting my drink.\n\nBut I can't wait to go back and experience the great food and surly service.", "author": "John Divine M."}

Fresh vegetables, generous portions, and a unique atmosphere for such a hole in the wall type locale.  One of my personal favorite Chinese restaurants in the city (or anywhere for that matter).\n\nAs to the service: it can be pretty bad if you aren't willing to let them select your entrees.

On another occasion the waiter walked away as if we offended him when we told him we wanted to order our own dishes.

No, not really, but here it is! \n\nBack in the day, when I was eight, a kind man took my family here for some of the best Chinese food of my life. The dumplings were outrageous, each dish kindly and thoughtfully prepared. For years and years no one could remember the name. Then one day, when searching the internet tirelessly, it appeared, as if from a distant dream land. \n\nAnd so the mystery spot of legendary food had a name, and it was Nanking, and for a couple of years after this finding, it was great. Sure the line was always present, and sure, the owner/executive chef is weird and kind of mean, and sure, they rush you through your food so they can sit the next patron down, but the food was SO GOOD. \n\nThen, one day, the house changed. They added new dishes, changed up aspects of their older ones, and it was good. But then we came back, and ordered different dishes, but they came out as the exact same ones we had ordered the last time we were there. We thought there was a mistake, but no, the waiter insisted, these were the correct dishes. \n\nNow I don't know about you, but if I want a particular dish, I'll ask for it.

I think calling it the House of Nanking implies that they serve Chinese food, given that Nanking is, indeed, in China.  I think a name such as House of Newark, NJ or House of Naperville, IL might be more indicative of their food.\n\nSure, they have the same rude service and the same folding brown tables as you would find at similar hole-in-the-wall Chinese establishments.

When we asked for water with our meals, the waitress begrudgingly brought out two glasses (in chipped plastic glasses) of water. We had to ask for two more since there were 4 of us. She also did not bring ice despite our request for ice water. The food, from what I remember, was OK but nothing spectacular. It was the service that really turned me off and I vowed never to go back. \n\nWell, I'm back in SF and I must say, my decision to never go back to HON was a good one. I've tried many more Chinese restaurants in the area, none with a wait, all with great food. I went to 'Fang,' sister restaurant to HON, close to the Convention Center . That was a disappointing meal also. \n\nSo, to all the people standing in line to eat at House of Nanking, GET A LIFE! There are lots of great Chinese restaurants in San Francisco's Chinatown. Try the one next door. You won't be disappointed AND you'll be seated immediately.", "author": "Maria A."}

No water. Dishes and flatware arrive in a pile.  They really do scrunch you together with strangers, and sprint away immediately after sliding undescribed platters across your table.

Service is kind of surly, but mainly because they are moving very quickly.  Not the kind of place to just go and linger comfortably.  The food came out very quick and overall was pretty good.  The sizzling rice soup was unlike any I have ever had, as it was almost creamy and seemed like it had coconut milk.  It was spicy and flavorful, and we enjoyed it throughly.  The calamari was good, although I found it a little lacking in flavor.  The green beans were firm and crisp and tasty, so we enjoyed those.  The shrimp with mushrooms was very good, although it was very salty.  We enjoy salt, so we did not mind, but it was still almost too salty.  This was the same with the soup, so they seem to use a lot of salt here.  The dishes are different from your \"standard\" Chinese restaurant fare, where you get many of the same dishes in the same way.  Nanking definitely seems to be more of a creative restaurant in their cuisine, as opposed to a regular run of the mill Chinese food joint, where the food is more or less recognizable and similar.

I've only been here once nd we didn't order from the menu because my friend just told the owner to bring out whatever. So it's gonna be hard to review this place since I had no idea what I was eating. But here it goes...we started with a seafood soup which was really good...then we got some root vegetable thing which was my favorite dish....then we got the nanking chicken dish (i only know what this is from reading other reviews) the sweet potatoes were sooo good and the chicken was good too. our last dish was calamari which was interesting...my friends liked it but it wasn't my thing cuz it tasted like tempura and i hate tempura (yes that's very non-asian of me).\n\nSo here is my poor review of this place. I wish I had known what we ordered!. I wouldn't ever think of coming to this place again but I'm not gonna object if my friends want to go.\n\nOh and whoever says to go to San Tung instead is way off because San Tung isn't authentic Chinese food...it's Chinese-Korean.", "author": "Jenn S."}

The hot and sour soup is definitely the best I've ever had anywhere and as far as the rest of the menu I can't say I've ever gotten a bad meal here and I've come here for many, many years. I don't care about atmosphere so I'm ok with the decor and ambient noise, but I do care about food and this place is amazing in the wonderful food they produce in a very short time. Well worth the wait even if there is a line. Excellent!\n\nHint: Get a room in the Hilton across the street on the side Nanking is on.

I wouldn't consider the food regular Americanized or authentic Chinese food.  It's got it's own thing going on-- very tasty, lots of salt, spices and seasoning, and definitely on the heavy side.  This may sound like your typical American-Chinese food, but the tastes are different.   \n\nYou'll need to go at off hours or be prepared for a long wait.  The place isn't big, but it does turnover fast and they squeeze as many people as possible into the area they have.  The owner likes to order for you and he'll definitely pick out a good meal for you.  The down side to this is that if you have favorites that he doesn't like to pair together, you kind of need to argue with him to get what you want.  I'm willing to fight it out, others find it intimidating, personal preference I guess.\n\nI really like the tofu here, any style is good.  Also, the Nanking chicken or shrimps are delicious-- heavy, greasy and delicious... and they come with sweet potatoes, smothered in that same delicious sauce.  The tea is actually pretty good too.  It's got lots of floating stuff in it.\n\nIf you're here for a visit or you live here and just never make it over to North Beach, I think Nanking is worth a stop.  The only caveat is don't come here expecting real deal Chinese food.  Also, I would only come here when you've got a big appetite.  It's not the kind of place for light fare or a little snack.", "author": "Zach J."}

If you are looking for an authentic China Town culinary experience in San Francisco, this is as good as it gets.  Notice I said China Town experience, not Chinese experience.  You'll pass streets lined with empty Chinese Restaurants before stumbling upon the line of hungry locals that habitually inhabit the sidewalk in front of the restaurant (Read as: be prepared to wait). This excellent food, that the uninitiated may not even fathom is available stateside, is a treat for the palate not to be missed.  If you come in on a late afternoon or early evening, you may even be greeted by the owner and head chef (who's photos line the walls).  If you're feeling adventurous, let him know that this is your first time (whether it is or not), and he'll select food pairings for you.  \n\nBe warned, although House of Nanking has expanded, table space is tight and you will share what feels like an Elementary School cafeteria table with other diners.  Also, if not allowing the chef to select your entrees, have your order ready including any side items or beverages, as you may not see your server again during the meal.  Service is short and demanding, but efficient.  \n\nHot tea is the beverage of choice (unless you feel inclined to try some Kikoman plum wine), and I highly recommend anything with their excellent peanut sauce including the Green Onion Pancakes or Egg Rolls.  Don't expect any of the homogenized western style fair that you will find at Nanking's lesser counterparts... this is a unique take on Chinese that feels like what \"fusion\" should be, but rarely is.\n\nHappy Eating!", "author": "Katie H."}

There was a long queue outside the restaurant, but after having read all the reviews on yelp, I was not surprised. In fact, given that the judges' stand for the parade was right outside its entrance, I was actually expecting the queue to be longer! We had to wait for about 20 mins to get a table. \n\nWe ordered the following:\n\n- Sizzling rice soup: This was by far the BEST chinese soup I've ever had! It was everything that one needs when its 40 degrees outside - hotttt (yes, as expected, I burnt my mouth), tangy, flavorful and spicy (we'd asked for that). The veggies in the soup were all fresh and the rice was nice and crispy! The portion was large enough for two of us to share. I am definitely ordering this the next time I go, and the next, and the next! \n\n- Onion pancakes: Very crusty, with a yummy sauce drizzled over it. Must try! \n\n- Nanking sesame chicken: after reading all the rave reviews about this dish (and noticing both the tables on either side of us order the same thing), I must say that I was a little disappointed. Although the chicken was tender, it was not very crispy and the sauce was too sweet for my taste - I don't think I'll order that dish agian. However, I must say that the sweet potatoes on the side were delicious!\n\n- Fried Tofu in black bean (or was it BBQ?) sauce: Now this was a pleasant surprise! The tofu was very well done, and the sauce hit the right spot - very flavorful with a slight tangy twist. Went well with steamed rice. \n\nIn short, this is definitely my new favorite chinese restaurant. I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!", "author": "Priyanka G."}

You're finally seated and the waiters treat you a little rough, but you like it.  You look at the menu, perhaps out of habit, or maybe to keep it civilized for just a moment longer, but you know you're going to get what they give you, and like it.  Then, all of a sudden, it's on.  A pummelling of sensations.  The most amazing tastes coming at ya, seemingly endless, and in no particular order.  You can't get enough.  You're completely seduced by the dumplings, the bao bing.  It's hawt.  But then something in the frenetic kitchen catches your eye.  Ooh, you'd rather not see.  You want to preserve the mystery.  You don't even care what's really in the sesame chicken.  Then, as abrubtly as it started, it's over.  Like literally 20 minutes later, you find yourself back out on the sidewalk, a little dazed, unsteady.  Just like that.  You feel cheap and uncomfortable...but you know you'll be back.  For the bao bing.  You will.  \n\nOk, but this time, no bang from the bao bing!  Total disappointment.  Where's that sauce?

Anyways, the food was fine.\n\nWhat really killed it for me was the service, or lack thereof... Had I been in a hurry, I might have actually been upset. I waited at least 20 minutes between finishing my meal and getting my check... It might not have been so bad if I had a friend along to chat to, or something else to enjoy my time with, but no... I could only stare out the window and watch everyone else get on with their lives while I had to wait.\n\nWith the tip, my dinner came out to $15, which I felt might have been just a little more than I expected to pay, but whatever...

First thing to note, the place probably violates more than one health code.  Seeing the long line gave me some hope that this place was somehow \"all that\".  But it wasn't.  The food was decent.  However the person in charge who claimed to be a chef, but was not cooking at all, wanted to order for us.  He claimed to want to make us special dishes.  We were a little sceptical but went along with it telling him some prefrences.  Then the food came out in waves, soup, then 3 entrees.  I specifically told him no hot spice, only mild.  Well the soup was somewhat spicy but tolerable and one of the fish dishes was also tolerable but a bit spicy.  He bragged about the squid, but it was just ok, a bit overly lemony if you ask me.  I do really recommend the green tea though.  Very nice flavor.\n\nThe real kicker was when the bill came.  We happened to wonder where he came up with the prices for all of the entrees.  He said that none of the dishe were on the menu.  Where he came up with the prices is beyond me.  And of course the prices were higher than similar items that we saw on the menu.\n\nMy guess is that he was either trying to hurry us up or trying to get rid of the food that the restaurant had an excess of.  Either way the seemingly special treatment ended up coming across as shady instead.\n\nAnd by the way, we noticed that many people were given the same \"special dishes\" that we were given.\n\nService was speedy but not anything special.  \n\nThe menus are pathetic.  I have seen nicer menus from children selling lemonade on the corner.  I think with all the revenue that they bring in that they could have something that borders on professional.\n\nWould I eat here again?

Went again with a friend last night.  \n\nFirst, I have read many reviews that complain about the food's lack of Chinese authenticity.  Get over it.  Chinese authenticity is NOT what House of Nanking is about.  It's about great food.  Also many, many SF and surrounding community residents eat here.  It's definitely not a 'tourist trap.'  While tourists eat at Nanking as well (don't know if it still is as I haven't looked but Nanking used to be on Michael Bauer's 100 Best Restaurants list) a lot of locals eat at Nanking.  Tourists read Zagat's, yelp, etc. so they come.  Plus people like me recommend the restaurant.   I do miss the old detailed menu and unless I missed it, didn't see a shrimp dish on the latest two page flip-over (scallops though), they did make my old fave Chicken in Beer Sauce.  The old dish used thin slices of tender chicken and the sauce was more subtle than what we ate last night however last night's dish was quite good.  Not as subtle a sauce & small chunks of chicken rather than thin slices.   I'm fair & honest so have to write it is not as good  as it used to be.  (Put it back on the menu and make it the old way please.)  The beef dish, Crackling was I recall (?) was very good as were the pork dumplings.  Hmmm...  \n\nI have been eating at Hunan, Brandy Ho's, R & G and all the other great Chinese restaurants in and around SF for years.  Hong Kong Flower Lounge in Millbrae including the original many many years ago when it was a simple storefront but the food was fantastic.  I go to House of Nanking when I want their food, a unique blend of Asian and American cooking with a touch of other influences.  So screw that unauthentic criticism.  I know it's not authentic and do go to 'more authentic' Chinese restaurants like those named above that I really enjoy but House of Nanking is still excellent and last night's service was fine, Sat.  night line out the door when we arrived around 8:00 p.m.  Again, some tourists but many locals.

The staff, however, will swoop in when its time to pay.  This is a shame given the restaurant's ability to attract tourists.  It is indeed evident from many of the reviews here that many of them were disappointed.  You might get lucky and get the owner in a good mood.  In that case, all you have to do is sit and he'll use his discretion and bring you dishes that you will love.  That happened the first time I came.

I am totally a sucker for Chinese food, however I hate cheap shitty steam table chinese food. This place, however, I would not even describe as chinese food, I would describe it as a fucking experience. My friend Jimmy got me all hyped up about it before we even got there with tales of no menus and a wait staff comparable to the soup nazi episode of Seinfeld. They come to your table and ask you what type of meat you like, and you tell them. Then they ask if you're hungry, you say yes, and they say okay. \n\nThen magically plates of food start appearing family style for the table. Course by course, surprise after surprise, fantasticalness after fantasticalness. We started out with THE MOST DELICIOUS, LIGHTLY FRIED CALAMARI i have ever had. It was literally like pleasure in my mouth. Next came out some paper wrapped shrimp and pea quesdillas with a mango chile sauce on top, also very good and some chilled bok choy in a vinegarettey sauce. I've never had bok choy chilled before but I could have lived without this, you know I love my meats. So, then came out some bbq beef chinese \"burritos\" put together table side, also a favorite of the meal for me. This meat was moist and tasty and paired with excellent veggies and a finger lickin' chinese sauce all wrapped up in a hot tortilla, yum. Then there was some delicious chicken and sweet potatoes that both somehow stayed crunchy even though every morsel was engulfed in sauce. Then there was whitefish steamed to perfection with a glaze and a grip of fresh spinach on top, another favorite of the meal for me. After deciding we were all stuffed but still wanted to try more delicious concoctions we ordered mongolian beef atop crunchy noodles, oh my gawd so good and so flavorful. I know what you're thinking, god this girl is a fatty, but there were eight of us at the table and all this wonderfulness was only about 20 bucks a person.....with tip!!! Crazy! I would go back and order any of the things we got for lunch again, but I would also love to go back and do the whole thing again, over and over and over. \n\nThey also have Tsingtao beer for three bucks and massively giant mugs of water, we're talking bigger than your head mugs, i assume because they don't want to have to refill them, but comical nonetheless. But I hear the wait can be extraordinary so watch out! We had basically no wait since apparently everyone in the city was at Burning Man, yay for us! \n\nP.s.

The service was good and the food was great! The second time I went was a huge disappointment!  I went with my parents, sister and her baby, and my Uncle.  The waitress had horrible customer service skills and acted like the Soup Nazi \nfrom Seinfeld.  After we made our order she was like 'That's it!  That's not enough! You need to order another dish!'  We actually ordered another dish after her tone of voice.\n\nAfter waiting a long while, we noticed they didn't bring us our drinks, which was mostly water for our table.  We waited patiently and didn't press for it until it became evident that they were not going to bring us any water.  We kept asking, and the other waiter would quickly walk by our table and mumble that he was busy right now.  A complete lack of respect and lack of customer service. We asked several times and no water.  Finally they gave us our water. And finally we were given our bowl of soup, soup bowls and soup spoons.  They gave us one less soup bowl and one less soup spoon.  After asking for the additional soup bowl and soup spoon, they gave us the soup bowl, but no soup spoon.  Mind you, every time they gave us something, they would quickly run off to do something else.  They never gave our table any attention.  After asking several times for a soup spoon, after the fourth or fifth time, the waiter lost his cool with us, grabbed 10 silver spoons and THREW THEM ON OUR TABLE!  We about had it after that! \nMy sister while holding the baby got up and told the waitress who originally waited on our table and they were going back and forth arguing.  I then told the waitress, we want our check for what we ate, we are leaving.  We are not happy with the service.  She then got all apologetic and said no the food is coming, sorry we are busy, and not enough workers. \n\nShe then yelled at the waiter in her language.  She ignored my request for the check and later brough out the main dishes.  I told her no, I told you we want our check for what we paid for and we are leaving.  I had to say this 3 - 4 times before she would give us the check! \n\nI noticed a sign in the restaurant of a new branch of theirs that opened somewhere else.  I'm assuming that is where the owner was, since he was not at the restaurant when we  were there.  That is too bad that the restaurant we were at was failing in all areas.  It's not worth it to keep the minimum amount of workers on hand to save money (my assumption).\n\nThe food that we had wasn't even good. \n\nHonestly, I have never been so disrespected in my life.  I will never go back and will tell people to avoid this restaurant.", "author": "Lina H."}

They use udon noodles and basil and it is SOO good it makes my mouth water just thinking of it.  Their lettuce wraps are yummy also, although they do not give you any red bean paste to put on the wrap.

I like the tea, but $3 for tea?!?\nThe portions are much smaller than they used to be.

Anyhow, as the clock inched toward 5 o'clock one day, he listed off three of his favorite Chinese food spots in the city. In third place was the Inner Richmond's Taiwan Restaurant, the second was House of Nanking and the first he promised to take me to once we were both working the FiDi. So I headed off to both this past weekend to really test his ability at naming some of the best places to eat in The City.\n\nThe menu was straight forward. It was busy considering it was a Friday at 1:45 p.m., late for lunch and too early for dinner and the service was slow, although I didn't mind because I highly enjoyed the people watching.\n\nMy companion and I ordered the sesame chicken and told the owner we had an affinity for shrimp and scallops and he made a few notes and put the order in. We daringly ordered the flower tea, a loose leaf tea shoveled into glass mugs and covered with steaming water.\n\nThe vegetables that came along with each entree were fresh and a nice addition to typical totally unhealthy Chinese food, the Nanking sauce on each dish finger lickin' good and the flower tea had spectacular flavor but should have required a straw to get to the actual liquid and beyond the mulch.\n\nMy favorite part of the experience, the open air windows and seating and calling out to my trusted friend and colleague Alan as he strolled by, Chronicle sports section underarm, I made sure to tell him that it was a GREAT recommendation.", "author": "Jenny T."}

This place was an epic fail. Do not go at all costs. The waitress/possibly owner/ family member decided that since we had never been there before she would just make the best dishes she knew. Unfortunately except for the calamari which was really nice everything else was really poor. Even their chicken which was the house special was lacking any major taste. Service was awful and they began collecting our plates before we had finished eating and had food still on them. Worst of all they started counting their tip in front of us as soon as we had left the money in the folder. In my opinion avoid at any cost as this place has nothing going for it.

My friends were absolutely right, and I loved it.  It's all part of the charm.\n\nAfter working our way through the tables and making at least two people get up so we could slide through, we joined several other couples at one long table.  Two warm waters, no ice, slice of lemon appeared (the charm, again).  Kathryn F. tried the plum wine, which was surprisingly good.  \n\nWe saw so much incredible looking food around us, so for our \"reverse\" ordering strategy, we picked a few we liked and turned to the menu for deciphering.  We settled on the pork pot stickers with peanut sauce, beef fried rice, and Nanking's Famous Sesame Chicken (which should, whenever possible, be ordered using its full title).  There's a certain predictability to Chinese food which was turned delightfully upside-down by our dinner.  The pork pot stickers were perfectly crispy, and the spicy peanut sauce was to die for.  The sesame chicken... forgive me, \"Nanking's Famous Sesame Chicken\", was not too sweet and had a wonderfully savory flavor, and was served with thinly sliced fried sweet potatoes.  Different, but excellent.  The real winner, though, was the beef fried rice.  It was so perfectly moist, and almost indescribably fresh; they took all the standard ingredients, added zucchini and red onions , and brought it out in minutes!  Bravo.  \n\nI have a feeling this is the place that no matter what you get, it will be amazing.  It sure was for me.

Two years ago I took my father-in-law there boasting about how good the food was. That was the first time in many years that I had been there. Much to my surprise I found that the quality of the food was not as good as it had been in years past. The service was just as bad as it always was but I was really disappointed in the food. (Waiters have always been rude) Yesterday I decided to take two of my friends there. Once again I told them how wonderful the food was. Well, I was extremely disappointed. The service was just as horrible as it has always been but the food was not good. It was edible but not even as good as it was a couple of years ago. The sweet potatoes were sliced paper-thin and had no taste, the sesame chicken was so sweet it was almost inedible after the first few bites. It is one thing to have bad service with rude waiters but when you combine that with mediocre quality food it is no longer acceptable to me. I will no longer be singing the praises of Peter Fang's House of Nanking.  Like so many other things we see happening in this country, quality and customer care is on its way out.

I actually felt some animosity towards us because we weren't giving her our order fast enough. The food arrived very fast in quickfire succession--so quickly that we couldn't even pace ourselves. We felt rushed like we had to eat in a hurry and get out as quickly as possible. The food was nothing even close to what I was expecting--really really bland and unexciting. The pot stickers were hard. The fried pork egg rolls tasted bizarre. The Bao Bing wrap had gristle in it--the wrap was so thin you couldn't even hold it together without it completely falling apart in your hands.

The rice was not bad, but the sesame chicken was great.  It came with some sweet potato chips in the sauce and they were good too.   The chicken was slightly crunchy but not burnt at all, and the sauce was reaaal good.  The dish was a hit with us.\n\nThe place itself was kind of small and seating was tight, but you get over it quick.  The service was not rude, but not super friendly either, which is ok because sometimes I just want to eat and not chit chat.  \n\nThe 2 dishes, a glass of water, and a drink was around $22 and some change.\n\nI would go again if I lived in the area.", "author": "eddy r."}

He then said, \"Is anybody allergic to anything or have a special diets?\"  We one vegitarian at the table who raised her hand and said \"Veggie\".  \nThen he said \"I know what you want....\" and walked back to the kitchen.  The first plate arrived, then the second plate, third plate, fourth plate, fifth plate.... It was crazy!  The food was AWESOME!  I don't even remember what I had but it was great!  \nBy the time the eighth or ninth plate came out we had to tell the server to stop bringing us food.  We got the bill and it was a little bit over $120, (granted this was 10 years ago and I'm just getting around to reviewing it now), but 8 people happily fed for $120?  Yes!\nI lived in Canada at the time and all of us were tourists so the owner came out and took a picture under the sign with us.  \nGreat Experience!\nThe next time I went was with my sister in the middle of the afternoon.  Service was short and blunt, but the food was incredibly tastey!  Quick word of warning, if you're looking for authentic Chinese food you're going to the wrong place.

I used to live in Chinatown and so this was always my go to place when I got hungry.\n\nI would have taken a star off because their prices went up after they remodeled the place (the place used to be a hole in the wall with plastic tumblers and mismatched bowls and plates).  Now each dish is about $1.50-$2.00 their original prices but I still think fairly reasonable for good Chinese food. \n\nI'm a big fan of their Sesame Chicken, the Fried Wontons, and the Eggplant scallops.  Typically they give you a big mug of hot tea/water for free (so no need to order it off the menu!) to wash down all the oil.  \n\nThe best time to go is during the weekdays at non-traditional meal hours since this place ALWAYS has lines out the door at night.  If you have a small party, you're probably going to get stuck sharing a table with another party...so this is certainly not the best first date sorta place.  It sucks that they don't have a waiting area because outside of the restaurant smells like garbage/sewer.  Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes if they tell you 10-15 minutes.

What more can you ask for in a Chinese Cuisine? The wait is a bit long at times but that should be a clear indicator of how good the food is.\n\nThe first few times I went I would order the Nanking Sesame Chicken because my friend recommended it. But after being brave and allowing the owner to come over and make up the menu for us. I'm pretty sure that everything on the menu is a winner.\n\nIf you ever go to House of Nanking and don't know what to order. Just leave it up to the owner. He'll ask you for your preference of meats and whether you want veges or soup and make up a combination of items to satisfy your hunger.\n\nFor being asian he often asks if I'm korean or chinese. At first I wasn't sure what he was doing by asking this question but soon I realized that he knew the different palettes of asians. How korean people tend to consume their foods on the spicier side. Hence dishes like kimchi soup and kimchi. So our dishes come our a little spicier then usual.\n\nIf you're looking for a good eatery to take your friends on a night out in the city I highly recommend this place. The location is nice. it is right across from Niebaum Coppola Cafe. Which used or maybe still is where the American Zoetrope offices resided for Francis Ford Coppola's press company. There they serve all the different wines available from the winery/vineyard.\n\nColumbus street is also near by so you could head over to Steps of Rome for some good desserts afterwards.\n\nI would've given House of Nanking 5 stars but I didn't because of the constant waits at time. Wait to get in. Wait to order. Wait to get the check. The place is also a bit crowded so for those of you who are a bit claustrophobic should hope you don't get a seat in the corner.", "author": "Michael L."}

The food is so tasty and perfectly balanced that it's hard to stop, even when I'm absolutely stuffed. \nThere can be an amusement style line doubled back on itself out the door but their turnover is pretty good and even a big line can go quickly.

We ordered the sesame chicken with sweet potatoes and the house noodles. The house noodles were very different from anything I've ever tried at any Chinese or Asian restaurant. Very delicious! Not your typical fried noodles which was nice. The sesame chicken was amazing. It has the perfect amount of sauce and the sweet potatoes are such a nice touch. I also had the flower tea.

We have never been to a restaurant with a service that was as bad and unattentive as in the House of Nanking. The waiter didn't exchange a single word with us or even looked at us, he just smashed the plates down on our table and went off. \nBut what annoyed us most was the following: I ordered a meal with calamares which was praised as \"highly recommendable\" and my husband ordered the \"Famous Nanking Chicken\". After some time, the waiter arrived, and, without any comment, put down a plate which, judging from its small size, looked like a on-the-house-treat to us. About ten minutes later, another plate arrived (apparently my husband's, but as the waiter hadn't said anything and had darted off at once, we could only judge from its appearance), but we were still waiting for mine. So, we asked very nicely where my dinner was. An EXTREMELY UNFRIENDLY waitress (or was it the boss??) seemed to be affronted by this question and started to shout at us that the tiny dish we had got 10 minutes before the other had actually been my dinner and that we shouldn't complain about not getting our dinner at the same time!!! WTF?! Normally, you go out to dinner to eat at the same time, don't you? Still, this woman was throwing her tantrum and swearing at us at full volume until all the guests around us were looking at us. But it was not only us that were treated like that. Other guests were also shouted at or bossed around by this woman.\nWe have never been treated like that and left hungry, very disgruntled and without a tip (the first time ever).\nOur conclusion: NEVER AGAIN!!!\n\nOne sentence regarding the food: It was okay, but not better than the dishes you get in average Chinese restaurants (where the service surely cannot be as bad as in the House of Nanking).", "author": "Sarah R."}

Mother China would've be ashamed that such a restaurant actually exists!\n\nAt first glance, it seems like a decent Chinese restaurant with long lines and excited foreigners eagerly awaiting to be seated. Once you stepped through the door, you'll be welcomed by the thought of spending the next hour in an uncomfortable, crowded, and germ-infested environment, in addition to sitting side by side with strangers. A visit to the bathroom is like a visit to the sewers. The servers use the same pair of hands to serve your food, mop the floor, bus the table, and handle cash transactions.  -2 stars\n\nNow the food:\nI ordered the Shanghai Rice Soup, Stir-fried Scallop w/ lettuce and Nanking Chicken (aka Sesame Chicken). The soup like a fancy version of a porridge soup heavily peppered. The Scallop dish is probably the best dish I had there, but pay $17 a dish for only 3-4 scallops at best cut at 1-2inch thick makes you wonder if this is actually worth. The nanking Chicken is simply a chicken dish double coated with sesame sauce served with unfresh eggplants that tastes like plain sweet potato covered with again the sesame sauce. Overall, I could get the same kind of dish at other Chinese restaurants nearby at half the cost. -1 for food\n\nService:\nOnce you're seated, the waiter would offer you water or tea. Since this is a Chinese place, you'd expect the tea to be complimentary. No, you pay $3 for a tea served in a pint-size cup. Rice comes at $1.50 - a dried bowl of rice that tastes like it was cooked 2 days ago. When you make your orders, the waiter would try to sell you their more expensive dishes... thanks for continuing to hustle money from me. After the meal, I took out my card ready to pay the bill and what did I get? \"Sorry CASH ONLY\" -- WTF? Their excuses? \"Credit Card is broken\". Turns out they try to make their customers pay with cash so that they can under-report their income to uncle-sam. 10 mins later, the machine magically became operable again. Thanks for making me ran 3 blocks around Chinatown looking for an ATM at 8:30pm. I expected other cheap Chinese restaurants to accept cash, but not a restaurant of this calibur! -1\n\nMy beautiful Sunday was ruined by my experience here at House of Nanking.

It was a blossoming flower tea.  Very interesting.  However,  since I was not really a tea drinker, i would have declined had I known it was not complimentary.  Anyway, an elderly gentleman came to take our order.  My husband said it's our first time and we really were not sure what to order.  The gentleman got the menus and said he'll take care of it.  We were first  served a vegetable dish ( asparagus).  We did not know what to do with it because we were not sure whether it was an appetizer or a part of the main meal.  Then we were served  a kind of mushu which was very good.  In the middle of eating the mushu and the vegetable (which was too salty for my taste), a bowl of rice was served.  So we started eating our vegetable with the rice.  When the elderly gentleman passed by, we asked if that was it, he said more to come.  True enough, we were served soup which was also good.  Then they brought  a dish of fried squid and fish, and finally a dish of fried shrimp with mushroom.  Overall, I thought the food was okay but it was nothing great.  On hindsight, we should have ordered ourselves had I known our bill would reach almost $80 excluding tip.  I don't think I'd be back there....at least not in the near future.", "author": "Janice T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-09-04", "description": "I've only eaten here once and I keep meaning to give it another shot, but why?\n\nFirst off, it breaks one of my many Restaurant Rules of Engagement: If no patrons are of the ethnicity of the food being served, more than likely it's not going to be authentic or good. So I ignored that rule (I walk past this place every day and never see anyone Chinese eating here), because it's the House of Mudderfuggin' Nanking yo! I mean seriously, there's so much hype, I have to go just to see exactly what is generating that hype. I ate there and I still don't know.\n\n  Clearly, if you read the reviews posted in the window and on the walls, back in the day it was an awesome find because A) it wasn't just another place serving the same Chinese-American dishes as everyone else and B) it was freakin' crazy cheap. I mean like $2.95 for an entree kinda cheap. Yeah, if I was paying $5 for dinner including tip I'd be hyping the living crap out of this place too! Even without the financial factor, it's not even close to being great. There's no point talking about the cheap tables and chairs, the apathetic waitstaff who are numb from the cacophony of tourists and yuppies pounding down on them during nearly every minute of the day and night.\n\nI told the waitress that I wanted what they would consider to be their best pork dish and if it was spicy all the better. She said their best pork dish was \"pork with mushrooms\" and that it was not spicy. Ok, fair enough.\nAnyway, I got the dish and it was slices of pork seasoned with what seemed to be a combination of Lowrey's seasoning salt, MSG and imitation butter seasoning tossed in a wok with some mushrooms and onions. That's it. No sauce, no peppers, no garlic, just the naked ingredients on a plate with a side of steamed rice.\nDon't get me wrong, I am not one of those Panda Express people who want their Chinese-esque food swimming in sauce, but a good sauce that clings to the ingredients is not only authentic, but adds depth, complexity and moisture to a dish and is a good test of any cooks skills. Not here, just some artificial flavoring agent and that's it! Then again, I should be greatful that I wasn't subjected to some abhorrent, sickly sweet sauce that seemingly everyone in Chinatown seems to think we gweilos are crazy about.\n\nUmmm, yeah. I keep meaning to give them another shot, but when I have plenty of other more interesting, less crowded and cheaper Chinese dining options in the area, why would I want to?", "author": "Thomas S."}

Most of the reviewers criticize the service - I laughed reading one reviewer who said she couldn't find the hostess.  There is no hostess.  Not really.  There's two or three waiters running around who are also manning the line out the door (yes, there will be a line out the door).  This is not the type of establishment that's trying to win service awards.  They talk with their food.  And the food is pretty damn good.  If you can deal with no hand holding, you will love this place.\n\nWent here recently for a bachelor party.  Showed up unannounced with a group of nine hungry guys.  They said they'd work on it and had us seated within twenty minutes - speedy for this joint.  One of the owners waited on us.  Her attitude is no BS because, again, this is a BUSY restaurant.  So we said, look we're nine people, we're not finicky eaters - you bring us whatever's good and keep the Tsing Tao (their only beer option) flowing.  She did exactly that.  \n\nI couldn't tell you what we ate that night but it was all scrumptious.  I do remember a vegetarian dish made of sliced cucumbers, asparagus and sesame sauce that was awesome.  And any shrimp/seafood dish is to die for as well.  At the end of the night she brought us the check and didn't charge us for half of all the beer we consumed - about three to four beers each.  \n\nOne star off because you will ALWAYS have to wait.

In fact it seems that it is just a cut above any other good Chinese place...We get there and the place is PACKED... in fact there is a line outside the door. So we waited for about 10 minutes and were hurried in my one of the staff. There were 6 of us who had never been there before and the waitress asked us three questions:\n\n1. What do you want to drink?\n2. Have you ever been here before?\n3. How hungry are you?\n\nA little confused we answered the questions to the best of our ability. She informed us that since we had never been there before that she would \"take care of us\" and just like that she was gone... 5 min later a younger waitress brought us our drinks. We must have chatted for less than another 5 min and it started.... The first of waves of delicious courses, brought just a little faster than we could eat them. This family style Chinese place...It is a tad greasy and thick on the sauce, but yo this place is REALLY good.  Tons of animals died for my meal, and I thank them all. To be honest I am not sure what they all brought us but the duck is what I remember... I dunno it doesn't matter really because it was all delicious.\nI will be back; I would certainly go back just to bring a friend.

The owners, whom are still there every night were NEVER friendly...you just dealt with it. Even if the service was abrupt, and the tables and general environment was very dirty [can't believe I continued you go here...uhmmmmmmm, cockroaches the size of a small cat], the food was at times, very good.\nIt's the total lack of consistency that makes me give it one star. Look at the reviews here!!! This is certainly true of last night's [final] visit. The food was NASTY. To be honest, it's amazing that neither one of us got really ill. The rice had to be days old, the chicken, well, fowl, and the noodles slimy. The servers were even more gnarly than usual!\nTo give fellow readers context, I rarely if ever write poor reviews, but this visit to HON was so egregious, I was compelled to speak out. \nBeware!", "author": "Mr. S."}

There was no wait on a Sunday afternoon, but the place was packed. The tea was great, had a blossom that slowly opened and was sweet. My kids loved it. The hot and sour soup was very vinegary tasting. Too much so for the kiddies. We ordered pot stickers which were crispy, not soft, but very good. The fried rice was tasty. We ordered only one main dish, as we weren't very hungry, which was the noodle tower with chicken. It was a very good dish. I highly recommend this joint and next time I'm doing what the other yelpers have done, and have the waiter order for me, once he/she knows our preferences. Great tip.", "author": "Rene W."}

As we were staying in Union Square, with a 6mo old baby, this past Saturday  we decided to take the oh so convenient public transportation, in the chilly air of San Francisco, and a bundled up infant,just to be refused at the door.  Were they to capacity?  No. Their website says they close at 10P.  We arrived at 8:55P.  As a couple was being escorted out, I asked what time do they close? The response was \"whenever they want\".  Point being, with such a great review of the food, that we never got to experience, you would think the owner would be sure that he employed more professional and pleasant staff.

Absolutely incredible. When food was being brought out my husband was elbowed in the face without even a word. Also, my family and I were on separate bills from our friends but we were sharing our food with them. The waitress actually came over and said \" this us theirs\" and literally moved our plate back to our side of the table. Apparently sharing is frowned upon here.

Same bad luck with the pot-stickers and rock shrimp - greasy and warmed over. Even the white rice (how can you mess that up?) was cold. The service, which is usually fairly prompt (albeit rather brusque) was so slow, that we and several other diners were commiserating about how bad it was. \n\nPerhaps this was all due to the fact that the proprietor - Peter Fang - was nowhere to be seen. In any event, I don't plan on going back to HoN any time soon...there are other betters options and places to discover. It's a pity, because this used to be a much better restaurant.

San Francisco was one of several stops on a road trip, and House of Nanking was recommended by several locals.  Bar tenders.  Natives touring Anchor Steam with us.  Relatives that live in the area.  All seemed to point us to House of Nanking for dinner, and to let the owner order for us.  With that much buildup, we were set for something good.\n\nUnfortunately, all we got was 'meh.'  We waited in line for over 30 minutes just to get in, were crammed in the corner freezing by the window, and made our generic selections.  Something with fish, something vegetarian, a rice dish, and a chicken dish.  Let the owner sort it out.\n\nWe were brought fried rice, wet spinach with shrimp somewhere underneath, a bland chicken dish, and an equally bland vegetarian dish.  I was not impressed by any of them.  Nor pleased.  Nor full.  It was overpriced, but I was more upset about how many people recommended the restaurant.  Does House of Nanking give kickbacks to locals that convince visitors to come in?  Maybe there's a punchcard of sorts; everytime they sucker a tourist into the restaurant they get a stamp, and once they get 10, they'll receive a free tshirt.  There has to be some motivation other than malice to recommend that naive visitors eat here.\n\nAvoid it.  There are much better places in the city that are less crowded and much more tasty.

And it was the perfect compliment to the SESAME CHICKEN!  Hands down the best chinese dish I've EVER had, and between my husband and I, we've had a lot!  Perfect flavors, but the key is that the chicken was crispy and didn't get soggy.  And it's served with sweet potatoes, which I've never seen at a chinese restaurant, but it worked and it was fantastic!   The service was all right, not great but not bad at all.  But you come here for the food and it's a home run for sure!", "author": "Ragini S."}

It was very busy but we were lucky to get a table right away & who seemed to be the owner recommended we let him order for us. Now while I usually like that, in a Chinese restaurant that I've heard so much about, I at least wanted to look over the menu. He brought over the house honey beef & sesame chicken. The beef was very good; tender ribs with a sweet sauce but the sesame chicken was dissapointing; no better than sweet orange chicken from Panda Express or something like that. Then we got some really delicious seafood soup with lemongrass & coconut milk which was delicious but seemed more like a delicious Thai seafood soup than Chinese; strange but delicious. Again, I liked this place but I'm not sure what the crazy hype is all about as it was just ok. I probably wouldn't go back though as there's too many other authentic, more delicious Chinese spots in SF.", "author": "Sara F."}

I paid twice as much for food / service / ambiance that was not as good as many of the other choices in the area.  I will say I enjoyed the flavor and chicken quality of the nan king sesame chicken.  But it came to our table on a giant sparse plate with no serving spoon and no rice for several minutes, by which time it got cold.  Our other dish was Mu Shu Shrimp and it was very uninspiring.  No tea unless you asked and even then, they served it in these tacky plastic yellow cups.  No soy sauce or any condiments on the table.  No chop sticks.  No fortune cookie.  There's a ton of better places to choose from.  Don't believe the hype and stroll down Jackson for many better choices.", "author": "Marc S."}

But House of Nanking has managed to become one of my must-eats whenever I visit San Francisco for a weekend.  I've been a couple of times, and introduced different friends to the restaurant and made them lovers of Chinese food again too!\n\nThe wait is almost always a little daunting on weekends, but it usually moves fairly quickly.  I'm vegetarian and have usually gone with a group of vegetarians, so we just tell the waitress and chef our dietary restrictions and leave it to them to bring out what they'd like.  I'm usually someone who likes looking through the menu and deciding what I want, but it's kind of nice to leave the decision making to the cook.  And, I've never been disappointed.  And, they always bring out the right amount of food, so you're not left wasting or underfed.  And, I've come to realize there's excitement in not knowing what is going to be brought out and being amazed every time.  Since we've gone a number of times, we now know to ask for the onion pancakes and an eggplant dish, but still allow them to experiment with other dishes for us.  The reason I give this place 4 stars as opposed to 5, is that because there's always a wait, they kind of rush you out quickly.  The tables are all extremely close to one another, so we can literally listen in on the neighboring table's conversation.  So, it isn't really a dining experience.. but a fun experience nonetheless!

Apparently they take reservations, but I have no idea how they'd control it, so unless you're a large party, I'd be a little leery of the reservations holding true.\n-Found the food just okay (and we've had both authentic and American Chinese food and have traveled to China).  We ordered the house sesame chicken, the house noodles, and shrimp/mushroom stir fry.  Nothing was really bad, but nothing was that special.\n-Service was awful, although as soon as I walked in, I expected it.  We didn't really leave a tip - just rounded up.

I travel to SF about twice a month so by no means am I a local, but I've tasted enough good Chinese food to have an opinion about authentic flavors.  We were feeling adventurous and just told the host to order up a variety of dishes, given some individual preferences to guide the cooks.  For example, one person could not eat very hot dishes, but I preferred heat and hot all the way.  The host, whom I believe was the owner, went to it and soon we were showered with a steady stream of dishes - seafood soup (flavored to invidual likings), followed by a beef wrap, followed by other deliciousness.

He lives near the area so he always sees a line forming outside of the restaurant. We were both curious to see what the hype was about. \n\nWe ordered steamed potstickers, mushu pork and the sesame chicken. Our 5 steamed potstickers  showed up swimming in enough sauce for 10 potstickers and the sauce was some concoction of soy sauce and corn starch. I don't know about you, but I'm used to customizing my own dipping sauce for my dumplings! The mu shu pork was assembled at our tables with the waitress's bare hands-i felt uneasy from the potstickers swimming in sauce so this wasn't a positive thing. The last dish we got was the sesame chicken and that was best of the three but that's not saying much. Taste wise, nothing was as good as chinese food i've had in my 'hood for much less money.

Somehow we lucked out and our party of 7 were seated right away late Saturday night (I guess there is a wait some times?). Our friend/SF local asked us if we just wanted to let the staff decide our meal, and we agreed to give it a shot. And it was well worth it! We told them we'd like mainly veg food with a few fish dishes, and within what seemed like moments, we had 6 amazzzzzzing dishes lined up before us. \nWe weren't told any names of dishes, but the Eggplant salad and and the sauteed mushrooms were some of the best I've ever had (and I can't usually stand eggplant). My friend's said the calamari and shrip dishes were also grand.\nI think our total bill (beer and six food dishes) came out to about $100. We loved this place so much we were set to come back the next day for lunch, but got off to too late a start the next morning and had to hurry to the airport.

The good news is that they are still serving fresh and tasty food that is two or three steps above most every other Chinese restaurant.

I won't get into the detailed rationale here, but instead say that I did wait in line at the insistence of my local san franciscan friends.  House of Nanking was what they promised:  americanized chinese with a surprisingly light flavor.   \nWe ordered an open-ended vegetarian appetizer and two veggie entrees, which included some fair-to-middling fried tofu and a very good mushroom dish.  The appetizer was marvelous: some sort of onion pancake type thing with a very mild and sweet peanut sauce.   \nSince I totally love slummin' it, I found the greasy table tops and cafeteria chairs charming, but I imagine not everyone would.  Additionally, cash is probably your best bet, as their credit policy seems a little ambiguous.  I kind-of wish this weren't the only chinese I had while in SF, as the pickin's are slim in my native PDX, but if you are local this joint isn't a waste of line-time.", "author": "Annie H."}

A cold citrusy-soy noodle dish, fresh greens mixed within, and a black bean prawn dish--- but not your typical Chinese restaurant fare (i.e., swimming in that black bean sauce you buy in a jar at any Asian supermarket), but lightly coated and mixed with lots of slightly-crisped veggies.

It was perfect - not too salty, crispy and cooked just enough so the meat was tender.  We had a fish dish (and yes, we had them pick for us) that was also tender and well spiced.

Really, I think it's all about managing expectations.\n\nExpectation #1: There will be tourists. Somehow this place has managed to be included in every freaking guidebook for people traveling to SF. Having tourists there doesn't really make it a bad place (well maybe besides any place in Fisherman's Wharf... sorta kidding), just let them eat their food and brush aside the fact that they might go yapping on about what their plans at the Wharf are later. But anyway, I've only been with my coworkers, and have never been the only Asian person in there, whatever that has to do with anything.\n\nExpectation #2: Because of #1, you may have to wait in line, outside. I've actually never had to wait in line, as we seem to get there just before the crowds do. But waiting for a table is kind of expected for a small space in a generally busy area.\n\nExpectation #3: Service might be slow. The food comes out relatively fast, but for simple things like getting water refilled or ordering another dish, the staff isn't very in tune to your needs. Of course, once you're done, they'll be all too eager to get you out the door and on your way. Oh yeah, not the friendliest staff, but never overtly rude (at least to us). Expect this, and it's not so bad.\n\nExpectation #4: It's not your typical Chinese food. Both my parents are Chinese. My mom cooks like a gourmet Chinese chef. My dad can't cook worth a damn (but he tries). Both make \"Chinese food\". Get over the fact that just because it's not typical, it's not Chinese. That being said, some of the food definitely has a different, somewhat sweeter side to it. The keys to having a decent dining experience  are\n    1) Eating family-style (or as I always say \"splitsies!\") so you can share a few things\n    2) Ordering wisely (or letting the owner order for you). If there are 5 dishes with that brown sauce everyone is talking about, don't order 3 of them and expect different flavors. If there are 6 fried items on the menu, don't order all of them. Variety is always appreciated, right?\n    3) Have some hot tea. Yeah, it might look weird with whole leaves and those funky orange pods (completely edible), but the tea will definitely help cut some of the grease from the heavier dishes\n\nSo why 4 stars? Well, seems like my coworkers absolutely love this place. I'm pretty ambivalent to it, but haven't had anything there (as far as food) that was terrible.

Trust the owner. hm.... just thinking about their food..... why am I in Manhattan and not SF? \n\nAs with all 'best-kept secret' restaurants, there is a line; you wait outside for 30 minutes on average. as has been said before, it's bloody well worth the wait", "author": "Ali N."}

We told the waiter,  \"One dish with chicken, one with fish; one with beef - chef's choice.\"  It was decent.  It was not fancy or healthy; it was far too salty, but, when eaten before it got cold and gelatinous, it was tasty (as with most Chinese food).  The fish dish and the vegetables were the best.  Definitely not an ambiance place - you do not go here to impress anyone - although, we did see famous comics sitting across the room.", "author": "Shelley T."}

Excellent, fresh and distinctive Chinese food... Just let the waiter order for you. Standout dishes I've sampled are the calamari, the deep-fried potstickers with peanut sauce, hunan beef with steamed cucumber, and sauteed white fish with green beans. Other yelpers' comments on the sameness of the sauces are somewhat apt, and that does keep me from going here often... Everything is cooked well, not too greasy, and delicious though, and once in a while I just get an itch that only this place can scratch. I recommend going for lunch or an early dinner, or being prepared to wait in a long line (which to me is not worth the wait but obviously it is to a lot of other folks) and share a table. Parking is a bitch around here too.", "author": "Brian H."}

It's Hunan food, which is a province of China so it's a little twist on your typical chow-mein and fried rice. Very small and affordable place that usually has a line out the door, but then again, that's how most restaurants are in SF. In my opinion, the food is worth the wait, the bad service, and the fact that they only accept cash. My usual dishes there are the melt in your mouth calamari and crackling beef. My new favorite dish there is the eggplant w/ garlic sauce. I get a kick out of their tea, it's a blossoming tea where a pre-made tea bulb is immerse in hot water, and after a minute or so, it blossoms into a beautiful flower. It goes perfect during a nice cold SF night. Would I come back here again? Definitely.", "author": "My B."}

Now I know why. I've eaten Chinese food all my life and I think this place is for people who don't  like real Chinese food. It's very westernized, overrated and overpriced. It's one of those places that Chinese people say \"tricks\" the non-Chinese people. Maybe it was an off day, but we ordered the garlic fish and it was just some fried battered fish with little flavor. I had to add soy sauce and chili sauce for every bite. I asked if there were any vegetables so they said they would add some-they sprinkled some spinach leaves on top and drizzled it with some sweet vinaigrette dressing. Who puts sweet vinaigrette dressing in Chinese food? The house noodles were boring. The noodles were just some cheap re-hydrated noodles worth a few cents. The menu said it would come with garlic vegetables so I was expecting real pieces of vegetables, but they just sprinkled some raw pea sprout leaves and a few julienned pieces of cucumber. I just tasted soy sauce, hardly any other flavor. The dish was $8.95 I believe. For this price I could get some hand pulled noodles with meat and big pieces of vegetables like broccoli or bok choy at some other Chinese restaurants. I looked at the other tables and saw a lot of deep fried meat and sweet potatoes covered with some sweet  sauce. That's a pretty typical formula to \"trick\" the non-Chinese customers- deep fry everything, drench it with some sugary sauce, skimp on the ingredients and then over charge them for it all.

Reading the reviews of this place has me really surprised at the number of not so wonderful ones. Being from San Diego (and not Chinese heritage) I thought at first it must be because some (SOME) folks in S.F. are a bit snobby about their food -- S.F. being such a 'foodie' city. At the end of the day, I don't know why the discrepancy. Maybe it's because I am not Chinese and never had Mama cook it the \"right way\" ? Not sure. All I can say is that this place has the best Chinese I've ever eaten. I certainly would like a bit cleaner place, but it is not inconsistant with the rest of Chinatown. I know the owner is a bit gruff, but for me it adds to the charm. I would LOVE to find a place with better Chinese in S.F.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-03", "description": "I find the discussion of authenticity and tourists here quite interesting. First of all, China is a huge country with lots of diversity- a meal in a local restaurant in Xian is quite different from a hotel restaurant in Shanghai, so which is more \"authentic\"? Both have Chinese chefs and customers, both are Chinese restaurants. Is the American food at my house in the midwest more authentic that that served in Texas? Seems like a pointless discussion to me. The food I had at Nanking wasn't too far off from meals I've had in Shanghai, but I can't say I've been to Nanjing, and I'm sure others who ate at different restaurants in China have had different experiences. Sure, Nanking doesn't provide chopsticks, but isn't is less wasteful to use a washable fork rather than toss out all those little pieces of wood? It's a rare Chinese restaurant in the US that provides re-useable chopsticks, so I'll give them a break on the utensil front. Regardless, the food at House of Nanking was good, and if you really want \"authentic\" Chinese food, go to China. Second, someone wrote in their review that Nanking was good for tourists because it was different than what they get in their smaller cities. Ok, SF isn't the biggest city in the US, so some tourists come from bigger cities (like my Chicago-raised self), and many other cities have good Chinese food, including, in my personal experience, Chicago, New York, Seattle, Honolulu and Kansas City, among many others. Also, on the Friday afternoon that I ate at Nanking most of the other customers appeared to be businesspeople from the Financial District and college-aged kids. Sorry for the rant, but it needed to be said.\n\nOverall Nanking was a good dining experience. The woman who served us ordered for us, usually I don't mind this as if often leads to one of their best liked/best prepared dishes. If you are in the mood for something specific, ask, but if you are laid back enough to deal with the surprise, let them order for you and chock it up to \"experience.\" The veggie dish we had was quite good, tasty asparagus and peppers in a sauce that was a tad oily, but nicely spiced. The shrimp and mushroom dish was fantastic, the shrimp were beautifully flavored and the mushrooms cooked to the point of savory perfection. The white rice we were served was ok, a little on the dry side. The hot tea was awesome, floral and delicate, served in a generously sized mug. The restaurant is cramped and small, and the atmosphere a little rough around the edges, but the food was worth it. Friday at a little after 1pm we didn't have to wait for a table for two.

I have been here a few times, and it is ALWAYS the same experience:\n* Cramped, long tables elbow to elbow with strangers. Forget having a conversation there. \n* LOUSY LOUSY LOUSY service. I thought about checking NO service below. Ask for anything and you get a dirty look and a rushed, annoyed response. They never return to your table except to bring food, and collect the check.\n* Expensive, white people safe, Asian style food. Maybe that is why people rave. if you want safe, boring food, this is the place. There is little Chinese about the food here.\n* Did I mention expensive? 4 people, 5 dishes, two teas and one beer was $80 before tip. Green tea is $2 per person for a large beer mug filled with hot water and a tea bag hanging on the edge.\n* Did I mention the bad service?\n* Everything seeps to be deep fried. They would deep fry the rice if the could figure it out. Even the pot-stickers were deep fried!\n\nAmbience: You come in, you are crammed into a long table of other people, they throw a menu at you, then start suggesting dishes, eventually say they will \"take care of you\" and take away the menu. Then, they will just start brining you food. Be careful, they will keep bringing it if you do not say stop.\n\nWe started with Calamari. It was deep fried, but not crispy as it was sitting in a pool of oil. The size of the dish was rather small given its large $15 price tag. Next we had the Sesame Chicken, their special dish. This was basically deep fried clumps of chicken in a tangy sauce served with sweet potato slices. The chicken was more deep fried batter than chicken, but it was tasty. We had fish fillet nanking style. Again, deep fried pieces of fish with some vegetables. OK, not great,   The house noodles were a sticky, oily, slightly spicy noodles in a bowl with chunks of deep fried chicken placed on top.  Pass, it is not good.\n\nWhile it rates moderate at $11 to $30 per person, the dishes are small, and $80 for Chinese food for four people is outrageous given only 5 small dishes. Steam rice is 50 cents per person, not bad, but they charge you even if some of your party do not want it. \n\nSummary: This place has buzz , but I think it is left over from a previous time when it used to be better. I find it noisy and cramped, with bad service and mediocre food at best, and way too expensive for what you get.", "author": "Owen R."}

Delish food.\n\nWe went to this place on a recommendation from a friend who apparently has low standards for cleanliness or service.

I couldn't beleive it.\n7) most of the unlucky people arround us had to SHARE tables with strangers. Not in a nice, comfy, family way, but in a yucky, crowded, sardine way.\n8) this was the kicker: one already-seated guy was actually asked to get up and MOVE to another area so a group of three could be seated. A whole new level of bad service. Of course, he is to blame, too, by agreeing to it. Ew.\n\n\nWe ordered:\nShrimp pancake: I wasn't expecting it to be crispy, but oh, man, it was so incredibly delicious. My boyfriend and I agree wholeheartedly, that this is the best item we had.\nCombo fried rice: This was gross. It had strange-looking pieces of chicken and uh, something. And about three cups of hard scallions. Maybe I should have known something was wrong with the fried rice because they incorrectly brought us steamed rice. TWICE.\nSome chicken dish...don't even remember what it was. It was pretty tasty, though the sauce was too similar to the sauce on the pancakes.\n\nEvery platter was badly, badly chipped. \n\nWe were seated immediately, and we went at about 6:00 on a Sunday night.

A lot of the dishes at these events were not very good, despite the Chinese people at my table devouring them passionately.  I don't automatically think that authentic Chinese food is good or non-authentic Chinese food is bad.  I like to keep an open mind and decide what is good when I put it in my mouth.   Of course, if you are Chinese, I am sure you have a different opinion.  My wife is Indian and she has very certain ideas of what is good Indian and what is bad.  If the food isn't like her mom's then it is bad.  She usually doesn't like any Indian food that isn't regionally like what she was brought up on.  She isn't a big fan of southern Indian food, which I really love.   So basically, what I am trying to say is that you really have to look at who is reviewing the food and what their background is to really understand what they are saying.    If one of the people from the Chinese wedding I went to reviewed the meal we had then he may say it was incredible where I would have said it was too greasy and salty. \n\nIf I was in Tokyo and I walked into an Applebees and saw a bunch of white people, should I instantly think that this place had amazing American food?    Maybe.   Maybe it's the best in the area.  Maybe the white people have bad taste and go here because it reminds them of the crappy American food they get back home.   Maybe it really is the best place to get a cheeseburger in Tokyo.   Who knows.  What I am trying to say is that there are a lot of ways to look at a restaurant and you shouldn't discount it just because there are no Asians nor should you praise it because it is full of Asians.   Trust me, I've been to MANY bad Chinese and Indian restaurants filled with Chinese and Indian people...   Maybe all the Asians are avoiding it since there are so many damn tourists and long lines and it is pricey for lunch.  Maybe they are avoiding it because the can make better food at home.  Maybe they are avoiding it because they are smart and don't want to waste their money?", "author": "Erick Z."}

A year and a half later, numerous return visits and after a move out of the city, we still get the same thing (with some extras from time to time) and make it a point to eat here every time we are in the city. We even take our out-of-town visitors who we tour around the city to here almost always. Over the years we've tried a few other things, like the mushu pork with the wrap, the nanking chicken, the fried rice but it's the stuffed mushroom and fried squid that are the best.

Let me start by saying that if you are the type of person that the level of service at a restaurant is a deciding factor in the overall experience, then the House of Nan King is not going to be your bowl of rice, pardon the pun... The food was hands down the best Chinese food I have had. The Sesame Chicken was the best I have had and the Chow Mein was equally as amazing. I found the scallops to be delicious but the quantity was definitely lacking. My girlfriend had the vegetarian lettuce wraps and continues to rave about them whenever we talk about our trip to China town to friends. Well worth the 45 minute wait.

Upon arrival, we saw that the tables were completely filled-which means that the food must be pretty good. So like all typical Chinese resaurants, the service sucked which seems expected, but these guys were pretty damn rude. We had ordered the Calamri, Chao mein noodles and the Biao bao dish. The calamari was okay,  not overly breaded and in it's \"TANGY\" -as reviews had put it-  highly recommended sauce, which was basically vinegar and coconut juice.  Okay so I get that it's supposed to be modern Chinese food with a twist, Honestly I don't think it is worth the $14 you'd pay to get this dish. The biao bao was pretty good, being it tasted like greasy Chinese food but a bit better. There was tomatoes under the wrap which we had happily ate toward the end because the calamri contained no veggies and the biao biao was basically meat in greasy garlic sauce.  Once we almost finished, we had noticed the they had convienently left the produce sticker on the tomato. A good sign the tomatoes probably weren't washed well or washed at all. We had complained because at this point we were 55min into the course with no chow mein and now a possibly unwashed tomato we had eaten. Of course the only reply we had gotten from the waitress was \"oh sorry\"  and than just walked away. No discount or compensation. We  were now running behind schedule and needed to leave so after waiting another ten minutes we decided to just pay at the front and skip getting the chow mein. As for talking to the owner, it seemed quite useless as he was over-inflating his ego talking only to customers he percieved to have fat wallets and or Caucasian.  If you're wondering I am Asian and so is my wife.  I also have a fat wallet but was never approached nor anyone else that fit this description. Anyhow, the overall experience  was not impressive.

He told us he was a chef and asked that we let him make a recommendation.  We told him we wanted seafood but no meat.

The food though is not bad for what it is. The flavoring is distinctly not chinese and definitely caters to the American taste buds. I'd say it's more like fusion, and I can't fault the combination of ingredients. However, to believe that this is Chinese food is somewhat blasphemous.\n\nSo anyway, we ordered the potstickers and the fried shrimp cake as appetizers. The potstickers were quite good surprisingly, but I will warn that they are deep fried. This was a shock to me, but it actually turned out quite well. The fried shrimp cake was also not what I expected and was just a deep fried won ton with shrimp inside. Tasty as well but started to get overwhelmed with deep fried dishes. Doesn't everything taste better when it's deep fried?\n\nFor entrees, we let the waitress decide since that seems to be the thing to do here. I believe we ended up with the Shaking Beef and the Sesame Chicken. I'm not sure if this is always the case, but the food came out at a lukewarm temperature. This leads me to believe that they make huge batches of these \"recommended dishes\", which works well when they get to decide the dishes. The sauce in the Sesame Chicken was a little too strong. They include some yam in the dish as a nice addition, but otherwise not much more exciting than sesame chicken you get at Panda Express. The beef dish seemed like it would have been really good if it had been served hot. It included the sizzling rice, which was not sizzling. Unfortunately, this led to an overall disappointing dish.\n\nOverall, I can see the appeal of this restaurant.

At the House of Nanking, there were flavors I have never experienced before.  The food is quality, outstanding, and tasty.  It's obvious they spend more energy and money in their food than the ambiance of the establishment.  But eating there is an experience (positive) in itself.  Has a hole in the wall feel. The seating is usually next to another couple or party, and the kitchen is right there, gives it a cozy feeling.  There's action going on everywhere around you and it is not quiet.  They don't take reservations, and usually there's a line.  Never order off the menu, tell the server (who's usually the owner/cook or his wife) to prepare what they believe is the best for that day.  There have been times when I've asked the server to prepare what's best for that day, and it was tasty.  The next time I came, I ordered the same item, was not as good as the last time, but the new recommendation the server offered was outstanding.  \nThere does seem to be quite a few tourists at the house of Nanking of Nanking.

I would think \"this place, can't be that great, it looks like such a nasty hole-in-the-wall.\" And then one day I totally fell for the \"there is a long line so I'll stand here too since it must be good\" logic. \nI went with my friend and waited only about 10 minutes to be sat. Of course, we got sat right next to this awkward couple from Canada asking the lady for \"soyyah sauce-o\" of some bologna like that. They were obviously going deaf because they were talking way too loud. It was pretty miserable to sit next to these two but I continued to come here and sometimes you sit to some interesting people and get into conversations with them. And many of them are traveling. \nI used to be a really big fan of the soups here but they are getting saltier and saltier. I'm really sensitive to salt but even my bf who isn't tells me that they are too salty for him. The sizzling rice soup was my favorite. \nThe sesame chicken is to die for! I am vegetarian but I really miss the chicken and get really tempted to eat a piece even though it'd probably make me poo water. But it's that good. My boyfriend gets it and lately I just pick at the sweet potatoes which are amazing. \nI have been getting the plate where they mix up some veggies for you in their garlic sauce. I usually get tofu and eggplant. It is a little too salty or me but doable. It's still good, with a lot of rice. OH, and I really like their tea. \nThe reason it doesn't get the full 5 stars is the service has always been terrible. Even when it's slow its not so great service. I always have to ask them to fill my water, get me rice, etc. The owner (I'm pretty sure) is really nice and if you are indecisive he will decide for you what you will be eating.

The food is not even good for Americanized Chinese food--the much lauded \"sesame chicken\" is basically General Tso's chicken with an extra spoonful of sugar, and the rest of the dishes were overly sweet as well.  The salt and pepper prawns, formerly one of their stand-out dishes, is now a lot of mushrooms, some shrimp and no crunchiness to be seen, and the dry braised green beans were actually in some kind of liquid.  The service was indifferent:  we got all our dishes and had to wait for the rice, and one waitress was actually on the phone when she served us.

The 'famed calamari' pushed by our server was fishy and went back to the kitchen, and the deep fried, heavily salted pork was tender only because most of it was fat.

I went there today and the owner gave me this look like, 'oh great, YOU'RE here again?'  This guy obviously knows my face after so many times, but because I'm younger and with other students he wants to discriminate against us from the get go.  He never treats the older crowds like this.  The food was thoroughly inconsistent and the Nanking Chicken was chewy and a meager portion.  I never asked for rice but was charged 2 dollars for it, I was RUSHED OUT THE DOOR even though there was no line at 3 in the afternoon.  And here's the real kicker...we made friends with a lovely flight attendant sitting next to us and when we tried to put our credit cards down on the table to pay for our respective meals the guy was ordering us to use cash.  I asked if he was credit card machine was broken and all he did was send over another lady to tell us to use cash.  Again I asked if their credit card machine was broken and finally she gave in and took our cards in a disgruntled fashion.  Shady business.  They are either trying to report less for tax purposes or they are worried about the credit processing fee.  This practice is highly illegal and you should notify your credit card carrier if a restaurant you know tries to discourage you from using a card as they can have their merchant processing privileges revoked for it.  Do you realize that the amount of money that they spend on a 30 dollar bill for processing fees, even with an ugly rate would be like 25-30 cents!!!!  They were willing to make their customers feel like crap over a mere quarter!  If a friggin' quarter means this much to these people I implore you to just imagine for a moment the next time you're waiting in line like cattle for this overrated, inconsistent palace of msg how a business like this would choose to cut corners on quality for kitchen spending.

Always get there as early as possible, a long line starts at about 7pm, if your taking a group be patient it's so worth it!", "author": "Shawna G."}

I have had plenty of onion cake in my lifetime, this is probably the worst.  The sweet sauce over the onion cake was not necessary.  Aside the poor quality of the dishes we ordered, the staff were rude, not just to us, but to the entire restaurant customers.  They (4 or 5 of them) were carrying  a conversation in the back of the restaurant talking loudly, at times, like a screaming match.  One of the male staff was even using some Chinese profane language.  That totally had ruined my day.

We went in with out-of-town guests (nearly every single out-of-towner who has comed to visit has heard of House of Nanking - any most of them are from the East coast) and had to wait outside for 30 minutes. Yes, not ideal, but you must live in the boonies to not know that there is almost always a line for House of Nanking. I HATE that people on Yelp consider this a reason to give the restaurant low stars - if you don't want to wait in line, don't go. Keep the line shorter for people like me. Anyhow, we site down and the chef asks us if we've been here. Though one in the party had been there before, we say we haven't been. He immediately takes the menus away and says \"I'll take care of you.\" We were promptly delivered several courses of AMAZING food. Spring rolls, shrimp, chicken and rice soup, sesame chicken, mushu. Every single dish was memorable. Though I've obviously had Chinese food many, many times before, this restaurant somehow makes traditional Chineses dishes fresh and interesting again.

The peanut sauce added a great flavor that I wasn't used to. Next we had sesame chicken and the garlic ginger scallops. Both were great, but the scallops were the best I've ever had. Great ginger-soy sauce and thinly sliced scallops and a great presentation.

I have tried the best of Chinese food and I was expecting something decent based on the review. Upon arriving, they asked us to get out of the way and threw menus on the table after they sat us down elbow to elbow with other patrons. I was still feeling fine and hoping the poor attitude will translate into fine cuisine. The menu was disappointing (Mushu Tofu with tortilla and plain rice?) but I was still game and ordered a dumpling soup with slow cooked broth.\n When the server brought the soup over, she quickly shoved the hot soup in between me and  another customer without notifying either of us, and the gentleman, unaware of what's happening bumped her and the soup spilled over and burned me. She left me some napkins and served me the same bowl of soup that's half spilled... Call it after shock, but for some reason, I stayed long enough to taste the soup and it was plain as water. Then my boyfriend's pathetic tofu tortilla arrived and we just stood up and left . We were stopped by a woman that asked us what happened and after we explain the situation, she did not apologize and put us on the spot in the middle of the restaurant by asking who did it. Yeah, the exact context \"who did it?\" The server started to squirm and told her that because that guy had moved and from the corner of my eyes I saw that man's stunned expressed on my way out.\n\nThe food was a disgrace and the service was horrible.

This place is certainly not deserving of having an overall four-star rating after 70+ reviews.  Its awful. Its super cramped and tiny, low quality ingredients result in excessively greasy dishes, the service is hasty and pressuring, no doubt to whisk you out quickly and max out the tables they can serve.

No reservations means long lines outside -- and then once you are seated you immediately feel like you are in a rush to get out of there.  No menus are given - pretty much you have a choice between water, sodas and beer - you tell them beer - who knows what they are going to bring out, but whatever it was it was tasty.  As for the food - the waiter asked if there was anything we didn't like - we told him we were up for anything and then the food onslaught began.  So much food - asparagus in a garlic sauce, some kind of pork egg rolls, calamari, eggplant in a fantastic sauce which some kind of meat or maybe tofu, this crazy beef noodle dish, the special Nanking chicken dish.  I am sure I am forgetting stuff, but seriously the food just kept coming.  We were a big group but we were kind of concerned that there would be too much food but it worked out perfectly and we all were members of the clean plate club.  All of the dishes were fantastic but this is not a place to go where you want to take a time.  You truly feel like you are in a food race because the food comes out so quickly and it just keeps coming.  This is also not a place to go if you are a picky eater or have to know what you are ingesting.  House of Nanking is for those who are a little adventurous but it is not like we ate anything crazy - veggies, pork, beef, chicken and calamari.

It is still pretty much a hole in the wall--you know-- dirty, greasy, loud and such but the food is the only reason we come back.   We don't seem to go back as often as we used to.  Peter (the owner) was much nicer in the earlier days and would strike up a conversation with you and give you his signature sly smile and serve beers as you waited outside.  It was great as the line was so long it would block the entrance to the place next door and they would come out and yell at Peter... that place was empty and I'm sure they were jealous of his success.  Over the years (as the restaurant expanded to the space next door) it seems to have lost most (not all) of its charm.  Sure, the food is still good (order the potstickers and chix w/ sweet potatoes) but don't go there to really enjoy your meal.  From the moment you are seated, it's rush, rush, rush.  They rush over to take your order--don't bother to look at the menu,  just tell Peter what kind of meat or veggies you like and he'll do it for you.  Then, you'll get all sorts of things in various, random order.  You probably won't have time for another beer as they want you in and out as fast as you can eat.  You'll get the food and probably the check at the same time.  You'll be packed in like sardines and won't be able to do much talking.  I swear, we are usually in and out of there in less than 20 minutes.  For the amount of food they serve, the speed is amazing (especially considering  the size of the kitchen).  During the early years, we called it 'cheap chinese' as it used to be one of the best deals in town.  It's not that way anymore (good things never last) but I admire them for what they do--dealing with demanding locals and clueless tourists on a daily basis.   If you've never experienced this place, you have to go at least once to try and figure out why this place is so popular.  You may need to suck in your gut to  fit in the small, cramped seats and tables.  Actually, it's like eatting with 20 of your closest friends--problem is you don't know any of them.  I guess this is a part  of San Francisco that everyone should experience--but probably just once.  I'm sure we'll go back again--I'm a glutton for punishment.", "author": "Brian M."}

We walked the easy chilly walk from Stockton & Powell Sts to Nanking and was shocked there were NO lines..  the first time ever!! We went inside and were quickly shown a table... no sitting side by side but facing each other - the place fills up quickly and they were assembly-line seating us ready for crowds. The quite pricey menu didn't sound too appetizing to me so I decided to play it safe ordering the pork wonton soup and the house thick/short noodles with veggies...  The soup came within minutes...  it was slightly spicy and though I HATE - absolutely HATE - spicy, it was good enough for me to finish it off, though I gasped for air and choked each time I drank the soup liquid....  there was enough wonton for four and between my friend and I it was ample. The house noodles arrived late, about ten minutes later as I think they forgot to place the order. That was a bad point for me and the tabletop was sticky, which I hate to feel in a restaurant of ANY caliber. It disgusts me that a place cannot keep their tables clean but oh well....  when the noodles came, it was HOT and good! Not too hard, not spongy and mushy....  just right! It was tasty and I ate it all up.....  I would like to save for a year or two to return and order some of my other meal items that I like, but this was a good start. My friend and I were the only asians in the place at the time, except for those who worked there. It was noisy and everyone was talkative/loud which - to me - is a good sign that everyone was enjoying their food. There was a lot of head-turning and staring at the other table/people and what they ordered and everyone seemed satisfied. The people who sat next next to us and were served before us - visiting from LA and Boston - loved their pot-stickers with peanut sauce and other items. One of them had been here while vacationing previously during the year and now on a business trip, decided it was worth a TAXI-ride from their Redwood City hotel (and back) to try it with her co-worker ~ wow!!  I'd probably return with out-of-town friends....    no parking and as stated earlier: always a line though we lucked out this time. Food is very flavorable!!!", "author": "Tony L."}

It was recommended by friends so I went one evening and was initially encouraged by the crowd and the reviews posted all over the walls. Upon finishing my meal and leaving, I was dissapointed. Service was speedy considering the crowd.  Ordered sizzling rice soup, mu shu (sp?) chicken and fried prawns.  The soup had a LOT of annise in it...so overpowering to the other ingrediants as to render the soup unenjoyable.  Shrimp was very good and the portion size and presentation made it an incredible value for the $11 we paid for the dish.  Mu shu chicken was NOT at all what we expected it to be.  Perhaps we're used to American chinese and this is more authentic...perhaps not...either way, the mu shu chicken reminded me more of P.F Chang lettuce wrap filling than any mu shu I've ever had. It was also served without plum sauce (my favorite part).  It then proceeded to take forever for our check to come.  Overall it was OK.

We arrived at 2pm on a Friday and the place was packed. There was a line outside that we joined and were seated within 10 minutes. I think everyone will agree that you don't come to this North Beach institution for the service, but the food never lets me down. The distinctively white haired owner took our order, without cracking a smile or looking up from his pad of paper. My parents had never been there, so I took charge of ordering--- well, my dad ordered the fried eggplant, which proved to be our least favorite dish. It had good flavors, a garlicky chili sauce, but was a bit heavy on the fried for us. I ordered the peashoot salad with fried yam strips and crispy tofu. I love this dish. I think I could eat it almost everyday. The light vinaigrette on the peashoots is perfect, a little sesame oil, a little rice vinegar, and whatever else is in it. The peashoots have a great texture, soft and a little crunchy and they begin to slowly wilt in the dressing as the meal goes on. Then we got the sesame chicken with sliced yams and some asian melon that I'm not sure what it is. The chicken is barely battered and has a slightly crunchy edge and a sweet sesame sauce. Its served with white rice and is delicious. This place is an institution for a reason---they do what they do incredibly well.

Since the chef ordered for us, I have no clue what the names are of our food. Also, after talking to my teacher who's a foodie as well, he told me when he went, the chef gave him more Amercanized food, while if you look Chinese, the chef orders to the more chinesey side, which is what i got. So the first thing that came out was this broth soup thing, with vegetables and fried fish. This was one of the more memorable dishes because the fish tasted soooo good. It was no longer crunchy after being drenched in soup, but it was good. Then, we got this tofu, that was crusted in some crunchy salt and peppery.

When the grumpy serious looking old Chinese guy came up to us with his pad of paper, he looked at us with a frown and our friend placed the most bizarre order I have ever heard, \"3 orders of WHATEVER - no fish or mushrooms and nothing spicy please - oh and some spring rolls\".  The grumpy old man frowned even more (didn't think it was possible - but oh it was - i think he wanted to kill whoever said they didn't want fish - oops) and then nodded, let out some grunt and walked off.  (???)  About 10 minutes later we were presented with 3 GLORIOUS dishes of \"whatever\" which turned out to be some of the best (albeit not as authentic as some would expect) Chinese I have ever eaten.  The first dish was sesame chicken with glazed sliced sweet potatoes - truly by far the best of all the food we ate this night - and the ONE thing that will have me coming back over and over!! The second dish was a beef & broccoli type of entree - also very good.  The third plate was some sort of marinated pork on a bed of yummie citrus flavored sprouts. Mmmm...  And the last dish was our spring rolls. (oh and they brought us a bowl of steamed rice) - everything was so delicious! I had no idea such a risky roulette order of \"WHATEVER\" could turn out SO GOOD! It was definitely worth the wait, cramped seating and paper towel that stuck to my shoe on my way out. (special thanks to the attentive patron who pointed that out to me as I walked by)  :)", "author": "Julie J."}

Ordinarily, this would have offended our group, but considering we were sitting in a dive, we merely looked at each other nervously and shrugged. When the food showed up and pretty quickly at that, we completely forgot that it was pretty rude and considered it quite charming that he went ahead and ordered for us.

The recipes are different, the sauces are not the same taste or consistency - the peanut sauce used to be creamy and wonderful, and is no longer close to the same -- and agreed with another reviewer, the noodles were bad,  the calamari was fishy, the pot stickers were too well done, as was the chicken in the sesame chicken over fried.  Disappointed completely.    Even when we sat down, my dish still had food stuck to the bottom of it that did not come clean from the dishwasher.    My husband asked a server for help, and all she said was \"not my table\" and walked away -- not even calling someone else over to help us.  The days of our enjoying a Nanking meal are over.

I think Chinese food can be great in a little of different ways - like there's delicious, bad for you, american-style fried chinese food. Then there's amazing \"don't know what's in it but I don't care\" authentic cuisine, and then you've got your modern fusion with latin food or what have you. All are great when done well. House of Nan King seems like it's trying to do a new, modern take on chinese food, which I respect them for, but the food just isn't tasty. We had dumpling soup, sesame chicken and the pork fried potstickers and they all sucked.  Everything was luke-warm and bland.  It was like food you make for a five-year old cause they don't like strong flavors. The potstickers tasted like Hot Pockets, with terrible dough and peanut sauce (again, if you're gonna go non-traditional, atleast taste good). Plus is was overpriced.

Food is not atall greasy and very creative mix of uncommon vegetables and common meat. You can also get seafood and tofu. Unless you have a really bad-karma, the owner will come  to your table to take order and will ask you whether it is your first time. No matter you are there for the first  or the 10th, which will happen in no time after your first visit,  my advise is always pretend it is your first time, he will make up dishes for you. Really those dishes are very uncommon and palatable! Place is not that clean and sometimes you are under pressure for the line outside.
