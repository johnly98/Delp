Since school was starting, I thought we'd take the family out for one at hurrah to finish off the summer.\n\nWe made a reso for the 1st seating on Saturday at 5:30.  We checked the traffic coming from the East Bay and planned accordingly.\n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes early.  We weren't sure where the valet was.  It wasn't set up yet. Apparently it's on Stuart at the corner of Stuart and Market.  There's a sign.\n\nWe were immediately greeted by the host.  Since we were early we were asked to hang out at the bar / lounge until dinner service was ready.\n\nWhile we waiting Lilianna, also our server, helped us take a family picure by the front entrance.  \n\nWe were seated with the best seat in the house.  It had a spacious view of the whole restaurant, looking towards the outside with views of the Pier and the city life.  \n\nWe frequent Blvd down the street.  Their menu is similar.  However the ambiance at One Market is more open and don't feel so dark and squished inside. \n\nWe came at a great time as they are a farm to table restaurant and rotate their menu items based on what a in season.  \n\nLilliana gave excellent recommendations and we obliged.  \n\nWe ordered:\n\nApps to start...\n\nHeirloom tomato salad with burrata-  Super ripe, creamy cheese\n\nGrilled octopus with a curry lentil salad-  Tender octopus slow cooked for 4 hrs, very flavorful lentils worked well with this combo\n\nFois gras with a strawberry glaze, panzanella-  all the ingredients worked well together and balanced out the richness of the fois gras\n\nMain...\n\nLobster Mushroom Risotto-  tomato based, rich, creamy and so flavorful.  \n\nSeared sea scallops-  Mine and the DD 's favorite dish\n\nBraised Beef cheeks-  super tender, spinach spaetzel was yummy\n\nDessert....\n\nButterscotch pudding - We scraped up every last bit of this \n\nChocolate Ganache banana tart- Loved the torches bananas.  DD called is Creme Brulee bananas.\n\nCarrot Cake-  Nothing like I had have before.  Lighter and not heavily sweet like a traditional cake would have with the sour cream frosting \n\nWe had a wonderful experience from beginning to end.  The staff were attentive just enough.  We even enjoyed the piano player who greeted us.\n\nChef Michael came out to say hello.  He and Hubs are IG followers.", "author": "Winnie L."}

The staff was friendly, but service was pretty slow and the atmosphere was forgettable. Unfortunately, the food didn't make the experience any better. \n\nWe ordered the following: \n- Grilled octopus: The octopus itself was good. Well flavored and cooked well, but I didn't care for the flavor combination of the cucumber salad, which added a pretty unwelcome bitterness. \n- Hawaiian Kampachi Crudo: This was my personal favorite dish, though it seemed to be something that you could get at any sushi restaurant. Tasted good, but nothing to write home about. \n- Acorn quash soup: A little heavy handed on the cumin for me, but my boyfriend enjoyed it.\n- Oysters: Seemed fresh, and the vinaigrette they had on the side was a welcome combo.  \n- Lobster mushroom risotto: Honestly, this tasted like a cheese pizza on top of rice. The tomato flavor was so overpowering that you could barely tell it was a mushroom risotto. I was especially disappointed with this one.\n- Pan-seared scallops: These tasted fresh and were flavored decently, but it only came with two. For the price, I would have expected more than two scallops and should hardly be considered an entree. \n- Saut\u00e9ed spinach with garlic chips: This could have been easily replicated at home, and was definitely not worth $9. \n- Fried green tomatoes: Again, these were just fine. Nothing special. \n- Creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e duo and butterscotch pudding: Dessert was the best part of the meal. Both the vanilla and espresso flavored creme br\u00fbl\u00e9es were quite tasty, though nothing exceptional. The butterscotch pudding was delicious- no complaints on this one. \n\nOverall, this was a very forgettable evening, which is very disappointing when you come for a special celebration. Our bill came to just over $230, and the overall experience did not make it worth the money. This feels like a great restaurant to bring the out of town work colleague that you want to impress, but not a place to go if you want to have an overall great experience that makes the bill worth it. Very disappointed :(", "author": "Beth H."}

This is clearly a very popular place because I got there a few minutes before it opened but there was no space in the dining room. No worries, I was gonna sit in the bar anyway since I was alone. This is a beautiful restaurant and a great location. I'm already planning a dinner trip here via the Larkspur Ferry. The bartender was very friendly and got me taken care of right away. He brought over some fresh rolls that were AMAZING!  I ordered the chickpea fries and the crab cakes. I'd never had Chickpea fries before but I saw them on \"Check Please!\" on PBS so I thought I'd try them. They were quite interesting and tasty. I couldn't quite pinpoint the flavor at first but then all of a sudden it hit me. They kind of tasted like hummus which makes perfect sense I guess. The crab cakes were excellent quality. I'm not sure if there was any binding agent at all. It kind of just seemed like little scoops of crab meat. Everything I had was great. The only thing that wasn't perfect (which was my fault not theirs) was that what I wanted to try was not on the lunch menu. Guess I'll have to go back soon.", "author": "Marcus K."}

The restaurant sits at foot of Market St. and offers a great view of the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero.  There's a bar area in front, the main dining room and a Chef's Table that allow you a view of the kitchen in action as the staff prepares the meals for the diners. One Market debuted in 1993 and recently had a celebration for its 25th anniversary. We were fortunate to secure a dinner reservation for this special celebration.\n\nThe restaurant was full for the celebration and after a short wait after checking in, we were seated at a table in the middle of the dining room. Our waiter explained the offerings and took our drink order as we checked out the menu.  \n\nAmuse-bouche - Flounder ceiche on silver spoons\nACME rolls as complementary house bread\n\nOur orders:\nGrilled Spanish Octopus in a chorizo puree, avocado chimichurri and parsley. It was delicious, but wished the portion was a little more generous.\n\nHand-picked Dungeness Crab Salad with miso, citrus, and seaweed. Beautifully plated.  Not a typical salad, in there were no greens. It was a light and refreshing with leg and body crab meat.\n\nPan-seared Day Boat Scallops on a bed of celery root risotto, spinach and black truffle jus. Three large scallops were perfectly prepared. \n\n12oz. Creekstone Angus New York Steak in a red wine butter, bearnaise relish. Ordered the steak medium rare, but it came out medium. The steak was tender though. Tasty red wine butter. \n \nSides: Roasted Mushrooms in thyme and roasted garlic; Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Applewood smoked bacon\n\nChocolate Cremeux Cake with Earl Grey whipped ganache, blood orange, chocolate sherbert. Beautifully presented. Chocolate lovers will enjoy.\n\nPear Tarte Tatin with ginger-thyme ice cream, pear caramel, candied pecans. Nicely presented. Not overly sweet \n\nOur meal was finished with complementary Mignardises of house made candy.\n\nIt's been years since I dined at One Market.

Really, place needs 600 percent wine bottle price markups to survive?\n\nBut the big negative is the manager.  We had a big group dinner.  Dropped almost 2500 dollars on meal.  We sit down and they have less chairs than our reservation number.  We ask for a small table to be added to end so we can comfortably fit our group.  He says impossible because every single table in restaurant is booked tonight.  Blames us for changing our count from 16 to 13.  Says not his fault, and is a total no can do personality.  We then have to do our dinner cramped.  Meanwhile, we watch while three two tops and a five top next to us remain empty the entire night.  And a private room set up for 20 also remains empty all night long.\n\nAt end of evening, I find him and ask what happened.  He says literally \"I can't control cancellations.  What did you want me to do?  Interrupt your dinner to add table space?\"  When I say yes of course, he gruffs and says nothing more he could have done and again is our fault, the customers.  I ask him how many cancellations he had, and he says one two top and one five top.  Ok, so why again wasn't he able to take one of the other two open tables at outset to make group comfortable?  Or give us the set up private room?   His answer is to stick his chin up and walk off.  This guy has no business managing or having direct interface with customers.  Cropped haircut and glasses, in case owner reads this and cares.\n\nBut for him, it would have been great.\n\nNotice how \"Larry\" of restaurant replies to the good reviews, but ignores the true ones.  Should show you all you need to know about this place.  He never once contacted me or anyone in our group for follow up.  Guess he is good with this type of poor experience for a $2,500 bill spend at his place.  Sad.  His picture is a match of the guy I described.

Slightly dim inside (from the dark walls, contrasted by white tablecloths, and little light inside) but thankfully could read our menus since we sat near a window while it was bright outside.  Service was good, perhaps slightly better than normal since my boss knew the chef and so he frequently came over and checked in to see if we liked our dishes.\n\nFood:\n- Hors d'oeuvres - each person got 4 bites before our dishes came out (ours included a baked potato with creme fraiche, a corn fritter, shrimp with cream foam, and tuna with cucumber).  These bites were actually quite tasty, though I wish they would have told us if there was any particular order to eat them in\n- Corn soup (ramp pesto, bay shrimp, pickled fresno chile)($14) - great corn flavor, with some herbal lightness from the ramps and a bit of heat from the chile.  The shrimp somewhat seemed out of place, even if it added a bit of texture to the rich soup.  Also, this portion is HUGE and so, especially since this was rather creamy and rich, was a bit of an overkill portion-wise.\n- Pan seared day boat scallops (~$28) - again, this was a rather big portion, partially because the scallops were massive; I only finished half the plate.  At least, however, they were not overcooked (one of mine looked like it was on the border of being under, but I'll take that vs. over).  Wasn't crazy about the foam fru-fru- it added no texture and it had weak flavor.  \n\nWasn't particularly blown away by my meal size-wise and flavor-wise.

Our table watched the whole night our wait staff service just one of our groups tables and completely ignored the others. It was like we were watching a show of this one particular table enjoying their dining experience while we were all forgotten and ignored. The wait staff were aggressive and rude when we even dared to ask them for anything. Especially the short, bald server. When we asked for bread, his response was \"you need to wait\".   Like I said, it was a very strange experience. \nThe food on the other hand was this places saving grace. I had a delish octopus app with chorizo sauce and day boat scallops for entree, both done very well. Will we come back? No. Too many other beautiful SF restaurants with better, friendly service.", "author": "Loren M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-01-14", "description": "A vendor picked One Market Restaurant for a lunch meeting so I landed up here a couple of days ago. It was good that they had made reservations as there is only a small section open during lunch which was packed with a 30 minute wait for walk-ins.\n\nOne Market Restaurant is your typical run of the mill white table cloth restaurant serving American cuisine. What struck me was it was not as noisy as the more modern places offering fancy small plates, so I would categorize this as more old school elegant. We were quickly seated and offered menus. Our server was back after a couple of minutes and started to push us to get drinks. Suggestions are fine but she was really pushy. Most of us did not want to do drinks as we had to get back to work so we settled on moktails instead. Even here she would not let up and started pushing people who got the Arnold Palmer to get the mint version instead. One of the weak among us succumbed, but I got a mocktail ($5) whose name I do not recollect.\n\nAfter the drinks, our server made it her mission in life to get us to order appetizers. She tried to push some off menu crab cakes. By now most people in the group had sensed that this was not a normal server but one on a mission. A mission to ensure an order - drinks, appetizers, salad, mains, desert which frankly we did not want. We told her clearly that we did not want appetizers and sent her on her way. However she had not received the memo about this being a business meeting so she kept interrupting us and it made having a conversation really tough. When she was back to take the order for our mains she tried to palm the daily special on us. Again none of us wanted that. I decided to get the Natural Angus Flat Iron Steak ($24) and made the mistake of asking her if this could be pared with a salad. The only thing I heard from her response was that I could get either a Caesars salad or a grain based salad. As I am not a fan of just eating overpriced lettuce, I asked her what type of grain is present in the grain salad. I figured this is downtown so they may have a fancy couscous or chickpea salad. On hearing this she actually poked fun at me and finally someone interpreted that she was saying green salad. I decided to get that, I don't know if it was charged as a side or a main, but considering the fancy nature of this place I feel it would most probably be full priced.\n\nThe food did take some time to come out, but it was nice as it did give us some time to catch up on the main agenda for the meeting. When the food arrived, the gentlemen sitting directly opposite me was shocked that he got a burger when he had actually ordered the flat iron steak like me. The only difference was that he wanted it medium and I wanted it medium rare. This meant that we had to deal with the pushy server again. He joked that as I had got my correct order he should start speaking in an Indian accent as his straight forward mid-western accent was not good enough in San Francisco. I feel you brother. I go through this every day. Each time that I order, I don't know if I will get what I've asked for or a random dish that the server feels that I asked for. So welcome to the problem faced by the other 50%. Anyway the server got him his replacement, but not without taking her shot - \"Wouldn't everyone be happy if they got their food so quick?\" Seriously? This was one of the worst servers that I have dealt with. She made this entire dining experience really bad. She personified the stereotype. One that has no concept of service, is only interested in pushing a lot of crap on you so that it increases the bill and hence her tip.\n\nAnyway let's come to the food. The mock-tail was really bad. Its description mentioned that it would have ginger so I was expecting a little ginger but what a got was a drink with a huge amount of chopped ginger. Each sip resulted in a couple of pieces that had to be spat out. Just gross. The flat iron steak was average at best. It wasn't the best piece of meat (which was expected) but it just did not come together well with the mashed potatoes and jus. The green salad was pretty good. Its dressing was like an oil vinaigrette which was nicely tossed into the salad. Everything considered this was like a below average meal. A colleagues who got the Mushroom Stroganoff ($25) reported that the pasta was soft and mushy and over sauced. Goes without saying that he did not like what he ate. The colleague who got the mint version of the Arnold Palmer reported that he should have stuck to the plain version.\n\nPrice wise it was in line with what you would pay in any other formal dining setup (Entrees around $25). The food was mediocre at best. The service was just plain horrible. Overall, forget about being impressed this was a depressing dining experience. We barely managed to get our business discussed with all the drama with our server, while eating overpriced average food. I would rather go to a Chipotle rather can come back here again.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

They have live piano music a noticeably older crowd. The restaurant itself is beautiful - a big space, lots of seating, and a wide open atmosphere.\n\nI came here for Restaurant Week. At first, I was worried that the food would be in smaller portions and of lesser quality with the special tasting menu, but I could not have been more wrong! Service was impeccable and I left the restaurant feeling completely full and content! For $40 prix fixe, you get more than your moneys worth. I would not recommend getting the wine pairings, which will cost you another $20+ for two average wines that were just alright - one red and one white. \n\nSome thoughts on the meal:\n\nThe artichoke soup came with a garlic flan, which added more texture and flavor. It was tasty, but I didn't get enough artichoke flavor as I would have expected. If I took my first sip blind folded, I wouldn't have been able to tell what kind of soup I was tasting! \n\nI had never had lamb's tongue before, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was thinly sliced and tasted like a less salty, lighter version of prosciutto. \n\nThe entrees were both delicious and came out fresh and hot out of the pan. The Petrale sole came with a sweet foam broth that was great with the fish. Similarly, the pork chop was just the right amount of sweet and savory. Both entrees came in a healthy portion and were very tasty despite not being on the normal restaurant menu.\n\nIf you are choosing between the two dessert options, the apple crumb tart is definitely a safer choice. It's basically a mini apple pie with vanilla bean ice cream. The presentation is beautiful and the dessert is warm, crunchy, and gooey - perfect for a rainy day! The tropical sorbet Bombe is for the fruity dessert lovers. It does not like like your typical Bombe as it comes out as a cube...but the presentation is still beautiful. I was already so full after the first two courses so I was struggling to finish this one. Still absolutely delicious and tart, and I particularly enjoyed the almond tuile with the sorbet and fresh fruit. \n\nWas impressed with this meal and would come back to try the normal menu items!", "author": "Sarah N."}

The Amuse bouche was a cheese/caviar dish that was in an egg shell - cute and delicious. The first courses that stood out to us were the ahi tuna tartare and the wild trout 'mi cuit'. For the second course, the scallops were good and I had the bison on jalape\u00f1o grits which was delicious. The beef shoulder was good but not our favorite.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-07-26", "description": "I've lived in San Francisco for about 10 months now. During that time I've had the opportunity to try a variety a restaurants throughout the city. There are so many restaurants to choose from, and my list of restaurants to-go-to is always evolving. I'm a firm believer of the idea that there is no such thing as a perfect restaurant. Different restaurants serve different purposes depending on the occasion and what the group is in the mood for. With that said, if I had to pick a \"favorite restaurant\" in San Francisco (based on my experience thus far), it would have to be One Market.\n\nI've been to One Market on four different occasions, and each time I leave a bit more impressed than the last time. It should come as no surprise that One Market delivers an exceptional dining experience, as the restaurant was awarded a Michelin Star back in 2010. The restaurant really prides itself on serving farm-to-table food, ensuring its food is fresh and innovative.\n\nDuring my most recent visit to One Market, I decided to order the \"Weekly Beast\" 3-course dinner. In the spirit of farm-to-table cooking, this dinner option highlights a different ingredient each week from a nearby farm. During my visit, the featured ingredient was rabbit (sourced from Devil's Gulch Ranch in Marin County). The 3-course dinner included the following: \n\nCourse One: Braised Rabbit Agnolotti with tomatoes, corn, and chanterelles\n\nCourse Two: Ballotine with grilled peaches, padron peppers, beans and basil \n\nCourse Three: Peach Shortcake with candied pecans, and cinnamon ice cream\n\nI think the above pictures really capture the kind of culinary dream One Market is. The restaurant serves gourmet food at a reasonable price, given its location in San Francisco. Sure, you could go to French Laundry and spend $300 on a meal. Or if you're feeling particularly adventurous, you could hop on over to Saison, and spends around $1200 per person. However, for those of us who are on a budget, I think One Market finds the perfect balance of offering an upscale, fine-dining experience, at a fair price. When you walk in you are kindly greeted by the host, as a pianist plays relaxing classical music in the background. The waiting staff is generally very friendly, and eager to answer any questions you have about the food. \n\nAs I mentioned earlier, every restaurant is fit for a different occasion. In my mind, One Market is the perfect spot to go for a relaxing (and savory) dinner. Many guests frequent the restaurant for business lunches as well, given its close proximity to the financial district. Regardless the occasion, I think you will be satisfied with your experience at One Market. It's my go-to spot in San Francisco :)", "author": "Andrew L."}

Enter One Market.  We had reservations booked on a Tuesday night at 6:30 and was seated immediately.  Service in the beginning was a bit slow though, as we waited 15 minutes before anyone came up to us and offered water and if we had decided what we wanted.\n\nFirst we started with some tater tots, brussel sprouts, and cauliflower.  Perfect complements to my main dish, which was the bacon wrapped pork tenderloin.  Mmmmmmm.....the portion was generous and man was it filling.  I don't think I remember having pork that was this chewy (not in a bad way!).\n\nWe also had a bottle of....oh shoot, I don't remember the name of the bottle of white wine...Oopsie....\n\nAnyways, the dark lit ambiance definitely makes this place a romantic worthy spot for future dinners.

The recent time I was there, I had the natural Angus flat iron steak with braised greens and mashed potatoes. Now that was damn good. Meat cooked perfectly (pink in the middle), juicy and very flavorful. The greens and the mashed were so deelish and everything just worked well together. \n\nOne Market is definitely a high-end restaurant for lunch, which is probably why I only go there when being treated by the company but I would love to check it out for dinner, maybe the next date-night with the Husband.", "author": "Resa N."}

Both the food and service were a solid 4 stars.\n\nI came in a party of 3 for lunch on a Tuesday at about 12:30. We had reservations, but it wasn't super crowded. We were seated immediately in a spacious booth.\n\nThere seemed to be a slight disconnect among the waiters, because two different people came by to take our drink orders and explain the specials; weirdly, they didn't both list the same specials (each of them told us 3, 2 of which they both listed, and 1 different one each). Anyway, they were both very nice and responsive.\n\nWe shared two appetizers: the chickpea fries, which were delicious, and the crab cakes, which were good, but not particularly memorable.\n\nFor my entree I had the \"grilled Tombo tuna salad,\" which is seared tuna (rare) served on a bed of chopped Granny Smith apples, cucumber, kohlrabi, and some spring greens (including edible flowers; it was really a beautiful dish). I thought the fish itself was pretty bland and boring, but the salad that it was on top of was great - very bright and summery.\n\nThey had a bunch of interesting sounding dishes on the menu that I had a hard time choosing between; if I go back (and if they have the same menu), I'd like to try the artichoke soup (which has \"garlic flan\" (??) and hazelnuts - would have ordered this today, but I thought the garlic might be a bit much for a business lunch ) and/or the \"thinly sliced lamb tongue\" (just because it sounds interesting).

Opened in the early '90's by the famed Larks Creek Inn owners, this was their second location aside from their now gone original Novato spot; Bradley Ogden who made his name at Campton Place headed the kitchen here.\nIt's been a long while (fifteen years) since my last meal here.  A business friend arranged for e lunch here on a recent Friday.  The main dining room has stood the time test though the tables seem more densely packed here.  The lunch menu is not particularly large but there is an ample selection to choose.  After a quick study, the lunch special was the most tempting.\nHere's what I had:\nAppetizer\n1) Shrimp salad (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=17XYtLuN8wcbqI15B3PSZg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - Normally, when I think of bay shrimp, briny, fishy little frozen ones come to mind.  These were deliciously crunchy and had no aftertaste.  Very refreshing and generous portions.\n\nEntree\n2) Pappardelle with lamb ragout (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=JKhBBRgrE08px3OVt6CtuQ&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - In total contrast to the salad, this was hearty, heavy, and rustic.  The noodles had a nice chew yet weren't too doughy and the sauce complemented it perfectly.  \n\nDessert (shared)\n3) Almond crunch cake (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=udj0DyolO-JskWvBNEAmSg&userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q) - This was the star of the show, especially considering I didn't have much expectations for a lunch dessert.  The almonds were crispy and fresh (in season) and the different texture and flavors really made for interesting bites.\n\nThe dining room was about 70% full and mostly with younger work groups.  Some enjoyed raw oysters and drinks while others were grabbing simple meals.  At $25.00 business deal lunch for two courses and a $5.00 supplement for dessert, this is certainly a reasonable deal especially given the location, atmosphere, and service.  The bread was a nice hunger curb considering it is a decent walk from the Financial District and Chinatown.  \nYes, will likely come back and definitely recommend if you are in the area.", "author": "Mike C."}

But after this week's dinner, we have decided never to go back anymore.  The food is mediocre, especially the sauce.  Actually we tried three main dishes (seafood and meats), and all seemed to have similar sauce  using fruits and were overly sweet.  These dishes completely lacked creativity or balance of flavors.  \nThe service was attentive but rushed.  In fact, the waitress never smiled for the entire evening.  She looked as if she was very unhappy to be there. \nThe worst is the mandatorily added service charge (used to be called tips).  Despite that we were only a group of 3, a mandatory service charge of 20% was added (by handwritten note directly on the printed bill) on top of all the taxes and SF surcharges. That was equivalent to 25% of the bill.  I felt this was a very sneaky practice on the part of the restaurant or waitress to force a tip out of us, knowing that their service was sub-par.  This is disgraceful.  A restaurant of the likes of One market does not need to be this desperate.", "author": "Kim L."}

Plus no mention that the 'strawberry cheesecake' was lemon flavored! And there was literally one small strawberry cut in half with less than a teaspoon of whipped cream on top! For $7.50.00 this was a sorry excuse for cheesecake! (It wasn't cheesecake guys!) no crust on the bottom really as well. So scrumptious and overthought...

I opted for the pig 4 course tasting menu and he had the 3 course prefix. I didn't have high expectations because of the average reviews but I wanted to give it a try to see if they are worth their Michelin star. I was pleasantly surprised and thought the meat is wonderfully done and the food simple but tasty. \n\nMy first course was a pork p\u00e2t\u00e9 and it was full flavored. I loved the warm bread that the restaurant serves. The pate was a country pate, with chunks and that was right up my alley. \n\nThe second course was a pork tenderloin. This is the star of the show. I've never had pork this tender and juicy. The texture is almost like a great cut of steak. I've had juicy pork before, but never a buttery texture as the tenderloin at one market. Drool!\n\nThe third course was a pork schnitzel. The dish was more like pork katsu, with a panko crust instead of the more traditional flour and egg batter. I liked it, but thought it needed some sauce to give it more flavor. \n\nThe dessert was the weakest course. The peach ice cream didn't go with the chocolate and caramel toppings. My favorite part was the pig shaped cookie crisp. The dish would have been much better if they used a vanilla or bourbon ice cream. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my experience at one market. The service is very white glove and the decor is nice. If you order the set menus, the price is also very reasonable. I would come back again", "author": "Alice W."}

I chose the little gems salad for my first course and we all went with the hangar steak for our second.  My family chose the chickpea soup for their first instead.  We noticed a note on the menu that if you dine exclusively from the Dine About Town menu that an 18% gratuity charge would be applied to your bill.  That's a little odd, especially for smaller groups like ours.  \n\nAfter placing our order, we were presented with my favorite bread....the Pain Epi from Acme!  OMG soo good!  Anywhoo, the little gems salad was adorned with blood oranges, fennel and radish and was small and a little tart for my liking, but not a bad salad.  They thought their chickpea soup was alright.  I thought the hangar steak cooked medium rare as requested was satisfying though.  Super tender, a good portion and had enough of that fatty flavor.  The swiss chard and the shallots were a good accompaniment as well.  Since we were celebrating my aunt's birthday we decided to pay $4 more to get her the meyer lemon cheesecake on the Dine About Town menu.  It came with a huckleberry compote, but was tiny.  I can't believe they charge twice the price for something so small on the regular menu.  The cheesecake needed the berry sauce since the lemon flavor was faint.    \n\nOne Market has a nice ambiance, good service though lunch can be at a leisurely pace, and the food from what I've experienced was good...not awful not great; though one of my co-workers loves this place and says that it's always consistent.  3.5 stars.", "author": "Cat C."}

Myself I went all out and had the New York Steak. **Excuse me** I had the -- 12 oz Creekstone All Natural Angus New York Steak -- fancy description and everything.\n\nIt was decent.\n\nBut you don't even have to know the price of that thing to know that you are most certainly paying for more than just \"decent' when you order that thing.

That thing had several, large, visible strips of fat coming off it. Lean indeed. \n\nThe garlic mashed potatoes were good. That's gotta be a whole star by itself right there...\n\n...which bring it up to three (3) total. And that's all she wrote folks. \n\nSeriously for that price, I'm just not sure.

The tongue was surprising good and this was the comment from my girlfriend who 1) has never had lamb tongue before and 2) is a food critic in her own rights. The Caesar salad was served very crisp, just correctly dressed and not overrun with crotons nor Parmesan. \n\nFor the main course, my girlfriend ordered the Liberty Farm duck breast and andouille sausage. I ordered the grilled pork chops over collard greens and corn polenta. The duck breast was one of the most tender piece of duck I've ever had! The pork chop was grilled to perfection. \n\nFor dessert, we ended with the Valhorna white chocolate cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche panna cotta and flourless chocolate souffl\u00e9 cake. Both were delicious and were quickly dispatched into our roomless tummies.\n\nService was excellent throughout the meal. I can't wait to go back and try some more food!", "author": "Tony L."}

It is not a surprise to me that they are a Michelin Star Rated Restaurant. The food is always delicious and beautifully presented, and the service is always impeccable. \n\nIn Financial District and at the foot of Market Street, with the historic Ferry Building in view and the streetcars passing by, it is not surprising that most of the diners are in their power suits. I have witnessed a few job interviews held and business deals closed during my visits -- yes, they do make for great business people-watching. Do keep this in mind when you plan to dine: this is not a shirt-and-flip-flop kind of restaurant. I never felt that they are snobby, though. \n\nToday, we visited during Dine About Town (really a great deal: $18.95 for a starter and an entr\u00e9e, and additional $4 for dessert). We wanted to taste everything. As a result, we ordered the little gem salad and the sweet potato soup for our starters; the cod, the pot roast, and the gnocchi for our main courses; and the chocolate cream parfait and the upside down cake for our dessert.\n\nThe Little Gem Salad was a delightful start to the meal, with the cherries and blue cheese combination giving the salad a wonderful flavor. The Sweet Potato Soup proved to be disappointing, however. The ginger and shiso were too overpowering that the taste of sweet potato was almost nonexistent. The oranges did give the soup a refreshing note.\n\nThe Pan-seared True Cod was perfectly cooked - with the crust perfectly crisped and the meat perfectly flaky. The piquillo peppers was delicious in combination with the squash and perfectly complemented the light flavor of the fish. The Pot Roast seemed to satisfy my dining companions as the words \"phenomenal\" and \"very tasty\" were thrown around quite a bit. Finally, the House-Made Potato Gnocchi was really delightful, with its perfectly balanced mushroom and parmesan flavors.\n\nFor dessert, the clear winner was the Blueberry-Coconut \"Upside Down\" Cake. I am not normally a big fan of coconut cake because I find it to be too sweet, but the tartness of the blueberries and the richness of the vanilla bean ice cream perfectly counterbalanced the sweetness of the cake. The Valrhona Chocolate Cream Parfait was also rich, delicious, and not too sweet. It was very good, but the upside down cake outshone it easily.\n\nI have always and will always be a fan of One Market. I highly recommend you try them when you are in San Francisco.", "author": "Clarice O."}

We had reservations for 6:45 pm, but arrived about half an hour early, and they were able to seat us without a problem. \n\nI liked the open floor plan, and the view into the area where they grill the meat. It was interesting to watch the process. One Market clearly is a bit more formal/upscale than most S.F. restaurants -- suits and ties for the vast majority of men -- but they didn't bat an eye at my attire of jeans and a V-neck sweater.\n\nThe food was extremely good. We had the chick pea fries with harissa aioli as an app, which were delicious. Sort of super-thick cut fries with the texture of polenta inside. A very filling app for two people; highly recommended! Both entrees were also very nice -- I had the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin with dandelion \"persillade,\" salsify and natural jus, and my wife had the pan-seared day boat scallops with artichokes, olive oil mashed potatoes and lobster emulsion. Note that the pork comes medium rare -- which is the chef's preference -- which was fine, even though I normally would order it medium.  The desert was also very good, something chocolate, but I don't recall now exactly what it was.\n\nThe only minor blemish on the meal were the drinks. The Smokey Cuban\n(Appleton Rum, Sombra Mezcal, lime juice, simple syrup, Angostura bitters and prosecco) was just mediocre -- the Mezcal was too dominating -- and overpriced at $13. In hindsight, I should have had the Moscow Mule. My wife had the Outofbeer Sauvignon Blanc, which was fine at first, but on ordering a second glass she had a bad reaction to it.", "author": "Andy S."}

Granted it's beautifully located near the Ferry Building and is a scene for power lunches (do come dressed to the nines), however, the food is uninspiring. The best parts of my meal were the oysters and dessert. \n\nToday, I came to One Market for lunch at 1 PM after it had been on my list for a while. Luckily, I was able to snag reservations (recommended) 2 hours prior. We were seated in a booth facing the Ferry Building with waterfront views. \n\nD R I N K S \nDOLLAR LUNCH MARTINI: $1 Hendrick's or Stolichnaya Vodka from 11:30 AM - 2 PM (limit 2 per an entr\u00e9e ordered)\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=5k_OMwO0zMJWSmCj-XzwCA\nAs a Hendrick's Gin lover, I was dancing in my seat...LITERALLY!

The mignonette gave it a pop of tang while the cocktail sauce gave it a spicy bite. \n\n*NATURAL ANGUS FLAT IRON STEAK w/ Bay Leaf, Green Peppercorn Sauce ($21.50) - 2.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=pp5rKXLcCntC4UYMfHQDSw\nFirst things first, presentation was lacking. I eat with my eyes first and the way the dish was presented didn't make me want to dive into my plate even though I was starving. Though requested medium rare, only two of the four slices were cooked to order; the other slices were more a medium well. The steak was chewy and not seasoned properly; it was bland to be exact. Very disappointing especially when I've dined at Lark Creek Steak at least 8 times and have always enjoyed my steaks there. \n\n*CHICKPEA FRIES w/ Harissa Aioli - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=YLrZGp_vIpT7g7zi0G59kg\nDusted with cornmeal and then lightly fried, the chickpea fries were lightly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. The harissa aioli added a creamy spice to the fries. If you like hummus, you will enjoy the chickpea fries. \n\n*BRADLEY'S BUTTERSCOTCH PUDDING w/ Chantilly Cream and Pecan Wedding Cookie ($5.75) - 5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=esDn_-tXz7bkT_-lb9EU8Q\nAfter seeing that One Market had a similar butterscotch pudding to Lark Creek Steak on the menu, I WAS SOLD!. The butterscotch pudding totally redeemed the lackluster steak. It ain't the Jello snack puddings I grew up on as a kid. Seamlessly smooth and velvety rich, the butterscotch pudding had a luxurious sweetness. The Chantilly cream added a nice fluffiness with an extra oomph of creaminess. One of the most decadent, yet light refined desserts. MUST ORDER. \n\nS E R V I C E\nProfessional, attentive, and slightly pretentious (to be expected). Before I saw the dollar lunch martini, I told our waiter I like Hendrick's and he came back with the Aviator (Gin, Maraschino Liqueur, Cr\u00e8me de Violette & Lemon Juice) and it had the perfect balance of alcohol to tang to slight sweetness. Brownie points for a guy who knows how a lady likes her liquor. \n\nFood took awhile to come out so unless you have at least 1.5 hours for lunch, go elsewhere. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nSimple elegance; crisp white lined tables, wooden panel furnishings, and waterfront views. This is where the attorneys and investment bankers come for their power lunches. Dinner would be nice for intimate dates and/or to celebrate a special occasion. \n\nP A R K I N G\nRelatively easy street parking before 6 PM. Valet is $10. \n\nUnless I'm rolling around in a bed of Benjamins which will probably never happen, I doubt I would come back.

I felt bad to waste the extra food but unfortunately I couldn't take it home with me! There are additional menu choices on Thanksgiving too.. my father in law really enjoyed the pork loin dinner (it had a more reasonable portion than the turkey). \n\nDefinitely make a reservation if you are heading in for the TG holiday.. otherwise you probably won't get a table. We got lucky and someone canceled last minute so we were able to make reservations a few days in advance. Also, the booth tables by the windows are much nicer than sitting in the middle.

We never made it to Tahoe, So I blame the tasting menu from keeping me from snowboarding :)\n\nThe ex at the time worked in the area and had always wanted to go here, so we made resys and were sat along the bank of two tops. We sat next to a couple that were also doing the tasting menu and they were having a fabulous time. We got talking with them about food and service and we could tell we were going to be happy. So the meal consisted of:\n\n-Duck liver mousse, quinoa tabbouleh, pickled cauliflowers and carrots\n-Golden lentil soup, vadouvan, yogurt\n-Red wine risotto, duck confit, gizzard, chicory\n-Roasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast duck leg crepinette, cilantro, sweet potato, chocolate\n-Spit-roasted Berkshire pork loin, fennel, apple, potato puree, cider\n-Valrhona chocolate souffl\u00e9 cake, chocolate-banana ice cream, chocolate malt cream\n\nTasty all around.

One Market Restaurant fit this criteria! I wasn't expecting much since this place has 3.5 stars on Yelp, and because most people said this is mostly a place for Business lunches. However, this place very much exceeded everyone's expectations!\n\nTo be honest, we were all very late for our reservation. It was originally for 6:45pm on a Friday night, and we didn't get there until 7:15pm. Traffic was awful downtown, just in case you'll be in that situation.  However, they were very accommodating and still sat us regardless. They weren't even irritated by it! Perhaps it happens often.\n\nWe ordered 4 appetizers. Everyone loved everything. The quality was very impressive. My favorites were the veal tartare and the Duck Frisee Salad. Yum....they were devoured in minutes! Small side note - even the comp bread was good. It came warm, and had the perfect chewiness.\n\nI got the Red Snapper. The waiter said he liked this one a lot, so I wanted to try it. The fish was so amazing! The flavors were perfect. The snapper can be plain, but with the celery root risotto, and blood orange, it was full of flavor. It was saucy, but only as much to complement the dish. I would DEFINITELY recommend this fish. I couldn't believe how great it was.\n\nI remember we got 2 desserts, but can't remember what they were. Guess I was too drunk by then. But, I do remember that they wrote \"Happy Birthday Frances\" on the plate in chocolate, which was super sweet. Usually places just say \"congratulations\" or \"happy birthday\" with no name. But adding the name made it more special! Thank you One Market!\n\nFor 4 appetizers, 5 entrees, 2 desserts, the price came out to 62/person. Not bad! I will definitely be back. I don't know why everyone gives this place an average score. It deserves way better than that!\n\nThe service was great.

They were able to get us a window table looking out at the bay on a Saturday night with only an hour's notice - which probably should have been my first clue as to what was going to happen for the rest of our One Market experience.\n\nWe were properly greeted and seated right away.  The waiter got us our drinks (both wines and cocktails for the 4 of us) in appropriate fashion.  The busboy got us our water without ice, per our request.  The waiter came back and got our order....things seemed fine.  And then we did not see our waiter for over 40 minutes - as in we saw him in the dining room at other tables, but not ours.  We completely ran out of water - no bus boy came by to refill them - the entire meal!  We ran out of cocktails and wine - no one even came by let along asked us if we wanted anything else.  The restaurant was not full - so it wasn't that they were swamped. \n\nWhen our meals finally arrived at about 45 minutes wait, another busboy delivered our food - not the waiter. The two fish meals were very hot, the lobster was warm but not hot, and the smoked brisket was on a hot plate - but the meat was barely warm.  There also was only a butter knife with the fork and napkin at the table.  Admittedly one could cut this meat with a butter knife -  the concept of a steak knife with beef is a reasonable presentation.  I couldn't eat this super fatty meat cold - and the waiter at that time buzzed over to ask how everything was, and I told him I needed the meat to be heated - it was whisked away by a busboy and returned about 12 minutes later by a busboy -- after our friends had finished most of their main courses.  I then ate my main dish - which over 1/3 of the two small pieces of meat were fat, so it really was not much meat.  NOTE- neither the waiter of the bus boys filled our water glasses at this point, nor were we asked if we would like another glass of wine or cocktail.  Nor was there an apology that the meat was cold or that it took them so long to get me a hot meal. Shameful!\n\nThe two fish dinners were both tasty and hot.  The Maine lobster however was cut in such a way that the meat was all stringy, including cutting the tail in half the long way, which I think should always be left as a whole.  Sadly it had virtually no taste at all and was one of the most expensive entree items on the menu at around $50.  The menu is al la carte - and we had brussel sprouts, Caesar salad, and mash potatoes as sides - which were all good but not great.\n\nWaiter brought desert menu, and hopefully he heard me as he stood behind our table - when I said, I am not giving these people another dime of my money, let's go somewhere else for desert and night cap.  We paid for our meal (no adjustments made for cold food and delay) and out we went - the first couple passed by the front desk and no one even acknowledge them - as the 3 people at the reception desk were all chatting with each other.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-05", "description": "I booked a reservation at One Market for a holiday family dinner- and wished I had taken reservations at House of Prime Rib, or Farallon, or State Bird Provisions instead. The farm-to-table food/drinks are well-prepared, the service is low-key, and the location/decor is beyond reproach, but One Market feels more appropriate for power lunching than for a family get-together. There's nothing intimate or romantic about the dining experience, and the dining room is loud, loud loud (!) to boot. \n\nOne Market also feels dated. The menu, which hasn't changed in a decade, reads like a throwback to a nostalgic time period when Ahi tuna, lemongrass skewers, and popped collars were cool. Pan-seared scallops, NY strip steak, risotto with walnuts (walnuts? walnuts??), brussel sprouts with bacon, and baked potato amuse bouches may delight your palate, but not your imagination. Reading the menu was yawn-inducing, and my table didn't bother ordering the tasting menu because nothing piqued our interest.\n\nHowever, our potato rosti \"mi cuit\" appetizer, along with our charcuterie plate, were textbook perfect, with all flavors mingling, yet carrying their own weight on the plates.I ordered the roasted lamb with (delightful!) mushrooms persillade, (uninspiring) snails and honeyed farro. My lamb was perfectly cooked to order, but I made the mistake of ordering it rare. The texture of rare lamb, combined with al dente farro, made for a dish that could only be described as ... chewy. The combination of farro and lamb would have been excellent if I ordered the lamb medium rare. My sister's roasted monkfish was also perfectly cooked, but served alongside a plateful of mealy corona beans. One Market does protein unimpeachably well- accompaniments however, will vary in quality and marriage with the rest of the plate. \n\nI'd also skip dessert- the flourless Valrhona chocolate souffle cake (yawn) was rich and dense without being too sweet, but the gingerbread with cider-glazed quince, candied walnuts and maple cream is a dessert probably better made and enjoyed in the comforts of your own home. If you feel like lingering, the French press coffee and digestifs are much better choices. Housemade vanilla bean caramels are a nice (but yawny) surprise that appear with your bill. \n\nGiven the obvious talent of the chef, it'd be so interesting to see One Market modernize its menu; as it exists, I probably wouldn't return unless I was on the expense account of one of the aforementioned power lunchers (but then, gladly! Because a free lunch is always a lunch I am into :) )", "author": "Tianyi S."}

But presentation and service had me rate this place higher, but for a michelin star, I would've expected more.\n\nCalled the restaurant 5 minutes to our Open Table reservation as we were stuck in traffic, and they were very nice and understanding. We arrived 15 minutes later, and the restaurant is way bigger than I had thought! It was also nice as they have curtains at the entrance, to keep the SF wind out of the restaurant. The bar area was nice, and a piano player playing the entire time.\n\nI could see the open kitchen, and people dining around them as well. Very cool. We were seated at the end of the front restaurant, at a slightly odd table (instead of sitting across from each other, my friend was to my left).\n\nThey had the 2 Dine About Town menus, and a special one for the weekend, that looked really good, and at a reasonable price. They also had the Chef's Tasting Menu that looked like a good deal too. However, we went with the Dine About Town 3 course prix-fixe menu, and added the wine pairing for $14. Our server was nice and let us switch out the red wine for a white that would complement our entree. We had a glass of sauvignon blanc in the beginning, which was very crisp and nice. The chardonnay we were given with our entree, was a bit buttery, and we definitley enjoyed the sauvignon blanc better.\n\nWe were brought an amuse bouche, a tiny baked potato with caviar on top. It was delicious and so cute, I almost didn't want to eat it! We then asked for bread, which was freshly brought. They didn't seem to give us a choice though, one pain epi for my friend, an olive sourdough bread for me. And no butter. I asked for butter, and it was brought promptly. I enjoyed the pain epi more, which my friend shared with me, and then our appetizer of chickpea fries was brought (we ordered this on top of the 3 course menu). Chickpea fries were nice and hot, and it reminded me of hummus and falafels. Enjoyed the aioli sauce it came with too. A lot more than I had imagined them to give us, and by the time I filled up on my carbs, I was full! Ack, and I had 3 courses to go!\n\nThe steak tartare was delicious, enjoyed the kick it had, and the capers and raw quail egg on top. They also give you toasted bread to put it on too. Ack, more carbs! I didn't care for the parsley salad it came with though. Next, came our entrees, the braised pork short ribs. It came with farro, cabbage, and mustard seeds. A good sized portion, and really, I was way too full at this point, that I could only eat a few bites. It was very tender, although some of the outer parts were dry. A good amount of fat came off the bones too. It was my first time trying farro, and I didn't care too much for it, as healthy as it is. My friend and I agreed that this dish would be complete if there were more vegetables accompanied with the dish. We also both ordered the ricotta cake with blood oranges. It came with honey frozen yogurt on top, and was yummy! We had asked for one in a to go box, as there was no way we would be able to finish both, and since I had noted it was my friend's birthday, they brought it out with a candle and Happy Birthday written in chocolate. The cake was super moist, and a good compliment with the frozen yogurt and blood oranges.\n\nOverall, a great meal and time here. Glad Dine About Town brought me here.", "author": "Denise L."}

I thought that the service was pretty top-notch and that none of us were ever really left wanting for anything -- be it food, drink or anything else One Market could provide us with.\n\nOur table had a horrible wobble to it, though, and it took our waiters several minutes to fix it, but they were very prompt and apologetic that it wasn't as perfect as it could be. As if I would complain at that point! At least they were ready and willing to fix it immediately.\n\nI decidedly did NOT like the famer's market salad that they brought out, but I'm also generally not a fan of salads period. The vinaigrette was a bit too strong for me (and that's saying something because I usually have no problems with vinegar), and I didn't like the taste of the greens. Give me the main course already!\n\nI had the vegetarian option for lunch, which was the mushroom risotto (changed from the mushroom ravioli that it was going to be). I honestly thought that the risotto was amazing. Creamy and filling without being too runny or weirdly thick. The pieces of mushroom added a nice texture and color to the dish as well. Boyfriend's steak was a little tough to chew, but I felt that it was overall pretty good, too. I liked the flavor, though cutting the meat proved to be a little difficult too (probably had to do with the chewiness of the meat as well if I had to guess).\n\nThe dessert was VERY rich. Too rich to the point that I couldn't finish it. But that's not necessarily a knock. I just wish we could've had something with the dish to cut the thickness of how sweet the cake was.\n\nOverall, I would say it was a pretty fun experience (aided, no doubt, by the fact that we had a pretty ridiculous open bar). I've never been here otherwise, so I can't say what service is like on any regular old day, though I've heard lunch here can be pretty pricey for what it is.

Out of the 10 of us in the group, half of us decided to do the Weekly Beast, while some ordered a la carte. I would definitely have to say that part of the experience is always about the company that you're with. Everyone that was at dinner did add to the experience. One of the guys who joined us, only went because of the company. If it were up to him, he had been to One Market a few times before and wasn't that impressed.\n\nAs we waited for the whole party to arrived, we wetted our appetites with a couple of appetizers: Pan Seared Foie Gras and Grilled Octopus. (If you've read any of my recent posts, you will have noticed that octopus has been a recent theme and it's all about trying to match the experience of that one amazing octopus dish, but that has yet to happen). Although some people may say that foie is just foie and that you can only have so much of it, this preparation was delicious, particularly because of the Duck Dashi that it was served with. It was soo good that we took our bread to sop up every last bit of the dashi.\n\nHonestly, I was kinda full after the two appetizers and some wine, but decided to order the Weekly Beast anyway. This particular week was a pork menu. The first course was a grilled pork with a Vietnamese flavor. It was a thin piece of pork, with good grill marks and great flavor. I don't know how I managed to finish that course and continue, because it was a substantial portion. Unfortunately, that was probably the best of the three courses that I had. We moved on to the second course which consisted of a pork loin. It was prepared well, but just not that exciting, especially compared to the Duck Breast that was on the plate of the person sitting next to me. The duck was very juicy and tender, and I think the vote at the table was that that was one of the best entrees. Then was dessert. I don't remember what it was that I had, but it wasn't that memorable. The part that I enjoyed the most was the garnish, a thin piece of chocolate in the shape of a pig (which I think are the cutest!)\n\nSo for a $49 tasting menu, meh...I'd rather eat off the regular menu.", "author": "Audrey C."}

The server was very rude by giving us the attitude when we were using the GIFT CARD!\n\nI went to One Market few days before New years eve, and it was THE WORST experience Ive ever had.

What a service already!\n\n2. Then my mom and I ordered 3 - course meal, and yes we never got the dessert. \n-After we finished the main course, we told our server that we were ready for the dessert (that was included 3 course meal!). But instead of giving us the dessert (as we ordered in 3 course), he brought the dessert menu. We were so confused, but ordered anyways because he did not say anything, so we assume this was how 3 course meal dessert was given.... No info was given. AGAIN!\n- Obviously, on our check, there was 2 dessert we ordered. I do not understand why we never got the dessert that was already included in our 3 course meal. (or do they count soup + main course as THREE COURSE MEAL?) I wonder...  (I tried to call the server, but he just disappeared after... I guess he really wanted to go home, since it was officially closed?10pm? I do not know)\n\n3. Then when we asked for a check, we told the server we would like to use the gift card. Oh gosh...

Traffic getting into downtown SF was like a bad horror movie that I couldn't escape from.  I was running 15 minutes late for my lunch so I decided to splurge and do valet parking for $15-certainly not inexpensive-but then again, after the morning I was having, I would have paid twice as much just to get out of the car, get some food in my stomach and spend some quality time with a dear friend. \n\nWithin the span of 90 minutes, I was transformed from grumpy, hungry,frazzled business woman, to calm, relaxed, and satisfied woman.\n\nQuality food, service and ambiance are three must-have's when I dine out.  One Market excels at all three.  First the food.  I've been going to One Market ever since it opened and always enjoy dining there.  Some how it's managed to withstand the test of time.  \n\nWe started our lunch off with a free sample of a beet carpaccio type dish with a dollop of chevre cheese that was out of this world. That was followed by a delicious Kabocha Squash Soup with pickled apples, toasted hazelnut and spiced cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche.  It was the perfect texture, and the waiter was kind enough to split the bowl for my guest and I.  For beverages we both enjoyed a fresh glass of lemonade with a hint of ginger and pineapple.  It was so refreshing and a nice alternative to a glass of wine.  For main entree I ordered the Ahi Tuna burger that was cooked to perfection with mizuna & shaved fennel salad, saffron aioli.  I prefer my Ahi rare to medium-rare and that was exactly how it was served.  My guest ordered the Wild Gulf Shrimp \"Louis\".  It was a work of art. It was a unique presentation in that the salad was skillfully wrapped in four separate romaine of hearts circles bound together and topped with avocado and quail eggs.  Wow! Be sure to ask for some of the delicious fresh bread they serve.  One Market does not automatically bring bread anymore so be sure to ask for it.  I wish we had time for dessert but unfortunately we didn't.  The food continues to be consistently good at One Market.  I'm getting hungry just writing this review!\n\nService.  I'm a bit of a stickler when it comes to service.  SF restaurants are pricey.  My expectations of good service have increased in tandem with today's restaurant prices. I can't say enough about the service.  Our waiter, I believe his name was Ilsandro (hope I got this right?), was outstanding. He had a very pleasant demeanor, he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and he was so friendly and easy to communicate with.  In fact, the next time I return, I would ask to be sat in his section he was that good.  One thing in particular that I appreciated was that he told us while reviewing the menu and specials, that they were out of the house-made Pappardelle with rock shrimp and lobster sauce.  A pet peeve of mine is when a food server does NOT inform you of the dishes they are out of until you're about to order.  Tell the customer what you're out of in ADVANCE-at the time you present the menu-not at the time you're ready to order and have your heart set on a particular menu item. Thank you Ilsandro!\n\nLastly, Ambiance. One of the many reasons I enjoy One Market so much (aside from the food) is the ambiance-big, sky-high ceilings so the acoustics are good.  You can actually have a conversation and hear the other person talking.  There is some privacy between tables.\n\nAll in all, the quality food, excellent service and soothing ambiance are what lead me to give it a 5-star rating.  I walked out of the restaurant feeling 100% better than before I walked in.  It's incredible that a good meal with one of my best girlfriends can transform my day (and me) from one of frustration to one of gratitude and appreciation for the simple pleasures in life.", "author": "Suzanne H."}

I liked them all and the service was fantastic waiters coming by every 60 seconds with something new. \n\nThen into a salad. I don't remember much other than it had blue cheese and was really good. \n\nThen the best part: the steak! That was impressive. Usually group dinner steaks are terrible. Everything gets cooked medium and they often sit under headlamps getting dry as 100 other steaks are made. \n\nNot the case here. Great flavorful steak. \n\nI should also point out most restaurants and steakhouses fail to impress me - I bought a $3000 piece of lab equipment called an immersion circulator - also know as Souis Vide.  So I can make a damn good steak at home. \n\nLast came an excellent dessert. A pear tart. \n\nAlso the wine they served was excellent and my glass never got empty.

They were trying the Dine About Town option, which seemed decent. I didn't feel like having pork chop, fish, or gnudi, so I ended up getting a hamburger. I have eaten all kinds of hamburgers in my life, but I hadn't had one in a while. I got it medium rare for some reason, and it was too rare in some parts. I liked it. It came with cole slaw and potato tots. I would come here again and try something more adventurous. I also got a lemonade, which was overpriced at 4.75. They made it slushy.

I was with a large group so I got to try a few different appetizers, and saw most of the entree's.  The steak looked like the best option if you're hungry.  I went with an off-the-menu special which was a veal water buffalo.  I'd give that 4.5-5 stars all by itself.  It was great!  However, let me back up to the appetizers.  Now that foie gras is legal again in SF they had it on the menu, so I had to try it.  It was good, but not great.  It was over seared and the arrangement didn't pop.  For a $25 starter I expected more flavor.  Maybe I'm just comparing their foie to the incredible foie I had at another restaurant in SOMA the night before.  Given 4.5 stars for the entree and 2.5 stars for the appetizer I'll average that to be 3 stars.\n\nNow for the wine list.  It was good diversification for a place that's not specifically known for wine.  They had several of the staples that you'd expect from known California wineries as well as a few of the more \"specialized\" wineries that aren't as common to see on a wine list.  The prices, well...they were restaurant prices and given the location of this restaurant they weren't 2x of retail they were 3x of retail.  Not unexpected given the location.  I did have one bottle that was corked and the waitress promptly replaced it with another one that was fine (same vintage and producer) as you'd expect.\n\nThe service was ok.  They were pretty slammed when my party of 8 got there.  However, given the amount we spent I would have expected a soda faster than 10 minutes.  \n\nFinally, just FYI...due the size of my group I fully expected gratuity to be on the ticket however it wasn't.  I'm glad we checked instead of just assuming gratuity would be added on for the size of our group.  I'm not sure if our group was too small for auto-gratuity or if it was just overlooked.  We wanted to take care of the waitress appropriately for the service.", "author": "Ben F."}

Sadly, two of the three courses were a bit of a disappointment. I had the carrot soup, the pork tenderloin, and the mint ice cream sandwich. The soup was overpowering, and I felt like I was drowning in excessive amounts of Chinese five spice. The bacon wrapped pork tenderloin was excellent. It was on a bed of spinach and very tender, cooked perfectly. The ice cream sandwich was sandwiched between two excellent cookies, but the ice cream itself was way to \"minty.\"  \n\nThe warm bread was delicious, and the beer on tap was very cold and went down great.

Plus, thanks to their July wine promotion, a $55 bottle of massive Cabernet Franc that would cost more than $55 if you bought it at the store. \n\nHow good was this? It was so good we decided to walk a mile and a half back home instead of taking the cab, and the world sparkled with wonderment, I felt elevated.\n\nThis isn't the first time it happened, of my 5-10 dinners here, at least three of them were elevated experiences like this.\n\nFirst, you have to understand the Weekly Beast. It's a moderately-priced fixed-course meal offered on certain saturdays and sundays ($49 for 4 courses, half the price or less compared to similar offerings) based on their acquiring one big animal or several smaller ones from a local farm. The chef then designs an entire menu around that, using all kinds and parts of the animal. But he goes beyond that, he kind of imagines some cuisine, whether Moroccan, Mexican, Japanese, you can never tell what he's going to do, but all in a high end French style.\n\nThe regular menu is a lot more expensive, price and concept are midway between casual fancy places like Zuni or Slanted Door, and higher end places like Gary Danko, Saison, or Coi. $100 / person seems about right here.\n\nThis is food that goes a step beyond, it has the magic dust of inspiration, like a music concert or a tour of a museum it makes you think. Unlike some other restaurants that make art out of food, everything here was professional and accommodating, food was tasty, portions were ample!\n\nThe location and decor are epic, basically big windows overlooking the Bay and the Bay Bridge. Fancy, white tablecloth. Most people are a little older here, some in their 30s, many in their 50s and 60s. \n\nService is a little funky. The waiters are all experienced veterans, but a number of them (including ours tonight) let a little too much personality hang out, just a little TMI with your meal. But a special shout-out to the host stand and one of the best hosts in SF, and a great wine director here too.", "author": "Gil S."}

Or, worse, making me feel like I'm inconveniencing them. I made a reservation for 8 while in town for a trade show. I had to call them back because some people canceled on me. I called once right away to change to 7. About 45 minutes before the reservation, I called again when another team member canceled on me and I changed it to 6 people. When we arrived, the hostess was full of attitude, \"It will be a wait. We have to reconfigure the tables and that takes time.\" Once seated, we waited over 10 minutes until we had to interrupt a server walking by to get our waiter so we could order drinks. It just felt like they were annoyed with us. And the restaurant was not full. \n\nThe menu was quite limited and expensive for the quality and quantity of the food. Vegetarian options were minimal for our one vegetarian guest. I had the rabbit pot pie and it was fine but nothing exceptional. After dinner the waiter dropped off the check and I reserved an Uber. The waiter disappeared for some time and we were all waiting to pay the check so we could go. The Uber arrived and I had still not seen our waiter come back to take our check.

I had been meaning to try here, but it was always hard to justify paying that much money for lunch and there are too many better places in the area for dinner.  Anyway, there were four of at the table (two of them were our interview candidates, so it was sort of a tenuous situation), but we ordered two appetizers to share and everyone got their own meal.  We ordered the following:\n\nAppetizers:\n-Lightly Smoked Tasmanian Ocean Trout \"Mi Cuit\" potato r\u00f8sti, pancetta vinaigrette, pastured chicken egg: I'm actually not a big fan of trout, so I sort of freaked out and ended up just eating the pancetta on the plate.  It wasn't much, but everyone at the table thought it was incredible.  I should note that the reason we got this was because they had run out of their crab cakes that day.  It's 12:30pm in prime lunch hour and you've run out a signature item?  There's something not right with that.  Our waiter kept coming back to this item, so we caved and ended up with this.  \n\n-Oysters on the Half Shell: YUM YUM YUM.  Usually I'm not a big fan of fishy slimy things, but I adore oysters, especially when there's a great sauce or garnish to go with it.  I really enjoyed their couple of sauce options that came out on the beautifully presented plate.  We each had one, but I was secretly wishing that someone would pass on their oyster.\n\nMains:\n-Roasted All Natural Half Chicken braised cipollini, chicken jus with a side of Roasted Brussels Sprouts Applewood Smoked Bacon: To be totally honest, I enjoyed the brussel sprouts more than the chicken.  I mean these brussel sprouts were cooked to where they were slightly crispy and cooked in the bacon.  I mean, I could go on and on about how awesome these things were.  Ultimately, I finished the brussel sprouts when I couldn't really finish all the chicken.  The chicken itself was moist with great skin, but, and maybe this was my fault, it was just chicken.\n\n-Two people ordered the Grilled Salmon:  The piece of fish was presented PERFECTLY on the plate.  I didn't get to try it, but it looked beautiful.  Both people finished their plates.\n\n-House-Made Potato Gnocchi Liberty Farms duck leg, yellow foot chanterelles, natural jus: This was my second choice from a food perspective, and when it came out, I was slightly envious.  My co-worker said that the duck was absolutely delicious and the gnocchi was cooked perfectly.  Next time, I'd be interested in trying this dish.\n\nThe service here was OK, I wasn't sure about our waiter who seemed a little pushy on getting us to order more things.  Ultimately, we were able to have our time to talk to each other uninterrupted and it turned out to being a pretty good meal.  I'm not sure if I'd go back, but I certainly think that for a business lunch, it was perfect.", "author": "Lisa I."}

First time trying a Michelin starred restaurant, so DAT gave me a reason to go. \n\nUnfortunately, I was not impressed with the food. They had two DAT menus, I went with the deluxe one with crab soup, duck breast with foie gras sausage, and panna cotta. I added wine pairing to my dinner as well. If I'm going to try a Michelin starred place, and if the prices are reasonable for my to splurge, why not add in the wine pairing to enhance the food?\n\nThe crab soup was very rich and creamy, but presentation wasn't that incredible. My date and I ordered the same soup, yet my server poured the soup over my butter, which spreads all around the soup. It didn't look pretty under the camera lens. The tastes saved its face.\n\nMy entree, the seared duck breast with foie gras sausage, was very disappointing. I've had better ones at  Isa. The duck breast here was a bit tough to chew, and wasn't as rare as it should have been. The sauce was a bit too sweet for the dish, it was a bit overwhelming and took away the spotlight of the main ingredient itself. Perhaps it may be the pricing of the DAT menus, but that foie gras sausage was a waste. It tasted just like a regular sausage except in cubic form. It wasn't anything eye opening in terms of tastes and presentation.\n\nMy panna cotta dessert looked very cute, with wafers here and there. That was the best part of it all. Portions were huge. I could only finish half of the dessert. It was rich and tarty at the same time, odd but that's how it is. Richness came from the creamy portion of the panna cotta, and the tart came from the fruits and syrup on the side. \n\nWine pairing wasn't too great. Maybe I was too inexperienced with wines, but my meal wasn't enhanced by the wine in any way. Also, they paired all the foods with the same wines. Again, not experienced enough to know if that worked well. But I doubt I would want to do the wine pairing next time.\n\nDAT was a nightmare.

To break it down, here's how my evening here went from great to down the drain in a matter of 2.5 hours.\n\nFood:\nI opted for the Sunchoke Veloute, Grilled Berkshire Pork Chops, and the Carrot Cake Cheesecake.\n- They were all really good, but my favorite by far were the pork chops. They were cooked to perfection and were covered in a really good sauce. The pork pretty much melted in my mouth, which is rare because being able to make a slab of pork that thick tender and well-marinated can be a pretty difficult task.\n\nNow, on to the service.\n\nInitially, the service seemed great. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. But as our meal progressed, it seemed as if she had just stopped paying attention to our table. For example, we were out of bread and water, and after 10 minutes of waiting for her to ask us if we wanted more, we ended up just asking ourselves. We ended up asking 3 different waiters/waitresses and waiting about TWENTY MINUTES until we actually got more bread and water. Are you kidding me??? We also sat there for another 15 minutes AFTER we finished our dessert to ask for the bill. I don't know how they were trained, but from common sense if you see your table has completely finished their meals, wouldn't you ask them if they would like the check?\n\nThe thing that blew my last straw was that on our way out, 3 members of the staff were standing there at the podium, and as they were watching us walk out the door, they didn't even bother to say thank you, or any words at all.\n\nYeah, your food is awesome, props to your chefs, but I'm pretty appalled by the lack of good customer service skills from a restaurant that was awarded a Michelin star.", "author": "Angela K."}

Both dinners were top notch, definitely a 4-star, Michelin experience. Lunch, on the other hand, was just ok. Still good, but definitely not as good as dinner and it didn't come off to my coworkers (who are foodies) like a Michelin-rated place or anything impressive. Maybe it's just the lunch menu.\n\nHere's what's deelish (from dinner):\n-Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin - I've had this twice, both times it was pretty bomb\n-Hand picked dungenous crab - i remember this being particularly good/fresh. we ended up ordering a second one!\n-Pumpkin cheesecake with brittled pepitas - I've had this twice, BOMB.COM award winner. I will be be back for it this fall!\n\nI've also had the tuna tombo salad at lunch time (solid, didn't blow my mind), shrimp bisque (it was decent; had sort of a southern flavor), and sides like the chickpea frieds (pretty good), tater tots (ok), and spinach (ok).\n\nI def recommend it for dinner!

They also provide a level of service (professional, yet friendly) that's every bit as good with the food.\n\nDuring our visit today, we just couldn't decide which part of our lunch was the best. It was all so amazing that it was impossible to pick and dish that you wouldn't go back for over and over.\n\nWe started with crab cakes that contained no filler. They were simply crab, butter and some herbs. They were by far the best crab cakes I've ever had and is from someone who used to live in Seattle, where there's no shortage of excellent seafood. We also had smoked trout served on roshti with an egg yolk. When mixed together, it was a fantastic combination of texture and taste. By the way, the greens served with the crab cakes were excellent and would have made a great flavorful salad dish even without the crab cakes.\n\nWhile enjoying a bottle of Argyle Chard from the Willamette Valley, we moved on to the entrees. Tombo Tuna Salad was cooked perfectly with the tune just lightly seared and sashimi on the inside. Combined with a light sauce and some pancetta, it was excellent, both light and satisfying at the same time. We also got the housemade gnocchi, which was prepared in a simple brown butter with a generous amount of wild mushrooms. The two made a great combination.\n\nI really can't emphasize enough just how good the service was. From the person who looked up our reservation and directed is to a nice table in the back of the restaurant to our server who had some great recommendations to the bus boy who was friendly and seemed genuinely pleased we were enjoying out food, we felt welcomed and appreciated during the entire experience. \n\nIt''s easy to see why this San Francisco institution manages to fill every seat during lunchtime on a Friday, it's all about what's good.", "author": "Eric W."}

The one thing that has remained constant over the years is that the portions are not large. Do not come with a huge appetite unless you plan on getting an appetizer + entree at the very least. \n\nI went with two coworkers and we ordered the lamb tongue plus the crab cakes. The tongue was very rich which is why it was sliced so thin. It was good, but probably something I wouldn't order again. We also split crab cakes, but each crab cake was about the size of half a golf ball; merely one bite and it was gone. \n\nEntree-wise, since it was crab season, we all ordered the crab pasta, which was quite good. However ... no leftovers to take away for dinner that night. I also have to note that it took about 30 minutes for our entrees to arrive -- not very relaxing when you know you have to get back to the office in a timely manner.\n\nA solid meal overall and a crowd pleaser, with consistent service.", "author": "Lori M."}

I hate calling for reservations or appointments, doing so avoids me from doing this. Plus, I don't have to be dressy if I set in the bar area. My first meal was the Alaskan Halibut \"Sous Vide\", $28.50.  The right amount of sourness of the bouquerones (anchovy marinated in salt, vinegar, garlic & parsley) gave the dish a distinct taste and the sweetness of the sweet 100 tomatoes and summer squash complimented and balanced the flavor, an eruption of flavors in my mouth.\n\nI've always loved their bar bites. The calamari is my favorite $9.25 an order. I've had their One Market sliders and their Rock Shrimp Tacos (this I had to order twice, couldn't get enough), they were all good.\n\nThe gentlemen behind the bar are always willing and able to  make you cocktails that suit your desire if there is something else specific that you want besides those that they already have in their menu.

Almost halfway between the kitchen and the main dining room but really in neither.\n\nI really didn't care for our waiter at first (I'll spare his name) as he seemed almost combative when it came to wine. We all brought bottle. We brought a chardonnay and a 2009 Pinot Noir. We asked if he could chill the white and he acted disgusted. \"You actually want to chill it? You know it's going to be VERY cold if you chill it.\" \n\nYes we know it will be very cold. I don't care if you think that's the improper way to drink white, we don't and we want it chilled!\n\nThen I asked if he could aerate or decant our Pinot since it's a young vintage and very tight. I just wanted it to open up a bit. I've had this particular vintage both aerated and not and prefer it aerated. He acted like I asked him to do the most ridiculous thing ever and then very snotty said, \"fine I'll decant it\". \n\nIt just rubbed me the wrong way. Of course once I asked him his name, he got more polite.\n\nThe food was very good. I just had the grilled mahi mahi and a side of steamed spinach.

Namely, the restaurant seems understaffed.\n\nThe biggest problem from this, of course, is the service. We waited an unreasonable amount of time for most things, namely initial service. We were seated and waited close to 20 minutes before we even got water and bread. At one point, we considered leaving, but the server did stop by to let us know she would be with us soon.

Even if you are not familiar with SF, you can tell this is an area where a lot of people go once you are inside the restaurant (floor-to-ceiling windows allow you to see the pedestrian heavy street).\n\nOne Market makes the most of its location with an imposing outside.  The building is nice and the restaurant's name is clearly prominent from the street.  Once inside, the restaurant feels big too.  There are high ceilings and big booths.  The dining room is a nice room with a simple, clean and contemporary look.\n\nLunch started with their complimentary epi baguette (a mix of baguettes shaped like a wheat stalk; you pull away the baguettes with your bare hands).  The bread had a great crispy crust and was warm with a good chew.  The bread was served with easy-to-spread butter.\n\nI started with the Dungeness crab (though it is not really the best season for it).  The crab was good though.  Nice and light with a good flavor (and very soft).  The crab was served with verjus (grape gelee) and powered yogurt.  It was quite tart and strong.\n\nThere were also some good and lightly tart grapes on the plate.  Some sorrel and radishes were also added.  Overall, it was a good dish--not really unique or creative but satisfying and pleasant.\n\nI thought my entree was a better combination of flavors.  I had the housemade cavatelli with Liberty Farms duck leg, duck prosciutto, hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, broccoli di ciccio, and parsley.  It was a pretty rich dish--the very fragrant parsley really helped cut the strong richness of the sauce.\n\nThe cavatelli was good and not too doughy.  The duck leg had a good flavor and was very tender.  The duck prosciutto was also good.  The mushrooms were very good.  I liked the broccoli as well.\n\nWhile I wouldn't say it was too salty, there was definitely a prominent salt flavor and I could see them easily over-seasoning the dish here.\n\nQuite a few of their desserts sounded good, but I opted for the Bing cherry pie with Tahitian vanilla ice cream, pistachio cream, and port-cherry reduction.  I was worried this was going to be a simple and boring cherry pie, but luckily it wasn't.\n\nI find these desserts often feature a hard and dry pie crust.  This one had a good, flaky and crispy puff pastry-like texture instead.  The Bing cherries mixture was very generous and the flavor was good but also quite tart.\n\nThe pistachio cream was light and good.  The vanilla ice cream was creamy and refreshing.  The vanilla ice cream really helped dilute the very strong cherry flavor. There was also a port-cherry reduction and it tasted exactly as it sounded.\n\nService was good.  The waitress was polite, personable and helpful with the ordering process.  The food came out at a good pace and plates were picked up promptly.  There was a little bit of a wait on the dessert, but the waitress did a good job of providing information on the when the dessert would be ready.\n\nOne Market features an upscale lunch so prices are on the high side.  And while SF's Spruce features smaller portions, I think that restaurant is a much better option for an upscale lunch in the same price range. \n\nOne Market does feature sandwiches and a $22 two-course special to provide a lower priced option.  Also, they were featuring a special where wines were half off for lunch.\n\nIf you are looking to have an upscale lunch near the Ferry Building, One Market and Boulevard are both decent choices.  Their decors are different.  Boulevard is more old-school while One Market is more contemporary.  They both put out satisfying food though I would say neither one of them would be as good as some of SF's best restaurants.\n\nStill, if you find yourself near the Ferry Building and are looking to splurge a little at lunch, I think either would likely make for a satisfying dining experience.  If you are familiar with LA, One Market would be similar to The Lobster in terms of quality of cuisine and value.\n\nParking is very difficult to find here at lunchtime.  One Market does offer valet parking and it is expensive at lunch ($12).", "author": "Anthony N."}

REPLACE or make improvements please!\n\nSERVICE - They made sure that cups of water were refilled when  nearly empty and continuously came around our table to see if we needed anything else during the dining experience.\n\nAMBIANCE - Modern, spacious and keeping it classy with the piano.\n\nPRICE - On the pricey side, but keep in mind that you are paying for the presentation and quality of the food, service and ambiance. \n\nFINAL SAY - You can be rest assured that it will be a good dining experience.  The address is perfectly suitable for the restaurant's name! Cheers!", "author": "Tiffany D."}

The chef (Mark Dommen) has been there about 9 years now?  I remember when he first arrived, his creations were unbelievable (I still remember a rabbit ravioli with wild nettles -- OMG).  The best thing was -- the menu varied with the seasons, and was always exquisitely prepared.  \n\nI've been away from SF for awhile and was looking forward to going back to One Market after we returned.  My dear foodie-friend came into town from overseas, it was half-price wine month (July)* ... seemed like the perfect time to go back!\n\nWell.  \n\nMy first clue should have been the menu.  It's high summer -- what's that salad with Dungeness crab & grapefruit doing here?  that's way more about November than July ...  \n\nOverall -- the food was fine, but seemed much less 'inspired' than i remembered.  I formed a theory that certain customers must eat here all the time, and demand that certain 'signature' dishes must always be available (like that crab & grapefruit salad perhaps?) -- regardless of season.  \n\nI still love the space, and depending on the situation I might go again (i will order more carefully) -- but at this price point, there are so many better choices in the city.", "author": "Jaina S."}

Huge windows looking into Market Street made One Market feel spacious.  The earth tones and white linen covered tables gave this restaurant  a formal business feel without feeling stuffy.  The open kitchen added a cozy ambiance to the place. Serious business suit seemed to be the preferred attire at One Market. \n\nMy friend Heather and I do not have an expense account  but we went to One Market for reasons D, E and F. We are not loaded either. At least I'm not!\n\nIt was my beautiful friend's birthday and I wanted her to feel special. We also wanted to check out Dine About Town's lunch menu. And we also wanted to sneak in our monthly gal-bonding lunch before we go on our trips separately.\n\nHeather chose to try the DAT lunch menu. For $17.99, she got a \nFARMER'S SALAD: A simple salad of seasonal greens. Very fresh and generously portioned that we had enough to share between the two of us.\n\nSTEAMED MUSSELS (chili flakes, pesto and grilled bread): Heather loved her dish! The portion was also generous. I tried the mussels with the sauce and it tasted like curry instead of pesto but I thought it was good! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=hjw-pyBQJ8WZrPLyxtjoeA\n\nI was about to try the DAT menu as well until I saw two dishes on the main menu that I could not resist:\n\nSTEAMED GULF FLOUNDER (soy sauce, shitake and bokchoy) $22 The fish was sooooo tender, sooooo flavorful, sooo delicious! Yes, you can tell I loved it! I wish they gave me a little bit more fish but it was really good in its simplicity. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=UT7SwxZq4-_ZyE4zOqQ8fg\n\nCHICKPEA FRIES ($5): Heather and I were intrigued that we had to have these. We thought they were deep-fried chickpeas but they were chickpeas that were mashed, formed into sticks then deep fried. They came with aioli type sauce but they were good even without. Light, not greasy and seasoned-well. Best to eat while hot off the fryer. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=6dIhJBSL2Z3HH4WQTx3Mjw\n\nSERVICE:\nService was efficient and friendly. We opted for tap water but our server somehow insisted with a bit of pressure for us to try the flavored lemonades. We declined twice and the 3rd time, we just went, \"What the heck. We'll have one each.\" They were refreshing but we just really wanted tap water.\n\nLOWDOWN:\nOne Market's DAT is one of the best DAT we have tried so far. Heather and I have tried quite a few DATs over the last couple of years and somehow we oftentimes thought they were just okay.\n\nAt One Market the DAT dishes were executed well, priced right and generously portioned. \n\nIf I  had an expense account  or loaded with cash I will be ordering the flounder ($22) at One Market 3x  a  week! That's about $66 a week, $264 a month for flounder lunch. I think I would have to stick with my $3.25 Tofu banh mi lunch at Saigon, instead. :(\n\nAnd I also found out after our meal that One Market is a 1 Michelin Star awardee. As good as our meal was, no stars fell from the skies for me. It was very, very good but I had better Michelin star meals in the past.\n\nTab: $70 including tax and 20% tip.", "author": "Leah E."}

This was one of the better ones because it was only slightly over seasoned instead of extremely. \nThe flounder..... My mom and I couldn't even finish one fillet. I don't understand this. The chefs here must have a strange palate for seasoning things. It was like eating soft fish oozing with warm salt juice.

Crunchy almond cake, slightly on the sweeter side, but I liked the texture combinations-- crunchy and light, fluffy creamy. Carrot cake also on the sweeter side, but I liked the zing with ginger.

Wine pairing for both the appetizer and entree portion of the meal is only an additional $13 charge.  Normally one glass of wine costs that much on its own.\n\nI've dined here twice for dinner thus far and they can expect me back plenty more times.\n- Bread: Acme bread, specifically olive bread (amazing) and French bread.  Acme is the best!\n- Amuse bouche: Both times were a small bite of garnished crudo presented in a small flat spoon.  Very good.\n- Appetizers: Golden beet and saffron soup with seared ahi tuna wrapped around geoduck clam and julienned green apple.  Shaved beef tongue salad with an almost kimchee-like cabbage, croutons and frozen crumbles of horseradish that can easily be mistaken for cheese crumbles.  Of these two I prefer the soup, but both are still very good. \n- Entrees: Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin medallions over persillade and sliced dehydrated apples.  Pan seared Alaskan halibut with fish stick (love their version of the fish stick).  Both are great but the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin stands out here.  Pork wrapped around more pork!?!  Should be featured on Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations' Food Porn episode!  Initially the tenderloin did not look especially tender or juicy but to my delighted surprise it very much was.  Coupled with the savory and crunchy bacon exterior this dish is just plain excellent with a nice and mild smokey open-fire-grill flavor.    \n- Extra sides: Buttery mashed potatoes.  This wasn't particularly notable.  Really wanted the roasted brussel sprouts with bacon instead but the sprouts weren't in season.\n- Desserts: I've tried a number of the desserts: (1) brown sugar cheesecake with peanut butter cookie crumb crust and candied peanuts, (2) chocolate toffee almond crunch cake with vanilla ice cream, (3) strawberry cheesecake, (4) duo of cr\u00e8me br\u00fbl\u00e9e (vanilla bean and espresso), and (5) pineapple upside down cake with vanilla bean ice cream.  I numbered them in terms of how I'd rank them.  The brown sugar cheesecake (very light and airy) with the sweet and salty peanut butter cookie crumb crust was simply sweet sensational goodness!\n\nService the first time I dined here was good, second time was excellent.  They actually ran out of wine selected for the entree I ordered the second time I was here so our waiter gave us a similar zinfandel but also gave us an extra glass of pinot, free of charge, that he thought paired better with the pork tenderloin than what the sommelier actually selected and he was spot on.\n\nVery good restaurant overall.

The service was amazing the whole night from the host to our server and bus boys. I was also really impressed with the food! I did the 3 course Market dinner, which for $45 is great value. I started with the summer squash soup which was the BEST soup I've ever had. I would go back for this alone! For my main course I had the Halibut and my husband had the pork loin. The halibut was nicely cooked and the foam had a nice citrus flavor to it. I wasn't in love with the veggies served with it but all in all it was tasty. The pork loin was delicious and well portioned. It came with creamed spinach which was very good as well.

It looks like One Market was trying to keep the wild weather OUTSIDE where it belonged. The first thing you see when you step inside is a big, heavy velvet curtain that keeps out the wind. Very smart.\n\nInside, the bar was packed with people enjoying happy hour. Even after we were seated in our elevated booth, I could hear some of them enjoying themselves a bit too much. I ordered the Dine About Town deluxe menu with choices of sunchoke veloute, duck breast, and carrot cake cheesecake (swapped out with the regular DAT choice). \n\nI liked that there was a choice of bread with our meals. I believe there was a regular roll or a olive loaf.\n\nWe started out our meal with an amuse bouche of ahi poke with sesame seeds. Nothing too fancy, though my fellow diners noted that it was a bit fishier than they expected. I thought it was fine, though not mind-blowing.\n\nThe soup was tasty, but I should know better than to get sunchoke anything as it gave me a really bad stomach ache a couple of hours later. The hazelnuts were an interesting touch, and you can't really go wrong with crunchy bacon, but my favorite part were the mushrooms which were an odd slightly greenish in color but tasted really good. \n\nMy duck was okay, though I prefer for the fat to be rendered down a bit more. There was a very heavy sauce that had a slight sour plum flavor to it which I thought was a bit too rich tasting. The duck was also accompanied by a chunk of homemade foie gras and duck sausage, which mostly tasted like the best breakfast sausage you've ever had, but really didn't taste much of foie gras. My favorite part of the plate was actually the green colored farro that was under the duck breast slices. It was slightly nutty and chewy and quite good. \n\nThe highlight of my meal was probably the cheesecake, which was a delicious creamy cheesecake on top of an equally moist and delicious slice of carrot cake. It had a light glaze on the plate which wasn't too sweet, as well as a scoop of intense vanilla ice cream. The braised pineapple were a nice touch as they weren't too sweet and had just enough bite to them to cut through the richness of the rest of the desert. \n\nI tried a bite of my sister's pork chop, and it was cooked perfectly. The portion size of her dish was absolutely massive, as the chop was probably an inch thick and 10oz. It came on a bed of super smooth mashed potatoes with a side of escarole sauteed with more bacon.\n\nThe wine pairings went well with both the soup and main entree. \n\nService was impeccable.

A bit on the tangy side, but decent. This tasted better with my dinner bread instead of the baguettes that came with it. For the main course, I ordered the trout. Nothing out of the ordinary and it did not WOW me neither. Ended the night with the tropical fruit sorbet. Came with a scoop of pineapple and a scoop of kiwi flavor topped with a thin piece of flower-shaped cookie that tasted like a fortune cookie.

Presentation was nice, and toasted baguette on the side. I had much better steak tartare so I was not impressed. And, most importantly, the toasted baguette was stale. It was supposed to be crispy but not hard. I was so disappointed. On the other hand, the shaved lamb tongue was pretty good. The lamb tongue was finely sliced so it wasn't chewy but tender. \n\nGrilled steel-head trout was alright too. The sauce was a bit too salty. Braised pork short rib was a little bit better. It was very tender. Duck breast was probably the best. It was juicy and tender. I loved the mashed sweet potato. I wish they give us small. \n\nDessert was disappointing too. The ricotta cake was dry and hard. The sorbet and the bloody orange was sour. The parfait was pretty sweet. I only had a little bit because I felt like i was eating sugar. \n\nThe only thing that stood out was the bread. It was hot and nicely toasted. Outside was so crispy and inside was so soft.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-28", "description": "One of the biggest benefits to moving away from San Diego and into the Bay Area is the endless amount of food options up here. Granted we don't have a great taqueria where I can get my carne asada fix, or that I'm still finding something to rival Din Tai Fung's dumplings, but the food up here is pretty amazing. The biggest find up here is the amount of stars up here. Now I'm not talking about Catherine Zeta Jones or Brad Pitt... but something even more coveted. Michelin Stars. Yup! The Bay Area boasts of plenty of Michelin Stars... including the only 3 star restaurant in the US. French Laundry! I'm still awaiting the day where I can eat there again... with my D300 so I can capture my meal in its wonderful photographic glory!\n\nFor my 21st birthday (yes, I'm still celebrating my 21st birthday... I think we're up to a few anniversaries of my 21st birthday... but seriously, whose counting right?) Sam arranged for a lovely get together at the wonderful One Market in San Francisco. It touts a star so now overall my star count is up to 8... They were wonderful in keeping a large round table for our dinner party and the food there was delicate and well thought out.\n\nI started out with the pea soup, accentuated with crisp pancetta and topped with a soft boiled organic egg. Now keep in mind, I've always hated egg yolks ever since I was a kid. It still baffles me to this day; this egg-yolk hating habit. Evolution has made it so that we crave high fat and rich foods (which explains my endless love affair with butter...) but to this day, I still have a hard time eating yolks. This soup... was perfect. This was the first time I understood why people call egg yolks creamy. We gently broke the egg and mixed it into the soup to create this amazing creamy rich finish. The pancetta broke up the smoothness and added a nice textural balance along with the briny saltiness. Emulsified peas never really appealed to me but the soup was this beautiful beautiful bright green color. Nothing was overlooked here; even the croutons were crisp and well seasoned!\n\nI recall awhile ago when I was living in San Diego, there was quite a bit of controversy about foie gras. I'm not sure if it is still served down there, but it was offered on the menu up here. (Along with at the menus at the Google cafeteria... their Kobe burger with foie gras with a side of Maine lobster tail is amazing!!) In any case, we ordered a side of the foie gras to whet our palate. Oh Mr. Goose... you did not die in vain. The foie gras was seared perfectly; I normally hate liver in any shape, way, form or preparation but I didn't turn my nose down on this one. The foie gras had a perfect creamy consistency, paired with the carmelized hazelnuts and apricot compote, it was one fab dish! \n\nIn my family, we grew up eating a lot of fish. Having Taiwanese roots, fresh whole fish is super important to my family. When we have family dinners, there's alway a whole steamed fish which then the chopstick battles ensue to claim the fish cheeks. Yes... fish cheeks. Since fish spend their whole lives bug eyed and gulping, these two highly priced muscles are extremely tender yet firm at the same time. When I saw that they had Halibut Cheeks on the menu... I squealed. I ordered the Halibut Cheeks with Root Vegetables and Fennel Foam. I didn't really quite understand the foam component but the cheeks were amazing! Tender... chewy... and very \"Q!\"\n\nSam ordered the Seared Steak on Polenta with Bok Choy and Brussel Sprouts. Again... seared perfectly, but I couldn't really tear myself away from my fish cheeks to eye his dish. When I finally sampled it, it was utter steak heaven. The meat was amazingly tender, flavorful and seared perfectly. The centers were warm and moist and the edges were still slightly crusty from the hard sear. The sauce was a wonderful reduction and the bok choy was cooked perfectly.\n\nAll in all, it really showed on how well the restaurant was run. The dishes were very well presented and thought out. The pairings were great and our server suggested great wine pairings. I was pleasantly surprised at how great the service was since they were charging a standard service charge for how large our party was.", "author": "Vicky L."}

The restaurant is located near the piers, and is on a very busy street. I don't know if other guests park their cars in a garage and just walk to the restaurant, but my boyfriend opted for valet (they park your car at the nearest curb to the entrance of the restaurant).\n\nOur dinner reservation was for 7:15, but we were a tad early and arrived around 6:45. Lucklily, the hostess said that she was able to seat us. There is a pianist near the bar/waiting area, and large floor-length curtains that you have to go through to get to the hostess stand.\n\nAt first glance of the dinner menu, we decided to skip one of their \"starters\". My boyfriend ordered their \"bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin\" with an addition of their \n\"buttery mashed potatoes\", and I decided on their \"pan-seared day boat scallops\". Of course with a round of martinis with a twist and a cosmopolitan on the side.\n\nOne of the servers gave us water and offered us a choice of two breads while we wait for our food: some sort of sourdough, or a \"olive\" bread (I'm sorry, I forgot the exact name of the bread). The \"olive\" bread was sort of a mixed bag for me. Some bites the bread was yummy with just right amount of bread to olive ratio, other bites were straight up chunks of olives (yes, actual olive chunks are in the bread).\n\nOur entrees took quite some time to get out. My boyfriend and I were thinking that the kitchen were making up for our early arrival with the delay in food preparation. Another server approched our table with a \"compliments of the kitchen\" dish that was two spoonfuls of some potatoe blob (again, my apologies for not remembering the exact name). It was good, but it only made me more hungry and more eager for my food.\n\nOverall, our entrees were delicious. My boyfriend commented that their tenderloin was cooked to perfection, and the bacon was nice touch. Their scallops were satisfactory, and the artichoke accompanied it well. Their mashed potatoes were fluffy and buttery indeed. I honestly would prefer mashed potatoes that had cheese in it (or are cheesy), but that's just me.\n\nAs for dessert, I chose to have their pumpkin cheesecake and my boyfriend ordered their \"mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich\". Side note: They offer this $15 \"mini platter\" of their \"singular sensations\", any three of your choice. I didn't see this till now, nor did our waiter offer this to us. Their \"mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich\" was just as it is described. My only thing is, I am a huge mint and/with chocolate fan, so I am very particular about my mint taste. This dessert was more of a mint liqueur taste, not quite your usual grocery store mint chocolate chip ice cream taste. Their pumpkin cheesecake was just like any other pumpkin cheesecake, which was also adorned with glazed pecans on top.\n\nI would definitely come back to his restaurant, maybe to try out lunch, or just for some drinks. The location of the restaurant is pretty, and it appears to be spacious inside. I also noticed a few of their guests were ordering their \"chef's tasting menu\" with the \"wine pairing\". I might come back just to try that as well.", "author": "Nilda Lynne A."}

We arrived promptly and were seated right away but to a cramp corner table that actually had a great view of the Ferry Building Clock.  The \"pork\" menu was incredible.  I like each dish immensely.  I just wish I didn't stuff myself with bread so I could have finished my dessert.  I don't remember the dishes names but I took pictures...hope you find them.  Regarding our service though, it was just OK.  Our server wasn't what you'd expect from a Michelin star restaurant.  She wasn't very prompt, attentive, and accommodating.  The food runners/bussers, however, were exceptional - they saved my rating of One Market restaurant that's for sure.\n\nFortunately, I was lucky enough to go to One Market Restaurant with my family again the following week for their Weekly Beast \"chicken\" menu.  Maybe I caught the service on an off day.  Busy Friday night...it's understandable right.  OK, so this time we had reservations for an early Saturday night dinner.  We were so early the place was practically empty.  We got a different server this time.  A guy this time that wasn't stuffy but had a funny air about him.  His shining highlights were that he made notice to me that the wine we brought could have possibly been spoiled.  Being a former bartender and server for some good restaurants I tasted it to give my approval or disapproval.  The cork was slightly damaged like he stated which I noted.  I sampled the wine...it was borderline but still held its uniqueness.  It was a 2003 wine that later after research was suppose to be consumed no later than a few months from our dinner at One Market.  The wine was still good but I'm glad he made us aware of its possible flaw.  As for the Weekly Beast \"chicken\" menu...well, it was a waste of a nice night out at SF.  None of the dishes were exceptional and the dessert, aside from maybe having egg in it, didn't portray a chicken concept.  Where's the chicken, man? :-)  As for our waiter...he was a bit abrasive, missing at times, and pushy.  Again, not what you'd expect from a Michelin star restaurant.  It was pretty rude of him also to pick up our checkbook before we vacated the table.  Maybe he thought we were tourist from Europe or Asia and thought we would stiff him...who knows.  It's pretty rude for a high end restaurant though.  Not acceptable...  \n\nThe food runners/bussers were great though.  Better, if not as great, than the previous weeks food runners/bussers.  Definitely, the food runners/bussers here are what I'd expect a Michelin restaurant to have.  The servers though are a bit unprofessional.

The first two times, I was not impressed at all. The food was good, but when you get REALLY slow service your overall experience just causes you to leave with a bad experience. \n\nAnyway, I came here for Dine About Town and the experience was a lot better than my previous ones (which I found rather weird since restaurants normally snub Dine About Towners). \n\nStarted with the watercress soup, which had clams, turnip and ginger. This soup was very flavorful. The waitress said it takes a day to make and the flavors reflect that. On a cold day, I could eat a pot of this stuff. Too bad the waiters who present the plate and pour the soup tableside wouldn't come along with. Oh well... \n\nNext I got the Pan-Seared True Cod, with fennel, potatoes, pesto-mussel broth (which came with the teeniest mussels). It was pretty delicious. The preparation of the potatoes was something I didn't care for. It looked like they ran them through a mandolin so it had the same shape as the fennel... Eh? The Cod itself was awesome. Crispy skin oustide, perfectly flaky inside. \n\nDessert was what is called the \"Valrhona Chocoalte Cremeaux Parfait\", salted caramel, almond streusel and white chocolate. SUPER chocolatey goodness. The salted caramel was light, so that was a little disappointing but still overall very tasty. \n\n4 dollars extra for the dessert on a Dine About Town menu? That must come from the prissy nature of being a Michelin Star rated restaurant. But at the price of $18.95 for the starter and main course, FINE, it's worth it. \n\nThey also added 18% for all Dine About Town Menus along with the annoying SF \"healthcare\" charge.\n\nBTW, the best part of lunch. $2 martinis!

The calamari was also very solid. While I did not partake in the smelt dish (too fishy) I was told it was good.\n\nEnded up ordering a eggs benedict item.  It was fantastic.  Was served with no to little salt bringing out the natural flavors of the egg and complimented by the naturally salty ham.  The sister ordered the dish vegetarian and while I ordered my 'with her ham' as a joke, they delivered.  The dish was very solid though I was somewhat confused as to the inclusion of a 'greens' salad with the dish.\n\nBetween 6 people, coffee/drinks, 3 appetizers, 6 entrees,  and 2 deserts the total bill came in under $75 a person.

Food was fresh, creative and innovative.  Dessert was homemade and we had a trio.  It was a birthday dinner.  Well worth the price and surprised how cheap the bill was.  Pictures say a thousand words and the impeccable service says thousands more.  The only comment I can make is when everything is served on a tray, it is very friendly and clean.  But when dishes are pulled from the table, the also need to be pulled with a tray.  This keeps their sleeves clean and everyone sanitary.  An added bonus would be to cover with a napkin providing fresh napkins for dessert.  You also are missing out as the patrons of your establish would appreciate a nice port/wine pairing with dessert on the menu.  Other than that, FLAWLESS!  Chef sends you a wonderful one bite appetizer as a welcome too!  I cannot say enough good words.  Since it is so centralized to tourism it may be easy to dismiss however, do not be fooled, this place is A MUST!!  \n\nPlease One Market take my suggestions!  You will one up everyone else in town!  Okay, 2 up.....I not only speak from my foodie experience but my fine dining training\n as well.  You have the tools and the people perfect for the job, you just need to utilize them to their best.  If you do not put the pairings on your menu for dessert, at the very least, train train train your staff to suggest appropriate dessert wines.

I tried to make reservations on Opentable for Saturday night, but nothing was available.  I then called, and they said they were also booked up except for walk ins to be seated at the bar.\n\nWell, we decided to just walk in! We were greated at the front counter and asked if we made reservations.  I said no, and they quickly walked us over to a table for two!  Not fully booked after all! \n\nService was extremely prompt and informative.  She was very helpful and catered to our needs after knowing we were in a rush to go somewhere else after.\n\nI tried the deluxe DAT menu: beef tongue salad, duck breast with duck leg confit, and chocolate souffle for $45.  Fyi - you're only saving a few bucks with this menu, so if you're not soo enthusiastic about what they are offering, you might as well order your dishes a la carte!\n\nTo begin with, they offered us bread and butter, as well as a small complimentary taste of their ahi tuna.  This had a refreshingly good taste.   The beef tongue salad was nicely presented.  Thin slices of beef tongue over pickled cabbage served with nice crispy croutons.  The duck breast was cooked perfectly: nice, pink, and tender.  I would have liked the skin to be more crispy though! This was served with a duck confit that was way too salty! The polenta was good and went well with the duck.  The cocoa reduction glaze on the dish complimented the duck very well.  As for dessert, the souffle was rich and fluffy.  However, it wasn't freshly made and lacked the nice, warm taste of a fresh chocolate souffle out of the oven.  The carmelized banana, mascarpone, and ice cream went well with the souffle.  \n\nMy bf had the foie gras appetizer, which was delicious and seared to perfection.  Upon serving this, they pour a sweet vinegar soy sauce like sauce over the foie gras.  Yummy!  He also tried the Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin, which was a much larger portion than expected.  The pork was amazingly so tender, and cut easily even with a butter knife!  It was served on top of pear slices, which went very well together.  The dandelion persillade was tasty also!\n\nIn the end, we got the bill with two apricot jellies!

This restaurant would barely get 2 stars on my radar after forgetting to serve us dinner! So here's the story... \n\nReservations were at 8pm, we got there at 7:30pm. We checked in with the hostess (who told us they are running on time and might even get us seated earlier). While waiting we ordered wine at the bar (the Zinfandel was superb). At 8pm we settle up and go get seated. We ordered wine (Malbec) and the \"House-made Charcuterie\" (not a fan of the pate)... And that's when it started....... We waited NINETY minutes for our dinner (2 mains: the duck and steak). When we got fed up of waiting, we finally grabbed our waiter and asked what the hell was going on.. His response was \"there was a mix up in the kitchen, the manager will bring over your food in thirty seconds.\" (It would have been nice to have been told about this \"mix up\" instead of having to ask after waiting for so long!) Anyway, the manager comes over with dinner (warns us that the plates were hot then says that dessert will be on the house). Seriously? Next time, take responsibility and ownership of mistakes. I don't expect to pay $200 at a restaurant that forgets to bring me my meal. \n\nThe food: 7/10. The duck was good but the andouille wasn't that great. The steak was cooked medium-rare as requested, flavorful but nothing special. The two sides we ordered were the mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts (highly recommend the sides lol). Thank goodness for the many glasses of wine we had. \n\nDessert: We ordered the toffee crunch bar as well as the bread pudding. The crunch bar was nothing special (literally a chocolate cake covered in almonds and hazelnuts? I think) The bread pudding was good.... Although this was served barely luke warm. Maybe if it was warmer it would have tasted better. \n\nThe scene: higher end, social scene, mostly business dinners on week days.", "author": "Raveena P."}

It's right on Embarcadero, nearby several notable restaurants.  We called to make a reservation, which required a credit card confirmation, which is fine, since it's Christmas Eve.  Food was good.  Coming from New York, there's pretty amazing food so I'm not going to say it's life changing but it's certainly well prepared and well presented.  My complaint is really the portions to price ratio.  Our grilled Octopus appetizer was one leg of octopus.  Literally one tentacle.  It was $18.  My scallop entree was $35.  It had 3 scallops.  My friend and I paid $200 for 2, we each ordered an appetizer and an entree plus 2 glasses of white wine each.  The part that left the really bad taste in our mouths was that our waitress added her own 20% gratuity to the check.  And no, it's wasn't like a pre-set thing, where oh, it's a large party, or oh it's Christmas Eve.  No where, on the menu or the website, or when I called to make the reservation did they say gratuity would be included tonight.  We would've left her 20% regardless but the fact that she hand wrote it in herself, on the FULL bill, kind of just pushed it over the edge.

We needed something more substantial to eat after oysters and bubbly before we headed home and we decided to try One Market. I've been hearing good things about it lately and hey, it has a Michelin star!\n\nWe chose to sit at the bar and ordered from the dinner menu.

It was perfection. \n\nI also really enjoyed the charcuterie - housemade mortadella, salami, duck liver mousse, etc. It had a few tiny dots of apricot mustard on the plate and wow, was it full of flavor, it complimented the meats beautifully. \n\nOn Saturday nights Billy Philadelphia plays the piano at the bar and he is delightful. He played some requests for us and came over to talk, he is a treasure and a talented pianist.\n\nI asked about private dining rooms since I'm in the wedding and event business and Tim (the manager?) took me on a tour. It would be a great place for a wedding reception, rehearsal dinner, business dinner, etc. They can really accomodate any number with the adjoining atrium and cool wine bar - Wine & Wall. \n\nWhen the check came there were house made salted caramels that were so good, I asked for more.

Why thank you for noticing that I'm here!\n\nThe rest of our evening went by a bit more smoothly in regards to service.  We ordered the shaved beef tongue salad, the charcuterie plate, cornish game hen for her, and the ahi tuna for me.  We also split the chickpea fries and brussels sprouts.\n\nYUM for the beef tongue salad and chickpea fries!  Both were so unique and had a distinct texture and taste.  I'd totally order these two again.\n\nMEH for my ahi tuna, and my cousin's cornish game hen.  Both lacked flavor, though they were both juicy and moist.  The mushrooms that came with my tuna didn't pair well with it at all.\n\nBLEH for the brussels sprouts and the charcuterie plate.  The brussels sprouts were extremely limp and oily (best ones so far are at Anchor & Hope), and the charcuterie plate was pretty sparse and pathetic for being over $14.  Also, the baguette slices they give with it are extremely buttery and greasy, totally not a good fit for the paper-thin, half-ply sheets of cured meats.\n\nWe ended our meal with the butterscotch pudding, which my cousin didn't like but I LOVED.  It's very smooth and heavy in butterscotch flavor and had a dollop of fresh whipped cream on top.  Best part of the meal for me, although I wish it could've been a big bucket of the stuff.  Next time.\n\nOverall, this place has decent food for too hefty a price tag.  If I'd been blown away by each of the dishes, they would've easily gotten 4 or even 5 stars.", "author": "Tori S."}

However, I think if I were in a large group, I'd feel bad about possibly being too loud.\n\nFood was amazing.  Yes, I'm going to preface this by saying that this place is pricey.  It was about $100 for the two of us (and that's us sharing a starter and dessert and not drinking anything alcoholic).  However, the food was delicious and definitely worth a splurge once in a while.  We had the foie gras and O.M.G. it was amazing.  I definitely recommend this place for foie gras.  My boyfriend had roasted duck with a bunch of other stuff and he thoroughly enjoyed it.  I had the gnocchi and it was perfect.

I have to admit I was a little nervous when I first found out that the soup did not have any cream in it.  But it was so full of flavor I never missed the cream.   And the crab made the soup make sense because it complemented the strong earthy fennel flavor with its richness and texture.  The entree came with a square block of duck leg confit which was so perfectly fatty and crispy it was like eating duck carnitas.

The greens were frisee, creating a cute nest effect for the gooey egg center.  Really enjoyed the gizzard bits to add some heartier texture and saltiness to this untraditional salad dish.  I was a little apprehensive about eating the muscular stomach of a duck, known as the gizzard, but can now understand why most of the world's poor people love it.\n\nRabbit Cannelloni: Definitely not your Italian-American peasantry fare, doesn't even possess any of those overused cheap tomato sauce or ricotta cheese ingredients.  Slow cooked bits of rabbit and seasonal vegetables rolled in a supple and slightly pan fried pasta wrap.  Loved both the irony and the perfect pairing of the carrot foam surrounding... wonder if they caught the rabbit and the carrot at the same time?\n\nStrawberry Shortcake: The fresh strawberries and hand whipped cream was enough to sway my overall sentiment as positive, but I wasn't a fan of the \"shortcake\".

The flavor was OK, but it was basically three small strips of duck breast is a sweet reduction of some sort.  It was so typical, I can't even remember what it was.  I also had about a 1-2oz block of duck confit.  All for the bargain price of $30.  For portions so small at these prices, I am going to need some sort of point of view from the chef.  Again nothing special here.  I would rather walk 15 mins to chinatown and get 2 whole ducks for the same price.  \n\nDecor, nothing special except for the view of the ferry building.

As for this restaurant, I don't know if I'd come here on my own accord.  It seems like any other upscale American restaurant primarily for the white collar business folks.", "author": "Shannon L."}

I've been here for personal and professional events over the years, with my latest visit being this past week.  The good service, attention to detail and upscale American farm-to-table food are still present.\n\nOn this most recent visit, I met up with a couple of friends for happy hour.  Our original spot was a bust (you could have swatted flies in there...it's a Chinese saying as there were NO actual flies in there!) so we took a walk to find a locale that was a bit more lively and One Market was fit the bill perfectly!  They had a decent crowd, good HH menu and reduced prices on a few wines and spirits.  We started off with glasses of prosecco and orders of the sliders, chickpea fries and lettuce cups.  I thought the mini-burgers were a bit dry and the fries were okay but could have been more crisp.  The lettuce cups contained small chunks of pork belly and were pretty tasty.   Even though the bar area was packed, several people waited on us during our time there.\n\nAfter a couple of hours we decided to stay and have dinner and moved to the dining room.  I had left my unfinished glass of sparkling wine in the bar and our waitress was kind enough to bring it to our table.  A gesture that was much appreciated on my part.  \n\nThere were so many dishes that I wanted to order after perusing their menu, but my stomach would not allow for that, given that I had already eaten earlier.  I ended up with the petrale sole, prepared sous-vide, with shrimp, clams and mussels.  The seafood was very fresh, with the fish light and rather delicate, and the portion size just right to satisfy my hunger.  For dessert we decided to share the chocolate toffee almond crunch cake with vanilla ice cream.  Toffee bar + chocolate cake + ice cream = \"What did you say?  Shhhh!  Don't bother me while I'm eating this.\"  It was quite delicious.  This was listed as one of their \"Singular Sensations\" and was portioned at half the size of their regular desserts.   Personally, I thought this size was perfect and wished more restaurants would return to \"normal\" portion sizes for their desserts.   Throughout the meal our wait staff was attentive and quite friendly, especially our primary waiter.\n\nWhether here to entertain clients, celebrate a life event or just enjoy a nice meal, One Market still shines with good, fresh, well executed food, efficient and attentive service and a good bar scene.", "author": "Melissa L."}

I love butter and the flavor of this butter takes me back to distant beautiful travels.  mmm\n\nWe had the Scallop salad for starters and though beautifully arranged it didn't excite me.  The scallops were small, raw and very strong in taste, almost like a sea urchin for me.  Thank goodness it came served with citrus and sharp tasting greens to contrast.  Next time I would pass.\n\nThe best entree we had was the mussels in curried broth.  Beautifully steamed and the flavors and colored were just right.  It was exciting to eat!\n\nThe Tombo Tuna Salad was just ok.  It's a seared raw tuna on a bed of stringed cucumber, ringed with mango and red-onion pieces.  Meh.  There have been so many incarnations of seared tuna, It's a safe choice akin to a chicken teriyaki.  But at least it was made of quality ingredients.\n\nNow the part that makes me smile all the way to the gym!  Worth every calorie was the Chocolate Toffee Crunch Cake!  Can I get a Hallelujah?  Oh my gosh!  I will dream of this cake anytime I want a chocolate cake!  It's the best Chocolate cake I've had in a long, long time.  Heavy in Chocolate flavor but light in density of the cake itself.  Not too much frosting, but just enough to glue the toffee and nuts to itself.  It's perfection on a plate.\n\nOh we also had the Creme Brulee in Vanilla and Coffee but for me the coffee creme brulee was weak and both paled in comparison to the Toffee Crumb Cake.  \n\nAnd get their Coffee.

Teeny tiny portion. I mean, a normal amount of scallops for a single portion, but everything else was tiny. I had two spoons of rice and then 5 spoons of that sea foam stuff on top. I am not a fan of the foam and I only remembered that when they put the dish down in front of me.  The Sturgeon was really good. The dessert (Valrohna souffle) was ok. I've personally made better souffles and I'm not great at cooking or baking, so maybe my expectations were too high - maybe I'm better than I thought (haha)\n\nI've been waiting to come back to this place for a year since I came for lunch in 2009 and I find myself unsatisfied.

Last night, my friends and I went to One Market to take advantage of their Dine-About-Town Specials: 3 course meals for $36.95 (standard) or $44.95 (deluxe). Add another $15 for wine pairing. Yes, the maitre d' could use a lesson in warmth and hospitality. However, our server Steve made up for it with his ebullient personality. Two of us opted for the Deluxe selection with wine pairing. I had the Tombo Tuna Carpaccio, Liberty Farms Duck Breast with Sunchokes and Duck Andouille Sausage (super salty). I wish I had read the menu more clearly, because my entree did not come with any starch at all --- no potatoes, pasta or risotto to temper the flavors of the duck (which was divine). For dessert, I had the White Chocolate Creme Fraiche Panna Cotta, which just melted in your mouth.The busboy seemed like he was in a bit of a hurry, as the pacing between courses felt rushed. For example, he attempted to clear my appetizer plate when I hadn't put down my fork, and had one bite left. On another occasion, our server asked which one of us was the birthday celebrant (none) and another maitre d' stopped by to say \"How's the Birthday Celebration going?\" Ummm.... it's not.The dinner company more than made up for these few WTF moments, and overall still had a wonderful evening.", "author": "Marcus J."}

My brother-in-law's dish came out overdone and charred.\n- Black code was oily, which is a good thing, but certainly takes skills to get it right.  It was a little fishy.\n- Scallops and sweetbread was a sad little dish. Only four small scallops and two heavily breaded sweetbread (that doesn't taste anything like sweetbread we had elsewhere). The dish was supposed to have Matsutake mushrooms but we didn't find any in the dish.\n- The best part of the meal was certainly dessert.  All the dessert dishes were pretty good. My favorite were the chocolate souffl\u00e9 (from the Market menu) and bread pudding (from the DAT 2010 menu).\n\nIf you come here for Dine About Town 2010, get the cauliflower soup, skirt steak, and bread pudding.

I quickly found out why.\n\nI unfortunately followed in a man with mental illness who hid behind the curtain by the front door, talking to himself.  I let a waiter know, who let management know, who quietly asked the man to leave.  I was then ignored.  I tried to stand out of the way and waited for my party to arrive.  \n\nAfter we were seated, I was impressed the waiter noticed we were wearing black and substitued black napkins for white.  That's where being impressed ended.  There were very long waits between getting the menu, getting our wine order taken, getting the wine, our food selections being taken, and then getting plates.  This weighs heavily in my bad experience.  \n\nI ordered the charcuterie plate.  It was delicious, with at least 5 kinds of meats, although one of the meats was purely fat, no red meat, just white fat, blech.  The radishes and pickled grapes, and jam, were delightful.  I split it with my friend and saved room for dinner.\n\nI've always wanted to try sturgeon and was thrilled it was on the menu.  What I got was so salty it was inedible.  I would have liked to tell the waiter, but after dropping it off he didn't come back, so as my dining companions finished their meal, mine sat untouched.  When he finally returned, after my companions had finished, I was able to tell him it was awful.  He said, \"Oh, sorry!\" and took it away.  About five minutes later he thrusts a menu in front of me, telling me I can order an appetizer or small plate.  No thanks.  I've been here about an hour and a half, I'm tired, I've just eaten half a salt lick, and I have a 45 minute BART ride home, and I would be the only one eating since the others were finished.  I'm done.  I let him know I didn't want anything else and he seemed offended.  The waiter opined the sauce may have been too salty, and I'm sure it was overreduced,  I just suggested the chef taste it.  \n\nBy then our dinner was a downer, even though my companions liked their meals, so we skipped dessert and coffee and headed out.  \n\nIt was loud, the service was poor, and the food was inedible.

Weird, but oh so bad and GOOD.  The little doughy donuts are freshly fried then topped with some cheese.  There's a little heat to them too.  A nice surprise to wake up the heavy taste.\n\nAfter munching on our sinfully delicious donuts and alcohol, we figured we'd try to hop over to the other side of the restaurant to dine for dinner.  So I used my handy dandy phone that I cannot live without, and went to Open Table to see if there were any seats.  6:30pm for 2 booked!

STOP IT!  no wonder you're NOT Michelin rated anymore.  I ate just one slice of white fish and stopped right there.\n4. Friend had wednesday special - thin slices of veal.  A plate of thinly sliced veal on top of a red sauce - meat was pretty rare itself, and on top of a dark red sauce just seemed like it was drowning in it's own sauce...you'd definitely get the boot if you were on Top Chef.\n5. Apple Turnover accompanied with a small ginger milkshake - perfect, divine, no complaints.  This dessert would be ea 4.5 star.\n6. Coffee - served in a french press, strong and good like it should be.  \n\nI opt for the 2 star because the entree is the main dish and as the main dish, they failed.  Our waitress was also VERY slow, avoided eye contact, and felt like she was running back and forth unnecessarily.  She really irked me.\n\nI did come during lunch and thought service was ABOVE par, lunch menu was also much more enticing (there was no foam - I had the gnocchi with duck and it was amazing, bit salty, but VERY good).

However by the time the valet took my car, our table was ready.  And we got a view of the Embarcadero :)\n\nThe decor is the type of retro glamor I like, but subtle.  The service was great; our server was very attentive and was polished enough to talk to everything on the menu and adequately on the wine list.  This is the difference between normal restaurants and fine dining.  The servers come by and survey the table without bothering you.  Once in a while, they will ask if you need anything, but they won't ask every single time they pass your table.  That is really nice.\n\nThe menu tonight was prix fixe, which was kind of a bummer because I really wanted to try the foie gras, but it also means I'm probably dropping less L\u00ec X\u00ec (or H\u00f3ng Bo) for the two of us, jk.\n\nOne of the servers actually brought us an amuse bouche compliments of the chef (probably because of the holiday or that it took a while to get some fresh bread) and it was delightful.

It made for interesting textures with the jalapeno sorbet, but it wasn't my particular cup of tea.  I could have totally made a meal out of the trout though...I mean 62 degree cooked eggs...MMM.\n\nFor the main course, we had\n\nPan-Seared Day Boat Scallops\nsweet breads, matsutake mushrooms, sunchokes \n\nand\n\n12oz All Natural Angus New York Steak\nred wine butter, b\u00e9arnaise relish\n\nI could tell by the smirk on the corners of her mouth that my gf REALLY like the delicateness and flavor of the scallops.  And had I had them before my steak, I would've agreed.  The steak was delicious.  It was a little tougher than the NY cuts I cook at home, but it was THICK and juicy.  I mean it's NY, not filet.  The creamed spinach it came with was also really nice and the relish was just the right amount of punch.\n\nFor dessert, there was a chocolate sampler and cr\u00e8me brul\u00e9e.  The chocolate was awesome.  It's hard to describe, but they had a small glass that had layers of cream and chocolate mousse with a chocolate crunch on the bottom with some sort of chocolate covered something (like berries) on the top.  It was accompanied by a p\u00e9tite brownie with raspberry syrup.  My brul\u00e9e was up there with the better ones I've had.  It wasn't too rich (common mistake) and it was perfectly creamy.  There were fresh raspberries on top and it was served with an almond/pistachio biscotti and chocolate ice cream.\n\nI will say for the money, the prix fixe menu was a good deal and the food was awesome.  There are plenty of places in the Fin District that tout great food but are overpriced because they've become complacent.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-09-10", "description": "I was part of a group that went to One Market this week for what could best be described as a \"business dinner.\"  Some of us drove over from Berkeley, and that worked very well:\n\nIf you make a 7:15 reservation and have three people in your car, you can slip over the Bay Bridge as a carpool if you hit the toll plaza before 7PM and then park essentially for free in a \"no stopping until 7PM zone\" on the Embarcadero, which of course you'll arrive in just after 7PM.  Neat, isn't it!  BART is a great thing, but it's missing a lot of its timed transfers in Oakland these days.  It really is no fun sitting around on a platform for 20 minutes late in the evening after a nice dinner in the City.  It was probably helpful that there was no Giants game scheduled for the evening of our visit.\n\nWhen we arrived at One Market at 7:15, the bar area was dense with fat cats who were numbing their taste buds with specialty cocktails before stepping out onto the street for a cigar or two.  Quite a few of those cats then took seats in the restaurant for their filet mignons and triple-digit Napa cabernets.  We avoided the cats and the cabs, but we did get occasional whiffs of the cigars as the main doors opened and closed.  If you're sensitive to smoke, request a table away from the podium.  (We didn't -- our bad.)  Full disclosure: I had a filet mignon, and it was a winner!\n\nAs other yelpers have reported, the atmosphere in the restaurant is serious and adult.  The service is very professional and a bit formal, but it's not stuffy.  The team who took care of us did a good job, except for one detail: after our server came to take our drink order and we replied that we wanted to look at the wine list, no one came to ask us for our wine choice for what seemed to be 20 minutes.  When the question was finally popped (\"what wine will you be ordering\"), I replied with a question or two of my own.  This triggered a visit from the sommelier, who was knowledgable, charming and helpful.\n\nWe ended up with a delicious sauvignon blanc from Somebody's Family Vineyard; I'm thinking that it was the Hall Napa Valley Sauvignon Blanc, but I'm suddenly not sure!  As a second wine, we had a Donkey & Goat mourvedre that was a real treat.  There are wines for as low as $40 (or maybe even a tad lower), but there are also plenty of bottles in the $100+ range.  Their chardonnays and cabernets were not bargain wines.  The bottles on the list were chosen with great care; clearly, the sommelier who came to speak with us loves every single one of her children.  All of the wines are from California.\n\nOh yeah, on to the food.  These guys take themselves seriously, and they include plenty of touches that signify high-end dining: an amuse gueule at the start of the meal, warm breads before your first course comes out, a fruit gummy on a stick when the check arrives.  (Maybe they should also include a jar of tranquilizers.)  The kitchen is definitely not running on auto-pilot, and I liked what I ate.  My starter was the \"Lightly Smoked Tasmanian Ocean Trout `Mi Cuit' potato r\u00f8sti, pancetta vinaigrette, pastured chicken egg\" @15.00, and I loved it.  For my main dish, I chose something simple, the filet mignon that I mentioned above.  It's Thursday's \"daily roast\": Filet Mignon, pancetta wrap, caramelized onions $31.50.  What comes on your plate is basically a big hunk of meat.  You definitely need one of the farmers' market sides, as they're called ($6.75 each); I selected the Saut\u00e9ed Spinach with garlic chips and was happy enough.  (The garlic chips were great.)\n\nTo summarize, this sounds like a 4-star experience.  However, I must confess that I haven't become a fan.  The restaurant feels too established, too corporate.  It's all a matter of taste -- I'd rather go elsewhere, but this may be your spot.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

I did enjoy it however as it came served with the items positioned in an empty bowl followed by a pour of the frothy soup to complete the dish.  This was perhaps my favorite dish, but of course, I'm a sucker for all types of soups.\n\n-House Veal Bratwurst over a bed of veggies - quite a disappointment in flavor and texture, but perhaps the most filling amongst the other options.  It was either this or a ravioli, or a fish.  Certainly this monstrosity would fill me up and it sure did.  Along with the shanghai bok choy that went with it, I'll give it that its a hearty meal, but to call it a veal bratwurst.....doesn't that usually mean bockwurst?  It wasn't that.

I consult all my favorite restaurant websites, I consider and reconsider the best location taking into account that I'm going to have to drive into The City at rush hour and she's going to have to find her way there from the Marriott in SOMA.  I carefully weigh the pros and cons of going someplace I've been to and like or trying someplace I've always wanted to go to and haven't visited yet.... accessible food vs. innovative.  Why can't I be normal and just select something good enough and move on!!\n\nAnyway, I decided One Market was the best fit for all my overwrought criteria.  I hadn't been there for awhile.  I like that their valet parking is probably more economical than any nearby lot ($10), and since I'll be getting out by myself, I don't have to question the safety of walking through a lot at night.  \n\nK was late, and since there's nowhere to sit except the bar, I had them take me to our table to wait.  I started with a martini with extra olives and sipped while perusing the menu (on to my next obsession the perfect food order).  The place ended up quite full, but our service was pretty good, even if we did  have to have  our busboy flag down our waiter to get our wine order.  I had the nightly rotisserie special, veal on Wednesdays.  When it came it was a plate almost completely covered with lovely, smokey, perfectly pink slices of what I think was from the leg with jus, and nothing else.  The waiter had warned that it came all by itself, so I ordered the sauteed spinach with garlic and fried green tomatoes on the side.  The spinach with the light golden garlic chips on top was perfect.  The green tomatoes had too much breading to tomato for me.  Though cooked correctly, the blue cheese mousse for dipping was too rich to go with the not very acidic tomatoes.\n\nK had the scallops with a sort of deconstructed caponata under and around it.  We didn't share, so I don't know first hand, but she liked it.  Then we shared a small dessert, some sort of macadamia nut torte,   which was just good, not great, but as someone who's not big on sweets, I appreciate that they have a selection of desserts that are smaller and less expensive.\n  \nTotal including the martini, one glass of Malbec, one of Sauvignon Blanc (both good, but short pours by my standards), SF. employee fee and tax was $118\n\nFood: 37/40\nService:  16/20\nAtm/facility:  17/20\nValue/intangibles 16/20\n\n=86/100 = B=4stars", "author": "Diane B."}

Now the knives looked cool, like hunting knives with a little bee logo soldered on (my bf's looked like it had fallen off) but it was a flat edge instead of serrated.  The knives looked like they were more meant for stabbing than cutting.  I was literally sawing at my steak and kind of wanted to give up half way through.  Also, the steak itself costs $33 and doesn't come with sides.  \n\nMy boyfriend and I ordered two sides which'll set you back about $6-7 each.

Creme Brulee was delicious and I adored the Key Lime Tart.\n\nHowever, the fact that we had to saw our meat to death (bf used a butter knife because at least that had a serrated edge) and the fact that the steak was nothing to write home about, was a total deal breaker.

Unfortunately, One Market did not live up to my lofty expectations. \n\nThe evening could not have gone off on a more sour note. We arrived at the front desk and a hostess had her back turned to us while she was on the phone. The other hostesses were running around until about 5 min later, one of them came out to take care of us. Mind you, there were about 3 or 4 parties behind us waiting to be greeted as well. \n\nThe other reviewers' knocks on the service could not be more true. Our waitress did not even give her name. I bet this is due to the fact that she did not want us to complain to management by name about her unbelievably poor service to come. She was condescending and borderline RACIST. \n\nI'll just say that we were asian and younger than our waitress, and there was an older white couple to our right who sat about 5 min after us. Our waitress took our drink orders and then returned with the order. She then went to the white couple, took their drink order and then began to recite the Specials of the day, which sounded awesome and we would have totally ordered one (ceviche-style scallops starter). When she came back to our table, she never mentioned the Specials. WTF?! Does she think we would not order any appetizers because we're asian or not sophisticated enough to know what ceviche is? \n\nWe also ordered bottled water. It was served out of a large glass bottle like wine, and the bottle was left on the table. It is a waiter's job to fill the glasses with liquid when it begins to run low, but this was not done. I actually made a point to refill our glasses with water when this bitch was at the older white's table (opening a bottle of wine) to show her she wasn't doing her job. \n\nOur food came out luke warm. WTF, again?! Our waitress didn't even serve us the food; it was served by another waiter. I even heard the bitch mumble a 'thank you' to him presumably because the food was just waiting in the window to be picked up and served. \n\nThe crab dish we ordered even had shells in it. What kind of fine dining experience is that? Maybe I was expecting to be blown away, but the food was average for the price. There's nothing outstanding about it or memorable to warrant such accolades. It was no fine dining experience at all. I've been treated to much better experiences at In N Out. The experience was so bad during the dinner that I started talking about what other restaurants had way better food (like Ozumo, Morimoto, and Eve) and other places we need to try (like King Noodle, Mission Chinese and Andalu).\n\nI ended the night with probably the lowest tip I've ever given for a $100 bill. \n\nI'll never go back to this place.

Trying to keep it light we were just looking for a sandwich. Since they were booked for another 2 hours, we had the option of sitting at the bar or the \"Chef's Bar\" which we opted for the latter. This gave a pretty amazing look directly into their kitchen and was impressive to see the cooks at work making Risotto, and fried greens, and my sandwich. \n\nThis menu was filled with exotic sounding dishes, none of wish I wanted for lunch. Their \"business lunch\" consisted of a 3 course meal, which was far too heavy for what I was looking for. I ordered the Cat Fish Po-Boy which seemed unlikely for a typically messy, sloppy sandwich. \n\nThis place is definitely pricier, and for the ones who enjoy splurging on lunches on weekdays. The food took a while to come out, and in the meantime we were offered appetizers, a bottle of wine, and perhaps another look at the menu. \n\nMy po-boy came out on a small bed of onion rings and the fried catfish sandwich. The breading was incredibly crispy and light, and didn't feel like I was eating pure fried oil. That contrast with the soft and fresh catfish was spectacular. The onion rings had a similar batter, and I actually tasted the onion as opposed to pure batter. The aioli in the sandwich was light and complimenting as well. \n\nMy boss got a plain burger, but there \"tater tots\" were these massive cylindrical drums of potatoes that were well seasoned and well cooked.

When we first arrived around 7:30 pm, the host had to tap the shoulder of said waiter a few times before he stopped chitchatting with his friends. Without really acknowledging us, he started walking, my date and I looked at each other and agreed to follow him. He then left us and didn't come back after 10 minutes. When he did, I asked him what cocktail would he recommend from the menu, to which he replied \"I am more of a shot and beer guy\". I would have appreciated the joke if he had followed it with an actual recommendation. But he mention he had no idea what was listed on the menu (WTF?). So I granted him a menu and asked him this time what was popular, he still didn't want to give me a straight answer, I then sensed his apathy and asked him for a glass of Riesling.\n\n When it was time to order, we chose from the Market Menu, as you get 3 courses for a reasonable price. We also ordered the crab cakes appetizer, which I've had before and are to die for. After the first course came and went, we waited over 20 minutes without service, and we realized that the crab cakes wouldn't be coming when we saw the second course arriving. He had the swordfish an I had the duck; They were both great, though I didn't care for the sauce accompanying my dish, (it just tasted like barbecue sauce.) As we were starting eating our main dishes, the waiter finally reappeared and said, \"I just noticed you didn't get your crab cakes. Do you still want them?\" We declined -as we were already enjoying our second course- and  he walked away, without offering any apologies. Then, the unimaginable happened. I tried to cut one of my mini potatoes in half, but... IT WAS RAW!  I told the waiter \"my potatoes are raw\", to which he responded \"I'd say\" Again, no apologies, though he said \"Can I get you anything else?\" (aka \"I don't really want to deal with you but I have to pretend I care\")  I think that when these atrocities happen in a restaurant like One Market, you have trained your staff to be more attentive and offer solutions, not just leave it to your patrons to figure it out. We then ordered dessert, plus a single espresso, but again, I had to remind them of the espresso once we were almost finished with our meal. My date had one look at the tab and called the waiter to promptly remove my dish off the total. (At that moment then became my personal hero :) )\n\n Our waiter never apologized for anything. Those words do go a long way, even if nothing can be done to remedy things such as a forgotten dish or a RAW POTATO!\n\nAmbiance is great, though.", "author": "Pony R."}

I'm not rolling in dough these days (far from it, like most of America), but lord, did we ever have a delicious meal here.\n\nMy boyfriend's birthday happened to fall during SF Chef's Week 2011 Restaurant Week, and how lucky for him - a $35 prix fixe dinner menu was all ours, and served by a young man who looked remarkably like one of my law school classmates.

The chorizo was a tad bit too chewy but still provided enough flavor in the sauce to compensate for the bland fish. Now on to dessert...\n\nThe blueberry cheesecake was A-W-E-S-O-M-E! Perfectly sweet, graham cracker crust was lightly coated all over the cheescake and the sauce was amazing! My only issue with it was its tiny size.

In response, the hostess told me that 'all food allergies can be accommodated.'  I requested that she speak with the chef specifically, so that he/she would have some notice to prepare a special entree, but the hostess declined, continuing to restate that all food allergies could be accommodated, and that I should just wait and speak with the server when we arrived at the restaurant.\n\nWhen we arrived and I mentioned the request to our server, we were told that there were three 'entree' options which are actually listed as side dishes on the menu:  asparagus, baby carrots, and spinach.  We were told that the the three sides could be combined to make an 'entree,' and that there were no other options.   To add insult to injury, this 'entree' of three vegetables cost nearly $25!\n\nAs you can imagine, it was a very disappointing meal.  I think many people would agree that a plate of grilled or sauteed vegetables, and a white bread roll, does not make a creative or inspiring meal.  I am frankly quite surprised that a high-caliber, renowned chef would not be able to create an original, thoughtful meal from local, farm-to-table, sustainably grown plant-based foods.  It really is hard to believe, especially in an age when most restaurant chefs have the expertise and flexibility to create high-quality entrees that satisfy a diversity of customers.\n\nThere are many chefs in San Francisco, and nationwide, who could have prepared a fantastic, worthwhile meal using plant-based foods, even in restaurants that prioritize meats and other animal foods.  I urge One Market to improve its ability to accommodate its customers.", "author": "Michelle M."}

There was a lot of different food, so I'm just going to quickly blurb about each.\n\nThe shaved beef tongue is not as unappealing as it may sound. It was quite savory, with a similar taste to roast beef, and soft in texture. It was good, just think of it as food not cow tongue. Or call it lengua so it sounds less like a body part.\n\nThe golden beet soup was slightly thick and deliciously sweet. They give you an almost bare dish with the fixings, but then they calm your fears when they start to pour in the soup AFTER they bring it to you. Same with the chick pea soup.\n\nThe chick pea soup is served cold, and had the same thick texture to it. It was refreshing with the mint, but personally mint isn't my thing. It's good in its own right though!\n\nI got the SMOKED TASMANIAN OCEAN TROUT with a chicken egg, potato sorti, and some kind of bacon garnishing. IT WAS DELICIOUSSSSSS. And it's pretty substantial for a starter, enough for 5 people to have a decently sized sample. I RECOMMENDDDDD IF YOU CAN'T TELL!\n\nI also got the Bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin as my entree. DELICIOUS. I love the bacon theme running through my meal. The pork was sooo juicy and tender. Couldn't have been better. And the veggies that came with it were nicely done. Thumbs up! But what took the cake was the glaze. Oh the sauce was SOOOOOOO SAVORY. It just took the dish to another level. YUM!\n\nThe herb-roasted potatoes were balls with a crisp skin. The herb was more herbal than I was anticipating, versus savory house potatoes you get for breakfast. It was still good though. \n\nFor the birthday boy, they gave him a complimentary butterscotch pudding adorned with \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate and the obligatory candle. \n\nThe chocolate souffle was delish. The fresh strawberry gratin(?) with ice cream reminded me of the sweet strawberries that come on funnel cakes. Just a neutral observation.\n\nDespite those fancy-pants restaurant that serve you bite-sized dishes for $50, I think One Market is worth its value. If I had the money, I'd come back soon.

It looked like a huge slushee, not just red colored juice which I was imagining but a mix of the yellow lemonade with the deep red raspberry.\n\nCHICK PEA FRIES (not on DAT menu but A MUST GET!)\nI've NEVER heard of a place that has chick pea fries! I imagined it to taste like hummus but it wasn't quite just hummus. For some reason, it wasn't oily at all and it was good with the aioli dipping sauce. Somewhat powerful so don't dip too much in it unless you want to just taste the aioli sauce. It's definitely worth the $7.50 they charge you for it. If you're scared of trying these chick pea fries b/c you don't like hummus, don't worry...it tastes SO much better.\n\nLENTIL SOUP\nThis was a cream based soup so I didn't really taste much of the lentil. I wouldn't go out of my way to order this but since it came with the DAT menu, I thought I'd give it a go. This tasted pretty good with the complimentary bread they start you off with.\n\nMUSHROOM POT PIE\nOMG. This was heaven! They bring out the pot pie in a pot and then they disassemble it for you. They take off the flaky crust and put it on the side of your plate, then dump the mushroom cream filling into your big plated bowl. There were a variety of mushrooms in here and there were no button mushrooms -- thank goodness! Button mushrooms are good but I think they're low-class mushrooms. This was paired off well with cubes of root vegetables -- carrots, potatoes, and a few others I can't remember. Yum. \n\nPEAR TART DESSERT (forgot what i's called)\nThis was so filling! I loved every bite of it and it was paired off with vanilla bean ice cream so it definitely had that hot-cold dessert kick to it. \n\nI like One Market and this is definitely a place to take your clients to if you want to wow them a bit. Good work, One Market. \n\n(Pictures to be loaded)", "author": "Heidi C."}

The food is also very good, albeit somewhat standard American Cuisine. They do throw in some interesting dishes such as the Pork-Basil stuffed Rabbit. I have ordered the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin and the NY Strip. Both were good. I thought my steak was prepared pretty near perfect. There are some other comments on here about the steak not presenting well, and not having a sauce or anything special on it. \n\nAs a steak lover, sauces on steak are frowned upon. This piece was perfectly cooked to my instructions and was delicious. \n\nBe sure to order sides as its more a la carte on that front. Don't miss out on the tater tots. So yummy. The deserts are also pretty good. I've had the Mint Chocolate Chip ice cream sandwich, and the blueberry cheesecake. Both were tasty.\n\nAs these dinners are expensed, I can't comment on the overall value for the quality you get.\n\nOnly negative is that while the service is good, I felt that the lags between attendance were too long. This may in part be due to the fact that both times I went they were really busy, and I was with parties of 7-10 people.\n\nOverall, you will have a pretty much guaranteed solid experience here. Great location, good views of Ferry building and the Chef's area, great ambiance, and a busy feel like you are in a popular restaurant.", "author": "Neal F."}

We felt suffocated as our waitress came every 5 minutes to check on us and chimed into our conversation. Wish I had a restraining order... With that being said, however, the food was the highlight of our brunch.  The dungeness crab cake in their petite size were delectable.  The house-made cavatelli is a must have.  It was just divine. If you have any room left (as we did since the portion size was nothing to boost) try the chocolate toffee almond crunch cake.

The weekly beast set meal is an awesome deal.  Four courses; carpaccio with foie gras shavings, beef cheeks, NY strip steak and brown butter tart with strawberry-vanilla ice cream.   Carpaccio was excellent, beef cheeks were on the heavier side, NY strip steak was well made and the tart was a good dish to finish with.  \n\nGf had foie gras and duck.  Foie was tasty but she thought duck was a bit dry however I liked it especially the earl grey jus it came with.  Mom had the crab salad and fish.  She liked both so no complaints there.\n\nThe restaurant was busy with couples, big groups and older people.  Comfortable booths, good lighting, wasn't too noisy, overall a great dining experience.\n\nThe only negative was the waiter.  He seemed friendly when he first came over to introduce himself but after we all ordered water, he barely said anything afterwards; he didn't even ask how we wanted our steaks cooked.  After I signed the check, he came, swooped it away and took a look to see how much I tipped him.  I tipped average but it was because the bus boys did well.  For whatever reason towards the end of the meal his attitude changed and finally asked how everything was on the third course.\n\nAnyway I would definitely come back and enjoy the weekly beast.

It's mostly a couples paradise or small gatherings to converse with the masses.\n\nBut if your don't care about the who's who and how to swim with the fishes at the bar you can bypass the bar and the main meat market room their is a bar section close to where they prepare the food this is the place to be, it is kinda warm you're about 10ft from the grill but other then that the noise is behind you and the awesome aroma of food is in front of you.

Their staff and service were friendly and prompt and their menu is a great combination of comfort classics, French standards, and more contemporary California cuisine that pushes the envelope just enough to get you out of your comfort zone with very familiar dishes. Best of all, they've got a great lunch special called the Businessman's Lunch which is a two-course lunch for only $22! \n\nAfter making a last minute OpenTable reservation for lunch, we got to One Market just in time to catch their last lunch seating. I ordered a glass of the 08 Testarossa Pinot Noir and soon after a perfectly warm epi baguette was bestowed upon us with room temperature butter (my favorite). I opted for the lamb carpaccio and OH MY GOODNESS. This is the best carpaccio I have ever had...and it was definitely on the list of best lamb dishes I have ever had. The carpaccio was incredibly rich and fresh tasting. I couldn't even tell it was lamb at first because it had such a clean taste. It was served with shaved asparagus, chives, a creme fraiche foam, and a nice, fatty piece of seared lamb belly; crisp and amazing-- a great contrast to the wonderfully melt-in-your-mouth raw lamb. Dad had the little gem salad which looked crisp and tasty-- served with cara cara navel segments and the boyfriend had the Ahi tuna burger which he gave two thumbs up. For my entree I went with the Roasted \"True\" Cod served atop a generous portion of chickpeas cooked in an onion-saffron broth with radiccio. The cod was roasted perfectly. Tender and moist but with crisp salty skin and just enough seasoning. The chickpeas were al dente but were very tasty. The broth was very well-balanced-- I wished it came with a couple pieces of bread to sop it all up. The picked onion garnish on top wasn't quite my thing as I hate picked things...but it was mild and went well with the cod. \n\nOverall, I think it's safe to say that I'll be back to try dinner.

I've been a special-occasion diner and happy-hour tippler here since it opened in the mid-nineties. Its unbeatable location at the foot of Market in front of the refurbished Ferry Building assures its longevity as a culinary destination, and it also happens to offer a fine menu that never seems to disappoint me no matter what latest food fad I may be following.\n\nAfter a long break, I took my good friend Maggie last week to thank her for a couple of free concert tickets she was giving me. Well, it wasn't a concert...it was Kathy Griffin at the Masonic, and she was a hoot. But that's another Yelp. Anyway, I had a splendid Cocoa-Rubbed Liberty Farms Duck Breast ($27.50) prepared \"sous-vide\" (which is French for \"really slow cooking\"...hey, I didn't know that either until I read it on the Food Network site, OK?). It was moist and tender, perfect really, and it came atop a sweet-potato puree in an orange reduction sauce.\n\nMaggie had the $27.50 Pan-Seared Day-boat Scallops that came with leeks and shiitake mushrooms in a brown butter vinaigrette. Simple but elegant. We shared two fine side dishes at $6.95 each - Brussels sprouts speckled with Applewood-smoked bacon and a Swiss chard gratin. But I have to say we saved the best for last - a $13.50 Mini-Platter of \"Singular Sensations\" - three specialty desserts beautifully presented on a single plate - the Chocolate Toffee Almond Crunch Cake, Bradley's Butterscotch Pudding with Chantilly Cream and the Chocolate Almond Parfait with Coconut. Ridiculously good.\n\nThe food was superb, the service a bit less so as we found the hostess oddly snooty and the busboy a bit too anxious. The waiter was nice enough but not as informed as we would have preferred about the menu, especially after Maggie asked a less-than-challenging question about a Hawaiian fish. It was also, as usual, extremely crowded.

Your mileage may vary.\n\nWhat an experience this was!\n\nFor our friend Cindy's birthday, her boyfriend Nick arranged a surprise dinner @ One Market.  Not just any dinner, but a Chef's Table at One Market.  This having been my first \"Chef's Table\" experience, I had no idea what to expect - - I just knew it was going to be pricey.\n\nWell, we gathered at the bar in the beginning, and by the time I got there, all of them were working on their first drink already.  I like this bar area at One Market, it was spacious, packed, and the drinks looked good.  Before I could get one, though, the hostess greeted us and we were led back.... all the way back.... through the first kitchen and then even further in - - until we got to the back kitchen.  Holy cow, we are sitting IN the kitchen.  \n\nEverything was already set up to start serving us drinks and dinner.  \nA manager came by to greet us, then the sommelier came by to help us pick our first wine, then someone else came by, then our wonderful server - and so forth.  Everyone just kept on coming by to say hello or check on us, it was wonderful.\n\nI've uploaded some of the photos from that evening to this page - - you'll see a special menu prepared just for Cindy - 6 courses plus a dessert tasting menu, and there was also an amuse bouche for the evening, which was a fabulous oyster w/ caviar adorning it.  \n\nI could write for pages on end about the food, but I will refrain.  Look at the photos and see for yourself - - every dish was prepared beautifully, and Chef Mark himself, or another person would come by to describe the plating, the ingredients, and answer any questions you might have about the food or how it was cooked.  Most of us liked the sea trout the most, which was amazing, but seriously - - all of the dishes were excellent.\n\nThe service was topnotch as well - which was great because we did have a lot of interaction with the staff here - and not only our server.  Our sommelier, Melanie, was at our table a lot since we drank 6 bottles of wine on this evening between the 6 of us, and once the restaurant tour began after the fifth course, we were guided by Francisco, who was outstanding.  Then, we were led into the cellar at One Market, and given a bottle of wine to share amongst all of us, and that was such a fun experience.  I'd like to live in that room for a month.  On our way back to our table for the last course, we got to joke around with Chef Mark, and the man is as great as his food.  He's just COOL.  \n\nJust when you thought that this was an amazing experience, they hand you two chef's jackets - - and Cindy picked two of us to go back to the pastry kitchen to meet the pastry chef, and help prepare our own desserts.  I got lucky and got sent back - - photos of that are uploaded too.  \n\nWe had so much fun helping out w/ the desserts - -  the chef back there and the staff was just fabulous - - and we got a real kick out of eating fried dough which they just had us taste, as it wasn't even part of the menu.  For those of you who have not had plain fried dough - you're missing out.  I'd do the Chef's Table again simply to do that part again, it was so much fun.  (I think this was about the time that everyone started commenting that I was having way more fun than the birthday girl was on this evening!)  Henry, Marc and I were loud and rambunctious back there, but they didn't hesitate for an instant before handing me the blowtorch.  Wow.  Not just that, they were so welcoming and tolerant of our antics  - - thank you, you guys.\n\nThe evening was truly spectacular.  It broke down to perhaps a bit over $200 per person - - but the experience was worth so much more than that, in my opinion.  It was terrific food, great wines, amazing staff, and just an all around fun time for all.  \n\nIf ever you are looking to host a Chef's Table somewhere, I recommend One Market wholeheartedly.  What a fun time!\n\nAnd this, folks, was SUPPOSED to be my 400th review, except I forgot I was at #399 and ended up reviewing something else that was totally not worthy of being #400.

There were a lot of families with the same idea because the food is always good and the restaurant is a beautiful place to enjoy.\n\nThis week, I went here for lunch with my friend Tracy who moved here from Boston and needs to try some of our local favorite restaurants. We went to One Market because they were offering the Dine about Town menu and we thought it was a great value ... 3 courses for $22.\n\nWe each had a salad and Tracy had Trout and I had lamb sausage for our main course. We each got one of the dessert specials and shared them. Everything was good and very good but nothing was outstanding ... except our server who was perfect with us and each table around us. He did a fine job with a full house.\n\nThe valet parking for $10 around the corner from the entrance came in handy. You get three hours so I went to the Ferry building after lunch for a little shopping. Overall, it was a nice afternoon in the city.", "author": "Lee R."}

I didn't know but Dine About Town had already started, so my gf and I opted for the DAT lunch. Two courses for $17.99! What a deal! We both started off with the gem lettuce salad (pretty good) and then I had the cod. Standard 4oz piece over chickpeas and a little spinach. It was okay, a little over cooked. \n\nOverall lunch was alright, its mainly business types for lunch where you can expense your food.

Since it is a 2010 Michelin star recipient, it seemed like a solid choice for us.\n\nOur dining experience got off to a bad start. It took a while to get seated,even though we were on time.  mostly due to the fact that the hostess mixed us up with another couple with a later reservation. Their reception area is small, so we were really in the way of all the people they seated ahead of us (and who came in after us to boot). It was a very awkward star to dinner. \n\nOnce seated, things improved markedly. We got our drinks promptly and the bread arrived shortly after. We had two options, white and olive. I opted to try the olive bread. Served warm, it was terrific plain and amazing with a dab of butter  That was quickLy followed by a lovely amuse-bouche made with tuna and tangerines. For dinner, I chose the market menu (3 courses for $39). For a starter, I chose the house-cured mangalitsa (bacon) with  bosc pear, wild arugula, and ni\u00e7oise olive powder. It was absolutely delicious. I asked about the olive powder. It turns out the olives are frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground up. The little bites were delicate in texture, with a lovely blend of salty, sweet, and peppery flavors. For a main course, I went for the roasted duck breast with duck leg confit, saffron, polenta, and a cocoa reduction. The duck was a perfect medium rare and the confit was served in a novel (to me) way. It was a brick of duck stuffing goodness. I ended things up with the butterscotch pudding with chantilly cream and a pecan wedding cookie. the pudding was rich and silky, the chantilly cream had a textbook consistency and the cookie was crisp and light. Dinner ended with another gift from the kitchen, a chocolate peanut butter truffle. it was really good, but it had a strong flavor that I didn't enjoy ending my meal on. \n\nOne Market is super convenient to BART and Muni, which was nice. Parking in the Embarcadero can be downright nightmareish. The atmosphere was good and the table service was as well. If I just based my review on food, I think they would have been a solid 4.5. \n\nTaking service into account, they slid down the scale considerably. Even though everyone was really friendly,I think the hostess should have taken a moment to figure out why we were still standing around 15 minutes after we had checked in. It was a really uncomfortable 15 minutes that got the meal off to a so so start.", "author": "Nicole M."}

I went with a large party, got plenty cocktails, appetizers, food, and dessert. And though I feel rather dinky rating an already Michelin-rated restaurant, there are a few things that need to be said:\n\n-The food is generally great, dishes were tasty, fitting the \"fine-dining\" experience of delectable but small portions in elegant plating. The crab was fresh, the foie gras complex and rich, the meat grilled and marinated deliciously.\n-BUT. Some of our drinks took forever and a half to arrive. It really doesn't take 30 minutes to mix a cocktail...\n-ALSO. Birthday girl received a dozen cupcakes as a gift. We opened the box and devoured them. One Market charged us a fee of $2.50 per cupcake eaten. As one guy in the party said, \"Hey, I brought breathmints. How much will that cost to eat in here?\"\n-They mostly humored our fabulously rowdy group, even throwing in some chocolate covered nuts at the end.\n\nAll in all, a good experience; much damage done to the wallet, fits the fine-dining experience, but the downer was the whole cupcake charge and the cocktails-that-took-forever. I get that this is a swanky restaurant and they don't want you to eat your birthday cupcakes inside, but it just didn't feel so friendly.

The ambiance is relaxed without losing a whit of elegance. There's a definite feel of rapport between the staff and Maria, our sommelier and hostess, was warm and attentive. What impressed me first off was that we were late for our reservation, and I called my parents up to order for us as the kitchen closed at 9. We were told they would wait for us as the food would get cold. :)\n\nI came here to have our first dinner with my parents. I wanted to impress them with some SF-style New American cooking, which they haven't had much of despite my family's long history with the Bay Area. To my pleasure, One Market more than exceeded my hopes. The food was just absolutely delicious and everything felt just right. (The only thing was that the waiter was a little hasty in refilling our glasses and splashed a little, but nothing else was amiss about the food or service.)\n\nI had the Shaved Beef Tongue with Napa cabbage for starters, which was unusual and tasty, though not really what I expected it to be (from my native cuisine I associate beef tongue with very tender meat, and I suppose I'm biased that way). Then my order of duck breast with farro, nettles and the homemade foie gras sausage arrived and I forgot everything else. One mouthful, and I knew I had to have it again someday. The duck breast was superb - a good cut of meat, roasted to melt-in-your-mouth perfection, resting on a bed of farro. The farro itself complemented the duck breast very well with its al dente texture, and the Earl Grey jus was excellent and tied everything together. I ate and lingered over every last bite; I think the last time I enjoyed a meal this much was on Christmas Eve, but that's another story for another time.\n\nFor dessert we chose the tiny dessert platter, and our selection was comprised of the creme brulee duo of espresso and vanilla bean, Valrhona chocolate pudding (topped with almond streusel and whipped cream) and the chocolate toffee almond crunch cake. Everything was as rich and sinful as it sounds, and I particularly enjoyed what I had of the espresso creme brulee (to my surprise) and the tiny dollop of vanilla bean ice cream accompanying the slice of cake. I'm only grateful that the servings weren't bigger, else some of us might have had more than what was good for us. I'm not a dessert person (and somewhat of a purist who likes the taste of the best part of the meal - in this case, the duck - to remain in my memory) so there would be no harm in skipping it if you feel so inclined, but I have to say, if heavy desserts are your thing, then definitely have them.\n\nThe meal ended on a warm note and we left in high spirits. My thanks goes to One Market for a wonderful evening.", "author": "Kit A."}

I started with the beet carpaccio which was pretty good (especially considering that I don't particularly care for beets). The ch\u00e8vre topping was actually really tasty. For my second course, I had the roast duck with andouille sausage. The duck was probably the best I've had. The portions were small too, which I liked. The andouille sausage, however, was awful. Unpalatable.  It had the consistency and taste of a heavily processed meat (think Spam), albeit spicier. The sausage may have been rendered particularly unappealing by virtue of the fact that the duck was so delicious, but that really isn't an acceptable excuse. Also, the sausage looked deceptively similar to the duck. Biting into it was a huge disappointment.\n\n\nMy girlfriend had the bacon wrapped pork loin. The pork was really good (tender, juicy, surrounded by crisp bacon), the potatoes, on the other hand, were considerably undercooked. Were I more of a diva, I would have sent the dish back.\n\nI had whatever unimaginative little chocolate souffl\u00e9 cake thing they had for desert; not particularly memorable. The cheesecake, was pretty good, but again, nothing ground breaking -- a small rectangle of cheesecake filling rolled in crumbled cinnamon graham cracker crust (I know, right?

The service was impeccable and the ambience was enjoyable as was the energy level for that time of day: not too hurried or rushed like some places can get. And the best part, I mentioned to our waiter that I had a 65 minute window in which to enjoy lunch and then I had to leave for a meeting nearby. He assured me that would be no problem (and I had this concern due to some previous YELP reviews that said lunch could take an hour-and-a-half or more). The bottom line was that it was a completely pleasant experience that included good food and service. The only bumps were the meager size of the food portions. I am a sensible eater who does not like huge portions of food on any plate ever since I was a child, but friends that know me would be shocked to find me finally admitting that I found a restaurant that actually served ME too little food!  LOL! My trout entre' lying very lonely and stranded in the midst of a huge sea of white bone china. This trout was a stingy filet cut of no more than a scant 1/4 \" cut piece thick and about 6 inches long down to the tail. The entire fish was gone in about 7 normal fork bites.  The Caesar's salad actually made me laugh when I looked down at the small saucer (7 \" diameter). It was really just 6 tender young romaine leaves about 4-5 inches long, laid parallel in a 2 \" high stack. There appeared to be only a whisper of dressing on them, along with 3 croutons and two 1\" x 1\" shaved thin slices (using a micrometer). I think it was a sharp, dry cheese - but my taste buds were short-changed without enough mass to determine flavor. \nBut, this is the way restaurants are serving food during this current economic depression our news media and government keep downplaying on TV. \nfor the $120 this lunch cost us (no dessert or wine, but including an $18 dollar tip), it would have been perfect if the trout and salad was another 30% larger in volume.", "author": "Dennis Y."}

The plusses - the Maitre D' was gracious and yet very San Francisco - comfortably formal and just enough fun to make me feel at home.  The timing of our courses was excellent.  Also, they were not at all put off that one member of our party was late and the other a no show.  \n\nThe food - everything was good but nothing really stood out.  I had the lamb's tongue salad.  While the tongue was well cooked and very tender, there was no much else to the salad.  The sauce and mustard were pleasant additions, but it needed more crunch to offset the soft texture of the tongue.  The salad had almost no greens, basically three small pieces on the plate.   The pork loin was very tasty and tender, beautifully cooked to a medium rare.  The portion was generous.  The grilled radicchio was a nice addition.  The faro was blandly unremarkable.  For desert I had bread pudding.  It was good but nothing special.   We were also served a \"PB&J\" amuse bouche - all I could taste was salt - and house made caramels which tasted a little burnt.  \n\nThe service was both good and bad.  One of our party was a little pushy with the waiter, and he handled it well.  However, there was a sort of an off vibe all evening.  The service was okay, but did not feel high end.  The busboys were weirdly intrusive.  I almost fely like the waiter had made a comment about the pushiness at our table and we were getting a bit of a smirk from the busboy (really, busman). \n\nOverall I feel like the experience at One Market has slipped considerably.

This restaurant belongs to the Lark Creek Restaurant Group and is probably their best restaurant. \n\nThe Food:\n  We went there for Mother's Day brunch and it was amazing. We started off with cheese doughnuts with bacon aioli. It was crunchy and fluffy, just the right way to start off a meal. It was followed by beet puree soup and beef tongue salad. Both were inventive, delicious and artfully prepared. The salad had a frozen horseradish dressing that was fun to eat. Then came the entrees, wow... best omelette I've had. Very light and fluffy but seasoned very well. The halibut sous-vide in the onion broth was cooked prefectly and had so much flavor. One of my favorites in the entire meal.\n\nThe Decor:\n  High Ceiling and very spacious. High window panes make for a very warm and comfortable atmosphere. Looking out I can clearly see the Ferry Building with people walking around. An open grill station invites guests to see the action with the meat.\n\nThe Service:\n  Our server was pretty attentive considering they had a packed house. There was number of large parties due to it being Mother's Day but we were treated properly.\n\nThe Summary:\n  Definitley one of my new places to eat in the city. This place is kid friendly so I will definitely eat here alot in the future. Next time I eat here it will be for dinner and I will order the tasting menu.

It is not inexpensive but if you either have the expendable cash for a dinner that can approach $100+ or are looking for a place to celebrate a special occassion, this is the place.\n\nThe bar is lively even on a Tuesday night at 5 p.m. It's primarily business people but I also saw a young kid with a backpack grinning ear to ear as he hosted his young female friend at the bar. The picture window, the location, it just feels good to be inside the space.\n\nThe dining room is large and I definately suggest dining at or near the windows. It's filled with an enthusiastic business crowd. Our server Steven Anderson was very quick on the trigger to confirm, advise although we were pretty decisive and just  be there when needed.\n\nWe were both drawn toward the same entree so I can't give a complete review on entrees but the Pan Seared Scallops were to die for. I am guessing there were fewer than 6 of them but the lobster emulsion ( and I don't even like Lobster) stole the show... the bubbling red broth, the creaminess of the mashed potato or sweet potatoes at the base and the crispy artichoke made the dish outstanding.\n\nWe order something that just sounded fun-- chick pea fries and I gotta tell you that dipping those fries into the lobster emultion... sent me ... Divine!\n\nAs the entrees don't come with anything not stated like the beef, chicken or whatever we also got a side of spinach which was wonderful but not out of the ordinary.\n\nWhat was however also out of the ordinary was the beet salad where instead of the typical chunks of beets they were sliced thin with radish, goat cheese and a vinagrette really beautifully plated.\n\nThis is all food to eat slowly while enjoying conversation as it's not hefty serving of food but a cause of celebration of food. Petite cuisine? You decide.\n\nGreat salad, great fries, great entrees.\n\nWhat was unusual is that without asking the bread server continued to bring over  a crispy white and an olive roll. Again, just impeccible and the servers just seem to be around without the need to hail them or if there was the need, the wait was only momentary.\n\nWe opted for the mini trio for dessert and got two gorgeous mini flans-- a coffee and a vanilla, various little cookies, a butterscotch pudding and a chocolate nut torte. Splitting them made it seem as if we'd hardly ordered much but again because the food is very rich and flavorful it seems that less is more here.\n\nWe wanted to try a great deal, didn't want liquor or coffees so we ordered more plates of food than one might but not the liquids and our bill still came to about $100 with the tax.\n\nIt was so darn memorable that frankly I can't help but recommend these folks highly. Their food is as good as the day it opened 20 years or so ago, maybe better.\n\nDid server Seven Anderson make the difference? I don't know but to be on the safe side you might request to be in his section.\n\nThey also have a new wine tasting room that can be rented for parties or larger parties that spread into the lobby of One Market so lots of creative ways to utilize this setting.\n\nI love the nearby Boulevard as well but simply hadn't dined for years at ONE MARKET and it turned out to be a great place to celebrate my birthday-- won't tell you which one!", "author": "ALLEGRA A."}

Having only been to one other Michelin starred restaurant (which completely blew me away), I expected a lot.  While One Market was good, solidly good, even wonderful at times, it was not the drop-dead, holy-cow good that I expected.\n\nThe service was excellent. We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation so we started with drinks at the bar. I rarely drink so I wouldn't know how to rate a drink, but the bartender and server get points here for listening to me. I told the server that I wanted something weak and fruity. Usually when I tell bartenders that, they still put in tons of alocohol. Here, the server listened to what I wanted, told the bartender, and brought out a drink that tasted like juice - exactly what I wanted.\n\nWe weren't even halfway done with our drinks by the time our table was ready. Unbeknownst to me, while I was in the bathroom my boyfriend had told the hostess that it was our anniversary and requested a special table. The hostess happily found us a great little corner table.\n\nOur waitress was great. She took time to explain the tasting menus to us, gave recommendations, and seemed genuinely happy to serve us.\n\nBecause we were expecting \"if eating this bite of food is the last thing I ever do, I will die happy\" food, we thought we better order as much of it as possible. We shared two starters, had our own entrees, and shared two sides and a dessert.\n\nThe starters were an heirloom tomato consumme and what I would describe as a trout eggs benedict. The consumme was definitely the highlight of the meal for me. My absolute favorite thing is when I can taste my food - particularly fresh fruits and vegetables - without having to rely on seasonings, fats, or anything else. A carrot that tastes like a carrot, a tomato picked at its peak - there's nothing like it. That's what this soup did, and it was wonderful. The trout was also good, just not my style. I think it'd be perfect for brunch, and I can see why people fawn over it.\n\nFor entrees, my boyfriend had the bacon-wrapped tenderloin, and I had tortellini. Both were good; neither were exceptional. I appreciated that there was a vegetarian option, and that it featured seasonal tomatoes, but it wasn't that exciting. My boyfriend enjoyed his pork, but noted that it wasn't particularly creative. They were both above average, but not exceptional.\n\nWe could have done without the sides, friend green tomatoes and tater tots.  I love tater tots, and homemade ketchup was nice, but it certainly didn't blow me away. I could find the same if not better at plenty of other places in the bay. Just like the entrees, the sides were above average, but certainly not innovative.\n\nBy the time we got to dessert we were pretty stuffed, but we made room for a sampler of 3 desserts, which were all good, none spectacular. The standout of the dessert was the \"happy anniversary\" written in chocolate on the plate. It was a simple touch that made a big difference. The staff really need not care that we were celebrating a special event, but they chose to acknowledge it, and we appreciated that.\n\nThe service was, for me, what bumped this restaurant up to 4 stars. I almost knocked it down to three for its cheesy gimmicks though. Beast of the week, banners outside advertising a seaonsal menu (I just *assume* I get a seasonal menu at a high-end restaurant. Why the banner?), and, quite possibly the worst aspect of the whole evening for me: table flyers advertising the owners' other restaurants. The ads really cheapened the place.\n\nI feel like this restaurant would stand better on its own, without the ads, and perhaps without the Michelin star. It was good. It was not Michelin star good. Had I expected less, I may have enjoyed it more.", "author": "Sarah F."}

We held a small reception for 35 people at One Market in the Atrium Room and Pavilion.  It was absolutely beautiful, and we were blown away by everything from the professionalism and assistance of the event staff to the wait staff's attention to detail to the quality of food and wine.  \n\nFirst, I have to say that Beth, Kristen, and Pamela of the event staff were phenomenal in helping us set up the reception.  They created a wonderful space for us and our guests to have hors d'oeuvres in the pavilion, lunch in the atrium room, and cake and champagne back out in the atrium.  They arranged all of our favors, flowers, and seating requests perfectly.  And, they accommodated all of our special food requests (we had to work with a few food allergies and my wife requested a small change to one of the offered dishes).  \n\nThe wait staff did a great job making all our guests feel comfortable, and they paced our event perfectly.  I have to give them special credit for this, since the bride and I were late arriving to the restaurant, and a few toasts went on longer than expected.  Nevertheless, our servers paid very close attention to how we were doing and timed everything exactly right.  We were never rushed.  Our guests always had plenty of water, wine, or whatever else they required.   And the service between courses was seamless.\n\nFinally, the food and wine were very, very good.  For the hors d'oeuvres we had rock shrimp tacos, seared tuna on house-made chips, and boneless chicken wings with chipotle glaze.  The seared tuna was definitely my favorite, but all our guests raved about all the hors d'oeuvres.  For lunch, we had a caesar salad and a choice of either mahi-mahi or a new york steak.  We served Merry Edwards sauvignon blanc and A. Raffanelli zinfandel for the wine (both highly recommended).  The steak was decent, but the mahi-mahi really stole the show.  Definitely one of the best fish courses we've ever had in San Francisco.  Even though my wife is a bit of a foodie, we were very pleased with the quality of the food, especially the mahi-mahi.  \n\nI would highly recommend One Market for an event.

I think that when you go to a restaurant, the food, atmosphere, service and experience should be able to meet expectations and my highly anticipated trip to One Market was definitely unable to do just that.\n\nOur party of 6 had a late reservation at 8:30 pm and found ourselves being rushed to order because the kitchen closes at 9:00 pm. That's fine, but there is a tactful and professional way of getting your diners to hurry it up. A friend and I shared the smoked trout appetizer and although it was interesting, it was by no means amazing. Then I ordered the beef cheeks and it had been highly recommended by yelp and yes, it truly does melt in your mouth. A good dish to try although I i found the sauce to be a little heavy. \n\nBetween the 6 of us we had ordered the steelhead on the DAT menu, bacon wrapped tenderloin and the black cod. Although all the dishes were beautiful and relatively good we did not get that \"mmMmMMMmm\" moment that is usually standard for fine dining. Trust me, we all are major foodies and truly enjoy those mmm moments.\n\nI am definitely glad that I came to One Market to give it a try but I don't think I will be back.

Good thing too because we spent almost $200 after tax and tip! Granted, we ordered 2 appetizers, two entrees, a bottle of wine, expensive scotch, and the 3 mini-desserts...so it wasn't actually all that ridiculous. \n\nMost of the food was REALLY good, but there were a couple meh items. \n\nFor appetizers we had the lightly smoked trout and heirloom tomato consomee.  The trout was served on top of a potatoes that resembled a crispy potato latke and under a runny egg. It may sound odd but it was SOOOO good. I was in love. I didn't like the tomato consomee, but my boyfriend seemed to think it was ok. \n\nFor entrees, we got the scallops and the Friday-night meat special which was lamb with a cocoa reduction. I don't eat lamb so I can't give my two cents, but he seemed to think it was pretty good but not amazing. I really liked my scallops, but I don't really know from scallops (I've only ordered them once before...that's the problem of growing up in a vegetarian family).\n\nFor dessert we got the three mini-desserts and chose the cheesecake, chocolate (pecan?) cake, and the mint ice cream sandwich. The chocolate nutty cake was DELICIOUS, the cheesecake was good, but the mint ice cream sandwich was suuuuper minty. Not at all what I was expecting. It was clearly made with fresh mint leaves and a whole lot of them. \n\nThe weirdest part of the night was when the old white couple sitting next to us (giving us odd looks for the 5+ minutes they were sitting there) asked to be moved.  I don't know why, but judging from the fact that they were only moved a couple tables away, I assume it was either:\n1. because we were being too loud (even though we weren't being loud AT ALL)\n2. because we were too young (in our early-mid twenties)\nor 3. because we're an inter-racial couple (my boyfriend is Filipino)\n\nI'm not saying that that reflects badly upon the restaurant, but it does say something about the type of people the restaurant attracts. \n\nAll in all, I enjoyed my meal but I probably won't go back anytime soon.

Unfortunately for me they somehow managed to lose my OpenTable reservation, an occurrence which seemed common after overhearing several people who came in have the same issue. The hostess was rather indignant, and asked me to step aside and wait for a table. I obliged as it gave me a chance to unpack the Canon from my camera bag and get quickly adjusted to the warmth inside the restaurant, a nice reprieve from the cold, windy day. After watching her sit another party, whose reservation they had also lost, I approached her to find out how long I would be waiting for tables which I could clearly see were vacant. She informed me when the rest of my party arrived she would sit me, so I responded, for the second time, that it was just myself and I would like to sit down now.\n\nBy the time I finally get to my seat I'm a little bit irritated, especially after the piss poor service the night before, but once I get attuned to the hustle and bustle of the atmosphere in this place I quickly become distracted by plates of delicious looking food hovering all around me. It doesn't take me long to figure out what I want, the \"Market Lunch\" here is an outstanding deal at just $28 for any 2 courses on the menu (plus another $4 if you want to add a dessert), and considering the quality of the food here could very well be the best business lunch special in San Francisco. My waitress was a bit aloof, and I'm not entirely sure she spoke much English other than what was required to serve what's on the menu, but she was deftly efficient at refilling my water and constantly asking how everything was, even if she didn't stick around to hear my answer. Fortunately for her, it was all great.\n\nMy first course was the handpicked Dungeness crab salad with avocado, tomato water, and a basil and corn sorbet. Visually this was one of the most beautiful plates (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=LmT61_oRntUy0OKZmdOrFg) I've ever seen, and the flavors that follow are equally impressive. I can only imagine how refreshing this dish must be on a hot summer day, every aspect of it awes you and makes you want more. They certainly aren't stingy with the crabmeat either, as the lump and diced portions were both very generous. At first the tomato water may seem a bit odd, and you begin to wonder why exactly this is called a salad, but soon you get past the texture unfamiliarity and being to enjoy every bite.\n\nAfter the light start to the meal, I really wanted something with some backbone, and they had the perfect match, house-made cavatelli pasta w/ lamb, nepitella, and house-made ricotta cheese. There were so many good aspects to this dish (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-pywNLq06dgqR48kbFR9w?select=3qIHIQ12Z4GXeq9H1DLVBg), you just simply have to try it. They even add some of the ricotta to the pasta as they're making it. The lamb is minced expertly, and so flavorful you just want to keep eating until the bowl is empty. I cannot praise this dish enough, if you come here and want the most filling, delicious lunch One Market has to offer you must order this.\n\nI wasn't initially going to order a dessert, but after the first 2 courses went so well I figured it was worth the mere $4 to tack on a few more calories. I decided to get the Sonoma apple crumb top pie w/ a blackberry sauce and vanilla ice cream. It was a good throw back to mom's desserts, with a little more flair.

I usually pick mashed potatoes as the side because I like to use the sauce from the chicken as a gravy. The mashed potatoes are very smooth and buttery. They kind of remind me of instant potatoes though they taste a lot better. They always seem a bit too thin to pick up with a fork but I keep ordering them so I guess it doesn't discourage me that much. \n\nThe butterscotch pudding is very rich and the taste is almost caramelized, which I really enjoy.

I had not been there in many years. \n\nExcellent meal overall, I give it a 4.5 stars. Not a 5 because some of the dishes lacked flavor.\n\nDine About Town (DAT) is really a good deal. I cannot really afford to pay $80 for a prix fix dinner at a premium restaurant in SF, but $35 is a great deal a 3 course meal. And unlike some of the other restaurants offering DAT meals, the portions at One Market were big and we were stuffed when we left.\n\nI did the DAT Deluxe for $45 since they offered the Grilled Sardines and the Valrhona souffl\u00e9 cake options. DAT Deluxe gives one more access to the popular dishes like these and also the duck breast confit and the black cod.\n\nService was excellent. I suppose the only negative in this area was that the waitress told me about what is \"popular\". I hate to hear what is popular because most people do not have my taste buds. So telling me about what is popular is insulting. Other than that, she was phenomenal.\n\nWhen we first arrived at exactly 5:30, the restaurant was almost empty. However by the time we left at 7:15, every table was full. The crowd was not too stuffy either. No need for a suit and tie. \"Smart casual\" works just fine. Even nice jeans would be OK. \n\nOther restaurants should take a lesson from the speed of the dish delivery at One Market. Within 5 minutes of placing our order, appetizers were on the table. 5 minutes after the appetizers were cleared, entrees were on the table. We were never rushed, but we never waited and since we were on a time table to get to the Ballet, this speedy service worked very well. This is in sharp contrast to the Salt House Restaurant where my wife and I waited about 30 minutes for appetizers and about the same for the entrees. Never going back there.\n\nAdditionally, everything was served at the correct temperature. This is one of my biggest pet peeves. Hot items served luke warm and cold items served warm. \n\nThe cauliflower soup was all that everyone had said about it. Just perfect. Not an overwhelming cauliflower taste, but enough. Nice little bits of cut up scallops, pears, onions, etc. \n\nThe Caesar salad was good. Nice and neat. Perhaps a bit buttery/oily, but my daughter loved it.\n\nThe olive oil poached black cod was very nice. Tender and flakey, super moist, not too fatty. Nice little almond pieces were nice.\n\nMy wife liked her rice flake crusted Petrale sole in carrot-ginger emulsion, but I thought that it was a bit plain. It had a nice crispy top on it, but it was still plain. My cod was way better.\n\nThe skirt steak was quite tasty. My Mom and daughter both loved it. Personally, I felt that it lacked a little in the flavor category but I did not pay that much attention to it. \n\nThe bread pudding (Dulce de Leche) was not very good. I kept on hoping for some cut up chunks of apple in the  inch square chopped-up bread cubes, but that is not what bread pudding is about.\n\nWe brought in 2 bottles of our own wine but the wine adder to the DAT menu seemed like a great deal. $13 more for wine pairing. But since corkage was only $20 per bottle and since I only like French and Italian wines (and One Market only stocks Cali wines), I kinda had to bring my own. Note that this is a very good corkage price. Many restaurants of this caliber are quite a bit more.\n\nThe Valrohna chocolate cake was just a bit boring. I like mine a bit more runny and moist in the middle like a molten cake. Not chocolaty enough.\n\nThe apple dumplings with cr\u00e8me fraiche ice cream were quite nice.\nSince we were a bit unhappy with bread pudding desserts, they manager gave us a complimentary Bradley's butterscotch pudding. It was amazing. \n\nOverall, a phenomenal experience at a restaurant that has been around since 1993 and one might have expected to slip a bit. Also DAT often puts stress on these places and One Market shone throughout the experience. They deserve their one Michelin star if not another.", "author": "TJ M."}

I had decided that good wholesome food may be the way to go...  \n\nWell One Market revived my interest in fine dining.\n\nIt was a very special occasion for us - and we had originally wanted to do the Chef's Table (where you get to sit at the table behind the kitchen and actually get an explanation about each course that comes out) but there was a minimum 4 required for that to happen.  So we decided to try Chef's counter instead (at Matire D's  suggestion).  We actually booked for Chef's counter.  Even though on the night we were there, there wasn't anyone on the Chef's counter, I've been told that it can fill up.\n\nWe had decided to try the Chef's Tasting Course (for which there was no menu - it was whatever the Chef was going to give you).  I also decided to have wine pairing - it actually ended up being enough wine for both of us. \n\nStarters: Bread.  To Die For.  The choices were french bread and olive bread. Both had crusty outer and chewy inner. I'm not a huge bread eater but I could probably have had 10 of those...\n\nCourse 1: Amuse Bouche - Prawn in tequila foam\nCourse 2: Hand picked dungeness crab with jalapeno sorbet & jalapeno jelly (Under the crab) with apple water\nCourse 3: Grilled Octopus with scallion & wasabi paste with black garlic puree topped with soy foam.\nCourse 4: Alaskan black cod with crispy pork skin & pork cheek bones with soy sauce. Decorated with Pea puree & English peas.\nCourse 5: Duck breast with duck leg meat (pulled and pressed) Polenta puree & braised cabbage with valrona chocolate\nDuck jus reduction\nCourse 6: Skirt steak with dandelion collard garlic cream sauce with hanchi minchi mushrooms and beef peppercorn jus\nCourse Special (this was not part of the course but we requested this because we were staring at this being prepared in front of all night and were drooling all night - Chef was kind enough to give us this additional course) - Pork loin wrapped in bacon on top of mashed potato and pork jus (tender-est pork loin ever!)\nCourse 7 - we could choose any dessert from the menu. I chose chocolate fondant with irish cream ice cream and berries. (BEAUTIFUL)\n\nI can't say enough great things about this restaurant.  Portions were generous.  Every plate was flavourful (not bland or over flavoured in anyway). It was interesting seeing the sous-chefs working at each of the stations as well as the Chef being in charge of everyone.\n\nDefinitely going back!\n\nChef's tasting menu is well worth the money (I think it was $60-70  which is super reasonable for a Chef's tasting course)", "author": "Sujan H."}

It fancies itself as a figurehead of the Embarcadero and of the financial district.  I suppose that it achieves that with a little irony.\n\nThe kitchen is good; there's no disputing that.  But forget about ideas like customers being right and that sort of thing.  The dining room staff purport to know what's good for you and if you want otherwise, it's an argument.  Apparently, one thing that can be good for you is for your wine to arrive after your food, and it can be tough going to get some help to remediate the situation.\n\nConsequently, I choose the bar for a lower-stress experience.  Last dinner I ordered there was the seared tuna on mushroom escabeche (a bit in the \"fra diavolo\" vein) with a side of green beans and shiitake mushrooms -- a double mushroom whammy.  It was all very nice, and my waitress went searching for some soy sauce for me when I inquired.", "author": "T D."}

It's one of those places that you always see, sometimes hear of, never think about, and wouldn't necessarily go. BUT-- a Michelin rated restaurant always deserves a chance, and it blew it. One Market severely lacks in style, PIZZAZ! and outstanding service.\n\nThe restaurant itself is quite gorgeous, and boasts a pretty view of the Bay and the Ferry Building. Its location is perfect, particularly if you want to entertain guests from out of town. Its the kind of place you don a dress for a date, and enjoy and evening of what they like to call 'fine' wine and 'fine' food. The word 'fine' is disputable in this instance, so I'll let you be the judge.\n\nFor a restaurant bustling with waiters-- my poor gf got bumped in the head by wait staff more often than she was actually served. Our service was slow, our drinks were slow, and when our food finally came out, there were definitely no fireworks! We started off with pumpkin soup and a beet/ goat cheese salad which certainly looked fancier than it tasted. I mean, if the arty pumpkin soup pour over a 'yoghurt cloud' doesn't make it taste any more tastier then I would prefer you to skip the theatrics and just top up my water please. For my entree, we ordered the pork medallions, pumpkin ravioli and seared scallops, and, expected, all were good-- but definitely not great.\n\nOverall, a very mediocre experience.

And she was a wine ninja, she would pour the wine before people would finish (which i guess is nice) but not when you don't know how to pour wine! UGH in any case, it was a company paid lunch, so I wasn't as angry as I would have been if I were paying.", "author": "Angela H."}

Maybe that was a good thing, because I really, thoroughly enjoyed everything and the entire night was incredible.\n\nThe menu:\n\nOyster amuse bouche - yummy, nothing special\n\nDungeness crab salad with apple, celery root, and a celery sorbet - Honestly, I'm a little tired of dungeness crab salad. I think if you're going to do it, you've got to do something really special. The salad was not anything special. The celery sorbet was very nice, and I may have been more blown away by it had I not just had some at Citizen Cake the week before. All in all, a solid dish, but I was bored with it.\n\nSpring Vegetable Salad with banyuls vinaigrette - This was very good. Asparagus, fennel root, fava beans, and other yummy stuff. All green and gorgeous. Very nice dish.\n\nLightly Smoked Tasmanian Sea Trout \"Mi Cuit\" with potato rosti, quail egg, and warm pancetta vinaigrette - This dish was incredible. My boyfriend hates most fish because it's just too fishy, but even he loved the trout. It was so lightly smoked (but fully cooked) that it looked raw and tasted perfect. The egg was a nice addition, and the warm pancetta sauce was incredible. It also played up the light smoke taste quite nicely.\n\nSeared Day Boat Scallops with gnocchi, fava beans, hon shemiji mushrooms, and a carrot-cardamom emulsion - The dish is great, the scallops, not so much. I love scallops, but I felt these were overcooked. The gnocchi with the carrot-cardamom emulsion were fabulous, though, and I would have loved the dish had it not even included the scallops.\n\nLiberty Farms Duck Breast with duck leg confit, rhubarb, sweet potato-vanilla bean puree, and five spice jus - BEST DUCK I'VE EVER HAD. No kidding. Best. This was absolutely incredible. Everything about it. YUM-O.\n\nAlmondwood-Grilled New York Steak, parsley root puree, green peppercorn sauce - Very good classic dish. Nothing innovative, but that's not necessary. Not a WOW dish, just a very nice course.\n\nThe dessert sampler included banana pudding, butterscotch pudding, a mint chocolate ice cream sandwich, two kinds of creme brulee, a toffee-chocolate cake, a lemon pie-type dessert, and an assortment of cookies. The only things that stand out to me are the lemon thing and the butterscotch pudding, which were very very good, and the toffee cake, which just didn't play up to everything else and kinda got lost in the midst of other desserts.\n\nI was a little surprised that we didn't get any kind of cheese course, and there were no take away goodies. Sitting at a chef's table, I really expected that. \n\nBeyond the food, the experience was incredibly special. First of all, the chef's table is totally affordable! The meal above, eaten in the kitchen, with a private tour of the restaurant, the kitchens, the wine cellar, and constant conversations with the chef and the sommelier, PLUS the wine pairing with each dish, PLUS two of us got to help make the desserts - $165 per person, including tip and tax. INSANELY affordable for the experience. I strongly recommend that if you're planning on eating here anyway, you go for it and do it right.\n\nBonus points for the following:\nChef Mark was extremely cool and we had fun talking with him.\nWe REALLY loved one bottle of wine, so they let us finish the bottle.\nMelanie the sommelier entertained our crazy questions and seemed to really enjoy making the wine pairings as she went along.\nService was excellent, of course.\nThe happy hour in the bar before dinner was also very affordable, with GREAT drinks. Try the pomerita for $5!\n\nI'll definitely go back.", "author": "Monika M."}

My first impression was the customer service was lacking, no one greeted us or acknowledged we cam through the doors. We found our friends and then were seated right in front of the door which was a little unpleasant considering every time the door opened a crazy gush of cold wind came through. \n\nWe brought two bottles and put the first on the table. The Sommelier came to our table, we asked if we bought our second bottle would they waive the cork age and he said \"no do not worry about it, i will waive it for you, you do not need to buy a bottle\". So we thought.. wow that is pretty cool. We drank our first wine and decided to open the second since apparently it did not matter if we bought one of their wines. The Sommelier came back around and asked if \"everything was okay\" and blatantly looking at the wine bottle as if we did something wrong by not buying a bottle??.. which was really uncomfortable for everyone at the table \n\nI ordered the Cauliflower Soup which I thought was delicious, I also liked the way it was served; the bowl comes with the smoked Nantucket Bay scallops, pickled ramps, asian pears and then they pour the soup over it. For my main I chose the Grilled Bay Leaf Marinated Skirt Steak which I enjoyed. And for dessert I had the Valrhona Chocolate Souffle Cake which was actually off the second dinner option. ( my boyfriend and I traded )  Which ended up being a mistake because the Dulce de Leche Bread Pudding was AMAZING! and I never like bread pudding. I also sampled the Apple Dumplings which I liked but did not love. \n\nOverall I enjoyed the meal it was worth doing for DAT, However no one said goodbye thank you for coming when we left .. which to me is offensive you have like 3 people behind that desk.. the customer service is lacking.. not to mention they charged us cork age for both of our bottles.. To me that was in poor taste and rather offensive.. I don't know that I would go back mainly because customer service is important to me when I am dining out .. its not always just about the food but the entire experience.", "author": "Alexa V."}

Service was efficient until the end, when we were ignored a bit and had to flag down the waitstaff for the check. Drinks were very clever and good- hubby had a classic Manhattan which he thoroughly enjoyed and I had the one with basil. Unique flavor but too strong for me to finish!

Since there were other tables available, I promptly requested a different table and my request was accommodated efficiently but not necessarily graciously.\n\nWhen I made the reservation I mentioned that I had a gift certificate I would like to use that I had been awarded at a benefit auction.

I'd been a few years ago and left unimpressed but with its bloodlines I felt a second look at the was in order...especially since I dine several times a year at Lark Creek Steak.\n\nA Tuesday night gave us a little breathing room to get a good table. After a Belvedere martini at the bar we were shown our table. Not too crowded at 6:30 (almost unconscionably early for dinner for me), the service was almost as attentive as I might have expected. The waitstaff was fine and everything was well delivered though perhaps a bit impersonally. We ordered right away.\n\nI started with Geoduck Clam \"Chowder\" with herbed cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, celery, and house-cured pancetta. As you often see at good restaurants, the ingredients are offered the broth of the soup at the table giving the diner a chance to see the ingredients before mixing while keeping them from being overcooked. It worked well. The clams were fresh and tasted like clams. They kept their texture and weren't rubbery as when they're overcooked. The dish was very good. Perhaps a bit less cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche might have kept the dish a bit hotter but it was creamy and good. \n\nFor the main course I ordered the Roasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast\nand duck leg confit with saffron, anson mills polenta, and cocoa reduction.  The breast was particularly fatty which meant lots of flavor but the ratio of fat to meat meant a less than satisfying entree. The confit and accompanying polenta were very good. A 2007 Freeman Pinot was good.\n\nDessert was Bradley's Butterscotch Pudding with Chantilly cream, and a pecan wedding cookie. It was lovely though perhaps a bit small in portion size.\n\nI should mention that I ordered the three-course Market Menu.

My hubby wound up getting tempted by the \"weekly beast\" (it was rabbit) and decided to skip the DAT dinner, while I got the \"deluxe\" version of DAT for an extra 10 bucks.\n\nI had the cauliflower soup as the appetizer. The portion wasn't huge (almost the same size as one of my hubby's 5 courses), but I thought it was enough for soup. The duck entree was much larger, it came with three large slices of duck breast plus some duck confit. I thought it was very tasty and definitely worth the extra $10. The chocolate cake was really good too, it was more like a flourless chocolate cake instead of a lava cake, which I prefer anyway.\n\nSince the hubby had the 5-course while I got a 3-course , I also ordered a cheese course, since at first I wanted an extra course to even things out a bit. I think it wound up being a bit unecessary though since my entree about the same size as his 2 courses. We only ordered two cheeses, but they sure gave us a lot of bread, grapes, and marcona almonds to go with it. I was already stuffed before we even had dessert.\n\nThe wine pairings were $20 for the 5-course (4 wines) and $13 for the 3-course (2 wines), and the pours were extremely generous. My hubby had around half a glass for each pairing and I had almost a full glass for my first course and a full glass for my main. If more restaurants offered pairings these affordable I wouldn't ever bother bringing my own wines.\n\nWe were initially going to go because of the DAT deal, but I was pleasantly surprised that their menu and wine pairings are very affordable for a 1-Michelin star restaurant. I would probably go back even without the DAT deal. The weekly beast is definitely a bargain at $50, and I would like to try it especially they have duck or pig on the menu. \n\nWhile nothing blew me away, I thought this place was an excellent value for DAT and their other prix-fixe options.", "author": "Arlene M."}

We were seated at a round table. We ordered wine and one of the glasses came with a huge lipstick stain on the rim. I pointed it out to the waitress and as she went to pick it up she dropped my full glass of red wine, which broke. The wine went all over my arm, leg, and chair and there was broken glass all over the floor. They handed me a towel to wipe things up and didn't completely wipe up the wine nor the glass on the floor. They pushed my husband and my chairs far apart around the spill/stain and then put a napkin over the large stain on the table instead of changing the table linen.

As usual, I arrived late and a bit flustered due to almost having ran the valet over when my too-high-heel slipped off the brake. Oops, lucky for him he's quick on his toes otherwise he would have lost it to my rental. \n\nAnyway, I needed a stiff drink or two and the cocktail and wine list easily sufficed here. Each of us had a starter and surprise, surprise, I ordered the seared Fois Gras - ah, such the predictable creature of habit am I. Two of our party ordered the Yukon Gold Potato soup to start and yes, I did experienced the rare Appetizer Envy. A bowl was set in front of them that contained a dollop of creme fresh with lovely bits of bacon sprinkled on top. Then server the slowly poured a steaming stream of potato goodness all around it. It was a decadent display that made me make a mental note of \"Next time.\" \n\nOne of my dining habits, aside from ordering what no one else would, is to always try the chef or house special. I am rarely, rarely disappointed and, unfortunately, that night I was. One Market boasts a daily roast and Wednesday's roast was a Mishima Ranch \"Wagyu\" Top Round with natural jus. You eat with your eyes first and the first thing I wanted to do was close my eyes. The muddy burgandy color, albeit, medium rare red, was not at all appetizing. The taste was less than par and this cut of meat would have been better served on toasted a toasted pretzel bread, with a horseradish spread and caramelized red onions.. just a suggestion. \n\nHaving graduated to Entree Envy, I looked across the table at my colleague who was thoroughly enjoying his duck breast.  Damn him.  Forget about the special, trust your first gut instinct and order that.  \n\nOn to dessert, at this point, my dining experience was going down in flames and the final fireball came with the mint ice cream sandwich.  The chocolate cookie part of it was fine, it was the overpowering basil flavor of the home-made ice cream that sent me over.  The mint was near or non-existent.\n\nEveryone else in the party enjoyed their meal - good for them.  Picky me, well, it wasn't my night, but I lucky us, there are hundreds of restaurants yet to be Yelped.", "author": "Jenny D."}

The first time it was the chef's tasting menu and sandwiched between Manresa and Gary Danko.  Suffice to say it was inferior compared to the others and I was jaded.  \n\nThe second time, was a week ago and wow, it was amazing.  I had really forgotten how good it was.  There is a little more creativeness with the food and presentation that I had forgotten that really has pushed this place further up on my list of places to eat at.\n\nI ordered the Hand-picked Dungeness Crab and it was excellent.  What makes it interesting is the green-apple water that the crab is presented in.  It is almost a water jelly and the textures are very unique.  My sister didn't like it at all; however, I loved it.  A very unique dish in the presentation.  Pretty impressed on an otherwise simple dish.\n\nAs for the main course, I had the Ono, which was cooked sous-vide, and it was delicious.  However, again, its presented in a unique way that suggests more of an artistic flare. \n\nMy girlfriend had the Thursday night daily roast.  Which is the roasted filet that is wrapped in pancetta.  Amazingly good and a lot bigger than the waiter suggested.  I think he said 8oz and its more like 10oz.  Really big and incredibly good with the pancetta. \n\nOverall, I can't complain.  More realistically, I'd give this place a 4.5 stars but I can't.  Its worthy of that one star.  May not be the 5-star like Manresa and Gary Danko, but I'm splitting hairs here.", "author": "Mark K."}

Time to go back, since I seem to have hit every One Star restaurant in the City but the one that is closest to work.\n\nSo I finally went there for lunch.  I did the Dine About Town menu, figuring it was a good bet:  Market Salad, Duck Confit in red wine risotto, Chocolate and Butterscotch pudding\n\nImpressive.  The flavors popped.

Mind you this is a Whole beast dinner! \n\nA country pate- It came looking pleasant, however, after the first bite I turned to my friend and quietly said it tasted like dog food. If you're going to say country pate, let's have some of that lovely coarse texture and some flavor of duck! The brioche served with it made the mushy paste seem worse due to its Wonder bread softness. \n\nDuck risotto- First impression of the plate - The dishwasher threw up in a bowl and they served it to me! \nIf the look of it wasn't bad enough, it tasted like nothing, the rice, if it was rice in the thing, was so soft it was no longer definable as rice. All topped with a parmesan foam, FOAM, yeah well I could go on a rant about foam in risotto so I'll leave it at the fact that we both had 2 bits and informed the waitress it was inedible!  \n\nDuck breast- Cooked perfect! Too bad the chef decided it was a good idea to put pure Tahini on the plate, ok so eat around it. The freekin waiter drops the plate and tells us that there is Kombucha squash on the plate and walks away. I say to myself well at least the duck and squash will be a good. Yeah, NO, the squash, get this, the squash is actually cantaloupe! Yes, it actually said it on the menu, too, not Kombucha Squash.\n\nThankfully, the dessert was fine, just fine\n. \nFor a whole beast meal it lacked the whole beast and any creativity on the chef's part. I don't know, maybe the chef was out smoozing the tables and not back in the kitchen making sure some quality came out.\n If you're going to offer such a tantalizing thing as a whole duck then don't feed me a shitty tourist meal you're trying to make a few extra bucks on the turn. \n\nThis is still San Francisco and people come here to eat!", "author": "Jabir P."}

Some of the best table bread I have ever had. LOVED it! I ordered off the DAT menu: farmers market salad and dock confit. The salad was light and refreshing, a good start but nothing special. The duck confit was delicious! Not too heavy (even with a bowl of risotto), lots of great flavors, interesting texture. My co-worker ordered the Cobb salad. When it arrived we were both a little confused. It appeared to be a couple pieces of lettuce, some avocado slices, bacon and poached quail eggs on top of something that resembled a pita or flat bread. Turns out it was thinly pounded boneless, skinless chicken breast under the salad! Very well seasoned, the chicken alone encompassed all flavors that go into a Cobb salad. It was a very unique presentation on a classic favorite.\n\nThe only bad thing about the meal was that our server was kind of all over the place, and she took a very long time to bring our entrees.

The atmosphere and location are excellent. The service was reasonably attentive, and the drinks were tasty. The Amuse Bouche of tuna with wasabe was pretty good...a bit fishy, but again, pretty good. \n\nWe went there because my boss' wife wanted \"american\" food, and i could not get a reservation at Town Hall for a reasonable time. I should have dropped a $20 on the reservationist at TH...the two restaurants are in seperate leagues. For the money, One Market is no where near the quality it should be. For that matter, the Lark Creek Group, is no where near the quality it once was. \n\nThe appetizers around the table were OK...but just ok. My fennel soup was salty, not much crab, and generally uninspired. The crab salad my boss had was much more of science project with gelatin cubes and jalapeno sorbet than crab. The foie gras my wife ordered was delicious....and my boss' wife's salad was, well, a salad!\n\nAs for the main courses, the two men had lamb shank. Dry, rubbery, salty, on a bed of very salty lentils. My wife's pasta was thicker than Pasta Pamadoro. Once again, my boss' wife chose well...she had the black cod, which looked delish. We shared a few sides, brussel sprouts, spinach, and chick pea fries. All were better than the main courses....\n\nAs for dessert, this course was the highlight. We had to order a second butterscotch pudding it was so good. The choc souffle was also incredible.\n\nI feel slightly guilty giving such a low star rating, HOWEVER, SF is a foodie town, and if we are being honest, One Market did not live up to its reputation nor the cost of the meal.  Two stars means \"Meh, I've experienced better\". That is definitely the case. It should also take into account the $75-100 per person cost. One Market is categorized as a top quality SF restaurant. It is not. If you have 1) a discerning palette, 2) experienced top quality restaurants here or elsewhere, and are 3) honest with yourself about your culinary experiences, this is not a place deserving of its accolades.

Of all the Dine About Town places that I have tried in the past (Tommy Toy's, Big 4, Cassis, etc) I have to say that One Market might be one of the best ones for your buck.\n\nThe problem with other places is that (as Vicky L. pointed out) they \"dumb down\" the menu.  Instead of the other delicious sounding choices, you get choices that are ... well... what you pay for.  With One Market, I was really impressed with their asparagus soup (perfectly seasoned with a poached egg and bacon).  Although the Halibut Cheeks weren't anything to make me squeal with foodie delight, it was a well prepared meal.  They paired the firm fish with hearty vegetables and clams.  \n\nThe creme brulee was nice, crispy and caramelized (I've had some that weren't -- booo) and the spark plug is a really delicious concoction of coffee and coffee liqueur.  \n\nIf you're looking for a good DAT choice, I'd suggest One Market.

Also Eve smile points for offering wine pairings\n- Beef cheeks: a big hunk of braised meat that was oh so fork tender and soaking in tasty saucy delicious flavor. Black spaetzle wasn't very peppery and more similar to linguine form, but in the sauce was buttery goodness. Superb dish all around that I'm sure I'll be wanting again--possibly soon.\n- Brussel sprouts: I'm a sucker for brussel sprouts and was delighted to discover my visiting friends are too. They were perfectly charred with thick pieces of bacon to add some saltiness and enhance the side dish.\n- Wine list: substantial options by the glass (including one of my faves the prisoner) and popular local wines as well as a few others by the bottle.\n- Bread: Siamese twin pieces of football shaped French bread. Interesting having them stuck together, but had the basics down: warm and soft on the inside and just the right amount of hard crispness on the outside.  \n- Chick pea fries: quite interesting middle eastern flavors. Quite a hearty item, held it's form, and not greasy at all.     \n- Small dessert sizes: coined \"singular sensations,\" these are mini versions of desserts. As a savory food lover, I don't need much to end my meal so this fits the bill. Butterscotch pudding as well as banana cheesecake were excellent.  \n\nLowlights:\n- Wine awkwardness: when my friend asked about a wine selection to go with both her starter and entr\u00e9e, our waitress fumbled through notes of paper and informed her of one that pairs well with just her starter. I have no issue with servers not knowing wine pairings off the bat, but if it's not part of your expertise, just hand it off to the sommolier--either by saying you'll consult them or sending them by the table. I ask for pairing suggestions often and it's usually a seamless process. Also I found it odd for the dine about town menus, we were told there were the same 2 wines no matter the menu choice. Sure, some wines are that versatile, but I like the idea of a pairing being matched to a specific dish.\n\nBesides the blip in the service, I quite enjoyed my meal here even more than I was expecting.

I was glad, as I was not fancying the soup all that much.  the parmesan flan bites were great with the soup, but on the bites were the flan ran out, the flavors were a bit too much for my likings.  It, to me, was like eating a bad baby food, that you would expect a kid to spit back up.  \nFris\u00e9e Salad bellwether farms lamb belly, king trumpet mushrooms.  this is a interesting salad, which i had never had the likes of before.  as i stated this plate started with my wife, who could not get over the lamb belly \"fatness\", so i was willing to switch, as i didnt fancy the soup.  this was an interesting flavor.  the frisee was bitter on its own, but when you added the fat flavor to it, it worked and tasted pretty darn okay.  that being said it was still hard for me to take down the chunks of fat.  \nGrilled Black Drum kohlrabi-daikon slaw, ramp vinaigrette.  this is the plate that i started with and then passed on to my wife.  I enjoyed this dish, i thought that the fish was very flavorful and tender, well cooked and spiced.   Potato Gnocchi parmesan puree, hon shimeji mushrooms,fava beans, English peas, carrot emulsion.  i thought that this was a nice dish, the gnocchi was tasty and smooth, nothing mind blowing. \n\nthe staff and service was great, very accommidating to our needs and very kind with their service.", "author": "Nick S."}

A few of us ordered the lobster risotto, our waiter and the kitchen were somehow not on the same page and we were delivered the shrimp Louie salad instead. We told the waiter it was a mistake, but he insisted that was what was ordered. Since i had a glass of wine to start,  I was starting to doubt myself that maybe I slurred during ordering? Only one of us who ordered the risotto got the risotto. We stared at the salad wondering at this point if we should just eat it since most us of had to be back to work. The vendor who took us was embarrassed because he chose the restaurant. Anyway, since we breathed on the salad it was considered ours. Finally the waiter found our order lost in the kitchen, and runs out to ask if we still want the risotto - it will be 20 min. Otherwise, there is the salad. We all agreed to just eat the damn shrimp louie salad since we all had to be back at work!   Salad was excellent but my mouth watered for the risotto! My coworker let us have a taste and that's it! \n\nThe second time was for my sister's bday celebration during Dine About Town.  I chose One Market because of convenience and location to my office. Plus we couldn't get in anywhere else during lunch! \n\nAgain, service very slow. We waited 15 minutes for a server to acknowledge and another 5 for water! WTF!

The fish was alright, nothing Red Lobster couldn't concoct on short notice. The asparagus was cooked wonderfully, just the right amount of crispness with a hint of spice. \n\nDessert: Ohh it was the best part. Vanilla creme brulee with a biscotti cookie. Now I love creme brulee. I mean, anything that requires a blow torch to complete is fantastic in my book, but this was incredible. The creme brulee didn't even have a hint of egg-flavor and they use real vanilla. There was actually the black seeded look of vanilla beans throughout the dish. The biscotti was alright, a bit bland in comparison to the creme brulee, but perhaps that was there intention.\n\nAll in all, a fairly decent meal for the financial district.

And reading previous yelp reviews didn't really tempt me either.  But, I decided to give my benefit of the doubt and try out.  All in all - it was a thoroughly pleasant experience, the food was better than decent, the service was seamless and courteous and the decor of the restaurant was very pleasant and calm.\n\nSo - four of my friends and I sat down to a table....it could have been nice to sit at the window table with a view of the Embarcadero but whatever.  We were immediately greeted by the server and were offered drinks - got my usual and they were brought out immediately.  The server came by to answer any questions that we had on the menu and explained chef's specials, dine about town menu.  I could tell that she studied the menu well and she knew what she was doing.\n\nMy first course was a simple caesar salad...i never get this because i normally think it's boring, but for some weird reason, i was craving it, got it, and enjoyed it.  The romaine lettuce was well coated with the caesar dressing with a very nice fragrance of the parmesan cheese and was complemented by the home-made crunch croutons.  My friends had various other appetizers - the cauliflower soup looked great, the sardines and the octopus dishes all looked great.  Oh, and I requested for the wine pairing a little too late but they brought the wine just in the nick of time.  My caesar was paired with a crisp glass of pinot grigio...nice.\n\nMy second course was the riceflake crusted petrale sole - very well cooked...soft, steamy and juicy....and the crunchiness from the crust was a good call.  the sauce was also a great touch - the carrot and ginger emulsion really brought out the buttery and soft texture of the fish.  My friends once again opted for something different - the skirt steak was good - juicy and tender, the duck looked great (I just wouldn't eat it because i don't eat birds)...My sole was surprisingly paired with a rieseling and i almost thought it was a glass of nice sparkly gewurztraminer...was a pleasant surprise.\n\nOk - the dessert, I had the dulche de leche bread pudding with the rum sace and pecans...out of this world.  It wasn't soggy and chunky as other bread puddings i've had.  it was crusty, soft and gooey.  Yum.  I almost had a bite of my friend's grand-marnier chocolate souffle cake but oh well.  Ha.\n\nJust on a side note, my dinner which was part of the dine about town...was $35...and the wine pairing...$11...!!!  Yes $11 - how can you beat that in SF?\n\nConclusion:  This was a great experience - I'd definitely return here for more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-10", "description": "Came here tonight with a friend for the Dine About Town.  After reading all the reviews, I was a little skeptical about how good this place will actually be... but I think overall, this place is really good.  The restaurant itself is classy and upscale.  The restaurant was packed with the working crowd (...meaning they have $$$)... but as a young 25yr old... I was still welcomed by the hostess and waiter.  The restaurant had a nice feel to it--not too upscale where I had to worry about my etiquette, but also not too casual where I could burp loudly and it go unnoticed.\n\nThe food, in my opinion, was really good.  First of all, DAT is $34.95, and wine pairing with it is $48.  That's $13 for wine pairing... quite a deal.  They are pretty generous in their pourings.  The wine came with the starter and the main entree, but no dessert wine.  It was still a deal though.  \n\nMy friend got: caesar salad, halibut cheeks, and chocolate toffee almond crunch cake.\n\nI got the asparagus soup, skirt steak, and nectarine tart.\n\nFirst, the assistant waiter come to our table and hands us a dish with 2 mini spoons with a wasabi tuna complimentary of the chef.  It was a nice surprise, and tasted really good.  The tuna was cooked perfectly on the outside and inside, it was fresh, and tasted really good with the wasabi fish eggs.  According to my friend, the caesar salad was \"damn good\".  He mentioned that the dressing was different than any other caesar salad he's ever tasted and came with lots of cheese.  Now I wish I had tried a piece...=P  The asparagus soup was...the greenest soup I have every had.... but also really good!!  First, the waiter brings out a dish with just the slightly cooked egg with the yolk intact with bacon, and then pours the asparagus soup into the bowl. Impressive.  The waiter said that the \"chef recommends for you to break the yolk and then mix it in with the soup for better taste\"... good advice!  It was delicious, and went VERY well with the wine! (A Pinot grigio).\n\nOur entrees came out rather quickly after we were done with our appetizers.  The steak was cooked medium rare, but more on the rare side.  It was nice and tender, however was a little too rare for me... my jaw started getting really tired after a while!  The red wine reduction that came with the steak was a very nice added touch!  It went really well with the steak!!  The halibut was cooked to a perfect tenderness.  I only had a small piece, but it was delicious.  I didn't have much sauce, so I can't comment on it... but it was good from what I tasted!  We had Pinot Noir to pair with our meal... which also went very well with the steak and fish!\n\nFor dessert, we got the nectarine tart and the chocolate toffee almond crunch cake.  The CTACC (for short) WAS FREAKIN DELICIOUS!!  I'm not a big fan of chocolate, but this was DAMN GOOD.  It is a 2 layered chocolate cake with chocolate mousse in the middle, all rolled in almonds and toffee bits.  The toffee bits were huge chunks, so you definitely tasted it.  The mousse was so creamy and rich.... YUMM.  The nectarine tart was also very tasty.  It came with blackberries on top.  The tart itself was flaky, and didn't have a strong fruit sour flavor... which was good.  I think i prefer the CTACC.  I liked how you got to choose b etween 5 different desserts.  They all sounded very good.  \n\nOverall, service was great, ambience was great, and food was great.  I think this place is definitely worth going to for DAT... otherwise I'll come here when I'm rich... which is like 30yrs from now =P", "author": "Diane L."}

I don't think the quality and taste justifies the prices but each time I read the menu, I can't help thinking the next time will be better than the last. \n\nIn the spirit of trying to become a pescetarian (seafood + veggies), I ordered the Mahi Mahi. The waiter, who was very knowledgeable and pleasant to look at, made sure to emphasize how great it was! For an appetizer, I ordered the pear salad. \n\nThe pear salad was excellent. Be prepared for a frou-frou salad - a very small salad with a few greens, a couple slivers of pear and some candied walnuts. Overall, the taste was very complimentary. The goat cheese was a very nice touch with the sweet pears. I recommend the dish if you feel like spending over $10 for a small salad. \n\nThe Mahi Mahi main course was good. My biggest problem with the dish was that it was swimming in a sea of oil.. no joke! The fish was overcooked for my liking but I should have asked if it came raw or cooked before I ordered the dish. It was a heavier meal than I would have liked but once I got past the fact that I was coating my stomach in oil, I began to enjoy the dish. \n\nThe meal was capped off with a pleasant cup of cappuccino to waken me from my food coma. Overall, good meal but not great.", "author": "Lan H."}

I was never a huge fan of the food.  I think it might have been the overemphasis on red meats, combined with kind of small portions.  Not really sure - it just wasn't a place I was all that thrilled about going to.  But -  the service was always friendly, efficient and professional.  I remember that much.  \n\nThe last couple of times I have been to One Market, the menu has been very different.  I am not sure when that happened, but I really do like the new menu, and always have trouble deciding what I want because everything looks so damn good.  But as the menu has improved, and Michelin showed up with its little star, the service has gotten worse.  \n\nToday, a few of us went for an early lunch without a reservation.  \n\"Feel free to take any available table in the bar.\"\n\"Nothing available in the main dining room?\" I asked.\n[Smile-less eye-lock for at least 3 seconds]\n\"Of course not,\" she replied\n\nOf course not?  What?\nMay I suggest, \"I am so sorry, we've been very busy lately.  Perhaps next time.\"  \n\nYou know who you are, long dark-haired hostess.  Perhaps you'd prefer a job taking tolls on the bay bridge?  You certainly aren't cut out to be dealing with the public in a supposedly high-end restaurant. \n\nSo we sat in the bar in plain view of Bitchy McBitcherson, and I periodically looked up to see if I could catch her in a smiley, friendly moment. No way.  That stick was firmly implanted up her ass.  \n\nThe server in the bar was friendly enough, but couldn't describe any of the entrees without actually looking over at one of our menus, and then she would just read the menu to us.  It was kind of humorous.   The food was pretty good, as usual, although today my otherwise excellent crab chowder was served luke warm.  \n\nOne Market is just not doing it for me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-06-21", "description": "Came here in lieu of Dine About Town. I was very excited about it because I have heard wonderful things about this place from friends and coworkers.\n\nWe showed up to the restaurant and were seated immediately. Our server greeted us and started off with drinks. When he came back he began to go through some of the popular items on the menu. That server talked FOREVER! We all thought he was going to go through the entire menu. Five minutes later.... we had an idea of what we were going to do.\n\nThe nice thing about this place was that in addition to their \"Dine About Town Menu\" they had a deluxe \"Dine About Town Menu\" for a few buck more (like 5-10 bucks). It definitely gave us more options to look at with their features.  In our party of four, 1 choose the standard menu (me), 2 choose the deluxe, and one went for the special of the evening, Prime Rib. I went with the standard because they had skirt steak on it and well, it sounded really good. \n\nFor the first course, I had the asparagus soup. It was excellent! A lot of flavor and the poached egg was interesting featured and added another element to the soup. Another perk was they prepare it table side for you, which was really cool. Following the soup, I had the skirt steak. The meat was perfectly cooked to my liking as well as it being full of flavor.  For desert, I had the Strawberry \"Panzanella,\" which again was really delicious. In addition to my food being excellent, the other members in my group were happy with their meals as well. \n\nOne option that we had with the food was for the first two courses to be paired with a wine. I choose to go with this route and I am glad I did. For the food I had, the wine accented the food perfectly. I say this because the two people in my group that got the deluxe meal had the same wine paired with different food and one of them mentioned that it didn't compliment the food as well as it could. By the end, I was very full and satisfied. This was definitely one of the better meals I have had in my life.", "author": "Diana R."}

And when these needs collide, I head to One Market.  Like today, for example.  And if I can arrange to meet a certain blond internal controls division manager here, why so much the better!  Particularly if she promises not to wear her t-shirt that says \"I'm in Control\" on the front.  I see enough of that in the bedroom.\n\nGood Manhattan in the bar.  Not too sweet, not overdone, classic, simple, and sophisticated.  Like the people who drink it.  Also: when they say roasted nuts, they are NOT kidding.  Some were too hot to eat.  Also, while $6 may seem steep, it's damn near a pound of nuts.  I was thinking about getting a doggy bag.  But between the martini, the Manhattan, and the Crown & Coke (in that order---notice the subtly decreasing quality [and cost] of the drinks), I wasn't really all that concerned with...much by the time I left the bar, wandered over to the hostess stand, and said \"we're your problem now.\"  Hey, at least I'm honest.\n\nGloria Ferrer champagne before dinner?  Sure.  Roasted gulf shrimp?  Why not.  Fried green tomatoes for wifey?  Absolutely, just don't ask me to have any.  Duck for B2P?  Pretty predictable, but the duck WAS delicious, and came with both white meat and dark meat cuts.  Veal chop for wifey?  Also predictable, but no less delectable.  Like the girl herself.  Glass of barbera went well with dinner and made sure I didn't sober up.  Dessert was some berry and cookie and whipped fluff thing, which was amazing, and plenty big enough to share.\n\nSo, departing One Market, and looking back on my first year of Yelp, I am reminded of the words of Big Audio Dynamite: \"If I had my time again, I would do it all the same, and not change a single thing, even when I was to blame.\"  Bring on year 2!", "author": "Ben P."}

The Soy Flan was kinda weird, but the poached quail egg was tres cute! :) \n\nSeared Bay Scallops atop Mashed Potatoes  - Three big scallops on top of mashed potatoes; meaty and tasty, but the potatoes were thin and non impressive.\n\nDuck Two Ways - This was pretty ok from the SMALL piece I tried; braised duck breast atop a duck-loaf :) \n\nChocolate Beignets with White CHocolate hot cocoa - looked good enough but kinda small compared to the other dessert \n\nVanilla Bean Ice Cream atop Flaky Pastry - Yeah you stupid waiter, I call it the ice cream thing, so sue me!

The dessert huge - even bigger than my entree, not enough ice cream, but a REALLY TOO sweet sauce and non-ripe blueberries, and a huge square of flaky pastry.  It was too sour and too sweet at the same time.... ew. \n\nIt was just.... LACKING.  I wasn't impressed to say the least!\n\nSo, you pretty much know what I think about this restaurant.

The Sauteed Spinach was amazingly fresh, and the Sunchokes screamed of simple, unembellished mushy goodness.\n\nI also really enjoyed the seasonal Fuyu Persimmon Salad, with Candied Pistachios and wilted Savoy Spinach topped with a huge fluffy heap of Ricotta Salata tendrils.  Taken altogether in one bite, a delightful and savory medley of flavors.\n\nFor dessert, we chose the Platter of 3 of their Mini Desserts, picking Pumpkin Cheesecake, Chocolate Toffee Almond Crunch Cake and Butterscotch Pudding with Chantilly Cream.  My favorite was the Pumpkin Cheesecake.  (Nice side note, One Market also offers a decorate-your-own frosted Gingerbread Man cookie with sprinkle and gumdrop toppings, proceeds of the dessert from all Bay Area Lark Creek restaurants to go to Bay Area Make A Wish foundations.)\n\nWhat I liked, strike that, LOVED, about One Market was their varied and plentiful use of seasonal Fruits & Veggies with touches of Middle Eastern / Mediterranean flavorings like Harissa and Saffron.  I was less impressed by the Saffron Soup with Mussels,  Pistou and Yukon Gold Potatoes. OK taste but the texture and visuals were offputting, read: floating pockets of oil.  \n\nPeg S., per usual, appropriately captured the decor as \"nonconfrontational.\"   And if you feel your soul suffocate every time you step foot in the FiDi, may I suggest a proverbial inhaler of Kick-Ass Soul-Replenishing Friends to accompany you?

I just went for Dine About Town lunch and I am really underwhelmed. Glad I didn't pay for an a la carte meal here.\n\nStarter: Farmer's salad. Supposedly comes with seasonal vegetables. Mine had a few paper thin slices of radish and fennel and some crumbles of something that may have resembled romnaesque broccoli if the pieces had been large enough to identify the vegetable.\n\nEntree: Farro \"risotto\" with roasted winter squash. Way, way too salty. Also, if you're going to have the cohones to create a risotto out of anything other than arborio rice, you better have the skill to make it creamy and starchy like risotto. Dumping melted butter onto it does not make it seem more risotto-like. I did think the farro had good texture as farro. And the raisins and currants were a nice touch.\n\nDessert: Pear galette. The pastry had the consistency and flavor of toaster strudel. You shouldn't need a knife to cut your pastry. I would rather have just had the poached pear and vanilla ice cream.  \n\nAnd the kicker: they tacked on an 18% gratuity for a party of two! WTF? I mean, I know I am taking advantage of a lower cost deal, and I am not wearing an Armani suit, but I am not exactly crawling out my trailer and dusting off my overalls and hoping they have squirrel on the menu.

We were supposed to meet at 11:00 and I showed up a bit early (as is my normal procedure) and was on the phone when 11:00 came around.    One of the staff poked there head out and said they did not open until 11:30, but would I like to come inside to wait (+1 star for paying attention and showing a kindness to strangers - I could have said weary travelers there but that really would have been over the top).  \n\nThe person I was meeting showed up at about 11:05 and he to was invited into the establishment and we were sitting in the bar area chatting before they were set up for lunch.  Unfortunately, I had to leave at about 12:10 to get to another meeting, so I ended up not getting anything to eat, but my friend ordered lunch and we both had some iced tea, so we were able to leave a generous tip for their kindness in accommodating us and now I want to go back and spend money because I really enjoy great service and the experience, sans food, was excellent.\n\nOne Market has always been and is now staffed by good people.", "author": "Jonathan D."}

And as a couple, you can try all six offerings on the menu, which is spectacular!  The sunchoke soup is divine (I love sunchoke!)

The bar is sometimes a little too crowded after work, but when you get it on a perfect night it is serene.\n\nYou know the chef is top notch when they allow an open exhibition of the kitchen from the dinning hall. Last time I made a visit to One Market I enjoyed one of my favorite meals. I started out by sharing a Dungeness Crab Salad with heirloom apples and celery root with celery sorbet with my boyfriend. My main course was the Alaskan Halibut in applewood-smoked bacon, yukon gold potatoes, fennel, and sweet corn. My meal went perfectly with my favorite glass of Pinot Grigio from Napa Valley. Oooh and to top it off we had dessert... I'll admit I only had a couple nibbles. But my BF cant end a meal without a little chocolate... fine! and neither can I.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-07-03", "description": "My husband and I decided to go out for a date night on a busy holiday weekend. After years of overlooking One Market, we decided to give it a try when we quickly discovered they had a table at the time we wanted. This should have been our first indication that the formerly-great restaurant may have lost some of its luster.\n\nThe host was friendly, but not overly welcoming. Despite the reservation, our table was not ready and we waited in the bar area until the host retrieved us. I had asked for a quiet table in the corner, yet we were seated in the middle of the room (not really a big deal). Also, no one offered to take my coat, so I draped it over my chair on my own. The menus were placed in front of us without much fanfare and it did take several minutes before anyone else visited our table.\n\nOur server may have had too many tables, but there were several service missteps throughout the evening. Despite being reminded that I am a vegetarian (this was also indicated in the reservation and I casually mentioned it to her when she brought the menus and I was seeking guidance), the amuse bouche was not vegetarian. When I asked for recommendations, she mentioned non-vegetarian items and was less than helpful when I had questions. She did not go out of her way to share ideas or make us feel special. In fact, she completely forgot my husband's wine pairing and my glass of wine until we finally were able to get her attention in the middle of our main courses. Instead of apologizing or going out of her way, she brought us both the same exact glass of wine and charged us the full price, despite the discount my husband's wine three-course pairing should have had (she completely missed the pairing with the first course and did not offer anything to pair with dessert). By now, we were beyond frustrated and feeling like we had to work extra hard to get what we had originally ordered.\n\nOur dishes were good, but not memorable. My gnocchi was drowned in a heavy foam (very 1980s) and the pasta was lukewarm - not hot. My husband's halibut was slightly overcooked, but that may have been because he waited too long to start when he did not have his wine to drink with the meal. I finally implored him to start eating. He claimed that the flavor combination with the fish was a bit off and the vegetables that came with his fish were also overcooked. We did enjoy the side of roasted artichokes with lemon - that may have been the best part of the main course.\n\nFor dessert, my husband ordered the blueberry cheesecake and I ordered the chocolate pudding with caramel and sea salt. Both of us truly enjoyed the desserts, but the almond crumble that topped mine was a bit heavy-handed and dense. We resisted pairing any beverages with this course, as we were still smarting from getting our wine so late in the main course and had plenty left to go with our desserts. The spoon that was presented to me for the dessert course was much too large for the small glass vessel that contained my pudding, but I didn't want to wait another 20 minutes to play hide and seek with our server. I managed to make it work and was able to get to most of the pudding out of the glass.\n\nThe location and views of this San Francisco mainstay make it desirable, but I would hesitate to return anytime soon. I might return for the piano and bar scene, but not for a meal in the dining room.", "author": "Rachel P."}

You can check out amazing views across the street and do some shopping in the Ferry Building, and you can easily access the Embarcadero BART station, which is a huge plus. \n\nWe walked in on a weeknight during the dinner rush, and our wait was less than five minutes.

We arrived Saturday at 8pm and the restaurant was full of diners.   We were waiting for one of our friends, so we decided to grab a drink at the bar first.  The drinks were pretty standard in terms of cost and taste.  \n\nI would say that most of the diners were probably around their 40s and up.  The atmosphere wasn't overly stuffy which was nice, we could still talk/laugh without feeling like we were creating too much commotion.  When we were seated our waitress asked if we were celebrating something.  We told her it was our friend's 30th bday, so I was sure there would be a nice dessert given to her after our meal.   The waitress was very nice and patient considering we had multiple questions regarding the menu.\n\nWe ordered the following:\n\nBradley's Caesar Salad ($9.75)- The caesar was pretty standard with an average-sized portion.  I didn't feel like it was worth $10 though.\n\nHen special (not sure price)- It looked delicious and tender.  Some of my friends liked it.  When I tasted it, it was TOO moist.  Is that possible you ask?  Yes.  There was no texture and it was basically...wet meat.  Gross.   \n\nPotato-crusted Petrale Sole ($26.50)- The fish was just okay to me.  The artichoke barigoule and basil broth were very unappealing to me.  It didn't complement the fish at all.\n\nRoasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast ($29.50)- I didn't try this dish but my friend said it was good.\n\nBacon-wrapped Pork Tenderloin ($26.75)- Pork wrapped in bacon.  Do I even need to say more?   Haha.  Well, in my opinion, it was the best dish that was ordered.\n\nSides ($7.75 each):\nOverview- the portions are TINY and not worth the price.  For $7.75, I expect the portion to be big and darn tasty.  I could get a delicious bacon cheeseburger w fries at Slider's in SJ for that price!!!  \n\nGrilled Asparagus-  wow, totally....overcooked.  Limp with no flavor. Disappointing.  \nSauteed Spinach- Spinach w garlic.  Nothing outstanding.\nButtery Mashed Potatoes-  My friend described this perfectly, saying they tasted exactly like those instant boxed Potato Buds.  Yep.  Potato buds with a cup of butter.\n\nAfter our meal we were given dessert menus.  Everyone was stuffed so I just whispered to the waitress, \"Does she get a birthday dessert?\"  She replied with, \"I don't understand.\"  Hmm...  So my friend repeats my question and then the waitress finally says no, they don't offer that.\n\nUhh...what?  That's lame in my opinion.  Lame enough for me to subtract a star.\n\nOn their website, they show that they have a 1 star rating according to the Michelin guide.  I had no idea this guide existed, so I decided to check it out online.  Their rating system: 1 star- very good restaurant, 2 star- excellent cooking, 3 star- exceptional cooking.  Apparently this guide is well-known in Europe.  I thought Michelin made tires?  I'm confused.  They even have the same marshmallow looking dude on the guide.  Here's some info if you are interested:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelin_Guide\n\nI took a look at what else is in their SF 1 star category.  Wow.  Gary Danko?!  Chez Panisse?!   One Market is NOT is the same category of these great restaurants at ALL.  They list Aqua and Michael Mina in the 2 stars.  They have only one restaurant with 3 stars...French Laundry.

One Market did not succeed at this task. \n\nHad a family dinner here last Friday night.  They were especially accomodating last minute which was nice, however, the evening started off with things, well, a bit off.  We ordered a bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay, which at the marked up prices is a bit of a crazy decision.  The wine arrived at the table luke warm, which was terribly dissapointing.  This wine, which is overly robust, really needs to be served pretty cold.  We sent it away for a wine bath, which the waiter confused for a wine bucket....one Michelin star eh? \n\nMy Dad and I both ordered the Dungenous Crab salad, which at $15 a pop was sure to be good.  First bite, the crab claw on top.  Disgusting.  Seriously, did you guys leave the meat out on the counter since lunch?  Was the crab green when you cracked it?  It tasted like BAD CRAB, which is simply disgusting if you've ever had it.  The smell alone should have keyed in the chef that the crab was bad...then, at least 3 or 4 crab shells were in my crab mixture under the polenta (which was quite good). Soooo, bad bad start.  My Dad's top piece of crab was also very gross.  This is just no acceptable at a restaurant with as high of accolades as this place. \n\nWe moved onto our mains, I had the New York Strip and a side of summer squash.  Both were quite good.  The highlight for the table was the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon, both parties that ate this were very happy.  My Mom had the nightly special, lamb.  It was to be thinly sliced and plated.  It was a pile of meat that was stringy, tough and the opposite of what lamb should be. Another failure. \n\nAll in all this dining experience was fine.  It wasn't BAD but it wasn't great either.  Our waiter seemed a little incompentent and we did have to resort to flagging him down a couple of times...again, not the type of service you expect at a restaurant with a Michelin star and one that continues to be on Michael Bauer's Top 100.

It's a great location with lots of windows to let the sun shine though and a good view of the Port of San Fran. \n\nThe service was great and the food was fantastic! I took the 'business lunch' that included a salad and trout served with a delicious shallot sauce. The fish was incredibly flakey and perfect. My friend had the ahi tuna burger which was yummy as well. The tuna was cooked perfectly as well, sealing my opinion that they know how to cook their seafood. My dish came with a side of whipped potatoes and spinach; my friend's dish came with nice potatoes that had a good crunchy crust. \n\nBasically everything was delicious, right down to the post-lunch coffee. The price is moderate to high, but worth the trip.", "author": "Jenn S."}

Extra star for Dora, the cocktail waitress, who always remembers me by name.  It's not her fault that during busy Friday happy hours the drinks take 20 minutes to make it to our table; the restaurant is no-place-to-sit-packed on they under-staff for the occasion.\n\nThe place gets zero extra stars for the food.  I don't even eat in their dining room because it's so not worth it (I do have SOME say when it comes to my co-workers!)  The bar menu once upon a time had one thing on it worth ordering - the popcorn shrimp.  They pulled that from the menu and despite my formal request to management for its return, they have stuck with the sliders instead.  I order the oysters just to have something to eat, but usually run through three dozen before the after-work hunger pangs start to subside.\n\nThe place stays popular year after year, so what am I missing when it comes to the food?  Well, the the crowd is lots of yuppie types who come in for power lunches and/or after work so I can only speculate that maybe this place is popular for people who have relocated to SF for work.  Like someone from the North Carolina asks their Mid-Western colleague where to go after work for good food and drinks and One Market is all they know.  But, the crowd is always friendly and sociable during happy hour.\n  \nBe careful of the bill.  Between bar menu and drinks for four to five people, I am always surprised how the bill can get over $200 in only a couple of hours.\n\nhttp://www.dph.sf.ca.us/eh/Violations/Loc_CurrentViol.asp?LocationID=3082", "author": "Ann W."}

We had everything on the menu except the Mushroom Pot Pie.  The wine paring option is a deal - considering that the glass of wine ranged from $8.50-12.  The wine paring was an extra $13 to the Dine About Town menu.

They sat us in a very strange location - my husband's back was to a window and he was right next to a large plant. They put a chair in front of a banquette,  turned the table, and I was perpendicular to him. Why couldn't they just seat us at a two top where we could face each other?\n\n2. Appetizers included octopus, and then the caesar salad. Salad was fine, but not memorable. Octopus had a very strange flavor-- tasted smoked, which was interesting, and then it was served with a soy reduction, which helped the flavor but definitely didn't dazzle me. My husband spent time in Japan and said it reminded him of a street food dish that he loved, so I'm glad he liked it.\n\n3. Scallops and sweetbreads entree was good, but again, not memorable. I had heard that sweetbreads were delicious when done perfectly. These were battered and deep fried-- a preparation I rarely turn away-- but that didn't seem to do them justice. The texture was a little spongey and tough inside the crispy exterior. Scallops were perfectly caramelized and soft in the middle. Hubbie had lamb shank and he loved it. I helped him eat the bone marrow and that made up for the mediocre apps. \n\n4. Chocolate Souffle- very very good. The ice cream that was paired with it was good, but not outstanding (my favorite is the salt caramel ice cream at Perbacco, so that is always tough to beat)... but the souffle itself was very good. \n\nService was good- we had a nice server. \n\nFor $180 including a glass of champagne and wine each, I would have expected better food.

I have received a number of love letter \"compliments\" from a variety of you. Yes, quite similar to the love letters I received from prior lovers.

The theme of our meal for the evening  was \"all things shrinkwrapped with bacon.\"   I knew I was going to like this place!\n\nFor starters my dining companion and I both opted for sunchoke veloute over the casaer salad.  The veloute was unusual, but I like the combination of the mild creamy (which wasn't cream at all but a broth thickened by flour) soup and the walnuts and bacon crisps.  I've never had sunchoke before (the waiter described it as being leek-y) and leek-y it was!    \n\nMy friend ordered the pork tenderloin wrapped in bacon on a bed of blanched  spinach, and I opted the scallops again wrapped in bacon on bed of thinly sliced fingerling potatoes.  I was surprised (as well as bit disappointed) how large his portions were and how small mine.  He got 3 huge rounds of porktenderloins  and I got 3 scallops.  Me thinks I got the short end of the stick, Shmee.  They were both absolutely delicious -- sweet, moist and succulent.     \n\nFor desert we decided to split the two offerings of pear tart with a blueberry sauce and ice cream and the chocolate souffle also served with ice cream and a lovely dollop of freshly whipped cream.  I wasn't too impressed with the tart but my friend absolutely loved it.  Me, it was all about the souffle, warm gooey chocolatey-ness.  HEAVEN!\n\nAgain, atmosphere was a bit off since the whole place seemed to be filled with an older crowd - think white men in their 50s with dark suits and ties and the ladies dining club with pearl necklaces and such.  Nice but not really my scene.  I could imagine taking older clients here if I was a banker or something.

This is how bad this place was that I had to complain about it.\n\nThe restaurant ambiance is nice, but it pretty much ends there. I'll try to keep this short.\n\nBread: Hard and chewy...totally didn't expect this.\n\nComplimentary app: Tuna with ginger foam\n\nMade me want to spit it out...not a great start.  Over salted and you couldn't even taste the tuna.  It was like eating a tablespoon of salt and ginger.\n\nApps: Trout, Crab, foie gras\nOut of these 3 the foie gras was actually the only think I liked from this place.  The trout had a distinct fishy after taste which made me wonder how fresh it was, the crab was frozen which you can taste.  You're in SF during crab season and your serving frozen crab? I've had better crab at local restaurants that are hole in the walls.\n\nEntree: Lobster\n\nNow for a place that is suppose to be this highly rated with 5 star reviews from other yelpers confuses me. The lobster was over cooked and chewy.  It was so bad that I had trouble cutting through it with a knife. I've been to some crappy restaurants before that served lobster better than this place. \n\nSides: Mashed potatoes, and garlic spinach\n\nBoth horrible. The mash tasted like it was instant and was bland.  There was maybe a hint of butter, but everyone agreed this was the worst mash they ever had.  The spinach was bland as well and the slices of roasted garlic wasn't cooked long enough so they were chewy instead of being crunchy.  I definitely do not recommend any of these sides.  \n\nDessert: Duo of creme brulee\n\nAt least this was a pleasant surprise, although a bit on the thick side it tasted ok. \n\nService: The wait staff seemed a bit incompetent. They were attentive, but didn't remember who ordered what and kept placing the food in front of the wrong person.  The waitress also had to keep referring to who ordered what when placing silverware down for our entrees.

This place feels stuffy to me, and this was during two business meals with my overly stuffy corporate office. We should have fit right in. Instead, the service was unimpressive and the staff made little effort to treat our corporate posse like something special (of course, we weren't anything special, but that's not the point).  On one occasion, they struggled to accommodate our large party, despite the fact we'd made a reservation well in advance, and on another, our waiter seemed so hyper I thought I might choke him.\n\nThis is a great place if you are going out to lunch with your ultra conservative parents or want to show a really pretentious and boring date a really pretentious and boring time.  The menu is conservative and fairly well-executed, and the space feels, well, rich and slightly bland.

I would recommend starting with the smoked trout which is one of their signature dishes. For the main entree go with the bacon wrapped pork tenderloins which will make you come back for more. The NY steak with a side order of sauted spinach is very good as well. I would recommend ordering 4 or 5 desserts and sharing amongst others at the table. All the desserts were fabulous.

I've tried to come here for lunch last year but reservations were needed.  Reservations were made by a colleague, but not really needed on a Thursday night. 3 stars is really more like 3.5 stars, I'm not a fan, but its a nice place to take a date or meet friends at. I wouldn't say I'll be a regular to this place.\n\nHappy Hour - 4 stars\nIts seems like a great place to grab a drink before you head home from working in the city.  The Ferry Building and Bart are close by, like a block.  The prices are cheap. There's a lot of young hip crowd. \n\nDinner - 3.5 stars\nNot sure if its a normal thing, but the chef made an amuse bush of duck pate, it was a wonderful and delicate bite of food.  Then again I'm a big fan of anything duck based. I got the duck breast cooked duck confit. It was cooked perfectly, but the fig paste thing that was to compliment the duck was over powering and wasn't appetizing.  \n\nService - 5 stars\nThe service staff are very accommodating and attentive.  My water was filled promptly and very courteous. Something I'd expect, if I was paying that much for dinner. \n\nAmbiance - 4\nThere's a rustic feel and a great place to have dinner.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-02-25", "description": "See profile site for full review with formatted pics.\n\nIt is a holiday Monday in San Francisco; you had Tartine for breakfast and were blown away, you had Boulevard for lunch and were very impressed - you want to keep with the great yet classic concept but your companions don't want \"prix fixe\" or a tasting menu.  You've wandered the wharf, Ghirardelli square, and even Coit tower and no find yourself in the financial district around 8:30pm.  Browsing the Michelin Guide you spot One Market and realize they're one of the few starred restaurants participating in Crab-Week - You love crab and rarely get anything fresh in Ohio - Sold.\n\nEntering One Market around 8:30pm after securing free parking one immediately notes the large Michelin Star perched on the hostess station and next notices the boisterous bar on the right, beautiful restaurant on the left, open kitchen in the back, and large windows peering out onto the Embarcadero.  No reservations are no problem, jeans and a leather blazer not too upscale or too casual, a table by the window?  Sure.\n\nSeating was prompt, wine offered and declined, water filled and menus delivered - our waiter Nelsen was much older than the other servers we met on our trip and while somewhat fuddling in his dish descriptions also had a level of respect and attentiveness to detail that was a nice change from the aloof approach at Boulevard that was later also experienced at Aqua, Bazaar, Osteria Mozza, and Chez Panisse Caf\u00e9.  After approximately 10 minutes Nelsen returned with a plate of sourdough rolls and took our orders.  The rolls were fair, but the icy cold butter was unimpressive at best.  Shortly after the bread arrived, a group of well dressed businessmen were seated close to our table and another server, similar in age to Nelsen, appeared to take care of their table.  Upon looking around, it appeared all the staff was more experienced and that each table had its own server - I'm unsure whether this speaks to the economy or just a style choice for the restaurant, but it was interesting to have such individualized service.\n\nFive minutes after the orders were taken, a young lady emerged from the kitchen with an amuse bouche of seared toro and tomato compote with microbasil that more than made up for the butter, however.  Having never tasted toro before, my aunt was particularly impressed by this dish and I will note that the texture of the fish was every bit as good as any toro I've tried while the tomatoes were quite fresh and zesty.  Shortly after the amuse, our appetizers began to arrive.  Like many other meals, I personally opted for multiple appetizers in order to maximize taste experience without any masticatory boredom.\n\nFor myself, course one consisted of the Grilled Octopus with kabocha squash, asian pear, tamarind, pumpkin seeds.  A fan of Grilled Octopus, this version was remarkable in that it did not use a heavy handed citrus component like Babbo or Spiaggia, but instead focused on contrasting textures and highlighting the brininess of the Octopi.  Perfectly seared and succulent, the crunch of the seeds alongside the delicate squash was a great experience and certainly something I'll try to recreate in the future.  One of the best octopus dishes yet to grace my palate.\n\nDish one for my mother was the Dungeness Crab & Coconut Milk Soup with leeks, carrots, fennel, kaffir lime.  Beautifully plated tableside I can honestly say this dish was a huge miss for me.  While my mother liked it and was glad she ordered it, there was an undefined spice to the dish similar to a curry that refluxed on me throughout the night and left me with significant heart burn on my morning run the next day that actually required the purchase of TUMS.  My mom did not experience this, thankfully, but for me this dish left sour memories of the meal as a whole.\n\nMy next dish, another appetizer, was the Pan-seared Artisan Foie Gras with golden raisin puree and hazelnut crackle.  Having had multiple presentations of Foie in the past, at the time I consumed this dish it was the single best Foie Gras I had ever tasted and is still my favorite all time seared preparation (the cold terrines at TFL and Aqua were more \"my style.\")  Perfectly seared and large in portion, no veins and plenty of texture, the sweet raisin and candied hazelnut/apricot compote for texture - amazing and a must have dish.", "author": "Michael U."}

I took 8 teenagers there for a celebratory dinner and was impressed with seating (a round table for 9 of us was lovely) and the service.  A patient and gracious server treated us like royalty and did not seem chagrined by the inexperience of the diners or our lack of ordering alcohol.  The food was very good though I am not sure it rates a Michelin star, hence my 4-star rating. I would go back in the right circumstances, but I don't consider it particularly innovative and exciting for the price.

We were running a little late, but the reservationist was very understanding.  We actually found street parking on Stuart, too (Friday night), though there's a garage available for the building.\n\nI love the large open windows with the view of the bridge, ferry building, and bay.  The bread is warm and crusty and one of the best I've had in a while.  The amuse bouche of duck liver was way too organ-tasting for me, unfortunately.\n\nMy boyfriend got the deluxe dine about town menu with wine pairings (additional $15), which was a good deal.  The interesting white blend is usually $13 per glass, and the pinot noir is in the $10-12 range, too.  The pinot noir was very smooth, and the pours were very generous.  \n\nHe started with the asparagus soup with an organic poached egg.  The soup itself, poured tableside, was very green and tasted very pure and clean, but the egg, parmesan, and pancetta added much more dimension to it, enhancing the flavors a lot.  He then had the duck breast with duck confit, which is the least gamey tasting duck I've ever had.  The duck itself was cooked perfectly tender and not too fatty.  For once, it was not combined with a cherry sauce like most places do - instead, it was paired with a coffee flavored puree and huckleberries, which I enjoyed a lot. It was refreshing to have a novel preparation of the duck. \n\nI started with the beet carpaccio, which was a gorgeous deep red color, looking almost like a beef carpaccio.  It came with a tangy vinaigrette but wasn't overdressed, and there was mild goat cheese scattered with some micro greens, corn flakes, and thinly sliced radish.  This is one of the most innovative beet dishes I've had, and it's up there among my favorites, along with the beet layer cake from Spago.\n\nI went with another appetizer for my main - the crab salad.  The crab meat was very generous, with claw meet scattered with grapefruit segments around the plate and also a mound of shredded meat in the center underneath a cooling olive oil sorbet.  The sorbet was a nice, smooth, temperature contrast, but it didn't taste much like olive oil.  The crab was fresh and sweet and not masked by the gelatin like dressing that it sat in.  It was a pretty cool preparation, once again.. not the typical crab salad in a martini glass.\n\nFor dessert, we had the valrhona chocolate souffle cake, which was light, very chocolatey, and not overly sweet.  The whipped mascarpone on top was light, and the milk chocolate ice cream was smooth.  I'm not a big fan of raspberries with chocolate, but the raspberry wasn't overdone.  It was perfect paired with strong coffee.\n\nService wasn't bad, except when they forget to tell us which wine we received with the 1st course.  It was a busy night, but dishes came out and were cleared at a good pace.  One thing that I really appreciated about the service was that the waiter made sure I knew the 18% gratuity had already been included, which I've never had anyone else do.  \n\nI love the younger crowd, the more casual yet classy ambiance, the unpretentiousness, and the innovative takes on more traditional dishes.

Our group of eight got out for $260, including gratuity, two glasses of wine, a few lemonades, and two french fry appetizer plates.\n\nI had no idea about the lemonade.  I'm not one to get excited about lemonade.  But this was some tasty lemonade, even on a gloomy, rainy Friday.  I got the mint lemonade, which appears to have a mint infused simple syrup on the bottom.  Served over crushed ice (is there any better ice?), this was a very nice surprise.\n\nYou MUST try the chickpea fries.  And I'm not one to brag about chickpeas.\n\nI went with the portobello mushroom soup, the tri-tip, and the chocolate pot de creme.  I experienced my first soy flan and quail egg with my soup.  I thought the flan added a nice texture.  The tri-tip was a tiny bit on the dry side, but tender nonetheless.  The side of mashed potatoes and chard was a pleasant surprise.  And the dessert . . . I'm still high on the dessert.  I thought it hit the right balance of sweet, but not overly rich.\n\nAll in all this was a five-star experience in my book.  The service was fast and attentive.  The food was several cuts above my typical lunch treats and worth every dime.", "author": "Daryl E."}

It was handy because I work in the building and it gives all the appearance of a nice restaurant with a foodie menu. The best part was that I was able to make a reservation for 2 at OpenTable.com about 20 minutes ahead of time. Some other nearby places like Boulevard won't let you make same day reservations online at the last minute. I was in a bit of a Denny's mood so I kicked it with the Petaluma Three Egg Open-Faced Omelet with Sonoma goat cheese. \r\n\r\nIt was one of the most disgusting meals I've ever had. \r\n\r\nIf it weren't for the bread at the table, I would have been SOL.

Mini desserts are just the right size to share if you are watching calories.  Soups are elegant.  Prices are good considering the quality.

Then, I checked Yelp and there were a lot of people who were dissatisfied with the place, so that got me a little wary.\n\nIn any case, our party had a pretty nice dinner here. I can understand the comments made by both sides.\n\nEveryone at the table had the 6 course tasting menu, including one vegetarian. That must earn kudos, how many places can boast a great 6 course vegetarian tasting menu? In fact, I was a little envious of all the creative vegetarian dishes landing across the table from me as I think the veggies really stand out here.\n\nThe six course tasting menu ($75/person) consisted of  the dungeness crab salad (creative use of the celery root and celery sorbet- never had that before with an appetizer), the sauteed wild gulf shrimp (cleaning the green chile vinaigrette of the plate), duck ravioli with foie gras emulsion (i think i prefer my foie gras in solid form), day scallop, and lavender rubbed lamb (really tender succulent lamb, wish I had more), and a choice of dessert.  I picked the chocolate toffee almond crunch cake (i.e., essentially a chocolate toffee bar). I tasted other people's desserts, including the vanilla and espresso creme brulee and the butterscotch pudding topped with a LOT of whipped cream (yummy!). \n\nEveryone liked the food. The atmosphere was a little more business-like and louder than I would have wanted for an intimate dinner with friends, but what do you expect from such a big restaurant?

On Friday night, two more friends tell me they'd like to tag along and, on top of that, we all might be slightly late.  I call One Market, expecting the hostess to hang up on me but, instead, she politely accommodated my requests and accepted our new party of seven and delayed arrival.\n\nTHEN, then - silly me, I get lost in SF (I know, I know - lame).

She gave me directions, made sure I got to the restaurant successfully - and even waited outside for me!!  WTF.  Bless her!!  I bet she's the kind of friend who takes care of her drunkard friends, buys food for homeless people and dedicates her life to serving and helping people.  That's one extra star on top of a wonderful evening and a wonderful meal.\n\nSpeaking of food, if any of y'all go to One Market for Dine About Town this time around, you MUST order the black bean soup, the skatewing and the butter tart.  Holy mother of God.  I've never had skatewing before but, it was AMAZING.  AMAZING.  And who knew black bean soup could be so dang delicious?!?  Dayamn.

But I was a good friend and let them pick off my plate.  :)  \n\nAgreed that the crowd is very \"Financial District' and it's not a very trendy, upscale or dressy restaurant.

While many places around these parts are into farm-to-table cuisine, I get annoyed when I spend $15 for the best pear ever as my dessert course. When I go out to eat, I want the experience to be more than competent trawling of the farmer's market. To paraphrase Mystikal, show me what you're workin' with! One Market did so. The food highlighted the ingredients in all their seasonal glory, but had enough technique and presentation to be exciting.\n\nThe other thing I really liked about it was that the menu was designed for a lot of different price-levels. You could go there and be perfectly satisfied with a relatively affordable dinner (3 course prix fixe menu with limited options, easy on the alcohol for $39/person), or you could splash out with a $79 tasting menu. Same with drinks, dessert menu, the whole bit.\n\nMy meal:\nGrilled octopus that had been sous vide first, over pureed kabocha squash with pear and tamarind sauce. The octopus was tender and tasty and the flavor and texture contrasts through the dish were great.\nThen Pan Roasted Domestic Lamb Loin w/chick peas, wild ramps, cocoa reduction. I don't know what ramps are, but the lamb was perfect.\nAlso added the farmer's market side ($6.75) of sauteed baby artichokes, which were simple and great.\nYou can do seasonal desserts for $10, which is a decent portion, or mini desserts for $5.75 each or $15 for 3 if you want tastes of awesome but conserve cost.\nWe shared the chocolate souffle cake with raspberry pinot noir compote (huzzah!) and strawberry business thing with almond brioche and ricotta cream (sha-zam!).", "author": "Nato G."}

First off, we arrived a few minutes before 7 pm on a Tuesday for a 7:15 pm reservation. We ducked into the bar to grab a happy hour drink before happy hour ended at 7. The bartender snapped that we were too late and when I said it wasn't yet seven, she got really uppity about it. \"Well it is according to my computer, so don't look at me.\" Her tone was completely out of line and off-putting as I hadn't even raised my voice to her.\n\nThey gave us a really nice table to sit at, and the server was had was very attentive and nice. I perused the wine list, tho, and my eyes nearly fell out of my head. Almost 70 bones for a bottle of Honig red? Come ON! This place is seriously lacking in the reasonable wine department, or they just cater to tourists who think good wine's gotta cost a Benjamin... so not true. So, we ordered a $110 bottle of Silver Oak (if you're gonna splurge a little, go for it, right), but were told they were out of it. So, we found a nice bottle of T-Vine at a more modest markup. \n\nThe food is where this place really excelled. Even the bread we got was amazing. Wonderfully warmed French and olive rolls. Too bad when I wanted a second olive roll, they were out of those, too. My portabello soup was delicious, and the steak I had was fantastic. Totally flavorful and cooked to perfection. My dinner companion wanted the Tuesday special, but they were out of that, too. At 7:30 pm? Did they serve them for lunch?\n\nThe trio of desserts we opted for were indeed delicious, and the server was very thoughtful in his presentation and odd (but kinda charming) insistence that I take a birthday shot. \n\nSo, the food made One Market surely did delivery on Bradley Ogden's expertise in the area of New American dining.

The shock was deafening as the halibut was brought to the table and it appeared to be the portion size fit for a 9 year old. The small size was bad enough but The taste of snapper was \"mediocre\" and so was the squash. To add salt to the wound, the price for such small portions of mediocre food was outrageous. We dine out relatively often and do not mind paying extraordinary prices for extraordinary food. We were bamboozled..lol.. The food here was simply not great. not worth the price at all.\n\nWe will NOT return to One Market again. \n\nThe good:\nambiance, location, Service was ok. and they did bring out a nice plate of dessert for the birthday man.

First the positives-happy hour is cheap and the well liqour is decent. After a couple of greyhounds we moved into the dining room. I ordered a garden salad, mahi mahi, and spinach. The salad was delicious-the dressing was just the right amount and ithe veggies were really crisp and delicious.  The mahi mahi was flavored just right, flaky and buttery, and a good side portion. The spinach was amazing, cooked with big garlic chips.\n\nFor desert we got the mini platter with the lemon cheesecake, mint choclate chip ice cream cookie, and a choclate toffee thing that tasted like a heath bar. The cheescake was delicious as was the toffee thing, however the mint choclate chip thing was overly minty and inedible.I also had a latte for desert, but they didnt have skim milk, so I had to have 2% which I don't love.\n\nThe service was great. Our server really balanced out giving my sister and I who hadn't seen each other in six months room to talk, but also offered seamless service andgood suggesstions of food and wine pairing. She didn't rush us at all.\n\nThe downside. The bathroom was quite dirty. Two of the stalls were filthy and I was pretty amazed such a swanky place had a bathroom in such array. The other downside was that the room was too dark-they went a little over board on the mood lighting.\n\nOur tab was $130. I won't pay that much for a meal, but we were on my sister's treat.

I had sometime to kill before my red eye flight back to Toronto so I decided to have dinner and some wine. \nMy first impression I must admit wasn't the greatest and that just really boiled down to the bitchy hostess.

Everything from cocktails, to starters, to main courses to dessert is always extremely good. Ambiance is nice and if you get a table near the windows it gets even better. I would recommend to always ask for the specialty of the day, it may really be worthwhile (like my thin sliced roasted beef I just had last night...to die for). I would also recommend to ask for help in wine selection, unless you are an expert you might be overwhelmed by the long list and on top of that you can be fairly sure to get a wine that matches the food you ordered.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-11", "description": "We were precariously seated next to, and too close to, the warm grill. Patrons kept bumping into us as they walked in between our and another table, so we moved the table when the staff wasn't looking. Two of us ordered the deluxe Dine About Town menus, one the regular DAT, and two ordered straight off the menu. I tried a few other things, but here's what I can remember.\n\nThe Amouse bouche was smoked paprika spiced tuna on a fried potato, and topped with micro basil: The potatoes were like a delicious gourmet \"tater tot,\" and the tuna was unbelievably good, probably the best thing I ate all evening. Despite the pretty presentation, it was a waste of good tuna-- the potatoes dominated the dish. This was best eaten unassembled. \n\nRancho Gordo Chick Pea Soup saffron, wild shrimp, ni\u00e7oise olives: The shrimp were crisp, and soup was very good overall.\nGeoduck Clam \"Chowder\" herbed cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, celery, house-cured pancetta: The soup might have been better had we been provided with an instruction manual. The base was too subtly flavored, and when I mixed in the creme fraiche, it became overly sour and the flavor of the underlying soup disappeared. Even still, the richness and acidity of the soup could not cut the extreme fishiness of the geoduck. Overall, the celery, geoduck, and creme fraiche were all overpowering, and poorly interacted. \n\nRoasted Liberty Farms Duck Breast, duck leg confit, saffron, anson mills polenta, red cabbage, cocoa reduction: There were too many \"buts.\" The duck breast was good, but not as ducky as the Liberty Farms Duck Breast I've had before. There were two rectangular slices of confit. They tasted right, but the texture was too dry. The polenta grains had just the right amount of resistance, but were too salty. The cocoa reduction had a complex flavor, but there wasn't enough of it for me to go into more detail. The tart and crisp red cabbage was the one solid item, and was a good pairing to the rest of the dish. I could imagine this dish shining on a different night.\n\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts applewood smoked bacon. The sprouts were perfectly cooked, and the scattered leaves were so good they could have been used as a dish by themselves. The bacon was top quality.\n\nValrhona Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 Cake blood orange gel\u00e9e, jivara chocolate mandarin ice cream. The souffle was light, evenly cooked, and a good place between sweet and bitter. Their accompaniments were well matched, and plentiful enough to allow for you to experiment with a few cool combinations. The blood orange and raspberry sauce was especially good.\n\nWhite Peach sorbet, strawberry consomm\u00e9, fresh berries, almond shortbread.  Divorced from their actual fruits, it was fun trying to figure out what the sorbets contained-- scoops of apricot and raspberry sorbet were added, but not listed on the menu. Regardless, they each were delicious, smooth, and didn't have any ice crystals. \n\nI'm somewhat surprised to be giving a Michelin 1 Star a 3/5 rating, but the unevenness of the savory dishes, despite some exception components, was really a downer.", "author": "Jason B."}

If you do go for happy hour you need to arrive super early (around 3 for Fridays) and be prepared for a crowded bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-06-30", "description": "It's been awhile since I was last at One Market - it's usually one of my stand-bys for a wine trade lunch but so many other new places have been on my radar lately. So I met a supplier here yesterday (who had never been) and introduced him to this classy joint. A delightfully crisp Grenache Blanc started off our lunch, along with an order of piping-hot chickpea fries. My obsession with these fries knows no bounds. I could wolf down an order every day - they are just so light & fluffy, and the harissa aioli on the side is so divine I always ask for extra.\nWe then received a soup amuse of the coconut-lettuce soup in a little cup & saucer. Coconut & lettuce sounds like a strange combination, but it was actually very good. The coconut milk added a creamy smoothness, while pureed avocado and Little Gem lettuces provided a delicate celadon color - very visually appealing. There was some roasted peanut for crunch and little shreds of shrimp as well. For the next course, we shared the seasonal salad composed of roasted peaches, fennel, and arugula. The peaches were insanely good! The arugula seemed weirdly bitter alongside, but it was probably because the peaches were so freaking sweet. I found lush little ribbons of my favorite (domestic!) prosciutto, La Quercia, amid the tangles of shaved fennel which was also a great salty-sweet combination.\nI asked our server, the magnificent Wade, if it was possible to order the pasta course from the business lunch menu and he obliged. Out came a shallow bowl of chitarra pasta (clearly housemade, and perfectly toothsome) drenched in a white-wine & garlic sauce. The sauce was so simple, yet so delicious. Six littleneck clams rounded out the plate. We stuck with pasta for our next course and chose to share the cavatelli entree. A pile of cavatelli pasta (again, housemade) shared the plate with artfully shredded duck leg, hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, and broccoli di ciccio (akin to broccoli rabe). This was a great, earthy dish with lots of layers of flavor. My favorite layer was the thinly-sliced duck bresaola on top :-) I had to pack up half the dish because I absolutely had to order my favorite for dessert, the butterscotch pudding. I just can't leave this place without it. It's just so smooth and butterscotchy, and the \"singular sensation\" portion is the perfect size! The pecan wedding cookie on the side is deliciously crumbly as well.\n\nI was really glad the experience went so well today because I had such a bummer experience the last time (a few months ago): service was rushed & inattentive, the egg on the trout app was not properly cooked, and I found bits of shell in my crab dish. Clearly, it was a departure from the norm... All is forgiven, One Market! Wade was a particularly knowledgeable, yet not pedantic, server, while the wine director also made a personal appearance at the table. Great service from all members of the team.\n\n[PS: I swear I will make to the Weekly Beast at least *once* this summer!]", "author": "Stephanie S."}

The chef gave us a complimentary dish, which from the looks on yelp, everyone gets this dish. It was a decorative sashimi (tuna) on a silver spoon. It wasn't the freshest, but, hey, you can't complain when it's on the house!\n\nSince we did go on Valentine's, they had a prefix menu. I got a crab salad dish for appetizer and he got the half dozen oyster in a half shell. I'm not too big on oysters, but they were fresh and pretty delicious. The crab, I really have to say, they were not shady at all! I was impressed on how big they were and I loved that they combined that with pieces of mandarin oranges. For our main entree, I ordered the sole topped with more crab! Yummy!! He had the duck breast dish. I don't like duck too much because I'm used to the fatty roast ducks from Chinatown. But, they made their duck dish really unique. It consisted of 3 different pieces. One looked like a minced duck piece, another was a fattier piece and the last was a leaner but juicy part of the duck breast. They were all very yummy! As for our desserts....the bf ordered the sampler that had 3 diff types of sweets. One I remember was the chocolate souflee, that he said was a little disappointing because there wasn't hot chocolate flowing in the middle. I'm don't have a sweet tooth, so I can't comment on that. I ordered the cheese/fruit plate. OMG....Yummmmm-O! I heart cheese and I heart fruit! So, that's all I can say!\n\nAt the end of the day, I can say my overall experience was excellent! I was with my loved one and we had a great meal on a special day. The service was great and the food was great! I recommend you to come here for a romantic dinner for 2 any day. You don't have to spend as much as a restaurant like Gary Danko or French Laundry, but can still enjoy fine dining and superb service! Cheers!", "author": "Christina T."}

For example, I ordered a mojito from the bar (off the menu) as soon as our waiter came to our table. When he returned he brought my mojito and a plate of extra limes just in case I wanted them. That level of proactivity was so darling to me and that action alone sealed the deal to win my heart (translation: heart = frequent returns). \n\nI often order mojitos and if the mixture isn't exactly what I wanted such as if it's too strong, or not enough sugar and/or mint (or none) the whole drink just tastes OFF. At One Market ,not only was the mojito perfect, but it came with a plate of limes, so I could alter the drink to my own liking - that was just terrific! :)\n\nThe food was so beautifully presented as well.....top notch. I had the ahi tuna with a side of big fries and sunchokes - it hit the spot. What I loved the most was the bold earthy flavor of the sunchokes, which blended very well with my ahi.

Although there were a couple of vegetarian sides, I noticed that there were very few vegetarian entrees so you may want to take that into consideration depending upon the restrictions of your party. The wine menu is quite diverse and not everything on it is going to bust the bank. There is a reasonable size bar in the lobby but I found the service in there to be extraordinarily slow.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-19", "description": "Right off the bat I know I'm going to judge this place a little harsher and here's why. I don't like to walk more than a 2 block radius from my office for lunch, which severely limits my lunch options, but damn it, if I wanted exercise I'd go to the gym and if I wanted to enjoy the weather I'd go to Tahoe. Walking around in an urban jungle is not my idea of fun. My Dine About Town junkie friend wanted to try this so I went along for the ride, and I'm glad I did.\n\nThe restaurant is located on the corner of Market and Steuart and is relatively large with a full bar and high ceilings. It has wall to wall windows on all the sides facing the street so it was really well lit. Having reservations (thanks Open Table!) we were seated right away. My companion was there for DAT, so of course she ordered off that menu. I however, do not like to judge a restaurant based solely on what it can sell for $21.95 at lunch so I ordered off the regular menu. Her starter was the Farmer's Market Salad, a rather pedestrian blend of greens and not a lot of flavor with it. I got the Gulf Shrimp over Cucumber, Daikon, with Green Chile Vinaigrette and just wow. Every bite a perfect blend of sweet shrimp, crunchy cucumber/daikon, and a nice bit of spicyness with the green chile. This dish displayed some seriously complex flavors. Next up, she had the Grilled Idaho Trout with Almond Vinaigrette. The fish was pretty good, it was served butterflied with the skin still on, The almonds worked well with the dish, but my only complaint was that some parts of the fish were overgrilled and tasted charred and bitter. The parts that were cooked correctly however, was amazing. I had the House Made Duck Ravioli in the Foie Gras emulsion and Maittake mushrooms. Again, another complex dish displaying some very advanced cooking techniques. I was hesitant to order the Duck Ravioli only because I was expecting one large ravioli over a bed of mushrooms. Fortunately, my gamble paid off and I was rewarded with 6(!) decent sized ravioli. It came in a foie gras emulsion (which is just a fancy way of saying foam). I enjoyed the flavors here as well, duck, foie gras, mushrooms, the chef certainly knew what he was doing. Small complaint was that the emulsion was on the salty side, but only slightly. You want to know why foie gras tastes so good to me? Because every time I take a bite of it a little piece of PETA dies. If we weren't meant to eat fattened goose livers, evolution would have provided a better defense mechanism against humans. You don't see us eating fattened lion livers.\n\nWe also got some sides. My companion ordered the Chick Pea Fries with Harissa Aioli and I think they also brought out some Sauteed Spinach and Buttered Mash Potatoes. The Chick Pea Fries were somewhat of a novelty, I've never seen chick peas served this way before and the aioli was perfect to dip in. There was a skin on the Mashed Potatoes, probably a function of sitting under a heat lamp for too long. The Spinach was a little soggy and again only bleh.\n\nFinally for dessert, my companion got the Peach Brown Butter Tart with Blueberry Compote and Tahitian Vanilla Ice Cream. Individually, each element was really good, but they didn't mix well together as a dish. The blueberries kind of overpowered everything and the Tart wasn't as peachy as I would have liked it to be. I ordered the Grand Marnier Strawberry Trifle with Citrus Scented Chiffon, Ricotta, Marscapone, and Candied Almonds, and WOW. Granted the first bite I dug into was full of Grand Marnier and was a little heady, but each successive bite was like a dessert explosion in my mouth with strawberries, chiffon, and marscapone all battling to make the biggest bang. It was so good, I licked the bowl, if you don't believe me, check out my profile pics.\n\nService was impeccable. The waitress kept our bread basket bountiful and our water topped off. I think my companion was annoyed at her coming over so often, but I'm needy and crave attention so that was fine by me. The biggest downer was that she failed to mention that for Dine About Town, they charged an 18% gratuity. What the?!! I've never been mugged inside a restaurant before but this was a first. I didn't even order off the DAT menu and I still got charged the 18%. I mean really? Just...wow.\n\nMinus 1 Star for Taking 18%.", "author": "Tony V."}

We were running late due to rush hour traffic issues and called ahead to warn them we'd be about 15 minutes late. They were accommodating and pleasant, and our table was ready and waiting as soon as we arrived. Knowing we'd only have one glass of wine each, we asked to sample all three of their Pinot Noirs before deciding and our request was met with a smile. We settled on the Testarossa Lark Creek Cuv\u00e9e Pinot Noir, which was delicious.\n\nPluses: \n* The location is excellent -- right across the street from the Ferry Building, with easy access by car and inexpensive valet parking. An abundance of windows make for great people and scenery watching.\n* The Spring Vegetable Salad was delicious and refreshing, with crispy vegetables and a basil oil that was so good that it stood out as a favorite part of the entire meal.\n* The Almond Wood-Smoked Wild Salmon, a limited-time special, was delicious. It had a distinct flavor that was unlike any other salmon I'd tried before, and it was cooked to perfection. According to our server, it's only available about three weeks per year -- the only disappointing part of the dish.\n* The portions are huge for a fine dining restaurant -- way bigger than any I've seen at a Michelin-starred restaurant. My friend and I shared a single salad appetizer, split two entrees and two sides, and we might have finished 1/2 of what we ordered. \n* Service was prompt, organized and efficient. Glasses were kept full, the table was kept clean and organized, and plates were cleared quickly and unobtrusively. And, when a near-empty glass of wine was accidentally knocked over, it was cleaned up and the stain covered in what felt like seconds. Altogether, a great service experience.\n\nMinuses:\n* While the food was good, and had some definite bright spots, it fell short of spectacular. I can't put my finger on it, but it just wasn't quite at the level I've come to expect from similarly lauded San Francisco restaurants.\n* The Bacon-Wrapped Pork Tenderloin, recommended as one of their \"signature dishes\", was a little too salty for my taste. Granted, this may be because I'm a flexitarian and hadn't had pork in quite a while, but my instinct tells me it just wasn't quite right. Also, my fellow diner and I agreed that the pork was a little overdone, and the dish overall looked and felt like it had been kept under a heat lamp for a while. \n* The sides -- Wild Nettle Polenta and Buttery Mashed Potatoes -- also had that \"heat lamp\" appearance and, while tasty enough, were rather ordinary. \n\nOn balance, I had an exceedingly neutral experience at One Market. I'll go back again to relive the magic of my salad and to see if I can find satisfaction in another entree, but my first visit was just plain vanilla.", "author": "Stephanie R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-26", "description": "Save your bacon.\n\nDining out on an expense account, I ordinarily try and draw attention away from charges that are likely to raise an eyebrow, or worse, the hairs on the back of my CFO's neck. (Expensive dinners don't get flagged nearly as often as Thai massages or 900 numbers, for instance.) Once in a while, however, one slips by that I can almost predict will get bounced back to me along with a tell-tale yellow post-it, 'wtf?!' scrawled hastily across it, and the extent of my CFO's incredulity measured by the number of exclamation points tacked on for emphasis.\n\nThis would be the likely outcome of my latest act of gregarious gluttony, a meal at One Market with one of my best friends and his troupe of visiting ophthalmologists. The venue had been chosen carefully for its glitzy sex appeal to out-of-towners and for its rising star, Chef Mark Dommen, whose chutzpah in the kitchen repeatedly fetches the one-star satisfaction of the Michelin guide.\n\nI plotted, connived, and calculated how I might justify the excursion as a business expense, but I held out slim hope. It was important that I mentally prepare myself for the inevitable reaming that would accompany the price tag. This dinner would be on the Bank of Nils, and not my poor, struggling company, hence I vowed to keep it light, keep it cheap and to keep away from the wine list.\n\nThe moment I was handed a menu, caution was thrown out the window along with my prospects of retiring before the age of 90. I soothed my conscience by laying some of the blame on Yelp and attempted to come to grips with my complete lack of self control around haute cuisine. I would go down for this one, but at least I could claim that the menu, Dommen's cooking and the limits of the General Manager's patience would be tested to the fullest in the process.\n\nOur crew was mathematically challenged from the start - the curse of dining with doctors and not bankers, evidently. We started the evening as a table of five, ballooned to nine within the first half hour, and shrank back to five immediately after being accommodated at a larger table. Eight amuse-bouche were consumed by seven of us, six drink orders were placed and imbibed by five of us, four had no food allergies, three only liked red wine, two swapped plates, and one had the featured Weekly Beast, a 5-course tasting menu \"dining from head to hoof\" on lamb.\n\nAnd outside our window on Market Street, a partridge cooed softly in a pear tree.\n\nDommen's execution on the lamb was an impressive feat in its orchestration, interspersed and timed to coincide with the other orders of appetizers and main courses. Both the LAMB TONGUE SALAD and the ricotta CAVATELLI with braised shoulder were inhaled, each one an exciting combination of textures and flavors. The other two lamb courses - leg and loin - were respectable, but they paled in comparison to the stable of dishes on the regular menu.\n\nA \"mi cuit\" smoked TROUT served on a potato rosti with a farm-fresh egg and pancetta vinaigrette had me stealing bite after bite from my friend's plate. The grilled OCTOPUS was as exotic as a Moroccan spice market, its combination of eggplant, mint, and an harissa vinaigrette making our taste buds express their enjoyment by temporarily assuming control of the moan button on our vocal chords. The sous vide halibut, by contrast, was simple elegance, with the mushrooms and green apple flavors performing a soft ballad with the fish. Last but certainly not least, we ate the bacon-wrapped PORK TENDERLOIN with a dandelion persillade, the garlic and parsley giving character and depth to a pork overload. We had the distinct impression that Dommen was showing off with this dish, but he earned the right as it was every bit as delicious as it was billed to be by our waiter (and on the menu as the dish served to Gordon Ramsay on Hell's Kitchen).\n\nWe closed the meal with the fifth and final lamb dish: ricotta FRITTERS with pumpkin pot de cr\u00e8me, caramelized quince and pecan ice cream...100% pure, unadulterated decadence.\n\nThis is your friendly neighborhood corporate restaurant experience, but it is not remotely one-dimensional. In these turbulent economic times, elegance, like chivalry, is not dead, not even dying from the looks of this place. However, corporate expense accounts are a must, or better yet? Drunk, disorderly doctors who are overly generous in showing their appreciation for a great night out, thus sparing my fragile bank account...for now.", "author": "Nils E."}

Everyone is always polite and service is solid and precise.  It has one of my favorite starters around in their Chickpea fries.  This was the first place I've had them and I've tried them at a couple other spots and no one comes close.  The menu isn't complex which is nice.  Sometimes great food doesn't need to be too showy One Market is very good at this concept.  The happy hour is priced well for the area if you end up there.

It was pretty tasty but I found the carrot emulsion sauce a little strange.  My appetizer, the beet carpachio, was only okay. Nothing was particularly bad about it, but it was nothing to write home about either. My boyfriend however, ordered the trout appetizer and the pork and became very sick afterward. We're not sure if it was because of the trout being bad or the egg on top being undercooked, but whatever it was made him spend the night throwing up our rather expensive dinner.

The hostess was friendly, the manager was thoughtful and our waiter bent over backwards to be accomodating.\n\nStarted off the meal with a glass of champagne. They had three choices so I went with Mike, our waiter's suggestion. It was delicious. In terms of the menu there were several options, a la carte, six course and three course choices. Went with the three course option which was a shrimp appetizer with the lamb loin and a dessert choice as well as the mushroom soup and duck plate for my companion. All were good although I thought my lamb loin was better. It's so nice to not have to deal with fatty lamb on a chop. For dessert we got the mint chip chocalate sandwich as well as the cheese plate which was expensive but had very generous amounts of cheese, fruit and nuts. No need to get more than one cheese. It will be too much to eat. Pair that all with a nice dessert wine and/or port and you have a pricey but totally worth it meal. Will definitely go again.", "author": "Heather L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2006-01-16", "description": "I have heard alot about Bradley Ogden as a chef and had always wanted to try his restaurant. When the Dine About Town promotion featured One Market, I jumped on the opportunity. \n\nI choose the following from the limited DAT menu: Carrot and Ginger Soup with sweet Maine Shrimp, Duck Pappardelle and Profiterole.\n\nThe carrot and ginger soup was presented to me in an empty shallow bowl to showcase the shrimps, fried shallots and cream. The server then pour the soup into the bowl in a small jar. This help keep the soup hot and was a nice touch. The soup itself is pale yelllow in color, which makes me wonder where is the carrot? It was also very thick, which leads me to assume the soup was thicken with potatoes. The soup itself was sweet, the ginger flavor and a hint of curry highlighted the soup and the shrimp well. I enjoy this dish very much and would like it more if the soup is thinner.\n\nThe Duck Pappardelle was recommended by the waiter. However, I found it to be a little too salty. The pappardelle noodles seems a little stiff when I poked my fork at it, but was perfectly al dente when I chewed into them, so it must be because I am not used to the texture of ribbon pasta. I also felt the ratio of the duck sauce to pasta leaned too much towards the sauce, and I found myself eating the sauce alone after the pasta is done. Finally, being a duck sauce, it was a little too greasy for my palate. I personally would not order this dish again.\n\nThe profiterole was described as a cream puffed filled with ice cream to me and again was recommend by the server. It came with 4 cream puffed, drizzled with chocolate sauce and candied nuts. My usual complaint about desserts in restaurants is they are too sweet and this dessert is the same way. Also after the duck pasta, the dessert felt too heavy. Luckily, I did order a coffee to go with the dessert and that reduces the sweetness by a little.\n\nI was hoping to be turely wowed by this restaurant, but came away with a nice meal, but without the intention of going back. This may be due to the fact that I order the DAT menu and therefore not taken as seriously, but I have enjoyed several DAT  meals more than this one.

I said that because they couldn't accommodate my food allergy I was now having to order more expensive items that I didn't want and she said, well yes. She they pointed to this fish dish and said it was very light and good, but the description said it included salsa, so I am not really sure what she was thinking. She left us to look at the menu and of course I was pretty annoyed that I really wanted the octopus and the duck, but because apparently they could leave out the peppers or make a different sauce I was going to have to order something else or go to another restaurant. When the waitress came back I complained (yes, I complained) that it was ridiculous that I would have to pay more for something I didn't want because they didn't want to accommodate my food allergy and couldn't they just leave out the sauce or items that contained peppers?

I was hoping the huckleberry would be sweeter.  2 stars\n\nDessert sampler of 3 were okay to kinda good\n\nAtmosphere is too stuffy to be romantic.

And One Market is the perfect place to do it.\n\nIt's almost silly to comment on the location -- gorgeous no matter what time of day or weather. This is postcard version of San Francisco and a perfect backdrop.\n\nThe room is spacious and the waiters are polite, quiet, and quick. The menu is well balanced out for lunch with some wonderful choices. Both my party and I had the lentil soup (creamy and awesome!) and then I had the pear salad and she had the sole. Both dishes were great and presented beautifully. The dessert items didn't disappoint either -- we slip a C Pavlova and loved every spoonful of citrus-y heaven.\n\nNow for the other side of the story...  (you knew this is too good to be true, right?) With high-end experience comes high-end bill. All lunch entrees are at least $20, combining two appetizers would also result in $20-ish charge before any beverages, desserts, tips, or tax.

My understanding of how restaurants receive their star or stars, is to serve food of high quality..not necessarily complex dishes...combine that with mind-blowing flavor and do it consistently. One Market has been on my list of restaurants to try for quite a while...so I was psyched. I went for lunch with the wife and some friends and let me say...take Bart if at all possible or definitely use the valet for $12 bucks..at least during lunch anyway. The interior definitely suits the environment it's in...I can almost imagine the business deals made and lost in this place...a perfect place for that business luncheon to wooo clients...My entree was a Risotto with duck confit and the wife had their version of shrimp Louie..we skipped the appetizers for now. The risotto was great..creamy, flavorful with just the right bite and the duck had some nice crispy texture which went well with the risotto..I didn't sample enough of the shrimp Louie to give an honest opinion about it though. We moved on to desserts in which I had the Creme Brulee..pretty good as well. So, what's suppose to be flavorful, creamy, crisp...is..so why only 3 stars...as good as everything was, the flavors were not mind-blowing...I guess I've come to expect more at this level. Now to be fair..this was lunch and it was not the chef's tasting menu..I'll have to update this review once I've tried the dinner and or the tasting menu.", "author": "Orlando J."}

Had to ask a hostess for it. \n- Insisted on collecting menus later, but had to ask hostess to remove them. \n- Did not decide to card for drinks until he brought them all to the table. At which point he takes a very long time examining my cousin's (age 30) ID and proclaims that my other cousin (age 28) is \"almost there\". He wasn't joking. He apologized and said \"sorry I'm number dyslexic\" - but that would make her birth year 1918 instead of 1981...\n- Hastily removed items from the table and dropped a butter knife on me. Apologized, but did not pick it up himself. \n- Was not available to serve us beyond ordering the food; had to ask for bread from another waiter. \n- We ordered dessert as part of the DAT menu, but he still came around to ask us if we wanted any after our entrees were cleared.

Creamy but light and a great texture experience with the fresh veggies, pickles, scallops, and creamy broth. \n- Farmers Salad: Fresh w/ great variety, but how great can a plate of greens be. Esp when compared with the soup. \n\nEntrees: \n- Duck Confit: Worst looking dish ever. Completely unappealing in texture and color. Tastewise, not my cup of tea but others seemed to enjoy it. \n- Mussels: Delectable. Fresh, light, and savory. The lemongrass flavor really shined. Sauce was excellent for dipping bread into. \n\nDessert:\n- Only tried the pudding. It was fantastically creamy/custardy and tasted exactly like vanilla bean ice cream - but with a different texture. Very decadent. \n\nDrinks:\n- The lemonade is TASTELESS. I got the huckleberry and even the syrup lacked flavor. Tasted like water with a hint of lemon versus lemonade. \n\nI have to throw in that I LOVED the bread they give you!

The attached bar has a big after work scene, and when we got there at 6:30 it was PACKED and the overall noise level really took away from the experience in the restaurant, even though our table couldn't have been further away. Even hours later there were still frat-boy-esque yells and chants resonating across the restaurant every once in a while, which was pretty obnoxious.\n\nPRICE: Food-wise, the better dishes were well worth the price, but a few people felt they didnt get their money's worth.

And our waiter was a hoot - telling us all about how the wine glass made such a big difference in how the wine tasted...  He also had definite opinions on the food, which is always great.\n\nI suggest the foie gras - it was awesome, on a pecan bed with an onion (I think) foam over it.   The best I have had in the last five years.  Everything else was great, too.\n\nWe went next door to the ferry building and bought a zin and a pinot noir to drink with dinner.  They were happy to open them.  The wine list by the glass was fairly extensive and expensive ($14 prisoner, when the whole bottle is $35 - but it's an awesome zin mix.)  And their mixed drinks were intriguing; I had a coffee martini at the end of the night and one of us had a margarita that was tasty.\n\nThe trout appetizer was good (especially the raw egg!), the Caesar salad was excellent...  for main meals we had the mushroom pot pie, savory!  And the parma ham, the duck (excellent) and finally the pork - all done to perfection.  The sides were also excellent.\n\nFinally, the coup de grace was the desserts!  $5 bucks apiece (they encourage you to buy three, but not necessary.)  I had an almond chocolate cake that was incredible.  One of us had the donuts (superb) along with other stuff (I was too busy salivating over my cake to pay much attention.)\n\nAnother attention to detail was the warm rolls offered periodically.  Excellent olive bread or sour dough.  \n\nFinally, we plan to come back and sit at the chef's table in the kitchen (and the kitchen is incredible - huge, always busy, and state of the art.)  For $95 you get a six course meal prix fixe.  Sounds like a great deal to me. \n\nI think this is now one of my favorite restaurants - and it's right across from the ferry building where they have great cheeses, wines and organic food.\n\nThis restaurant definitely deserves its one star Michelin rating.

He actually remembered which wine we ordered at Bacar months ago and asked us if we wanted the same thing, what a memory. Management needs to know that its people like him that MAKE their restaurants.\nOkay so I had a work lunch here. We had a few glasses of wine and UNLIKE the joke called Bacar pours they were nice generous pours, thank you One market. Then we sat down and had appetizers, a fresh dungeness crabl cake DELICIOUS, farmers market salad and califlower soup - they knocked it out of the park on all 3. For lunch I had the Rice Flake Crusted Petrale Sole and it was just brilliant.  My colleagues had the ahi burger which I have never had and it was also just fantastic. Our service was very good, a blonde german gal who I had before. She is an 8.5 a little slow but since its lunch and it all happens at once we fully understand. Also the desserts were great, I cant remember but one was chocoalte. Anyway thanks to Joshua and the food this is FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY - BACAR is a rip off with an arrogant floor manager that was a total and complete asshole and but not for it the fact that I threatened to report him to the owners was completely rude.

I came here on a double date the other night for Dine About Town goodness, and for me it was more than good, it was somehow...amazing.\n\nPretty much, I loved everything I ordered. I loved the vegetable salad - the presentation was smart, everything was tasty. I'll say that I was impressed because I honestly don't eat vegetables too often. But I figured I should be good to my body and stop stuffing it with protein and fill it with some healthy green goodness. But after that, I did go right to the protein, with the pork tenderloin ribs..which got me really excited. No dryness.. repeat, no dryness.. succulent, juicy, well cooked meat, extremely well marinated, and a good portion. I lean more on the salty side of the palate, and I loved the flavor of this so I dunno, perhaps it may be more salty for others. Very well cooked. Last but not least, I had the Strawberry trifle, which was just good. Strawberries -good. Other layers of trifle - good. Can't go wrong with that. All of this for $32? Awesome. \n\nThe location? I'm not too picky; I'm more about food. But it's overlooking the Embarcadero area and right across is the Ferry Building. Generally a great area overall; I work in the financial district so I am familiar with it. The atmosphere is definitely more that of a business lunch, but at night I admit it's quite romantic. Our table was right next to the window so we had a great view. \n\nAlso, our waiter was VERY informative when it came to the dishes; he also recommended wines that were perfect for the dine about town menu, one white, one red (a Tudor pinot noir I believe).

Delicious, thick soup with cabbage and other vegetable bits, complemented with three small, slightly salty and flavorful meatballs.\n\nGreen salad:  Good salad--very fresh leaves, light dressing that wasn't overpowering..  Not as yum as the soup, although probably healthier.\n\nMussels:  I thought this was the weakest dish we had.  While there was a generous helping, the mussels didn't taste that fresh.  There was a spicy broth at the bottom of the bowl, that seemed to clash with the taste of the mussels.\n\nBeef pot roast:  The star of the night, for me.  Delicious, flavorful beef, cooked until it's soft and tender.  On a bed of mashed potatoes and some vegetable--I want to say kale.  Incredibly yummy.\n\nVanilla bean chocolate cream pie:  A bit too sweet for my taste.  My first impression is that it was like the dressed-up, adult version of a child's snack.  The vanilla bean portion had a wonderful, strong, real vanilla bean flavor, and the pie crust was perfectly crumbly.  A bit sweet for my taste (but most desserts are), but I didn't feel icky after a few bites.\n\nOverall, I was impressed with the food.  I went in with high expectations, and I think these were answered.

So I was like, WTF, but I politely responded, \"really it's okay and it's my treat.\" So we ordered a bottle of Cain Cuvee Merlot/Cabernet Blend and proceeded with an order of the roasted duck for each and roasted baby carrots on the side.\n\nThe duck was still pink but it's good that I've seen an episode of Emeril before explaining why duck breasts should be cook to pink (otherwise it would be chewy) because my friend almost complained to the server about her duck being undercooked. Anyhow, the duck was perfectly cooked and tasty, and despite being served in such a small portion, the meal was surprisingly filling. It blended well with the wine thanks to the recommendation of the server since at first I felt that he just sales-talked us (okay, so I'm not used with a Hispanic-looking server giving recommendations about wine but I was proven wrong).\n\nI'm happy with the service overall.

Across from the Ferry Building...  you can stroll along the Embarcadero... you're backdrop is the Bay Bridge.  How can you go wrong?\n\nRESERVATION: I used OpenTable to make reservations for 5.  I included under Note: \"Birthday celebration\".  Not only did I get a reservation confirmation via email that night, I also received a call from One Market a few days after booking to confirm my reservation and also to ask for the name of the celebrant.  Additionally, the night before- they called to let me know of the location and the cost for valet parking.  Wonderful follow up!  They made logistics of the evening easy and smooth.\n\nPARKING:  $10 for dinner valet.  Cheapest in the area.  Its found on Stuart Street.  The valet staff was fabulous!  Friendly, polite!  We were one of the last tables in the restaurant.  The valet attendant even brought my car from the garage, parked it right in front of the restaurant, and brought my keys in to me before leaving.  What a sweetheart!  They made everything so easy and convenient!\n\nCUSTOMER SERVICE:  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess and a gentlemen who seemed to be the manager that evening.  We were seated promptly near the window (which I highly recommend, esp if SF blesses us with a clear night).  \n\nOur waiter was knowledgeable about all the wines, pairings, ingredients, and made wonderful suggestions.  He was a balance between being there when we needed him and also letting us enjoy the night.  \n\nFOOD:  3 of us ordered the \"Market Menu\" which is a 3 course menu.  \nCaliflower Soup- AMAZING!  I read reviews on yelp, and thank you to those who yelped about it because what a well-balanced experience that was--- creamy from the califlower, crunch from the pear & ramps, soft from the scallops.  My second course was the Pan Seared Scallops with mushrooms which was wonderful!  It was a hearty portion, as there were 6-7 scallops on my dish.   I tried the sweet breads which looked just like hushpuppies.  Personally, sweetbreads are not my cup of tea so I can't speak too much about that.  Our table shared an array of sides: White Corn grits (which I am now a believer in), Sauteed Baby Beets (fresh, crunchy, flavorful), Chickpea Fries with Aioli sauce (FABULOUS!), and Sauteed Spinach with Garlic Chips (to die for! esp, if you are a garlic lover like I am).  Out of all of these, I recommend the fries and the spinach!\n\nMy third and final dish was dessert!  Ahhhh (siighh) dessert!  Dessert is the equivalent of the last glance that you give to your love before you leave them after the best weekend getaway.  Its the final hurrah... you're lasting impression.... the cherry on top.  On the \"Market Menu\", it states that you have a choice of the \"Seasonal Desserts\".  They actually allow you to pick from their entire dessert menu.  Be still my heart!  My favorite dessert is Creme Brulee.  Lo & behold--- there it was \"Creme Brulee Duo with petite cookies\".  One mini creme brulee... accompanied by one mini expresso creme brulee.  I'm in heaven.  Rich, creamy, and a substantial crunchy top brulee.  Loved the mini cookie.  There was a mini biscotti as well which had anise in it which I'm not too big of a fan of, but still enjoyed.  Overall, fabulous!!! fabulous!!!\n\nI'm one of those friends that likes share food.  I like to make perfect little amuse bouche's (if you will) of my plate and taste other's dishes too.  So here's what else I tasted: On the Weekly Beast, I had the lamb tongue with fingerlings.  I was COMPLETELY APPREHENSIVE at first, but was surprised at how darn tasty it was.  Eating such a delicacy is definitely a mind over matter battle.  The bacon wrapped pork sat on a bed of apples.  Moist and succulent!  Butterscotch pudding- heavenly.  I don't even like butterscotch, and I loved it.  It was thick, rich, and bursting with flavor although not bum-rushing your taste buds leaving you over-whelmed.  I also tasted a seasonal dessert of carmelized bananas accompanied by a chocolate tart and house-made vanilla bean ice cream.  Oh my tasty!  \n\nI'm coming back!  Everything was delicious.  Beautifully presented.  Staff and service - well orchestrated.  We dined for over 3 hours and I enjoyed the entire experience.  \n\nI also thought it was interesting to see a diversity in patronage.  Date nights, families, couple with a behaved child, business dinners, and we were a table of 5 (ages ranging from 28-60's).  All of us truly enjoyed the evening.", "author": "Deanna A."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-15", "description": "Full review and photos in blog\n\nOne Market (San Francisco) - Thanksgiving Dinner 2010\n\nThere are many different holidays in the Western world which are celebrated in all countries like Christmas or Easter but there are certain holidays which are very specific for each country. Often these holidays are related to the founding of a country like Independence Day in the US, Bastille Day in France or the Day of German Unity. The day which represents for us from a foodie perspective the most specific American celebration of gathering and food was always Thanksgiving. There are remotely related holidays in Europe like Erntedankfest in Germany but those celebrations are much more based on a religious background and are often only celebrated in scattered areas. \nWhen we moved to the US Thanksgiving was for the first few years always an international potluck we celebrated with many coworkers from all over the world at the research institute we worked at that time. In the last few years we often used the Thanksgiving break for a short foodie trip to Las Vegas but this year Thanksgiving was for us the starting day of a longer trip to the Bay Area and the wine country. We never really had problems to find a good restaurant in Las Vegas on Thanksgiving but it turned out to be surprisingly challenging to find something suitable in San Francisco. Either many restaurants we were interested in weren't open for Thanksgiving or they were open but had very boring and vastly overpriced special menus. After many phone calls and emails with different restaurants we finally settled on One Market for our Thanksgiving Dinner. \n\nOne Market is the best known restaurant of the Lark Creek Restaurant Group. The Lark Creek Restaurant Group was founded by Chef Bradley Ogden and business partner Michael Dellar in 1989. Bradley Ogden has over the years established himself as a well respected chef in the culinary world and was critical in setting up all twelve restaurant of the Lark Creek Restaurant Group throughout California and Las Vegas with several more planned in the near future. Even though Bradley Ogden was the founding chef of One Market in 1993 since then a number of executive chefs have followed him with Mark Dommen at the helm for the last six years. Chef Dommen started his culinary education at the California Culinary Academy before honing his skills and moving up the ranks by working for many exceptional chefs like Hubert Keller (Fleur de Lys), Gary Kunz (Lespinasse) and Jean-Louis Palladin (Palladin). He was also opening chef of Julia's Kitchen in Napa before joining One Market. \n\nOne Market restaurant is located across the Ferry Building in one of the large buildings which house banks and investment firms. The restaurant is on the first floor and has windows all-around which gives the place an open feeling. \n\nWhen we arrived at One Market the place was extremely crowded in the entrance and it soon became clear that they were about 20-30 minutes behind their schedule. They have a small bar area to the right where most people waited for their table.\n\nThe dining area has two levels. We were seated on the lower level and even though the tables are relatively close to each other the restaurant didn't feel too overcrowded. \n\nWe started the night with two cocktails. No Partridge - Hangar One spiced pear vodka, Orchard pear liqueur, Domaine de canton ginger liqueur. Pleasantly fruity cocktail with nice pear flavor which got a nice kick from the ginger liqueur. The drink had a nice balance between alcohol and fruitiness. Hot Apple Pie - Tuaca, mulled apple cider, cinnamon whipped cream. The warm cocktail was perfect for this cold night and was indeed reminiscent of an apple pie.

I don't go to fancy restaurants that often, but after going to a number of them, I do get less and less impressed with the food. One starts to wonder if it's worth paying so much for the quality that you can make or get somewhere else for much less.\n\nAs for One Market, I can say the octopus appetizer was surprising interesting and tasty. I expected octopus to be bland and chewy, but this was the exact opposite. The waitress was friendly and knowledgeable. She even gave me the recipe for one of the dishes. The rest of the meal was just ok. I usually dislike the wine choices made for wine pairings, but this pairing was probably the one of best pairing I ever had. Cheers to the Sommelier.

I'm sure this restaurant is about to get a slew of negitive reviews due to their mismanaged reservation timeline (many pissed off patrons in the bar waiting for over 45 minutes for their tables) but, I've worked at restaurants before and know these things may happen beyond anyones control.  Luckily, my boyfriend and I wouldn't let a late seating ruin our night out...\n\nBetween the two of us we had...\n\nAmuse bouche: Egg flan with foie gras (wonderful flavor but odd texture...nothing wrong with the dish, I just never like flan/pudding/mush textures while I'm eating)\n\nAppetizers: \nHim- Oysters (he thought they were amazing, oysters just aren't my thing either so I can't comment)\nMe: Lightly Smoked Tasmanian Ocean Trout \n\"Mi Cuit\" potato r\u00f6sti, organic chicken egg, pancetta vinaigrette (Quite simply, the best \"breakfast\" I have ever put in my mouth.  I know it was a dinner app but I could eat this dish for breakfast every day, YUM!)\n\nEntrees:\nHim:  Mushroom Pot Pie (Absolutely amazing...loved the mushroom flavors and very well-balanced.  The boyfriend is a meat-eater but he LOVED this dish...I did too, slightly better than my choice!)\nMe: Thai snapper and crab dish with fennel:  (I can't remember the exact details but this was very good as well...Although, I have to say the Pot Pie was better)\n\nDessert:\nHim:  Trio of Chocolate (very rich, very good...the cream soda drink thing was delicious!)\nMe:  Pear tarte with pear ice-cream (not really ice-cream but can't think of the name) and creme fraiche (I liked this dessert more than the chocolate...but, I also love fruity desserts.  The \"ice-cream\" was to die for, you could really taste the fresh pear).\n\nOverall, One Market was a wonderful dinner.

It is definitely a high-powered, corporate write-off, treat-your-client locations. That being said, the price and the overly-high expectation kept this from being five-stars as it is actually a great place to dine otherwise. \n\nThey have wonderful service and are very accommodating to whatever request, birthday or seating. Our most recent table had crab cakes and calamari to share. Both were very well done, especially the crab cakes. I have heard and agree with the suggestion that these are must haves. I split the daily roasted chicken with a friend; they suggest we order well-ahead, so we put in our request before the rest of the table ordered. The chicken was cooked very well and I disagree with other reviewers that it is too raw. Though slightly pink, it was exceptionally juicy and very well and appropriately seasoned. I have no complaints here. The sides we chose were the greens and the chickpea fries. Both were wonderful sides and would be enough to order by themselves. (The chicken comes with two side choices.) For dessert we split the three-plate mini-sampler. We ordered two and tried each of the six options. This was fantastic. Although nothing was particularly good, I attribute that to the well-rounded quality; nothing lacked. The others at our table had scallops and duck and they all commented on the good quality of their food. \n\nThe current chef often sends out complimentary mini-appetizers which went over well. (The day we went most recently, they offered salmon roe.)\n\nI really enjoyed the experience here. The only drawback is, very understandably, the price and the somewhat stuck-up atmosphere which is through no fault of the waiters. The people who are there, are bored, and are only there cause they want to show off their wallets. It makes us little people feel slightly intimidated.", "author": "Larry Y."}

The environment was not incredibly elegant, romantic, or sophisticated, but more along the lines of being nice and professional. That wasn't what bothered me though.

I love seafood and was going to go for the mahi mahi, but the waiter really talked up the lambchops. Apparently, the Grilled Sonoma Lambchops was one of their specialties. \n\nIt was disappointing. While the texture of the lamb was good, the flavoring was quite off. The meat was over marinated and was quite salty. The side of brocoli was also extremely salty. A couple of my friends also said the same about their dishes, which leads me to believe that it's just their style. I had to keep drinking water after, so it didn't seem worth it to me to spend 50 bucks (without wine) here.

Strangely enough, the hostess said they were fully booked - but somehow managed to squeeze us in - and I was pleased they did.  \n\nAs to be expected with any nice restaurant near the ferry building the prices are pretty extreme, but on the bright side they don't skimp on the portions - even for lunch.  \n\nThey brought out the bread as soon as we ordered and YAY...warm bread & soft whipped butter, for me always a strong indicator of the calibur of a restaurant.  Just delicious.\n\nI ordered their portobello mushroom soup, and skatewing.  The portobello mushroom soup had a poached egg in the center and they poured the soup around it, and it also had something akin to rice crispies in the bowl - and while it may sound odd - it was quite good.  Though the manager, I think in an attempt to turn over the table quickly basically ripped the soup out from under me before I had finished.  \n\nThe skatewing was good - not the best I've had (thank foreign cinema for that), but definitely solid, if a little heavy on the capers and lemon juice.  Collegue ordered a ceasar salad that just looked like 3 large pieces of lettuce with shaved parmesan on it. \n\nThe waitstaff was friendly without being overbearing - but brought the check faster than the food.

The food is great, excellent choice of wines  (wine is food right??).  As for the actual food itself, they have a great seasonal menu which I like--a non-static menu.  There are many reasons why this is a consistently TOP 100 restaurant, so I'll try to highlight a few.\n\nAtmosphere\n  The restaurant has excellent decor (as always), from the nicely done curtains to the table set-up.  Upon entering, the bar is to the right and the dining section is to your left.  The restaurant is right on the corner of 1 Market (err duh??) so expect a lot of light and window views (exhibitionist views?).\nThe only thing you have to drown out are the corporate sheep at the bar.  Of course, I use to be a corporate whore so I can't exactly complain about the people.  \n\nFood\n  One reason why I like this restaurant is the use of natural, seasonal foods.  The products are excellent in quality and fresh (e.g. Peking duck instead of the drier Mandrake Duck), but--once again--expected for a top 100 restaurant.  Their fusion appetizers are great--a good hint of Asian flavors with American sauces and spices.\n\nService\n  The service is always excellent--top notch.  Our waiter was knowledgeable with the wine (esp. since I'm partial to reds) and quite a bit of the food on the menu.  He served us adeptly, any better and we'd be spoon fed.

The broccoli and spinach were great, but I don't think I'm a fan of chickpeas!  Others at the table had the skatewing and the housemade sausage.  The portions were a great size of these other entrees.  Mine must have been California cuisine.\n\nThe service was great, and our server was very friendly, telling us about the different menu items and their specialties.  Again, these places are rather pricey for some of the food portions, so I would probably take my own wallet elsewhere.", "author": "Angela O."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-02-07", "description": "It deserves 3.5 stars, but Yelp can't manage that.\n\nBefore my first visit to One Market, I had an expectation of going to an expensive restaurant that was one of the finest in San Francisco. I can confirm that the restaurant is expensive, but the jury is out on whether it is one of the finest.\n\nFirst, for the good parts. One Market has amazing servers who provide the perfect level of attention without interrupting. They facilitate dinner at One Market being a social occasion. This further amplifies and ideal atmosphere. My wife and I really enjoyed their cocktails too. Their bartender mixed a pretty near perfect mojito. For the food, I was less impressed but it may have been what we ordered. My wife and I both had their \"Market Menu\". I believe this changes by the night. For this night, I had their halibut while my wife had pork tenderloin. We also had a dessert and appetizer with the market menu. I had the Gazpacho while my wife had the salad. \n\nFirst comment about all of the food at One Market is that presentation is superb. I was not as thrilled with the taste. The Gazpacho was good but didn't shake me to my boots and the halibut was near tasteless. My wife fared better with the pork tenderloin which had a beautiful smoked flavor as well as a nice texture. Her starter was underwhelming however. Dessert was equally mixed. The Chocolate Toffee Almond Crunch Cake was incredible. But they were out of the Chocolate Souffle and the other dish my wife had (forgot the name, I'm afraid) was less impressive. \n\nAll this for a $70/person meal strikes me as underwhelming. Certainly, One Market is above average. But for the price, the value is not quite there in my opinion.", "author": "Jamie E."}

I invited a friend who helped me secure my new job, thinking this would be an excellent place to have a \"thank you\" dinner.\n\nI will take the blame for being late (to be fair, it was raining) and a total fumbling idiot when it came to finding a parking space.  It didn't even strike me that they would have valet until about 20 minutes after my reservation.  I drove up to the restaurant, didn't see an attendant, so called to where the person was.  The restaurant put me on hold...?\n\nI finally just pulled over and wandered around (in the rain) until I found the valet guy.  So I was wet and feeling flustered when I walked in.  My friend had been seated and just after I had slipped into the table, the server came over to tell him that we might have to move tables because there was another reservation after us.  (Of course, no one was waiting for our table when we left...)\n\nI was really miffed about the fact that we were being hurried along.  I was late, so I didn't take too long to study the wine list (which as a side note, is a really great wine list - mostly Northern CA/WA/OR) and went with the Ridge Lytton Spring Zinfandel.  A great zin for people who like their zin.  My pour was reasonably large and after a few sips, I was feeling less stressed out about how things had started.\n\nIn order, I chose the caesar salad, the skirt steak, and the bread pudding.  I was impressed with the presentation of the other appetizer option (cauliflower soup served over scallops) but my salad was just a boring caesar salad.  I kept thinking, shouldn't I be more impressed?\n\nWhen the steaks came (portion sizes decent, with a few roasted potatoes and some steamed greens) I happily dug in.  The meat was tender and very good.  I was ambivalent about their sauce, which seemed to have a subtle burnt taste.  \n\nDessert was again, \"good\" but not great.  It was served warm (kudos on that) and I did find the caramels that came afterwards to be a sweet treat.  Oh!  And I almost forgot the seared tuna slices that came out as a starter, compliments of the kitchen.  That was a fun surprise.\n\nThe bread and water service was great, but our server forgot a glass of wine.  Since it was part of the pre-fixe Dine About Town wine pairing, I would have expected him to be able to at least tell us about the wine, but instead he was guessing and interrupting other servers to provide the details for us.  Strange...\n\nFor $125 after tip, I was completely underwhelmed.  I'd like to try this place again - when hopefully someone else will be picking up the check, dare I risk being disappointed by another dinner here.", "author": "Lindsay M."}

The ambiance of the restaurant is very nice and the volume in the room isn't too loud.  However, their wait service was lacking.  Our waitress was nice enough, but didn't leave us with that warm fuzzy feeling.  While delivering our drinks, she kept reaching over people to hand out glasses.  When telling us about the specials for the day, she mumbled and we couldn't understand her.  And when we told her we were ready to order, she said okay... then walked away for 10 minutes.  Once our meal was ordered, it was an hour before we received our food.   \"While waiting, I must have counted 3-4 instances where various waiters/bus boys dropped silverware, plates, or trays on the floor.  Luckily, I didn't get hit by any of the food on it -- the same could not be said about the guy sitting across from me.\nThe food itself was not that impressive.  I had the crab cakes, which were about the size of quarters.  For $15, I expected a little bit more.  My fellow diners had the cauliflower soup with scallops, I had a bit of food envy over that.

My expectations were especially high after reading some good reviews and keeping in mind that this is definitely one of the pricier restaurants that I have dined at.\nAfter arriving, we were promptly seated at a small table by the door. I noticed that the restaurant was filled with people on business lunches, etc, and there did not seem to be enough waiters to give every table prompt service. After a long wait, we placed our order. At the beginning of the meal, they do serve delicious bread, and because our food came out so slowly, we asked for 1 or 2 more baskets of bread to munch on. My first course was the Farmer's Market Salad. It was extremely bland - just a jumble of leaves tossed in balsamic vinegar. I could have made this in my sleep! My boyfriend's soup was slightly better, but the flavors were bland and reminded me a bit of Campbell's canned chicken noodle soup..\nNext came our main courses. While the presentation was nice - my mushroom ravioli was surrounded by foam, the taste was once again, bland and boring. After eating several bites of it, I was already tired of the taste, and my boyfriend offered to trade dishes with me. His pot roast was quite tender and flavorful, but once again, nothing in particular stood out to me. And finally, after another very very long wait, our dessert arrived - strawberry shortcake. The strawberries were fresh, the cream was good, the cake portion of it was okay, another mediocre course. Sadly, the bread was the best part of the meal.\nIf we hadn't been eating this lunch at Dine About Town prices, I would have been outraged at how much we would have to pay for this meal. And if you think that perhaps the menu items on the DAT menu did not accurately portray courses from One Market, note that many of the items we ordered were on the actual menu itself.

I know on the menu it said gratuity on group of 7+, so for them to do that to me, it felt like they were judging me and i felt like they were thinking i wasn't going to tip them or something. \n\nOverall...food is okay and they need new staff and i felt very unwelcomed.\n-Hostess needs to be nicer and welcoming. i dont care how busy they are, it's a restaurant business.\n-Busser or runners need to have some kind of a smile or something... they have a look like i was an inconvenience to them\n-server was really nice, but the gratuity threw me off", "author": "Joanne H."}

The overall atmosphere was very pleasant; the decor was quite neutral, but tasteful nonetheless. We were greeted by a host who all but refused to seat us without reservations. No worries - we grabbed drinks and waited until a table became available.\nOnce seated, I found our waiter to be very friendly; he struck my preferred balance of being informative without becoming overbearing. Luckily, this visit was before the State of California took our foie gras away, so my choice of appetizer was easily made. That was followed by a Caesar salad - I personally do not agree with serving Romain leaves whole, but it certainly did not detract from their flavor or ability to hold fresh parmesan. I ordered steak as a main course (I'm not exactly sure of the cut, but it may have been a NY strip). It was prepared well, not much room for creativity here. To be completely honest, I may have had slightly heightened expectations brought upon by seeing their Michelin Star proudly displayed, but I was thankfully not disappointed by the quality of the food.\nDessert followed suit. The cheese platter was markedly underwhelming, but the berry sorbet I tried was quite impressive. Overall, I was rather pleased with the menu and service. One Market is definitely one of my preferred places to eat in San Francisco.", "author": "Paul S."}

Unfortunately I was extremely disappointed with both the service and my meal last night! Firstly, they tout their association with the Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch and use of sustainable meats and produce. But our waitress had a tough time explaining why day boat scallops from PEI were on the menu. It gets better. I ordered the Golden Beet & Saffron Soup with geoduck clam, ahi tuna, and green apple. (Sounds delicious, right?) Well, halfway through it I realized there was shrimp in it. I'm mildly allergic to shrimp so I mentioned it to the waitress and she insisted it was listed as an ingredient on the menu. To her credit, she had the soup removed from our bill, but when I returned home I double checked the menu online, and, as suspected, no shrimp. That's a pretty serious mixup, and I'm lucky I'm not severely allergic. Aside from that, the meal was lackluster, bland, overpriced, and run-of-the-mill. To top it all off, my guests and I could not get a cab afterwards and ended up walking a mile or more up Market Street to find a bus. The restaurant tried calling a cab, but after waiting for more than 30 minutes, we decided it was best to track down some public transit. Needless to say, I will not be returning to One Market for a meal anytime soon. There are far better places in this city!", "author": "Jessica M."}

Not just on one occasion, but several. But since I find the food quite enjoyable, as well as the location and decor of the restaurant, I decided to pop in on a recent sat evening for a quick meal. I called for reservations and whoever answered seemed pissy. Going against my better judgement, I went ahead and made a reservation anyways. Upon arrival, she was worse in person than on the phone.\n\nAsides from that, the menu emphasizes fresh, locally sourced ingredients, with options such as duck, fish, and lots of vegetables. I think the Bradley Ceasar Salad is probably one of the better ceasars Ive had, ice cold romaine, not overpowered by a dressing thats just tart and creamy enough, topped with delicious parm and of course the croutons....the duck was perfectly seasoned, but on the one occasion my friend ordered the skate...it was a bit unnerving. So it was served with poppy seeds and at first glance, we couldn't figure out if it was the skin, or what all the spreckles were. Even after being reassured by our server that this was not skin, its probably safer to stick with some other type of fish if you're not into wierd looking spots on your food. If you're not into a full meal, they do have a bar bites menu at the bar. You really can't go wrong with potato skins layered with bacon and cheese, sliders with oodles of carmelized onions, and of plate of fries.\n\nSo yes, the food is good, and the location is great, and its a beautiful restaurant, but really, there are so many other restaurants in the city to choose from, why would I subject myself to such rude off-putting treatment by a hostess?

They started out with olive & sour dough bread. (The sour dough was superb...yum). I had the Bradley's Caesar Salad as my app, Open Face Pea Ravioli as my entree and for dessert, I had the Nectarine Tart with Blackberry compote (which just means fresh berries on top). Caesar Salad was nothing special, but I did notice more lemon juice in their dressing. And if you are a cheese fan, you'll love it b/c they put LOTS of cheese on top of  the salad. The Open Face Pea Ravioli was just okay. The ingredients seemed very fresh, but a bit lack of character in taste for this dish. It was a bit too plain and the peas were not cooked too well. If you're a pea fan, then this is your dish b/c there's a lot of peas. You're basically eating a plate of cooked peas. The dessert was AMAZING! Very buttery with a fresh fruity taste! Perfect with your latte. \n\nWe also ordered the cheesy pasta and Beet Carpaccio with\nradishes, fresh chevre, sherry vinaigrette. The cheesy pasta was SUPER CHEESY and rich (Not worth it). The Beet Carpaccio however was fabulous. The app was super fresh and the taste of the sherry vinaigrette, radish and beet was very unique and tasty. \n\n\nOther Dine about Town options: \nAppz: Asparagus Soup with pasture egg \"sous vide\", parmesan, prosciutto (My sis had this app and it was rich and tasty)\nEntree: Halibut with mustard green ravioli, shiitake mushrooms, bean sprouts, mushroom-dashi broth (Sis got this entree and the Halibut was cooked to close to perfection.

They have a great menu for private events and the events team is VERY flexible and helpful.  As I said, a lot of the foofoo chichi restaurants won't start an event at 10am or provide morning treats for my guests. Even though One Market isn't open for breakfast, they provided a great spread of goodies that everyone seemed to enjoy.  They were flexible with the room set up and a changing number of tables.  The service was great - everyone was very courteous.  Shawn, my event captain, was on her toes but cool and even verified details I hadn't thought about.  Eric - the co-captain (?) even helped me carry things in from my car.  The rest of the servers were great.  The room I had was smallish, and has it's back to the kitchen - so there is a bit of a noise issue, but not real bad.  \n\nThe food was delish.

I went here for a friend's birthday with her richy rich parents. We were led past all the \"normal\" diners and into the kitchen, where the staff were calmly, yet efficiently preparing the patron's meals. At the chefs table, you are welcomed by the chef, then led to the wine storage room by the sommelier, who talks about the restaurant's selection of wine and allows you to taste some. Then you go back to the table and partake in gastronomic fantasy. I think we ate a 7 course meal, but after the first three courses I hit a food coma and blanked out. I just remember that I kept shoveling food into my mouth, despite my buttons popping, because damn that was some good eats. risottos and and scallops and chocolate tortes, oh my.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-16", "description": "Just missed the 5 star-mark - by a soup!  We went for the first time (yes, I know, unbelievable) on a Dine About Town night.  Not sure yet if i think the meal you get on a DAT night is a good measure of a restaurant or not.  But it's a false economy, no matter what.  I always want to order off the \"real menu!\"  We stuck to our guns, mostly, and the bill ended up being $100.  Which isn't cheap (well, maybe for One Market it is), but most of the meal and experience were well worth it.\n\nFirst course, the aforementioned soup:  Touted as a portabella mushroom soup with a soy flan thing in the middle, and a beautiful tiny fried quail egg on top.  presentation was great - they poured the soup from a little tureen into the bowl, making the soy disc a little island.  however, it tasted so incredibly weird that we couldn't finish it.  It smelled very strongly of beef broth, but a very sweet beef broth, almost like a french onion soup.  not mushroomy at all.  it tasted sweet too, but also a bit sour, like when you overcook garlic. and the soy thing in the middle was just bitter.  and there were crunchy floating things that tasted like bits of matzo crackers but supposedly was crispy rice.  just a bad, bad dish.  the waitress said \"most people like it\", implying that we were rubes, and that the dish had \"very strong asian and fish flavors\" that i guess our untrained pedestrian palates wouldn't appreciate.  um, no.  (she redeemed herself later tho - actually very excellent attentive service.)  and no mushroom taste discernable at all.  a total failure, which was truly shocking compared to the rest of our meal.  we actually sent the soup back and asked to see the menu for another app, this time off the regular menu.  waitress offered to give us the cesar salad that was on the DAT menu, but we decided to go for the real deal.  she recommended a \"bistro\" starter - a delicious potato rosti,  perfectly crispy on the outside, warm and pillowy on the inside.  Atop that, a kind of loose puree of watercress, and then a peachy-pink mound of smoked trout.  The waitress warned us that it wasn't \"too smoky\", as if we we would be afraid, being the obvious avant-garde-asian-mushroom-soup-hating-hicks that we were, and it wasn't.  It was perfectly smoky.  On top of that, a quivering pure white organic poached egg with a creamy yellow center to ooze down over the mound.  The plate was swirled with a vinaigrette blended with little bits of savory pancetta.  great flavor combo.  Very rich.  Very Lyonnaise!  Fabulous.\n\nMy duck:  two ways - tender perfectly pearly-red breast meat, served atop duck confit - in this incarnation, a kind of ground duck patty, spiced, almost sausage-y.  Served alongside were roasted chestnuts - nice nutty sweet accompaniment to the maple-y duck breast.  My sister's scallops: 3 plump - and she says - perfectly cooked diver scallops, on a creamy cloud of mashed taters, with sauteed fennel, and a delicious tarragon butter.  The tarragon and fennel went exceedingly well together, despite or maybe because of being both licorice  flavors.\n\nDesserts were incredible.  A pear galette with vanilla ice cream was topped by a perfect paper-thin cross-sectional slice of baked pear.  The pastry itself was warm, chewy yet flaky, with a delicate pear flavor.  Sister's dessert was a take on churros dipped in thick Mexican chocolate - here they were called chocolate fritters with molten chocolate inside, served with a cup of thick melted white chocolate, with a great bite of cinnamon.  And our waitress comped us a 3rd dessert -  for our hatred of the soup - a mint chocolate chip ice cream sandwich.  I'm the only person on earth who hates mint and chocolate together, but my sister said the ice cream - a ball of chocolate-flecked jade - had obviously been made with fresh spearmint.\n\nDespite the terrible (and I mean really terrible) start, I will go back and try the \"real\" menu.

I was immediately steered to some of the more expensive options ($120-150 range), even though about 1/3 of the list is under $100.  When I explained that I would like a wine under $100 (this was a business meal and I did not want red flags going up for the reimbursement), I was given a suggestion at $105.  I again asked for something under $100, and sommelier said there was nothing she could recommend at that price point.  Talk about the hard sell.  In short, dinner definitely started off on a low point.  From there, we recovered.  The appetizers were good, especially the foie.  But the pork tenderloin I was recommended was too salty -- should have stuck with the fish.  Come here if you want old school SF, a nice view of the Embarcadero, and an undeserved Michelin star.  Don't come for the service.", "author": "Matthew C."}

Unfortunately, it was...meh.  I still wasn't over the shock of a ridiculously ginormous rib eye the night before (see my review of Bacar), and definitely wanted something light.  So I ordered the halibut, though I wasn't hugely optimistic about it, given that the restaurant was almost empty, and that's never a good sign for the turnover of seafood in a place.  The halibut itself turned out fine -- fresh, tender and perfectly cooked.  It didn't have a lot of flavor though, and wasn't particularly well-complimented by what looked like shreds of celery and fried green beans.  I was all ready to be impressed by the accompanying foie gras \"emulsion,\" but that turned out actually to be foie gras \"foam,\" and as I've never liked the idea of foamy food, that didn't do anything for me either.  \nThe dessert was the best part, and out of blackberry cobbler with vanilla ice cream (the smallest portion), a mint ice cream sandwich (supposedly very good; I don't like mint ice cream) and a brownie with coconut ice cream (disproportionately huge scoops), the last was the best.  The sides of chocolate sauce were also delicious.  Didn't make up for a overall mediocre dinner though.\n\nWhat DID almost help was the view of a guy dressed in a Santa suit at the bus stop across the way.  He hung out for quite a while fiddling with some chained-up bike, starting out fully dressed, but at some point stripping, apparently naked from the waist down.  As he continued fiddling with the bike, we were struck by his particularly pink bum.  Was he really naked? we asked each other.  And if so, why couldn't we see his little man parts?  The debate continued throughout dinner and only ended when we were finally ready to leave.  As we stood up, we got a better view of what was going on -- of Santa waiting at the bus stop, having apparently given up on the bike, wearing -- and we were almost disappointed -- pale-pink jammies.   \nAlas, we'll never know Santa's story, or what he was doing.  Was he late for a Halloween party?  Was he trying to steal the bike, because he was late for the Halloween party?  Of course, a Santa costume for Halloween was a fabulous idea, for which he deserved kudos.  Then again, maybe he was just your average SF street resident, feeling the holiday spirit well before the season officially began.  Either way, we agreed that this scenario could happen only in San Francisco.  \nAnd as such, it was a great way to end to our meal.", "author": "Sue Z."}

I didn't order an appetizer, but I tried the Caesar salad.  I'm not a huge fan of Caesar salad, but this one was very tasty.  I also ordered the Halibut.  It was good, but it didn't come with anything else, so I suggest getting either an appetizer or side dish.  I also tasted the lamb which was tender and flavorful.  For dessert I tried the souffle and creme brulee.  The souffle was so rich I could only have one bite.  It tasted like cocoa straight off the plant.  The creme brulees came in three mini dishes in different flavors.  Those were delicious.  Great for sharing.  Service was very good and formal.  Friendly staff.

One thing that really made them shine was when they mixed up an order for one of our friends. They managed to take care of it right away, which really showed how important they value customer service. We were definitely not disappointed here. Now for the food:\n\nGolden Lentil Soup: Good soup, nice presentation because they pour the soup on the yogurt and cauliflower at our table. Both the yogurt and cauliflower complemented the soup quite nicely.\n\nBraised Pork Short Ribs - The meat was very tender and juicy, and the risotto was a little too sweet, which was good because the ribs tasted slightly bland on their own. \nPan Seared Wild Steelhead - The fish was good along with the veggies, but nothing really stood out for this dish.\nMushroom Pot Pie - A variety of mushrooms under a tasty puff pastry. Great on a cold day, but I'm not sure I would order this again.\n\nChocolate Toffee Almond Crunch Cake: One of the best desserts I've ever had! I like chocolate, and I like toffee so it was perfect. The pastry chef did a great job with the beautiful presentation, and also with keeping the crunch theme going with the crispy almonds and toffee bits. Even the little chocolate piece over the ice cream had a little crisp to it.\n\nOverall, I would say the dessert stood out the most. The meal was decent, atmosphere is nice, and the waiters make sure you're completely satisfied by the end. But definitely try their desserts!

It's oft-frequented for business lunches and views of the Ferry Building.  I was actually one of the many people who decided to come here for the Dine About Town lunch special on MLK Jr Day.\n\nFood:  4 stars.   I'm always a sucker when it comes to Dine About Town because I'm usually one of those people that strays to the regular menu (isn't that the whole point?), but I resisted temptation this time.  I had the portabello mushroom soup, which was creamy and perfectly seasoned and textured.  The quail egg really didn't do much except make it look prettier.  My friend had the farmer's market salad, which was not very memorable.  For main courses, I went with the Angus tri-tip \"sous vide\" in a green peppercorn sauce.  It was nice and tender and the green peppercorns were not overpowering.  My friend had the grilled mahi mahi with warm herb vinaigrette (they ran out of the grilled Idaho trout), which was decent.  Both entrees came with swiss chard gratin (with herbed panko) and the most excellent buttery mashed potatoes, served separately.  I've always looked forward to desserts here because the presentations have always been intricate.  I was not disappointed by the bosc pear galette with Tahitian vanilla bean ice cream, which also tasted heavenly.  My friend had the chocolate pot de creme verrine withwhipped white chocolate, crunchy steusel, and candied hazelnuts.  It was more boring with the exception of the hazelnuts.  All in all, I ended up making better decisions than my lunch companion on all three courses.  That always makes me happy.\n\nService:  3 stars.   Service seemed subtly snooty, which is a bit tiring (although nowhere near as bad as dealing with people in retail).  \n\nAtmosphere:  3 stars.  Although in a prime location, the restaurant interior looks a little outdated and a bit old-school corporate.  The crowd is an even mix of young and old, but mostly corporate.\n\nHits:  Portabello mushroom soup, Angus tri-tip \"sous vide,\" buttery mashed potatoes, bosc pear galette.\n\nMisses:  Farmer's market salad, chocolate pot de creme.\n\nIf You Like This Place, You'd Probably Like:  Arterra, Boulevard, Manresa", "author": "Keith C."}

The sear on the fish was executed perfectly, the romesco was outstanding, and pairing it with little mandarin oranges worked beautifully. I had really high expectations for One Market and they were met. Service was outstanding without being pretentious, atmosphere was spot on, and most importantly, the food was great. The outrageous prices are almost (almost) warranted (7.50 for Pellegrino water, 11 for soup, 25+ for mains). All in all; great food, great service, great atmosphere.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-11-22", "description": "Ah yes, One Market.  It's a nicer place for business luncheons, sure.  At this point it's not a place I would choose to go for anything more than drinks and chickpea fries.  Sad, but true.  I've had lunch here several times, for business mostly, a couple times just because, and once for SF's Dine About Town.\n\nOne Market sadly disappoints me.  I want to love it, but I simply do not.  I suppose that is why I've given them chance after chance after chance, with no luck.  I still feel disappointed when I leave, and that isn't what I should be feeling when I leave such an establishment.  The space is beautiful, and full of grandeur, but that is about it.  For instance, my experience a while back for Dine About Town was a three course lunch midweek.  We had an 11:30 reservation.  Got there a couple minutes early, and was seated promptly at 11:30.  We were one of the first tables seated for their lunch service, and placed our order quickly.  We received bread, and a delicious iced tea infused with peach and served alongside a peach puree for extra sweetening.  The first course came out quickly, the spring mixed green salad.  It was fresh and perfectly dressed, we enjoyed this quite a bit... then we waited for our second course... we waited... we waited... we waited... by this time 45 minutes had passed since we placed our order.  Our second course arrived finally at 12:20, and I mentioned to our waiter, please add two orders of chick pea fries to go to have ready at the end of the meal, please place the order now as we're on a time crunch.  He made a snarky remark, \"Well this IS a three course meal you know, it takes time.  You should really mention these things when you place your order.\"  I realize a three course meal takes a little time, but we had waited over 25 minutes after we finished our first course, with no second course in sight.  This, for lunch in the Financial District is a bit excessive, three course meal or otherwise.  I admit, I should have mentioned our time limitations in the beginning since we had meetings to get to.  I just didn't appreciate the snarkiness of our waiter, and I typically don't mind brash sarcasm, and a little attitude since I tend to be a snarky sarcastic being myself, but this was ridiculous.  All in all, the food was fine.  Nothing was outstanding, nor memorable.  \n\nThis was me giving them another chance because I had thought my prior experiences were just flukes.  I must say, this isn't a fluke, and I wont be returning unless it is for business and someone else is paying, or drinks and apps in the bar area.  I should mention my prior lunch experience here about 10 months ago.  They tried to serve me a raw grilled chicken sandwich... twice.  And explained it away by telling me the sandwich was made of dark meat.  Um, I love dark meat, but I do not love raw dark meat chicken.  I don't know any restaurant that serves up raw chicken... and twice... they seared my meat again from the original sandwich and placed it on the same bread I sent it back on.  (I had cut my sandwich in half and that is when I noticed it was raw)  That said, I sent it back, it came back raw still and on the bread I had cut in half with all the raw chicken juices still on it.  CAN WE SAY SALMONELLA???  The floor manager came by and gave me the dark meat excuse then offered me a different sandwich.  Then she explained to me the tuna sandwich is seared, so it will arrive raw.  HELLO!!!  Tuna can be served seared and raw in the middle, I love raw tuna, sashimi, etc.  I DO NOT like raw chicken, and don't know anyone who does.  Food poisoning people, food poisoning... hasn't any of the staff heard of what happens when you eat raw chicken???  Anyway.  As I said before, I will likely return for business as so many people like to go there for meetings, etc.  This will never be my first choice with so many other great options around.  Although, there's a good possibility I will be back for their delicious martinis and chick pea fries... but that's it.  2 stars for the consistently disappointing dining experience and food, 4 stars for the bar area and chick pea fries.

Alrighty.. so I ended up eating at One Market twice in one day - once for a client lunch then again that night for dinner with friends - i think I got my fill of this place for a good few months!   I had a good experience for lunch and dinner:\n\nlunch:  ordered this interesting mango ice tea drink - nice presentation and very light with a hint of fresh mango juice.    I ordered the beet salad - nicely presented with very thin slices of beets and a citrus/lemon dressing.  The rock shrimp in the salad had a nice citrus flavor as well.   A few beets were not as fresh as others, but overall it was a strong dish.  For my lunch entree I ordered the lobster and crab cavatelli (pasta dish that looks a little like mini larvae -- not the most appetizing comparison - but visually that's basically what this pasta looks like).   This dish was good - had enough lobster/crab and had a light cream sauce although could have been a bit saltier for my taste buds.    \n\nOnto dinner... I had the dine-about-town set meal with the lentil soup, mushroom pot pie and mint ice cream sandwich.   5 stars for all of these dishes.   Lentil soup had a nice presentation where the waiters pour in the broth with the cauliflower and vadouvan sitting in the empty bowl beforehand.   This wasn't the lentil soup I was expecting - but it was a good surprise - creamy but not too rich and the yogurt/cauliflower gave the soup a nice twist.   My mushroom pot pie was absolutely delicious.   I love mushrooms so this entree hit the spot..  the mushroom filling tasted unhealthy - which = great.   the baked crust was light and fluffy and they have a nice presentation of showing you the pot pie prior to scooping it out from the baking dish into a white bowl/plate.   To top off the meal, I ordered the mint chocolate chip ice cream cookie.... personally i think diddy reese in brentwood tops the cake as far as ice cream sandwiches.. but for a fancy venue i think this is a close second.   \n\nI wouldn't go to One Market regularly as it would burn a whole in my wallet but for nice occasions and for the deal of dine-about-town, this is is a good spot.", "author": "T M."}

First, the soup was a few tablespoons of creamy liquid with these horrifying bites of coagulated bacon fat, the skate wing was dry, overcooked, and coated with an allegedly high-end sauce that tasted like Wendy's honey mustard dipping sauce.  Worst of all, is that the skate (which my friend and I ordered) came naked on the plate, without the spinach and mashed potatoes that came with Michelle H's meal.  C'mon now, you guys think you could get away with giving some patrons less?

You ain't escaping Coach K. \n\nI went to One Market this past Friday with my GF and another couple. Our entire experience here was actually quite nice. Great service, attractive ambiance, and even better company. The four diners in attendance all ended up getting fairly intoxicated by the end of the meal (two cocktails each, two bottles of wine, and Irish coffee's to finish have a tendency of making this happen). In the midst of our debauchery a meal was also served. The black bean soup to start might as well of been called black bean paste - the texture was disgusting, and room temperature I might add.

Our bills usually come to the upper 100s, but we're OK with that, just as long as it's worth it.  One Market is DEFINITELY worth it.  The only \"bad\" thing I can say about this place is that the directions they give you force you to make a U at the corner of Market and Steuart to valet.  Not a tough job, unless you have a trolley coming at you.\n\nNow on to the restaurant.  They're part of OpenTable (bonus points), so getting a reservation isn't hard.  We arrived 15 min. early and were quite content with having a drink at the bar (happy hour goes until 7pm), but the hostess was very pleasant and infomed us that our table would be ready in just a minute.  We had a lovely corner table, on the raised portion of the floor, that faced the open kitchen and the chef's table.  We were seated at 6:20pm and the sunlight was not in my eyes.  We had a great view of the restaurant (which filled up in a matter of minutes), the Ferry Building, and the kitchen.  Then our server approached.\n\nUpon request he promptly brought us a cocktail menu and gave us the right amount of time to decide.  He was attentive, without being overbearing.  He recommended a couple of things on their standard menu, but we were more focused on their daily grill option - the prime rib.  We started with cocktails and an amuse bouch, compliments of the chef.  The appy was a calamari ceviche and it was fantabulous.  Give me a bowl of that and some tortilla chips, and I'm in heaven.  We had ordered the dungeness crab risotto to share and they split it for us.  There was a nice lump of crab in the middle of the risotto, with bits of crab throughout.  The risotto was a nice tomato based one, quite a nice change from your standard.  This was followed with 2 oysters, again, compliments of the chef.  The oysters were raw, topped with a warm buttery, creamy sauce which warmed it through just a tad.  It was then topped with caviar and chives.  The raw hama hama's I had were better.  Then the prime rib arrived.\n\nI've had my fair share of prime rib, and I have to give this one a standing ovation.  It was a perfect medium rare with a lovely sprinkling of sea salt right on top.  Normally I don't eat the crusty outside because it's usually burnt, but I ate every last piece of this one.  My friend is notorious for salt and peppering everything, but this is the one and only time that I didn't see her adjust the taste.  That's a clear sign of perfection if ever there was one.  The meat is ala carte, so we had the buttered mashed potatos and swiss chard gratin.  Both very well done.  And to end the meal, we each had the mini butterscotch pudding.  It was the perfect ending to a perfect meal.  \n\nNext time we're coming for happy hour and eating in the bar/lounge.  When we were sitting, we saw a tasty burger go by us.  It was destined for the bar, so that makes the bar our next destination.", "author": "Alison N."}

Rather than upsell us on ordering too much food, he told us how large the portions were and that we could easily split and start with one entree and order more later if we wanted.  I always like that being most nice restaurants try to get you to order more for a bigger bill when really the portions are huge... and they were pretty big!

The food was excellent (golden lentil soup, pumpkin ravioli and a dessert trio). The dessert trio was especially amazing since they advertise it as a trio of mini desserts for $15 (as opposed to a regular dessert in the $10 range). When it arrived, it was actually a trio of not-so-mini desserts (creme brulee, chocolate cake and something else I've forgotten because of a sugar overdose) but wow! \n\nThe service, wow from a different perspective. They were obviously pretty rushed when we got there but we were seated right away and our order taken. One of my co-workers had to get back fast, so ordered only one dish while the rest of us ordered the Dine-About Town (or equivalents). Bread was great, nice and hot, and went like a flash. Then since the appetizers seemed to be taking some time, tried to catch the eye of the waiter to replenish the bread. No luck. After 5 minutes of signaling, a waiter went off to get the bread and never came back. Instead, my soup arrived. And sat and sat in front of me getting cold while to be polite, I heroically refrained from eating because no one else had been served. After 5 minutes, the waitress rushes back (still no bread) and says that I had accidentally been served someone else's soup and would I like her to take it away and bring it back? I kind of shrugged and she said the remaining items would be arriving soon. And so I finished my soup while my companions looked on. Then the others' menu items arrived and they ate while I looked on. Then my main course arrived and I ate while they looked on, then ...\n\nAnd they were out of two desserts which is why I ordered the trio and then we all went back on a sugar high and fell asleep during a crucial meeting, forcing our company to go bankrupt - but fortunately the government gave us a bailout.", "author": "Rags R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-12-27", "description": "What a disappointment! I booked a reservation for five at the last minute on a Friday evening a couple of weeks before Christmas. To be honest, I choose this restaurant because it was one of the only reservations I could get on short notice and because it has a Michelin star. Granted I've only eaten here once, but after my experience at One Market I'd have to say that this Michelin rating is undeserved. \n\nI don't have much to say about the food. I had the cauliflower soup, a selection of oysters and the black cod. All were fine but unremarkable.\n\nThe real downfall of the restaurant on the evening we were there was the service. When we arrived the hostess seemed harried and indifferent. No one offered to check our coats and we were told that our table wasn't ready yet without apology and without being directed to the bar or anything like that. We got the feeling that the hostess would have been happier if we had waited outside on the sidewalk.  Once we were seated (15 minutes after our reservation time) our waiter seemed overwhelmed and unfamiliar with the menu and wine list. We ordered wine only to be informed 10 minutes later that they were out of it. These things happen, but our waiter was completely without suggestions for what might make a good substitute. Also, an order of 20 oysters for the table was completely forgotten despite the fact that our waiter appeared to have written everything down. When we reminded the waiter about the oysters he seemed more frustrated than anything. He also seemed to want to just forget about the order rather than delay the arrival of the entrees so that we could have the oysters.  Another thing that surprised me about the service was the way that that the food was sort of thrown at us. The restaurant was very busy, so maybe everyone was frazzled, but when wine was poured it was sloshed, each of our entrees and starters came at different times and the service was just in general totally uncoordinated and sloppy.", "author": "Lily T."}

Fava beans require multiple steps to prepare - shelling, blanching, removing each bean's individual membrane - adding up to a labor intensive process that I often chose to forgo. If someone else does the aforementioned prerequisites, blitzes the beans in a food processor, and smears the paste on toasted bread with pork fat, I am all for it. Not long after the server removed my canap\u00e9 plate, another server came by with two kinds of bread - olive and baguette - accompanied by what can only be described as an impenetrable ingot once known as butter. Seriously, I did know whether I would need welding tools to get the butter on the bread. I consoled myself, attempting to deludedly justify the peccadillo with the thought that a meal without butter could possibly be salubrious. Ah, who am I kidding?\n\nFirst course: Asparagus soup, pastured egg sous vide, parmesan, prosciutto. Not only was the soup's seasoning spot on, but it was also visually pleasing as the runny yolk elided with the pur\u00e9ed asparagus.\n\nSecond course: Braised halibut cheeks, micro greens, corn, clams, celery, applewood smoked bacon. After watching Mario Batali serve opah cheeks on Iron Chef America, I, too, thought fish cheeks would make for a tasty entr\u00e9e. Do not let the halibut's eerily unattractive features fool you, for its cheeks are delicate enough to render a knife obsolete. I thought the progression from unsmoked pork belly in the soup to smoked belly meat for the main course was a clever - albeit probably overlooked by most - touch.\n\nThird course: Nectarine tart, blackberry compote, vanilla bean ice cream. This dessert had a great harmony between its tart and sweet notes.  \n\nTonight was my third meal at One Market, and each time I have come away satisfied.", "author": "Andrew F."}

The Popcorn Shrimp and Calamari are the typical finger food and they don't usually go wrong... there was an appetizer that was not very tasty but I have no idea what it was... all I can say is it looked like a mozzarella stick but it didn't taste anything close to it.... stay away from whatever it might be!!!  Service was good...as busy as it was... we got our drinks quite quickly and the server checked on us regularly.", "author": "Susie L."}

The food was yummy (short-ribs are fantastic). I looked around at the end of dinner and there was hardly a crumb left on a plate. They gave us excellent service. The best thing about the event was that Beth, the lead for group events, was EXTREMELY flexible. She worked hard to give us options that stayed within our budget and made sure that all of the little details were taken care of in advance. At the end of the night, several people said that they would like to use them for future private events for work. Well done One Market!", "author": "Nessa F."}

We sent it back and replaced it with an acceptable salad. After we signaled for the waiter to order a bottle of wine he returned shortly to tell us that bottle was not in stock. So we chose another bottle and was immediately told it was also not in stock. The sommelier/ wine peddler was signaled by the waiter got quite pushy in our decision process, so we thanked her and sent her on her way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-08-31", "description": "I've eaten in many starred Michelin restaurants around the world, and I must say I am shocked this restaurant got one.  It is more closely a one or two 'knife and fork' rating.  Let me describe.\n\nThe Bar - The waitress in the bar was nice.  The drinks were good and not overly expensive.  The pianist, \"Billy Philadelphia\", dutifully banged away at various trite bar tunes to make conversation impossible.  I thought of tipping him $20 for a piece of silence.  Later during dinner, I actually heard him playing the theme from Charlie Brown.  ACK!\n\nThe Dining room - We were seated an oddly deep booth type table.  This is odd because one expects very nice service in a Michelin one-star.  However, the deep table required us to (a) assist in the busing of our dishs; (b) have arms thrust in front of our faces; (c) move items around the table so that plates could be served.  Sigh.  It was loud.  Not a reserved Michelin Star here.\n\nThe Food - The food was okay.  I have never said 'okay' in reference to a starred restaurant before.  The amuse bouche, which wasn't referred to as such, was a small dollop of duck liver mousse on top of a small round of toast.  The four servings were unceremoniously sitting on a small plate that was plopped toward the end of the table (remember the deep booth?).  It was okay.  \nThe \"hand-picked dungeness crab salad\" was good, though the crab was almost frozen and the \"polenta flan\" didn't taste like very much at all.  It was $15.  And what is hand-picked?  What else would one use?  A foot?\nThe Gulf Shrimp salad as about $14.  It had three smallish shrimp propped on a bed of shredded cucumber with some tasty sauce dribbled around.  It was pretty good, but there is no way those small shrimp were worth $5 each.\nThe guinea hen was very good, though the corn served with it was a bit salty.  The lamb chops were very good but were plated with all the imagination of a truck-stop diner:  White plate, two chops, some dark sauce underneath.  The fish cooked sous vide (such a trend) was served more or less room temperature.  Not impressive.\n\nThe Service - The server was nice, but I had to wonder if she just started working there when we arrived.  When we asked what type of oysters they had, she had to flip through a notepad to find out and then came back and said they were out of one.  The food came out at a slightly rapid pace and as one bottle of wine emptied, we were not asked if we wished to order another.  After asking twice for the wine list, I got it.  I asked about a wine and the server did not know so said that she would go ask the sommelier.  UM.  Since when does a sommelier not come to the table?  The server returned and said the sommelier thought we might like a particular wine (about $80).  I said ok.  The main courses came.  We ate.  Then the wine arrived 25 minutes later, carried by some man in a suit we had never seen.  We said we no longer wanted it as we were finished eating.  He said ok and walked off.  We were going to order a glass of wine instead, but it took another 15 minutes to even get the list of wines by the glass.  \nThey comped us dessert, but oh well.  The mini ice cream sandwich was good, but lacked all presentation.  The 'ice cream sundae' was about as boring as one could make it.  The ice cream was supposed to be cocoa nib, but was clearly coffee.  the brownie on the bottom wasn't the nice cake-like fudgy sort you'd love under ice cream, but a dense, compact, sugary brick.  The caramel sauce (served separately) had nothing in common with caramel except it was sort of the same color.  the whole almonds just sat in a small bowl (almonds? on a sundae???).  The fudge sauce was ok.\n\nOVERALL -  There is no way this restaurant meets the standards of a Michelin star.  The food is passable and at times good, but nothing worth remembering.  The prices are not bad, but then again, the food and service aren't that good.  The atmosphere is sort of like \"bistro-plunked-in-a-touristy-business-district\".  Oh. And in the ultimate provincial statement, they \"close\" at 9pm (yes even on friday and saturday).  (Unlike some SF restaurants, they do not throw you out then, they just stop seating then.)

If he smiled a few more times, the experience would've been nicer. He did comp a few dishes after we asked a few times when we would get it. Thank goodness we weren't in a rush to go anywhere.\nThe food was a bit overpriced, but somewhat typical of SF restaurants like this one. Most of the proportions of the dishes were small..except for the main dish. For 5 gals, we shared 4 appetizers, 3 main dishes, 2 sides, and 3 desserts. We were pretty stuffed by the end of the evening though. The appetizers were all really delicious, except for the foie gras. The way they made the foie gras just made it taste like pate, so why spend so much on something that doesn't taste like what i really is? The crab risotto and the crab and pear salad were good. The glazed wild shrimp was tasty but it only came with 3 shrimps. The Colorado lamb was real tasty, but not if you don't like the \"gamey\" taste of lamb. The seabass was absolutely succulent, with all the flavors that were added to it!! That's a definite \"RECOMMEND.\" As for dessert..how can you go wrong?

Last time I was here was about a year ago and tonite the decor and ambience seem to be different somehow.  Not sure if they changed anything but the place seemed more warm and inviting...maybe due to the \"amber\" lighting.  Well, after enjoying my \"$12 martini!\" at the bar we were seated about 15 mins delayed of our reservation time.  We were seated at a booth near the open kitchen which is always nice cause I like watching the chefs at work.  \n\nI started with the beet carpaccio with marinated rock shrimp, radish sprouts, and crispy ginger pieces.  The appetizer was refreshing and light...good as a summer starter.  My entree was the liberty duck breast with trumpet mushroom.  The duck breast was juicy and tender.  The au jus reduction was sweet and tangy and the wilted swiss chard was not overcooked w/ a bit of crunchiness in them.  A decent duck breast entree.  For dessert I had the d'anjou pear galette.  I was a little disappointed with the puff pastry.  I LOVE puff pastry dessert.  Allow me to be tangential here...I love bread pudding and the best bread pudding ever that I've had was from the XYZ restauant from the W hotel in SF.  Unlike typical bread pudding, this one was made from croissant rather than \"bread.\"  It was light, fluffy, buttery, and oh so good!  Anyways, getting back to my pear galette, I was disappointed at the rather \"flat\" and \"unpuffed\" pastry of the galette.  The pear was also so-so.  \n\nThis restaurant as one would expect, has a pretty extensive wine list, but unfortunately my dinner companion doesn't drink (a true sin!) so I ordered from the dreaded \"by the glass\" list.  The syrah I chose to go with my duck breast was an '05 Kinton Syrah which had a nice earthy tone w/ blackberry notes and a hint of pepperiness which went nicely with the duck breast.  A bit young but mellow with good fruit.\n\nFood-wise I'd say a 3.5 but I'm easily swayed by ambience and there was something different this time that was warm and inviting so I rounded it to a 4.", "author": "Rick P."}

Not a good start.\n2. The Muscovy Duck Salad.  A step up from the first course but our waitress gave us a white \"pinot noir\".  I think the waitress was new or a \"trainee\" and didn't realize she was describing a red wine while giving us a white one.  I think she was confused but we didn't say anything as she already felt bad about our telling her our disappointment with the sweet terrine.\n3. Muscovy Duck Leg Ravioli.  A little better than the first 2 dishes.  The duck leg was a bit overcooked but overall tasty.  The problem came from the fact we got our food before our wine pairing which was a bit annoying as they are meant to be eaten together.\n4. Roasted Muscovy Duck Breast.  Duck was cooked perfectly.  Very good.\n5. Duck Egg Creme Brulee.  Very good.  The best part of the meal.

They have a separate bar area but its pretty small and usually crammed with after work happy hour foiks.  But the restaurant is very large and usually has seating available.

She not only described the food in long, painful detail, but described everything as if she was working on commission.  It was as if she had to make it sound out-of-this-world or no one would eat there.  \n\nI looked at the appetizers.  I noticed the smoked trout with an organic egg.  I thought that sounded pretty weird and unimaginative.  But sometimes those end up being the best dishes.  The waitress of course would not shut up about how everyone is talking about this smoked trout appetizer and how it is such a hit.  I considered the fresh crab with celery sorbet as well, but went with the trout.  I was less than thrilled when my plate arrived.  The appetizer was basically a giant hash brown with a thick piece of smoked trout on top, and a poached egg on top of the trout.  Small pieces of bacon or pancetta were scattered around the edge of the plate.  The smoked trout was fishy-tasting.  The whole thing made me feel like I was at IHOP.  It was awful.  My client ordered the crab appetizer.  After looking at it, I realized it looked pretty disgusting as well.  It looked like a lump of crab meat on one side of the plate and a small scoop of celery sorbet on the other side.  Pretty gross if you ask me.\n\nMy main course was pretty bad too.  I got the duck ravioli.  It was very salty.  You would never know that the ravioli was stuffed with duck meat.  Duck has a distinctive flavor, and I did not taste a trace of it in the ravioli.  To make things worse, the ravioli seemed to be drowning in butter.  The whole meal made me want to vomit afterwards.  All that grease and heaviness...yuck.

When we got to the restaurant and i browsed the menu, so many different things popped out at me. I wanted it all! I was deciding between the halibut, the lamb shanks, scallops, and the ravioli. In the end i went with the scallops. I LOVED them! They were so delicious! It came with a lemongrass sauce, along with veggies (different types of squash). Very good dish! For appetizers we had raw oysters, which were also very good because they were fresh. The waiter said they get them fresh daily, good to know when eating raw oysters =) We also got complementary tasting of ahi tuna, which was great! Every dish the others in my party had were great! (Lamb shanks, new york steak, blacked cod, halibut, pork tenderloin, and the duck) The perks of going in such a large group was that I got to taste a little bit of everything! I would have to say everything on the menu is good, you can't go wrong. For dessert we had chocolate souffle, and a mini platter with cheesecake, chocolate cream pie, and 2 different creme brulees.

I'm always drawn to the menu with the question, \"That's interesting, I wonder what that will taste like?\" and end up saying, \"That's not at all what I was hoping for.\" Certainly not bad and I would never turn down a free meal here, but not worth my own money (in my opinion). The best part about this place is the happy hour, fantastic deals for top shelf drinks that are well made.", "author": "jess c."}

It had a sophisticated ambiance fit for it's address One Market, and located in the heart of the financial district.

(And we've dined at some amazing places.)  We walked in with no reservation and were seated without any attitude or issue.  We didn't plan to have a big meal, we were really craving oysters.  But when we looked at the menu and spoke with our friendly and knowledgeable waiter, we decided to try the tasting menu.  Each course was a beautiful little symphony of flavors.  The halibut melted in my mouth, the duck breast was tender and juicy (vanilla potatoes on the plate!!), our desserts were divine.  And for the month of July ALL wines on the wine list are 50% off, so we tried a bottle of wine we probably wouldn't have had otherwise.  \n\nOur server was terrific.  We had a tight shedule (babysitter), so we gave him the time we needed to walk out the door.  He made sure the courses came quickly enough to fit our schedule and attended to our every need.  \n\nLast night my husband and I dined at Gordon Ramsay at the London Hotel in West Hollywood.  The food was good, but we left talking about our amazing meal at One Market.", "author": "Bonita H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-25", "description": "We ordered the six course tasting menu and were pleased with the food.  A couple of flaws didn't mar a very enjoyable evening.\n\nDue to incredibly fortuitous transportation alignments and the easy to get to location, we arrived at the restaurant almost a half hour early.  The hostess was courteous and was able to seat us with only a minute delay.\n\nWarm bread appeared almost immediately and the waiter started explaining the menu right away.  We ordered the six course tasting menu after some discussion with my dining companion, a beloved aunt, and the first person from my family to visit me here in San Francisco.\n\nI am not a wine connoisseur, but the wine recommended to accompany the first courses of our meal was a bit sweet for my taste.  Sadly, I cannot remember what was I ordered.  (Bad reviewer, bad!)\n\nWe started out with an oyster which made my aunt say, \"oh this is good.  I think this is the best oyster I've ever had.\" She went on to explain how that might not mean much, but I had to agree that I enjoyed it.\n\nUp next was the crab salad, and it was my favorite of the evening.  Oh, try to imagine the apples and celery root that are going to die a horrible death as I try to replicate something half as good in my own kitchen.  I work near here and I can see myself darting in here at lunch to sit at the bar and savor my crab salad before heading back to the office.  My aunt exclaimed, \"Oh, this is REALLY good.\"\n\nFollowing that was the lightly smoked trout.  This was an interesting dish.  The light smokey taste was subtle and delicious.  But when paired with the pancetta vinaigrette became bolder and tasty in a different way.\n\nThe rabbit meatballs and ravioli were good, and I really liked the broth that accompanied them.  \n\nAfter tasting the scallops, \"bland, \" described my culinarily un-adventuresome aunt, \"the chef should have done something better with these.\"  Tough, I thought.  In another setting they would have been unremarkable, but next to the other dishes in the menu, they stood out and not in a good way.\n\nI eyed the small green nub at the top of my roasted carrot.  Should I cut that off, I thought?  But, the carrot was so small.  I popped the whole thing in my mouth and was punished with grit.  Why put something on my plate, something so bite sized and inviting, if I cannot eat it?  Why does this keep happening to me?\n\nBy the time the lamb arrived, we were both near sated.  Still, I ate the lamb from my aunt's plate with permission.  The loin atop this dish catches the eye, but underneath is the visually less appealing but more interesting tasting braised shoulder with cocoa.\n\nThe best part of the pear galette were the same tangy huckleberries from the lamb course and the pears.  The puff pastry was not as good as other parts of the meal.\n\nTallying up the courses here, I now realize that we were promised a sea bream course in the description of the tasting menu that never arrived.  Hmmm.\n\nThe waiter explained the dishes fully, although he seemed to struggle to remember everything and had to resort to a crib sheet at times.  I was rooting for him.  It was a bit difficult to understand him due to his accent and the noise in the restaurant.  A couple courses arrived a bit closer together than I would like, and another just a bit too long.  Otherwise, the service was good throughout the meal. \n\nThe price was $120 per person.  Too much?  Maybe.  I didn't go there looking for a bargain.  Would I go back?  Yeah.  I am very curious to try the vegetarian tasting menu.  But, I would order that with a crab salad starter.", "author": "Jeff M."}

My three dining companions all got the portobella mushroom soup which sounded great on paper but did not present in person.  I tried it, and there was minimal flavor and had an odd consistency.

So when he brought out the raw bloody piece of meat, I immediately requested that the steak be sent back.  The hostess, or maybe she was the manager gave me one of her infamous scowls and made a smart ass comment.  Like it was my fault.  My friend's dish was also forgettable.

But when our party grew over 30, we had to search elsewhere for a place that would be willing to fit 40 people and serve a vegetarian only private menu. We ate out for 2 weeks straight to find the right place. Absinthe had a great private room but was unwilling to do an all vegetarian menu, Fifth Floor was one of our favorites but couldn't fit 40 people, Campton Place had an excellent Chef who was willing to custom made dishes for us but was out of our price range. \n\nOne Market turned out to be just perfect in every way. I did not consider it at first because I used to work in that building and thought of it as a corporate restaurant and the photos of the private rooms did not impress me too much. But when I stopped by to check out the rooms, we met Michael, the General Manager who could not be friendlier. The rooms also have a very soft lighting with a nice glow which did not come through the photos. We decided to schedule a tasting and Chef Mark went out of his way to let us sample all kinds of custom vegetarian dishes. We ended up going with the Yukon Gold Potato Soup, Heirloom Tomato Salad, Wild Mushroom Risotto, and Valrhona Manjari Souffle Cake. Everyone loved the food here including all of our non-vegetarian guests. My aunt didn't even realize we had an all vegetarian menu until I told her the next day.  They also took extra care of my sister in-law who is deathly allergic to nuts. But what impressed us the most about this place is its unparalleled service. Beth and Rita were both extremely accommodating and went above and beyond to help us out. We booked this place only 5 days before the event and with such short notice, they were able to help us tie all the loose ends. My aunt brought a bunch of random stuff that she wanted to be displayed (pebbles, lights, frames, etc) and they set it up beautifully. They also gave us extra candles and setup small reception area that turned out perfect for the event. \n\nMy only suggestion is to ask for larger portions. For four courses it was just enough for me but for my husband and brother, they got hungry a few hours later. I guess vegetarian food might not be as filling as some of their other dishes.", "author": "Ester C."}

The menu items change periodically, but everything I tried has been really good.  It's good that I'm dining on the company's tab because being the cheap person I am, I would never go there for lunch otherwise.  I really liked the fresh vegetable garden salad, which had blanched carrots (red, organge, and yellow) and asparagus, topped with a tangy vinagrette dressing.  I've also tried the mahi mahi and another grilled fish dish, as well as the crab cakes -- all great flavors.  The crab cakes were really good, except for the cilantro.  I hate cilantro!  Why must people use it like it's going out of style?  Others enjoyed their gigantic burger and skin-on fries.   The rolls and butter were tasty...maybe too tasty because I couldn't stop eating them.  The best part was the dessert and since we go in large groups, we shared.  I tried the rhubarb pie (which was a first for me) and that was very good and I also had the lemon vanilla bean cheesecake which was probably the best lemon dessert I've ever had.  Others enjoyed the creme brulee, but I didn't get to it.  The white wine was excellent and the servers were friendly and very knowledgeable.  They also have this thing called the Chef's Table where for $85/person, you and 3-4 of your friends can go to a bar next to the kitchen and watch the chefs prepare a tasting menu, and where everyone also puts on cooking attire and assists in preparing the dish.  The price is a bit expensive for me, but I do want to try it one day.  Any takers?", "author": "LaSha G."}

However, I have had lunch here a few times and been to several happy hours as well.  As far as the food goes... pretty much everything I've had is decent, without being memorable.  I typically get the burger, which is always prepared right.  The big fries are a great accompaniment.  The Caesar salad is pretty good too.  I also like the fact that they have a good selection of non-alcoholic drinks, including a variety of lemonades... which are a nice option during work hours.   The service is usually pretty decent, but sometimes a little on the slow side.  I sat at the Chef's Table once for lunch and was not impressed.  The table was very pretty uncomfortable and not especially nice.  I definitely wouldn't intentionally try to eat there.  The happy hour is a pretty good deal and worth checking out if you're in the area.  However, it's frequently super-packed and waitress service takes forever so I'd recommend going to the bar to get drinks.  Certain apps like the crab cakes and satays are decent, but I avoid the sweetish buffalo wings like the plague.  They're pretty much inedible.", "author": "Saw T."}

Here's the super-condensed version of my review: Fabulous food, almost perfect atmosphere but service needs improvement.\n\nI went to One Market with my boyfriend two Fridays ago on the last night of the Open Table Appetite Stimulus Plan. Yes, it was crowded, but the service simply wasn't up to fine dining standards. First, we could hardly get the attention of anyone at the host station when we arrived. Then the hostess herself seemed irritated that we'd had the nerve to show up at her restaurant wanting service and food. She was unfriendly and unhelpful to the point of being unprofessional. Then the got our reservation wrong. I made a 7:15 reservation on Open Table but they'd had us down for 7 pm and, as we had arrived at approximately 7:18, they had evidently JUST given our table away when we arrived. I refrained from showing her the email confirmation I had in my BlackBerry saying 7:15, as I didn't see it getting our table any sooner. Once seated at our table, thankfully, our waiter was pretty attentive and friendly enough. But the little details that make it a fine dining experience weren't there: wiping up the crumbs between dishes, knowing exactly when to take away your dishes (we'd had our dessert about 5 minutes and it was mostly still on the plate when some overzealous busboy came around to take it away). Plus there was a little plastic tent on the table about buying gingerbread cookies for some charity -- not something I want to see while I'm having a nice dinner out.\n\nHowever, the food was really excellent and the restaurant is beautiful, so I'm giving it 4 stars. I might go there again, but I'm more likely to take my dollars to Foreign Cinema or Boulevard, where I can count on service to match the prices.", "author": "Allison B."}

They were delightful!  The manager, Michael, gave us such special attention that we felt like royalty for the night, including a full tour of their amazing kitchen.  I have no problem with spending this kind of money (and it did add up... to around $150/ person... but only with much wine and a above average tip) if it feels like a true experience.  Too many restaurants in this town leave you with the \"well, for $500, frankly, it SHOULD be amazing\" feeling.  One Market truly felt like an \"event\" more than a dinner, and for that I gave them all five of the little red stars.  Food wise... good.  Above average.  I'm a little tired of the French/ California thing, but I've been eating out too much, so that's not their fault.  If I never see another huckleberry sauce, sunchoke, or pork belly that will be just fine, let's put it that way!  But it was good.  And the wines were great.  Really, it was the service that set them apart for me- there's so much good food in SF that service is often the deciding factor.  So, thanks Michael!  Good job, FOH staff!", "author": "Jennifer P."}

I thought that was rather shocking for a chain restaurant, but decided to see for myself. Having tried many Michelin rated restaurants and foodie, I consider myself to have a palate that is up to par. This restaurant was a disgrace, i might as well have gone to Olive Garden or some other chain. Heck, Olive Garden is even better than this shameful establishment. I have been to their other restaurants that belong to this group and they are 10x better than this. I would love to know who is in charge of the Michelin rating group this year, as I imagine it must be a baboon or someone that was bribed easily. Don't ever spend your money here, unless you want uncooked beans and tasteless fish. If you enjoy this place, I have to admit........I feel sorry for you!", "author": "ana m."}

I had been to One Market once several years ago and had a memorably unpleasant encounter with a soft-shelled crab, but it was certainly worth a re-visit.  The menu for DAT was great--they had many tempting choices available.  I had the ceasar salad, which was rich and pungent, but in a decadent way.  Then I had the scallops with pureed potatoes and mushrooms which I thought was heavenly, but another diner complained was too rich.  Assess your tolerance for rich food, if you're a light eater you may be overwhelmed.  If you, like me, think the flavor's in the fat, you will be a happy camper here.  For dessert we had the beignets with white hot chocolate.  The beignets were awesome, but the white hot chocolate had cooled off and was only good for a few spoonfuls.  That was fine with me, though, because after all the preceeding food I needed to take it easy with dessert. It was a great meal and a great vlaue, and I know we'll be back for more after DAT.", "author": "Eleanor E."}

I like this place b/c they have great cocktails and big glasses of wine. The only downside is if you have to stand... not a lot of room at the bar, so it can be awkward. Also, come with a friend or group... people don't seem to mingle here.\n\nRestaurant: 4.5 stars (Dine About Town)\nI went here last Wed. with two friends... We first ordered the House-Made Duck Ravioli (not on the Dine About Town menu). This was amazing! There was just the right amount of duck in the ravioli, and the foie gras emulsion was a perfect match. We then got the Caesar Salad for our first dish. Great dressing, just too bad they drenched the lettuce in it. Also, the salad was too big, so by the time we got to our main course of the amazingly tasting Seared Day Boat Scallops, we each left one on our plates. For dessert I got the Pear Brown Butter Tart (although, more like a puff pastry than a tart) with vanilla bean ice cream and my friends got these chocolate fritters with a cup of what seemed like hot chocolate w/ Jager. Both were amazing. So overall, great food. Just need work on the salad. Our server said it was his second night, but we never would have guessed. Great service. The ambiance was great and noise level good, although we got to sit in a booth on the upper level. Not sure if I'd like a table in the middle of the main floor.", "author": "Sarah K."}
