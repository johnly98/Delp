The unique set up makes it perfect for working, chatting with friends or even just relaxing by yourself.\n\nThe great vibes make it such a shame that the food did not live up to my expectations. The waffle was nice enough but, when compared to places like Pain, it must be considered mediocre. The cookie skirted the line of bearable with its flavour and sugar on top. \n\nAs for the service, you had to go up to a till to order and I appreciate the set up but my coffee and waffle took too long in comparison to those in England. \n\nOverall, I went to this place for vibes and got exactly that but the food was disappointing.

Nestled inside the lobby of a classic office building in downtown San Francisco, this modern bar looks almost as great as their coffee drinks. Access is though the lobby without a dedicated entrance with only street parking available. \n\nMy Sunday morning visit was packed with Outside Lands visitors trying to catch a morning buzz. There were a few morning runners and maybe a few bringing a drink back to their Saturday night guest! This location has a pretty full menu including a wonderful reserve Rwandan espresso which was amazing on a cool and sunny morning. \n\nGourmet coffee is a wonderful treat, and the Blue Bottle on Sansome is a wonderful way to experience it.

I came here on a Wednesday afternoon with a friend after lunch to grab a cup of joe before heading back to our offices for work. It's a nice and simple cafe with a small selection of brews and some seating inside. They also sell coffee grinds, snacks, merch and what not too. I just have to say that finding the entrance was a bit of a struggle though since there isn't a direct entrance into the cafe, but instead, one must enter the highrise it is connected to to enter the cafe. At around 1pm in the afternoon, there was only about a 5 min wait to the cashier which was nice.\n\nAfter quite a bit of deliberations, I decided to go simple and get their hot caffe latte. It felt a bit pricy for the size, but it was definitely a nice cup of latte that was neither too acidic nor bitter. I also got to try out a sip of their Oakland blend which is a drip coffee. My friend described it as having the taste of teriyaki beef jerky which made me burst out in laughter since that sounded absurd! However, once I tasted it, the same exact thought ran through my mind. It might sound offputting and strange, but it was still an interestingly good cup of coffee that I could see myself getting on a next visit. If you want to experience the colorful and magnificent joys that come with this now dubbed \"tetiyaki beef jerky drip coffee\", make no hestitaion whatsoever in purchasing some of them oakland blends!", "author": "Joshua M."}

The coffee here is delicious (that's not the thing) but it's so unbelievably strong. For someone who's not a daily coffee drinker, my visit here yesterday caused some serious problems. \n\nDon't get me wrong, when I say delicious I mean like the absolute most delicious mocha I've ever had in my life.\n\nI took about an hour to drink it because I was in a meeting and didn't want the meeting to end the second we both drained our cups. \n\nAs I was heading home I felt woozy. Nauseous, had a pounding headache and my hands started to shake like an alkie. \n\nBy the time I got home I just felt sick. I drank a gallon of water and that's it for the rest of the day. Spent a long time under the duvet. Couldn't function. \n\nWas it delicious? Yes. The best, as a matter of fact. But worth the coffee hangover? No! It was a waste of a day because I ordered a coffee that unbeknownst to me, was so strong it basically put me out of action for the rest of the day. \n\nI get it that coffee is an exclusive little club just like wine or whisky. And maybe as a social coffee drinker, not an habitual one, the coffee is going to make me tremor or have a raised heart rate or feel a little quesy. But for like 8 hours afterwards? I had the coffee at 11.30am and didn't get to sleep until 3.30am. \n\nI feel like a teenager who's never had liquor ordering a strong whisky and drinking it like a shot. Phew! I just don't know if I'm right or wrong to feel that it was a little unfair that the coffee was so, so strong and my body couldn't even deal with it. It's not like I'm a coffee virgin. \n\nMain problem : coffee TOO damn STRONG. Should come with a health warning. \n\nAnother issue: always too crowded and a long wait for hot drinks. \n\nPlus: nice environment, cool location, great decor, pleasant-ish staff.

The Sansome location has a great vibe and energy.  Lately there have been two incidents that have me thinking it's time to move on. The first is where I waited over 20 minutes and when I tasted my latte it was clearly spoiled milk. The barrista quickly made a new one and apologized. Today was the opposite. It was made really quickly and the milk was just dumped  in the espresso with no care and it looks and tastes like it. It could have been Starbucks if it wasn't for the $8 price tag.  I dumped it out as soon as I got to the office...$8 figuratively and literally down the drain. I'm hoping that B.B. isn't on the way down based on too much growth.

Staff was friendly and efficient.  Loved the firm cap of foam on my mug of mocha. All coffees are brewed by the pour over process. Their website says their beans are no more than 48 hours out of the roaster. \n\nFound a nice window seat at the window bar. As I sat enjoying the view, I noticed quite a hub-bub of annoying voices all chattering simultaneously. The bar across the lobby was generating so much noise that the typical coffee bar ambience was totally destroyed. A snapshot look around showed the coffee crowd going about minding their own business but I was not enjoying  the noise from across the way. By now, I've also noticed that the taste  of the coffee was not new for me. The Hayes Valley Espresso beans were reminiscent of a great local roaster back home, being  deep and robust, with a tangy finish. It was a good mocha but I wasn't wowed.

Normally at this time, I wouldn't even consider lining up. But after a night of not-so-good sleep, I desperately needed a cup of coffee to keep me awake. Also, I've been meaning to try this place since my coworker kept raving about it. So I thought why not? \n\nI ordered a latte with almond milk at the suggestion of a coworker. Read a couple of reviews that mentioned the liege waffle so I decided to order that as well. The latte was on the sweeter side possibly because of the almond milk? Not complaining though because I prefer my coffee to be on the sweeter side. Oh! And the latte art was so pretty! The waffle was scrumptious! The large sugar crystals had melted and caramelized the surface which contributed to the bite of the crispy golden exterior. The inside was chewy, yet tender. The yeasty sweetness of the dough inside was rich and indulgent!

I wish I could say a latte isn't worth $5 ($4.94, to be exact), but this one is as it is made so, so well. Absolute perfection (albeit a few caveats).\n\n1) If you don't like sweet/sugary coffee, stay away from the New Orleans iced coffee. Yes, it has chicory, which is great and all, but for those of us who like our coffee plain and simple, it's not worth the price for disappointing sickly sweetness.\n\n2) The drip coffee is of the hipster variety that focuses on the acidity and fruitiness, as opposed to the more earthy, chocolate notes of traditional roasts. For this reason, I avoid the drip coffee. It is excellent if you like acidic, fruity coffee, but those of us with more \"traditional tastes should avoid.\n\n3) Ugh, the prices. I mean, yes, it is San Francisco, and yes, it is not the only place forcing you to shell out $5 for a 12 oz latte, and yes, I want their baristas to be paid a fair wage because they are wonderful human beings, but ugh, it is expensive. For the economically-conscious of us, this is more of a treat/once a week venture as opposed to a daily habit (although I wish I could sustain such a habit!). \n\nBottom line: Come here for the espresso and espresso drinks.

I was lucky enough to get in yesterday by accidentally discovering the friends and family soft launch, where they let whomever showed up enjoy the goods for free. Don't worry, I'll be emptying my wallet here in the future, so this appraisal is not influenced by the promise of free product. Let the review begin...\n\nOkay, the first thing to figure out is that you have to enter through the building's lobby on Bush Street (though Blue Bottle lists the location as 115 Sansome). Once you're inside, the first thing you notice is, like the lobby, the Blue Bottle space has been gorgeously renovated. A spacious, bright and airy corner set apart from the gritty, urban maelstrom and gridlock hell outside. Plentiful seating and fantastic coffee together, what is the FiDi coming to?!?!\n\nThe product, you likely already know if you're a coffee lover. If not, note that it's a delightfully freshly roasted nectar of the gods. Always brewed within 48 hours of roasting! Not too darkly roasted either. All combining for delightful and somewhat subtle complexity. I had a latte ($4.25) and a New Orleans iced coffee ($4), and both were near perfect. The caramelized Belgian waffles are made to order and sweet enough that you don't even need syrup.\n\nI should also mention that the service is the nicest I've received at any coffee establishment in the FiDi. Alex at the counter has a great smile and is remarkably friendly. Tanner, the manager, took a second to say hi, which almost startled me given the crush of the line. No hate on the other coffee spots around here, but everyone else seems to be too busy to be nice. Note that the line was almost 20 deep but moved very quickly. These folks know what they're doing and aren't suffering from the typical just-opened confusion.\n\nThe coffee is so much better in store than the brewed-from-Blue-Bottle-beans java we get in the office that I'll likely be in here pretty frequently. I've already proposed setting up a zipline, since we're on the 8th floor, kitty-corner to the store. I won't completely abandon Coffee Cultures, which is on the other side of Bush, because they have a different flavor profile that I'm more in the mood for sometimes. But Blue Bottle has such a great space that it's a little bit of R&R just to visit.\n\nI have to credit the expansion-minded corporate leaders for being so \"un-chainy.\" They do such a fabulous job coming up with unique store designs to individually fit each neighborhood that their dreams of world domination just might come true. If that happens, just remember that they started in Oakland. And if they become world champs, well then that's just following in the Warriors footsteps, right?", "author": "Ted R."}

The clean, white aesthetic I love with lots of natural light and big windows. The round marble table in the middle is gorgeous and there's just so much room and space. I also like and appreciate the small touches. For example, the condiment bar has a place for everything, as well as a hole to pour out coffee genius.\n\nService was pretty efficient at the register. I got the pound cake and the waffle, both were so good! Not too sweet and still a treat. The coffee however was just okay to be honest. I got a soy latte and usually it's heaven in a cup! Given how many baristas they have, you expect the quality and speed to be great, but it was average.

I hadn't asked for milk, and she hadn't asked what kind (I can only drink almond milk), so I had to give it back for her to make another. Then, new drink in hand, I went to go wait with my friends for their espresso drinks. We were waiting for over 10 minutes, again, without much of a crowd at all. We overheard someone else asking about where there drink was and receive a really rude reply from one of the baristas. As we're waiting, I realized that my drink was sweetened, which is again, not what I ordered, but I didn't want to ask again so I kept it. My friends' drinks finally came out and we left. Maybe 30 seconds later my friend says her espresso is so bad she can't drink it and throws it away. I also throw away my super sweet cold brew. One drink is actually acceptable of the three.

It is still cold brew coffee but without so much bitterness. It's the perfect balanced coffee drink pre-made for for the casual coffee getter. No need to add milk or additional sweetener.\n\nThe waffle is served warm by itself. When you walk into the building you can start to smell the butter from these waffles. It is light and fluffy and a nice little nibble in the morning that pairs well with your coffee. Even though it smells like it should be saturated in butter, it's surprisingly airy.

Get with it chica- being in the service industry means being nice when your day blows. Will I return? Probably. But if this girl is still cashiering with a nasty attitude, I won't be back   a third time. Just sayin", "author": "Rachel B."}

It is worth it if you are the kind of person that cares about good, strong coffee. Me, I'm okay with Peet's...but I do appreciate the occasional cup of Blue Bottle.", "author": "Rex M."}

Coffee and the breakfast bar met my expectation level and was pretty satisfied and happy. Somehow, not giving 5 stars as they don't have option of honey and just 1 standard milk/cream. Will definitely come back though.", "author": "Sameer K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-08-11", "description": "Experience: A fairly consistent long line with customers (I counted 15) being serviced by one cashier who was also making iced coffees and handing out pastries. At the same time an army of employees are busy behind the counter, but this does not match up with the actual minimal output (I counted an average of 1 coffee a minute?). I like the coffee but unfortunately many people in the financial district have no time to wait in line for 15 minutes because of inefficiency (on purpose?). Manager kept insisting on their quality, which I do not argue with, but one can maintain quality while increasing output (will benefit both Bluebottle and the customers).", "author": "A M."}

They are super friendly and serve some of the best coffee in the bay area.  Plus, their baked treats are dynamite!  This location in particular has not yet failed me, but has perfectly extracted the brown dragon everytime.  What's more, if I ever had a suggestion to improve the drink construction, they listened with open ears and open hearts, because they seemto truly care about the product and customer satisfaction.  Kudos Blue Bottle!  All the gourmet with none of the sass.", "author": "Justin J."}
