It's in my top 5 ice creams in SF, but the biggest downside is the price. The price for the ice cream without the extras is $5 and with the extras is $7 which is a LOT of money for ice cream. Still worth it... but I think I would get it a lot more if with the extras it was $5. It is also quite far from other things unless you're in the park and going to the museums in the area, so I wish I could come here more often than I do. If you're in the area and have $7 in CASH ONLY to spare, you need to go! \n\nOne thing I will mention - their truck is frequently closed or they close early, etc. so check their twitter before you head there to prevent you from being disappointed - literally has happened to me so many times, it's upsetting!", "author": "Jacqueline H."}

This is different from any other ordinary dipped ice cream cone. I think of it is a hybrid between frozen yogurt and ice cream. It's not quite frozen yogurt, but ice cream in the form of frozen yogurt. The rich ice cream is creamed with organic milk, making it the perfect consistency. The hints of vanilla bean blends well and brings out the sweetness. It's dipped in very good quality TCHO chocolate. Of course, no ice cream cone is complete without the chocolate shell.\n\nService: The guy at the window is patient and helpful. However, I saw that he doesn't wear gloves and uses his bare hands, after he touched money, to sprinkle the salt onto the cones, which has not very sanitary. \n\n Even though it's a bit pricey for an ice cream cone, it's worth every penny.", "author": "Michelle F."}

Fine, but nothing to write home about. Without the topping, I would have been disappointed. I'm glad I went for the chocolate dip, it comes with a little bit of sea salt, which gives it a nice touch.

They were conveniently located right across the street from the Botanical Garden entrance near the corner of Martin Luther King, Jr Drive and Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive which is actually a smart location for them because they also get a lot of foot traffic from the Japanese Tea Garden, California Academy of Sciences, and the De Young Museum.\n\nTheir menu is pretty intimidating when you first see it because they have so many different items and options to choose from (http://bit.ly/29Z8oeK).  I just decided to go with that they're known for and order have their Vanilla Bean Chocolate Twirl Soft Serve dipped in TCHO Dark Chocolate in a sugar cup and then sprinkled with sea salt (http://bit.ly/29DYg91).  Oh man!  The swirl ice cream was really good, but what really made it shine was the TCHO chocolate dip.   So good!!  They didn't put too much sea salt on mine compared to other pics I've seen, but that was fine. The sea salt was subtle and the sweet with salty combo was great.  Unfortunately they were out of sugar cones that day, but the sugar cup worked just as fine which I actually prefer because cones usually tend to leak at the bottom.  I would totally order this again!\n\nOverall, I know I just had one thing from their menu, but that was enough for me to say that Twirl and Dip is awesome!

That would be doing Mitchell's right. \n\nTo do Twirl and Dip right, you need to get the organic soft serve, upgrade to the sugar cone (extra $1.50), choose a topping or two (ranges from an extra $0.50-$1.50, depending), and pay with cash. My husband and I are especially partial to vanilla bean + toffee pieces but when it's a celebration, we'll pay the extra $1.50 to dip in TCHO chocolate and get some of that sea salt goodness.

San Francisco can be a very unfriendly city (comparatively speaking), and it's so refreshing when people are nice to you! \n\nWe had the ice cream, not the soft serve. They had three flavors of Mitchell's Ice Cream the day we went (strawberry, pistachio and grasshopper pie), and since I'm an ice cream fanatic, we got a sundae to share. Two scoops of pistachio ice cream, Toasted Coconut, Butterscotch, Whipped Cream and a Luxardo Cherry on top! Delicious! Not too sweet and we just loved the toasted coconut and butterscotch combination. \n\nNext time, I'd like to try their Soft Serve which is from Straus Creamery.

I didn't taste much of the \"white pepper\" part of the lolly, however.  The lolly also tasted like it had been sweeted, which it didn't need.  The natural sweetness of the watermelon would have been enough.  I think it would have been interesting to see a watermelon and lime juice combinator.  I wasn't a huge fan of the circular shape: While it did make the lolly stand out from usual ice pops, I think the circular shape made it more conducive to melting or dripping with the increased surface area.\n\n-Chocolate/Vanilla soft serve swirl\nThe swirl was probably a poor decision on my part because I couldn't really sample or appreciate the two flavors on their own-- the chocolate just overpowered the vanilla.  The soft serve ice cream in my work cafe is the straus organic vanilla and chocolate, and that is what I've been having a lot of this summer.  The soft serve from Twirl and Dip didn't seem to be that much different from the ones we have in our cafes.

When you're facing the museum, swing to the right and follow it to the main road and you'll see the truck on your left. Unless Karl the Fog is completely blanketing the park, there's guaranteed to be a bit of a wait. After long walks through the park or multi-mile bike rides, this is how I reward myself. Oh hell, let's be real, I reward myself when I haven't moved all day. I digress. \n\nWhat should you get? Don't argue with me. It's organic vanilla bean soft serve (none of this \"1/2 1/2 swirl\" business), dipped in silky Tcho chocolate topped with barely there granules of Maldon sea salt. If you're looking for an Insta-worthy photo op and I know you are, try rainbow sprinkles, honeycomb candy, toffee pieces, etc for some texture and color. If you're erring on the side of caution and responsibly opting for a cup, there's also a slew of other toppings to choose from including seasonal fruit sauces. \n\nIt only falls one star for how pricey a single cone gets with just one or two add-ons. Unless you're just going for a simple scoop of Mitchell's, a soft-serve cone runs $5-7 easy.

I decided to try their regular staple item - soft serve on a cone.\n\nI was going to say, \"I'd like a chocolate and vanilla twirl on a plain cone, dipped in dark chocolate with moldan sea salt,\" which is basically the complete description from the menu.

Plain cone\" Yay for being concise and sounding like a regular.\n\nAnyways, the chocolate-dipped twirl really hit the spot. The outer layer of chocolate had hardened from the cold of the icecream, and the inside was delicious and creamy. \n\nAt $5.50 ($4 base price, + $1.50 for chocolate dip), it's a bit pricey.

I was buggin. I had to have some. Unfortunately the day we were to go it was raining and the Twirl and Dip truck did not make an appearance. SADNESS.\n\nThis year I was determined. I'd be dreaming about those cones all year long, after all. It was a fairly warm, sunny day and we made our way over to Golden Gate Park to get our ice cream on.\n\nWhen we arrived I was overwhelmed. There were the aforementioned dipped cones but also ice cream sodas, popsicles, sundaes and more. I knew I had to get the cone but I also opted for the butterscotch ice cream soda. I'm a little bit crazy when it comes to sugar.\n\nI watched the gal inside the truck make the soda. It was insane. I don't know what I was thinking but I was expecting the sheer magnitude of stuff that went into it. Multiple scoops of ice cream, soda water, and about half a bottle of butterscotch syrup, more ice cream, more soda, whipped cream, more butterscotch. I was like \"Oh crap. What have I done.\" Luckily I was with 3 other people who were more than happy to help me polish that baby off. And it was gone pretty quickly. It is VERY sweet. If you like sugar and butterscotch definitely order this. If you're not big on sugar I would avoid at all costs. As I mentioned, I am big on sugar so I was in heaven. Buzzy, twitchy, delicious heaven.\n\nThe ice cream cone was a bit less intense but no less delicious. I ordered mine in a hand-made sugar cone. The cone was fantastic but if I'm being honest I probably wouldn't order it again, if only for the cleanliness factor. it tasted amazing but it was shaped in such a way that it made eating the ice cream a bit challenging. By the end I was a sticky mess and there wasn't really a place around for me to go wash my hands. The ice cream was smooth and creamy with a solid vanilla flavor to it. The chocolate was Tcho fair trade dark chocolate and sprinkled with Maldon sea salt. It was rich, not too sweet, and had a lovely salty crunch. I'm craving it just as I think about it.\n\nI'm sad this truck doesn't exist near me in Michigan but with such delicious, sugary offerings maybe it's a good thing! ;)", "author": "Annette J."}

I've seen their truck parked near the Academy of Science entrance for a while now and I figured it was high time to try it out.\n\nThere are quite a few treats to choose from but their swirl dipped cones with a dash or sea salt were what I wanted.  Once my girlfriend took the first nibble at hers however, I immediately regret my decision.  The problem is that the hot chocolate melts the ice cream and hardens in a thicker than normal shell, causing a lot of pressure to build before the inevitable explosion of soft serve out of the sides.  Before we knew it we were both covered in melted ice cream, and there was no napkins in sight.  The flavor of the soft serve was great, and I especially enjoyed the chocolate and sea salt.  However, considering the mess it makes, I don't think I would order it again.  The frozen banana is probably a better choice for me.\n\nService was pretty fast and friendly, and the line moves quickly.  Prices are on the high side so expect to pay about $5 per cone.  It's a convenient treat in the park and perfect for the Indian summer we're experiencing now.  Kids will love it, but parents will hate to clean it up.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-09", "description": "I have long waxed nostalgic for soft ice cream, which seems to have been hounded from ice cream trucks by the easier-to-manage packaged ice cream treats. So the idea of artisanal soft ice cream sounded like a can't miss!\n\nWe went for the classic option: a vanilla-and-chocolate swirl with a chocolate dip. I opted for the fleur de sel sprinkles on my (high quality dark chocolate) dipped cone, and sprang for the handmade sugar cone (which added $1.25 to the price, as I recall).\n\nHere's the sad truth: soft ice cream just isn't anywhere near as good as hard, scooped ice cream. (Twirl and Dip offers that too, but the soft ice cream seems to be their main thing.)\n\nAnd here's the even sadder truth: the crappy chocolate dip you got from the ice cream truck of your youth is actually better than the high-quality dark chocolate dip you can get from T&D. The old-skool dip turns into a very thin shell that cracks, giving your ice cream a nice crunchy texture. The high-quality dip turns into a very thick shell that is chewy and overwhelms the ice cream. I was very glad I had the fleur de sel sprinkles, which mitigated the sweetness.\n\nThe sugar cones were excellent, and made me very glad we ponied up the premium price. But the way they are rolled leaves a big valley for the soft ice cream to dribble out of, so these were way, way messier than any other ice cream cone we had during our trip (more than a dozen!) So be very cautious about getting a cone if you are wearing anything you want to keep ice-cream free, or if you're not certain you'd recognize your child once he is coated with a layer of melted cream.\n\nAlso, it's an extraordinarily slow ordering process -- not sure why. There was only one 4-person family in front of us in line, but it took about 15 minutes for us to get our ice cream cones. So if there were any line at all, I'd give this a miss.", "author": "Alexandra S."}

The chocolate was a lot less delicious, but still pretty good. If I were to try this place again, I would totally get a vanilla bean soft serve in a sugar cone. The sugar cone was delicious!\n\nThe Sunday sundae special ($6.00) was ice cream, banana slices, almonds, toffee brittle, toasted almonds, whipped cream, chocolate sauce and a cherry on top. It said that it would have butterscotch sauce too, but I didn't remember it on my sundae. I got it with the two different ice creams as well, but the whole thing was a mess when I started eating it. The cherry was not that good since it was not one of those maraschino cherries, but like a sour one, but everything else was really good. I enjoyed the different things all in one bite. \n\nThe pretzel rods ($1.50) were not that amazing. I personally don't like the combination of salt and sweet. Not my personal favorite. \n\nI was very interested in the floats and fruitsicles they had there as well, but I couldn't have everything...they would have melted, surprising in a San Francisco April day. I hope I see their truck again sometime on Sunday when we meander around the park looking for an adventure!", "author": "Nina Y."}

They are local and specialize homemade organic soft serve. According to their website they use the all famous Straus Family Creamery milk and cream in their soft serve, organic fair trade chocolate from Sweet Earth, Blue Bottle coffee, and seasonal fresh fruits and herbs from the many organic farmers in Northern California. Twirl and Dip also bakes all of their own baked goods and hand rolls their cones. The cones come in three different flavors: plain, milk, dark or white chocolate. Last but not least what makes them unique is they make their own Popsicles too. \n\nI got to check out their soft serve today while i was at the Nihonmachi Street Fair in Japantown today, they stood out because they were the only food cart/truck there. They were not very busy, I was guessing because they are not as well known as the other food carts/trucks in the city. This however didn't stop me from coming over to try it, what caught my eye was that they used organic ingredients and there soft serve is homemade.\n\nThey had 3 different soft-serve flavors today:\n\n$4 for a reg cone or cup and handmade cones were $4.50 each.\n\n-Vanilla Bean\n-Sweet Earth Chocolate\n-Chocolate Vanilla Twirl\n\nFruitsicles $3 each!\n\n-watermelon\n-nectarine \n-strawberry\n\nA few other things they have are sundaes and they even have a mexican coke ice cream float\n\n\nLastly they also had a soft serve ice cream sandwich $5 bucks and ur pick of which soft serve you want!\n\nI got one Vanilla Bean Soft Serve ice cream sandwich and a chocolate vanilla twist to share with the gf.  The vanilla Bean Soft Serve was in btw two delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies.

It's a delicious thick layer of chocolate; I couldn't get the plastic spoon through it, so I just bit the top of my ice cream. Mmmmm I love sea salt with chocolate; it gives a nice kick from the sweetness. You can get it without the sea salt (they ask you).\n\nI appreciate their passion for organic/fair trade/locally-sourced desserts. Thanks Twirl and Dip!\n\n*They have a permanent location at Golden Gate Park Wednesday-Sunday from 12:30-6pm", "author": "Katherine S."}

Yea yea... its organic, local, seasonal ect, but  I am not willing to sacrifice taste/quality, and if you have to do that for the organic factor, its not worth it!\n\n I am giving it three stars because of the high price and few choices. When I go for soft-serve its about the experience, consistency, look, as well as taste! This soft-serve didn't quite wow me on any of those counts.  IThe soft-serve only had vanilla and chocoalte nutmeg to choose from.  I thought that the vanilla needed a little bit more vanilla bean to be a specialty treat and the chocolate nutmeg was a little heavy on the nutmeg which made it just a little too bitter (cool idea though) It was also too melty- not good consistency. \n\nI had the ice cream sandwich- cookies ($4.5) with home baked cookies and vanilla in the middle.  The cookies were good, but nothing that I couldn't make at home. \n\nI wish I had gotten the honey-melon popsicle (sugar free!) or the strawberry creamsicle.. those looked really delicious, and definitely worth the 3 dollar cost.- couldn't make those at home or get it better somewhere else!\n\nThey also had sundae topping available, which seemed a little pricey on top of the 3 dollar/scoop cost.

The truck is by the Academy of Sciences so stop by if you want a snack!!", "author": "Lana K."}

Perfect texture, rich chocolate flavor, and a bit of sea-salt on top to accentuate the sweetness. My son loved the swirl with rainbow sprinkles. (He'll eat anything with rainbow sprinkles, though, so does that count?)", "author": "Eli R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-10-14", "description": "Pretty overpriced (3 or 3.50 for just ice cream, and at least a dollar more if you want to try any of the interesting toppings!) The mint chip (a scoop variety) was good, but not exceptional, but the fair trade dark chocolate dip with sea salt was AMAZING. The chocolate was really good quality, and the salt really added to the flavor! I also tried the vanilla soft serve (which was probably better than most soft serves), and the handmade chocolate and butterscotch sauces, which were excellent (and also slightly salty).", "author": "Annie O."}

The chocolate is waaaaay too chocolatey and doesn't have that nice whipped Carvelesque consistency.  The vanilla has flecks of vanilla bean (!), which is so West Coast.  Carvel, please come to SF.  I miss you.", "author": "A W."}

I rode by and thought \"hmm, this looks like it would really hit the spot\" and it did! I had the tangerine popsicle and the BF had the vanilla bean soft serve with the waffle cone. Both were absolutely delicious. Popsicle tastes like a fruit icee with really strong flavor (not your mom's homemade popsicles!). The BF's vanilla bean soft serve was amazing! The vanilla bean flavor really shone through and the waffle cone was definitely worth the extra $1. Don't pass this up the next time you see the truck hanging around Crissy field!", "author": "Angela L."}

I know they are usually at GGP along MLK drive so we walked a bit first and rewarded ourselves with chocolate/vanilla swirl soft serve covered in dark chocolate and sprinkled with sea salt.

It looked good, but I've definitely had better. The chocolate dip was a weird chewy texture and the soft serve started melting and dripping all over my hands and cone after my first bite. My first bite! The vanilla part of the twirl tasted stronger than the chocolate, which was a pleasant surprise. \n\nI won't be coming back here by choice, but if I do happen to pass by while in Golden Gate Park, I will give Twirl and Dip a second chance.\n\nOne star for everything being homemade and organic, the second one for the vanilla bean.", "author": "Sabina Y."}

I like to think of myself as a fruit connoisseur- I like 99.95% of all fruits. So when I saw an assortment of fruitsicles available, my taste buds perked up. My choices were honey melon, strawberry and strawberry creamsicle. I always like to ask the food makers/wait staff which they prefer (cause really, who better to ask???) so I took the suggestion of the nice lady at the window and went with the honey melon ($3) because melons are apparently still in season. \nMy tongue peeked out cautiously and met the surface of the fruitsicle. It was met with a sweet, subtle taste of honeydew melon. Ohhhh so refreshing! I went on enjoying it until I tasted my bf's chocolate nutmeg ice cream on a homemade cone with almonds ($4.25) that my taste buds got confused and couldn't taste the melon... I gave them a little pep talk and was able to enjoy the rest of it. :)", "author": "Amanda W."}

We wanted something that our son would go bonkers over and that he would remember forever (especially since we're bidding adieu to the city and all his preschool buds as we prepare for a big move to the burbs) .  We've done the bouncy house, had gourmet cupcakes, all the typical city birthday party stuff .. but this, THIS topped them all!  Not only was Meg friendly and warm and easy to deal with, but she and Siri pulled up in their truck a little early, stayed a little late and genuinely seemed to enjoy serving ice cream to about 30 3-5 year olds who were each very particular about just what they wanted in/on their treat.  At the end, they even invited my 2 boys into the truck to see the inner workings of a real, live ice cream truck.  They were still talking about it at bedtime tonight and one of them is even sporting the Twirl and Dip sticker on his jammies.  \n\nOh and most importantly, I should mention the soft serve ice cream is delicious!  The little ones loved the vanilla, chocolate and swirl and I will speak for all of the parents in saying the butterscotch sundae was out of this world.  I will be stalking the Marina Green each and every day till we move, just to get a little more of Twirl and Dips yummy sundaes.  \n\nStop by the Twirl and Dip truck at the Marina Green or in Golden Gate park or heck, hire them for your next birthday or office party, or even a wedding!  You and your guests will be happy you did. We're still smiling about how successful our son's birthday was, thanks to Meg and Siri!", "author": "Jennifer C."}
