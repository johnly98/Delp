The ambiance is stellar and takes you away from San Francisco. The decor is wonderful, even the hallway where the restrooms were and leading up to the kitchen was gorgeous. Seats are low like sofas and you can lounge on the pillows. Best seats are the ones facing the middle of the room, as you can see the whole restaurant and have the perfect view of the belly dancing show. I love that the dancer encourages participation. The waiter was kind and courteous. Food is unique and tasty. The seafood special entree was so yummy, although a bit smaller portion than other dishes. The lamb chicken entree was great. The tea they offer toward the end if so delicious, slightly sweet and feels comfortably warm. Every bit of this night was a fun experience.\nCost comes out to ~$65 per person including tax/tip for prefix (appetizer, entree, dessert) and one beer/wine.\nDo expect that dinner for a group may be about 2.5 hours, as there is time in between each course.", "author": "Veranna N."}

We had such a strange experience at this restaurant the other night that I felt compelled to tell the story as I found it humorous.\nWe arrived, my family and I for my mom's 80th birthday.  She wanted Moroccan food so we thought we'd give El Mansour a try. When we entered It was a little odd at first as we were the only customers in the entire restaurant, so that had kind of a strange feeling to it. However, the gentleman who greeted us and served us was fantastic. The food was wonderful!  \nBut here's where things got weird. We sat down and were served appetizers and they were great. Then the main course came. Just as the food was put on the table, very loud music started to play and a woman dressed as a belly dancer came out from the back and began to dance. Now I've been to Moroccan restaurants plenty of times and I'm quite familiar with belly dancing and it can be a pleasant art form. That being said, this woman was definitely NOT a belly dancer. Just some lady shaking it around in a costume like a belly dancer and pushing up on us trying to get us to put dollars in her outfit. She danced and didn't seem to acknowledge the fact that none of us were interested in her at all because, as I mentioned before, she was not a belly dancer.  Oh yeah, and to make it really even more creepy, the only other person in the restaurant, apparently, was her father who she brought along to watch the show.  He sat opposite us, the only other person in the restaurant, staring at this whole fiasco with a big grin on his face. Creepy creepy creepy. The woman finally left after five terrifyingly frightening songs and dances.  And remember, this is all going on at the exact time they serve us our hot food and she literally said oh \"well now I'm going to have to compete with the food for your attention\".\nI don't understand if we are supposed to eat while watching her or leave the food on the table to get cold while we watch her or are we supposed to ignore her and eat? Also, they make a big show of everyone washing hands prior to eating as you eat with your hands.  Money is very dirty.  So are we supposed to be stuffing bills into the sweaty clothing with one hand and eat with the other?  None of that is made clear.\nMy conclusion to this whole thing is that the food is wonderful and would be great for takeout. Or perhaps on a busier day when the real belly dancers are working.  I feel very sorry for the kind gentleman who was the proprietor that evening as he was phenomenal. I am a bit confused why he allowed this \"show\" to go on but at least we have a very funny story to tell for years to come. Remember that awful belly dancer.... And we'll laugh.", "author": "Josh W."}

I was blessed to eat here for the first time, on a first date, with someone very special. It was absolutely perfect. The atmosphere is sensual, festive, enchanting, cozy and beautiful. We felt welcomed, like family; like they wanted us to stay. And dine and party with them and the belly dancer all night. \n\nIt felt like I was dining at the royal palace. Food is beautifully presented with love and oh so flavorful! Since they bring each morsel separately it just keeps getting better and better and you always have something to look forward to! \n\nThe hand washing rituals with flower aroma made me feel like a queen.\nThe mint tea was like drinking a glass of warm joy. \nThe Bastela du Chef chicken pastilla with powdered sugar, cinnamon and almonds was an exotically-delicious delight!\n\nThank you El Mansour for treating your guests like royalty! You are the true royalty on San Francisco.

But we got lucky and got seated. The atmosphere is fabulous; the decor, music, dancing, hand washing service, and seating -- it all made for a unique experience, I loved it all. Service was great, as soon as you're seated, the bread and water arrive, and we made our entree selections for our 5-course meal. The soup was lovely, I adored the salad plate, and the bastilla was great (note: they will create a vegetarian one if you ask.) Our entrees - chicken with the lemon and olives, and couscous with vegetables -- were delicious. Dessert was nice, but we were too full to finish it. If I had to nitpick one detail it would be the knafeh. I'm used to the Lebanese version of this dessert and what we got was more of a napoleon. Not sure if this is how Moroccans make this dessert, but I was just thrown off a bit by it. The mint tea was the perfect way to end the meal. I'm already looking forward to our next visit.", "author": "Liz I."}

We had 3 tables for 13 guests. On our table we had 5 people and opted to order 3 plates. Our waiter required the extra 2 people to order the soup, salad and starter for $20 a head. (not sure if this is a thing every night or if it's because we had a big party). Anyway, the 3 plates were more than enough for the 5 of us to become stuffed! \n\nSomething I wanted to mention is that the \"starter\" we got was the same size for the 5 of us as it was for the 3 people we were sitting next to even though we had 2 people paying extra money for it. =/ Food was great regardless.\n\nThe belly dancer was entertaining.

El Mansour is really off-the-beaten-path for me.  A  far-far-and-away place that I wouldn't  have known about it had it not been for my friend's birthday.  Shout out to my girl!\n\nWhen I arrived, I thought, \"ok, the Moroccan theme is in full effect.\"  It is a bit corny, but all in all, they've done a good job with the ambiance - dimly lit, beautiful colors, mosaic lighting effects.  All of the seating is the round-table comfort-style, so get prepared to take a chill pill.  \n\nAfter I took in the Moroccan theme, 'twas time to chow down.  My friends ordered the 5-course meal, and I gotta give them mad props for even mentioning that I'm a vegetarian.  Seriously - when it comes to family-style meals, I'm easy.  Just go with the flow even if that means I'm eating bread and rice. It's all good.\n\nThe party started with lentil soup.  100% vegetarian and definitely worth a second bowl if you're hungry.  And next up was a hodgepodge plate - there was a bunch of meaty stuff on this plate but the only thing I can remember I could eat was the eggplant - SO GOOD!  \n\n**THE NEXT DISH, YOU CANNOT MISS** I don't remember the name, but it's a sweet and savory pastry dish (they'll know when you tell them). It's a sweet pastry stuffed with savory, spicy, delectable vegetables and meat.  El Mansour was so nice, they made a special vegetarian version for lil old me.  That just made my night.  By the way, it all comes with bread, bread, and more bread.  Nothing special or artisan - in fact, I think the bread is just regular old white buns. But you'll definitely want one or two to soak up all that spicy goodness.\n\nAnd finally, desserts.  Honestly, I don't think desserts here are memorable - especially since I can't remember what we had!   It's all topped off by mint dessert tea and that's a fun one to bust out the iPhone video :)\n\nAll in all, the food, belly dancing, ambiance and desserts make a fun package for a group of friends to just hang out, be chill, and get some good bites.\n\nFINAL NOTE:  Don't worry about getting gussied up to come here.

The food is extraordinarily underwhelming compared to other Mediterranean restaurants. They knowingly served us kanefeh that had salt instead of sugar.  It wasn't even real kanafeh anyways (it was composed of puff pastry). The belly dancers aren't great so if you're looking for professional belly dancing you're better off anywhere else. Definitely the worst restaurant I've ever been to in my entire life. Don't waste your money or time. This place shames middle eastern hospitality and cuisine.\n\nSide Note: Each individual in your group MUST order a FULL meal. A girl in our group of 10 was not that hungry and wanted to opt for something light but our waiter told us that it was not possible.

We told them that some of us had to depart early, but our food still came very late, the final course arriving when it was departure time for us. Although the food is fairly good, the prices are way too high for Moroccan fare. I have been to several other Moroccan restaurants that are setup exactly the same way and don't charge exorbitant prices - the price of dining in SF I suppose.

The interior is gorgeous, with fabric hanging from the ceilings, and decorative pillows and tables.  Before you start your course, they bring over towels and a fancy water spout to pour water over your hands to wash them.  They top it off with an orange scented oil to make your hands smell extra good.  Eating here is such an experience.\n\nIt's a fixed course menu, so not the cheapest, but reasonable for the amount of food you get.  You start off with this delicious soft bread and a tasty lentil soup.  We had this unique sweet and savory meat pancake dish, the Bastela du Chef next.  As our entrees, my boyfriend and I got two different lamb dishes- the honey and almond lamb and the lamb tangine.  I would highly highly recommend the honey and almond lamb.  I absolutely adored the amount of sweet and savory combinations going on.  The dessert was equally amazing, with the fresh fried bananas.\n\nHalfway through our course, the bellydancer came out, only adding to the experience.  They poured us this amazing mint tea at the end, at about 3 ft above the actual cups- watching this was entertaining within itself.  Though this place is quite a long haul away, it's definitely worth it, both for the food and the Moroccan getaway.  I will definitely be coming back.", "author": "Jenny C."}

You see, their original location two doors up from here was the site of two life changing experiences for them:  their proposal and wedding!\nAs you walk in, you'll notice the setup is similar.  The tables have either bench seating or cushioned stools.  We were seated near the kitchen entrance.  After receiving our menus, my friends noticed it was different from before.  There are meal options as well as ala carte selections available.  We were a party of six and two diners were new to Moroccan food so we asked our waiter to  put together a family style tasting menu.  Here's what we had:\n\nFirst course\nSoup and bread (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=ulZYvIO4qYPB_MSW1-9DWQ) - Smooth and slightly warm bean or lentil soup with fresh baked warm bread.  \n\nSecond course\nPickled veggies and hummus/dips (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=gb_etxW14Mi16ODrgXDo9g) - Good munching while conversing course. Nothing really stood out.\n\nThird course\nChicken pie (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=xCX2Mi79mfF8EggQhe09fQ) - Favorite dish of the meal, but wish it was warmer.  Friend joked that he would prefer a double order of this over entrees.\n\nFourth course\nMixed entrees (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=saJuyv784apZzH--psHZ3Q&select=GSrcoR-KhUuf0D_GKKi0jQ) - This plate featured a little from each of the dinner entr\u00e9e options of seafood, kebabs, lamb, and chicken.  The seafood comprised of scallops, shrimp, and some squid, I believe.  The quartered chicken was well seasoned but a bit difficult to share as bones were an obstacle.  The kebab was okay and didn't stand out.\n\nThe dancer started her performance when we received our second course.  By this time, the dining room was 70% full.  The sword dance and audience participation were the highlights.  Given the large gap between dining trips here, it is difficult to detail the changes; generally, I remember there was more protein, the old place was cozier, and the feel was a bit warmer and brighter.  The meals here are around $40.00 per person pretax and tip.  Food rates three stars plus half star for attentive service and entertainment.  Decent change of pace neighborhood spot.", "author": "Mike C."}

The restaurant is designed in traditional Moroccan style with low tables and comfy couches. The staff is very friendly and inviting. They had moroccan wines by the bottle and glass. Their meals are basically a fixed price 4 course meal for around 40 dollars. The black bean soup is rich and warm and perfect for a cool night. The salad was a variety of mezze including eggplant, cucumber and carrot cold appetizers. The lamb entree was fantastic. The lamb kebab was also really good. The chicken kebab was average. The vegetable couscous was my favorite! Fried dough and bananas were served for dessert. It was hard to finish all the delicious food. The food and service was great. My one complaint was that there was a table of really loud male customers who were being disruptive by harassing the belly dancer and yelling when other tables got birthday singing and going into the womens bathroom and then laughing about it when I had to wait for them. The staff was obviously in a difficult position and I was disappointed they didn't ask these guests to calm down. It did make the whole experience change quite a bit.", "author": "Anne S."}

As soon as we walked in there it was aesthetically pleasurable, however, we were approached by the intimidating owner. I explained to him how I had made reservations several days ago, and he kept denying that I made the reservation because he simply didn't know my name off the top of his head and didn't bother to check. He finally sat us down in a very uncomfortable spot in the corner of another table just to squeeze us in. My friend got the courage to ask if we could possibly move, and he \"jokingly\" questioned why we wanted to move so bad. Fortunately, he was not waiting on us, and the actual waiters were very kind and understanding people. Also, the belly dancer was phenomenal. She was very interactive with the crowd, and really knew what she was doing! However, the food was pretty mediocre and very overpriced, but the portions were pretty decent.

I think, somehow, my girlfriend, our neighbor and myself were accidentally transported out of San Francisco last night and wound up in Morocco. This was a dining adventure unlike any other I can remember. I mean that sincerely, and I don't understand the yelp reviewers that spoke so nastily of this place.\n\nThe atmosphere was quite and relaxing. No, you didn't sit on the floor like other such establishments, but the seating was far more comfortable than the typical booth at any other given restaurant. I could have stretched out and fallen asleep right there if good manners hadn't prevented me from doing so.\n\nMoroccan cuisine is new to me, or was up until last night. Everything from the bread, lentil soup on up through the tea at the end was delicious and satisfying.\n\nBack to the atmosphere. I have very eclectic musical tastes and what I heard last night was a big part of what left me feeling I had been transported. Sure, it was contemporary (from what sounded like Moroccan hip hop to an extended remix of Stings \"Desert Rose), but that only served to make me feel like I was visiting the Morocco of today, and not time traveling.\n\nOne more hint on the food. If You read the menu and the sugar and cinnamon on the Bastilla sounds off-putting, please, don't let it stop you. It is a blend of sweet and savory that works so well, it's practically magic!\n\nMy only regret? Missing the belly dancer. But that, and the food is just another reason to go back again.\n\nSo, if you want to visit Morocco without a long flight or having your passport in order, don't miss this place!", "author": "Alan W."}

After entering the restaurant doorway that is lined with Moorish tiles, you've entered a large dining room that's resembles a Moroccan tent.  Walls are covered with green and red tapestry with low pillowed bench sofas and floor cushion stools and lacquered dining tables.  The dining room was semi divided into two and we were seated in the back half this evening. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#OFGmDeYqPD-uy5qRnu5D8g)( http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg)\n\nAfter checking out the menu, we opted for the specialty selections for the six of us. The meal starts off with a hand washing, where the waiters brings a silver basin to the table and pours warm water on your hands to wash them.  Why?  Because you eat with your fingers.  No utensils here.  Ok, they will give you a fork if you insist.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#R0B9NoJPGSPXc_5YLZew2w)\n\nTo start the meal, the waiter brings a large platter of sliced Moroccan flatbread for you to put on your plate.  He does come by several time during the course of the dinner to offer more bread.\n\nHarira Soup - a bowl of warm spicy lentil soup that you can dip your bread into it. Though described as spicy, didn't think it was spicy. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#Ufb3Uk7ecB17mDZg52Gwrw)\n\nSalade Mohammed V - a combination platter of tomatoes, eggplant, carrots and cucumbers. Each platter served three of us.  This is where the bread came in handy. Used it dip/grab the tomatoes and eggplant items.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#M5JdxW_Mnr8xxFrlvuCWug)\n\nEntertainment. Yes, this is when belly dancer started performing.  After her solo performance, it was audience participation time. First three women, then three men.  Let's say, I got a dance lesson with my dinner. Ha!  She then finished with a sword dance. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#JaLK7hwycpp2UIGzW9HyHg)\n\nBastela du Chef - chicken pastilla with almond and spices.  Each of powdered sugar topped pastilla served three of us.  The warm filling is not creamy, but rather a dry filling.  This Moroccan chicken pie was tasty. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#HAHxPRwJnSXLbC779D60sA)\n\nSpecialties plate -this was a good sampler plate. It consisted of Moroccan seafood (shrimp and scallops), lamb and chicken kabob, lamb and chicken with almonds and vegetables.  It was good way to get a sampling of the various Moroccan dishes.  The chicken and lamb were not deboned and hence, at times it was a little difficult to manage with just your fingers.  (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#pfOL6hR0iX5Rpua2NqOVIw)\n\nAgain, it was time for another hand washing before our dessert course.  Mint tea was then artistically poured from three feet above the cup. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#xh0OPtXQxjWcjwQbQTG6SA)\n\nKing Hassan (banana fritter) and Keneffa (sweet bastela with cream and almonds) - good, but expected something more exotic. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/el-mansour-san-francisco?select=OajpZ0UqqwJ3WJWi4Payrg#wfptEcbIdi3kBKWxN730Uw)\n\nOverall, it was a nice experiencing the foods and culture of Morocco at a neighborhood restaurant in the Richmond District.  Service was friendly and attentive.  This being my first foray into Moroccan cuisine, it was nice being able to taste a wide variety of foods during this meal.  Some dishes were tastier and more unique that others. Now I can say I've dined Moroccan.", "author": "Al L."}

(And generally quite authentic Moroccan, with a few concessions to the fact that we are in the US.)  The service was great -- attentive but not at all overbearing.  (A nice touch:  when my husband went to the restroom, the waiter came over to ask if we were there for an occasion and I told him about the birthday.  He later presented my husband with a lovely little birthday dessert.  So nice.) The belly dancing was fun and interesting.  (The dancer is one hard-working artist!  The crowd was light, since it was a Tuesday night, but she put on a great show and did her best to involve the customers.  She even got my husband to dance a little!)  One caveat -- the seating is traditional low tables and pillow-topped benches -- maybe not the most comfortable seating for people (like me) with back issues, but that is a minor cavil given the enjoyable evening we experienced.  This place is also a good value.

A very nice little touch.\n\nOur set menu for NYE was $49 (or $45, I forget). Appetizer includes spicy lentil soup (delicious and not too spicy), cold plate of eggplants, cucumber and other veggies (I don't really care about pickly stuff so no comment), and something called Bastela which is a pastry that contains minced chicken HOWEVER the crust is phyllo dough with powdered sugar! I have never had a savory meat dish that has sugar on top, yet in this case it works perfectly! LOVE LOVE LOVE the Bastela! It is a must have dish.\n\nFor entree, we got fish tangine, lamb/chicken with honey and almonds, and lamb/chicken with lemon and olives. All three dishes were amazing. The meat was extremely tender (I asked the chef and the secret is just low simmer for hours) and requires no knives. The seasoning was just right, not too much spices or salt, but a very nice delicate balance. If it's any evidence, my 16-mo toddler cannot handle spices (she rejects Ethiopian food and Indian food), but was able to gobble down the fish, lamb, and chicken with a voracious appetite. \n\nDessert is very simple. Banana fritter and sweet bastela, accompanied by sweetened mint tea. Overall the portions were very good, not too much of anything, and I feel satiated but not overly full at the end.\n\nFinally, there is entertainment. When dessert came out, so did the belly dancer. She performed 4 - 5 pieces (including a knife dance), and then asked the audience to join for dancing. I thought that was very fun and I shamelessly joined in :) after all...it's NYE! She was very engaging and professional. My little toddler was very intrigued by the dancing!\n\nThe chef came out several times to check on the guests.

Everything was delicious.\n\nFor dessert, we had banana fritters and the Keneffa - a sweet puff pastry with cream and almonds.\n\nWait..there's more!  As a palate cleanser, our server pours us hot moroccan mint tea with a touch of honey.  My favorite part was watching our server pour the tea from high above into the cup.\n\nNeedless to say, we were absolutely stuffed.  At the end of the meal, the server comes out with the wash basin for us to wash our hands.  As an extra touch, he also sprinkled rose water into our hands. \n\nThe cherry on top was the complimentary rose at the end of the night.  \n\nAnd of course, the belly dancing!  She came out twice during our meal for about 10 minutes each.", "author": "Hieu H."}

Servers no longer wear traditional dress or serve homemade bread in the traditional lidded basket.\n2. The menu is the same but the food is different. Not only smaller portions but the food.The 2nd course eggplant salad is mostly sliced pickled vegetables and dessert is a fried banana instead of that delicious fried honey stuff they used to have.\n3.

El Mansour is totally the place to go. \n\nPROS: Great food, semi-pre-fixe menu, gorgeous interior decor, parking easily available across the street, bellydancers nightly, outstanding service\n\nCONS: Ok, it's a little pricey. \n\nThe menu at El Mansour is mostly pre-fixe; choose you entree and the rest is taken care of. \n\nYour meal starts with a ritual hand-washing in a warm silver basin with towels (you're gonna eat with your hands). Next comes a harissa spiced lentil soup you'll sip from the bowl or sop up with homemade bread. A veggie course is next with a platter of 4 salads (tomato and pepper, roasted eggplant, pickled cucumber, and spicy carrot). Third course is the bastella, which is a thin and crisp philo dough filled with a savory-almost-sweet blend of chicken, eggs, and spices (this one is truly unique!). Your entree of choice will come next, and after digesting they'll bring out a fried banana dessert and a lovely pouring of moroccan mint tea. To wrap it all up, you'll wash your hands in warm water again, and the waiter will sprinkle rosewater on your hands so they don't smell like food. \n\nEl Mansour is solid moroccan food with a serving pattern that you can chat about with your fellow diners.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-09-06", "description": "tl;dr If you eat here, the food is a mixed bag, but ponder this: you must tip the bellydancer or risk looking like a jerk.  \n\nMy girlfriend and I spontanteously made reservations for 7:45, based on the great reviews.  We didn't know a ton about the place.  The decor is excellent and the opening washing-of-your-hands ritual is really welcoming.  Confusing menu.  You have to work it out - you're getting a price fixe menu, not selecting courses.  We ordered, eventually.  \n\nVery good soup and very good bread, which showed up eventually.  I liked the salad; girlfriend found it bland.  The bastela du chef, which came out eventually, I liked.   My girlfriend found the combination of powdered sugar, pastry and chicken to be an abombination.  She took a bite and then stared at the poor thing like it was a spider or running for president.  We have had hundreds of meals together but I've never found a dish that made her angry before.   If she had a time machine, she would go back and distract whoever invented that combination so that this travesty would never happen.  (Me, I liked it.)  \n\nOur main dishes were fine.  My girlfriend liked her chicken with prunes and honey very much.  My kebob was seasoned beautifully and the vegetables and coucous were tasty, but the texture of the chicken itself was strangely grainy and rubbery in a way I couldn't identify.  Then there was a very long pause for dessert, an excellent fried banana and chocolate number that could hold its head up high.  The ending tea was refreshing and sweet and served oddly -- I don't want to spoil the entertainment value but sit back from the table and be prepared for splashing.  \n\nYou can't seriously complain about how long Moroccan food takes, so I'll just say we were there for two hours.  And there were two babies who were also there for two hours.  \n\nAbout the bellydancer.  She was good.  However, I hang out with some dancers, and if you know bellydancing, she was -- fine. Ms. bellydancer, if you're reading this, apologies for the critique, I know you work hard and you love the form, and when you worked with the sword, that was quite lovely.  I'm glad that folks danced with her.  But I came for the dinnertime conversation, and if you want to distract us from that, please be excellent.  What was actually distressing, though: we couldn't help overhearing jerks who were calling her fat.  Note: Saying \"she put the 'belly' in 'bellydancing'\" isn't witty.  It's depressing.  \n\nAfter a couple of dances, the waiter put a dollar in her pants and then it was clear she was going to get tips from us.  That, I hadn't been prepared for.   Of course, she works hard, but I hadn't a clue money was going to be part of it.  My idiocy, I suppose.  One tips entertainers, but this felt like we were caged into it.  Tip or be a jerk.  \n\nHere's how that resolved: a table across from us was made up of a pair of men and an older couple, man and woman.  One of the men was focused on the dancer in a way that made me uncomfortable.  It was an ogle.  Which was strange because he was gay, and he was there with his husband or boyfriend.  And yet the look on his face was almost Tex Avery-style lust.  And then I realized what was going on: he and his mate were at dinner with his mother and step-dad.  Who didn't approve.  You could see it on Mom's face -- she was clearly not enchanted with her son's life.  And the evening became clear: the young men planned it. Of course, your parents are coming, we'll bring them to that place with bellydancers.  WE WON'T EVEN HAVE TO TALK problem solved.  \n\nSo they had many many dollars out.  The spouse danced with her.  The tension was diffused.  Yay, bellydancer!  It didn't work so much for the mother having an awkward birthday dinner with teenage daughter.  Nor my table, where it was fast becoming apparent that I was uncomfortable and feeling like sort of a grinch.  My girlfriend and I have friends who are strippers, something I hadn't really thought about until just then.  The dynamic of putting money onto a lady because she has aroused you wasn't something I was planning on doing that night.  It felt like going to an innocent time share condo meeting and then having a contract put under your nose at the end.  I didn't tip.  \n\nThere were several birthdays.  There were people having a lot of fun here.  So that's another data point, right?\n\nThe next morning, my girlfriend and I exchanged texts about our dinner.  I said I felt hungover.  She said she wondered if my chicken had been frozen.  I asked how she felt, and she said like there was still chicken and powdered sugar in her mouth.

I wish the dish came with cous cous or rice, but really with sooo much food I probably wouldn't be able to eat the whole entr\u00e9e.

And I usually don't like lamb dishes. My husband's rabbit tagine dish was delightful. Every course was delightful (not a big deal and doesn't change my high opinion of the restaurant one bit, but I think they could improve on the dessert - I'm personally not a big fan of fried bananas and phyllo dough with almonds, but others in my group enjoyed it).\n\nSecond, the experience: Interestingly, it doesn't look like a restaurant from the outside - the ceramic tiles on the wall and blue door are full of atmosphere / character, and the inside is cute as well. Service was attentive. \n\nUnlike in similar restaurants, the bellydancer doesn't merely go up to each table and do a little dance and move on to the next (we did go on a Sunday, so it was less crowded), but she performed for almost 30 minutes straight while we were there (starting at 7:30pm) and used props such as cymbals, a drum, and a sword.

I was a virgin to Moroccan cuisine but thankfully to my brother, he chose this quaint little resturant for his boyfriends birthday which myself and a small group of friends attended.\n\nUpon arrival, we were greeted and explained how all meals are pre fixed. Certain traditions were kept like washing hands before meals with rose scented water.  We were constantly checked on throughout dinner which is very important in my book. The belly dancer put on an amazing and engaging performance, pulling me and some of my friends to join in on the fun. Overall service was amazing. \n\nNext, the food. The menu consisted of specialty entrees like seafood platters, choices of meats like chicken, lamb and couscous, with soup, bread and an interesting chicken pastry for an appetizer. My friends and I chose to do the family meal option which allowed is to try a tasty variety of food. I really enjoyed the rabbit and the tender honey and almond Lamb really satisfied my palate. Overall good tasting food and a pleasant variety to choose from. \n\nLast is the ambience/atmosphere. I was very pleased to see that they stayed true to the Moroccan design. With very exotic decor, bright hues and detailed linens and light fixtures took me away on a faraway retreat. Linen Canopys hang above and the different designs and textured patterns pleased my eyes. For a moment, we all forgot we were in SF due to the beautiful surroundings. \n\nIn conclusion, this little Moraccon treasure can be pricey but the overall experience was worth every penny.

I disliked the seating as it was extremely unconfortable.  The tables were low so you are basically eating on a elevated floor.  However the floor is small hard bench.  The decorative pillows help a bit. \n\n2* The food is not something to praise over.  Certainly the quanity is there but the quality lacks.  The price options are basically set at 36.50 and 38.50.  You pay whether you want the lentil soup, salad, basteya, dessert.  The food tastes like a buffet, a bit stale.  I ordered the rabbit for the first time and I have to warn you its very gamey.  However, I didnt mind it.  The sea bass is just sad.  It has the texture of a canned fish, soft, and over cooked.   It also comes out cold soaking in clay pot.   It does not have the texture of a firm flakey and fresh sea bass that one would expect.  The dessert is ok.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-22", "description": "I came here a few months after coming back from a vacation in Morocco. I haven't been to any other Moroccan restaurants in the city so most of my comparisons are based on my memories from there. Overall, I had a great experience at this place and I would rate it 4.5/5 stars but I'm bumping it up to 5 because of the excellent service. \n\nThe first thing that I noticed when I walked in was the d\u00e9cor. The restaurant is beautifully and colorfully designed. Everything about this place, including the patterns, textures, furniture, ornaments, and some of the silverware was very reminiscent of what I had experienced when I went to Morocco. The atmosphere was authentic and unique. There was a brief moment, upon entering, when I forgot that I was in San Francisco and felt like I was instantly transported to an exotic land thousands of miles away. \n\nThe menu is pretty straightforward, you order an entr\u00e9e or a special and it comes with all of the works. I went with my girlfriend and we ordered the fish tagine and the couscous with chicken and vegetables. \n\nThey first brought out the soup with some bread. The soup reminded of the South Indian soup rasam, although it was not nearly as strong. I liked this soup better than the rasam because it was not overwhelming and I could taste the flavors more. The bread was good, but it wasn't the same kind of bread that I had in Morocco.\n\nThe next dish was the salad, which contained four separate portions of eggplant, carrots, cucumbers, and some sort of salsa looking thing that looked oddly similar to pico de gallo. The former three were delicious, varied, and flavorful. Unfortunately the latter one was disappointing - I'm not sure what they were trying to do there.\n\nAfter the salad came the pastilla. My judgement here will be unfair because in Morocco I had a home cooked pastilla that would probably be almost impossible to beat. Nevertheless, the pastilla here was fine even though it did not have as much flavor as the one in Morocco.\n\nAfterwards, we had our entrees. The couscous with chicken and vegetables was excellent although it was slightly too salty. The fish tagine was a little disappointing because the portions were small, there wasn't a lot of broth, and there wasn't really anything else there besides the fish itself. I also wish they brought it out in an actual tagine with the lid on, but that's probably just me being too pretentious about Moroccan food. Despite all that, everything tasted fantastic and was well cooked. \n\nThe dessert was pretty good as well and consisted of fried bananas and some other thing. It was good, but didn't really stand out.\n\nThe last I had was the mint tea, which tasted very similar to what I remembered.  \n\nBesides the amazing atmosphere and good food, the service was also on point. Everyone was kind, friendly, and quick to attend to our needs. There was also a belly dancer performing for everyone. She was entertaining and fun to watch.", "author": "George Z."}

This is not a restaurant I would have visited on my own but I was plesantly surprised with the food. \n\nThey only serve prix fixed menus. I ordered the seabass and my boyfriend ordered a combination of chicken and lamb kabob. They start everyone off with a small bowl of lentil soup and a piece of bread. Then you get a three combo of salad served family style. I enjoyed the tomato based salsa like salad when eaten with their bread. Your last pre-entree course is this ground chicken pastry topped with powdered sugar. It sounds quite horrendous but it was surprisingly fantastic. Wish I could have had that all to myself as it is served family style as well.\n\nMy sea bass dish came out in a clay put drenched in a red sauce. Warning, it comes with the skin on which caught me by surprise. I also got a small bowl of couscous, although no vegetables unlike everyone else. The fish was not bad, probably one of the lighter options they had. And for dessert they give you a relatively cold sweetened mint tea, I don't like sweetened teas so I was not  fan, and fried banana fritters. Again, just okay.\n\nI would have preferred the ambiance wasn't moroccan/circus like and that there weren't loud belly dancers every other hour so I could just focus on dinner with my friends and the food. But there were a few birthdays there that night so I guess some people actually enjoy it! \n\n(Also be prepared to spend 2 to 2.5 hours at dinner!)", "author": "Roxanne G."}

Great ambiance.  Perfect place for a date and fun for a group.  Their highlight of the restaurant is the belly dancing.  The dancing is about 30 minutes long.  Try not to miss it because the dancer is pretty, sexy and hot.  You can even have a chance to dance with her...pretty fun.  \n\nThe service was great.  It was kinda slow because he was the only waiter for the night.  \n\nMy friend and I got the specialty from the menu.  It was $36.50 and you can pick one meat selection and included salad, dessert, etc.  \n\nHere are what we had:\n\nMoroccan Seafood (Prawns and scallops) - It was ok.  The seafood was tasty especially the prawns.  \n\nChicken Kabob - It was good.  The chicken was tender and juicy.\n\nHarira Soup (Spicy Lentil Bean Soup) - The soup was not too spicy but it was flavorful.  Good for dipping with the bread.  \n\nSalade Mohammed V (Combination of Tomatoes, eggplant, carrots & cucumbers) - It was ok, nothing special.  It was just dipping sauce for the bread.  \n\nBastela du Chef (Pastry filled with chicken, almonds, and assortment of spices) - This was my favorite dish of the night.  It was like chicken pot pie and tasted very good.  The chicken inside was flavorful and I especially like the powder sugar outside.  Very unique and interesting pastry.\n\nKing Hassan (Banana Fritter) - It was good, not too sweet.  Perfect portion after a pretty big meal\n\nThe A La Menthe (Mint Tea) - It was tasty.  Very refreshing.  \n\nOverall, I had a great time here.  The food was good, belly dancing was fun, unique decor and great service.

I had the lentil soup, the Moroccan seafood  which contained huge shrimps and scallops with couscous,  salad, some huge chicken pie . This pie was different because it was salty with a sweet crust that gave it a new twist to my taste buds. At the end dessert and mint tea were served by our friendly waiter in a particular way.

The dancer was supermodel statuesque and had a sense of fun.   Bear in mind she is a professional dancer, not a stripper, so she would shimmy away from folks trying to stuff tips into her costume and/or require that they do some dancing first.  \n\nService was great.  The birthday girl was quite late(as is sort of a running joke) but this presented no problems for the staff.  \n\nI'm budget-conscious these days so I can't foresee heading all the way out to the Richmond just for dinner.

The food, the decor, the staff, the entertainment... all 5 stars in my eyes. BTW - I've never had Moroccan food before and now, I'm a fan!\n\nBooked a table for 7 girls for a once a year birthday extravaganza and the staff were so accommodating from start to finish. They made sure we were satisfied and entertained throughout our 5 course dinner. We decided to do the individual plates so we could all try different dishes and we were beyond stuffed.\n\n5 Course (sorry the list is long!)\nStarter: Spicy Lentil Bean Soup w/ bread - Amazing, tastes like a healthy version of a chili, totally scrumptious. \n\nSalad: Moroccan salad including tomatoes, eggplant, carrots & cucumbers - Get your veggies in! The vegetables were lightly marinated and crunchy. I can eat this forever.\n\nAppetizer: Bastela du Chef (Pastry filled with chicken, almonds, and assortment of spices) - Genius!! Omg this dish is sweet, savory, and crunchy. Must try! \n\nSpecialty Entree: Rabbit Kabob - Big portion, I believe I got two huge rabbit legs but I was not complaining because the rabbit by far was tender and perfectly marinated. Tastes like a leaner chicken but better :-)\n  \nDessert: King Hassan (Banana Fritter), Keneffa (Sweet Bastela with Cream and Almonds) - Cleanse your palate but also leaving you totally stuffed. The fritters were mouthwatering - can not put into words how amazingly delicious it was!\n\nTea: The A La Menthe (Mint Tea) - Wow, if you're a Boba tea lover... man-o-man, you are in for a treat. This tea is sooo good, you'll have to ask for more -- which they will refill for you!\n\nBottle service: I decided to bring my own bottles of wine since the corkage fee was not bad and the staff were so accommodating about it.  \n\nDecor: You are transformed into Morocco. Trust me.\n\nBelly Dancer: Gorgeous! we came on a perfect Saturday night! Not only was the dancer beautiful but oh so sweet. She was trying to get everyone outta their seat to dance -- of course we were quite a shy crowd. \n\nPrice: A little more than $38 per person because of the wine, tax, and gratuity. Totally understandable. I would bring about $50-60. \n\nOverall, don't be fool by reading mixed reviews on yelp, check it out for yourself. You will be amazed like I was!

Combine this with an afternoon at the Legion of Honor, a sunset hike along the path above the mouth of the Golden Gate, then walk back on Lincoln (unless you brought a flashlight!) for dinner and a show at El Mansour.

The people who run this place don't know how to create a good atmosphere for customers to enjoy the good Moroccan food.\nThe food here is not cheap.

When we first walked into El Mansour, we felt like we were in a totally different city. The colorful fabrics and unique tile-work surrounding the entryway definitely left a great first impression. The ambiance is cozy with dim lighting and music playing throughout the night. \n\nThe menu is divided into \"Specialties\" ($36.50) and \"Entrees\" ($34.50). The specialties include cous cous and vegetables, but the rest of the sides are the same. I ordered the chicken with honey and prunes, and my boyfriend got the seafood special with shrimp and scallops.\n\nThe entire meal took around 2 hours, with a total of five courses. We ate with our hands the entire night, which was pretty amusing. Our server came by often throughout the night with a huge plate of warm, fluffy bread, which we totally used as our utensils. My favorite part of the meal was the Bastela du Chef. Flaky phyllo dough with chicken and almond filling, with powdered sugar sprinkled on top...yum! I am a huge fan of sweet and savory, so this was an A+.  \n\nThe rest of the food was delicious and well prepared. The chicken was tender and moist, and I loved the flavors of the honey and prunes. (again with the sweet and savory!). My boyfriend's shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly, and I kept sneaking bites from his plate. However, I wasn't a huge fan of the fried bananas as the dessert. They were a little too mushy for me. \n\nWe also loved our waiter. He was amazingly attentive and he truly made our dining experience special.

They were as follows:\n\nLentil Soup: It was good, it tastes almost identical to the one mother makes. If only she knew I was paying $15 for this soup with homemade bread.\nThe Salad: The flavors all come together very nicely! My boyfriend had to explain what each sauce was but I devoured everything.\nThe Bastila: I was not a huge fan to be honest. I'm not someone who likes mixing my sweets with the salties. I guess the combination of both the chicken and the powdered sugar with drizzled chocolate caused confusion in my mouth? However, our waiter did say it was pretty popular? I might be a weirdo? \nThe Lamb & Chicken: SO GOOD! The chicken and lamb filled my mouth with SO MUCH TENDERNESS! I did not expect that at all. Very rich in flavor as well.\nDessert: Absolutely delightful! Not too sweet, the crunchy exterior with the soft gooey hot banana made me feel all tingly inside.\nMint Tea: The perfect ending to the meal, you sit there in utter comfort and bliss, sipping your tea, admiring the view...smelling yourself because you have just been blessed with rose water...\n\nI like how La Mansour spaces your dinner accordingly so that by the end of your meal you aren't left with a bloated stomach. \n\nIn the end, it's not that pricey if you put it in perspective, all this would cost you about the same if you ordered appetizer, entree and dessert at any other restaurant.", "author": "Jenna D."}

I enjoyed the little details that made this place stand out for me - at the start of the meal they wash your hands in a Moroccan handwashing tass and from there you eat the whole meal with your hands. \n\nThe four course meal is definitely the way to go - the starting lentil soup is hearty and full of flavor, the salad is alright, and the pastilla (meat pie) is phenomenal! I admit my tastebuds were a little confused to be tasting chicken and powdered sugar (what? who thought of that one?) in the same bite but somehow it worked. For the entree my date got the lamb with honey & almonds (again, the sweet and savory factor was a little weird here for me but it wasn't bad) and I tried the rabbit with grilled vegetables. The rabbit was great, not dry at all like I was dreading it to be.

You will be entertained by a beautiful belly dancer and fun waiters.  The food is delicious too!\n\nFIVE STARS for the wonderful belly dancer!  Not only was she beautiful but she also has plenty of talent.  The woman can dance while balancing objects on her head!  At one point she danced while balancing a cane on her head.  Later in the evening, she danced while balancing a vase on her head!  Truly amazing! :)\n\nEl Mansour provides a fun atmosphere and a simple menu.  There are two set menus that are reasonably priced: $34.75 (for the specialties menu) or $31.75 (for the entrees menu).\n\nMy friend and I ordered from the Specialties menu.  Dishes and comments below:\n\n**Starters**\n(1) Harira Soup(Spicy Lentil Bean Soup)\nYummy - they serve this with their soft but densely packed house-made bread.  Moroccans take pride in their bread - you will not be disappointed.\n\n(2) Salade Mohammed V (Combination of Tomatoes, eggplant, carrots & cucumbers)\nThis refreshing dish is filled with light spices and perfectly cooked veggies.\n\n**Mid-course**\n(3) Bastela du Chef (Pastry filled with chicken, almonds, and assortment of spices)\nChicken and all of the above encased in a light and crispy filo dough with powdered sugar on top.  This is pretty good but I've had better elsewhere (in Morocco).  The Bastela is one of the better known dishes in Moroccan cuisine.  Had this dish blown me away, I would have given El Mansour 5 stars.  Yeah, I know, I am a tough judge. :)\n\n**Main Course**\n(4a) Moroccan Seafood (Prawns and scallops)\nIf not prepared well, prawns can taste very plain and overcooked.  It is certainly NOT the case at El Mansour!  Succulent and juicy prawns and scallops with just the right amount of sauce.\n\n(4b) Lamb & Chicken (with almonds)\nThe lamb meat falls off the bone - yeah, it is THAT tender!  Prompts to the chef for this dish.  Lamb meat can taste very gamey but not the lamb meat in this dish!  The chicken is very tender too.\n\nThe main courses come with Couscous and Vegetables, which are absolutely delicious! Wish I can make couscous taste this good.\n\n**Dessert**\n(5) King Hassan (Banana Fritter), Keneffa (Sweet Bastela with Cream and Almonds)\nNice and light dessert to complete the dining experience.\n\n**Moroccan Mint Tea**\n(6) The A La Menthe (Mint Tea)\nIt is quite an experience to watch how tea is poured into glasses in Morocco.  El Mansour has replicated that art right here in San Francisco.  The mint tea is really good too.\n\nIf I ever want to entertain a group of people, I will definitely bring them here for dinner.

It is decorated to give the impression of being in a big Middle Eastern tent, the servers are dressed appropriately, and there is belly dancing (if you are not a fan, make an early reservation, since the belly dancing starts around 7:30). All entrees come with the same (lovely) appetizers, including a lentil soup, and a savory chicken pastry. Of the entrees I've tried, I favor the lamb with lemon and olives, and the chicken with honey and prunes. The wine list is just okay, so you may opt to bring your own, and pay the corkage fee.", "author": "Jethro B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-03-13", "description": "This is the first time I came here, intrigued by the fact that a belly dancer would perform while you eat! \n\nThere are two shows that go on in the evening, 7:15 and 9ish. Even with reservations, be prepared to wait half an hour or more. Since I had come here on an occasion to meet with old friends, it didn't matter to me, but did concern other there since it was a bit chilly outside. \n\nThe decor is something special, curtains and vibrant colors; it really tries to be a unique Moroccan experience. The seats are stumps and a comfy couch that runs along the walls accompanied by a low round table to eat on. Seriously, there were details down to the small tiles that ran along the hallway to the bathroom (which I actually think looked like chess pieces, what can I say, I had a little to drink). The waiters are dressed the part as well. The belly dancer was gorgeous wearing a jeweled costume and had moves. She would interact with you and try to get you to come up to dance with her, which is hilarious since belly dancing is quite a talent. (I'll post a picture).\n\nThe place is great for groups, the meals are usually served in a family size of about 4. The food is pricey, I'll admit that. I really have no idea what the names are of the things I've eaten, couscous, lamb, shrimp, some kind thing that had powdered sugar, etc. but all I need to say is that it was so surprisingly good that I didn't mind the cost. Definitely a must try once (or more) in your lifetime. \n\nThe delicious mush of food is meant to be dug into with your hands!  Unsanitary? not entirely.. someone will come around to do a sort of hand washing ceremony with a tea kettle AT your table before and after you eat (second time with fragrant rose water), so you KNOW your neighbor about to dig into YOUR food has \"washed\" his hands. Be warned, since food is pricey and this place is so unique, about every 15 minutes, the birthday tune would come on for 9 out of 10 groups present. Man oh man, was a bunch of people born that day... \n\nTotally would recommend this as a surprise event for a group of people like a birthday or graduation or some sort. I just wouldn't bring really young kids since the belly dancer is only clothed so much. If you mind that kind of thing. But the food is still awesome! Just bring blindfolds.....", "author": "Angela L."}

The food was great, the service was attentive and friendly, the bellydancer was beautiful and entertaining. Overall it was a fantastic night.\n\nI loved the pace of the courses. The servers didn't try to rush us they were really good about getting the food out when we wanted and letting us eat more slowly through a few of the courses. \n\nHonestly there weren't many things that I disliked. I wasn't a fan of the Salade Mohammed V, but that was solely because I don't care for pretty much any of the ingredients. \n\nThe Harira Soup was a fantastic way to start the meal. It was flavorful and warm which was appreciated on such a cool summer night. \n\nThe Bastela du Chef was surprising to me. I'd never had it before and was a bit confused by the cinnamon and powdered sugar on top of what the server had said was a pastry with chicken and almond filling. But it was great. The pastry was flaky, the filling was yummy and it surprisingly worked great with the sugar and cinnamon. \n \nThe meal ended with a banana fritter that was great. Nice and warm with a great fried dough. It was just enough sweet without being to much to end the big meal. It was served with a mint tea that I also enjoyed. Sweet and minty and warm before we headed back out to the cold. \n\nThere were three people in our party so we chose to dine 'family style' so we could try the different specials instead of getting stuck with just one. It was a great idea because some of the best things I wouldn't have ordered on their own. The kabobs we delicious especially the lamb. Lots of spice and very tender. I was originally planning to get the Moroccan Seafood platter and while I wouldn't have been terribly disappointed with that choice it definitely wasn't my favorite. The scallops were great but the prawns weren't anything special. The almond lamb ended up being one of my favorites. Another in our party didn't like it and mentioned she thought it was a bit dry. The piece I tried though was incredibly juicy and falling off the bone. \n\nThe entire night was fun and definitely made for some great memories. \n\nA few things to keep in mind:\nif you get a soda, the refills are NOT free!\nIt's far from downtown and finding a cab is next to impossible (drive!!!)\nIt's really easy to miss if you're not sure where it is so use GPS and look for the big blue door.", "author": "Ashley T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-02-14", "description": "Al Mansour balances kitsch and authenticity, and dining here is a recommended experience.  The decor is quite fabulous--right out of Arabian Nights--with low tables, tent-like walls, and draped ceilings.\n\nThe menu isn't terribly diverse--coucous, lamb and chicken with some combination of lemon, olives, honey, almonds or onions make up the lion share of the menu.\n\nDining at El Mansour is a leisurely experience. First comes a server with a kettle of heated water to pour over your hands for cleansing. Then soup with no utensils--soak it up with bread or lift the bowl to your lips. Then comes a family-style salad, which I found a bit difficult to eat without utensils.  Next comes the entr\u00e9e, at which point our party gave up and opted for utensils.  Desert is included in the meal.\n\nWe found the food very tasty.  The lamb and chicken were delicious and very tender, falling off the bone.  \n\nThe experience is enhanced with a belly dancer performing once an hour.  She was pretty amazing and interacted well with the diners, but I had two complaints:  First, during her 15-minute extended dance the music was  almost painfully loud. Secondly, the final song involves people tucking dollar bills into her bedazzled bra or revealing harem pants; perhaps this is a tradition in Morocco but it felt a bit too strip-club for the family restaurant.", "author": "Augie R."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-01-12", "description": "According to Yelp, there are currently 8 restaurants in San Francisco that serve Moroccan food--only 5 of them feature Moroccan cuisine exclusively. \n\nEl Mansour is the only one of these 5 restaurants that I've been to (twice), and furthermore the only Moroccan food I've ever eaten. So right off the bat, I wasn't sure exactly how I should rate it, since I don't really have any other experiences with Moroccan food to compare it to. \n\nSo being the Yelp dork I am, I did a lil research...\n\nUnlike some of its competitors in the city (which serve items ala carte), El Mansour ONLY offers complete dinners, which I've gathered in Moroccan terms means a lavish, leisurely 5-course meal. Price-wise, here's how it matches up with the other restaurants that also do it this way: \n\nEl Mansour: 5-course meal, $28.75 / $30.75\nRadio Africa & Kitchen: 4-course meal, $40 (not exclusively Moroccan)\nAziza: 4-course meal, $50\nPasha: for parties of 6 or more (\"family style\" meal), $35 / $49\nMarrakech: \"full dinner,\" $34.95\n\nSo comparatively, El Mansour's prices for the complete dinner are by far the most reasonable. \n\nStill, even at their rates going here last weekend for my friend's birthday was not exactly a CHEAP experience for me. But with that said, we all know that price ain't the only thang that makes a place what it is, and all around I've really enjoyed my experiences at El Mansour. It's given me a great impression of Moroccan food (chicken bastilla! yum!) and an appreciation for its showy presentation--ie, feeling like you're sitting in Genie's lamp, handwashing with rose water at the table, eating with the hands, the grandiose pouring of the mint tea at the end of the meal, etc. The location of the restaurant is also good for people who have cars (plenty of parking that far down on Clement and Geary) or those who live in the Western neighborhoods. Just be prepared, if you have a large party (which is the way to go here), to drop at least 40 bucks on dinner.\n\nOh yeah, the only thing we felt could have used some work in the presentation was the belly dancer... it's not that she was bad, but after her short performance she walked out the front door with her rolling suitcase and regular clothes! Yeah, yeah, I know she's just a normal person, but come on, it ruins the magic just a little...", "author": "Kate V."}

Decided to come here with a friend because of the $50 off coupon that i got from restaurant.com. Although you get $50 dollar off, it was still expensive but it was worth it. When you walk into this restaurant, it looks like you are in another world. the decor here/table setting are different from most restaurant. There are 4 section of seating areas. The cushion seating chair are connect to the wall more like a lounge u sharp with few tables. Each tables has a candle which makes it more a romantic feeling. And it has a color clothes  and lights hanging on the sealing wall above. Their floor are actually carpet.  \n\nYou get about 5 course meal, tea, and a free belly dance show while eating your meal. If you want to see the belly dancer, you have to call ahead of time so you'll know what time they are dancing. Its entertaining to see the belly dancer while you are enjoying your food. You can also dance with the belly dancers when she comes to your table. The dancer of the night i went was a really good dancer.\n\nIts cool how you get your tea. The waiter comes to your table with teapot and then start pouring the tea to your cup while holding the teapot as high from his crest area. The tea is warm and sweet.\n\nBefore you start eating your dinner, the waiter wash your hands for you with warm water and then gives you a towel to dry your hands.\n\n1. First course is spicy lentil bean soup. You can eat it with bread if you want too. I like this soup a lot since it has the hearty flavor. \n2. Second course is the salad. This dish i believe you eat with your hands. But you do have breads to help you pick up the vegetables. This dish is also tasty\n3. Bastela du chef: it has this powder on the outside which make this dish very sweet. It has great flavor, soft and textures of the bread from the chicken, almonds, and spices.\n4. My main course was lamb & brochette kabob with vegetables. By this time you start to get full from all the appetizer you had. During the main course, you have an option to eat it with your hands or with utensils. My friends and i decided to eat with our hands. It has a lot of flavors from the spices and other sauces that they put into this dish. This dish is not quite big but it was still delicious. You can eat it woth bread too to dip in the sauce. After this i think you wash your hands again. \n5. Lastly its the dessert. Its the king hassan which is the banana fritter and keneffa which is the sweet bastela with cream and almonds. Their dessert was so yummy. Its sweet and flaky especially from the taste that they add to the dessert.", "author": "Julie N."}

The decor is exactly what I'd expect the inside of a genie lamp to look like. I was expecting it to be a little bigger but there was just one room with a few large seating areas. It's an easy place for a group dinner since everything is prix fixe. For around $34-$36 per person you get a lot of food: soup, salad, a chicken pastry, your meat selection, fried bananas, and mint tea. \n\nThe soup and salad were fine. The bread they give you is pretty plain. I think it's funny they don't give you a flatbread instead to go with it since it would be a lot easier to pick up the food. The chicken pastry was yummy; a good balance between sweet and savory. Instead of picking one meat our waiter said we could do sampler platters between every 3/4 people. It allowed us to try a variety of chicken, lamb, and a little bit of seafood. Everything was pretty tasty and the meat was much more tender than I expected. I especially enjoyed the lamb kabobs, chicken with onions, lamb with almonds, and the scallops.\n\nThe belly dancing portion was fine, but I was hoping there would be multiple dancers.

Mostly because of the giant gold door (I have yet to be disappointed by anything that shiny). So I decided that a 12 person birthday party would be a great occasion. I called to make reservations 3 weeks before the event, and after a few back and forth between the owners (very sweet) and myself we had everything arranged for 8:00pm on an upcoming Saturday. \n\nHere is where El Mansour loses a star in my book. We arrived at 8:00 to a packed house, so much so that we couldn't all stand inside to wait to speak with a hostess. So while my party was waiting outside in the cold, I waited for 15 min before anyone came up to see what I may want. Although they seemed familiar with my name and the very large party I had reservations for, they told me it would be a little while. Being understanding I said ok and that we would be outside when the tables are ready. One HOUR later our party was able to sit down. It's a party of 12 - with reservations set 3 weeks ago, not cool. Also we did get a brief \"thanks for waiting\" but nothing was offered as an apology for the horrendous wait in the cold. \n\nWith that said, the evening turned out very pleasant. We all ordered different dishes and everyone was pleased with the quality and taste of the food.  I think by far the overall winner was the Bastela du Chef which is a phillo-like pastry filled with chicken and spices. I had the rabbit which was phenomenal (and for $32.75 for a five course dinner, is very reasonable). My Husband tried the Lamb with Honey & Almonds which was amazing. \n\nThe service is not great (ie if you ask for some hot tea, because you are cold from the hour long wait outside, you'll have to ask a couple more times before anyone brings you anything)  - but you have enough distractions (like the belly dancer) to not really notice. \nSo overall El Mansour gets 2 Stars for great food, 1 star for great ambiance,  1/2  a star for great  price, and  1/2 a star for service (benefit of the doubt, will try again). I would love to give this place the full five stars, but between the service and the HOUR long wait (with three week standing reservations) I simply can't.", "author": "Katya B."}

Right off the bat Customer service was attentively wonderful and we were greeted by very friendly servers. More than half of our party was late but they were accommodating nevertheless. Parking was surprisingly easy compared to the traffic on the way there. \n\nFrom my recollection (of what I recall anyway) I remember we ordered a 6-7 course meal starting with the lentil soup and bread which was delicious! I didn't hesitate to ask for my bread as I soaked it in the aromatic savoriness. After this the hummus and assortment of vegetables were brought in on silver platters, let the belly dancing begin!! We were thoroughly enjoying ourselves laughing along as our bottles of wine came. Our group wanted to take photos with the belly dancer and it was apparent my opinion didn't matter at that point, rather it was ignored. Each of us tipped the dancer generously, she gave a great performance! we were entertained.\n\nAs the remaining courses of lamb, fish and veal were gobbled up we felt more and more satisfied. Our server was not only charming but easy on the eyes ;-) and assisted us in taking our pictures. He even offered to help cool our huge bottle of champagne as we waited for dessert :). After dessert  he brought the bottle out and we insisted he join us in the celebration. Perfect gentleman. \n\nThe evening was filled with laughter, hugs, appreciation and humor.

Don't let the name fool you. It's not Mexican.. its Moroccan. And way out in the Richmond (San Francisco). \n\nFrom the outside, El Mansour is pretty much average looking; but from the inside, its a whole different story. Dark and cozy floor to ceiling ethnically printed fabric envelopes you and entices you to enter. Hold onto your passport -- it's as if you've stepped out of the desert and into a Sultans tent.

The flavor and texture is very unique and quite exotic. Paired with their wines and dancing girls, El Mansour dining makes for an excellent tasty and entertaining event filled evening. \n\nhttp://www.elmansour.com/index.php?p=Page_Wine\n\nAll in all i think I won the respect of the bachelor party, and quite enjoyed myself as well. \n\n4 Woofs, I'd definitely come back to this place, and I'd recommend the dancing fo sho!

The meal begins with the washing of the hands ceremony, a delicious lentil soup with warm bread arrives first, then a flavorful yet simple salad, followed by an amazing chicken pastry with almonds, spices and a lightly sweetened pastry shell. For our main dish we braved it and ordered the chicken with prunes and honey. It sounds strange, but it was so good! We also tried the lamb kabobs with the lamb shank, also very good. The belly dancer who performed during our meal was quite engaging and entertaining. I loved how she got both men and women up to learn a few moves.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-21", "description": "El Mansour's food is what anybody can cook after a week with, say, a \"Moroccan Food for Dummies\" recipe book.  \n\nThe lentil soup is, effectively, the end result of a good hour's of cooking time, some canned broth, and a few dried herbs.  It's not spicy at all.\n\nSalad Mohammed V:  if the great Sultan ate this, then surely the leisurely life of North African royalty is not all it's cracked up to be.  Every component is seriously lacking in elemental spice and flavor; especially the eggplant which reads watery and even a bit undercooked.  It's served on a chintzy bit of lettuce and, frankly, the cucumbers were the standout on this drab plate.\n\nThe filling for the \"bastela\" is simply bone-dry shredded chicken, not integrated at all into a proper pie.  It's a mess; there's a desperate attempt to mask the bland mediocrity with excessive sweetness and cinnamon.  \n\nThe fish tagine is a hot mess.  There's sea bass that isn't even properly de-scaled; you get a few fun surprises in every bite.  The fish tastes a bit rank, either because of questionable freshness or the simple fact that an oily fish like sea bass doesn't play well in an oily sauce.  \n\nGood couscous is fluffy; the grains are distinct from each other; it's moist without being gloppy.  Theirs is anything but.  It's served with what looks like a mashed potato scoop -- the inevitable result is to retain too much heat and moisture in the dense middle, and to produce a mushy texture.  \n\nAnybody who's even made couscous from a box knows it needs to be fluffed prior to serving; ideally it's spread out on a plate to promote an even heat distribution and release of moisture.  This approach is borderline insane coming from a _Moroccan_ restaurant.\n\nThe chicken is competently done, if not having any characteristic spiciness.  The lamb seems to have been done in a pressure cooker, which means it's tender but hasn't had time to integrate the flavors of a proper Moroccan stew.  Again, there's no spice; it's basically just a braise in salted water with just a hint of what it could be.\n\nKing Hassan apparently had a thing for banana fritters.  Who knew?  Or perhaps it was just made up by the owners.  Regardless of His Royal Taste, who wants a banana fritter alongside a sweet \"bastela\"?  I don't know, but it's there.  The basic strategy seems to be to multiply the number of fritters by the number of guests.  This is crowd control, not dessert.\n\nAnd there's mint tea to finish the meal, certainly the highlight after so many obvious missteps.\n\nTo put it bluntly, El Mansour is to Moroccan what your typical Hibachi Grill/teppanyaki joint in suburban America is to Japanese food.\n\nThe basic strategy seems to be to substitute the flair of belly dancing and a bit of a bachelor party atmosphere for authentic and well-executed Moroccan cooking.  \n\nThat's a shame.  \n\nGreat Moroccan food is extremely soulful, one of the best cuisines in the world.  It should be enjoyed in its own right because it's delicious and, by its nature, it should be relatively inexpensive.  I don't have any problem with enhancing the experience of \"mere\" Moroccan food with entertainment or a festive atmosphere.  But the food should be given its due respect, and the experience should be built around great food first, because that is the bedrock of any such cultural exchange.", "author": "J W."}

You totally get what you pay for and won't leave hungry...but definitely make a reservation!\n\nFor my entree I had the chicken with raisins and onions, which was quite delicious.  The meat fell off the bones and had just the right combo of sweet and savory spices.  I loved everything else that came with it too.  The appetizer was kind of like fried dough (think carnival) with chopped \nup chicken.  It might sound a bit odd, but I couldn't get enough.\n\nThe only thing a little lacking, which surprised me based on the other reviews, was the service.  Several parties around us, which were seated after us, had their orders taken and received food more quickly than we did and we never even got salad plates.

First he tried to tell us they didn't accept them, then he asked us if we bought it in Europe (wtf?) and after a very long battle, he finally gave in... but we really had to work for our discount (that we paid for). Yeah, not pleasant.. didn't get the vibe that he wanted our business next time. BTW, our waiter was really nice, it was the owner who spoiled it all.\n\nNow about the food. The mint tea (served at the end) was pretty good. But it comes with sugar, so if you are not into super sugary drinks, don't forget to mention that before hand.

The highlights were definitely the sweet mint tea at the end of the meal and the belly dancer. The interior of this place was really unique, and I love how they spritzed our hands with rose-oil infused fragranced water at the end so our hands smelled nice. I didnt care too much for the food, but not from lack of appreciation of ethnic food. I love ethnic, and am actually a huge fan. \n\nI just didnt like the way the food was prepared I guess. We went in a group of 4 and ended up sharing most of our food since everyone ordered something different (all of it was recommended by our server). Most plates had too many bones or too much sauce and I couldn't really enjoy it. I usually love pastilla but I didnt even like that. Really sucks because we went for a group member's birthday, we were dressed really nice, some of us danced with the belly dancer and were in a totally festive mood but the food was a turn off. \n\nThe wait staff was excellent (minus the recommendations), the interior and location were nice, I even liked the idea of the 4 courses especially tea at the end. Overall though, I will not go back because there are way better Moroccan food restaurants in the bay area that aren't as overpriced. This occasion in particular though, the prices weren't an issue since we were going all out and wanted to indulge in somewhere nice. Anyhoo, it was a nice experience at least.", "author": "Ria R."}

I ended up spending almost $100 for a sub-par meal for two people. The restaurant itself is cute with comfortable seating. However, the food left a lot to be desired. My boyfriend and I ordered the pre-fixe menu. It begins with a lentil soup that tastes exactly like Campbell's canned soup-- not terrible, but not great either. The next course was the Bastela du Chef. That was delicious and ended up being the highlight of the evening, but it was all downhill from there. The entrees that we ordered (lamb and chicken) were incredibly oversalted. I like salty things, but I really couldn't eat mine. Also, the rose water hand washing that they do at the table ended up burning my boyfriend's hands because the water was scalding. The restaurant would do well to let the water cool a little lest they injure someone else. \n\nAs for the bellydancer...I have to give her credit for courage. She clearly did not know how to actually bellydance, but was trying her best. I blame the restaurant for not hiring someone qualified for that position.\n\nOverall, I would never go back.", "author": "S. C."}

I just finished reading some other people's complaints and I have to say that I disagree completely.  The food is A+ as well and the service is second to none.  I've never been anywhere else where servers come and essentially assist you in washing your hands with jasmine scented water...i mean whoa!!!!  I always get the lamb plate because it's so good and it never gets old.  The belly dancers have always been incredible and the newest girl is an amazing dancer and very beautiful to boot.  I read a few other reviews that made reference to the owners/workers being Asian.....really?  How do you know they are owners let alone what their nationality is simply based on some biased opinion you formed on how they look TO YOU?  I certainly don't and I've been eating here for over 5 years.  I know the guy that is being referenced and he is always very polite and does his best to help people.....what does it matter that he (in you personal opinion) does not look Moroccan enough?  Jeez!!!! LOL!!!!  Sometimes the comments on here just irk me so sorry for the rant.  Regardless this is a great place to take a date....both you and your partner will not be disappointed.... and best believe I will continue to eat here and refer people here also.\n\n***FYI  I should mention that if you make a reservation you still may not be seated at the time that you were told to arrive.  This is because there is limited seating, but then  again this only has happened to me on busy days like Valentines Day....but what place isn't busy on that day?

If you've read any of my other reviews, you might already know that I am not a fan of places where I have to shout in the face of the person standing next to me in order for them to hear me, however this was so bad that the people I was with were noticeably irritated as well.  Thankfully it turned out that this was only for the belly dancers performance and they turned it down at the conclusion of her dance (which was lovely by the way).  My relief cannot be expressed in words.\n\nOnce the music was turned down and we went over the wine and beer list we chatted and waited for them to take our drink orders.  And waited, and waited.  After being there 15-20 minutes we finally managed to grab a waiter and force him to acknowledge our existence.  Much to my husband's dismay they were out of the only Moroccan beer they had.\n\nOnce the rest of our party got there we did the hand washing and they began serving the courses.  I'm not going to waste much time reviewing their food because there's really not a lot to say.  It was very bland.  I liked the skewered lamb, but again there was no spice.  If you're someone who doesn't like spicy food then I highly recommend this restaurant.  My favorite part about the meal was the sweetened mint tea at the end.  \n\nAfter reading the other reviews for this place I didn't have highest expectations for the food, but they still managed to disappoint me.  It seems like most people go for the entertainment, which was very good.  The service, after our whole party arrived, was also quite good and everyone was very nice.  The food arrived in a timely manner and they were on top of refilling wine glasses and water glasses.\n\nI had a wonderful time with my friends and they did well with our large group of 15.  Honestly this place would be great if they got a better chef.

You're supposed to eat with your hands, apparently (we didn't know this).  They'll come with a little \"tub\" that also looks decorative and nice.

The belly dancer is gorgeous....dancing & tipping highly recommended.  \n\nWe were a party of 5 and had one in our party with an almond allergy.  They were very accomodating BUT had to be reminded twice that we needed to be almond free.   Both times they brought out (within a few minutes) an almond free version of the dish being served dish.  The third time, we didn't even bother to say anything as it was really kind of annoying that every single thing they brought had the almonds in or sprinkled on top of the dish and they had to be reminded over & over.  So, our birthday girl had to pick around the almonds sprinkled on her cake.  \n\nWe all really enjoyed the food and despite some basic flaws in service, we would all go back.\n\nOverall, the service was wonderful.  It is a slow dining experience and with 8:30 resevations, we did not leave until 11:30.  We continually got almonds on everything but all of the significant service flaws all happened in the last 30 minutes.  \n\nWe were never served our tea with dessert....kinda a bummer as we were looking forward to it but to be honest, at that point we were ready to go as service had slowed to a crawl at about 10:30.  \n\nWe were a party of 5 women and requested that they call a cab for us.  He told us that they usually won't come out to pick us up and suggested we walk over a few blocks and try to flag one down.  Ok, so maybe the cab service would have told him no, but he could have pretended to call for us.  Everyone in our party has AT&T phones and we did not have service...not very reassurring as you walk out into Outer Richmond at midnight.\n\nAnyway, I would definitely go back.  I would arrange a car service ahead of time or drive out there myself.

I'm all for anything that involves food in your hands. \n\nThe menu was limited. There was two section, the Specialties and the Entrees. Specialties was served with couscous and vegetables, soup, salad, Bastela Du Chef (this Filo pastry filled with shredded chicken and dusted with powdered sugar.. it was some BOMB ASS Bastela!), your choice of entree, dessert, and mint tea. Entrees was served with soup, salad, Bastela, dessert, and mint tea.\n\nI chose the Couscous with lamb and vegetables ($28.95). The lamb was fall off the bone and cooked perfectly. Couscous was delicious, and the vegetables consisted of cucumber and carrots. There was lots of food and I was literally gonna BLOW up by the end. \n\nThe soup was lentil soup and it was yummy. They come by often with a BIG dish of bread and you grab one to eat with your bread, salad, and entree. \n\nSalad was a combination of pureed eggplant, tomato salsa thing, marinated carrots, and cucumber.

Dessert was skippable, but I LOVE MOROCCAN MINT TEA.  I just never understand why it's served in such a tiny glass.  Leave the pitcher!  \n\nIf I were to come back, definitely hit up the kabobs!  DELICIOUS AND SO TENDER (LAMB AND CHICKEN).\n\nMake reservations and parking wasn't too bad.  Definitely check it out if you're trying to find a place for 6 or more!  Don't forget to bring some singles to tip the belly dancers!", "author": "Christine K."}

Also really enjoyed the lentil soup and quad salad-very flavorful. \n\nStasha the belly dancer was very entertaining and friendly. She tried to get everyone to dance with her...maybe if I had a glass of wine-- next time I'll order a bottle!\n\nAnd I especially loved it because I always say we need to revert to eating with our hands and walking around naked! 1 out of 2 is good enough for me.", "author": "Katie T."}

The fact that he took the time to remember who has a reservation at certain times without looking in a book or on a computer amazed me.   When I made the reservation it was through a third party site and I mentioned it was my friends birthday never expected them to even notice that little note, after dinner was over they brought her a special birthday treat without anyone mentioning it that whole evening. The food was amazing, they bring you rose water to wash your hands and those are your utensils. They supply silverware, but the fun is in doing it the way it was meant, use your hands! It was family style, which means everyone shares off a plate in the middle except for individual entrees..And the tea! The hot tea was absolutely amazing!

I've eaten at many Moroccan places in the past, and always had a ton of food, fun, and good belly dancing.  Although the belly dancing was okay here, there wasn't much for me to rave about the food.\n\nI will say that we had tasty soup, the salad was almost nonexistent in size (we had 8 people, 6 of whom paid for the full boat).  El Mansour doesn't let you order separately or have a fork, that's just not their way.\n\nInstead our paltry feast came for 6 and there was barely enough food.  For over $32 each before tax, tip, drinks, etc., there was literally a tablespoon of cous cous each instead of a huge mound.  Some of the meats really tasted good, but I would have preferred my own plate, a fork and a mound of veggies and couscous for the high ticket price.\n\nAdditionally, the photos here really make this place look great!  We thought we were in for a treat, expected a bar and full service.  What we got was a one room, sort of faux Morroccan home sewn project with the local belly dancer.  It really wasn't worth it.\n\nOh, and parking SUCKS!  No one moves their cars in this neighborhood, so plan an additional 15 minutes to find the nonexistent spot.\n\n~ Ms. Ali", "author": "A W."}

Dry your hands with an almost full-sized bath towel that also serves as your napkin.\n\nThen the course after course of marvelously spiced foods begins to arrive.  Lentil soup accompanied by home-made bread, a plate of 4 salads including carrot, tomato, eggplant and cucumber (and more bread), a hot phyllo dough wrapped sweet cinnamon chicken pie and then, if you still have room, the main course of your choice from various chicken, lamb, fish, couscous and vegetable dishes.\n\nWhile dinning, you'll be entertained by Stasha or one of her colleagues - all beautiful and accomplished belly dancers.  Make no mistake; these women are not there as sex objects rather they are friendly and non threatening hostesses who will entice you (whether you are 7 or 70) to come up and dance with them.\n\nAfter dinner, another round of hand washing (with a sprinkle of rosewater) followed by elaborately served mint tea and fried bananas.

My only disappointment was with the bread: the round, flat loaves in Morocco are heavenly and have not been recreated here.  \n\nThe most fun part of the night came when the belly dancer came out. She was beautiful and an amazing dancer. She had people from each of the groups of diners come up and dance with her, teaching us the moves.

We walk in and notice the place is full and the belly dancer is Performing, which the belly dancer was fabulous. After about 5 minutes of waiting we finally get the attention of the server and tell him we have reservations, his response was, we are full when people leave, you sit down. It was rude! So after waiting another HOUR PAST our reservation time, we finally get seated. The busser starts bringing out our drinks and the first part of our food and they had not even come and washed our hands yet. \nAll in all the service was atrociously horrible, the belly dancer was great and even got a few of us up there to dance with her, the busser was so so nice and did everything our rude, rude jerk of a waiter did not. The food was good, but very small portions. The menu also said they were going to have rabbit which we were all looking forward to trying and when our main course got there, we did not have rabbit, there was no warning of this, we had even made mention, that we were excited to try rabbit, to the very rude waiter and he never let us know we would not be getting it. The busser was the one who brought our food out to us and explained what everything was and apologized for there being no rabbit. At the end of our meal, they gave us our check and let us go on our way, not that I am into huge birthday songs or anything but that night, while we were there, we heard about 8 birthday songs to other people, I never got mine and my most wonderful sister made sure they knew it was my birthday so they had no reason not to celebrate it with me. \nThey charged us $80 in gratuity which was absolutely ABSURD seeing as though the waiter never spoke more than 10 words to us, ignored us, and the busser took care of us the whole night. We tipped the busser appropriately and changed the tip to what we thought was fair for the server and left that exact change. The restaurant had the nerve to call us (they had the phone number from the reservations that they did not honor) and tell us that we owed them more money. The server might have been mad but he did not even deserve the $20 tip that he did get. We took care of the busser and the belly dancer, they were the ones who made the night any worth while. \nThe server absolutely ruined this place for all 9 of us, which is a shame because they have decent potential, decent not great potential.\nSo I would say if you do not mind being ignored and treated like crap from a very rude waiter, and not having big enough portions for everyone in your group and do not mind leaving a little hungry still, then please have at it.

This was my first time going and my friend (the girl)  who's birthday it was picked out the place. I did briefly skim a few reviews before going and the couple of things that stood out to me was 1) the price for the food was pretty pricey and 2) they had belly dancers Now back to #1, if the food is pricey, my only concern is that it better be good and there better be a lot of it. The belly dancers we'll get to later. \n\nAnyway, we got the restaurant at about 8:15 with about 13 of us and first off this place is like a hole in the wall on Clement. It has not windows or anything, just a sign over the two painted red doors. Going inside, the waiting area is really small its about 2 feet of space and your basically just crammed in there until you get called on by the host. With 13 of us plus other parties waiting to be seated, it did kinda get crowded fast. After waiting for about 20 minutes we were finally seat on plush couches with small round tables around us. Overall the atmosphere and seating was very comfortable. \n\nFor a Saturday nite it was pretty packed and I can tell for a good reason. We ordered the food and the plates were priced around the $33-38 range. I was expecting this because of the reviews I read, so was not too worried. Overall the food was good, traditional Moroccan style dishes with scallops, chicken, lamb kabobs, uniquely made breads and of course the International beers that they carry, they really hit the spot. At the end of the nite, we racked up a bill between $700-800 or so, I did expect that as well with the amount of people we went with but at the end of the night, I was still kinda hungry and so were some of my friends. \n\nSimply put for the price, the food was good, but the amount was not. The amount of food per plate is pretty minimal, and it goes fast if your with a group of people. I understand its exotic unique delicacies and food will cost more, but that doesn't mean there should be less of it. That was probably the major thing that put me off to this place. Every dish that was brought out, I kept thinking was an appetizer, but really it was a main course dish! \n\nLastly to the belly dancer, at first I was going in with low expectations thinking it was going to be some 40 yr old chick shaking her hips, but to my surprise she was pretty hot. Just picture Hilary Swank, but not really Hilary Swank, someone probably 10 times as hot has her and without her horse teeth. The dancer was hot, she knew how to move, and put on a great show with a couple of my friends even joining in on the fun,..I would say that kinda evens out the whole food thing.

Now this restaurant is not much better than bland food court fast food.  'Salads' were dripping oily indistinguishable messes thrown together on some lettuce, had very little flavor - they all tasted the same.  Bistella was incredibly tiny - about 2 bites each, and all you could taste was the grease and powdered sugar it was smothered in.  Honey-prune 'chicken' (maybe a small cornish game hen, definitely not chicken) was well done, but drowning in a sweet gooey Chinese-style sauce and hidden under a handfull of sesame seeds.  Really?  The 'dessert' was inedible - battered, deep fried bananas that oozed oil when you touched the breading (Moroccan???) and a hard square thing with brown goo in the middle of the plate that they called kunafa (look it up - this had zero resemblance to the real thing).  Tea was warm sugar water - no tea at all - and way too sweet.\n\nThe napkins they gave are really hand towels - they were old, beat up (shredded and torn), stained and did not smell fresh.  None of the plates/dishes/glasses matched, glasses were smudged, not clean.  They brought funky forks that were corroded.\n\nWe were rushed through each course as if we were on a timer.  The minute the belly dancer was finished, the waiters were literally running to get everyone's payment.  When we tried to leave, It was hard to get outside because there so many people trying to get in at the same time.  \n\nWhat happened to the table for the entire evening, 3 hour leisurely meal,  incredibly succulent North Africa flavors?  \n\nI work hard for my money and don't mind spending $100 on dinner once in awhile, but it has to be worth it.\n\nIf anybody knows where the real chef is,  I would love to go there...won't be coming back to El Mansour.

I'm trying to be as impartial as I can while writing this.\n\nIt was very easy making a reservation a week before for a group of 9 for our work Christmas party.  We originally wanted to go to Aziza but they were booked completely for a private event.  We got to El Mansour at about 6pm on a Wednesday night and there were only two other small parties there.  Most of the night was pretty dead but I kind of liked the intimacy that our group got.  We sat in a lovely little corner on low rising sofas and little round cushioned seats.  The sofa is definitely better especially when the belly dancer comes out so you don't have to keep turning around.\n\nNow the menu was very confusing.  They have two kinds of prix fixe menus which seem somewhat similar but different in price.  While our waiter was explaining everything to us, I was thinking of the Kitchen Nightmare episode where Gordon Ramsey went to Sebastian's (if you've seen this, you will know exactly what I'm talking about): \"There are 26 different combinations... you can choose meat/seafood/veggie... you can put it in a pasta/sandwich/salad... blah blah.\"  In the end, we all chose the $32.75 menu which includes (in this order):\n\n-Harira Soup (spicy lentil bean soup): A lot tastier than it looks; not spicy at all.  Reminded me of Indian daal but much thinner.  The waiter comes with around with a basket of thick slices of bread for you to eat with it.\n-Salade Mohammed V (combination of tomatoes, eggplant, carrots & cucumbers): Very good!  The tomatoes were reminiscent of salsa, the cucumbers & carrots were crisp and refreshing, and the eggplant was more like a mushy dip.  Also comes with that same thick bread for you to top it with.\n-Bastela du Chef (pastry filled with chicken, almonds, & spices): Sweet and salty!  I've noticed that these moroccans love cinnamon on everything even on what we're use to as salty dishes.  The ground chicken filling was very tasty... and the powdered sugar & cinnamon top offset it well.  The thing with these is that it was crisp and slightly hard to break through.  Some people eat with their hands here (they don't give you forks unless you ask) but I find that with this particular dish, a fork is well needed.\n-Your choice of specialty entree (I chose RABBIT KEBAB!): Even though I've had rabbit meat before, I felt a little wrong eating this because they give you two hind legs. I could tell my rabbit did a good amount of running while he/she was alive because the meat wasn't as tender as I expected.  Texture is like chicken but the taste is definitely distinguishable.  Herbs on the outside were good but overall, the meat tasted a little off.\n-Couscous & vegetables: I'm not a fan of cous cous to begin with but this is just a small ice cream scoop full. Veggies included zucchini, garbanzo beans, and carrots.  I wished they were blanched like in the appetizer but they were cooked longer and kind of soft.\n-King Hassan (banana fritter): Tastes like the same kind you get at Thai restaurants.\n-Keneffa (sweet bastela with cream and almonds): I really like the thin layer of cream in the middle!  It's got a cool temperature and tastes smooth on your tongue.\n-The A La Menthe (mint tea): Watching the waiter pour this is more exciting than drinking it. It is VERY flowery and minty.\n\nI don't know if the belly dancer comes out at the same time every night but it was nearing 9pm or so. She was fantastic and beautiful!  Since there were only three groups there, she danced around everyone and even got some of our guys to go up there and embarrass themselves.  You can put some money in her clothing but she won't take $1 so make sure you bring some $10 bills.", "author": "Shannon L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-03", "description": "Best Moroccan food! The meal starts off with the server washing your hands in rose scented water. Then you get your lentil soup, which btw is the best, and I don't even usually like lentil soup! Next comes the salad which you will have to eat with bread as your utensils. The chicken cilicia is next, which is my favorite. It's really hot in the beginning so beware. I'm not sure what it is that makes the cillcia so good but it's sweet and salty at the same time! I usually order the honey lamb but the almond chicken is not bad either! The best part is of course the mint dessert tea and the banana fritters.\n\nThe ambiance of this place is incredible. Walking in, you will never guess what is behind those doors. I highly recommend coming to this place with friends, out of towners or even family. The couches are comfortable and the food is amazing. I will definitely be back whenever I have a chance to!", "author": "Tiffany U."}

Of course, I ordered their lamb, with eggplant this time, which was super tender and deeeelicious; like always.  I really am amazed that every single time I go their lamb (that is all I order here, as I love it!) is so tender and delicious.  They are also so nice, helpful and funny.  This time there were a couple of tiny differences.  For example, they didn't use the rosewater on the second hand washing, which I loved :( and the cups and teakettle were different when they poured the delicious mint tea.  Rooooosssseewateeer! :(  Anyway!  They, including our neighbors (sorry?), were so nice, as we had two little girls with us who were running in and out of the restaurant the whoooole time.   I do say, it is a fun place for kids, as there is a belly dancer, but perhaps ones under the age of five might find it challenging to sit for the whole time!  ;)  Still amazing!", "author": "Delicious B."}

We had no trouble getting a table for our party of 4 at 7:30 on a Friday.\n\nLoved that it's a full, multi-course meal, loved the family-style dining, loved the no silverware, loved that it's more of an experience than just a meal. I had lamb and chicken for my entree -- both so well cooked, just fell off the bone. I generally don't like eating with my hands, but this was so good I didn't care.\n\nThe service was good, quite attentive and friendly, bringing food and bread and water for handwashing and pouring mint tea into our cups from 6 feet in the air.

GREAT JUICY HEAVENS this was delicious. i would recommend having an extra order of this.\n\nthe main course consisted of various types of meat (rabbit, beef, chicken, lamb), seafood (prawn, scallop), and couscous. the meats were cooked in different styles, some with honey and prunes, some with lemon, some with almonds, some with onions, and the seafood was in a spiced light sauce that was oh-so-dreamy. we dug in with our hands, cos we keep it real. the skewered chicken and beef were beautifully moist and perfectly charred. the 'wetter' dishes were flavorful in their own right, distinct and amazing.\n\nEVERYONE WANTED THE RABBIT. got damn. so good, it hurts.\n\nfinished off with a fried banana dessert with a cream-filled pastry. gorgeous. the pulled mint tea that came with? sweet, refreshing, and rounded up the meal in boss fashion.\n\nmake reservations, folks. also, tip the belly dancer. she balances a sword on her head......TIP HER.", "author": "Eliza D."}

The waiter was also very polite and filled drinks and brought extra bread very quickly.\n\nThe environment, on the other hand, was just \"eh\".  Could have been better, could have been worse.

I was particularly caught by all of the ornate details that are everywhere and just keep going.  It's dim lights, plush seating, and enticing smells set the perfect mood for a romantic dinner or a fun experience with friends.  Where else are you encouraged to eat with you hands?!  Which, of course, goes with their table-side rosewater hand washing...a personal fav of mine.\n\nAll of the food is well seasoned, tasty, and amazing!  One of the dishes that still blows my mind is the Bastela.  A savory app of shredded chicken wrapped in phyllo and finished with powdered sugar!  Weird you say?!  No my friend, amazing!  I was licking my fingers the whole way through my lamb and chicken entr\u00e9e, the gf's scallops and prawns, and that ridiculously flaky dessert.  Top it all off with a mint tea pour that rivals the water show at the Bellagio?! ...okay so I might have exaggerated about that last bit but it is quite impressive.  \n\nThis place definitely gets my recommendation.

I absolutely loved the interior with all the rugs and tapestries.  There were no bare walls and you really felt like you were whisked away to some Morrocan dining area.  We sat in a corner near the door where there were basically padded benches situated around a table.\n\nThe food was excellent and the ambience was really warm and inviting.  The food came out in good time and to top it off, the belly dancer came out.  She was a little older but still attractive, and when she found out it was our friend's birthday, she was all over him like white on rice (see pics).  We all proceeded to get into it and took our turns dancing with the half-nekkid lady while other groups around the restaurants clapped and hollered.\n\nYou should definitely try this place out.

The belly dancer and live band always can get the crowd to interact. Even my 4 year old girls got up and got their belly dancing 101.\nYou must order the Bastela Du Chet. This sweet savory dish is so unique, there's nothing like it. It's a combination of dessert and an chicken entree in one.

I went here with my auntie and uncles and when they said \"Moroccan\" I was kinda worried because I don't usually like Middle Eastern food (and I HAAAATE Indian food). But, this style of cuisine was very mild to eat, and very fruity/sweet in some cases. Also, the mint tea at the end was delightful and expertly poured. I read on the Wiki that the Moroccan mint tea is very artistically brewed, and that the ritual of drinking it together with family is important in Moroccan culture.\n\nI think I would like to go back next time with a couple drinks in me, so that I can be brave enough to dance with the belly dancer.

Oh, but its just me and I don't care if I act a fool from my lack of hip movement and my random octopus swaying arms. \n\nAnywho, the place is gorgeous as I remember because it looked like a harem. It slipped my mind we ate with our hands, but I think the staff overheard and provided forks for one of my ocd inclinded friend.

So I anticipated the lamb here, but it wasn't too my liking.  It was better than most, but my memory had put El Mansour's lamb on a pedestal. Bummer.

All the other groups were also there for dinner since we saw birthday songs sung throughout the night, maybe 5 times.\n\nFood: Great! I had the lamb with eggplant, and it was very good. Tried my friend's rabbit and that was very flavorful. Like chicken but much better and more flavorful. The meals also came with lentil soup, salad consisting of tomatoes, eggplants, cucumbers, and carrots, bread, filo dough thing with chicken inside covered with powdered sugar, mint tea, and fried banana dessert. All were super yummy. You share the salad, dessert, and filo dough chicken thing with others. With the 10 of us, they brought us 3 plates, which made it easier.\n\nService: Great! The only weird thing was someone would come by with a basket of bread and we each grab one and then he takes the basket with him, then comes back later as we got something else that we could dip into. I guess we wouldn't overload on bread that way and it wouldn't take up too much space. They were very nice, didn't come by too often as to disrupt our meal, nor not come enough. We stayed until 11, an hour beyond their closing time, and were the last group to leave (same as Millbrae Karaoke House) and we didn't even feel pressure from them to kick us out. Just realized that all other people were gone, and my friend noted they had closed an hour earlier.\n\nBelly-dancing: The woman was great! Ok, everything is great. I know. People sitting on the outside were embarrassed and didn't look at her at times to avoid her thrusting herself on them or being asked to dance with her. Very entertaining, and boy, can she move. She danced with individual people from all the other groups, and finally came to our group. My friends wanted me to dance with her since I was the birthday girl, and I was too embarrassed and wasn't going to get up at all, so she told all the girls to get up and dance with her. Two of my friends came with me, and she re-assured me that it wouldn't be embarrassing, and it was actually a lot of fun. Just kind of made us hold hands, move our feet, spin like a ballerina, shake our hips (she said that was for the waiters! :D), etc. Glad to know she can adapt to her audiences.\n\nWhat else?

The place was crowded and I understand that there is the belly-dancing show and whatnot, but we were just sitting there and nobody really came to talk to us. No good. \n\nNext, when we were seated, the lentil soup helped me get over the initial negativity. This was probably THE BEST lentil soup I've ever had, and I love lentil soup. HOWEVER, when we asked for some more of their delicious bread (you eat the soup with this warm, spongey-but-not-moistly-so bread, not a spoon), the waiter practically shouted, \"you won't be able to finish the meal!\" and not in a joking or laughing way, but in a gruff and borderline rude way. Maybe I don't get his sense of humor, but at least show us you're poking fun at us with a smile. And even if it's serious advice (which was good advice, given how heavy the food was), please be nicer about it. And note: I was able to eat my entire meal, despite the extra bread, small Asian girl that I am. \n\nNext, they ran out of the fish on the menu, which I understand I guess, but that was kind of a disappointment for some members of our party who wanted it. I did end up getting the fish, and it was fine for me, but my other friend who got it had an extremely fishy, briny taste to her fish. Seriously, it even smelled like the ocean. Not very appetizing. My friend who wanted the fish, and who got chicken skewers instead, had better luck. The chicken was well-marinated, tender, and very tasty. \n\nI don't really remember if we got dessert, but I do remember that there was a big bottle-service fee so we didn't end up opening our wine.\n\nFinally, the belly dancing was very fun and provided for awesome entertainment. That part was definitely fun. \n\nSo overall, the food is above average, but there are lots of hits and misses, so it's kind of risky. I like consistency in the quality of my food, and I didn't find it here. Most of all, I do not like paying a hefty sum for this kind of inconsistency, so my recommendation is try El Mansour if you're in the mood for Moroccan, but be wary of some of their dishes and their service.", "author": "J.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-03-20", "description": "Overall 2 Stars for the following reasons:\n\nFood: We decided to go for the prefixed menu and got the following...\n\nCourse 1: Lentil Soup - This may have actually been my favorite portion of the meal. It was delicious, but the serving size was so small. \n\nCourse 2: Salads - This was an extremely underwhelming dish. Not only were the salads smaller than what you would normally get in a pint size at a grocery store but they were anything but fresh. To compensate for the small serving of watery salads they continuously brought over loaves of bread that was good but not anything that would blow you away. This was one of the most disappointing salad platters that I have ever had at a restaurant period.\n\nCourse 3: Moroccan Meat Pie - This is a general dish that I have had at several Moroccan restaurants. The dish is normally one of my favorites. At El Mansour it was tasty but not incredible by any means. For the first time all meal I did feel like we got a decent serving size, which was nice.\n\nCourse 4: Meat and Seafood Combination - This dish was tasty, but again nothing that would make you come back begging for more of it. The shrimp and the lamb were the best parts of the combination plate. I found the chicken to be rather dry and lacking in flavor. The presentation of this dish was easily the best of the night. Unfortunately, it just did not have enough unique flavor to it in my opinion.\n\nService: The waiter was extremely friendly and the owner was a very nice gentleman. The belly dancer was definitely and added bonus and really kept the atmosphere lively.\n\nNoise: Oh MAN! This place needs to do something about their speakers. They are outdated, project static, and are turned up way too high. Multiple times during my meal I felt like I was yelling to the person across the table.\n\nAmbiance/Setting: The overall ambiance is fun/cool, however, you can definitely tell that it is a little bit outdated. The seats were rather uncomfortable for people that are tall. I enjoyed what they were trying to do with the whole room, but again the place needs a face lift.\n\nPrice: This place is not cheap. Most likely you are looking at in excess of $50/person.\n\nOverall: In accordance with the YELP rating guide, I would describe this as a \"Meh. I've experienced better.\" Quite frankly, I do not think I will be going back as I was not tremendously impressed by the food enough to pay the price. It may be fun for a group setting because of the way that you sit, eat the food, and can watch a belly dancer. There are much better places to go in San Francisco with a group, though, that are more affordable and much more delicious.", "author": "Bennett D."}

When you see it, the restaurant seems rather small from the outside but when you get inside it is very cozy with cushioned benches and stools lining the entire restaurant. We had a 9:30 reservation and arrived a little after 9pm, the restaurant was packed and it took about 15 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were standing in the doorway, which was a bit frustrating. Once we got seated the wait staff were very friendly, they had someone come out with a kettle and bowl to wash our hands with then they took our drink and food orders. The meal was great! they start you out with a spicy lentil soup and bring out a big plate of bread that gets shared with everyone in the restaurant which was totally new to me but I went with it. Then you get your Moroccan version of salad which was chopped up eggplant, tomatoes, and some other veggies. Finally time for the main course,  I ordered the almond chicken and lamb and my husband ordered the rabbit. Both were Delicious! The lamb and chicken were so tender they were falling apart. The dishes all had just the right amount of spices, I will say though I wasn't expecting so much food! I thought the chicken and lamb would be half portions of each and man was I wrong! LOL just when my poor stomach couldn't take anymore, here comes this AMAZINGLY delectable desert! Two banana filled frittatas and another pastry with layers of light crispy goodness filled with custard. Along with the desert you are served hot green tea (as if your stomach could fit anything else in it).  In addition to the fantastic food and authentic atmosphere, you are entertained during your meal  by a belly dancer dancing  to moroccan music, crowd participation is highly encouraged :-) This place is a little bit pricey with your options being either a $32 meal or $35 meal per person, but it is absolutely worth the experience!", "author": "Amanda T."}

The Safeway bread chunks don't cut it. Eating couscous with my fingers reinforced my faith in Western Civilization. The appetizers and salad were sub-par.

They brought us a ton of food and the only dish that was good was my lamb and honey with almonds. It fell off the bone and had a ton of flavor. Everything else was pretty mediocre at best. My friend and I were able to watch a belly dancer perform (my life story) and I got to see a bunch of old people make idiots of themselves :P so it created great entertainment for the night. It was a nice touch that the servers personally wash our hands the traditional way, and they also sprinkle rose water on us after (amazing). Overall, I would probably skip this place because after being spoiled at Aziza, which is in the relative neighborhood, I can't eat anything less.

My friend had her birthday dinner here on a Wednesday night with about 20 people. Once most of her party was here, we ordered our entrees, since the appetizers and dessert were the same for everyone. \n\nBecause this is a Moroccan restaurant, you have to eat with your hands! When the soup came, there were generous amounts of bread given to each person. At first I didn't think that 1 piece of bread was enough to finish my soup so I asked for another piece. BAD CHOICE! Next course was the salad, and again more bread! The so called salad was a bunch of mush on top of a piece of lettuce. At this point, it was getting a bit hard to eat with your hands. If the salad was chunkier or had bigger pieces than I think it would be alot easier. Another dish came, which was a pastry with chicken inside... not too bad, but almost tasted like a dessert.\n\nFor my entree I had the chicken and lamb combo, which wasn't too bad. The lamb was very tender and the chicken was pretty juicy. Some of us were not use to eating with our hands, so we opted for some good ol fashioned utensils. ;) Oh, and did I mention they offer more bread?\n\nFor dessert, we had this banana fritter, which was OK, nothing special. We also had Mint Tea that was quite refreshing.\n\nThe highlight of the dinner was the belly dancer, who was very charming and interactive with everyone.

You don't do yourself justice if you evaluate this restaurant on the food alone.  From the instant you walk into the restaurant you feel like you are transported to Morocco.  You won't find any traditional tables and chairs.  Instead the restaurant has more of a lounge feel with small tables, sofas, and pillows all under a large tent.  The authentic Moroccan decor, combined with very polite service and a skilled belly dancer made me feel like I was in a Moroccan palace, not a restaurant in SF.\n\nEl Mansour's menu is impressive.  Our entrees were accompanied with lentil soup, salad, a chicken appetizer, dessert, and tea.  It's all wonderfully prepared and has some unusually great flavors.  We tried the lamb with honey and almonds on the recommendation of the owner.  It was some of the tenderest lamb I ever had and combining it with honey produced an incredible sweet and savory dish that is unlike anything I've had elsewhere.  I can say the same about all the dishes -- the flavors just pop in unique and interesting ways.\n\nThe next time you want to make a special occasion really special, think about going to El Mansour.

We made reservations in advance and were promptly seated. The atmosphere of this place is great: great decor and interesting seating. There were a few grannies in our group, so they were grateful to have couches and stools rather than floor pillows as I teased they would have (there were many jokes about picking them up using fork lifts, beached whale jokes, etc.). \n\nThe food was satisfactory:\nThe lentil soup was tasty, but as my 14 year old sister pointed out, it tasted like progresso. There was nothing unique about it in the least. \nThe chicken with vegetables that I ordered was delicious. The sauce was flavourful and the chicken was tender. While my entree was great, my father, who ordered the seafood entree has had some less than favourable results.... his stomach has been upset for the last few days. I'm just glad I'm not the one who has to clean the bathroom. My sister and I both have had some serious cumin-burps since we left the restaurant. The food was tasty, but man, does it stick with you. \n\nThe most disappointing thing about this restaurant was the wine list. They only had wine in the 30-40$ range (which equivocates to about a 10-15$ bottle outside of a restaurant, a cheapass bottle of wine for my mothers birthday). THEN, they had an oddball 300$ bottle of wine. This strange selection made it difficult to get a nice glass of wine to compliment our meal. \n\nA note about the bread: they carry around huge bread baskets and offer you a slice with every course. With a large party, I wonder why they didn't just leave the bread with us... do you not trust us with the bread? Are you worried that we're going to eat all of your bread? I don't understand. In addition, we felt very rushed into ordering. We wanted to have leisurely drinks and enjoy the atmosphere (the belly dancing was great) but the waitress insisted we order everything at once. You would think with the purchase of 12 entrees at 35$ each AND the purchase of alcohol, the waitress would be more accommodating. Our water glasses were always empty, and they didn't offer refills of soft drinks for the kids. We also noticed that we were getting the same portions of appetizers for 4 people, as some tables of 2 were getting. That wouldn't normally bother me, if it weren't for the EXTREMELY steep price of the entrees. The bill totalled to about 700$.... I would expect to leave that restaurant fat, lazy and satisfied.

I think I can safely speak for everyone and say we all had a really good time. \n\nEugy and I got there a little early and we see the first belly dancer come out. Eugy gets all excited and says something about needing to go get more dollar bills. I give him the \"don't you even think about it\" bitch stare and he quietly sits back down and waits patiently. :)\n\nFinally Aaron and the birthday girl show up (HEY SEONG!!) and we all go inside and get situated. The place is pretty large with mostly open space. I like this. There are heavily cushioned benches against the wall, knee high tables and on the other side of the tables, big cushy stools. \n\nThe service was really friendly. Spotty at times, but there were about 6 birthdays going on, all very large crowds, so it was totally understandable to be a little aloof. They weren't too bad though. Nothing to frown at, that's for sure. \n\nThe food was excellent. Flavorful, moist, just delicious. Before we ate, Aaron was saying something about eating with our hands and I really thought he was kidding. So when the course after the soup came out, I was hesitant to eat. I just sat back watching everyone else to see who was going to put their hands in first. I just knew that as soon as I put my hands in to get some food, our server would come out with flatware. He didn't, so I finally gave in and ate with my hands. \n\nFor the main course, I had the couscous with chicken. Do you know how hard it is to eat couscous with your fingers?! And just as I earlier predicted, as soon as I stuck my fingers in, trying to smoosh the couscous into edible balls, out comes the waiter with forks. YAY~!~!!\n\nLater the belly dancer came out and one of our other outgoing, intoxicated friends decided that it would be a good idea to get up and start grinding with the dancer. She reacted well and danced on with our friend. I just kept looking at Eugy with those \"don't you even think about it\" bitchy eyes. haha... \n\nOverall, this was a fantastic experience. I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs to entertain their dinner guests in an completely different way. Or dinner for large groups. This place is sure to please.", "author": "Jen D."}

The service and the owner are really welcoming and funny, making it feel like you are dining at their home.  \n\nBeing Filipino, I don't mind leaving the utensils out when dining.  Here you are encouraged to grab with your hands, share and have a good time.  Don't be suprised to see powdered sugar on top of the appeitizer, it is good mix of sweet and savor with the minced chicken between the phylo crusts.  I really feel you can't go wrong with most of the dishes, I can personally vouch for the rabbit and the olive & onion chicken.  Topping off your meal is the dessert of fried bananas and creamed phylo dough and now you are officially full! \n\nEl Mansour is a place to dine with friends and family both large or small because of the experience.

The prettiest and friendliest belly dancer I've ever met. \n\nThe bad: Service was dicey. We ordered champagne which was promptly brought to us but we had to wait another 10 - 15 minutes for them to provide the champagne glasses. There were constant reminders to the service staff for beer re-orders and at one point, we waited 45 minutes for our main courses to arrive. We asked periodically but just kept getting the same answer that the food was on it's way. There were two other large parties and they seemed to be getting their items in a timely fashion.

You enter through a traditional Islamic arch done with the medieval Spanish influenced tiles that define Moroccan architecture. Every inch of the interior is covered in rich fabric and thick oriental carpet like some sultan's tent during a mythical time between Disney's Aladdin and Operation Desert Storm. You sit on soft cushions (good for cuddling and necking, activities at least two couples were actively engaged in) and enjoy finger lickin' as there isn't any silverware (unless requested). \r\n\r\nThe food matches the dcor for exotic feel yet comfortable essence. After ceremonial hand washing at the table you are served b'steeya, essentially chicken pot pie topped with sugar and cinnamon. Good, and Homer Simpson would be down for it. Main courses are flesh-centric: hunks of lamb, chicken, fish. Closest the menu comes to challenging even the narrowest of palates is lentil soup. \r\n\r\nSurroundings and food set the stage, but Stasha is the star. The master belly dancer performs Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Displaying just slightly more flesh than your basic tenth grade female mall rat (though, she confided, wearing a G string for emergencies), Stasha raised every pulse in the room, male or female, with her sensual movements and some of the most incredible muscle control I've ever seen not involving ping-pong balls.  Important note to all Bay Area strippers: See this woman to learn what sensuality and audience interaction are all about. Don't worry - you can write it off as professional development. \r\n\r\nEl Mansour offers set courses for $27.75. Food was something between very good and good enough not harm the total experience. Quantities are large, so if you are worried about overeating don't feel like you need to finish all of every course. \r\n\r\nParking can be very tight but regulars assure me you can safely leave your car on the top story of the supermarket parking structure across the way. \r\n\r\nStasha's web site is www.stashamania.com \r\n\r\nSome general info on Morocco http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morocco\r\n\r\nTrivia: You won't find any Moroccan patterns containing people, animals, or plants, due to the tenet that only Allah can create life.", "author": "Bill S."}

Intimate romantic dinners...not so much.  Although, unlike many places which consist of a warren of themed rooms, private tents, and the like, El Mansour is just a single couch-lined room, which gives it a nice communal feel.\n\nAs Kate V's meticulous breakdown will show, the prices here are actually pretty good: $30 for a 5-course meal of soup, salad, meat pastry, entree, and dessert (oh yeah, and the best mint tea I've ever had).  And while I've certainly been to middle eastern places that combined lavish spectacle and high prices with mediocre food, I'm happy to say that everything at El Mansour was perfectly delicious.  Note that you can't order a la carte, so come hungry.  Real hungry.  \n\nAlso, at the risk of being shallow, big props for having a belly dancer that was young, attractive, and classy (not necessarily a given, I'll have you know).  Hint: If the belly dancer beckons you up and it seems cheesy or embarrassing, you're not drinking enough.\n\nThe only thing I could've asked for was that the place be more crowded (ordinarily I would never say that, but again, raucous is good at these places).

There is the requisite belly dance performance, which can get embarrassing when the dancer brings blushing patrons to the center of the restaurant to \"dance\" with her.\n\nTruly, the owners are wonderful, and from Marrakesh, I believe.  The food is a multi-course feast starting (and ending) with rose water poured over everyone's hands.  The seating is on floor cushions and the decor is beautiful, with fabric draped everywhere (fans of Edward Said, you'll hate it :-)).\n\nMy favorite dish is the bastilla, a traditional chicken appetizer with cinnamon and powdered sugar that you eat with your hands.  All of the main courses I've had are great, from beef kabobs to chicken and even rabbit.  They do have vegetarian dishes, but you'd want to skip the bastilla.  We almost always get Moroccan red wine, which is worth trying.\n\nIt's a multi-hour experience and great for almost any occasion.  Parking is on the street; you may have to park several blocks away on weekends. Don't park even an inch into a driveway, as the SF parking people are militant about that, and ending your evening down at the tow-truck place to get your car back is not fun :-).\n\nThat said, who is up for a trip to Morocco?", "author": "Diana G."}

The experience was wonderful with belly dancing, lively music, washing your hands at your table, unlimited bread, and much more. I had ordered the chicken with honey and plum sauce as my entree with the pre fix meal. he salad was incredible with a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, and a salsa type sauce along with lentil soup and my favorite of the night, the bastilla which was TO DIE FOR! Flaky on the outside, warm and tasty on the inside. Any pastry with meat inside, I am a big fan of. I would totally come back just for the bastilla alone. Our entree took awhile to come out and it was so disappointing. It tasted very odd and at 30 something bucks a person plus...I should have ordered lamb instead. The chicken was forgettable while my group, about 15, most had lamb and they all enjoyed their meals. One star knocked off for the chicken but everything and the experience was fun until the bill came out...Ouch. No more group parties for me for awhile especially when 47 bucks could have bought me pounds of pastries down the street on Clement. This place is much more for an intimate party because of the small place. My party and I did not get to converse that much. Everyone was far off away from each other while couples I noticed enjoyed everything. Gotta bring back my partner and I to experience El Mansour and actually pay 30 bucks rather than 47 bucks.

I LOVE El Mansour.  I first came here in middle school when I was 13.  It was for a friends birthday.  After that I was hooked and I eventually celebrated my 21st b-day here with my grandma, bff, aunts, and mother.  \n\nNeedless to say seeing my 79-year old grandmother tuck a single into the shimmying waistband of a 50 something year old belly dancer was priceless.  Don't get it twisted.....that lady could dance! \n\nAs for the food, that is another memorable thing.  There are like 5 courses and you share everything but the main dish family style.  They have, hands down, the best lentil soup I have ever tried and the best mint tea and chicken cilicia.  The lentil soup follows the vegetables and is only eaten with a piece of bread.  The chicken cilicia follows and is a rounded flat pie like pastry made with filo dough and in the middle is a mixture of chicken, raisins, cinnamon, and almond.  To top off this savory sweet dish is powdered sugar and cinnamon.  You break it apart with your hands, but be cautioned, it is hot when it first comes out but its GREAT. \n\nThen your hands are given a shower of rose scented warm water accompanied by a hot towel. The service is amazing.  Then you move on to the main course which will be anything from a fowl to rabbit.  Each entree is accompanied by cous cous and a sauce.  \n\nThe dessert is fried banana and some other component that i forgot but it is also amazing of course, then finally the grand finale..............mint tea is poured by a server about three feet above the cup.  The tea is one of the main reasons to come here....seriously.  Not to mention the awesome belly dancing show.  \n\nSo my night was eventful.....I was forced to dance in front of a 'tent\" full of strangers with the 50 something belly dancer as the matriarchs of my family stashed ones in her brassier and skirt......very eventful indeed.  \n\nI recommend coming here for a special occasion or a nice date, but trust me that coming with a group is more fun!!\n\nYou would think that this place would hurt your wallet something fierce but you will end up paying about $35-$40 a person including tip.  That is very reasonable since you could leave an regular place like the Cheesecake Factory and drop way more without half the fun or memorable cuisine.  \n\nYou will need reservations and I recommend planning it a week or so in advance..

We got the full meal thing family style so we were all sharing but it was more than enough food. \nYou get there and it is a very small and intimate restaurant with very comfy seating.. (you're basically sitting on a couch). The service is amazing and they start you off by washing your hands for you.. Then slowly the meals come.. the appetizer, I don't remember what it was called but was seriously one of the most amazing things I've ever eaten.. EVER! It was like meat wrapped in phyllo dough topped with powdered sugar.. And everything else was just SO good and flavorful and tasty! They served lentil soup and it was the best lentil soup I've ever eaten.\nThe belly dancing was great entertainment and you can go up and dance with the girl, she is very nice and beautiful. \nOverall, I had an amazing experience and it definitely won't be the last time I come here. \nAlso, there are no utensils to use but that's what makes it so much fun!

There were authentic Moroccan touches with the real Moroccan lamps, mosaic fountains, cushions and waiter costumes - although the Thai waiters didn't contribute to an authentic feeling (although they were nice and apparently knew the Thai husband of the Moroccan owner). \n\nFood was ok, but worse than expected. I went here after just returning from Morocco and wanted to show some friends some of the fine cuisine. Compared to the food in Marrakech (perhaps an unfair comparison), the food didn't stand up at all. I chose this place over the higher-rated Aziza because the online menu showed dishes that were actually common in Marrakech - tajines in particular- that Aziza didn't appear to have. \n\nExpecting authentic delicious food, I was disappointed that none of the dishes had very much flavor, especially the tajines that were so delicious in Morocco I practically had to be rolled out of the restaurants.  If I was judging all Moroccan cuisine on El Mansour, I wouldn't seek it out. We ordered the fixed menu which included salad that was so generic that now, 3 days later, I can't even remember what it was except that it was generic (it wasn't like real Moroccan salad, which is a smattering of 6-15 tiny plates of things like pickled beats, sweet pickled tomatoes etc.). Then came the \"bastela\" or, as they call it in Marrakech the \"pastilla\" which was the best dish at the restaurant, but again, not remotely comparable to any of the versions I tasted of this common dish in Marrakech. It is a crispy filo-wrapped crumbled chicken pastry with cinnamon and sugar on top - which is pretty hard to do badly. This wasn't bad, just wasn't good. The chicken had an odd savory seasoning that didn't go with the sweet flavors, and wasn't present in my Moroccan frame of reference. \n\nNext came the mains - rabbit tajine, fish tajine, \"chicken with lemon and olives\" (which is a tajine in Morocco but not at this restaurant) and lamb with almonds and honey. The lamb was gamey, the chicken was bland and oily and the tajines didn't have much flavor- they were clearly not cooked in the tajines as is the Moroccan custom, but were scooped into the tajine pot for presentation. One reason tajines are so good in Morocco is that the long cooking in the clay pot leaves especially yummy and spicey flavors on the sides of the stew, which was notably absent in these dishes.\n\nOverall, the experience was fun, they had a few Moroccan wines (the guerrouane red is fine of the choices on the menu), but don't judge all Moroccan food on this place. Mostly, it would be awesome if the restaurant used more of their traditional techniques to make really flavorful food so that in addition to the atmosphere, the food would leave an accurate impression of how delicious the food of Morocco is.", "author": "Ashley R."}

For someone who loves quote unquote ethnic food, it was a perfect choice. \nFirst off the atmosphere is amazing. The walls are lined with comfortable plush sofas and cushions with low, round tables about knee height. The waiters are extremely friendly and attentive. \nThe food is incredible!!! Some balk at the price, but $35 gets you a 5 course meal. Warm water and a clean towel allow you to wash up and prepare for your feast.  The first course was harira soup we sopped up with some fresh and amazing bread and our fingers. Same with the salad of cucumbers, carrots, eggplant, and tomatoes. Main course I had the lamb w/ eggplant and it was perfection. I've had meat that falls off the bone, but when I picked up my lamb, the bone fell out! Best lamb I've ever had, and the eggplant was the ideal consistency. My wife got the lamb and chicken with almonds which was equally phenomenal! Next up is a bastela, which is a chicken and almond filo pastry that is out of this world.  Finished our meal with hot mint tea and a King Hassan (banana fritter)! They have an excellent selection of wine and beer as well. \nThe entertainment, i.e. belly dancers were quite amazing as well. I can see why Herod offered half his kingdom if her performance was anywhere near that good. And while it as exotic, i never felt uncomfortable watching the show next to my wife. Very tastefully done.\nThe family who owns the restaurant sat and shared their story of how it has been passed down for 40 years. They take a lot of pride in what they do. \nIn the opinion of this reviewer, anyone who gives El Mansour less than a 4 star rating is an uncultured philistine who should go back to eating at Applebees.", "author": "David A."}

It's basically prixe fix and you choose the main course. Every menu comes with soup, \"salad\", appetizer, main course, and dessert. I believe the cheapest menu is $30/person.

We all sat down amongst the plush decor, washed our hands, ate heartily, and watched the entertainment. We warned management ahead of time that this was a bachelor party - we'd be on our best behavior, but we wanted to make sure my cousin was properly embarrassed. Sure enough, they came through, and next thing you know, my cuzz was center stage - he unleashed his inner Middle Eastern man and actually raised his arms and swayed his hips like a pro.

Birthday girl needed to get the party started anyhows!\n\nThe seating turned out rather awkward.  We did have a big group, but we ended up semi-segregated from others.  Those that sat on the outer side of the table had to sit on cushioned stools... no back support, seats kinda sunk down, and had poor access to the even lower tables.  It didn't feel very communal in the end.\n\nThe menu is set up mainly like a prix fixe.  You get a choice of entrees, and everyone gets the same soup, salad, and savory dessert.  The lentil soup was outstanding!  I always worry about lentil as it usually comes out gritty, but they slow cooked it long enough where the tiny beans just smooshed in between each sip.  The salad was a trio of cold vegetables mixed with a unique spiced dressing.  It wasn't very delectable for me.  Came off as bland and texturially confusing.  Most of it was raw and too chunky.  Oh and all of this is served with Morrocon bread, which I found a bit bland.  Good for sopping up sauce though.\n\nI ordered the sea bass entree.  It was very flavorful, but a fellow diner who knows his seafood noted that it wasn't the usual rich, fatty Chilean sea bass.  So I kinda missed that oily silkiness of the fish.  But the tomato salsa and the lemony sauce was a good meld over the sea bass.\n\nDessert was pretty intersting.  They serve what is called a Bastela du Chef, a flat pastry filled with chicken!, almonds, and sugar.  Very good, but difficult to eat as everything kinda spills out in crumbles.  Their mint tea was like sugar water.\n\nThe belly dancer was a little awkward for me.  It's fun and interactive, sure, but she looked like an older version of that \"I Dream of Jeannie\" lady.  Not for me, sorry ma'am!  But it was great for my sis who got up and shook her milkshake.  \n\nThen later on the belly dancer danced around looking for tips like a stripper!  Huh?  These people aren't getting any titty massages, and you even get offended when they try to slide it into your belt.  Save it for the pole workers.  And what do you expect the guys to do?  Put it in your little coin purse?\n\nVisit once for birthdays or bachelor/ette parties.  Their atmosphere is better than their food.", "author": "Chris T."}

Dancing! \n\nThe first time I entered El Mansour a few weeks ago, I stepped inside what seemed to be a big family event. Lots of laughter, music, and happy conversations rang through the air. I decided not to stay as I was alone --but vowed that I would have to come back with a friend. \n\nMy friend and I were seated at the table furthest from the door (near the entrance to the bathrooms and kitchen) and at first he took his seat against the wall while I sat across from him on the ottoman. In just a few minutes I realized that the ottoman was not going to be very comfortable and was invited to join my friend against the wall by our neighboring diners who were sweet enough to offer to move their table closer to ours if it would help us be more comfortable! \n\nWhen I first looked at the menu, I was a little intimidated by the prices -- $25 seemed like a lot for an entree -- but after reading further and realizing that the appetizer, salad, tea, bread, and dessert were all included, I relaxed. \n\nThe food was incredible. Very tasty - flavorful spices without the heat of \"spicy\" food. Like others, I was a little put off by the appearance of the eggplant and other veggies which I was expected to eat with my hands -- I saw a few other diners with forks, but I was determined to try it! Delicious! Using the bread made some of the smaller, looser things easier to eat and added some variety of texture. \n\nThe belly-dancing was a surprise. The music became louder and we weren't sure what was happening (maybe someone's favorite song? A birthday?) - but were very quickly put at ease by Stasha the belly dancer. She is charming, she is beautiful, and she's a very warm soul! After only a few minutes, she had warmed up the room. Separate parties of two and three diners became part of the same family -- we were all sharing a meal and experience together. \n\nThere were some kids - but all were well-behaved. Someone's precocious little boy was the first to tip the dancer (as she playfully backed away from him while he was trying to place the bill into her costume -- and then he ran from her as she attempted to give him a kiss!) to the amusement and delight of all! \n\nIf you've never tried Moroccan food, be brave and give it a try here at El Mansour. If you like Greek or other Mediterranean food styles, you will find the flavors familiar (although the combinations are quite unique!). You will not be disappointed. The staff was very friendly and helpful and made the experience very comfortable. Don't be put off by the idea of belly-dancing during dinner -- Stasha goes out of her way to make the experience a delightful one that's fun and family-friendly. \n\nA+ for atmosphere (a wedding tent with room for all) \nA+ for entertainment (music varies from quiet background noise permitting conversation to louder during the belly-dancing) \nA- for food (great tasting, excellent combinations, maybe a little more variety) \nA- for value (the portion was a little small on the mixed seafood, but the other choices seemed larger -- plus you won't leave hungry with the soup, salad, appetizer, and dessert!) \n\nTry something new and have fun at dinner!", "author": "Josh S."}

Neither of us are knowledgeable about Moroccan food, so we can't really give a comparison, but we both enjoyed the food, and how the courses were spaced, very much.\n\nThe atmosphere in there is very nice and friendly. The lay out of the place makes it easy for the different groups to interact, but you aren't sitting all over each others. It was a slow-ish night though, I don't know what it's like when the place is packed. \n\nOnly complain is that there were no dancers. They had a problem with the sound system today, so they could not play the music for the performance. That in itself is forgivable, though one would think they would get somebody in there to repair since it's their trademark really. What is less forgivable, is that we were never notified of the fact. We waited for a while, until we finally asked (after we paid and everything) and the waiter finally admitted the problem. For the price you ask my friend, that should have been said at the beginning, and a discount offered or something to make up for the fact.\n\nThe service and the food was too good for that to ruin the night, but that was really unfortunate.", "author": "Willow K."}

This is not your place if you're not comfortable with eating off the same plate as others and with your hands. You can request forks or attempt to scoop up mushy eggplant salad item with a piece of bread. We got forks even though 4/5 of us were Filipino -- people who are accustomed to not using utensils, shoving morsels of food into our mouths with our fingers. \n\nIt was fun to watch the non-rhythmic white men trying to impress their dates by accepting the challenge of the belly dancer under the flashes of digital cameras and camera phones. It was gross to know that the older man in the corner was clearly aroused by the dancer, as he sat with his wife and college-aged daughter. I thought it was obscene to see people tuck dollar bills into her outfit. SHE'S NOT A STRIPPER! Geez! That is seriously disrespectful. Do you tuck money onto the bodies of minimally dressed African or Brazilian dancers? NO. You're suppose to appreciate the beauty of the dance, not objectify it's sensual characteristics. People can be pigs!\n\nAlthough it was entertaining to see people wince with embarrassment when chosen by the dancer, it was also terrifying. I didn't want to be dragged into the center of the room to display my inability to move my hips! People will assume that I suck in bed (which I don't, thankyouverymuch! I won't claim to be a stud but I can show you a little sumthin' sumthin'). Okay, I'm straying off topic... but overall, it was a fun experience. I don't necessarily like to pay one price and commit to an entire meal. I like to have the option to get a salad or not get one, etc. For me, it wouldn't bother me terribly if I never went again but I would definitely consider it as a place to bring my out-of-town visitors.", "author": "Elsie M."}

All the furniture and decorations are imported from Morocco, so you feel like you're in another world. What's also great is that they have free entertainment (belly dancing) every night. The belly dancer will try to get people to dance with her, so join in on the fun!\n\nThe food is good, but not as good as I remember it (I went to El Mansour 4 years ago, then went back last week). The portions seemed smaller, for one thing. Also, they now provide forks and knives to customers. I was kind of disappointed, because I think eating with your hands was what made El Mansour so unique.

This night we tried a bunch of different items. Everything comes with soup, salad mix and chicken backed cinnamon pastry type appetizer as well as desert tea/sweets. The lamb entrees were definitely the best, cooked to perfection and good cuts, the honey/almond was sweet as expected and the eggplant was mild but delicious. Chicken kabob was breast and a little dry as expected (came with couscous which is hard to eat with no silverware!), the split whole lemon chicken was much juicer.

The belly dancer was fun and personable, even if she comes across a little \"whatever happened to  Jeannie the Genie?\"  (Think spectacularly well preserved middle aged white lady straight out some sort of late-era Heinlein sex-positive fantasyland.)  The food was really good in spots - the fish tangine especially. \n\nHowever, I found the seating arrangement akward (everyone's against the wall facing the middle of the room, so you're all staring at each other), the bread too fluffy to serve as an eating utensil (a wedge of cakey bread doesn't turn a saucy meal into fingerfood),  the mint tea oversweetened, and the bastilla much too much like eating a turnover with chicken in it. \n\nMy friend and I agreed it was like the Benihana's of middle eastern food.  This is a slightly expensive yet  rather middle of the road theme restaurant. (Dinner for two and a bottle of wine came to $105 plus tip.) \n\nIn other words, if you've been to Aziza or even La Med, you're not going to be that  impressed by the food or the atmosphere.   Go to Aziza, instead. It's even more expensive but worth every penny. (Although,  the tables are uncomfortably close to each other at Aziza.

This place is great, and a lot of fun (especially in a group setting). The ambiance is definitely there from the setting, which is designed to look like you are inside a Moroccan tent. The belly dancing is also an added bonus, which is especially fun if you can manage to egg one of your group members to join in the dancing.\n\nAs for the food? Simply amazing. The lentil soup that the meal starts out with is delicious (and I don't even like lentils!), and it is followed up by a delicious salad platter of carrots, tomatoes, eggplant, and cucumber. Since everything is to be eaten with your hands, the servers provide a lot of soft white bread that goes well with these starters. The next course is the Chicken Bastela, which is a chicken and almond dish that is wrapped in a phyllo pastry skin and covered in... powdered sugar? I don't know how it works, but my entire group loved it and we practically wiped that plate clean.\n\nAll the entree courses are great, but my favorite by far is the Lamb Brochette. I will never understand how they get that much flavor into such a tiny piece of lamb, but I want more.\n\nThe meal is finished off with a delicious mint tea, banana fritters, and a puff pastry dessert. Again, zero complaints.\n\nThe service staff was really friendly, they were very accommodating for our vegetarian company, and the owner was incredibly nice when we happened to finish up after the restaurant closed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2011-07-25", "description": "Before I get to the 1 star part of this review, the food was good, but there are many other better ways to spend $50/person in the city. The menu is the least flexible I've ever heard of, where you HAVE to get a gigantic dinner whether you want one or not. There are only two price levels, and no sharing allowed, so everyone who walks in the door will be spending $40 before they even start thinking about drinks. Because every entree comes with a soup, a salad, bread, an appetizer, and a dessert, with ample time in between, that also means you are spending AT LEAST 2hrs here. The ambiance was fun, and the belly dancer was good, but I've seen better on both counts... actually, the Turkish girl in our group danced with the belly dancer for a bit, and I think demonstrated there's no number of classes you can take that can replace actually having grown up in a belly dancing culture.\n\nFine whatever, I'd probably give them 3 stars if that summed up the experience, and 4 if the service was good.\n\nThe singular star is because for the very first time in my life I've actually had a bad experience with the wait staff at a restaurant. I eat with a total disregard for price, eat everything and anything, tip well, am rarely in a hurry (when I eat), generally rate places based on just the food, and am the kind of guy who gets more entertainment than genuine rage from the inconsiderate jerks who cut me off in traffic. I am a VERY easy customer. A waitress would basically have to pick a fight with me to get me upset... which is exactly what happened.\n\nI showed up after a late lunch, and asked to share a meal with my girlfriend. The waitress explained why that doesn't work and they would \"go bankrupt if they did\", and without any back talk I ordered a second meal. Then we ordered drinks, and I asked if we could split a bottle of wine. The response I was going for was, \"yes, how many glasses would you like?\" Instead, I got an eye roll and an exasperated \"yes of course, we just can't split the food because blah blah blah bankrupt.\" Exactly the same thing I had just heard, but with the attitude cranked up to 11.\n\nNow, in a normal restaurant, \"may we split a bottle of the house red?\" would be a simple, mostly rhetorical question. But here - where they have to explain why you can't split a dish, have to explain why you just got a bathroom hand towel instead of a napkin, have to explain what each dish is, have to explain that you don't get utensils, have to explain the perfume stuff they just splashed on your hands (and incidentally in your water glass) - you would think they would be used to questions of all sorts, and ready to handle them without becoming irate. But no, let the misunderstanding continue...\n\nI admittedly did a poor job of explaining my intent with the question because my friends and I were busy defending ourselves, and somehow - for the THIRD time - we drew out her whole \"no splitting food blah blah bankrupt\" spiel. With much effort, I dropped it, and said, \"ok, thank you, 4 glasses and the bottle of wine, please.\" But by then such a scene had been made that, not only did the other half of our table look confused and horrified by the exchange, all the other tables in the area were now staring at us. Then one of the girls made the mistake of asking what happened, so I quietly explained to her, and the waitress barks at us, \"do you want me to take the order or not.\" As in, \"you can get out if you don't like it.\" Of course the music was low at the time, and this was all absolutely humiliating. Had I not been in a group of 8, I would have certainly taken her up on the offer and left.\n\nThe other waiters weren't much better. Somehow they could pour tea into a glass from about 5ft up, but had a hell of a time getting ice water into the glass from an inch or two away. Another waiter clumsily spilled soup on my leg and didn't even apologize. I can only hope the mean lady told them to give us terrible service, because that is pathetic if they independently came to those performances.\n\nWhen we paid the bill it occurred to me that each person in the group had come with hundreds of dollars in cash. In the 2hrs we spent there, I'm certain the eight of us could have easily taken out 4 to 6 bottles. But we stopped at one, because none of us wanted to give another dime to this establishment. \n\nThis place is a joke.

When you walk in the door, you're meant to feel like you're inside a tent (the ceilings have cloth hanging from them to give this effect) and you sit on the floor with embroidered cushions and low tables.\r\n\r\nThe food is delicious.  There's a set menu where you choose from a list of entrees and then it comes with soup, bastela (phyllo dough stuffed with chicken an almonds with cinnamon and powdered sugar), mint tea and dessert.  You eat with your fingers (please don't be a jerk and insist on silverware, just wash your damn hands and eat!) and they provide you with a towel and put a basin of water on the table between courses so that you can rinse off.\r\n\r\nFinally, they have bellydancing, which is entertaining, but honestly when I went there I was concentrating more on the bastela than on the dancing ... it was that good.  \r\n\r\nIt's a little bit pricey for me, so really this is a good place to go for a date or for someone's birthday or anniversary or something.", "author": "Matthew M."}

The menu is slightly unusual. You choose your entree and the rest of the meal is fixed. Lentil soup, vegetable plate, Bastela du Chef (yummy shredded spiced chicken topped with a pastry dough and sprinkled with powdered sugar), entree, small dessert and mint tea. Also, you need to ask for silverware if you want to use them. Otherwise you eat with your fingers and bread.

Seating is on low divans and leather poufs in a Moroccan-style draped room, with big low tables set in front- cozy and casual. Very much a younger Marina/straight crowd.\n\nThe belly dancer was great. She's in terrific shape, beautiful, and a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe service was enthusiastic and welcoming.\n\nThe food is vile. Seriously, food so bad the 2 stars are for the room, the belly dancer and the service, and I like Moroccan food, especially the combination of sweet/sour/salt in so many dishes. The prix-fixe menu is $35, and while I don't want to begrudge anyone their profits, it's a total rip-off in terms of food cost. There's no excuse for serving unidentifiable vegetables in San Francisco. It's possible the kebabs are a better deal, but I ordered the lamb with prunes- an overly sweet concoction overloaded with cinnamon that was half-meat, half-spine. Cartilage included. The bistaya that preceded it was very sweet and made with chicken thigh and neck, which is fine, but I got a piece of neck bone in my first bite. On the plus side, our vegetarian friend got a bistaya made with a carrot/sweet potato filling that was actually outstanding. On the minus side, none of us finished anything we were served.\n\nSo go for the show and ambiance... and order the kebabs. The servers are great, and don't begrudge them a decent tip just because the food is poor.", "author": "Rocco P."}

The decor, the wonderful dancer, the other people in the restaurant.  It was like a huge party.  I laughed until I ached when the dancer teased hip swirls out of some of the patrons.

The servers and owners are super nice, but you can kind of get the feeling they're saying, so you think this is what it's like in Morocco, hm? \nIt seems like the kind of place Andy Sandberg would take Joanna Newsom out on a date thinking she's going to be all into the cultural fluff they have, and really she's politely appalled by the corniness of it.

If you can't stand getting your fingers sticky, silverware is optional! But, I believe the idea is to eat with your hands and use the bread in place of silverware.

It's the kind of place for either large parties or a cozy romantic dinner for two b/c the seating lets you get really close to your honey but wear comfy clothes b/c you'll be either leaning over the table if sitting on the low banquettes or sinking into a really low cushion on the floor.  \n\nI love the food, starting with the flavorful lentil soup followed by the egglant & tomato salads which are all served with some of the best all-you-can-eat bread that the server brings around in a large wicker basket for you to take from.  Then comes the bastilla which is a phyllo pastry filled w/ minced chicken and almonds dusted w/ powdered sugar -- so good I always want it all to myself.  The main courses are super tasty -- their chicken is a whole game hen which is so tender you barely have to tug at the bones and it comes apart.  I haven't had any of the brochettes but they look amazing -- as long as swords.  And finally for dessert you get a phyllo drizzled w/ cream along with fried bananas and a delicious mildly sweetened mint tea.  Your napkin at El Mansour is a large hand towel which you totally need when eating with your hands.  You can ask for utensils but part of the fun of moroccan food is eating sans knife & fork.\n\nThere's only one thing about this whole thing that I'm not a huge fan of, and I'm sure I'm the exception here -- the belly dancing.  I just don't like having to play along w/ the whole cheesy thing (again, only MHO).  And I always feel trapped into staying when I'm actually ready to leave if the dancing's in full swing b/c it seems so rude.  One way to get around it is to confirm what time the show starts (usually 7:30pm) and time your res. around it.\n\nReturn Visit = Definitely", "author": "Jeannie C."}

I had a good time - they've got their routine down as far as making it a fun experience for large groups and I'm glad I got to try it once but it's really expensive (though you do get a ton of food). Based on the food alone I wouldn't really come back. \n\nThey have a set menu for $30-32 which includes lots of stuff: bread, soup, salad, basteeya (delicious chicken filo dough pastry), entree (lots of different options), dessert (banana fritters and keneffa) and mint tea. We shared two entrees: couscous with 2 kinds of lamb (stew and brochettes), and chicken with onions and raisins. My favorite parts of the meal were the salad and the basteeya (if I could come here and just order those two things for around $10 I would be much more likely to come back). The entrees were pretty good (the brochettes had great flavor / spice, though they were overcooked) but it was very difficult to eat the rest of the entree food without silverware (I know it's supposed to be all authentic and romantic to eat with yours hands but it doesn't really do anything for me, except maybe get couscous down my shirt - don't ask...). Dessert was good too (the banana fritters were great - the keneffa strangely had almost no filling unlike versions i've had at other middle eastern restaurants which were much better than El Mansour's version).\n\nThe decor is beautiful, especially if you enjoy Moroccan tilework (which I love)... but you don't need to eat here to see it since the nicest parts are on the outside walls of the restaurant. The belly dancing was fun to watch (especially when the birthday boy was encouraged to get up and shake his booty).\n\nIn summary: if you want a memorable party for a large group and don't mind it being kind of spendy this is a decent choice. If you're looking for straight up delicious upscale Moroccan food without all the hoopla go to Aziza instead.", "author": "Lila T."}

The food was yummy - not too exotic for the typical palatte, but not too mundane for those who are more adventurous with their food tastes.  The rabbit was my favorite, followed closely by the lamb with lemon and olives. The decor was kitschy,  the staff was very accomodating, and luckily for me, the entertainment was worth the schlepp from the outer regions of the bay area that all of my friends made to get there. The belly dancer was a great performer.  She made it interactive by having almost all of us come up and attempt \"working it\" like she did.  hilarious for all involved.\nBut to top it off, because we're not so swift with math, our group ended up paying an extra hundred bucks.  The head waiter found us at the bar next door (also recommended by the way), and gave us our cash back.  Can you friggin believe that?  I still can't.  \nIf you are looking to get together with friends with some decent food, fun entertainment, in a comfortable atmosphere and in an HONEST establishment, hit up el mansour.  you will not be disappointed!", "author": "annie c."}

Back then there wasn't as much seating. When you walked through the door you were instantly thrust into the view of the diners and sometimes directly into the way of the belly dancer! It was crazy but always fun to instantly be apart of the communal vibe. Now after a remodel, there is much more seating and a bit of an entryway into the restaurant. \n  My most recent visit was for a birthday bash with 15 or so people. We had the front, right corner to ourselves and let me tell you... It was awesome. We were able to transform the area into our own space. We were lounging, mingling, eating, and being lively. The wait staff didn't miss a beat and they were even able to keep track of the people who moved spots before the food was served. We opened many bottles of wine without corkage I believe. What I liked most about this venue for a party was that the home-y atmosphere puts everyone at ease. You get the intimacy of a party at home with an international vibe and no dishes! \n  I've always liked the food here as well. It's cooked like your Moroccan mom made it. It's hearty, flavorful, and cooked well, but not perfectly. If you want fanciness, go to Aziza. If you want a completely unique experience that transports you out of SF and into a fun and exciting realm, visit El Monsour.", "author": "chelsea b."}

Its definitely a no frills space with a simple design to set the mood for a taste of Morocco. The lady who run's the place is great and very attentive. Apparently its been a family business for years and you definitely get that vibe. \n\nThe food. was great. And there's a lot of it. It's pricey though which took me by surprise (almost $30 an entree) but the whole meal involved several dishes after you choose your main dish. The choices range from seafood, chicken, lamb and rabbit. After first ordering the chicken (and then getting berated by both my brother and the Owner about how chicken is so boring and that I really should try something original) I opted for the seafood dish. Pre-main dish, they served a great starter salad and a sort of pancake dish with chicken and powdered sugar (weird but good. dessert or appetizer... still deciding). The seafood and couscous were awesome. It wasn't very much though so order a meat dish for more bang to your buck. The lamb was ridiculous. The rabbit, surprisingly good too. (man, I love eating other people's food). The Moroccan beer was also a great compliment to the meal. To top it all off, there was the predictably interactive belly dancing show which I obviously participated in. After a meal like that, my belly was definitely up for some action. \n\nOverall? This place was fun and the food was great. All said and done, for over $40 a pop, I'd rank this more a special occasion kind of place.

Then came an assortment platter with salsa (that's the best I can describe it), pickled cucumbers and carrots, and a spread of some sort. I don't remember what kind of spread but it was good. This came with the same bread served with the soup. It was french bread. I think the main entree came next which was a plate full of meat, served with bread.

I have been to Aziza up the street they are close but in a fight, I would have to choose EL Mansour.  I have been dining at this place for well over twenty years.  I like the atmosphere of the old place so I hope it has kept some of the intimate charm.  Now the food\n\nThe food here has been spot on for years and judging by the recent reviews nothing has changed.  I am looking forward to trying the Tagines, they look really good.  My favorites on the Couscous dishes, either seafood or chicken. I also like to Phyllo dish, that is savory and great.  The simple desserts are great too like deep fried banannas with just a drizzle of honey.\nThis is a great place for groups as well, very informal and inviting.  This is restaurant is one of San Fran's places that remains high on the list of must dine restaurants.", "author": "Kelvin M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-08-27", "description": "I have been to many Morroccan restaurants, both in California and on the east coast, and El Mansour rates as one of the best. To start with, the menu is very limited, which may sound like a minus, but in fact is a big plus, in that the kitchen is free to concentrate on making the food the best it can be. And it is.\n\nThe lentil soup was rich, savory, hot and perfectly balanced in texture and flavor.\n\nThe Basteeya, often a dish that lacks character, or is soggy, or is oversugared, or is too eggy, was absolutely perfect. The crust was impossibly crunchy, the aroma was complex and savory, and the sugaring was in delicate proportion to the eggs and nuts that were found inside.\n\nThe Chicken with olives and preserved lemon was a revelation. Often, preserved lemon dishes are made with inferior lemons, and/or the olives are run of the mill. Both condiments were excellent, and the long-cooked chicken was hot, the skin was perfectly rendered and the meat remained succulent.\n\nThe belly dancing was well done, and sometimes very funny, as the accomplished and lovely lady made a point to embarrass and entice each man in the room. Her balance, elegance and skill was noteworthy.\n\nDecor is lovely, and though the room was filled to capacity, each of us felt we had our own private space.\n\nYou have to go.", "author": "Charles L."}

We had been to the restaurant before a number of times (we love the food and authentic decor) but neither of us had ever planned such an event. Jack and Houda have so much experience and helped us with everything. They thought of things we would have missed that really made the event, like two fantastic belly dancers that the family just loved (I will never forget the look of delight on my Father's face as he danced with one of them). The menu gave just enough choice to make everyone happy and not too much to confuse them, the wines were delicious and of course the mint tea always fantastic. \n\nJack and Houda were so accommodating; we took up the entire restaurant and yet our guests said they had never been to a more intimate and enjoyable party. The food was fantastic and the staff was so attentive!  For the Moroccans who were there, they felt transported back to another time & place and were inspired to share many stories of days gone by.

Great food, reasonably priced (not the California/Moroccan infused pricey snobby stuff like Aziza or the touristy places downtown or on Pacific heights), wonderful atmosphere and nice people who own it. Friday and Saturday nights you need a reservation, but other nights are less crowded. A not to be missed San Francisco tradition.\n\nThis has nothing to do with El Mansour, it is about the restaurant's patrons. If you have kids and want to go to El Mansour go early, enjoy and leave early so that adults can enjoy the experience. Parents often keep kids there way past their bedtime and then they become cranky and spoil the experience for the adults. Therefore, I have decided to only go there during the week when the food, atmosphere and entertainment can be fully enjoyed.", "author": "jack w."}

The ambience was amazing, as if we stepped into a Moroccan paradise, and the house belly dancer was very entertaining.  However, the service was slightly off.  Our waiter was a bit confusing and seemed to hate the fact that we wanted to share the meals since they were $30 a pop.  What made things worse was when a waiter took away our salad, which was far from being done, and piled it under other dirty dishes.  We asked for it back but he just brought the next course instead.  In the end, we received our bill and noticed an extra $50+ for an unknown item.  We asked our waiter what it was, and he hurriedly explained that he charged extra to share meals, meaning $17 per couple for an extra soup and tea.

I had my 17th birthday party here. Can you imagine how happy the teenage boys were? I have always secretly wanted  to be a belly dancer since that night, but I have never set aside enough time to stick with a class. I also had one of the first dates with my husband here. He said that the fact that he was willing to  eat with his hands in front of me so early in our relationship was a sign that we were meant to be. I must say I am a fan of eating with my fingers. This fascination started young. My mom called me E.T. fingers at the dinner table because I was always picking off the platter. My favorite part of the meal is the bastilla, a spiced chicken pie that is dusted with powdered sugar. This may sound weird to some but in the annoying words of Rachelle Ray, \"It's de-lish.\" I also love the fact that at the end of the meal the waiter washes your hands with warm water then slashes them with rose water. You literally leave there smelling better than when you got there. I think that this is a fun place, although a bit pricey for a Tues. night. The sweetened mint tea that the waiters pour from a foot above the table both refreshes you and relaxes you at the end of the meal. This is a good place for a fun evening.", "author": "Esa Y."}

We arrived earlier than our reservation, but the owner hostess lady was gracious and seated us right away.  The wine list was so-so but drinkable. The meal is well timed and was very good.  Traditionally , they begin by washing your hands at the table and giving you a towel to dry them which is also your napkin for the meal.  Well technically you wash your own hands, and they pour the warm water for you.  They brought by yummy bread. I wasn't sure where I was supposed to set my bread while there were no other dishes on the table so I just held onto it.  Then came a plate of dips, very tasty and refreshing pickled carrots and cucumbers and a  tomato dip that was a bit like salsa. I could have used more of the eggplant dip which was both of our favorite.  Then comes a chicken in phyllo dish with powdered sugar on top. Hot as hades but really good once cooled down. Next our chicken and seafood dishes which were equally good.  Oh yes, and you eat with your hands,  I almost forgot about that. At this point the belly dancer comes out and the music gets louder, ok loud. Now I love Moroccan food, and know to expect the dancer who was really pretty and really nice and really limber and really really sparkly. For some reason this made me want to hurry up and leave. The mint tea was served as well as a plantain and honey apple phyllo something for desert. At this point I was satiated and feeling hot. No I really don't want to dance with you lady. Overall we had a great time. The food is better than good, the ambiance is lovely and yes I will go back. Perhaps I will remember to ask the hostess/owner to tell the dancing lady not to keep asking me to join her to dance, because I just don't want to.

Our reservation was for 8pm on a Saturday nite. We were a few minutes late because it was so hard to find parking, but it was still fine. The inside wasn't how I thought it would be. It was pretty tiny. I did like it, sitting on little couches and things, but there were a lot of kids. There was a whole pack of kids wrestling on the ground in the middle when we arrived. I dunno, that kind of lent it a living room type feel. I'm not used to seeing a bunch of kids playing in a restaurant (or kids very often at all) so it may not have been the best place for our date. But I guess it's an excellent place for a family to go. They bring out this large samovar type thing to wash your hands before and after dinner (with rose water the last time), which was cool. We both got the regular entr\u00e9e, which came with a tasty lentil soup, then a salad with cooked cucumbers and carrotts, and a very yummy babaganoush. The whole time, the waiter walks around trying to get you to eat more and more bread. You don't get the bread at the table, you take one piece at a time as he walks around. The bread was just bread, average, but he really wanted us to eat it for some reason. Lol. The water wasn't refilled as often.  After salad, they served us a yummy chicken pastry covered in confectioners sugar. Sweet and meaty at the same time, I liked it.  I had the lamb couscous for the main dish. The meat was just ok, but the couscous was good. By this time, I was kind of full... I have to say my main dish was the worst part of the meal. K had lamb with almonds and honey which was super super sweet. She liked it all right, but thought it was a little fatty, and also too just meat. Which was why I was glad to have gotten couscous. Desert was very good again. Fried bananas and some other thing. All that came in one package for $30ish or $28, so so much food, and a good deal. The belly dancer was on late because we were waiting for a group of lost people. They arrived, and she did a wonderful job, although I was picturing someone a little younger. She wasn't old old... She had everyone dance up with her, but I didn't go cuz I got kind of shy, since I knew I wouldn't be good at it. The waiters were in love with us, staring at us the whole meal, and told her to make sure to get us up on the dance floor. They were even watching me as I went to the bathroom (which was clean).  The whole meal and show lasted till after closing and we left very full at 10 something pm, with the waiter wanting us to go home with the dancer, or go to the next door bar with him to hear a band LOL. (no, we didn't do either). So, not a romantic place, but very entertaining.  The worst part was the kids, and also the actual entrees. We had fun though!", "author": "Merredith L."}

Get their prix fixe dinner (about $30-35), it's to die for and very satisfying, especially the Lamb with Honey and Almonds! The prix fixe includes lentil soup with piping hot bread in thick triangular slices, a shared salad plate with marinated vegetables, eggplant salad similar to babbah ghannoush and another salad similar to Tabouleh. This is followed by a crazy hot Bastille pastry crisscrossed with powdered sugar and cinnamon, filled with eggs and chicken. You'll want to eat it so fast you'll burn yourself. After the main course dessert is served, normally fried bananas with honey and strawberries served with mint tea ceremoniously poured from three feet above each ornate glass. This place has been in business forever and the family that runs it is wonderful and very hospitable. \nMake sure to make a reservation as you may be SOL to get in otherwise on a busy weekend night. This is a great place to enjoy a slow dinner and entertainment. The Restaurant is beautiful itself with traditional Moroccan bench/cushion seating and low tables. The walls are lined with ornate design and the ceiling covered with hanging colored cloths. The belly dancer, Stasha is really amazing. Her show is clean and she is truely a talented dancer unlike many similar restaurants with nobodies that remind you more of a strip joint than traditional dance. She is graceful and has been dancing and teaching dance professionally for decades. She makes all her own costumes and although she's a few years older than she looks at first glance, is never shy to flirt with the crowd and coax unsuspecting guests to join her on the floor in dance.

The dance started really late around 9:30 PM and only was their for 20 min which I thought that it should have been longer. The menu are fixed and friend who is vegetarian and only can eat Vegetarian Cous Cous she was really dissapointed because the portion is small and wasnt that great. The deserts are big disspointment for all of us. The other dishes are ok. They should have option to order only one thing from the dish rather than making the menu fixed. Because not everyone wants the full course meal.", "author": "Dia A."}

My husband and I went there last Saturday just for casual dining and left the place feeling like we were just in Morocco.  The food was fantastic and they didn't rush you at all like most restaurants.  The belly dance was awesome...I'm already thinking about our next dinning experience there.  I highly recommend it.", "author": "Lyd H."}

We brought fifteen people and each one was forced to order an entree, even the two small children. The entree was 30 bucks a pop for a normal entree, and the special was 40. Now with fifteen people at forty bucks a pop, not including drinks, they had better let someone share a meal. The belly dancer showed up late, it wasn't her fault, but she was white...no offense white chicks but you can't dance the same. NO small options, and we had to have things in a certain order, you couldn't have tea with your meal. I am all about cultural diversity, but you have to at least let people eat what then want when they want it especially if they are paying you. I worked in a french place that served an eight course meal, yea the wine was chosen to go with the meal, but if someone wanted another wine while they ate, they could have one...Overall this place is too damn expensive for the terrible service, rude people, and forcible feeding. Horrible for children and people with small  pocket books. The atmosphere is nice but definitely not worth it. The waitress was snobby as hell, and the guy could pour tea from really high up but that was not going to save this restaurant from my review. They wouldn't bring anyone forks even if we asked. Total bill was somewhere around seven hundred dollars, for that we all should have gotten a much better tasting meal than we got. Talk about money grubbers, at lest we only had to leave a fifteen percent tip (again I work in the restaurant industry and i usually tip 22%).", "author": "Unhappy C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2006-08-26", "description": "one of the authentic morrocan restaurants in SF.  I made this comment based mostly on the interior design of the restaurant, the waiters'/waitresses' uniform, the BELLY DANCING, and the way they serve the food.  I've never been to any other morrocan restaurant, so I don't know if their style of serving the food (one dish at a time, next item you ordered won't come out unless you finish with your current plate) is authentic or just simply unique.  Anyways, the food was great, the belly dancing was beautiful, and the service was good.  Plan to spend at least 4 hours for dinner at the place if you come in a group due to the time it takes for all the dishes to come out, and be able to see belly dancing since she comes out like every half hour or 45 minutes.  The price here is not typical family dinner price at all.  Another down side is that they make each adult order one main course, which costs about $30 or $40 each.  But it is truly a place to take your relatives/friends from elsewhere when come visiting SF as a way to show the diverse ethnics in the city.", "author": "Karen C."}
