A perfect afternoon pick me up; one cupcake will be fine to satisfy that sweet tooth.  They have some the favorite flavors every other shop has, but also introduce their own unique cupcakes like tres leches.\n\nTres Leches Cupcake: The \"frosting\" seems to be just whipped cream from a can.  The cake, however is amazing.  So moist and rich.  And to make it even richer, there was like a little bit cream/custard flowing out of the center and down to the bottom.\n\nChocolate Tres Leches Cupcake: Like the Tres Leches Cupcakes, but with chocolate cake and chocolate \"frosting\" (also whipped cream consistency).  I liked the \"frosting\" better on this one, but felt the original had a better cake.  The chocolate cake seemed drier with less leche absorbed.  Maybe they just happened to use less?\n\nVanilla Cake Pop: Looked quite cool with sparkling pink glitter.  Tasted like a store bought cake pop though.  Thick white chocolate shell with a pasty vanilla cake center.  Probably best to stick with the cupcakes instead.", "author": "Adam B."}

I called ahead and asked whether they were able to accommodate me walking in to pick up 2 dozen cupcakes and they said it was no problem so I walked in around 2 and ordered a mix of 2 dozen cupcakes. The girl at the register put in a mix of cupcakes for me in boxes but unfortunately they did not have bags so I had to carry 2 boxes of cupcakes across multiple city blocks hoping I don't trip and fall flat into all those cupcakes.\n\nI've tried a lot of cupcakes across the city - especially some of the chains like Kara and Cako and this place is so much better! Prior to this if I craved a cupcake I would go to Cako because it's generally more convenient and I find their cakes less disgustingly sweet. But I'm just going to come to La Luna from now on. \n\nThe prices are on par with all the other boutique cupcake shops - $3.50 for one, $40 a dozen. They also have gluten free and vegan cupcakes! \n\nOf all the variety, I tried the red velvet and the cappucino. OMG THE CAPPUCINO WAS SO GOOD. There was a light whip filling in the middle of a chocolate cake. (It can use a bit stronger coffee flavor in the cake) The red velvet was very standard - but the cream cheese frosting was very light and less sweet than other places which I love. \n\nThe cakes are extremely moist and does not have the cloyingly fake sweetness in cupcakes at so many other places. Definitely would recommend this to anyone looking for a sweet treat in the middle of their day!", "author": "Judy H."}

True to the nature of my visit, this is a short review saying that if you want a midday pick-me-up, La Luna Cupcakes are the way to go.\n\nI cashed in on a promise my significant other made me a year ago to buy me a really good cupcake, and we stopped in to get a regular-sized chocolate tres leches cupcake for $3.50. For eating in, we were served the cake on a china plate with a plastic fork and napkin. The cake was moist and not at all crumbly, and about halfway through, we hit tres leches gold. The frosting was sweet without being sugary, and was adorably topped with some semisweet chocolate chips. Think chocolate lover's dream, only better.\n\nOther flavors I saw in the display included original tres leches, red velvet, and mocha. Someone in the back was packaging beautifully-made cake pops, which would make a cute office treat. Since it's difficult to find high-quality snacks at a good price point around here, I'd make the short walk over for these.", "author": "Gwen W."}

The first thing that struck me about this place was how decorative it was! There were so many flavors of cupcakes in the display case. I went with the hot chocolate cupcake. Minus one star because it wasn't filled to the top of the liner. However, the cupcake itself was very rich in chocolate flavor and moist! The whipped cream frosting was also light and not overly sweet. I thought that the garnish of marshmallows and chocolate straw were a nice addition.

After having lunch at the Fountain Cafe and spending a good 15 minutes watching the hubs play chess again, i decided to stop in and check this place out.\n\nIt's a pretty spacious little cupcake store with about two small tables and one long table by the front for sitting, if not the outdoor seating area. The cupcakes are neatly stacked in separate circular trays and come in two different sizes. There are about 8 flavors: vanilla, cookies&cream, chocolate, red velvet, lemon, gluten-free carrotcake, coconut, and their most popular tres leches. Thw mini cupcakes are $1.50 each and the bigger cupcakes are $3.50 each. \n\nThe man working the counter was so nice. He must've figured that it was our first time, so he let us sample the tres leches mini cupcake for free. It was really decadent with the frosting, and when you bite into it more you get the leches which is muy bueno for me!\n\nWe bought 4 mini cupcakea for $6. \n- Vanilla: tasted like a standars vanilla cupcake from Luckys or any other supermarket store. Frosting was thick, but cake was vanilla moist.\n- Cookies&Cream: dont hurt me, but I am not the biggest fan of chocolate. So i didnt fancy this one so much. The cake was super chocolatey and sweet. A bit too sweet for my palate, but the hubz liked it.\n- Red velvet: i LOVE red velvet, so this one was a plus for me. Cream cheese frosting had a tartness that mixed well with the red velvet cake. Moist cake + whipped frosting = yummies.\n- Tres Leches: This one was my favorite, hands down. Cake was soft and moist and it didnt crumble even thougg there was some milk there. The frosting was sweet but it wasnt too thick or soggy.\n\nThey have cakepops here for $2 i believe. You can do combos here and each are $5.\n- Soda + cupcake =$5\n- Coffee + cupcake =$5\n- Yogurt + cupcake =$5\n\nOverall a nice experience.

No one was there when I came in, but I didn't notice right away since I was admiring the handiwork of the cupcake decorating.

The cupcake was tasty albeit needing a little more moisture, but according to some of the other reviews, the Tres Leches is where it's at in terms of a good, moist, flavorful cake. I don't doubt that and I'm all for heading back there.", "author": "Robbin A."}

This one was vanilla/chocoalte swirled cake as well as icing.

Unfortunately though, the frosting did not make up for the dryness of the cupcake as a whole.\n\nI'll probably go back and try another flavor to give them a fair shot, maybe it was just this particular cupcake that was dry.

Just the right amount of sweetness, good textures and enough quirkiness to make the eating experience not just pleasurable, but memorable. \n\n2) The customer service - The cupcakes are A+, but what takes La Luna to caketastic levels is its customer service. Maybe it's because it's a family business, but there's an extra level of care and sincerity that I appreciate. I'll give you an example; my friend bought a panda cake pop and dropped it shortly after buying it. Cue smashed panda face. The people at La Luna responded by giving her a new one. Just like that, no second thoughts.\n\n3) The cleanliness - You know what it's like when you go to a food place and things seem a bit...mucky? Not my type of place.

(Comes back out with a sugar coated cake pop) Oh, it looks like we have vanilla which is vanilla cake dipped in white chocolate and coated with sanding sugar.\n\nMe: How about Mars Red Velvet?\n\nAssociate: (Apparently there is someone in the back) Let me go check one more time. (Associate comes back with a very small sugared pink cake pop).\n\nMe: Wow, the pictures online seem bigger. Do they not come any bigger than what you have? (Online, the Mars Red Velvet cake pops look massive, quite like a Chinese fried sesame ball).\n\nAssociate: (Looking stunned) Yeah, they are enlarged online to show depth. Honestly, I am trying to perhaps ask you to come back tomorrow. Our baker has stepped out, and there would be more offerings if she were here, but she isn't. We weren't expecting any business at all.\n\nMe: (The associate pretty much just asked me to return the next day. Do not question your own question when you are already suggesting). I wanted a cupcake today for a friend. Never mind then.\n\n*The associate was very defensive, and he felt the need to repeat himself that the \"baker has stepped out\" and that her whereabouts were unknown......\"\n\n*Of all the cupcakeries that I have been to, this is the first one that asks a customer to return the next day because they simply did not bake all of their offerrings. From a service evaluation standpoint, I only have one word, \"problematic\". I thought it was a great idea to venture outside the cupcakeries that I've come to know: Sprinkles (not the best, mainly big in name for creating the cupcake fad), Magnolia (timeless, New York favorite - but overly sweet), CAKO (bay area bakery, not bad, not original, and sometimes overly sweet), Kara's (my favorite, and will continue buying from them), and then there's La Luna (I have not tried any of their cupcakes, but why should I?).\n\n*Never assume what kind of day it will be in terms of business. You advertise \"Savory Cupcakes\", and yet you don't bother making any to sell. Savory cupcakes have become a hit across seas (Hong Kong in particular), and people actually enjoy them as if they were a single meal. Your cupcakes look amazing, but I might just stick to businesses that I know and trust. La Luna, I am sorry, but I won't be a customer to your establishment.\n\nNext cupcakery on my mind? Georgetown Cupake!", "author": "Alex C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-03", "description": "La Luna is yet another cute cupcakery with average, unremarkable cupcakes. Presentation is stark, with each cupcake decorated with a simple swirl of frosting and maybe a candy object on top. The chocolate cake was dry without a very rich flavor; the chocolate frosting was too hard in contrast to the cake. Vanilla was just that...plain old vanilla. The red velvet was similarly plain (though I've never been a huge fan of red velvet to begin with -- red food coloring? Come on...) but at least the cream cheese frosting was pretty tasty. The biggest success here was the tres leches, which no doubt stayed moist because of...well...the tres leches. If you come here at all I might actually go for the frozen yogurt, which ironically tastes pretty different compared to the other fad that keeps popping up: DIY frozen yogurt shops. La Luna's froyo is creamy, just barely sweetened, and actually tastes like yogurt - natural and refreshing.\n\nThe problem with cupcakes is that they've become so popularized that in order to stand out from your competitors, you've got to do one of two things: 1) create an outstanding cupcake 2) decorate outrageously. Unfortunately, La Luna didn't hit the mark on either of those, so for me it remains very middle of the road: just one of many cupcakeries around the city.", "author": "Clarice W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-07-31", "description": "Terrible.  Sure, it's pretty inside but what they're selling isn't anything special.  I wasn't sure I bought into them being smaller than regular cupcakes, until I used one of their containers to transport a Cupkates Truck cupcake home and the Cupcakes cupcake wouldn't even fit in the box!  I'd say they are 20% smaller, and this wasn't even a mini.\n\nI'm a cupcake aficionado.  I've tried most places in the Bay Area, and this one ranks near the bottom, just above Cako and Cupcake Cove. \n\nVanilla Chocolate - Dry as can be, pretty with the swirl, but not great tasting.\n\nTres Leches:  Very tasty, but the bottom was soggy and falling apart.  The texture made it seem like I was eating food that had gone bad.  Great flavor, but texture not so much.\n\nLemon:  Lemon cake with lemon buttercream.  So unspecial it should be removed from the menu immediately.  Or replaced with a Lemon Meringue cupcake.\n\nStrawberry:  See Lemon above.  Nothing special at all about this cupcake either.  Dry strawberry cake, too sweet strawberry frosting.\n\nHot Chocolate:  Cute with the marshmallows, but it's just a chocolate cupcake.  \n\nRed Velvet:  Too sweet, too dry.  Everyone makes this variety, so get one elsewhere.  \n\nI may have tried a few others since they've been open, but they're completely unmemorable, and there has never been a savory one on the menu.  This place needs to take a page from Cupkates book, or Republic of Cake in Orinda where the cupcakes are original, inventive, have great fillings and are topped with something other than sickeningly sweet buttercream.  BE ORIGINAL!  BE UNIQUE!  Do not be yet another place selling mediocre cupcakes.  I hope this place goes out of business soon, and considering it's always empty when I pass by, I'm sure that'll happen soon.", "author": "Yolanda B."}

They also served a yellow cake with a hazelnut frosting. The frosting was done well and reminded me of nutella but I would have liked to have it paired with a chocolate cake.\n\nThe froyo consistency was great, and more on the tart side which I enjoy. The prices for cupcake and froyo are very reasonable. $3 for a regular, $30 for a dozen. The froyo is $3.75 and includes 2 toppings.
