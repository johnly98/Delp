{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-19", "description": "I hate to disparage the reputation of what appears to be a locally owned neighborhood cafe, but I think Temo Cafe needs a wake-up call.\n\nI ve been here a few times and the counter help has always been distinctly uninterested in anything more than the basics of taking your order and cashiering your payment. Zero friendliness or chit-chat so you feel like you're welcome here; it feels like you're interrupting them instead.\n\nRecently I ordered a sandwich and coffee and paid with my debit card. The cashier twisted the screen around so that I could choose among 3 suggested tips that started at 18% and went up from there. I chose 18% even though in no way did I think the service merited that. I feel for retail workers trying to eke out a living in insanely expensive San Francisco so I was ok with it.\n\nBut then I waited a looong time for my sandwich while I could hear the help gossiping about stuff non-stop from my seat. After a while I approached them to ask if my food was going to take much longer and I was told, totally unapologetically, that it was sitting on their counter. If they announced it was ready, I didn't hear it. \n\nSo they let my warm sandwich sit around and get cold rather than say something again or just walk the 15 feet to bring it to me. They weren't busy, so that's not an excuse for their indifference. These are people who just don't care about doing their jobs well, and I felt coerced by their flip screen to tip them a couple of dollars for this 'service.'\n\nI don't think I'll be back to Temo any more. There are good alternatives to them all around this neighborhood so why spend my money at a poorly run cafe?\n\nI hope the owner of this place reads this and fixes what's an easily fixed problem so they don't lose more business like mine.", "author": "Hugh G.

They have homemade hummus which I usually get on a plain bagel cuz I'm basic and i ain't about the fancy bagel life. They also have tons of vegetarian options.

I'm a big fan of both the soy pumpkin spice latte and the greek salad. The latte has lots of flavor and foam. On their website is an interview with the manager of the Mission location, which describes how they pride themselves on having David Rio's Tiger Spice Chai (a local business founded in SF), so I want to try that next time. The interview says that customers enjoy the well-balanced spices that they can taste more individually and the level of sweetness. Apparently another review says they have macademia milk?!\n\nThe salad comes in a nice wooden bowl and is quite large and a reasonable price. There are lots of greek olives in it (one time they were pitted and not the other time) and lots of feta. The tomatoes were better the first time and also the homemade dressing was more flavorful the first time. However, both times they were delicious! The food doesn't come out immediately as they thoughtfully prepare it, but it doesn't take too long either.\n\nThe interview online says they roast their own beans in-house and source the beans from 5 different origins including Brazil, Columbia, Indonesia, Ethiopia, and Sumatra. One of the employees is from Palestine and they now have homemade hummus and falafel now on the menu. In the three times I've been there during lunch, I've seen 3 people order falafel, so it must be good!

You grab a brew, open up the gadgets, and settle into your seat like a bird making his nest. You don't plan to move for hours, this spot is perfect.\n\nWelcome to Temo Cafe.\n\nThis is the first time I've sat at the cafe, but the place is filled with the kind of warmth the lights your soul. For the barista & coffee elite, they roast their own beans. For the coffee shop worker, they provide delicious food, including homemade hummus. Most importantly, for everyone they provide a sense of community.\n\nThis is the perfect spot to work through the day or recharge your weary batteries. I highly recommend it!", "author": "Michael M."}

Going back over 7 years I've walked past it nearly every weekday. I've seen it change from Sundance http://www.yelp.com/biz/sundance-coffee-san-francisco-2 to Bello http://www.yelp.com/biz/bello-coffee-and-tea-san-francisco-2 and now it is Temo Cafe. \n\nNormally when places change hands so often something is wrong with it. Seeing as just the name changes for the most part, the new ownership has left pretty much everything intact. Just a name change, a few new employees and a fresh coat of paint.\n\nThey also still roast their own coffee on site using some gigantic automated contraption that I've never seen at any other cafe. That alone goes a long way towards freshness.\n\nLately I've been getting their Americanos and taking advantage of their current check in offer of a free 8oz coffee. The Americano when brewed by either the owner, or the short gal barista, has been excellent. The others are kinda as sketchy. \n\nAt $4 for a large, it's a nice change of pace from getting Philz down the street. Although it's actually pricey for an Americano. This ain't Ritual quality but it seems to be Ritual prices. I'd rather go to L's Caffe down the street.\n\nThey gouge you $0.95 for freaking soymilk. After the price increases, this place has lost my business.\n\nThe seating is comfortable and free wi-fi is available should you choose to hang out here for a bit. As I just grab and go, this doesn't factor into my morning routine, but I'm jealous of those that are able to do as such.", "author": "John B."}

Since when is desctruction OF A GARDEN a form of celebration?), I decided that I deserved a coffee and a bagel from Temo on my walk to Bart. \n\nThey're offering a free 8oz coffee (iced or hot) with a purchase and a check in on Yelp, so it felt right to go there. And now I'm in love with the place. When it was Bello, I was not a fan. The former owner was abrassive and rude, but the new owners are a nice Greek couple who employ the sweetest girls!\n\nI got a Garlic bagel with cream cheese ($3) and an iced coffee (free!) an chatted with everyone working there and played with a little girl running around the cafe. It was a great morning. They also have Kombucha and other juices, along with hummus and eggs etc. for topping the bagels.

It was unusually quiet for a weekday afternoon; only one other person was in the shop when we came by.  They had a number of different beans on display around the wall of the store, but unfortunately, we couldn't specify which beans to use in our coffee.  As is the case with many coffee places, it appeared that many of the beans had been over-roasted.  I'm not sure what was used for our drinks.\n\nI'm generally not a frou-frou coffee drinker - just give me a light roast and I'm happy, but I decided to try their eggnog latte.  Poor choice, sadly.  The drink was cloyingly sweet and I couldn't get a great sense of the coffee itself.  My friend ordered a cappucino, which he said was a little disappointing as well.\n\nThis place has been open for only a short period of time, so perhaps with time they'll be able to refine their coffee-brewing skills.", "author": "Lee L."}

Although I did wish that if the barista did not bring my coffee, he could have shouted out that it was done, as I was the only customer waiting and I was tucked away out of sight. Pretty empty, free wifi, quiet. But I was really disappointed in the most important thing which was the coffee. The milk wasn't rich, no foam, no art, weak coffee flavor, and not even a hint of the rose. Sad because they boast this flavor board but it just tasted like regular coffee.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-24", "description": "This is one of my favorite cafes I've been in anywhere. Chiefly because of the kindness of the people who work there. Often, restaurants and cafes take on the frustration and neuroticism of their owners, with staff treating you fine, or ok, or downright poorly. But when a place is wonderful, it is often taking on the kindness and excellence of the owners as well. And the staff at Temo seem like real people who truly care. I chalk that up to them being sincerely kind and because Lamea cares for her staff in a way that is genuine and special. I was there one day and it was her birthday and her staff made her a cake and were excited to share with her and surprise her. And I understand why. She cares for others (particularly those in the community) and always seems joyful. I loved chatting with her.\n\nAs for the food and drink: the tea I had here on numerous occasions was delightful and they were happy to try different creations of tea lattes that I suggested, even trying them themselves to see how they tasted. And the sandwiches tasted great. \n\nWhen I got to cafes, I don't want to be a burden, I want to pay for good fare, and I want to slip into the culture seamlessly so I can take in what's around me and either chat with a friend or get work done. Such is the aura of Temo Cafe--with the kind staff, the big beautiful corner windows, the laid-back feel, and the enjoyable food/tea. \n\nI tell any of my friends who live in SF (or the Valley, or Oakland, or who are visiting SF) to go to the Mission and stop by Temo to say \"hello\" to Lamea and to connect to the community there in the best way.", "author": "Richard G."}

I've watched the business go from struggling to vibrant. Much of this has to do with the hardworking and determined owner but she also brought on two wonderful Latina women Maria and Katie. Together, the three of them have created a cafe that reflects a very diverse neighborhood where all feel welcome and are represented  to order their favorite coffee, pastry, and excellent selection of Palestinian pastries and delicacies. During a period of intense change in the Mission, I'm glad that Temo's is thriving!", "author": "Daryl C."}

Not too bitter, just right, and they're getting good at their latte art. What I like about this place is that, unlike many new establishments in the mission, they actually want to be part of the existing mission community, they are great neighbors!", "author": "Mabel J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-17", "description": "I think this place is a lot better now that it is Temo Cafe. The ladies that work here are extremely nice and they remember you if you come in on a regular basis (or even just a few times). They have excellent baked goods and I like that they have a choice of different roasts even for basic brewed coffee. The quality of the beans is great for the price and I can usually be in and out within a few minutes (very important if you're running to work).", "author": "Elias M."}
