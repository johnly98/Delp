They often have live music and there are time when they are really crowded-like when there is a St. Patrick's Day parade.  I often have fish and chips which I enjoy-the fish is cooked nicely and tastes good.  Fries are crisp and it comes with mushy peas.  I also like the cottage pie.  \n\n In my most recent visit, we were celebrating a birthday-hadn't tried the desserts before-will do so again.  The birthday dessert was a brownie with ice cream and whipped cream-very tasty.  We also got a banana cheesecake dessert to go which was another good choice.", "author": "Betsy B."}

That time, for me, was soured by staff and management at Johnny Mc Foleys in San Francisco. I was in a group of 10-15 people. However, from the moment I and my black friend sat down we were badgered about a \"two drink per person per table minimum.\" For an hour and a half we were asked OVER AND OVER AND OVER about our ability to pay for our drinks. Where as our friends who hadn't bought a drink until about an hour in, were never asked about buying drinks, even though they occupied tables just like we did. We were badgered so much that I and my friend got up from the table and stood, because for us, it was clear that the waitress wanted the table for more lucrative customers. \n\nFrom them at moment the waitress called the manager to attempt to quell any issues or misunderstandings. For\nMe, it was clear that the difference in Treatment was because of race. I and my friend were two of about 5 black people in a room of non-black individuals. \n\nThe manager attempted to argue with me about the minimum. I asked her why she was bothering me and my friend about the table minimum when we were no longer sitting at a table. She kept telling me that none of the waitresses decisions were based on race and that the drink minimum wa the drink minimum for everyone. But several of our friends told us that NOONE in all of the TWO HOURS  that we had been there asked them about drink minimums. It was not until the waitress and manager confirmed that I and my friend were with a majority non-black party that she left us alone. \n\nPeople think that treatment changed bacause you get a degree--it doesn't. I have a JD and my friend has one too! She also is an attorney BAR'd in the state of California...but to the waitress, we were just two black people unable to pay a tab.\n\nIt hurt my feelings that this waitress would do such an insensitive thing and that the manager would try to invalidate my feelings after I expressed them to her. Ya'll know me. I don't yell and I don't  fight.  So for this woman to see me as aggressive was very much so rooted in her preconceived notions and biases.\n\nI am truly disgusted by the actions of the staff, the management, and the lack of understanding In either party.\n\nI said all this too say, that, if you are black and people have biases, your proximity to whiteness won't Change that, your light skin won't Chang that, your money won't change that, your riches won't change that.\n\n#imtoothrough", "author": "Cristal H."}

The cabbage wasn't soggy and the brisket wasn't dry. A very good sized portion. There is a very well stocked bar and it's HUGE. It can be loud, as it is a sports bar as well.

The Irish coffees were good and not too sweet. (I asked our server to make mine less sweet.) I love soup, so I enjoyed the seafood chowder. It was creamy, had a good amount of seafood, and not too rich as I tend to like a lighter broth. I tasted the rest of the dishes and thought they were pretty good. The boys seemed to enjoy them.\n\nI used to come to Johnny Foley's a lot about a decade or more ago as I had a coworker who adored this place.

Luckily, we were able to head over to the bar to grab some drinks and hang around the bars before the rest of the party arrived. This place is huge with two bars and a live band. The six of us were seated in a table within a mini room, which provided some nice privacy. The server was also great about checking up on us through the dinner despite us being hidden away.\n\nEach couple in the group shared, so we decided on three appetizers for two (which thankfully we did, because the portions aren't much): Grilled Baby Back Ribs with Habanero-Roasted Vegetable Salsa ($17), Grilled Bacon-Wrapped Prawns with Sweet Chili Chutney ($16), and Pan-Fried Dungeness Crabcakes ($20). Each plate came with their own version of salad, which was pretty interesting. I enjoyed the salad paired with the baby back ribs the most as it was more of a coleslaw. As for the appetizers itself, the crabcakes lacked flavor even with the sauce and you only get two pieces; the bacon-wrapped prawns were glazed for this sweet, spicy taste that was delicious yet you only get two skewers with three pieces each; the ribs came in six bones, but dry and flavorless as well. The ribs really should've been paired with some good ol' barbeque sauce instead of the salsa.\n\nOverall, the food is not only pricey, but it sucks and come in small portions. There is nothing I would order again, unfortunately. Although service was consistent on checking up on us, they did mess up our order when we added one of our cards that was on tab. At least we got a free brownie for the birthday boy in the end.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

Staff was friendly and helpful. While I was waiting for the rest of my group, they escorted me to a little bar area and took my drink order. When everyone arrived, they seamlessly brought us over to a table. Delicious, delicious food and drink!  Good portions too. The wings, the fries and the potato skins were particularly good. Service was speedy, attentive, but not overbearing. \n\nCons: As some others have mentioned, because of the huge space, the acoustics can be a little challenging. Didn't bother my group too much and for the most part we were able to hear each other. This restaurant is in Union Square, so expect tourist prices.\n\nBottom line:  It's a little too pricey to make it my regular happy hour spot, but would definitely go back for the tasty food and drink.", "author": "Mandissa L."}

Arrive early if you want to grab a seat because the room gets crowded on weekends after 9pm. The pianists are talented entertainers, and better singers than I expected. And by the time I left there was a crowd of people on the dance floor.\n\nThe age range here is pretty broad and there were some very entertaining older people cutting a rug with the rest of them. Songs also ranged from Brittney Spears to Elvis. A little something for everyone. \n\nOne warning- if you want to request a song when it's busy and you only give them $5, your song may never be played. The crowd we were in was forking over $20 per song request, and even up to $40 for one. This may vary by night, and is the way dueling piano bars go, but was disappointing for me since they never got to my song.", "author": "Elena K."}

I had tears, ESPN did a nice job, and the taste of the burger at that moment...I was so confused my mind capsized by the emotion of it all...Christy was the hammer. Tissue please, grown man weeping here!\n\nAnd so, my Foley's burger became the Tribute Burger and I don't think I'll ever forget it and it was outstanding,.\n\n\"Ride on\", Jose, \"Ride on\"\n\n\nSUMMARY:\n\nGreat burger, worth a cross town walk\nGreat song, Casey Kasem would be proud\nGreat Tribute to a fallen player", "author": "Jason J."}

There are many good choices, but which one? We were in such a dilemma on a recent Saturday. Then we saw a sign for an Irish pub, Johnny Foley's.\n\nA beer and menu choices that go beyond basic pub grub sounded perfect. The prices were pretty reasonable for this touristy location. The place is bigger than it first appears, which means we got a table without a wait!\n\nBe forewarned, its a bit loud and there are many TV's to watch the Warriors play. Aside from that the atmosphere has cozziness to it. We were tempted by several choices on the menu: the cottage pie, fried chicken, the soups, corned beef and cabbage, and so on. We settled on some seafood chowder to share, the fried chicken, and bangers and mash. The chowder was rich and tasty without being too salty. The entrees were very generous. Each had a deliciously smooth mound of mashed potatoes with a rich and plentiful gravy. I hate it when there isn't enough gravy. No worries of that at Johnny Foley's. There's plenty of flavorful gravy. The fried chicken was a full boneless breast and a thigh piece with a light crisp skin and crisp coleslaw. The bangers had a smooth grind and snappy casing that was really tasty. \n\nEverything was delicious and we really appreciate the talent of the kitchen that didn't just relied on salt to flavor the food. The food was good all by itself with salt to accent. The beers were great too. We just wished our stomachs were bigger, because we were so very very full. \n\nSo if you're in the neighborhood looking for a place with good value and good food stop looking at menus and just stop here.", "author": "Teresa F."}

The first time I went the bartender who was trying to help me by the name of David I believe that he is the main manager was completely rude his attitude was awful. I was trying to order a drink and in the midst he walked away, completely rude. Moving forward I ordered a drink did not tip because his service was awful tried to make the most of it that night and decided to leave. The next day I went back, David again there when I sat down he was trying to rush me to order a drink wasn't sure what I wanted and told him to give me a second. When he comes back around and I try to order, which someone had walked up behind me ordering a bunch of drinks offered me one and I told him no worries but he insisted, David comes up and says \"You know what I am not serving you have a nice night.\" So I'm sitting there confused, he comes back telling me I need to leave literally haven't even been there for more than 5mins, I ask why and he says he doesn't need a reason and he doesn't need to explain himself. As much as I wanted to curse him out I leave and talk to security. The security informs me that David had came out and said not to allow me in no more with no reasoning. The security was also confused because he had said he's only seen me once. If it wasn't for the security I would picket out and boycott this place but he was really nice and let me know David does that alot. If this was a corporate establishment I would be making a thousand complaints, but it is not so you deal with a lot of unprofessionalism. I am disgusted with how David treated me and behaved, he will be the downfall of there establishment. David get off your high horse I have spent my money here just to get disrespected the way I did, you will not be hearing the last from me! Please if you go avoid David his attitude is shitty and he is extremely disrespectful if he tries to help you go to someone else it is not worth dealing with him. Really I am more offended because I was the only one in the bar from afro\\latin decent it was nothing but white people and they were trying to kick me out. It's really saddens me that you get judged off of your looks. I have worked in management before and that is not how you handle business!", "author": "Shaudai H."}

Neither of us were particularly impressed with our food (I had fish and chips, he had corned beef and cabbage).  The real downfall though is the noise level.  We were sitting at a table and could hardly hear each other talk.  It's a big space and there's nothing to absorb any of the sound.

It's always lively, the style of the pub is very typically Irish, and the food is good. \nThere are usually bands that play here nightly, with a variety of different music styles. \nThe menu is traditional Irish style. It's got the usual shepherds pie, bangers and mash. Also has good appetizers. Have to say though that the prices really surprise me at times. Drinks are expensive, even by SF standards. Also the food is pricey. \nThe highlight is the Guinness though- the best in the city.", "author": "Derek M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-08", "description": "\"Time For a Pint!\" reads the sign above clock at the corner of O'Farrell St. & Cyril Magnin St. This San Francisco icon almost says it all. I write \"almost\" because you get so much more than a pint at Foley's. \n\nYou see, at Foley's you get a San Francisco institution, tradition, an experience uniquely Johnny Foleys.\n\nThe moment you walk through the door, you feel the warmth of the Irish. And this place is cavernous so making a body feel warm is no easy feat. But that's what you get at my favorite bar and restaurant in SF.\n\nFirst, the staff is stellar. The bartenders know how to pour a proper Guinness as well as shake a perfect Martini. This is my favorite bar in the city and it's due to the bartenders. They are professional in their white shirts and dark ties but they can also be playful and fun, especially with the locals. From behind the gloriously ornate wooden bar, you'll hear charming brogues, witness the spectacle of a mad flurry of activity, and be served a beverage that is sure to refresh and revive. These guys are the best, bar none! And they're dishy. Speaking of dishy, let's talk food.\n\nThe food is seriously superb. Recently, O, my spouse and I were staying at Bartlett's Bunkhouse just across the street. Over the course of our stay, we had three suppers at Foley's and all servings were beautifully plated and more importantly lip-licking delicious. It's near impossible for me to order anything other than Foley's cottage pie so I'm not surprised I had it two out of three meals. For my taste and from my exposure to cottage pie in SF, Foley's pie simply can't be beaten. \n\nOn our final night, O and I both had one of the night's specials: grilled pork chops and mashed potatoes. The chops were thick and juicy with grill marks so perfect and pristine in their geometry, they looked painted on. I'm a gravy guy, my Texas roots, I guess, so I was disappointed to see a towering serving of potatoes sans gravy. But after one bite, I was missing gravy no more!\n\nAnother night, O had clam chowder. Wow! Until then, our go-to place for clam chowder was a great little place in the Castro but now, we're not so sure which is best. They should call it Foley's Chunky Clam Chowder. \n\nThe Foley's atmosphere is festive and friendly. It's the kind of place you can engage with the stranger next to you who might be a local or a visitor from another country. The place is welcoming and downright familial, so much so it provides the perfect environment to either chat with your neighbor or to enjoy a solitary moment with your journal.\n\nVisually, it's a wonderland if, like me, you're seduced by old-warm charm. Be sure to take it all in from the floor to the ceiling and everything in between. \n\nMona Lisa with a Guinness mustache? You betchya!\n\nMany thanks to our warm friends at Foley's who took such great care of us during our stay. We hope to see you all again very soon. Cheers! \n\nAnd GO BULLDOGS!", "author": "Julian J."}

My friend goes every year for St. Patrick's day and says its his favorite holiday because of Johnny Foley's and their dueling piano. \nPiano's start around 8pm, we aimed for 9 and ended up showing up at 10pm where we had to wait in a line for about 40 minutes. Once we were in there was a $10 cover which I'm usually pretty meh about covers but I figured I waited in line this long I gotta go in. \nThe atmosphere was pretty cheery, good crowd all there for friendly fun, singing, dancing, and drinking. I wouldn't say there is any dueling or rivalry with these 2 pianos in the room.  It's basically write your song request on a piece of paper, put it on the piano with a big tip, and then the pianos take turns doing requests based on if they know it, and if the tip is big enough. Throw down $100 and they'll sing anything. The pianists are playing the piano and singing so they are kinda amazing- super talented folks. Even tho my Prince song was not played, it was great just to watch these people sing and play. Crowded but not overly obnoxious crowded. There was seating if you really wanted to sit. Curious to see what the dueling pianos night looks like when it's not St. Patrick's day.", "author": "Veronica L."}

But, I've got to caveat that it's dueling keyboards, not pianos.  They've literally just set a keyboard into the hull of a piano.  There were three keyboard players, who rotated throughout the night.  They take requests (choosing those with the highest tip, generally $20 or $30, first) and allow people to \"shut down\" requests if they pay more than the original tip. (i.e. If you paid $20 for \"Let It Go\", someone can pay $25 and shut the song down)\n\nThey've got tables that are first-come, first-grab.  And a dance floor in the middle, perfect for bachelorette parties, birthdays, and just general singing into the air.

I had never heard of it, but a friend who was visiting from Chicago found it online, so we decided to check it out. We went to the Dueling Pianos in the downstairs cellar, and it was equal parts fun and hilarious. They have a one-out-one-in policy at the door, but we only had to wait for about five minutes. \n\nThe music downstairs was absolutely terrific--it's all requests driven, and the pianists can play just about everything! I was surprised to find that there was a pretty packed dance floor. It took a bit to get a table, but it was never overcrowded. The drinks were delicious, and the prices weren't much more than you'd expect from your average SF bar. The decor is awesome--especially the dark red wallpaper-- and the bathrooms were clean and well-decorated as well. \n\nWe came to Johnny Foley's expecting to get some drinks but end our night elsewhere, but we had such a fun time, we ended up sticking around for last call. It was a fun, welcoming space, and I can't recommend it enough!", "author": "Olivia H."}

She seemed genuinely concerned that we were enjoying ourselves, even apologizing when I said did not care for the garlic fries. Potato skins were standard. Wings were nothing that stood out, but sit back have some beers or drinks and watch the pianists go at it. \n\nThey play for tips and the biggest tippers get their requests played. Everything from Wilson Phillips to Miley Cyrus to Taylor Swift to the anthemic \"Don't Stop Believing\"... these guys are entertaining. The crowd gets into it, sings, dances and is even allowed to participate... if the tip is right.\n\nOf course, it gets crowded, but that's half the fun.

Since this was my first time seeing this, I didn't know what to expect. At the end of the night, I was very surprised at how much fun I had!\n\nThe venue itself is split in two: sports bar on the right and dueling pianos on the left. On this occasion, we only checked out the piano bar (I'll write an updated review when I check out the sports bar in the future). There was a $10 cover up front which I expected for the show. When I arrived at the actual piano bar, it was packed with people! There were no tables for my friends and I so we stood the whole time. The bar itself was fine. On this night, there were two or three bartenders working which made for timely service. They also serve some food which I didn't try but might do so on a future occasion. \n\nThe show featured two pianist (one male and one female) who made the show lively and fun. They made the audience participate and do fun dances on stage making everyone laugh and have a good time. Also, you can make specific song requests if you tip them. When I was there, they mostly sang country songs and contemporary rap music. I liked the show a lot and would come here again with my friends.\n\nThis is a great place to spend a night if you're a fan of all types of music. The vibe is lighthearted with plenty of fun people around you. My only complaint would be the space (especially on Friday) so get there early if you want a table. I would come here again so I'll see you there!", "author": "Chris M."}

I kept thinking to myself that surely I was drunk in here years before that, but I find myself mixing this place up with Lefty O'Doul's on Geary (my review: http://bit.ly/16xkXTE). They both have active bars, mostly Norm Petersen-types looking into their emptying mugs, I'm guessing. This place is cavernous with the oddest configuration. Dividers everywhere making it feel claustrophobic despite the constant cacophony of drunken revelers (photo: http://bit.ly/1adnzcy). Jamie W. and I came here one Friday evening seeking some pub grub without the pints.\n\nWe were seated smack in the middle right near the portrait of dear ole Johnny Foley who apparently exhibited quite a tenor voice in his day (photo: http://bit.ly/18i1rMO). Jamie wasn't feeling as peckish as me and ordered the $11 Buffalo Chicken Wings with Gorgonzola Dip and Celery Sticks (photo: http://bit.ly/18i1p7L). He got eight of them, somewhat chewy in that overcooked way and lacquered with a cayenne-pepper hot sauce. It was pub grub, what do you expect? I was more ambitious and had the $29 Slow Roasted Prime Rib of Beef, which believe me, would never be mistaken for a Henry the Eighth cut at the House of Prime Rib. The beef was a 12-ounce slab heavy on the au jus but a bit chewy around the gristle.\n\nIt was surrounded by garlic mashed potatoes that were extra creamy and a mixed vegetable medley. There was a ramekin of horseradish on the side but no sign of the parsley-mint pesto advertised in the menu (photo: http://bit.ly/18JSBeM). It was what I was in the mood for, what can I say? That wasn't a deadly piece of meat, laddie. No, it wasn't brilliant but it was good craic. There, did I sound a wee bit Irish? I didn't? Well, neither did the waiter. I heard tell of the Dueling Pianos show in the cellar, but a previous experience at Jellyroll's on the Disney Boardwalk in Orlando thwarted my appetite for any future keyboard gymnastics. And I doubt I'd come back for the prime rib, but I could be convinced to have a pint on you. That would be good craic.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...regulation pub grub should meet your expectations\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...t'is a pub...a very big pub by Dublin standards, methinks\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...pretty regulation as well\nTOTAL - 3 stars...a place to hoist a few, laddie", "author": "Ed U."}

In general I don't like pub food since the best pub in existence was my mainstay during college (RIP Sean Kelly's).  As of yet, I've been no where that can top it and whenever my husband and I try one of these places out... I tend to be disappointed.  But my SanFran guide and nephew, TJ, wanted to stop in here and grab dinner before the Dueling Piano show downstairs (at 9pm).  So, we went.\n\nFood was not memorable but not bad my any means.  The quality of your food, naturally, depends on what you order.  My husband got the fish and chips and I was a little jealous.  But I'd ordered a green Thai chicken curry (it was the special?) and it was sufficiently ok.  Lots of vegetables and creamy coconut, but served with that ubiquitous rice pilaf stuff you get in bars. Service was easy peasy, even though it was pretty packed.  Pints were abundant, plentiful, and I think $8 a piece?  Even for imports.  Could definitely be worse.\n\nPart II:  I couldn't possibly overstate how much I enjoyed the piano show downstairs.  Having never been to one, I will confess, I was prepared to hate it.  We'd just come from Bourbon and Branch, which I loved, and has a completely different vibe.  Settling into my front row chair (Thanks, TJ), the waitress said there was a two drink minimum and then left for like 20 minutes.\n\nDon't make me assume my true form.\n\n(I actually drank water the whole show without reprisal.  I was already completely snickered, so, good job on that one.  You blinked first, lady.)\n\nTodd and... $hit.  Todd and his compadre were lovely and talented.  Although they didn't know 2 Chainz's \"Birthday Song\" I did get them to play Beyonc\u00e9's \"Single Ladies,\" and laughed hysterically the whole time.\n\nBeing the saucy wench that I am, I bantered back and forth with the performers all night.  That is, until things backfired, went south, the whole nine.  Todd pulled me up on stage (despite a lot of drunk-a$$ resistance) and sat me on top of the stage.  Todd's friend (I am so sorry) went on break, and he sang... \"F*** Her Gently\" to me, in front of about 75 strangers.  My husband (darling that he is) got it all on video (it's ok honey, I'm playing the long game).  I tried to be a good sport.  But I was about as red as the Kremlin. The whole song.\n\nBravo, you guys.  You'll see \"that loud-a$$ girl from Miami\" soon enough.", "author": "Lacey C."}

It was excellent with Guinness on tap.  Great atmosphere.  Good mix of tourists and locals.  Very authentic, if you are looking for that pub experience and feel.  Within walking distance to many of the local hotels.  I was staying at the Post Hotel around the corner and decided to pop in for dinner.  As Foley's sign says, \"It was time for a pint!\" The Guinness was great on tap.  Was greeted by the very friendly and cute blonde hostess and told it would be about a 15min wait.  I ordered a pint ($8.75 plus tip so $10 per pint) in the waiting area and brought it with me to my table.  $20 for Shepard's pie and $8 for bread was a little pricey, but I had heard good things and it is San Francisco after all.  The place was full with lots of interesting people.  Some Asian Businessmen next to me were trying the dark Guinness Stout for the first time and really enjoying it. The Shepard's pie came and was perfectly prepared.  I downed two additional pints during the course of the meal.  I was feeling no pain.  They must have thought I was a tourist, because they tried to pull a fast one.  When the bill came they had billed me for four pints at $10/pint.  Believe me when you are paying that much for a beer, you keep track.  I argued with the waiter that if I had drank half a gallon of beer(Four pints = 2 quarts) in an hour I probably wouldn't be able to stand, let alone walk back to my hotel.  I'm sure they pad the bill this way with a lot of tourists, who don't notice. In the end, it wasn't worth ruining the experience over $10 bucks, but I will think twice about going back.", "author": "Sean F."}

Two drink minimum in the downstairs piano bar with a limited pub menu.   No option for full menu items.  Between the six of us, we ordered 24 drinks throughout the night (4 hours). Total tab at the end of the night with food (6 items) was just over $450.  That's not a typo.  $450.  Plus tip and bribes to the piano players so they'd play our songs. So, great time but don't think I'll ever go again as I can drink at any other number of bars for a fraction of the cost.", "author": "Matt C."}

Except Johnny Foley's!  They won our business for their slightly overpriced Irish beers (two pints for $15) by default of the fact that they were literally the only non-hotel bar open.  \n\nDespite being near tourist central, they actually had a pretty good crowd of locals and tourists alike.  The space is big, so it would be a great spot to bring a group.  The live music was pretty good as well.  Though I didn't expect Johnny Cash covers in an Irish bar in San Francisco, it worked.\n\nWhile I had hoped our one night out in San Fran would have included a more bespoke cocktail at Local Edition, Johnny Foley's came through in a pinch (with cider on draft!), and, for that, I am a  fan.", "author": "Kristin B."}

Our server had several tables and consequently never refilled waters, checked on the table after the food was served, and my wife had to stand up to flag her down just to get the check so we could leave.

I had just had dinner with friends and they decided to come here for some drinks. When I arrived the bouncer saw my doggy bag and said he couldn't let me in with it. I told him that I just ate and that it was my leftovers. He told me that it didn't matter, they don't allow outside food.\n\nSeriously? I get that the place is probably trying to sell their own food, but you're in an area filled with many other food establishments. It's not unheard of to eat some place and drink some place else with leftovers in tow. Homeless people should hang out in front of this place. They're more likely to get some food from patrons discarding their food before entering.\n\nThe policy is really stupid. If you catch me eating my outside food in your establishment or just making a mess with it, then fine, ask me to leave. But don't ask me to throw it out before entering for fear that I might eat that instead of ordering something out your menu.\n\nFortunately, I didn't have to throw out my food because one of my friends grabbed my food and stuffed it in her big-ass purse.\n\nAs for service inside, my entire group wasn't thrilled with it. A couple of times out waitress would come by and ask if we needed anything, we would check among ourselves if we wanted to get anything else, but less than 5 seconds later she would be gone.\n\nOn the plus side, they have Irish beers besides Guinness, not that there is anything wrong with Guinness (I love Guinness), but it's nice to see more; Murphy's Irish Stout and Kilkenny Cream Ale are a couple.", "author": "Dennis Z."}

The staff seem young, pretty and friendly. The food tasted as if there was at least one stick of butter in everything, but it wasn't too sweet or salty. The crab cakes had a very generous serving of crabs, but one was a bit burned while the other seemed a bit pale and undercooked. The mushroom ravioli was very moist and cooked just right. The bangers and mash fell short of expectation with very creamy mashed potatoes and nicely steamed broccoli but just average sausages. The room is decorated from top to bottom with framed pictures of people and other things. The center of the room is bare, and, especially with tile floors, it can give off a somewhat cold impression when the place is not as crowded. Overall, not a bad place for a night of no-frills beer and simple food for those who want to avoid the hipster, crowded and unduly fancy places. There were, however, kids running around. So might not be ideal for those who need a night away from the kids.", "author": "Kimberly H."}

There is a two drink minimum for the tables, but it's well worth it and it's not too overpriced for being in Union Square. At around 9pm, they start the show and let you know how it goes -- song requests with $$$ get played and if there's a special occasion (ie birthday, anniversary, new job, etc), let them know and they'll celebrate by serenading you with a song...

It is just like a pot pie but without the crust (which I love) and the mashed potato on top was nice and smooth!  Not too heavy either and not drowning in the gravy - perfect balance.\n3. Corned beef and cabbage. Always makes me think of the little green leprechaun and St. Patty's day! Excellent texture and the parsley cream sauce is a nice touch.  The corned beef was a tinge salty but I can't remember having corned beef that wasn't salty at all so I still enjoyed it a lot.\n\nIt gets really loud in here so probably not the right place for a family reunion unless you're all there to drink and be merry!", "author": "Mercy D."}

Let me tell you why.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to venture into this fine establishment come the beginning weeks in December, you'll be in for a treat. You won't know it right away, but you, my friend, have stumbled into the drinking mecca of nerdom. \n\nFor one week in December this bar is crawling with a strange group of mammals known as GEOSCIENTISTS. This phenomenon occurs during one of the largest scientific conferences in the world: AGU. This annual nerdfest single-handedly increases the the population of brainiacs in Union Square manyfold. After hours, this is where it all happens. Probably some of the best scientific connections have been made and incredible scientific ideas have emerged here. \n\nThe breed of human known as geoscientists may appear odd at first, in their pleated pants, tweed jackets, glasses, and blue name tags, but you should know that they are, in fact, MUCH more odd than you can even begin to imagine. I would know, I am one of them (without the tweed jacket of course). With that being said, this bar does an excellent job at facilitating the bashful intoxication of hundreds of the worlds finest scientists, and for that I salute you John Foley. \n\nThis bar is a MUST stop after a long afternoon of standing around drinking beer and listening to people talk about things way over your head.. wait.. I meant learning about the latest and greatest science (yes, you just read that correctly, they serve beer at our conferences, be jealous). \n\n95% of the time I'm here, I get the Smithwick's because I can't pass that up when it's on tap. Really, no one should. Then we'll end up doing some inappropriately named shots while screaming to our colleagues over the loud live music. \n\nAh, Foleys, I have nothing but fond memories (at least the ones I remember) of you and I guarantee I'll be seeing you more than my fair share come this December.", "author": "Alicia K."}

The import and domestic beers were pricey for my group. While we enjoyed our stellas, we only ordered one round at $7.50 a piece. \n\nBottom Line:\nThis bar has a wonderful atmosphere with friendly staff, and good taste in musical performers.

The location is excellent, right near Union Square and very visible.  Loved the ambiance, too.  This place has lots of character!\n\nFOOD:  Meh.  The corned beef panini left much to be desired- very dry and not much sauerkraut/cheese.  The veggie panini however (which we ordered on a recommendation from our server) was delicious!  \n\nSERVICE:  Our server was fantastic.  She was clearly very busy and had several tables at once, but she was prompt and most importantly, was hospitable.  The bartender (we sat at the bar for a few drinks before being sat) was efficient, so that was nice.  \n\nHowever, they need some improvement with their host stand.  We stood for several minutes before being greeted, and then probably another 5 before making contact with the hostess.  When she finally appeared, she was rude and short and acted like she was doing us a favor by seating us.  She seemed pretty stressed- I'm not sure if she was waiting tables in addition to hosting, or what.  And to top it off, she told us it would be 20-25 minutes, so naturally we went and got drinks at the bar.  No sooner had he poured the beers but we found out our table was ready!  No problem, I'm happy to be seated, but bummer that we couldn't have just ordered those drinks from our server.  \n\nMy  advice to this establishment would be to hire a helpful, friendly host staff.

But I'll touch on my faves:\n\nAmbiance: I like that it's sectioned off a few times.  An area in the front, another area in the middle, an area in the back (where the band plays), and a few side rooms, even one nook for a little privacy.  For some reason, not sure if it was the place itself, the bartender uniforms, bartenders themselves, or what, but it kinda felt like a throwback being in there, in a good way.  Respectable crowd, no ruckus, and a table opened up within minutes of being there.  The live band added a nice touch; they didn't dominate the place, but just complemented the already-good-time-vibe.\n\nService/Hospitality: The bartenders here are awesome.  Skilled, efficient, VERY professional, I love!  They learned my drink orders quickly (Captain Diet with a lime + shots of Jameson, with a glass of water), which I'm such a sucker for.  I can't remember the latter part of our time there (for obvious reasons), but I'm almost positive they threw me a buyback or two.\n\nFYI: The shots are the big gulp kind, worth $9 (Jameson), unlike other bars who give you shots in a glass that's more like an illusion (aka really thick glass for no reason so that it just looks like you have a big shot when you really don't).\n\nI'm a fan!", "author": "Carla C."}

The pianists are uber talented and hilarious! I was blown away when they rapped \"Empire State of Mind\" and \"Thriftshop\"!!! \n\nIf you are here celebrating a friend's birthday, make their night by requesting a birthday song! (The more money you put in for the request, the better it will be!) They will customize a personal birthday song to you AND THEY ARE HILARIOUS!! \n\nComing back a second time, some of the birthday songs were repeated and reused so my 2nd experience was more predictable...but nevertheless I still had a blast.\n\nThe piano dueling show starts at 9pm and it can get pretty packed so go early to avoid the lines and to grab a table!\n\nPS: if you're wondering why its called dueling piano, it is because if you don't like a song that was requested, you can up the amount of tip that was put in for the unwanted song and change the song. Whoever requested the first song can then up that person's amount to go back to the previous song and it can keep going and going, like a duel! \n\n(sorry if that doesn't quite make sense...) \n\nBut I recommend checking this place at least once!", "author": "Eileen Z."}

I was glad to find this restaurant.  The portions were huge.  The GF ordered the buffalo/chicken wings and a dozen came with the order.  I ordered the bangers and mash and the plate was huge (as you can probably see in the pictures).  The prices were very affordable and the taste was just as good.\n\nThe waitress was very nice, she seemed a little slow but made up for it with her pleasing attitude.  My only complaint would be where we sat.  We were seated in the bar area where there is a booth along the wall and chairs on the opposite side of the table.  There is absolutely no cushioning so if I leaned against the booth wall it was solid wood and there were these wooden posts along the booth that jabbed at my shoulder when I leaned back.

You have dueling pianos, basically two guys singing and playing the piano together in harmony but the songs they pick are songs that everyone knows, so the whole crowd is just singing along while drinking or eating.  I came on a sat night and there were 2 girls that had a birthday.  He put them on the middle of the dance floor and he made up songs about them which were just hilarious.  I wish I remembered them!! But I just remembered laughing a lot and having a good time, even while standing in the corner.  \n\nDrinks were about $8-10 bucks.

I've been here a handful of times and it's always fun.\n\nThey play everything from Sinatra to BEP to 2pac to NIN.  You can request songs (for $ of course).  They won't usually know the latest hits you hear on the radio.  I guess it takes them a couple of months to memorize the newest songs.  \n\nNote: If they ever invite the craziest person in the bar to jump onto the pianos and that person is you, don't literally jump onto the pianos.  They don't like that.  They want you to just sit on top of the pianos.  \n\nI've heard from others that it's only fun for the first three or four visits because they start playing the same songs over and over...\n\nGreat if you want to just have fun with live music and cheap drinks in a bar with great energy.  There's not much room to dance, but who goes to a bar like this to dance anyway?  Like I said earlier, don't try to dance on the pianos because they don't like it.  \n\nNote:  You'll never get any reception down there, and you'll be lucky to find an open table on a weekend.", "author": "Richard T."}

I have a small place in my heart for this kind of stuff. I'm a huge fan of piano music/improv (having played piano since I was 2 years old... I know... so Asian...) and these guys actually do it pretty well. There's the upper floor which is just the bar/restaurant, if you want to do that, and there's the lower floor with the actual pianos and bar.\n\nI've actually been to both. We held a birthday party in the upstairs part with food and everything, and I have to say the food is okay. It's not the best food I've ever had, but it seems like basic Irish fare. I had the chicken, which was a lot larger than I expected... and all the other stuff looked pretty decent. The bar part... is crazy nasty... super sticky... everywhere... the tables, the chairs, the floor... omg... don't touch anything because it's probably covered in alcohol... XD\n\nI like the downstairs better, but be prepared to not have any sort of meaningful conversation... and to go when it's slightly earlier to get a table if you want one. It gets super crowded too, so if you're xenophobic... highly not recommended you try getting into this. The drinks are decent, and when you have some overzealous friends break lots of glasses, the staff are pretty quick about cleaning that stuff up... so people don't hurt themselves... so that's a plus.\n\nDrinks are generally the average SF price, and I don't remember there every being a cover when I went (but I think there is after a certain time... so you'll have to check the other Yelp reviews for that). It's a great place to start off a night! The only place I can think of that comes close to beating it is the dueling piano bar in Seattle bar \"Chopstix\".", "author": "Denise C."}

If I could give this place 10 stars, I most certainly would.  This place rocks!\nLet me start off by saying that, for obvious reasons, I was not involved in the planning process.  My husband worked with the manager, Mary, and he had nothing but great things to say about her.  She worked with him every step of the way.  After all the festivities were over, she phoned us a few days later to get our feedback and to see if everything was to our liking.  It couldn't have gone better.  \nBut let me start at the beginning.  We arrived late in the afternoon a few Saturdays ago and were escorted to a private back room where friends and family were waiting to surprise me.  There were flowers and candles on all the tables and a glass of chilled champagne was handed to me!  My husband had made a custom CD of my fave tunes and they played it on their sound system.  Sweet!\nIt was a catered affair.  Chicken satay appetizers, baby potatoes, kale salad and chicken curry.  I wish I had bought my tupperware . . . the food was that good!  They made up a special kids menu for all the younguns.  And the Shirley temples were flowing!  The kids could also order their own dessert!  And speaking of the bar, fabulous!  The drinks were stiff and quality.  No two buck chuck.  My husband only drinks Guinness when he goes home to Ireland, but he said they really know how to pour a pint here.  The bar business back in Ireland is a serious business.  It's not something you do to work your way through college.  It is a real profession and, as such, they take it very seriously.  Johnny Foley's is the same.  They are top notch professionals, but with all the warmth and humor that only the Irish have.  They could not have been more welcoming with our large party which ranged in age from 3 to almost 80.  There were almost 50 of us and they took such good care of us.  \nMary was the manager that my husband worked with.  Kate was the day manager on duty when we arrived at 4:30 in the afternoon.  Ollie and Christy were part of the staff that worked the event and I'm sorry if I am forgetting anybody else by name.  But kudos to Johnny Foley's for being a great run business.  Great food, good drinks, warm and welcoming atmosphere.  It will now be our go to destination for big events or parties.  We can't recommend it highly enough!", "author": "Kendall H."}

I know of few places in the Bay that carry Murphys. \n\nIn terms of vibe, definitely crowded for middle of the week. It seemed like there were both post-work folks grabbing a drink mixed in with a good number of tourists (I imagine Foley's proximity to Union Square helps).\n\nFinally, their fish chips were heavy but still good? Went well with my Harp. I'll probably make my way back here - not so much because anything stood out - more so for the Murphys, the convenience of the location, and probably to check out their Dueling Piano Bar.", "author": "Kimya P."}

The Irish pub has become a pretty ubiquitous establishment in every major city, and it inevitably draws in an English speaking (or, alternately, an Anglophile) crowd. Clever restaurateurs have seized on this, and now exploit the Emerald Isle for all it is worth in terms of tourist dollars.\n\nThe food is decent, but overpriced. I do like that they have oysters, and better yet-- oyster shooters!\n\nThe drinks are drinks, and priced in conjunction with the neighborhood. Beer is your best bet, price wise.\n\nStaff was friendly to us, and fairly on top of things considering the crowd. Two points for that alone.", "author": "Wes T."}

It brought back good memories of the piano bar that I checked out in San Diego a few years ago. These guys were just as hilarious with the corruption of familiar tunes and having the audience sing along and dance either in their seats, on the small makeshift dance floor, heck even next to the pianos. The drink prices were pretty good too. Felt it was only natural to have myself a Guinness since it is an Irish Pub. \n\nProps to the guys who played my requests, which were pretty much 80s songs.

Or, at least it seemed like it, since more 70's &80's songs were playing..\n3. Your experience definitely depends on the pianist - my friends and I wanted to get some 90's into the mix, but an older pianist claimed he didn't know the tune of /how to play the Backstreet Boys...  It wasn't until our song request was passed onto a younger pianist that we finally got our song! \n\nI do appreciate the fact that some of the younger pianists were playing more contemporary songs, like Adele.. and even Edward Maya's StereoLove?! What's great is that they had the pianos, but also some electronic bass that they could set up for back-up!\n\n*Tip - Parking in SF always gets groans from people.. but!

For those of you like me who hadn't heard of such a thing before, I'll try my best to explain it but I definitely suggest experiencing one for yourself! There are two piano's sitting in the center of the room pushed together and facing each other. There are tables surrounding it as if you are at a show rather than a bar. The piano players were extremely engaging with the audience the whole time. People are always going up on the stage to write down song requests along with a tip on top of the piano. A bunch of people were celebrating birthdays that night, and they were constantly being called up on stage being embarrassed by the lively entertainment. It's a great place to go with groups (if you get there early enough) and the crowd varied in age, yet everyone seemed to be having a wonderful time.\n\nIt was a great time and if you are traveling to the city anytime soon, I highly recommend it!

But I will, because I love Johnny Foley's so much.  I don't quite remember how I stumbled upon this place (or down into it- the best time you will ever have is in the Cellar), but it is something I thank the fates for every day. Every Wednesday through Saturday night, you will find two hilarious (and talented!) piano players battling away for tips from the crowd.  The weapons of choice? Whatever YOU want to hear. Whether it's that new one from Beyonce, a Brooks & Dunn classic, or your mom's favorite Lovin' Spoonful song, they probably know it.  Just be sure to come with plenty of cash in hand, these guys don't take cards, and the place is usually packed with people, all of who want to hear their song played. And that song is usually Journey.\n\nThe show starts at 9 or 9.30, but it is recommended that you get there early, as space is rather limited. Food menus are available, but if you are looking for a full meal, you might be better off sticking to the main restaurant/bar upstairs, which offers everything from shellfish to burgers to steaks to panini. The restaurant also features nightly live music, though sadly no one is dueling- which would be fun to see.  Bring your guitar and see what happens!\n\nThe Cellar at Johnny Foley's also makes for a great birthday, bachelor or bachelorette party, but make sure the guest of honor isn't bashful- the guys behind the pianos go above and beyond for them and make sure the whole bar knows who they are. It is a fabulous time.  I think I already said it was the best time you will ever have, didn't I?", "author": "Libby W."}

The only thing about the fries is that it looks as if they just spooned the garlic on the Fries. I don't toss the fries and garlic before service, which will lead to some fries not having any garlic at all, or too much.\nThe chicken skewers were bland, but I did like the cucumber sauce that came with the dish.\n\nI don't think I will be returning back here, there are  many other pubs to try elsewhere !", "author": "Alex F."}

I found this place originally to watch the Euro Cup back in like 2004 maybe. Saddled up to the bar and sat for hours. The drinks kept coming and as their effect was had the bartender and I became better and better friends. Funny how that works out.  Any guy at a bar wants to believe they could be a local there. These guys are great at that. So much so that now that I live in SF i like to come in around 7pm and catch the \"conference guy\" who stopped in for a round after their 3pm \"property tax and you\" seminar and never left. They are usually the guy sitting there talking about how they love \"football\" and \"chips\" and once had a Guinness in Dublin. But the bartenders never seem to mind.  They'll keep that guy happy as easily as they welcome the post-work crowd in and then the 10pm pre-clubbing/shots-shots-shots rush. The recent move to Jameson usurping Jaeger as the go to shot only amplifies this experience. To be able to be adept at both Irish-sports bar and shot-slinger in the same shift is impressive. I think it's telling that first bartender i had still works here.  Very fun guys that guarantee anyone sitting at their bar will have a great time. \n\nIt's a little pricey even for SF.  \n\nPro-tip: Murphy's on tap is an increasingly rare find. Do it.

At J.Follly, I showed them the recipe on my phone and Benny was like 'oh, you want a Negroni/French75? Sure'.

We were kinda looking for a place where we would sit down and have some beers.  So, we ended up coming here.\n\nIt wasn't as crowded as I thought it would be, and we got a table.  Unfortunately, it was really in a dark spot near the wall, and there was a candle, which gave the most light.  I asked the waitress to get another glass of candle and she did.  So, that was great.\n\nWe ordered drinks, then looked at the menu.  One friend had to bring up his iPhone 4 to brighten so he could see it better.  We talked about the foods, like recommendations and Ireland is known for its fish and chips, so that's what I told them and two guys ordered that.  I got a salmon.  It was good but strangely, it didn't have any horse radishes - that got me confused.  Horseradishes really help to spice up the taste in the salmon.  One girl had a curry kind of a meal, maybe with chicken.  \n\nSo, we ate, had some beers, and just catching up with each other because one couple just got back from Washington, DC, where they're studying at Gallaudet University.\n\nExpect the menu to be pricey, so some stayed with just appetizers.", "author": "Nathan K."}

The food tastes a bit better than usual \"pub grub\" but not as posh as the \"gastro pub\" fare that is popping up all over.  Which, I prefer.  I mean \"Gastro Pub?\" \n\nNo.", "author": "Gina H."}

After a while, we started to get hungry but couldn't make up our minds on what to get. If there's one thing I've learned, it's that there are few things more dangerous to men than a hungry woman! I've got a real affinity for Irish pubs, so upon passing by and seeing the sign saying \"Irish House\", that was it. Got seated, looked over the menu, and ordered a pint of Smithwick's. I ended up getting the corned beef and \"cabbage\" sandwich (the reason I put that in \" \" is because it's what was done on the menu and they use sauerkraut) which was fantastic! My girlfriend got the steak sandwich, which was REALLY good. I'll probably have to get that next time I'm there. Also ended up trying their Irish coffee and for dessert we split the Irish coffee tiramisu.

Actually, we were going to go to Lefty O'Douls, but my friend called me from there and she said that was NOT the place to be.\n\nWe started walking around looking for a place, getting nervous because we were about 10 min from kick-off, when we saw a small line started outside of this place. We decided to hop in line too, and were reassured when we saw a sign that said they WERE playing the game.\n\nIt wasn't a long wait to get a seat at a counter - we wanted to eat *and* watch the game - and we got kinda make-shift seats but were accomodated even still. To my enjoyment, they had Carlsberg on tap, which is kind of hard to find here in the US.\nMy friend asked the waitress what to get, and ended up ordering the grilled chicken panini. I got pesto with grilled chicken. We both enjoyed our meals well enough, but she didn't like her mojito. To me, it was pretty weak and not worth the $13 she paid for it.\n\nBut what really made our experience was the whole atmosphere of watching the game. There were tons of soccer fans and everyone was getting really into the game, even with the US losing.\n\nI'd like come again to explore their menu, but after I save a bit of money.

We were seated, our waiter was friendly, we ordered some fried calamari and onion strips to much on, and the beer was not watered down.  Solid.  Even better was that the onion strips were well-seasoned and NOT soggy like most onion strips out there in the world.\n\nThe second visit I had just walked out on The Worst Indian I'd Ever Had, was desperate for anywhere serving food at 10:45pm, and saw that this place was packed and proudly served until 1am.  Solid.  Except..... I waited for 5 minutes with no host to seat me.  And then did a walk-around looking for a spot to sit or a way to order at the bar.  Nada on both counts.  I left lonely, hungry, and wanting a beer even more than when I came in.\n\nAverage it all out and I do think I've experienced better.  But hey, what are the odds you'll walk in those shoes?

The hostess said it was not a problem and took us right to a table.  We ordered two bowls of clam chowder, which was quite good, but it was barely warm.  We also ordered curry fries and onion straws... These dishes both were soggy and cold so the watiress (who was great) brought them back to the kitchen.  However, the fryers were already shut down so they took them off the check.   What I realized is that when we ordered our food, the kitchen was already shut down, hence the cold food.

Everyone is extremely friendly, even the pianists.  They really involve everyone in the songs, pull people up on stage, battle each other, make the crowds battle each other, and gives birthday people plenty of attention.  Be sure to carry tons of $1's and $5's so you guarantee your song gets played.  You drop off your song sheet and $$ on the piano then they'll play your song according to how much you tip...or the number of requests they received.  \n\nMy only complaint is that they made my drink wrong and put salt around the rim of my glass instead of sugar.

The place is located by union square so your pockets will be pretty empty by the end of the night, but it's a fun atmosphere and good food.  As for the dueling pianos....what a cool shindig.  Never heard of dueling pianos before my friend took me here.  It's a nice spot downstairs with an intimate feeling and another bar.  There were 3 piano players rotating throughout the night.  2 of them were flamboyantly gay, but could sing really well.  Request music and make sure to tip or else they'll call you out in front of everyone.  They're very sassy, a little rude, but really funny.

But it did happen there. And he was pretty hot. And I am pretty taken, so it doesn't really matter anyway.\n\nJohnny Foley's is also a good place to take your manorexic best friend who hasn't eaten all day but has burnt a lot of calories pushing food around on his plate and also happens to have been pounding mimosas and beers since noon. By 9 p.m., when you get to Foley's, he'll be dropping pints of Guiness on the floor because he lacks the strength to grip the glass. Two times is ok, but on the third dropped Guiness, you're going to want to put him in a taxi home and keep the brits for yourself.\n\nGo to Foley's. It's big. It's comfortable.

The formula is pilsner and hard cider and is a decidely higher alcohol content than beer alone, though easier on the pallet than snorting testy (and sometimes cloying) ciders all night. It doesn't take a bartender on the Space Shuttle to mix one for you, though many younger Big City mixologists look at you askance when ordering. Let me tell you, when Grunge ruled the city and ponytailed men stomped around in shorty longs with thermals showing, most hotel bartenders would have one in your paw in a hot minute.

And judging from the prices, I can't imagine going into Johnny Foley's without a hook-up. Woo doggy is it pricey! $11 for two lamb sliders about half the size of my palm? Bitch, please!\n\nMy friend Robert organized a bunch of people to get together as one of his friends is one of the piano players. Dueling pianos was on the menu, which sounded intriguing and had heard it was a good time. So why the hell not? So I went for the dueling pianos last night thinking \"Oh, it's a Sunday. I don't want to be hung over tomorrow and I want to be in bed around 11. I'll be here for an hour or so.\"\n\nAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA..........AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!\n\nGod it was SUCH a fabulous time! The piano players were funny and talented, inserting nasty lyrics where they felt appropriate, calling out special occasions (playing \"I like big butts\" for some girls from Alabama while they shook it on stage) and generally making the evening enjoyable for everyone. \n\nMy friend Brian and I broke in the dance floor to I don't know what but what ever it was, the piano players were happy to comment on how awesome we looked (side note: Brian can make anyone look good. Especially when he has enough space to do aerials. I *heart* aerials). \n\nIn fact they were happy to comment on everything. Including my breasts. I shit you not; direct quote \"You can serve drinks on those things!\" I had no idea if I should be horrified or flattered. I think I got away with a little of both and a very red face.\n\nIn the end I didn't leave until the show was done, around 12:30. I sang at the top of my lungs to the point where my voice is now hoarse, had about 5 drinks and an app and left the bar about $70 poorer. Usually that alone would dock the review starage at least by one but if I could, I would give this evening 1000 stars.\n\nKevin, you fucking ROCK!!!!", "author": "Alexis B."}

The minute I stepped into Foley's, I already felt the spirit and excitement of St. Patty's Day. Crowds of green, decorations, and the employees welcoming groups in with free give aways (green beads and little chotchkies sponsored by various beer companies).  A waitress placed a clover headband on my head right as I stepped in (Thanks! I wore this ridiculous thing shamelessly down the street!). \n\nAlthough crowded, we didn't wait too long for a table for 7. They have a good menu selection of Irish dishes (specials of lamb stew & corned beef for Patty's Day), burgers, potpies, even oysters. Oh, and a kids menu for the little ones. In honor of the day, I selected the corned beef dish complete with potatoes & veggies ($17 for the plate). It ended up being a really good dish. Flavorful, and satisfying! Topped off with a nice cold creamy cup of Guinness. Cheers to good food and drinks!\n\nThe atmosphere was great, fun, and very much lively. Pretty decent sized place, with tv screens playing classic Irish movies. And of course Irish music, but one of the best parts was the live music that came through. The service was great, and the waitress was very nice. \n\nOverall, I had a blast, and this definitely made my St. Patty's Day. I wish I got to stay longer and enjoy the festivities of the day!

To send over the manger to lecture me on the inappropriateness, and illegality, of my child's drinking beer.\n\nPeople - I respect that you have to watch your butts vis a vis the State liquor guys but holy GOD... this was overreaction in the extreme.  When I protested that it was an innocent event, and they shouldn't worry a bit, I was... lectured FURTHER.\n\nIf this has been an isolated incident of gruff or off-handed service I would say \"bad night, bossy manager... maybe a one off.\"  But it wasn't.\n\nI've been to Johnny Foley's several times since they reopened and it's been the same scene - NO warmth, really.

We weren't really hungry, so I can't say anything about the large plates on the menu, but the calamari and the clam chowder were decent.\n\nThe calamari was interesting.  It was seasoned in something spicy that made it taste almost like taco meat.  The funky mexi-pubfood blend was a bit disconcerting.  By far, not the worst pub calamari I've had -- it served nicely as finger food to go with beer.\n\nOh, and what beer it was.  The first sight on entering the place is an oblong view of a row of taps, clearly labeled with backlit handles -- Guinness, Harp, Smithwicks, Magners, Chimay, and a host of others.  The beer selection here is solid and dependable.\n\nOur table service was prompt, attentive, and friendly, especially for a crowded, busy bar.  I've only got two complaints about this place, and given what it is, they're pretty minor:\n\nFirst, for the level of crowd noise in the room, it's pointless to play indistinguishable music quietly.  Either play music that the crowd will get into, or play music that will blend seamlessly into the background.  As it was, the noise of crowd muffled most of the mid-range from the music, so all you were left with was some bass-line and whatever high tones made it out of the speakers...  The same song sounded like U2, Guns'n'Roses, and Matchbox 20 at different times -- it just frustrated me to try to figure out what the hell was playing.\n\nSecond, the decor and space combine to produce a really strange feeling.  There was a large (like twice lifesize) portrait painting of Bono on the wall next to us, flanked on each side by stuffed, antlered deer heads.  Bono and the deer were both looking off into the distance in the same direction, and it kinda seemed like his head was stuffed and mounted as well.  The ceilings are really high, but there are standard height partition walls placed somewhat haphazardly, which makes you feel small and claustrophobic at the same time.", "author": "Jay M."}

We had an hour before a show we were catching, and let our server know that we were in a rush. We had our drinks, salad, meal and were out the door in 45 minutes. That might not seem like much, but I've tried to grab \"a quick bite\" at places like this before and found myself asking for a \"to go\" bag as soon as the food finally arrived. Not the case here.

He couldn't finish it and was excited to take a 'goody' bag of leftovers to hand to a homeless person on the way back to Bart! I wasn't too hungry and settled with a spinach, grape tomato, onion salad - it was huge for only $9 - loved the grape tomatoes which I'd never tried before and of course more leftovers!

I went there to meet up with out-of-towners last night and was hit by a wall of human sweat upon entry, other than the jam-packed nature of the place though there was noting to complain about.  There was a folksinger loudly covering Air Supply in the back.\n\nStill the thing I remember most about Foley's is the other time I went in and ate some bar food, some kind of Guinness stew.  I shared it with another, but there was still more than enough food to make me feel bloated full.   The food must have been decent, if a bit processed, 'cause I ate enough.  The point is that the portions were huge!\n\nThis didn't stop the couple at the next table - tourists from the Mid-West I assumed from their accents and dress - from ordering three appetizers, splitting a bowl of stew (just as we had) and each eating a full Cheesecake factory size entree.  I was awed by the sheer caloric intake!  This couple had just devoured more k-cals than an oil drum full of jet fuel.  They looked satisfied upon completing this gluttonous feast, and then, after a pause, the woman said calmly, with a small speculative tilt of her head, \"You know, I could use a little something more.\"\n\nI know, you're thinking, these were hungry fat people, but that was the odd thing, they weren't.  They were big sure, she at least 5'11\", he 6'4\", and large boned (knuckles the size of bison bones), even a little chubby, but nothing abnormal, nothing to indicate that 6-8lbs of food would leave them peckish.", "author": "Gustie L."}

First off, it's hard to really dock this place too many points because it is what it is, a by-the-numbers Irish pub that you could find in any of the fifty American states, all serving the same provincial menu of Americanized Shepard's pie, undercooked pannini's and oyster's with lemon juice, and of course, a place where you feel slightly queasy subsequent. \n\nBeer selection is normal and the bartenders were basic and humdrum as was everything, including an overabundance of god-fearing Midwestern tourists, probably intimidated by any real culture, so they slothed back to things that remind them of Kansas City or whatever. Needless to say, a quick bite, a quick beer, we were gone and on our to the way Nite Cap to get shitty, and I assure you next time, I'll just pop into a TL Thai house!! With so many wonderful, charming authentic restaurants and Irish pubs, this feels like something out of O'Hare Airport!! \n\nOh, and the couple next to us literally moved down a barstool and and glared uneasily at us, I'm assuming because of the tattoos, greasy hair and educations, but we couldn't stop staring at his plaid shorts and tucked in yellow golf shirt and her terrifying fumpa!!", "author": "Steve l."}

On a Saturday afternoon when my wife tackled the shopping at Union Square, I snuck down O'Farrell Street and came across Johnny Foley's. Sure as hell beat DSW Shoes. The crowd was pretty good, I was certainly not the only guy ducking the retail that day.\n\nThe place does well dressed as an Irish Pub and is certainly more authentic to what you'd find in Dublin than other places around San Francisco. It did well to pass on the Irish trinkets glued to the wall and instead has dark wood, etched mirrors, paintings, and matted posters and photos. The flooring, walls, trim, and casework all look like they have been there a while and not part of an Irish Pub kit you've probably seen elsewhere. In short, you feel like you're in the right spot and the surrounding neighborhood fits it relatively well. The bar, signage, and taps are particularly well done.\n\nThe beers on tap are the standard ones, nothing interesting but definitely a good assortment, and the food was surprisingly good for a pub. When my wife joined me, she had a pretty darn good salad and we split some lamb sliders that were pretty legit. So now it's not just a pub, but a restaurant.\n\nThe service was good, nothing stood out or otherwise, and there were some TV's on showing the winter X-Games which people were actually watching with some enthusiasm. The music was some general rock, no live bands at the time though it sounds like the dueling pianos at night are something to be seen. It's a good layout, the Irish House is deep and has many neat nooks to separate your group from the noise if that's what you want. \n\nI love places like this, Johnny Foley's does it well and is as good a place as any for a quick Guinness, a bite to eat, to watch the game, or live music at night with some friends. Almost as good as it gets and perhaps I change my rating if I get there on a Saturday night.", "author": "Dave C."}

Mediocre food. \n\nFood: As a steadfast rule, I go for the fish and chips every time I try a new pub.  Unfortunately, at Johnny Foley's the fish is full of bones.  One of my pieces was good. No bones. Decent flavor. The other piece, however, was like eating a fried fish ribcage.  Had our waitress stopped by more often, or even more than once, I would have asked her for a new piece, and some lemons to go with... don't lemons always come with fish and chips?  Apparently not at Mr. Foley's.  The beer selection was OK.  Enough to choose from, but nothing too exotic. \n\nStaff:  The hostess was super friendly but over worked.   Most restaurants employ several hostesses during  a dinner rush, apparently not Johnny.  The bar keeps were kind, and offered us tastings of the beers we were deciding between. Great service.  The waitress was also friendly, but either had too many tables, or simply forgot about us, as our table was literally in the lobby area.  It was kinda like sitting at the kids' table on Thanksgiving; we were still a part of the party, but could see what was going on in the other room, and it looked like they were having a lot more fun.  \n\nAtmosphere. Lively, and pub-esque: loud, bustling and full of kind and jovial people.  Great vibe.  \n\nBottom Line:  I would hang out at Johnny's again for the great atmosphere, and the awesome bar tenders.

It is a block away from H and M and I love it also to hang out at.  Yes a huge tourist trap but when you are in that part of downtown, isn't everything a huge tourist trap?  \n\nOur waitress had only been there two weeks but she was nice, and quick and whatever she didn't know she got the answer for us.  \n\nWe had the spicy fries, curry fries and garlic fries.  The best of the three was the spicy fries as it had been mixed into the spicy stuff whereas the curry fries had the sauce poured on it, so parts of it didn't get any sauce.  And the garlic fries, well they were good but the garlic kept on falling off.  Oh well.  Then we also had the calamari which was good, the fish and chips which were decent and the clam chowder which had actual bits of clam and was very clam flavored (as opposed to the generic clam chowder you get which is all creamy and no clam parts.).  All okay.  \n\nFor my boyfriend the highlight was the fact that he drank 5 beers in an hour.  For me it was the soda bread pudding with caramel.  AMAZING and delicious!  SOOOOOO good, the best.  In fact the best bread pudding I have ever had ever ever!!  I ordered it with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and that, when topped off with the creamy sauce stuff they give you on the side to pour on, well it was sensational.  \n\nA little pricey for bar food, but if I was the owner of the place and it was in the location that it was in, with a ton of tourists, and bored husbands and boyfriends, I would also try to get away with charging a little bit more.  \n\nNice decor, huge beer barrels in the back.

Our first server, I wasn't feeling too much, he had a forced smile on his face...maybe it was almost the end of his shift and couldn't wait to get off. Hence, our second server, I guess. He was much more sincere and accommodating.\n\nI'm not much of a beer drinker anymore because it makes me too full, so I only get to drink 1 or 2 at the most, so I stick with mixed drinks. I had Cape Cods the whole time we were there, could use MORE vodka.

Random paintings of people that are a little creepy but add to the whole experience of this place. \nGeting a beverage has never been to difficult for me, and the staff has always been friendly. The food is not gourmet but still delicious. Nothing goes better with beer than fried foods in my opinion.\nThis bar has a downstairs bar that has a stage for performances. I have been to the dueling piano night and it was a blast. I was lucky enough to get there early and get a table. There are not that many of them and if you have a large group it could be difficult to get some tables. But there is ample space to stand either at the bar or around it.

Prices are a little high for what you get, atmosphere is loud but the building is beautiful.  Ordered a few guiness, lamb sliders were good, but for $12 two was a little cheap.  While waiting for our food, we realized that the table that sat down after us was already half way through their meal, I looked at the waitress who now realized something wasn't right, she came over and told us that she forgot to put in our main courses.  No problem, we are all human, mistakes are made, so she bought us our drinks for the night.  I would definately go again.", "author": "Michael I."}

The live music is pretty cool, and the piano players get people involved. I didn't particularly like the fact that if they don't like your song they will read the title and move on (if you don't play my music gimme my money back). And although the night was fun the waitress that was working that night (redhead) was so rude she brought the review down to three stars. \n\nHere is why: \nAs mentioned before she was pretty rude, not so friendly and truth be told dressed in poor taste. \nWhen she would bring drinks to the table she would not necessarily take the finished glasses away and at more than one point we had a ton of empty glasses. But this is what really got me: two of the guys in our group ordered a couple of beers it took her about 20 minutes to bring them (understandable it's a busy night). She put one glass on the table, and slammed the other one down spilling all over my friend. No apologies no offer of napkins she moved on. The guys laughed it off. Two minutes later she comes back grabs the drink out of one of the guy's hand takes the other off the table and takes them over to another table... leaving both the guys with a WTF look on their faces. Once again no apologies, no questions. 10 minutes later she brings them their drinks, not even mentioning what happened. \n\nAll in all we had a good time, and I can definitely see us all coming back but I will stick with getting my drinks at the bar thank you very much.", "author": "Yulia K."}

When we were seated, the host asked us \"did you see the gentleman I was speaking to at the door when you walked in?\"  We let him know we did and he pointed to a huge portrait hanging on the wall and said \"that's HIM!  That is Mr. Foley.  He is visiting from Ireland this week.\"  Thought that was a pretty good start to our visit!  I opted for the fish and chips....without the nasty mushy peas!  I got 3 nice pieces of flaky white fish (guessing cod) and a nice serving of fries....er...chips.  Covered them in malt vinegar, washed it all down with a nice cider and I was quite content.  One of my three friends chose the steak and mushroom pie.  Smelled and looked delicious and he said it was awesome.  Another picked the steak sandwich....a bit pink for me but he thoroughly enjoyed it.  And I think the other choice was a veggie sandwich of some sort.  Didn't pay much attention as I like my meat!  ;o)   Our server was awesome.  Only complaint was the price of the irish car bombs.  Almost $50 for 4 of them OUCH!

Clam chowder soup was too salty, irish soda bread was ok, fish and chips were ok, the garlic fries were fries with some garlic on top...not really garlic fries. Someone ordered a caesar salad and said it was doused in dressing.\n\nThe service was absolutely terrible. First, we were a group of 9, but the waitress (short, blonde) comes and only take down drink orders for 3 people. Hello....I wanted a drink! Ok fine, I ordered it with my food. She comes back with the food and drinks, \"Can you take this?\" in a really mean tone. Other friends also note her lack of service and attitude.\n\nWhen the bill comes... we split it up, I needed change. I only bought $15 of food and drink... I put down a twenty. I needed change ffs. She took 20 minutes to pick up the tab. Comes back to clear the table. She is considerably more bitchy. We ask for the change. She is like, 'Why do you need change?\" Obviously by then, we realized that she thought we had already included the tip, so I explained to her, we need the change. We were going to tip her afterwards, you know...leave it on the table. Her answer is to slam the tab back down on the table and say, \"Wow\". Okay, that right there, is the reason why the rest of the fucking table didn't leave you a tip. She comes back and asks, Was there something wrong with the service? But still her tone of voice is bitchy, if you have to ask that, don't you think there was something wrong with your service? I felt conflicted, so I tipped 15% of what my tab was, which is like $2.50. I don't believe in leaving nothing as a tip but honestly I was tempted to. Everyone else was pissed off and offended and just basically left her with nothing. zip. She really treated us badly. I will never go there again. \n\n\nThe piano bar downstairs is pretty good tho, I may one day return for that ONLY.

Tons of straight folks see Pride as their party too, even and especially straight men. I think that's fabulous, politically speaking. Oh who am I kidding, I just think it's fantastic because I want to fuck all of them. I mean, we're all about conversion, RIGHT?!?! We're like a nefarious cult: one minute you're laughing at the hetero-safe humor of Will & Grace, the next minute BAM! you're a fuck toy on a lazy susan and all your inputs are filled with jizzing cock! You laugh, but THAT'S HOW THEY GOT TO ME.\n\nSo you shouldn't be surprised when I tell you that I spent part of Pride Sunday watching the final match between Spain and Germany in the Euro Football Championship at Johnny Foley's with a bunch of hetero Asians presently learning English as a second language. And yes, by \"football\" I mean \"soccer\" you overzealous USA Patriot Act jingoist shitheads -- PLEASE DON'T DEPORT ME! I know, I know. My hetero proclivities die hard, and the fact that I'm Liberace's hair stylist doesn't hide all those women I've stuffed and babies I've fathered, but you've got to give me some credit: football isn't THAT straight. It's actually pretty metro and ambiguous. In fact, according to the Scale of Sport Sexuality ranging from straightest to gayest, football/soccer falls in the middle:\n\n                             STRAIGHT\n                                   l\n           Muff Diving = l\n                                   l = Hockey\n             Genocide = l\n                                   l\nNASCAR Racing = l\n                                   l\n                                   l = Competitive Impregnation\n                                   l\n           Basketball = l\n           Beer Pong = l\n                                   l = Sucking Dick For Drug Money\n                                   l = Baseball \n  Football/Soccer = l\n             Volleyball = l\n                                   l = America's Top Model\n     Swordfighting = l\n                                   l\n  Working at MAC = l\n                                   l = Snowballing\n                                   l = Britney Spears Walkoffathon\n                                   l = Anal Olympics\n             Wrestling = l\n                                   l = Platform Diving\n                                   l\n                                GAY\n\nAnyway, Johnny Foley's is much larger than it appears from the outside. Airy. Mysterious and welcoming. It posesses a bit of what the French call \"je ne sais quoi,\" which in English means PASS THE FUCKING GUINNESS, YOU TOSSER. The decor reminded me of my Grandmother's house, you know, the crazy Irish one who stashes Smithwick's behind the volumes of Joyce and Flann O'Brien. Lots of dark wood paneling and partitions break up the cavernous space, creating \"rooms\" and secret nooks perfect for hiding from the family priest when he tries to molest me. I also liked the numerous paintings of Irish luminaries on the wall, especially the literati 'cause you know Irish lit makes me hard. Like the huge painting of Samuel Beckett fronting the restroom entrance -- I don't know about you Estragon, but seeing Sam's leathery mug is an excellent laxative. And we were seated by the fireplace in the back, next to a painting of Oscar Wilde. One of my Japo friends pointed to the painting and said his teacher looked like Wilde. \n\n\"Your teacher looks like Oscar Wilde?!?\"\n\"Yes. Who is Oscar Wired?\"\n\"Some cocksucker. Good writer, though.\"\n\nThe prices are a wee bit higher here than comparable pubs, but that comes with the Union Square tourist trap territory. I can't comment on the food since I didn't have any, but I will say the wait staff was friendly and professional. They checked in with regularity, and made sure our glasses were consistently filled with the poison of our choice. And while it was crowded, I never felt like I'd be trampled to death in the event of a fire. In fact, I have to say the crowd (split 60/40 between fans of Spain and fans of Germany) here was pretty mellow. I mean, I was cheering for Spain (VIVA ESPANA!) but to be honest part of me wanted them to LOSE BADLY if only because those Spaniards are so fucking EMO. They would have bawled and tossed back 3,518 sangrias and I would have been able to comfort the super hot Spanish dude wearing the RUN DMC t-shirt with pity gay sexo. Whereas the Germans -- FUCK, talk about expressionless and stoic! Did they just lose the football match or invade France? Hard to tell. Wait, what the hell am I talking about again?!?\n\nOh, right. Thanks to Johnny Foley's, I left with my hetero cred intact, free to don my wrestling singlet and rim my way through Pride. I'll be happy to return.", "author": "d s."}

YUM! It was just how I liked it! Now if only I could remember what it was called! errrrr! \nOnce we sat our 12 year old waitress came by to take appetizer orders and any drink refills. We got calamari for the table. Probably one of the best calamari's I've had! I'm not an expert on it because usually it is difficult to find a friend to share it with. But, this one was lightly breaded with very tender (not chewy) meat inside. YUM! I could have eaten the whole plate myself! but I kindly shared :P\nI decided after a big plate of fried calamari it would be in my best interest to stick with a salad. Amazing salmon salad. The dressing was sweet and tangy and they actually didn't drench the thing! The fish seemed juicy and fresh (not dry). over all very tasty. The rest of the table got chicken and steak which everyone seemed to enjoy. The best was the spicy fries my BF got....I stole only a couple! \nMy mission to get Irish food didn't quite turn out the way I expected, but next time I'm so getting the cottage pie!", "author": "Casi C."}

I don't know if all of their waitstaff is as good as Deirdre, but we had such an amazing experience with her! I'm social director for our company and every week I direct our company to new venues in the city for our happy hour, so we've seen a lot of places in the city! I arrived about an hour before everyone else and when I mentioned that I was going to eventually go out for a smoke, as soon as she saw me put my jacket on from across the room, she was right there to put a napkin over my pint to claim the table. As new people arrive, generally, you just send new arrivals to the bar to get served and 10 minutes later they return with a beer. We just told them, \"No, we have great service, she'll be around soon.\" and she was at our table within a minute or two to get the new orders and to refill existing ones! She knew what everyone was drinking so just saying \"one more\" actually meant something to her, you didn't have to remind her of anything. No one had an empty glass for more than a minute and rather than spending the night trying to get the attention of the bartender to get another drink, we were all able to just hang out and have our needs handled! Of all the places I've been in SF, Deirdre was the best server we've ever had! We left a generous tip -- when you find good service, you have to reward it! She made everything so easy for us. Quick drinks and refills, quick service of new arrivals, quick removal of appetizer empty plates, quick bills, everything! I can't speak for the service of all of the waitstaff, but Deirdre definitely left a very positive impression on us! I made a special effort after our bill was paid to make sure I had the spelling of her name right because I knew I had to write a review and mention her. If you go here, make sure to get in Deirdre's section! She's amazing!", "author": "Paul E."}

This bar is unlike most of the bars I have visited. Upstairs there is a Irish dinner that serves delicious and authentic Irish food, while downstairs boasts a dueling pianos irish pub. Two piano players sit in front of two pianos, performing song requests from the audience. The bigger the tip, the more likely your song is to be played. The musicians are fabulous. They know just about every song in the book and belt them out as the whole bar sings along. Another plus of this bar is the price. I was served two tequila shots and two Coronas for under $25. Cheap drinks and excellent service make Johnny Foley's a great pick for any evening. My friends and I enjoyed sitting together, having a few drinks and singing along. Whether going out for a night on the town or searching for a regular hang out, Johnny Foley's is a perfect place to unwind and have some fun.", "author": "Jaimie A."}

However, when one is hungover to the extent that I was you could have deep fried a paperclip and I would have declared it fine cuisine.\nNow me being hungover is nothing new and certainly not different from any other night of the week.  However, there is a sliding scale of hungover magnitude and I was sitting pretty with a score of 7.  This requires treatment with alcohol, grease and sunshine.  Bloody Mary's were great but fucking EXPENSIVE! Last I checked we didn't have an embargo on tomato juice.  My fish and chips were good but the vinegar they had at the table wasn't acidic enough and, although it was tasty, I was almost resentful of the presence of a malt vinegar mayonnaise dipping sauce.  I like my fish and chips dirty style with lots of grease, wrapped in paper and with a lot of salt and vinegar.  Foley's fish and chips are too refined for my tastes, although still tasty.\nAll in all I'd just say \"Meh\".  I'm not down for touristy bars and locales nor did I find anything particularly inspiring enough to get me to come here regularly and to pony up that much cash.", "author": "Jill D."}

Maybe I didn't notice it the first time since my Dad was picking up the tab, but my beer was $6.50!! I dunno about the rest of you, but to me, that's expensive for your average, ordinary beer. I checked out the drink menu for a sec and saw that the rest were around that price too. Jeez. Overall decent atmosphere and there's live music too!

It can get pretty noisy, but not overly so and the music selection, whether traditional irish music or otherwise, doesn't ruin the atmosphere.  \n\nSo I went there with my boyfriend to celebrate our three year anniversary, and instead of seating us in the very crowded and noisier main room, we were seated in what I believe is a banquet room which had it's own mini bar, portraits, everything the same as the larger room.  The hostess had an attitude, but she did seat us in the little off-shoot room, so whatever, not going to ruin our night.  Our waitress was really great, although sometimes we were sitting around waiting for a while, but the place was completely packed and she was running around doing her job, so it wasn't a huge problem for us.  The food was...simply incredible.  I had the chef's special Lamb on top of mashed potatoes with asparagus and I'm used to lamb being somewhat on the dry side, but this was so tender and moist I couldn't believe that it was lamb.  We were so stuffed that we couldn't partake in any of their coffee or delicious dessert selection, but I'm definitely going to go back to have some of that on another day.  \n\nThe only downpoint is that it does get a little pricey, but remember, I'm in college so eating like that is a special occassion and not a weekly deal.  Excellent all around, the beers they have on tap are fantastic (my favorite is Smithwick's), and my boyfriend says their Bloody Marys are near the best he's had.", "author": "Veronica S."}

I wanted to eat but they were not serving anymore it was about 10:30........We truly were not sure if we were staying ... but ...............I told him that i come there a lot  and ..just days before i spend $150 and brought in a group of friends to hear musicians  we knew playing. ( very  very rude waitress that night  as well..)     in defense to our questioning this bartenders command   ..... said he just told two other girls to leave as well, because they weren't drinking ... what kind of treatment is that??? give me a minute to build of a thirst dude !!!!! If it is so important to get two dollars charge a cover at the door! instead of letting us leave with a bad tast in our mouths... I don't feel welcome  and it   Seems they are ALL about the buck! one buck to be exact ...\nNOT  GOIN BACK FOR ABUSE!! I guess they don't want locals to patronize  there restaurant by the way we are continually treating  us  .Pretty sure this attitude is coming from the top of the chain..(owner) who was there. Penny wise but pound foolish.. over a coke.!!!!.", "author": "susan m."}

How come nobody has told me about the secret downstairs of JF's before? I am mad at you all for keeping this from me until now!\nI have admittedly been to the upstairs of JF's a few years back and I don't remember if being all that special...kind of, ehh. Obviously \"ehh\" since I haven't been back in 3 years. I heard through the grapevine that JF's had dueling pianos downstairs for FREE, EVERY NIGHT, so I had to check it out. \nWe had such a great time. The entertainment was wonderful and we were singing along and laughing non-stop. To get a song played you have to tip the piano players as you write your song request down..and people fork over a pretty penny to get their song played, so be prepared to spend some $ or just chill and listen to the songs that the bigger spenders request...you'll know and like most of them, probably, unless you're weird. \nThe drinks are average sf prices, and the food was like upscale bar food. They just served appetizers by the time we got there around 9ish on a Sunday night. Our waitress was attentive. No complaints on the food or service. \nI can't wait to go back!", "author": "Julie F."}

And all the tourists are so happy to be on vacation that their joy turns into an air-born contagion and suddenly you're happy too! \n    The best nights to go are Tuesday and Thursday where this lovely newly-made woman named Nikki plays her guitar and takes requests from an almost impossibly long play-list that she has completely memorized! It's awe inspiring. And she's so friendly and sweet and loves that moment in the night after all the dining families are gone and it's only drunkies left when she reveals to the bar that, yes, in case they were wondering, she WAS a man.\n    I strongly recommend this bar for any girl who has had a hard day and just wants to go, sit down, and have an endless string of men buy her drinks.

Clean the stool, eject the bartender, and I be back.\nCheers.", "author": "TJ R."}

I recommend the sheperd's pie and the salmon with the very tasty onion and cherry tomatoes sauce. You always get some delicious brown bread with the meal. The service is also decent, we never wait for too long.", "author": "Stephanie B."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-09-08", "description": "Note: This is a review of the downstairs piano bar only.  I always enjoy myself at their upstairs establishment.\n\nI had been to the piano bar a few months back with my wife and some friends and we had a blast.  The piano players were young, fun, and really got the crowd involved.  My wife decided she wanted to go back for her 30th birthday party.  We arrived on Saturday night with a group of around 20 people and quickly claimed a section of tables.  The staff couldn't have been more accommodating - Cassie (waitress) and Jerry (bartender) were great.\n\nThe experience went downhill once the performance begun.  The piano players seemed like nice guys but their piano skills, vocal skills and song knowledge was sub par at best.  Their use of a drum machine playing the same beat at the same tempo really disrupted any song.  They didn't even know the words to Sweet Caroline.  The last straw was when they kicked off the Chicken Dance.  Appalling.  We gutted it out for 45 minutes but had to pull the cord at that point and relocate the party to another location.\n\nThe staff encouraged us to give our feedback to the GM upstairs as business had been slipping since they changed piano players.  I'm down to go back if they bring back the previous pianists; otherwise, my patronage of Foley's will be limited to the upstairs bar/restaurant.", "author": "Mike R."}

Everything we ordered (party of 6 -lots of food) was great. Stars were the crab cake app and for main courses the corned beef,  chicken curry and cottage pie. Will definitely go back. for the food. Waitstaff was attentive and lively. We really enjoyed ourselves.", "author": "Tara M."}

I'm something of a bloody mary fanatic, but generally don't like them from restaurants or bars... the perfect bloody requires special attention to detail, a flare for the arts, and a fabulous garnish... well... the boys at foley's know their craft, their bloody marys are thick (but not too thick), spicy (but not too spicy) and check out the mother effing garnish... a huge stock of celery, a wedge of lime, an olive, pearl onion and PICKLED ASPARAGUS!!!!   I'll drink my breakfast mr foley, thanks for the best bloody mary's in the city... no... the world... seriously.", "author": "Caleb D."}

Okay did you feel that?  Great now wake up and smell the alcohol.  \n\nJohnny Foley's, along with Metro Bar on Market in the Castro are my two watering holes in the city.  This review is why I choose Foley's.  If you would like to know about Metro Bar, please read my seperate review on that.  \n\nJohnny Foley's feel comfortable from the moment you walk in the door and into the nice low lighting.  The lighting reminds of of Cheesecake Factory or if you have ever been to Los Angeles, The Grand Lux Cafe.  For those of you who hate low lighting, for one a pub probably is not for you, and two there is a Burger King down the street with all of the bright fluorescent lighting you can handle.  The staff are really super friendly, especially after you become a regular and they get to know you.  The size of this pub is pretty impressive.  You keep walking through and you begin to wonder if there is ever an end.  Dinner is served until 10pm and if you are only getting drinks you will need to try and find a seat at the bar (good luck with that.)  After 10pm all seating opens up just in time for the live entertainment.  My favorite performer at Foley's is Nicki McCrory.  She performs every Tuesday and Thursday evenings.  She is an AMAZING performer who has won my respect.  The food is a little pricy however I think it is will worth the price for the quality.  If you think the prices are unreasonable, again, there is a Burger King down the street.  This is San Francisco, NOT Bakersfield.  I definitely think the drinks are made quite well here.  I usually get their apple martinis which are absolutely sinful, howful Sunday I had a dirty martini with two olives and I was thouroughly satisfied.\n\nSo if you are looking for a great place to hang out, check out Foley's at O'Farrell and Cyril Magnin.", "author": "Jeremy S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-03-01", "description": "Our San Francisco office is close to union square and when im in town working with quite a few Irish guys, they always want to make a beeline for their pint of Guinness after work (I guess that should say something as they are very particular as to how it's ordered, poured, served, chilled, priced, and any other characteristic you can think of).  Now I myself am not a Guinness drinker so I steer towards Harp or the old class of Stoli Tonic.  The atmosphere in here is Jolly, but when there are singers or bands, its just way too loud, if you are not sitting \"intimatley close\" to someone you can barely hear conversation and I dont plan on sitting that close to my coworkers!!  They recently changed their menu's they have scaled up from bar food to upscale bar food :) but I dont think much has changed besides the prices and the dishes they are served in.  The food is your average pub fair.  Anyways, I will probably end up going back there over and over again until I can ween the irish guys off Guiness!", "author": "W M."}
