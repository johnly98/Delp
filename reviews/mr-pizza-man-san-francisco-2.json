I forgot to leave a tip when I ordered online. Seriously my bad. What was horrible was the delivery driver literally stood in my doorway waiting for his tip and even asked \"are you going to tip me?\" My husband had no cash and had to borrow from my sons piggy bank. \n\nI get that tipping is huge, but what if this particular time I couldn't afford to tip?? Or I had forgot to add it like I did I don't like the feeling I'm left with knowing that this delivery driver was so demanding of a tip that he stood in my doorway waiting.

The interior of the restaurant definitely leaves something to be desired but I was picking up so that didn't really make that much difference. I had the small cheese pizza and it was adequate, like it wasn't awful but it didn't have that wow factor that east coast pizza has. I ordered through Yelp and that was easy and when I went to pick it up everything was all boxed up and ready to go. The cashier lady was very friendly and it was a good pickup experience.  I think if this place did single slices it would be more popular. I work at SF General and it would be a super close place to get lunch but even the small pizza is giant. \n\nOverall, it was a reasonably good experience but I don't think I would get this pizza again, it was pretty bland.

Strolled down to the closest pizza spot my google map pointed me to and expect to just grub a slice then call it a night, head to the bar. But the menu had a vast array from the norm pizza spot to Brazilian specials. \n\nSo yea, the tramp I was with speaks Spanish fluently but the guys running this place weren't speaking Italian or Spanish they were speaking Portuguese. Took a couple minutes to figure this out after I ordered a large plate of spaghetti instead of slices of pizza. (But I rather enjoyed the mystery of it all and did not hold it against them for not being Italian.. I make great pasta and I surely am not Italian.) \n\nWatched some soccer on the flat screen and a few cozy tables, the place was rather cute. Our order of  spaghetti with meat sauce came up and it tasted so good. I really felt like I was in Italy eatting grandma's original recipe (even though I have never met grandma or her wonderful country). With fresh warm buttery bread and it was perfect for two.

Because it's open 24 hours a day.  That's the only reason, and even when I do so it's with a certain sigh of regret -- it literally feels as if I'm doing so under duress.\n\nThis pizza is so bad, it requires a thesaurus to safely finish writing this little hit piece I'm planning.  But, it's also so damn horrible, that it's not even worth putting that much effort into explaining to my fellow Yelpers as to how god awful this pizza is.  It's -- wow -- nearly unfathomable to me that this round disc of dough with sauce and cheese and toppings could be fucked up so singularly and thoroughly, and done with so much malice towards what a pizza should look and taste like.  My God -- when Mr. Pizza Man comes to my door, the happiness is sucked out of the house.  It's like that scene in The City of Lost Children when the evil Krank opens a door as his living brain compatriot is celebrating a birthday with a cake.  All the candles extinguish on cue.\n\nI'm sure you're probably asking yourself, \"Why does he call them at all, if he feels this way about their pizza?  Does he really need to put himself through all this unnecessary stress?\"\n\nUnfortunately, I do.  Once I have it in my head that only a pizza will do, then only a pizza will do.  Round Table delivers until 11.  Cable Car delivers until 3.  After 3, you're kind of fucked.  Mr. Pizza Man is the pizza of last resort.  And they're open 24 hours.  So that's why.\n\n\"Pizza is like sex,\" they like to say.  \"When it's good, it's really, really good.  When it's bad, it's still kind of good.\"  Whoever \"they\" are, they've never tasted this crap.  My God, it's dreadful.  It's most unpleasant.  It's reprehensible.  It's inferior.  It's objectionable.  It's nearly injurious.  It's distressing.\n\nBut it's still pizza.  Even though it will arrive long after the due time cold and soggy and squishy and sloped off to one side of the box due to being held at an angle without even having been placed in one of those heat-bags, I will still bite my tongue, stick it in the oven and then eat it with a fork due to its unstableness.\n\nGod, I hate this place.", "author": "Thomas B."}

Wrong. \n\nMr. Pizza Man has managed to make the worst pizza I've ever had. And because it's open SO late and is so close to my apartment, I've experienced the displeasure of its poorly-made pies several times. The crust is all chewy and uncooked, the cheese has this weird plasticky texture, and the toppings are just tossed right on top. Its only saving grace (i suppose) is that it delivers really really really late. But like, even the 4am drunchies don't really make me willing to eat it. \n\nToday I saw a small dead mouse outside. I am not implying that Mr. Pizza Man has mice, or that it's dirty.

I'm from Chicago, yeah?  The land of the real american-ized pizza, made right, and more often than not, a well-made pie was a drunken necessity for me and my gang.\n\nI was originally weary of eating pizza from a state that has a franchise of shacks named after it that take flat bread, throw some fucking avocado and nineteen other ingredients on it, and call it pizza.  My friends said, \"No, no, no. Seriously, there's a couple of good joints in this town,\" and I'll admit it, I've have had some decent slices from other places, but those places close at reasonable hours and I'm typically not belligerent and desperately hungry during business hours.  So, I have to go for what grubhub.com tells me is open and that's Mr. Pizza Man.  \n\nMr. Pizza Man is a man who works til 3am and I appreciate that, but last night was the last fucking straw.  This place sucks the casbah and I'm going to tell you (in detail) why:\n\nFirst off, there's the business of placing an order.  Whoever they've got working the phones really needs to take a class on self-esteem because i can never hear a word he's fucking saying.  I'm not trying to be a bitch here, but seriously, come on.  Yeah, I'm probably going to need you to repeat yourself several times and I will do the same because well, you know, I'm drunk and all..  it's just a huge pain in the ass when I have to go \"HELLO? HELLO?\" nine times like an asshole because old boy is so soft-spoken that I only know he answered the phone because of the background noise.\n\nThen there's the problem of the order itself: what they advertise on their specialty pizzas is typically not what you get.  Actually, no matter what you order is typically not what you get. For reals: because this place is one of the few joints that's open late, I've suffered through several of these Bitch Pies and every time I order something, it either shows up missing something important (hello - cheese?! sauce?!) or totally insane (please continue to read).  Like last night, we got the Veggie Deluxe: MOTHER FUCKING BULLSHIT, man.  \n\nWhen our pizza didn't arrive in the thirty minutes they told us it would take to get there, we called and they said it would be there \"any minute\" because there was only one order that needed to be delivered before ours.  We then had to call AGAIN when it still hadn't arrived after an hour.  Yes, we actually FELL ASLEEP waiting for the pizza and let me tell you, we don't ever crash before the pizza arrives because we're typically jazzed out of our minds that it's coming.  When fella arrived, I met him at the front door and was like \"Hey, how's it going? Where've you been cruising tonight?\" (you know, small talk) and he gets ALL FREAKED OUT and defensive and says, \"Oh, sorry about the time! You know.. I had other deliveries and stuff..\"  I was just like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah,\" and didn't tip because he made the mistake of handing me the pizza box to sign on and the bottom of the fucker was soggy (aka, the pizza had been sitting in this guy's back seat for awhile.)\n\nNow, here's where I want to really freak out: I want to know who's genius idea it was to throw RAW garlic on a pizza.  Seriously.  WHAT THE FUCK?!  I mean, yeah it was late at night but do you really think that because I'm pissed at 3.30 in the morning, I'm going to just chow down on any fucking thing you decide to throw on my pizza and not call the boss in the morning?!  Au contraire, asshole.\n\nSadly, old boy on the phone said boss-man isn't going to be in until tomorrow so I have to wait until tomorrow to let Mr. Pizza Man know he can go fuck himself and/or I want a refund/free pizza made with a lot of really expensive shit on it - I'm talking lobster, caviar, gold leaf and sauce made a with Dom Perignon reduction.  Oh yeah, I think I deserve a pair of gold teeth and pimp cup studded in diamonds, rubies and sapphires too because that pizza was beyond crap.\n\nI will not be eating Mr. Pizza Man ever again.
