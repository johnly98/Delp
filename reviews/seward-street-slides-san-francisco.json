The mini park (if you can call it a park haha it only had the slides and nothing else really, just a nice little garden) was very peaceful and there were only three other people when my boyfriend and I got there. It's smack in the middle of a residential area, which was quite odd but that adds to these slides being so unique. It's made of cement and has two slides side by side, so my boyfriend and I grabbed some cardboard laying around and slide-raced down to the bottom! There was plenty of cardboard pieces lying around, so thanks to those who came before us and left them here. Make sure to use these so your pants don't get damaged.\n\nWe stopped sliding around 5pm since that's when the slides are supposed to close according to the park rules. We hung around and rested on the bench at the bottom of the slides and sure enough, someone came by around 5:25pm to lock the slides (there were metal stoppers placed on the middle of the slides so you'll be stopped when you try to slide down). \n\nFun little spot and I'll be back here if I'm around again!", "author": "Cherin K."}

They are hidden in a residential area and not a place you can easily get to using BART (you also need to take city buses + additional 10 ~ 15 minutes walk), so our group just used a ridesharing app to get here.\n\nThere was a sign that clearly stated \"no adults unless accompanied by a child\", honestly there was no one here to enforce the rule. These slides are open from 10 AM to 5 PM and they do have locks on them. When our group got here, we noticed leftover cardboard boxes on the bottom of the slides. I highly recommend to utilize these cardboard boxes because (1) your clothes (e.g. jacket and jeans) get dirty if you don't use them and (2) cardboard boxes make the ride even faster. The ride itself wasn't exactly a smooth slide (in fact I got stuck on that one sharp turn several times), but it was one of the more exhilarating slide experience given the right speed and momentum. In a perfect run, you can attain pretty insane speed and sometimes I wonder whether the park staff should put a speed limit sign on these slides!\n\nYou don't need to stay here for too long (about 10~15 minutes) to fully experience these super fun slides and they will make you feel like a kid again!", "author": "Luke L."}

Exiting the car, we can't help but notice the Seward Street Slides, sitting tall upon a hill, and staring down ominously upon us. You can imagine how these slides were in their heyday, shiny, slick, and super fast, attracting neighborhood kids in droves, who played until the sun set or mom called them home. Now, more than 40 years later, they're a big more weathered, showing a few cracks, and dare I say, taking on a personality all their own. \n\nThe slides are really tall, and I think I would've been a bit nervous to go the entire distance. They start at the top of a hill an descend with some twists and big hump in the middle which almost separates two sections. It really resembles a rollercoaster track, and I can easily imagine catching some air on that hump if you weren't careful. \n\nOverall though, I don't think they're dangerous, but they are surprisingly fast, with or without a piece of cardboard beneath you, and a helluva good time. There's no sign posted to say adults can't slide, so come here ready to unleash your inner child. \n\nJust make sure and do that before 5PM, because they close, or rather they close off the slides in sections so you can't ride the whole thing!

When I first read about it online, since it was listed as a \"hidden gem\"I thought it would be difficult to find.

The nice part is that it was on my way to Twin Peaks, so it was not a wasted trip at all!\n\nThe slides were shorter than I thought, but very well constructed.  They must be well-used because there was no build up of debris on them.  I didn't have any cardboard with me (and ummm didn't have any kids with me either!) but I made sure to wear pants on this day.  I love that there were two slides.  I was alone and so I couldn't race anyone but I'm sure that must be a fun feature!  \n\nI did remember someone said they \"weren't for the faint of heart\" so I wasn't expecting a kiddy experience, but I also wasn't expecting such a steep and fast descent!  It probably only took about 10 seconds to go down them, but soooooo fun!  I took a video while descending it and I know that I squealed as I went down because you almost feel like you're going to fly right off of it, you go so fast!  However, they made the slide very safe (high sides) and so there really is no way you can fall out or off!  My only mistake was that I kept my elbows too low on one of my trips and I got concrete burn on them!  Hold your arms high!  And yes, I did go down more than once!\n\nOn my last trip down, I was caught by a couple coming into the park and I laughed at myself because they saw me giggling hysterically as I finished the ride.  They looked at me a little funny and I was hoping they weren't going to bag me for not having a child with me.  It turned out that they were visiting from North Caroline and had read about the slides as well.  They said they had seen me walking up (and I mean UP... those hills are steep in San Francisco!) to the park ahead of them.  I told them how much fun it was and said how I was traveling solo and was taking photos of me with everyone I was meeting.  They were a friendly couple and we took a selfie!

Let's just say that when you sit at the top, they're a little daunting.  This is no joke.  And, from what I gather, if you are light and get a good amount of speed going, you can get some serious air on the mid-section.  You do want to sit on cardboard, which was plentiful on the day I went.  If you soup it up and use glossy cardboard, and then lay down a little sand, you can really get going.

When you get there, the slides don't look like much, but when you grab a piece of cardboard (and I suggest you do) and slide down, it's actually really fun and you remember why you went to the park as a kid all the time.

If you're going super fast, jump off at the end otherwise you will end up with an awkward landing. Another protip: keep your elbows and arms close to your side.

They would prefer for you to express your gravity-fueled enthusiasm via golf claps and maybe some heavy breathing. Their arguments are not sound, and they do not care that they chose to live next to a landmark public slide. They will not acknowledge their decision to keep their windows open, and they find it irrelevant that it's the middle of the day and the park is open for business. \n\nHere is a verbatim conversation: \n\nW of SS: \"Would you go into a hospital and scream like that?\" \nMy husband: (confused) \"Um...this is a playground.\" \nW of SS: (full of righteous indignation) \"You asshole!\" \n\nNeedless to say, I highly recommend coming to this park and shrieking delightedly to your heart's content.", "author": "Kristin M."}

Coming here totally made my day and started an epic chain of events that contributed to a really good day.\n\nAfter drinking cup after cup of sauce from Boss of the Sauce, I convinced my friends to sit on the steps of a nearby church while I swore profusely and thought of things to do. I remembered that these little concrete slides existed and went on a quest to search for them. \n\nUnfortunately, after texting some of my friends who live in the city, I was told that they had been torn down for about 2 years. Harrumph. Dejected, I walked towards my car, ready to drown my sorrows with the help of some retail therapy and my flavor of the month, Visa. \n\nFortunately, on the way to the car, we ran into the wonderful Connie and Jessica, who were walking out from the Boss of the Sauce, and they informed us that the Seward Slides were still around.\n\nUnfortunately, I had no idea how to get to them.\n\nFortunately, we had Michael L. to help me navigate to this place.\n\nFortunately, we found it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nFortunately, there were pieces of cardboard left around for us to use.\n\nFortunately, everyone else was chicken shit, and I went first and it was a blast! \n\nUnfortunately, I look like I'm taking a dump while I go down the slides, as evidenced here: http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/azOOSWRLi3qWu-meVkzqMw/l\n\nFortunately, it was really fun and it convinced everyone else to go down, and we all took several turns and raced each other! Yay!\n\nI cackled hysterically all the way down, and part of the way up. Watch out...that climb back up is steep! Hold onto the chain if you're gross motor challenged like me. \n\nThe park has some specific rules. They close at sunset, and no adults may be present without being accompanied by a child. Thank goodness we had baby Ruth to legitimize our group. Hehe. \n\nHonestly though, I can see why SF natives would tell visitors that this place is torn down, and why they want these slides torn down. They are way too fun! They are also located so close to the houses nearby that you can see into people's rooms and kitchens. It must get really old to deal with drunk people who stop by at night and scream their heads off on the way down, as fun as it may be the first few times you visit. \n\nSo if you decide to go.

In the off chance you fall off your cardboard lets not scrape all your legs on the sandy slide. \n\n[2] Use as small of a cardboard piece as possible. You want one that just goes around the sides of your butt and has enough lip so you can grab on. If you use one too big then it doesn't curve as well to the slides and you go pretty darn slow.\n\n[3] If you like more speed grab a bunch of sand at the bottom and take it up with you. Throw all the sand on the slide and make sure there is some right under where you are going to set your cardboard seat down when you are ready to go. \n\n[4] At these slides especially, if you follow my 3rd advice close your eyes near the bottom or the sand will be kicked up in your face.

It's worth a couple slides down. Our whole family went and had a great time. We brought our own cardboard and left some behind for others who didn't bring their own. Parking is a little tight if you have a big car, but it's San Francisco so that's part of the charm. The park has no restroom, so if you have little ones make sure they go before you go to this park.

There are always kids playing on the slide so be careful not to run any of them over. Remember, kids are kids and more often than not they don't know how to take turns.

I love San Francisco.\n\nBut, unfortunately, this little haven of fun is surrounded by some not so happy people.\n\nI came here today around two or so, with a group of 15 middle schoolers, and four other adults, as part of a summer camp field trip. Our plan was to hang at the slides for 20-30 minutes, then head over to another spot for the rest of the day.\n\nYes, our kids were loud. They are loud kids, and they were whooping and shrieking and having a freakin' awesome time on those slides.\n\nOne woman came, and politely asked us to be a little bit quieter. We apologized, asked the kids to lower their voices (which they did), and continued sliding.\n\nThen, the next door neighbor came out, and started yelling at us AND taking pictures of our kids. \"There are too many kids, they're so noisy, I can hear it, you're so disrespectful, you shouldn't be here, blah blah blah.\"\n\nWe apologized, and told her we were leaving.\n\n\"NO, I am trying to make a point. I live here, you need to respect the space, this is a peaceful neighborhood...\"\n\nThe kids even started apologizing, loudly, I admit, but this seemed to piss her off more. She really needed to make a point, but I'm really not sure what point she wanted to make.\n\nNow, the kids I work with are urban youth from neighborhoods like Bayview and the Tenderloin. They are all black and Hispanic, and they go to shitty schools, and many have fucked up home lives. This trip to the slides, like a lot of what we do at my program, was an attempt to get them to experience some of the better parts of childhood, because most of them are growing up too fast. \n\nWhile it seems like a lot of people have complained about the unhappy neighbors, some of the kids mentioned that they thought the woman was racist. Maybe. Maybe not. But an old white woman in a million dollar Noe Valley/Castro house yelling at children of color for behaving, like, well, children? Makes you think.\n\nMy boss, when she found out about the trip, asked if I had told the woman off. I hadn't, because that's the kind of thing that gets ya fired. My boss told me I should have. I really wish I had.\n\nIf you don't like the noise level of your neighborhood, move. I'm sure you can afford it.", "author": "Erin M."}

They expect to have quiet 24/7 when they essentially live next to a playground. It's one thing to be mad at people who trespass at night, but harassing preschoolers and their parents at 2 PM is simply delusional.\n\nMy son's preschool group visits the slides for 45 minutes every Friday at the end of the school day. The kids play on the slides while the parents and teachers catch up a bit. The noise level is absolutely normal for a group of preschoolers. The school helps to maintain both the garden above the slides and Acme Alley, which is adjacent to this lovely little park.\n\nLast Friday the neighbors asked us to be quiet several times (they were \"trying to nap\") and then, when the noise level was still not to their liking, proceeded to insult our group repeatedly and basically intimidate us to the point of leaving. They made negative comments about our appearance, called one dad bad names in front of his kids, attempted to make one mom feel bad about breastfeeding an infant in public, and refused to communicate with those of us that attempted to address their concerns in a civil manner.\n\nSeveral people from our group called the Mission Police Station for advice. They already knew about this situation and were clearly on our side. They advised us to call the police dispatch the next time we are harassed: (415) 553-0123. They also said we can file a restraining order.\n\nI encourage anyone who is confronted by these crazy women to call the police dispatch.

I mentioned that to her (she didn't seem to like that)   and then she went on a rant about how popular the slides are and how everyone uses them, and I just agreed that they were great slides.\n\nThere are no signs that say you must be a resident to play there, and it's a public park.  My advice to others coming to check out the slides of awesomeness: \n\nFollow the park rules:  sunrise to sunset\nhave a kid (or 4) with you.  I believe one of the rules  on the sign is that adults must be accompanied by children.  \nhave fun, but have respect.", "author": "Samanta V."}

Ice cream truck music, Saturday morning cartoons, GI Joe, footy pajamas, and slides. There's that moment when you're sitting at the top of a slide where the expectation of what's about to happen is only matched by the exhilaration from actually going down the slide. As an adult, you rarely get the opportunity to be a kid. Luckily, these slides exist. I know they're supposed to be for kids, but c'mon, they're irresistible. And they're not kid-sized slides. There's actually a split second where you do a mental check to make sure you have health insurance. OK, it's not double black-diamond steep, but it's long and steep enough to be a lot of fun. \n\nThey're a bit hard to find, but that's probably for the better, otherwise you'd have office workers coming here during their lunch breaks, people taking cuts, dresses being torn, just general bedlam.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2009-11-22", "description": "I want to start this review by stating that it's not the slide's fault.  I'm sure the slide itself deserves 5 stars, but the experience was so horrific for us, we left completely traumatized, thus the 1 star.\n\nImportant facts to note:\nIt was my friend's B-day.  \nWe're all 30 and 40 somethings.\nIt was 5:30pm.\nNot a one of us had been drinking.\n\nWe were standing in a small group at the base of the slides waiting for more friends to arrive (5 waiting for 7 more) and were talking quietly amongst ourselves. We planned to each take a slide and then head off for our dinner reservations--our motivation was to briefly recapture our youth.  The youth we recaptured, however, was the youth of Rumpelstiltskin and the Troll.\n\nDisguised as a fellow slider, a small women came up to our group asking if we were *her group*.  We politely said that we were not, we were just waiting for some friends, and then like someone flipped a switch, she started SCREAMING at the top of her lungs *Get the FUCK out of here!! The park is CLOSED!!!* waving her hands around trying to be intimidating.  \n\nAt first her demeanor was so ludicrous we thought she was joking, and we all laughed nervously.  She continued to yell demeaning things at us, calling us stupid and unattractive (what??), while we tried to explain that it was a B-day party, we only planned on being there a short time, and we had been almost silent up until that point.  The noise her tizzy was making was easily thrice as loud as our whole group.  \n\nAnd did I mention that it was FIVE THIRTY IN THE AFTERNOON ON A SATURDAY????\n\nShe kept saying over and over that she *wasn't special* (which I guess was meant to imply that we thought we were for wanting to slide??) and for the most part wasn't very coherent.\n\nWhen we realized she wasn't kidding, as she threatened to call the cops and literally lunged at us, we came back with a few retorts--*It's 5:30 on a Sat--are the neighbors even home now?*, *This is a public park*, and *You're the one that bought property next to a slide*, to which she then completely came unglued pointing to all the surrounding houses while foaming at the mouth, asking us if we were BLIND or just STUPID and hadn't we noticed the signs.  \n\nWe allowed ourselves to be chased out not because we thought we were wrong (in fact, we were quite respectful and aware of the neighbors and had no intention of being disruptive) but because she was so completely irate and bizarre acting she put a huge downer on our evening and we just wanted to get away.\n\nHad this not been a celebratory occasion and had we not had dinner reservations in short order, we might have waited her out, let her call the cops to see how long they took to get there.  I'm sure busting over to diamond heights to *save* the resident of a multi-million dollar house from a group of respectful middle aged sliders is right up there on their list of emergencies.\n\nAgain, had she asked us nicely or even approached us in ANY reasonable fashion, we would have dutifully complied.  We all live in the city and know what it's like when *that guy* is drunk outside our apt at 3am and we're trying to sleep.  Her demeanor, however, was so reprehensible that I felt no compassion for her or her situation at all--especially since we weren't drinking, loud OR disruptive, and again, it was late afternoon, not 2am.\n\nAdvice to anyone going there in the future--should you meet the troll, DO NOT ENGAGE.  Absolutely ignore her--give her no ammo to respond to, and continue on with your business. Turn your back on her, act as if she's not there--any exchange will just fuel her self righteous indignation.  The chance that the cops will get there before you've had your slide is slim to none, and if you slide quietly and respectfully, there should be no problem.\n\nBecause she is completely irrational and highly theatrical she is a bit scary, but I'm sure she knows that to touch is to be arrested.  \nLet her work herself into a froth, spread bad energy and display what an unhappy person she is, but don't give her any more reason to hate.\n\nIf you're really feeling belligerent and you've been scolded @ the slides before, why not take the letter of the law seriously and go slide at dawn?  If the park really is closed from dusk till dawn, who's to stop the 5:30am sliders?  \n\nDoesn't a benevolent approach to fellow San Franciscans make for better community relations that screaming and belittling?  All this neighbor did last night was make a dozen new enemies.\n\nThe icing on the cake:  As she stomped back to her house, we saw that she didn't even live in a house that bordered the slide--she was 2 houses away!!\nCRAZY!", "author": "D C."}

She yelled at me (she's not exactly the quiet type) for about ten minutes straight, AFTER my son and I apologized for screaming during his first time down the slide, and AFTER I told her that we would be quiet for the remainder of our visit.. She would not quit yelling at me, and she insulted my intelligence and capabilities as a mother, saying that I should be \"aware of my surroundings,\" and \"control my child.\" I chose to not let any of this get to me, and she finally quit yelling at me after she realized we weren't actually making ANY noise at all, but merely going down the slides in total silence (still fun!)\nA friendly couple and their three children showed up, and my son started talking and playing with those kids, and the lady came out again, and this time, started turning purple in the face and screaming. She called the police, and had the father of the three kids arrested (for whatever reason, she lied, because he did nothing wrong). \nHere is some advice: If you go, take a tray (like the ones at Mc Donald's, you can find them at dollar stores) because they help you slide faster than cardboard, try to be quiet, and call the police to have the psychotic lady arrested for harassment the second she tries to intimidate you.

I can only say that I am glad I have experienced the slide before the \"dreamkillers\" came and took my only place of joy away.\n\nI am sorry for all who missed out, but know the urban legend of a slide tucked away in a fairy tale park was not a myth but a true story.

But there was a group of 20-somethings there as well who were a bit shrieky. I wouldn't even have thought anything about their noise level as it seemed reasonable to me, but there was a lady who started shouting loudly out of her home at us.  \n\nI am only writing this review to point out two things: her window was open, and it would be easy to shut out the noise by closing it. It wasn't that loud. \n\nAnd two, it does suck that this place has gained so much notoriety from Yelp. The slides are fun and fast. Your butt will be airborne. But it's just a tiny little parklette and I think most people would get tired of crowds trekking into their local park all the time. My in-laws live across town in Bernal Heights and also have a slide between the streets like this - they're just not concrete nor are they popular on Yelp. There are more of them around the City and they are a joy to residents who need a place to blow off steam in their own neighborhood. It's a shame people have to get contentious about it.

I said back to her, not to yell or cuss at them, they are children. Which caused a lot of her screaming and yelling at me. So I told her that if the kids are too loud, call the police and make a report instead of screaming at people. Did that stop her? Nope. So then she got her friend to come out and try to intimidate us by taking photos, I told her to stop taking photos of the kids. \"I have a right to take photos of children in a park.\" \"Not without parent permission, and the rules here say no adults without children....you are an adult here without children taking photos of little kids. YOU are breaking the law.\"  She then left and said she would call the police. I said, \"Go do that. I would love to see you call the police on a five year old for making noise in a public park in the middle of the day.\" \"Well, I have a picture of you!!\" I said, \"I'm proud of you...now since you are here without children you may go now.\" (I'm supposed to be scared because she got a picture of me sitting on a park bench?) Then she said, \"Its not appropriate for kids to be loud in public!!!\" I said, \"Yes, it is totally appropriate for kids to be noisy on a public playground. That's what a playground is for.\" I then pointed to rule number 2 (no adults without children)...and she left. Then more parents came and got to see the two crazies in action. Screaming at little kids at 2 in the afternoon for laughing. She came back and yelled at some poor lady because she was sitting on a park bench with her dog. \"NO DOGS ALLOWED IN THE PARK!! DIDN'T YOU SEE THE SIGN???!\" The lady politely said, \"no i didn't.\" then the crazy lady while taking pictures of her tried to show her where it says that...turns out she couldn't find it because the sign didn't exist.

The slides are sort of narrow so if you're a wide person you might not fit so well. As an adult I haven't had fun going down a slide since I was probably 12 so it took a lot of self control not to run back and forth going down over and over again while a group of teenagers sat there watching.

The kids there stared at our brand new box in envy. We split the box in two using keys, fingers, fists, and force. And we were off to anti-gravity central! Seriously though, halfway down, you'll feel like you are off the cement like those log rides at amusement parks.

I remember when I first found out about the Seward Street slides I was 7 years old and thought them to be the coolest thing ever.    Many years later and I still love going to them.\n\nThe slides are tucked away on a small strip in a residential area between Seward and Corwin Streets.  You can enter from either side, though I like to walk downhill from Corwin because there is a very nice like garden. If you are familiar with Kite Hill, they are located a mere block away if you follow the trail off Corwin (this is a good starting point if you have difficulty locating the slides). \n\nYou can get some real speed and real airtime on these puppies, so use a bit of caution when you go.   I once saw someone with a child in the lap go down and the poor kid hit his head during the middle jump spot. \n\nNow to maximize your enjoyment of the slides several things are essential \n1) CARDBOARD!  You can usually find this laying around in the sand pit at the bottom, however if you have the chance play it safe and bring your own (I've gone on a whim before and was quite bummed when I only found overused scraps).\n2) WAXPAPER.  If you really want to build speed and have a frictionless ride put some wax paper underneath your cardboard.\n3)....and for the truly daring...throw a handful of sand down the slide (and even a little underneath your cardboard) right before you take the plunge.  I find that this increases speed, kind of like little ball bearings.  Though some people have told me that this is bullsh*t and doesn't help at all, and also that it may erode the slides, because it will sure erode your waxpapper and cardboard quicker.   Try it once and see if it's for you.\n\n\nAlso...\n-Be aware that it is a playground and technically adults without children are not allowed (a large sign clearly states this).  Not that this will ever stop me, but I do take it into account and I'm mindful of when children and their parents want to use it.  Be polite and considerate to other sliders of all ages.\n-Try not to come at night or inebriated.   I know it's fun to go down slides drunk, but it's a very residential area and they shouldn't have to be bothered or kept up at night by the exhilarated screams.\n-Wear clothes that you don't care too much about.

Now I can resume going WHEEEEEEEE!\n\n**5/20 UPDATE**: Uhh, okay, how can I put this eloquently... I took a hot date here yesterday, and to my utter dismay found the upper portion of the right slide smeared in feces. Good lord, this is a CHILDRENS playground. How can there be such sickos in this world?\n\n**ORIGINAL REVIEW*\nI've been going here since I was old enough to put band-aids on myself. Frankly I'm a little disappointed about the park maintenance: There used to be sweet child-painted murals on the sides of each slides, the play stuff at the bottom used to be more functional, and most importantly of all: each slide used to be painted with a different color. One was red and called \"ketchup\", the other yellow and \"mustard\". \n\nFor the best ride possible:\n-Wax paper UNDER cardboard. Wooh, supercharged!\n-Try to use smaller pieces of cardboard. Extra flaps will grate on the sides and slow you down.\n-Don't go on damp (foggy/recently rainy) days/nights; the moisture adds to friction and slows the ride\n-The whole \"sand makes things faster\" idea is utter bullcrap., it only adds friction with slows you down, in addition to making the slide extremely dirty\n-Keep arms in, wear long sleeves, and pants, and closed shoes with decent treads-- the incline walking back up is steep, so flip-flops definitely will not suffice\n-Use feet as brakes near the bottom. The sand pit is deceptively shallow.\n-As hard as it is to not be loud, try to keep it down if you come here during the middle of the night, or the neighborhood residents will bitch you out Jerry Springer-style", "author": "T.Z.

We went after it had just rained and got quite muddy, but we went prepared to get dirty so it was fine.\n\nYelp's address says they're located on the corner of Douglass and Seward Street, but they're actually located in a garden b/t Corwin and Seward (the Corwin Street Community Gardens to be specific), near Kite Hill. We parked in the parking lot at the end of Corwin and walked down to the slides from there. \n\nMore info about the \"park\": http://foundsf.org/index.php?title=Corwin_Community_Garden_and_Seward_Mini-Park", "author": "Jaclyn S."}

After getting directions that stated it would take a 10min walk to get to the park from the Castro station, it ended up to be a 2 hour journey to find this little nail in the wall park which only consisted of a bench and the two famous mountain cement slides. When finally finding then I must say maybe it was the day or even the time but the slides were covered with rain water, mud and sand. Just covered. This TINY park is also located in a area where its all families and homes so it is meant for the children who live in the close community and is not meant for random visitors so sneakiness is a Key factor. \n\nThe slides looked awesome and I can see the appeal even under all the grime of water and mud but not worth going out of your way for.", "author": "Sarah S."}

As for slides, its not nearly as good as the big yellow one at a carnival, or a water slide at any water park, or the water slide at your friends in ground pool.  It is better than any slide at McDonald's funland though.    If you're really stupid into slides, then check the one at Bernal Heights Hill (below the hill to the south, towards Mission St.).  It is a standard OG schoolyard slide, straight and metal.  Wrap your hoodie around your booty and you fly down at mach 8, maybe 9, then get ejected into wood chips.

But the fun is real; I am a believer in the Seward Street Slides. \n\nNot to say that this is something to do every weekend, but every once in a while this will be totally cool to rock with some friends.  Yeah, you and a friend will be good-to-go at the same *exact* time; the slide is actually two in tandem.  Coordinate with a \"1\", \"2\", \"3\", \"GOOoooo\".. \"Ahhhhh!\".  Hmmm.. I guess you could get a posse going down at the same time if you'd like to \"train\" yourselves, one in each slide groove; grab those hips or shoulders in front of you! \n\nIn any case, I guarantee a scream, an \"oohhh\" - or dare I say: a yelp - your first time down the polished concrete of the slides; the middle drop is steep.  I'm inclined to say it's \"two-stories\" high, but they that sounds like you're dropping out of a building.  Yeah, so it's not that high, but it does have a nice double drop (i.e. slides, then flattens out *slightly*, then drops again); it's taller than your average playground slides for sure.  And set solidly into the earth. \n\nThere is a little bit of a climb to get to these guys, but they aren't as high up on Twin Peaks as I had thought.  I'd say maybe a 10 min walk from Castro and 18th (or maybe a few minutes more if you haven't been on the stairclimber in awhile). \n\nIn short, the Seward Street Slides probably won't change you life (unless you go down them naked), but *are* a 4-star attraction; another little gem in a city full of them.  And don't forget the cardboard!  If you do, there is a supermarket as well as a few corner stores on 18th on the way to the slides (towards Castro) that could probably hook you up.", "author": "Eric H."}

I did not know that the slides are closed Mondays. I'll fully admit that I am a rule breaker. I still sneak into movies and whatnot. I went up to the halfway point and slid down twice. Didn't scream hoot or holler but I could hear someone rustling in the bushes at the top of the park acting as if he wanted to be noticed. As we were leaving this middle aged gentleman who obviously lives in one of the adjacent houses starts on this very strange passive aggressive forced tangent towards my Mom and I. Talking about how Yelp ruined this park, that German people are coming at 2:00 am drunk and stomping all over his garden and how the slides are going to be ripped out and relocated in another park. He never full came out and said he was mad at us but it was obvious that the sight of the slides themselves raises this guys' blood pressure.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-07-19", "description": "If it weren't for Yelp, I would never have discovered the awesome Seward Street Slides. Though I understand the concern about them becoming too popular, hordes of shorts-wearing tourists, their spouses and children descending (or ascending, depending on your point of view) on this sleepy residential street and wreaking havoc on the neighborhood and themselves. So I will not divulge the exact location of the slides here. Those that know, know; those that don't - keep lookin'.\n\nSo for several weeks after reading all the glowing Yelp reviews about the slides my inner kid has been poking me in the ribs to find them. And, there being only so many inner rib pokings a person can stand without going totally and irreversibly cuckoo, I finally set out on my quest last night. It was foggy and drizzly out, and I still had not recovered from bronchitis I caught last week, and there I was traipsing on darkened streets of upper Noe Valley. At first I walked right by the slides without realizing they were there; only after turning back on the tiny street did I finally notice the entrance to the tiny park - and it is small, a narrow sliver of steep hillside with a cute little mini-park (more like a botanical garden) on top and the infamous twin slides at the bottom. I'd say that half of the fun of the slides is in finding them in the first place - it's a real treasure hunt.\n\nAt the bottom of the slides there was a pile of cardboard sheets in various states of disintegration. I picked a likely contender and walked  the steep incline to the top. Mmm... I remember reading on Yelp that the left slide (as viewed from the top) is the steeper one, so I picked the other one for a first attempt and braked with my hands and feet as I slid down. Hmmm, not bad. Let's try again, this time a bit faster. Whooooop-OOPSIES -oosh! Cool! How  about the more dangerous left slide? Whoooaaaa-OOPS-howthehelldoyoustopthisthing-oh. That's it? Then I tried walking up the rims of the slides while pulling myself up by holding on to chains strung between metal poles. A big tree (eucalyptus I think) growing near the right slide (as you look up) has grown right into one of the chains; this can't be good, it's hurting the tree and besides, the chain can literally saw through the trunk as the tree grows. Something needs to be done. Well, I've gone down both slides about a dozen times that night, gone up the steep rims on both sides, and here's what I think: the slides are lots of fun at first, but the fun has a tendency to wear out quickly. I mean, there's only so much you can do with a slide - you go up. You go down. That's pretty much it. I thought they could have been built longer and maybe curvier to make them more fun. A big part of the fun, like I said earlier, is going there for the first time and not knowing exactly where they are. Now that I know, they will be a good occasional stopping-off point on one of my nocturnal walks. After that - there are other hills to climb and destinations to explore. So - Froggy gives the slides four hops. And don't worry - the secret is safe with me :)", "author": "Froggy V."}

After initially being a bit skeptical, the Seward Street Slides rocked!  It wasn't so impressive at first glance... I mean, it's gray concrete, lots of cardboard boxes laying about, and some scraps of wax paper.  But, then you slide and it's like you're 5 years old all over again.  You get a lot of speed and air going down those slides.  We started racing (the west slide, I believe is faster and gives you bigger air) and landing perfect 10's at the end.  Some of the kids at the park started egging us on and getting us to place wax paper under that cardboard boxes for more speed..whoa.  That was a bit intense.

Boy, were we all in for a surprise when we arrived. As soon as we walked over, a middle aged lady raced towards us on a rampage and began yelling and screaming at us about how the slides were closed after sunset. She was so angry with rage her voice and body were shaking. We all stood there in shock, not able to get a word in edgewise. We had to laugh after a certain point at this lady's completely out of control ravings about how all the people who come to enjoy the slides had ruined her life. \n\nThe lady stormed off into her house as we stood there in shock commenting to each other how inappropriate the encounter was. A couple minutes later, as we stood there (dead sober, not sliding), the lady returned and began yelling at us again. A kid in the house popped his head out of a window and shouted \"GET OUT, GO HOME!\" - it was a completely crazy scene and we simply marched out of there as quickly as we could. \n\n....Calling all therapists- check this lady's head. She is more dangerous than the slides will ever be. Calling all cops, this lady is disturbing the neighborhood with her loud rantings. Calling the paramedics- check this lady's blood pressure- she needs some heavy medication.\n\nMorale of the story: \nDo not go to the slides after sunset. \nDon't take anyone who is prone to violence or easily aggitated to the slides or expect a fight with crazy neighborhood people.\nTry to keep the slides a secret, it is unfortunate that a few disrepectful people have driven these neighborhood folks totally insane.", "author": "Brooke S."}

A plastic food tray from Mickey D's or Burger King's, really is the best for at night, but you have to be careful, because it (the plastic tray) makes you go really fast. So fast, in fact that you can catch some serious air on the hump above the dip, and even clear the sand pit at the bottom, altogether.\n4. Stop complaining about getting hurt. You're sliding down a concrete slide for christ sakes.\n5. If you're interested about the history of the slides, hike to the top of the hill, and go visit the Corwin St. Community Garden Message Board.\n6.

I went down so fast that if i wasn't wearing my sunglasses i would have hit my head against the side. My sunglasses got chipped and scratched!\n\nWe got in trouble though from the lady that lives nearby. (the one everyone mentioned) Whoops I guess we were screaming too loud. she was really mean...so we decided to ride down the slides one more time and leave. it was so hard to not scream on the 2nd time down. But definitely worth going out! Whenever friends come visit I'll definitely be bringing them to the seward slides!", "author": "Jess O."}

It's a teeny park and little hard to find..you feel like you're going through someone's backyard.  But once you get there you'll be entertained for at least half an hour.  Be sure to bring a piece of cardboard to ride down on.  If you're extra adventurous try waxing the cardboard-it gives you extra speed and you will go airborne.  Warning: not the best idea for small children. I saw one particular child bang his head on the cement slide, catch air and then face plant into the sand below.  But for adults...hold on tight and have some fun! You'll definitely catch some air.  Also fun done in pairs!", "author": "Danielle W."}

It's super hard to get to (like a mile or two up the hill from Castro) but it's worth every last breath! Make sure to take a cardboard box with you or you'll be up a creek. And take a video camera with you. You won't want to miss the look on your face the first time you go down. It's a thrill!", "author": "Rebecca J."}

It's been a while since I've had this much fun in a park.  We must've ridden the slide at least 7 times.  You can catch air midway.  On one run, we slid so fast that we both landed on our butts at the end of the slide.\n\nGreat fun and a nice work out if you run to the top.  Best of all, no lines!", "author": "William L."}

I've been taking my son here for a couple of years now - he's 6 yrs. old and a total daredevil and these slides are the perfect \"fix\" when he has the need for speed.  \n\nSometimes I worry that someone is going to call child protective services on me for taking him there.  It is a bit of a \"child endangerment\" situation.  But WTF, what's a childhood without a few scrapes and bruises?!?!  \n\nAnd if you think that you catch decent air when going down as a semi-adult type of person . . . just imagine if you only weighed 60 pounds!", "author": "amy b."}

Just a few steps up the hill is one of the prettiest views of the city.  There's a pretty garden just above the sildes where you can sit and enjoy the plants and a picnic.  And the slides are incredibly fast and fun.  It is true, as the other reviewers note, that there's a woman who lives next to the park, who seems to relish in repeatedly opening her  window to tell people off.  But even her appearances cannot diminish the fun (can you say \"AHHHHHHHHHH!\") of the slides!", "author": "Sue S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-11", "description": "This crazy little \"park\" gets four stars for its uniqueness as much as for its fun. I can't imagine who had the crazy idea to take what must have been a useless hillside site and turn it into a \"park\" that has nothing but slides. So very San Francisco. A little dirty and rough around the edges, but great fun nonetheless. My wife and I took our two year old daughter to the slides after hearing about them from a random person on the street. It was a blast, and it took us into a neighborhood we had never been in (we don't live in San Francisco) Using cardboard, we were able to slide a lot faster. You won't slide a whole lot without cardboard, but there were plenty pieces around when we got there. Without cardboard, our two year old slid on her own and had a blast. Great for kids, great for adults. We also used Yelp to find a coffee shop and a great place for lunch nearby (Chan Chan cuban cafe - awesome)\nI only gave three stars because it is a bit dirty there and the other reviews had my expectations high of huge death defying slides. They are fun, but not the giant things I expected.", "author": "Charlie T."}

I remember when I was a kid, our YMCA counselor/guide brought us there for a mini-field trip. We'd grab a bunch of sand, throw it down the slide, steal some kids abandoned cardboard-board and use it to slideeee down that thing. Yippie! I also remember my YMCA counselor was chased by a goose all the way from the park to the car, to the park, then back to the car, and etc. until our teacher transported us all safely back to the van two at a time. Too bad for his red shirt, and for the many pecks he gotten. But then again, too bad for me and my wedgie too...Thanks Mr. YMCA counselor for saving me from that crazy goose!", "author": "May S."}

I have never been here before up until last Wednesday.  This has got to be one of SF's best kept secrets.  These slides are located in a residential district in the cuts of the Mission/Castro hills.  We were lucky to find parking right in front of the mini park (if you could really even call this place a park).  I could see how parking could be difficult there though but you could probably say that about any place in Frisco.  Anyhow, I chickened out and didn't try the slide but my husband did several times and so did my four year old son.  They said it was super fast and fun.  I didn't see any other kids there besides mines but then again, it was getting late outside.", "author": "Maryanne D."}

I understand that the neighbors are trying to maintain a nice, peaceful, EXCLUSIVE neighborhood, and I'm sure they have to deal with rowdy kids and shenanigans all the time, but there are more polite and, frankly, San Franciscan ways to deal with a situation aside from yelling out your window and talking down to three people you don't even know.  They completely sucked the whimsy out of our experience, which was, up until that point, delightful.
