It is a small little cafe in the heart of Castro. It is what you would expect for a simple diner type of cuisine. It is nothing special or fancy but it is hearty and the service is usually great.\n\nMy wife loves their orange juice which is most of the reason she loves the mimosas as well.  As far as the food goes they have your typical breakfast options such as pancakes and eggs but they also have a few healthy items that we come for. \n\nWe usually get the South Beach breakfast or the Ironman Breakfast. Both of these are low carb and protein friendly meals. They have egg white and chicken apple sausage options that are not always available at all eateries. \n\nAll in all you know what you are getting when you come to  a place like this.

I lived in the City for 17 years, and now I make sure to stop in every time I'm in town. It's a delicious diner and is a true gem. It's where the locals go for brunch and bottomless mimosas. It's where Castro dwellers commune in celebration as well as mourning, and where we recover after late nights of partying. It's the Cheers of of all-American restaurants. And the vegetarian omelette rocks. The service is friendly and fast and playful. I love this place.", "author": "Boston B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-05-01", "description": "The Cove on Castro is a casual diner located in the heart of The Castro district directly across from the theatre. It offers a rather simple menu specializing in breakfast/brunch.\n\nThe establishment itself is quite small; it provides approx. 15 somewhat-compact tables, and even those feel quite cramped in the space allotted. Though, if one can manage to secure a seat, the interior decor and sunlight shining through the window usually make the Cove an ideal place to begin the day.\n\nAs previously stated, the menu is simple--but what the Cove does offer, it prepares fairly nicely. Its eggs and pancakes are among the better that I've tried in San Francisco. The prices are fairly reasonable as well--you won't break the bank grabbing a quick brunch.\n\nNow for the bad: I specify a \"quick\" brunch for a reason. I have never seen any place as anxious to get customers out the door as the Cove. \n\nIts customer service is abysmal and I will certainly not return--which is a bummer, because I enjoyed everything else.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the (not-) bottomless mimosas for $13.95 this past Wednesday morning. We were poured only one glass before being told bluntly that \"we only refill for people when they order food.\" It stated nowhere on the menu that a food purchase was required, but we obliged nonetheless.\n\nThree mimosas later, our waiter seemed to be getting impatient and kept asking if we \"want anything else?\" We politely replied \"no thanks, we'll just drink a few more mimosas.\"\n\nAbout 10 minutes later, he brought our check without asking us. I assumed this was merely a convenience measure.\n\nNope.\n\nDude just straight-up quit serving us. He refused to look our way. He wouldn't even walk in our general direction. He simply decided that we had consumed our last mimosa--a decision he neglected to share with us.\n\nRefusing to believe what I was witnessing, I eventually caught his attention and waived him over. \n\nHe didn't come.\n\nInstead, he promptly alerted the manager who reluctantly walked over, filled our glasses once more and candidly said, \"this is one for the road.\"\n\nYes--we were being shooed out after just one hour and five mimosas. Now, I graduated college only three months ago--five mimosas do absolutely nothing for me.\n\nI left sober and dissatisfied.\n\nIt was a rather slow morning; over half of the available tables were empty. No one was waiting for a spot. The staff wasn't busy. The Cove just decided we'd had the equivalent of \"bottomless\" and sent us on our merry way.\n\nI've never seen anything like it, and hopefully never do again.\n\nAlso, there seems to be an issue with the homeless randomly wandering in and around the building. A disheveled man wearing nothing but a half-opened robe entered while we ate and began bothering patrons. It took close to a full minute for staff to respond and request that he leave. When one finally did act, it appeared that he knew the man and had dealt with him before. Just another run-of-the-mill Wednesday at The Cove I presume. Certainly not the most comforting scene to eat your breakfast to.\n\nOverall, this place is OK. Largely forgettable, but OK. If you're in a rush or don't plan to order the bottomless mimosas, it may be for you.\n\nAs for me, I won't be back.", "author": "Kyle P."}

The bun was just like the buns from some fast food chain and the alottment of lettuce, tomatoes, and onions was shamefully paltry.\n\nI had a \"glass\" of house wine that was more like a shot than an actual serving of wine. \n\nNow for the main reason for the low rating: service. The waiter had an attitude, corrected me with \"please\" when I was ordering, never checked on me, and tossed the check. Never asked if I wanted desert nor how my experience was.

That said, there are televisions placed around the cafe with little slideshows of barechested men, men kissing men, women and men kissing.  I didn't care-it's a cultural thing for my kid and I knew where I was at.  If this is a problem for you, then you need to note this.

I timed it and 40 minutes passed from the time we sat down to when they brought out our food.  I understand that it was crowded, but I don't think any other table had to wait as long.  We saw customers who entered maybe half an hour after us, and they were able to get their food right after we got ours.  \n\nIn fact, we waited so long, that one out of the three of us had to leave to get to work.  He was gonna call to join us when the food arrived or to just have us bag it for him.  So my remaining friend and I had our breakfast and the waiter said that he'd put the third order under the heat lamp to keep it warm. Now this is the part that ticked me off.  Rather than packing up the third order in a box, they threw it out.  Yet when the check came, we were still charged for it!!!\n\nLets just say that I would have popped a vein if my friend didn't hold me back.  I understand charging us for the food since our friend did order it before he left, but why throw it out rather than bagging it for us?  Does that make any logical sense whatsoever???  We asked to talk to the manager, and they said that they would remake the order for us.  Yea right, no thanks...we waited 40 minutes the first time, we didn't want to spend the rest of our afternoon in that place.  The manager finally agreed to deduct the food from the bill that they had thrown out without asking.  \n\nWell, this place does have the distinction of being the only meal at a sit down restaurant that my friend refused to tip at. Good job there!\n\nP.S. I guess I should mention something about the food since this is a yelp review...  The portions are pretty small for the relatively high price that you pay.

Well, I can recommend quite a few others far better than the Cove. \n\nIt seems most review The Cove for breakfast or lunch, so perhaps I made the mistake in going there for dinner. I paid $20 (including tip- and it was a less than $2 tip, yes...you'll see why) for a bowl of soup, a slice of bread, two glasses of wine and a plate of veggies. Ok, so for $20 that's not bad. However the food and service were mediocre.\n\nVEGAN LENTIL SOUP- not enough hearty lentils! I've made much better at home. It came with a slice of their \"house made\" irish soda bread, but if you ask me that bread was store bought yesterday and sliced too thin. Ever have soda bread at The Phoenix?!!? I was expecting it to be more like that....or at least warmed up.\n\nVEGETABLES- thankfully it was a large portion of broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots (as most places skimp on side orders of veggies), but they were cooked with just a bit too much butter. If they'd buttered it up by even 1/4 a teaspoon more I would think I was having Denny's diner style veggies (Or Lucky Penny, anyone?). Hmm...yeah.\n\nAnd as for the service... I was eyeing the corner table next to the window, as it seemed more cozy and is semi blocked off by the entry drapes. When the patron sitting there left, I looked to the waiter to make sure it was okay to move. He didn't seem too enthusiastic about having to clean up the table so quickly, so I gave him a few minutes to clear it and started to move my things. As I was doing so, he brought food to my old table and my suspicion was confirmed as he didn't even offer to help me relocate my utensils, beverage, or either of the two plates and bowl with me.

The staff is always incredibly friendly and provides good, accurate service.\n\nThe food is very good but not great, and considering that the owners of the place own a more upscale restaurant elsewhere in San Francisco, I am somewhat surprised and slightly disappointed at this.  But the food is always delicious and served promptly, so the hot food is hot, the cold food is cold.  Their coffee is a bit inconsistent, though, and sometimes it's just a little watery - usually nice and strong and rich, though.\n\nI enjoy the photo slideshows on the big LCD televisions, sometimes they put movies up there, and sometimes it's one of Comcast's music channels, so you can see the info for whatever song is playing.  That's a nice touch, as I found a cool jazz artist that way to add to my massage music playlists.\n\nI often am there for breakfast, and order the Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs, with a side of fruit salad, too.  Over easy eggs are always perfectly cooked, and the thinly sliced scallions garnishing the gravy is a nice touch and added a slightly exotic element to a traditional breakfast.\n\nFor dinner, I have ordered half the menu item on the dinner menu.  I haven't yet had a bad experience, so I'm happy about that.\n\nOverall, The Cove is comfortable, with good food and service.

But it is nice to have a quiet place to eat when the rest of the 'hood is jam-packed with men trying to get into the Bar or the Sausage Factory (don't even get me started). Great grilled cheese, great mac & cheese, great soup, great fries, great photos of patrons - I love the personal touch. But they could kick the cleanliness factor up a notch.", "author": "Katie D."}

The OJ is freshly squeezed and there are tons of pictures to look at on the walls. Very neighborhood feel. I used to go here often when i lived in the neighborhood and its always a stop when i'm in the city.", "author": "Edwyn A."}

The soup is great, but their basket of chicken is too die for.  I'm also a big fan of their Reubens.  It's a great place to eat on a budget as the prices are very reasonable.  I love the fact that they keep bringing you refills of soda it little carafes.  The service is friendly too.  They have a cool tv system that plays all the photos that they used to have up on the walls, very neat to see all the Castro history play out on the screens while you dine.  Definately highly recommended to tourists for that fact alone.  Also there's great people watching if you can sit close to the front or in the bay window.", "author": "Michael D."}

In my case, she let me borrow her lighter. wow! i tipped extra as well.\n\nI always go with the 2-2-2 (eggs-pancakes or french toast-bacon or sausage) because after a long night i usually dont have it in me to think. the omelets are hearty but remind me a cheap sushi, in how it fills you up for now and you find yourself hungry very soon after. my eggs are never runny when i dont want them to be, sausage isnt burnt, they even leave off the dollop of butter i hate on my french toast!\n\nive never been past 4pm and have never eaten anything besides breakfast. so cant help you in that department...well for the time being.\n\nThe cafe is always the typical cute older gay men and their friends talking about either their night out or just catching up. the crowd isnt very noisy and the turn around time is actually damn near perfect.\n\nthe large mimosa will set you back 10bucks, is made with freshed squeezed, and guaranteed get you feeling a little more generous when it comes tipping time.", "author": "Chan W."}

The only thing I don't like about it is the fact that I always seem to get stuck next to a table of angry lesbians.  What are they trying to tell me?!  I like the pole, not the hole...unless I'm enticed by pancakes or something shiny - then, all bets are off.", "author": "Charlene E."}

(shrug)\n\nfree refills does make my heart happy, and our server was very warm to us, which is a plus. i'm a little neutral about the joint but would not be adverse to coming back to try dinner. the fresh-squeezed OJ is really amazing.", "author": "Jenz y."}

The quality of the food is much better than you would expect on Castro. It is decidedly non greasy and the menu leans healthy while still offering comfort style fare. Additional props go to the extremely friendly staff who do an excellent job of taking care of you.", "author": "William N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2007-06-01", "description": "The pancakes are tasty. The rest of the menu is predictably diner/greasy spoon/short order cook and nothing particularly interesting on the menu that one can't get around the corner at Orphan Andy's or once could down the block when the glorious Welcome Home was still in operation, selling drinks in gigantic Texas Ware plastic cups filled with that weird rabbit pellet ice i so very much love ... ice that's so much easier to crunch on while awaiting a refill. \nBut anyway, this Cove Cafe place is TOTALLY overpriced. i mean $13 for a BLT? this is not a place in the Financial District, it's a place in the actually dingy and depressing first block of Castro off Market Street. the wait staff is disinterested at best and possibly actually clinically retarded at worst. i cannot fathom why it's always full ... but usually with older gays who must have been eating there since Castro was actually gay and interesting. \nthe one plus that does not, alas, warrant another star is the endless video show of former customers ... kind of a paean to the Castro that once was but never shall be. \nStick with Orphan Andy's for disinterested wait staff and greasy spoon deliciousness.", "author": "Kevin M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-07-31", "description": "I've eaten here before, on previous trips to SF and had fairly good experiences, which is why we went on this trip, 7/22 to 7/28.  We stopped in for breakfast on Monday, 7/27.  I was surprised to see the remodel and all the pictures on the walls gone.  That aside, the service was HORRIBLE.  There were only 5 active tables in the place and two staff on the floor.  With that ratio you would have thought the service would have been pretty good.  Too bad the two staff working were to busy talking to pay attention to their customers.  We both had orders with side beverages (milk, OJ) and those never arrived.  They brewed a fresh pot of decaf coffee..but never once stopped by for a refill or to see if everything was ok with the meals.  Doubtful I'll go there again on our trip next year.", "author": "Jeff M."}

I expect everything in the Castro to be overpriced. I had a simple hamburger and soup. First it cost almost 10 bucks. The burger tasted like rubber and the soup although good was pint size. I am going to go to more chain restaurants because I am tired of being screwed by businesses I am supposed to support because they are gay and locally owned.", "author": "Joel W."}
