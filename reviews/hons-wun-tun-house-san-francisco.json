It came out in seconds.  However, the soup was awful.  The broth had no flavor.  The noodles looked like the vermicelli I buy in Ralph's.  Beef? Pork?  Could not find any in the soup.  The soup was heavy on the noodles vs. protein.\n\nI ate about 1/3 of the soup and left.  Yeah, it was only $7; however, what I was served was a complete waste of money.  Cash only.\n\nWill I return?

The soup is spot on, nothing avant-garde, but exactly how won ton soup should taste. Exactly. The won tons were falling apart a little bit and they could've used a bit more filling, but the texture and taste was again, spot on. The beef curry was more meat than chewiness, but that's definitely a personal preference and the portions on this were huge-- could easily feed 2.5 people, even 4 if you had rice to accompany it. The rice rolls were a little more lacking-- generally, restaurant rice rolls have shrimp, green onion, and sesame, so these were a little plain. They were definitely fresh and soft to the touch, so they had that going for them. It's a solid spot for Cantonese comfort food and reminded me of being in Hong Kong.

I always come to this restaurant whenever I'm craving for a wun tun meen (wontons noodle soup). Their wontons are good portioned and the pricing here is super affordable compared to other places in SF. I would say that many people say that their service is not great and that they are rude is because of language barrier. They are not rude at all, they just can't speak fluently. It is a family owned restaurant so don't expect too much other than authentic wontons soup. The restaurant closes early so if you are craving, be sure to come earlier to get your fix. I also heard from the restaurant owner that they will be retiring soon :( so come try their wontons out asap!

It's a great place to come for a quick lunch. I recommend coming before 1 because usually it's packed since all the people that work around the area coming to Kearny street for lunch.\n\nHeads up, there is different people in charge of different areas of the restaurant. Like 1 in charge of cooking, 1 in charge of stocking ingredient, 1 for serving and 1 for payments and charges. I accidentally asked the lady to order and she said I have to wait for the other guy to take our order. I guess this is how they are organized.\n\nNow for the food, we ordered #10 beef stew wonton noodle soup. The portions are small, I remember coming here long time ago and they served so much more than now. Wontons were good and so were the noodles and beef. One thing to notice is that the noodles are not hand pulling but they are still better than ramen.\n\nOverall, it was a nice, quick lunch meal experience. $7.20 for a wonton noodle soup not bad I guess in San Francisco fidi district.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2018-04-03", "description": "It was a bitterly cold, gray and wet day, and I was trapped in the Financial District, fighting off the earliest symptoms of an oncoming cold.  The end of the Women's March had coincided with the end of my shift at a local coffee shop, and public transportation was backed-up and over-flowing with thousands of fired-up demonstrators and their over-sized poster boards.  There was no point in trying to go home, so instead I took to the streets in search of some warm broth and noodles to soothe my body, spirit and soul.\n\nAs I wondered the concrete corridors of downtown San Francisco in search of an open (and not crowded) dispenser of pho, ramen, or really any hot, broth-based delectable, I finally stumbled upon Hon's Wun Tun House on Kearny.  I shuffled in from the cold, admiring the cheap somewhat retro lay-out of the establishment, and I took a seat at the bar.\n\nWhile the digs were delightful in their simplicity, what was not altogether enjoyable - and actually rather quite distressing - was the musky and pervasive scent of wet dog that filled the restaurant and my nostrils.  There was no escaping this vile odor.  But since my craving for soup was great and my alternatives few, I simply accepted the unique smell of the House and breathed through my mouth.\n\nThe menu was pretty easy to figure out and featured a range of delicious standards that piqued my appetite and interest.  Moreover, the prices were remarkably reasonable by any standard, but especially considering the House's location!\n\nAn elderly woman took my order and I waited patiently with clenched nostrils for my order of Stewed Brisket of Beef with Noodle soup ($5.05).  After about 10 minutes it arrived, served in a white plastic bowl.  The soup was exactly what I had asked for: steaming beef broth, tasty strips of brisket among plentiful noodles.  The portion was satisfying, neither overly large nor under-ly small, and certainly a good deal for the price!  \n\nI scarfed down my soup and felt my budding cold retreat from the nourishing and warming assault of beef, broth and noodle.  I paid and left, stomach satisfied and olfactory senses relieved to be outside once more.  \n\nIn truth, I found my experience at Hon's mostly exceptional.  However, I cannot ignore the fact that the smell on that particular day was absolutely overpoweringly awful, and this definitely put a negative spin on the entire experience.  However, the food and prices were great, and if you can get behind cheap couture, then you might even actually like the ambiance like I did.  \n\nI have since begun a new job in the Transamerica Pyramid just around the corner from Hon's, and I fully intend to revisit and get a second impression of this place.  I have a feeling that the smell may have just been a fluke, and by no means reflects the typical atmosphere of the House.  If this is the case, then Hon's is actually a hidden diamond in the FiDi for all your noodle and wun tun needs!", "author": "Max T."}

This one is on the outskirts of Chinatown while Yin Du is just a couple of blocks away. Hon's is almost as traditional as it get. What's missing is the stinking open trash can on the pavement that welcomes you as you enter.  Rest of the playbook is similar to Yin Du. You will be hit with a strong smell that clears your sinuses and opens up your nostrils in one shot. If you have not already fainted, you will proceed to be ignored by the sole cook cum server cum cashier. When you finally get his attention you will get your wonton noodle soup with extra noodles to-go all for a princely sum of $5.80 + $1 for extra noodles. Again you have to undergo the torture of sitting at the sticky counter. What goes through your mind is how many people have enjoyed their soup here since this was properly wiped down? You look around and wonder how can these people actually dine-in? Are they immune to the stench? Does the problem lie with you?\n\nBefore you have an answer to all these perplexing questions you are on your way with your order in hand. As expected noodles and broth are in the same container, so you wolf them down as soon as you reach home so as not to have to eat mushy noodles. You realize that this is average. Noodles are cheap, broth is a little salty, wontons are fine nothing special and that you have to throw in your lot with all the others and dine-in; so that is what you do the next couple of times, till you realize that you have been coming here more often that Yin Du, even though both are practically the same.

I wasn't really looking forward to go, but my mom kept insisting this place was the best. So I gave in and tried it. I was a bit disappointed because I can't eat the wontons since I do not eat pork but then I found they had a beef brisket and beef tendon noodle soup. IT WAS LITERALLY SO GOOD. I loved it! The tendon was so extremely soft and the beef was simply cooked to perfection. The food was even brought out so fast. Less than ten minutes and I went twice on Saturday night and Monday night. The place isn't busy so at first it may seem like it's not so great but the food is really good. Maybe that's just me, but at the very least you should try this place. You might just love it! Also it's kinda weird that the bathroom is all the way downstairs and that you have to walk through the kitchen but tbh I work at a chinese resturant and the fact that they let you walk through shows that they are clean even in the kitchen. Of course it should be but a lot of places just aren't. Anyways definitely will come back when I get the chance.", "author": "Sarah E."}

After being foiled twice when we tried to go (they're not open on Sundays oops), we finally made it in for Monday lunch.\n\nIt's a fairly simple menu with a variety of different noodles dishes. You can also get Hon's signature rice noodle rolls, tea eggs, fish balls, etc. Not a ton of variety of appetizers, but let's face it, you were here for the noodles.\n\nSO got the classic number one -- egg noodles with won tons while I, as per usual, was tempted away by the Shanghainese style noodle soup -- pickled cabbage and shredded pork which doesn't sound appealing but is actually quite good and just reminds me of home. \n\nFood came out in probably less than 3 minutes which was fantastic. The number 1 was so good. Egg noodles were delicious, won tons were amazing -- it was just such a simple, yet perfectly executed dish. Even my Shanghainese noodle soup, which is not what you should be getting at a Cantonese restaurant was pretty spot on. I'm a happy kid.\n\nWe also got an order of three tea eggs which were delicious and super authentic as well.\n\nFinal price was probably less than $15 even after tip and tax.

The portion was typical for this noodle soup.  Honestly, I've had the same dish/bowl in SE Asia, as well as multiple places in Hong Kong.  The noodles were fine, but if you like a more basic tasting noodle, it does not have that type of flavor.  The wontons were good, and the soup was fine.  All in all the bowl was satisfying, and I would probably get it again, but I had better in Hong Kong (although honestly, I wasn't in Hong Kong, and it's a lot farther to fly there then to just come to this restaurant).\n\nThe place itself is nothing to write home about.  It's a small somewhat typical \"diner\" like Chinatown restaurant.  It's right near the park and parking garage in Chinatown.  There are a bunch of tables for 4 people, and one table that maybe seats 5 or 6 in the place, along with counter service.  The guy who makes noodle soup is doing so right up front at the window of the restaurant.  I did not see anyone pulling or making noodles on site.  Prices were inexpensive.  The tea came from a large dispenser like many similar Chinese restaurants, and served in a small glass.", "author": "B L."}

Cute little Chinatown hole in the wall restaurant. \n\nTaste-\nNoodles: You have two different types of noodles to choose from. There's the regular egg noodles which are super skinny and thin and then there's the rice noodles which are the flat and wide white noodles. I prefer the rice noodles just because they're soft and pliable in comparison to the egg noodles which are a little more al dente but that's just the normal texture of the noodles. \n\nDumplings/Wonton: The wontons come in cute little bite size pieces that I would say have more noodle than meat. The dumplings are 2/3 times the size of the wontons. Basically they're pretty much the same, same meat and shrimp filling inside of a noodle wrapper, it's just the dumplings are larger in size. They also have vinegar, soy sauce, and chili oil for you to make a dipping sauce for your wontons or dumplings! \n\nService-\nTypical Chinese style restaurant. Quick to have you order and quick to deliver you your food! \n\nRestaurant Atmosphere-\nThe tables are open for anyone, aka community tables! If you're a small party sitting at a larger table, others will probably sit down and enjoy their meal with you! \n\nThis place isn't amazing, but it's a good meal for the price. Only thing is that their bowl is a little small so if you come in hungry it may not be enough for you. They don't have different sizing options but you can always get extra noodles or more wontons/dumplings! Would recommend!", "author": "Tori W."}

Comes with a sweet sauce (hoisin?) and sriracha for dipping.  It's fine for snacking, but not very substantive.  I could see these pairing better with some beer.\n\nWonton Noodle Soup: Had to try the signature dish.  Comes in a reasonably sized portion, like what you'd serve yourself at home, not an XX-Large bowl from a pho joint.  Pretty generous amount of wontons and noodles for the price.  The noodles are quite chewy; I liked them.  The wontons are a little skimpy on the meat filling, but the wrapper was a nice texture.

It was my first time there, but I do like their wonton noodles soup. Place is small with 8-10 small tables and right across from Portsmouth Square. We came during non-busy hours ... still 3 tables eating.\n\nI started off with the Wonton Noodle Soup - oh for some reason the glass of tea with the wonton noodles really reminded me of old traditional Hong Kong style cafe. Anyways, the broth was very good and it tasted like they used traditional dried flounder and shrimp for the broth. Wontons were bouncy. Portion was a little smaller than I expected - good for afternoon snack I guess.\n\nHubby ordered the Braised Beef Noodle Soup - beef was very tender. I think they used the same broth in this, but added extra scoop of the braised beef sauce, which was good.\n\nNoodles here are very al-dente! Just the way I love it!", "author": "Sandi C."}

They hand make the noodles and most of the other stuff is from scratch. \n\nDinner for 2 came to under $13 with a coke.  \n\nThe cooking, the food and the atmosphere is similar to that of a Hong Kong establishment, at least one of the closest of its kind in San Francisco.\nI would recommend trying it at least once.", "author": "Ben M."}

Ok, now the expectations are set, let's talk about food.\n\nThey are famous for their wontons and that's what most people will come here for. I like it that they don't make jumbo sized wontons.

They have been making excellent wonton the exact same for as long as I can remember. In fact, most of the staff is the same from 15 years ago, when I first started eating here. I've eaten tons of wontons in SF, and these are the best. They are simple, delicate and consistent. The casing is so thin and fragile and it's a pleasure to bite through. The broth is homemade and apparently takes at least 4 hours, but what goes inside is secret. I usually get the #3 and add veggies. This comes with a dozen wonton. If you get the noodles or beef brisket, you will only get 6 wontons. The curry beef is also suggested. Compliment with a tea egg. When you eat here, know that you will be rubbing shoulders (almost literally at the food bar) with some old-time legends of Chinatown. It's almost straight out of a Wong Kar-wai film.

It's quite a small place with about seven tables and bar seating. If you're in a small group or come individually, expect to pay at the cash register. The service is fast and efficient. They have one chinese lady manning the register and another old man who buses tables. Unfortunately, both seemed oddly crippled, but performed their duties just fine. Don't expect a smile or a good attitude from anyone working here though. They just get straight down to business. And don't worry, the old chinese lady does speak english.\n\nThe wonton's here are the real deal though and probably the best part of this restaurant. I ordered the stewed beef brisket wonton noodle soup. You can also ask for the wide rice noodle. The beef brisket was not my favorite as it came along with lumps of fat, tendon, skin, and cartilage (basically all the works). The noodles were pretty ordinary yellow egg noodles, but they were cooked to just the right texture. The soup was also not too bland and not too salty. Each meal comes with a complementary cup of tea.\n\nThe prices were very decent and affordable. Great for a quick, simple meal anytime.\n\nAdditionally, they sell the wonton and noodle separately by the pound in case you'd like to bring them home to cook. Other items on the menu include pig's feet, beef trip, and beef tendon.", "author": "Audrey L."}

For the noodle to have the right bite feeling you have to cook itt just right with the correct temperature of cooking and the timing has to be right also. some places cook it too long and rinse it too long than the noodle will not have that right bite feel.very highly recommend if you people really want to get that Hong Kong wonton noodle taste.

I had really high expectations of Hon's since most reviews claim this is one of the best, if not the best, that San Fran has to offer.  After a few bites, I was quite disappointed.  The soup was average, and the wontons were average.  The only thing I thought was really good was their noodles.  It was thin and al dente like how it should be.  The brisket that we ordered was mediocre at best.  In fact, some pieces were kinda too chewy.  Another thing that a lot of customers seem to be ordering was their curry fishballs.  So we decided to order some.....that too was a disappointment.  It was too bland.

Rock bottom cheap and there's always enough squawking action in Cantonese by the kitchen staff to keep me entertained. \n\nThe $2 cheong fun is probably my favorite thing here. Every order comes with a plate of rolled rice noodles (similar to tteok for the Korean folk) drizzled in soy sauce and with two big dollops of hoisin and sriracha. Stuff is made to defeat Atkins dieters singlehandedly, but a solid snack while you're waiting on your noodles.\n\nThick soup noodles with beef on top is tasty here and around $4, if I remember correctly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-11-29", "description": "The Chinese character for Hon, is actually closer to \"Hung\" or \"Hohng\" in Cantonese/Mandarin...same character in Chef Hung Taiwanese Beef Noodle in Irvine...or the famous won ton noodle and dried fried beef chow fun shop in Causeway Bay Hong Kong called Ho HUNG Kee.\n\nUnfortunately Ho HUNG Kee and HON's are not related. Not even separated at birth or alternate dimension reality brother wannabe's.\n\nIt's no secret that wun tun meen (or won ton mein / WTM) is one of the definitive Hong Kong Cantonese old style comfort foods, and a symbol of homesickness. Homesick Taiwanese expats who've been away for a while, one of the things they have a hankering once they return is TW style beef noodle soup. Not sure if wun tun meen has that kind of equivalent fervor but I would hope so to an extent.\n\nThe ideal bowl of WTM is that of a mini snack size...served with a delicate yet complex broth of dried tilefish, shrimp shells (and shrimp roe for the nitpicky). Won tons delicately wrapped with silky smooth skin having excess slack to create a goldfish tail visual effect, with well balanced ratios of upper back leg pork and freshwater river shrimp (fresh product of course, not from frozen). The soup spoon should rest in the mini bowl first, with won tons resting on the spoon, then finally al dente toothsome elastic ideally bamboo pole kneaded egg noodles (more ideally made with duck eggs and alkali water) are cooked quickly in boiling water, strained then poured on top. And for a final touch, a drizzle of good ol' fashion LARD (aka pig oil, oink oink) to make it complete. Then some years ago, it became fashionable to bash this style for being too expensive with small portions, and the market evolved to competitions offering bigger bowls, siu mai dim sum sized won tons with no goldfish tail-esque slack, and a shrimpless broth replaced by Chinese Buddha fruit. Of course the traditionalists told the new style to go \"diu lei lo mo\" (basically something involving copulation with someone else's maternal unit). The sad thing is that now even in Hong Kong, the definitive bowl is pretty much starting to become non existent where you get maybe 2 out of 3 right, but still aeons and light years ahead of Northern California.\n\nWhy am I telling you this?\n\nIt's to frame everything within a particular context. \n\nHere in the SF Bay Area, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who does 1.5 of the 3 key components right (broth, noodles, won tons).\n\nHon's is an old style noodle house, as if Father Time took his polaroid, took a snapshot, and kept it frozen in time. That is, no innovation (and no improvement over the years). It's nice that before 10 am, this place is open and you could have WTM for a breakfast/brunch, and it will provide sufficient fuel to go shopping and strolling.\n\nHon's is probably the last (if not a small handful) place I know of that makes their own egg noodles in house, along with ju cheung fun (steamed plain rice rolls), as well as won ton skins. You can actually purchase these to go, which is a rare thing so see these days.\n\nHowever even with that said, there are things about the WTM that are worth mentioning\n\n- one bowl of WTM is a small snack portion, within the $5 mark. For traditionalists, this is about right, but for those looking to fill up stomach space will need to get another bowl of something or eat more elsewhere.\n\n- the egg noodles unfortunately lack a lot of egg flavor...in fact it's not just Hon's but even supermarket bought Chinese egg noodles. But if you get the Vietnamese Chinese/Chiu Chow egg noodles, those are way more robust for some reason, but then that's not HK Cantonese anymore\n\n- the won ton noodle broth...no idea what's in it. It's light and decent, but no dried tilefish flavor, and absolutely no shrimp or shrimp shells. It's not horrible, but it's definitely lacking\n\n- the won tons are VERY enjoyable here and probably the saving grace. Visually attractive, small and decent bite sized (one bite literally) with a smooth delicate skin, with some excess slack (but not too much). Sure beats those golf ball siu mai's posing as won tons.\n\n- the steamed rice rolls here are ok...unfortunately they're pre made (vs steamed to order) and already cooled to room temperature. When you request an order, the kind older lady snips them into bite sized little rolls, and NUKES them. Had they been resteamed instead, the texture would have improved a hundred fold. It didn't help that the sauces applied were lackluster (only 2 kinds), a crucial factor in the enjoyment of this deceptively simple yet messy/fugly looking snack.\n\nTo make a much better bowl, I'd take:\n\nthe noodles from King of Won Ton on Irving\nthe broth from Cooking Papa\nthe won tons from here \n\nfor my WTM. But that's unrealistic.\n\nThis is one of those places where it's so old and old style, that they even bother to make some of these low brow high labor low profit margin items, even without putting a whole lot of effort in, is still appreciated.", "author": "Ken K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-10-31", "description": "Wonton noodle soup is one of the comfort foods that I have set a high standard for myself. Continuing down memory lane while visiting SF Chinatown, I thought it may be time for me to re-visit and pay tribute to Hon's, a landmark eatery in Chinatown well known for their wontons.\n\nI wonder if this is just my personal preference. I like my wontons small and bite sized with soft silky wrappers so that they can slide down my throat. I don't care for the bigger ones that are the size of shumais (dumplings) or even worse when the wonton skins are thick and doughy in texture. The size of Hon's wontons seems to be a perfect fit for me and my throat! You can order a bowl of just wontons in a savory broth or a bowl of wonton noodle soup with fresh and springy al dente egg noodles. The wontons are stuffed with ground pork and shrimp that are marinated in sesame oil. Man are these yummy? I do recall Hon's wonton noodle soup to be without peers 30 years ago although I am not so sure if it is still unsurpassed today. My other favorite item in the menu is curry beef stew over rice that is still good as ever. I try to figure why their curry is still a stand out and the secret I concluded may be the curry powder they use and of course in part due to the beef fat. The beef is simmered for hours until the meat is tender. The menu is not as extensive as some other Chinese restaurant but there are still a lot more in the menu I have to try.\n\nAs far as the ambience goes, I remember the place was pretty run down 30 years ago and there have not been any noticeable improvements, remodels or clean ups done since then. As with any old restaurants in Chinatown, you have to learn to eat with one eye closed and hope the food would sit well in your stomach. The service is efficient and surly and I don't think the help expects a good tip either.", "author": "Geoff G."}

They, obviously, being a wun ton house, don't have jook.  So,  I made a mental note to come back and try out their wonton (wun ton).\n\nSurprisingly, I actually made it back here yesterday.  Wanting something quick, easy, and basic, I opted for their #1, Wun Ton Noodles at $3.60.  They said it would be a five minute wait, so I grabbed a seat a the counter and watched the happenings of this place.  There's one guy who runs the whole won ton show by the window.  He gets the order, and sets about getting the noodles, wonton and whatever toppings you ordered for your bowl of dumplings.\n\nThen there are the two waitresses who take your orders and collect the money.  They'll also bring out the food to you too.  Don't forget, there are a couple of other men running around busing tables and the like.  They have a lot of people in this tiny place, but they are fast and efficient.  They set you down with a plastic cup of hot tea, a pair of chopsticks, and a soup spoon.  Condiments like hot sauce, soy sauce, vinegar, etc. are available if you so desire.  (However, if you want any of those condiments to go, good luck!  They don't have any containers for this stuff, you'll just have to dump it into your soup.)\n\nTheir menu has 46 items, and that's including the rice and soda!  It's pretty basic though, and you can't go wrong with a dumpling order.\n\nMy order was ready and I brought it back to work.  I found about six small dumplings (tasty little buggers) and a decent about of egg noodles in a plastic container.  It was piping hot and I was burning my tongue with each slurp of noodles.  Oh well.\n\nNot a bad place at all when you want something quick and easy.  And for that price, how can you ever complain?  I would be curious about their brisket and stuff too.\n\nSidenote: When looking around, I just had to wonder what their health inspection card would say.

An order averages about $6, depending on what's in it and most of the time you don't feel completely full after one bowl.

It's ok to sit at a table where other people are sitting, so don't be surprised when someone plops their butt down in an empty chair next to you.  Also if the waitress ignores you when you walk in, just keep standing there or just sit at a table\n\nThere's a bilingual menu and you should just go ahead and order some sort of wonton noodle soup.  They bring a hot tea when you sit down and wipe your table down with a stinky rag that's supposed to give you the illusion that the surface that you will soon eat off of will not poison you.\n\nThey've got a guy in the window making noodles looking grumpy.  He's fun to watch.  The waitress is pretty grumpy too.  Don't make her mad or she'll spit in your food and then bitch slap you.

The place is tiny, and the service is absolutely horrible. I ordered a Won Ton (Or is is wun tun?) noodle soup from the woman at the register. She didn't take my money, and didn't acknowledge me. She came back and asked me to move to the side because she already took my order.\n\nI stepped back and waited. When another woman called out an order for the wun tun noodle soup, I stepped forward but it was promptly given to another customer. The same with the next 3 soups after that.

All over different parts of Asia you can find variations of this exquisite dumpling.  Done right, the ethereal puff of light wrappers float in the bowl of clear broth the color of yellow and gold, an intensely flavored filling that reminds you the land (from the ground pork) and the sea (the little tiny sweet shrimp) with the thin yellow wheat noodles that have the firm and lively texture.  While Hon's version may never compete with my childhood memories of one particular noodle stand in an alley way in southern Taiwan, Hon's does a very competent version of 'swallowing clouds' with plenty of authentic flavor ambiance and the attitude that comes with it.\n\nI come to this place whenever I'm craving a bowl of Hong Kong style mein with wun tuns, cooked in a big stainless steel drum and columns of white porcelain bowls with pink floral prints stacked up against the big glass window facing the busy traffic of Kearny St.  Depending on the mood, I can either come with some friends during weekday lunch hour rush jammed packed with people or on Saturday morning after farmer's market for a solitary ritual in the half empty joint.  I recommend sitting at the counter when you are here by yourself so you can watch all the actions going on in the kitchen.\n\nAmong its peers of street style food in the city, Hon's is one my top choice in terms of flavors. Robust beef brisket, spicy beef curry with the slightest savory sweetness, the wun tun that's closer to shu mai than swallowing clouds, with the same plump chewy meat ball inside the thin wheat flour wrapper that turns translucent when cooked.\n\nI've had the regular wun tun mein.  I've had the beef curry with rice, the stew brisket with blanched butter lettuce over rice.  I've had beef briskets, fish balls, tendons and char siu pork added to the mein.  Sometimes separately, sometimes all at once in the same bowl of noodle, at which point the tall Shandonese guy with the comb-over behind the counter merely raises his eyebrows then shruggs and puts the order in with the lady with a head full of big black curls, slaving away at the big drum full of boiling water (who reminds me of the land lord lady from Kung Fu Hustle.)", "author": "Sam W."}

I got 3 wonton but for the price I'm not complaining. The wontons were small but flavorful. This was the only redeeming part of the meal. The portions were small and more like a snack than a full meal.\n\nWe also ordered the gai lan (plain) and the spicy beef tendons. The gai lan were cooked perfectly and the vegetables were tender. The spicy beef tendons tasted like spicy ketchup and there were many suspect pieces of \"tendon\", including many yellow clumps of fat.\n\nWhile waiting for the food to arrive, I noticed there was a plastic basket under the counter with three servings of fun (the rolled type with chopped shrimp and green onion) inside it The basket was amongst various non-food items and  was maybe 2-3 ft above the ground. Then I saw them actually take the fun out of the plastic basket, pop it in the microwave and serve it to people. SO DISGUSTING, I thought they had put the fun down there to throw away!\n\nVery cheap but I'm so grossed out by the unsanitary conditions and mediocre food. The gai lan and wontons were edible; everything else was not.  I'm aware that most Chinese restaurants are this dirty but I don't want to see the filth while I'm trying to enjoy my meal.", "author": "Bella L."}

For those of you who do like this place, let's hope the Health Department doesn't find out about it. The \"fresh\" wun-tun, noodles, meat, etc. is all just sitting out in bowls on the counters, some right next to other diners. Our waitress picked up our menu from off the floor in the kitchen and placed it right up by all the sauces for us to peruse. The man next to me ordered something very interesting...what I can only assume may have been the beef tendon, which was picked up out of some crock-pot device and placed into a bowl. From here, the \"cook\" picked up from scissors from the sink and began to chop away at it, cutting it into bite-sized pieces. \n\nThis place is unlike any I've ever experienced...dead silent...the patrons come here to eat, and they are quite serious about it.\n\nWhile two of us were able to eat shrimp wun-tun & noodle soup and drink the complimentary hot tea for $8 total, the noodles were kind of crunchy, the broth had no flavor and the shrimp wun-tuns I ordered contained no shrimp and what I believe to be pork and mushrooms instead. This is after cruising through crowded China Town trying to find parking, which we finally did in the parking garage for the main square across the street. \n\nMy co-diner thought the glaring bright yellow Formica counter-tops were nice and cheerful, especially when the sun shines through the windows...makes the whole place glow.

However, I immediately noticed the portions were TINY and I only had three, yes, three wonton in my bowl.  What?!  My friend's probably had about five or so.  Usually when you order wonton with meat, you get the same amount of wonton as the plain order with the addition of the meat.  This ruined it for me.

Noodles, won-ton, other specialties and that's it.  Tea or water come in small, cheap plastic cups - likewise so does Coke or Sprite.  No wine, beer, absinthe, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat I think they do best, is noodles and won-ton.  \r\n\r\nYou order by #, and I usually get won-ton soup with noodles and barbecued pork (cha shu); my wife usually gets the shrimp dumplings in soup with noodles, and we share an order of Chinese broccoli in oyster sauce - flavorful and sort of healthy!  \r\n\r\nAlso good is boiled lettuce in oyster sauce - the crunchy slurpy lettuce in the molasses-thick sauce is wonderful.\r\n\r\nHon's broth is so good, it's worth having by itself.  It has the usual Chinese melange of flavors which is both sweet, salty and delectable.  As good, but totally different from Vietnamese Pho broths, but on par.\r\n\r\nValue - Hon's has to be one of the most reasonably-priced authentic food experiences in the Bay Area.  Everything is so-o-o cheap it's amazing, given the quality.\r\n\r\nOf course, no one looks like they're getting rich working here, and you have to go through the kitchen & down a classic-ly dingy set of stairs to get to the pre-speakeasy bathrooms (forget about handicap access).\r\n\r\nAnother dive:  A dive to me is a small establishment with a very limited menu offering of tastes that has been honed and developed over time until it's really good, and there aren't usually a lot of choices to dilute this experience.  The classic dive has honed their assembling of food so they have their ingredients and methods down so it's a cheap as possible.

When I came to the U.S 25 years ago, there were here, and I had great memory of their noddle.  Their noddle is closest one to the quality that you can find in Hong Kong.  You must be a wonton noddle fan to appreciate this place.  I had not been there for 20+ years, and last week I re-visited there again.  Noddle is still nothing but the best.  I can still even recognize the waiters and the owners.  They were at their retirement age and still working.  Like a review said, you don't come here for the decor nor the service, but just come here for that bite on the authentic \"bamboo\" style Chinese noddle taste.", "author": "Alex D."}

So I think to myself: \"Hmmm, It *must* be good if it draws a variety of people\".\n\nToday I passed by and stopped to study the prices on the menu taped to the window.  Everything seemed to be in the $3 - $4 dollar range.  Cheap places tend to intrigue me, so I went in.\n\nI eagerly sat at the last stool at the counter.  A male employee immediately directs me to sit on the *second* to-the-last stool at the counter.  O-kaaaaay...but whatever, right?  So I move over.  At this point, a little voice in my head is starting to think \"Uh oh...\", but I dismiss it. \n\nA lady wearing glasses that magnify her eyes puts a bowl of won ton noodle soup in front of me.  I look down to greasy noodles and about half a dozen smallish won tons - and nothing else.\n\nThe soup was okay at best.  Honestly, I'm used to larger bowls of won ton soup (with larger won tons) with bok choy/snow peas/shrimp/water chestnuts/mushrooms, etc. in it.  But I guess bare bones is what you get when you pay $3.60.  \n\nIt's cool though - the entire establishment was weirding me out anyway with their specific-stool request and a crazy Filipino dude (and I know he was Filipino 'cause 1) I'm Filipina and 2) he kept shouting \"I'm Pinoy!\" every few minutes) sitting next to me.\n\nIt's definitely worth it to spend a few extra bucks to get something you'll actually enjoy eating...\n\n:/", "author": "Karen F."}

That was 20+ years ago, and today, it has remained the same.  This place is a wonton house, and is their specialty.  This hole-in-the-wall place seems like it was ripped right out of its hole in Hong Kong and plopped down in-tact on Kearny street.\n\nAs you can guess from how I started yelping about this one, the food is good.  The soup stock has probably been brewing since I was born, and all they did was keep on adding more to it, retaining it's flavor.  You can actually taste the quality broth.  The wontons are a good standard size, packed with fresh shrimp that give a resilient texture with every bite.  Serving sizes are just right, if you like the american sizes, then buy two bowls.  But if you want just a little bit more noodle and dumplings, just say \"ga Dai\", which can also mean \"SUPERSIZE ME!!\"  Well, that's an exageration, bit you do get some more, if you do tend to eat more.\n\nThe place has limited seating and can get crowded pretty easily.  With that in mind, they may seat you with strangers too.  Like two couples at a table of 4, or 4 complete strangers.  In either case, they've expanded to an upstairs in recent years.\n\nBest of all, the prices aren't bad at all.  Other notes, they only take cash.  So if you're on of those poor saps that forgot their wallets, you can wash dishes for the day to make up for it I guess, it's not that expensive.", "author": "Henry L."}

In my most recent visits, we were seated at a round table with a random customer and had to wait about 20 minutes to place our order.\n\nLooking around, I can see the main problem is that the place is understaffed; you have one woman acting as the hostess, waitress, and cashier. She's not cute and she's never in a good mood. Most customers, however, don't mind the inattentive service and (sometimes) uncomfortable seating arrangements. \n\nPeople seemed to respond to the lack of service by being just a bit more aggressive.

They make their own everything from scratch. If you spend enough time here, you'll see that other restaurants buy their goddamn wonton noodles from this place. Yes, Hon's sells their own noodles to other restaurants without fear of losing business. Take that, suckers! You can even purchase Hon's products from Asian grocers or supermarkets like Ranch 99 [look for Hon's on the label]. The rice rolls at Hon's are also available all over the City in packaged form, but they're obviously not as good as the ones you get freshly made at the wonton house. And if rice rolls are what you dig, you better get there early because they always sell out. The rice rolls come with a few sauces and I've gotta say that the chili hot sauce is packin' some heat.\n\nCon: Hon's closes on Sundays, traditionally the busiest day of the week.

The wun tun was not cook right, too raw for my taste. The beef tendon was full of fat with THIN layer of meat, if you can even find it. My friend ordered the pork hand noodle, which turn out to be super bad to. There was no meat at all, only thick chunk of skin. Look and taste nasty. The only decent dish we ordered was the beef tendon curry. Needless to say, I do not recommend this place and will not come back even if someone is buying. Sorry, I have high expectations towards wun tun noodle.", "author": "Ervinna L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-04-13", "description": "I feel this spot's wun tun soup has received sufficient and accurate coverage in previous reviews (to reiterate - it is the shit), so I will say only this - Hon's has the Chinese curry beef and rice game on lock like a motherfucker. There is nowhere else in Chinatown I will go for my meat and potatoes. Period. When I'm feeling particularly gluttonous (like maybe half the time) I'll add on a side of spicy tendon, which I should mention is also hella on point. This combo offers the added benefit of letting you leave secure in the knowledge that, at about $11, you have balled harder than 95% of the patrons that day. A piece of advice if you're hungry - don't sit down and wait for someone to take your order unless you brought a snack with you. Just walk up to the counter and let everyone back there know what you're in the mood for (which, in case you've skipped to this segment of the review, should be the curry beef and rice with a side of tendon) until you see someone write it down.", "author": "Dil D."}

Being Asian, I can tell you this piece of advice with frank honesty.  With that said, GO to Hon's if you want a hot bowl of wontons swimming in fragrant broth, delish egg noodles, and fresh green onions.  This place actually has chili pepper sauce that's, get this - HOT!!   For me and the boyfriend, our lunch bill came to just under $10 - another reason why Hon's is well worth a visit.  Hon's also knows something about portion control (think \"2008 New Year's diet resolution\").  This helps when you're eating a carb-loaded meal that could easily induce a 3 hour food coma if you overeat.", "author": "Jennifer H."}

Its really small, but cute and clean. My friend saw they had a 90 + for their inspection (pretty good for Chinatown ay..) Their use shrimp to make their won tons (YAY! cause I don't eat the pork ones). The noodle was chewy and delicious. The soup could've been more flavorful, but only if you're an MSG addict like me. My friend was like, \"I could eat 4 of these\" because it was a really small bowl. Okay, so maybe I can't get full off one, so we ordered one won ton noodles each and then an order of just won tons to share. The won ton noodles had 5 won tons in them and the order of just won tons had a dozen. We were good to go afterwards. And plus, its under $4 for the won ton noodles, so its worth its price already. The staff are nice and friendly. And our food came out in less than 5 minutes!", "author": "Elaine H."}

Ordered Wonton and beef tenders noodle and rice roll. The food weren't bad but certainly nothing spectacular.. I certainly have had better Wonton and rice roll. The menu says it's shrimp wonton but i didn't taste any shrimp in mine, which is kind of disappointed. Another thing that stunned me is that after I order rice roll, the guys took out a plate of rice roll from nowhere and heat it up in the microwave. hum... ok?! On the up side, cheap food and quick service. Went in and out in about 20 mins for less thann $9.", "author": "Peggy T."}

Its simple, the broth and wonton fillings are a natural sweetness of from the pork and shrimp. If you want more out of a meal, you order other things on the menu - they have the gailan w/ oyster sauce dish, a good veggie addition, and other sides, like beef stew or curry, etc. The food here is not stellar, but its at least equivalent or better than most won ton noodle houses AND with price at $3.60.. thats why its so special. I havent seen anyone mention the cold red bean soup dessert here, but its probably one of the best i've had. I dont know how they get the red beans to be so soft and smooth, but they do, and its worth coming here for. There's a bit of a orange citrus flavor to it, becuase they use dried orange peels in the soup - very nice touch. clean and refreshing taste!", "author": "Mai T."}

The wontons are packed with flavors which includes a \"secret\" ingredient of deep fried dried (yes, sun-dried and deep fried) filet of sole.  It may be an acquired taste -- but if you like stinky cheeses, you'll love it -- but I am told is a very traditional ingredient in the filling from the Chaozhou seaport of the province of Canton.  What I like about them is that Hon's stuck with tradition.  Their wontons are not on steroids, i.e. not golf ball sized things (that will gag you) filled with whole pieces of shrimps just under the wrappers so you can see them with absolutely no taste because the shrimps have been bleached with borax for their \"crunchiness\".  Golf-ball sized wontons in my experience are for people who don't taste their foods.  They don't know a good wonton from a bland ball made more for the eyes than the palate.  Anyways, I digress but I take my wonton seriously.\n\n The service here is OK.  But for a wonton eatery this is just what one should expect.  What, no table cloth?", "author": "Dave M."}
