Since my friends from out of town craved for \"shaking cow\" hahahaha. But Anh Hong was closed. they picked this one so it'd be closer to my place. I was excited from reading the positive reviews from yelp.\n\nApparently, this place is described as a fancy \"Pholicious\" restaurant. Ironically, we ordered anything but Pho. We all craved for the same dish so the four of us ordered exactly the same \"Claypot Catfish\". Well, actually, one guy ordered \"Claypot Shrimp\". Usually, it'd take awhile for clay pot dish to get ready however, Mau service was quick. The clay pot was still boiling. Yum. The fish was soft, caramel coated, smelled like cotton candy. A bit salty I must say. If you ask me whether this place is an authentic Vietnamese restaurant, it's a no. A decent restaurant with a pleasant ambiance. Great customer services. Westernize vibe. Only mediocre tasting. I understand this place is known for Pho. Perhaps, other dishes aren't their expertise. \n\nI know this restaurant is marked with $$. Still, the portion is quite small for the dear price.", "author": "Bao V."}

I came in looking for something traditional and I'll be honest, I was a little disappointed at first. At first I couldn't decided to between pho and a rice plate, but I decided to go with a rice plate because Vietnamese rice plates a usually come with a small bowl of soup.\n\nI ordered the Shaken Beef. This was DELICIOUS. Unfortunately the dish didn't come with soup, so I asked for a small bowl. The soup wasn't really that great. \n\nOverall I felt like it was a bit pricey for Vietnamese food.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-07-25", "description": "When hipster meets Vietnamese food, you get Mau! This means fancy cocktails and a *relatively* expensive food menu. I tried a couple of the dishes here and some are great, while some where pretty average. \n\nDepending on when you come to Mau, it can be pretty quiet (when nobody is inside) or it can be REALLY loud. When the restaurant is full of the Mission hipsters at dinner time, it can be pretty hard to have a conversation since the restaurant seems to insulate sound very well. There's a fair amount of seating, but depending on when you come - you may have to wait up to an hour (e.g. prime dinner time on the weekends).\n\nOf the dishes that I had, my favorite include the cha ca la vong, and the Hue rolls. The cha ca la vong is a Northern Vietnamese dish that features turmeric/dill catfish - it is served over vermicelli noodles and served with lettuce, picked veggies which you mix with the fermented fish sauce condiment.  If you like, you can also ask for regular fish sauce (nuoc mam) which I prefer over the traditional fermented fish sauce. This dish is traditionally served with peanuts (as it is a Mau), so if you have a peanut allergy, I'd ask for the peanuts to not be served with it. This is probably my TOP dish here and it's reasonable at $14 since the portions are BIG.  In addition, the Hue rolls (beef with a lot of herbs wrapped in rice skin, with nuoc mam dipping sauce) and are a great appetizer and fairly filling and definitely tasty. Recommend that too.\n\nI also had the pho here, which I don't really recommend since it was a bit bland for my taste. However, of the noodles... and to note, my friends really like the Bun Bo Hue here - which I tried their broth and it was quite tasty and had the right amount of kick and spice.\n\nOverall, the prices at Mau are more expensive for what you may be used for Vietnamese food. However, Vietnamese food in SF tends to be more expensive due to higher rent/cost of living. So I'm used to paying 10-11$ for a bowl of pho - so $14 for the cha ca la vong with pretty big portions is not too much more. Plus you're also paying for the ambiance and the trendiness of being in the Mission District.\n\nI've been coming here for a few years now, and would recommend Mau primarily for the cha ca la vong and Hue rolls dishes. To avoid a wait, I would recommend coming here during off-peak lunch/dinner times - that  way it'll be less noisy and you can hear your friends/dates/S.O. while you guys eat.  I'll definitely be back for my turmeric catfish here. :)", "author": "Matthew L."}

The restaurant was packed but we were seated immediately by the hostess. Although I was pleased we did not have to wait, the table where we were seated was probably the least desirable spot in the whole restaurant, tucked way in the back corner by the registers and where the high chairs are stacked. \n\nWe ordered the Hue roll to start, my boyfriend ordered the 5 Spice chicken entree, and I had the [DECONSTRUCTED] Vermicelli bowl with pork. \n\nThe hue roll is basically just a spring roll that has been steamed - it was delicious (although admittedly not very different from a regular spring roll...). My boyfriend really enjoyed his chicken dish as did I. \n\nThe Vermicelli is a dish that I order at many Vietnamese restaurants, as it is a staple, and one of my favorites at that. This dish however, comes with the same standard ingredients but the dish is deconstructed. Typically you'll have a large bowl with a bed of cold noodles, lettuce, sprouts, cilantro, mint, and pickled carrots and diakon served with fresh grilled pork or chicken on top and a side of fish sauce to pour over your bowl. This dish had a small bowl with the pork and noodles, and all the veggies on a plate, and most of the veggies were left either whole or on very large pieces - very difficult to eat. I'm not sure how this is designed to be eaten, but it was so difficult that I ended up asking for a pho bowl to put all my food in. Once the REconstruction was complete, the food was actually very good. \n\nThe big rub here was the terrible service. I do not remember the name of our server, but my guess is that he forgot about our table as we were hidden in the corner. He came to our table 3 times. The first was to take our order, the second was when my boyfriend flagged him down so I could get the pho bowl I needed, and the third was when by boyfriend again flagging him down to get our bill. He was not rude or anything, just non-existent. No refills of our drinks, no check-ins to see how the food was tasting, no request if we would like to order dessert. Maybe he was just busy and had lots of other tables that were not hidden...I'm not sure. \n\nI spoke with the manager before leaving and said he hoped we would return and assured me that our next experience would be better. I'll have a hard time talking my boyfriend into eating here again.  We shall see.", "author": "Taylor D."}

The beef broth was good. Meat was quite generous but noodles were lacking in portion.

I never had the food in Vietnam, my boyfriend who grew up in Vietnam says the food tastes really similar. They have dishes he says doesn't normally see at other Vietnamese restaurants. We tried their Bun Cha Hanoi twice, turmeric fish and caramelized cat fish. I love their Bun Cha Hanoi, it comes with fresh veggies/herbs, vermicelli noodles, and the meat on the side with their sauce. I like the fact that their pork is tender and they come with meatballs too. My bf is always impressed that the waiters can say/pronounce the dishes in Vietnamese.

And it's probably because every family will put a spin or twist on their culture's cuisine. I came to this restaurant with an open mind and with an unbiased mindset. \n\nI went here with my friend at 12pm on Tuesday, per the recommendation from my brother. Immediately when the doors opened at 12pm there were at least 6 tables sat. We were surprised because I have never seen that happen before at a restaurant - so my expectations were quite high and I was super excited! \n\nCleanliness (4/5): Everything seemed clean. No dried water marks on the serveware or glass cups. No visible stains on the table clothes or chairs. All around, it just looked clean. \n\nCustomer Connection (4/5): We got seated right away. Welcoming greeting. The server probably had around 5 tables (and it kept increasing as we sat there) so I totally understand he was quite busy. Speed of service was okay; but, I wasn't expecting quick service. The thing that stood out the most for me in terms of connection was the server's genuine option between two salads I was debating on ordering. More often than ever, I always hear \"well it depends on your taste\". I 100% agree but I wouldn't be asking for YOUR opinion if I didn't want to hear it. So, THANK YOU server to being honest. He also checked up on us throughout the meal. Overall, pleasant! \n\nService/Product Quality (3/5): We ordered the papaya salad, banh xeo (basically a vietnamese savory crepe), and the cat fish claypot with brown rice. Out of the three, the papaya salad was DELICIOUS. I generally don't like papaya ... or I though I didnt...but this salad was a great fresh start to the meal. Again, thank you server who recommended it. The banh xeo was similar to the ones my mom makes but also different. The overall taste of the banh xeo was okay. The problem I had was that the crepe itself was thick so the under layer was soggy and undercooked while the outer layer was crispy. I assume the crepe was too thick. That wasn't good. The Cat fish claypot was ok, but too salty for me - that could be my own personal preference as I have cut down on my sodium intake. \n\nI might come back to try other dishes like noodles with grilled steak/beef or even the pho.", "author": "Martin N."}

Everything was mediocre/fine but I know it could have been better for sure. I came here for lunch with my friends and was seated right away. First thing I thought to myself when we walked in was, \"Where are the Viet people?\" I think I might have seen one person working in the kitchen but the rest of the employees were white, which is fine but is something I'm not used to seeing when I think about going to a Viet place to eat. The space is nice and pretty. We took our time figuring out what we wanted then ordered. It felt like the food came in about 20-30 minutes which was fine since we were talking. I ended up ordering the claypot catfish.\n\nWe were all pretty hungry since we didn't eat much for the whole day so when the food came out we were ready to chow down. I, on the other hand, was let down when I saw the size of the clay pot. It's like one of the small stone bowls used to eat kimchi tofu soup. It matched the size of the rice bowl, which I have to say it was nice that it comes with rice. But for the price I am paying, I expected portion size to be a lot bigger, so seeing a small pot come out made me sad but I still had hope in the flavor. My friend's food came out and it looked perfectly portioned for an ok price but I believe my item was one of the more expensive items so I would expect a bit more.\n\nThe texture of the fish was soft and easy to chew. No bones. It was seasoned very well but it was a bit on the salty side for me. I recommend\u200b eating the fish with the rice, but if you want to eat the separate I also recommend drizzling the fish sauce at the bottom of the clay pot onto the rice to give the rice some flavor too. The meal for me consisted of putting the fish onto the rice because of the saltiness that kept building up. In the end it left me content and not full, though I was eager to eat a whole hardy meal for lunch.\n\nOverall, food is fine to eat but portion size might be questionable. I also did notice a lot of waiting around for people to tend to us but most of the time it was us flagging down a waiter. I could go back to try all of the other Viet food as well to see my take on it but I can get the exact same things from my home or any place in San Jose since there is a large Vietnamese population there.", "author": "Timothy D."}

I def have to give the food quality some credits. Unlike others, MAU didn't twist the taste or the origin of Vietnamese food - good job. \n\n- I don't know about others but GOD, go easy on the salt & fish sauce please - it's SO salty for my taste buds :( \n\n- Pho is OK. Not really my style since I'm from Northern Vietnam. \n- Bun rieu (Crab noodle soup): Don't say it as a crab noodle soup when you are using ground pork to imitate the \"crab\" in this dish. I like the fish because it's flavorful & has more filling to it but It's not \"Bun Rieu\" if there's no \"Rieu\" to it (Crab meat) \n\n- Grilled Pork Noodle is another recommended dish. (Big meat patties though) \n\n- Tofu Clay Pot is another good one \n\nIn conclusion, it's a good place to try Vietnamese food and at least you are getting something close to the authentic Viet food. 4*/5", "author": "Thao P."}

And if it comes back, then you know it's meant to be. \n\nThis saying rings true for me when it comes to Mau. When they first opened, I didn't want to like it. This was when I was younger. More naive. I said things like \"The only good pho places are hole-in-the-walls.\"  \"Is this place asian fusion. Ew.\" \n\nBut then I tried it. And I did like it. \n\nI went there a couple of times, not a lot.\n\nBut then in November 2017, they closed. I walked by it and my heart sank. Oh no... Mau closed. This is upsetting because I did like it, but I didn't go very often. Worst of all they are closing because their landlord is trying to jack up their rent. \n\nI look across the street to West of Pecos. Which is not good. They get good reviews on yelp and are always busy. Even though they are... NOT GOOD.  And I look at Mau - tasty food, decently priced (for valencia street), great ambiance... and I wonder - WTF?? \n\nIt's a decently priced asian place with good food right on Valencia street. And now it's gone. Probably to be replaced by some not good, expensive fusion place of some type. \n\nYes, still harking on fusion food. Old habits die hard.\n\nBut then, I walk by and I see a sign. They're coming back! They've worked it out with their landlord who tried to kill them.\n\nSince then, I've been back to Mau a few times. And I have to say - they really are very good. I love their ultra hearty noodle soups. And I love they have a large variety of them. \n\nFor anyone who complains that you can get Pho for a lot less than that somewhere else, it is true. But you have to consider that they are paying for rent on Valencia street. You are eating at a clean place with nice decor and ambiance. And their ingredients are super fresh. So yeah, you're going to pay a premium compared to the hole-in-the-walls. Deal with it. \n\nAll-in-all. I'm glad Mau is back.

Mau gets the seal of approval from this Viet foodie!\n\nI have to say, I have been depressingly disappointed with the quality of Vietnamese food in the South Bay (especially San Jose) and it took a hipster-ish Vietnamese restaurant in the Mission to restore my faith in the cuisine of my motherland in NorCal. \n\nWhat I love about Mau is the freshness of its ingredients and how it doesn't tone down or back down from the strong South East Asian flavors of fish sauce or fermented shrimp paste. \n\nLOVE the modern, fun, and pop punk-ish atmosphere.  It's rare to find a Viet place with a decent wine last and killer cocktail menu.\n\nMau has a mix of Southern & Northern Vietnamese dishes, some of which I've never even tried before like the Northern Bun Cha Hanoi which has now become one of my favorite dishes.  Here, the noodles are served separately from the meatballs and fish sauce.  It was a revelation in flavor to eat.  \n\nOther dishes to order:\n\nCh gi\u00f2 - Vietnamese fried imperial rolls.  These should NOT be confused with the spring rolls in which the rice paper is not fried.  You get three to an order.  The imperial rolls are cut up into smaller pieces.  The traditional way to eat these is to wrap them up in the lettuce provided and pile on the fresh herbs and noodles - almost like you're making a lettuce wrap.  Not a lot of places serve it this way. Love it!\n\nFrog Legs - found them to be a bit on the dry side, but still not bad.  They are deep fried. The jalape\u00f1o dip served with it really helped brighten it up. \n\nHu Tieu - BEST I have ever tasted!  The garlic-infused chicken broth was AMAZING and tasted so clean and fresh.  Perfect for a cold winter day. \n\nBun Bo Hue - probably the only miss that I've tried so far.  Something about it just tasted off.  \n\nThe Pork Chop rice plate - probably the juiciest pork chop I've ever had at a Vietnamese piece.  Must get!\n\nI wanted to try the Hue Rolls and Cream Puffs, but they ran out.  Will definitely be back to try it and all the other dishes.", "author": "Hieu H."}

Since my first run in, I've been to this place a few more; huge win for me in the Mission area. \n\nWhen you walk in, you're pleasantly surprise as it's not your typical Vietnamese \"mom and pop\" joint. Nice ornate chandeliers, lots of wood work, exposed kitchens; the makings of a fun hip place! The staff was super nice and helpful; wait wasn't too long in all accounts. The tables were strategically places so you didn't necessarily feel like you were sitting on top of your neighbors. \n\nWhen you visit, be sure to get the Mau drink for $9: ginger infused soju, ginger beer and lemon. It's a very summery-type cocktail, not strong, easy to the tongue. I love the ginger tone you get with this drink. For our appetizer, I ordered the spring rolls for $8. This is THE BEST spring rolls I've had. Ever. Let's start with the fact that the spring rolls are at least double the size than other restaurants. So big, they cut them in 3 pieces. With two whole rolls, you get 6 mini rolls, easily able to be shared amongst a small party. In it was poached shrimp and pork, vermicelli noodles, mint and served with a peanut sauce. I LOVE the ratio of filler and protein. Such a filling app. HIGHLY RECOMMEND that!\n\nFor the few times I've visited, I've gotten two types of dinners worth discussing. First, the Pho Bo for $10.50. I feel like you can't go to a Vietnamese joint and not get pho. In my pho, they had rare eye of round, brisket, rice noodles and other veggies in a broth. I LOVED the broth; so rich and full of body. Sometimes I get pho somewhere and the ratio of bean sprouts and noodles are off. Not here. Lots of noodles to fill you up; in fact the bowl was big as it is and filled to the top with things. LOVED IT. Another dish I would highly recommend is Is the Pork Shoulder Rice Plate for $11.50. Grilled thin pork, lemongress, shallots, garlic and served with picked veggies, rice and fish sauce. I'm just in love with this dish. They give you so much food! I had another meal with my leftovers. Pork was perfectly grilled and the fish sauce really enhance the flavor. \n\nOverall, such a major win for Mission. This place is on point, the staff, the food the ambience. I REALLY like the fact that for an upscale nice joint, you aren't going to pay an arm and a leg for. If you're on Valencia, walk your happy butt to this joint and check it out.

It's sad to see the wage disparity between really good hard working people vs the millennial, whiter servers. We were seated quickly but not greeted or even offered water for a long time. \n\nWhen I finally received my order, the runner pushed things aside on the table with the plate in his hands (who does that?!) with no expression or a word. The server got my order wrong and when I pointed it out he blamed it on the runner (so much for looking out for the team) and made no apology or explanation on if I'll get my correct item. So the wrong item just sat in front of me while I watched my friend eat. I was so pissed at the whole restaurant's lack of communication with themselves and to their guests.

Just order them. Don't ask why. Don't ask about any other appetizers. Just do it. You'll thank me. The quails were well-seasoned and had an explosion of flavor. It's a delicacy, so it didn't have much meat, unfortunately. The rice rolls weren't far behind either and was tasteful with every single damn bite when dipped in the accompanied sauce. These appetizers were about $10-$12 bucks each.\n\nFor my main entree, I ordered the Hu Tieu. Each sip was greeted with so much and it was so smooth! I definitely loved my choice!

Given that it's the bay area, shouldn't be too hard right? \n\nExcept we were in the Mission on a Saturday night feeling disgruntled that our dinner spot of choice (FOB Kitchen, a pop up Filipino spot) was unexpectedly not going to be popping up for the night. Doubtful about the Asian choices in the Mission, we quickly turned to Yelp and came across Mau which we all loved. Thank goodness for Yelp!\n\nWe got here around 7 and there was no wait for a group of 5. We got seated immediately and started perusing the menu. Half the party wasn't too hungry, but we decided to each order an entree and take any leftovers home.\n\nI ordered the five spice chicken rice plate and was really pleasantly surprised by how tasty the chicken was! Some of the breast pieces were a little bit dry, but both the white and dark meats were very well marinated and flavorful and went great with the rice. My only complaint, if I had to pick something, was that there wasn't enough rice. The meat-to-rice ratio was pretty high, but I didn't mind since I only ate half and took my leftovers home, so I just ended up eating the remaining chicken with leftover rice I had at home.\n\nI didn't try my friends' orders but they all seemed to really enjoy them too. Two friends both ordered bun thit nuong (pork with noodles without broth) and it looked really good. I wouldn't mind coming back here to try that!\n\nService was good. Our server checked on us pretty often and we got our food soon after we ordered.\n\nParking was a bit of a struggle, but it's the Mission on a Saturday night so to be expected.

My boyfriend and I were still seated within 10 minutes, which was a good start. But after being seated with menus, we waited around 15-20 minutes without any water before a server came by, and even then, it was only because we flagged him down. After ordering, we still didn't receive any water until we reminded the server again, another 15 minutes later. 30 minutes without so much as a glass of water...kind of ridiculous.\n\nThe Hue Rolls we ordered as an appetizer came out fairly quickly and were super flavorful and fresh. Amazing starter that I'd definitely recommend. They were great with the chili sauce, which I had to swipe off an empty table since service was already nonexistent at this point, with no one coming by to check on the table.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the Bun Thit Nuong as his entree, but they forgot to bring the sauce that it's supposed to come with. Again, we had to ask a server for it. It tasted great...after the unnecessary additional wait for the sauce. I had the Bun Bo Hue, which was noodles and beef in a spicy lemongrass chicken broth. I didn't think it was as spicy as I was expecting and wanting it to be, but I still really enjoyed it. \n\nAfter finishing our meal and asking the person that cleared our plates for the check, we waited for the check...and still no check. Once again, we had to ask for it again. Then another unnecessarily long wait before they picked the check back up with the card. \n\nThe shitty service would've been kind of more acceptable if the restaurant was packed during our entire meal, but they were winding down and preparing for closing towards the middle and end of our meal...during which the service was still terrible.

The Cha Gio (crispy-fried rolls) is always a crowd pleaser and if you're not on a budget, the Pork Chop plate is muy bueno. \nSince Mau is not your typical Vietnamese restaurant, there is a 4% San Francisco employer mandate fee and a 2 credit-card limit per table.", "author": "Grace L."}

They advertise young coconuts in line with their tropical theme and boast a tropically themed interior.  I've tried several of their vermicelli bowls, beef phos and the bun bo hue (The spicy lemongrass pho). I find their food lacking in flavor or flair and as for the bun bo... it was the wateriest and worst balanced broth I've had. I get that they're trying to curb the flavor and spice, but that doesnt mean it should be bad... Its pretty disappointing because there is a good atmosphere, great location and a lot of potential here.", "author": "Quinn Li O."}

No wait for bar seating but a table would've required some wait. The atmosphere of the place was nice and more on the trendy side of Asian restaurants. Food, on the other hand, was just okay, although I didn't try much so I'd still be willing to come back and try more of their food. Prices are definitely on the more expensive side though, especially for the portion sizes.\n\nI stopped by for a quick, light lunch and got the LOTUS ROOT SALAD ($11.50), which was decent but not particularly memorable. Light and healthy tasting (minus the fattiness of the pig ear and the crunchy rice chips) and a pretty crunchy salad overall with the lotus root, carrots, celery and bell peppers. I was expecting the lotus root to be crunchier but they reminded me of limp celery.

At first glance, the interior was very appealing, it is definitely a great place for a casual dinner date, especially with the lightly dimmed room. The servers were very attentive, which was a plus.

When we received the dish, the temperature was lukewarm, which made it very unappealing. The meat in bun bo hue is suppose to be a variety of pork, fatty beefs, and porks blood, however this place had its own version. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but it just lacked the flavor that Bun Bo Hue is suppose to give. I was pretty disappointed, sad to say. \n\n2.

The prices were very reasonable by San Francisco standards, but the City charged a two percents surcharge, so the F&B workers could have health insurance. Whatever....\n\nI was wet when I got back to the hotel.  The wife wants to me to join her in dining, but I needed to get a hot shower and get out of my wet clothes.

As we waited at the counter, several other customers were waiting to either place their order or receive their order. However, no one acknowledged any of us. For over 5 minutes. The entire staff was in or near the kitchen moving takeout boxes and tickets around - apparently too busy to help any of us. I would have been fine if someone apologized and asked us to wait and thanked us for being patient. But nothing. Not even acknowledgement of our presence.

Our waiter started off very professional and seemed as if he knew what he was doing. Admittedly, we did ask a lot of questions about the menu, but mainly because we like to know what we are ordering because we both are pretty particular. He began to become uncomfortable with the inquiries, so we ordered our entrees. Beef pho and Tamarind Prawns; his knowledge about the dish seemed to be lacking since he failed to mention that the prawns, although shell-on, were unable to be peeled since the shells ripped the shrimp meat to pieces from being stuck together. It was unpleasant, messy and just not something I was ready for so I asked the waiter about it and he just stood there saying how he warned me the shells were still on the shrimp.. that wasn't my concern.. the shell should come off the shrimp SO I CAN EAT IT\n\nMy partners pho was good, a bit of a rich broth for pho if you ask me, but delicious nonetheless. The sparkling lemonade was just mineral water with sugar and chunks of meyer lemon in it it seems. The point is, the food was pretty great, the flavor of the tamarind and shrimp was phenomenal, I just don't enjoy eating shrimp shells and I was under the impression I'd be able to peel the shrimp easily. The waiters response was dry and ignorant. When the manager arrived, she was sweet and she was kind enough to remove the item from my bill, so we paid and left. I would return, I just don't know how I'd react if I saw that waiter at my table again, nor would I ever recommend this particular shrimp dish to anyone.\n\nPapaya Salad - Amazing, fresh, not spicy like a typical order would be. The shrimp was sliced thin so it wasn't overwhelming. Comes with large puffed shrimp chips.\n\nMussels - creamy and good. arrived a bit tepid, but the large, crusty bread piece that soaked up the salty broth made up for it.\n\nBeef Pho - dense, meaty broth. the veggies added were sliced thin how I like them which is perfect for a hot thin broth. The tendon was perfectly tender and the tripe was so thin it melted in your mouth.\n\nShrimp Tamarind - don't get it. the tamarind sauce is spicy, salty and sweet just like a classic tamarind sauce, but the sauce makes the shells stick to the shrimp in an unpleasant way. you cannot peel any of them without having you hands covered in sticky sauce and missing out on chunks of shrimp because it cant come off the shell.\n\nFresh limeade - REFRESHING and so good, would love to have gallons of this\n\nSparkling Lemonade - When i took my first sip, i drink up a bunch of sugar syrup and lemon chunks and then the rest tasted like mineral water.\n\nOverall -- hope to try the restaurant again, but not for lunch.", "author": "Nate A."}

The waiter never came back to ask how anything was.\n\nAs far as pacing, the appetizer came before our drinks did. Drink refills took awhile, but water was replaced regularly which helped.

Not funny ha-ha but funny like Michele Bachmann explaining how gays are fully responsible for pedophilia while she maintains her seat in Congress. Except that's more scary-funny. Mau isn't scary-funny, but it is funny that Charles Phan has pretty much sewed up this market with Slanted Door and Out the Door. There was Zadin in the Castro - but that closed, and Sunflower in Potrero Hill except they're about as edgy as Aunt Martha's Old-Fashioned Salad Dressing. Mau definitely fills a void, and while I was ready to drink the haterade when I first saw this hipster-centric Viet spot on Valencia, I don't. The food's good, and the service is friendly if a bit harried. And why not since the prices ain't that bad.\n\nIt was about 6PM on a Tuesday evening when I went, and the place was already jumping. Long tables crowded with high-squeal Asian girls, tables for two where young marrieds squeezed in their state-of the-art baby pram. Even the main counter was packed with lonely young men slurping their pho bowls before they pursue their net failed Kickstarter campaign (photo: http://bit.ly/VaRMpW). Strangely there was a skinny counter that cuts down the middle of the restaurant where nobody was sitting, so of course, I sat there even though it doubled as their menu and water-glass storage space. The menu is pure Vietnamese with no attempts at pan-Asian acceptance (photo: http://bit.ly/1sxMEHX). I believe they abandoned that idea when they first opened a couple of years ago. I ordered what I was told was a must-try, the $11 Lotus Root Salad (photo: http://bit.ly/1sxMEHX).\n\nQuite a variety of fresh ingredients here with the sliced lotus root surprisingly complementary to the shaved pig's ear. There was also shrimp and a lot of snappy vegetables - carrots, celery, red bell pepper, onion. Rau ram and mint was used in place of cilantro, a nice touch, chopped peanuts were used as a garnish, and there was the welcome crunch of shrimp chips. Yep, I liked this one, and it wasn't heavy. But I obviously came for the pho, but my choice may shock you. I went for the $9 bowl of Pho Ga, probably their simplest variation (photo: http://bit.ly/1yh7UDA). It's a ginger-chicken broth with shards of poached chicken and rice noodles. That's it, a bowl of pho my Yiddish mommala would approve. With plenty of siracha, it's delish.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...traditional Vietnamese with fresh ingredients, good stuff\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...hipster-heavy and buzzing in the evenings if you can stand it\nSERVICE - 4 stars...friendly and trying to keep track of the overflow\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Tin is more like Tintin compared to Mau...if you know what I mean", "author": "Ed U."}

Yes it's Americanized in the essence that it caters to a more Americanized crowd, however the food is pretty authentic tasting IMO. \n\nThey have dishes from all regions of Vietnam - north, middle, south. I ordered the Bun Cha Hanoi - which is a rice noodle dish served with fresh veggies (lettuce&various herbs) and grilled fatty pork with a mixed fish sauce. Looked like all my friend's dishes were great as well, everyone really enjoyed it. The service was also very nice, the only complaint I had was that it was super hot in the restaurant, not sure if that was a normal thing or just something that was going on that day.

Yes, service is sometimes shotty, but the delicious food makes it all worth it. That being said, I think you have to have the right perspective about Mau. It is not the authentic vietnamese cuisine found at a hole in the wall in the Tenderloin. It's not going to have your mother's pho broth that is cooked for over 10 hours. It's more modern and fusion-y and you definitely pay a premium for that. I mean, come on, it's on Valencia in the mission.\n\nI always order the spicy chicken vermicelli. The chicken is so flavorful. Normally, I never order chicken because I have a phobia of dried meat but not in this dish! It's sooo moist (Ew, did I really just say moist?)

I can tell they were dry noodles that haven't been reconstituted in boiling water long enough. Broth was watered down and lacking in flavor that good slow cooked bone broth would have. MSG doesn't give you that flavor .. just a headache or stomach problems afterwards. Also who serves Pho with pickled red onions?? I grew up eating great pho made by my Vietnamese mama so I have higher expectation but the pickled red onion is just plain weird. My BF had the beef pho, he said the meat in the soup was tasty. \n\nService: poor. After walking through the door, was ignored for a good 5 mins before we could even achieve eye contact with tall skinny host guy who without a single word or smile walked right pass us. A nod, a smile, a \"be with you in a second\" would have been great. You're in the business of service and this is basic good customer service practice. Maybe he was too cool to smile? Once seated, waited maybe another 15 mins before anyone acknowledged us. Our actual waitress was nice though. She apologized for the delay service and had a genuine smile. To the manager on duty that day (red sneakers)- when you have so many people complaining about service on Yelp, it's a management problem not necessarily any individual staff's problem. When you ask a customer if there is a problem and she tells you, acting defensive is not the way to respond. \n\nPrice: chicken pho for $9.50 is the going price for SF now a day so I'll give them that. \n\nLocation: heart of hipsterville..that has its own pro's and con's.

I got the pork clay pot which had slow braised pork belly and shoulder in a rich, savory sauce. The jasmin rice was super good too! I heard the zonirushi rice cooker go off in the background so that explains the fluffy, moistness! My boyfriend got the bun bo hue, which had super clean and spicy broth! I've never had it so good!

Occasionally your AT&T iPhone actually DOES get more bars more places than any of your other friends' smartphones. I'm sure at least once in recorded history, some billionaire from Malaysia needed assistance with a funky tax loophole and actually deposited money into some American's account, and let him keep 5% of it when the transaction was over. \n\nAnd, every once in a while, a stylish upscale Vietnamese restaurant in a non-Vietnamese neighborhood with non-Vietnamese staff actually serves awesome Vietnamese food. I seriously would've thought that my chances were better of getting the aforementioned $250,000 hookup from the dethroned prince of Terengganu.\n\nMy new yoga buddy recommended this place after last night's class, and I was quietly skeptical. My general experience of Vietnamese food is that the places that look like they're about to be shut down are the truly awesome places. Grungy fish tank in the corner, staff look harried and rushed, cash only, the register is covered in a hazy plastic sheath. THAT is usually where you strike culinary gold. Those are the places you can't wait to go back to.\n\nGenerally speaking, upscale Vietnamese is like a T.G.I.Fridays with a side of soy sauce. Lacking genuineness, and appreciation for authenticity, and just all kinds of Americanized. This place was NOT like that. The food was as authentic as I ever had, the flavor palate was spot-on, and the presentation was beautiful.

We walked in on 11/13/16 at 9:45pm knowing that they close at ten.  We knew what we wanted and it shouldn't have taken too long.  I'm a cook and she's a server so we understand that it sucks to have last minute customers.  We wouldn't have gone inside so late if there were not people eating.  There was still plenty of people talking and waiting on food.  We could see right away that the staff was frustrated and irritated that we walked in.  \n\nOur server came by, Keric A, and gave us the menus and let us know that the kitchen will be closing.  I said we are ready to order.  \n\n1 order of hue rolls\n1 chicken pho\n1 bun bo hue\n\nI told Keric that I would like to substitute the chicken in the pho for lemongrass pork instead and he immediately said \"uumm... no, we don't do that.\"  I told him that we were here last week and it wasn't a problem then.  \"oh okay, the reason I say no is because the chefs always change the menu.\"  \n\nwhat the hell does that have to do with anything?  I said I would like you to check for me because we substitute it all the time.  the chicken meat is not really good.  so he came back and said \"the chefs were willing to do it this time but I can't serve you the pho anyway because we are out of chicken stock and we also don't have any more hue rolls...its been a long week.\"\n\nagain, wtf!  I don't give a shit about your week.  why didn't he know that he was out of hue rolls to begin with?  he didn't even offer spring rolls or any other substitute.  how do you run out of chicken stock?  I told him that's fine.  can I just get the stock that she's getting with the bun bo hue?  \"well... that's a beef stock ...\"  I told him that it reads chicken broth on the menu.  so I told him I'll take pho but with the spicy bun bo hue broth and lemongrass pork.  \n\nwe waited a short while and than he dropped of two bowls and walked away.  my wife called him back because she noticed that there wasn't any meat in my bowl.  she asked if I was getting the lemongrass pork and he said \" oh... they didn't put it in there? I'm sorry... I guess they didn't make it.  let me check with the kitchen.\"  when he left I told my wife that the pork should be on the side and I'm surprised that he doesn't know anything about his menu.  I was actually upset because the noodles in my broth was the round noodles that come with bun bo hue.... I wanted the regular thin pho noodles.  at this point I was super upset and he came back with the lemongrass pork and he was excited to drop it off....\" here it is!  they did make it for you.\"   was it really that fucking hard?  thanks for doing me such a big favor.  my wife started to tell him about the noodles but I just said forget it... its late... let just eat and get the hell out of here.  \n\nI tipped him a big fat zero...

I wish they gave more mint & lettuce, but at least their fish sauce was on point.\n\nFrog Legs $12 - I thought this dish was pretty mediocre and would probably recommend skipping this.

Not the best I've had, but still decent if you were craving bun rieu.\n\nBun Thit Nuong $10 - My friend got this and she couldn't finish it because it was huge, so I finished it for her. The lemongrass pork was great! Lots of flavor and the bowl had a good amount of vegetables to balance it all. \n\nPho Bo $9 - I added tendon for an extra $1. It was quite pricey and really bland. The tendon was really small and almost non-existent. The bowl had a terrible noodle to meat ratio too... too much noodles. It may have been that they westernized this dish too much. I tried to ask for nuoc mam (cooking fish sauce) to salvage it, but they gave me the sweet & sour dipping one (nuoc mam cham) instead.\n\nService was definitely below average.

That's all. =)\n\nThe newest addition to the ever growing foodie scene in The Mission is Mau, a Southeast Asian restaurant that opened last Wednesday. With 95% of the food being local and organic, former Slow Club's Chef Sante Salvoni focuses on Vietnamese and Thai cuisine with a California twist. No MSG is used.\n\nJust like with most ethnic cuisine in The Mission, Mau was a mediocre hipster attempt at Southeast Asian cuisine. I wasn't expecting authentic cuisine rivaling the crackheadville Tenderloin but I expected more than uninspiring and uniformly bland dishes (where are the bold Asian spices?). I shouldn't have to douse everything with nuoc cham (Vietnamese dipping sauce) just to get some flavor.\n\nF O O D\nA very limited and unbalanced menu with just four appetizers, one vegan noodle dish, one rice dish, three soups, and two entrees, Mau seriously needs to beef up their menu (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_-7VgjSfibitQ1-TBvE0Aw?select=dA5FFN-pZRcEh46lcpkd9Q#m9cAGCRQqwNT_7VjZutDiQ).

BORING. Don't get me wrong, the pork belly was tender with a nice fat to meat ratio but there was no braised fatty skin or crackling skin which is the highlight of Asian style pork belly.

For those of you not from around here, if you don't have a reservation, expect about an hour wait on the weekends around dinner time.\n\nATMOSPHERE & SERVICE\nThe atmosphere is pretty lively. There's always a diverse crowd around. But the service here is pretty mediocre, which might be because it's just so dang busy, but our server came over three times: give us water, take our order, give us our check. I usually prefer our server not come by because I like to eat in peace, but when he doesn't come by to refill your water or check when we need something, I mind a little.\n\nFOOD\nI ordered the Hu Tieu, which features pho in a garlic chicken broth with poached chicken, xia-xiu pork, ground pork and one shrimp. I'm torn because the garlic chicken broth and the pho were really really good. But the chicken itself was way too tough, and surprisingly dry, despite it soaking in the broth. The xia-xiu pork is really good and makes up for the lack of moisture in the chicken. I could do for more shrimp though -- there's literally only one.\n\nTough meat might be a recurring theme with Mau's pho. My friend couldn't finish her bowl of Pho Bo, and so I got a chance to try that as well. Her eye-round and brisket were also pretty tough -- though not as much as chicken.\n\nOVERALL\nIt's a bit expensive for mediocre modern Vietnamese food.

Great with jasmine rice.\n\nFIVE-SPICE QUAIL (two steamed and crispy-fried quails, house marinade, watercress, house vinaigrette) -- this dish was quite large for an appetizer. The batter is light, not greasy. The house vinaigrette was perfect to act as an astringent to the fried quail.

I liked it and thought that it was quite unusual. But in general, I like lotus roots that are more cooked. it would be great to try this with crispy pig ears and cooked lotus roots.

Bun Cha Ha Noi - An alternative to the usual grilled pork vermicelli. If you love fish sauce, you'll love this dish.

Rice roll wrapper (like a banh cuon wrapper).

But after adding some lime and requesting more mum ruoc, the soup got the requisite level of seafood-y ness. Crab/tomalley was OK, served in meat-ball type form. \n- Bun bo hue: tasty, but same as above - tasted better after some lime and shrimp paste.

Hue roll was delicious and a new Vietnamese style dish I have ever tried before - my go-to is generally spring rolls but they insisted to give this a shot. Pho had broth exploding in flavor and good proportions of meat and noodles. Although I prefer only regular steak in my pho, the brisket was pretty good. I agree with some of the reviews that it's a bit pricey for Vietnamese food, but there is more to the restaurant than just the food. Fairly trendy layout and seems very clean, service was very friendly, and great selection of alcohol/cocktails. \n\nAlso, try out their specialized chili flakes if you like spicy food.\n\n4.5/5", "author": "Or R."}

I ride my bike past the place every day on my way home from work but there are so many new restaurants in the area I stopped keeping track. Even the ones with awesome word of mouth can take me ages to motivate to try - probably because it's in my neighborhood so I figure it's always there, plus it's always so crowded.\n\nI kinda assumed that any ethnic food along Valencia St was bound to be westernized - nothing unique and high prices - so I haven't been exploring those restaurants as much. And the ones I've tried haven't been impressive. However, 7x7's Big Eat 2014 had so many on the list I was like, alright, let's give it another try. \n\nStarting with the Mau and their lotus root salad ($11 - pig ear, shrimp, lotus root, carrots, celery, red bell pepper, onion, rau ram, mint, peanuts). The pig ear was the first sign that this may be interesting (in a good way). The lotus root salad should probably be called the pig ear salad because that's the predominant ingredient/texture. Lotus Root Salad probably sounds better. I also noticed that they have a freshwater eel salad - another good sign since both are yummy foods in Chinese cuisine that most people who didn't grow up with would squeal and wrinkle their noses at. Not that \"exotic\" ingredients are a sign of authenticity but because they aren't exotic at all in this cuisine and it's cool they have stuff my parents would love to eat instead of just chicken, beef and pork. Also, special of the day - grilled frog legs?\n\nOn a rainy Friday @ 1 pm it wasn't very crowded but I already planned on getting takeaway.\n \n *** Tip #1: order takeaway at the bar\n\n *** Tip #2: the lotus root salad is a pretty wet salad, best for eating in or if you take it to go, eat it very soon or maybe ask for a plastic container instead of waxed cardboard\n\nI took the salad with me to run some errands and half an hour later at home I found it had soaked through the bottom of the waxed cardboard container but thankfully not through the paper bag. The salad was a nice balance of sweet, salty and slightly spicy. I liked the chewiness of the pig ear. Bonus star just for having pigs ear.\n\nI'm very interested in going back to try the aforementioned eel salad and frog legs as well as the starters.\n\nSide Note/Rant: I would think that Vietnamese food is quite varied yet restaurants always have the same dishes on their menu. Why is that? I just can't get excited about yet another pho bowl.", "author": "Jean K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-11", "description": "Mau is located relatively close to my apartment in The Mission. I walked by it several times and noticed one day the chalkboard read \"Pho\" on it. I moved to SF a few months ago from Philadelphia where I regularly went out to traditional restaurants for a good bowl of pho to start the day (It's a great hangover cure). Finding a pho place so close to my new home I had to stop in and try it.\n\nFREQUENCY: I've dined at and ordered take out from this establishment one time each.\n\nFOOD: Both times I went to Mau I ordered the Bun Bo Hue. I'm a huge fan of spicier soups and this one looked like the spiciest bowl of noodles and soup on the menu. The pho contained beef shank, rare niman ranch eye-of-round, and pork sausage. The soup came out piping hot and was delicious. They also offered Sriracha sauce and BBQ sauce which I enjoy mixing together with a little sugar to make a great dipping sauce for the meats. The bowl was very filling and I was thoroughly satisfied. I plan on trying other bowl types in the future but haven't gotten around to it. When I ordered take out I was a little less impressed. I definitely suggest calling ahead to order pick up because ordering take out in the restaurant takes a long time. The staff has to switch between taking orders from the bar patrons and the line of take out patrons so it moves slowly. When I finally got home to enjoy my pho the meats weren't all thoroughly cooked. I had to cook several pieces before they were edible. Once everything was put together it was tasty. Though the downside is you miss out on the Sriracha and BBQ sauce. Honestly if you are considering dining at Mau just get a seat in the restaurant. That's my plan for the future.\n\nDRINK: Mau had a nice selection of alcoholic and fountain drinks. I ordered a beer to go with my soup and drank several glasses of water to balance out the spicy soup I was consuming. A good selection and about what I'd expect from a restaurant this size.\n\nATMOSPHERE: So if you are looking for a traditional Vietnamese pho restaurant I don't think this place is for you. Man makes me think of an Americanized pho restaurant. It's a very beautiful place with a nice layout and interesting artwork but that's not the type of atmosphere I'd expect from a traditional Vietnamese pho restaurant. The atmosphere is very good. I'm just trying to point out it has a very American feel, so if the traditional atmosphere is very important to you you may be a little put off, but if you're open to good pho in a cool atmosphere than you'll be just fine.\n\nSTAFF: When I dined at pho the staff was super friendly. I sat at the bar and the bartender was very conversational up until I was eating. I really like enjoying my food so I appreciate it when restaurant staff don't talk to me much while eating. When I ordered take out I didn't have much interaction with the staff besides taking my order, which was expected.\n\nPAYMENT: Credit cards or cash were acceptable.\n\nI really like this spot. Because of the proximity and the delicious soup and noodles I think Mau will become a regular stop for me in my food adventures. I don't recommend ordering out based off my one experience but dining in was fantastic. And if the traditional Vietnamese pho restaurant atmosphere isn't too important to you then I think you'll definitely enjoy it. Regardless I'd recommend that anyone living in the area or visiting stop in and try Mau at some point.", "author": "Christopher D."}

I would've been happy if it had turned out to be a full meal, as have been all prior clay pot dishes i've had (admittedly all Chinese; do Vietnamese serve only bits in clay pots, not full entrees?).  The preparation was actually excellent, & since i go to restaurants primarily for the food (though of course the atmosphere can also have a significant effect on the dining experience, if it's either wonderful or grating; this place was neither -- a but busy/noisy, but not bad enough that it spoiled the meal or made it impossible to talk, so for more trendy-type places, i'd say it was fine but didn't add to the pleasure of the dinner), it's the food that makes or breaks most places, for my evaluation.\n\nHere, while i found the preparation of the catfish both unique (something i always appreciate) & excellently prepared (tender, not under- or over-cooked; well executed generally), so i want to give Mau a high rating, the portion size was....odd.  By that i mean that the amount of fish was adequate ...or would have been if it had been accompanied by vegetables & such, as one (at least this one) normally expects from a meal.  Yet i left still hungry, since the actual pot in which it was served was MUCH smaller than clay pot dishes i've had in Chinese restaurants, & it was just the fish, no vegetables or anything else except some plain rice served with it.  I never thought to ask if there were anything but the fish in the clay pot; that just seemed so obvious.  Live & learn, i guess; but i have to deduct points for such a major lack in food preparation.\n\nSo while i'd definitely give Mau a higher rating if it were just the taste & preparation of the food i was rating, the lack of serving the full meal i'd normally get in a clay pot dish & the fact that the service was, to put it politely, \"minimalist\" (meaning that it was adequate, but the server seemed bored & just doing her job to get home as soon as possible; not sure she uttered a word the entire time we dealt with her, & certainly never cracked a smile or gave any sense of pleasantness), left me feeling i need to rate this place in the middle -- great in some ways, inadequate in others.

All bomb Vietnamese restaurants that I have been to are complete hole in the walls,I feel like it's some kind of universal rule or something. \n\nI was tricked into coming here by some friends and was pleasantly surprised. Yes - it's fancy, yes - it's clean, but yes - it's also extremely tasty. \n\nHere's what I had:\n- Bun Cha Ha Noi (Vermicelli w/ pork belly, sausage) - Super flavorful meats that go perfectly with chewy vermicelli noodles. They also have crazy good spicy dipping sauces that I could inhale by the spoonful. \n- Cha Gio (Crispy fried rolls) - Okay, let's be real this is your run of the mill imperial rolls, which always seem to hit the spot.\n- Banh Xeo (Vietnamese pancake w/ shrimp & other goodies) - My boo and I visited Vietnam last year and had the best Banh Xeos ever made by a woman who probably has been making them her entire life. Mau's banh xeos does not stack up but comes as a close second. They did a great job capturing the crispiness of the dish. \n\nI shamefully ate here twice in one week.

This summer I am teaching middle school students ethnic studies and gentrification. One of the things we do for fun however is go to local restaurants to try different types of food (we actually have been teaching a food diaspora from Africa (Ethiopian at Moy\u00e0 Who was awesome, came to talk to the kids and were incredibly accommodating), through Asia, eventually across the Bering straight to Food from the Americas). \n\nSo today we went to Mau for pho. They cannot sit ten kids in one spot so I tell them it's ok to sit three groups separately. They say ok except when they hear that students would be sharing and we would not be buying each student their own individual pho bowl they tell me it's something they cannot accommodate. Something about it just not being worth it considering the work involved and amount of smaller bowls used.\n\nNow these students, as well as this program, are not some Google funded dream. Still, however, they deserve the best from their community and their educational experience. Shame on y'all at Mau for not being willing to give these kids the experience; I understand you are a business but it is obvious that money talks and is more important than the experience of these underserved and underprivileged middle school children.\n\nIn the end we went to Thanh Tam 2 down the street who had been much more pleasant and friendly (not to mention delicious!). Needless to say I will not be giving Mau my business out of principle. In these times of extreme gentrification in the Mission I only stand with businesses who actually care about this community over profit.", "author": "Lawrence F."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-08", "description": "Growing up on Viet and especially Hue food, I'm always searching for the uncompromising real stuff and have usually been disappointed by SF's offerings. Mau however was pretty good. The food is fresh and flavorful. With a few tweaks it could be really great. \n\nLet me focus solely on the food. I'm judging from the standards of traditional Viet cooking. There are of course other standards but this seems most useful, because Yelp is generally awash with uninformed opinions about Viet and other ethnic minority foods. I would only ever write about food I know intimately.  \n\nB\u00fan b\u00f2 hue: 3.5 /5\n\nSome good things here: the beef shank is tender; noodles are thick with a good chew; the broth has the right whiff of fermented shrimp paste and a good kick to it. \n\nBut....   the broth, savory as it is, could be better. B\u00fan b\u00f2 is lemongrass beef soup; the lemongrass should be abundant, bracing and aromatic. But here it was subdued. The broth also needed some acidity to balance it; in Vietnam this usually involves some combination of lime, tamarind, and/or pineapple (which adds a sweet-tart with the added bonus of enzymes that tenderize the meat). Some of the toppings were also incorrect. Sliced eye round steak is for ph, not b\u00fan b\u00f2. Same with thai basil; its anise-like notes goes with the star anise in ph broth but not with b\u00fan b\u00f2. Also, you will not find b\u00fan b\u00f2 places in Vietnam serving lettuce as a garnish. The typical herbs include rau r\u0103m, red onions, and thinly sliced banana blossom. It's odd that they have banana blossom in one of their salads but don't serve it with their b\u00fan b\u00f2.   \n\nHue rolls: 4/5\n\nThe pork was flavorful and juicy; the herbs, greens, and rice noodle sheets were fresh. It would be even better if there were some lime and chilies in the fish sauce to balance out the overall flavor profile which was a little too one-note sweet. \n\nSo overall pretty good. I didn't try the pho here, which seems to be their most popular dish. I'm at heart a Hue boy, always chasing a good bowl of b\u00fan b\u00f2...", "author": "Long L."}

Extreme slow service and food was at most mediocre. \n\nWe ordered two salads to share among three of us: Lotus root salad and papaya salad. The chef definitely forgot to put lotus root into our lotus root salad.. I called a server over to ask which part of the salad was lotus root, and he just pointed to a bunch of celery and said they were lotus root.. Either they found a new kind of lotus that is super duper thin with super duper small holes and taste like celery, or they were just BSing. The papaya salad was alright. The flavor did not stand out though.\n\nThen two of us ordered beef pho (pho bo) and the other ordered the wonton noodle soup. I only had the beef pho and it was not great. The broth is very thin (you don't taste the glue-like texture of good beef bone broth) and does not have much flavor. Even adding the sauces did not help much. Also, they provided tiny lemon wedges instead of lime wedges in the pho garnishes, which was weird to me.\n\nWhat really tipped me off was the wait time for the food on a not-so-crowded Tuesday night. After ordering, our salad was served rather fast. It took us 20-30 mins to finish our salad. We were hoping to get the entrees right after the salad, however had to wait for more than 30 mins for the noodles after they took away our salad plates. Altogether, it took more than an hour to get our noodles after ordering, which was ridiculous for noodles with pre-made broth.\n\nGiving them one star for the portion size, and another star for the ambiance.", "author": "Christine C."}

The food was great, the service not so much. Our waiter missed one of our appetizer orders, and never returned to our table to check-in on us. We had to tell the busser our second app was missed when he came to clear the table, at which time it was too late given the main entree shortly followed.

They differ slightly from the traditional Vietnamese style, but the flavors are still there.\n\nI've tried:\n\n - Pho bo (beef noodle soup) - really good, tastes authentic. I recommend getting this.\n - Bun rieu (crab/shrimp tomato noodle soup) - Not very authentic, but flavors are there. Was also a bit too salty.\n - Bun thit nuong with imperial rolls \"noodle salad with marinated pork\" w/ fish sauce - also pretty good and tasted authentic. The meat and imperial rolls are served on a bed of cold rice noodles and lettuce, would've been better if the noodles were hot or at least warm.\n - Goi ga ( chicken cabbage salad appetizer) - non-conventional ingredients but tasted authentic. \n\nYou can expect Mau to be very busy during dinner on a weekday and lunch and dinner on a weekend. The wait is usually not too bad. My only problem with Mau is the lack of service when they are very busy... perhaps they are under staffed? During one of my many visits to this restaurant, my bf and I waited almost an hour for our noodle bowls to come out and our weekend lunch ended up taking almost 2 hours... The owners were really apologetic and kind, so we weren't angry about the lack of service, we were just kind of disappointed.\n\nDespite that negative experience, we did return and we do plan on eating here regularly in the future. It looks like the service is improving, so I'm quite happy about that.\n\nOverall, Mau is a great Vietnamese-fusion restaurant to grab a casual meal.

Don't go here. \n\nWe were abandoned by our waiter, given the wrong order, had our correct order come out with the wrong modifications (we asked for egg noodles and they gave us whatever the default is). We waited over an hour after ordering for our food in the end. Probably waited 15 minutes for water and 15 more minutes to order after that. The same thing happened to the table on our left, except they only got their food as we were leaving and they sat down before us. The table on our right was sympathic to our two tables so they offered to pass their hot sauce down the line of tables after three separate staff members ignored our request.\n\nThis isn't even the worst part though. They actually don't want to improve. When I brought up the service to the manager in the middle of the meal he found (they had never shown up) and then comped our spring rolls, which was fine. They were pretty bad spring rolls, but who cares. Then the meal got increasingly worse after that and I got up to relay the experience to him. I wasn't looking for a comp. I just wanted to provide feedback so he could have the information to remedy the systemic service issues. He said, \"We're busy. I don't know what you want me to do.\" I said, \"Don't you want to improve the service? This is probably the worst service I've ever experienced in a sitdown restaurant.\" He said, \"I comped your spring rolls. I don't know what you want from me. We're busy.\" So I said, \"Fine, if you have no interest in getting better or listening to customer feedback, that's cool. I'll get out of your way then.\" He then feigned chasing me down the restaurant and I asked him to please leave me alone. He had no interest in doing better in the future, just wanted to get rid of me as quickly as possible and probably attempt to avoid the bad review he knew was coming. He didn't comp anything else (but seriously that was not what I was after, I just think that fact is relevant to the review) and we still tipped 20% because this isn't our servers fault -- it's the restaurant itself. \n\nAlso, the food isn't even good. I didn't finish any of my dishes. They were bland! That's why I was asking essentially every staff member who walked by for hot sauce. Too bad no one ever gave it to me besides the table next to me.", "author": "Ellen C."}

I'm always looking for good and interesting restaurants, and trying to give well-distributed reviews, but this one gets a 5 for a mix of great service, fun casual atmosphere, great prices, a wonderful menu that makes me want to come back as soon as possible to try more things (especially the noodles, which I hear are great), and really really tasty food. There aren't a ton of vietnamese restaurants in the city (relative to many other cuisines...), and I've had mixed experiences at some of the others. I'm not particularly knowledgeable about vietnamese cuisine, so I can't speak to its authenticity, but what's important to me is that Mau creates a broad-yet-cohesive menu of delicious, well spiced, well-balanced, well-portioned dishes and meals, and provides them efficiently and consistently (this claim I'm taking from my friend who has been here regularly and says they're always as good as they were on our date).\n\nWe walked in at 6:30 and there was no wait, but by the time we left it was crowded with a decent number of people waiting, so get there a bit early if you're hungry.", "author": "Chris M."}

I scanned the menu posted by the door and decided to give it a try.  I got the vibe that they were going for a more down to earth Slanted Door which was perfectly OK with me.  I knew I was getting the Shaken Beef within seconds of glancing over the menu, having had it at that other waterfront place a few times and always enjoying it.  I sipped a tasty Mircobrew (of which I have completely forgotten the name) while passing the time before the meal came. \n\nThe dish arrived looking pretty simple.  A mountain of brown rice surrounded by cubes of tender beef with a cold salad of some sort.  I began nibbling away at the components separately and enjoying it.  I then decided to mix the whole dish together and eat it at once and it went from being a great dish to being an excellent dish.  The contrasts of the hot rice and cold salad worked great with the succulent beef.  I devoured that plate without even thinking about anything but the fabulous meal in front of me.  \n\nSo why only four stars?\n\nAfter the plate was licked clean the wait began for the check to arrive.  The place had unexpectedly filled to capacity and both servers were severely overwhelmed by the influx of hungry guests.  After about ten minutes I placed my card at the edge of the table and expected the waiter to take the hint that I was ready to go.  But no.  It took at least another ten minutes after that for the check to arrive.  \n\nThis place easily would receive that fifth star had they not been so understaffed.

Meh is a good description. \n\nEarlier in the day, I was at Costco and had a sampling of their pho soup, which got my craving starting. Have to say, Costco beats Mau hands down on their pho. Not to mention every single hole-in-the-wall-$4-a-bowl pho place around. I really didn't care for the pho at all. It lack that indescribable but very fundamental broth flavor that makes pho, pho.\n\nMy husband that the clay pot, which he poured hot sauce into.

Not typical traditional but definitely California inspired Vietnamese.  Also had their imperial rolls (cha gio) which were good although not enough lettuce to make wraps.  \n\nSecond time got their hue rolls which was good although the rice wrap could've been less rubbery or thinner.  Also had a variety of rice plates to share.  Including the $16(!) shaken beef which came in tiny cubes mixed with bell peppers and tomatoes and other veggies.  The portion of meat for the price was extremely disappointing and the meat was a bit salty and not extremely tender (especially for a 'tenderloin') as other shaken beef I've had.  The waiter also couldn't answer what the greens were and made us wait until the end of the meal to ask the kitchen what it was (even though it's written on any menu). In contrast, the lemongrass chicken ($9) was plentiful on meat.  The gulf prawn claypot was easily the worst dish I've had in a while, where the broth it was cooked in tasted like one of those slightly off clams that you always dread to get.  \n\nIt's a pity that my second visit was so disappointing.

I don't mind paying $8-9 for a banh mi but I expect it to rock my world and unfortunately Mau's version did not.  The sardine sandwich was nice worthy of 3 stars but the sausage banh mi was a snooze.  \nPortions were small and for $4-6 bucks, I can get a great banh mi sandwich in tons of banh mi joints in San Francisco. \n\nMost disappointing was dinner.

I had 5 little pieces of pork with regular steamed rice, some lettuce, and a few pickles for $15 bucks!  Really?? \n\nPork Shop to Share $25- 3 Stars - the pork chop was a nice meaty portion and cooked well but slightly on the undercooked side but I'm ok with that.  The pork chop was served with a scoop of white rice and some pickles.  The chop was juicy which was enjoyable but lacking flavor and at $25, I didn't think it was worth it.  C'mon guys $25 is a lot of money - put some effort into this dish.  Just grilling a good chop is not enough to justify asking for $25 buckaroos. \n\nWok Fried Greens - no flavor, oily.  \n\nBeef Salad - $10 - 2 stars.  Salty, missing acid.  Just not worth it. \n\nSausage - $8 - 2 stars.  The sausage lacked flavor and the nuoc cham sauce does not taste very good and that is a huge problem considering that this is served like a wrap with lettuce and herbs.  Anyone that knows Vietnamese cuisine knows that the nuoc cham sauce is ultra important to the dish- it can make or break a Vietnamese dish and in this case, it failed.  \n\nIce Cream Sundae $8 - 1 star.  This is scoops of ice cream from Bi-Rite served with coconut toppings and peanuts.  This is disappointing because if you only have 1 dessert, make it great and special.

I think they lack authenticity because they try to be too different. Usually they plate food nicely, charge you double, and the food doesn't justify the price.\nI wouldn't find myself picking a trendy viet restaurant but was invited here for a birthday. To my surprise, the food was actually decent. My favorite was the banana blossom salad. I want more as I'm typing this review. The nuoc mam (fish sauce) in it was point on. Most trendy restaurants water down their fish sauce. I think it's to cater to everyone? Highly recommend their salads since their nuoc mam is really good.\nWe also tried pho ga, bun bo hue, shaking beef, banh mi, claypot catfish, garlic noodles, and cha gio.\nEverything was decent. I would order the cha gio and claypot catfish again. \nCha gio (viet eggrolls) is usually made with ground pork, mushrooms, glass noodles, and taro. The taro will give it a little mushier texture inside. They were light, crispy, and the portion was decent. Nuoc mam, again, to dip was on point. \nIf you're looking for something jam packed with flavor, try the claypot catfish. It can be a little overwhelming for some but good with rice. \nBbh was decent. Flavor was there. It lacked spice so I asked for more chili sate sauce to give it more of a kick.\nIt's worth a try, but I rather spend on the average viet restaurant in San Jose.", "author": "Linda P."}

When we first arrived we mentioned to the hostess that we had theater plans at the Marsh so someone came by immediately to bring us the menu. \n\nWe had a chance to carefully look over the menu but we waited quite a bit  for a server  to take our order.   At that time, the restaurant was not full yet, we arrived before the full dinner crowd.  We politely reminded the hostess that we needed to catch a show, can she please send a server back to our table?  When our server arrived he came with a scowl on his face, angry that he had to take our orders.  It really took us aback - his attitude was really funky.  It's one thing if the service is slow but it's another when you feel like you're definitely not welcomed.  \n\nWhen we asked for containers for the leftovers, they put the noodles from the pho in a cardbox box container, not a plastic tub for the soups and inevitably the container melted away in a soggy mess.\n\nI enjoyed the food but the experience and service is what I'll remember. Typically, I never give negative feedback about places.  I'd rather share great services/businesses with others instead.  In this case, I thought the restaurant should be aware of what's happening with their diners.  Nicer, more experienced servers could make all the difference.", "author": "June O."}

I don't know if I'm being picky but maybe growing up near the town with the largest Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam justifies it. Bun cha gio is the perfect combination of textures--soft vermicelli noodles, crisp bean sprouts, refreshing cucumber and mint, lightly saut\u00e9ed green onions, crushed roasted peanuts and lastly, fried egg rolls. This dish had all that (plus an extra plate of herbs requested) but something was off. Maybe it was the fact that the server couldn't pronounce the dish correctly--but neither can I.

The host ignored me and my family for several minutes (which is quite a feat with a toddler and 5-year old) while we waited patiently next to the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign. We were finally acknowledged, then sat down at our table, where we waited about 15 minutes for our order to be taken, despite my numerous attempt to catch the eye of our server. We at last ordered, and received our spring roll appetizer. It tasted fine, about what you would expect from any hole-in-the-wall place, and when we got 2/3 done, I noticed a hair. I tried to brush it off, thinking it might have been one of my eyelashes, but no, it was very long and completely woven into the noodles of the roll. I sent back the remains after telling them what had happened, and they didn't seem too concerned about it. Then, my husband and girls received their lunches, and mine was nowhere in sight. I waited for 10 minutes, nothing. I finally flagged down the server to ask about it, and he seemed confused, and says he'd inquire in the kitchen. Five minutes later, still nothing. Finally, I gave up, and asked for the check. My meal wasn't on the receipt, so I just decided to cut my losses and leave without my meal. \n\nTo say the least, the whole experience was infuriating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-04-19", "description": "They're trying. And, I'm nice. \n\nHere's the story. We didn't have tons of time but we had an hour to have lunch before Ian needed to head out for SFO. Plenty of time, right? Especially for lunch at 1:45, when any sort of lunch crowd would have passed, yes? But, not quite. \n\nIt all started okay. We were seated quickly, and given menus and water promptly. But, then it took ten minutes for our waitress to come, even after the bus boy said he'd send her over. We considered walking out. She was friendly, thanked us for waiting, took our order (bun rieu for me, tofu bun and Vietnamese-style limeade for him, and veggie hue rolls for us), brought out the limeade (which was too sweet, with undissolved sugar crystals hanging out at the bottom of the glass and lacking all tartness), then we waited. And waited. \n\nI looked at my watch: 2:15. Nothing. We thought about leaving again. Other people who were seated after us had their food brought out to them. I must have made a face because our waitress then came over to apologize that our appetizers (the hue rolls) were brought to another table. She'd bring over a new plate immediately and take it off our bill. No problem but we're in a rush, we told her. We had a flight to catch. Okay, she'd bring our bill. \n\nThe hue rolls came out instantaneously, and they were good. The steamed rice wrapper was chewy in a good way. The lettuce added a light crunch. The sauce that came with it was not overwhelming like some fish sauces can be. And, that chile sauce with the chile flakes in it (which we had to ask for) is spicy, numbs your lips spicy, even for me, the girl who grew up with the Sriracha founders as her neighbors -- so, watch out, you just need a little. But, I think it what really made the dish was the shiso. Love shiso. \n\nAnd, the waitress brought our bill, with the hue rolls removed from the tab. Great. \n\nThen we waited some more. Our plates were taken away. Our waters will filled. We waited. We considered leaving again, but we needed to eat and, really, how much longer could it be? I was getting antsy. The busboy's movements (his clanging of the dishes), the dance club bass beats of the background (rather, foreground) music, watching all our dining neighbors eating their bowls of noodles (possibly our noodles), the fact that it was approaching 2:30 and our meals were still not in front of us, all of it made me anxious. \n\nA man (not sure who he was, as he wasn't a waiter nor the busboy, perhaps the owner?) took our credit card. \"Excuse us, our food hasn't come yet. We're in a rush -- we have a flight to get on -- so we wanted our check early. But, we've been waiting for nearly forty minutes.\" \"Forty minutes?\" He seemed embarrassed and was really apologetic. He said he'd see what was going on. He came back a minute later and apologized: they have a new busboy, who was trying to help out but brought our dishes to other people instead. \"But, he brought our hue rolls to someone else too.\" \"Oh, you were that table. I'm so sorry. This is the fifth time he's done that this week. I'll get your food out right now and take it off your bill. And, I'll check in with you guys to make sure everything's okay.\" \n\nAnd, all that happened. Our noodles came out two minutes later. The man gave us a bill for $0. Our waitress came over, apologized, and offered us another limeade, which we declined. The man asked if we needed anything, more limes maybe? The man gave us napkins, which we didn't ask for or need but I do like having extra napkins. The man offered us more limeade -- on the house -- which we still said no to. He was trying. \n\nAs for our noodles, they were pretty delicious. Sure, Ian's bun bowl with tofu and shitakes isn't like anything you'll find on Larkin Street but it was flavorful and filling, with plenty of tofu and veggies (though he did say that my lemongrass tofu is better). And, yeah, I'd choose to eat my mom's bun rieu over Mau's any day. But, if I'm feeling a craving for home, I'd totally eat that bowl of bun rieu again. \n\nSo, in summary, the food (at least what we ordered) is good. As the daughter of Chinese/Vietnamese immigrant parents, I'd eat here again. I wouldn't take my parents here of course, as they would say it's too expensive (maybe a few dollars more than what you'd find at a hole-the-wall, green-chopsticks-on-the-table sorta Vietnamese joint, but not expensive either) and my mom can make all this food herself and do it well, but I'd eat here with friends. \n\nAs for the service, they're trying. If the staff wasn't so genuinely apologetic to us and if we hadn't had our meal comped, I would be irate; I'd never go there again. But, they realized their mistakes, they apologized, and they tried to make up for it -- I can respect that. \n\nSo, three stars for food quality. And, an initial one star for having delivered all our food to other people and being slow plus the five stars of trying to make up for it, averages out to 3 stars for service.", "author": "Susan T."}

We arrived open minded, eager to spend a rare evening out (without our offspring) at a restaurant I expected so much to enjoy.  \n\nHere's a summary of our experience:  \n- BEYOND salty fish clay pot that we had to regrettfully return to the kitchen.  And I'm a person who loves salt-laden food but this was truely unedible.  They graciously replaced the dish with the shrimp claypot, but that was also MSG-infused heart attack inducing salty.\n\n- overcooked mushy garlic noodles that stuck to oneanther like gnocchi.  \n\nThere were however two decent entrees.  The deep fried eggrolls (CHA GIO*) were decent, but weren't served with enough condiments to wrap up (lettuce, carrots, vermacelli) and dip into the savory sauce.  And the Shaken beef (which was cooked perfectly) but the meat itself was tough, had to chew it to a whilte to masticate it enough to swallow.  \n\nThe restaurant was packed.  So much so that I felt included on all the conversations of tables surrounding us -- definitely not a place to have intimate discussions.  I left knowing a bit more about java-script thanks to our neighboring eaters on the right and experienced a first date due to our neighbors on the left.  \n\nWe didn't eat any of the soups, but after this original experience, I wouldn't give them the doubt and go back.", "author": "dave g."}

The restaurant was beautiful, but the service was lacking. I came in at noon on my lunch break solo. It took them probably 3 to 4 minutes to seat me in a mostly empty restaurant. The prices were higher than I'm used to, but being in SF that's to be expected. I ordered the Pho Bo. It took 25 minutes before I got my bowl of pho. So between waiting to be seated and and getting my food took half my lunch break, which if they were busy I could understand, but let me reiterate that the restaurant was mostly empty with staff out numbering customers. Finally my pho arrives and I have high hopes. But upon the first bite I was disappointed. The broth was bland, the amount of noodles and meat were very underwhelming.

One of the staff apparently told our neighboring table they were short today because someone had called out sick, but after reading other reviews here from the last couple of months, it sounds like this is not an unusual problem for them. It took 10 minutes for someone to come take our order, us hassling the busboy to get our appetizer another 15 minutes later (turns out he'd brought it out earlier and couldn't figure out who to bring it to; I think that was after he tried to bring us someone else's food). He eventually brought us our food too but we had to remind him we'd ordered drinks; turns out they'd been sitting at the bar for who knows how long.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2013-01-05", "description": "So this should be 2.5 stars but half stars aren't possible here.\n\nThis restaurant  needs help.  We ordered the quail appetizer based on our waiter's recommendation that it was an awesome dish. We ordered 2 for $12 as there were 2 of us and quails are notoriously tiny a delicate and tender meat.  What came out was 4 half pieces of quail  on top of a bed of watercress (or some similar green).  The quail was chopped in 2 and fried... and it was crispy, a bit charred (not burnt but seriously well done) and chewy similar to beef jerky in spots.  I was amazed when it came to the table that it was even served to us, it was obvious when it arrived that it was overdone.   I did give it  a chance and ate the first half. I couldn't taste any of the five spice that it was supposed to be flavored with bits of the charred skin flaked off and got all over the table.   At the second half (which was more meaty)  I decided to try and hunt for the succulent juicy meat that  I associate with quail.. The uncrispy meat literally could be fanned out ... dry and pointy.  In short .. if I served chicken wings to my guest that were this overdone I would be ashamed, it was probably the worst cooked quail I have ever had... and I do enjoy quail when it is done right.  If this were my first introduction to quail I would never order it again.\n\nTo make matters worse when our waiter (or busboy) came by to collect our appetizer dishes.. and my uneaten quail remained on the dish I mentioned that it was really overdone and I got a \"thank you\" in reply.    \n\nI did have a lovely light colored beer SpeakEasy The Witness (on tap) to wash down the appetizer.  The watercress was decent although one of those difficult items to serve and eat with chopsticks due to the long stems and small leaves.   \n\nFor dinner we each ordered the clay pot.  My friend got the fish $10 and I got the gulf prawns $14.   I'm not quite sure what I was expecting after hearing the waiter tell another table that the prawns were much more flavorful than the fish and he would recommend that dish over the fish by far.   \n\nWhat I received was 5 prawns iin the bottom of a clay pot with some sauce and spices.  I really think it was 5 shrimp (not prawns) .. they were about 2.5 inches (including the tail) and if they had  been straightened out might have been 3 inches from end to end. They weren't even particularly large for shrimp.  After the quail fiasco, I was really hoping they weren't overcooked.   The prawns were \"edible\"  not quite completely rubbery  but slightly overdone and a bit more chewy than you expect them to be served at your restaurant table.   It was kind of like the way prawns feel after you take them home and reheat them in the microwave the second night.\n\nAlong with my 5 prawns (that would easily fit in the palm of my hand)  came a bowl of rice on the side and a small dish with some bean sproutsetc.    Our chopsticks had been removed from the table with the appetizers and we each received a Chinese style ceramic soup ladle spoon for mixing and eating our dishes.   My friend's fish dish was pretty similar although her fish actually covered the bottom of her clay pot (the clay bowl was about 5 or 6 inches in diameter).  When she added her rice and her sprouts the bowl  had rice about an inch over the rim and she still had rice in the bowl.  When I added  my rice my rice sat about a half inch or more below the rim of my clay bowl.  My dish was actually pretty tasty, but I really don't think 5 average sized slightly overcooked shrimp and rice are worth the $14 price tag when the fish dish provides so much more food.  \n\nThey did bring out the house made siricha when we requested it and some lemongrass pickled hot spice.  Both of the house made condiments were quite tasty. We did have to request a spoon to go with the condiments.  Except for the shrimp portion of my dish I would give it a decent rating and even with the over cooked shrimp it was probably worth of a 3 out of 5 ... although not good enough for me to want to go back and try another dish. \n\nThe meal came to $50 total for 2 .. (a beer, a tea, an appetizer, and 2 clay pots) which I think was rather pricey for what we got although not a price to complain about. \n\nAs for the service it was interesting.   I was sitting against the wall and observing the other diners.  Dishes often came out and the servers weren't quite sure where to serve them .. we were nearly served the entrees for the table of 3 - 2 table down from us.  A table of gentleman on the other side of us were served an entree that they did not order - a bowl of pho rather than a plate of meat. By the time his correct plate arrived his companions were nearly finished with their meals.   Our meals were served correctly.   Although I found myself lacking in water at points in the meal,  I always had some liquid available to drink.  \n\nHopefully the service and cooking improve.

The fantastic aroma of lemongrass is what got me to notice this restaurant, while walking by. Later the same week brought my girlfriend for dinner. We were seated immediately about half way back in their large-ish dining room. One notices immediately how many staff persons there are, and that there are a good number of tables. I'd describe the dining room as casually chic. \nI ordered the Bo Kho, or braised shank pho, with brisket, carrot and basil. The broth was meaty and rich, spiced but not spicy, and opted for the egg noodles though a baguette is also an option on the menu and likely goes well for soaking up. I was pleased to see that two varieties of saison are listed, and chose the honey saison. Also ordered the sauteed vegetable of the day, which happened to be bok choy, scissored into bite-sized bits and drizzled with sesame oil. My girlfriend ordered the Pho Bo, which seemed a more traditional type of pho, with thinly-sliced brisket. Her only complaint was that her broth wasn't scalding hot, the way she appreciates. \nWe managed to get out of there having spent about fifty bucks, which is pleasing by comparison to most other places currently situated on the Valencia corridor. \nWill absolutely return for another go.", "author": "Brian G."}

So, I share my boyfriend's meal waiting for my food. His noodle dish was bland and unexciting. By the time my food comes out, I ask for it to be packed immediately and for the check.

Both of our tables placed orders only after I insisted that someone take our orders.  It gets worse.  While waiting for our food, a cockroach is crawling next to me on the bench I was seated at.

I want to go back and try more of the offerings on the menu -- I'd go back just for the Hue Rolls as a starter. It was grilled pork with mint wrapped in a rice noodle roll with a yummy dlpping sauce, and all the flavors together were fresh, tart and savory all at once. We also had the shrimp clay pot.The flavors were chili and sweet. The rice was served on the side so I mixed everything up in the clay pot.  It was different than what I'm used to at the Vietnamese restaurants in Oakland where everything is baked together in the clay pot and the rice gets crunchy. But delicious still. We also ordered the sauteed greens, which was bok choi last night. I have never had bok choi made so tender and seasoned perfectly with salt and pepper. It was easy and delightful to eat and I would go back for that also. My friend had lemongrass chicken and she loved it too. We loved the housemade Sriracha which had a certain brightness to it.\n\nThe service was fast and friendly. The atmosphere and furnishings were comfortable and I was told they were all hand-made out of repurposed wood.\n\nThis is definitely the trendy Mission's version of Vietnamese. But Chef Kai, who is herself Vietnamese, has put together some typical dishes and all the flavors merge well together and have flare and freshness. Also I thought the pricing was really good compared to the new Mission restaurant scene. Can't wait to go back and try the Bun!", "author": "Nadia K."}

The service was good - super nice waiter who apologized for not being able to pronounce everything on the menu authentically and they didn't blink an eye when our 20 month old made a huge mess and made himself very at home here.  I know people are commenting on how overpriced they felt it was - we found it reasonable ... $30 for two (and a half of us) and we had full tummies.  Our other Vietnamese go-to in the neighborhood (Thanh Tam II) is slightly cheaper but the people in there often seem grumpy and the tv is always on.
