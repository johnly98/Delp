The line was long a great sign!  so I tied Winston up to a bike pole next to a Yorkie and got in the queue.\n\nLots of delicious choices. I got shrimp spring rolls and a shrimp chive thing that looked like a samosa or an empanada. Apparently filled with onion chives shrimp and ginger. \nThe spring roll I woofed in route to Hayes Valley. Upon securing my Iced coffee at BB, Winston and I chilled while I ate the Chinese empanada. Oh snap! of course I brought dog treats and agua for Sir Winston. Otherwise I could not focus on that very satisfying treat. Those big brown eyes ever alert for a \"damn you are so freaking cute sympathy snack\". Sorry I don't remember the name, and no Winston did not get any. \nMy new fav! \nThis is the spot man!

I have only lived in the bay for 3 months and I have been here...4 times now? While fitting in all the other new places I've tried, consider me impressed with myself.\n\nLocated in Inner Richmond (which is absolutely the best area to get Chinese and Vietnamese food) - don't waste your time in Downtowns Chinatown if you want something authentic that is also reasonably priced. The restaurant has many of their buns and pancakes already made and in the glass cases as you walk in. Most of their dumplings are made to order so they will take a few minutes to cook. Do not be fooled by the labels on the glass cases! They do not match the food sitting behind them. Order what you want based on the menu and don't expect it to look how you think it will, just know that it will be delicious!\n\nThings I suggest you try:\n1. Pork or beef pan fried bao (comes with 3)\n2. Beef or green onion pancake (comes with 1 large pancake)\n3. Potstickers (comes with 6)\n4. Chili pork dumplings - spicy (comes with 10)** so good\n5. Xiao Long bao (comes with 6)\n\nHonestly, anything you order will be good. I have tried a few other things on the menu that were good but they needed some extra flavor with soy sauce or hot sauce, which is why they did not make my top 5 list. Everything above is amazing on its own. If you want to take your food to go they give it to you that way already, but there are also tables in the back of the restaurant for you to sit in should you want to stay! \n\nThe woman at the front desk is a little demanding in wanting you to order quickly so you can feel a little pressure, so I recommend knowing what you want in advance if you can. Don't let her pressure you so much that you forget to order something!! She just wants the line to go quickly as it's usually out the door.", "author": "Bri T."}

They're melt-in-your-mouth delicious. \n\nAnd, you might agree Xiao Long Bao's baked BBQ pork buns are some of the best in the city: Filled with saucy, delicious BBQ pork, they're a warm and filling meal unto themselves. \n\nWhile I wait for my order of wonton soup, I watch the hard-working women toggle between their sister restaurant Clement BBQ two doors down, bringing over spring rolls or a miniature loaf of butter cake to complete a customer's order.\n\nBefore everything is readied to go, I glance over to the storefront counter and watch dumplings being methodically rolled out, filled, folded and pinched; it's a slice of San Francisco and it tastes delicious.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

For sure I'm going to be coming here regularly. I don't know of any other dim sum spot in the city you can easily order XLBs or Pan Fried Baos (Shenjianbaos) fast-food style. I've been having an itching for Shanghainese style dumplings lately but would rather not deal with ordering from a restaurant. I just want quick and affordable Shanghai dumplings to go. \n\nSo far I've tried their XLBs, fried pork buns, the pan fried chive and shrimp dumpling that looks like a potsticker, and taro and egg yolk buns. My favorite so far has to be the Pan Fried Chive & Shrimp dumpling, Pan Fried pork/beef buns, and the Taro paste bun and Egg yolk bun.  I was pleasantly surprised the distinct taste of the taro bun as it tastes like I'm biting into a fresh taro plant. The XLBs which this shop is named after was just okay though and you can probably find better ones at Shaghai restaurants. \n\nI have to mention my main and probably only gripe with this place is the extremely rude customer service and when I say this place, I mean one particular nasty worker who makes it her mission to give you the worst customer service possible. Every time I have come here I had the misfortune of having to deal with her. She makes you question whether you really should be patronizing this place as you have probably never felt more unwelcome in your life until you order from here. She is absolutely bitter, impatient, doesn't understand much english nor does she even try to communicate with you. This leads to misunderstandings and sometimes I suspect she may be changing the prices as she pleases as I'm not even informed of the price of one item. \n\nTo make matters worst I think her only job function is manning the registers which makes it taxing and a grueling experience to make a order here. It feels as if applying for a coveted position to access delicious dim sum but you have to go through a hazing process of ridicule, slander, and constant sneering from this lady to be worthy of tasting delicious baos you can't get elsewhere. Hey I'll probably see this as a growing process to help me finally develop thicker skin. You should have this mentality as well cause when your dealing with 1000 joules of negative energy emanating from her you better find it humorous or else you'll be swept up by dark forces. \n\nIn summary this place is a good dim sum addition where you can get specific types of dim sum you can't get elsewhere. Its savory good and affordable.", "author": "Jude N."}

You can use a credit card to pay if the total is over $10, but given how cheap everything is, you would be ordering a lot of food just to meet the minimum!! \n\nI loved how convenient and cheap this shop is and the food was pretty decent too. It was like paying grocery mart prices for cooked food :) I didn't try their xiao long baos but i did order a few things since I don't carry much cash around anymore: \n\n- pork and vegetable baos: these are pretty standard and I would say the ones here are about what'd you'd expect. Nothing fancy, but still tasty \n- sesame ball: these are good when hot! They're pretty big. I wasn't a huge fan but I'm also trying to limit my fried foods intake \n- Lou Sa Bao: dessert baos with sweet yolk stuffings. I couldn't eat anymore so I took them home and reheated them later. They were still good reheated! Lou Sa Bao are literally suppose to ooze out when you bite into them. They didn't ooze after the reheating but I still enjoyed them. \n- preserved egg with pork porridge: they will give you a huge serving for $3! \n\nI probably bought a whole day's worth of food for $11- unheard of in this insanely expensive city. \n\nTip: to reheat your baos, you'll want to steam them.

Ah yes, that's what I was expecting here but no, it was still as a tomb with the dim sum stored away on trays in warming ovens (photo: http://bit.ly/2lmGj8A). I'm guessing the lack of turnover contributes to the lack of freshness in the dumpling department. The staff didn't look terribly busy as the kitchen was quiet with rags left around the trays covered in plastic (photo: http://bit.ly/2ltlhlz).\n\nDespite the warning signs, I still gave it a try just picking things off a worn pink menu taped precariously to one of the ovens. Why? They were cheap and so am I, a match made in heaven. I ordered a trio of the Shrimp & Pork Siu Mai for $2.25 (photo: http://bit.ly/2ltkGjR). Lukewarm but OK for what they were. The same price applied to the three Cha Xiao Bao (BBQ Pork Bun) which were just too bready for me and rather arid in flavor, even the pork inside. The biggest disappointment was the one I never tried before, the Coconut Juice Bun, at the same price for three (photo: http://bit.ly/2ltkRM1).

The two beef dishes were very flavorless and bland and not very good at all.  Red oil wontons, which I've ordered in the past also tasted really bland this time.  The shanghai dumplings are ok, but even though they come in individual foil pieces, the skin was all broken and the meat tasted super fatty (maybe too much so).  Anyway, this was overall, a not very good meal.\n\nSo, I recommend with reservation.  I think the green onion pancake and shrimp dumplings are both good, but use caution for other dishes.  \n\nAnd for those of you who are less conditioned to less clean establishments, brace yourselves or skip.", "author": "Howard T."}

Not just on a meal which I could simply get by ordering take-away, but for an entire dining experience.  I'm paying for everything from the food, to the presentation, to the ambiance, to the service, and I also expect a clean bathroom for my $100 that I'm going to spend.  Why should I spend my money with your establishment?  What incentive do you offer?  Because you're not doing me any favors by allowing me to dine at your restaurant.  I could eat at any of the thousands of places in The City.  Why your's?  \n\nIn the world of Chinese Restaurants, you expect shortcomings.  After all, you're not paying much, so you expect a lot less.  Rude staff.  Bad service.  Dirty bathrooms.  A piece of food handed to you with a piece of wax paper.  Hair in your food.  Roaches.  Fruit flies.  \n\nI can remember Silver Restaurant in Chinatown, open 24 hours with no pest control.  Rats literally ran amok in the dining room.  But nobody cared because you were drunk from club-hopping, and you could ask for \"cold tea\" and have beer in your teapot.  \n\nThis is by far, the worst place I've ever been to.  \n\nThe illusion is crafted by the exhibition prep in the front window.  They want you to see that they are crafting their own food products.  The allure of handmade as opposed to reheated from frozen.  The promise of freshness.  Real food, unmolested by periodic table of elements ingredients such as MSG.  \n\nOptical illusion.  Smoke & mirrors.  No guarantee that anything is being made right, just because you see it being made.  Doughy dumpling skins that suffer from too much starch or the wrong blend of flour, lye water, or any other mishandled ingredient changes the experience.  Seasoning could still be off.  Even dirty oil, at the wrong temperature, could make for really bad food.  And under steaming or oversteaming can happen despite the exhibition kitchen.\n\nWalk in.  No response from the people at the counter.  They didn't even look at me.  I sit down.  They know I'm sitting there.  Nothing happens. 15 minutes elapse.  I go to the counter and ask for menus.  The clerk refused.  The clerk said that I can get in line and order at the counter.  Actually, the clerk was yelling and using profanity.  Should I also mention that I was with a disabled person, and that the verbal barrage was mainly directed at the person's disability?  How does that fall within The Americans With Disabilities Act?  It's not often that a total stranger offends to the point where I will throw punches.  In this case, I was ready to throw a spinning back kick.  They would have had to run down to the corner to get Master Tat Mau Wong to save her.\n\nWhat kind of restaurant refuses to serve guest seated at a table?\n\nThe 1 Star Rating is for the restaurant.  If you're paying attention, I have yet to try the food.  At this point, the food does not matter.  They could be serving gold dipped foreskin from virgin sacrifices.  Even if I did get to try the food, and it was spectacular, I would never go back to a place which allows employees to treat customer so poorly.  \n\nI might go back, at closing time, to give the owner an asskicking for employing such dreadful people.

It serves the mecca of Chinese comfort foods. All praise soup dumplings (xiao long bao). Xiao long bao are my religion, and this place gives them to you in carry out boxes with quantities as large as your little heart could desire. Even more important, they each come in their own tin, like tiny muffins. \n\nI know San Francisco is the land of tech, and full of innovation, but I'm convinced that this little tin that prevents you from losing your soup is the greatest invention I've ever encountered.

Those are basically just little sad pork blobs with dough husks. Those make no one happy.\n\nThey're not the best xiao long bao I've ever had, but the price to quality ratio is on point. Dirt cheap. If that doesn't convince you, this place also has flat little turnip cakes--if you don't normally like turnips, think again, I also normally think turnips are disgusting--as well as the transparent skinned shrimp dumpling, and the delicious dessert sesame balls (filled with black sesame filling). And their soups are everything I could want in food, maybe in love, maybe even in life itself. The noodles are yellow and cooked in the biggest pot I've ever seen that always seems to be overflowing with scalding water and steam.

It's a small clean restaurant with a few tables for four. We ordered in so we waited a little while for  the food to be brought to us. The wonton noodle soup was pretty good. The wonton was filled with lots of shrimp and there were 5 of them. The noodles also come with bok choy. It is relatively cheap since it's only 4.50, but it also pretty small. Have you ever had a kimchi ramen bowl? It comes in a disposable bowl about that size. But it is a good snack. The roasted duck wonton noodles was really good too. Same size bowl. Same amount of wonton with a generous amount of roasted duck. This is pricier about 6.50? Or so? But understandable since duck isn't cheap these days.\n\nI think the xiao long bao was the most disappointing. It came out in a plastic to go container. I love that each xiao long bao came in a small foil cup so that we don't lose our soup. But I was disappointed that it wasn't hot. The xiao long bao was the one we waited the longest for and yet, it was cold. I felt that since this store is named after these xiao long bao, shouldn't this be the best item on the menu?\n\nThey also sell their chili sauce.

Also includes a few pieces of bok choy.\n\nBraised Beef Stew Ramen: Parents shared this. Same as above comments.\n\nShrimp Rice Noodle Roll: Pretty good. Sometimes the shrimp in some of the dim places have weird after tastes, but this one tasted fresh.\n\nShrimp and Pork Sui Mai: Probably my favorite. It's a bit different from dim sum places. It's not mushroom flavor! It has more of a pork flavor. They're pretty big too compared to most dim sum places. (Still love Good Luck Dim Sum)\n\nTurnip Cake: Dessert. I ate half of one. Nice and flaky. Not my cup of tea, but my mom said not a lot places sell it. She liked it. \n\nSweet Soy: Not too sweet. They put it in a coffee cup. I enjoyed it. \n\nA couple of tips:\n- They have a few tables inside if you want to eat inside the place. \n\n- It's not a table service restaurant! You order / pay first and then take your food to an available table. On a few items like the noodle soup dishes, the lady will ask if you will be eating it here.\n\n- I'd suggest eating your food there. I was there around 12:30 p.m. on Monday and was able to get a table of four easily. Maybe other days it's more crowded?

Maybe not as good as Good Luck's, but still great.\n- BBQ pork buns - small in size but great texture, actual pieces of pork not just gelatinous goo. I like the flavor and amount of sauce they use too.\n- Curry chicken buns - unique item, very yummy\n\nThe pancakes are also good but not something I get everytime. Very filling and you get a lot for the $. Plenty of other good things to choose from but I seem to always go back to my favorite items. As others have noted, the soup dumplings aren't really the best thing they offer, so their name is a bit misleading.\n\nI'd recommend taking out if you can. They have some tables but the ambiance is nothing to write home about. Food quality is great though!", "author": "Remi X."}

I have an undying love for dumplings and noodles so you can imagine the excitement I had when a restaurant exists that sells dumplings at a more convenient rate. \n\nI skimmed through the menu and it listed dumplings, baos, pancakes, pancake wraps, potstickers, won ton noodles, and even soy milk! \n\nI waited in line and ended up ordering the staple XLB ($3.50 for 6). I saw other people waiting too and thought I would have to endure a 10 minute wait, but luckily for me, they are larger orders and the XLBs were already steamed and ready for take out. There's also a few tables and chairs in the back but I mostly wanted to get home and indulge! \n\nI finally tried the dumplings and though they were less than I expected, I have high hopes for this place!

That said, you can't really recook dumplings, as the texture changes. I think though, since we went during the lunch hour, things were still fairly fresh, so I can't really complain. I just wonder how it would have tasted if it were cooked to order instead. \nThat aside, good Xiao Long Bao is supposed to have the thinnest skin possible, with a really juicy center. Here the skins are on the thicker side, and they didn't seem to have much juice (soup) on the inside. Even Foodtalk Cafe in Fremont has better Xiao Long Bao. \nWe also tried their dumplings and the green onion pancakes, both of which were ok - they do give you 3 whole pieces when you order the pancakes, which would be alot for just one person.\n\nSo a good place to go if you're in a rush but want dumplings and aren't picky I guess.", "author": "Adrienne L."}

Don't.\n\nThe xiao long bao is okay, but not great, and not consistent. Flavorful filling, and good skin, but xiao long bao isn't great if it's been sitting, which often seems to happen. So, get it if you are the forgiving type, and just feel the urge to have xiao long bao.\n\nOtherwise get the stuff that is not so temperamental to prepare. \n\nAnother shanghai favorite is sheng jian bao. That's listed as \"pork and bok choy pancakes\" oddly enough (or beef pancake too).  Onion (scallion) pancakes are delicious, and cheap. Potstickers, and dumplings. Just get them!!\n\nRound out everything with a soup. Pick the first one you pause at.\n\nIf fact, don't go in there and stare at the menu, trying to ponder what is \"best.\" If you don't go for what I say, just look, and buy the first things that look good. Don't over think.  If it's hot. Just get it. If you don't know what it's called, who cares. Point! \"I want that!\"\n\nThey will gladly serve you.\n\nPlace is cheap, so the seating is the same. It's a cheap eatery. It's frantic, and chaotic, but don't worry. You'll be fine.\n\nIt's 1.85 for shrimp hargao, Yo. And without the 1 hour wait you'd have at Hong Kong Lounge.

Since the place was named after Xiao Long Bao I thought they'd be amazing but they failed to perform any such feat in my mouth, skip 'em. Head on over to those scallion pancakes, they're doughier than I like but they nailed that green onion flavor so I was happy. The chives/bokchoy/pork dumplings were ehhh nothing spectacular but satisfied my dumpling craving. Lastly, I got the Turnip cakes which were fresh and flavorful and flaky (my god, it even has bacon in them!!). Those things were also soooo filling, my only complaint is that they were cold -they fried them when we walked in so by the time we ordered they were cold to the touch.\n\nAll in all I'd say that the food was alright, I've had better dim sum, but at $16 for three people (with leftovers) and the sparkling floor, I'm going to be back for sure.", "author": "Monica S."}

Not so long line, even more excited. No menu to be seen, until you reach the register. There is a rather small 8 1/2\"x11\" piece of paper of a menu taped to the counter. That's OK, because obviously we just want XLB! Waited 10 minutes for 2 orders. Taste was good--not very good, just good. \n\n2. XLB cravings kicking in every time we pass by. Not so long line, it moves quickly. Rude old man tries to cut in line--I hold my tongue, and calm myself before I shove him out the door. Lucky for him he walked away. XLB today was also good.\n\n3. Husband picked up some more XLB today, and they tasted like pot-stickers. Today's batch has no 'juiciness'. I wonder if they mixed up the won-ton filling with the XLB filling? Either that, or they made too many the previous day, and these were re-heated. They were not appetizing. So sad!\n\nIn summary, I would re-visit Xiao Long Bao if convenient. My advice is don't get overly excited about this place. Definitely not spectacular, but A-OK. I think the XLB would be tastier if the skin was thinner, minced ginger in the sauce, and if it didn't taste like pot-stickers.", "author": "Lizzie L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-05-02", "description": "I haven't written on yelp for 3+ years, but might have to start writing about my horrible experiences at places. So let's first start off by saying that today was a nice sunny day and the heat was definitely in the air. \n\nI decided to take a stroll out to Clement Street for some easy fix Chinese meal. I remember that district supervisor Eric mar posted a picture of some Xiao Long Baos on Clement Street awhile back and so I decided to trek over there and get some. \n\nSo as I entered the building, there were no customers inside at about 4:45pm. Place is clean and there were about 4 workers in the front and a couple in the back kitchen. My first impression was that this joint is highly staffed and food should be great.\n\nI decided to take a look at the menu and see what this new place has to offer. So it came down to getting the \n\nBBQ Pork Wonton Noodle Soup\nDry Shrimp, Chives, Egg Vermicelli Pancake\nPotstickers\nand of course the Xiao Long Baos since that is what the name of the restaurant is named after.\n\nIn terms of flavor, here's the breakdown: BBQ Pork Wonton Soup was okay, but not great. The soup was made to order and featured BBQ Pork, a couple of wontons, egg noodles, and bok choy. The broth that came with it was on the salty side. The bowl is the size of those make-it-yourself noodles that you make by boiling hot water and pouring it into the bowl size containers. Not much for $6.25. I'm a big eater. I would rather go down to the corner restaurant and get better quality for cheaper next time.\n\nNext, the Dry Shrimp, Chives, Egg Vermicelli Pancakes I saw were being made, so I asked for the new batch and that I could wait since I was eating there. The other ones that were premade had been sitting out on a tray for who knows how long. Anyhow, bit into them and realized they had dry tofu inside as well. The flavors mixed well, but these too were salty.\n\nPotstickers looked decent and they were already portioned into plastic containers ready to sell. Despite the looks as if they were sitting in the container for more than 30mins, I really wanted to try them so I did. They were stuffed with meat and veggies, cold like the SF Bay, and lacked any flavor. This is where maybe they should have added salt, but then again maybe they shouldn't because it would probably end up being too salty. \n\nFinally, it came down to the Xiao Long Baos, when I ordered them they were in a warmer, which I thought this can't be good. So upon no better judgment I decided to still get them because that's the name of the restaurant. Bad idea, they were not hot, but luke warm, they were dry with no soupy filling, and hard like dense small meatballs. When I asked to see if I could get a new batch the lady at the counter didn't understand me well enough so brought in what I believe could be the owner or manager of the business. The owner said that this is not a dine in restaurant, but a to-go place. The Xiao Long Baos are always bought by customers and they take it home and they come back and say they love them. The lady went on to say that she will not make me a new batch because they steam them in orders of 30. I asked why not steam them in smaller batches so that they would be hot, she said no, that they don't do that here. After going back and forth for about 6-8mins with a small crowd of employees surrounding my table like vultures they still decided to do nothing and the lady just gave me back $3.80. \n\nAfter 20mins sitting down finishing my soup, one potsticker, and one pancake. I decided to write down comments about my experience. The lady then overlooked my shoulder as to see what I was doing. I felt a little uncomfortable then because she could be doing something else, perhaps making an effort at cooking me xiao long baos. Anyhow, as I packed up my bag and the remaining food that I did have (that needed to be reheated at home), the lady decides to open her mouth and say, \"If you want, I can make you a new batch, but you'll have to wait 15mins.\" My reply to her was, why didn't you do that for me 20mins ago when I asked you about it. Her response was that there were no customers in the shop to buy the other ones. That's when I told her to make it into smaller batches, it's not that hard to do that. \n\nAnyhow, long story short, THE CUSTOMER IS NOT KING!!! This business is horrible at customer service, the food is too salty, the food on the racks are cold, and basically you get what you pay for. If you want great xiao long baos there is a place called Shanghai Dumpling King on Balboa and Shanghai Dumpling Shop in Millbrae if you want pretty decent xiao long baos and trust me orders at these places if you were to take out, would not be 15mins. Maybe waiting for a table could be that long, but well worth eating there than here.

This place is fine for a snack but it is not a culinary destination.  if you are walking in the park and make your way up to Clement St looking for XLB, it'll do.  They aren't bad, but they aren't great either.  it's a perfectly acceptable location to get a snack though.  Their scallion pancakes are fresh but rather doughy.  I would have to give this critique to their entirety of San Francisco however.  where the heck can I find a nice flakey and properly salted scallion pancake?  Is it the sourdough bacteria atmosphere?  but I digress.  oh, wait, that was the end of my review.  Actually my review probably ended after \"This place is fine for a snack but it is not a culinary destination.\"  I was probably just ranting for the rest of this review.", "author": "Nat L."}

Here's the deal. $2.99 buys you 10 dumplings. Score! Right??? Negative. The just blanch (pop into hot water) cold dumplings for about 20seconds. I'm fairly certain this is what caused my sudden diarrhea... I'm quite certain it wasn't the one bite of pumpkin mochi pie that did me in.

First time I bought the sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf, it was really good but the second time I bought it, it was dry and not fresh. And they got my order wrong. They gave me 3 orders of bao in a different meat I requested, but it's not horrible. I prefer the BBQ pork though. And they added some other order I didn't want.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-05-15", "description": "Popped in for some freshly made dumplings to go and decided to eat in instead. Ordered a Hong Kong style wonton soup and Shanghainese steamed dumplings. To my surprise the wonton soup was served in a thin disposable plastic bowl and the dumplings in a take out plastic box. Both the wontons and dumplings were obviously not freshly made or steamed that morning as the skins were dry and hardened. I suspect they were from the night before as it was only 9:30 am when I went in.  The steamers were working full blast so why these people would even try to sell stale products is beyond me. I can only surmise that they have no self respect or respect for their customers. Even if the wontons were fresh, they would have flunked miserably in comparison to other average noodle houses serving HK style wontons. The Shanghainese dumplings were terrible also. I was very upset but decided to just pay and go.  Altogether I ate 2 wontons and one Shanghainese dumpling from my order. I would have said something and asked them to replace my order with freshly made wontons and dumplings, But somehow what they did was so fundamentally wrong I just didn't want to waste any more time with them. Zero stars if I could.", "author": "Giovani T."}

I love the idea, I love the name, I love their prices, but I don't love the food. I've gone twice since opening and have been disappointed in different ways. the first time I was excited and wanted to order a little of everything. only to find out that half the menu was unavailable. okay, fine, I ordered the xlb, the chili pork dumplings and the pot stickers. xlb skin a little thick and took a lot of explaining to get them to give me more vinegar. chili dumplings were great, pot stickers were okay but you could tell all hand made by the people up front. I had an awkwardly long wait for my food but I chalked that up to new openings. the second time I went I saw they changed the menu already and took some items off. that's fine since you weren't making it to begin with. I ordered my chili dumplings and got one of each of the savory buns. to my dismay the chili dumplings were different!!! totally different sauce and all of my skin was broken. the first sauce had better flavor, this time all it was was chili oil and no spicy flavor. the buns are okay but not enough filling and a little dry. I'm holding out hope they're still working out the links and will have to revisit in a few months before I give up on them.", "author": "Susan Z."}

Not the best XLBs but they hit the spot pretty well.  Pot stickers were seared to order and also quite nice. My only gripe is, they list prices by whole orders and not individual units of dumplings or snack item, where an order consists of of 3 or 6 or 10 depending on the type of item. Hopefully that system will change in time", "author": "Loraine T."}
