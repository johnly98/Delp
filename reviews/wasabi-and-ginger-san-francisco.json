I've had dinner here a few times because it's basic, reasonably priced, and easy. However, if you're looking for a fancy dinner or the freshest and highest quality fish, this probably isn't the place. If you're looking for a casual, quick and average sushi dinner, this is your spot. Give it a try! \n\nThey have a lot of different rolls, as well as other entree options. However, I usually stick to the sushi here as opposed to the cooked entree options. The rolls are pretty sizeable and portions are filling!", "author": "Nicole D."}

We went on a busy Friday night - and I mean packed!  They were running and trying to keep up, but were down one cook.  They had a private party in their traditional room with Japanese floor seating (not really that traditional, as you can put your legs down under the table. So the table is close to the floor, but for those Americans (and the elderly) who cannot tolerate being seated in that position they made a cut out under the table so you can sit with your legs extended downwards)...anyway, we waited a looong time for our sushi rolls (which are always tasty) and they were very apologetic and showed real concern. I get it! Shit happens and you can't be a whiny brat! Plus, it helped that they suggested I have another beer on them- yes, having a (free) drink is always a good suggestion ;-)...and they comped our seaweed salad. They were more than gracious, and it was endearing. \n\n....and as always, the vegetable udon noodle soup with veggie tempura was just fantastic. So go! The food does not disappoint and the service is kind and welcoming.", "author": "F C."}

No amount of salt can make that tasty.\n3/5 Gyoza (Japanese pot stickers, pork and vegetable inside). These were a-okay. They came out hot but did not taste special or memorable. Next time I would pass.\n3/5 Tiger Roll (Shrimp tempura topped with snow crab and crunched honey walnut). My roll was probably the best out of everything our group ordered. I enjoyed the crunched honey walnut but overall thought the roll was pretty mediocre.\n4/5 Sake Bombing. I love that our group of friends was able to sake bomb and no one minded!

We were immediately greeted and sat at the Sushi bar because there were no tables available (totally fine, I actually like sitting at the sushi bar). The waiter greeted us with the complementary edamame and brought ice waters as requested. We were able to put in an appetizer order very quick, but she ran away before we could decide on the rolls. \nAPPETIZERS: I went for the seaweed salad. Nothing special, just what you would expect, fresh, simple, decent portion. My boyfriend got Miso soup, unfortunately they served it to him without a spoon causing him to get up and have to track down the waitress before he was able to eat. \nROLLS: I was surprised to see they have a few vegetarian roll options (yay) but unfortunate that most were tempura (boo). I decided on two rolls (avocado maki & plum/mint leaves) also got the vegetarian gyoza to share. My boyfriend got two rolls (I think the 49ers and the crazy roll). I received my rolls/gyoza first. we were able to share the gyoza and I have my b/f a couple pieces of my rolls as he was waiting. The waitress was no where to be found for quite awhile, only stopping by about 10 minutes after I received mine to say his would be up shortly. Another server dropped off my boyfriends meal about 10 minutes after that, we were not checked up on until we completed our meal. The server never said anything about the long wait or lapse of time in between our meals. Interestingly enough, neither of us were given any wasabi.... or ginger with our meal... which I happen to love. \nUnfortunately we only saw the server again when she came to drop the check, never asked if we wanted another round of drinks or dessert... When she cleared the plates the SPILLED THE TRAY OF SOY SAUCE all over my boyfriends pants and ran away (much like she did for the entire meal) only to come back and run the credit card. \nOverall, very upset with the service here and not entirely impressed with the food either.

Since we were in a hotel room, reheating the food wasn't an option.

The rolls are very fresh and the staff has great recommendations. Also, I think the prices are very affordable. \n\nMy friend I came here on July 4th after a whole day of drinking and were happy to see that this place was open.

Firstly, keep in mind that all of this together was less than $50!\n\nSecondly, the portions are generous and the food is AMAZING! The seaweed salad is great for two people, maybe even three. The miso soup was hot and steamy and was delicious. The sashimi I was a fan of because it was only $7 for 4 pieces, and I love that they had the option of getting 4 pieces only (some restaurants make you get more.) I was a little skeptical about the Hawaiian roll at first because the waitress said it was sweet, but I ended up loving the combination with the pineapple in it. The sauce on top was really really yummy too. The Giant roll was so tasty, but I'm also a huge spicy tuna fan! \n\nWhen we were done eating, we realized we had a lot the large sake left, so we got a nice buzz at the end of our meal.

I always thought about having a dinner there but I already had a favourite sushi spot and when you get hooked on a good sushi place, that's that.  But tonight I just felt lazy and carting my ass all the way to the Richmond via MUNI was simply not going to happen, so Wasabi & Ginger finally got it's shot, albeit 8 years late?\n\nFirst off, the menu here is a little overwhelming.  Not in the bad grammar and spelling forest for the trees sense, but more of the \"Where will I even start?\" variety.  At 7pm we were the only table there (suspect) and our server was refreshingly sweet about giving us time to have a browse, choose some drinks, eventually order over 20 minutes after sitting down.  He was honest when asked questions telling us to choose ebi over tako since he thought the tako was chewy. Also, they carry Choya plum wine which is one of the best plum wines in existence.  So, 5 stars for service and setting.\n\nBut the food, it was a little average.  It was fresh enough fish, but there was nothing special about the presentation or the flavor combinations.  The wasabi was not strong, which was a little disappointing.  No hair tingling, no heat in the nasal passages, for a place named \"Wasabi\" this was very disappointing.  The ginger also lacked kick and was not sliced very thinly.  The spicy tuna lacked spice.  The fried oysters were over-breaded and the sauce thick and too sweet.\n\nIf I could give them a 3.5 here, I would.", "author": "Lily A."}

I only order rolls, but they always seem very fresh and I love their specialty rolls, X-Roll and San Francisco Roll are my favorites! \n\nI sadly moved a little further away, so do not frequent it as frequently as I would like to, but I always know where to head when I'm in the mood for good rolls and good company :)", "author": "Lauren S."}

Immediately after unwrapping the food, we realized the udon had chicken. Called back in, explained for 10 minutes and were assured that a new tempura udon was on the way. After examining the rolls more closely, we realized yet another mistake. Called in again, after another 10 minutes we were told that we were mistaken, and it was in fact right. Excuse me, are you looking at this sushi roll or are we? It bore no resemblance to what we ordered. Frustrated, we just gave up.\n\nUdon arrives 40 minutes later. Or so we think. The delivery guy had a box of tempura, but when we tried to give the chicken udon back in exchange for a veggie udon, we realized there was no new container of udon. We were told \"No, just pick the chicken out. Extra chicken for you\".\n\n100% unbelievable. I think I stood at the door with my jaw dropped while the guy walked away.

I've visited this establishment a couple of times and was very impressed.  Well let me clarify,  impressed once I finished my meal.  When I first walked in I have to admit I was a little concerned.  It's a bit on the worn side and the decor is, to say the least, interesting.  There is a fishing net nailed to the ceiling with christmas bulbs hanging in no particular order.  The place could definitely use a little updating but this is a prime example of... \"never judge a book by its cover\".\n\nMy sis and bro in-law recommended this place and they have NEVER led me astray so I was certain this place had to be good, but I just couldnt get past the decor, so I was getting nervous.  But we sat down and ordered.  \n\nOh my god.  It was good.  The kind of good where you need to smoke a cigarette once you've finished.  Yes that good.  We had spicy tuna rolls, red snapper, hamachi, shiro maguro, another white tuna, beef tataki and scallops.  I was in heaven.  I usually don't order red snapper but my husband asked me to try his.  It blew me away.  We ordered more.  Everything tasted incredibly fresh and had a clean yet buttery taste.  The fresh wasabi was delicious, I could not stop.  I threw caution to the wind and I ate it all.  Which says alot, wasabi gives me acid reflux.  But I didnt care I was going to live in the moment and enjoy the spicy flavors against the buttery softness as they burst on my tongue and savor it all.

But it also gives you the opportunity to run a few tests on the unsuspecting gentleman. I know what you're all thinking, that I'm a game player. Maybe that's true, but I have some major things that I look for in a significant other and I can usually spot them right off the bat.\n\nI had a gentleman ask me out to dinner while riding the cable car home from the gym the other day. Thinking \"Wow, those squats are really paying off!\" I said yes. He then negotiated that we meet anytime after 6pm...I suggested 7pm to give myself plenty of time to primp after my oh-so-busy day being unemployed. \n\nThe day came, I got dressed and made up and poured myself a glass of wine (never go into a first date stone cold sober! Rule #1) while I waited for my date to arrive. Around ten minutes to 7pm, he called me and said he would be about 30 minutes late (minus 3 points!!--I follow the mantra if you're 10 minutes early, you're on time. If you're on time, you're 10 minutes late! But I digress). I politely let him know there was no hurry...and poured myself another glass of wine. \n\nFinally he arrived and I hopped into his car. He began to drive like he had a place in mind to eat, but after about 4 blocks, he turned to ask me \"What do you feel like eating?\" Now I'm all for trying to please the other person, but when it really comes down to it, I want a take-charge guy with a plan! Rather than roll my eyes in frustration, I came with ideas in mind since I've been through this before. \n\n\"Do you have a hankering for anything in particular?\" I asked, playing the demure female roll.\n\n\"Not really, how about you?\" he replied. Ughhhh! I can't stand that type of response. However, now he had left the ball in my court and we were going to go where ever I wanted.\n\n\"You like sushi?\" I asked, not really waiting for the answer. \n\n\"Sure, what's a good spot?\"\n\n\"Make a right, two blocks down and park.\" I told him. Thank God I came prepared. \n\nI've been to Wasabi and Ginger before but it had been quite some time. I knew it was pretty casual and that they usually played fun music inside. We scored a table (after I was once again put in the position of \"What do you prefer?\" by the gentleman) and proceeded to check out the menu. I, of course, ended up doing the ordering.\n\nWe shared a Sapporo, the Dragon Roll, a chef's specialty involving Ahi with ponzu and caviar, and edamame. The Dragon Roll was perfection, the Ahi was ok...the beer was helpful. I wish I was hungry enough to order some sashimi because the plates going by us looked very fresh and delicious. \n\nOverall, the atmosphere is light and fun, the food is good and consistent, the staff is friendly and attentive...and gentlemen, hear this. If you're going to be man enough to ask a lady out on a date, do a little preparation. It goes a long way and the ladies love it.

Unlike many of my other personal favorite San Francisco sushi joints, Wasabi & Ginger remains consistent in both quality and presentation. Some places fluctuate on these qualities, the first visit leaves a great and lasting impression - however the second or third time and the only thing lasting is the fish smell attached to your Louis Vuitton purse. At Wasabi & Ginger, this is not the case.\n\nThe fish at W&G is always fresh, always absolutely delicious and there are no hit-n-miss nights to avoid. Here you leave feeling full and satisfied, which can be a rare thing in the world of sushi bars. OK the restaurant decor isn't anything particularly special, but the wall of windows along one side adds an open and airy feel to the place. Also, I prefer not to be seated close enough to see the nose hairs of the person on the table next to me. (In my book, seats this close = tables crammed into every single available space/greed). The seating arrangement here is spaced out, so you don't even have to take turns to breath! How novel!\n\nWasabi & Ginger is a guarantee! Jack likes!", "author": "Jack G."}

We were EATING RAW FISH!\n\nWe were eating like shit.\n\nFast forward many, many years and my friends that visit me often still think of sushi as those three days-old fake crab mismash that we were 'brave' enough to eat. I then promptly take them to Wasabi & Ginger, and their views change, stat.\n\nI'm not saying that this is the best sushi in the city; it's probably not even in my top 5. But it is GOOD, it is CONSISTENT, and it is FRESH. Their rolls are affordable, and they often have Butterfish on the menu (both in rolls and nigiri), something you don't always find. My personal favorite is the Tiger Roll; I may lie and tell my friends that the unagi on the inside is fried shrimp but it's only so they can taste its fresh crab salad delectableness without realizing that yes, they are also eating eel. Feeling guilty? NEVER.\n\nOn certain occasions, they've offered me free ice cream as dessert; other times, they don't. But you always get free edamame (which seems like a small detail until you realize that many of these new, 'fancy' places are charging upwards of $5 for your run-of-the-mill boiled soybeans) and kind, prompt service. \n\nNever overly-inventive, never overly-pricey, I always walk out of Wasabi & Ginger satiated, satisfied, and waiting for my next out-of-town visitor to arrive.", "author": "Aubrey S."}

Plain old Americanized sushi rolls (read: pseudo-Japanese cuisine). The boy and I ate here an hour or so before closing- so it wasn't very crowded by then. Yes, I agree  that the names of the rolls are a bit um.. provocative.. but that's just SF humor for ya- fun and entertaining unless you're in the bottom 10% of the cerebral gene pool. \n\nThey do have something of a valet service going on- if you can even call it that. When we left, the person manning the valet booth had already gone home. Um... our keys?? We had to step back into the restaurant to find someone to get our keys. Needless to say, my opinion of the service here is just a bit under par.\n\nWasabi & Ginger is a great place to go- the perfect place in fact- if you are seriously craving some sushi rolls. Street parking is a b*tch, but as mentioned earlier, they do offer superior valet service. -_-", "author": "Elaine T."}

We were not too hungry but not too full, so we thought sushi will fit the bill just right.\n\nOn this particular night, the restaurant was half filled and we promptly got our seats.  The server immediately came with our menus, iced water, and a bowl of edamame.  As we munched on our soybean, I noticed their special menu packed with a variety of fish not available at all the Japanese restaurant.  We ended up getting a sashimi plate of ocean trout and some kind of white fish.   \n\nMy friend also craved scallops, so we decided to get the Scallop Lover roll.  Personally, I believe God created scallops to be enjoyed by our eyes in the ocean and not in our mouths.  When it came, I was very cautious since my experiences with eating scallops have not been the most pleasant.  Physically, it looked appetizing - a roll with mango and unagi covered with scallops and a white dressing to top it off.  To my amazement, the roll tasted marvelous.  The mixture of sweetness and scallopness (yes, I made up the word) with the warmness of the other ingredients made an explosion of food eutopia in my mouth.  Absolutely, I love this roll and would definitely order it again.\n\nWe tried other food items here, though good, did not compare to the Scallop Lover (I cannot believe I just said I love scallops).  The topiko with quail egg, which I have not seen on any menu for quite a long time, also was quite delicious but definitely is reserved for people who can stomach eating raw eggs.  \n\nThe staff constantly refilled my water and even had time to tell a joke to us, so no problems there.  A scoop of ice cream finished the night and we were all set to go out merry way.", "author": "Aaron K."}

It was very fresh and looked exactly like a floating fish on a bed of rice. The taste was so delectable,  I absolutely recommend this place to eat.  If you can here, you can't go wrong with the specialty rolls and make sure to give Phoenix roll, Super Dynamite and Tempura roll a try - they really hit the spot for me. I really enjoyed the Super Dynamite because it really was super spicy and it even had a bit of crunch to it with really added a balanced and full flavor to the roll.\n\nThe presentation of the food was also fresh and very natural. We were served two huge heaping helpings of ginger and wasabi in an adorable white ceramic bowl to accompany our orders. Now, if that wasn't enough we were also served miso soup in a hulled out wooden bowl  - Yeah, momma likes her miso soup! \n\nI'll definitely plan to come back here again. The restaurant also had a very interesting fish aquarium by the bar area with a gigantic white fish taking up the water.

Yeah, I like having Clooney and Pitt, but if you throw in too many stars you eventually stop gaining anything.  \n\nAmbiance was a little odd (fish tank, indoor/outdoor carpet, \"Please wait to be seated\" sign that I think they took from a Pizza Hut), but Lizzy and I both agreed that it was a nice, casual date.

We have had to try and wean ourselves off lately as we were making it a weekly habit.\n\nThe california roll knocks all others out of the water, and is relatively cheap for real crab (there's got to be a tiny touch of mayo in there that makes it so juicy!). Once you try W&G california roll it won't taste good anywhere else.\n\nOther favorites include the Super Dynamite roll (absolutely delicious), rainbow roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy tuna roll, crazy roll, and pretty much anything else on the menu.\n\nAlso of note, free edamame and free ice cream. Can't beat that.", "author": "David R."}

And it's all pretty good.  But that's all it is.  \n\nAnd don't order any Sashimi.  Seriously.  You DO NOT want to go here.\n\nIf you don't want to drop a couple of hundred on a good sushi night, Miyabi and Kamekyo are better bets.  But if you're in the office late and need an out with some deep-fried rolls comprised of what would otherwise be perfectly flavorful and healthy fish, seaweed, veggies and roe, this is as good a bet as any.", "author": "Forrest C."}

I went for a birthday dinner and after emptying 2 huge bottles of sake plus a handful of small bottles, we all came out paying no more than $30 a piece. I was excited to try their signature wasabi and ginger martini roll but I found it to be bland. Letting the roll soak in ponzu sauce caused the seaweed to become overly chewy and nasty. If you are a katsu fan, you will certainly get your money's worth here. I think this was the largest plate of deep fried meat I've seen in a while. Wasabi & Ginger fit the bill for a casual, cheap restaurant in walking distance to the Polk St bars but unless I was in a similar situation, I probably wouldn't return.", "author": "Susan L."}

I don't like TVs in my sushi restaurants, but I am sure there are people who do. The bar was not very inviting; the tables were fine. I like the fish tank.\n2. Service - yup, solid 3. The guy didn't fall over himself to make it good service; he just took our order, put down our food, and cleared our plates. My sister thought he deserved a gold star for naming the rolls on the plate - NO WAY! They are supposed to do that! She also thought it was above and beyond that he refilled our tea at the end of the meal ... buuuuut, my tea cup was empty long before that, so no again. AND, I thought it was standard for sushi chefs to welcome customers and say good-bye and thanks when they leave. Apparently not because they didn't here - they were involved in their own conversations and watching the Olympics. Eh.\n3. The food - yup, 3. The miso is pretty good - I like miso with seaweed and hate it when establishments demur from including it. The fish is fine - it doesn't scream \"I am so fresh and amazing.\" The spider roll is one of the tastiest I have had anywhere, so that's above three. But the SF, rainbow, and Phoenix rolls were a mere three stars. They were all a little off in their own unique way. The tuna atop the Phoenix roll was ... weird ... chemical-like ... I just expected more from a roll so packed with fish. It should have screamed freshness and loveliness with all those fish in there. The SF roll has a nice crunch, but the spicy tuna inside wasn't spicy and was really mushy and seemed like it was missing fish. The rainbow roll wasn't good. We didn't even finish it because the CA roll insides were so mayonnaise-y. Yuck. \n\nThe one four star aspect to this place is the tea. They use the kind that has toasted rice in it - delicious!", "author": "Jen S."}

We ordered online but when we didn't get any confirmation I called.  The girl on the phone was nice enough and said the sushi would take 45 minutes to arrive at the house.  Nearly 3 hours later, when my guests were near starvation I called again and asked what the deal was.  The driver had gotten lost, although they are located less than .5 miles from my house.  Only when I prompted how they could compensate for lost time and hungry guests did they offer a small discount on the massive party trays that I'd ordered.  When the driver came he was also very nice and apologetic and was tipped.  The food, when it finally arrived, was average, nothing at all special.  A few weeks later I received my credit card and had to go BACK into the restaurant since they had charged my card twice.  I waited and waited in the empty restaurant as they floundered around trying to figure out what to do with me, not even offering a free drink or a water or anything to ease the frustration I was feeling.  I probably waited for 30 minutes until I finally just let them take the small slit of my credit card bill as proof of what had happened.  I know mistakes happen when running a business and I feel like I give people a benefit of the doubt more than they might deserve but this was ridiculous.  I should not suffer and WAIST SO MUCH TIME on other peoples mistakes without getting compensated or at least some type of sincere apology for their incredible lack of being able to run a business.

The hot dish is a HUGE plate of fresh hamachi with jalapenos, garlic and avocado. You will have garlic breath, so don't order this one if you planning on making out that that night, but its delish.
