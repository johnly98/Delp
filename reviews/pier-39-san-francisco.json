I didn't walk out with any shopping bags, but I sure did enjoy bite at the Boudin's on the pier because I picked up a coupon book with a coupon for a free soda pop with a purchase of clam chowder in a bread bowl. I was sold on that!\n\nAnywho, there's a lot to see here. Even a store dedicated to left handed people. And there's the Smartwater stage at the far end with a carousel close by. The act I saw at the stage was Merry Mary. She was quite a hoot. She's an older lady with some classic circus type acts. When she pulled at the flames, I was terrified for her and us as guests. lol! It was a good show, but not good enough to keep me there for the entirety of the show. You even have the option to tip Merry Mary I think through Venmo or PayPal.\n\nAll the way at the end of the pier is a great photo location of the bay.", "author": "Antonio L."}

Sure there are tours to Alcatraz that leave from this pier, but if you're looking to buy tickets the day or, chances are slim to none that you're going to get lucky. \n\nThe restaurants here are ok...I tried one a few years back when I was here at the pier but it wasn't good and they've closed since then; instead I'd venture off a bit to Fisherman's Wharf which is a 5 minute walk where there are better choices for fresh seafood. \n\nWhatever you do...don't park in the open lot that's next to the water that's in front of Fisherman's Wharf; none of their machines worked to prepay your ticket with a debit card, so you'll need to get over to CVS to use their ATM, then head back where it's another $5.00 cause it took you 10 minutes to do all of this.

This is one of the most popular tourist attractions in San Francisco. It is located at the far northeastern part of the city overlooking all three bridges, Alcatraz, and many ships and boats. Paid garages are in the area, but the pier is well served by transit.\n\nI have fond memories of visiting Pier 39 as a child. It appeals to the kid in all of us with bright colors and lots of fried and sweet foods. The overall concept is an east coast boardwalk over the Bay with many shops and snack food stalls.\n\nThis is a great place for souvenir shopping. They sell lots of San Francisco themed merchandise along with jewelry and some art mainly geared for the international tourist. The food ranges from bad to very good with several gems buried amongst the mainly average fare.\n\nThe real stars are the sea lions and the view. At some point, dozens of sea lions decided to make the pier home. Rather than fight it, the owners made it a prime attraction luring many people to view the lions. They can smell bad and are often just lying around, but the occasional fights and overall atmosphere is great. Plus you get a great view of the Golden Gate and Alcatraz.\n\nIf it's your first visit to San Francisco, I do recommend stopping by for a visit.

If you live in SoCal, what do they do for a break?\n\nIn Toronto, if you get bored and want a weekend of craziness, you head to Montreal.  If you want peace and quiet, you head north.  Well San Fran is 5 hours away and a change of pace and weather would be good right?  I'm packed up in the car already and my SoCal friend is available to make the trip.  Cool!  It's an expedition - like Miner'49'ers!\n\nArrived at San Francisco and what do all tourists do?  Gotta go to Pier 39.  Just a quick note SoCal is 100+ degrees, San Fran is 70 degrees and drops to 60.  Hmmm....got the wrong clothes with me.\n\nFor those who like to get souvenir clothing, Pier 39 does not have a shortage of them.  You name a SanFran/Golden State memorabilia and you will get it.  I opted not to overpay for a hoodie from china still with the smell of the sweat shop on it.\n\nFood, fun, entertainment, shopping, and the scenery of the bay are all there on two floored wooden boardwalk that is Pier39.  If you are hungry as you walk through the place, they have their famous sourdough clam chowder everywhere.  It's basically a small town of it's own.  Just an FYI - if you intend to go to Chinatown sometime during your trip, you could pick up the souvenirs there.  They're all come off the same boat.\n\nSince they started the e-bike and e-scooter share program.  The scooters are everywhere.  Neat little transportation device but I find it unregulated and dangerous.  Watch out for them.\n\nAlso, a nearby place to hangout is Fisherman's Wharf.

There were all kinds of interesting shops, there was good food and there were a ton of sea lions to watch! I was here all the time for people and sea lion watching. Over the past 25 years much of this has changed. The Pier is far too crowded now. Yesterday I could barely move around without running into someone. I think I said \"I'm sorry\" and \"Excuse me\" more times yesterday after bumping into people than I ever have in my life. The shops are less interesting and more generic, and, worst of all, there are too few sea lions. This place has lost a good deal of it's magic for me.

The real heart of the city is in its neighborhoods:  the business people in the Financial District, the shopaholics at Union Square, the trendy atmosphere of Union Street, hipsters meet Latin America in The Mission, old money in Upper Pacific Heights.  But if the tourists want touristy stuff, they go to Jefferson Street and Pier 39.\n\nIn the mid-1970s, San Francisco took a dilapidated pier near Fisherman's Wharf and turned it into a tourist destination.  And it succeeded.\n\nMost times I've gone to Pier 39, it's been loaded with people.  They're walking the length and enjoying the people-watching.  They're going into the stores and eating at the restaurants.  They're enjoying the views of the bay.  They're riding the merry-go-round.  It's not real San Francisco, but they're enjoying themselves.  Let the city snobs complain about it not really being what The City is all about;  they're the types who say that there's nothing good on the other side of the bay.\n\nStill, I doubt that there are many locals here.  Partly because the stores are overpriced, and parking is awful.  As of this writing, the official parking garage charges $10/hour, which is comparable to the Financial District.  And the place feels so ticky-tacky.\n\nHaving written that, there are two things at Pier 39 where even locals put aside their snobbishness, or at least should:\n* Aquarium of the Pacific.  I still haven't been here.  But it's supposed to be good, and is a fitting attraction for SF's waterfront that should be visited.\n* The sea lions, who took over the boat docks in 1989 and haven't left.  I don't think there's any place like it in the world.  Active sea life on the shore of an urban city, easily accessible.  What was a nuisance quickly became, and remains, a point of pride in San Francisco.  The girl saw the sea lions for the first time today, and she was so excited about them.\n\nNote that this part of North Beach has two-hour free parking on the streets, Bay Street and points south.  That may be all that City residents can stomach of Pier 39.  And it sure is easy on the wallet.  Also, I've been there at night too, and the crowds are gone.\n\nIf your relatives from out of the Bay Area come to visit, they're likely to want to go to Pier 39.  Okay, bring them.  It's not all that bad.", "author": "Ron L."}

You can download a parking app or go to a website that will help you find cheaper alternatives and even hold your place in advance such as parkme.com. \n\nOnce you walk towards the peer you will see a lot of things-- Street performers are always fun to watch. My favorite are the artists that draw amazing things right in front of you. Not many people can do such talented things. Remember to always tip-- these people are artists, trying to do what they love. \n\nAnother thing you will see are a lot of boats-- jet boats (shout our to Blue & Gold Fleet-- check out my photos of my speed boat ride) and small three level ships that take you all around the Bay. They go to Alcatraz, around/under both the Bay and Golden Gate Bridges and more. \n\nAs you walk onto the peer, which extends out onto the Bay, you ill find tons of shops and entertainment such as an aquarium, theater, and a carousel.  Some awesome shops along they way will entice you to open that checkbook, a fruit stand will make your mouth water with fresh fruit on display, or you may want to get some fresh clam chowder in a sourdough bowl. \n\nOnce you hit the end of the pier, you will see many seals and sea lions. They will make you laugh and smile. You will see the boats coming into the port and leaving... be sure to wave! \n\nI never have enough time to go through each and every store-- after all the meter is running at $10/hr to park! \n\n\n                                                        **Memory lane story**\n\nWhen I was 18 (in 1999), my friends and I wanted to go see the pier for the first time. We had no car and was way, way too young to rent a car. We lived 45 minutes away in Fairfield, Ca. We decided to rent a Uhaul and drive it into the city and we did so.

If you live in SF or LA, traffic and parking dictate a lot about your plans. \n\nThis pier has a lot of components. You can go shopping on the pier for goodies to take home. You can also eat on the pier and grab some Boudin or other food. You can sightsee all along the dock, especially the adorable seals. You can go on a ferry ride near the pier and see everything from the water. You can check out the local entertainment that performs on the street. The list goes on and on. \n\nI highly recommend coming here if you are visiting the area. If you do not like crowds, try to pick a less busy day. The winds are gustin so be sure you have a sweater if you're dressed in shorts. The parking is a pain in the butt in the area. There are lots but they are super expensive. If you go farther from the beach, there is street parking along the residential areas.", "author": "Ori N."}

I have been to this tourist attraction many times in the past. It's a fun place to visit if you don't mind the slow moving crowds and the wall-to-wall people in the shops, the eateries, the courtyards and the general outdoor. \n\nI always thought of Pier 39 as just being okay (3 stars) except for the NFL Shop and Boudin Sourdough (4 stars). A few years back there was a shop that sold holiday ornaments and Dept. 56 collectibles for the holiday season. They had some hard to find Dept. 56 items and it was my go-to place during the holiday. The shop was always festive and colorful. They have been gone for a while.  I was disappointed that they closed. Back then I also enjoyed having the clam chowder bowl on those cold days...ahh...comfort food, but those darn seagulls seemed to linger around in search of leftover sourdough bread or any food.\n\nMy visit was an enjoyable one, despite it being for less than 1/2 hour. I was amazed at their outdoor farmer's market - plump strawberries, bags of cherries, red and green apples, grapes, summer fruits (peaches, nectarines, plums). Fresh produce is always a welcome sight. I am glad they have this market available for the local people and tourists. It has restored my faith of Pier 39 and its attraction. Thus, I will return for more visits during the summer season - weekdays and/or weekends.", "author": "Carol C."}

There's also a number of fancy places which offer steak, clam chowder (of course) and wonderful sea food. \nI love the specialty shops there ever since I was a kid.

The stimulation level of Pier 39 is an 11/10, which means you will be overstimulated after about 20 minutes, unless you find somewhere a little more chill to take a break from all the people, noise, and rambunctiousness. Definitely check out the seals. They are usually hanging out getting some sun. I saw a few seals wrestle, which entertained myself and the giant crowd taking pictures/video. Finding clean, functional restrooms is a problem at Pier 39. With the massive waves of people and constant tourist trap buzz, you will find it challenging to take fun, pleasing photos at Pier 39. Shops put on the performance of being unique all in their own way, but any well-traveled visitor will see through the novelty of these shops as mere ploys to empty your wallet.

There are a ton of places, advertising tickets for different site attractions, in addition to the several gift shops and eateries here.  I think the first time you visit, it's cool because you have no idea what to expect. \n\nThe place is stacked with several different shops from name brand shops to little gift shops that sell SF key chains and water globes, and chain restaurants and a ton of seafood restaurants.  I think my favorite part of Pier 39 though is seeing the sea lions on the dock.  The locals are so used to it, but I still think it's cool how the sea lions always congregate around here, flopping on each other.  There's even a learning center at the Pier that even talks about the sea lions and local conservation efforts.  There's also plenty of hotels nearby, in case you're looking for lodging nearby and is walking distance to Ghiradelli Square, Fisherman's Wharf, Ferry Building, etc...

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2018-06-25", "description": "This is a fake pier built as an amusement park forty years ago and it is tourist sheep-shearing station. It has nothing to do with the industry of the waterfront, with fishing or for that matter, San Francisco. I grew up nearby.\n\nThe food is mostly industrial frozen, the real money is made on the outrageous parking charges in the dangerous garage across the street or the corporate owned vendors of Chinese plastic clothing, and if you are interested seeing and meeting the low-lifes of the Bay Area--the kind of women that paint eyebrows on their face with Sharpies and have huge butts, or guys with lots of sports clothing and gang tattoos, plus lots of other bewildered and victimized tourists, Pier 39 is for you. \n\nIf you are from the Midwest and it's the first thing you see of the city, you will probably be impressed, and write perhaps a great review, but please know that more authentic, cheaper experiences, plus far better food, is available further west toward Taylor Street. \n\nThat said, the views of the bay, the proximity to the sea lions and the tourist boat rides are worth while. Just don't spend any money at the pier itself. You can buy far better food down at the real Fisherman's Wharf at the foot of Taylor Street, then take it to Pier 39 and enjoy the scenery.", "author": "Chris D."}

There is also the Heart of San Francisco o display at the end of the pier. We also saw an entertainer performing, there are multiple shops and restaurants as well as little snack shops.

Pier 39 has been on every \"San Francisco to experience\" list so I knew I had to go check it out. This place is very touristy and the shops and activities there very much cater to them. It gets very crowded, even on a Tuesday evening when I was there. That said, there are lots to eat and experience there. I saw some interesting specialty shops there and of course there is an endless supply of eats available. There are a number of seafood places (appropriately themed with the Pier) as well as other food options. There is a carousel toward the end of the pier as well as the seals that inhabit the side of the pier which is an attraction on its own. At the end of the pier offers some great views of Alcatraz. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone, at least for a stroll through like I did. If I had more time, I may have stopped in more of the shops as they did have some unique ones and maybe even sample more of the food there. I wouldn't plan on spending a day there, well maybe if you add in the aquarium and the entire wharf area. But for the pier itself I would think a 1 hours stroll, add an hour for activities and maybe another hour if you plan to eat there. FYI I ended up taking an Uber there, but I was told that the cable car goes there. I tried to return using the cable cars (Market Street Car) but the stop was very crowded and it is hard to get on at that stop, especially if you have bags, strollers or other bulky items with you.", "author": "Jason P."}

But out of the piers, \"39\" is like the main attraction and the excitement grows as you inch closer and closer on your journey down the piers. Pier 39 is a hotspot for tourists and even your adverage Californian alike. It's been very rare I've found myself here and it's not had a crowd of people partaking in the many little fun things you can do here.\n\nIt's full of many little nice shops where you can purchase souvenirs and trinkets to take back to your homestate \"if you're from out of town or country\" and they have a nice food selection for those foodies out there. Be it a famous Chowder Bowl from Boudin, or some select dish from the Hard Rock Cafe. Or kicking it with Mr Gump eating some of Bubbas famous \"Shrimp\" at Bubba Gumps. This place has got it all.\n\nThe place has something for everyone. The arcade here is pretty cool, parents can give their kids some tokens and let them have at it while they visit either the sports bar or tiki bar attached. Almost like having a Dave and Busters on a smaller scale close to you. Plus for parents you aren't far from your children.\n\nIn closing, Pier 39 is an experience.

I'm only two hours away from San Francisco but I always enjoy coming here. Never gets old. It's usually always crowded but there are times when Pier 39 really gets super crowded like during Game 2 of the NBA Finals on June 7th when we decided to visit. It was a home game (Warriors vs Cavs) and San Francisco must have been filled with Cavaliers fans the day before the home game. Super crowded! There are lots of entertainment and food spots as well as souvenir shops. Many street performers too. Believe it or not, there are world-famous San Francisco Street Performers that perform here live and they can be found entertaining the crowd at the Bay End of Pier 39.\n\nBeen here a few times just to break away from the summer heat in the Valley. Watched the sea lions, dined a few times at the Pier Market Seafood Restaurant and if you do decide to have lunch (or dinner) here you must try their award-winning clam chowder! They do have indoor and outdoor seating (http://www.yelp.com/biz/pier-market-seafood-restaurant-san-francisco?hrid=8hw9Qx8IQ2P8I0U79Uy9yA&page_src=shared_via_messages_or_emails).

Lots of gift shops from a magnet store to speciality gift shops such as the Alcatraz Gift Shop and Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. Gift Shop... because life is like a box of chocolates in this Forrest Gump-themed gift store :)\n\nBefore heading out there to San Francisco check out the Pier 39 website and print your coupon of Savings Fun Pack to redeem at the California Welcome Center. They are open from 9:00a to 7:00p everyday (except for major Holidays, I'm assuming). It's FREE and has discounts to many of the shops, restaurants and attractions at Pier 39, and two hours of free parking in the Pier 39 Parking Garage. \n\nI still have yet to visit the Aquarium of the Bay. I wonder if it is as big as Monterey Bay Aquarium. Just a few minutes walk to Pier 45 you can also tour a part of history, the USS Pampanito (http://www.yelp.com/biz/uss-pampanito-san-francisco?hrid=5mgYE5jC5lbpupOylkg8Vw&page_src=shared_via_messages_or_emails). Anyway, make Pier 39 a must on your list of your things to do in San Francisco. It is a tourist hot spot so bring enough money to accommodate dining and activities you plan to do for the day. There are ATM machines provided here as well. We enjoy playing tourists here sometimes. San Francisco Pier 39 is just a place like no other :)\n\nReview #0302", "author": "May A."}

I also went to check out the mirror maze they had going on which is right above piano steps (every step u make created sound). Parking is harder to find in the area, but if you come bright and early and go towards the residential areas, you will find one with some luck needed.

It is a great pier with so many things to do and see, places to eat, places to shop at, activities and so many great photo spots. The place isn't super huge but it also isn't large. You are able to see Alcatraz from the pier over looking the water, you can see sea lions when it is their season and many boats parked them for SF tours. \n\nThere is a mixture of high end stores and restaurants to eat here and there is something that everyone can enjoy. There is also a carousel here, movie viewing ride, aquarium, and many other things.

At Fisherman's Wharf, there's also a location that sells a ton of friend seafood products along with a lobster claw meat sandwich, etc. \n\nShoutouts to the beautiful double decked carousel.

Parking is crazy expensive so be prepared to pay.oh and if you come on the weekend in the afternoon you will have a hell of a time trying to find a spot. But once you get pass the madness take sometime to walk around and enjoy the views of sf. If you park in the garage across the street take the bridge over. They have lots of places to take great photos. You will know these spots by the signage throughout. Then Mosey on down to the Pier. They have so many fun things to do. You can catch a boat around the bay. Get cross the bay and get arrested at Alcatraz . Or if boats aren't your thing you can just check out those loud ass sea lions chilling by the Pier.

And while Pier 39 is generally included as one of the must-see tourist attractions in the area, I've never really bought in.  Maybe it's because I've been to San Francisco so many times, maybe it's because I've lived in California for so long that visiting another pier just doesn't promote much excitement, or maybe it's because--besides getting a few, cool shots of the basking-in-the-sun sea lions--the dining choices are less than spectacular.  I mean, the Hard Rock Cafe and the Bubba Gump Shrimp Co., for example, aren't that difficult to find.  They're plentiful.\n\nCertainly, that's not stopping anyone though.  The Pier's always busy, and I don't suppose that will change anytime soon.  But after about an hour of walking around, finally deciding upon an overpriced menu, and consequently inching our way through respective lines, we'd had enough.\n\nThere were some hot spots, however: Trish's Mini Donuts, the Crab House, and Wipeout.  Tourists definitely took notice.  So, overall, Pier 39 harbors three stars, an A-OK.  This review isn't meant to deter, by the way.  If you haven't been, drop by.  But for those who've strolled across the boardwalk before, maybe you'll agree: the Pier's replay value is a bit low.", "author": "Craig F."}

And although it's pretty stinky, going to see the sea lions floating on the wooden planks is so fun.

Sea lions, great restaurants with beautiful views, street performers and so much more. A very fun place for the whole family. Parking costs a bit but if you go to one of the restaurants they give you some free hours. Many tours start from here. Probably best to research a bit and plan since there is so much. Less of a chance to miss something you really like. Although regimented and pre-planned is not my style, I still recommend you do it for a place like this. Maybe you don't want to get there and start researching restaurants on your limited vacation time here - its understandable... Stuff like that can be done at home ahead of time.\n\nWhen it comes to something like this I usually recommend you hit up the hotel concierge on recommendations. They are professionally trained for just this sort of thing - you are paying for their expertise as part of the high cost of your hotel, so give them consideration.\n\nMe as a local (east bay) I just tell my friends from other countries to simply go here. Let a degree of impulsiveness guide you. Walk past a restaurant and go to the one that lures you in by what you see and smell. I don't have a regimented list of what to do here I just put it on the must see list. Just as I do going by bicycle across the Golden Gate and photo opportunities of Lombard St and the six Painted Ladies at Alamo Square - I simply tell them to go.

If you're coming from Sacramento and its 110 degrees outside and you think you'll be okay, trust me- its always cold on pier 39! \n\nIce Cream on pier 39 is also a must! There's something about being cold ^ and eating ice-cream that is incredible. \n\nParking around here costs an arm and a leg but thats to be expected. \n\nI love making the trip to pier 39, it's once of my favorite spots in SF!", "author": "Nicole B."}

So what is so touristy about the place? They don't really have any authentic places to eat that have the SF flavor.

Take some photos and get some fresh air. If you get hungry just walk your way to the Ferry Building because that is where the good food is at! (the walk can be far so if you are in a time crunch or simply tired then take an Uber or a pedicab - either one costs around $7-$10 ; pedicab being more expensive)  Another spot for grub that I personally ended up hitting twice in the week I was in the area was Waterbar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-01-12", "description": "Just like the Fisherman's Wharf district it's located in, Pier 39 is a big tourist attraction in San Francisco.  The pier is home to shops, restaurants, a small aquarium, amusement park-like rides, street performances, and more.  It's kind of like an outdoor carnival and is somewhat reminiscent of the Santa Monica Pier, but on a more touristy and smaller scale.  It's not the cleanest place, but one reason is because it's packed with so many people and there are seagull droppings everywhere.\n\nThe only big reason I recommend coming to Pier 39 is to see the sea lions.  That's what makes this place unique.  The sea lions are a lot of fun to watch.  They are located on the northwestern edge of the pier.  There's seating and a couple different vantage points to take in views of the animals.  There are hundreds of them and they can be loud.  If you visit, be prepared for the smell.  It doesn't smell good.  Very fishy, perhaps with some sea lion excrement mixed in too.\n\nFor an example of what the sea lions at Pier 39 are like, check out this short clip I posted to Instagram: http://instagram.com/p/iZ6M02wBhy/.  You probably won't be there long unless you *really* like watching sea lions.  It's best to visit the pier in the morning because the sun will be behind you as you face the sea lions.  Also, there are much less tourists in the morning.\n\nAnother reason to visit Pier 39 is for its excellent views of San Francisco Bay.  From west to east, you can see the Golden Gate Bridge, Angel Island, Alcatraz Island, Treasure Island, and the Bay Bridge.  Therefore, this is a good place to knock out all of these popular vistas from one spot.  Note there are much better spots to take pictures of some of these landmarks individually -- for example, Golden Gate Bridge Pavilion or Marin Headlands for the Golden Gate Bridge and the Embarcadero waterfront for the Bay Bridge.  I personally prefer those spots over Pier 39 as you're much closer to the bridges, which makes for better pictures.", "author": "Daniel B."}

Not because I was trying to be obnoxious since for some reason, I never need to try to be. No, my gut response was why would anybody subject themselves to a crowded seaside corridor of such crass commercialism. It's inevitable that any major city have one if it's next to a major body of water. Chicago has Navy Pier. New York has South Street Seaport. I've been to both, and I have to admit with a heavy heart that Pier 39 is the worst when it comes to uncontrolled crowds and thoroughly useless shops. But it would be too easy to slap one star on it and be done with it.\n\nI remember when it first opened back in 1978 and how it was going to bring a lot of revenue to the city. It has, but the downside is how there is anything of little redeeming social value on that pier. Nope. Even the Aquarium of the Bay is a snore since it feels like an underwater walkway to a real aquarium, but then comes the startling realization that the walkway IS the aquarium. The food should be completely bypassed here as my two recent experiences can attest - the Eagle Cafe (review: http://bit.ly/159peOO) and the Sea Lion Cafe (review: http://bit.ly/117MJH0). I had a lovely time at Swiss Louis with an army of friends...in 1984 (!)\n\nOnly two aspects save this mad cacophony from a one-star rating are: (1) the territorial gamesmanship at the Sea Lion Marina (photo: http://bit.ly/12Z7D7O)...and I don't mean the tourists jostling for the best iPad camera angle (review: ); and (2) the views of Alcatraz and environs at the end of the pier (photo: http://bit.ly/18wCEZO). So you could walk along the far less crowded outer boardwalks of the pier (photo: http://bit.ly/1aBLVNr) and leave the merchandise to the tourists in the central area. All you miss are the sideshow and the carousel (photo: http://bit.ly/16SGfKV). Regardless, do yourself a favor and skip it. Spend more time at the Ferry Building if you need the bay views.", "author": "Ed U."}

You'll know you've reached your destination when you see the flagpoles and signs for \"Pier 39\".\n\nHERE:  Food/eateries, rides, and souvenir shops await visitors as they enter the main walkway of Pier 39.

There are even specialty shops selling magnets (of which I bought 3 for $11.99).  Regarding the food vendors, I was almost tempted to buy some cotton candy truth be told.\n\nTHERE:  Pier 39 is comprised of 2 levels, with restaurants I believe comprising portions of the 2nd level.

Overall it has improved over the past decade.\n\nFirst of all - do your research and save some money!  Go to their website and check out what they have to offer. My two biggest tips is if you are a bay area resident, you can get a coupon to redeem 2 hours of free parking in their lot (usually $8/hour, so it helps).  Also, get the Pier 39 app for your smart phone.  There is a simple game on it for older kids, but what I wanted was the PhotoBooth photo frames with cute Pier 39 and San Francisco frames.  Just a word of caution: it's a little tricky to use AND the photos did not save onto my phone (iPhone 5), so we got the app for my husband's phone (iPhone4S) and it worked.  We're not sure, but perhaps the app was designed for the older phone? So test it out at home before heading out.\n\nWe also arrived at the parking lot at 10am since stores open at that time.  It was so much better than when we left at 1pm after lunch because it was less crowded, and it was easier to take photos of our son and let him roam more freely.\n\nWe were also lucky that Tulipmania just started, so we enjoyed all the beautiful tulips and other spring flowers that they had on display.  The sea lions were also out to sunbathe, so my son enjoyed that until the cold wind started to bother him.  If you are a fan of flowers, go check it out before it ends.\n\nMy son really enjoyed the carousel ($3 per person or $5 for two people), which we did first to avoid lines.  Then he found a little red car to ride in front of one store and the rest of the time he just enjoyed roaming.  IT would be great if there was a toy store here next time!

The standard of toilet tissue is also truly appalling, double ply in this day and age is simply a must. If I wanted to use single ply I would move to a third world country.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-06-23", "description": "I'm pretty convinced that nothing signifies our cultural and social decline more than the proliferation of \"selfies.\"\n\nWhen historians look back at our downfall one day, they won't make long lists of contributing factors like they did for the Roman Empire. They'll just all take selfies and create memes with the words \"the end can be traced back to this\" written across them.\n\nIf Pier 39 could add one more attraction, it should be a sign with the rule \"No Selfies.\" \n\nI will fully acknowledge that about 2% of the population takes amazingly good selfies, and they're the ones whose pics I double tap on Instagram. It should go without saying, but NONE of them are guys!  A guy taking a selfie is as despicable as Justin Bieber singing a song. You know those cars that won't let you turn the ignition on if they know you're under the influence of alcohol? Well, phones should be installed with a device that automatically shuts the camera down when it detects a male is trying to take a selfie.\n\nIf we're friends (or yeeps), there's no need to take my condemnation as personal. For I hate the sin, not the sinner.\n\nThere are tons of traits that tourists exhibit (which are in abundance at Pier 39) that we can poke fun at, but I'll leave that to others and zero in on selfies, since it's a relatively new epidemic.\n\nStudies show that some of the world's best photographers are Asian tourists and people wearing fanny packs.  There are plenty of both at Pier 39. Yet, some people just can't resist stopping to take selfies in the middle of crowded areas where others are trying to walk by. Like really, it was so important they just had to impede the flow of foot traffic all for a pic with shoddy quality that they'll probably want to retake multiple times.\n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting to have pictures of yourself or with others at touristy spots. I even dare say it's a positive thing.  So, next time you want this, find an Asian tourist or fanny packer and ask them to take the pic for you then step aside from the crowd for it. It will be of a much higher quality and may even capture a memory that you can keep for a life time!\n\nConclusion: Pier 39 has some attractive elements, but much like taking a selfie, the only point I see (in spending time there) is being able to say you did it.\n\nIm my humble opinion, there are better places to visit and take pics at in SF. Search under the \"local flavor\" category and you may stumble across a few finds that provide a more authentic sense of the city.  The only problem is, no one else may be at those places, so you'll be forced with the decision to experience the moment as is and remember it, or, take a dreaded selfie that will be met with my strongest denunciation.", "author": "Brandon C."}

The spaces leave no room for opening the door without nicking the car next to you. \n\nChronic Pain\nThe wood planks can ruin your knees, ankles, back etc. That's on the 2nd floor. I ruined my left knee for the rest of my life by working there. \n\nGood Enough\nPROS - it's a must see for your visiting friends, the shows, the trinket shops, the crab and other seafood, beautiful vistas. \n\n****MUST DO ONCE IN YOUR LIFETIME****\nThe absolute best thing about Pier 39 are the Seals and Sea Lions that swim in and have their own decks to lounge on the left side of the pier. Go towards Neptunes palace - have a meal - ask for Paul D to wait on you (he's excellent and will take care of you) and then go to the left facing the golden gate bridge and just sit there and take in nature for free. I've never seen so many seals and sea lions - they play, push each other off of the decks - it's amazing to watch and experience. \n\nA lot of the restaurants serve good food at fairly - not too out of hand - prices.

Beyond that, Pier 39 is a commercial fueled tourist trap. everything is overpriced, hokey in concept, and forgettable once you buy it. The only redeeming quality is how busy and exciting the crowds usually are. This is a great place for people watching. There are also a few cool things scattered around, like a 5 dollar maze and a staircase that plays musical notes. \n\nThis is the second most overrated part of San Francisco, behind the Trolley rides. The Fisherman's Wharf is worth checking out, but don't spend more than 30 minutes at Pier 39. And what ever you do, don't eat at any restaurants at the Wharf. There are so many good restaurants outside the Wharf (like the Hollywood Cafe)", "author": "Gill S."}

We walked to the area after riding the Powell-Hyde cable car and hopping off at Lombard Street. \n\nPier 39 is a huge tourist trap. It consisted of a boardwalk-style pier lined with expensive souvenir shops and chain restaurants catering to tourists by selling overpriced goods. However, there was a large carousel in the centre of the pier that I enjoyed taking photos of, which was very colourful and beautifully detailed. Pier 39 was basically a large outdoor mall. \n\nWhen we arrived to the pier in the early morning (around 8 AM), there was nobody around and we were the only people there (because the stores/restaurants had yet to open), which was lovely and the atmosphere was quiet and relaxed. However, I can only imagine how busy and crowded this area would be starting in late morning and into the afternoon and evening. As someone who hates crowds and overly touristy areas, Pier 39 is definitely a place that I would avoid at all costs during these times. \n\nMy mother and I only stopped at Pier 39 because we happened to be in the area. Originally, we did not plan on coming here and definitely would not have gone out of our way to include this in our itinerary. \n\nAfter strolling around Pier 39 and taking photos of the interesting carousel, we wandered over to the area of the pier where the sea lions were. For me, this is the only part of Pier 39 that made my visit worth it. There were also great views of the Bay and Alcatraz Island that were worth checking out.  \n\nThere were a bunch of large wooden platforms floating in a section of the Bay with tonnes of sea lions laying on them and piled on top of each other. We watched them for a little while, as they moved around, jumped on and off the platforms into the water and played with each other. It was quite fascinating and I really enjoyed watching them! \n\nYou might like Pier 39 if shopping for overpriced touristy souvenirs, eating at expensive and inauthentic restaurants and battling through crowds of people are things you enjoy. But in my opinion, the only worth seeing at Pier 39 are the sea lions. If you do choose to visit here, I recommend getting there as early in the morning as possible, in order to beat the crowds. \n\nDespite the fact that I enjoyed strolling around the pier in the morning and enjoyed watching the sea lions, I would not return to Pier 39 for a second visit. In my opinion, there are so many more interesting things to see and do and authentic neighbourhoods with character and history to explore in San Francisco. Do yourself a favour and don't waste too much of your time here!", "author": "Brittany T."}

There are also sea lions lunging around the pier near the bottom, where you can always hear their barking which is pleasant to hear honestly. \n\nThe only perk here is the parking, which can be kind of a toughie, considering there are so many tourists walking around here. It is very chilly here so bring a coat and a scarf!! There is a carousel for the children as well as many shops to choose from to shop or window shop at! There are sports memorabilia stores, candy stores, souvenir shops and a fine array of restaurants to choose from to eat.

The honking, smelly but hilarious aquatic mammals are available by the bucketload here. I don't know why they came, but they seem to love canoodling on the floating platforms just... sealioning about and being adorable. \n\nThis was the main reason me and my colleague Cressida ventured down to Pier 39 on a beautiful sunny Friday morning in San Francisco. Despite me getting us completely lost (totally unable to read maps properly), we eventually found this twee tourist hotspot along the waterfront. \n\nThe pier itself is lovely with gorgeous wooden decking, a mix of shops and great decor (and photo opportunities) at every turn. They also have free public toilets and plenty of seating areas so you can stop and take a breath after a good walk around. The food selection here seemed to be very varied with delicious smelling waffle cones, fantastic looking seafood spots and all sorts of cafes and restaurants spread along the length and breadth of the pier. \n\nThe shops and restaurants here did seem expensive, but you don't have to spend anything if you don't want to. As we were here on a Friday morning, it was lovely and quiet; but I can imagine it being very busy with tourists over a weekend. \n\nWhether you're up for a bit of retail therapy (I can recommend \"Hot Licks\", the hot sauce emporium) or just a wander, I can recommend a wander down Pier 39 to enjoy the sealions and the amazing views of the boats and the bay.", "author": "Vicky O."}

It took us a good 45 minutes to find reasonable parking. Since we were not from the area we couldn't find a spot that seemed worth paying more than $40 for. It seemed as though paying to park was going to be a hassle. Especially if you planned to park directly across from the Pier? Forget it. Ridiculous prices. We were able to find a parking garage about two blocks away where we ended up paying $23 for the entire day. Definitely worth it. The Pier itself does have the touristy vibe but it's fun to experiencing especially since you're visiting from another state. We saw the sea lions, had clam chowder in a bread bowl, bought some souvenirs from the myriad amount of shops on property and eventually ended the day with a cruise tour of the Golden Gate Bridge.

It's definitely a spot you would take any tourist or visitor - it's one of my favorite attractions in SF (cheesy as it sounds).\n\nOn a good day, it's actually great to do the walk from Embarcadero to Pier 39 and you can then easily explore that area. It's about a 20-30 min walk but at a leisurely pace where you'd stop to take pics and such. It goes by fast and of course the view is amazing. There are actually a ton of cool spots along the way to get a drink or appetizer. I'd recommend doing that too if it's in the plans.\n\nOnce you get to the Pier there are a few things you can do. There are a ton of eating places so you can do drinks, eat, get dessert or junk food and be touristy and walk around the general area. THere are usually people doing little side acts and tricks - that always attracts a good amount of people! \n\nThe MUST-SEE is the dock where all the seas like and congregate. It's a cute thing to show people visiting - they're always really excited about it! You can get great views too of the water, Alcatraz and what not. If you keep walking down further you run into all the cutesy pier shops, your tourist staples and such. Once you get to Fisherman's Wharf you have to try some seafood - too good not to try!  Almost anything you can imagine so hopefully you can at least sample or share with your group.\n\nIf you keep walking down and end up at the end of the street near Ghiradelli Square there's a great photo opp, as well as that Square which is adorable and you can get your chocolate fix on.

There is nothing unique about most of the restaurants, stores and attractions in Pier 39 (I said \"most\" not \"all\") because you can find almost all of them in any other tourist trap/Middle American suburb throughout the country. \n\nOther than clam chowder bread bowls and views of the Bay, there is nothing about Pier 39 that will give visitors the San Francisco experience. \n\nOverall, Pier 39 is only worth visiting if you have some time to kill, and I would only recommend it for seeing the sea lions and the beautiful views of Alcatraz and the Marin Headlands. \n\nTourists, save yourselves some time and money by visiting neighborhoods that are unique to San Francisco; not some carnival-by-the-Bay tourist trap.\n\nOn a side note about the sea lions: They are NOT as abundant during the summer because most of them go down to Southern California.

It wasn't until I left San Francisco that I realised how awesome this city really is. My boyfriend has never been, so yesterday I took him to do all the tourist-y bits and internally I thought \"oh god here we go to these tourist traps...\".\n\nI haven't been to Pier 39 since I was a little girl, and immediately I was blown away by the cute \"village like\" atmosphere of the place. You have all sorts of people walking around - tourists, locals, people who paint themselves gold, street performers, the works. It seems that as tourist-y as it is, Pier 39 epitomises the vibrant atmosphere San Francisco uniquely possesses that makes it a \"big city\" that is different from the stale and shallow. Sure, we don't have much entertainment or even good weather, but we have something that I can't quite put my finger on... a certain je ne sais quoi as Tyra Banks would say.\n\nWander around the strange and unique shops ranging from a left-handed emporium to a shop created for magnet collectors.

I didn't see garbage laying around and things just felt clean. The stores are your typical tourist stores but they are fun. My favorite part is at the very end of the pier where you can see Alcatraz and watch the ships sail by. We watched the fog come in and surround the Golden Gate. It was a great afternoon and I look forward to going back again soon.", "author": "LeeAnne B."}

As a kid I loved Pier 39, but I was just a kid.  I know why I loved it......Pizza from Sal's, which went out of business many years ago and I enjoyed the street performers.....particularly Bush Man who passed away recently. RIP Bush Man.  I remember standing across the street as a kid with my family and just watching Bush Man scare the shit out of people  Lmao  Awesome as a kid and as an adult.  He had a simple gig that drew crowds and made people laugh.  The street performers who are out there now are really lacking IMO, but if you're a tourist you will love it.  \n\nOne thing that irks me is how the street performers ask for money.  It's begging and it's a turn off.  Some of them have gotten really bad with the begging.  It's like I need money, give me some money, $1 dollar bills are okay....but $5 dollar bills are better...I need to pay my rent....I need the money to come out here and entertain you.....Pier 30 doesn't pay me to do this.  You will hear this or something similar to this and you might hear it multiple times during a show.  I laugh when people just walk away Lol  Focus more on performing and putting on an awesome show.  I think people will tip more.\n\nOn to the restaurants.  There's a lot of restaurants, but are they good?  Meh.  Hard Rock Cafe....oooooh.   Bubba Gumpp shrimp....AHHHHHH.  Lol  Um...no.\n\nI can't review all of the restaurants and everything else at Pier 39....it would take too much time....so I'll wrap it up here.\n\nIf you're a tourist please take my somewhat negative review with a grain of salt.  You should definitely experience Pier 39.  There's something for everyone.  I absolutely recommend taking one of the Bay cruises too.  I still like to do it every Blue moon.  If you're a couple I recommend one of the later cruises at night (romantic) Lol  You can see all of the city lights and skyline and just being on the water.....it's awesome.  Bring a jacket!\n\nAlso, I know people wanna look cute, but to all the women who wear high heels to Pier 39.....you look like a fool  Lol  I can tell your feet hurt and you will pay for it later  haha  Flip flops are a no no too.  If you're smart you'll throw on a pair of sneakers or running shoes.  You definitely want to be as comfortable as possible to enjoy the experience.  Bring a coat no matter the time of year or even the time of day that you are visiting.  Another yelper said to bring a wind breaker.  Yeah...it can get windy, but a wind breaker is like wearing a t-shirt to me  Lol  You might be okay with only a windbreaker during early to mid afternoon in the spring or summer, but that's about it.  Bring a coat  Lol  or you will freeze your butt off.", "author": "Cee B."}

Parking is a total scam, and if youre lucky to not get your windows smashed out and all your contents of your vehicle stolen, then consider yourself lucky. But mark my words, every time you return to this cesspool, you just increased the good odds considerably that it will happen. And dont bother calling the police, they do not care, they will just transfer you to a number that hangs up on you. This is after you get placed on hold for around half an hour or so. The number is for your phone report, that they will try to encourage you to make on line. these are city employees BTW, not law enforcement personnel in any way. Then there is the actual city....The shops and food places are run down and filled with over priced junk, which includes the food at all the strip eating places. The whole area is infested with scum looking for their next fix, and anyway to get it. the touristy areas of this filthy city make you want to shower continuously for a week just to get all the scum off. the streets and sidewalks are congested with bodies, most living clueless tourists, some not moving-possibly sleeping, others look like walking zombies, even others looked so strung out youre not sure what they might do next.

I just stood there for probably 30+ minutes watching them.  Some of them stretch out their neck to sunbathe.  Some try to encroach on territory they know is not \"available\" to them.  Some pose like they want Jack Dawson to draw them like one of his French girls.  Some fight to defend their honor (!!!) and prime real estate.  Some just want to nap.  Some just act like they meant to go swimming when they are pushed off.  Some just complain to each other about \"personal bubbles\" and disturbed naps.  Some try to nurse their bloody battle wounds with the rays of sun.  Plus, there's usually one who just decides he's too old for all of that nonsense and just goes off on one pier all by himself.\n\nPro tip: if you're trying to find pier 39, do not look between pier 38 & pier 40.

A sea lion education centre featuring a genuine sea lion skeleton, and pelts you can stroke enviously.\n\nI've no doubt that the primary goal of Pier 39 is to entrap giddy daytrippers like me, but it does it so marvellously that it's hard not to cast cynicism aside, open one's arms and give oneself over entirely and willingly to the experience. If we'd had longer, I could have stayed all day. I particularly enjoyed the Celtic goods gift shop named Treasure Ireland. That kind of thing is so brazenly good-natured you could tar and feather it and it'd still grin back at you and offer you a bowl of Lucky Charms.\n\nAre you getting that I liked this place? I liked this place. Did I mention the sea lions?", "author": "Cressida F."}

Now, the pier itself is nothing more the shops and a very touristy fountain of kids and adults with fanny packs on holiday, but there are some good aspects to the area.  Some of the shops are really interesting to browse through.  But, the best part of Pier 39 is all the way at the end of of the pier and to the left where there are sea lions all year around that relax in the marina.  You can get some good pictures of the animals and the water.  This is also a good place for pictures of Alcatraz Island.  SO enjoy your visit to Pier 39...\n\nAnd as always... Have Fun!!!", "author": "Christian H."}

So get off me!\n\nHere's how you do Pier 39 right son: \n\nLate afternoon: park ridiculously far away, usually in a lot to the far South or street parking if you have absolutely nothing in your car (otherwise, meth-head zombies will break in and make love in your child's booster seat).  \n\nI walk quickly up past stunning views of Alcatraz into  a horde mass of street performers: metallic painted men posing for photos, young guys spray paining celestial hiphop moonpaper (or whatever you call that) and street musicians until the smell of spray paint and sweat forces me north (or a scam artist approaches telling me he bets he can tell me where I \"got dem shoes\"). \n\nI stop quickly at the Boudin factory to see what crazy sourdough statue is on display today: usually a crocodile or a scorpion made out of 20-100 fused loaves of bread. \n\nThen I stop at Crab Station #2 for my shared bowl of Clam Chowder- don't know if it's the best or if it's milkpowder and silk worm uterus' but I like it and think it's respectable for what it is. Chat it up with the folks hanging at the cart. \n\nI go nextdoor to Sabella & La Torre for a plate of oysters. Last time, they had some newbie kid shucking the oysters and when we asked for horseradish he poured tartar sauce all over our oysters. His boss made it right though and their horseradish is so strong, I love it. \n\nI usually take these around the corner to the boat slips and walk out onto a dock and eat them with 10-20 seagulls watching me with completely seduced anticipation. \n\nYou know you're in the right place if you pass the Musee Mechanique which I think is free and seems totally awesome and why the hell haven't I ever been there?\n\nThe oysters are great and by now the sun should be setting, walk along the water north and spot the Wildman of Pier 39 who hides behind two palm frawns, and then at the precise moment, jumps out and shoots Oooga Booga at unsuspecting tourists, much to the delight of you and 50 other jerks with their iPhones out capturing the moment for prosperity.\n\nThe Golden Gate bridge is beautiful at dusk from the 'beachlet' north of Pier 39, the Buena Vista is just up the road for a great Irish Coffee and Ghiradelli is fun to stop in and get the free caramel sample at the door  and watch people blow their mortgage on ridiculous platters of ice cream. \n\nIt may be touristy but it's totally worth a do, and worth doing right!", "author": "Ryan S."}

It's a typical tourist attraction, i.e. you can tell that the majority of people there are tourists and not native San Franciscans, (Is that correct?) \n\nStill, though, on views alone, it's a must.\n\nIn the distance, across the bay, you've got Alcatraz Island, which sits ominously in a field of blue roving waters and evokes what I can only describe as a creeping dread. Now, I know that sounds awful, but it really isn't. Let's face it: that kind of fear and/or disgust is one of our more primitive and evocative emotions, and it makes for a totally cool experience.\n\nYou also get... seals! Yeah, that's right. Seals. Sitting on a grouping of floating embankments, hundreds of seals sunbathe and make for an interesting sight. It's not something you get to see just anywhere.\n\nThere are, of course, a number of eateries and shops to coax those greenbacks from out your pockets, but this can be expected.\n\nAnd, lastly, if you're looking to take a tour of the city, your best bet is to head here first and jump on one of those two-story, open-air buses. Because San Fran is fairly small, two hours on one of these will afford you the opportunity to see everything from the Golden Gate Bridge to Little Italy to Chinatown to the Haight Ashbury to George Lucas' film studio to --- most importantly! --- the Tanner household from \"Full House.\"\n\nOnce again, be sure that this is a TOURIST ATTRACTION and in no way fully tells the story that San Fran has to tell, but that makes it no less attractive a place to visit, so do yourself the following favor: check-in to your hotel room, grab a cab, head to pier 39, do the touristy thing, and then go find your next adventure on the streets and among the locals.", "author": "William O."}

My sister rolls her eyes every time a new person comes to San Francisco and asks to go to the pier. \n\n1) PARKING. Chances are that if you came from LA you FOOLISHLY DROVE to San Francisco and didn't know that SF, like normal metropolitan cities, has a functioning public transit. but anyways, parking in the closest structure is $8.00 an hour!!! That's two gallons of gas!!! All to see ... \n\n2) OVER PRICED STORES AND USELESS GIFT SHOPS. There's a left-handed shop, one of those \"farm-fresh pearls\", a novelty sock store, and the mandatory San Francisco apparel store. Basically you could transport all of these shops to another place in the world and you wouldn't know the difference, nothing uniquely San Francisco about the shops at about Pier 39. And seriously, $10.00 for a pair of socks? WHY?! \n\n3) Same ol' street performers. The guy covered in silver paint who pretends to be a statue, someone playing steel drums, another playing some kind of weird instrument. You're not fooling anyone when you buy their professionally done CD and say \"Oh I heard this really cool person playing on the street\". They're not true street performers, they got permits and are hired by the city to make you think you're a hippie. Not to say its bad, but don't fool yourself in to thinking you've discovered hidden talent. \n\n3) The only thing worth going to is probably Boudin's... but two other places you could go to that would allow you to have that sourdough bread bowl without trekking over to pier 39. and this Boudin's doesn't validate!\n\nFor TOURISTY San Francisco, better to spend your time at the Golden Gate bridge, Fisherman's Wharf (at least there are more interesting shops and somewhat fresh seafood) , Twin Peaks, and Union Square. meh and I guess Chinatown. They all fulfill your touristy desires while allowing you to spend your time doing more interesting and wallet-friendly things. Please go and explore all the other awesome places in San Francisco!

You can snag a nice view of Alcatraz from Pier 39, and also see a whole flock (group? gaggle?) of sea lions do their thing near the back, all of which you'll want to tell your friends about once you get home.\n\nOther than that, there isn't a ton of depth of attractions here.  It won't leave you wowed, but seeing the pier and sea lions are free, so you may as well enjoy the walk here on a sunny summer day.  Just be sure to go elsewhere for your souvenir shopping.", "author": "Jonathan M."}

There's no actual Freddy, I just made that up.  He's probably a she anyway...well...we are in San Francisco.  Again welcome!  \n\nBesides the kiddy magic show in the back, the sea lions are probably the only other thing that is free at Pier 39.  These wonderfully lazy creatures seem to dazzle the eyes of tourists who come far and beyond.  Walking amongst the crowd of visitors, only one question racked my mind.  What is so interesting about these sea lions to stare at them for even more than a minute?  Understandably for a kid, the allure of something spontaneous happening like a fart or \"animal wrestling\" (mating) would sound exciting.  Yet the crowd was full of adults too.    \n\nAs a native San Franciscan, I just don't get it because I'm from here.  If you saw what I saw with their glowing engaged eyes, you'd swear it was a unicorn out there.  Understandably, California sea lions are native to you guessed it, California.  As since has now worked into becoming a symbol of the pier.         \n\nVenturing into Pier 39, \"you can literally spend half the day there*\".  I put an asterisk next to that first sentence because of the tourist factor.  If you have relatives, friends, or just playing guide to folks out of town, you can easily burn through a good four to five hours with all the shops and restaurants they have.  Bun's favorite is the Candy Baron; that's located in the back near the arcades in the back.  As expected, Candy Baron sells all different kinds of candy.  The aquarium which I haven't been too is at the front.  My remarks on that are nonexistent as I'll probably not ever go though I heard it's great for tourists.        \n\nA view of Alcatraz is the backdrop in the rear where you can sit and relax.  For me this is the best part, watching the water, feeling the wind, enjoying the view while dodging possible seagull dooky bombs from above.  I sincerely felt bad for the kid with the poop tainted overpriced cotton candy.  Minus the latter, this is the best part about Pier 39, the view from the back.  \n\nSo if you're a tourist, come on over and visit Pier 39.  This place is for you.  I mean it; the city of San Francisco literally developed this place to welcome the tourists.  Freddy, the sea lion, will be waiting.", "author": "Arnold T."}

It is the least busiest. (2) Like everywhere else in San Francisco, if you plan to drive, you will end up paying for parking.(2a) On the plus side, the parking garage is right across the street. If you do not want to cross the street, there is a bridge (PHOTO-OP: great view of Pier 39) that connects to the second floor of the pier. \n\nAgain, this is a tourist spot. Pier 39 really caters to the tourist crowd. There are \"photo-op\" signs posted throughout the pier. \n\nThere is tons to see- souvenir and art shops, different types of restaurants and smaller eateries. The shops that caught my attention were:  (1)The Seasons store: This store has decorations for all seasons; especially Christmas!!!! (2)The Left-Handed store.

No thanks, we got one  in Brooklyn, I am sure this one is not much different,  These prices really made me appreciate New York, I must say.\n\nAnyway, I'll be honest, I wanted to see the sea lions. I mistakenly thought they were a part of the aquarium. And the fact that Alcatraz was a no go, and my ok with not going to aquarium, I figured I'll \"stroll\" through the pier. Wow, I thought pier 17 (south street seaport) was bad. At least South Street Seaport has some things to appreciate, an indoor mall, cleaner bathrooms, food court, and some decent places to drink, party, and eat. \n\nPier 39, on the other hand,  is a complete tourist trap - Times Square has more to offer!  I can;t believe I spent as much time as I did there (I was half hoping that there MUST be something there worth seeing).

For whatever reason, left-handed stores are the sign of a tourist trap. \n\nAnd this is precisely the problem with Pier 39. It's a generic tourist trap. If you ignore the bay, it could be anywhere. I've seen the exact same shops at Quincy Market, the same faux-old timey architecture in Santana Row and Epcott Center . . . there is nothing about San Francisco here. Really, does a magnet shop give you anything essentially San Francisco? Or a knife store? (Although, I will admit, my boyfriend kind of liked that place). And wouldn't it make more sense to go to Ireland for ye olde Ireland treasures? (Yeah, the Irish community is important to San Francisco's history, but that's clearly the Thomas Kincaid version of Ireland). Apparently, even two decades ago or so, there was still something of the working pier about it and you could get a sense of the Port of San Francisco and its history. \n\nWe recently decided to play tourist and walk around here. After some weak, overpriced lattes, and a walk past the various generic souvenir shops, I decided that I will probably keep this off the itinerary when I have visitors in the future.

Pier 39 is nestled against the hills of NorthEastern San Francisco. You have views of home covered hills rising above the shoreline and water crashing over Alcatraz Island. It's a very cool place to be. \n\nThe main attraction to this particular Pier is the food, they have everything you could ever want (and being this is where Sourdough was invented you would be a fool not to try it).  Mini donuts, seafood so fresh it actually begs you not to eat it, old fashioned saloon style candy stores, sports bars, smoothies, sushi...I'm serious, you can have anything you want.  I wasn't there often enough to figure out the schedule, but there is a farmers market just down the boardwalk. You walk about half a mile South of the pier and there is the most diverse selection of fresh food you could possibly hope to choose from. It's like walking into a Whole Foods in Heaven.  \n\nPier 39 caters on a professional level to the tourists that need gifts to bring back home. There's an entire gift shop dedicated to Alcatraz memorabilia, several crystal shops, antiques stores, jewelry, art, shells, knives, cigars...once again, just about everything you could ever want. \n\nYou could go to Pier 39 for everything from grocery shopping at the farmers market to a romantic dinner with your sweetheart (they have a restaurant at the end of the pier that is perched over the water on braces..and is only accessible by boat, how awesome is that). \n\nBring a jacket, the breeze off the ocean can get a little uncomfortable. \n\nThanks for reading.", "author": "Zach O."}

However, I have to be honest in saying the shops along the Pier are over-priced and often contain faulty products. For example, I lost my phone charger in the airport on my most recent visit and found a technology shop offering chargers. I asked the man at the desk to point toward a charger that would fit my Galaxy 5S, which he did, and proceeded to pay...$22 dollars for it! Yikes. This wasn't the worst part. When I returned home for the evening and attempted to plug my new charger in, it simply did not work! I returned the following day with the device and was told that all sales are final. Not a happy camper. \nHowever, were this the only incident I could easily over-look it as one bad egg among other vendors. Yet my friend in our group experienced a similar issue. Due to her Irish heritage, her attention was drawn by a cute shop advocating Irish goods. She found a ring that particularly caught her eye and proceeded to pay a whopping $70 for it. Now this price would not have been unreasonable had the stone been real, but later on our trip we came to find that what we thought was a stone was in fact paint over a piece of cheap metal. \nNow Yelpers I must admit, the food was tasty. Our group stopped in at the famous Boddins bakery and partook of the classic clam chowder sour-dough bread bowls, which were heaven. I would however STRONGLY urge you to use caution when making your purchases at the other gift shops.", "author": "Sam M."}

There were always: seafood restaurants, a carousel, a Midway game place, and a pizza-by-the-slice place. Through the years, some of the shops have changed. I remember the Sanrio store that was in the front where a souvenir shop now stands. The Hard Rock Cafe wasn't always there. On the backside, the sea lions- there was a new story that they left and when we visited (april/may 2010), they were back! It's fun watching them. This is a unique fun tourist attraction that I still enjoy coming to, whenever I'm in town. \n\nWe (my husband and I) always stop in the following: Bubba Gump (I introduced this restaurant to him- been going to this one for years, whenever I'd visit- the first time for me was in the mid-late 1990's- if you're early enough you might get a seat overlooking the water) , the candy shop at the back (neat place), the two-level sports store in the middle (I'm always on the lookout for Niners stuff), the various souvenir shops (so many specialty shops!), and recently discovered the San Francisco Music Box Company  (love love love their music boxes and globes- I've got a little collection) store upstairs on the second level- hope that this store sticks around. This was my husband's third time here (3rd trip together) and he still enjoys coming here. Plus, San Diego's Seaport Village doesn't have anything on Pier 39. \n\nIf you're lucky it's sunny, but since it's on the water, still windy, sorry. Don't get my wrong, it's still a nice site to see, even in it's foggy glory. What I am saying is, dress accordingly in layers, so as it gets warmer, you can shed the layers. Since it is popular, expect a large crowd of people. It's huge too, so allow some time to linger at some stores that interest you. It's a family-friendly place with lots of shops and lots of restaurants. And remember, locals and tourists alike partake. BTW, the parking garage right across the way is primo expensive, so we park in another parking garage, buy something at one of the stores, and the ticket is validated.

Yes, it's touristy, but I am a tourist, so hey - show me the way!\n\nThe food we ate at whatever little place that was was, OK.  The atmosphere was nice with the live music from the street performer, I wish the restaurant had turned down their radio - the two were competing against one another.\n\nWe went to the Aquarium - you can see the separate review, but we liked it.\n\nWe enjoyed meandering through the shops, too.  It was a nice afternoon.\n\nThe children were quite entertained by the magician - Jack SpareRibs - that they had there in the evening in the center stage.  The entertainment is free, if you're that kind of person.  We pitched in a few bucks for all the entertainers we saw that we liked (which was pretty much all of them). \n\nYes, everything is overpriced...food, parking, Tshirts... But, aren't all tourist traps?  And have you seen what real estate costs here?  \n\nThe HIGHLIGHT:  If you can find your way to the water, there are sea lions that beach themselves on piers here.  SO COOL.  I gather the locals are less than thrilled, you know, trying to get their boats in and out without killing them.  But, I have never seen sea lions other than in an aquarium or show before and I thought it was magical.  We watched them for hours.\n\nThe down side - it you didn't know there was water on the other end of the pier you'd never figure it out.  All that beautiful bay and it's like the place was designed to hide it rather than show it off.  That's why it got 3 stars.  They should take some notes from the Inner Harbor in Baltimore or Annapolis - we celebrate our beaches, bays and water views on the east coast.  Maybe you Californians just don't realize what you have.\n\n(Oh, and we parked at a lot at Pier 33/35 - just a few blocks.  It was expensive, and more annoyingly, the \"self pay\" machine that takes credit cards does not take credit cards, nor does it give change so you have to have exact change or over pay for parking which is already $35 a day - ouch.  We were there a few days and never had a problem finding parking.)", "author": "Vicky C."}

Oh yes, and a heaping dinner of crab at the Crab House to end the night, along with a glass of wine while watching the sun set over Alcatraz and all of that weird history.\n\nI mean I know we're supposed to be ashamed of places like this, or detest them, or hate what they stand for - or at least to have a healthy hatred of tourists and children.  I must be missing the intellectual rigor to feel most of those things.  It revives my excitement to have grown up in such a special place.  I'm happy I grew up in the Bay Area.  I'm sad I moved away.  I'm happy when I go back to watch visitors and locals alike taking in one of the only things that still exist here from when I was a kid.  The rich tech people have pushed all the rest of us idiots out of San Francisco proper.  This corny shit doesn't sit well with them, I know.  I even married a rich tech dude and might very well end up back in the city someday.

We had already walked through Ghiradelli Square and taken photos of Alcatraz Island.  We were about ready to move on when we spotted a Christmas tree!  I am a huge Christmas fanatic so the sight almost brought a tear to my eye - and suddenly my tired legs felt as though I could endure maybe one more walking excursion.\n\nWalking toward Pier 39 was  a gorgeous site.  It is a must see around the holidays.  So romantic - it felt like Disneyland without the rides.  Thanksgiving night was perfect because it was pretty empty.  Hardly any tourists.  Just a few couples enjoying the lights.  The carousel, tree, and garland made everything so cozy.\n\nWe did all the touristy things.  We took pictures in a photo booth.  We took pictures of the tree.  We took self portraits in front of the carousel.  And never once did I feel bored.  All of the shops and restaurants were open, even on the holiday.  \n\nThe only negative was that being night - it was freezing cold.  Definitely colder than in the city because you're literally right by the water.  I haven't been that cold in awhile - my Arizona blood was not prepared!  But all in all - a magical night.

It really isn't a bad area, infact i would love this area if it hadn't sold itself to tourism. I suppose every city must have some tourist attraction though, and sadly in Frisco they all flock to the pier. I will still enjoy coming around here on occasion when i am with someone because it can be quite enjoyable. However coming here on my own to enjoy the view is incredibly unlikely unless its far away from the main area where there are no shops, or later in the evening when the shops start closing. Hard to enjoy this area and feel calmed on a nice day with the constant strollers, crying children, and ignorant people you have to constantly dodge. Unfortunate, but i could still enjoy this area on awkward times or days when there are alittle less of them around. \n\nLiving in Union Square has made me get tired of tourists quite quickly. If you are looking for a nice ocean view with actual good and modestly priced food that is not cluttered with women popping babies or hundreds of Frisco T-Shirt stands *seriously how many of them do you need possibly need* then explore the rest of Frisco.

Lots of great picture opps there and plenty noisy!\n\nThe entertainers seem to be more vocal on what they want to be paid these days... on all my previous visits to San Francisco, I never remember any street performer saying how much of a tip would be appropriate.

The photo opportunity alone will keep you there for hours. There are tons of places to eat. It's almost over-whelming. At the end of the pier are the famous sea lions and now there is a museum dedicated to them right there. The is the Aquarium by the Bay and rides and an arcade and a wine tasting place and of course tons of gift shops. You can take tours of Alchatraz and the bay. The Pier, as I said offers a great view of the bridge, and Alchatraz and Angel Island. There is a merry go round and performers put on live shows all over the place. You could spend the whole day in that area easily. Take a jacket. It gets windy especially at night. Good luck in finding parking though.

That's What you get when you live in NorCal or SF, deal with it!\n\nThere are tons of places to eat, especially my favorite: Bubba Gumps! There's a huge Ferris Wheel in the middle that's $3 per ride, or $5 for two riders. The only draw back is in order for parents to ride with their kids, you must pay also... No free rides!\n\nThe sea lions are always a fun attraction (when they're present). Many don't know that they all left without reason almost a year ago an still have yet to return. I went today and saw about 5. Definitely not the usual 100+ I've been used to seeing all my life.\n\nAlso be prepared to get ripped off for parking! This is SF so I'm used to it, but the Pier 39 garage gives you 1 hour free only if you eat at a sit down restaurant. Then $8 per hour, with a $36 daily max, so tourist plan ahead!\n\nPier 39 is always a fun family friendly place! Enjoy your time here.", "author": "Blake C."}

There are tours available all around, street performers which are very good, and novelty and gift shops of all kinds.

The sign said it was $10. \n\nSo, he reluctantly puts a $20 bill into the machine because none of us really want to be there. Then we look at another sign next to the machine: \"Machine does not give change.\" \n\nWHAT? He just put $20 to park at a horrible, hellish tourist trap of a place, that will only further drain money if we choose to eat a bunch of donut holes and submit to the $3.50 for bottled water. HATE IT.\n\nWhy do people go here? All there is is a bunch of chain stores and chain restaurants selling you crap you don't need. You can go anywhere in the city and you go there? Argh. \n\nI don't know man. I just hate it.  \n\nAlthough I will give it one star because I did have a good time here, once. We went to that horrible Mexican restaurant, La Salsa. We ordered beer and margaritas, and sat out on the balcony where there was a fantastic view of the bay. The best part: The restaurant was practically empty. The service there was horrible though. \n\nEverything about Pier 39 is horrible, except for the view.", "author": "Kat M."}

But it's one of those tourist traps that can also serve even the most local of locals well, if you're looking for what they've got! Here are FIVE THINGS YOU SHOULD KNOW before visiting Pier 39: \n\n1) Maybe I'm jaded. Maybe I'm just cheap. Whatever... $7 per hour is WAY too much to charge for parking. Shame on you, Pier 39. That's just greedy. \n\n2) Sea lions? They smell. No... really. They SMELL.\n\n3) Come hungry and get yourself some clam chowdah in a Boudin Sourdough bread bowl. Don't even consider passing this up. It's edible San Francisco. \n\n4) Don't miss Pery Kids, a very cool store with handmade Peruvian clothes for the little ones. Reasonable prices. Yes, I realize that handmade Peruvian clothes really don't have a lot to do with being a tourist in San Francisco... but don't let that steer you away. I saw one hand-knit sweater with a cable car on it that'd be WAY cooler than the same ol' cheesy \"I Escaped from Alcatraz\" stuff.\n\n5) It's deceptively clean, but don't let that fool you.

It's a good place to kill time before going to Alcatraz, and it's always fun to watch the sea lions.\n\nThat said, it's not somewhere you want to go more than a few times.  It's just too tourist-y, too expensive, and too...predictable.  If you've been to Navy Pier in Chicago or Fisherman's Wharf in Monterey (or any of many other tourist-y waterfront places around the country), you know what to expect here.  Overpriced restaurants.  Candy stores with lots of \"ooh look at this\" novelties and a halfway decent fudge counter.  A few hot dog stands.  T-shirt stores.  And so on...\n\nOn a warm spring weekday with few tourists around, Pier 39 can make for a lovely afternoon.  On a typical cold and crowded San Francisco summer weekend day, it's sheer misery. \n\nPro tip: If you have to park and you have to eat, use the garage immediately across from Pier 39 and don't forget to get your parking validated at the restaurant.

I wasn't too sure what to expect here but let me just start off by saying that if my time wasn't limited, I would have wanted to stay here longer.  There's something here for everyone.  They have a magic shop, sports souvenirs/memorabilia stores, lots of places for getting food, rides, gift shops, and more. One of the places that I went to was the Sea Lion Center which is located on the second floor towards the end of the pier.  It's like a little museum and information center about the sea lions that you can hear from just outside on the docks, and best of all, it's free!  Speaking of the sea lions, I was there in mid-July which we found out was when most of the sea lions that would typically be found on the docks were down south in the Santa Barbara area.  Luckily, we were greeted by a four sea lions who had shown back up and happened to lay on the docks closest to the pier (well, people probably feed them even though you're not supposed to...). Plus, there was one harbor seal, which isn't as common also sun bathing on the docks.  Besides checking out the sea lions and the little museum, we went to Trish's Mini Donuts and the Only in San Francisco gift shop. Just as a tip, it can get very windy on the pier, even though there are buildings on either side of you, and it is so crowded if you're with a group, wear bright clothing in case you get separated. Even though this place is extremely touristy, that's no excuse for you to not go here and experience for yourself, especially if you yourself are a tourist, which was my case.", "author": "Michael G."}

We may even come back next year. \n\nA few things you should know that I learned today. \n\n1.) Parking lots/garages cost a lot more than they usually do. The closer you are to the pier the more expensive. I always park in the same area and the lot I always go to is usually cheap (under $10 for a whole day). So we drove there today and they were charging $40. There were others for $18, $30 and $60. There is also metered parking around the Pier but its hard to actually find one that's open since people get out there early. You just have to be lucky. There is also metered parking on Embarcadero (along all the gift shops, restaurants....) BUT during the 4th of July they post up \"NO PARKING\", this is because they block off the street. \n\n2.) Not sure if they do this every year but they block off Embarcadero st. at a certain time. At the beginning of Pier 39 to about a block down from where the old Hooters used to be. \n\n3.) Boudin Bakery throws freshly baked bread into the crowds randomly throughout the day. While all the regular street vendors set-up their stuff in the middle of the street. There's a clown lady that has entertainment and animal balloons for the kids, spray paint art, guys that draw cartoon pictures of you, break dancers that think they're buff, acrobatic performers, old guy doing some cool magic tricks, guy playin' his saxophone, live scheduled performances by various artists in front of the Hard Rock, and of course the legendary Bush Man----(if you have no idea who this is, I don't want to spoil it for anyone so you'll just have to head out there and hopefully be one of the lucky people that get to surprisingly get the chance to met him.)\n\n5.) Fireworks are lit from 2 different locations at each end of the Pier. So no matter where you are on the Pier or just on Embarcadero street where all the shops are, you will see the fireworks show. Obviously, if you want front row seats/spot...plan to come about 2 hours before the show to secure a spot closest to the water. This is the best seat in the house!\n\n6.) The Pier's shops close a bit later (11pm) so you have the chance to shop around once the fireworks are done. Keep in mind the streets are flooded with cars and pedestrians so getting out of this particular area will take longer than usual. \n\n7.) I've read complaints here on how it smells and how there are bums around but really....That's not something worth writing about. Common sense...YOU'RE AT THE PIER, surrounded by a large body of water and there are many outdoor food stands that sell cooked seafood....does it really surprise you that it sometimes has an unpleasant smell? As far as the bums go, they don't bother anybody so why should it bother you? You are in San Francisco and the bum rate is pretty high. \n\n8.) Just had to mention that Ghiradelli Square is a few blocks up so that's worth checking out if you've never been. They serve ice-cream and a large assortment of their chocolates for all you chocolate lovers. \n\nOverall I had an good experience being here on the 4th of July. The key here is to plan ahead so good luck and just have fun out there and STAY WARM!\n\nSo last thing you need to know...if you're from SF you know but for those that aren't it's FREEZING out here at night because you're by the water so bring your winter coats. (I'm serious.) You can wear whatever you want during the day, bask in that sun and enjoy the breeze...but once it starts getting later and darker that breeze gets cooler and cooler and then it's just plain cold. \n\nMy essentials: thick Northface jacket, gloves and scarf. For the kids: Thick coats, gloves, beanies AND if they are in the stroller, please please PLEASE bundle those babies up and add a blanket for extra warmth, if they're in a baby car seat cover up the top with a blanket. If you have toddlers that sit in a stroller, just bring an extra blanket so that they can keep warm. I've seen young babies out here at night with no socks on, shorts even and their faces look ICE cold and I pray that they won't get sick. My kids are in fleece lined jeans (found at Old Navy) and my older daughter still says she's cold. \n\nSo keep the weather in mind and come prepared.", "author": "Just Meeh B."}

One of the places I tend to visit while there is the candy shop that has all sorts of varieties of candy to choose from.

A good place to take a stroll up and down and around.  There's also one of those bouncy trampoline things there.

It must have been a miracle, considering how many people there were.\n\nWe walked around and visited most of the shops in Pier 39. Nothing was particularly interesting, and we browsed some of the restaurant menus to decide on a place for dinner. We did, however, watch a magician's performance, which was quite amusing, and we gave him a few dollars since he claimed that it was his only source of income for the show. \n\nWe ended up walking over to Ghirardelli square, and came back about an hour before fireworks started. The place was already getting really packed, but we got lucky and found some box-like benches on the left-side of the pier. Within an hour, the firework show had started, and they were absolutely gorgeous. The fireworks were set off extremely close to the pier, and we had a terrific view. Definitely the best July 4th I've had.\n\nAfterwards, we walked back to our car, which was when the problems began. There were people all over, walking across the streets, the sidewalks, pretty much everywhere. To make matters worse, they had blocked off parts of our street, so it took us nearly 20 minutes just to drive a single block.

It's because I have discovered the secret.\r\n\r\nI recently visited Fisherman's Wharf on a Sunday morning at 8:00am.  It was a beautiful sunny but crisp fall day --- one of those days that reminds you how glorious the weather can be here.  I was waiting to get on a ferry and as I waited, coffee cup in hand, I wandered the largely deserted wharf area.  Eventually I found myself all the way out on the end of the long wooden pier at Pier 41 that parallels Pier 39.  As I wandered out, I could hear the occasional barking of the sea lions lolling on the floating docks, the lap of waves on the pilings and distant ring of the channel marker buoy bells.  It was a gorgeous day --- the marine layer was retreating back through the Golden Gate and Angel Island and Alcatraz lay in full sunlight while the bridge was still swathed in clouds.  I stood on the end of the dock, alone except for a couple of fishermen, and then I turned around to go back.  \r\n\r\nWOWZA!  The city on all her glory!  This is quite probably one of the best views in the city, and I never knew because I don't come down here.  From the pier the hills spread out in front of me --- Telegraph, Nob, Russian --- and the edges of the Financial District and Ft Mason peeked over the tops of the wharf buildings.  \r\n\r\nEvery once in a while the pressure builds and I wonder why I still live here.  The cost of living is outrageous.  The press of so many people can become unbearable.  The hordes of tourists try my crowd-hating soul.  Every time I think 'enough, I'm moving!' I find something or someplace that reminds me of just why I stay.  On one Sunday morning at 8:00am that something was Pier 39 at Fisherman's Wharf.  So --- four stars.", "author": "Suzanne B."}

I stay away from all (most) things tourist, and when tourists actually ask me where they should go, I send them to not so touristy places like the Mission.   It is however, hard for me to hate on the Pier.\n\nThis is where i came and met up with my first boyfriend when he started college in Berkeley.  I came up to visit from San Diego, and we spent our one day in SF on the pier.  Oh to be 18 again, and find the pier romantic....watching the seals, trying on goofy hats, and riding the carousel.  Now its all a little cliche', but i could see it being kind of cute with the right guy.\n\nFlash forward a few years, and I move to the city, without a job, so the first thing i think to do is try applying to the restaurants on the pier.  I mean, they get a lot of business right?  After getting denied a job at Bubba Gumps (thank god),   Hard Rock Cafe starts my life off in the city as the first job i had.  I didn't know any better!  I didn't realize how much amazing food this city had to offer!  I was still kind of a tourist myself.  I remember my interview, sitting on a bench outside, admiring the spirit everyone had on the pier, and stumbling over my words, because i though that my interviewer was hot. Soon after i started dating management (the interviewer), and he turned into the first boyfriend i had in the city, and first live in as well.  It obviously didn't last, but the memories from him and the HRC are still up there in some of  my favorite memories.  \n\nYes, I still bring tourists that are visiting me here....i mean, its sort of a staple, isn't it?  Its like visiting Paris and not going to the Eiffel Tower, or visiting Rome and not going to the Colosseum.  The wharf, and the Pier exist for tourists, and as long as I realize this....i can hang there on occasion.\n\nLocals know better.  Locals now know how to scare tourists on the Pier.  A prime example is the Bushman.  He is a street performer who jumps out from behind a plant, holding a bush, and scares the bejezzus out of unsuspecting tourists.  These now newly scared tourists will stand around and wait for him to do it to someone else.  It takes on a life of its own.  Locals, including myself, last Christmas time, participated in Santacon, and hundreds of people were dressed like Santa, scaring tourists.  The look on the pier-goers faces, seeing all these Santa's, some in fishnets, chaps, or nothing but a hat was priceless.  That is when the pier is fun for me now.  When i realize I'm a local, and that its not much fun hanging out with a bunch of gawkers....its only fun if you are the one being gawked at.\n\nYes I used to be a tourist.  I don't want to say I'm too cool for the pier....but, yeah...I'm too cool for the pier.  It will still get 4 stars from me though.  Its done me right so far.", "author": "Lauren F."}

Shops ranged from jewelry stores, a hat store, a Lefty store and stores carrying  handcrafted gifts, mementos, and stained glass.  There were several restaurants (Bubba Gump, Crab House, Hard Rock Cafe, Sea Lion Cafe), but also quite a few small eateries/snack shops to get a quick treat.  I was tempted to get a pretzel, mini donuts, and a crepe, but lunch was our next stop (and I had just eaten a bagel) so I refrained.  \n\nThe sea lions, right beside Pier 39, seemed to be a big draw for tourists.  We had to wait a while to get a clear view, and also to get out of the way of people taking pictures.

I say \"we\" because my whole department works right directly across the street. So we live the ugliness and the glory that is Pier 39 on a daily basis. Hence 2.5 stars -- it's an average of the high and low points.\r\n\r\nHigh Points:\r\n\r\n#1. Definitely the Sea Lions ~ an open air animal behavioural study 24-7. Worth a few laughs every time the big seal belligerently claims the raft for his very own.\r\n\r\nI love that the Sea Lions are now the number 1 attraction at the Pier for everyone and that it's free. And that the Pier tried desperately and cruelly to remove them until they realized how good it was for business. Says everything.\r\n\r\n#2 high point? Gosh I have to think about this. The $1 Coffee, my coworkers would say (Starbuck's, so I wouldn't) at the Crepe place. The $1 deal is just for people who work nearby, so forget it if you work downtown ; )\r\n\r\n#3 The Landscaping. No kidding. I was a landscaper for 11 years and I appreciate (deeply, I should write them a note) the good diversity of beautiful and often native plants that they take such good care of. And in that area on the South side of the pier are really nice benches near lovely plantboxes where a tired worker can take a nap in the sun.\r\n\r\n#4 I'm putting this one in for my friend who celebrated her lunchtime bday there - Turbo Ride!! (truthfully I didn't like it...but this is written with my entire dept. in mind). \r\n\r\nLow Points:\r\n\r\nEverything else ~ the crowds, the bad and expensive foods, the horrible shops....the terrible crooners broadcasting their sounds to the crowd at large. The Blue Angels (Ai!); the perfume wars;  the totally annoying way that the tourists ride Muni ~ Stay away from the F car at this end of SF when it's tourist time (before 8am is generally safe)\r\n\r\nOh and I've been dying to say this.

They're harder to see in the dark, but daytime and sunset are excellent for photo opportunities. The evening creates an area ripe for late-nate smooching to the tune of barking sea lions... Yeah. It doesn't do it for me, but apparently it floats some peoples boats, so there you go. \n\nIf you're touristing or dragging your favorite tourist around-- the sea lion visit isn't complete without a bread bowl of hot stuff from Boudin's. Skip the one on Pier 39 and hit up the one on Jefferson St. It's bigger, provides bakery tours, sells more trinkets, and feels a little more open.

If you can stand a little 'character' a visitors berth here puts you in the heart of what is happening on the shore of San Francisco Bay. Bring some good dock lines and a couple of bungees for your power cord. Pretend you are sailors. You will be in walking distance of The best hot fudge Sunday on the Planet ( Ghirardelli Square),  An world class cracked crab lunch (Fishermans Warf), the Balclutha tour (historic boat museum on the Hyde Street Pier), and the cable car turn about. Walking the other direction you can explore the newly renovated Pier sections. Among the many, and varied, restaurants available right at the Pier, we always visit the Crepe Caf\u00e9 early morning before the crowd starts to build.

Where else are you going to go and see piles of wild sea lions less than a hundred feet away for free at a moments notice? Lately the docks that were once filled have mostly been empty and only 3 of them have been occupied by sleeping and barking sea lions squirming around but it's still fun to check out if you haven't been. Luckily the pier that goes along the water is long enough that there's plenty of room to check them out without having to push your way through anyone. In addition to the sea lions Pier 39 is probably the best place to see Alcatraz (unless you're actually going there). If animal watching isn't really your thing or you've seen it enough then Pier 39 has a large dual layered courtyard with lots of snacks, restaurants, and shops to check out. Even if you don't want to eat or buy anything it's still fun to walk through on a nice day and window shop or people watch.

They said it was against the law to be naked in public but they didn't enforce it.  We decided to be more vigilant and try and shield our young daughter from being exposed to older naked men.

Free show for public viewers. In the Show, they might do Magic or dangerous stunt, it just matters what day and hour, you go. The Carousel horses are a great treat for the kid. It kinda has a long line and a bit expensive. Talking about treats for kids, there are two stores worth noting. One is Crazy Hat Store, where you can check out weird strange hats and the magnet store.  If you get hungry, there are a number of cafe like Bubba Gump Shrimp (expensive as hell). MOMMY ALWAYS SAY LIFE IS A BOX OF CHOCOLATE, YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT YOU GOING TO GET!!! YES THAT BOX IS EXPENSIVE!!!  Then there is the sea lions which looking at them at period of time could make you as lazy and as sleepy as those sea lions. LOL. Are we watching them or are they watching us??? They honestly don't do anything and is kinda boring. It's like watching fat ppl on the beach! They sit around. Go see the Aquarium of the Bay. Why see that!

Yes, somewhere in Pier 39 is one of those rip off arcade places where you play for tickets to win some prizes (usually a pencil or a neon colored rubber band).

Tourists spend tons of money to see the most popular sights in the city and from Pier 39 they get their money's worth.  Yes the restaurants are overpriced but the food is generally good and the views are second to none.  The shows are a great place to take kids and let the parents rest for a while.  The arcade is a little cheesy but for little kids its a fun place to play after spending the day with mom and dad sightseeing in a not so kid friendly city.  Locals relax.

They have a pumpkin patch and kids under 12 get to pick a free pumpkin.  They're pretty good-sized pumpkins too.  And most of the stores participate in trick-or-treating, so the kids get lots of stuff and it's safe.  Go early though because if you go toward the end, almost all the stores have no candy left.  I hate the parking garage though.  It's so slow.  I swear I spent 30 minutes in there just trying to get to the top to get a spot!  And it's $6 an hour.

They have chocolate meat cleavers!

I like to get an ice cream cone at Ben and Jerry's and window shop all the way down the dock, then take my time stopping in at places on the way back.

It's still packed with tourists and locals alike. The shops are pretty touristy and the food is so-so. But it's definitely one of those places you kind of have to go to in SF if you are a tourist or a local wanting to rediscover your city. Be sure to say hi to the sea lions if they're in town : ). If you go, be sure to walk all the way to the end so you can get that great view of Alcatraz and the Bay. This is also in the immediate vicinity of the tours that leave for Alcatraz and the other Bay tours. There is a parking lot across the street. You may be able to find street parking nearby, but I would not recommend it. If you're feeling adventurous and are willing to make the trek, you can walk up toward the Ferry Building and the Embarcadero area for more sights and shops.", "author": "Al B."}

It's just a pier with a bunch of touristy shops and restaurants, but for those coming for the first time, hopefully this will provide a glimpse of what to expect:\n\n-Walk along the Embarcadero to get to the pier and you'll get caught up in at least one or two street performer acts. No where else will you see free \"talent\" like this on display. You can also see acts on the stage at the end of the pier.\n-Enjoy the Aquarium of the Bay. It's small, but unique in that it lets you walk through a glass tube with the fish all around you, so you get to see sharks and stingrays literally swim over your head.\n-Buy a fruit and grande marniere crepe with whipped cream at the Crepe Cafe (midway on your left) and take it to the right side of the pier. Sit on a bench and enjoy the view of the yachts and your dreams of owning one some day...\n-Walk to the far left of the pier and enjoy the sea lions. It's nice to watch animals in nature rather than in a tiny exhibit at a zoo.\n-Try some Ghiradelli chocolate.\n-Dine. Focus on your friends and the views and ignore the fact that the food may not be so great.\n-Treat your child to a ride on the carousel near the rear of the pier ($3 a ride--I wish I owned this baby!)\n\nWhat the heck.
