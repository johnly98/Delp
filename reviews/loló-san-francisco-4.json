Luckily we were too far off, when we arrived I think we waited 5 minutes.\n\nThe place was jamming ... it was completely packed.\n\nWe started with a round of yummy margaritas .. and then food !!!!!!\n\nThey then gave us the house chips and the amazing salsa ... we loved it .. we ended up asking for 3 more orders of chips and salsa .. thats how good it was.\n\nWe ordered queso fundido - melted cheese with fresh mushroom ... really yummy\nfollowed by papas bravas ... potatoes in a nice and mild sauce .. again yummy. We then ordered Guacamole which was really good. Shishito peppers ... that were nice and crunchy. \n\nMeanwhile the service was awesome ... everyone we encountered was great and friendly. Perfect service !!!!!\n\nFor our main plates we ordered the pork belly salad, 2 orders of fish tacos, and an order of carnitas ... the fish tacos were amazing .. the pork belly was just perfect and the carnitas was nice and toasty and crunchy. \n\nIt was an overall great and awesome experience .. I truly enjoyed it and will not hesitate to come again. \n\nAs for prices ... well its above average for Mexican food, but this isn't your cheap Mexican food it's very good on the border of high end/gourmet Mexican food, totally worth it.\n\nFood was a perfect 10 out of 10 for us. The drinks was 10 out of 10 and service was 10 out of 10.", "author": "Jimi L."}

Were seated immediately, waters came quick, good food to follow. Very reasonably priced!\n\nGuacamole - i like it a lot, not spicy, no tomatoes and shit, just a good guac. I prefer a little more lime or maybe a lil more onion for flavor but still good. \n\nshishito pepper was a no go for me. the peppers were spicy!!! I usually dont mind the spice, I actually love the heat, but I am not cool with heat that lacks flavor. This is a MISS!\n\nTropical Taco 10 stars! must get! kill yourself if you dont get this, even if you are allergic to shrimp. this is so good that it's worth risking your life. I am so serious. So it's a bit on the sweet side, the mango salsa contributed to that. The shrimp were perfectly fried. crunchy but not hard to bite. you know how some shrimp taco has really good fried shrimp that will hurt your gum if you take a too big of a bite? these are just right! I'm telling you, this is THE SHRIMP TACO YOU WILL EVER NEED IN YOUR LIFE! and you can THANK ME LATER *Drake's Voice*\n\nTuna Tacon was also yummy, I like the soysauce/Tuna twist, but the tropical was just that much better for me. You should still get this if you like tuna, not canned Tuna, real real tuna. it's still rare on the inside. this is the true marriage of sushi and taco.\n\nMy second favorite has to be the mushroom EMPANADAS!!! so cheesy, yet light and flavorful. It's hot when you break it open, you can taste the mushroom in every bite. this is a must get! It also has corn inside. the flavor was really exceptional.\n\nthe three cheese tlacoyo was too healthy for me. Too many veggie on top scared me! lol what are all these? The green beans on top were ok. I picked off a few things, not for my taste buds.\n\ndrinks were good too ;) I will definitely bring more dates here LOL", "author": "Kris J."}

They serve one small chunk of good part of meat, and the rest is over-fried hard scraps. Even the edible part was completely lacking in flavor.\nBut I just couldn't believe they charge $20 for this crap!!\nI am really calling this \"crap\" because that's how low of quality the meat was and I couldn't believe they served this.\n\nBtw ceviche was good but you will find this dish with more diced radish than actual fish. I was like, did I order ceviche or a radish salad???\n\nThe waiter kept forgetting to bring us chips even after he said he was going to. \n\nOver all, no good value for the price you pay.

You could really taste the mushroom and poblano pepper.\n\nCALAMARI AND OCTOPUS GORDITAS blue corn masa with squid ink, avocado, habanero crema: A little messy but really good.

The fish fillet is seared to the perfect level without being dried, then paired with avocado, cilantro, and a magical sauce. Best tacos ever!! The Ceviche was so fresh with lots of shrimp and fish.

It's a small place with some bar seating, kitchen bar seats, and a few tables. It got busy fast.\n\nThe best thing about tapas is that you can try little bits of everything. My cousin and I ordered:\n\nTaco Tropical- The flavors reminded me of eating a miso based salad dressing. Pretty tasty and interesting.\nTuna Tacon- Yum! Can't go wrong with seared tuna.\nChicken Tinga Tostados- Confit chicken had a good kick to it. My cousin really enjoyed this one.\nA la Diabla shrimp- The taste of this reminded me of this one Korean soybean soup. This dish came out last, which I felt was the perfect ending to our meal.

The tuna tacon tacos came with a piece of seared albacore tuna, along with a slice of avocado, aioli, and tomatillo sauce on flour tortillas. The flavors were just bursting, and the wonderful juiciness of the fish really stood out. The taco tropical came with panko-dusted shrimps with relish and spicy aioli, served on a \"jicama\" tortilla.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-03-13", "description": "Interesting vibe inside and great selection of tapas!  A bit loud for my taste but food was tasty enough.  Came here on a Wednesday night with an 8pm reservation.  \n\nVenue / Service: it tends to feel a bit crowded, especially when the bar is open at night, making it difficult to hear conversations.  In fact, we were sitting next to people who were shouting so loudly I had a hard time hearing what my date was saying.  Otherwise, the interior has a somewhat hipster feel to it, with lot of knick-knacks on the walls and blazers sewn into the seats on the wall.  Service-wise, the waiters came promptly to bring out food though it was sometimes difficult to wave them down if you needed something else, like your check.  \n\nFood: what stuck out was the decent selection of tapas... probably the most versions of tacos I've seen in a while that we had a hard time choosing which ones to get!\n-- CEVICHE (shrimp and rock fish citrus roasted pepper sauce, avocado, corn nuts)($14) - slightly sour for my taste, but at least it covered up any fish taste/ smell that might turn people off from ceviche in general.  The fish was cooked a good amount that you knew it wasn't just sitting around in a vat of liquid, and had a decent refreshing quality to it.\n\n-- EMPANADAS (portobello mushroom, poblano pepper, oaxaca cheese, corn)($9) - one of our favorites of the night, perhaps because we haven't had a \"veggie\" empanada before.  Liked how there wasn't too much cheese and that the inside didn't feel too dry either.  The poblano pepper added a good amount of kick, which the mushroom and cheese mellowed out.\n\n-- TUNA TACON (seared albacore tuna shellfish aioli, avocado, roasted tomatillo sauce on the side)($12) - this was our favorite taco of the two we ordered.  The tuna was cooked well and the tomatillo sauce added a great acidity to the taco.  The avocado was good in mellowing out that kick.  \n\n-- FISH TACOS (catch of the day, hand made corn tortillas, habanero, crema, peanuts and piquin pepper sauce)($11) - fish was fried well so that it was not overcooked inside but still crispy on the inside.  A bit spicy for my taste with the habanero, so thank god for the crema to balance it out.\n\n-- BIRRIA SLIDERS (braised grass fed beef flap steak in roasted dry pepper broth, garlic mayo, brioche bun with shoestring potatoes)($12) - another favorite of ours that night!  The birria had a slight kick to it, but was quite tender and delicious!  The only thing was that the bun was rather large so I ended up taking the top bun off and eating it open-face style.\n\n-- DULCE DE LIMON (key lime pudding w/ Mexican vanilla cookie layers)($8)- unfortunately a miss for us.  The pudding was a tad on the sweeter side than I would have liked and the cookie layers were a bit much / confusing.  Would have been better if they included 1-2 layers as opposed to the 4 we got- the overall mouthfeel was like sand once you hit that cookie layer.\n\nA bit hectic for my taste, but I enjoyed the food enough and I'd be willing to go back!", "author": "Audrey H."}

We happened to score two seats at the bar when we walked in but noticed within a few minutes several people were waiting for tables.\n\nWe started with drinks (negra modelo, love when they have more than buds on draft, and a sangria which my wife said was good but tasted florally). The bartenders were attentive and very busy.  They seemed to be making craft cocktails nonstop (a lot of which looked interesting yet pretentious).\n\nFor two of us we shared 3 plates:\nThe ceviche- this was just ok in flavor. I really like the tostadas with them and the portion was quite large compared to most orders however there was a lack of seafood in the dish. I would not choose to order this again especially since they gave us chips and salsa to start which I was unaware of when I ordered.  \n\nFish tacos- these were great. They had a really large and tender piece of fried fish on a homemade corn tortilla topped with a slaw and a delicious sauce.  I really enjoyed these but they were a little too spicy for my wife.\n\nCornbread- this was delicious. This actually came late after we had finished all the rest of our food and drinks and were getting really full. I thought they had forgot about it which would have been fine because we were stuffed. However, they did end up bringing it out and I am glad they did. This was the most moist piece of cornbread I have ever had.  Even after being stuffed I still enjoyed it. My wife preferred to scrape off all the toppings and just enjoy the bread itself. Either way, I would recommend this.", "author": "Danielle B."}

The restaurant itself was narrow but roomy and jam packed with people inside and waiting outside, which raised our expectations even more. Decor was adorable, cute random knick knacks and bright colors created a fun and quirky fiesta vibe Food was a modern fusion of American and Mexican food. Maybe my friend and I ordered the wrongs things...BUT we just didn't get an awww amazing foodgasm moment by any specific dish. It was good by all means, but it just wasn't amazing.\n\nLet's dig in:\n\n(1) House chips and salsa - fresh house chips came our warm and crispy just the way i like it! lightly and perfectly salted and the sauce were mild spicy overall and tasty.\n\n(2) Brussel sprouts - my fave dish here! Super fried and crispy with a nice glaze overall, the taste was light and although there was prob. a great amount of butter - the light vinaigrette sauce cut the taste in a nice way.\n\n(3) Shrimp tacos - large panko fried shrimp were unique and tasty, but what made this dish even more unique was the JICAMA taco shell. The jicama was def. refreshing and added a unique texture to it overall - would def. order this again!\n\n(4) Fish tacos - disappointing overall, the fresh house tortillas were good and the fish was fried to perfection and well seasoned - BUT was unfortunately was drowned in the dressing like house sauce, WHICH although was good was just too much overall. \n\n(5) Empanadas - stuffed with mushroom, pepper, cheese, and corn = a delish and perfect OOEY GOOEY interior. Although the exterior was a little too fried and dry for me, but it was still still good.\n\n(6) Tortilla soup - weirrrrrdddddd...in a no bueno way. This was not a SOUP at all my friend. it was a freakn dipping sauce! This soup was so THICK we pretty much just dipped our chips in it throughout the night, since it was the only way we could actually eat it... Just too thick and slightly cold, AND the flavor itself was just smoky and not tasty in any particular way.\n\n(7) Heatwave cocktail - yummmmm! Super citrus and refreshing with a generous fresh mint touch.

The salsas here were wonderful -- spicy and flavorful. For a drink, we ordered the Michelada -- this beverage had a kick!

The ceviche was a surprisingly generous portion and tasted super fresh. Since I'm a big fan of seared tuna, I LOVED the tuna tacon. The aioli on top adds the perfect flavor.

My absolute favorite two things here are the Tuna Tacon and the Lamb Sliders. Cooked to absolute perfection. \n\nThe Tuna Tacon comes with roasted tomatillo sauce, and it makes my mouth water. The tuna is seared to perfection. It's on the rare side so if you're like ANTI raw anything, then yeahh this might not be for you. If you get it well done, you'll destroy the whole dish. Go to Mcdonalds and get a fish fillet then. ANYWAY, best thing ever. \n\nFor the Lamb Sliders, it can get a bit messy so maybe avoid this on a first date.

The dish was cooked with mint and I usually hate mint, but it wasn't overpowering, so I didn't mind it too much. \n-diabla shrimp: yum.

The restaurant's decor is very interesting, definitely in character for the attitude and the experience.\n\nWe had a bunch of small plates washed down with a bottle of Cava.\n\nThe Ceviche was easily the best dish- extremely fresh, perfectly marinated and just so delicious I couldn't stop eating it even after the other, tapas-style dishes came  Crab croquettes were sweet, almost dessert-like. The Fish tacos were very filling, again the fish was fresh and the taco deliciously crafted. After that, the sliders were a good finish, pulled pork was well seasoned and the dipping sauce pleasantly savory. \n\nExcellent place to hang, get a small meal, drink up some booze.\n\nService was outstanding - pleasant and professional.", "author": "Alex C."}

It's in a lively part of the Mission, so it's nice to walk around before or after eating here. The decor and ambiance is festive, but for some reason when we were inside it was blazing hot. I was sweating while eating just from sitting there haha.\n\nThe menu is limited, but the food we ordered from it was great. I was skeptical because I've been here before and gotten the avocado toast with fish, and it was terrible (bread too hard to eat). My BF & I shared the Huevos Rancheros, the seafood tacos, and the croissant French toast. The Huevos Rancheros is super basic - eggs, sauce on top, side of avocado, a tortilla, and some pureed beans. Simple but the flavors were good.\n\nThe seafood tacos come with a lot of aioli on top, if you like that sort of thing. I scraped some of it off because I thought it was overpowering. Instead of a tortilla, the outside of the taco is some sort of vegetable...radish maybe? This was my favorite dish. The seafood is lightly battered with fresh tomatoes (like a pico de Gallo?) inside, wrapped in the vegetable skin. Yum!\n\nCroissant French toast was interesting - definitely can tell it's different than normal French toast because it's made with croissant bread. Comes with berries, whipped cream, and syrup. Pretty tasty, but I knew I was gaining like 10 lbs when I ate it lol. It's a heavier, carb-y dish.\n\nPrices for the food were decent, overall good value!", "author": "Betty M."}

We split the sliders , the carnitas, the flautas, the queso (with mushrooms), and the salmon tacos (special of the night). Their corn tortillas are obviously hand-made, but I found them too thick and bland.\n\nI was not over-impressed with any of the items we ordered, they all seemed pretty bland.\n\nIt was also hot as hell in there, so do not go here if the temperature outside is anywhere even near warm. (I believe it was somewhere in the low 70's outside but was close to 90 inside, towards the end our our meal, I felt like I was going to pass out.\n\nThe service was fine, nothing special, as it got more packed we had to flag down a few people to get our check.\n\nTotal for 3 without tip was about $115, so the price was decent.", "author": "Amy W."}

The fried brussels sprouts were incredible (5/5), crispy and tender, served with a perfectly balanced vinaigrette with hints of wine. Other highlights included the panko avocado tacos (5/5), which paired a perfectly fried panko crust with the creaminess of avocado.

I ordered IPA- it was the chillest draft beer I have ever had in SF. It starts with complimentary chips and salsa, loved it. As for the food, expecting usual tapas size, it was bigger portion than I thought. Highly recommend tacos: salmon tacos (not on the menu but ask the waiter) and tropical tacos, both were amazing and I bet other tacos on the menu are as good. Ceviche and pork belly salad were also pretty unique and delicious. What makes the experience the most special and memorable is the unique interior decorations, even the receipt comes in a small leather boot, so cute! Each part of the restaurant has its own theme so it will feel different every time you sit at different location.

It brought out true flavors. \n\nWe didn't have any food, so I don't have much to comment on that part, but from what I saw, it looked amazing. I was craving the guac they served!

I came here for brunch with a group of friends and had a great experience. Some of us arrived earlier than the rest of the group so we had to wait to get seated, so we decided to chill at the bar and get some sides since were were already pretty hungry.\n\nLolo's atmosphere is very lively and I really enjoyed being surrounded by fun wall decorations and colors. I would imagine it's a good place for groups of friends to kick back.\n\nThe brunch menu consisted of choices like huevos rancheros, tacos, ceviche, etc. The choices all looked pretty enticing and prices range around $9-13 which was great for the quality of the food. After you order, you get complimentary chips and salsa. I noticed that the portions for the tacos appeared small on the plate, but apparently they were pretty filling. Note that the sides like guacamole, grilled beef, eggs, etc actually come on a side plate, not mixed in with your food. The food is plated beautifully and very Instagram worthy. \n\nService seemed pretty decent, the only annoyance being that our waiter barely filled a tiny cup of coffee for someone in our group who ordered it. Given that it's refillable, it's not a total ripoff but it would have been better to give a more reasonable amount from the get go.\n\nKale Salad - Gaja apples, caramelized pecans, cotija cheese, roasted garlic shallots and lime vinaigrette. I actually got the salad without the cheese, and mixed some scrambled eggs in for protein. Huge portions, the bowl of kale was practically spilling out. The dressing was mixed and integrated really well with the kale and the pecans were appetizing. I would have liked more apples and pecans given that they were pretty hidden and sparse in the salad, but this didn't bother me too much. I recommend adding some protein into this dish. \n\nI would definitely come back and try more dishes here!", "author": "Chelsea W."}

It's a nice, hipster spot with a fancy non-traditional Mexican flair. I wasn't too hungry, but ended up ordering the Avocado Toast ($11) with the Guacamole to share ($8). Let me start by saying, don't bother ordering the guacamole. I mainly got it because I wanted chips, but they actually provide complimentary chips and salsa for you anyways. On top of that, their guacamole was bland. I found myself enjoying the salsa much more, especially the green one --great kick of spice in it!\n\nAs for the avocado toast, it was a pretty solid choice. They two pieces of toast were crisp while topped with huge chunks of avocado and smoked trout. Some more arugula greens were covering the top drizzled with olive oil. It was a fulfilling, yet healthy choice. I actually struggled to finish my second avocado toast. So yay to the avocado toast, but nay to the guacamole.

I've heard that this restaurant can have gnarly waiting times, but I personally did not experience anything like this.\n\nI ordered roasted Brussels sprouts, which were honestly not that great. They were seasoned too salty for my taste, but at least they were quite generous with the portion. Fortunately, the meal got better from there! The taco tropical was awesome (panko and shrimp) with a super rich aioli-type of sauce on it. It lived up to the hype! However, I must say the crab croquetas were my favorite plate from the evening. They were kinda like crab cakes that were crispy and fried on the outside, but super gooey and creamy on the inside with a semi-sweet flavor thanks to the sauce they were served with. Excellent!\n\nAnd to finish off, I'm not one to indulge in sweets too often, but I am so glad I looked at the dessert menu. After reading the description of the bunuelos, I felt obliged to order it. It was well put together and so flavorful. A delicious, large scoop of vanilla ice cream was served over crispy little flakes of fried dough. Oh my goodness, after eating it, the only thing that stopped me from ordering a second was the fear of overdoing it on the carbs.

I liked them thin because they didn't overpower the taste of the ceviche when paired together. Loved the large corn pieces and the perfect amount of citrus for the dish.\n- Empanadas: very tasty, and only came with enough for the 4 of us. We easily finished our own empanadas and ready to ask for seconds if we weren't full at the end of the meal.\n- Shishito peppers: not many had that kick of secret spice, but the flavoring of how they were cooked was delicious and kept me grabbing one after the next.\n- Fish tacos: The tacos were probably one of my top favorite dishes of the evening and highly recommend ordering! Flavor was all there and the crispy texture just wins me over.\n- Porkbelly: one of my least favorite dish, but only because these dishes at every restaurant have more amounts of fat than the pork meat itself. The flavor was good however, but not much to eat when most was fat.\n- Octopus: grilled and also large pieces with yummy arugula. A little on the too charred side, but the texture and flavor was there. We were getting full so this was the dish we started slowly down on.\n- Potatoes: These didn't look like potatoes upon arrival because they were covered in sauce that looked like refried beans. They were delicious, but way to hard to finish at the end of this filling meal\n- Bunuelos: When ordering we thought these would be something like churros, but we were in for a surprise. The dough strips were like thin chips that tasted like cinnamon toast crunch (cereal) with ice cream, caramel and, strawberry bits. Actually really liked this dish, but wish there were more ice cream than the chip pieces. \n\nOverall, I had a great experience with the food here. However, we felt rushed to leave because there were people waiting in line. The waiters and waitresses would come around many times to see if things were okay.

The chilaquiles are dope: GET THEM. Best ones I've had in the city and they're slathered in sauce. Servers a bit out of it and don't pay much attention to you but hey, it's a popular place.

It took a while for the server/bus boys to give us the menu, bring us water, and finally take our order. I'm used to flagging down servers at Asian restaurants, so I tried to do the same here, but our server was nowhere to be found for long stretches at a time which was a little bit frustrating.\n\nHowever, the food was phenomenal, just as I remembered from my previous visit. I got the bacon omelette ($13), which comes with green onions, avocado, cherry tomato and roasted home fries. It was a huge omelette stuffed full of avocado and a generous amount of bacon. I definitely felt like I was getting my money's worth with this omelette! \n\nMy friend loves eggs benedicts, and he opted for their Mexican benedict eggs ($12), which is two eggs over fried organic corn gorditas, refried beans, creamy poblano sauce, fried shishito peppers. I didn't try it since I had my hands full trying to finish my own dish, but he really liked it and said it was very different from a regular egg benedict.\n\nThey also give you chips + salsa on the house to start your meal, which I thought was a nice touch. Since we were starving, we went through a good amount of these (including seconds) before we got our entrees.\n\nOur total came to around $45 for the two of us, including a drink each. Not too bad for a delicious brunch experience! Plus our bill came in a kid's boot...what an interesting idea.", "author": "Dianna H."}

The cocktail was sweet with a nice tang from the lime and the essence and suppleness of a good chicken soup (without the salt of course). Very refreshing drink. I'd go back just to get that cocktail. I also had the \"Shiso overrated,\" which was wonderful as well. Normal mint is used so often in cocktails, so it's great to see a more interesting one used here instead.\n\nOk, onto the food. If you like octopus you need to get it here. One of the most tender octopus I've had. Great flavor as well, and I also loved the poi-like mash underneath. Carne asada was also grilled to a perfection. Juicy and red in the middle, nice char on the outside. Grilled little gem salad was also great. I've never had grilled lettuce leaf in my salad and love the dimension grilling added to the dish.\n\nOnly thing I was underwhelmed by was the ceviche.

Chill vibe and nice decor, the host was super nice and got us seated quickly! The menu looked great and had many options that appealed to us.\n\nWe started off with margaritas, drinks were a little light and tasted like cucumber water, this is when I first noticed their salt was super light in flavor.\n\nWe had a bottle of white wine to pair with our seafood, it was super chilled to the point where it was sweating the glass and leaving rings on the table. Once the temperature got warmer the wine really opened up. That was around the time of our last bite...\n\nOur first plate was the ceviche, it tasted like tomato water and a squirt of lemon juice with a few shrimps scattered through out.\nSprinkled a little salt on top, tasted like I sprinkled flavorless fairy dust.\n\nThe octopus was cooked decently and it was quite tender, yet again it was bland. The arugula had more flavor than anything on the plate, it was the only thing memorable. \n\nThe tuna tacon was cooked well and had a great texture, but the light flavor might as well have been sashimi. \n\n'A la Diabla' Shrimp. They need to change the name because its misleading. Buttery, creamy, tomato soup with shrimp and a scoop of white rice would have been great if it was $8.99 and what I wanted to eat but I ordered 'A la Diabla' Shrimp...\n\nIf I had to choose one item worthy of eating it would be the calamari and octopus gorditas, light in flavor but in a good way.

I was scared of how the michelada was going to be because we usually make them at home the way we grew up making them in Mexico, and have a hard time finding similar ones. However this one was great! It was similar, still had some of the traditional taste but tasted like a classier version of a michelada. I had visited Lol\u00f3 before with my friends some time ago, but only during dinner and for drinks. We then had the ceviche and the taco tropical to share. They both blew our minds. Although the ceviche had a lot of tomato, the flavors were so complimenting and extremely delicious. Then we shared the carnitas plate, which came with tortillas de ma\u00edz azul, and it smelled like my abuelita's tortillas. The way in which it was brought out to us was genius - very traditional to the way it is served in Mexico. We loved everything that was brought out.\n\nLiving in San Francisco as a native Jalisciense has been challenging in terms of access to traditional Mexican food, and Lol\u00f3 was an amazing and nostalgic experience.

The first thing I noticed was the creative and colorful interior of this place! So cool -- baskets on walls, brightly printed wallpaper, car doors, bicycle parts on light fixtures, western belts on barstools... etc. \n\nFood is delicious!! Here's what we ordered (party of 3) -- \nBeef tacos ($9) x 2\nCeviche ($12) x 2\nKale salad ($9)\nShishito Peppers ($7) \n\nKale salad is a pretty big portion. It can easily be split by 2 people and have a third person sample some. \nGenerous portion for shishito peppers, too. They're not spicy! One or two may have a tiny kick to it though. \nCeviche was really good and the perfect amount if you order one other dish with it. \nBeef tacos were tasty, though a little bit oily. You get 2 small tacos, so if you're pretty hungry, I highly recommend ordering another dish or two with it. \n\nNatalia is an excellent waitress. \nShe was very attentive and didn't rush us even when they were closing to prepare for their dinner hour. \n\nWe parked at the Mission Bartlett garage, which was only a couple minute's walk to this restaurant.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-09-26", "description": "4.5 stars.\n\nWhen I think of restaurants in my regular rotation, Lol\u00f3 is definitely on the list. It's just soooo good!\n\nI've been eating here since they were located on 22nd Street (now Lol\u00f3 cevicheria), and am extremely sad they no longer serve the dishes that I loved so much-- the octopus tiradito and the Mexiterranean cheese fondue. Those were two of my favorite dishes amongst ALL food that I eat regularly in SF. Seriously, bring those back into my life and I'll bump this review up to 5 stars.\n\nBut everything else is still really good:\n-CEVICHE: Probably my favorite Mexican style ceviche. It retains traditional flavors but gets amped up with roasted pepper. They give you 3 tostadas that you can break to eat the ceviche with (or eat whole to be more traditional). If you're out of tortillas, no problem; you can still scoop up some ceviche with the provided chips.\n-Fried BRUSSEL SPROUTS (*brusselS sprouts, btw): My go to vegetable dish. Perfectly crispy and the vinaigrette adds a nice acidity.\n\nTacos: 2 of each\n-TUNA TACON: Must order. Totally Asian fusion, but seared albacore tuna makes for a delicious taco. The tomatillo sauce in the spoons is also super bomb.\n-TACO TROPICAL: Really different because it's tempura shrimp smothered in aioli on top of a JICAMA tortilla. The jicama makes the dish not too heavy and adds a refreshing, crunchy texture to the taco. I don't always order this because I'm happy with the tuna tacon and can only eat so much, but it's definitely worth experiencing.\n\nOther items:\n-Grilled OCTOPUS: the purple potato puree makes for a pretty presentation. Not the most tender octopus I've ever had, but I like the garlic and paprika adobo flavors.\n-Grilled PICANHA (top sirloin): I almost always opt for steak everywhere I eat, and the steak at Lol\u00f3 is good; medium rare, just how I like it. I also love nopales (cactus) and think it adds a wonderful Mexican flare to chimichurri. However, I've only ordered the picanha once because I'm perfectly satisfied just loading up on seafood. This never happens because I am super carnivorous, but at Lolo's, the tacos and ceviche are so good that I devour them and I'm just too full for anything else.\n\nDrinks: Mezcal and pisco are my favorite liquors, so I definitely recommend the Lorenita (which is pretty much a margarita but with mezcal) and the Fresh Prince (which is almost like a Maracuya sour).\n\nBrunch:\nThe red SANGRIA is probably one of the most flavorful sangrias I've ever had. The cardamom lends a delicately herbal note to really refreshing drink. I most definitely prefer it to the white sangria that they also offer even though it may be tempting if you're feeling like it's a white wine kind of day. But I guarantee the red sangria is more flavorful!\n-Crispy CHILAQUILES: I almost always order chilaquiles for breakfast at any Mexican restaurant. These were satisfying, but I had to ADD EGGS to my order.\n-Mexican BENEDICT EGGS: The gorditas made it really filling, and the creamy poblano sauce was delish.\n\nGosh this review took me forever. TLDR version: If you haven't eat at Lol\u00f3 yet, do it now! You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Stephanie Joyce D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-19", "description": "Fairly casual tapas place for a slightly but not too upscale dinner. I had a group dinner at the old 22nd St location and really enjoyed it, so was curious to revisit. My brother was in town and I figured Mexican food would be something SF did well compared to East Coast and a treat for him. I looked for a reservation through Yelp and only saw 5:30 and 10 so didn't bother, however we walked in at 6:15 and were able to be seated immediately. It looked like they left half of the seats open for walk-ins so you'd probably have a good chance if you didn't come at peak peak with a large group.\n\nVery colorful, funky and eclectic decor including a wall with paper boats lining it making a unique wallpaper. The bathroom was well kept, clean, and spacious. Service was pretty good, attentive but not too much.\n\nChips (3/5) - Housemade, standard, enjoyed the green salsa which was more tangy and citrusy.\nBrussel Sprouts (3/5)- Pretty standard, you had some burnt crisp parts and it had a firm but cooked texture, not mushy. Hazelnuts added more toasted, nutty flavor and crunchy texture.\nBeet Salad (4/5) - One of the more creative dishes, slices of fresh beet were laid on a cotija cheese mousse with pieces kumquat, a great combination of sweet and savory, citrus and cream.\nCeviche (4.5/5) - Very good! You can taste the freshness and burst of flavor. There wasn't that much actually shrimp, maybe 3-4 pieces. Shrimp and fish, chunks of jicama, toasted corn. The kernels of corn are hard and crunchy. Flour chips were great too.\nPork Belly (3.5/5) - Lots of slabs of pork belly, flavorful, but very heavy. I ate about a fourth of it and couldn't finish because of the previous courses and because it was so rich. The texture is more chewy than crispy.  I liked the seasoning served with onions, cilantro, and red peppers.", "author": "Truc N."}

It has a funky environment, automotive doors hung on the wall, folding paper boats art on another wall, and rooster figurines on the top shelf in the kitchen. Aside from the interior space, let's get the chow down.\n\nStarter - Chip and Salas. The chips is fresh, and a nice hit me spot while waiting for our orders. We were given 2 sauce, one tastes like chipotle with a mild hotness, and the other had a sweet taste.\n\nWife ordered Agua Fresca. It was supposed to be watermelon, but they didn't have any that night. So the other choice is Guava. Wife said it seems like it came out of Kerns Guava Can.\n\u00a0\nKale Salad - gaja apples, caramelized walnuts, cotija cheese, roasted garlic, shallots and lime vinaigrette.\n\nThe kale salad is a bit dry, and this is after mixing all together. The slice gaja apple didn't provide any crunch. The caramelized walnuts added some texture, but it was little to none. Overall, the balance of this salad wasn't there.\n\u00a0\nTuna Tacon - seared albacore tuna, shellfish aioli, avocados, roasted tomatillo sauce on the side, on flour tortillas.\n\nThe seared albacore tuna just didn't taste like \"melting of tuna freshness\". The avocado is a good size, but it should have been sliced and fan out on the base to build the albacore tuna as the tower showcase. The taste is ok, but didn't really hit the spot.  \n\nPanko avocado taco - oaxaca cheese, caramelized onion, anaheim peppers, on flour tortillas.\n\nThis dish is one of the better. The panko avocado on each bite brings a pretty good texture. The sour cream on the side added some moisture to the panko layer.  \n\u00a0\nSpecial -  fatty salmon, avocados, radish, white corn, with parsley garnish.\n\nNot sure what it is, but the fatty salmon just didn't cut it. We had fatty salmon raw before, and this doesn't come close to the taste.\n\u00a0\nCeviche - shrimp and rock fish, citrus roasted pepper sauce and salted corn.\n\nNot sure what to stay on this dish. Tomatoes, tomatoes, and tomatoes. There is also jikama diced cube mixed in bringing some crunch but where is the rock fish? 3 shrimp only? I thought ceviche is a balance of fish or seafood, but this sure didn't make it.\n\nFish Taco - rock cod fried in tempura, handmade corn tortilla, habanero, crema, peanuts and Paquin pepper sauce.\n\nThere goes our rock cod fish. Must have save all the meat to prepare for this dish. The crema with lettuce was like a blob and didn't have a clean balance for us to taste the rock cod.  \n\u00a0\nCrab Croquetas - \u00a0dungeness crab, ancho pepper, piloncillo soy reduction and garlic mayo.\n\nWhere is the dungeness crab? Ah... look, it is on the bottom of the ball. This dish isn't what we thought as there isn't much crab at all!!! Maybe it is because it isn't crab season. If so, change the dish to taylor to the shellfish season.\n\u00a0\nFinal thoughts highlight points:\n* local in the busy mission area.\n* I can see travelers will dig this vibe.\n* Price per tasting doesn't balance \n* do not get seated next to the restroom. they should install a door to keep thr smell out and have somone check them.  \n* disappointed\n* underwhelming", "author": "Mike T."}

We wanted to go to Beretta initially but they were (also unsurprisingly) totally packed and had over an hour wait list. I know people in SF like to wait in line, but no thanks. \nWe wandered around until we spotted Lolo, where I've not been before but wanted to try. Tapas are my shit, so we checked for a table. Because dinner snacking is life. We had to wait again, but the time was manageable, the hostess (she wore some sort of flower in her hair, I believe) was super well dressed and nice, and they text you when they're ready so you don't actually have to wait there.\n\nWe got drinks at Holy Mountain (the bar upstairs in Hawker Fare. Check it out, I love it; the restaurant much less so) and when we got the text headed to Lolo. I got 2-3 tapas, which included the shishito peppers, some sort of tuna taco thing, chips and salsa and maybe something else I can't remember. I didn't try the peppers much but bf was very into them. The tuna tacos were good, albeit literally tiny af. Since this is belated I don't remember all the details but I do remember enjoying them and the tuna being prepared nicely- not overdone. The chips and salsa were fine, but aren't they always? It's tapas, sure, but the sizes of the plates not for when you're hungry.\nI also had a couple of glasses of red, Tempranillo maybe? \n\nIt was a Friday so the place was poppin'. Super busy and loud, maybe partly because of the space itself. Which btw is pretty cute with loud & bright floral motifs and some boots/kooky decor. Esentially- great for a fun night with friends or a date.\nBut, I gotta say, maybe we didn't order enough to taste everything or whatever, the bill was around 60-65 bucks for 2 glasses of wine and what came out to maybe a single decent sized portion of food. Not terrible, but definitely over priced, and I won't say I was wowed by the food. It was pretty good, not something I'd fawn over.

Luckily, we were able to score two seats at the bar and dive right into some amazing drinks and food. \n\nFor food we shared: shishito peppers, guacamole, brussels sprouts, avocado tacos, and some version of a queso fundido.  All food is served with homemade chips and salsa.  The salsa was fresh and chips were crispy/not overly salted.  A total standout was the homemade tortillas that came with the queso, warm, perfectly made and you could taste the fresh ingredients in these. We didn't get any of the entrees, but I like to share a bunch of small plates so this was perfect as the starters can be shared between 2-3 people easily and you will be fulllll.  \n\nThe drinks were a real standout, amazing balance of flavors and unique combinations.  I am a mezcal freak so the use of mezcal and tequila in a lot of the cocktails had my head spinning it was so difficult to choose.  We had: 2 birds 1 stone, night call, fresh prince, and a last word with mezcal rather than gin.  Deeeeeeeelicious.  The 2 birds 1 stone is a total brunch cocktail with the carrot juice and salted rim I could just have this for breakfast everyday.  The bartenders are innovative and creative so sit at the bar and they can mix you up something off menu if you can't decide (like me) what you're feeling. \n\nThe service here was outstanding.  The three guys working behind the bar were so nice and knowledgeable about the cuisine and spirits offered at Lolo.  We chatted a bit with one of the bartenders and he explained the owners have some other places in Mexico (where we are visiting in a few months) so he wrote down some recommendations for us to go.

The star dish was the taco tropical, which probably just made the other dishes average...  We were pretty disappointed with the crab croquetas which just tasted like mashed potatoes... \n\nService was just okay also. We were ignored practically the whole night and it took forever before a server even acknowledged us and took our order. I'd say lolo is a really cool venue, but meh, I probably wouldn't go out of the way to come back and eat here again.", "author": "Janet H."}

It can be super crowded, but if you come during off hours on the weekend or don't mind grabbing a drink while you wait for a table, it's totally worth it. Trust me.\n\nFirst, the service is always great and quick. Sometimes the drinks take awhile, but that's only because they're not easy to make. The servers are on top of things and the bus boys always keep the chips and water flowing. My favorite dishes are the avocado tacos, tacos tropical, ceviche (although it is Mexican ceviche, so not quite as good as Peruvian, but still fresh and tasty) and Brussels sprouts. You can't go wrong with any of these. I also recently tried the grilled octopus and would highly recommend it because it's super tender and grilled perfectly! If you can, make a reservation a few weeks in advance and come hungry. You won't be disappointed.", "author": "Steph L."}

We were seated immediately and someone came by to take our order. We shared the tacos tropical, which was certainly worth the buzz. They were so good with a great combination of ingredients! Then I had the chilaquiles which were good, although I thought they could have done a little more to make the dish more flavorful and interesting. \nI docked one star because I felt like the service went progressively downhill. Our coffees never came and our server didn't check on us during the meal so we couldn't mention it until we had to ask him to remove it from the bill. And we had to flag someone down for a water refill. They have a lot of food runners that keep the meal moving but it would've nice to be checked in on. \nBut I'd definitely come back, the food is well thought out and I'd like to try some of the other offerings.", "author": "Gloria N."}

So plan accordingly! \nWe arrived early as were not from the city and didn't know how bad traffic and parking would be. We weren't able to be seated so we walked around the cute shops nearby. \nWe got seated to a corner spot that normally sits 4 people comfortably, but we had 5 so it was kinda odd to squish 3 people on one side. Especially since we had reservations, I expected a better table. \nThis place isn't that big but not the smallest either. Decorated with probably the most random things you could find around the house and to put it nicely, it's interesting.. personally, I'm not a fan. \nLets get down to grubbin! We ordered the guacamole to start and it was alright, it needed more seasoning. I honestly liked the free starter salsa they provided more. \nWe then had the ceviche (yummm, if you love seafood, probably one of my favorite), the chilaquiles (soggy nachos), kale salad (too sour), taco tropical (not your average taco, pretty tasty), tuna tacon (average), avocado taco, grilled beef tacos (beef was very flavorful), and ended with the croissant French toast (which was delicious but very soggy because croissants soak oil). \n\nOverall, the food is alright, worth a try once, but it's too pricey for average food. \nBe prepared to leave smelling like the place.", "author": "Vence M."}

We walked around the neighborhood for about 15 minutes and then returned to the restaurant and we ended up getting what we thought was the best table in the restaurant, a booth and window seat.  The wait staff could not have been nicer and the food was excellent.  We ordered from a brunch menu, we ordered the Kale salad, huevos ranchos  and the carnitas.

That was painful. Learn from our mistake and make a reservation in advance. Otherwise, you'll be hangry out of your mind when the menu arrives. And if you're anything like me and my delirious party, you too will end up over-ordering like starved hyenas.\n\nIn Filipino, \"lolo\" means grandfather.

No sunscreen required.\n\n// Taco Tropical ($11 / 2 pcs.) - 5 stars\nI loved how unique the jicama tortillas were. They added a light and refreshing crunchiness to every bite of the taco. Throw in some fried shrimp with spicy aioli smothered on top, and you have yourself Lol\u00f3's most popular dish.\n\n// Tuna Tacon ($12 / 2 pcs.) - 4 stars\nMore Asian-fusion with the albacore tuna and avocado one-two punch. Overall very good, but I thought the tuna was a little dry.\n\n// Calamary and Octopus Gorditas ($14 / 2 pcs.) - 4 stars\nMy cousin called this dish the \"black mystery bread.\" I enjoyed it more than the other two did, but finishing an entire gordita was too heavy. I'd recommend splitting one piece with someone else.\n\n// Grilled Octopus ($28) - 5 stars\nThe octopus was tender and had a pristinely clean texture. This was my favorite dish of the night.\n\n// Carnitas ($18) - 4 stars\nParticularly juicy and packed with flavor.\n\n// Lamb Sliders ($12 / 2 pcs.) - 3 stars\nThe porcini mushroom sauce was excellent with its creaminess and earthy aftertaste. I thought the lamb was too overcooked though.\n\n// Guacamole ($8) - 2 stars\nAlthough I did like the cotija cheese, the consistency of the guacamole was lacking. It didn't have enough of an avocado oomph to it. None of us were fans of this appetizer.\n\nProTip: If you are an odd-numbered group and are eyeing a dish that comes in pieces of 2 (i.e. Taco Tropical, Tuna Tacon, etc.), you can request for just a single additional piece at half the cost of a regular order.", "author": "Miko B."}

I usually don't look at my restaurant receipts too closely after dining out, but when I checked my credit card statement, I noticed something was \"off\" with the final amount Lolo's charged onto my cc.  Someone added more tips on top of what I had written on my receipt!!  I can understand if this was a simple human error and a few keys were punched in wrong when closing out our tab, but to my surprised, it happened to my GF's cc as well!  Something VERY fishy happened to both our credit cards and as much I would like to give the person the benefit of the doubt, this seems more intentional than accidental.  Since we split the bill and both of our credit cards were charged, I mentioned my discovery to my GF and when she checked her cc statement, her final amount did not add up to what she put on her receipt either.  We both tipped accordingly and while service was lacking (we had to ask 4 different people for hot water), we did not discount any of the tips to our server(s).  \n\nWhile the extra amounts added without our permission were minimal and just a few dollars more, it is the principal that we have issues with.  We certainly understand that good help is hard to find and servers should be compensated fairly for their service but no customer should ever have to triple check their receipts because someone tried to take advantage of a situation.  Something so minimal can easily be overlooked and even if it was just an extra $1 added to every cc transaction that evening, the total can add up to a couple of hundreds of $$ extra in tips.  It's unfortunate that this happened to us but we really hope it does not happen to any other patrons that dine here.\n\nHad this incident not happened, we would have probably given Lolo's another try again, at least for their dessert (the tiramisu is delicious!) but this will most likely be both our first and last time here.  Such a shame too since the GF I was with that evening is the Controller of another restaurant in the city and she enjoys the food scene as much as I do.  She was excited to try out Lolo's since it's been such a strong standing fixture in the Mission and while the food was mediocre + on the pricier end for their portions, we were still hopeful to come back and try other dishes on their menu.  However, this incident has left a bad taste in our mouths.  If you plan on dining here and will be using your cc, please make sure to check your statement to ensure it matches up to the amount on your receipt.", "author": "Janetto L."}

It;s a bit loud, and dim, and crowded, but honestly that;s the norm for most SF restaurants.\n\nDrinks- While they have a full bar, agave based drinks are their specialty.

Too bad, because the lunch/dinner menu looks pretty enticing.\n\nSo we brunched it up with the following:\n\nAVOCADO TOAST (2/5)  Our waitress convinced us to get this.  Without seeing the details on the menu, we agreed to order it.  It looked good but it wasn't.  Two things that messed up this dish.  First, it was overloaded with lemon.  Just overwhelmingly so.  You couldn't taste the avocado.  And second, there was smoked fish mixed in with the avocado which was an UNpleasant surprise.  I think it was smoked herring.  Wasn't a good combo for me, and like I mentioned, the lemon was just murdering the avocado.  If you're a lemon head and you like smoked herring, this might be your dish.  But it sure ain't mine.\n\nCHILIQUILLES (4/5)  So, we're talking 2 eggs with chips and salsa verde.  The chips were warm and almost tasted like caramelized potato slices after they soaked a bit in the salsa and eggs.  Nothing wrong with this dish.  Would order again.\n\nTUNA TACON (4/5)  Seared tuna dish, small portion, but tasty and good enough for an appetizing bite or two.\n\nBEEF TACOS (4/5)  My wife's dish.  She liked them a lot but complained about the overpowering lemon flavor even in the taco (it must have been the guacamole on the taco).\n\nI'm almost sure I would have a better experience if we were ordering from the lunch/dinner menu.  The Pistachio Salmon on that menu is calling my name.  I'd def like to come back and give the other menu a shot.\n\nSeating was a bit tight space-wise.  I didn't like that.\n\nService was good.  And the decor and wall art was pretty amazing and unique - several car doors were lined up along the back wall (yes, I wrote car doors), men's suit coats were lined up, and plastered against the front entry wall.  \n\nCan you even picture that?

The special of the night was a tlayuda so essentially a flatbread with beans, chorizo, cheese, and avocado and it was bland and stale. I thought an off menu special of the night would be tasty and I didn't want more than 2 bites. \n\nOverall really glad I made a res instead of a walk in, the vibe of the place was trendy and cool and I think sitting at the bar could be fun but just wasn't impressed.", "author": "Lauren W."}

There wasn't anything earlier available. \n\nCOST: $163.73 before tip for 4 cocktails, 2 salads, 4 dinner plates, 1 dessert. A very filling dinner for three!\n\nMUST-HAVES: The Fresh Prince (honestly I've loved SO MANY of their cocktails!!), Fish taco, Coconut ice cream (a dessert special, one that I almost missed. Look for a tiny chalk board to the left of the cupboards above the bar). See my pics for additional details!\n\nCOCKTAILS\n* The Fresh Prince (Capurro Pisco, passion fruit, lime, egg white, orange blossom water. Served up. $11) - 4.5 stars\nDelicioso! Love the texture of the egg white, the refreshing tart flavor of this drink. Incredibly well balanced. \n\n* El Pu\u00f1al (San Juan del rio mezcal, aperol, poppy liqueur, almond syrup, lime. Served up. $11) - 4.5 stars\nMy bf thoroughly enjoyed this, and plus it's a gorgeous drink with the flower petals on top!\n\nSALADS\n* Beet salad (beets, candied kumquats, crumbled feta & toasted coconut w/ blood orange vinaigrette. $8) - 4 stars\nNicely done, sharpness of kumquats was nice!\n\n* Corn esquites (butter, cotija cheese, crema, lime, piquin, epazaote. $6) - 4 stars\nAlso great, loved the mixture of spice, sweetness, sour, and the fattiness of the butter/crema to bind it all together.\n\nDINNER\n* Fish taco (rock cod fried in tempura, handmade corn tortilla, habanero, crema, peanuts & piquin pepper sauce. $15 for three) - 4.5 stars\nMy bf would argue to give this 5 stars. Granted the fish & tortillas are amazing. It's just got a little TOO much topping for me, making it just slightly inconvenient to eat (drips everywhere, etc.). The sauce is fantastic too, adds a nice tartness.\n\n* Mezcal barbacoa beef rib gorditas (over organic masa, sour cream, pickled onions. 3 pcs $20.50) - 3.5 stars\nMeat is tasty but a tad on the dry side. The masa is a like a crisped sopa. Overall flavors not as complex as other dishes here.\n\n* Grilled octopus (marinated in garlic & paprika adobo, puple potato puree, arugula & kalamata oil. $25) - 4.5 stars\nAs tender, meaty, and amazing as last time!\n\n* Diabla shrimp (creamy & spicy cascabel & chipotle pepper sauce, bacon, white mushroom,s white rice. $19) - 4 stars\nGreat sauce, love how thick and rich it is. The shrimp is crunchy. Rice was a tad dry. \n\nDESSERT\nCoconut ice cream (special, $7) -  5 stars\nCreamy ice cream, loved the toasted coconut for added crunch.

Everything about Lolo just flawlessly works. \n\nFirst, the cocktails: I had the two birds one stone which is basically a green juice with alcohol in it and a celery salt rim. The flavors all work really well together and it's a very refreshing, unique drink. \n\nSecond, the food: can't go wrong with anything! We were a group of 3 and way over-ordered, so I would say that, when perusing the menu of insanely delicious looking options, to be mindful that the tapas portions here are pretty generous. Standout items were the roasted Brussels sprouts and the beef tacos, which were both bursting with flavor. The carnitas was also excellently cooked, crispy on the outside yet melts in your mouth. \n\nThird, the ambience: the d\u00e9cor is warm and inviting and is in keeping with the Latin-inspired food.

The tacos are more of a tapas dish, so order accordingly. I also had the croissant french toast, which was really good.

The waiter was slow to acknowledge my table's presence, and asked if we wanted appetizers. The brunch menu did not have a section labeled \"appetizers\" or anything close, just \"brunch\". We ordered an appetizer (Shishito Peppers) before ordering our main meal, and it took a while for that simple (minimal preparation) dish to be served.\n\nWhen we were finally served, the waiter took our order for main dishes...accept for mine. He assumed I wasn't going to order anything (from eavesdropping on our conversation, when I said \"I wasn't super hungry\"), and walked away after he took the other orders at my table; so I had to flag him down. From there, it took about 35-40 minutes for our food to come out. We asked another waiter/server about the status of our food, and the food came out shortly. The food served was cold, the fried shrimp in the tacos and the potato mesh on the side of the egg sandwich. \n\nAfter we were served, no one stopped by to check-in at our table, asking how the food was, etc.. The waiter did stop by to pour our water again, but did not say anything. The fastest service we received was from the busboy, who circled the restaurant like a hawk. As soon as I finished my last bite, he swooped in to clear my plate. This was fine, but it seemed like we were being rushed. The waiter was also quick to drop off the bill, but only dropped off the bill. Again, did not ask about our meal, or offer a dessert or additional drink option; nothing.\n\nWe were all disappointed with the food and service. As we clearly had no familiarity with the menu, it would've been helpful if the waiter pointed out \"these are the appetizers\", and give some guidelines on portion sizes. If he overheard me say I wasn't that hungry, he should've heard the other two at my table say they were starving. The egg sandwich was a good portion, but the Taco Tropical dish was quite small.

Decor is creative, (paper boats mural, metallic car door installation on back wall, chicken wallpaper in restroom wait area) festive and bright. With that much attention to decor I expected I would be overwhelmed by food flavor, but in the end I felt a bit cheated. \n\nPerhaps things started off a little poorly by the fact they waited too long to take my drink order. And then waited too long to take my food order. Especially when it was the start of the evening and the tables were just starting to fill up. \n\nFresh Prince cocktail was ok. Grilled artichoke was cold. (The server did apologize and send it back and it was better 2nd time around). The grass fed beef taco was also just ok. Nothing flavorful enough to make me come back. \n\nInstead the overall experience made me wonder if I should have declined my restaurant reservation text an hour before my meal (although I did think that was a convenient option text 1 to confirm 3 to cancel). \n\nI did think the decor was a hoot - made me smile and puts you in the mood to celebrate, maybe it was just an off night but I think they should put a little more of the attention to detail in the kitchen.", "author": "Lisa D."}

The bar staff was entertaining to watch and fairly attentive. \n\nMy one complaint is that I found the hostess to be a bit unpleasant. I was a solo diner and wanted to use the restroom while I waited for a spot at the bar to open up (which was first come first serve and very very busy - I ended up waiting for an hour), but the hostess refused to keep an eye out for a seat for the 3 minutes it would've taken me to use the restroom cause she was too busy hostessing. I get that it's first come first serve... but it's a bit frustrating to think my hour long wait for a seat at the bar could've been extended to two hours if a seat opened up while I was in the restroom. If she had time to schmooze with customers throughout the restaurant for 2-3 minutes each (which she did a lot), she could've made the effort to help me not miss my chance at a seat. \n\nThe first come first serve seating at the bar is also a poor system generally. It's sort of a matter of luck if you're standing close enough to the spots at the bar that open up. And some people sat at the bar for hours without eating... which would be fine if there weren't people who were waiting to sit. Just treat it as walk in seating for dinner, keep a waitlist, and separate people who want to just drink into an area that isn't possible seating for diners.", "author": "Taly M."}

Since Lolo is open later, we decided to go here instead. It was Thursday, August 13th around 10:15pm. We walked in without a reservation and were seated right away.\n\nFood:\n*Fried brussel sprouts: shallots, hazelnuts, late harvest zinfandel vinaigrette ($7)\n*Corn on the cob: cotija cheese and cream ($6)\n*Shishito peppers: lemon olive oil, maldon salt ($7)\n*Taco tropical: panko and spice-dusted shrimps, topped with a tropical relish and spicy aioli, on jicama tortillas ($10)\n*Ceviche: shrimp and rock fish citrus roasted pepper sauce and salted corn ($12)\n*Carnitas: with organic handmade corn tortillas, roasted tomato sauce, guacamole, pickled onions ($17)\n\nI enjoyed the shishito peppers the most. They were blistered nicely and had a good salty sour contrast. The ceviche had bold citrusy flavor, but I didn't like the addition of the corn. The carnitas were really good, but a touch dry for me. I didn't eat much of the sprouts and the tacos. I remember them being okay. The dish I would avoid would be the corn. There was an over abundance of cream that didn't add anything to the dish. I thought this would be like street corn, but it wasn't. Not good at all.\n\nDrinks:\n*Sangria: pinot noir, vodka, poppy liqueur, cardamom, served on the rocks ($11)\n*Nightcall: scotch, el silencio mezcal, creme the violette, amaretto, served on the rocks ($11)\n*Cheap trick: altos reposado tequila, chile ancho liqueur, vanilla bitters ($11)\n*The windshield ($11)\n\nThe drinks were the highlight for me. I started with the Nightcall which was a dark boozy drink with an element of sweetness. I asked our server what I should get next and he suggested the Windshield. I need to order this the next time I'm here as that was my favorite drink! Not sure what was in it, but it was dark, boozy and not so sweet, which was exactly what I wanted.\n\nService was great! Growing up in a restaurant, I used to hate it when people lingered in restaurants when they were the last party. Unfortunately, I was that party! But the staff was great. We never felt rushed. But we did try to hurry and finish up our drinks as it was getting late.\n\nI feel like I may have ordered the wrong food items for my tastes.

Mixed art and a wide selection of tequila/ cocktails. It does get crowded so I would recommend reserving a seat online. NO RESERVATIONS OVER the PHONE. You either must do it online or walk in and accept the wait time. You are able to head to the bar as you wait for your table to be called. The team will text you once your table is ready, keep your phone on loud. \n\nMy girlfriend and I have been BIGGGGGG fans since we began coming here 2 years ago. We always say we need to write a post (finally doing it after all this time!).\n\nHonestly let me start off by saying there are two main components to why we love this location so much. \n\n1st: \nwith all HONESTY it is all because of the hostess VIRI (I hope I spelled your name correctly). She makes the entire ambient much better. We usually visit this establishment on Thursday night, we do it sporadically but it seems to always land on Thursdays haha. Anyways, to explain the seriousness of how well she does her job and just how awesome of a human she is  (without us truly knowing her)- we have left when we did not see her at the door. He presence is felt and completes our experience when we dine. \n\n2nd:\nThe PANKO AVOCADO TACOS are extremely delicious. They do not lack in flavor (satisfying your pallet in every single bite) nor in consistency. I am particularly sensitive to spice and I can not stop ingesting them. It is unfortunate that they give you two tacos per plate however, we do leave with a full stomach. We enjoy the KALE salad that has the right amount of lime zest to it as it is fresh and light. Anyone who goes must try both these items.", "author": "Kiansu And Laura R."}

The ceviche was also too acidic; the citrus juices overpowered the fish (except for the fishy pieces). I told our server the fish was fishy but he didn't understand.

Their food is amazing and their margs are even better. \n\nThey serve you a green and red salsa to start with some free chips. Now free chips aren't rare in SF, but let me tell you, other cities will CHARGE you for chips and salsa. It's a travesty. Anyway I digress. Their guacamole is super creamy and delicious as well. I think their entire menu is pretty awesome but I will go ahead and recommend my two favorite tacos. Taco Tropical and Tuna Tacon are the stand outs. Taco tropical is essentially a panko dusted shrimp taco but is not on a tortilla shell exactly.. it's on a tortilla shell shaped jicama slice. I know. Mind blown. But trust me it's really delicious. The next is tuna tacon, which is albacore tuna seared off to perfection. It's quite good. \n\nHonorable mention to the panko avocado taco. It is realllll good and I wish I could replicate it at home.

Unfortunately, their menu changed at some point and the pistachio salmon and octopus carpaccio that were popular dishes among Yelpers aren't on the menu anymore :(\n\nPRICE: Pretty reasonable, mostly ranging from $8 - $12. The portions might seem small with the taco dishes only having 2 tacos, but they're surprisingly filling. My friend and I ordered 4 plates, which came out to be about $50 after tax/tip.\n\nATMOSPHERE: Lively. There's bar seating, booths and tables that are relatively close to each other. Bright with lots of light and high ceilings. Lots of bright, colorful, patterned wallpaper and cushions, and very eclectically decorated: suits on the back cushions of seats, a wall of car doors, slightly creepy hanging hand/glove art and dog statues everywhere.\n\nSERVICE: Attentive without being intruding. Our waitress gave us time to look at the menu and checked up on us once or twice. Food came out reasonably quickly. The servers were good about clearing the plates as we finished dishes to give us more space on the table and also asked to make sure we were enjoying the food.\n\n=====\n\n-CHIPS & SALSA (complimentary) - 2/5\nFor a nice Mexican restaurant, their chips and salsa were rather disappointing. The chips were very average and both salsas (red and green) were pretty bland. \n\n-PANKO AVOCADO TACO ($9) - 4.5/5\n[oaxaca cheese, caramelized onion, anaheim peppers, red onion]\nOrdered this because it's on 7x7's Big Eat list for 2015. Honestly, I was a little skeptical about it being on the list and wasn't expecting to enjoy fried/breaded avocado, but I was pleasantly surprised! Contrary to my belief, the taco didn't feel heavy or unhealthy despite the cheese and fried aspect. The avocado was soft and silky on the inside and had a slight crunch from the panko breading, and the cheese was perfectly gooey.\n\n-CEVICHE ($12) - 4.5/5\n[shrimp & rock fish, jicama, salted peppercorns, citrus roasted pepper sauce]\nI really enjoyed this but I'm a little biased towards loving ceviche in general. It comes with only 4 large chips, but the complimentary chips they give before your meal work very well for eating the rest of the ceviche. The jicama and corn added a nice crunch and texture, the shrimp and fish were fresh and the citrus sauce was light and refreshing. The only problem I had was that there were only 2 shrimp in our ceviche!\n\n-TACO TROPICAL ($9) - 4/5\n[panko and spice-dusted shrimp, tropical relish, spicy aioli, on jicama \"tortillas\"]\nAsked for the aioli on the side since my friend and I generally don't like our food drenched in sauces. The tacos were really nice and light without any sort of aioli or sauces, which I personally preferred. The tomato and pineapple relish added a touch of sweetness and the jicama tortillas were a unique touch - absolutely loved them! I didn't care for the breading on the shrimp though; it was kind of thick and took away from the lightness of the rest of the taco.\n\n-TUNA TACON ($10) - 3.5/5\n[seared albacore tuna, avocado, shellfish aioli, roasted tomatillo sauce on the side]\nThese tacos seemed very popular amongst Yelpers, so naturally we had to order them. Unfortunately, my friend and I both found the tacos to be kind of disappointing. We asked for the aioli on the side and I'm glad we did. Even without the aioli, I could barely taste the tuna. The piece of tuna wasn't very big and the flavor and texture of just the avocado overpowered it. Not a bad dish, but not special.", "author": "Jessie L."}

Please note, I do love my Indian food. Also, if you're into passion fruit like I am then you must try the Fresh Prince cocktail. I didn't try any of the other cocktails because I had 3 Fresh Prince. I can't say no to a cocktail with passion fruit in it especially one that's named after one of the best shows ever.\n\nThe bartenders are also very attentive. I was doing the most and poured a ton of their hot sauce on my shrimp and almost passed out. The only drinks available to me (water, the Fresh Prince, and a Mezcal shot I had not taken) could not cure me. I wasn't even being dramatic- just taking turns between the 3 drinks and somehow the bartender noticed and came to the rescue with wine that countered the heat. \n\nI would come back again with girlfriends and sit at the bar or another 3rd date and NOT sit at the bar.

Yes, EARTH.  It even beats the pork belly fusiony ones I've had elsewhere.  As is often the case with fusion tacos, the sauce does a lot of the work here; in this case it's an unagi based cream sauce.  Pure magic that you will be mopping up with whatever else you happened to order.\n\nOn the last visit, they were out of the Tuna Tacon, and our bartender (the one with the epic 80s aviator glasses) recommended Avocado Tacos.  WOW.  We expected these to be good because, well, they have avocado, but they were great, as the avocado was perfectly fried!\n\nIn the same league as the Tuna Tacon is the diabla shrimp, which is a bit like a spicey latin tikka masala; I assure you this is a good thing.  That is served with mushrooms, just enough rice, and a little bread.\n\nNow, I know I know I know you're going to order the Taco Tropical because it's supposedly the Most Famous Thing Here.

It was what I had expected, which was good, but not anything I haven't had before.\n\nThe kale salad was excellent and came as a pretty large portion to share between the two of us.  It was fresh, not bitter at all, and the perfect, healthy lead in to dinner.\n\nThe fish taco, though a bit messy, was delicious and rivals some of the better fish tacos I have had.  The flavor really pops in your mouth and if it weren't for the large portion of food we ordered, I would have gone back for seconds.\n\nThe avocado taco was also a pleasant surprise and was delicious, but it may have been a bit too hyped in previous reviews--I have not had dreams about that taco as expressed by a few others.  It was good, but not something I would crave.\n\nThe highlight of the meal was the squid.  Prepared, served, and seasoned perfectly with arugula, a bean spread, and an olive tapenade.  The squid was so soft, you almost couldn't tell it was squid--possibly the best squid dish I have ever had.\n\nLastly, we had the carnitas dish.  We were a bit full by then, but appreciated the pork, which wasn't over salted as many carnitas dishes are.  Combine that with the guacamole and the pickled veggies, and it was an enjoyable dish to close out the night.\n\nSorry...no room for dessert :-P\n\nThe environment was a little crazy, and we were able to eat at the bar in front of the kitchen where we got to watch them prepare the food.  The wait staff is friendly, but things were so hectic, we had to ask for things (water, water, and water) quite a few times to get what we wanted...so the service could have been better, but if you eat there, you'll see how crazy it gets and how some things can fall through the cracks.\n\nHappy Eating!", "author": "Bradley H."}

Lolo really knows how to make their food look good. Unfortunately, the food did not taste as good as they looked.\n\nWe started with some complimentary chips and salsa (red and green). The chips tasted fresh and the red salsa had a nice little spicy kick. I wasn't a fan of the green salsa though as it was too sour for my taste.\n\nThe taco tropical was a solid dish. The shrimp tasted great and the sauces complimented the shrimp very well.\n\nWe ended the meal with the avocado toast, which unfortunately was just not good at all. I'm not sure if it was an off day, but the toast just tasted bad. Usually I'm a fan of big servings, but it was honestly quite painful for me to finish this toast. The avocado toast tasted how one of those Chinese fish markets smell, and those fish markets smell pretty bad. The trout flavor was just way too fishy. It was like they sprinkled ocean water on this dish. I'm sad that this dish had to lower my rating of the restaurant so much, but honestly I was just not a fan at all of the avocado toast.

As in the huitlacoche, which came with requeson-stuffed wonton ravioli, the dishes and flavors are presented in a way that isn't necessarily 100% true to what you'd see in Mexican home cooking, but is nevertheless accessible to American tastes.

Would be back for some more! :)\n\nMexican Benedict Eggs: Came with two eggs over fried organic corn gorditas and refried beans. I was surprised at how big the portion was. This dish was the least of my favorite as it was not amazing to me.\n\nTuna Tacon: MY FAVORITE! The seared albacore tuna was DELICIOUS and FRESH. Each order comes with two tacos. Highly recommended ordering. :)\n\nAvocado Toast: Also, super delicious, except the toast was a little bit hard. Instead of slices of avocado, the avocado is made like a guacamole. Very creamy. What really surprised me was the smoked trout mixed in the guacamole. It was a perfect combination! \n\nCarnitas: We originally didn't order this dish until we saw the table next to ours had ordered it. Cute set up of how it was served. Big portions and very flavorful carnitas! Loved how the carnitas were not dry; however, I didn't like the tortillas that came with it as much. When we ran out of tortillas, we ate the carnitas with the chips and it was a much better combination to be eaten with.\n\nPrices are very reasonable. Service was excellent during brunch time.

The tiramisu is served in little bowls with chocolate on the side (never seen it served this way) and it was really really good.  One portion can be shared by two but trust that you'll be fighting over the mascarpone/cream mixture.  Some of the things I'd pass on next time would be the razor clams which I thought were a bit lost amongst the cheese/chorizo mixture. Also I prefer my salsa chunkier but that might just be personal preference.\n\nEverybody here from the hostess to the servers were very friendly and attentive.

The wait wasn't bad at all, and we were promptly seated. \n\nWe ordered four plates to share among the two of us. The chips and salsa they bring out to each table were great. I was a big fan of the chip basket. We ordered the fried brussels sprouts, ceviche, ahi tuna tostada (their special of the day), and the guacamole. The fried brussels sprouts were great - the zinfandel vinaigrette and the hazelnuts were amazing. The tuna tostada was also good - the perfect crunch with well-marinated fish. The guacamole was standard guac, but I did like the added touch of cotija cheese. The ceviche was the least memorable in my opinion. I like seafood, but the fish in the ceviche was not tender enough for me. I also thought the citrus flavor overpowered everything in the bowl of ceviche.

Their new location is super cute and often crowded. I had visited Lolos prior to the move and recall it being overrated, I admit this was my second choice since beretta had a 2+ hour wait. \n\nI returned tonight and was pleasantly surprised by the food, especially because many reviewers noted the quality having gotten worse since the move. I was especially impressed by their popular tacos tropical which were flavorful and fresh at the same time! And the best part was that the dishes were reasonably priced. \n\n* TACOS TROPICAL ($9) - 5 STARS:\nPanko and spice-dusted shrimp, topped with a tropical relish and spicy aioli. The aioli was creamy and flavorful in all the right ways. The jicama was a tortilla replacement that added crunch and freshness to the taco. What a surprising but delicious taco - I could eat this every day. \n\nWONTON RAVIOLI WITH HUITLACOCHE AND REQUESON ($13) - 1.5 STARS: \nHuitlacoche and requeson stuffed wonton ravioli with basil and arugula sauce and pine nuts. The arugula sauce was way too bitter for me and the filling didn't match the ratio to the wonton ravioli. \n\nGRILLED GRASS-FED ANGUS BEEF TACOS ($12) - 3 STARS:\nGrilled kobe beef tacos, hand-made flour tortillas, avocado, habanero infused radishes. This tasted mostly like a regular taco that you could get at any of the mission taquerias except the flour tortillas were noticeably fresh and delicious when topped with the complimentary salsas. \n\nTUNA TACON ($10) - 3.5 STARS:\nSeared albacore tuna, shellfish aioli, avocado, roasted tomatillo sauce on the side. This was my second favorite dish of the night, which tasted similar to the taco tropical, except it was filled with a block of tuna instead of shrimp and on a flour tortilla. \n\nAffordable wine, complimentary chips and salsa, a variety of solid tapas, Lolos is better than I remember!

Which is why it is so unfortunate that this 2 star review stems from our service and overall experience.\n\nMy group arrived at Lolo at our reservation time, 8 PM.  We were told it would be \"just a few minutes\".  This turned into about 25 minutes.  I usually can sympathize that certain tables love to hang out and hold up tables.  However, we continually saw staff sitting at these cleared tables chatting with their friends.  This was the beginning of the end for us.\n\nOnce we finally were seated, it was another 10 minutes before anyone greeted our table.  We did not even receive a \"Hi guys, I'll be with you in a minute,\" there was no interaction.  We kept watching servers and busboys fly by our table.  Then once our waitress came over she expected us to have our drink and food orders ready and did not provide a chance for us to ask any questions.  We quickly placed our drink order and a few small plates.\n\nThe food came out very quickly and was DELICIOUS!  Seriously some of the best food I have ever had.  I loved the octopus, the flautas, the guac, the diabla shrimp, and tacos.  Seriously everything was so good and not one complaint regarding the food.  Another downer was that we had all of this yummy food, but no drinks. We had a clear view of the bartenders shaking up margs all night, but ours took quite a while.\n\nAlthough my drink was delicious, my friend ordered something that she didn't quite love.  When she offered to just order something different, the waitress seemed very personally offended and then \"forgot\" to ring in her next order.\n\nOverall, nothing was coming out at the right times and constantly being ignored or feeling like an imposition is not fun.

I'm not a complainer and don't like to shut down people or leave a bad review but to be treated like this, lied too and pushed away isn't great customer service. When listening to the host, she would talk to me as if I was bugging her, acting very highly. But when it came down to people she knew, she treated them as royalty! Like I said, food was delicious but my experience was very disappointing and it was unprofessional. I'm being nice here.", "author": "Crystal M."}

I'd highly recommend the \"two bird one stone\" actually. But starting with the chips and salsa, uf. \n\nThe green salsa was really tart, like almost unbearably so! The corn we ordered was swimming in crema, when I am used to my Mexican corn slathered in mayo, lime, chili and cotija. The corn was also steamed/boiled, which was disappointing. The rest of our food, avocado tacos and flautas were also subpar. The taco had that same too tart salsa in excess, but would have been delicious if used in super moderation. And the flautas were just insipid, and the cheese was burnt to inedible at the ends. \n\nIf we were to come back, it'd be for the drinks but not really.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-10-15", "description": "It's rare for me to go to a restaurant, especially a tapas eatery, and be OK with ordering anything from the menu to share. Blame my picky palate on a \"meat and potatoes\" upbringing? Or maybe some people are more open to going into a meal relatively blind? Though my eating has become much more adventurous over the last few years, I usually have a \"type\" of dish and stick to it.\n\nNot at Lolo. Everything sounded so good! Yes, I was especially hungry. Salads for lunch have that effect. Even if I went in relatively content in the stomach region, I'd still eat (and drink!) a boatload here. \n\nFirst and foremost, the drink menu is perplexing... in a good way! It's hard to pick one cocktail to start. Do I have a traditional margarita? What about the Lone Wolf? Or I could have a glass of rose? Settled for something in the middle: Started with a mezcal margarita at the beginning of the meal and ended with a glass of Syrah. Just enough booze to mellow out and enjoy a Wednesday dinner.\n\nHere's just a few dishes that our group of 7 enjoyed:\n+ GUACAMOLE\n+ SQUID IN BLACK INK CROQUETAS\n+ FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS\n\nAs well as several house specialities that night. One dish, whose name I somehow forget, consisted of octopus, bacon and beans. It was heavenly, my favorite of the night! Just goes to show you that going slightly out of one's foodie comfort zone can be a good thing.\n\nIs Lolo good for groups? I'd say so! The restaurant is pretty large by SF standards, but definitely call ahead and reserve a booth. There's a clean/large bathroom for patrons, and I noticed they play island music inside (something like a rainforest CD from The Nature Store or maybe one of those Muzak stations for spas?) to relieve the jitters from those shy bladders out there. \n\nDefinitely plan on returning, would be a wonderful spot for girl's night out or date night. In fact, if I were trying to woo someone into liking me more, Lolo is where I'd take them! Drinks will loosen you up and small plates force you to share. Also, it's a great opportunity to figure out whether or not your +1 is willing to try new things... See where I'm going with this?", "author": "Abby S."}

I finally tried this place, and it didn't disappoint!\n\nMy friend and I have gotten into the habit of having dinner together to celebrate both of our aging. This year, we decided to go to Lolo. Actually, I gave her a list of options and she picked Lolo. SO glad she picked it!!\n\nWe met up around 5:30, and didn't realize Lolo opened at 6. Was all good, as the neighborhood is now a place you can wander around a bit. When we got back at 6, there was already a LINE! Yes, a LINE at 6PM! But it was a relaxed line, and we made sure other people who were there before us got seated first. Because...its polite.\n\nWe were seated near the back, right near the restrooms. Normally, I would be a bit peeved by this, but the space was done in a way that didn't have bathroom-anxious people waiting right next to us. Awesome!!\n\nOur waiter was super nice and helpful. We could only decide on a few items, and asked for his recommendation. He suggested their new menu item, a salmon al pastor taco, and we agreed. He also suggested 4 dishes for the 2 of us...which we did need to order another. We eat healthy, ok??\n\nThe food:\nBeats: Delicious and super creative. The cream cheese looked like bits of fat on a delicious beat steak. If you're a vegetarian, you'd go crazy over this dish. I don't tend to eat fat on my steak, so it was a little strange for me not to carve out the cream cheese. But don't carve it out. Its delicious.\n\nShiseido Peppers: Roasted peppers. Salt. Amazing. They're NOT spicy, despite being peppers. They're just delicious. I could eat 3 plates of those things.\n\nTuna Tacon: on the menu, they warn you about it being raw, so I expected it to be a lot more rare than it was. It was still delicious (though I had expected more tuna flavor). \n\nSalmon Al Pastor: SO good. We didn't know, but we were evidently the first customers who got this dish. And it was SO good I'm surprised not more people had it. The salmon was fully cooked (no tuna tacon!), and the flavors were great. It WAS on the sweeter side, but I assumed that had to do with the pineapple sauce-thing they had on it. While we were leaving, the owner (or chef? Manager? somebody...) asked us how it was. He seemed so relieved to know we loved it!\n\nFinally, the 5 add to our menu: Sopes with pork chin and oyster. It was really good, though the oyster was a little too giant for me. If you really like oysters, this is delicious for you. The oyster was the size of a child's hand. Seriously.\n\nThe ambiance is really cool. I'd recommend it for a first date, actually. If the person becomes dull, you can look at  or discuss the cool stuff on the walls. The waiters were STELLAR. Seriously. We were never low on water, and they changed our dishes quite frequently! All their staff were super friendly, and netted a significant tip from us. =)", "author": "Lily W."}

There was something about the sun shining that made my heart happy until I was greeted by a Lolo's waiter. \n\nWith his name remaining unknown, he took our order, friendly, typical as usual until he eyed my Souvla salad placed, shoulder aligned on the right side of the table. It wasn't long before he motioned his manager and asked if my salad (which I was nibbling now) was ok for me to eat. Quickly, the manager replied and the waiter very clearly delivered the message to us, \"Sorry guys, you cannot be eating outside food in here.\". \n\nNow, why am I giving my all time favorite restaurant, of which I rave about to my visiting friends, a one star rating? Because in the midst of our current political and geological disasters, SOMEONE managed to ruin and prohibit the consumption of a neighboring colleagues food EVEN THOUGH, myself and the individual with me, had ordered a generous amount of food. \n\nMy heart sunk, my appetite faded and my loyal love for Lolo crumbled. I felt sickened that in a city of liberalism and love, capitalism still prevailed. I was reminded that individuals will always be money motivated and towards people unsensitized. Unsensitized in a way that the consumer's needs and desires will not be met if it costs the business money. I understand that, but could it be that a business for a second not worry about money, but in the people and doing what is morally correct? In setting the scenario more, it wasn't like there were stomachs of individuals ligned outside the door to eat. It was casual, hip, cool like any other Lolo brunch day. My intent in ordering Souvla and then going to Lolo was because my accompanying individual wanted Lolo and although I did too, I also wanted a salad from Souvla. Now, would it have hurt the waiter to allow me to eat my salad in peace and enjoy our brunch? Undoubtedly, it hurt Lolo because they just lost a loyal customer.\n\nI am not proud to say that I had two chips of guacamole while I allowed my friend to eat, that out of rage I thought of cursing the waiter and its manager and that my sunny day ahead was ruined.\n\nI am sensitive and you should be too with these things because we're living through an anthropocentric revolting history! If I thought my feelings were hurt and my power as individual undermined- the right to eat- imagine those who fear life, not because of the animal kingdom, but because of people. \n\nI want people to know that if it's not hurting them, and that if as human beings it's the nice thing to do, allow it. People need to be more relational and uniting! This was just a small piece in the puzzle of hatred we are living. I forgive the waiter and his manager. I thank the other waiter who was more than willing to try and make our brunch better, but I hope that my post is read and understood that these things go beyond just trying to eat an outside salad at Lolo. \n\nIf you've read this far, thank you.\n\nSelena", "author": "Selena O."}

With now warning we were rudely asked to leave. The Restaurant and Merchants Association would LOVE to know this. We spent the entire time there ordering multiple rounds of food and drinks. \n\n~Response to Jorge (3/22)\n\nJorge - thank you for reaching out. I couldn't sleep last night because I was heartbroken that such an event spoiled me and my friend's beautiful evening. My mother integrated the lunch counters in North Carolina. People screamed racial epithets, spat at her, threw snakes on her and had dogs biting at her heels. I didn't know that as a daughter of this freedom fighter, I would be in a less hostile, but yet similar situation with the same outcome - we were forced to leave.\n\nWe arrived at ~6:30 to lolo after reading fantastic reviews. There were a number of places to choose from, but lolo stood out. The host, a petite Latina with dark, long thin hair sat us next to the wall at a table for two. There were only a handful of people who were there. We were seated directly next to the bar where the servers walk under that counter which you could lift up. The service was excellent at first. The food delicious. \n\nAs they were tapas, we continued ordering throughout our entire stay there. The tacos tropicales were especially good, so we ordered two rounds, the soup, ceviche and drinks along the way. As the evening grew on, the waiters came multiple times to clear our plates, but we weren't finished with the guacamole or ceviche and were still nibbling. \n\nThe same hostess whom I described above with very slight features came over at around 8ish (same time i posted my review)and abruptly asked us to leave or move to the bar. We asked why and she said the table was reserved. There was no reserved sign on the table nor were we told when we were seated that there was a reservation at that specific table. If there had been, we would have never sat there because we hadn't seen each other in a while and wanted to catch up.\n\nWe told her that we were not finished as we were just about to order another round. I looked around and the place was packed. There were no signs of other people leaving as everyone looked like they were having a great time, laughing and catching up with their friends - just like we were.\n\nWe were stunned and I asked her why did we, the only African-Americans, were the ones out of the entire restaurant who had to leave. She kept saying that the table was reserved. I asked her why she didn't tell us or simply ask other people to get up especially since we weren't finished.\n\nEveryone else was either white or Latinos, perhaps. She screamed at me that she was a minority, didn't like my attitude and that I was out of order for calling her out on her clearly targeted racist behavior. I told her to be nicer to people and we left shaking our heads. \n\nWe discussed how the complexion of the Mission had changed and how 'there is no place for us [African-Americans] here in SF.'  We are professionals who are well-established, connected and embrace all cultures. Clearly, with an experience like the one we had last night, we were so hurt by that. \n\nIsn't our money the same?

Because there will definitely be a next time here :) This place is great for hungry people in general and surprisingly perfect for three hungry vegetarians especially. \n\nWhat we ordered and our general thoughts: \nThe beets and kumquats goat cheese salad with coconut - Loved the kumquats, otherwise pretty typical. \n\nFried brussel sprouts (with hazelnuts and zinfandel vinaigrette) - Good, but found the vinaigrette a little too acidic for our liking. \n\nPanko avocado tacos - Delicious. Comes with pickled onions and is actually perfection. \n\nQueso fundido - Also delicious. Their corn tortillas were like corn masa blankets I wanted to get swaddled in and eat my way out of. \n\nMushroom empanadas - One of our party loved them, another felt the empanada crust was \"too flaky and not chewy\", whatever that means. \n\nFlautas with queso fresco - good. Certainly a well executed flauta but those avocado tacos are a hard act to follow. \n\nFish Tacos - only one member of our party had these and she ate them pretty quickly so we're surmising they were damn delicious. \n\nWe would definitely come back. We would try to the quesadillas and the tortilla soup and probably order the avocado tacos and queso fundido again. We would also try their brunch-- they do reservations, which is always a plus.", "author": "T K."}

He hit the nail on the head! Great food, great drinks and cool vibe. It was hot and I don't think they have AC but it was worth the sweat! Tuna tacos were outstanding. We were having to much fun and forgot to receive an explanation behind their style of food but it was really good. The place was packed. The crowd was cool and probably hip beyond our years but no one made fun of us! Might be a little pricey for some pocket books but their quality is high and I think it was worth the value for us I dropped over $111 which included drinks. Our first time in The Mission District. It is funky. Has lots of cool privately owned shops, restaurants and bars. Great place to kill a Sunday.", "author": "trent J."}

Though this is more of a 3.5 Stars than 4.\n\nParking was a madhouse! So be warned... We drove around for 15 minutes before finally finding parking, but once seated inside - the stress leveled out and we were able to soak everything in. It was a nice ambiance, but kind of hard to take cute snapshots so basics, be warned - it'll take a lot of work for that instaworthy photo.\n\nOnto the food, we ordered guac, ceviche, taco tropical, tuna taco, and beef taco.  Originally we wanted to try croissant toast also, but was warned that we may be ordering too much food - so feeling judged, we decided to cut something and those extra calories were let go. \n\nGuac - was standard, but the size was big enough to share. Wouldn't order again.\nCeviche - was yummy! Lot's of flavor and came with whole shrimps. The fried chip they came with was good and crunchy - I dig that.\nTaco Tropical - omg this was so eye-opening! After the first bite I had forgotten all about the stress that was parking and I was heart-eyed ready to proclaim this as my new favorite spot. It was SO good and refreshing. Taco shell was made of what seemed like a thinly sliced radish (like the ones they give you at kbbq) and all the flavors just popped in your mouth. I'm ready to come back and keep an order to myself.\nTuna Tacon - Not sure if something just didn't vibe with me and this one, but it was like I was on the biggest HIGH and then it came crashing down. Not a fan of this one, it tasted a little weird IMO. Would not recommend .. but seems like everyone talks about this one so maybe try at your own risk.\nBeef Taco - had lots of beefy goodness, though I can't say it blew me out of this world. Tastes like a regular beef taco - but it was meaty and had a charred grilled taste which I like. May or may not order again, depending on what other things I wanted to try.\n\nOverall I had a pretty good experience, it's a little big over the hump of mediocrity - mainly because of how damn delicious that Taco Tropical is. MMM. I saw alot of things on Yelp photos that looks bomb as well, so if I do come back - I'll aim for dinner instead of brunch.", "author": "Ngan T."}

Every wall has a different pattern, and decorations are so cute and quirky (I sat against a wall of origami sailboats). The food was wonderful as well! We started with the heirloom tomato salad special, and this dish was easily my favorite. The tomatoes were so fresh, juicy, and sweet (tasted just like summer!), and the cheese beneath was soft and spreadable, and it made me wonder why heirloom tomato salads are typically served with such solid, rubbery cheeses in the first place. Next, we had the taco tropical -- each bite was full of flavor, and it was such a great twist on shrimp tacos. We also really enjoyed the fried brussels sprouts and chicken confit tostadas.\n\nI'm so glad I had my first tapas experience at Lolo; I only wish I could have brought more friends along to try more tapas!\n\nEdit: I have since returned for brunch, and it is AWESOME.", "author": "Kelly R."}

The wait staff was very on top of things and the food was really well prepared and delicious. Our favorites were the ceviche and empanadas. \n\nThe only thing that might be unattractive about Lolo to some is how packed it is. It is not a quiet, intimate setting. When we went on a Saturday at 7pm, our table was separated from the adjacent table by approximately 1 foot. I am not exaggerating. This made it very difficult to talk about the people at the table next to us, which is one of our favorite dinner pastimes. We had no problem getting seated since we had a reservation - you should probs get a reservation. \n\nOh also, one clarification: These are Mexican Tapas.

Lolo served Huevos Rancheros on one blue corn tortilla and one blue corn tortilla on the side, then charges $4 for 4 more, home-made, blue corn tortillas. How is someone supposed to eat huevos rancheros without tortillas? How is it justified to charge the customer more money for such a basic ingredient? Not one jalepeno? Not one!. Salsa came in a small, really small bowl... but it looked 'authentic' 'rustic' so it must be real... please... Not one ounce of spicy hot sauce. Black beans were decent. Coffee was weak as fuck. Not one refill for coffee until the end of my meal. I had to guide the waiter thru the basic essentials of cuisine... what a joke. I'm sure white people don't know the difference. This one does and I felt ashamed to be a white person eating that food cause it wasn't real at all. I'm sure that there are other dishes that they create that they fuckin crush. But I'll never give them the benefit of the doubt, cause they insulted me with some ignorant ass breakfast. I'll never eat here again. Sad. Sad. Sad joke of a restaurant. I should stay home, get my own masa, and make my own tortillas.", "author": "Ryan B."}

I had a 8pm reservation and still got seating around 8:15pm. No big deal but a heads up that you may not be seated at your reservation time. There isn't really a 'waiting area' so everyone that is waiting to be seated crowds around the bar, which is small, and the front door. Just find a spot and awkwardly stand there until someone tells you to move or until you get seated. \n\nWe were seated at the table right next to the bar, which was also near the awkward standing space near the front of the door. Our table for 2 was literally right next to another table for 2...maybe 1 inch apart? It was def a first Tinder (or something) date and I could have listened to the entire convo if I wanted to. We couldn't separate the table more or else we would have hit the people sitting at the bar. \n\nIt's about $15 for a margarita.. I'd say that is standard SF price. \n\nFree chips and 2 types of salsa as soon as you sit down. Yay.\n\nI had the..\nShishito peppers: Some were spicy, some were not. They really didn't taste like anything but you get about 30? I wouldn't order them again. \n\nGuacamole: It was aite. Pomegranate seeds on top was a nice, fresh touch - I've never seen this before. You're supposed to eat this with the free chips that come out in the beginning. The guac was just ok - we ended up eating it throughout the meal. I wouldn't get it again just because there wasn't anything special about it except the 8 pom seeds that were sprinkled on top. \n\nFish tacos: So delicious and I don't even like fish. You can't taste the fish and the peanut sauce thing they give with it is a really nice pairing. I would have ordered this again if I wasn't so full. \n\nBeef sliders: Pass. The beef was SUPER tough, not easy to chew, and not tender. I guess those three means the sort-of-ish same thing but either way, I wouldn't get it. \n\nCrab croquette: Tasted fishy.. crabby? I did not like this and it wasn't very crispy for something that is supposed to be crispy. The inside was very very moist (too moist) and whatever sauce was on the serving plate (I think it was soy sauce based)... it was just too much. The white sauce was also weird. Mehhhhh. I wouldn't get it again. \n\n\nThere were some items on the restaurant menu that weren't on the online menu so I was pleasantly surprised by this. \n\nThis was a fun dining experience. I liked all the tapas that came out, even though I didn't love all of them. I would for sure go back to try the other menu items. \n\nThe service was great and the food came out pretty fast. I'd try to be seated in the back where it seemed less crowded next time. It's also pretty dark in there because of the low lighting. Ambiance, you know?

She did try to make it up around 9:15 p.m. by saying let me get you guys drinks while you wait but then she charged us for those even though she made it seem like they would be free because of our troubles. Oh, and did I mention that she somewhat talked trash about other diners by telling us that she has a table for us but for some reason \"the people there are just sitting around playing with their phones even though they've already paid.\" Well they get to do that, they are your customers.

Unfortunately, I'm knocking off a star (I wish I could give half stars) because I had a bout of food poisoning shortly after eating here. \n\nMy sister and I decided to go here for our traditional birthday celebration by dining out with just us two and made reservations on their Yelp page at 6:30.We arrived a little earlier at 6:15 but were seated right away. We started with drinks, ordering the sangria (very good, not too strong but sweet) and another drink (I unfortunately forgot the name) with watermelon juice, mezcal, and a couple other things. Definitely need to come back to try all of their cocktails because my sister and I wanted to try ALL OF THEM-- they just sounded too tasty and we had a hard time choosing which one we wanted.\n\nOkay...onto the food. We ordered:\n-guacamole: guacamole was good, especially with the cotija cheese. I'm not sure I would get it again though since we were already given chips and salsa to start with.\n\n-fried brussel sprouts: one of my favorite dishes of the night. The sprouts were crispy, not too oily and went extremely well with the onion and hazelnuts. I'm making sure I order this every time in the future.\n\n-tuna tacon: very good tacos; albeit small, they pack a lot of flavor and I loved that they toasted the tortilla slightly so it gave the taco a bit of a crunchier texture.\n\n-taco tropical: sooo light and airy, I love the daikon concept for the \"tortilla\" of this taco. The result was a very light taco, and the breading on the shrimp was so light and crisp! I loved this taco.\n\n-huitlacoche: one of my other favorite dishes of the night. The sauce was really creamy and yummy, I wish I had more bread to dip it in! Pine nuts were a very nice touch.\n\nService was fine, though it took them a while to notice that we had finished our dinner and were trying to get their attention for some to-go boxes. \n\nAbout my food poisoning...my sister and I took BART to get here and by the time we were about to board at 16th St., I started feeling very dizzy. Found seats (thank goodness) and that's when I felt profuse nauseousness and dizziness come on. Then come the clammy hands, extreme heat and an unbearable amount of sweating dripping down my face and neck. Vision became blurred and very bright, flashes every time I blinked O__o The whole time I was just hoping that I wouldn't shit/pee myself, vomit, or pass out because then I would be \"that girl who ___ on BART\" and my sister probably couldn't carry me.\n\nI love Lolo and their food but I admit that I am very hesitant at this point to go back.

When we showed up, the hostess said there was something apparently wrong with their reservation site and we didn't have a table. She did offer us seats at the counter which we took and were glad we did.  It was fun watching corn tortillas be hand made and watch the kitchen put together the plates. Our server was absolutely lovely and attentive. The complimentary chips were thin and not too heavy and the salsas that came with the chips tasted fresh and had great flavor. Here's our rundown of what we ordered:\n\n- Heirloom tomato and burrata \"salad\": fresh, flavorful, juicy tomatoes with a creamy, melt-in-your-mouth burrata. This was excellent!\n- Panko avocado taco: two great vegetarian tacos with a good helping of avocado and tart oaxaca cheese. This was one of my favorites, the panko-crusted avocado was original and tasted amazing.\n- Empanadas: vegetarian empanadas with mushrooms, oaxaca, corn, and peppers. Very, very cheesy with a nice crispy shell. \n- Flautas: Crispy shell with a generous queso fresco filling topped with a huge pile of shredded lettuce and cream. Cheesy, amazing, refreshing with the lettuce.\n- Fish tacos: Pretty standard fish tacos in corn tortillas but the fish was fried perfectly and the handmade corn tortillas were a real gem.\n*** For vegetarians, just prepare yourself for all vegetarians dishes to be very cheesy! Everything was so good but I wish there were some other dishes that didn't have cheese because it did end up being a bit heavy by the end!\n\nWhen we were done with dinner, the hostess actually came up to us and apologized for not having a table for us and offered us either free dessert or free shots. What??? This kind of stuff was offered when I used to live in North Carolina but has never happened here, even when we've had disastrous dinners. We said it was no big deal and we really didn't need anything extra because our dinner was wonderful but she insisted. So I asked for flan to go. Not only did she return with our flan to go (which, by the way, was incredible. Beautiful caramel flavor and had a nice, firm texture) but also came back with two shots of Mezcal.

Every dish was damn tasty although I could have probably ate numerous dishes of the taco tropical and the chicharron! \n\nOn top of the amazing food and drinks, service was top notch and the decor looked like something someone who smoked too much while wandering around in a junk yard in Tijuana, threw together.

The decor is really interesting, pictures of dogs everywhere, bright and fun colors, car doors on the wall, blown-up photos of palm trees are just a few of the things that you'll probably notice. We had fantastic, friendly, and quick service and loved our food. We love trying different restaurants whenever we head up to SF from San Jose but recently decided to eat at Lolo again when my bf's sister was in a town - high compliments from us to Lolo! I'm sure we'll be back again. When you've finished your meal, don't forget to stop for a coffee down the street at Ritual Roasters.\n\nThe food highlights:\n\ncripsy chilaquiles - fried tortilla chips bathed until tender in salsa, peppers, cotija cheese, queso fresco, and sour cream. Mmmm, so good. Make sure to add eggs for a hearty breakfast (and the perfect hangover cure).\n\ntaco tropical - panko crusted shrimp, tropical relish, and and spicy aioli on jicama tacos. Definitely the best thing there!\n\nceviche - shrimp and rock fish citrus roasted pepper sauce, avocado, corn nuts.

You should try to book a reservation in case it's a busy day. Luckily, my friend and I were able to sit at the bar at 7:30, which is actually fine for dining between 2. I liked that we were side to side (felt more intimate). \n\nI will warn you that everything on their menu sounds so delicious! We shared 5 dishes,1 drink each. If you're very hungry, 5 will be enough and to be honest, you should probably just get 4....\n\nTUNA TACON: Tuna + avocado in a tortilla? Simple but oh so tasty. I thought the sauce pulled it all together (it was almost like a soy or teriyaki sauce) as it added saltiness to your otherwise very refreshing bite. I also liked the tortilla they used. I could snack on these all day! \n\nEMPANADAS: These might have been my favorite. Just very fresh and cooked perfectly. Soft, flaky bread on the outside with juicy mushrooms and corn inside. Mmm! \n\nCEVICHE: Maybe a little too acidic (citrus-y, sour) for me BUT I freaking LOVEDDD the corn nuts!!!! It added great crunch and contrasted well against the fresh acidity. I also liked the thin chips that were included. More crunch crunch! Overall, I would totally get this again.\n\nCARNITAS: I have to admit that I think El Techno's carnitas are a bit more flavorful and tender, but Lolo's are still good! Add the pickled onions and guac to your taco. All those flavors will be very satisfying. \n\nFRESH PRINCE (cocktail): I'm a sucker for cocktails that have egg whites in them. Makes the drink fresh and also adds a heavier consistency. Fresh Prince was refreshing and a bit fruity (citrus) with perfect amount of alcohol. \n\nI need to come back to try more of their dishes. Or, I might reorder all of the above again! Either way, I'll be a happy gal. \n\n*Good for friend catching-up or date nights!", "author": "Stephanie B."}

Brussels sprouts were the right amount cooked and SO SO SO good.\n- Fried avocado taco - YUM, the avocado was so buttery and all the sauces blended so well together. I even put some of the guac on here cuz you can never have too much avocado :)\n- Tropical taco - the taco wrapper is made of jicama so it's gluten free, and besides being super unique, it was also delicious (though the avocado taco was my fave).\n\nQuite busy so make a reservation if you're coming with a big group (or be prepared to sit at the bar).\n\nYum yum yum!", "author": "Christina C."}

Oh...my...gluttony...the taco tropical?!?! I never thought I'd enjoy eating a daikon as a tortilla -- much less, crave it -- but now I know. Everything in the taco tropical was so well-balanced, light, and flavorful, that I can understand why it's the main hit on the menu. The brussel sprouts were slightly charred and accompanied with toasted chickpeas and sauteed onions, and the portion was large enough that we couldn't even finish it. The ceviche was also excellent. The tuna tacon tacos featured a meaty slab of tuna tartare that tasted on par with other restaurants in SF, but it wasn't as mindblowingly good as the other dishes we ordered. \n\nThe ambience is playful and inviting, just like the food.

It gave it a hint of rose, like a rose tea. I loved every sip. But it could've been a lot stronger (in terms of alc) -- my friend and I both loved our drinks but thought they were a bit weak. \n\nThen the TACOS -- taco tropical and tuna tacon. Taco tropical is a great shrimp taco that is so soft I thought it was fish, and wonderfully light and flavorful because of the daikon radish rather than a tortilla. The tuna tacon was also delicious -- more savory but a good pairing with the taco tropical. The tacos are a must here -- their flavor complexity is on point. \n\nFinally I ordered the lamb sliders and my friend the empanadas. We liked both but definitely thought the tacos stole the show. Lamb sliders were a bit too savory in my opinion -- but the addition of the jalape\u00f1o peppers was a nice balance. What I will say is this was by far the most filling dish, so if you come with someone who's concerned they won't be full order this one!

Alas, the food and service were disappointing.\n\nOur waitress kept disappearing for way too long (well-intentioned but rather oblivious and inattentive). At one point my friend and I were left aghast when a bus boy tried to take our plates away while we were still clearly eating. (I could maaaaaaaaaaybe forgive him if he was feeling anxious and there were a lot of people waiting but by that point there were empty tables galore and no one in line.) I ordinarily have a lot of patience but this was just inexcusable.\n\nOf course, the food could have redeemed Lolo but it just really wasn't all that. The kale salad with gaja apples, cotija cheese and lime vinagrette was my favorite dish (which just feels wrong in a Mexican restaurant). The empanadas were pretty good but a little oily (I prefer Limon's rendition). The grilled beef taco was tasty, but the tuna tacon one (which we ordered upon the recommendation of our waitress) was atrocious. It tasted like a Japanese-Mexican fusion dish heavy on the mayo ... just completely unappealing.\n\nOn the bright side, the space is amazing. Wasn't quite understanding the suit jackets pinned to the wall as decor, but the high ceilings and vibrant colors made Lolo feel pretty fun. Did I mention the margs are absolutely delicious, too? Quite possibly my fave in the city.\n\nNext time I'll come for the sangria + margaritas, and eat dinner elsewhere.", "author": "Tiffany W."}

I'm a sucker for cocktails with egg whites in them so I usually order The Fresh Prince...

Our group couldn't help but admire the suit jacket bench, or the car doors on the wall.  We were seated in a booth, and our joyful senses rejoiced some more, when we read the menu items.  Very clever use of ingredients (liquid smoke) in the cocktails.  Sounds off, but really tasty in the 1451 Stevenson.  Other drinks ordered were gold slinger, haimacon, mezcal mile, sangria, and margaritas with a chili salt rim.  Although the cocktails were $11 ($8 for sangria), we were feeling the good vibes, that it didn't matter.\n\nOn to the food, we went towards more the vegetarian options, since we had one in our group.  We ordered:\n\nBrussels Sprouts, roasted to perfection with chickpeas.\nBeers with corona cheese with parsley oil dressing, heavenly.\nPanko crusted avocado with pickled red onion, surprisingly the heartiest dish for us, so good.\nTuna Tropical, ahi fish taco, unfortunately the fish was overcooked and dry.\nSquid ink sopas with squid ink sauteed calamari, cilantro cream, and topping of micro greens.  I loved it, not to overwhelming fish taste, the sopas had crispy edges, and held up pretty well considering that the calamari and greens were on top.  \nPortions were perfect for sharing in a group of 4.\n\nTo me, the best part of any dining experience, is asking myself, was I full.

After many a failed attempt in the past to come to Lolo (usually as a result of waiting to make impossible last minute reservations with a large group), I finally made it out here (well, without reservations) a few weeks back. After a half hour wait or so on a Saturday night, the three of us are seated outside, and order [ Photo: http://instagram.com/p/dLS1BCQfsr/ ]:\n\n* Brussel Sprouts - Not nearly as good as the ones you can get at Marlowe, Barbacco, or Burma Superstar, both lacking in flavor and crispness.\n\n* Oxtail Empanadas - While I don't remember the particulars, these were definitely good, and had pretty great flavor to them.\n\n* Figs Serrano - One of their specials for the night, I believe, these were roasted figs stuffed with bleu cheese, served on slices of prosciutto. Tasty when eaten together with the prosciutto, but personally a little too bleu for me (my friends loved it though).\n\n* Huitlacoche Ravioli - So, one of my friends loves ordering food that she finds to be really strange. That's what this dish happened to be (and fortunately, it was actually rather tasty). For those who don't know, huitlacoche is corn smut, which is a type of plant fungus that causes smut disease on corn crops. Yup, and you just ate it.\n\n* Tuna Tacon - Probably my second favorite dish of the entire mean, and just plain... tasty. Be sure to try it.\n\n* Taco Tropical - As well as this one. While this came in second for my friends, I absolutely loved the explosion of flavor with these \"tacos\", which are actually served on thin slices of radish, rather than tortillas.\n\nIf you're going to check out Lolo (and you really should), do yourself a favor and make reservations ahead of time! This place is poppin', so, unless you like waiting (and many a San Franciscan seem to)...\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Since we were seated outside, I can't really comment on the accessibility inside. There are two walled off halves to the restaurant, and the side we sat in front of seemed like it made for a tight fit inside. Outdoor seating is marginally more accessible, but the table legs are likely to get in the way.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try, so no comment.", "author": "Johnny W."}

However, each year it seems to get progressively worse (i.e. quality) and I've learned there are far more superior places to go for tapas. Lolo is a prime example; all the tapas are made with top-notch ingredients and are packed with BOLD Turkish flavors with a Latin flair.  \n\nOn Wednesday, 6.22.11, I came to Lolos for dinner with my cousin and his wifey. I tried making reservations on OpenTable for 6 PM but they didn't have that time available. However, when I tried calling, they had 6 PM available so if you're looking for a day/time that's not available online, call Lolo instead. \n\nF O O D\nEach dish is made for two people, however, they can add an extra taco or slider to the order for three people. \n\n*SEASONAL SPECIAL: Softshell Crab Tacos w/ Peanut Sauce ($21 for 3) - 5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1hMD7RQogPDWpE-p3LKjXA?select=4mxWdTXPzRYzJW2ZUh6qig\nDELICIOUSLY SCRUMPTIOUS!!! The softshell crabs were fried to golden brown and were light and crispy. You can tell it was uber fresh as the crab was tender with a succulent sweetness. The aioli sauce added a creamy layer with a tangy bite. \n\n*LAMB SLIDERS On Brioche & Porcini Mushroom Sauce ($10 for 2) - 4.5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1hMD7RQogPDWpE-p3LKjXA?select=Pf8bOEtQs-ydf1kOiPMBAw\nTucked between two buttery toasted brioche buns was one of the most juiciest and flavorful lamb patties I've ever had. The creamy porcini sauce was amazing and added a profound depth of savory and earthy flavor to the sliders. \n\n*PISTACHIO ENCRUSTED SALMON w/ Wasabi Cream Sauce ($11) - 4.5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1hMD7RQogPDWpE-p3LKjXA?select=pRNPsfPuagNqWJsG6Msaaw\nPerfectly seared to a rare, the salmon was delicately soft and moist. The pistachio gave it a nice, nutty crispness while the wasabi added an ever so light nose tingle. \n\n*GORDITAS - Blue Corn Masa w/ Beef Short Ribs, Avocado, Roasted Three Chili Sauce & Pickled Onions ($18 for 3) - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1hMD7RQogPDWpE-p3LKjXA?select=-yihAfrjHIFeGgkscne0Ag\nTender, melt-in-your-mouth short ribs topped the fresh corn masa. The avocado added a buttery layer while the chili sauce added a fiery kick and the pickled onions a burst of tanginess. \n\n*HEARST RANCH MEATBALLS Slow Cooked in Morita Sauce ($14) - 4 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1hMD7RQogPDWpE-p3LKjXA?select=3M2G7sJXRdCIXNS5SICOag\nServed in a cast iron pot, the meatballs were very rustic. They had a good sear on the outside which helped maintain the juiciness inside. The morita sauce was savory and tangy with a slight kick. I love the addition of the cream sauce which added a layer of richness. Don't forget to use the complimentary bread to sop up all the yummy deliciousness from the sauce!\n\n*OXTAIL TOASTADA w/ Capers, Morito Peppers, Rancho Gordo Orca Bean Puree & Fresh Cream ($8 for 2) - 3.5 STARS!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/1hMD7RQogPDWpE-p3LKjXA?select=cjl5W3Lh1Na5EITkxWOEqA\nAtop the crispy toastada was a heaping mound of soft, tender shredded oxtail meat that had a hearty beefy flavor. I didn't care much for the capers or the bean puree as it slightly hindered the meaty flavor, but the fresh cream gave it a nice creamy zip.\n\nS E R V I C E\nJUST OK. Service could have been much better especially when we were the only party in one of the dining rooms, but I'm not going to knock off a star because the food was delicious through and through! Our server was friendly but it felt contrived. Our foodrunner/buslady had a permanent sour face tattooed to her face; it doesn't hurt to smile once in a while does it?

There are two dining areas; one with all sit down tables and the other with one long communal table with sit down tables. I thought the \"chirping\" sound effect in the bathroom was a nice touch adding to the tropical theme.\n\nP A R K I N G\nEasy street parking before 6 PM on weekdays and challenging parking thereafter and on weekends.

Yezzzzzz! \n\nEat here if you want very generic food that could be Mexican fusion but has both modern and authentic flavors wrong.\n\nPlus side! \nOther reviews said that the drinks were good, I agree.  I can safely say that they have a traditional feel but are more refreshing.  Stay away from any of the drinks that seem a little spicy because they are but if you like something more refreshing, take your pick.  \n\nNegatives!\nWhen I read the websites description of what the owners vision was for the way the food should taste, I was really excited!  I love tradition Latino food and i get turned on (Wink Wink) when most of the food is Mexican.  Then I read that it was Latino food with a twist, I was even more excited! I love trying new flavors and new versions of the traditional food I love, after all, I am a fatty! and fatty's love food! \n\nHere is where they went WRONG.  They chose food that were very ethnic but cooked in the way that only a micro pocket of Latin America would cook it. There is nothing wrong with that except that it lacked flavor and they used non traditional ingredients. \n\nFor being overpriced, why not use better ingredients?  I really don't mind paying more, but don't insult me by saying that the food is high quality. They chose the cheapest traditional food they could think of and charged the highest price they could get away with.  Please try more traditional restaurants, eat here, and judge for yourself.    \n\n!!! In conclusion !!!.  There is more than10 restaurants around the corner that are  amazing! YES, they are a little more mom and pop, might not have alcohol, but I promise you that you will enjoy the food, like the feel of the restaurant, leave feeling like you just had food the way mom would have made it, and above all support small ethnic owned restaurants .

We made reservations for a Saturday brunch and got seated right away in one of the booths up front. I love the oosh and fun ambience -- high ceilings and the colorful walls and booths of the restaurant. Service was excellence -- very attentive and professional. A bit pricey and the plates are relatively smaller in portions since its tapas style. The food came out super fast. It's a great choice of a girls night out or date spot. \n\nOut group of four feasted on: \n-- Chips and salsa: complimentary on the house. The salsa was spicy and delicious. Chip was crunchy and fresh. I love free stuff! \n-- Croissant French Toast: this would have been a great sweet dish in a different meal, but it didn't fit well with the other dishes we ordered which were more spicy and sour. The texture was kind of like a doughy pancake. Pretty good, but didn't stand out compared to other dishes.\n-- Avocado Tacos: the BEST dish of all that we ordered. The avocado was warm and creamy, and balanced the crunchy crust perfectly.\n-- Kale Salad: loved all the fresh ingredients in this Kale salad - the apple shreds, the candied walnuts, the goat cheese, and more. The vingrette was a bit too sour for my liking but overall tasted very clean and healthy. \n-- Tuna Tacon: order this by popular demand but it didn't live up to the hype. Still a very good dish though. The tuna was a bit tough but the flavors wet super on point. \n-- Lamb Slider: another order by popular demand that did not live up to the hype. I liked the textures of the lamb with the mushroom cream sauce but the flavors were a bit lacking. \n-- Corn On a Cobb: not a fan of this dish. I thought the creaminess of the cheese was overwhelming and the flavors didn't mix very well.", "author": "Ellen W."}

Aka me.\n\nThe energy at this place is super contagious and lemme tell yah, I already can't wait to go back. Once inside, you can't help but stare at the vibrant walls filled with crazy-eccentric d\u00e9cor.\n\nThink: walls covered in car parts and different colored spoons, old suit jackets are sewn into booths and tropical murals behind the bar.\n\nDrawing inspiration from the vibrant street markets of Mexico, this family-owned restaurant has created a unique experience for all San Franciscans to enjoy in our very own Mission district.\n\nThe first \"must get\" are these tacos called:\n\n+ Taco Tropical ($9/2 tacos): It's a modern twist on a taco. The \"tortilla\" is a slice of jicama (type of root used in Mexican cuisine) and is topped with panko shrimp, and aioli/relish, and pineapple.\n\nThe shrimp was perfectly cooked, moist on the inside with a crispy outer layer. The use of jicama gave it a refreshing and unsuspecting crunch.\n\nIt's life changing. I wish more tacos places would make use this jicama.\n\n+ Next,  I was blown away by this Avocado Toast (~$10/2 pieces).\n\nI know, I know. You're prob thinking \"It's just avo on toast.\"\n\nBut trust me, this is not your average slice of bread with a few slices of avocado on top.\n\nIt's a thin, pan-toasted slice of olive oil bread, topped with a generous helping of avocados chopped into a chunky-guacamole consistency with: smoked rainbow trout, capers, sun dried tomatoes, and arugula dressed with meyer lemon olive oil.\n\n+ Third, these lamb sliders are what they're known for. While I personally wasn't a fan (I thought it was too dry), everyone else seems to rave about it.\n\nIt comes on a brioche bun w/ porcini mushroom sauce.\n\nIf you're a fan of lamb sliders, these might be your thing. But if you don't like anything too \"gamy,\" I'd pass on these.\n\n+ We all loved the ceviche ($12). It's made with shrimp and rock fish, a citrus roasted pepper sauce, avocado, and salted corn. Overall, the fish was very fresh and the flavors worked very well together.\n\nMy only wish is that they'd give us more than three pieces of chips! \n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nCome to Lolo for some bomb Mexican food and drinks. They do it right during brunch with the girls and I'm sure they're equally as impressive for a fun a dinner date.\n\nIf you get anything here, you must try the tacos and avocado toast.\n\nPS: they're open late on the weekends, till 1am.\n\nTip: make your ressies before you go!

The food is an inventive take on traditional Mexican flavors. I think there is usually a wait to get in, but we came right when it opened on a Saturday and we were seated immediately.\n\n- Taco Tropical ($9/2 tacos): VERY interesting modern twist on a taco. The \"tortilla\" is a slice of jicama (type of root used in Mexican cuisine) and is topped with panko shrimp and aioli/relish that includes pineapple. It has a very refreshing/down-by-the-beach flavor and texture combination.\n\n- Tuna Tacon ($10/2 tacos): While simpler in presentation than the Taco Tropical, the Tuna Tacon was my favorite piece of the meal. The seared albacore paired perfectly with the tomatillo sauce in creamy and raw flavors. Even the tortilla was better than tortillas at regular taquerias.\n\n- Fried Brussel Sprouts ($6): I have concluded that roasting brussel sprouts is the only way to go. Frying achieves a similar crunch, but is probably more unhealthy. The sauce was tangy and the hazelnuts were an interesting twist, but these were just ok compared to other brussel sprouts I've had.\n\n- Avocado Toast (~$10/2 pieces): This is not your average slice of bread with a spread/slices of avocado on top. A thin, pan-toasted slice of bread is topped with a very generous helping of avocados chopped into a chunky-guacamole consistency and mixed with herbs and capers. I don't like capers at all, but they gave a very unique citrus/pickled kick to the creamy avocados.\n\nLolo can get a bit pricey if you're looking for a filling meal, but the food is such a unique and engaging experience.

I kindly asked the server if they ran out of cotija, and they said no, and brought out a bowl of ACTUAL cotija cheese for us.  Make sure you know your ingredients!!!\n\n- GRILLED ASPARAGUS (with queso fresco and roasted red bell peppers) - the asparagus was cooked nicely (good tenderness/firmness), and wasn't too salty.  That with the queso and the roasted red bell peppers made for a light and delicious dish. Clean flavors \n\n- SQUASH BLOSSOM and OAXACA CHEESE 'QUESADILLAS' with guac, sour cream, and salsa - this dish is fried, but not as heavy tasting as it looks.  Was quite delicious, but a muddled squash blossom flavor.\n\n- GAMBAS BRAVAS - basically, it just some shrimp in some tasty oil\n\n- HUITALCOCHE - my FAVORITE dish of the night : requeson stuffed wonton wrappers with basil and arugula sauce, and pine nuts.  Deliciously light, with a creamy faint \"pesto-like\" flavor.  I want to replicate this dish at home! \n\nCome here without any expectations, and you will enjoy yourself.

I think the sauce may be too strong for the taco, and somehow I only had sweet and sour in my mouth after first bite. Radish shell and topping are all taste sweet and sour so that mat be the reason. \n\nBerry trifle (dessert): it has interesting taste when you have everything together, from top to the bottom. I hope they can have more berry flavors with the dessert due to the name of this dessert. \n\nOverall, I like this place and wanna try their dinner menu for sure.", "author": "Jing Y."}

It's just a couple of blocks from the BART station so very easy to get to. \n\nWe had reservations for Friday night and were seated promptly. The place has a fun atmosphere, very cool colorful decor. Their menu is strictly tapas.. there are no main dishes. Which is fine.. you can order more of the tapas! Their wine list, cocktails, mezcal menu was extensive. We ended up ordering 3 cocktails each ($9-10 reasonable). Most of the cocktails we really enjoyed except for a couple.. the Mexihattan was ok. And another drink tasted a little like cough medicine but it's prob my taste. They were all pretty strong though.\n\nTapas:\n- fried brussel sprouts were good, pretty big order\n- dungeness crab croquettes very good\n- cheese fondue was served with heating element at the bottom so that was cute.. but fondue itself was just ok\n- tuna tacos (I think?) were good\n- beef empanadas were good\n- ravioli served with green sauce (forget the name).. really liked, it was very creamy\n- dessert Mexican creme brulee (I think) was good\n\nOverall I think this place tries hard to impress. The dishes have flair and imagination. Service was good. And the prices were reasonable. Definitely something to try.", "author": "Vol T."}

You enter a cozy sized anteroom with some squished tables and seating, then after a few twists in and turns through the rabbit hole in an Alice in Wonderland-esque fashion one is confronted with the high contrast party that never ends and felt as if frozen in amber -it was quite a lot to absorb all at once. Oversized plastic lady bugs perched upside down, as the Polkadot light shades adorn the long bar with dangly pom poms, tactile woven back rests for back table seating. A sea of origami boats line the back wall behind the bar, the Isadora refried beans posters decoupaged onto bathroom door (very humorous!)\n\nWhile the theatrics of the atmosphere itself is lightly playful, and the staff friendly and welcoming.. When it came down to the food I was completely surprised by the juxtaposing seriousness.  I had croquetas filled with black ink squid and shishito peppers plaited on a slate slab, with some aioli, and pickled onion for a hint of spice on the side.  The oxtail empanadas were well seasoned and flavorful, with fresh crisp red cabbage. \n\nAll was perfectly complimented by my Black Mojito (as it would appear I ate in a themed colorized manner for the night) Kraken rum, vanilla mint, meyer lemon all melded together for a subdued tart molasses type of sweetness.\n\nCheques delivered in little booties -too cute!", "author": "Ty T."}

But it is a new way to have avocado and I love avocado. The whole taco has a creamy, comfort-food sort of quality to it. Avocado slice is rolled in panki and flash fried -- yum.\n\nCarnitas - I loved this. The banana leaf gives the pulled pork a distinct flavor that goes really well with the guacamole and salsa they given you to build your tacos. Nice subtle smoky flavor to the meat. Pickled onion is an underused topping that really adds an awesome burst of flavor.\n\nGuacamole - I'm a bit of a guacamole purist -- I want to taste mostly avocado, and a bit of cilantro and onion, basically. I don't like too much overpowering avocado. The guacamole here has a lot going on. Salsa and cheese (?) are poured over the top, which makes for a flavorful guacamole, but not adhering to the most traditional expectations of flavor and texture. Freshly done though and satisfying.\n\nChips - Do the job, but I would've liked them to be salted a little.\n\nSalsa - Freshly made. First batch that came out was rather hot and spicy. Waiter brought us more when it ran out (we didn't need to ask) and the second batch was much more mild. This is a very thin pureed salsa. Is it not like a pico de gallo, which is my preferred style of salsa. But the freshness and flavor is still great.\n\nCrab croquettes - Awesome. Balancing the garlic aioli was a rather sweet sauce that really pulled the dish together and made it a surprise hit for the table. Nice one-bite starter to share for four people. as four croquettes came with it.\n\nGorditas - Subtle barbecue flavor that left me wondering whether the dish wanted to be barbecue pulled pork or not. It was good, but too in-between that I would either get the carnitas or go somewhere else for southern BBQ pulled pork sliders. With that being said, I still happily enjoyed them.\n\nBeef tacos - seemed kind of like a pile of grilled beef to me with not much else going on. But the beef lovers of the group raved about them.\n\nShrimp tacos/taco tropical - I did not have these but others at the table loved the flavors. Said it was reminiscent of sushi with the creamy aioli and spicy flavor.\n\nDrinks - Pretty good too. Beware that anything with mezcal will have a smoky flavor. The margarita salt also has that flavored, so I salted rim may make the drink less traditional tasting.\n\nOverall:\n\nLoud place with the sort of atmosphere for a good time. If you're not drinking and you're not sharing your food, you're doing it wrong. Come with a group and order several items.

At the table we had steak tacos, empanadas, fish tacos and ceviche. I enjoyed the ceviche and the little bread/cracker thing you eat with it, but I didn't think it was out of this world or the best shrimp ceviche I have ever had. \n\nThe starts of our dinner were the mushroom empanadas and the fish tacos. My personal favorite was the empanada - you wouldn't expect it to pack such a punch! The flavor of the mushrooms combined with the rest of the ingredients was soo flavorful and balanced. I know I will be dreaming about this dish for awhile. \n\nThe fish tacos were also reallyy good (and I have had a million fish tacos!) Definitely worth ordering even if you normally don't get fish. The fry on the cod was nice but not overbearing. The tortilla was super soft, felt fresh and authentic. Finally the star of this dish was the mayo/slaw concoction they had topping the fish, yummo!!!

Their drinks menu is creative and everything tastes as perfect as it looks.  If you're a mezcal enthusiast, this is your go-to spot.  The Loter\u00eda-inspired cocktails are my favorite.  Each one is completely different, you should seriously just try them all.  El Cotorro has chia seeds.  El Cantarito comes in an earthy clay terracotta container filled with crushed ice and mint.  La Dama is an egg drink with cute little rose petals on top.  La Sandia (watermelon) is so tasty too...  Nothing here is boring.  Drinks here tend to be on the strong side, particularly the Mezcal drinks, since Mezcal has a high alcohol content.  If mezcal isn't your thing, there's tons of incredibly delicious non-mezcal options too.\n\nThey also have great fusion-y latin foods and generously sized tapas.  My friends love the gluten-free options available on the menu.  Some of my favorite menu items so far are the taco tropical with jicama tortilla (!), avocado taco, cheese fondue, shishito peppers, and the top sirloin which pretty much blew my mind.  Near the kitchen, you can watch the tortilla lady make fresh tortillas by hand.  Brunch is good too.  I tried the croissant french toast.  It satisfied my indulgent breakfast food craving.\n\nStaff is friendly, efficient, and easy on the eyes.  ;)  The atmosphere is classy, fun, and colorful, with plenty of quirky things on the wall to look at.

We got in around 12 30 (make a reservation) it's slammed busy all the time. We were seated promptly and given menus. \n\nWhat bugged me is the other waiters and hosts just walk around and look at you like they're gonna help you,  but they dont. Then the waiter comes, takes our order. \n\nWe got food before drinks. The food was delish.\n\nTropical tacos - jicama taco shells, pinko shrimp, aioli, and cilantro. Bomb\n\nBeef tacos - very bold flavor. Delicious tomatillo salsa to go with it.  \n\nThe negative is they don't ask how you are, they just rush you,  by clearing plates, even if you're not done. They don't ask to take it,  they just take it.  Very cocky if you ask me. \n\nBut yeah, good food, loud place, crappy service.

She urged us to get here early as it gets crowded quickly. Though we strived to get there at its opening, we failed by arriving an hour after the dinner opening, and boy were we SORRY! The hostess informed us that the next available seating from the  current 6pm time would be 9:30pm. Though the bar is open seating, we were left to fend for ourselves as it was first come first serve. No clipboard list is available to reserve for the bar. \n\nWe decided to stick around and yelp our way to other nearby restaurants. We even contemplated on their sister location. Within maybe 10-15 minutes, the hostess noticed an opening and told us to hurry up and swoop on it before the table was even cleared. And just like that, we flocked our tailfeathers to the bar! Major kudos to the hostess and sorry I didn't catch her name to give her a more personal THANK YOU. I loved that she helped us and appreciated their customer service that much more. \n\nWe finally sat down and order the Tropical Tacos, Crab Croquettes, Arugala Salad, Beef Tacos, and drinks. Each order was roughly about $10 each, so be prepared to spend some $$$. \n\nMy favorite was the Tropical Tacos consisting of battered shrimp with toppings served on jicama. It was so flavorful and refreshing at the same time. I also loved the crab croquettes.

I heard a lot of good things about Lolo so we made the trip out to SF.\n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nLolo is a cool looking restaurant. It is intentionally tacky yet artistically hip and comforting. The restaurant is a good size. Lolo has a nice sized bar. I like the odd decor spread throughout the restaurant. We sat in a section that had men's blazers stitched to the back of the booth. There was a section on the wall that had small dog statues, paper boats, car doors, and the light fixtures had bicycle handlebars attached to them. You'll also see a ton of soccer balls hung up on the walls inside of the bathroom along with cleats hanging from a string.  \n\nFood: \n\nWe started out with the GUACAMOLE (with cotija cheese and fresh tortilla chips) along with fresh salsa. The GUACAMOLE was good. It was different compared to your typical guacamole served in a Mexican Restaurant. It had a unique taste. I also liked the salsa they put on top of the GUACAMOLE. The tortilla chips were one of the best I've ever tasted! They tasted fresh and were very warm. The red mild salsa was my favorite! It tasted really good. Next up was the CHICKEN CONFIT 'TINGA' TOSTADAS (bacon, chipotle peppers, roasted tomatoes) and the GRILLED GRASS FED ANGUS (Beef tacos, onions hand-made flour tortillas, avocado, habanero sauce.) The CHICKEN CONFIT 'TINGA' TOSTADAS were packed with flavor! The tostada had the perfect crisp texture. The chicken had a lot of flavor and tasted good. The bacon, chipotle peppers and the roasted tomatoes added a little kick to the tostadas but in a good way. The GRILLED GRASS FED ANGUS tacos were good. The steak was cooked perfectly and the tortillas tasted really fresh. I liked the flavor of the tacos. It was a simple taco but they tasted delicious! We ended with the CARNITAS (with organic corn tortillas, roasted tomatillo sauce, guacamole, pickled onions.) The CARNITAS were one of the best I've ever tasted! They weren't greasy at all. They were cooked perfectly! The flavor of the pork was great and the texture was spot on.  I liked the presentation of the CARNITAS. The tortillas were served on top inside of a tortilla warmer that looked like what an Asian restaurant would serve dumplings in. The CARNITAS were underneath wrapped inside banana leafs. The tortillas served with the CARNITAS were the best tortillas I've ever eaten in my life! They were absolutely delicious! The tortillas tasted like a mixture of corn and flour. They were sensational! \n\nService:\n\nOur waiter Sebastian was very nice and personable. He made sure our waters were always topped off and asked us if the food was to our liking. He had a positive attitude and was very sociable. \n\nOverall:\n\nMy girlfriend and I loved Lolo! The food was fantastic and the service was really good!

Bonus points for being open way later than most other restaurants (1am on Fridays and Saturdays)!  \n\nWe had a 9:15pm reservation on a Saturday evening but were half an hour late (I tried calling multiple times but no one ever picked up).  The hostess gave us somewhat of a hard time when we got there but we were seated immediately because the place had cleared out given the hour.  \n\nAfter ordering a bottle of wine we had the following:\n\nTuna tacon (seared albacore tuna shellfish aioli, avocado, roasted tomatillo sauce on the side).  Despite all of the positive reviews, I was still doubtful as to how good this dish would be.  It was GOOD.  Definitely order this, it was my favorite of the evening. \n\nLamb sliders on a brioche bun and porcini mushroom sauce and shoestring french fries.  This dish was solid.  The mushroom sauce gave it a nice flavor (but also made the brioche buns extremely soggy and somewhat unappetizing).  \n\nGorditas (mezcal bbq beef pulled short rib).   A decent dish that came with lots of meat.  Fine, but not amazing.  We settled on this after attempting to order the carnitas and later finding out they were sold out. \n\nMexican corn on the cob with cream sauce and oaxaca cheese.  This was kind of bland despite all of the cream and cheese sauce on it.  I ended up dousing the corn in hot sauce to give it some kick.  I've definitely had better mexican street corn. \n\nWe also ordered the guacamole but thankfully they forgot to bring it out because this was more than enough food for two people.  \n\nOverall, the food is solid; service could be better but seems on par with the general vibe of the restaurant, aka super laid back. The menu has lots of interesting dishes on it and I would gladly go back to try more of them.  It also seems to change quite frequently (many of the dishes shown on yelp were not on the current menu).", "author": "Andrea L."}

We came pretty early, a little after they opened for dinner and the two of us were seated immediately at the bar, which we didn't mind. We ordered the Tropical Tacos, Crab Croquettes, and Panko Avocado Tacos. The crab croquettes came out first, which reminded me of a crab version of Japanese Takoyaki. It was very rich, creamy, and the sauce went well with it. Next up, the Panko Avo Tacos, which consisted of deep fried panko avocado, oaxacan cheese, and a creamy sauce on a flour tortillla. It was pretty good, but a little too rich for me since everything was so creamy. I started to get a little sick of it towards the last few bites. & I guess they saved the best for last- Tropical Tacos. Panko crusted shrimp topped with a sweet pineapple salsa. Sounds simple, but this dish was PERFECTION. The scrimp was succulent, seasoned and cooked just right. The salsa complimented it perfectly. I also liked that it was light since it wasn't on a flour tortilla. We didn't plan on getting drinks, but after seeing how pretty the drinks being made in front of us were, we both went with a margarita. Unlike your basic margarita, the rim had a chile lime kick to it. Yum. Basically loved everything about this restaurant. Prices were decent- about $50 for the both of us- 3 tapas & 2 dranks.

The fried brussel sprouts were pretty good. If I hadn't had delicious brussel sprout chips somewhere else before, I would have said this is my favorite! But, it was still really good. It looks burnt, but you don't taste that burnt taste you would expect from eating something black. We shared the ceviche, but it wasn't the one on the menu. Well we tried, but then the waiter recommended us try the ceviche that was the special of the night which included jalepenos and fried pork skin. I did not regret getting it since it was pretty good. It could have used more acid, but thats because I like ceviche when you can really taste the lemon or lime (I don't know which they put!). If you're a pansy like me, don't try to be cool and eating the peppers with it... my mouth was on fire for a good 5 minutes. Got the tuna tacon and I was really expecting a lot from it considering all the reviews I see talking about it. It wasn't anything special to me... I really liked the sauce but that was about it. It just reminded me of regular ahi tuna that I can get at other places. The lamb sliders was my all time favorite dish of the night. The lamb was moist and it didn't taste gamey at all either. Plus, the fried chips that you can put inside of it made it that much better. Also... even though we finished the sliders, the waiter waited to take away the dish until I was done with the potato chips. DON'T JUDGE ME FOR BEING A CHEAP ASIAN! Of course, if he did take it away, I wouldn't have said anything, I would have just cried deep down inside... but he didn't, even though he cleared away the other empty dishes, so bonus points for him! The taco tropical, they forgot to bring it to us and we had to ask for it... but it came out 30 seconds right after we asked for it. This is probably a close second with the ceviche. I really liked the flavor of mango in the sauce... and the fried seafood thing (mixed with shrimp, fish, and some other stuff) was good too. Wasn't over fried, perfect! I got the sangria as well and it was quite a surprise. If you're expecting something sweet... DON'T. It definitely takes getting used to, but by the end of the meal, I actually liked it.\n\nOverall, the meal was really good. Portions are kind of small, but that's the point of tapas so you can order a bunch of other things. Service is friendly. Place is clean. Will definitely recommend and come back in the future!", "author": "Johnson S."}

First of all, the decor here is really cute, a combination of trendy, Latin, and borderline hipster. Next, the food was delicious. I split the ceviche, tuna taco, chicken tinga tostadas, and eggs benedicte. We could have done with just 3 of the dishes for 2 people, but really wanted to try a variety. My favorite was the tuna taco, with the ceviche a close second (nice portion too!). Everything just tasted so fresh and flavorful! And I loved that the brunch was Mexican.

Service and food were ok (had to have our waitress redo an order since it was lost or someone else took it by accident). Nevermore, everything was fine, but then a cook came out from the kitchen and asked us to move our table just a little to the left. Reason being was that he needed to have someone take out the trash and our table was in the way. We move our table a little and a large (and quite dirty) recology garbage bin comes strolling next to us and gently grazes our table. The person who took it out apologized to us and went on their way. \n\nNot sure if it's policy to take out garbage next to customer tables while they are eating, but Lolo's should consider not doing it at all.\n\nAfter owner contact (changed from 1 star to 2):\nLooks like my situation was not part of their regular process and more of a one-off.

I went to the last location several times and loved the food, had great service and all around great experience. Not this time!\n\nI have walked by Lolo Mon-Fri, between 5:30 and 6:30 since the new location opened, and saw many tables open. I figured 6pm on a Thursday night would be perfect to get in before a rush. For a party of 3 we were told there were no tables available all night... in an empty restaurant. The hostess was snappy and RUDE. I asked about the empty tables, wondering if it were possible to seat us before the reservation times (because clearly all ~20 tables were not booked for the exact same arrival time) and she told us \"no, there's nothing available.\" We asked about the bar - she didn't offer this as even an option - and she snapped back that it was open seating. NOTE: We arrived at 6pm - by 7:30pm half of the \"reserved\" tables WERE STILL NOT SEATED. All of these tables could have turned over at least once, maybe twice, instead of sitting empty for an hour and a half.\n\nWe took a seat the bar, the bartenders seemed disinterested and were only speaking to each other. When we finally received attention, the bartender was nice enough although not service I was expecting. The food was 'meh' - all things I could make in my own kitchen, nothing spectacular. Maybe with better customer service I would have been more enthused. Neither I nor my two dinner guests will be returning to Lolo and won't recommend to anyone we know.", "author": "Chanda G."}

Unfortunately, I went to their new location last Saturday night and had one of the worst restaurant experiences of my life. We called in at 6pm for a table of four, were told we'd be seated by 7:30, arrived at 7:15, and proceeded to wait three hours for a table. The hostess was extremely disorganized, seemed to lose track of tables, and repeatedly told us we'd be seated next only to seemingly seat whoever was standing in front of her at the time. We were finally able to get a table only when we tracked down the owner and told her we'd be leaving immediately if we weren't seated next. \n\nWhile we waited we tried a few different drinks off their cocktail list- all tasted watered down. Given my prior experiences with the restaurant, when we sat down I still hoped that the food would make it worth it.

There were only two tables occupied in the entire restaurant.  We chose to go elsewhere and when we walked by an hour later there were still plenty of tables.  I understand the challenge with balancing reservations and walk-ins but, seriously, to be told you can only sit at a table if you can inhale your food in 20 minutes and then to later see they weren't as busy as expected anyway was very disheartening.

But hey, water glasses were filled and food came out quickly so why am I complaining? We ordered the guacamole, tacos tropical, salmon ceviche, and beef tacos. The guac was okay--I liked the sizable chunks of avocado in it but not enough flavor for my taste. The tacos tropical were tasty, would recommend those. The ceviche was suggested by the waiter, but turned out to be just not my thing--a bit too fishy. The beef tacos were a solid \"meh,\" good seasoning but the beef was a little tough and the sauce too acidic. \n\nI really wanted to like this place.

The menu is a welcome, creative detour from the standard taqueria-style fare that epitomizes most Mexican-themed restaurants in S.F.    The service, while friendly, feels harried and uneven at times, though we were mostly grateful for the slow pace so we could savor the food and conversation.  \n\nOur first bites were of the Brussels sprouts, pan-fried crisp with caramelized shallots and a good quantity of whole hazelnuts.  The sprouts were finished with a tangy vinaigrette that really brought out the flavor, and the dish was our unconditional favorite of the evening.  Next up was the shredded kale salad, a nice rendition with cheese and apples and a pleasant dressing.  One of my companions, never a fan of either sprouts or kale, was ready to permanently modify his diet after these two dishes were in the books.\n\nThe meatballs were a hit, and came in a shallow skillet with a decadent and ample sauce of pureed eggplant (mostly) with a little bit of cream.  The wait staff insisted that everyone thinks the sauce is mostly cheese, and delighted in preempting any confusion we might have had on the issue.  I enjoyed dipping the grilled bread into the sauce to ensure none went to waste.  \n\nThe special of the night was a tasty braised, cubed pork belly which was more tender and less fatty than most of its counterparts, and was served atop a chewy hot arepa (or something closely approximating one).   The only real disappointment I had came in the form of the taco tropical, which featured a few reasonably decent fried shrimp with a spicy aioli that dominated the overall taste, a fact I noticed when I had trouble discerning the tropical relish advertised on the menu.  I was discouraged, too, by the choice of a thin disk of jicama instead of a corn tortilla as the conveyance mechanism for the taco - I respect the uniqueness of the decision, but it didn't really work.\n\nLolo is a very fun place to eat and to look around, both at the people and the avant-garde decor.

It's even better if you have a big group because you get to try even MORE things! So needless to say, when I came here with a group of 7 people, I definitely enjoyed Lolo & trying a lot of their dishes. \n\nWe had a table in the room that had a bar. There's two doorways but you enter through the one that has 3234 on top of it even though the address on Yelp says 3230. The decor is very cute. Why? (You might ask.) Well, it's because of all the colors and different things on the walls. The lamps over the bar in particular look like they are handmade. There are also lots of different mirrors around too. To describe the decorations in one word... I'd probably say vibrant. \n\nAs for the food, I think I liked all the different tacos the best. They were reallllllly good. The tortillas were very thin but still able to hold up when you lifted the taco from the dish to eat them. (I don't have the exact names of these dishes but they're close enough...)\n-- TACO TROPICAL has fried shrimp and some sauce on top. Hands down... This was my favorite of the night. We had to order another order after all the food came out because we liked it that much!\n-- TUNA TACON has avocado and a special sauce that comes in a spoon for you to sprinkle over them. \n-- BEEF TACOS come with 3 tacos. Theres a sauce for you to drizzle on top but try it first before you pour too much on because it is spicy! \n-- PORK SHOULDER TACOS have a thicker tortilla and its meat is very tender. Yum. I loved this one too. \n\nWe also got a few other things:\n-- DUNGEONESS CRAB CROQUETAS are fried balls of crab and potato. I liked these a lot. I usually like croquetas though! \n-- CEVICHE comes with chips that taste like sun chips and some avocado. They're good with the ceviche on top. \n-- BRUSSELSPROUTS taste like seaweed according to my friends but I'm not a big fan of brusselsprouts in general so I won't comment on them really. They're cool. \n-- OCTOPUS comes on a flat rectangular dish. If you looked at it, you wouldn't know it's octopus because it's sliced so thinly and placed on the plate with a lot of seasoning. The taste definitely reminded me of dried squids but it was good. \n-- SALMON WITH PISTACHIOS were cool but they weren't my favorite dish. I wouldn't say it's a must try but if you like fried salmon, that's basically what it is. There's some green pistachio sauce on the plate to dip it in too. (I don't believe I saw it on the menu either so you just ask for it.)\n-- LAMB SLIDERS come with two on each plate along with some fries. The lamb does have somewhat of a gamey taste so if you don't usually like lamb, don't order it. I'm ok with it and liked it but one is definitely enough for me. The fries aren't your usual fries. They are crunchy like chips because they're so thin and small. Definitely liked those! \n\nI also tried the black mojito. It's different from a normal mojito because it has spiced rum and vanilla. I liked it.\n\nService is also pretty good. The food comes out one after another and the waiters clear the plates pretty quickly after you finish a dish. It's nice that we had time to finish some dishes before the next ones came out because the food was never cold from just sitting at our table. \n\nTo get seven of us full (we doubled up on some of the above dishes), our bill was about $278. That includes one drink per person as well as a 20% gratuity because of our party size.", "author": "Connie Y."}

We asked if she could seat us at a table (apparently they were for reservations only), but without hesitation she sat us!  Awesome service already.\n\nWe had a couple of dishes, all of which were very good: \nTuna Tacon ($10) seared albacore tuna, shellfish aioli, avocado, roasted tomatillo sauce on the side. Oxtail Empanadas ($8) oxtail, tomatoe, red cabbage and chipotle sauce. Lamb Sliders ($10) lamb sliders on a brioche bun and porcini mushroom sauce.

We we completely ignored while sitting in front of three bar service people. UNREAL!

Birthday Dinner\n\nOn my birthday I returned to the one restaurant whose flavors have made a deep impression in my taste buds. Lolo is a tapas restaurant with funky decor. You're greeted by warm colors and funky psyche. Ship origami fills one wall, kids tux and dresses another. Pom poms dangle off lamp shades over the bar. It's fun, warm, and welcoming.\n\nThe three of us were seated at a table for four, very roomy and comfortable for this tight, claustrophobic space. We have plenty of room for our water bottle and wines. One of the waitresses didn't speak very good English, and she didn't know the wine I was getting. But she quickly salvaged the situation by confirming with another server.\n\nI was surprised the entire menu stayed the same, so most of the items are familiar. About half of the menu is gluten-free, which scores extra point with me. Over wine and cocktail, we wait for a friend to arrive. \n\n*Guacamole ($6.50): with cotija cheese and served with blue corn chips. Chips are the kind that are thick but crispy. Guac is okay, nothing special. I personally would prefer it without the cheese.\n*Fried Brussels Sprouts ($6): pan fried with shallots and hazelnut. Very strong flavor from Zinfandel vinaigrette. Tasty and different!\n*Taco Tropical ($9): Panko and spice-dusted fried shrimps topped with tropical relish, served on very thin, almost invisible jicama wrap. It's savory, tart, and crispy.\n*Chicken Confit \"Tinga\": shredded chicken with bacon served on hard blue corn taco. This is by far my favorite. Chicken is marinated but the flavor not too overpowering.\n*Squid in Black Ink Croquetas ($9): the reason I come here is for this item. So yummy it's like eating fried potato cage but with pur\u00e9ed squid filling.\n*Grilled Grass-fed Beef Tacos ($14):  grilled angus beef tacos with avocado and a habanero radishes. Beef is very tender and flavored. I could have eaten 5 of these!\n*Crab Tostada ($15): perfectly done, with crab in every bite, and chorizo and leeks.\n\nThe whole meal was fulfilling. Lolo Durante disappoint with their rich array of flavors. A bit on the downside is the small size of the restaurant and so the noise can be pronounced. Service is very friendly and they clear empty plates promptly. It's certainly a gem in the Mission and the hip Valencia, where greater focus is put on style than on substance.", "author": "Matt Y."}

On a Saturday night, a friend Jenn. W. I had not seen for years, and I ventured upon this restaurant for drinks and tapas. Packed, we sat outside accompanied by the overhead heaters that so conveniently was not working as we attempted to collect heat from our neighbors. In spite of the cold but due to the hidden away feel, we forgot about the cold but also that we were in SF because of the tucked away feel from the wildness of the SF night. \n\nWe ordered the shrimp ceviche (amazingly fresh), the pork shoulder (not memorable or forgettable), the palance (forgettable), and another dish we cannot remember. This all did not matter because the best part of the entire meal were the cocktails. My date and I ordered the Player (rye whiskey with an exotic and delicious yet manly flavor), the Windsheild (also rye whiskey but on the boring side), while she ordered the Drake pronounced Drak-aye! Together we entertained the different pronunciations in hopes that our educated backgrounds gave us a leg up - we weren't close. -_-' \n\nFreezing nearly to death, the waitress transferred our bill to the bar located in the adjacent and yet further tucked away room. Swarming with beautiful colors, architecture, singing bird sounds in the bathroom, and large windows to observe 22nd, it feels as if we have front row voyeuristic seats to the Make Out Room and the sketchy activity. No we did not see people making out, but we did see some crazy police activity where a man was searched for drugs. Was this a dream, a movie, or perhaps the ambiance of the restaurant that made this a beautiful experience? Or was it the alcohol? Either way, it was unforgettable.

I have no idea really what they were or how to make them, but the crab was not overwhelming and was just the right amount.\n\n5/10 -- carnitas.

That's like asking someone for a good Chinese restaurant in Chinatown, or a decent Italian joint in North Beach. There are so many options, that my mind went blank (sort of like Foodie stage fright).\n\nIn any case, I happened to stumble upon Lolo this Saturday at my sister's birthday party. Located on 22nd Street (between Mission & Valencia), this place is a delicious fiesta. Don't expect fancy; just expect fun! Be sure to make reservations, because this place is hoppin'. Otherwise, be prepared for a long wait outside. \n\nI was thoroughly impressed with their cocktail program. I had one of the best margaritas in my life. It was called the Domesticated Wolf (tequila, pineapple juice, agave, and a spicy rim). I could've had 10 of those bad boys, but I was driving. I also had a sip of their house margarita, and that was also tasty.\n\nOur dinner party pretty much sampled/shared most of the kitchen's menu items. We started off with the spicy Guacamole and chips. I know - not the most creative starter in the world. And I must confess - I'm not the biggest guac fan. But this creamy goodness was unreal. I think I ate the whole bowl by myself. Other de-lish dishes included: the Fried Brussel Sprouts (with shallots, hazelnuts, zinfandel vinaigrette); the Taco Tropical (panko and spice-dusted shrimp, topped with a tropical relish and spicy aioli); the Poc-Chuc (achiote marinated grilled pork tenderloin, roasted habanero sauce, grilled onions); the Lamb Sliders; and the Mezcal BBQ Gorditas (blue corn masa pockets filled with mezcal BBQ angus pulled short rib, guacamole and cabbage slaw on the side). Every dish was tastier than the next. It's been a while since my taste buds were treated to so many different flavors in one meal.\n\nWe definitely did not walk out of there hungry. The service is great. All the servers were friendly and helpful with menu suggestions even though the place was super slammed. \nThis place totally rocks, and I can't wait to go back.

The asparagus were so fibrous, even our forks can't pierce thru them. \n5) BERRY TRIFLES, highlight of our night, but how can you go wrong with mascarpone cream & berries?\n\nWe spent $100 including tips for 2; this is definitely one of those overhyped places that I won't be rushing back to...ever.", "author": "May L."}

I mean, seriously every few months one must get one's hand dirty, by listening to one's single friends' discussing their latest romance intrigues when I have none of my own to share. I am a good listener and advice giver, especially if you get me going with a glass of French or Spanish red. Such was this night. Food, completely delicious. Lamb sliders was the bomb. N's dating life, not so much. But he was a perfect story teller with the perfect, albeit, bad dating stories to make me laugh. I offer unwanted, and unwarranted advice over fried brussel srouts. We tried to eat healthy but alas healthy food is very difficult when it is counter balanced by deliciousness. I wrote once to someone very dear to me to come here but he cancelled on me. In fact I think he said something like \"that's great\" and never followed up. I think he's missing it. Just like how he missed going to Mission Chinese with me. I'm not making any more mistakes of inviting people to go to great restaurants when they do not follow up. I will go with others who are willing and can dish good stories to accompany good dishes. We enjoyed the tacos and polished a couple of drinks. Then in the end lamb sliders, while I only had a bite and N ate the rest, was pure heavenly. I made a mental note, that girl he's seeing, is not going to last. Well, I was right. a week later, at 2 AM, a text arrived from N, it was to inform me, that the date was a disaster, and it was the end. Well, the good news is that for the time being, I'll have my dinner companion back, the bad news is I'll have to listen to more horrible dating stories while trying to enjoy my meal. Note to Yelp readers, anyone interested in a 6'2, handsome east coast Ivy League PhD working in nano science living in Noe? Can you please take him off my hand so that I can hear a good dating story over a good dinner instead of a lousy one?  Thank you Lolo, you've been very entertaining. Will be back, with or without N's stories.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Lol\u00f3 is located in the Mission district and is really different from anything else in the area that I have come across. We failed to make a reservation so we knew the wait was going to be long, so we headed to a bar to wait. Once we were finally seated the waiter gets us drinks fast and rattles off the specials. Lol\u00f3 is tapas (small plates) that you share with you group. We were a party of five and in total ordered around 8-10 dishes and we were STUFFED! Here are the most memorable:\n\nElot\u00e9s: corn on the cob with crema. Reminds me of an upscale faire favorite. \nEmpanadas: perfect blend of cheeses and mushroom with a crunchy shell\nAngus beef  tacos: chunks of seasoned tender beef. Jicama taco shell- get out of town! The sauce on the side was equally as good, I wanted to drink the stuff!\nCarnitas: served in a banana leaf, sides of salsa and guacamole served with blue corn tortillas. Delish. \nCeviche: shrimp and fish, huge chunks with the perfect salt/tart balance. \n\nWe ordered two dishes that did not come out which was unfortunate and we didn't check the bill until after we left.

Decor themes intentionally clashed but contributed to a different ambiance from every side of the table. Quirky. The meal was similar with clashing, loud flavors that didn't compliment the food as much as it did the walls. We ordered the romaine salad first. It was drowning in an overly sweet dressing so the pepitas, avocado, and jicama that drew us to the item where overpowered. The tropical tacos were similar with a sweet sauce overwhelming the friend shrimp. The grilled octopus was very good - grilled well on the outside and still moist, not chewy inside. The tiramisu was the best of all and so unique! I really liked the cocktails too.\nOverall, I'm glad we went but given how hard it is to get a reservation, I probably won't go back.", "author": "becca S."}

Tables for two and tables for large groups all work well together in one large room with tall ceilings and lots of stuff on the walls from car doors to origami boats. Car mirror chandelier overhead led me to a bad joke about how many times i'd see myself right after a big earthquake but it was fun to look up at.\n\nAmbience is colorful, loud and friendly. Made reservations for two on a Saturday evening and we got the call that our table was ready as we walked in. $70 for two including tax and tip  to share six tapas plus one glass of wine. We were full and satisfied so skipped dessert which had ice cream kinds of choices plus lots of agave drinks and agave flights.\n\nThe tapas - small plates: \n\nRegular one page menu plus three specials offered. Really nice variety of tastes and textures. \n\nBeets arrived first and were actually a little filling for a starter but very appealing presentation and tasty. \n\nBrussels Sprouts sauteed nicely in a generous portion. Like the Beets a little filling for an early dish but we let the Beets stay with us as a side dish. (I'm getting a little weary of fried Brussels Sprouts which have suddenly turned up everywhere in recent months or years, even in sushi places. You might want to try other things on the menu but only because they have several other good things to try.)\n\nTaco Tropical with panko and shrimp was great. \n\nTuna Tacon was lighter with a sauce that tasted fruit based served in spoons on the side and the wrappers made of jicama were just a little crunchy surrounding the soft textured albacore and avocado. The look and feel of this dish was spare and elegant and very pretty and sticks with me perhaps a little more than all the rest though loved them all.\n\nCrab Coquetas were lightly crusty outside creamy tasty inside as one might expect and yes could taste the crab. \n\nHuitlacoche Ravioli was classy and subtle in a nice sauce topped with pine nuts and worked well as the final dish. Large flat soft wonton-ravioli. Similar to the part pot sticker squash ravioli which i order often at Samovar but softer and in a little bit larger bowl and the sauce was generously served.  \n\nAttentive service from several staff with a steady flow of fresh plates, forks and knives and water. \n\nLocated on the west side of Valencia Street between 21st and Liberty i.e. just north and west of Valencia and 21st.

Lolo is one of the first places that has succeeded in changing my opinion that a good Mexican place must be a hole in the wall.

Starting off with the chips and homemade salsa, you knew you were in for a treat. The guac was good. Citrusy. The cheese fondue was... well, cheesy. Then came some tapas. The seared tuna tacos were amazing. But what really separates Lolo from anything I've had at a Mexican place before was the Meatballs.

I went back to my friend's house and proceeded to eat everything in his fridge because my stomach was still digesting itself.\n\nThe goodside: Cheap.

My favorite restaurant in the city.. my favorite food in the world... it changed when they moved locations. The quaintness and soul of the little restaurant on 22nd St has been replaced with just another Valencia St. restaurant. \n\nThe biggest problem - The TUNA TACON!!! (read my first review) We ordered it at the new place and it has completely changed. They no longer put a shellfish aioli sauce on it and the tuna piece-to-tortilla ratio is off. It was still \"good\" but no where near the \"dynamite flavor\" I got from the original. I really can't believe how sad I am about a dish changing, but it really was the \"best thing I ever ate\" at the old place. \n\nThey also no longer offer the delicious bread as an appetizer when you first walk in.\n\nIn other news, Juan Carlos was still just as charming and friendly as always. He let us know that the other Lolo is still open because they couldn't get out of the lease. We're going to try that place again to see if they still hang on to the old ways.\n\nWe miss the charm, flavor and love that we felt in the old place.

I can't speak for vegan, as my friend and I wound up ordering their cheesy-licious fondue. I was a little hesitant at first, and tried to guide our selection in the way of something more tapas-focused, given the nature of the venue. But our fondue arrived, and it was absolutely scrumptious! The cocktails were somethin' else, too. I'm no mescal expert, but being a frequent visitor of a Comal, which also features this liquor specialty, I feel I've gained some experience. The drinks weren't as fancily \"dressed\" as those at Comal, but they were just as tasty, and at a friendlier price point. At the end of our sit-down, the check came in a tiny boot. You can't imagine our glee when they set down the miniature footwear before us!\n\nAtmosphere was pretty great, too. Loved the touch in all the decorations. It's important to note we sat at the bar. The establishment is set into three zones. There is one larger dining area, then a a hallway that connects to a separate area that is split in two -- part bar, part wall seating. I felt the wait was a bit lengthy and that we could've received better guidance on how long we could expect to sit outside from our hostess (thus not a full five stars). However, service once seated was great--bartender was very friendly and offered enough advice on the menu without being \"sales-y\" -- for instance, he warned us that the fondue would likely take some time, and offered to bring us a plate to get a started before its arrival, but didn't push us once we let him know we were willing to wait. \n\nLast note: this was a great spot to catch up with an old friend. Intimate enough to have a conversation without being so full of dead air that we felt a need to fill comfortable silences. Will definitely be back!", "author": "Lexi H."}

Culinary mashups are like musical mashups.  They either:  a)  Incorporate good parts of the originals seamlessly to create a mind-blowing new entity OR b) Disjointedly mishmash random parts that strike a dissonant chord on your senses.  Happily, Lolo is in the former category.\n\n2)  TO WINE YOU AND DINE YOU\n\nThe tomato goat cheese spread that came with the bread was delish.  The flavors of the Panko Encrusted, Spice Dusted, Flash-Fried Shrimp (with tropical relish & chipotle aioli) put me in my happy place.  The freshness of the relish ingredients was well, relished.  The Huitlacoche and Ricotta Stuffed Dumplings (with roasted pepper, tomatoes, squash blossom sauce) were good and nicely plated.\n\nMy friend thoroughly enjoyed his Three Meat Bites (Lamb, Beef, and Bacon mixed up with herbs & a rich porcini cream sauce) as much as I enjoyed my Duck Tacos (with cilantro and this great grapefruit, basil and jalapeno sauce).  Let's just say, there wasn't much sharing during this part of the meal.\n\nOne of the most innovative desserts I've ever had was Lolo's Mascarpone Cheese flavored with Mint and layered with Quince.  It came with a Lavender Citrus sauce and the unique mix of flavors was unexpectedly perfect.  We also tried the Tiramisu with Chocolate Covered Espresso Beans, a more pedestrian dessert that we could've done without. \n\n3)  TO RECYCLE\n\nDecor-wise, Lolo puts the \"fun\" in funky.  There were newspapers, salt bags, Mexican wrestler masks, cowboy boots, brightly colored mirrors and more.  It was eclectic but somehow it worked and we were feeling it.  The bathroom decor was especially fun.\n\n4)  TO HAVE FUN!\n\nAnd speaking of fun, Juan Carlos was the bartender who hooked us up with great recommendations and good service.  He embodied Lolo's vibe - friendly, warm, casual and made sure that we had a good time.\n\n\"Whatever LOLO wants\nLOLO gets\nTake off your coat\nDon't you know you will win\nYou're no exception to the rule\nIt's irresistible you fool .. GIVE IN.\"\n\nYou'll be glad you did.", "author": "Amy C."}

Everything we ordered was really unique and delicious. We wanted to do a family style thing and share, but it's a little hard as the tapas sized items were hard to split among 6 people...we still made it work though. The place was pretty packed so we ended up sitting outside, the servers tried to keep us warm by cranking up the heaters and with sangria (which was so good). \n\nHighlights:\nHalibut tacos: the fish was crispy and so flavorful. I really enjoyed that the \"taco shell\" was actually jicama...the sweetness was a great balance. \nPistachio encrusted salmon: the sauce was really yummy. \nTuna tacon: So good, this was my fave of the night. The sauce that it came with on the side was such a great compliment. And the tuna was seared perfectly.\nSeafood Posole: special of the night...the warm seafood broth was amazing.

Lolo works well as a wine bar, but its attempts at fusion fall short of four stars. The wine list favored South American and Spanish wines, which is just right for me. You can taste the sun in those wines. \n\nThe ceviche mirasol and taco tropical were both too bland for my taste, despite the presence of peppers and spices! Octopus tiradito was more flavored than the other dishes, but La Mar's octopus is far more interesting and delicious. \n\nDecor is very welcoming; imagine that you're entering a Oaxacan abuela's home with a lot of bright, vivid colors and interesting art on the walls, and maybe some tchotchkes laying around.\n\nBut lolo, spice up the food a bit!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-04-05", "description": "Best tapas place I've been to so far. I've been to Lolo about five times now and it never gets old. They make great cocktails here, and I've never had a bad one. My favorite is the Mezcalita, which is their version of a margarita but made with mezcal. They change their menu quite a bit and have some great specials. The decor is kitschy but not cheesy; I like the baby boots they use as books for checks and the lotto numbers they integrated into the bar.\n\nSome faves:\n\nTuna tacon - Seared albacore tuna, shellfish aioli, avocado, roasted tomatillo sauce on the side. Hands down my favorite plate here. The tuna is seared perfectly and melts in your mouth. The aioli doesn't saturate the bite and goes amazingly with the tomatillo sauce. Savory, mouth watering, melting bite.\n\nShishito peppers - Nothing crazy here, but a great way to start the meal. Peppers sauteed and drizzled with just enough flavor to complement the natural taste of the peppers.\n\nCarnitas - Moist, sizzling carnitas wrapped in a leaf and served in a dim sum basket. Comes with blue corn tortillas, pickled onions, tomatillo sauce. Straight forward dish but oozing with flavor. \n\nCrab tostadas - Chorizo, leeks, dungeness crab, sandia aioli, avocado puree. Never had a chorizo/crab combo until I had this, and it's fantastic. The oiliness of the chorizo enriches the taste of the crab and the two proteins mesh really well. Perfect balance with the crispiness of the tostada. It's like eating one really big and fancy seafood super nacho.\n\nTaco tropical - Panko and spice-dusted shrimp, topped with a tropical relish and spicy aioli. Crispy, savory, refreshing, all in one. The panko factor on the shrimp is just right and the light mango-y notes from the fruit relish really balances it.\n\nMecalita - Like I mentioned before, my favorite cocktail here. If you want a manlier, smokier margarita, this is what you need.", "author": "Edmund C."}

After telling her a few times that I wanted to know if we could sit outside and what the seating was like (e.g., back patio, front sidewalk), she simply repeated \"do you want a reservation? how many people? what time?\" without answering my question then she said \"whatever\". I hung up on her.\n\nMy friends and I assumed she must have language difficulties. Only that could explain her rudeness on the phone so we phoned back, made a reservation then walked the few blocks to Lolo to see what the situation was.

The braised short rib gorditas, i am SO glad i got these. highlight of the meal bc they were just so soft, juicy, and goes so well with the spices. I also tried the kobe beef tacos --grilled to perfection and delightful. also had the chips and cheese/salsa combo, very good and gooey, and has a hint of spicyness. also tried the flan, ahh definitely made my sweet tooth fall in love. \n\nthe ambiance is very nice and comfy, sort of worn in. The decor is very quirky, the mirrors in the back have a bird imprinted on it, very artsy.

I was expecting a long wait since I heard it gets packed on weekends but we walked in around 7 on a Friday and my friend and I were seated right away in the last open table. Score!  First off-- sensory overload in the best way possible. Every single crevice of every nook, cranny, and wall is covered in the most creative and colorful decorations. I found myself just staring at the walls for the first ten minutes. Pair that with the most creative and unique menus = I was sold. My friend and I shared a bottle of red wine & shared 4 tapas -- more than enough, we were stuffed! My favorite was the \"taco tropical\" and I almost wish we ordered two servings since they were only 1 a piece. The tortillas were made of jicama! I wasn't crazy about the crab croquettes, they were a little too fried. The carnitas also weren't amazing but I definitely give this place a solid 4 stars for ambiance, service, and overall experience. We left very stuffed and satisfied.

Unfortunately, I was underwhelmed across the board.\n\nFirst off, I love the whimsical nature of the new space (I love me some whimsy) The decor is bright and vibrant and sets the scene for a fun meal. Across the board, everything was fine but nothing excited. Chips were good and they kept refilling the bowl without asking but the guacamole ($7) was under seasoned and bland. Shishito Peppers ($7) were nice but it's really hard to mess that up. The Brussel Sprouts ($6) were cooked well but were drowning in some sort of balsamic marinade that made them way too acidic. Panko Avocado Tacos ($9) were good but $9 for two veggie tacos seemed almost comical. We also ordered a special of Stuffed Squash Blossoms ($9) that were fine but we had no idea they were deep fried until they arrived at our table. If the waiter would have described them as such (or to be fair we could have asked how they were cooked) we probably would have avoided them as we already had so many fried dishes. \n\nDrinks were good but again, $11 for a margarita seemed a bit steep considering it was pretty pedestrian. \n\nMaybe we ordered wrong.

As a fan of nuts (get your minds out the gutter), I was pleased to see multiple varieties in several dishes: pistachio encrusted salmon, pinenuts in the arugula & radicchio salad, fried brussel sprouts w/ hazelnuts & candied almonds in their brioche & ice cream dessert.\n\nLolo is right at home in the Mission; it's artsy & somewhat retro decor & furnishings are fun to gawk at. The wall covered in spoons, rubber gloves coming out of the wall (see pic), mismatched seats & your bill tucked into an old school book about dogs is all part of Lolo's kitschy allure.\n\nFor my party of three, the price of tapas/dessert came out to about $25 per person. Lolo's unique menu, which changes a few times a year, is worth another visit. They keep their online menu updated so you can see what you're getting into before dining here.

It was great that our  favorite server came over to lighten the mood. As usual he was  super sweet, professional and together. It's always great to see him.\n\nDining out is a privilege and I almost never complain because it seems downright arrogant and petty most of the time.

I came here last night with one of my friends, right when we got in we were greeted by this cute waiter, the hostess seated us almost immediately at the bar (we didn't get there until about 10pm, I had called earlier in the day for reservations for 2 at 8pm and they'd told me they were completely booked!). The space itself is pretty small, but very cutely decorated. The bartenders were also very cute haha.\n\nMy friend and I ordered the brussel sprouts, tuna tropical, tuna tacone, the ravioli dish, and the squid ink croquetas. Everything was delicious. We were also starving at the time, but still I think even if we hadn't been starving everything would have tasted very good. Everyone definitely needs to try the tuna tacones!!! If I ever get to go back there, I think that might be all I would order, it was so good. \n\nKind of pricey, but worth every single dollar, in my opinion.

Despite the fact that our waiter was truly hustling he was attentive and friendly.  When I inquired about the heat level in the Mexican Eggs Benedict sauce he kindly brought a sample from the kitchen for me to try.   The sauce was rich and nicely spicey-just the right about of richness and kick.  It was truly a delicious dish.  The red and green sauces served with the complimentary chips were also nicely spiced and delicious.  \n\nThen there was my experience at brunch today.  From the moment we sat down our waitress made us feel unwelcome.  When my friend informed her that she was allergic to beans and could something be substituted for them she asked, \"like what?\" in a very surly and put out tone.  My friend responded that as she did not know what else might be available perhaps she could ask the kitchen.  The waitress returned and said that the beans were just a spread on top of the tortilla.  My friend again told her that she was allergic and could not eat beans.  Again, the waitress asked what she wanted then.  My friend said, \"how about avocado.\"  We then asked if we might have separate checks and she well I'll write them up together and you can divide it up at the end.  We responded by saying very politely that we would appreciate separate checks.  \n\nOur food arrived and we had not been served the chips or salsa so had to ask for them.  The Eggs were a disappointment this time.  The sauce was very bland with no spice what-so-ever and the eggs very overcooked.  I was very disappointed as I had raved about this dish and Lola to my friend.  \n\nHad this been my first experience at Lola I would not return.  However, given my first very satisfying experience I will give it one more try and see how it goes.", "author": "Suki H."}

I found Lolo on Yelp and couldn't be happier that I did. The decor is so cute and random, which I love, and the food is absolutely phenomenal!\nIt is run by a mostly Mexican staff (which my Mexican boyfriend loved) and the food tastes so authentic, every dish bursting with flavor! Every waiter I have had has been beyond helpful, even going through each drink on the menu and explaining the difference in taste, sweetness, etc. \nThe baristas are also incredible! They use all fresh and natural ingredients and you can taste it! I had the best margarita and pisco in my life at that bar. It is fun to watch them shake up the concoctions too, as they do it with so much love and enthusiasm. :)\nI have since taken my friends here and went for my birthday dinner as well. Our waiter from a previous night was not our waiter that night, but came over and greeted us and put stars next to the tapas he thought we should try this time. Talk about customer service! I was beyond impressed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-04-28", "description": "Lol\u00f3 has just moved up in my esteem from one of my favorite restaurants in town to my absolute top favorite.  I have written a lot of good reviews in my 5+ years on yelp, but I do not recall ever feeling so grateful to a restaurant and the people who run it before.  Let me explain.  It is my friend's birthday, and I had pretty much insisted on bringing her here, based on a few times I had loved their food in their old location.  My memory was that every item I had tried before was delicious, the decor was adorable, and their menu was clearly labeled about gluten-free items (all still true).  This is so appreciated when I am always the high-maintenance customer asking about how everything on a menu is prepared; labels generally save me from that.  \n\nFast forward to today.  I told the super sweet gentleman (who is perhaps one of the \"partners\" I was told later when I asked) at the front about the birthday, if he could just let our server know.  My hope was just that my friend might be surprised at the end without my having to obviously sneak over and tell someone before dessert time.  He came over right away when she arrived and wished her a happy birthday so warmly, it set a celebratory tone for the evening immediately.  Our food was nothing short of amazing throughout (and those margaritas!) and when I mentioned to our waiter at the beginning that I was concerned about what else might have shared a fryer with the chips (yes, I'm that person these days), he brought over that first guy who spent time with me, coming up with substitutions that would work on the things we wanted to order.  I mean, they changed the way they make some of the items so I could eat them!  I couldn't believe it.  And everyone acted like it was their absolute pleasure to do so.  They were a smooth and cheerful team.\n\nThe chicken \"tinga\", the pulled short-rib, the roasted beets, the mahi-mahi special, and the cajeta-with-a-candle at the end... it was as perfect as could be.  And even though we lingered as the restaurant was getting busy, we never felt rushed.  What a rare thing, to remember liking a restaurant and finding out that it has not only gotten even better, but also seems more gentle and humble in its success.  Thank you, Lol\u00f3, for making my dear friend's birthday feel so special!", "author": "Samantha G."}

An interesting fusion of flavors for sure, though some dishes tasted like they lacked the Turkish influence.  A better alternative to those skanky taco trucks and taquer\u00edas serving the same tired old fare.  Plus its nice to have decent wine options and a modest ambiance when enjoying Mexican-ish in the Mission.\n\nBread: A freebie, but quite awesome because of the red pepper hummus like dip.  Had a bit of a kick.  Better than some dip appetizers you actually pay for at restaurants.\n\nLamb Slider: The harissa added a nice diversion from the traditional beef slider.  The lamb was overcooked and would have been better medium rare since it tastes more like beef the more well done it is.\n\nTaco Tropical: Apparently a specialty and definitely worth checking out.  Very few places do the fried fish taco and do it well.  This place sets itself apart with using fried shrimp and some tasty fruit relish and cream sauce.  Could totally down a whole platter of these!\n\nHuitlacoche and Ricotta Stuffed Dumplings: So apparently huitlacoche is corn smut.  Not maize porn, but rather some fungus.  Don't think I knowingly had this before but it mixes well with the ricotta as traditional mushrooms would.  The dumplings were deep fried, wish they are the more elegant potsticker style that is partially steamed and partially fried.\n\nBlue Corn Tlacoyos with Bison: Reminded me of a pupusa, but better.  Mushy blue corn mass fried with some filling.  The bison was shockingly tender, like stewed beef.  I'd start eating more bison if it was always this tender.\n\nSultan Likes Lolita: Basically kofta lamb meatballs on a skewer.  Not as spicy and flavorful as something you'd find at a good Middle Eastern joint.  Some interesting sauce to go with it though.\n\nBrioche and Ice Cream: Went for this dessert because it was the only one with dulce de leche.  A little small on the dulce de leche pour though.  Ice cream was standard, I'm probably spoiled by all the specialty places in this city.", "author": "Adam B."}

See below:\n\nService - 4 stars. Very good, hostess was quick to seat us, server was efficient, friendly, suggestive on menu items, and checked in on us a few times during dinner.\n\nFood - 2 stars. Would have been 4 stars if the ceviche wasn't so bad. Of the 3 dishes we tried, 1 was good, 1 was alright, 1 was bad. The tuna tacon was awesome, they're basically seared tuna mini tacos with some other things mixed in. The fried brussel sprouts were fine but uneventful. And the seafood ceviche was so sour that we couldn't taste anything but the extreme sourness. Yes yes yes, I know ceviche in some cases in intended to be sour but in this case it was overboard to the point of almost being unedible.\n\nPrice and Value - 3 stars. The prices are reasonable but the portions are slightly on the small side.

It was an explosion of flavors and textures.\nCrab tostadas-good portion of crab\nCeviche-I've had better on intl, but it was worth ordering here.\n\nOk:\nSalmon \"encrusted\" pistachio\n\nSkip:\nThe Brussels sprouts\nThe octopus-way too heavy on the season ie Lucas chili powder.\n\nWill be back for their meat dishes.

Let me start by saying that Carlos and the server were VERY nice to us. No complaints about service. \n\nMy favorite dishes were the meatballs, which were done almost rare and I enjoyed but other people at my table did not. I thought they were awesome but they were $8 I believe for five small meatballs. Ouch. \n\nThe other dish I enjoyed was the skirt steak and that was $16 for a piece of meat. It was good but in the mission I generally get skirt steak for $10 and it includes rice and a salad so I felt it was a bit steep. \n\nTheir sangria was also good and not terribly expensive. \n\nThe dish I was not a fan of was the pork belly. No and more no. \n\nTheir beer was cheap. Negra Modelo for $3. I'd go back here for drinks and appetizers with friends but the food was too expensive for what I got.", "author": "Carlos A."}

Lolo is a Unique Culinary Experience with exotic creative Turkish Mexican fusion dishes. It's unlike anything I've ever had before. Defiantly one of my favorite places in San Francisco. \n\nMUST TRY: \n\n-Pistachio Encrusted Salmon with Wasabi Cream Sauce \n-Delicate Soft Taco's wrapped in Jicama Shells \n-Octopus Tiradito with Urfa Flakes, Sea Salt and Cascabel Aioli \n-Lamb Skewers served on giant metal Skewers on a bed of Cold Crack Wheat Salad \n\nThe Salmon and the Octopus are truly unique to Lolo and a must try. The Salmon is breaded in pistachio and delicately fried Japanese style, in a miso wasabi sauce and falls apart in your mouth. The Octopus comes out thinly sliced and looks like a plate of black and white graffiti with a spicy aioli sauce that looks like it's \"tagged\" on top of the graffiti. You really can't go wrong here. Everything on the menu is a unique surprise, great presentation, and brilliant quality food. I love this place. \n\nYou have to make a reservation here usually to get a table. It's THAT good. There's a wooden bench outside in case you have to wait, and you walk into the first room with colorful second hand couches, when you walk to the back, it opens up to the room next door, which is where I always ask to sit. \n\nI always reserve seats at the end of the bar in an L, they use it as a community table and you need reservations to sit there. Ask for Carlos and ask for his recommendations on wine and the menu. He really makes this place, Lolo in my opinion. He picks out my wine and tells me what to have on the menu. This man is so cool. You'll want to know him too! \n\nThe bar and walls are covered in laminated newspaper with large over sized black oval mirrors with peacocks frosted and etched into the glass. Simply beautiful. I usually bring my SLR and practice taking pictures of all the elements. If you sit at the bar, notice down at your feet, they took old shoe shine metal fixtures and added them to the bar. When you come to the Mission this is what you deserve.

We had so much good food and wine that I wrote my review in haste.  I will try to remember the evening's event's and help make this a more helpful review:\n\n1) We had made reservations for 4 people but unfortunately only 3 showed up. The check in process was smooth. We spoke with the hostess and she had our table ready in 10 minutes or so. I normally would be a little perturbed but I was totally understanding considering it was prime dinner time and how popular this restaurant is, I wouldn't be surprised if they seated someone before us at an earlier seating time and they went over their allotted time.\n\n2) The wine:  we ordered a bottle of Malbec. Very reasonably price $20-30 range although Malbec can be quite cheap at the grocery stores.  Can't really fault the restaurant, they always have alcohol markup.\n\n3) The food: (a) Brussel sprouts with hazelnuts: yummy. One of the best renditions of brussel sprouts that I've had. The roasted flavor paired with the hazelnuts and a slightly tangy dressing was to die for. (b) oxtail empanadas: who doesn't like empanadas? especially when filled with luscious braised oxtail that was so tender and juicy the the pastry crust flaky and yummy. (c) lamb sliders: also delish. We had a few more dishes but unfortunately I couldn't remember them due being pretty much drunk. \n\nCaveat:  let me preface this review and update with some back story: I was out drinking before dinner. Had a cocktail (or two) at Dalva on 16th and Mission before walking to Lolo's for dinner. Also drank a bottle of wine split between 3 people so forgive me if my taste buds were generous. I still would go back sober and try the food again.\n\nEnjoy fellow yelpers!", "author": "Eric T."}

We decided to start out dinner around 6:30 and had a nice slow meal with a couple glasses of rose.  The food is served tapas style and we ordered about 5 dishes that showed off what we thought was probably the best Lolo had to offer.  The food was DELICIOUS.  If it hadn't been for the end of the night I would gladly go back and try out more recommending it to my foodie friends.  \n\nit's funny how one moment changes a person's opinion about a restaurant.  We were sitting at our little 2-top table finishing up our second glass of wine after our plates had been cleared and bill paid.  I included a 20% gratuity for services decently rendered.  The space was filled with patrons who had been sitting at dinner for as long as we were.  Within 8-10 mins of me paying for the bill we were approached by a host and told... \"Excuse me, but we have other reservations for this table... if you don't mind...\"  I was shocked.  I had just spent close to $100 for this dinner and would've written rave reviews but I have never been asked to leave a restaurant before.  I understand that people are waiting for tables as I have sat there and waited for diners to leave as well but having been a server I would NEVER ask a table to get up and leave.  If he would've given us 5 more minutes I'm sure we would've gotten up on our own accord.\n\nIt's unfortunate that everything else was such a lovely experience.

The menu looked so creative and delicious, Mexican with a strong foodie twist.\n\nLast night, I finally made it! The inside of the restaurant is adorably campy--a charming combination of bright painted walls, plush benches in cute fabrics, mirrors, and collage. There are two dining rooms, one tiny and cramped, almost an extension of the entry way, the other a slightly roomier, with a small sized wooden bar.\n\nWe sat at one of the four outdoor tables, arranged against the outer wall of the restaurant facing 22nd street and a small parking space parklet. Sheltered from the breeze by an awning and canvas flaps to either side, with heaters discretely tucked up above, it was the perfect spot to enjoy the warm weather, without becoming too chilled as the sun went down.\n\nThe restaurant serves small plates served family style, and the waiter recommended about two dishes per person. This actually turned out to be a little to much--I'd probably recommend three dishes for two people.\n\nThe margaritas were wonderful--not too sweet and ever so slightly spicy. The carnitas was excellent--really, really good--and the squash blossom quesadilla was also pretty impressive. We also tried some figs, which came out rather mushy and bland, and a soft shell crab dish from the specials menu, which was ok. \n\nI would definitely go back.", "author": "Lindsay M."}

Their mezcal drinks are well crafted, and they are meticulous about them.\n\nI believe their menu changes regularly. On the latest menu, I enjoyed the crab tostadas (it is dungeness season), and a mussels special with chorizo sauce. The octopus tiradito seemed like it could have been any seafood. The poc-chuc was tastey, but nothing spectacular.\n\nOverall, the decor and friendly staff exemplify the SF Mission experience.

From the brussels sprouts through the tuna tacon, crab tostadas, oxtail empanadas, the gorditas, and the mahi mahi tostada special, each dish was its own bit of spectacular. The wine list also provided interesting choices. Our one regret: we forgot to save room for dessert!\n\nWe sat outside--on an early-January night--under the heaters because we showed up without a reservation, so our ambiance experience was that of sitting on the sidewalk in the Mission (live music from multiple directions, people walking by, others smoking weed...), but none of us minded it since we were all NYC residents at some point in our lives and it felt familiar. Of course, the women at the table might've felt differently since, by the end of the night and our server taking such good care of us, they were half-naked...", "author": "Curtis F."}

Shortly after we got there the tiny dining room (which I assume is for the non-reservation diners) quickly filled up. The staff was super friendly.\n\nWe had the Brussels sprouts, which seem to top many of the reviewers \"Must Try\" and I agree!!! The combination of Brussels sprouts with hazelnuts is delicious! I also enjoyed the beets w/feta mouse and parsley oil. This dish was like a firecracker in your mouth (not spicy) but flavor after flavor! We especially enjoyed the meatballs!

The taco tropical was to die for! that crunch 'tortilla' made of jicama, breaded shrimp and tropical sauce allowed quick access to my own personal nirvana. The thinly sliced peppered octopus was a little intimidating at first, but scrapped and placed upon the french baguette, i realized it was pure delight! \n\nnow, the size - It appears quite small upon entrance, but it lies! there's a backroom with a full bar! Also, make sure you have a chance to visit the bathroom; you'd be cheating yourself otherwise.

It felt like it is a cool place.  Not fancy/pretentious/trendy but a different kind of cool spot type feel.  The menu just wasn't as good as I expected.\n\nBrussels sprouts - well I think I can cook better than these, didn't quite like the vinegar type flavor.  the crispy leaves were good, but I tend to like my brussels sprouts crispy outside and creamy inside and that takes a long time, the ones here felt undercooked on the inside, so you get a bit of the bitter hard vegetable flavor.  i mean depends on what you like, but I prefer my own!\n\nOctopus tiradito - interesting dish, I've never seen octopus prepared this way. It was actually a sheet of octopus.  With that said, I thought it was way overseasoned... very pungent vinegar flavor\n\nPistachio crusted seared salmon with wasabi sauce - this was okay to good, but I don't like creamy mild flavored wasabi sauces and this is exactly what it is, in fact they really love over creamy sauces at this restaurant as this was not the only one.  wasabi and pistachio flavor pretty light\n\nCrab tostada - crab was good, but if I could describe this, it would be like nachos with crabs... over creamy cheese sauce that totally overflavored the crab... think the sauce would've been okay but they really need to go lighter on that sauce\n\nLamb sliders - was pretty full by this time, but had one bite of it for tasting. another ultra creamy sauce on the sliders... it was a bit much after the last two dishes. there was a hint of truffle oil or something like it, but I don't think it fit very well.\n\nChocolate fondue - very cheap, 7 bucks not too expensive, but chocolate was pretty cold.  Still good, as in how can you go wrong when there's chocolate and fresh fruits!\n\nOverall, I thought it was a bit of a schizophrenic restaurant both in terms of food and ambiance.

But we spoke with the people around us about their dishes.\n\nThis review is detailed, and spot on...\n\nThe food is very good, there's no doubt.\n\nWe had the vege-flauta and a won ton/ravioli-like dish.  Both very tasty.  But both expensive for what they are.  \n\nThe Flauta is practically a shell; not hearty at all.  It tastes good, for sure, and while this isn't necessarily a compliment, it had the after-taste of the old movie theatre/bowling alley Chips and Cheese dip.  Again, not an endorsement, per se, but I loved that stuff.\n\nThe ravioli was quite small.  Yes, shared plates, BUT...\n\nWe each had a glass of wine, and shared brussel sprouts, which were very good.\n\nBartender forgot to put our drinks on our tab, so instead of paying, I handed him the bill back and told him.  He didn't say \"thank you\", but rather he said, \"Oh.\"  Took it, added the wine, and handed it back to me.  Took nothing off bill, didn't offer either.  I wouldn't have asked for anything since I'd already rejected desert.  \n\nOh, and he took the desert menu, after not asking if wanted it, and did the no-look toss/slide right at me, while talking to another customer.\n\nSo, while the food is pretty good, it's not a meal for anyone who needs a bit more.  It's also not cheap, and the people who work there are kinda dicks.\n\nThey sat us at the bar, when there was a 2-top.  Assuming it was for a reservation, someone who didn't have one sat in it 4 minutes after we were at the bar.\n\nI know because I asked.\n\nPull heads from asses, and improve your service.  You're not THAT good, even if you decorated your place all hipstery.\n\n$55 for an app, two small plates, and 2 meh glasses of wine, coupled with shit service?  Nah.

We had the Octopus Tiradito (carpaccio with chili flakes, sea salt, and aioli), and embarrassingly I thought it was just a beautiful dish and the octopus was on it's way.  In fact, it was octopus carpaccio, and the presentation was so gorgeous that it was hard to start eating (once I realized that it was, in fact, the food).  After one bite, however, it was difficult not to inhale it in giant forkfuls.  Per the waiter's recommendation, we also had the tuna tacon and the carnitas.  The tacon tasted great, but was not especially unique.   The carnitas, on the other hand, was an especially flavorful and exciting dish. I also enjoyed a wonderful glass of malbec, while my date ordered an interesting and delicious mezcal-based cocktail.  When I go back, I'll have to go with someone a bit more adventurous who would want to try the crab tostadas, mezcal bbq gorditas, and the eggplant-based dish (my absolute favorite food), assuming they still have these since the menu seems to change frequently.  \n\nThe atmostphere also merits a mention, as it's a fun, energetic, and lively space - none of the dark, divey trend that seems to have invaded all fancy restaurants.  If I need to use a candle/cellphone flashlight to read the menu, it's just too dark.  I also was a bit weirded out by the chirping bird soundtrack in the restroom.

I loved the decor (very kitschy with lots of re-purposed found items), the food was absolutely delcicious and our watier was extremely thoughtful and attentive. \n\nFoodwise we ordered to share - \n\nBrussel sprouts, yellowtail tostada, pistachio encrusted salmon, crab causa & little gem salad. Oh and some sort of cold pot de creme/flan dish that was complimentary (nice!). \n\nThe yellowtail tostada and the brussel sprouts were the two standouts for me. I would definitely order them again - especially the brussel sprouts. Probably my favorite brussel sprout dish to date. I never realized hazelnuts could be so delicious in a savory dish. \n\nEverything else was delicious but I could have probably done without the little gem salad since it was a bit normal.", "author": "Teresa L."}

So, going where the people are, we nabbed a sidewalk table at Lolo.\n\nService was a little on the slow side because they were so busy and our food came out at irradic times (her dishes first, then mine 10 minutes later).  But with great conversation and street people watching, I didn't mind.\n\nWe ordered two dishes each, which was the perfect amount.  The octopus was thinly sliced and grilled and splattered with strong spices and seasoning. The grilled shrimp was done perfectly and nicely spiced. The special for the night was a roasted fig with creme over proscuitto, a tasty combination that you really can't go wrong with.  And finally the flautas stuffed with portabello mushrooms, this was the largest tapas dish we saw at any of the tables around us and it was quite filling with a tasty woody flavor.\n\nI would definitely go back to Lolo for the good food and reasonable prices.", "author": "Karen L."}

We accompanied our meal with a glass of SPARKLING SANGRIA each ($8 ea) - tasty sangria, though a little sweeter and less alcohol than my personal preference.  They serve a  complimentary warm sourdough bread with a delicious dipping sauce made from a blend of sun-dried tomatoes, goat cheese, and basil.  This sauce was absolutely divine, must've been the goat cheese!  \n\nFor two of us, our waitress recommended 2 dishes per person:\n- GRILLED BRUSSEL SPROUTS ($8) - surprisingly delicious - loved the grilled crispy outsides, but the insides were still a little bitter... \n\n- LAMB SLIDERS (2 tiny sliders for $10) - delicious well cooked lamb, with a scrumptious porcine mushroom sauce, and the obligatory side of shoestring fries.  I could've definitely eaten a bigger version of this - or more than one!\n\n- CRAB TOSTADAS ($15) for 2 small tostadas, good chunks of crab, topped with lettuce, and avocado.  Good, but not worth $15. \n\n- WAGYU BEEF MEATBALLS - $14 for 3 two-bite meatballs, which were really ordinary tasting meatballs doused in what could've been Prego marinara sauce -- definitely not worth ordering.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the ICE CREAM SLIDERS ($8) which were essentially two profiteroles, so I was excited when they arrived... but they were soggy so ultimately disappointing.\n\nDelicious food, but overpriced!  $40 pre-tip... and I left not even full.

I returned here a few months ago and had an amazing meal and this second time around was more of the same.\n\nLolo is enjoying being a well-kept neighborhood secret (there's no signage or anything compelling drawing you in from the street) but that may not last that long; it's just too good.  Inside, it's a fun, electic design aesthetic that blends well with the warm, knowledgeable staff and inventive dishes.   The corn-fungus dumplings were delicious but the easy-to-swallow panko-encrusted, flash-fried shrimp served on a jicama tortilla and topped with a tropical relish and chipotle aioli was just heavenly.  Everything we tried was great and even though we sat at the bar, we received great service and wonderful wine recommendations (the $9 Malbec was choice). \n\nI highly recommend dropping in here mid-week for a nice, cozy dinner.

Toy paper boats lined up as their wallpaper, your check comes in a shoe that looks like it came off a doll or a toddler, and recycled newspapers are embedded into the tabletop at the bar.\n\nThen, there's the food. Oh, MAN. The food is spectacular. Even the free bread with their slightly spicy creamy sauce is delicious. Their menu is comprised of small plates, so every dish is meant to be shared and everything is just packed with flavor. You can't go wrong if you start off with the fried brussels sprouts (comes in a red wine vinaigrette and toasted hazelnuts), their signature tacos tropical (fried shrimp tacos with a daikon taco shell), and their lamb sliders are my personal favorite - they come with a savory mushroom sauce and crispy thin shoestring fries. The larger your group is, the more delicious options that are available. But for those dining in smaller parties or on a date, those are my top recommendations. Their menu changes every season or so, so some items may be switched out for others. I'm just going to put my money on this right now and say that nothing will disappoint.\n\nIf it does, keep in mind they do have sangria if you need a mood elevator.\n\nIt won't, though, but you can get sangria anyway.", "author": "Betty W."}

Oxtail tostada was really good, but kind of awkward to eat.  Great, rich flavors though that go well with the crispy tostada.  Padrons are always good, these were naturally a hit.  The octopus dish was cut so thin, it looked like a large plate of sauce, but just under the surface you find the super thin layer of Octo.  Flavors were bold and citrusy, but really kind of a miss.  We probably made a mistake ordering the chipotle marinated ribeye, so I blame us, but it was a nothing special decent sized slab o beef.  Really not memorable.  And the bronzini was largely lackluster to boot.  \n\nYeah, I support my recap, it's a decent spot with a great variety of flavors, but mostly fell short.

They do get minus points for the service.  The waitress serving us was very rude.  She kept taking our food away before we were finished eating it.  It just felt like she wanted to get us out of there, rushing us through our meal despite the fact that there were still open tables of our party's size around.  She kept coming around to frown and sigh at us because we were chatting after our meal.  But once again, it wasn't as if there were a long line of customers waiting to be seated outside.  It was a quiet Tuesday night.  That to me, ruined the experience a bit.  \n\nHowever, to be fair, the service wasn't all bad.  The waiter who took down our order was kind enough to have the portions divided into three (instead of two) so that we could easily share each dish among the three of us.  We thought that was really thoughtful and helpful.  \n\nNow for the food!  \n\nBread:  Ok, this was complimentary but I really liked their bread.  It was served warm and the dip was just the way I liked it with a hint of spice.  \n\nShrimp Ceviche:  YUM!  Seafood was fresh with just enough lime on a cracker.  \n\nMexiterranean cheese fondue:  This was tasty but the cheese wasn't melted enough so it was really hard to scoop with the chips, which kept breaking because the cheese wouldn't unclump.  I don't think I would order this again for that reason.  \n\nTaco Tropical:  This was my favorite!  It was so light and refreshing.  A very memorable dish for me.  I still can't figure out what kind of wrap they used.  It definitely wasn't a corn or flour tortilla, but it was almost like some kind of vegetable?  I have no idea.  Must try again.  \n\nPistachio Encrusted Salmon: This was a pretty good dish, although I would've liked it if it had more of that wasabi cream sauce on it though!\n\nTuna Tacon:  The sauce they used was sweet.  Prepare for it to get messy.  \n\nButternut Squash soup:  It was good but not my favorite.  I'd have to say I like my own butternut squash soup better, not to toot my own horn or anything.  \n\nThere's still so much on their menu that I want to try so I'm definitely coming back for more.

We didn't have a reservation when we arrived, but the girl at the host stand told us there was a reservation available for about 30 minutes later or we could wait for a seat at the bar.  We opted for both, and put our name down while waiting.\n\nI went to the bar to order some drinks while we waited for a seat.  I was asked by who I thought was the barback what I wanted, and ordered two glasses of sangria.  I was surprised at how long it took, and saw the person I ordered from just standing and watching someone else making drinks.  I was watching, too, as I expected they would just pour some sangria out of a pitcher into a glass and I'd be on my way, but that wasn't what was happening.  Did he even actually take my order?  Did he deliver it to the bartender?  Where is my drink?  Well, it turns out yes, the barback was the one who had taken my order, and delivered it after the bartender made it, and it WAS my drink the bartender was making--it seems they make the sangria glass-by-glass.  So, it's not full of fruit as you might expect--it's more of a cocktail--but it looked good, so I wasn't complaining.  The trouble, though, was that somehow the barback had only asked the bartender for ONE sangria and I had to order a second, so I delivered the first glass to my friend waiting by the host stand and I returned to wait again for the second glass to be mixed.  The barback then told me the price was $22, the same as the rest of their cocktails, but when he actually brought the bill, it was the expected $16, plus tax.  (Side note:  I hate it when bars add tax to drinks at the bar--can't you just roll that into the price like most every bar everywhere?  Sheesh.)  Anyhow, the sangria was quite good, and they had a table ready faster than they expected, so by the time the one-by-one drinks were made, they had a table ready for us.  Sweet!\n\nIf I was unimpressed by the interaction at the bar, the table service was great.  We were brought water as we were taking off our coats and sitting down, and our server was there a moment later with menus.  We were quite hungry, so asked immediately for a recommendation of something to start with that we could order as an appetizer.  He suggested the Taco Tropical, which we had seen in other reviews was quite good, so ordered that.  We then sorted out the rest of our meal.  We came up with 5 or 6 things that sounded good, and when our server returned, asked how many items he recommended.  He said 3 or maybe 4 depending on how hungry you are, but he also said it depends on what you're getting.  So, we told him we were also looking at Roasted Beets, Mexiterranean Cheese Fondue, Crab Cake Croquettes, and Tuna Tacon.  The meatballs also looked good, but we opted for the fondue over the meatballs.  He said with the items we had chosen, that would probably still be fine, so we ordered the four additional items (plus the Taco Tropical that was already on the way).\n\nThe Taco Tropical came and we dug in.  It was followed quickly by the Roasted Beets.  The Taco Tropical was awesome, and was the most flavorful thing we ordered.  I didn't realize that the shrimp would be deep-fried, which I was less excited about since I don't eat much fried food, but it was really good all the same.  The Roasted Beets look almost like a layer cake, with the beets and the \"feta mousse\" layered up.  It was good, but not great--we both agreed we wouldn't order that one again.\n\nNext out was the fondue, a cast-iron pot with fire under it containing the cheesy goodness.  When it came out, the cheese wasn't quite all melted yet, but they give you a spoon in it, and we just stirred it a few times before starting on it so it was all melted and mixed with the sauce also in the pot.  The only thing you get to dip in it is tortilla chips, which made it more like nachos than fondue to me, but the seasoning was good and we quite enjoyed the dish.\n\nThe croquettes and Tuna Tacon came out last, at about the same time.  The Tuna Tacon was very good also.  I think I still liked the Taco Tropical better, as it seemed so very fresh and delicious, but both were excellent.  The croquettes were also quite good, and this time I expected the deep-fried preparation, but I thought they were a bit too creamy inside so you didn't notice the texture of the crab meat at all.  I would order them again, but they were lower on the list of our likes.  Definitely the taco dishes led the charge on tastiness at this night's meal.\n\nOverall, it was a tasty meal, the sangria was flavorful, and we had a great time.  The service was always right on time (at the table, anyhow), our water glasses were never empty, and it turned out to be just the right amount of food.  When we finished, we could probably have eaten one more smaller item or dessert, but didn't *need* anything else.  Oddly, we decided to skip dessert and call it a night, but left pleasantly filled and eager to come back another time to try more of the menu.", "author": "Dave B."}

As it is a \"nuevo Latino\" tapas restaurant, the three of us shared a variety of dishes that were delicious and satisfying. We started with the ceviche, and followed that with the crab tostadas, lamb sliders, gorditas with braised short ribs, and a frisee salad to lighten up the meat and carb heavy mix.

The thin slices of the octopus was covered in this spiced oil that to me seemed to have toughened up the flesh.

I love huitlachoche. I first had it at a little restaurant in East LA probably 15 years ago. I was told it was fungus. Well, it's a little \"mushroom\" that grows on corn. Sounds nasty, huh?

Although, this would be the second time I thought it was him at another venue and it was (Absinthe).\n\nBut I was too hungry and frazzled, so maybe it was a moment of prudence where I did not wail out and yell out his name to a group of diners being crowed upon by a short little Japanese baba.\n\nYesterday was one of those odd days where my being was off-kilter.  Maybe it was the lack of coffee.  Maybe it was the lack of sun.  Maybe it was work piling on top of my shoulders.  Suddenly, I felt like I understood the burden that Atlas had taken on with the world, add in a little Sisyphean idiosyncrasies and my Wednesday was a true hump day.\n\nMeeting up with W was a work in itself, and I'm apologizing beforehand to anyone and to him, if I was becoming irritable due to having no lunch and only 3-4 chocolate truffles.  I believe I may have been curt, elusive and for sympathy, the wrong person to elicit such a response.\n\nLast Supper Club was closed, much to our chagrin.  One of my favorite places for a nice dinner and apparently, home to one of the best Pork Tenderloin experiences to have been had.  So, as my patience was starting to wear thin, we walked by Lolo and then did a double back.\n\nBy this point, all conscious processes had shut down and I was ready to keel over.\n\nWe were seated at a two-person table, only because it seems that they are pretty pressed for space;  in addition, be ready to kick your neighbor with the tip of your toe (luckily, our neighbors were two charming women who were quite gracious) and possible jostling of elbows.  \n\nThe interior is rather eclectic, as we were seated across the bar that had an odd Western/Latin/Mediterranean and slightly more casual feel, whereas the main dining area was a bit more formal and dimly lit, good for couples.\n\nThe menu, however slight, reflected an interesting melding of the cultural backgrounds of the owners, Jorge Martinez (Mexico) and Merdol Erkal (Turkey).  I was craving some red meat and my eyes alighted on the flank steak, and however creative, the peach and strawberry mole sauce did not seem too inviting (not much of an mole enthusiast) however W did elect an appetizer for both us, the huitlacoche ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_smut) and ricotta dumplings.  In addition, the waiter did advise us on the panko-encrusted shrimp appetizer mini tacos with a tropical relish and jicama crunch adding in to the experience, and we continued with the order of our entrees, the MahiMahi and the Pork Chop.\n\nMy first reaction to a bite of W's pork chop goes as follows:\n\n\"Wow,\" I remarked, between the first chew and second, \"what is that?  A lamb chop?  It tastes like lamb!\"  We later surmised that perhaps the blue cheese may have added to the flavor in disguise.\n\nThis was an incredible piece of meat done correctly.  Soft, tender....grilled on the outside but not too much to eliminate the subtle flavor of the pork.  I was impressed, as was our neighboring ladies.\n\nMy MahiMahi was perfection.  It came out, covered ablaze in a glorious red light sauce, fiery in color and representative of the native Turkish roots, the heavy use of paprika.  The MahiMahi is the best I've had ever.  It was soft, slightly translucent/opaque, done to perfection and the flakes of the fish were not overtly firm and extremely moist and delicately textured.  However, I would have preferred a slightly less tangy sauce, since the side accompaniment of tossed greens was also drizzled with an interesting vinaigrette, but the sweetness of the chunks of mango proved a differing range of sweet and savory.\n\nI paired this, with a wonderful Dr. Loosen Riesling.\n\nIt was a wonderful meal, despite somewhat clumsy attempts by our waitress (maybe she was new) because by clearing my plate, I don't think she saw the red paprika spiked sauce drizzle off and onto the floor, barely missing the scarf of the charming lady to the right of me.  Otherwise, our experience was a good one.  I'd definitely be back to try more of the appetizers and so that W could get his fix of the most excellent pork chop.  Maybe even more, if they doubled the portion to two chops  ;)", "author": "Miika M."}

Maybe it was just being in the company of one of my favorite people, but all of this together somehow made for the best night ever.  \n\nAppetizer--  \nI love when we asked our cute waiter what the huitlacoche dumplings were, and he in very vague terms described huitlacoche as mushroom like, but with a lighter taste.  Oh, a nasty fungus that attacks corn?  AKA corn smut?  Why didn't you just say so!  Yum!  And actually, it was.  Especially the sweet corn foam, which was thankfully more of a pudding.  So good that we smeared it on the dumplings, hunks of bread, whatever else was lying about the table, then stuffed it down before they could take the plate away. \n\nEntrees-- \nFlank steak with strawberry and peach mole and a side of frites. The frites were way better than those at Plouf.  Ordered the steak medium and it came cooked nicely.  And the mole:  I might have licked the bowl if no one was watching.\n\nSeafood stew with mussels, fish, scallops, and noodles.  The wine based broth was light but still really flavorful.  There probably could've been more noodles, but this didn't detract from the dish.  It came with a little pile of Turkish paprika to sprinkle over it.  \n\nDessert--  \nChocolate fondue with squares of banana bread and ripened berries.  Not amazing, but a fun way to end the meal.\n\n$50 w/o tip.  \n\nThe bill came tucked into a picture book of Afghan Hounds.

Not that there's anything wrong with that, I guess, and they do an OK job here. The sangria is \"sparkling\" which I guess means mixed with some dry champagne, and it was actually pretty great. Two little shrimp tacos were on some sort of paper-thin tortilla -- I actually thought it *was* paper at first, and it fell apart immediately. Tasty but tiny and 10 or 12 bucks from what I remember. 6 teensy huitlacoche dumplings were just crunchy sort of potstickery things, all bread, barely noticeable filling. Patatas bravas, my favorite tapa, were terrible -- too-large, mushy potato chunks covered with a blob of too-thick tomatoey puree, no sign of aoili. Lamb sliders were yummy and came with some shoestring fries and beet salad, but they were honestly petit-four size, and $6 each.  \n\nService was nice, the space is cozy and colorful, but dinner for two with a couple drinks was over $100.

More to come on that.\n\nThis place is pretty cute and kitschy. There are two separate rooms, so don't worry, it's bigger than you think. \n\nFood overall is good, but not amazing. Here's a breakdown:\n\nFried Brussel Sprouts: I'm pretty picky about brussel sprouts... and these were pretty darn good. Sometimes they're too soggy, or not flavored enough. This was was fried with a good crisp, not too oily, and well flavored so it wasn't overwhelming. \n\nTaco Tropical: Came highly recommended by the waiter. Also, one of the top dishes. While I'm not thinking when's the next time I will get it, it was pretty good.\n\nOctopus Carpaccio: It was... interesting. Strongly spiced, it had a nice smoky flavor. However, it did not seem like carpaccio. The way it looked, and the texture definitely made me wonder if it is actually cooked... I wouldn't get this again. Mainly because if I want carpaccio, this is not what I would think it is. \n\nWonton Ravioli: I would not recommend this. Especially when eating all the other foods that have a robust flavor, this comes out very drab and lackluster.\n\nLamb Sliders, Ox Tongue Sliders: Both were pretty good. I liked the sauce on the lamb sliders, but the ox tongue better. They were good, but not mind blowing. \n\nIn the end, the four of us all grabbed for the bill. And as a result, the waiter says, oh no, this is how we settle it. He proceeds to bring out a shock machine (YES A REAL ONE) with two electrodes/wand type things. The two boys on the end hold the electrodes, and then the two girls held hands with each other and the boys, so that we formed a ring. He proceeded to turn it on. Whoever lets go, the other half has to pay, says the waiter. At first, it's a gentle vibration throughout all our hands. No one lets go, so he goes, higher, and higher, and higher. Until I start to wonder, I should not let this be happening. There was some slight twistedness to how excited he got at turning it higher and higher. And people, if you've never been shocked for a good 5 minutes, it's not as gentle as you think. He proceeded to screw with our minds by going higher, lower, and a nice little cosine wave for us. Us chinese people have a lot of pride, so we didn't let go for a long time. In fact, so long that we couldn't control our hands, so you could see our hands letting go of their own accord. \n\nYeah that was entertaining, but I thought it got a little extreme at the end. Being shocked at high intensity levels is only so fun for so long. But hey, if you don't believe me, give it try, and make sure to hold on for a long time, k?", "author": "Nanette W."}

My local host for the evening suggested the place, having heard about it through the foodie grapevine. We were ecstatic to find upon arrival that there was one table available with no waiting required. \n\nWe had a salad to share as an appetizer - yummy but not overly memorable. We were however also given some delicious bread with even better dipping sauce. I rarely eat bread these days but found myself asking for seconds.  \n\nFor my entree, I chose the Mahi Mahi, which was served with a nice paprika red sauce (light but still flavorful) and a side of greens. I was very happy to see that the fish was not overcooked - a mistake people seem too make way to often with fish like Mahi Mahi. My dinner companion ordered a steak with a peach-strawberry mole sauce. She was more than happy with her choice and I was too, from the bites I stole off my companion's plate. The sauce alone was worth the visit - honestly, what a unique ingenious combination of flavors between the chocolate of traditional mole sauces and then the two fruits. \n\nOne question remains, regarding the vibe between the front and back dining rooms. My dining companion and I sat in the front room because that is where the one available table was located, but the back room seemed to be even more hoping. Is it? I got a vibe from the back room, when I walked through to get to the bathroom, similar to that of my favorite NY restaurant - Barrio Chino.

Then my little Yelp-wired brain quickly calculated your rating down to four stars.\n\nYou were getting 5 stars for...\n\n+Convenient wait system.  Because you took down our cell phone #, we were able to go across the street so I could get the most disgusting strawberry caipirinha at Cava22 while waiting for our table.\n+Your delicious, unique menu.  The zucchini cakes were absolutely wonderful, with the tangy yogurt balancing out the crispy-on-the-outside-but-soft-on-the-inside fried goodness.  You made brussels sprouts palatable by frying them and seasoning them lightly.  And the mushroom-and-ricotta dumplings were heavenly, hot out of the fryer and served with the tomato and cheese puree.\n+Your cute decor.  Small, but bright and friendly and casual.  My type of place.\n\nBut then you lost a star when...\n\nWe'd ordered the stuffed pepper originally, along with the brussels sprouts and zucchini cake (all $6).  After we were mostly done with the brussels sprouts and zucchini, we waited for our stuffed pepper.  And then we waited some more.  Finally, when we flagged down one of the waiters and asked him if our pepper was on its way, he told us very apathetically that they'd run out of peppers for the night.  That's how we ended up with the dumplings; they made no apologies for NOT TELLING US that our food wasn't in stock, nor did they apologize for not having it anymore.  So, we just ordered something else.\n\nWhen we got our bill, the waiter had charged us for the pepper.  Um, no, that's not okay.  Good thing we double-checked, and told the waiter.  At every other restaurant that I've been to (where they've made the same mistakes), the waitstaff has always been overly apologetic.  We didn't hear a single \"sorry\" during our time at Lolo, which kind of irked me.\n\nI'm not sure if it was because we were seated at the bar as opposed to a regular table with the same waiter/waitress, but seriously?  Sure, your food was EXCELLENT, but your service prevented you from getting all 5 shiny stars.  I'll definitely be back for the food, so hopefully your waitstaff can step up their game.", "author": "Tori S."}

The service was great as well; our waiter asked us if we've been here before and then proceeded to recommend and elaborate on some dishes. We ended up getting: tuna tacon (basically a tuna taco?), the wonton ravioli with arugula and pine nuts and reggiano, and the fried brussel sprouts. I also ordered the sangria.\nThe tuna taco was really good and I loved the flavors.. I think it was my favorite dish and I'm not usually a fan of tuna. I liked that the brussel sprouts were all crispy and slightly burnt, because I enjoy the taste of carcinogens. Didn't care for the balsamic dressing that was paired with them, though. However, my ... male friend (hah) liked the balsamic flavor, so diff'rent strokes. I thought that idea of \"wonton ravoli\" sounded strange but lo and behold, the pasta dish resembled a giant ravoli that also looked like a wonton wrapper. I think it was pretty average, nothing too spectacular. Also, my sangria was a little disappointing... but most sangrias that I've had are really mediocre compared to that of Cha Cha Cha's. \nOverall: good service, good ambiance, but average food. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again, but wouldn't complain if friends wanted to.", "author": "Jacqueline K."}

My friend made a reservation online and the soonest open spot they had was at 11PM.  No problem!  Arrived there around 7PM and were seated outside in 5 minutes even though it seemed packed.  Okay, here's the run down:\n\nTomato and Burrata salad - delicious and refreshing! But I love cheese & olives, so this was all around tasty for me\n\nOctopus tiradito - The flavoring of this was good - salt/lemon/creaminess - but I couldn't really taste the octopus (which was so thinly sliced that when it came out, it just looked like a bunch of sauce on a plate); regardless, because the sauce was good, I liked this one, although I can't say it was my favorite.\n\nDungeness crab tostadas - I'd have to say THESE were my favorite. The crab meat didn't taste like it had been frozen (so fresh and so clean!) and it meshed surprisingly well with the guacamole and whatever else was in these crispy, soft, savory bites of YUM.\n\nLamb sliders - more like lamb & green pepper meatballs in a bun.  Good, tender, not gamey, but not anything to write home about.\n\nCeviche - LOVE ceviche, and this one tasted fresh and the seafood was chunky (vs. chopped up into bits where you don't know what you're eating) & flavorful.\n\nChocolate fondue - eh, it's fruit.  It's melted chocolate. Can't really go wrong here, but nothing spectacular.\n\nSangria - really liked the fact they used sparkling wine.  \n\nI just made myself really hungry by writing this post... \n\nAnyway, I went with friends who thought the dishes were pretty good as well (and you know when you go with enthusiastic friends, the food just tastes better?)  I'm taking my boyfriend to try this place out again.  We'll see what his discriminating palate has to say.", "author": "CJ K."}

The Brussels were too oily and burned beyond recognition (they called it caramelized, but the difference is the unmistakable burnt flavor).

Shrimp tacos were maybe the best we had but the fry oil could have stood some extra blotting to get the excess grease off.  the presentation is great; however I found most ingredients to be over seasoned and the salt content too high.\nAmbiance was ok.

The place is very inventive from the decor to the menu. The shrimp tacos here are probably among the top 10 things I've had the pleasure of chewing. It's served on a thin slice of jicama, instead of tortilla, which does an incredible job at neutralizing the acidity of the salsa that coats the crispy shrimp. I believe it also had some pineapple in it to give it  sweetness... sweet and spicy is def my fav flavor duo. Also had the octopus carpaccio which was a lil odd, but definitely tasty (if you like tamarind and spice. The pistachio encrusted salmon was to-die-for as well.

For grub we had two glasses of malbec (at a reasonable $8) followed by the chips & salsa (free!), brussel sprouts ($6), chicken tostadas ($8), and carnitas ($15). Our fav dish by far was the brussel sprouts. The portion was large, the brussels were perfectly cooked and the hazelnuts were delicious and crunchy. Our least fav was the carnitas. Despite the yummy homemade tortillas, the meat wasn't as flavorful as we hoped (Nopalito carnitas have better flavor in my opinion).

I loved the casual, unpretentious groove--it felt like I was in my grandmother's kitchen again. The staff was warm, friendly and attentive. Since it was raining out, we sat inside, in the second room, in a cozy corner booth. Since my dining companions were regulars and quite familiar with my eclectic palate, they knew exactly what to order: fried brussels sprouts, Taco Tropicale (panko-crusted shrimp), duck confit, flank steak, scallops, ceviche mirasole and loads of flatbread. All of it was sumptuous--fresh, flavorful and spicy. The brussels sprouts were very tasty, albeit slightly on the burnt side; my hands-down favorite was the Taco Tropicale; I was so glad no one else wanted the last one--I devoured it before anyone could change her/his mind.

Fast forward to 8:20 when they awesome hostess called my cell phone and told me our table was being cleaned, so we started to walk over. We ordered a bottle of some tempranillo, because not enough places in SF (or anywhere I go really) carry tempranillo wines, such a shame. They also brought out some bread and probably something to dip it into, but this is just wasting space when you should really just order another small plate. \n\nAnyway, food...we went with a pescatarian, seriously not even an issue here. Started with the guacamole and fresh blue corn chips. I have a thing for blue corn. It is just delicious. Their guac was simple but delicious. Very good. We also tried the fried brussel sprouts. MMMM. The zinfandel vinaigrette they flavor it with is just the right balance of perfect!  We also got some kind of empanadas, not really sure now because the menu has changed (and I am already planning my next adventure back because now there are crab tostadas on it...yes please, love crab!) but they were light and just the right amount of crunch and filled with spinach and oaxaca cheese, I want to say. By the recommendation of our waiter we also had the tuna tacon tacos, which were pretty awesome too. Everything was well flavored. BUT overall, the ONE THING that blew my mind, literally, have been craving since I took that sweet last bite, and my friends and I have been reminiscing about, are the Taco Tropical's. Out of this world. Just genius. The description they give you is: panko and spice-dusted shrimp, topped with a tropical relish and spicy aioli....doesn't give them justice. These babies are not your average tacos. no, no no! They are on a jicama \"tortilla\", so that makes them the best taco I have ever had. Hands down. \n\nThings to consider: all the small plates come with 2 pieces (2 tacos, 2 empanadas, etc, so you have to ask for one extra or whatever if you go with 3 people like we did). In the case of the Taco Tropical's you should order one plate per person because 1 isn't enough.\n\nCan't wait to try more. Definitely one of my favorite places, ever.\n\nOh, the bill for all that wildly delicious food and bottle of rare wine, including a generous tip, was about $40 a person. Stuffed happy friends, what else can a girl ask for!?", "author": "Heidi J."}

I don't know if it's the ability to try many dishes in one seating or my love of Spain and the memories the food inspires, but I am always down for it and when I see small plates deployed on the menu, I secretly rejoice. I am also inspired to write long sentences it seems. I have had Alegrias on my sights for a while so when someone suggested tapas as a dinner option, this was my first candidate. However, it was fully booked (or closed) so I stumbled upon Lolo's on yelp.  \n\nAmbiance (4): There are two sides to this place; we ended up in the small intimate one next to the open air kitchen. It's very kitschy and employs curtains and tablecloths that younger generations won't recognize as having once inhabited an ethnic minority grandma's house...maybe Southern grandma too. This gives it the Mission je ne sais quoi (sp?). \n\nFood (4): We had about six dishes and they were all good with some being outstanding. The most memorable were the tuna tostadas with roasted chili peppers, cabbage, cotija cheese, sauce; fried brussel sprouts; and the side of warm bread they served with a sundried tomato goat cheese sauce. There were so many good sauces that we kept ordering bread to sop them up. The only dish that approached the realm of lackluster were the mushroom empanadas which were good but could use some help in getting to that restaurant level. Meaning, I can see them at a bakery for 8 bucks a dozen, not so much as a restaurant dish. \n\nThe desserts were simple, flavorful, and light. The wine list was varied and completely affordable and conducive to bottle ordering which to me is a requirement for Spanish tapas. The list could have used more tempranillo options though. Anyhow, I didn't have my table's support since they opted for sangrias, which unfortunately, did not include any drunken fruit.  \n\nService (3): We had to wait a while before we could place our order, but after that, it got better. Solid but not outstanding. \n\nValue (4): Prices were really good and the total bill was surprisingly low.\n\nOverall: I really liked this place. The food was good, the atmosphere was casual and homey and the value was great. I would definitely go back; especially since it seems Alegrias is closed, Laiola is closed, the Basque one in North Beach was just okay, and Contigo seemed a bit pricey.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-01-26", "description": "Not 100% on this place. Much of me is very mad I did not try the suggested pistachio crusted salmon with wasabi cream sauce. I did, however, go by the server's recommendations. We got ceviche, the taco tropical, the cheese plate, and the crab with chrizo something or other (in truth, the server said it was too cold outside for ceviche and didn't exactly give us the 'you must get it' with the cheese plate). I thought the Taco tropical was ok. It is panko and spice dusted shrimp tropical relish and chipolte aoili. It kinda reminded me of an americanized sushi roll that tastes like tempura and some thick ketchup cream sauce. It was good, but not outstanding. \n\n\nThe ceviche was alright, but it was all clustered into one square and had avacado, which I'm actually slightly allergic too (the avocado is not listed on the menu). I liked it, but it was nothing like what they serve at Limon. Then the cheese plate arrived. The cheese plate was pretty good, but lord were the portions small. I enjoy getting a cheeseplate at Terroir, a wine bar I believe to be incredibly expensive. They're cheese plate portions are WAY bigger than Lolo's though, and a lot better. \n\nBUT, not all failed. The crab thingy I mentioned (I can't find it on an online menu) was FANTASTIC. Fresh crap in a tortilla dipped in what very much seemed like CHRIZO CREAM SAUCE. I know, you're arties are frighened, the flat stomach you still have at this moment would hoover in a corner if it could upon hearing these words. But lord, it's good and it's worth it. In fact, I'd go back to Lolo's just to get that dish. \n\nAs for the wine, which until now I have not mentioned, it is alright. It is not fantastic by any means. It reminds me of stuff I buy at my corner store (to Lolo's credit, the corner store near my house has a great selection). \n\nWith that being said, Lolo is a good spot. But if you don't got a lot of dough consider going somewhere where the food is more CONSISTENTLY up to par for the prices you pay.", "author": "Alexandra M."}

The decor is pretty hipster-like and intimate, a good place for a light dinner with a couple of trendy friends.  \n\nThe menu is a mixture of small plates and main dishes (which also are pretty small) - for our table of 4, we ordered 4 small plates and 2 main courses and that was about right.  For starters, the house bread/creamy dip is amazing - we must have gone through 4 portions over the course of dinner.  I recommend trying the octopus small plate (imagine carpaccio-style octopus meets ceviche) as were the shrimp tacos (they're really an appetizer for two, a la Nopalito).  The chilean sea bass is also excellent, cooked plain and served with a number of spices on the side.  \n\nFinally, kudos to the chef/owner for coming out to answer our questions on the dish...we were asking about the spices with the sea bass and he gave us a bag of Turkish spice!

Within the first 20 seconds of walking in I had already already apologized 4 times for smacking someone in the face. \n\nThat said, its miniature size has a certain charm, like I was walking into a friend's dinner party - it felt like you could say hello to everyone in the room and be welcomed. Groups of friends were gathered for small birthday celebrations, everyone clearly having great time, and the decor is made from spoons, or rice bags, or other household riffraff. They certainly know how to recycle.\n\nMost of the tables were only for groups of 3-4 people (very little seating for groups of 2...very little seating in general), so we had to sit at the bar. Luckily we were here on a Tuesday night around 8, so it wasn't too crazy. I'd imagine the wait would be impossibly long on a busier night in the mission.\n\nIn terms of the service, it was...meh. It wasn't too slow, or rude, or anything in particular that would make me look down on it, but it wasn't exceptionally friendly. They didn't go out of their way to make our experience any better.\n\nAnd, although I can see the appeal in coming here with a close group of friends, the food is very hit and miss. While the octopus and zucchini cakes made my taste buds smile, the ceviche and wasabi crusted salmon left much to be desired - such as seasoning. Unfortunately, in terms of food, lolo falls into the typical pitfall of many a tapas restaurant - because there is so much variety, there is also a lot of inconsistency - some plates are clearly done better than others. \n\nThat said, if you order the right things, come here with a group of close friends, are comfortable knowing that all of your wildly inappropriate conversations are sure to hit the listening ear of your neighbor, and are down with bumping into the people around you, I'm sure you can have an amazing meal.", "author": "Kelsey E."}

My favorite tapa was the pistachio crusted salmon and the kobe beef tacos. Although the tapas are a little more on the pricier side, they are definitely worth it. I LOVED the pistachio sauce on the salmon. Service was great, and the vibe was very friendly and casual. The end of the night was a total blur after drinking an entire  bottle of wine here. Good times, good times. Thank you, Lolo!", "author": "Susana M."}

There are a lot of drink options and the ones we had tasted good and weren't watered down. The dishes on the menu all looked good and the ones we tried all tasted great. The only problem was the portion size. Its pretty typical for SF and this type of restaurant but could still hope for a little more on each plate. The lamb sliders were amazing. So was the taco tropical. If only there was three of each per plate instead of two for each of those dishes. The squid in black ink croquetas were pretty great too. The octopus tiradito was a little on the oily side. Overall great dinner and drinks and casual place to enjoy the night. We sat outside and it was perfectly warm enough.", "author": "Henry W."}

For dessert, we had the \"Ice Cream Sandwich\" and finished off the mini pitcher of chocolate. To drink, I had the Pineapple, Basil, Vodka (2oz pours = good drinks), and my girlfriend had the Black Mojito. We followed that up with a glass of Sangria each.

Our waiter was helpful in explaining all the items on the menu. The same goes for the wine list. He let us sample a few whites before ordering a bottle. For food, we ordered the tuna tacon (seared tuna), taco tropical (shrimp), charcoal-grilled flank steak, and crab tacos.\n\nEverything was excellent minus the tuna tacon. I think the flavor would have been better if it were left raw instead of seared. The crab tacos were sublime served with a spicy aioli and mini soft tortillas. I heard oohs and ahhs in regard to the flank steak. My husband wasn't fond of the flank steak but his taste buds, not the kitchen, are to blame since it came with a bleu cheese sauce and he is not a bleu cheese fan.\n\nWe didn't sample any of the desserts but left the restaurant content.

They have cowboy boots full of hot pink feather dusters that resemble flowers, shoe soles for borders, and (spanish) newspaper covered walls (and bar area) that are flanked with deep aqua framed mirrors. It is quite a site. Thoroughly modern and new.\n\nWe tried a tropical taco that had a hicama shell and perfectly cooked breaded shrimp with a sweet tropical relish. Out of the 4 restaurants we went to, we agreed that that dish was the best that we'd had. We also had thinly sliced octopus carpaccio that was also very tasty. \n\nTo drink we had a sparkling sangria.

Unlike most tapas/wine spots in SF, Lolo is not too dimly lit, doesn't have the standard menu, and doesn't fall prey to the usual date-spot decor. Instead it opts for wacky- decorations span from brooms to car doors to soccer balls. It's still a perfectly good date spot, with tastefully decorated couples tables and good cocktails. The food was a hit- most everything we ordered was outstanding. Do not miss the broccolinis and the avocado tacos.

Lol\u00f3 occupies a small, cosy space, adorned with home-made art and knick-knacks that make for a colorful, tongue-in-cheek atmosphere.  I understand the art changes regularly, but the night that we visited one room was adorned with hundreds of childish origami boats.  In the other room one wall was covered with Mexican labels from cans of refried beans.  My favorite touch of all, though, was the toilet - decorated all around with blue sky, sandy beach  and a small portable stereo playing the sound of gently lapping waves on the seashore.  Excellent!\n\nThe food - conforming to the Mexican tapas style - is similarly informal but not at all frivolous.  The \"tacos tropical\" combined panko-dusted shrimp, chipotle aoli and a tropical fruit relish and were served not in tortillas, but in thin slices of j\u00edcama - a refreshing twist!  We dined with two other couples (six people in total) and were thankfully able to eat at least one serving of most things on the menu.  Everything was great, but the stand-out dish was probably the pistachio-encrusted salmon with the wasabi cream sauce.\n\nLol\u00f3 is a great spot - a fun place to be - and the vibrant atmosphere of the place fits the imagination of the food and surrounds.", "author": "Dom B."}

And one thing you should definitely do is visit the bathroom (never thought I would say that). I was expecting a small, dark bathroom given the size of the front room. Let's just say it's not...\n\nThe food is also much more unique and has a broader range of flavors than traditional tapas restaurants. The flavors were bold and bright. I would describe the cuisine as New Latin American with an Asian and Mediterranean influence. The vibrant array of colors in the dishes also made the food as appealing to the eye as it was for the taste buds.\n\nWe ordered 9 different dishes, and my favorites were the Tacos Tropical and the Seafood Sope. They were INCREDIBLE!\n\nTacos Tropical - Damn good shrimp tacos! The crispy panko crust of the shrimp, the zest of the tropical relish, and the creaminess of the chipotle aioli...together created a wonderful explosion of flavors and textures in my mouth.\n\nSeafood Sopes - The star of this dish was the rich seafood sauce of the shrimps, scallops, and green peppers. It captured the sweet essence of the sea, and was balanced by the pepper aioli. The red cabbage slaw was also a great complement\n\nSeared Scallops - The citrus fennel sauce looks like it's going to be heavy, but it was light and refreshing. The slices of cucumber under the scallops also accentuated the coolness of the dish.\n\nDuck Confit Tacos - A twist on Peking duck. I liked how thin the corn tortillas were and how they came out fresh and hot. The shredded duck was really oily, but it had good flavor.\n\nOctopus Carpaccio - I can't help but laugh when I think about this dish. The octopus is sliced so thin that it's virtually invisible (especially under the dim lighting of the front room). So when this dish came out, we thought it was just a sauce and sat waiting for the rest of the dish to come out. The person who brought our food didn't speak English, so he just shrugged when we asked what it was. Finally, our waiter told us it was the octopus carpaccio and the octopus was already on the plate. So funny! The pepper flakes overpowered the octopus, so I couldn't taste much beyond pepper and smoke.\n\nPistachio Encrusted Salmon - The wasabi cream and unagi sauce gave this dish an interesting Asian flair. The flavors worked well, and it came out at the perfect temperature -- hot and crispy on the outside while nicely rare on the inside.\n\nWe also had the baked brie, the heirloom tomato salad with feta mousse, and the chocolate fondue for dessert. They were good, but not particularly memorable. I also want to mention their reasonably priced wine list. The average price per bottle was about $40.

The place looks really cool: supposedly it's supposed to elicit a dog-racing theme...? But looks like a circus to me! (Stripes here, mirrors there, random peacock images everywhere...). I don't get it, but it's definitely eye-catching in a special way.\n\nAs for the food:\n\nComplimentary: Warm, toasted baguette with a fun, interesting dipping sauce (looks like thousand island...tastes like salsa + yogurt)\n\n1) Pistachio Encrusted Salmon with Wasabi Cream, $12ish\n- The salmon was definitely seared really well, but the pistachios just did NOT make sense on the plate! We both agreed that it was as if they were kinda just thrown there to up the price. I also wasn't a fan of the sauce: there wasn't a great emphasis on the wasabi in the cream, and the other tangy sauce was too much on the soy sauce side imo.\n\n2) Hultiacoche (mushroom) + Ricotta Stuffed Dumplings, $8ish\n- Yum!!! You get 5 pieces and we really enjoyed this dish! Kinda indian influenced I think: imagine if saag paneer were encompassed by a crispy tortilla with a tika masala dipping sauce -- that's what this taste like! All my favorite indian dishes combined into one! (except...it's turkish-mexican). \n\n3) Stuffed Bell Pepper, $6\n- Flavors were comforting and the rice was nice and creamy, but the bell pepper itself was a little too mushy for my liking. The presentation, regardless, was beautiful.\n\n4) Bison served over a blue-chip tortialla stuffed with black beans with a side of root vegetables, $15ish\n- The winner of the night.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-07-09", "description": "This place is adorable!  Decided to have dinner here unplanned, made a call on the way up to the city to see if we could get a reservation for two and the waiter put us first on the list.  The estimated wait from the time I called was 45 to an hour which wasn't a big deal since we still had to drive up.  We were told that they would call us when our table was ready, how convenient!  Had we been waiting at the restaurant, we would have easily been able to walk across the street to have a beer or two until we got the call.\n\nThe place is uber tiny so if you're planning on having dinner here with a group of 6 or more, i'd go elsewhere.  When you walk into the restaurant, there are probably 4 tables that seat mostly 2 people but they also have space next door which is their bar area.  Again, uber tiny and can't accommodate a party of more than 6 unless you plan on reserving the whole restaurant!  \n\nThe staff is very friendly and accommodating and the place, cute.  If you're hoping for good sangria, theirs is more non-traditional.  The sangria here isn't sweet like most since they mix theirs with champagne so it's a little on the dry side but the food is delish!  \n\nMy husband and I shared quite a few things and all were great.  The ceviche mirasol was filled with fresh seafood with a little spicy bite.  The taco tropical isn't your typical crispy taco.  It has more of a refreshing bite to it with a radish-like carpaccio \"shell\".  This was so good I wanted another order!  The octopus tiradito is an octopus carpaccio, tasty but I didn't care for it much since it was a little on the rubbery side.  We also tried the pistachio encrusted salmon which was good but it was encrusted with a little too much of the nuts, the seared mahi tostada and charcoal grilled flank steak.  In all, everything we tried was worth it, even though we didn't care for 1 or 2 of the items, I will definitely be back to eat here again!", "author": "Kris S."}

Thanks to my cousin, a SF local, who took us here :) Since it is tapas style, it was nice that we had a group of 8 because we practically got to sample most of the menu with dessert! It's smart business though, small little dishes that forces you to order more and ring up the bill, but nonetheless it was worth it since food and presentation were all above our expectations. That's the only reason I docked 1/2 of a star off. There wasn't anything that we ordered that I didn't truly enjoy, my favorites were the Taco Tropical with its spicy aioli and the fresh Ceviche Mirasol yum yum!!! Meal goes great with a bottle of white wine. It's a fun and intimate environment and their restaurant decor is pretty creative.

All were tasty and filling.\n\nEven better when I bit into my tostada and had the whole guacamole filled thing fall into my lap they were very attentive bringing me 3 new napkins as replacements.  \n\nI liked Lolo because it wasn't as rowdy as most tapas places which are usually excuses for groups of people to drink way too much sangria.

The pistachio encrusted salmon was lightly fried and the wasabi cream sauce offered a subtle heat.  Out of everything we enjoyed that night, the best of the best was the octopus, served carpaccio style that was peppered and spicy with a flavorful aioli sauce...definitely the most memorable dish!\n\nAt the end of our meal, dessert was a must to be shared, but the menu didn't have a gluten free option.   As we were about to ask for the check, the waiter brought us their chocolate fondue with an extra serving of berries for our gluten free friend and banana bread for us to share in the dipping.  \n\nLet us not forget the most important of all, their selection of worldly wines complemented the creative menu to the tee.

From day one, I've had friends, co-workers, and strangers passing by suggesting restaurants for me...esclaiming about a culinary favorite that I 'have to try!'  Recently, I found myself being the hostess and tour guide when my best friend of 23 years came to visit.  Our last night together, I suggested we dine at Lolo.  Coincidentaly, my boyfriend was joining us.  This man has been my foodie guide in the city and has introduced me to a number of locations I should be keeping track of.  But this night, I was the one making the reservation and introducing my peeps to one of my favorites.\nLolo was busy, as expected, on a Wednesday evening.  It was chilly, as is expected in August here.  We were quickly greeted by the owner, who I had unknowingly made our reservations with and offered beverages while we waited to be seated.  So far, so good.\nThere were five in our party, my three friends who have a more 'selective' palette than my boyfriend and I.  We started to order dish after dish, and each bite was a surprise, a delight and built the excitement for whatever was to follow.  In addition to an amazing performance for the varying group of tastebuds, our service was also impeccable.  The busboy was always smiling and ready to help us.  Our waiter was prompt and knowledgable (he even let us order after the kitchen closed....shhhhh).\nIn all seriousness, this is a tapas restaurant that you want to wait in line for.  All the dishes are rich and stimulating with flavor and color.  The atmosphere is eclectic and interesting.  And more than anything, if you are in the mood for something fun and just damn good....but not fussy, Lolo will be one of the first picks to pop up as an option.  Enjoy!", "author": "Jessica C."}

Since I've been out of the SF culinary scene for quite some time, one of my travelmate's sister recommended this place.\n\nAmbiance:  It's a cute little restaurant with a main dining room and and adjoining bar/dining room next door.  The bright, near-psychedelic patio benches adorning the dining room adds a lot of interest to your dining experience.  The service was quite warm and attentive.\n\nFood:  It's a tapas restaurant with a selection of \"larger\" sized plates.  \n\nTaco Tropical - probably the best dish of the night.  All the fresh savory flavors blended well.  The fresh jicama \"wrap\" was a very nice touch.\n\nOctopus Tiradito - interesting texture as the octopus appeared to have been pounded flat...so flat that we couldn't tell if there was anything on the plate aside from the seasoning/dressing.\n\nHuitlacoche and Ricotta Dumplings - nothing overly special about these...tasty, but not worth the price\n\nFlank Steak - the mole sauce was very tasty, but the beef was bland and chewy (which could have been easily remedied if they cut against the grain).\n\nSeafood Sope - the seafood served on top of the sope was pretty tasty, akin to the taco tropical.  The red cabbage slaw/salad was quite refreshing, but the sope didn't fair well in this dish.\n\nFinal Thoughts:  I love tapas, and had my fair share over the years.  Although I respect and admire Lolo's effort and creativity, the end result doesn't quite justify the prices per dish especially when you get get better for the same price or cheaper for the same quality elsewhere.

The decor is really funky, which is what made me finally stop to look at the menu after months of walking by.  I recommend sitting at the bar if there are just two people in your group.  The bartender was super friendly and we were well taken care of throughout the meal.\n\nA word of caution, we ordered way too much food and wine for two people.  They don't mean bite-sized small plates at all.  We loved the duck and the roasted tomato salad.  And the zucchini cakes were amazing.  \n\nEat here when you have some time to sit and enjoy the scenery and bring some friends so you can order all the yummy food without stuffing yourself like we did.

It's an unassuming gem of a restaurant that has somehow managed to stay under the radar of the die-hard sf foodie scene. Perhaps that's because they don't use everything organic and local, but these folks do know how to make seriously tasty food.\n\nThe flavors were unique and refreshed my palate. It was a welcome change from the usual californian fare, wood fired pizza, fried chickpea-something with chicken liver something routine. \n\nWhat I loved: reasonable prices (dinner for two was about $70, with drinks for both of us, a salad, 4 plates, and dessert); no wait! (sometimes you just want to eat right away), DELICIOUS food.\n\nhighly recommend: tacos tropicale, brioche + ice cream dessert. the zucchini cakes were pretty good too. \n\navoid: the sangria. it's sparkling, has ice in it, no fruit, and isn't really that great. next time, i'll bring my own bottle of wine or pick one of theirs\n\ncan't wait to go back; this place totally surprised me in an unexpected wonderful way.", "author": "sfgal g."}

Ever.\n\nWe all split the following things:\n* Thinly sliced octopus in chili oil\n* Zucchini fritters\n* Fried brussel sprouts\n* Crab & chorizo tacos\n* Ceviche\n* Whole roasted fish\n\nEverything was PERFECT, but the octopus and brussels really stood out for me. The fish was excellent, if not quite as well seasoned as the rest (but I love that they left the skin, which is my favorite bit of fish).\n\nYes, it's a tiny space, but I never felt crowded. The service was exceptional, and the order-to-table timing was so fast it was unbelievable. Even though we only had an hour, it was one of the best dining experiences I've had in quite some time.\n\nTo all those whining about a meal here being unaffordable, all of that (plus bread with a delicious tapanade) and a bottle of wine brought the check to $120. That's dinner and drinks for four at $30 a head.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-11", "description": "There is no better way to start the New Year than by dining at a great restaurant.\n\nLolo is that place for me.  New, funky, creative, and a hell of a lot of fun - a recipe for success in my book.  \n\nThe decor is one of the happiest ones I have seen in a while - full of deep, bright colors, and found objects enjoying new life (from sneaker soles to Luchador masks to bright oilcloth prints).  You can get a taste of it by visiting the website of the designer at www.lolomuebles.com.  Eclectic and tasteful, trend-right without trying too hard.  It's kind of Oilily meets Villians Vault, with a Central American accent.  I have to agree with Ed M. this place is sooo Mission (the owners are from Guadalajara and Turkey), and also what makes dining in San Francisco so special.\n\nThe staff is very friendly and the food was beautifully presented and came out quickly.  Sharing dishes is the way to go here, and they made great recommendations (we also had a little help from a neighborhood chef-friend of ours who was dining with us).  \n\nHere's what we enjoyed:\nPanko-encrusted Shrimp - this was the favorite dish of the table - lightly fried shrimp with a mango salsa, chipotle aioli, and served on jicama in the shape of tiny soft tortillas - dusted with spice and accented with lemon.  What a burst of flavors on your tongue - like all of the colors in the restaurant had re-emerged as tastes.  We ordered 3 servings of this dish!\n\nPistachio-encrusted Salmon - absolutely delicious - tender salmon with a nice crust, served in triangular wedges and drizzled with a wasabi cream sauce for an unexpected bite.  Another favorite.\n\nHuitlacoche and ricotta-stuffed Dumplings - okay, I confess that I don't understand what huitlacoche is exactly - Wikipedia defines it as corn smut (doesn't that sound wonderfully dirty?) - I think it may be a fungus, or something...they call it the Mexican truffle - anyway, cooked into a dumpling with ricotta cheese, it's one tasty bit of smut.  And who doesn't like tasty smut??\n\nArugula and Radicchio salad - with dried cherries, feta, and an orange muscat vinaigrette - solid salad, nice compliment to the more rich foods.\n\nThree Meat Bites - I was initially confused by the description of this dish - it's 3 meats (lamb, beef, bacon), combined into 3 mini-burger patties and served on 3 slices of bread.  Each bite contains all 3, they are not 3 different bites.  That said, yum!  The mushroom sauce on the top is scrumptious, do not miss a drop.\n\nCharcoal-Grilled Mahi Mahi - tender fish, very interesting slightly smoky sauce, and served with mixed greens with slivers of tropical fruit - light and satisfying.\n\nDuck Confit - interesting way to serve this dish, do-it-yourself style with mini tortillas and a sweet/spicy sauce.\n\nDessert was good, especially the cheesecake, but I think that they really excel the savory dishes here.  Wine is reasonably priced, and they can make a recommendation for you.\n\nNo reservations accepted, but we got a table for 5 very easily at 9pm on a Thursday night.  They also have a bar in the back where I would definitely sit with a friend to have a glass of wine and a few plates of food if the tables were full.  Fun for a large party or small group, good for a date if you don't mind a slightly boisterous atmosphere.  It's more buttoned-up than you might expect for a restaurant that is only a few months old, and they work hard to make sure you have a great experience - which we certainly did.\n\nI'll be back soon!", "author": "Liz S."}

The gentleman that seated us was EXTREMELY kind and friendly and immediately brought over our drinks after we ordered them.

We got the ceviche first, which was delicious and had the best chips! Then we got the Taco Tacon with the seared tuna which was definitely my favorite. Then we had the carnitas, which my boyfriend loved (I'm not a huge fan of carnitas, but they were still very good)\n\nMy wine was great, the free bread and dipping sauce was amazing.

The mushroom sauce was so freaky good, though. \n\nThe bathroom had a wave machine sound that was really relaxing, but I felt that the wallpaper was a bit contrived.\n\nAnd on the overall decor of the place (I'm probably going to catch heat for this...) but I felt it was overly done. The placement of all the forks on the wall was a bit overly so. The mirror birds were in their PERFECT place. It was a bit too much, at least in my opinion. It wasn't offensive, it just ended up lacking warmth in the delivery.\n\nThe staff is superb. They're all knowledgeable and well-spoken and don't make fun of me for pronouncing Huitlacoche \"weetlacoshe\" rather than \"Hooweetlacoechay.\" What can I say, who's ever heard of that? \n\nI do like the fact that although they don't take reservations, you can put your name in and go and sit at the Cafe Revolution down the street, and they'll call you when your table's ready. More restaurants without bars should adopt this practice.\n\nI'm glad I tried it out, and I think this restaurant will do fine, but overall it's just not really my bag.", "author": "Rachel F."}

For a restaurant that has been open for only slightly more than a week, they are very well put-together and things were running quite smoothly.\n\nLovely and adorable decour.  Fashionable/funky/fun cushions on the boothy looking chairs.  The kind of furniture I wish I had in my own house, but know I lack the vision to spot it and make it work.  Even the bathroom was so cute!  Low, flickering lighting that seemed to get dimmer as the night wore on.  Ambient background music that almost was overbearing, but never quite crossed that line.\n\nThe food is deliciousness-incarnate.  We shared four dishes: panko-encrusted shrimp \"tacos\", octopus carpaccio, pan-seared scallops, and fried calamari.  In an effort to limit my verbosity, I will just say everything was tasty and flavourful and zesty and scrumptious (How's that for concise...?).  My favourite was the shrimp, which in addition to those adjectives, was also spicy and crunchy and refreshing and Good.  **But all the dishes were sauced plentifully, perfect for bread-dipping after the meat was eaten up!  And you better believe that I was dipping up until the moment the plates were wrenched from my grasp.  Good foresight on the part of the waitress - it would be unsightly to have the crazy girl in the corner, licking the last remaining drops of citrus sauce and scallop remnants from their classy, yet hip, white, square plate.\n\nAlso...  Excellent roasted tomato/basil/goat cheese spread to go with the bread.  You better believe that I'm going to try to make this myself.  And they were kind (and non-judgmental) enough to keep the bread coming and not recoil at my gluttony, even after the second time I asked for more bread.  And lovely dessert - dulce de cacao (or caffe...  can't quite remember) with chocolate-covered espresso beans at the bottom.  One bite, and I was reeled in.\n\nI must say that the service was effective and very gracious.  They tolerated, maybe even welcomed (?), my fickle eating habits.  More than once (ok, upwards of 4 times?), my inner greedy girl wrenched a clearly finished plate/glass from the waitress, because it wasn't finished to *my* satisfaction.  But they never made me feel like the obnoxious child I know I am.  \n\nI very much enjoyed my dining experience, and hope to return often, with friends in tow.", "author": "Jess M."}

We had a lovely ladies dinner, starting the evening with drinks at Beretta and dinner at Lolo.  So by the time we arrived we were properly lubricated.  The lubrication, however, did not succeed in coating my tastebuds, at least not enough for the food to really past muster for me.\n\nThe star of the evening was easily the shrimp tacos, they were crispy and crunchy, yumm.  The rest of the meal sort of lost me.  We had the fried salmon, zuccini cakes, filet mignon and duck confit do it yourself tacos. The salmon was, well too fried to really enjoy the fish.  The filet was coated in a sauce that I couldn't identify, but my companions asserted that it was citrus based. Again, I really didn't enjoy the sauce, I thought it overpowered what was a nice cut of meat.  I will note that the rest of the crowd enjoyed that dish.  The duck confit tacos were so bad that no one ate them, while aware of the fact that a confit is essentially flopping around in fat for days...we didn't expect it to be sooo fatty that three washes of wine still wouldn't remove the taste from my mouth.  Zuccini cakes, very average, too much dressing on top .\n\nOn the bright side, they fit a large group in with a call the day before, the waiter was charming and attentive and the wine list was perfect for the $$ and the vibe of the restaurant. All in all and average eating experience in a cool, kitchy decor.  I would recommend this place for larger groups really set on the tapas style meal and wanting a foray into the Mission, but I wouldn't send your visiting gourmet.", "author": "Claire C."}

Provide mole dipping sauce for the fries with a flavor that's so subtle, it's overpowered by the fries.  So the lettuce and tomato salad was decent, but that's not hard.\n\nOne enthusiastic star for the funky decor.  I love it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-01-09", "description": "After reading all of the positively glowing reviews for this place, I was astonished at how much I really didn't like it.\n\nFor a new place, not having a sign out front was especially annoying. The \"recycled\" motif--which has questionable attractiveness for someplace where I want to EAT--was hit or miss. The second room, with the large green-framed mirrors against a wallpaper of newpaper, was kitschy and had a nice pop art feel to it. However, framing the wall next to it with rubber boot soles was creepy and offputting. In fact, a lot of the stuff gave the place a sort of cheap and fifth-grade-crafts-project look. \n\nHere's how I'd express it mathematically:\n\n(Nameless Storefront + Shopping Bag Wallpaper) X $12 small plates  = Pretentious.\n\nBut I could deal with that. Hey, it's the Mission and we're supposed to be hip, right? I'll push my emo hair to the side and dive in to the food.\n\nHere's where the stars really fall off. Pretty much everything we ordered was either highly unpalatable or just really poorly executed. I should've known we were in trouble when our bread arrived way too hot and dried out. The calamari plate was the worst offender; without the green salsa-like dipping sauce slathered on it (completely blocking the taste of the calamari itself), it was totally inedible. (I do have to say our server was very polite when she saw we had barely touched it and took it off our bill without any fuss.)\n\nThe salmon small plate was drenched in wasabi sauce and glaze that totally clashed, and the pistaschio \"crust\" was more clumps of ground nuts. The only almost-winning entree was the three meat bites, which was really all three meats ground into small patties. However, they were served over some sort of aioli that made the bread they were served on soggy. Our last selection, two zucchini patties, looked, well, recycled. At least they were keeping with their theme.\n\nThey get two stars for the very attentive and friendly staff. But the food was just terrible.", "author": "Aaron L."}

The first thing you notice about the place is the decor... kind of kitschy and unique.  I definitely dug the ambiance.  \nSo here's what I thought of the food we ordered... mind you these were small plates so they were meant to share.\n\n1.  Shrimp tacos - a friend of mine recommended them to me.  They were friggin awesome... the flavors danced all around my mouth and the delightfully crunchy coating of the shrimp was amazing.  I highly recommend this.\n\n2.  Sqaush blossoms - quite possibly the worst dish we ordered.  Talk about too much flavors... it was as if someone couldn't make up their mind and unloaded too much feta and cumin into my mouth.  Steer clear of this dish.\n\n3.  Octopus carpacchio - another less than stellar dish... the octopus was so thinly sliced I thought there was nothing on the plate at first.  Again, too much cumin which I thought overpowered the dish.\n\nFor our \"share more\" plate we got the mahi mahi.  I was super excited about this but would only give this an A-OK rating.  The highlight for me was the mango and papaya underneath the greens.  The fish was ok... nothing to remember.\n\nWe got the fondue which was great... I mean who wouldn't love blueberries, raspberries and banana bread dipped into warm dark chocolate?\n\nSo why the 3-stars?  I think this place has a lot of potential... the shrimp tacos rocked my world.  Next time I go, I'll try other dishes...hopefully the cumin won't be on everything or I'll downgrade my rating.\n\nThe total bill for the dishes and a $40 bottle of pinot noir was $103.", "author": "Clifton T."}

I wasn't too excited about the menu at first glance and the alcohol selection was limited to wine-only, but I found a Malbec that looked promising and we ordered five appetizers and two entrees.  \n\nThe zucchini cakes..some would say had a delicate flavor-- but I say they were bland and boring.  The octopus was paper thin and drenched in oil and did not look appetizing at all.  The beet salad and side of radish that was soaked in something looked great.  I enjoyed the fried shrimp mini tacos the best because they were packed with flavor and had a good amount of spice, although they were a bit hard to eat and we only got two shrimp for $7, hmmm...  \n\nThe Three Meat Bites were deceiving as the menu described an entree comprised of \"lamb, beef, and bacon\" but when they arrived, they were little ground meat patty burgers served with bread.  Now at that point, I really didn't care what they tasted like--that's just false advertising.  My favorite dish of the night was the grilled porkchop with asparagus drizzled with a balsamic based glaze.  The porkchop was good-sized, moist, and flavorful.  Very nice.  And last but not least, we ordered the sorbet trio for dessert and I have to say that the strawberry basil sorbet was divine...\n\nSo I was impressed by the cuteness of the decor and the artistic presentation of all the dishes but the menu and the flavors of quite a few dishes need a little work in my opinion.

It did the job with perfection.\n\nI had a glass of the rose, which was fantastic. We ordered the Taco Tropical. They were mini shrimp tacos, lightly fried with a mango chutney. Instead of being served on a tortilla, they used a thinly sliced piece of jicama. Genius - hats off to you! We also had the mushroom ricotta dumplings.

Both of us are experimental eaters, so I had ordered the beef tongue which was completely overwhelmed by a very peppery sauce that didn't seem to have anything to do with the meat. A similar scenario presented itself with the duck, only that in this case the duck was cooked to the point that it might as well have been beef, or maybe fried potatoes for that matter.\n\nSo what's a guy supposed to say?\n\nUber kool decor?

Great waitstaff and solid food.   Did anything wow me?  Not this time, although my friend loved her shrimp tacos.  Everything is plated really well, and everything looks gorgeous but, as is often the case when the presentation is 'ON', portions are kinda  small.  You might leave a little hungry. . .\n\nHmmm, one of the reviewers below stated, \"It's all about the Huitlacoche.\"  Can't agree there. Granted, the word sure is fun to say, and I went in with trying this appetizer at the top of my list.  But it was  actually kind of under-whelming.  Not bad, in fact it had a quite nice, smooth, mild mouthfeel but. . . it lacked any kind of dominant flavor.  a  Kick.  Something.  It's called Huitlacoche for pete's sake.  .  Maybe I felt let down because my expectations were for rockets going off when I tasted these oddly blue little fritters.  If you crave mild you'll probably be quite happy with them.  But it's hard to imagine them as being the highlight of the meal.  sigh... Huitlacoche,.. it sure is fun to say.\n\nHad the steak as an entree and it was cooked perfectly, marinated in something wonderful.  Side of fries?  Eh.  They were quite pretty, fancifully cut shavings that piled beautifully on the plate but again I was hoping for something with a bit more acid on the side. . . not a criticism of the restaurant by anymeans, next time I'll just try some of the other offerings on the menu.\n\nand really, a fun spot.

I've had tapas at Cascal and in some places in San Jos\u00e9, but this is by far the best I've had thus far.  I was curious as to why some people had given Lolo some low ratings, and my deduction is that it's a bias of taste.\n\nI personally love spices.  I like my octopus dusted with hot spices.  I forgave the overabundance of oil, but the meat was perfect: not too chewy, not too limp.  \n\nThe duck confit was missing something in my opinion.  I think it needed a kick of some spice or a sweeter earthy flavor.\n\nThe prawns were delectable and perfectly grilled.  I personally am not a strong fan of overbearing black olive tapenade, but all I had to do was take if off my prawn before eating it and I was fine.\n\nThe dumplings were pretty good, but I honestly preferred the squash dipping sauce.  (Which by the way, where can I find some good fried, stuffed squash blossoms?)\n\nThe wait staff was amazing.  They were extremely laid-back, but it somehow fit the theme of the restaurant, ya know?  Which, by the way is the complete personification of kitsch: newsprint wallpaper on one wall and the bar top, funky lampshades, cowboy boots on another wall, and rubber soles on yet another flank.  Kitsch.\n\nHaving set at the bar, our 'bartender' was truly the perfect server.  He arrived whenever needed as if he could tell we needed something.  He recommended a great bottle of wine.  He always asked \"May I?\" before clearing away a dish.  He also continued to pour our wine and water as needed.   \n\nYou may walk by this place and not realize what you're passing up, so keep an eye out.

All of the decor comes from re-cycled and re-furbished products.  We sat in the front room with the cozy move able booth type seats covered in Mexican blankets.  The bird mirrors on the wall were cut from old mirrors and I love the can labels on the bathroom door.  At first glance I thought this place only had 3 tables right next to the kitchen, but found a whole nother room with a long bar and more tables.  They also serve their water in tall bottles they leave on your table (nice touch)\n\nI have to admit the group was a bit tipsy on arrival so there are probably more details that would be good to remember but here's what I know.\n\nBread served with a tasty sun dried tomato sauce.  We tried the dumplings, the shrimp tacos in a jicama shell, the octopus and the heirloom tomatoes with goat cheese.  All of the sauces they use here are very unique.  I didn't try the octopus, but everything else was tasty.\n\nFor dinner, I had the scallop appetizer - there were only 2 so don't have it for dinner if you didn't have other stuff to eat too.  Others at the table got the flank steak with shoestring type potatoes, salad, halibut in a spicy sauce and something else I'm forgetting.  The sauce for the steak was interesting - mole made with peaches and strawberries - seemed a bit better for the potatoes vs the steak.  The halibut sauce had a lot of kick, but it didn't necessarily bring out the halibut flavor.  \n\nThe ideas are a great and as with any new place - they are working out the kinks and improving as they go along.  Since they get a lot of food locally, their menu will vary depending on what they get - good concept to keep things fresh.\n\nFor dessert we tried both - can't remember the names - one was like an espresso tiramisu and the other was a light refreshing mousse like cake.  Both were tasty.\n\nLastly - they are not trying to be pretentious - it's the mission - who does that.  With wine and beer and all our appetizers, it was only $40/per person.  Not bad for a last minute dinner for 8.  \n\nThings to note:  they don't take reservations, they only serve beer and wine, go with a few people so you can try a bunch of things.", "author": "Mabelle A."}

Went here during a recent rise in temperature and the heat had my appetite waxing and waning. Luckily, I was in lovely company who shared my lack of decision making skills. \n\nLolo is great for people like us. Small plates work well when you can't commit to a full dish and would rather sample a variety of what a place has to offer. When we first entered, we were greeted by a chef in the kitchen and a little perplexed as to what the seating arrangement would entail. Quickly, we were then approached by a waitress who brought us back to a room, ornate with a kaleidoscope of colorful visual interest. \n\nEverything on the menu sounded appetizing. Because we weren't particularly ravenous, we decided on a shrimp dish, some scallops and a lovely hunk of brie that my companion described rather eloquently as a \"gourmet mozzarella stick\"  that was fried and deliciously oozing onto supplied bread. \n\nThe waitress was extremely patient and answered all of our questions, helped with recommendations and helped us narrow down the wine list. \n\nThis place is relatively new and they are still working out the kinks on the timing, but the food came out quickly and we were checked on appropriately, but not overbearingly. \n\nIf you order nothing else, do yourself a favor and try the shrimp. Frankly, I would eat my left arm if it were to be flash fried and encrusted in panko and served with a smoky chipotle aioli, but Lolo saved my anatomical symmetry by providing a lovely alternative to cannibalism. \n\nScallops were well done, but could have maybe used a little something, although they came after the marvelous shrimp and my taste buds were probably still relishing in the sauce. \n\nDetails are important and the bill came in an adorable Saint Bernard dog book. Thank you for sparing the monotony of another black receipt book, Lolo.

It's reasonably cheap, Latin-American fusion-fabulous; and boasts both a funky decor and cool servers.\n\nEasily the best dish we tried was panko-crusted shrimp, served with a delicious chipotle-chili aoili, mango salsa, and a squeeze of lemon over a crunchy slice of jicama. There was a lot going on, all of it good. \n\nI'd also recommend the chorizo-stuffed dates (truly a marriage of the Turkish and Mexican owners): it works perfectly. Unlike when stuffed with cheese or marzipan, the dates here are mellow and not too sweet, and the chorizo was delicious. \n\nI didn't particularly care for the radicchio and arugula salad; the radicchio made the salad too bitter (it's often better cooked), and overshadowed the more delicate flavors of dried cherries, goat and feta cheeses. It was also under-dressed. \n\nWine selections are decent; although with what we ordered the young syrah was not an ideal choice. \n\nAnd one small suggestion for the house: change that black bean puree you're serving the bread with. It lacks visual appeal or enough flavor to whet your appetite. Butter or olive oil would be a better choice.

It's happened each time I went. \n\nThe problem is not that the plates are VERY small for the price.  That by itself is not a problem.  I actually prefer smaller plates if the quality is higher and at LoLo the quality is indeed high.  The problem is that when you serve VERY small plates to groups, your servers need to be proactive and make sure there is enough to go around.  I don't mean \"enough food so everyone is full\"  (although, yes, that should be part of policy too).. I mean \"enough portions in a dish so everyone can taste it\".\n\nDuring this last trip, we were a group of 6 and ordered the beef skewers. \n\nThe first problem is that a customer can't tell the meat is going to be marble sized as the word skewer gives an image of hunks of meat.  Use a different word. Or make up a word.  Or just make sure your server explains it's not your typical Turkish kabob.\n\nThe second, and my main, problem is that it only comes with 5 of them.  In a small plate restaurant, if your server can see there are 6 of us, why not upsell an extra pro-rated skewer to us?  Just say \"that comes with 5, should I bring 6?\"  We're happier cause we don't need to split up what are already small portions, and you get more $.  All the servers at the best small plate restaurants, like Slanted Door and EOS, do this religiously.\n\nIt's a win-win for everyone.  Please make this policy among your servers.", "author": "Chris W."}

The Taco Tropical (shrimp tacos) not only looked pretty, but damn it was so freaking tasty!  Grilled shrimp w/ fresh ingredients wrapped in a thin slice of jicama...to die for! I think I could eat 6 of these to myself. Such a great balance of texture, sour, salty and just a hint of spicy. We also shared the pecan encrusted salmon and the pork, which were both cooked to perfection and plated very beautifully.  Being we shared everything, I actually had room for dessert and had the cheesecake...the best I've ever had!\n\nI called last minute for an 8:00 reservation and they were able to accomodate us on a Tuesday evening. I've walked by this place several times on a weekend night and it's always packed with people out the door.  \n\nThe decor was very charming...but the seating arrangements are a bit cramped.

Not only was the food bright and tasty, but the decor was really creative which made the restaurant even more appetizing.  I felt like I was in Latin America with a NYC flare.  Let's not forget the bathroom.  Be sure to spend a moment in there as you wash up and and your auditory senses become surrounded by crashing waves on the beach.  \n\nThe food:  The halibut dish was out of this world and so tasty that I couldn't help but to eat every morsel slowly while staring at the brightly colored arrangement on my plate.  Even though the portions were not huge, I left feeling satisfied and not over-stuffed.  Sadly, they were out of the duck confit, which for a Saturday night, I found rather odd.  But I can't complain because we didn't have reservations and were seated immediately.  We also tried the hoitloche dumplings (ravioli filled corn fungus type thing) which is a delicacy in Mexico.  It was simple and light, but it could've used a bit more flavor.\n\nOthers mentioned the wine list being pricey, but honestly, I found it to be on the average side in comparison to restaurants around the city.\n\nThe staff was knowledgeable and our waitress was helpful.  We skipped the desert, but it sure sounded delectable.  \n\nThis place is a must try!  Check it out for yourself.", "author": "Alyssa L."}

Nice bar as well for drinks and appies or to eat at.\n\nBeing from SD my bf and I hold a very special and distinct view of real Mexican cuisine. This by far is the best fancy Mexican spot we have food up here. The Huitlacoche and ricotta-stuffed Dumplings are the single best appie I have found. It is a fungus that grows on corn so kinda like a Mexican corn truffle. It was a such a great new and unique ingredient I wish it was in everything! I also loved loved loved the duck confit tacos.\n\nAlso they have a great bubbly syrah which I have not see on too many menus outside of Napa.

I'd been waiting a while to try Lolo, having heard a lot of good buzz around the place, and it is GOOD, but here are my complaints:\n\n1.  The service was moving us through the meal at lightning speed.  I'm sorry, but if I'm going to pay this amount of money, I want to savor the meal and find it in very poor form to receive my main while I'm still finishing my appetizer.  Having finished our mains, and with still a half bottle of wine to get through, the waitress tried to get us to order our dessert.  Um, I don't think so.  \n\n2.  With service moving that fast, much of the food has to be par cooked to get it out to the table to quickly.  It's a restaurant, they have to do their \"mis en place\", I get it.  However, part of the problem with par cooking seafood is the tendency to have it sitting under the heater, staying warm, and inevitably being overcooked.  The halibut I ordered, while surrounded with  delicious tangy and fruity flavors, was totally dried up.  Not acceptable.\n\nHaving said all that, I would still go back to Lolo:\n\n1.  Love the ambiance, decor and atmosphere\n2.  Our appetizers were fantastic (ravioli filled with this corn fungus and a shrimp on tortilla concoction were both really good).\n3.  Excellent wine advice and selection\n4.  The portions were great (people, please stop associating price and quality with receiving a feed bucket worth of food)\n5.  Dessert was amazing (quince and mascarpone terrine and espresso bean, tiramisu, chocolate mousse were sublime).\n\nMy advice is to be wary of the seafood main courses, unless you're into dried up, chewy fish (in which case, go for it!) and avoid ordering your main course until you've finished your appetizer.  And with that in mind, sit back and enjoy.", "author": "Laura K."}

I read the reviews on yelp and was skeptical when I read the description of the cuisine to be such a mumbo-jumbo of nationalities, but this also attracted me more to the restaurant. Not surprisingly, all the of the tables for 7pm were reserved when I called around 4:30, but we got seats at the bar as we walked in (at 7:30 on a Saturday night).\n\nThe decor is very nice. I was expecting more of a Front Porch-like atmosphere from the descriptions, but even though there are a lot of tchotckies on the walls, the room still manages to be clean and crisp, just with lots of colors... \nThe food and service were both really great. The panko-crusted shrimp in jicama \"taco shell\" was definitely the best item of the night, but all of the other dishes deserve all the stars I've given it.  Naturally, when speaking to the owner I *had* to bring up the use of jicama as taco shells on Top Chef and he said that his chef has been doing this for the last three years.

If I could give half stars, I'd give Lolo a 3.5. Here's what we had.\n \nOctopus Tiradito - Very interesting. It was as if a whole octopus was pressed into a ball and then was very thinly sliced and drenched in oil, salt and spices, and topped with a spicy mayo (think mayo & sriracha). It was unique and flavorful, but a bit too salty and definitely too oily in my opinion. Eating it in combination with the bread was a must.\n\nHuitlacoche (Corn Truffles) and Ricotta Dumplings - I was very excited to try these, but honestly, I expected much more out of them. Our server told us that they were \"lightly pan fried\". Perhaps these were fried in a pan, but in my book, lightly pan fried does not mean pan fried in an inch of oil. Not only was I disappointed by the, in my opinion, overly fried aspect of the dumplings, but I found the filling to be bland in flavor, and dipping sauce served alongside didn't do much to make up for it.\n\nDuck confit tacos - These were a little too simple in my opinion, although definitely tasty, and I'm always a big fan of interactive food. The duck confit, corn tortillas, cilantro, and sauce are all served separately and you get to construct your own tacos. I found the duck confit to be on the oily side, but still enjoyable, and likened the pulled-duck meat to a duck \"carnitas\".  \n\nPanko Fried Shrimp Tacos - Although the shrimp were fried, the jicama \"taco\" shell did well in lightening up this dish.

Menu description was: Flash-fried panko-crusted Shrimp, Tropical Salsa, Jicama, Chili Aioli. I mean, sounds pretty plain-Jane, nothing spectacular. Then the plate is served... and it is beyond words. I am salivating thinking about it and writing this...\n\nIt is a thinly sliced piece of jicama, which serves as the \"tortilla\" of the taco. A beautifully, perfectly cooked piece of shrimp is on top, adorned with a perfectly balanced, citrusy mango and pineapple salsa, a small squeeze of chili aioli which provides a little creaminess and spiciness. Served with a pico pico dipped lemon wedge, which when you squeeze it onto your \"taco\" creates the most delicious form of hot sauce. It is love at first bite. \n\nHonestly, it is the most delicious little piece of heaven. We ordered 2 more plates, which in our book, is the true sign of perfection! It is probably the most creative, delicious dish we've had in 2 years. \n\nSecond must have dish: The cheesecake. We ordered it on a whim, and let me say, BEST CHEESECAKE EVER. Even if you think you are full, order it, you will not be disappointed.\n\nWe've had most everything on the menu, but these two items will keep us coming back forever.", "author": "Status K."}

A quirky unpretentious vibe, it's managed well and the food is creative & fun but also well-executed and not too fussy.\n\nI tried to make a reservation online and it didn't work. It was for the next day, for a party of 8. I left a message. They called me back the next morning saying it would be no problem. When we got there, all was ready.\n\nThe food was AMAZING. the pistachio crusted salmon and the shrimp tacos especially. The zucchini cakes were heavy but toothsome and good. The endive and halloumi salad was sublime (but small). I don't eat other meats than fish but the meat-eaters liked their things too. the desserts were also stellar (oh, the trifle! and some kind of bread pudding thingy? I can't even remember), and the coffee was great. \nThe turkish/mexican thing works quite well though I wouldn't have thought so.\n\nit's not cheap, and the servings aren't huge, but i t's manageable. I would rather go here on a special occasion than somewhere more fancyschmancy, but that's how I roll. I like the whimsical design and the laid-back atmosphere.  \n\nI normally don't say much about service, but these guys deserve extra praise for handling our table. A couple of our guests were perhaps not such gourmets, and weirded out by the seared salmon that was raw in the middle. They sent it back asking for it to be cooked through, which the server and the chef did without any attitude, perfectly cheerfully. I know that it's meant to be raw in the middle, but I appreciated that in the moment the customer deserve the best experience possible, even if it doesn't accord with the chef's vision. Big praise to them for handling it in such a laid-back and nice manner. Also the chef managed without overcooking it - the salmon was still nice and juicy!\n\nI also liked that the owner or manager had a Mad Professor shirt on - now if only they would give me a discount if I made them a dub mixtape..", "author": "La M."}

The 22nd street corridor is arguably cooler than 16th and Valencia. Plenty of hip restaurants, bars, other shops and less bratty hipsters.  The only critiques would be a full liquor license, more space (tables were jammed in) and our server kinda rushed us a bit although there were empty tables there...\nBottom line: damn tasty food, ambiance, reasonably priced and a hop, skip and a jump to other mission nightlife such as medjool, brunos yada yada.\nIf you ain't gettin' some after taking your date there you need to talk less and eat more.", "author": "G K."}

I was also a little annoyed with how much effort they put into trying to turn over our table. I appreciate good service, but being practically carried out the door is not helpful.

Highly recommended.\n\nI've eaten here two times, both times with a group of about 6 people.\n\nBoth times, all the people at the table expressed great satisfaction with the food and the entire experience. \n\nAll told, between the two occasions, we sampled the shrimp, the octopus tiradito, the seafood ceviche (ceviche mirasol), the huitlacoche, Turkish style meat skewers with sumac, the lamb slider,  brussels sprouts, seafood tacos (tacos tropical), pistachio-encrusted salmon, roasted beets, and probably more things that I can't recall. ( A number of the dishes reminded me of Peruvian food.) Also had a Malbec wine. (They were out of the requested variety of Shiraz, but no biggie.)\n\nYour best bet is probably to get 2 of the smaller dishes so you can sample more of the menu without overdoing it. (note: the octopus tiradito is fabulous, but probably the tiniest amount of food of any of the dishes, so keep that in mind when ordering)", "author": "Paula M."}

I die for the octopus starter, thinly sliced, nicely seasoned and splattered with red mystery sauce. You will die too.\n\nEverything we have tried has been tasty and fresh, always with some nice inventive twist - it's Mexican-Turkish fusion don't-you-know - and you can get a decent steak which can be tricky in this neck of the woods (unless you like your steak chopped up, fried in grease and put in a burrito).\n\nThe atmosphere and decor is cool but unpretentious. We seem to get the same charming waiter who attentive but unobtrusive and always remembers us. The house red is kick ass. They play background music that isn't coffee table jizztronica. Plus the restroom is cosy. And the bar areas is laminated with endless columns of numbers so you can pretend you are well arty / viewing the world as math / living in a world gone mad.\n\nYou'll get the most out of the menu if you're in a group and can share several dishes around, rather than, you know, just ordering a big baked brie for your cheese-hungry little self. They call starters 'share' and mains 'share more' just so you get the idea. But it's not the place to come when you want to gorge on food without worrying about cost. (That said, it's reasonably priced compared to some of the wannabe restaurants in the area.)\n\nAnyway, the pain of paying is eased by some post-dinner amusement when your check arrives inside an old book about dogs covered in my hilarious graffiti. Don't get your hopes up too high: you might get one of the many other dog books knocking around with someone else's super lame graffiti inside. Accept no substitutes.

Oh, and the food! The food here comes with layers of flavors (which make you want to pause to analyze)! My dinner companion and I were going mmmmmm~~~ for two hours straight with huge grins on our faces. \n\nWe had their octopus appetizer and venison carpaccio to start. The octopus came with very strong seasoning and was interesting and entertaining, but I would not order it again (I personally prefer my shellfish with subtle seasoning).  The venison carpaccio was quite amazing, definitely one of the kind. I enjoyed every bite of it and look forward to the next time I get to eat it again. For entrees, I had the porkchop with bluecheese on top, which went PERFECTLY with a glass of Malbec. There's something to be said about the hunk of meat, blue cheese, and Malbec combination. My companion had the duck confit, which was very savory with a kick of citrus flavor. Lastly, but certainly not least importantly, the tiramisu was a total WOW...the tiramisu at Lolo comes in a very non-descript coffee cup (very retro, the type you'd find at a yard sale), which is very non-threatening, low-maintenance looking. Just wait until you take a bite or two of this piece of heaven...the combination of the dark chocolate, rich mouse, wet sponge cake, and the crunchy chocolate-covered espresso beans totally killed!!!!!! BAM!!! Unlike a lot of American desert, this one is not overly sweet, thereby allowing every constituent to perform at its best. I LOVED IT!!!\n\nI am definitely going back.", "author": "Nana N."}

The service was excellent and they were always available, brought out food quickly and they didn't rush us at all as we sat after dinner just chatting.\n\nWe got two appetizers, the shrimp and the veggies.

The veggies were pretty good.\nwe got the tongue and the the mahi mahi but we shared. The tongue was sooo soft and tender and the curry sauce it came cooked in was delish.

The ingredients are all good and the combinations are often excellent.  The grass fed sirloin in a strawberry/mango mole was rich and flavorful and the beef was much more tender than the average grass fed beef.  There was a tomato salad that was really a deconstructed Greek salad that was very good but marred by an overly strong feta cheese.  The gyozas were had a wonderful flavor and a nice pepper sauce, even if the wrappers were a bit gummy.\n\nOn my second vist I had an excellent yucatan duck  dish that was served mushu style (though the wrappers served in a bamboo dim sum container were corn tortillas -- I am not complaining, I was just surprised).  The pistachio crusted salmon was also very tasty.\n\nThe decor is right out of a Pedro Almodovar flick.  Bright and flashy with an edge of 70's funk.\n\nService is friendly though still learning its way around.\n\nPrices range for about $6 for smaller platers to $18 to the meaty plates.\n\nThe wine list is a bit odd.

Eclectic, funky, delicious. Huitlacoche and ricotta dumplings were great. There was a salad with dried cherries and goat cheese that was -perfect-, just the right balance of everything. Good wine list - so many restaurants fail to put appropriate wines on their list to match their cuisine. Among their many by-the-glass varietals, Lolo offered both a Gewurtzraminer and an Alsatian Riesling, the latter of which paired excellently with some of the bold spices.\n\nWe ate at the bar and had a wonderful time, would definitely go back.\n\nThe decor was definitely fun - toeing the line between \"hip\" and \"an eyesore\" but still certainly the former.", "author": "Greg S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-06-22", "description": "I had a very enjoyable dinner here the other night.\n\nI must admit I was skeptical when my sister suggested we try a fusion restaurant.  I generally think of fusion as an excuse to sneak mango in things it has no business being included in.  But our meal was delicious and innovative rather than the soulless cleverness I was dreading.\n\nLolo is a cute and interesting space.  The decor is what I call \"Mission Funky\" which is generally characterized by a bright or over-saturated color palette, kitschy accents, and visual wit achieved either through using traditional objects of decoration in a non-traditional fashion or by using items not typically used in decoration in a function of traditional decorating (commonly known as \"random junk glued on the walls\").\n\nBetween the concept and the decor, this place balances on the precipice of being smug and pretentious, however our waitress was welcoming and attentive.  She made some great suggestions and made sure we were well taken care of without hovering.\n\nThe food also stands up to the delicious test.  We ordered three small plates; my sister is a vegetarian so I got the plate of famous shrimp tacos all to myself.  The flavors were really well balanced-the shrimps were meaty, the tropical salsa was sweet and tangy, the chipotle sauce was creamy and spicy and the jicama was crisp and clean.  It made sense, which I think is why I'm not upset about the possibility that there was some mango in there.  It was a dish that I had never had before, never even thought of before, but once I had it I was like \"oh why doesn't everybody make these\"  We also had the beets which came with a salty feta mousse and a sweet and bitter grilled raddichio.  The elements of that plate were all a little much by themselves, but once you gathered them all together in a single bite, they were delicious.  Our last plate was the huitlacoche dumplings.  I would describe them as crispy airy wontons with smooth and creamy filling.  I had never had huitlacoche before but it tastes like a mushroom and an ear of corn had a little tasty baby.  It came with a squash blossom sauce that didn't really add anything or taste like much.  The sauce wasn't bad, just unnecessary.\n\nFor dessert: chocolate fondue.  The dessert that needs no elaboration.\n\nI would love to go back and try more of the meat and seafood dishes.", "author": "Flemm F."}

I could eat a dozen of the shrimp jicama tacos.  Deeelish!  I appreciated that the waiter let us order a half order so that my party of 5 could each have their own taco.  Our grilled octopus dish was very tender.  The two dishes that I didn't enjoy as much were the flank steak (boring) and the duck soft tacos (I coudn't tell that it was duck.  tasted just like pork carnitas).  The cheesecake was fantastic.

We had scallops, squash flower dumplings, feta mousse, and prawns.  It was all quite decent and definately interesting.  My wine was out of control good.  I had me a nice glass of Malbec and after my first sip I uttered (louder than intended) a suprised \"holy shit.\" Our amazing waitress felt compleled to stop by and make sure that it wasn't in disgust.\n\nWhat's really important is that this place is the perfect addition to the ever evolving block of 22nd between Mission and Valencia.  The funky, vinyl booths on the sidewalk invite the curious passerby to stop by for a bite.  Lolo and that place that has come to be known as Papa Toby's something or other make perfect neighbors.  The inside of Lolo is perfect dinner time eye candy with repititous walls of spoons, mirrors and newsprint.  It's hard to get bored in this place.  It's the coolest looking spot in town and I can't imagine that they dropped more than $1000 on decorating.\n\nTake your next date to 22nd street.  Dinner at Lolo will please.  Enjoy a pint on the sidewalk at Papa Toby's Revolution Art House Sidewalk Bar Sangria Cafe or the Latin American Club.  You could catch a live show or a good episode of Mortified at the Make Out Room.  And when it's all over but you're yearning for a little more time together you could figure out how to scale the Sketchers building and shoot paintballs at the bank.  Then make out a little, fall asleep and wake up for breakfast at Boogaloos.  I promise this will get you married.", "author": "Kimbra S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-02-07", "description": "I ate here last night.  I was looking for a bistro-ey type of place: Decent wine, smallish plates of better than average food, but not a zillion dollars.  \n\nI go here, and am delivered just this.  Got a decent bottle of wine, and then the fried shrimp app was recommended by the bartender, and true to form, it was amazing.  They used sliced jicama as a tortilla substitute!  I liked the creativity right away.  \n\nOne entree was flank steak in a strawberry/peach mole.  Very cool!  Tasty, too.  BUT, it should have been on the appetizer side.  It was small, and overpriced.  I'll pay more for a better cut any day, but plain and simply overpriced.  No biggy!\n\nThe next entree was the seafood stew dish.  It was 5 mussels, some mini-scallops, some Mahi, and some rameny looking noodles.  The broth had almost no flavor itself.  The serving dish was awkward - a mini pot with vertical walls.  Bad usability on the dish front.  Cute and clever, but gimme a bowl so I can get my utensil in there.\n\nDessert was the cheesecake, which ruled.  \n\nService was terrific, decor not my style but interesting enough, and it was what I was looking for.

I have been painfully disappointed of late but Lolo's wears an aureole in the crowd of overpriced, bland food.  The playful, yet somehow refined, decor should be discovered on your own, but it is guaranteed to embrace you in a warm hug of home-y warmth.  A fusion of the cuisines of two friends' homelands' - Turkey & Spain - each dish seemed rather to be from a new dimension.  At the end of each bite, almost too overwhelmed with delight,  we were presented with another tapa-like dish.  Each one presented with a (proclaimed by me) japanese style and detail of presentation & producing unimitable flavors and sensations.  After each dish, when the four of us could not possibly expect to be impressed by the next, and feared disappointment! . . . the next would amaze! tantalize! Surprise! Immerse each person in a stuppor of pure enjoyment.  Superb cuisine does not take a master to recognize - it is nice to see Lolo's hold themselves to the highest standard for anyone who takes the time to take a taste.  \nThough thoroughly satisfied we listened to the desert menu and promptly ordered two - which one was best, you ask?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-05-16", "description": "We were looking for a place to eat on a Friday night.  Most places were already booked with no reservations available.  We didn't want to just walk in and risk waiting hours for a table.  Did a quick search on yelp and found Lolo - many positive reviews and enticing menu.  I gave them a call and they had something available at 8pm for party of 3 - awesome!  The restaurant was small but cozy with lots of great, bold colors.  Lolo is a tapas place with with a Latin American feel.  Everything on the menu looked so delicious, we had a hard time deciding what to get.  Thank goodness for small plates - it's my excuse to order lots of food! We must have ordered 7-8 plates to share, along with sangria for everyone.  The first dish that came out was pistachio crusted salmon with wasabi sauce. Wow! What a nice pop of flavor! The pistachio gave the salmon a nice crunchy texture and I love the slight spiciness of the wasabi cream sauce. Then we had the taco tropical which was a taco with panko fried shrimp.  This was delicious as well. I don't remember what kind of sauce was inside the taco but it went nicely with the crispy shrimp.  We also had the tuna wrapped inside a mini quesadilla, duck confit, carnitas, and fried brussel sprouts.  Even though everything was really good, I felt like we ordered too many tacos so the meal felt a little heavy.  I think next time, I will order some ceviche and octopus to balance out the meal a little so it's not tortilla with every dish.  Overall, great experience and delicious flavors.  We all left happy and full.", "author": "Kat M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-01", "description": "Basically I was looking for a cheap(er) dinner with a few good cocktails after a show on Friday so we decided to put our names down for Beretta and see what happened. Well, the place was obviously crazy, and although they first told us the wait was an hour, it ended up being closer to being 1.5 hours. Granted, it was a Friday night and it's hard to gauge when people leave but the minute we stepped inside the place, we were hit with sweat and heat, and it was all over for us.\n\nSo....we went down the street and came across this little place. It is charming. Although I was in a semi-crappy Stoli-ed state and didn't allow myself to be charmed at first, I sat on the upholstered bench outside while my bf went to put us on the list and get some booze to placate me. They brought us our drinks outside, then we were seated within 10 minutes or so.\n\nThe food, I have to say, is really interesting. It is truly a hit or miss though, but the fact that it is so interesting gets this place so many points. We had the shrimp tacos on recommendation from other yelpers and they are really fabulous. The jicama tortilla is crunchy, fresh, light, and goes perfectly with the shrimp insides. The octopus was served in a way I've never seen octopus served, and it was good but slightly overcooked for my tastes, a little salty, with just too much sesame oil. Eating it with bread made it better. Then we had the scallop sope, which was WAY too rich for me. The combination of a super thick corn tortilla with a super rich creamy scallop mixture on top was overwhelming and I could only take two bites before I felt sick. It did look pretty, though. Also, my bf seems to have no problems with it, and ate mine too. The duck confit was flavourful, and I didn't think it was greasy (hey, if you're going to order confit anything it's going to be oily) but it was also the only uninteresting thing we ordered. The shrimp tacos were the highlight. I could eat like 10 of those things.\n\nAnyway the server was really nice and cleared our dishes quickly. the food came out quick (it was 10 after all) but well paced. The bread was dense and warm and soft and the dipping sauce (couldn't figure out what it was) was tasty. The decor is really cute and this place has a lot of personality. The food, maybe a little too much at times. I'll be back for the tacos and to try a few other things, but will likely never order the other three dishes I had again.

The decor is an eclectic mix of retro fabric and mexican kitsch. The service was friendly and casual but all the recommendations were spot on. The shrimp taco in jicama  and the huitlacoche dumplings are an absolute must try. We couldn't stop talking about corn smut all night, but really the flavors were very unique and savory. I wasn't as excited about the Duck confit, it was a little dry and lacked flavor, but the Sopes were delicious and I am excited to go back and try a few more menu options. Oh and the cheese cake which they make in house is some of the best I have ever had, it reminds me of cheesecake my mother would have made if my mother could cook.", "author": "Kai H."}

We had walked by a few months ago on our way to somewhere else and it smelled so good that I made a note that I wanted to try it. We went  at the last minute and managed to get in on a cancelled reservation and got a cute window seat. \nThe server was very nice and cute but a little too busy so it was hard to get his attention later on. Luckily the other staff (manager, a woman who brought out food) were able to smoothly take care of our needs. \nThe food was small plates and we had the mussels and the meatballs. Both were divine! The broth/sauce that the mussels were in was soooooo good, I kept dipping the bread in and felt like I could drink it. \nThe meatballs were in an adorable mini pot with a wooden lid and with a rich, yummy eggplant tomato sauce with cheese, also so good!\nThe red wine was pretty good but served way too warm, we ended up requesting ice cubes to put in our wine glasses. The restaurant itself was pretty warm too; it was a really gorgeous weekend so I thinik they could use some window opening to help air it out a bit. \nI would definitely go back - loved the ambiance, the pace, the coziness and the food.", "author": "Patty W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-03-20", "description": "We planned to do a walk in at Lolo, but it was surprisingly crowded on a Thursday. We almost walked away, but as we passed the second room with the bar in it I noticed some empty barstools, so we went back and asked if we could eat at the bar. Come to find that they had a table for two but the reservation had been a no show. Lucky us! They seated us quickly and got us water and menus right away. It's a charming eclectic room, wild with color and decoration that at first doesn't make sense but it really doesn't need to, because the exuberance is sensible if you want to have a good time. Which we did. \n\nWe ordered a bottle of red from their small list. A very decent Malbec dry and fruity at the same time. Very good. We ordered a few small plates to share. One stood out. One was quite good and one was just ok. First for the stand out dish of the night. It was octopus marinated in vinegar or lemon with a special  turkish spice and salt. It was cut thin like a carpaccio and sprinkled with the other ingredients. The taste was amazing. Tart, salty, earthy, but with none of the tough chewiness one sometimes gets with octopus. Yum. we asked for more bread to mop up the juice.  \n\nThe second dish that gets high marks was a stuffed pepper and zucchini and almonds. For an out of season pepper it was amazingly sweet. It was stuffed with rice that had raisins and spices that went well with it. I don't know if it was intentional but  it was kind of luke cool which was a surprise because it looked like it would be better warmer, what with the rice and all. The zucchini was tender but not over cooked, although it was a bit underseasoned and there was no salt on the table. \n\nThe third dish we kind of expected great things, because we had read on Yelp that it was a stand out. I didn't really think so though. It was the pecan crusted salmon with wasabi cream and pistachios. Sounds good right. Well not so much. The plate comes and the salmon looks perfectly cooked. It was translucent in the center and tender. Great so far, but it was in fact rather tasteless for Salmon(maybe it was farm raised) and the pecan crust did not feature any nutty flavor. I tried dipping it in the sauce but that  didn't help because of the way they did it. It was supposed to be wasabi cream, but it was mostly a lake of soy sauce with wasabi cream squiggles and pistachios floating in it.  I like salt, so had no hesitation about dipping the fish in soy, but it was so overwhelming to that underwhelming piece of salmon that it did no good what so ever. Plus the soy also prevented you from getting any of the wasabi cream or nuts to stick to the fish. A few well place drops of soy on the plate along with the cream and the nuts would have been better, but ultimately the fish is where they really have to bring the quality level up.\n\nThe staff was professional and the service was fast.  If the staff needs to do anything better it's just to check on folks in case they need to ask questions about the food or for more water or for salt on the table, because we had questions, we ran out of water and we  could have used some salt. \n\nI still liked my experience at Lolo a lot and want to go back to try more dishes and enjoy the interesting room.", "author": "claire k."}

Since I live just a few blocks away, I'm always curious about new restaurants in the neighborhood.\n\nWe just ordered a few appetizers. We tried the Octopus carpaccio with cumin and smoked paprika.  This was my favorite out the the three that we tried.  I've had this once before at a Mexican restaurant and this was definitely a better version. It was very flavorful.  Then we had the calamari. I enjoyed the spices, but would have preferred the calamari to be not so fried.  The dipping sauce for this item was great tasting.  Then we had scallops.  I feel for $9.50 we should have gotten at least three, not just two. They were nice and plump but I would have preferred them cooked just a little longer. The sauce for this item was just OK compared to how the other two items tasted.  I should also mention that you're given a wonderful dipping sauce with the bread once you are sit ted.\n\nI will definitely return to this restaurant as I was impressed by the food, I just wish it wasn't so expensive. Or at least I wish that they would have given us more octopus on the plate and 3 scallops instead of just two.\n\nCurrently the menu isn't that extensive, especially for entree selections.  However, I definitely recommend giving this restaurant a try especially if you like your food to have great flavors.\n\nService was good and friendly, but I felt at times that our particular waitress was a little aggressive in trying to get us to purchase more drinks and food.  If we were wealthier, then we would have.\n\nI look forward to returning to this restaurant to try a few more dishes.", "author": "jayne a."}

The flank steak was perfectly cooked with a strawberry/peach mole--mmmmm.   We also shared the duck confit served with torillas and the huitlacoche gyoza.

A friend and I came here after a mixer at around 9:30pm because I was determined to try it out from all the great reviews on Yelp and seeing the menu on Eater SF.  Latin-Turkish fusion?  How can that NOT pique your gastronomic curiosity?  The decor was very shabby-chic, but I loved it.  Lucha libre masks and recycled plastic packages and rice bags adorned the walls.  Very fun and chill environment.  We ordered the Bodrum-style octopus carpaccio (I loved Bodrum when I visited Turkey and just had to order this), the flash-fried Antep pistachio encrusted salmon with wasabi cream sauce and unagi sauce drizzle and the seared scallops with basil aioli and cold citrus fennel sauce.  Yeah, that's the same way I felt when I read those menu items. :)  The waiter convinced us to try the signature dish, the panko-encrusted, spice dusted shrimp flash-fried, topped with a tropical relish wrapped in jicama with Chipotle aioli (think fancy shrimp tacos).  All four of them were pretty damned impressive.  The shrimp tacos were very unique because of the jicama wrap texture.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and the mix of flavors bombarded my mouth with sheer joy.  I highly recommend any and all of the starter dishes.  We also ordered the duck confit with corn tortillas (think duck confit tacos served in a peking duck style set).  I was least impressed by this dish, but it wasn't bad.  I think next time I'll try the flank steak.  We finished off with the lighter of the two dessert options, a marscapone and quince stack that unlike any dessert I've had before, although it took getting used to.

We went here on a Saturday night and got an early seating at 7pm. The place was still fairly empty-ish at that hour but was full by the time we left a couple hours later. When I was waiting for my friends I looked in and was surprised at how tiny it was- only 3 tables and no bar! But then when we got seated I found out there is a larger back room with a bar and about 5-6 more tables. I love the concept behind the decor- all recycled stuff. Very unique but a bit too kitschy for my taste. Anyway- on to the food! I read the yelp reviews before going and knew I had to order the octopus and the huitlacoche (some kind of \"fungus\" as the server described it). We also got the panko crusted shrimp \"tacos\". The tacos and the octopus were yummy! Both were pretty spicy and very flavorful. The huitlacoche-ricotta dumplings were nice but a bit bland. Next we got the salmon in wasabi cream sauce. The salmon was excellent, cooked leaving it just a little rare in the middle (the way I like it) but I couldn't hardly taste any wasabi in the sauce. The brown sweet sauce on the plate it was served on kind of tasted like a sweet teriyaki. Tasty though. Next were the zucchini cakes and the mahi-mahi. The zucchini cakes were tasty, if not a little lacking flavor and salt. They were also room temp., not warm. The mahi-mahi was our least favorite dish, very bland , dry and boring. Normally I wouldn't order this as I find it to always be a boring fish, but one of my dining companions doesn't eat meat so we didn't get to try any of the other yummy meat options on the menu. Our server recommended it so we gave it a try but were disappointed. For dessert we had the avocado-cardamon and olive oil sorbets which were nice and the cheesecake which was really simple and delicious. The service was friendly and our server was very informative and helpful. The prices seem on the cheapish side when you see them on the menu, but after you order a bunch of stuff to share and combine it with wine and dessert, it was a bit steep for this level of restaurant I thought. We each spent $70 (had 2 glasses of wine each). I guess that's normal now a days huh? Anyway, I'll be back to try some of the other dishes.

Juan Carlos served us lovely wines, and every recommendation he gave off of the menu made me ooohh and ahhhh (for example: the spice dusted shrimp tacos, except the tortilla is really a super thin slice of jicama, which was the most perfect wrapping for and compliment to the amazing flavors of the dish.) five stars on the food, the service, and the atmosphere. It is fun and a great value. and he's cute.", "author": "S W."}

My friends and I enjoyed several small and large plates and liked every one.  My favorite were the shrimp tacos.  I wouldn't usually order shrimp, but the waiter recommended them, and he was right.  The salmon was also excellent.  The restaurant is decorated with a nice, ecclectic style that was interesting to look at, too.", "author": "Jennifer L."}

The wine selection is good, perfect with the food, and a good value.  And the food is amazing.  The huitlacoche and ricotta stuffed dumplings are crazy good, the salmon with pistachio crust is subtle and interesting -- you don't get bored after the first bite like i usually do with salmon.  First time I went there I had some kind of meat carpaccio that was outstanding, but it's not on the menu right now. Go with the recommendations of the servers -- they're friendly and helpful.", "author": "Sammy P."}

And the food? Wait, did we pay 82 bucks for 10 uninspiring calamari (wait, were are the calamari? Oh, I see something like a rubber band inside the panko), 4 flat ravioli (I mean, what's the point of stuffing pasta if you don't see the stuffing?), a teeny green salad, a transparent plate of venison carpaccio (with some petrified slices) and a bottle of cheap Cava Rose' ? Let me take the calculator.....hell yes, we did! And the service was horrible too....and the bread was hard as a stone......but the spoons on the wall were lovely and so was the books on Saint Bernards that came with the bill.  I felt so damn stupid when I saw the taqueria at the corner of Mission and 22nd. We walked home with the shame of being ripped-off...you know what I mean?", "author": "Dario B."}

Twice I have gone to SF last minute from LA and tried to get reservations last minute and they always find a way to get me in. A friend of mine said he went there recently and there table was not ready yet , the  host brought out champagne on the house while they waited. Enough about that. The FOOD is fabulous everything you eat well almost everything is accompanied by an astonishingly fresh and  flavorful sauces. There tuna tacos are some of the best you will ever eat. We got the octopus and it was sliced super thin and was so flavorful. Also, taco tropical is fabulous. It is a lot of fun to go with friends and just order tons of tapas the menu constantly changes so it is always great to ask your waiter there favorites. The decor is fun and the bathroom has a noise machine that plays waves, 2 more good reasons to go. At the end of the day it is great food and good wine. Go and enjoy!", "author": "Lawren S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-08-06", "description": "I've been thinking about it recently, and Lolo is seriously one of the best restaurants in the city. I've been eating at all the famous places lately: Delfina, Beretta, Michael Minna, Greens, Farina, Flour&Water, Maverick, etc. And I realized that they're boring. Sure the execution is flawless, but it's pretty much the same ingredients and the same french-med style preparation and the same farm-to-table taste. Not that it's bad, but when you're looking for something with a little more flavor, a little more adventurous, something you can't find in any big city.. You need the little gems of ethnic fusion foods. And in that category Lolo is absolutely tops. The combo of turkish mexican sounds crazy at first, but it's absolutely excellent. Flavors you will have never had, things you wouldn't think of - even as a foodie. To balance the flavors like this.. it's true artful cooking. And they change the menu frequently - the chef here has range. Add it up and I realized this little neighborhood eccentric spot is the diamond of san francisco.", "author": "Ichibod R."}

I wasn't all that sure about it, but it looked interesting.  We gave it a try, and I was blown away.  There are few places in the city that have food so wonderful that you remember it forever, and Lolo's is one of those places.  The decor is also very fun.  The service was wonderful.  And the price was not bad, $25 per person with drinks, several shared apps and entrees and dessert.  Oh, and the bathroom rocks : )  I read past reviews and I think all the negative comments have been fixed, as the restaurant is now two months old, and worked through the kinks.  The only warning I might give is, don't expect large portions.  They are on the small side, but our server let us know if we needed more, and we walked away full.", "author": "Darcie D."}

My friend and I ordered the octopus, scallops, stuffed pepper and carrot/beet salad, and the tacos.  The tacos were alright (it was the last item to arrive and we were full), but everything else was fantastic.   The flavors were so unique and creative-- we just about licked the sauces off the plates.  I also loved the glass of the Malbec that the waiter recommended and now wish I could remember where it was from.  The service was friendly and helpful.  Also loved: the tongue-in-cheek bathroom, and the \"tray\" that your check arrives in (I think ours was Australian Sheepdogs).", "author": "Hana Y."}

Although simple in ingredients, the flavors were full & well-bodied, mixing various palatable textures and senses (sweet, salty, sour, spicy) into its plates. Enjoyed the roasted tomato puree that accompanied the warm bread, ordered the mahi mahi, and the duck confit tacos. I would say they were all very good, although I'd have to say the \"fanciness\" of the duck confit taco was not satisfied on my price/quality matrix. I think I could have been easily satisfied going to one of the wonderful local tacqueries in this area and having a tacos with al pastor at a lower price. *licks lips* I was very amazed though by the mahi mahi, in the way that each part of the plate (top and bottom) accompanied  and contrasted each other. I'd definitely come back. Laurel B. was right, it was good.", "author": "Jeannette L."}
