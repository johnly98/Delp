I know. It's hard. You were so good in the beginning. I had been looking for some good Indian food for so long. You needed customers, and I needed some good Saag Paneer. It was a mutually beautiful relationship. \n\nBut I am sorry. It's gotten pretty bad here. We had been coming here at least two times a week for the past year, and the last two times we came, it was not good.\n\nThe first whammy came when the Saag Paneer came to our table and it tasted sour. Not just this \"hint of acid\" type thing, I mean - just sour. Like way too much vinegar had been put in it. I never do this, but I sent it back. I told the waiter that it tasted sour. 5 minutes later, the waiter brings the same dish back out and he says that the cook said it's fine, that it just needed more cream.\n\nWe tried it and it tasted like vinegar with a bunch of cream. \n\nLook. I know I am not Indian. And my dining companion is not Indian. And that we are in San Francisco and not India. So maybe I don't know what real Saag Paneer tastes like, but I have had plenty of Saag Paneer. I've had Saag Paneer at Deccan Spice probably a dozen times or so, and it did not taste like this. This was quite disturbing to me because this act felt quite derogatory and I feel belittled like \"Oh, dumb westerners don't know what Saag Paneer tastes like - just add more cream.\" \n\nThis was very hurtful honestly because we have been such regulars, eating at Deccan Spice 2 times per month for the last year. So yeah, it was a punch in the heart. \n\nEven with this terrible experience, we went back again, and our whole meal was very meh. The mulligatawny soup which was heaven for a while, tasted bitter and it clearly did not have the same spices and ingredients it us to. It use to be a complex soup. Now it just tastes like grounded up lentils.\n\nAnd the curries we got - they were not vinegary like last time, but they were underwhelming. Very average.\n\nWith these two whammies, we found a new place we like very much called Lotus SF that's not too far away. I suggest you try them.\n\nLook. I really don't like to trash businesses. I only write bad reviews when I really want to say something. I just don't believe in screwing up other people's businesses. But when we started eating there, the food tasted like someone cared. And the manager there cared about its customers. Whoever is running this place now is not doing a good job. And that's my intention for writing this review is to let the owners know this. We were regulars here for over a year, so at this point, we've probably spent over $1,000 at Deccan Spice. And we will not be coming back... not for a while.", "author": "Bonnie H."}

When the roommate and I were trying to decide what to get for lunch, I picked Deccan Spice. We place our order on Sunday, June 11th at 2:10pm through Delivery dot com. Our delivery order arrived at 3:49pm. We live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Samosa: Vegetarian, Fried homemade street food style pastry with savory filling such as with potatoes, onions, peas and spices ($5)\n*Andhra Curry Entree: gluten-free, Curry stewed in onions, mustard seeds, curry leaves and special andhra spices ($12), Chicken (+$1)\n*Tikka Masala Entree: Glunten-free, Popular orange Indian dish cooked in an exotic creamy yogurt sauce with tangy tomatoes, bell peppers and onions ($12), Chicken (+$1)\n*Vindaloo Entree: gluten-free, Cooked in a goan style with tomatoes, potatoes, vinegar, fresh ginger and spices with a touch of red wine ($13), Chicken (+$1)\n*Special Naan: Naan generously topped with special selection of toppings with a touch of traditional delicacy to pinch your taste buds - Onion Kulcha, Garlic Naan, Chili Naan ($5 each)\n\nAll the curries came with rice. We had asked for the tikka masala and vindaloo extra spicy, so there was some heat in those dishes. I could have gone even spicier though. The vindaloo had the best flavor. Savory and comforting. My go to, the tikka masala was creamy, but it was a little too nutty for me. We decided to try something new, so we got the andhra curry as well. Way too sweet for me. I wished we had ask for that extra spicy as I think it would have cut into the sweetness. But we were trying something new, so we decided to try it as is. The naan was good. Soft, fluffy, and had a nice chew. Good for sopping up the curry. The samosas were kind of disappointing. Over fried, so super hard on the outside. Not sure if they are always like this, but I'd suggest passing on the app. We did get a Mango Lassi: A refreshing churned yogurt drinks, Large size available only, which I believe runs $5 if you order it. I'm not a huge fan of this drink, so we actually ended up tossing it.\n\nVery average Indian food experience. And kind of pricey for what it was. Even though the curries came with rice, I wished they priced them lower and didn't include the rice as we didn't even eat it. I did like that they used real peppers to spice up the curries though.

My wife and I came on a Wednesday right at 5pm when they opened.  We were the only ones in the restaurant and were sat immediately.  Our waiter brought over menus and we took some time to make our choices.  I ordered the Mulligatawny soup (lentil) and my wife chose the samosa.  For our main dishes we got the Chicken Tika and Andhra curry with garlic naan. My soup came out fairly quickly and was enjoyable, the rest of the meal was kind of downhill from there.  The single biggest issue was bad service we received from our waiter.  It wasn't that he was rude, he just was inattentive and seemed like he did not want to be there. Specifically the issue is that we received this extremely poor service when we were the only table in the restaurant, so it wasn't like he was \"slammed\" with a bunch of other tables.    While I ate my soup we continued to wait on my wife's samosa.  It ended up coming out simultaneously with her main course, which I'll admit is pretty annoying, timing the appetizer to come out before the main course is pretty basic. My main dish came out shortly afterward.  We quickly tried to finish out appetizers so we could enjoy our main courses while they were still warm.   The Chicken tika, was okay, but many of the pieces of chicken were dry and over cooked. My curry was good, but nothing mind-blowing.  We were never given knives, and the chicken tika came in large chunks that needed cutting, our water remained empty for extended periods of time, and while my wife was interested in ordering a glass of wine, our waiter never asked us if we'd like anything to drink and each time he would stop by the table he'd leave so quickly we didn't have the chance to ask for anything additional.  Meh...\n\nAnother review mentioned it and it rang true to me.  While we were sitting at our table, we saw delivery people coming and going almost constantly.  It really appears that Deccan is prioritizing their delivery service and forgetting those that choose to \"dine-in\".", "author": "Nick G."}

I have to admit I got nervous when I saw the crowded and compact space, and I was placed smack dab in the middle where a woman had a huge backpack to maneuver around and the diner next to me inadvertently flung a dosa in my direction as she was packing her to-go container. Truth be told, I only came here because my original choice, Laksa on Guerrero, was closed on Tuesday. Who closes on Tuesday? Since my mind was on five-spice chicken, I didn't have a clue what to order at a place that specializes in Hyderabadi dishes.\n\nI first ordered the $8 Ponganaalu because it frankly said \"steamed donuts\" but they were savory ones with onion. Unfortunately they had already run out of those, so I asked the smiling female server what she suggested, and she immediately told me to try the $13 Sandwich Dosa. Disregarding the $5 mark-up for a second, I was thrown by the \"sandwich\" part of the description. I was wondering if it came on pumperknickle with a dab of mayo, so I said why not. Soon out came a huge tray with what looked to be an Indian-style quesadilla though they referred to it as a \"thin creep\". Whatever it was was surprisingly delicious. It was quartered with each stuffed with cabbage, potato, tomato, cheese and onion, like, uh...a sandwich.\n\nIt came with three chutneys, a yogurt dipping sauce, and little bowl of daal (photo: http://bit.ly/2bm62tF). I was already geting stuffed when my entree came out, the $15 Hyderabadi Goat Korma, so tasty tender with the goat still attached to some of the bones. all of it bathing in a creamy cashew, almond and coconut sauce that definitely required a $4 side of white rice to sop most of it up (photo: http://bit.ly/2bwOMi5). Two dishes, two winners. I'd like to come back with Jamie W. and try some more. The one hiccup was the server asking me to Yelp the place then and there to get a 10% discount. Honey, nobody rushes me through one of my reviews.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...south Indian dishes done right...need to try some more sometime\nAMBIANCE - 3 stars...honestly too cramped for my ample derriere\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...cheery if a bit unctuous\nTOTAL - 4 stars...unique subcontinental dishes well worth trying", "author": "Ed U."}

The restaurant is bare bones but clean, a couple of tables and booths with paper placemats and bare walls. That's fine cause the food is bomb and the service was very attentive and kind. They also serve the food on metal plates just like in India. Like that the food was not heavy or too greasy and was quite fresh.\n\nChili Paneer - (3/5) Kinda bland, not spicy enough. This tasted the most guilty fast food like with the cornstarch coating.\nTandoori Chicken (4.5/5) - Very juicy and well marinated and seasoned with an amazing char. The smokiness was a little fruit in nature as if from saffron but I don't believe it was used.\nPodi Dosa (5/5) - Amazing texture, a smooth but crispy shell, very interesting spice combinations, properly spicy. Came with three chutneys: the coconut (my fav because it helped cool it down), and sambar.\nRas Malai (3.5/5) - Sugary, rosy spiced with cardamom. The cheese had a great texture of spongey yet firm enough without being tough. The cream it was floating in was grainy and not as smooth, but props for making it in house.\n\nWent again and ordered 2 curries to go on a second occasion which came with a side of rice. I was able to stretch this out to 4 meals but take that with a grain of salt as I'm a smaller person with an healthy appetite.\nSaag Paneer (4/5) - Very intense celery smell. Spinach pureed in heavy cream, notably and thankfully absent is cheap greasy oil. Paneer was a great texture, not too firm, not too mushy and mild in flavor.\nButter Chicken (4/5) - Incredible creamy coconut milk based sauce, tender chicken thigh chunks.\n\nEverything tasted great, the curries aren't a huge portion and the protein (paneer, chicken) to sauce ratio is lacking. You should definitely finish all the sauce with whatever vehicle you can - rice, naan.", "author": "Truc N."}

We decided to go to Deccan spice and it did the trick! It's a pretty small restaurant so we were immediately greeted by the staff and seated. \n\nWe ordered three dishes: butter chicken, chicken tikka masala, and a veggie tikka masala. We also ordered two orders of naan and extra rice since it doesn't come with enough. That was the only downside of our experience if that says anything. The food was delicious and the portions were pretty average; what you would normally receive at an Indian restaurant. I wouldn't say they were big, but they weren't small either. \n\nHowever, for SF the prices here were great! They were actually on the lower end and I was pleasantly surprised since being a visitor, you hear that everything in SF is expensive. For all our food, it came out to about $16 a person which was good for me. Definitely go back next time I'm in the Bay Area!", "author": "Michelle L."}

Everyone in our party asked for food \"medium\" on a cold day, and we were plenty warm by the end :). One person in party who was not as spice tolerant had to stop eating early... more food for me!\nNone of the food was a revelation, but I was pleased to have what I thought was quite nice Indian food in the trendier (and consequently sometimes blander) Valencia corridor. Saag Paneer was not too creamy (I prefer it that way), Chicken Korma was enjoyed by fellow diner, and Paneer Tikka had the right balance of salt, sweet, creamy, and tomato. \n\nRice is included in the price (hence the slightly higher price)--this is a rarity in SF!\n\nPlain naan was dry and fluffy (as opposed to when it is chewy and a little oily--I appreciate both). Butter naan was that but with some butter on top! Both were made as rounds and split equally into fourths. \n\nSERVICE: Very friendly! \nI made a reservation through Yelp Res for 11pm (the earliest available... really?), but we were seated at a table at 10:30 (when we arrived). \n\n\nAMBIANCE: Nicely decorated, quiet, and great for a casual dining experience.

The flavors were really good (4.5 stars) but when I asked for a little more sambar I was brought a side and charged two dollars without telling me (1 star!) - I thought that was in poor taste given they had no dosas which make up half the menu...\n\nMy husband didn't care for his Chana masala (2 stars), he thought the coconut milk flavor in there was weird- I kinda liked it but there was a ton of almost Raw onions in there. Naan was eh, and way overpriced for the portion (1.5 stars ) the guy brought us free rice it Maybe it came with the curry, rice walls good.\n\nThe service was also really weird, like it looks as if they have upgraded the interior but the water glasses are still plastic.

It was kinda weird that they put hella sauce on top, like a spicy indian bbq sauce. But it worked well and we liked how it's served sizzling hot on a bed of bell peppers! If you're a meat lover, I'd get the sampler ($19) with lamb, chicken, shrimp, etc.. to try it out.\n\nGongura Goat (ask for less salty!!) came soooo overwhelmingly salty that I could not eat more than one bite. And I really wanted to because the spices were good! We told our server about it and he quickly offered to remake it. When it came back out, it was perfect. Gongura is this leaf that gives off the same taste as marinaded olive leaves (\u6a44\u85cd\u83dc). Waiter told us it's like spinach.. lolll it is not like spinach. But it's good. And spicy. I was pretty blown away by this dish, I'd totally order it again. The goat had some tendons and chewiness which I think worked well with the curry. No gaminess from the meat, they cooked it well.\n\nWe also ordered paratha which was more like chapati (thin bread, $4 for two pieces). It was really good but kinda expensive I guess.\n\nThe dessert and drinks.. were really disappointing. Falooda had none of the promised vermicelli and stuff. Waiter said it's due to customer complaints that customers wanted those things out. Really now. So it was literally a milkshake.. for $8! They did take it off the bill for us so I'm not gonna complain about it too much, but avoid falooda here! lol. You can get a legitimate indian dessert in the south bay for so much cheaper.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-11-03", "description": "Deccan Spice is definitely some of the best Indian Food I have had in SF. I have eaten their food twice: Once for delivery when they just opened and recently in their restaurant and both times, I was impressed with the quality and value. Sure, this is no Dosa or Amber in terms of fanciness but you can tell this restaurant is run by people who are passionate about cooking for others and producing satisfying, delicious food.\n\nThe time we ordered delivery, it did take us an hour and a half to get our food which we were a bit annoyed with but since they just opened, we understood. When we finally got the food, any annoyance went away just because it was that good. I cannot remember exactly what we ordered but it CAME with rice (not common) and we got a free Chicken Biryani for hitting some delivery order amount.\n\nRemembering how good the food was and craving Indian food, we came in last week for dinner on Saturday around ~9pm. This place was POPPING. The restaurant is small, to be fair, but there was a line that was forming while we were ordering that was a few parties deep. Deccan Spice is apparently open until 3 AM which is AWESOME and I imagine great drunchies. I will have to try that out some time ; ) \n\nAnyways, for the two of us, we ordered Lamb Vindaloo, Chicken Chettinad and 1 Garlic Naan to share. We ordered the dishes \"Indian Spicy\" and they looked at us like we were nuts but hey, we like our spice and most places DON'T make food spicy enough for me. I also personally had a Madras Coffee and my boyfriend had a Coke. They also have a Yelp Check-In deal for a free soft drink so his drink was free.\n\nWe probably waited around 30 minutes for our food which felt like a long time but it was fine. If anything, watching everyone else's food come out made us even more excited. Finally our food arrived and everything was GREAT. Both dishes were PHENOMENAL, especially the Chicken Chettinad. I will say, I think they went a bit easy on the spices but I guess they would rather risk that than a law suit from people who don't realize what they are ordering. It still was spicier than most places will serve us so I was happy. Again, it also came with rice which was really great considering that almost never happens in SF. We immensely enjoyed our meal and felt like it was the right amount of food. The price was right and both of us left with happy bellies. We cannot wait to come back for dinner, late night or even breakfast!", "author": "Carrie W."}

I genuinely want to support this place but I cannot in good conscience. I am leaving this review so the owners/managers can be aware of their lack of customer service skills and the disorder within their restaurant, especially during dinner. There's been an issue almost every time.\n\nCons: \n---first time they majorly messed up it was a FOUR HOUR ordeal. The food arrived 1.5 hrs later after several back and forth interactions, and it wasn't the right one and the bread was burnt. Went back and forth several times with them until another order came 4 hrs after the original order. Bread was burned and it was past dinner time. Bread is $4 and we had ordered 4/5. No one ate it so it went to waste. They were semi accusatory as they claimed the order was indeed what we had ordered. \n---second time they super messed up, they flat out said the order wasn't wrong so basically I'm lying. As someone who has eaten chicken tikka masala over 100 times in my life, and several times at this place, I'm certain I received the wrong order. He told me he'd call me back and 25 mins later after I called him back he said he was reviewing the tapes to see if I got the right order. This is after being tossed on the phone from person to person many times. At this point it was almost 2 hrs after the food was ordered. I doubt there will be a refund. \n---inconsistent taste for same dishes. Sometimes watery and sometimes not. \n---bread is either soggy or burnt. Pick your poison. \n---food was delicious the first time and that was on a slow period so you as the customer have to calculate if they're busy and check every item (bc they will leave things out or give you the wrong order and claim you're lying) AND have change (one time the guy didn't have change and was going to leave with an insane tip if I didn't have cash in my change jar).\n---they were nice in person one time during pick-up. We thought pickup would avoid wrong order issues. The food was great the first time so we though perhaps we caught them at a couple of off nights; they forgot to include onions and the bread was semi burnt. \n---my theory is they're understaffed, growing and expanding but unsure how to handle it. They mean well I'm sure but they should not treat their customers in this abominable way. \n\nThey've wasted HOURS of my life I want back; it's like a full work day at this point if you add the hours.

It should be a $1. Dont order north indian food from here, this place has alright south indian food. Also, expect a wait, this place takes 30-40 mins for a simple order.\n\nWe ordered a dosa, hyderabadi chicken with roti and chole bathura. It took them 40 mins to serve them.

There was no way to get in touch with the driver, so we called Deccan spice and they were able to tell us that our food was still there. They were very helpful because I think they were able to contact uber eats because uber eats called us minutes later only to let us know we would have to reorder the food.

It is supposed to be about $13.  It said choice of two curries.  Mind you the word choice!  No listing as to what the choices are.  So I chose from the menu.  I ordered from one young man who obviously does not speak much English, but whatever, I figure they wouldn't put him on the floor if they were not confident in his order taking skills.  I asked if one could be a veggie, since I like saag panner.  They said okay.  I looked at the Chicken curries, there was one that said Chicken hiper..? (I can't pronounce it but its a curry.)  I picked that one.  I wait.  The check came, I gave them a card.  The credit slip came, it reads $41 and change.  I say, \"Um, No?!  How does a lunch special total $41???\"  I DID NOT SIGN!! (Hence, I did not agree to the charges.)\n\nThe other young man who speaks English comes and looks puzzled because he had confirmed the chicken curry with me, and I said, yes, for the lunch special.  (I came in saying I wanted a lunch special!)  He takes the bag away and presumably removed whatever items were in there and give me back what should amount a lunch special, I think.  I don't know since I did not look inside the bag at that point.  He adjusted the credit slip, -$28 and change and says I don't have to sign.  I leave with the bag.\n\nIn my bag, when I got to work by there was: a dal container 1/3 filled, some mixed rice, some white rice, a small sweet bread pudding like item and a curry.  Some of the items looked like they has been poured out to equate a lunch special, perhaps??  Nothing was what I ordered!  Mind you, no Saag Panner!)   I am looking at my bank account and it still has the $41 dollar charge and not the adjustment!  He took the bag, he removed items and still charged me?? I hope not and that the adjustment is delayed.  I hope to see it by tomorrow, otherwise I will be calling the bank to ask for the charge to be reversed.", "author": "Maricela L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-09-27", "description": "Fantastic new Indian place in the Mission. We tried a variety of dishes, all of them were really delicious:\n\n- Chilli Gobi: A spicy fried cauliflower dish, also available with paneer (next time!). My least favorite dish, but still really tasty. The flavors were all good, but I wish it were spicier. The cauliflower was really tender and soft. \n- Schezwan Gobi: They accidentally brought us this dish, and gave it to us on the house once they realized their mistake. This is BY FAR the better cauliflower dish in my opinion. The sauce on the cauliflower is delicious, and the pieces of cauliflower were perfect, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. One of my favorites.\n- Onion dosa: Basically a huge, indian spiced crepe that's filled with onions. It was crispy, flaky and soft all at the same time. The sauces it came with were all really good also. It came with a spicy tomato based sauce, a yogurt sauce, and an apple sauce. Good, but super filling and really big!\n- Andhra Chicken Curry: I wanted to go with the lamb, but my friend doesn't like it so we went with the chicken. This was probably my favorite dish here. It was properly spicy (my friend was sweating), and the curry had a lot of depth and complexity. You'll get a large whiff of spice as you walk through the door, this curry is probably what it's from. Super good, a must order! Rice was included.\n- Garlic Naan: I usually tend to try and eat low carb and stay away from Naan, but I had heard this place has good naan. IT DOES. The naan was some of the best I've had in the city. Buttery and soft, it was a perfect vehicle for the curry, and helped with some of the heat.\n\nThe only non-positive thing I can say is that the service was a bit slow, but that's to be expected from a place that's only been open a couple of months and is still getting their groove down. If you like Indian food you should really give this place a try. I'll definitely be back to try their tandoori chicken and some of their paneer dishes.", "author": "Eric W."}

We were seated promptly and they checked in on us a couple times before we ordered.\n\nThings we ordered:\n*Masala dosa\n*Mysore masala dosa\n*Kara dosa\n*Custom uthapama (peas, carrots, tomatoes)\n*Veg platter - which BTW comes with a lot more food than specified. It says rice OR roti, but actually comes with white rice, biriyani, roti, AND dessert. The vegetables of were veg tikka masala and dal fry\n*Masala chai - this was GREAT - I had 2!\n\nThe quality of the food was great. My favorite was the mysore masala dosa, but the veg platter was really good as well. The veg tikka masala and biriyiani in particular were good, but the dal was way too garlicky (and that's from a noted garlic lover).\n\nThe prices are what I'd consider par for course for SF Indian food, though higher than what I'd like to pay having grown up in the South Bay.\n\nService was more of a mixed bag - water remained unfilled for a while, and we had to remind them of one of our sides.\n\nStill, given it's a new restaurant, I'm willing to let the service piece slide (for now). I'll definitely back!", "author": "Rohan N."}

Still, I know I'm not the only person who's noticed the slightly bland, mediocre quality of most Indian restaurants in the city. \n\nEnter Deccan Spice! I've ordered delivery from here twice, and both times, I've been beyond satisfied with the rich, flavorful authenticity of each dish. Being a creature of habit, I always order the same thing: lamb tikka masala, spicy aloo paneer, and an order of gulab jamon. \n\nI can say this is most definitely the best Indian food there is in San Francisco-- and I even found out that they do large catering orders for corporate events (score!)! They give you an order of plain rice with your tikka masala order, which just makes sense (you'd be surprised how many places don't do this). I would give 5 stars, but the food keeps coming packaged differently each time and some of the packaging was flimsy and leaked last time I ordered. Also, I'm a pretty non-discriminate gulab jamon fan, but the gulab jamon I ordered last time came flavored with cardamom, which I've never seen done and wouldn't care to experience again. \n\nAll in all, this place has become a staple in my weekly delivery rotation--in fact, I'm about to order right now!", "author": "Halli A."}

We ordered samosas and spring rolls to begin and there were spicy and fresh at the same time.  My Decan biriyani was some of the best I have ever had and enough to feed a family of three.  The chicken, spices, hard-boiled egg were all perfect.  The goat curry was also expertly well done.  the $9 bread basket left us with enough for another day.

We weren't sure what to expect, but I love Indian food and my boyfriend is adventuresome, so we came here. It's a rando storefront, but the interior manages to be both romantic/cozy and palatial. There are comfy booths and a huge hanging chandelier with (mostly) Indian music piping through the sound system. I feel like maybe somebody's mom is cooking in the kitchen, because *every* *single* dish we had was lavishly layered with spice and calibrated seasoning. It honestly tasted like love. While we were there on a random Tuesday night, there were mostly Indian patrons and a sh*t ton of take out orders. Okay, the FOOD:\nWe ordered everything spicy (as we do, Boo). My BF got a salty lassi, and we ordered some ridiculous fried cauliflower (chili gobi) in some red sauce with peppers and onions that was out of this world delicious. The breading was light and flavorful, and the sauce was complex and...well...saucy. That was followed by a lamb curry (Andhra) and a cabbage/paneer curry (paneer bhurji). The lamb curry was both tangy and spicy (without being overwhelming), and the cabbage and cheese dish was rich and creamy. We got pickles which are an Achilles Heel of mine, and they were insanely good. We also had rice, garlic/cheese naan (I know, it's not a real thing, but it's so freakin good), and the keema dosa, which was a crepe with meat and spices inside.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-07-04", "description": "Update: I guess I was really excited about this place when it opened, but recent visits have left me somewhat underwhelmed. There's this regrettable tendency of many Indian restaurants to regress to a state where a) dosas don't quite hit the mark with a sogginess / unnecessary oiliness, b) curries start to acquire this overly spiced sameness. It's not a bad restaurant but it's a far cry from what it was in its first two weeks.\n\nMy original review here:\nThis is about as close to authentic South Indian food as you're going to get in SF.  Dosas and vadas that aren't super greasy, accompanied by a bunch of delicious chutneys and sambar - pretty much how Indian fast food ought to be.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-04-22", "description": "If only I were non-vegetarian, this place would get five stars. I usually stick to the \"breakfast\" items such as dosa, idli, vada etc. and am generally happy with the quality. However, I'm skeptical about the recent changes around two \"smaller\" dosas instead of the traditional single larger one. The dosa often tends to be low on salt and the masala quite salty - so bit of a problem with the overall dish sometimes. Please bring back the one larger dosa. The idli vada combo tends to be pretty meager - certainly for the price, one would expect a lot more. \n\nAll in all, the non-vegetarian items seem to be a lot better, at least that's what my dining companions seem to think. 4 stars is fair from my perspective. The management is experimenting quite a bit with the items to satisfy the greatest number of customers. My advice to management is to not appeal to the lowest common denominator - retain the authentic taste without endlessly tinkering, that's what matters. Lowest common denominator == boring.\n\nP.S. Plain rice was 4$ - that's just wrong.", "author": "H R."}

Each gravy should be made authentic to the dish name. On top of that the Manchurian and the Tandoori had the same sauce. It's not authentic nor can I say delicious.

Especially since you rarely find a place that does both South Indian and North Indian cuisine so well. We're both Indian so we have pretty high standards when it comes to authentic Indian flavor. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious! We asked them to make it spicy and they complied! We had the mango lassi, idli, chicken 65, teenmar dosa, lamb saag and for dessert: gulab jamun and rasmali.  Hard to pick a favorite but I think it was either the teenmar dosa or the lamb saag. Dessert: also tough to pick a favorite, as the rasmali was super creamy and the gulab jamun had the perfect texture. If you are looking for a fancy place with a nice ambience, this isn't it.

When we came in, there weren't too many people in the restaurant and a woman greeted us quickly and was friendly. I rated Deccan spice as 4 stars but I would really give it 3.5 stars.\n\nTHE FOOD: We were seated quickly and selected paneer butter masala along with mirchi bhajji and raita. The mirchi bhajji was great and I thoroughly enjoyed it as did my boyfriend. The panner butter masala wasn't as good and seemed to be missing a key ingredient -something acidic such as lemon, hing, or tamarind. The naan we ordered was freshly made, fluffy, and delicious. The raita was under salted and runny, however, this could be a matter of preference and is not necessarily a ding.\n\nTHE AMBIANCE: I was surprised how fast the restaurant filled up with patrons. The decor is very basic (however the painting on the wall is lovely) and Deccan Spice isn't somewhere I would take someone for a date.\n\nOTHER NOTES: This place is TINY. The restroom is in the back and I wanted to wash my hands but I felt uncomfortable having to walk through the 5-6 employees crowded by the register. For the amount of employees visible to us, we did have a hard time getting someone's attention. Given that Deccan Spice seems to be a new restaurant, I'm going to positively assume that these employees were training but it should be noted if that many employees are visible then the customers should be able to make eye contact easily. \n\nWould I go back? Maybe. I would go back to eat the mirchi bhajji but I wouldn't get the panner butter masala again. I hope that they work out the kinks. The woman who greeted us was really lovely to communicate with and I sense that Deccan Spice is her baby. \n\nDISCLAIMER: I was offered a small discount for this review. For the merchant, I would recommend incorporating the proposition of discounts for reviews in a paper form instead of directly asking as well as telling the customer how much the discount is up front. I didn't ask and was slightly disappointed that the amount was paltry in comparison to how long I would put into writing this review. After all, time is money...", "author": "Whitney A."}

Their menu is massive and if you are not too familiar with Indian food apart from the very familiar dishes, it could get really confusing.  To make things easier, I ordered the chicken lunch special which has chicken curry, dal soup, biryani, basmati, roti, veggie pakoras and an Indian dessert.  The dal soup was well-seasoned as well as the biryani but sadly their chicken curry was very bland and I mostly got boney chicken parts.

I requested it be mild but once the order arrived (late), the level of spice for both was absolute fire. The Goan sauce was very garlicky but I just figured that's how it's supposed to be. It wasn't until the next morning that I started experiencing a lot of digestive problems and was hating my life. I contacted the customer support at Eat 24 and they called the restaurant owner. He was extremely defensive and claimed that their food is made fresh daily (what restaurant isn't?) and that there was nothing wrong with the order. He absolutely refused to give any money back and consequently eat 24 was unable to offer anything but a two dollar coupon which was a total insult. Things sometimes go wrong with restaurants but owners should take responsibility and compensate the customer even if they believe the customer is wrong (customer is always right).

We looked at the lunch specials but the menu was confusing in terms of what you actually get so I ordered a la carte. I ordered what I guess was an appetizer but it was a huge dish called Chicken 555. I also go rice, a plain naan and a Tiger beer. The Chicken 555 arrived by itself way ahead of all the other orders which was weird. We wanted to all eat together but when I asked where my other food was and where the food of my friend was we got a \"They're working on it.\" It took a while for the rest of the food to arrive so the Chicken 555 got cold. Since we were waiting I asked if I could have my beer. It arrived in a bottle so I asked for a glass. A glass arrived but it was so grimy and had dishwasher baked on food so I asked if I could have a clean glass. The waiter took my glass and wiped it with a cloth or something then bought it back. Now I had a dirty glass with smeared dirt inside and outside the glass. Needless to say, I drank from the bottle. The food was actually pretty good. The Chicken 555 was spicy and looked great too. The naan was fluffy and fresh. The rice was ok. I wanted to give it three stars but the service and randomness of the food delivery does not merit it. I probably won't be back but I hope they figure it out. There aren't enough Indian places around in San Francisco. Oh, the music was too loud. A lot of places do this now.

Horrible lighting. Makes the food look even worse. Purplish fluorescent lighting combined with darkness. Blaring loud Bollywood untz untz club music. I like this sort of music, but not to the point where it makes me feel like little doodle bugs are dancing in my pancreas. I ordered the GLOPPY AND FLAVORLESS biryani. It looked like congealed vomit on a hot day, mixed with chunks of fried poop. Tasted like warm cottage cheese that had been soaked in watered down lemonade. The cheese naan, which really should be called NON was a disgrace. It was filled with cheddar cheese and looked like a bursted ovarian cyst in a medical journal. Disgusting. Took one bite and thought \"if I take another bite of this crap I'll fart myself to death and be very sad.\" So, needless to say I didn't take any more bites of that silliness. I ordered raita to go with the naan. Of course, the server didn't tell me that my main meal already came with raita. So, he brings me a VAT of runny raita. I just wanted to cry at this point. Also, the chai was A joke. The joke was on me. Because every time you get a refill of their 6oz lukewarm chai they charge you $4. Four mother flippin dollars for something that sits in an urn near the goddamn bathroom. So that means I paid $16 for some goddam coffee water. Like , what the goddam hell? Seriously? All the other Indian and Pakistani restaurants charge $1. $1 and you can have as much as you want. You know why? BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT GOOD & IT IS MEANT TO BE A FOIL FOR HEAVILY SPICED PUNGENT EXOTIC FOOD. And, it costs about .03 cents to make. They charge you out the ass for their disgusting food. $40 + tip for something that would cost me less than half as much at Pakwan. That's right, I mentioned a different place. Pakwan is far superior. This place sucked the life out of me. I was so disappointed. I told all my friends. And I have a lot of friends. One of my saltier friends laughed at me and said\" haaa!

The andhra chicken curry had curry that reeked of lamb - clearly they either use the same curry for both or they use the same utensils to make both. Also, the goat biryani had pieces of chicken in it, and again some parts of the rice smelled like lamb. The most appalling thing was when all of this was pointed out to a lady who appeared to be the manager, she told us that she will look into it and didn't come back till we had finished our meals - and when she did, she had apparently completely forgotten about it and asked if we enjoyed our food. Of course we didn't. Absolutely nothing was done to rectify the issue. Moreover, we were charged for two items that we had ordered but which they forgot to serve. This seems to be a new restaurant in the area, so don't be fooled by the high ratings like we were.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-23", "description": "This is the definitely the best Indian food I've had in San Francisco. Super flavorful and rich but not greasy. The naan is fantastic, butter chicken is perfectly tangy and sweet, awesome vindaloo, and lamb roganjosh is mind blowingly good. The place is a little small and take out waits can be long but it's totally worth it. I'm worried once the word gets out this place is going to start having long lines but the food deserves it.", "author": "E J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-08-20", "description": "The food is decent. But the service is terrible and the staff full out lie. We ordered takeout and were told to come in 30 minutes. When we arrived 35 minutes later, they told us it would be ready in 5 more. This was also a lie. They made us wait another 20 minutes before giving us our order. Good Indian food is too easy to come by to be worth enriching an incompetent and dishonest business.", "author": "John B."}

We especially enjoyed the dishes from Tamil Nadu state. Even the nan and samosas were unusually tasty.

It's a tight fit with some amazing food. We had the chicken Chettinadu - earthy, but not heavy with flavored of cinnamon & star anise - Andhra Lamb - hearty gravy with a nice smokiness - & paneer bhurji - shredded paneer in a creamy, semi-sweet sauce. We were about an hr; when we left the place had filled up, completely. The operation hrs are a huge bonus, nearly all day. We will be frequenting this place, often.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-28", "description": "I have to agree with the other 1 star reviews. Came here with high hopes since it is just 2 blocks from my house. I hate writing bad reviews for restaurants as I never want to hurt someone's livelihood. However, the husband and I left feeling somewhat ripped off. We ordered the vegetable biryani which was completely inedible. It was so salty we would have been in cardiac arrest had we finished it. We each took a few bites and left the rest. Even consuming that little of it we had to drink tons of water that night to stay hydrated. Not okay Deccan Spice. After reading other reviews, it seems they have a heavy hand with the salt. The waitress saw that we did not eat it and asked if it was okay. I told her very politely that it was too salty for us. She never offered to remove the item from our bill nor offer any compensation. We also had the chicken tikka masala (a favorite of ours from another Indian restaurant down the street with the initials AR). The chicken pieces were poor quality and flavor was lacking. We also ordered mango chutney which never came and yet remained on our bill. The story is too long to get into in this review, but suffice to say they said we got the chutney (we did not) yet they did not remove it from the bill. We were too weary to argue over $3.00. There are many other wonderful Indian restaurants in the neighborhood to choose from. I suggest going to them and not wasting your hard earned $ here.", "author": "Ms. P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-08-24", "description": "First of all, I gave 1 star for the restaurant for their hygienic problems, and the way they offer discounts on food to get high ratings on Yelp. The kitchen was disgusting. This is by far the most disgusting kitchen I've ever seen in my life. I was waiting in line for the bathroom and passed by it. Trash was all over the floor. Dirty towels and food were laying everywhere on the floor. After seeing me waiting in front of the kitchen, the manager of the restaurant told employees to close the kitchen curtain every time they came in and out of the restaurant. If they didn't, the manager would make sure they would come back and close the curtain. I visited the restaurant last night with a friend, who was Indian. I thought the food was good, but my friend did not think so. The menu was huge, and they were not even serving some of the items on the list. So what's the point of having a huge menu if you don't even serve the food? I was deeply disappointed, would not recommend it to anyone, and would never come back.", "author": "Vy N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2016-09-21", "description": "Man this started out as myself getting this restaurant mixed up with another. Checked out the reviews on Yelp and thought you know what screw it I'll give it a go! Pretty easy to find, kinda a hole in the wall place. Sat down, water was brought out, then ordered. Normal procedure. Food was eventually brought out after numerous people around us who ordered wayyyy after got their food, but I was still patient. I ordered a curry dish with chicken. If you enjoy chicken, please do. It come here. It is at lowest quality possible. Every single piece was full 97% fat garbage. Super disappointing considering some of the reviews on here? After closer look you can see most are from uber eats which is kinda funny. Giving away $20 off to new users who sign up. Id order free food from here too when I'm super high and it would prolly be great because hell free food is much better tasting right? Anyways, after the food came out (yay more Water too) our waiter didn't come by once more. Out water was left empty and every single attempt to gather anyone's attention was ignored. They were not even busy but I'm assuming it's all the uber eat orders they are pushing out the door. When I finally got the attention of someone (having to physically grab their arm) I asked for my check and they brought it over and waited over me while I was reviewing my bill. Rude. When I gave them my card they ran it, brought it back and started to take the food and drinks off my table! Um hello? I haven't even signed my signature on the receipt and you're taking the FULL drinks off my table?! And rushing me out the door? Now I suddenly get service? After I pay? Never coming here again. SF restaurants are starting to let me down more and more.", "author": "Alexander J."}
