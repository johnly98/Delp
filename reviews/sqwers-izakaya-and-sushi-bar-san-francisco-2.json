My friends come here all the time.  I've made friends with people that come here ALL THE TIME just because I see them so often.\nThe quality of fish is always good, Sake and beer flow like Niagra Falls, the people that work here are fantastic.  It's always a party and I am so happy to have found this place.  There aren't many restaurants where you end up talking to tables that are near you for much of the evening.  \n\nFor a unique experience and great fish, come here.\n\nI've read some reviews where people are disappointed with a delivery or some nonsense like that and rate them poorly after going there many times before and never having an issue.  Yelp is great, and then there are the a-holes on it who review poorly to be re compensated.  Basically bottom feeders in my opinion.\n\nI have come here over a hundred times now, never have I gotten sick.  I have ordered delivery dozens of times, same story.  And I have a weak stomach, so if anyone is getting ill, it's me.\n\nThis place has so many people coming back all the time, that isn't a fluke.\n\nMy large family now comes here, my coworkers, so many friends that I've brought just once.  Thank you Sqwers for providing the funnest place to have dinner/lunch on such an often basis.  You have a FOREVER patron in me.", "author": "Natasha B."}

This last time was a total let-down, and I ended up having to throw almost 75% of the food away because of poor quality.  I don't know if that they had an \"off\" day, but when you serve uncooked raw foods, it's ALWAYS best to put your best foot forward, because raw foods could easily get your patrons sick.  \"off\" day or not, the restaurant shouldn't have sent out un-fresh fish or sub-par quality fish.  \n\nWe ordered a bunch of different sashimi plates, chirashi, sushi, Ikura, the likes. All of the items that warrant fresh tasting seafood, and you can definitely tell if it wasn't.  There were slivers of sinew, they used ESCOLAR which is something that gives you NOT SO GOOD PROBLEMS on the other end if you consume it, Tuna that looked like it had been sliced with a dull-knife, and the Ikura tasted old and fishy.  Halfway through my meal, we had to chuck it because the fish was either too mushy, too fishy or too sinewy.  We spent almost $130 on that meal for 4, and was sorely disappointed. \n\nThere are MANY if not hundreds of sushi restaurants in Bay Area, seriously, you have to step up your game! \n\nRant done.", "author": "Kay H."}

We ordered one Lychee Soju ($11) and one Large Hot Sake ($6), which we ended up sharing with the waiter. Soon enough, he came around pouring us more shots of sake eventually finishing an entire bottle. This spot was a fun time and I would come back just for the environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the food was mediocre. The three of us shared the Beef Sukiyaki ($11), Cherry Blossom Roll ($12), Godzilla Roll ($13), Giants Roll ($14), and one more roll that we had the chef surprise us with. For the rolls, they were all on the small and skimpy side. Also, the sukiyaki did not have a sweet broth flavor to it either while the beef too well done.\n\nOverall, pricey and mediocre food, but the fun and lively environment from the waiters made this whole experience so memorable and worth it.", "author": "Cindy Z."}

Delivery was quick too which is always a big plus.\n\nI ordered their Avocado Sushi ($4.50) which gives you 2 pieces. This will give you the most perfect bite. The sushi rice was cooked perfectly - it was sticky and warm and mushy. The avocado slices on top gave the bite a creamy texture and the sesame seeds sprinkled on top was a nice touch. However, the Gyu Don ($10.99) was the real winner. You'll get a hearty bowl of white rice, topped with simmered sliced beef and sauteed onions. The beef broth in the bowl made the rice taste so hearty, and the sliced beef was very tender and delicate. The bowl is also garnished with pickled ginger and seaweed for a little extra flavor. \n\nI loved their food so much that I ordered from them again the week after and it was just as yummy as the first time.

He has been our waiter both times we've been here and he is absolutely awesome. He is friendly and attentive, but beyond that the guys is really funny. For instance, when we first came here for a lunch date, he kept trying to get us drunk in broad daylight, repeatedly offering sake with every item we ordered.

I came here to try out the lunch special, and started my meal excited by the cheap price of $8. \n\nI ordered a teriyaki salmon and vegetable tempura combo. The teriyaki salmon was a tad bland, overcooked yet lacking in flavor. The vegetable tempura was over-battered and tasted as if the oil they fried it in was old.\n\nMy mother ordered the teriyaki beef and chicken katsu. The chicken katsu was fine, overly-coated but normal. The teriyaki beef however, was to put it plainly, putrid. It tasted as if the beef was spoiled. The owner was kind enough to replace it with another item of our choice, but it was difficult to remove the taste from our mouths.\n\nWhile the price of the food is cheap and portions are reasonable, I don't think I would be able to bring myself to visit again considering the teriyaki beef.

We finally saw this place and honestly, I was relatively skeptical about whether or not I was going to like this place but alas, SQwers has completely won me over.\n\nFirst things first, service is perfectly fine. Yes, the man helping you is curt but I've noticed that he's the only one actually manning all the tables. The other guy there, I believe is their delivery person and only fills water. I don't think there was anything wrong with his service, he just provides what you need. It may be a cultural issue that you are experiencing if you thought the man was rude.\n\nNow onto the food. Their price point is relatively low for what they serve. I think the nirgiri and the yakitori was well worth the money. Now to be fair, I didn't spend a lot of time with their sashimi/raw items because yes, I am a sushi snob and would be fearful to do it and because bento boxes were cheaper and at the moment, I felt like having a \"cheap meal\".\n\nThere is a nice reason to dine-in, which is there are signs all over the place for the specials (such as their $1 yakitori sticks!) and their lesser-known fish nigiris (whelkfish and needlefish, whatwhat!).\n\nTheir skewers were not the best I've ever had, but the best I've definitely ever had for $1! The insanity! There was a good selection, lacking for an Izakaya but good enough for a sushi restaurant. The nigiris were relatively good, not much I can say about this one as I've never had whelkfish or needlefish before.\n\nThe bento box, while a good value, had some major issues. The fish was severely overdone and so was the pork. It's as if someone had accidentally left it on the stove too long but I feel like that's an easily remedied problem.\n\nAll in all, I would still suggest SQwers (which doesn't actually have that many yakitori items) for a quick and relatively cheap sushi meal!", "author": "Win\u00e8 C."}

Found a parking space right in front, but was grossed out because the other car parked right in front of the place had bird crap all over it and around the sidewalk.\n\nSuddenly what little appetite I had was gone.\n\nThis is one of those places where there is a big menu of all kinds of selections, but then there are little signs all over the place with their specials.  I decided to keep it simple with sashimi over rice.  Others had tempura and other sushi selections.\n\nThe service was very personal as there was only one other family there with a little kid who ate mini hot dog weenies with a toothpick (so I guess you can say they are kid friendly).\n\nIn the end, the price was right, the sushi and rolls were just okay and I give it the 2nd star just for the personable service. I'd say that if you want sushi, aren't a sushi snob and don't care about ambiance, and don't believe sushi should be really expensive, then this is the neighborhood sushi place for you.  This place just didn't make me want to come back for anything.  There are lots of other sushi places along Geary that I'd rather go to for just-okay sushi experiences.", "author": "Erik H."}

Both were incorrect.\n\nLooking past my disdain for mayo it made the cucumber wrapped creation soggy.

Portion sizes were thoughtful and the rolls were not ridiculously overdone with too many combinations of Western influence that some restaurants serve.  They had quality ingredients that complemented each other.\n\nI also got a free roll because of the total cost of the order.  Usually, the free roll is the Dynamite Roll.  Since I already had one, I asked if I could have a different one.  He said California Roll and, although I'm not a huge fan by any means, the offer itself was nice and I wasn't going to haggle something that was really a gift.\n\nI look forward to being a hoody regular and that they are able to be successful in this location.", "author": "Tamar D."}

These people deliver sushi. Could you ask for anything more?\nI ended up braving the winter cold and walking the 5 minutes through the USF campus to Geary to get sushi at 8PM on a Saturday. It was magical. There was a lively party in there that kept taking sake bombs with some of the staff. The staff was really nice and laughed at my boyfriend and I when we ordered the 30pc. sashimi (for 39.99!) because they didn't think we could handle that, a roll, complimentary soup, and a seaweed salad. They obviously don't know us at all.\nThe sashimi was fresh and amazing and all of the other dishes we saw come out to other tables looked great! I can't wait to come back to try other things.\nI am not one to support random sushi places because they have OK food and are cheap. I will go the extra mile and spend the $100 on a dinner for two because I want fresh raw fish.\nThis definitely has me rethinking my strategy. They aren't cheap enough to scare me away with random baked rolls and weird Americanized names. They are authentic while maintaining a student's pricepoint. \nIt is dangerous that they are so close to where I stay in the city. Sashimi for me, all day everyday.", "author": "Jenna R."}

There's only one major roll in this order. I watched as the order was received within seconds of being sent. The order was estimated 20 minutes to be done, standard.\n\nI came in at 20 minutes on the dot and was told that the food isn't ready. Okay, so I awkwardly stood there. I was thinking \"it's just 1 major roll, shouldn't take long. I wasn't expecting a plus service or anything, like being given a cup of tea or water. But a little goes a long way.\n\nThere was two sushi chefs, 1 male worker (the boss im assuming) and a woman. The woman kept walking, bussing tables, then sitting back down at a big table. I'm assuming they had customers that were family friends that day. She barely even looked at me.\n\nSo after standing there for 15 MINUTES (meaning its been 35 MINUTES since I placed the order), I just told the bus lady I'm leaving. This was beyond ridiculous. How is it that sushi was continuously being pumped from two sushi chefs to tables and not me, standing there, who ordered 30 minutes ago. It does NOT TAKE 15 MINUTES to make ONE SUSHI ROLL.\n\nI had to go through Eat24 Customer service to get a refund. To think that I even wanted to tip 10% for a pick up order (which isn't mandatory). I wasn't even acknowledged ONCE after I was told my order wasn't ready. It's very upsetting that a place like this, that I felt was really great, irked me so bad like this. I'm never coming back.

Try the spicy sake if you like spicy - but beware if you've got sensitive tastebuds!", "author": "A N."}

I read the reviews and was anxious to try a place that we could order from frequently.  We did this on GrubHub, who gave us a credit, but the restuarant did not apologize or offer up anything - we will just not order or recommend them.

Let's talk about the food: their sqwers,  which they are known for,  are flavored &  in generous portions.  Their chicken gizzards &  hearts are seasoned well,  &  you find yourself ordering more than one order.  Their sushi rolls are delicious -  lion King &  winter Wonderland are our favorite &  the sauces are never over welcoming to the fresh fish.  Their ratio to rice & fish is great (not like other sushi places that give you more rice than fish). The atmosphere is the most welcoming -  lots of regulars come by &  the staff treat them as if they're family. It's a small restaurant so if you're thinking of bringing more than 4 people I'd definitely call for a heads up. Did I mention they have delivery  too? &  it doesn't take them 45 mins to respond to an order -  I see them pay close attention whenever they get online Orders.", "author": "Terri G."}

Some of the biggest calamari I ever had!\nTurnaround: Good. Felt quick, but that may just be the appetizers talking.\nService: Excellent. Only the bento orders get miso soup, but the lady gave all of us miso soup on the house.\n\nJapanese food is not cheap where a simple roll with barely any sashimi can average about $10. From the menu, the items were pretty normal and there were bento specials where you can get more than a full meal.  I had the unagi fried rice with soft shell crab and calamari for appetizers. First off, biggest calamari I ever had! Not much taste, but the texture was good and bouncy. The soft shell crab was also pretty big and meaty. None of that spiny crab stuff. The crab was also full of eggs, which is not my cup of tea, but I heard this makes the crab better. They also sell skewered chicken gizzards here. Definitely not my cup of tea, but just FYI. The unagi fried rice was good, but I think I will stick with the broiled eel donburi. Also, my friend ordered some teriyaki chicken and although I can see the meat, I could not discern any taste whatsoever. The teriyaki sauce was barely sweet and the meat was really just texture sliding across my tongue. The teriyaki salmon was much better. The tables are really small here so with the appetizers we ordered and the free miso soup for everyone, we quickly ran out of space. This was especially troublesome because the turnaround was pretty good and the food arrived almost at the same time. Most importantly though is that the lady who looks like she runs the shop kept coming over to help us clear the table. And like I said before, she gave all of us free miso soup on the house. That with the free edamame in the beginning makes this a good place to come again.", "author": "Jenny W."}

The food is good and prices aren't too bad but it's not that much better or cheaper than most neighborhood Japanese places.  The one thing that I did like is that the sushi rolls did not have a large amount of rice.   It was a good balance of tics and filling so that I could actually taste the filling and not just rice.   The tempura as crispy and not too oily. It was actually still hot, not just warm, when it arrived, which is rare.   I did not care for the ramen though.  I poke the slightly curly firm noodles.  This was a straight, white, chewy noodle. The broth wasn't rich, like  they should be for ramen. It was almost like a chicken soup base that you may get  with wonton noodles.", "author": "Heather G."}

It's a fairly new spot and run by a Chinese family, I think. It's nice that it's not very busy so you won't need to wait in line. They gave us free bowls of miso soup (not sure if that's a common thing or because we were a big group). They have a fairly extensive menu of sushi's, skewers, and soup noodles at a fair price. I usually go for the godzilla roll. Their gyoza are probably the frozen kind, so don't order them. Their sushi is pretty decent, a good balance of fish and rice and good presentation. If you order tempura, they give a pretty big basket of them. The dinner set is not worth it in my opinion, they give you a sad pile of salad and rice, and the teriyaki chicken tastes bland.

Tiger roll.  it was basically california roll with cooked shrimp on top... the shrimp were like little films of plastic stuck on top and ordinary imitation crab in the middle, if it wasn't for the avocado it would be hard to swallow.  WHY would you put that on the specials menu!  As a decent sushi chef you would try to tell the customer to order something else instead...salmon skin roll was really salty and fishy so obviously not the freshest.  The chef's sashimi 10 piece was just ok and borderline fresh.  The slicing of the fish weren't professional-- skin were not cleanly removed from the salmon, and the chunks were inconsistent.  Food would be 2 stars but 1 more star for the nice waiter and service.   \n\nRestaurant is tough business in SF but please don't let go so early in the game.
