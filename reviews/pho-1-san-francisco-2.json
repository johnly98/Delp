This time I couldn't stand the unacceptable rudeness for me and my party.\n\nWe ordered our soups and drinks as usual.

Waiter points at the two hot tea and said \"hot tea\" is right there so angrily. I nicely ask him that  I wanted water since I was super thirsty. He was so rude about asking for water but I shrugged it off\n\nThroughout my whole dinning experience you can hear all of the servers be so rude during the slowest time of the day. I don't understand why you have to give the customers a hard time ordering or asking questions. \n\nThey demand cash and they eagerly take away the checkbook from you. They rudely hates it when you ask for something little like a fork or extra lime.

We weren't even done with our meal and at that point I just wanted to leave.\n\nI used to come here a lot during my high school/college days but I find comfort in other pho locations.

If this was 10 years ago, it might warrant more stars.

The chicken is tender and juicy. The broth is light, a tad on the tamer side, but add a little bit of lime, jalapenos and hoisin or sriracha and you are good to go.\nThe bun rieu (crab tomato noodle) and bun bo hue (spicy beef ) were both good. \nThe imperial rolls were ok, crispy but pretty standard. \nOverall the place is good and I will visit if in the area.

Pho ga (chicken) is my staple, and this place hasn't come close to being beat as far as how tasty it is. This place tends to infuse Chinese influences into their Vietnamese dishes, so it's mainly served northern style, though they will bring sprouts and basil if you ask. You can get a few variants of the ga, with slightly different broth (one version has more shallots and onion-y taste), and different noodles. I tend to get their standard pho ga, which has a mix of white and dark meat (probably mostly dark though), and the wide, flat rice noodles. DELISH.\n\nThe ambiance leaves something to be desired, and it isn't terribly fancy inside whatsoever, but it's clean, well run, and they are pretty organized and handle large parties capably. Note that this is one of those Asian restaurants that frequented mostly by Asians, which is generally a good sign that the food is legit. You see the occasional anglo, latino, or Af American, but mostly, it's straight up Asian. Beware that it's cash only, and depending on time of day, the street parking can be a pain. Dinner time, once the meters expire, actually is a better time to come, regardless of day of the week, since a lot of the businesses on San Bruno close for the day at dinnertime (meaning less competition for meters and street parking in general).", "author": "Rod V."}

He said yeah they use a lot of salt and msg.  I was some what skeptical.\n\nThis was at 12:45 pm, so the place was jam packed.  The place was very busy for sure, all kinds of people come to eat, white ppl, some hispanics too but 80% Chinese customers.  We speak cantonese and mandarin so ordering was quick and no problem  They can seem understaffed and the workers try very hard to keep up.  I don't have any issues with this what so ever.  You just have to be polite and demanding in order to get your order in quickly.  :)  It's a balance act.\n\nI had to drive up from Daly City (just 3 miles away from the pho shop) to Petaluma to borrow a tow vehicle from my friend.  It was only about 1:45 pm by the time I started to head up but traffic was starting to get heavy.  I started to dozing off by about 2:45 pm and had to pull over and sleep.  When I woke up from my power nap 10 minutes later I was super thirsty and the food coma was a heavy hit.  They really must have use a bit of msg, or salt, or both.

That being said, the broth at Pho #1 is non-standard.  It's not what you have come to love and expect from a quality bowl of pho and that is its downfall.  That and the fact that they did not bother to cut their spring rolls so we just ended up getting two super long rolls.  \n\nThat in itself is not a big issue but on top of the decidedly off-target broth, it's evident that Pho #1 is sort of a love it or hate it kind of place.  You either love their taste and what they have or, like me, you go to a pho place for a very specific flavor profile supported by the countless pho restaurants in San Jose.  Pho #1 is outside that profile by a significant margin.\n\nThe search for SF Pho continues.", "author": "Chris C."}

As soon as I opened the door, a lady immediately showed up and asked \"For here or to go?\" Inner-monologue, i was like \"Damn, that was fast.\" She had a Viet accent but I think spoke some dialect of Cantonese to her coworkers. I walked in to sit down, got a glass of jasmine tea (different, but whatever, i get more).  I open the menu and see that they do mostly chicken pho, which is only slightly unusual. The weird part is they have SNAIL MEAT PHO, LOL. One of these days I have to try that. I chose my usual beer pho instead. ***You have the option of thin or thick noodows***\n\nIt came out in a matter of minutes. Only got jalapeno peppers and lime. No basil or mint. That it a no-no because sometimes the pho broth has a \"wet dog\" smell to it. It may be hard for some of you to believe, but it's not necessarily a bad stench. Anyways, this had a distinct wet dog smell. The lime helped, but mint leaves would be better. Noodle texture good, the taste of the broth was alright but gradually became too salty for me (and i tend to like a little oomf to my pho broth). Beef and beef balls were good.

Many restaurants on San Bruno aren't even close to being a Favorite, but it is mediocre enough for me to come back to. This place isn't too bad but I just dislike that their broth is a bit greasy. I like to get the #14 small ($5.95) with is pho with rare beef, cooked beef, and meatballs. It's northern style here, so no basil or bean sprouts! \n\nMy dad really likes their ox tail noodle soup, but just by looking at it, it was greasy looking and not something I appreciate :( The rest of their food here is just okay.

The chicken was tender but they use the flat noodles (I prefer the round ones) and they were already very soft when they hit the table. I prefer the places where the noodles have clearly just been placed in the broth and you have to wait a couple minutes while they soften up. The Imperial Rolls were light and crispy.

I had sworn off this restaurant after a bad experience last December, but when a past acquaintance spotted me recently and called out my name then suggested we grab lunch at this restaurant I was more than happy to oblige.\n\nOkay so maybe I was a bit over dramatic in my last update.  A restaurant is allowed to have one bad dish.  Am I right?  Fine.  With that said don't ever order the chicken curry with rice.  Trust me on that.  My old friend told me she liked this restaurant and had eaten here several times in the past.  She said she especially enjoyed the fresh fruit drinks the kitchen whirls up.\n\nThe service was excellent as usual.  The warm greeting, the menus in our hands, the cups of hot tea on our table our waitress returned in minutes to take our order.  My friend couldn't decide between the pho or the bun, so I suggested we order one of each and share them.  We had a large Pho Tai Chin Nam (well-done beef and rare beef noodle soup) and the Bun Cha Gio Thit Nuong (grilled BBQ pork and imperial roll vermicelli).  She ordered some frou-frou looking fruit drink that I didn't catch the name of.  I think it was their mango puree.\n\nThe food was on our table within minutes.  My friend thought it was odd that I asked to take a photo of each dish.  She inquired whether I worked for the health department or for a rival restaurant.  She had no idea what Yelp was as my explanation had her seemingly puzzled.  Why not just eat the food?  Why do you write about it too?  \n\nHere's what we got.  The Pho (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/xScGXSwZXXkhwlc-cJc1pw/l) and the Bun (http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/BYC-txiCFmN0qp7_IlQ-fA/l) came out in big, deep round bowls.  My friend suggested the portions seemed larger than when she dined alone.  I'm not a big fan of raw red onions.  I was so happy to see my friend scoop off most of the rings of red onion and put it into her bowl.  The thin slices of beef in the Pho were generous in portion size and tasted okay.  The medium width rice noodles were abundant and soft, but I detected the sting of MSG in the broth.  There was enough of it to make me switch my attention to the Bun.  I got in under the mound of cold soft rice vermicelli to get to the shredded lettuce, basil, cucumber strips and bean sprouts.  All of the vegetables were fresh and crispy.  The noodles were nice and chewy.  The thinly sliced grilled pork was tender and had a slight sweetness to it.  The imperial roll was good.  I especially liked that in addition to the crushed peanuts and the sauteed green onion, they added some deep fried onion bits to the top of the dish.  I thought the fried onion enhanced the dish quite well.\n\nAs we ate we engaged in small talk seeing what each of us had been up to over the years, and when we finished eating we went through the entire Chinese ritual of fighting to see who pays the bill.  I suggested that although I was all for equality a good male friend never lets a female friend pay for lunch.  She was cool with that, and I got the bill.\n\nAs we exited the restaurant we stood outside and exchanged our contact information.  It was at that time that she reminded me what her name is because she knew I was clueless to that throughout our lunch.  I felt a bit embarrassed that she knew that all along.  I can be such a doof sometimes!", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

This time I ordered the rare steak noodle, which was not on the menu. For some reason, their tai is with cooked and rare steak. Sounds weird, but I just ordered the rare steak. It was not placed on a separate plate, but it was still pink and NEVER went dry or overcooked as it bathed in my noodle soup the whole time. The soup was warm to hot, so it was a bit of a surprise that my beef didn't get all wrinkly and dry. Very high quality beef that was thick and tender. One thing that does bother me a bit is that they don't give out bean sprouts here (just onions & green onions in the soup w/ the jalapeno and lime to the side). Although I ordered the small this time and it looked small, its contents weren't. It took a while for me to finish, and I was pretty full by the time I got done.\n\nThe service was basically like most Chinese/Vietnamese restaurants. Not much service indeed, but pleasant enough. I saw the worker continuously wiping the walls and all.\n\nThis place was clean and neat. They probably tried to go modern with the walls painted green, but didn't quite make it. The dull pinkish red molding/trim absolutely gave the place an Asian feel. The plastic lights on top definitely added to that feel. But they do have some cute decor that reminded me a bit of Penang Garden. Flatscreen tv near the back that plays old school Chinese and Vietnamese music. \n\nI also ordered the papaya salad with beef and it was definitely not the best I've had. The dish looked colorful enough, but almost too colorful. If I hadn't known that I ordered a papaya salad or what a papaya salad was, I would think its some kind of mixed salad (for there was almost the same amount of cabbage as there were papaya and the shredded carrots following). The salad was also mixed with a generous amount of nuts and flaky little crunchy things (never knew what those were called). The 4 shrimp chips were random and again, very Asian. The papaya shreds could've been cut more thoroughly, for lots of it stuck together in a big chunk. There was also no TANG to the dish, when there should be. This was almost a miss, but I managed to finish almost all of it cause I love green papaya!\n\nThey also gave me a free egg custard dessert afterward and it was pretty good. It reminded me of the ones my mom used to buy/make for me when I was a kid. I hope that's not their version of creme brulee though. Ha. Yummy indeed.\n\nPrices - very good. \nPlace - very clean.\nService - like any other Viet/Chinese restaurant.\nFood - noodles are definitely a hit, but not so much the salad.", "author": "Elaine H."}

Now, granted this place is only a few days old so I'll give it time for them to improve on the service and the taste....but I am still excited to have more variety of food in this neighborhood.

I tried their Bun Bo Hue since I got there late and the ladies were already having their Pho Ga and made me try something else.  \n\nFor their Pho Ga...i'll say it's pretty decent but the broth is a little off, it can use a little bit more seasoning.  As for the Bun Bo Hue, their broth was good. Very filling and very meaty.  I jokingly complained to the owner that it wasnt spicy enough, owner jokingly told me to add more chili sauce, dipshit.  They also have the charbroiled pork with vermicelli and egg rolls that he recommend I try next time I'm there.......yes sir!  The typical vietnamese dessert drinks, grass jelly, three star mix and milkshakes make up the rest of the menu.\n\nNow I know the owner of this place for quite a while.  He was the chef at \"the Window\" and her sister is running the \"little window\" pho place off of Noriega.  I know in due time the broth will taste just right and things will definitely taste great......tastes good now...but will taste great soon.   Will most definitely come back here and try their other dishes.  Service was not up to par yet.....most of the waitresses have A.D.D. and are lost most of the time.

So we decided to try this place since it was close to our fellow shooter's home and we can conveniently drop him off home afterward.  What was ordered:\n\nSpring Roll filled with shrimp and pork - well wrapped but no flavor, worst than bland.  How is that even possible, I have no idea.  I suppose they assume you can drink the accompanied peanut hoisin sauce, which was watered down, you can't even taste the sauce.  \n\nFried Chicken - another bland dish.  All this dish was, was just the name.  No seasoning or anything.  Fried right and not greasy, but blah.  \n\nCurry Chicken with Bread - the flavor of the curry sauce was actually nice, but the chicken and bread Not.  I can tell that the chicken meat tasted weird and not quality grade.\n\nBun Ouc/Sea Snail Rice Noodle Soup - You don't get this dish in most Vietnamese restaurant, so I just have to have it.  It was nicely prepared with generous amount of sea snails but lacking the fragrant herb and spice flavors as far as authenticity.    They also used canned tomatoes, which was not as good as fresh tomatoes.  It was overall okay.\n\nService sucks they brought out the appetizers 20 minutes after the entrees came out.  The entrees were 10 minutes apart from one another.  As you may imagine, not fun watching someone else eat first and half finish before yours arrive or have their food get cold, if they so choose to wait to eat with you.

I have no idea of the authenticity level of the food they serve at Pho# 1. All I can say, is the grilled barbecue beef with noodles, #30 on the menu, is so good! It is such a nice alternative to fast food. For under $7.00, you get delicious barbecue beef over noodles, with fresh mint, bean sprouts and cucumbers. The meat is so good, with no fat, that is the best part. The food is fresh and tasty, not greasy. I would love to see a little more meat on my plate, this is why the 4 star rating. Other than that, this place is delicious. I order it to go, as the restaurant is not the most cozy. I would rather curl up at my house to enjoy.", "author": "Keri V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-08-02", "description": "This place specializes in chicken pho and is a little different from the usual pho place.  First of all, if you are a bean sprout fan just like I am, you might not like it here because they claim they are some regional vietnamese food that bean sprouts and the usual herbs are not suppose to be eaten with the noodles.  The kind of noodles they use are also different.  It is softer and wider.  Some might like it but I prefer the regular pho noodles that has a chew to it.  The broth actually tasted good and was flavorful.", "author": "Heidi F."}

Though the noodles are not the same as most southern Pho, the soup was good.  The broth was flavorful and not greasy.  The beef was tender but I only got 2 beef balls.  I will definitely return for the quail or claypot.  There are no decent Pho places south of the Tenderloin and this place is almost as good.  Place is clean and staff is friendly. Plus they serve beer.  Cash only", "author": "May M."}

Vermicelli with BBQ beef with fresh veggies. Me and my husband always finds a way to eat here regardless of the weather. One problem though, I must fight with every other asian person trying to get parking on San Bruno Avenue. If you live around this area, best to walk or take the bus.", "author": "Anonymous P."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-12-26", "description": "It's a different type of Pho, which I'm not commonly eaten. It's Pho Bac, which they called it and the noodles are thicker and thin. The Soup base is extremely SALTY. I can literally drink an full cup water afterward and still have that MSG sting in the back of my throat. If the Pho isn't so salty, then my meal would taste great. I can still smell the nice aroma of the seasonings in my mouth, but SALTINESS has to GO. People are intake lower sodium these days, and this isn't a great place for Low Sodium diet person, nor regular person's diet", "author": "n a."}

Dinner for 3 came out to $30 something.", "author": "Merredith L."}
