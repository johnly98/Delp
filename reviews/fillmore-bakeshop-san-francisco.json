Came here with the bf on a trip exploring SF. \n\nYum I got the peach tart and a chocolate chip cookie and the bf got the almond croissant and the meringue cookie. All were delicious. I love the tart. I do not know what the bottom filling on the tart was but it was amazing. So flavorful and creamy perfect to go with the sweetness of the peaches. \n\nThey had a lot of options to chose from their expansive display counter of both sweet and savory treats. Kind of a small space but it's okay. Definitely will go back. My bf and I already decided before finishing our treats.", "author": "Denice D."}

They have pies, cakes, pastries, cookies, and everything in between.  This time we decided on a slice of cake and something new.  Both were surprisingly delicious!  \n\nWe almost got the princess cake but decided on something new so we ordered the Chocolate-Salted Caramel Mouse Cake.  Two layers of mouse, salted caramel on the top and chocolate at the bottom with soft moist cake layers in between, then it's covered with more chocolate.  It's so good I wish we ordered two.  I love the salted caramel chocolate mouse combo.  \n\nWe also ordered the Hazelnut Ring.  It's hazelnut butter cookie, hazelnut cream, hazelnuts and dark chocolate.

(And I love pastries!!) \n\nToday I was a little early for a haircut next door and so popped my nose in and was shocked at what amazing things this little store was hiding inside. Slices of beautiful Swedish princess cake (whole ones too), clearly perfectly laminated golden fluffy butter croissants, candied orange and apricots dipped in chocolate, cherry pie filled to the brim with dark red cherries... I could go on and on. Oh, did I mention they also have kouign amann and coconut macaroons?? \n\nI grabbed a piece of too many things to list, and I have to say the Swedish princess cake is perfectly made. The cream and custard are light and discernible, and the Genoese sponge is fluffy beyond belief. Perfect, perfect layers!

I've been here frequently over the past few years, and I think the quality of their baked goods is still great. I tend to go for their simpler items like cookies, pie slices, or smaller sweets like a chocolate-covered marzipan, and I usually leave with my sweet tooth satisfied. \n\nHowever, I noticed that service can sometimes be mixed. When the bakery gets busy, it seems like some employees get frazzled, which makes them less polite toward customers. I was never significantly bothered by this fact until today, when I wanted to confirm a type of cookie on display. It visibly looked like it was made with gingerbread but the sign said it was a sugar cookie. When I confirmed with the employee that the sign was incorrect and suggested changing the signs to avoid future confusion, her stare was eviscerating and her response was curt. Did this stop me from getting a snack? No, but I have a feeling I won't be back anytime soon.", "author": "Keith H."}

I will come here just for the bread pudding from now on. The last time I went, they did not make bread pudding, and I was so upset!! The custard that binds the bread pieces together along with the freshly baked cinnamon apple slices married together so well in my mouth.

(I say \"international\" because a bakery in London now offers these.) And just the other day I was finally able to experience them by way of Fillmore Bakeshop. Although, I initially was not interested in tasting anything other than the original, I figured I would never wake up at the buttcrack of dawn while on one of my NYC trips to stand in such a long line at Dominque Ansel's for just a chance to get one. So I \"settled\" for one of these \"tribute\" versions and wow was it fantastic!\n\nYesterday morning at about 8:15 (this is early for us for a Saturday morning), we queue'd in the frigid, drizzly, gusty morning with passer by-ers throwing confused glances our way. Some time later, we finally had a box of half a dozen cronuts in our hot little hands - 4 cinnamon and 2 lemon custard. \n\nAs soon as we got back into the car we dove right into the box and took a bite out of the most delectable pastry I've probably ever had in my life. Buttery with flaky innards like any great croissant would have and deep fried to an ideal golden exterior. The lemon custard was not too tart which i liked. \n\nIt was probably more a croissant than a doughnut as the only doughnut-like aspect that it had was its shape and that it is deep fried. But I think I prefer it this way. I hear the original is more dense and more doughnutty. \n\nDespite the huge spike of customers that are pouring in all the employees remained in good spirits and the owner really seemed to have a good sense of humor. While in line I had a chance to see the other baked goods they offered and they also looked great. Perhaps I'll have to pick up something else here besides the cronut but I'm hoping they'll be a permanent fixture behind their glass counters. \n\nNext week's flavor: salted caramel.

The cronut itself was warm, flaky, and perfectly balanced in terms of sweetness. It's also not too big, so I would definitely recommend getting 2 per person.\n\n I actually much more prefer this cronut over the ones in New York, because custard fillings can get overly rich and messy.

But, with so many other bakeries in the city that sell macarons (Chantal Guillon, Tout Sweet Patisserie, and multiple La Boulanges) why make the effort to go all the way to Pacific Heights? Then, I heard that they made cronuts. Although I never tried cronuts from the originating bakery, Dominique Ansel Bakery in New York, I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the ones from Fillmore Bakeshop.\n\nThe day I visited, two flavors of cronuts were available: cinnamon sugar and peaches & cream. Both were delicious, with fluffy and soft layers in the center and a crispy outer shell. I preferred the cinnamon sugar though, mainly because it was simpler and not as sweet. Also, the peaches & cream flavor was just a plain cronut with peach-flavored custard piped into the center hole, making it messy to eat when you reach the center. But nevertheless, Fillmore Bakeshop is one of the very few bakeries in SF that offer these ever-so desirable, high-calorie-filled, tasty pastries. I wonder what unusual, crazy hybrid of pastries bakeries will conjure up next.\n\nOn the other hand, I wasn't as impressed with the macarons. The outer shells were too crispy, so they crumbled easily and were an absolute mess to eat. I was unimpressed with the mocha and lavender flavors, but did enjoy the pineapple rum and strawberry ones. Although decent in taste, presentation was sub par. The almond meal isn't fine enough, so the cookies are a little bumpy and lopsided. But for price to portion ratio, Fillmore Bakeshop probably has one of the best deals in the city at $1.95 per macaron, yet not at the best quality.\n\nThe interior is very bright, clean, and simple. I love the open kitchen, being able to watch the bakers prepare all the cakes, pastries, and cookies. The window decor is cute. However, there are only a couple of tables inside.

The customer service is exceptional and I'm always happy to talk and order from the sweet ladies behind the counter :) \n\nDefinitely a 5-Star, class act type of place that is very well taken care of by the employees and the owners.

I have tried the hip and trending and award-nominated others and keep coming back here. It is my definition of a Bakery; pastries, cookies, cakes, etc... And the chocolates and coffee are additional yummies. It is a BAKE shop not a fry shop so, although I too enjoyed a cronut or old-fashioned donut once in a while, I understood when they decided not to replace the old fryer when it broke. It is certainly not a reason not to frequent this place as they have more than enough delicious caloric edibles to make you happy!! They take great pride in their pastries and candies and cakes and every day there is something new and fresh. I love the way the owners/bakers experiment and try new goodies (can you say crispy twist full of ham and cheese or hotdog in phyllo?!)\nHolidays are extra special with hand-poured chocolates and traditional European holiday treats. \nThere are busy days when it's pretty much choose, pay and wave goodbye and there are calmer days when the workers are able to chat a minute. Again, I don't hold it against anyone when they need to focus on their work. They are baking and creating the entire time you are licking your lips and trying to decide what you \"need\" to eat. I have always gotten smiles and prompt friendly service. \nAs for coffee with crema art, give me a break hipster, go to the home of cappuccino (Italy) and see if they give you crema art!! Really?? \nIf you want consistently fresh delicious baked goods and many options to choose from, Fillmore Bakeshop is your bakery. I'll see you there!!", "author": "Laura M."}

On the first day of sunshine after a week of rain, it only added to my happiness this morning.\n\nYep, we're still on the hunt for the best chocolate chip cookie in the bay.  I couldn't find a plain CCC (chocolate chip cookie) here, only a double CCC or a CCC with pecans. I opted for the one with pecan, and it only set me back $1.50. The cookie is thin and has a ton of mini chocolate chips. The chip to batter ratio is at least 1:1. The cookie was pretty good, but not the best we've tried. Even though it was thin it still retained some chewiness. \n\nI also impulsively bought a salted caramel macaron, even though I thought they looked too large and lumpy. $3.45 later, I was out the door with two treats.The salted caramel macaron is slightly misleading because it is lightly drizzled with dark chocolate and the filling has both dark chocolate and salted caramel.  I let boyfriend eat half and he LOVED it. I thought the flavor was great, although I wish the filling was all caramel and no chocolate.

Knock two birds with one stone, I say. \n\nThe cronuts or D's Nutz is what peeps line up for here at Fillmore Bakeshop.  We came one morning and they told us the cronuts are served at 9 AM.  Because we were only a few blocks away, we had no problem leaving and coming back. Of course, my gf got the cronuts and I sampled it.  You go through multiple experiences when you eat one of these.  First you get through the outer layer donut side of the force.  Sweet, crunchy, and tasty with a hint of cinnamon.  Then you get to the croissant side of the force, which is my favorite part.  The layers of the croissant expresses a light, moist, and tasty pastry that compliments the donut really well.

I chose to try the salted caramel, almond and vanilla. ALL WERE AMAZING! I was already full from lunch, so pleasing my taste buds on a full stomach means it's good.\n\nThe macaroon itself had a large shell with just the right texture - crunchy on the outside but soft and chewy on the inside. The filling for the salted caramel was amazing, swirls of carmel and whatever else they put in there...I highly recommend this flavor!\n\nI've read great reviews about the green tea, but those were coming out of the oven when we were there.

I hate that its becoming a weekly event to check their Facebook early on Saturday mornings for the new flavor and then journeying over to Fillmore to wait in line with my fellow suckers. But such is life. Best fake-cronuts in the city so far, and NO I HAVEN'T tried them all yet. Ok maybe.\n\nHaving tried the original one in nyc I must say I think Fillmore does a really good job. One thing it has over Dominique Ansel is that they serve them warm if you go early in the morning. 9ish. Warm cronuts are like warm Krispy Kreme on crack x100. I was disappointed with the new york version because I was used to Fillmore's warm and fresh version. Both have their pros. But it's def a great substitute until you make it to nyc. And less hassle. \n\nI will also mention their rotating bread puddings. Love it. Once I found a pecan in it though. They told me they use day-old pastries for it, so they may or may not contain nuts depending on what leftover pastries they have left. FYI just in case you are allergic.

I've explored lots of their menu and can still say almost everything is outstanding. \n\nThey just got a new espresso machine and can now do more drinks faster, so order away!\n\nThe pretzel croissant is the unsung hero of that bakery; it's more like an everything-bagel croissant and it's savory and nutty and flaky and amazing. I get one almost every time, and they're almost never sold out. \n\nCronuts are always good, they just started offering meringue cookies (!!), and on Saturday mornings the foccicias are still awesome (almost always have pesto-bacon, jalepeno, or artichoke). They've opened up their repertoire to a larger selection of cookies, candies, bites, and bars. The quiche lorraine has a beautiful texture and strong, real, swiss cheese and whole slices of bacon laced through it; rich and savory crust that doesn't fall apart when you bite into it. Morning buns and cinnamon-raisin snails are also lovely and never too sweet. \n\nNot everyone will love the style of macaron they do, but I still think they're good. Same goes for the danishes, which can be a little soggy later in the day (but that's any danish). And I feel like this is the only possible negative, and seems to be what most people try. As a regular, I'd say to taste more of the menu than just macarons and danishes -- ask the ladies at the register what's good right now and they'll always give you great recs.\n\nService is great, products are homemade and lovely, and I've only had stellar experiences with the staff.

Pistachio along with Blackberry, are the two that are my absolute favorite flavor of choice during the past few visits I've made here.  \n\nOn today's particular visit, I feasted on just the Mango which was deliciously sweet and tangy.

Of course I came for the special flavored cronut of the day (read all recent reviews for time and day for special flavors). I've had the cinnamon sugar, smores, coffee crunch, and cookies & cream. The best flavor is by far coffee crunch. Each special flavor is $3 or $3.50. If you haven't had a cronut, you should try at least one in your lifetime and if you're in the Bay Area, Fillmore Bakeshop should really be the place to try it. \n\nI've also tried the almond croissant, jalapeno focaccia, pumpkin pie, and blood orange macaron.\nThe almond croissant (3.5 stars) has a special type of almond paste with a slight flavor of orange zest to it. Mine had very little almond paste in it and was all to one side. I'm am almond croissant fanatic and was a little disappointed.\nJalapeno focaccia (4 stars) was cheesy and flavorful and was the perfect amount to hold me up for lunch. It is greasy though. HELLO PIMPLES!\nPumpkin pie (2 stars) was extremely bland and I wanted to shake some pumpkin pie spice over it. Expensive, I think about $4/slice, and not satisfying at all.\nBlood orange macaron (3 stars) had a nice texture, but I thought it was overly sweet and tasted like orange soda.\n\nThe staff is always friendly and it's entertaining to watch the bakers frosting cakes and making more cronuts (but a little disturbing when you see them dunking their entire hand into frosting-like ingredients and plopping it into the KitchenAid instead of using actual measuring cups). The only complaint I really have is to label all items. On Saturdays, the place is so lined up with cronut fanatics that it's difficult to find out what is what. There were many goodies that were not labeled and that led me to accidentally getting a slice of bland pumpkin pie (the pumpkin pie label was in front of focaccia bread and I thought it was a special ass type of pumpkin pie). \n\nBecause I've had so many cronuts in the past few weeks, it's time to go back to real donuts or croissants, but once Fillmore Bakeshop produces those coffee crunch ones, I'm running back! \n\nI hope they don't start making crappy cronuts cause this morning, the cookies and cream cronuts we got were undercooked and very doughy and chewy on the inside.", "author": "Cheryl Q."}

The day we went they were serving boysenberry bread pudding. I don't really like cooked berry anything in general, but this wasnt too bad. The perfectly sweet, thick, and smooth mouthfeel of the custard innards amazingly complements the crisp chunks of croissant.  The egg flavor really shines through, a delicious flavor you don't really get at bakery chains like La Boulange.\n\nThe almond croissant was a little too underbaked and lacking that foodgasmical textured flakiness that defines a croissant (Yes, I have to make up words when I write food reviews because my experiences and feelings cannot be expressed within the constraints of English), but the frangipane, which was oddly brown in color, was bursting with flavor. Ohhhh, so delish! \n\nThe three of us were pretty full after splitting these two pastries and downing a cuppa \"cuafee\" each, but my father couldn't resist trying another pastry. He tactfully selected an almond peach croissant, whose delicate flakiness and crispy edges made up for the plain almond croissant's breadiness.\n\nIn addition to the scrumptious pastries and baked goods, the staff was pleasant and the head baker (haven't formally met him yet) was very charming.

Obviously an 'everything to everyone' sort of place with French pastry lined up along favorites from the American Kitchen it should probably come as no surprise that items warm from the kitchen would prove amongst Fillmore's strongest and beginning there the croissant was a fairly good start with nature's subtlety replacing sticky frangipane amidst crispy curls and moving on to the brioche bun a similar crunch was found, though this time giving way to a springy buttered core liberally dressed in cinnamon sugar.  Saving cookies and 'pie' for later only to be underwhelmed in each it was last during my visit that my attention turned to the 'still-too-hot-too-eat' bread pudding and still my very favorite type of dessert no matter how 'simple' to prepare this particular version proved lovely - a big scoop fresh from the pan teaming with custard-laced old croissants, fresh bananas, and intense dark chocolate beneath a lightly toasted top.", "author": "Michael U."}

The macarons are big and beautiful (no matter how I rearrange those words, it still sounds funny... bear with me). There are so many bright, tantalizing colors and flavors. I got: rose, pistachio, and blood orange. The blood orange filling was really good. Pistachio was not bad.\n\nHere's the problem: all of them have HUGE air pockets in them. The shells are completely hollow. That's unacceptable! A macaron is NOT supposed to have air pockets. (See my pictures for more information.) Take it from a macaron lover and baker. When a macaron has huge air pockets, the shell shatters into a million pieces when you bite into it, instead of delicately crumbling into your mouth. It's crispy and hollow, instead of slightly crisp on the outside and soft and a little cakey inside. Also, the macarons were a tad dry- they would benefit from maturing overnight to let the flavors settle.\n\nI'll come back and try the croissants and other things, maybe they'll be better. The macarons were disappointing, though... I didn't think a professional bakery would have air pockets in all their macarons!!", "author": "Cathy S."}

Wu-Tang Clan aint' nuthin to fu** with!\n\nI head nodded my way in, and was greeted by a massive display of French Macarons, $1.95 a piece.  I don't want to be a mac snob, but I'm very specific about my macs.  They have to be the right size, taste like the flavor that it's actually labeled, the right amount of crunch and most importantly, the perfect amount of \"chew\". So when I reached the display case of macs, I noticed their macs were HUGE, at least 2 inches high.  Uh-oh.  I'm fighting 2 different feelings now.  I've never seen macs this size, and that already goes against one of my \"mac-do's\" criteria. On the other hand, they looked so volumptuous and interesting.   The first one that caught my eye was the coconut mac.  I'm a sucker for coconut.  SOLD.\n\nHow do I explain how perfect this mac was?  When I bit into it, there was a crunch.  Then air.  Then chewiness.  Then cream.  Then chewiness again.  Then bliss.  Yes, the size threw me off, but this mac was the red-headed step-child that won me over.  \n\nI also tried Chocolate, Pistachio, Almond, and Vanilla.  The chocolate was excellent, as was the pistachio.  They both had the same consistency as the coconut mac.  Unfortunately, the almond and vanilla were overbaked, and crumbled to sand and rocks at first bite.  But I'm not docking stars for that.  (I've learned from over countless bakery visits that certain batches of pastries are a hit or miss daily.)\n\nSo dare I say I found my new fave mac spot?

We came back an hour later and I had my first Fillmore cronut with a soy cappuccino:  heavenly!  The cronut was light, with flaky layers just like a croissant, and the cinnamon sugar dusting was just right.  I shared a bite with the b/f and then had to get another one-so good!  The shop wasn't too busy, but business was steady, with many customers there to get there cronut fix, too.  We came back on Saturday morning so the b/f could get an almond croissant and I had a pretzel, which was also just right.  Saturday mornings is when the Bakeshop offers special flavors of cronuts and there was a line out the door at 8:30am for the 9:00am batches.

They were divine to say the least. Tasty and flaky just like a croissant with the shape of a donut. I was lucky to try both of them and they were both good. If you have been looking for a donut wtih custard inside, the kronut with a custard filling does a good job as a parallel representation. The cinnamon sugar cronut was also very tasty reminiscent of a good sugar donut. The texture of the cronut was really nice, not too heavily deep fried and the layers and layers you'd find in a croissant are well made inside each kronut. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNOTE: they limit you to 4 PER PERSON AND THEY ONLY SERVE IT ON SATURDAYS between 9 and 10 am!*\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMacarons: The macarons weren't spectacular for me. The the outside layer was too airy and the filling was too creamy. The flavor was there but the nice contrast between layers wasn't particularly impressive. Not bad and not spectacular but still decent.\n\nApple Danish: The apple danish was delicious. From the moment I set my eyes on them, the apples looked remarkably fresh and the danish very nice, so I took a chance on them. The apples had a nice bite to them to contrast the soft texture of the pastry. The pastry was nice and flaky and the gooey apple center was a cherry on top.

The pistachio was lacking in any flavor other than sweet, with an almost imperceptible pistachio flavor. The chocolate hazelnut, on the other hand, was much tastier, and, surprisingly, less sweet. Both had those nice crunchy shells one expects from macarons, though the dough inside was ever-so-slightly chewy, which was somewhat unexpected (but not particularly bad either).\n\nWhen it comes down to it though, neither blew me away, and certainly not to the point of a $2 markup, especially when I can get much tastier, flavor bang for buck, baked goods elsewhere.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Scrumptious gooey chocolate.\n\n-Pistachio - Always a favorite no matter what bakery. Nutty great flavors, not too sweet, addictive.\n\n-Rose - I don't necessarily like tasting flowers, never been a fan of rose flavored products. But it's good enough for a recommendation here.\n\n-Mango - Tropical and sweet, however a bit too sweet for me.\n\n-Lemon - I noticed this flavor's quantity was running low, now I see why. Probably the best tasting macaron that has touched my tongue! Zesty and delicious. The cream is a perfect blend of sweet, lemony, and good gracious bodacious flavor! I've been craving it everyday.\n\nOverall, I probably prefer the outside cookie of the macaron at Paulettes, but the filling here is just dream cream!

For the last 4 months we have been planning our parent's 50th Golden Anniversary dinner which we held in the exact same room they celebrated their union 50 years ago (SF Presidio Officer's Club). After some miscommunication on who would handle the cake, I was frantic trying to find someone who could create a smaller version of their wedding cake based on a picture. I called the Fillmore Bakeshop and explained my story and Elena was so pleasant and very willing to help even at the last minute. I picked up the cake yesterday and all I can say is it brought my Mom to tears. The cake not only looked almost identical with all the intricate detailing and lace work but it tasted AMAZING!!!

If you're a fan of fondant and expertly crafted cakes in intricate designs, they have heaps of them and I'm fairly certain they take custom orders.

I swear to god I think this was it. \n\nThe owners are really nice. They never hesitate to say hello when their customers walk in the door. And even Yuddi (I think that's how you spell it), is the nicest guy. He was very helpful with questions and always has a great big smile on his face ready to help you. He made my soy latte right on point. They only make hot coffees, no iced... which made me sad on a nice warm day but I don't think I was bothered by it too much since my eyes were more on the treats!\n\nI think I'm a sucker for the macaroons in the blue look alike tiffany boxes with their hot soy lattes and decorative foam on the mug. I don't know how anyone can draw a leaf into my soy latte...it was too pretty to drink. I can't help it. Its pure heaven, pure decadence. This by far will be the reason I will constantly keep coming in... \n\nI have tried their croissants and they are fairly good as well, but its the macaroons hands down that win me.

Fillmore Bakeshop has been a must try on my agenda of sampling every macaroon in the city.\n\nFamily owned and operated, Fillmore Bakeshop has a cute little store front on Fillmore's lively shopping street. Service is attentive and friendly - I spent a good 15 minutes chatting with the owners on French macaroons and what makes their selection special. I found out they are one of the only Bay area bakeries that makes all of their french macaroons by hand (most other bakeries now mass-produce this confection). Made from the finest ingredients and piped with fresh buttercream filling,  Fillmore Bakeshop's treats are larger than most. Eating one of their cookies will take you more than a few bites. They offer a wide selection of flavors in all sorts of fun colors. I chose to try the classic Almond macaroon with fresh almond buttercream. The texture was unlike any other macaroons I have sampled - different and delicious. While I didnt find the flavor to be as intense as other macaroons, the fresh almond buttercream filling really made the cookie standout. I cant wait to go back to try their bright green pistachio macaroon and fluffy meringue - those treats look simply divine!\n\nTo try a macaroon thats homemade and heavenly, get your butt over to Fillmore street.

If you really want a cookie pick-me-up in the middle of the afternoon, I only have two words for you: Hazelnut Sable.  It may not look as frou-frou as those colorful macarons, but this cookie is seriously one of the best combination of flavors and textures I've ever tasted (and I've been to Paris, bitches).  It's nutty, crispy, crumbly, sweet, soft (but not too soft, more like firm), and has that perfect amount of smooth dark chocolate at the very end.  Oh, and they serve glasses of milk too. :-)\n\nAs for other items in this lovely bakeshop, I had a friend in from NYC visit recently who hadn't had a real marzipan Princess Cake since he was a child, and the only bakery in NYC that did it closed when he was 12.  Upon tasting Fillmore Bakeshop's *real* marzipan Princess Cake, he proclaimed it just as good if not better than the cake of his childhood.  And how could he not? It's the perfect combo of tasty marzipan, light cake, whipped cream, and raspberry jam.   Perfect for special occasions or when your friend from NYC is getting on your nerves and you eat a slice before giving him the rest of the cake.\n\nLastly, Fillmore Bakeshop may not be as precious or avante-garde as Citizen Cake or Miette, but quite honestly SF has enough of those places anyway.

I had no idea that Delanghe Patiserrie had closed shop!   Today during my wanderings I noticed the very cute Fillmore Bakeshop in its place.  \n\nI actually was wanting lunch, but couldn't resist the colorfulness of the shop and had to drop in.  \n\nI'm a huge cupcake-a-holic, who has recently acquired a fancy for LES MACARONS and chocolate truffles (thanks to my dear friend, Fred); therefore, it may not be so surprising that I was drawn IMMEDIATELY to the clear glass case filled with macarons, truffles and slices of cake. I peered like a CHILD, with wide eyes on Christmas morning, at the baked goods in front of me.\n\nIn the end, I settled for what sounded and looked the most delicious to me:  the salted caramel chocolate mousse cake.  I also ordered a cup of black coffee (sans room for cream) and a morning bun to carry home for later.  \n\nI was literally SALIVATING with excitement to try the cake and I was NOT disappointed!    The salted caramel chocolate mousse cake was melt in my mouth delicious decadence!  The mousse was airy and light and not overly sweet.  The icing on the cake was firm and perfectly juxtaposed the texture of the mousse in my opinion. Plus the salt on the icing added depth and perfect contrast to the chocolate sweetness and balance to the caramel, which is present in subtle hints within the icing. Most importantly, the cake is moist and the slice is exactly the RIGHT size for a tasting, but not too much that there are leftovers ;-).\n\nPS - the coffee is WONDERFUL. Not too strong and perfect sans cream for those coffee drinkers who want to shave off unnecessary calories from cream/milk. Also, dark, it complements the sugar present in the dessert for perfect balance!\n\nFor a slice of the cake, a regular sized cup of coffee, & a morning bun, I spent around $11.  I also purchased some freshly made coconut macaroons at $1/piece. \n\nI just ate the morning bun, which was covered with granulated sugar on the outside with a hint of cinnamon layered on the inside, which was not overpowering heavy and would have paired greatly with a cup of coffee.  \n\nWhile I was there, several women walked in raving about their coconut macaroon, so I had to purchase some.  I tried the coconut macaroon, which was crispy on the outside and flakey, sweet coconut on the inside. For me, this dessert was a little too sweet for my liking.\n\nI'm very happy to have found this cute, family owned bake-shop near my apartment.

The pastries are beautiful to look at, even more delicious to taste, and will not fill you up because there are no extra fillers. This is the real thing. One of my favs being veggie is the Mushroom Spinach Quiche, but you have to go early because this puppy flies out the door. The quiche is light and leaves me wanting more. I take this as a good sign. Wanting is always better than moving on... in anything.\n\nWhat Sealed the Deal: Elena & Uri(yup probably spelled that incorrectly) are always amazing and great conversationalists and although that woud be enough on top of all the amazing pastries, there was one thing that pushed us over to lifers....the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake.... Oh it's far beyond amazing and absolutely one of the most beautiful cakes I have ever seen. This cake is a must try at least once. We took it to my partner's birthday and it was a huge hit. Probably should not be eating it almost a week later, but it was too good to let go of...\n\nSo, if you have not tried this place out, it is well worth it. Go early or you may miss out on some gems.

Yellow cake/chocolate frosting/\"butterfinger-like\" topping cupcake: The fiance inhaled it. He reluctantly asked if I wanted a bite, so I took a small taste. Any bigger than a small taste and I think he would have cried. I'm not really a big fan of peanuts so I can't give a fair review, but the chocolate frosting was very smooth and not too sweet...it almost tasted like whipped pudding. YUM.\n\n3.

Happened to walk in on their Wednesday opening this week, chatted with both the daughter (Elena) and her dad, who own/run this place.  Tried:\nChocolate Ganache Cookie (which has some German sounding name I can't recall):  two light buttery chocolate cookies with a smoosh of chocolate ganache in the center, not too sweet, really lovely.  Oatmeal Raisin Cookie:  excellent texture, perfect amount of ingredients, appropriately chewy.  And finally, the Chocolate Croissant Bread Pudding:  simply amazing, the best I have had anywhere outside of my mother in law's (who made the most amazing French pastries).  \n\nAs we have a dinner party coming up this weekend, and time/energy to bake is short these days with the new baby in the house, we (the hubby, who also highly approved the bread pudding, which is speaking volumes) decided that we would bring Fillmore Bakeshop's Choco Croissant Pudding.  So I walk in this afternoon, day three, to see about it.  None in the case, and Elena mentioned that they kept running out of croissants.  Then ensued funny interchange in which I think I may have offended them to their core... sorry!\n  \nMe:  \"Oh do you make your own croissants here?\"\nElena [over her shoulder to her Dad]:  \"Hey Dad, do we make our own croissants here?\"\nElena's Dad:  [rolling his eyes and jokingly waving me out of the shop] \"Ahhh, get outta here!\"  \nMe:  [stumbling realizing I'd done some offending and trying to make up for it] \"OOh.  So how early do I have to get here to taste these lovely croissants?\"  \nElena or Elena's Dad:  \"We open at 7!\"\n\nNext, Elena offered to bake me the Choco Croissant Pudding herself if I brought in a casserole dish for her to bake it in.  Wow, talk about a super sweet surprise!  Now that is above and beyond.  Which of course, as she herself suggested, leaves me the option of passing it off as my own (but we shall see where my moral compass goes on that one...)  The hugest part was that she even offered to teach me how to make it!!  Now that is a HUGELY exciting prospect for me.  \n\nThen I tried a square of a Coconut Apricot Bar that she recommended (hearty texture, light, not too sweet, not too overly coconut, a delightfully thin bar that tasted kind of healthy even) as well as a Raspberry Custard Danish (soft yummy pastry, not dried out even at the end of the day, good balance of 4 raspberries sitting atop custard cheese, yum).  \n\nLove the fact that it's a father/daughter pair working there.  Interior has been updated from the previous Patisserie Delanghe.  Modernized, really feels clean, and some serious baking going on here.  (I think they start at some ungodly hour like 3 or 4 am...  How can you not respect that.)  I hear that more tables/chairs have been purchased and are waiting to be picked up.    \n\nSoooo... now I just have to make it to the Bakeshop in the morning some time to taste these delicious croissants.

My first words were \"OMG\" right into the eyes of our gracious patisseur herself, and I left the store a happy patron, thinking of when it would be that I'll return.\n\nWithin two seconds I was back for another half-a-dozen macarons. I couldn't resist their smooth and crunchy almond shell with almost a fudgy, but still light, texture of the cookie paired with a most silky smidgeon of their delightful buttercream, not to mention the flavors really packed a punch. The creme puffs were delicious too. Everything is priced competitively, and served with a hint of charm, courtesy of the master bakere-ess at work here.\n\nI would definitely recommend a trip in for a delectable, quick, on-the-go snack that will send you off into Paris for a moment.

The butter croissants are amazing.  The coffee is great.  The place has been remodeled and the seating area is much more inviting.  The whole place looks elegant and cosmopolitan now.  And best of all, grouchy Mr. Delanghe has been replaced with the charming Elena and her father Doug, and the equally charming wait staff (especially Claire and Yuddy).\n\nSince they re-opened I've become a regular, even though I live in the Marina.  It's worth it to me to walk up a couple of miles round trip (including one big hill) to get my pastries here.  Plus, I can justify some of those calories :-)  I bring my dog and go sit with her in the park at the end of Cottage Row down the block (between Bush and Sutter) while I scarf down the goodies.\n\nSo far I've been working my way through their offerings and I have yet to find anything I don't absolutely LOVE.  Their danish are absolutely delicious.   I had a cream cheese/blueberry danish today that was wonderful.  The princess cake - Elena cut me a huge slice today from an actual cake (they had run out of the individual slices) and it was amazing - moist, flavorful, dense.  For those who don't know, it's the very definition of \"the whole is greater than the sum of its parts\" - white cake, whipped cream, custard, raspberry jam, all layered together and covered by this amazing moist pale green marzipan shell.  I don't particularly like any of these ingredients (except the custard) - but put them all together and somehow it works beautifully.\n\nWhat else is great?  The bread pudding - they rotate the flavors.  I love the chocolate/banana and the boysenberry.  Their morning buns are like pastry cocaine.  The cookies are also wonderful.  I'll update when I've sampled more things - I tend to find a couple of things I like and stick with them, so it might be a while!\n\nWhen I don't have my dog with me, I try to score one of the two tables in the sunny window and sit there to have my coffee and pastry.  Until now, I almost always get my coffee in \"to go\" (paper) cups even when I plan to stay, because I normally don't like the cups that cafes serve their coffee in - they're too thick, and the china seems to suck all the heat out of the coffee (unless they warm it up with hot water first, as they do at Peet's).  However, the china cups at Fillmore BakeShop are just perfect.  They're a lovely pale aqua blue, to match the plates and napkins, with thin rims.  Somehow, the experience of drinking coffee out of these cups makes the coffee taste even better.  And their silverware is so nice - shiny, heavy in your hand.  It elevates the \"eat in\" experience to me.  I may have to actually buy this same flatware and dishware to have at home!!!\n\nThe coffee is also the best, hands down, that I've had in any cafe in San Francisco.  Better than Peet's, better than Blue Bottle.  It's by a company called La Colombe.  \n\nI haven't tried the chocolates yet but they're works of art - Elena's father makes them.\n\nThe pair of them have an amazing eye - the entire place has been transformed into this elegant space where everywhere you look, there is something gorgeous in front of you.\n\nYeah, I'm a fan - can you tell?", "author": "Alexandra D."}

The first, a chocolate cake with salted caramel mousse which melted on my tongue and got rave reviews from everyone at the party and the second, a white chiffon with raspberry custard, both of which were slathered with the perfect amount of light, fluffy, buttercream frosting - the kind that doesn't leave that unpleasant film in your mouth you might encounter in a bakery that didn't put such wonderful ingredients, and care, into their products.

The sizes of all four was fair and looked very puffed up. The outer coating was very crispy/crunchy. The inside was chewy and more than one of the four contained air pockets. In addition to the disappointment of being greeted with emptiness when biting into a macaroon, all four were very, very sweet. The vanilla and green tea literally tasted as if it were coated with a light dusting of confectioners sugar. The vanilla and green tea were not very true to flavor whereas the lemon had the slightest hint of citrusy-tang. The mocha was probably the best in terms of flavor. Overall, I don't think I would be returning here to purchase french macaroons for approximately $2 apiece. I do not recommend the macaroons despite the popularity of them on yelp. The price to size ratio makes it a deal, but the taste and air pockets do not. On a brighter note, the pastries and cookies looked quite delectable!", "author": "Joanna J."}

Best personal service and custom order as well... thank you, Elena!  Your years of pastry study & training in Switzerland has  paid off and won you a permanent spot in my heart and tummy!    \n\nOur story:  My husband's mother is famous to our family and friends for her homemade Napoleons, and for our wedding, we wanted to pay tribute to them.  In order to honor their fabulousness, we did taste-offs of all the best Napoleons in the Bay Area from all the top bakeries and Yelper recs (I realize, not a very diet-friendly pre-wedding exercise, but it was well worth it and now I've done the legwork for the rest of you!).   It came down to two Napoleons after a couple months of searching:  One from the North Bay that LOOKED artistically impeccable & tasted good, and Elena's at the Fillmore Bakeshop, which looked more like my mother-in-law's (ie. homemade) and whose custard was out of this world.  Winner of our taste-off:  Fillmore Bakeshop!  \n\nWe discovered that Napoloens that look perfect (like our 2nd place winner), don't necessarily taste perfect, as the custard is supplemented with whipped cream in order to give it a thickness that will shape the cut squares, well, perfectly.  Factory appearance means factory taste to some extent, so don't be fooled by bakeries that look like they have perfect pastries... they are often missing that individual effort and care.  Fillmore Bakeshop's Napoleon LOOKS BEAUTIFUL TOO, but it doesn't sacrifice taste and quality for appearance sake, and is made there on the spot with family love and quality.  It's most authentic and European, not American manufactured.  Elena & the Bakeshop use a true custard, with more expensive ingredients than whipped topping, but without adding to it's very reasonable price.  The result:  The MOST amazing custard on the planet!!  \n\nElena is the most fun and enthusiastic baker around.  She was so flexible with creating a custom order for us (for example, my mother-in-law uses some cherry juice in the frosting, and Elena was happy to do the same for our wedding)!  She knew how much we loved her custard, so she put some extra into ours for the wedding per request, and also put some extra frosting on the top because we mentioned how much we love it.   It was the first and fastest thing to go at the wedding, and people were raving it about it all night and still ask about the Napoleons a couple months later.  Fantastic prices to boot!", "author": "Tej A."}

After lunch on Saturday the bf  suggested we take a walk to Fillmore bakeshop (which was just down the street, then up a semi hill.. ) okay, i'll walk to get some yummi macarons no problem!! \nThis bakery is cute, but busy!! There were a couple of people in front of us ordering their goodies which gave me plenty of time to look at all the wonderful slightly larger (yes, you read that right no anorexic mararons sold here, just slightly plump macaron's just staring out into the world from their display case waiting to be bought). Everyone in the bakery is friendly. From the first moment you walk in, you are greeted by someone. \nNot only does this bakery sell macarons but they also have assorted cakes,pie,bread pudding, peach-raspberry and strawberry-rhubarb,pound cake along with Quiches (check to see what the speical of the day is), assorted breads. coffee and teas. \n\nWhen it was finally our turn, we decided on getting a small amount of macarons. At $1.95 each, it wasnt to bad considering the size of those suckers!! \nAnd let me tell you, the wait was worth it!! As soon as we walked back to our car we dug into the box!! The rose macaron that i ate first was super mild tasting, not like all the other rose ones i've had before (where it tasted like i inhaled a rose petal and not a macaron). It had a subtle taste with a hint of rose, and to top it off it had an extra crunchiness to it. I wanted to try the lemon one, but that was being saved for the trip home the next day! And yes, i am happy to say that the lemon was well worth the wait too... Two words to describe it: Zesty and Delish!! Plus it wasnt dryed out on the second day (score).\n\nThis bakeshop is truly hidden gem in SF that i cant wait to go back to!!", "author": "Sarah A."}

The size of the bakery is moderate and offered a couple tables to just sit, eat, and look at all the rich shoppers that can afford to shop regularly at the boutiques nearby.\n\nMy mom had the bread pudding with some nice fruit (forgot what it was though LOL) was very smooth and focused more on the custardy texture than sweetness (I'm a sugar bomb girl so this took a little getting used to),  and the corners offered a nice crunch .  The blueberry muffin was very soft and fresh, had worse and have better, but it was still very good.\n\nThe low star rating is STRICTLY for the macarons, I'd actually give it 2 stars and one extra star for the nice service.  I knew in the back of my mind those macarons looked too big and poofy to be soft and tender in the center [***UPDATE.. I'd give it 3 if you leave it sitting for one day & a 3.5 for 2-3 days (softens the macaron a little bit**, but if you want to eat it the day of.. the following is what you should expect].  They had a deal, where you buy 12, and you get one free; my lard ass went for it and got flavors I felt safe with (pistacio, honey, irish coffee, lemon, passion fruit, pb & chocolate, almond, vanilla, you get the picture) and boy did it go downhill from there.  Biting into their macaron is like biting into a mix b/w a meringue and an over-baked chewy cookie--which is what I would NOT want in a french macaron.  Actually, I'd never want it T_T... Too much crumbling, hard chewing, and frowning.  I believe they're using too much egg whites and sugar, and/or overbaking.  And the filling did not offer any support (or apologies) either, reminds me of room temperature butter between two graham crackers.  I'm also very partial to overly colored things in general, so their overly bright colors where not in the least bit appetizing (you could tell I was really eating with my blind eyes that day) I'm saying this with a heavy heart because I wanted to enjoy it very much, but I couldn't, I kept going back to the box, trying a flavor, then putting it back frowning.  Thank God their macaroons prices weren't too much off the roof (13 priced around $23?)  I would have been super depressed if I paid over 30 for this.\n\nI've paid more for smaller but had amazing experiences.. another good learning experience that bigger & cheaper isn't always (or is rarely ever) better.", "author": "Iralyn J."}

I got the last slice of the day and it was sitting on a plate, by itself, looking pretty pathetic really. But when I took it home and ate the first bite my eyes opened up pretty wide. Best peach pie I ever had, hands down. Bonus points for keeping the skin on the peaches, which added that extra bit of naturalness that is lacking in other peach pies that I've tried.\n\nApple pie: Delicious. Apples still have crunch to them but not in a raw way... just cooked perfectly. The crust was just the right amount of thickness and tasted good.\n\nBlood Orange macaron and the Passion Fruit Macaron: Good flavor. Beautiful appearance. Kind of missing that macaron chewiness when you bite down on it.\n\nPeanut Butter Macaron: I'm not a peanut butter desserts kind of person but I still enjoyed this one, my wife liked it more than me. This had the right sort of chewy bite that I love out of my macarons. \n\nCoffee/Irish Cream (?): I honestly forgot what the exact flavor was but it was probably one of their most popular as it was almost all gone! Some chewiness in the bite but not much. Flavors were really frikkin good.\n\nOver all though, a well deserved four stars.

When I was younger and would walk by and stick my face against the large windows to watch the previous baker work his magic, he'd always glare at me. But, that's probably because I was fogging up his windows with my icky child breath.\nAnyhow, they \"revamped\" recently, and my mother and I decided to try their macarons since we, like the rest of the world, is on a macaron kick right now. Green tea and chocolate hazelnut, the later per suggestion of the baker himself.\nOkay, so they were okay. Just okay. The texture was more crumbly than I like, less chewy in the middle, and the flavoring was not pure, but more simply \"sugary\" tasting.

Not with my helplessly profound addiction to macarons, anyhow. And, without contest, Fillmore Bakeshop wins the prize for being the best enablers in the area. One bite of this macaron and I turned on my heel to run back for more.\n\nThe father-daughter proprietors of the new bakeshop, Doug and Elena Basegio (as I found out by the grace of fellow yelpers) are churning out laminated doughs and p\u00e2tes \u00e0 choux like it's nobody's business. There are pies, shortbreads, adorably perfect chocolate chip cookies and various flavored (and classic) croissants all lined up along the right side of the display, and then your delicate little confections hang out to the left, with the princess cake reigning over all. Poppa Basegio's celebrated line of artisanal chocolates, Au Coeur des Chocolats (the palet d'or truffle is my favorite so far), is proudly put on display to enjoy along with all of the baked goods made in-house. Which are wonderful. Y. and I sampled mini eclairs and St. Honor\u00e9 puffs. Both shells were slightly moister and more tender than most puffs I've had (perhaps more egg yolk? more butter?), and the latter's vanilla custard was spiked generously with rum, which punctuated the vanilla flavor nicely. I prefer a more wispy touch with the caramelized sugar for crunchier texture, but the flavor was superb.\n\nBut really, the crowning jewel of the bakery, for me, were the macarons. The shells have the wonderful fine-grained texture evident in the lack of lumps on the surface, and the fillings are intensely flavored, silky in texture but restrained in sugar. This is actually a noticeable trend in all of the Bakeshop's goods-- no more sugar than is necessary to bring out the sweetness in the ingredients and the final product itself-- and it's something that I really appreciate. The buttercream is smooth and feather-light in the almond, rose and pistachio macarons. I have no idea how Elena distills the flavors into these tiny little treats, but whatever magic it takes, I'll subscribe to it. The rose and pistachio macarons, especially, were so evocative of the real thing. I was seriously floored, and we ended up demolishing nine macs within an hour.\n\nI never tried Patisserie Delanghe, so I cannot comment on whether or not this is an improvement, or if even it does justice to the history. But just for the sake of my pathetic, wallet-draining addiction to macarons, I hope the Basegios will be here for at least as long as the Delanghes were. Well, and they're super-duper nice. They don't have a sign put up in the front yet, but something tells me I'll find my way back.", "author": "Nuri K."}

Tried this place 3-4 years ago not long after they took over the space from Patisserie Delanghe when its owners retired :(  . Went back today and it is still without a doubt THE MOST DISAPPOINTING CHOCOLATE CROISSANT IN SAN FRANCISCO. Let me paint you a picture: please imagine a cross-section of a typical chocolate croissant- only THERE\"S ALMOST NO CHOCOLATE. Just a little dimple of chocolate on either side with 2.5 to 3 inches of dry plain croissant between running the entire length of the pastry. And calling this a pastry is generous. A croissant is something flaky and buttery that you can peel apart in golden layers (even a Pillsbury crescent roll baked by a grade school child can pull this off). But the so-called chocolate croissant from Fillmore Bakeshop is like a dry sponge. No flaky layers. No buttery flavor. Like a Safeway croissant- only much more of a disappointment because on Fillmore Street you/me/anyone expect and deserve something better.  If Fillmore Bakeshop would not bother attempting patisserie items like pain au chocolat, then they would not be insulting the 25 year legacy of the husband-and-wife team of Dominique and Marie-Jeanne Delanghe.  But for those of fortunate enough to have eaten the Delanghe pain au chocolat at the corner of Fillmore and Bush for years, you can't help but expect so much more.  Dear Fillmore (the neighborhood)- you all deserve better. I hope you will walk a bit further to somewhere better than Fillmore Bakeshop.  Even the name is totally unimaginative.

I had a croissant with chocolate chip filling and it was to die for.  The croissant tasted so fresh and didn't leave me feeling gross after like many pastries from other bakeries have in the past.  This pastry definitely made my morning!  If you haven't been here yet, do it!", "author": "Jessica A."}

I never tried the bakery it replaced, but happened to make it in here on opening day-- and half a dozen times since then.\n\nThe pastries are consistently delicious, they serve amazing la colombe coffee (a little taste of philadelphia-- in a good way!) and the atmosphere is fabulous. Every person I've spoken to inside made my day just a little bit brighter. \n\nNot much in the way of seating-- there are a few tiny tables-- but it would be a good spot for people watching if one happened to be vacant.", "author": "Rachel F."}

It always tastes as though they've put thought and care in making them. I often bring out-of-town guests here to grab some pastries for a quick breakfast. I'm not really a fan of their macarons, but that's ok because they have other great items like a special shortbread-like cookie covered in chocolate. Friendly customer service!", "author": "Elizabeth D."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-08-31", "description": "The macarons were just mediocre and did not wow me at all. I tried the raspberry, rose, and salted caramel. The salted caramel tasted more like chocolate than caramel, and the raspberry needed more intense raspberry tartness. Their macarons are pretty hard, and I didn't like that much. I've had excellent macarons where the interior is chewy, but not hard. The only hard (crunchy) part should be the thin skin on the outside. That is the perfect macaron.", "author": "Michael F."}

The clerk guy was really nice. We went there again for breakfast on our last day in SF because the food and service is really amazing! We went there right before we left and they remembered everything we ordered the last time. All the Danishes were really delicious and there were all kinds of croissants which were all crispy and SUPER delicious. Also, my brother ordered the homemade bun (or something). It was very fresh and soft and delicious. Everything in there tastes like heaven.", "author": "Janet L."}

The guests at the event RAVED about the desserts we served--especially the mini eclairs!  Elena's suggestions were very helpful; we had a lovely assortment and the prices were less than at other upscale bakeries in San Francisco.  I'll definitely return to this bakery again, and highly recommend the owners and staff.", "author": "Maureen F."}

German chocolate cupcakes - when these are the cupcake of the day jump on that. Lemon pound cake? Holy Cow is that tasty. Savory? Try the ham and cheese croissant or a slice of quiche. Something for everyone here at this wonderful bake shop. Warm, funny and friendly owners. Yes, they took over a beloved institution, and raised the bar. You've been good -  treat yourself to a visit. The bread pudding? Heaven. The pies? Better. The cakes a feast for the eyes.", "author": "Nanette B."}

I've never had morning buns, and after trying one at Fillmore Bakeshop, I tried several more at other bakeries and none of them stand up to the one at Fillmore Bakeshop. The banana chocolate bread pudding is delicious, moist all the way through sweet and rich, but surprisingly not too heavy. I'm never disappointed, (except when I tried hot cross buns...I'm just personally not a fan, but I know for those who do like them REALLY like them at the Fillmore Bakeshop)", "author": "L C."}
