Maybe it needed salt, maybe it needed a sauce? It just tasted flavorless unfortunately. The rueben was very good. I would certainly order that again. I just wish there was more pastrami on the rueben. The picture of the rueben on yelp doesn't reflect the rueben I got. Maybe that is a special one with extra meat. The salad was extremely boring. Little to no dressing and the ingredients dod not seem fresh. The potato and macaroni salad were also very bad. They tasted like they had been coated in lemon juice or something that gave a weird acidic taste and make my tongue tingle when I ate it. We threw those out as well as the salad.

During the 5 or 10 minutes I waited for my sandwich to be made I saw him greet multiple visitors by name - clearly this is a place that engenders loyalty.

One can easily spend a few bucks there, but it's O.K.

Let me tell you that their spirits collection is truly unbeatable -- there isn't a place that stocks as seriously as them. They have a decent wine and cheese selection, and I'll probably expire long before I try all of them. Four to five stars.\n\nSecond, I came here for snacks:chocolate, gummies, etc. Not only do they carry your ordinary American snacks, but they stock Haribo, and most importantly they stock Kinder and Ritter. Now you may not be familiar with German sweets, but in the Western Hemisphere no one really holds a candle to their craftsmanship. And these are the top selections. They stock quality. Five stars. My German friends endorse this view.\n\nThird, I came here for a snack after a late workout. Now here I was skeptical -- I've had a lot of sandwiches, from Ike's to Hoagies to Deli Board to Sammys on 3rd, and the quality here is absolutely first tier. It may be better. Now I've only had a sandwich here once (today) and my roommate had a less good experience when they ran out of turkey, but this is what put the icing on the cake.\n\nNow you know why this place is titled a delicatessen -- because it is quality food for the refined palette.

I picked up a 4 pack of \"Milk Stout\" by Widmer Brothers Brewing Co (which I had never tried).\n\nThe deli aspect of the store is about as legit as it gets. The sauces and meats are made there and are high quality. No canned anything involved! Everyday of the week they have a different fresh specialty (e.g. roasted turkey with mushroom gravy, home made  meatballs, clam chowder, etc). Most of their sandwiches are $7 for a full size and worth every penny. I ordered the \"Turkey Lulu\" and it was incredibly tasty.\n\nAs if quality products and great prices weren't enough to keep me coming back, the customer service was EXCELLENT.

I work across the street and frequent Handy Deli almost once a week.  The service is EXTREMELY and GENUINELY friendly!  Jerry, his wife, Leila, their boys, Mohammed, are some of the sweetest and nicest people you'll ever meet!\n\n\nOrder their daily roast chicken plate.  Such a deal for the quality and quantity that you get! Their roast chicken is hot, flavorful, juicy, and tender!  It falls off the bone and goes great with their yummy rice (or roast potatoes), AND a generous side salad!  Lots of times (so I don't have to cook!) I would buy a couple of plates to take home for dinner.  They have other specials ( check their menu)-- \"Thanksgiving Tuesday\" (as I like to call it)-- slices of turkey with gravy and mashed potatoes, chicken cacciatore, pulled pork, meatballs, ... ALL YUM!!!!\n\n\nTheir sandwiches are equally yummy! Fresh and made to order!  My colleagues and ( even my own parents!) love going to Handy to get their Reuben sandwich!  I love the Hunter's Club (rare roast beef, lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard) -- Again... YUM!!!\n\n\nNow, the other reason why I wanted to write this very belated review-- Handy Deli also CATERS!  Last year, I was hunting around for a caterer for my son's 1st birthday-- instead of going to a restaurant. I inquired with Jerry on a whim, and my husband and I are sooo glad that we did!  We went with Jerry and he did NOT disappoint!  He worked  and stayed within our budget, gave a variety of menu items to choose from.   And on the day of our son's party, he AND his wife, Leila, catered the whole event BY THEMSELVES.  They arrived at the venue promptly, prepped all of the food, served and cleaned up everything!  And poor Jerry is so accommodating and flexible-- there was another event that \"shared\" the venue's kitchen ( we weren't informed of this) and he worked around them.\n\nGuests were served Handy's roast chicken and pulled pork, rice pilaf, roast potatoes, and roasted vegetables.\n\nALL of our guests raved about how DELICIOUS and plentiful the food was!!!\n\n\nYou cannot go wrong with HANDY!  Consider them to cater your next event, or if you are planning to go out for a picnic in the park, or to the ball park... call in an order for a couple of hot plates or freshly made sandwiches!  YOU CANNOT GO WRONG!!!\n\n=)", "author": "Jenn T."}

My GF and I walked in to buy some wine, and one of the guys who was working there immediately came up and started to \"sell\" to  us. He was very pushy and we were very rushed to buy. I wanted to buy maybe two $8 bottles of wine, but he offered to sell us two $20 bottles for the price of one.\n\nWhen we got to the checkout, our bill was at $25, and I told the cashier that he said he was going to sell us both bottles for $20, so he checked with the guy and agreed to knock off $3. The wines were pretty good and I did verify the MSRP of the bottle he said was $20 that sold for $7, so that was slightly redeeming...\n\nThe product and price were fair, but we didn't like being pressured to buy more than what we had planned on paying for.", "author": "P A U L."}

Sixes of Trumer Pils and Bridgeport - $5.99! Sierra Nevada (not just the Pale Ale but their other offerings as well, including their amazing Kellerweis Hefeweizen), Deschutes, Kona, Widmer Brothers, among others - $6.99! Lagunitas, New Belgium, Speakeasy, among others -  $7.99! \n\nNot only are their prices the lowest around (including Lucca down the street, which has a credit card minimum - Handy does not), the guys who work there are extremely nice and happy to have a chat with you about the state of microbrew retail. And, if you go often enough, they'll know what you like and offer suggestions, and even give you a free bottle or two of something else to try.

They are very knowledgeable and accommodating. \n\nOne day I was digging through the refrigerated cheese and packaged meat case and the young man who works there asked me if he could help. I told him I was looking for sliced American cheese. He looked for me and we both came to the conclusion that they where out. He then said I can buy freshly sliced American cheese from the deli counter. I am so glad I accepted his offer. The cheese was incredible and much better than the typical packaged cheese. Plus it was a decent price. I believe I paid about $5.00 for a lb. and at Safeway they charge $7.00. \n\nThey have an incredible selection of beer, Allagash being my favorite. Also, they have Skinny Girl Margarita! The only store in the entire Sunset district to carry it! The owner will brag about it, but that only means he is very proud of his business and he cares to please his customers. \n\nThis will continue to be my go-to spot. I do support the other stores nearby, but if I buy too much alcohol I feel they judge me. Not Handy Deli! I bought a bottle of Skinny Girl Margarita today and asked the Owners (nice young couple) to help me get a small bottle of tequila because the Skinny Girl was not strong enough, that's why it's skinny ;) The husband offered a nice bottle of tequila but it was above my price range. Then he offered a larger bottle of similar price but if I keep a large bottle, I will drink too much. The wife picked up on that! She said maybe it's better to have a little so it's not around. Yes!

Tried the deli a couple times at Handy's and have come up pretty disappointed. Too bready, skimpy, and meat quality can be a bit sketch sometimes in the deli case. There's also a great chance that your order will only be half right and haven't had an employee yet who seems to care about finishing my order in a timely manner. Yes, the sandwiches are cheap, but you certainly pay for what you get here.\n\nThey carry the very very basics (I head down the street to Lucca on the corner when I need the snacks, basics, etc.), but it's more of a beer/liquor stop that seems to attract the underage crowd. Used to live right next to Handy's and had to have the unfortunate daily walk through the underage smoking crowd bumming off of exiting customers. Don't get me started about the kids who ask you to buy them beer and look like they're 14. So annoying! Don't these people have a responsibility to report these kiddos or at least shoo them off?!\n\nOver the years this place has gone from average to kinda ghetto. Disappointing to see it decline.", "author": "Jenna Y."}

He greeted me with a warm welcome and we engaged in conversation for a bit.

It started back up again but I pulled over in front of the Handy Liquor store to check my oil, because the area was well lit and there was a parking stall in front. \n\nI was amazed by how two guys from Handy Deli (or Handy Liquors, as I think of it) rushed right out to help me as soon as they saw me pop my hood. One guy's name was Edgardo and unfortunately I didn't catch the other guy's name but - they were awesome. It was SO nice to have those guys offer their help. I know I would have been able to do most of the stuff on my own (checking the oil and adding a quart) but it was sure sweet to see their willingness to help!  Nothing sucks quite like car trouble and that feeling of vulnerability that goes along with it when you have no idea what the hell to do to fix it. \n\nOne guy shined his cell phone light on the little hole where you're supposed to put the dipstick back in (even with the bright store light it was a little hard to see) and one guy poured the oil... then when a little spilled the guy with the cell phone wanted to help wipe it up. How about that!\n\nI've gotten beer and a few other things from this place before. Far as I can tell it seems to be your average liquor store but MAN they got some good guys working there!

And now we know why. First of all, the service was excellent. We hung out with great-guy-whose-name-I-can't-remember for like 30 minutes, and I rambled on about sandwiches and my obsession with Kinder Hippos. Meanwhile, he made us three of the best (not to mention cheapest) sandwiches I have had in the last two years (length of my current stay in SF). I had roast beef on a sourdough roll and the last poster is right, the bread is damn delicious. We got the special- sandwiches with a drink and chips for 50 cents more (whaa...?). If I could I would give them an extra star for having the ever-elusive chocolate (vs. white) Kinder Hippo, a very endangered species, considering they didn't even have them in the Munich airport, their native habitat. I went on and on about the Hippos and I thought our new sandwich-making friend was sick of me until, when he came outside to see if we needed anything else (um, hello unexpected amazing service), he was indulging in the sweet hippos of the gods.
