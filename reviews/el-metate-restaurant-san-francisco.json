So the food that I order wasn't a mind-blowing but they gave you a lot of carnitas and that's what I liked and I'll definitely be back for lunch or dinner. \nThanks for reading my El Metate review. ~Lizzie~", "author": "Lizzie G."}

Little flavor (under salted) and zero spice. \n- Margaritas: no option to have it on the rocks. Not made fresh, probably came from a pre-mixed bottle.

While in San Francisco for work I grabbed lunch at El Metate with a friend before heading out to SFO. \n\nThe restaurant itself is beautiful with its bright yellow exterior and homey interior full of greenery, murals, and general vibe of still being outside in a cute little town square. \n\nI ordered the pollo con chile rojo burrito and added the extra guac, cheese, and sour cream (it's only a dollar more and well worth it). El Metate's burritos are long and skinny, which looks somewhat hilarious in a world of chunky Chipotle burritos, but made for easy eating - I didn't have to try to control the filling falling out all over the place. The accompanying chips were crispy and came in a twisted up piece of paper. Salsa was tasty. I really enjoyed the horchata I ordered - creamy with a good kick of cinnamon. \n\nMetate isn't my favorite Mission joint, but you also aren't going to go wrong with it!

The hype is too high now. It's time.\nRegulars: You're about to spend time with a loved one--a burrito at El Metate. You remember what it's like to be with them, and you can't get anymore excited than RIGHT NOW.\n\nStage 2: Euphoric digestion\nYou've taken the first bite. You're eating the burrito. This is it--it's happening. You don't even understand why it tastes this good. It's a dream come true.\n\nStage 3: Fear of losing your [burrito's] composure\nIn the last quarter of your burrito, you realize this is a temporary event, and/or that your burrito might fall apart over your plate. What are you going to do? Is it going to maintain its composure? Will you maintain yours, when you've rid of this food? This will end soon.\n\nStage 4: Unbelievable victory\nWow, you really finished that didn't you? That was impressive. Their burritos are massive--nice job, no really.\n\nStage 5: Serenity (a), or panic (b)\n5a. Your heart is beating at the minimum resting BPM now. You're completely satisfied. Absolute serenity. That was a GOOD burrito.\n5b. Okay that was a LOT of food that you shouldn't have eaten all at once, maybe you're panicking a bit now. That was definitely a take-half-for-leftovers kind of meal. This place in no way sacrifices quality for quantity, or vice versa.\n\n---\n\nStages aside, you will enjoy your burrito here.

Overall not as large as it looks from outside. \n\nI played it safe with cheese enchiladas in red sauce (my favorite) but it's an extensive menu with the ubiquitous burritos but also tamale plates and abundant quesadilla choices. \n\nFood was very good. Plenty of cheese on everything. Sauce had a kick. Guacamole had good flavor.

It has all the right things and all in the right combination: not too much beans or cheese, but just enough guac and rice. Sin crema? No problema! I also feel that their burritos aren't as greasy and the ingredients are a bit fresher than some of the other tacquerias. You can place an order via phone to go (my favorite), and it is actually ready by the time you arrive. Staff are pretty friendly and good.

Although I really enjoyed it, my bf did not have the tasting palette for it. He's more of a simple burrito type of dude and I believe that it's just one of those types of foods where some people like it and some people don't. He ordered the carne asada burrito and said it was OK and average. What we both enjoyed was the chicken tortilla soup and I can't wait to come back for another bowl. We spent $30 flat on a carne asada super burrito (3.5/5 his rating), chicken red mole enchilada (4/5), and a large chicken tortilla soup (6/5).", "author": "Anastasya S."}

I came here based upon these reviews and we were sorely disappointed. One thing that the restaurant does right is the ambience and salsa bar.  The salsa bar had cucumber salsa and fruit salsa, which I liked. None of the salsas are spicy, so if you are looking for authentic  spicy Mexican salsa, you'll be disappointed.\nMoving onto the food - we had the vegetarian burrito and vegetarian quesadilla.  Both of these dishes had the same exact vegetables - mostly carrots, and some zucchini, green cabbage. Surprisingly the supposedly \"grilled\" veggies were actually raw and not seasoned. I don't know why the menu board says grilled vegetables when they use raw veggies.  I've never had a veggie burrito or quesadilla with raw crunchy carrots zucchini and cabbage before.   Texture is just wrong. Sadly the quesadilla had hardly any cheese. So eating a cheese-less quesadilla with raw crunchy veggies was highly unpleasant. And so was eating burrito with raw unseasoned veggies. I would definitely not go back. By the way, unlike most of the burritos in the Mission area, this burrito was small and skinny - basically not enough portion for a hungry soul.", "author": "Priscilla P."}

A free basket of chips with every order, and a great salsa bar are also mainstays at this place which is greatly appreciated. \n\nYou order/pay at the front (before you enter the sit down restaurant), so it makes the experience pretty seamless.

As you walk into the place, you are greeted with their ordering area with the open kitchen and then the menus up top. As you walk it in it does feel to be a little cramped, although there is an another section that provides seating.\n\nFrom the first glance, prices seem to be quite reasonable, and there are a lot of options as you would come to expect out of a Mexican food place.  I ended up going with their daily special with Chicken Red Mole sauce coupled with a side of chips and guacamole. My friend ended up getting the tamales with a steak burrito. \n\nUpon sitting down, there is cutlery and also sauces on the side of the chips. We ended up trying most of the sauces and ended up with the spicy sauce to alternate with the guacamole. I do admit their guac is quite good and the fact that a pint could be purchased with 3 dollars so worth trying out. \n\nUpon receiving the entree, I was quite surprised with the portion that you receive. A portion of rice is coupled some salad + guac and refried beans. In the second plate is the entree being the mole. The mole was quite good. Flavourful with a bit of a thick chocolate taste with lots of sweetness which complimented the chicken well. The tamales had a bit of a citrusy taste which I appreciated a lot. \n\nOverall I would say this place would be a 4 out of 5 for the overall experience. Good seating with good guacamole some really gnarly tamales and some nice thick mole sauce.", "author": "Frank O."}

I'm so glad we did. It's an order at the counter, find a table and they bring it to you kind of establishment and the options are plentiful. Took a lot not to opt for something other than a burrito.\n\nI can see how parking could be an issue, but we managed to find something fairly quickly at 6:30pm on a Sunday. The restaurant was decently packed, but there was still plenty of seating for our group of four after we ordered. The staff was friendly and helpful and made our experience very pleasant.\n\nI ordered the chile verde burrito, which was skinny, but sizable, delicious, and completely filling. My boyfriend went with their special chicken mole burrito. I'm not usually a fan of mole, but the flavors were subtle and yummy. My mom went off-burrito and opted for the chile verde tamale, which was served with rice, beans, guac and sour cream and was possibly the best dish of them all. The free chips are excellent - an interesting mix of regular corn, sweet potato, and veggie. The salsas are all fresh and tasty as well. Can't even choose a favorite!\n\nMy dad gauges Mexican restaurants on their ability to deliver a solid carnitas burrito and I am bummed to say he was sorely disappointed. Having had a bite of his, I am with him. The carnitas was dry and chewy, the burrito lacking in the same bold flavors the rest of the food we ordered had in spades.\n\nI guess the takeaway is that you should go bold with your choices.

And yes, not all of the great Mexican restaurants are located on Mission, Valencia, 16th or 24th streets...\n\nThis place started off as a small single entry way hole in the wall over 10 years ago that was known at the time for having one hell of a quesadilla with multi colored chips. It has since expanded down the block to where the corner store was located at 22nd and Bryant streets. Now there is plenty of seating and the menu is packed full of authentic dishes from Chicken Mol\u00e9 to Platillo Del Mar. \n\nI personally am a huge fan of the Carnitas as it is seasoned and cooked to perfection and the tossed on the flattop to crisp up prior to being served in the \"vehicle\" of your choice... I typically smash down the block with a super burrito and I always think why don't I come here more often? Yes it is tough to park in this neighborhood as well as it is all around the Mission but if you circle a coupe times you will usually find a spot to park so you can enjoy your grub at your own pace. \n\nThere is a small salsa bar located in the back that has more than enough options to please your palate. The chips they serve are like no others, there are your typical crunchy chips as well as what seem to be double fried pieces or strips of flour tortilla that are surprisingly additive. \n\nSo when you find yourself heading out of the mission and that craving hits you don't think twice about heading over to El Matate, they won't steer you wrong. Keep on keeping on! We appreciate it!", "author": "Josh H."}

Looking at the food, they offer a wide range of options, ranging from typical burritos and quesadillas to more niche offerings like platters, enchilladas, and tortas.  I'm particularly a fan of their pollo rojo (chicken in red sauce) burritos, but have also enjoyed their fish burritos (they use tilapia) and shrimp quesadillas.  The meals come with chips, which are okay - not the best among the mexican restaurants in mission, but they are boosted by the fact that Metate has a fresh salsa bar, from which you can take up to 3 types of salsa.  Outside of the food, the restaurant venue is quite nice if you are hoping to stay rather than ordering to go - colorful decorations, sometimes live music, and a decent amount of seating room.  Another nice benefit is that sets them apart from the taquerias is that they do take credit card, so you won't have to worry about not having enough cash.

Their prices are rising, quality is going down, and now they have begun blatantly robbing people. My chicken burrito last night was charged as a \"super\" (guac, cheese, sour cream) plus extra \"guac\" (another order of guacamole on top of the super guacamole.) I protested at the register but the helpless chap said there was \"nothing he could do about it\" and to be \"more careful ordering next time.\"  Well no tip for this guy. As this was a to-go order, you can imagine my dismay when I not only realized there was no \"super\" added, Ie: no cheese no sour cream, etc, but that my double order of guac was also very lacking and hardly noticeable, it was more like a dilute bit of green salsa instead of anything remotely resembling honest guacamole.  To add insult to the injury I asked for black beans but go pinto, no big deal. Lastly instead of a burrito with \"light rice\" I was given a monstrosity of mostly tortilla, lots of salty, dried rice, chewy chicken and beans.

Myself and my daughter ordered the flautas since my daughter has celiacs and needed to avoid any gluten and my husband ordered a carnitas burrito. My son wasn't hungry and didn't order. The flautas were rock hard and burnt, the first bite my daughter and I both looked at each other and said \"are you kidding me\"? We love Mexican food so it's pretty difficult to make something we just won't eat. The beans and rice were as if they were microwaved. I couldn't see paying for two full plates we just were walking away from hungry so I went to find someone- anyone. I was ignored by the first two people I came in contact with and then I saw the man who had taken our order. I explained and he just kinda stared at me like \"what would you like me to do?\" I said perhaps I could order a burrito and then he walked away and never came back. After sitting a while and we were all wondering what was going on, I walked over with my family to the kitchen, register area, right then the man came around the corner with a burrito. I thought he would have let me choose what kind of a burrito? He had intended on charging for my daughters plate that she couldn't eat and giving me a burrito that I didn't choose so he could charge me for my plate I could not eat. Now I was mad. I said here's what I want since they clearly had no customer service! I do not want to pay for the two Burnt plates and I did not order the burrito he brought and I am not paying for that either.

As a vegetarian, I find it difficult to get a satisfying meal when I go to a lot of Mexican restaurants (yes, quesadillas are delicious but I can only eat so many of them a month before I become a cheese woman); however, El Metate fills the void by offering amazing veggie tacos and a delicioso veggie burrito. \n\nVeggies included in El Metate's sauteed mix include carrots, broccoli (YES!), zucchini, onions, squash. Dishes also come with lettuce, fresh herb garnishes, and some spicy pickled veggies. What more, El Metate also serves up the main dish with rice and beans on the side. \n\nTo top it off, this place has pretty tasty chips, a comprehensive salsa bar, and beer. Although Metate is a little pricier than some other joints in the Mission (veggie taco plate goes for around $10 - $10.50), you won't find better quality elsewhere.\n\nFor you meat eaters, my boyfriend likes the fish burrito and steak burrito. But he LOVES the chicken mole burrito, which is a special. Enjoy!", "author": "Zoe H."}

To die for. \n\nOf course, I came here at the recommendation of my buddy, Gloria C, and got everything she recommended.  It was a Mexican lover's dream come true.  Fish taco was crispy, carnitas taco was flavorful, and fruit salsa was uniquely sweet and salty.  I loved everything I got there... and I'm actually craving it all as I write this review.  The portions are big, so it's going to leave you stuffed way past your normal dinner time.  For example, I had my tacos at 12PM, and I was still stuffed at 8PM.  \n\nThis place is conveniently located near SFGH -- so for those of you that are seeing a doctor or visiting family at SFGH, go there!  They also accept credit cards, and there's plenty of seating.  Best to go there before 12PM when the lunchtime crowd usually eat.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-06-28", "description": "If you're on the hunt for good vegetarian tacos in SF, this place is fairly solid. The tacos have a mix of vegetables (I spotted zucchini, broccolini and cabbage), along with the expected rice and refried beans. They're topped with chopped cilantro, radish, and a smoky red salsa. If you order a taco plate, you get 2 tacos along with more rice and beans and a \"salad,\" which is guacamole, crema, and tomato slices spooned over chopped iceberg.\n\nThe torta also packs a lot of unexpected vegetables, neatly packaged in bread closer to a dutch crunch than the typical bolillo. It's good, but not what you might imagine when you hear 'torta.'\n\nThe salsas are surprisingly tasty -- the verde is vinegary and bold. I would steer clear of the guacamole, which is almost too creamy and pureed and lacking in avocado flavor. The horchata is tasty (not too heavy on the vanilla, as so many in SF are) and served without ice. Beware that the food is very salty. It'll dry your lips out for several hours post-meal.\n\nIt's an order-at-the-counter kind of place, and the food is delivered to your table. There is a good amount of indoor and outdoor seating, plus a self serve salsa bar and water station. At the end of the meal, bus your own table. Very affordable food, with friendly service on top.", "author": "Megan S."}

The inside is a bit confusing with three doors and not very well written out directions on where to go.  I figured it out though and I'm so glad I did.  The menu items although rather extensive seem simple enough.  The grilled chicken burrito was super flavorful and the regular size was plenty enough for me.  Free chips and salsa?  I'm in!  The chips were probably some of the crispiest, non-bagged tortillas I've ever experienced and made for great dipping instruments in one of their several flavors of salsa.

The al pastor wasn't marinated and juicy but was more like smoked pork instead.  Not what I was expecting, but actually pretty good and decent meat quality.  The only problem was that over time the bottom of the quesadilla became more and more drenched in grease.  Too bad, since the top half was really nice and crisp!\n\nThey also give you free chips with every order and then you can choose from 5-6 different salsas at the salsa bar.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-03-14", "description": "Might just be my favorite burrito in SF! It is certainly up there with La Taqueria. I've been meaning to pay a review of El Metate for a while because this place is every bit deserving of a 5-star rating.\n\nFirst, I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I've had the carnitas, pastor, carne asada, chile verde, grilled fish and milanesa and they are all FANTABULOUS! My go-to is the pastor burrito but the chile verde is something you won't find too often at SF Taquerias. It is always perfectly seasoned, tender yet not falling apart like so many stewed pork dishes I've had elsewhere. The tacos are a \"lighter\" alternative to the burritos and two of them will satisfy most appetites.\n\nMetate also features some great salsas, particularly their tomatillo (green) spicy salsa. It's definitely for the spice hounds but I love to drizzle a little on every bite (a practice I learned from my lovely wife) to give it that extra kick! I think there are two different tomatillo salsas, so be careful to choose the right one. The hot one has tons of chile seeds in it.\n\nThe place is always busy (the curse of being so good) and since I live close by, it's usually easier to just pick up than eat in but I've done both. The service is always quick, accurate and friendly. Sometimes you have to wait 10 mins if there are lots of people in front of you or just some big orders but I don't mind so much. If you eat in, there is a huge dining section and a few outdoor tables so you are never cramped or rushed.\n\nLast but certainly not least, Metate might just edge out every other great taqueria on price. I usually gets burrito with guac, light black beans and rice, and no cheese or sour cream. I think it's $7.25 which is a steal considering every other place is like $9-10 with just the guac. A refreshing break among the increasingly unaffordable Mission dining choices.\n\nSo if you haven't already, definitely check this place out. I've got a feeling it will become your go-to burrito joint too!", "author": "Paul S."}

I've tried the quesadillas - veggie and shrimp - both yum but veggie is better and less greasy.  Shrimp tacos beat the fish tacos.

So I was expecting really good food, but came away thinking I'd never go back.  One thing that El Metate does have going for it is inexpensive prices.  \n\nThings started out fine.  Yes, there was a long line, but it moves fast.  I ordered the enchilada plate, two beef enchiladas with no beans, all rice which was noted on my ticket.  The tickets have numbers by which they call to deliver your food, but unlike some places, the number is not in bold or even in the center, making it easy to find.  \n\nMy buddy gets his dish first, fish tacos, and they look good.  I'm waiting a few more minutes when I'm hearing \"Number 64!\".  I look at my ticket, can't see the number which now under full light and my glasses on, I can.  A woman walks over and asks \"Number 64?\"  I say I have two beef enchiladas, so she puts the plate down with rice and beans, but says it's beef.  OK, this isn't quite what I ordered, but I figure I'll skip the beans as I'm really hungry.  I start to cut one of the enchiladas, and they discover they've given me the wrong dish.  Yes, it's two beef enchilada's but someone else's who doesn't want my all rice dish.  They fix the other customer, but don't offer to fix mine.  As I cut into the \"beef\" enchilada, the first bite looks suspiciously like chicken.  The next one seems more like beef, then chicken.\n\nBy this point, I'm thinking I'm not coming back again, so I eat my mixed enchiladas and leave the beans behind.\n\nParking is really, really challenging in the neighborhood, so unless you're simply going on price, skip El Matate.", "author": "Scott S."}

We couldn't pass it up. (I am a taco connoisseur!)\n\nWe walked down Bryant St. and spied a colorful little shop. Bright tables, with scattered chairs, lined the front of the restaurant. It was a nice thing to see. The aromas made us salivate as we ordered.\n\nBased on the reviews, I got the carnitas, al pastor, and fish soft taco. I believe each taco was ~$3. The order came with a little bag of warm chips. \n\nThe salsa bar was pretty much EMPTY. I salvaged a few pieces of pico from the endless abyss of liquid. Ugh. You can tell that it had been empty for a while.. -__- It would have been super, or even, REALLY NICE, if they had bothered to refill it. Yes, it was well-after lunch. But people were still lining up for food!! D:\n\nThe soft tacos were a SORE disappointment. Although the meat portion was nice, the size of the taco was exceedingly small, considering the price. The carnitas was overly dry and salty. The al pastor, again, was super dry. It barely yielded any flavor. I choked a few times because the meat was just.. DRY. To help compensate, I ate the lime pieces. At least they were sour -__- The fish taco was just okay. It wasn't anything impressive. A mere slice of battered fish, fried, mixed with cabbage.\n\nNote: I had slow-cooked my own batch of carnitas earlier in the week. They were soooo much better than what was dished out on my plate. Thus, the validity to the following statement: El Metate, I can make better carnitas than you.\n\nBased on the 700+ rave reviews about El Metate, I left angry and disappointed.

My brother ordered a couple of tacos ($2.50 each), while I had a watermelon aguas frescas and the Milanesa (breaded chicken) plate ($6.75), that comes with rice and beans (choose: pinto, refried, or black beans). My food really hit the spot, the chicken was hot and delicious. Based on that item alone I would give them 4 stars. But I'll reserve that extra star until I try other menu items.\n\nI tasted a bite of the fish taco, it's alright but not as good as my chicken Milanesa, they both used the same fried batter. Note that they put rice on their tacos (most taquerias don't do that), just a comment, not a criticism. I saw a handwritten sign indicating that Menudo (tripe stew) was available, but other than that the menu is basic and won't scare off most Americans (I have a preference for more authentic Mexican menus that include internal organs, etc.).\n\nI think that they use a ready made guacamole mix (more watery, uniform olive green color), which is not as good as freshly made guacamole. I love avocados, so I notice this type of little details. But flavor was still good. And the side container of \"salsa\" for the tortilla chips, was a liquid instead of the typical fresh chopped coarse salsa.\n\nThey made a minor error (more items than what I had ordered) when they charged my credit card, but fixed it quickly afterwards by just giving me the difference in cash back.\n\nOn the plus side, they have a very clean bathroom, and a large dining room (enter by right side of cashier) as well as several outdoor umbrella covered tables.

Don't get me wrong, the tacos are good, but definitely not the best. In my opinion, both Nick's Crispy Tacos and Underdogs Taco Shop (see my review about long wait times) make better fried fish (baja-style) tacos. So what makes them better at those 2 places? The quality of the fresh flaky and flavorful fried fish fillet (x2 size). And the option to add really good guacamole (\"Nick's way\").

Although, if getting what you ordered is important to you, I suppose it is about the food. If getting food to-go DOUBLE CHECK BEFORE YOU LEAVE! \n\nI will be the first to admit that I ordered nachos with kind of odd specifications. Nothing crazy, I just wanted rice on them, and I didn't want a few other things they normally come with. I repeated my order twice, knowing that it might get confusing. The guy nods, I get my food, I leave. \n\nI get all the way home (I had driven there), and open my nachos to find a pile of beans and meat, with a tiny bit of cheese sprinkled on it. WTF. I briefly consider eating before I decide that there's no way I'm eating that, and go all the way back down there. \n\nAll of this is fine to this point, as far as I'm concerned, shit happens. BUT, then I call as I'm on my way, and the guy hassles me! Rushes through my order, tries to demand that I show a receipt (even though I had the nachos with me), and rather than apologizing, asks me \"what do you want me to do about it?\" I say \"I want what I ordered!\" I go through the order again, and ask him to repeat it back to me because I want to make sure he has it, to which he responds, \"No! I don't have time! I'll make sure you get it.\"\n\n....And who is surprised that they messed it up again? I'm fairly convinced they did this on purpose because they were angry with me, but I suppose I can't prove this. But at that point I was hungry and pissed and I just took it and went home. \n\nBottom line: Messed up my order twice, wasting about an hour of my time, and NEVER APOLOGIZED. In fact, when they gave me my second order, they said \"well, we did it this time without a receipt, but we don't usually.\" Like I\"m supposed to be grateful.

We were  supposed to have lunch at El Farolito, but I figured what the hell, new places are always good to explore. First things first. I'm a snob when it comes to new neighborhood spots. I wanted to know if this was an authentic place or if it was catering to the new hipster masses that live in the area. I was in line and I was pretty doubtful of its' authenticity (hint hint). Well the menu was basically good looking; I was in the mood for two tacos, one fish and the other carnitas. Carnitas . That would be my judgement if they were catering to staying real or to the hipsters. If they leave the fat trimmings on, then authentic, if they took it off to cater to the \"low fat, non fat\" people, I would cringe. \n\nOne thing that they had going on was the decorativeness of the place. It was very pretty and cute. Think handpainted flower designs in blue and yellow, and pottery. I felt like I was in a cute little restaurant in Mexico, and yes, I have been there. The restaurant definitely had ambience.\n\nAlas, our food arrives and I am smitten with my first bite because my carnitas taco was close to perfect. The bite I took included a piece of fat in it. Whoo hoo. Authentic. But the meat was a little too tough for my taste but delicious regardless. My fish taco was okay. It didn't really have flavor but I added the chipotle salsa on it so I made it work. My coworkers and I shared a chicken quesadilla (it was huge), I was full, but for Yelp purposes, I tried it. It was very yum yum in my tum tum, ode to Yo Gabba Gabba (I have a 1 year old son, sorry). The guacamole was an excellent addition to it and found it very fresh.\n\nBefore I end this review, would you be interested to know they have a full salsa bar??

We've sampled plenty of other Mexican spots in the Mission but prefer Metate to them all. The food is relatively cheap & great: I've had nearly all their burritos w/ carnitas, al pastor, & pork chile verde my favorites. The gf loves the steak quesadilla. What makes Metate the best in my mind are the horchata, which is the perfect amount of sweet, & the excellent salsas. They don't have a big variety but the primary green & red are both great. Plus the ambiance is wonderful, the chewy chips are delicious, & it never takes long. Good stuff.", "author": "David O."}

It's one of those places I've put up with because it's convenient, but I think this will be my last time here. \nOverall, I'd say Service is a F-, worst I've ever had. Food is a C. \n\nGot burritos and paid more to make them super, but not only did they not include extras, they included what I didn't ask for and forgot what I did ask for. The cashier was probably the rudest that I have ever experienced. I felt like I was in Seinfeld with the Soup Nazi. He wouldn't give me more than one container for salsa per order and he spent a good 30 secs to a minute telling me to hurry up when I was ordering (and I was not indecisive or slow), yet he didn't take the time to correctly take my order. \n\nI actually like the salsa bar that they have, but it is never full. I always end up trying to scrape the bottom of the containers. The burritos are ok. They would be much better if they were actually made correctly. Had the tostada...it was bizarre. It had everything but the kitchen sink...and not in a good way. Oily shell, olives, baby corn???", "author": "Nic V."}

I had to mix two of them together to get a nice thing goin'. \n\nOn the flip side homies:\nThey actually use crema.  Not plain sour cream.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-08-29", "description": "The quest for the fish taco that provides eternal youth already exists within KJeh's Hoo Hah Taco truck.  The secondary quest for just some god lam good fish tacos is one that never ends.  To this date, I've only found two legit places: Nick's Tacos on Irving and Flying Fish Grill in Half Moon way.  With that said, often times, they are good not on the actual fish, but all the condiments and sauces they use to mask a plain tasting piece of fish.  However, the essence of a fish taco is very simple...fried or grilled fish, \ntortilla and some picca de gallo and lettuce.    \n\nEl Metate was purported to have some of the best fish tacos in San Francisco so to celebrate the passing of yet another work week, KDer and I drove here for some dinner after work.  They have an odd set-up.  Initially, we walked into the cashier area, much like every Mexican burrito joint, however, thought this was only for food to go.  So we walked back out, walked into their sit in restaurant and waited patiently to be seated.  A waitress promptly led us back into the vicinity we originally were.  We found out that you order here then just tell the cashier that you want to sit in.  I believe the person who was operating the register that day was the owner and he looked like a kind version of watto. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watto  I ordered two fish tacos and one steak taco while Kder ordered the steak nachos.  The dining area was busy and the food on people's plates looked most savory.  They have a salsa bar however, I did not see all the salsas yelpers have been raving about.  Maybe they ran out?  All they had was chile verde and some red salsa; both were pretty good.  My tacos came out first and the presentation made them look so fucken savory.  Peep pic please.  The chips were very crunchy and thick and you could tell that they were fresh.  The first thing you will notice are the tacos are huge.  I added guac on each for .50 and it was overflowing.  You could not fold it and eat it cleanly.  I ate the steak taco first and this clip sums it up: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX3sEGtG8mQ.  The steak was incredibly dry and just was not good.  The guacamole had a bit of a watery consistency which I wasn't that thrilled about.  I like fresh chunky guacamole.  There was a lot of steak, however, the meat just wasn't great.  The fish tacos were a different story.  They were delicious.  Unlike most other fish tacos I've had in which sauces mask the taste of the fish, you can really taste the flavour here.  It was flaky and moist and had that distinct fish taste.  Nothing more needs to be said.  Kder's nachos were underwhelming.  Again, with ordering steak, it was very dry.    \n\nEl Metate is an average 3 star restaurant for everything BUT THE FISH TACOS.  I recommend you come here for nothing else.  For Mexican food, it was bit expensive.  My tacos were $3.00 each with guac.  To justify it tho, these were not street tacos where you could eat 8 and not be full.", "author": "Brian V."}

Before I began my review I had to process this to figure out why this would possibly anger me in the way it did. \n\nMy conclusion is this: I cannot help that I was born white, and yes, I will admit, there has been more than one time on my life I wish I was born into a large Proud Mexican family. \n(Sometimes the fantasy has been a large Jewish or Italian family, occasionally, Spanish, and at points in my youth I wondered if I was actually Japanese, but that's not consequential in this review, see Japan Town, Woolgrowers, Saul's) \n\nWe've all had a childhood friend who was lucky enough to be born into this reality, who had so many siblings, that your friend's mother just counted you as another one of her own and called you mija (or mijo) and fed you every time you came over, at any hour, whether or not you were hungry. To feel that love and acceptance in spite of my pastey white exterior conjures up the warm-fuzziest of memories. \n\nI guess I relive that on each and every visit to El Metate. I think they remember me when I walk in the door, but even if not, they treat me with the warmth and friendliness of a family member. \n\nI'll admit I order the same thing every visit and this is numbered in the dozens by now, but husband and friends have joined and ordered other meals and have been just as delighted by El Metate. My standard is the veggie burrito with whole pintos, extra salsa (no cheese or sc). Sounds plain, but it is a grilled veggie delight full of marinated broccoli, carrots, some other green stuff and quite possibly an addictive substance because at the mere mention of El Metete, I begin to salivate and crave the burrito, only satiated upon being stuff into my gaping maw. While I eat meat, and I love El Metate, I've never tried anything else, and I know I should. \n\nSadly, about 2 months ago, I had to give up glutenous foods, among them being big, floury, burrito tortillas. Last night, I asked if I could order my beloved burrito deconstructed and they kindly obliged. As it was to-go, and I am who I am, I tore into my box of loose burrito immediately in the car, and discovered they threw in a side of corn tortillas and guacamole!!! I hadn't even thought of that! I can eat corn tortillas as long as they don't have flour these did not. See what I mean? They took care of their g\u00fcera sister. I love them.", "author": "Devileen C."}

Sight because I was blown away by how inexpensive the food was - $7 for a gigantic platter of fresh, moist, tender enchiladas?!  Taste because the food was incredibly flavorful, fresh, and it did not sit heavy or ride high in my tum tum.  \n\nThe d\u00e9cor is simple but aesthetically pleasing - bright colors and great scenery for stuffing my face.  I ordered the chicken enchilada platter - one enchilada with red sauce, the other with green sauce.  They were both equally delicious.  I chose refried beans (choice is between refried, pinto, and black beans) - also amazing.  The topper?  Pepsi hecho en Mexico!  I'm such a sucker for soda in a glass bottle, made with real sugar...until now, I've only ever seen coke in a glass bottle.  So this was a first for me!  \n\nMy boyfriend ordered pork tamales with chile verde, served with pinto beans and rice.  Also delicious, although I preferred my enchiladas (and so did my boyfriend).  We got a cheese quesadilla to supplement...definitely not necessary, we were stuffed with just our platters, but I couldn't resist.  This was a HUGE amount of food.  We took home leftovers.  All said and done, including a tip, we were out the door for just under $25.  I mean, that is just obscenely cheap considering the size and quality of the portions.  \n\nI am pleased to announce that I will regularly be frequenting El Metate from here on out.

After ordering the Chile Relleno  and Fish Tacos plate from the counter,  we were provided a nice full basket of chips.

Each huge plate contained a small guacamole salad,  rice, and whole pinto beans, which I thought were as good as i have had.   My bud enjoyed the Chile Relleno which was swimming in a sauce which she thought was irresistible.   The relleno was fine.  My fish taco consisted of a fairly large piece of fresh fish deep fried in a thicker batter which was a bit thicker than i thought it needed to be and a generous veggie/slaw mixture - giving it a very healthy topping - not the best fish taco I have had,  but still a very satisfying one.

Of course, as expected, they were DELICIOUS. the outer cookie crumbles in your mouth, the dolce melts in your mouth and there was some powdered sugar (i've had some without). \n\nI've been wanting to get another one, but they've been selling out by 1pm! Go early. The owner said he's been selling out ever since he got the new display. I should just ask him to stash a few for me :)", "author": "Rena Y."}

We were disappointed by the fact that they were out today. They have three different kinds of chips: corn, wheat flour, and regular flour. The corn chips were good enough, but the flour chips were greasy and nasty. To be fair, every restaurant I've ever been to that did flour chips didn't really pull them off, so I just say stay away from them. The food was okay. Among us we ordered a quesadilla, a veggie burrito, a steak burrito, and and asada and pastor tacos. The meat was tender and tasted good enough. This is not a full service restaurant. They have a cashier and we seat ourselves. But the staff is very attentive and the manager/owner came to our table to make sure we were happy. That's customer service!", "author": "Arturo G."}

I ordered a super burrito and to my surprise the dish was brought to my table within seconds. Seriously, it took about 30 seconds to be ready! Come on less than a minute is not enough time to even wrap the burrito! Anyway, once I opened it it was cold and it was to obvious that the burrito was made a long time ago and it was sitting somewhere in the kitchen. I left with the feeling that the burrito they gave me was a dish they made by mistake and then they kept it and waited for the next person they could sell it too. Unluckily, I was the sucker who ended up eating someone's else cold meal. I liked this place a lot and I have been at El Metate at least 30 times; however, because of my last experience I probably won't come back.

I might even go as far to say that it was cold. Clear indicator was the cheese wouldn't melt. The tortilla was also hard and crunchy in spots.

It's seriously the best deal in town for Mexican food, and arguably all restaurants in general.  Including McDonalds.  Seriously?  Consider this:\n\n20 bucks = a metric yard of burritos.  Seriously.\n\nUnlike most Potretro/Mission Mexican eatery establishments it is unusually clean and spacious.  They actually had to draw fake cracks on the wall to make it look authentic!  I was even a little weirded out by the space age cash register in the front.  You could also show up with 20 people here unannounced and you'll be fine.  It's a giant cave.\n\nThe food is above average, as is the service.  I asked for the very best/most popular burrito and the very friendly cashier wove some custom concoction together for me, then it was hand delivered by a man in glistening white clothing, straight out of a detergent commercial, all smiles and mustaches.  These people are angelic.\n\nThis is the Cuban \"La Carreta\" equivalent of Mexican eateries.  Nothing blew my mind yet, but I've only a small taste of the menu.

I gravitated towards El Metate as a result, and I really do think that their grub Ive ordered is good. Juicy Al Pastor, good fish, good soup, nice tortas (but seemed to be better when they were at their little annex convenience store next door), nice staff, but be sure to get your food to go, because the clientele are HORRIBLE. So bad, in fact, that the place loses a star, even though it's not really the fault of the restaurant. *That* is how much it compromises the culinary experience.\n\nImagine all of the patrons from a Whole Foods market and a Rainbow Grocery and cram all of their rude asses into one small space, and that's El Metate. and.. it's gotten worse over the years.\n\nHere are a few quick reasons why El Metate, a place with pretty good food, should be TO GO only.\n\n- The patronage have ZERO concept of salsa bar etiquette i.e. ONE PERSON AT A TIME, especially with a bar as small as E.M.s. What salsa-related emergency warrants you getting up into my personal space so you can have some cucumbers RIGHT NOW?\n\n- They ask insanely stupid, time-sucking questions when they reach the counter \"What's your best burrito? How is the soup today?\" How do you think the soup is? It's hot and filled with ingredients. Look at the menu while in line, instead of doing stuff to your iPhone, and maybe you will find these non-questions as irrelevant as the rest of us.\n\n- They smack of attitude and self-entitlement, \"OMG, I dont even know what line Im in!\" (hint: there is only one, and you're not in it)  \"Let me just give you some money and you can buy me a soda!\" The whiny girly-girl who asked me that proceeded to get quite flustered and upset when, instead of being her personal shopping boy, I offered for her to cut in front of me to buy the soda herself. \"No! FINE! WHAT-EVER!\" Um ok,, then go back to gringo-land, you nasty person. Last time I do a favor for someone in that place.\n\nThis taqueria has become so synonymous with people of this ilk, it's to the point I am actually embarrassed to be seen in there. \n\nWhen I go in to order, I keep my head down until I reach the counter, order, and get out as quickly as I can, because the experience can be so irritating and grating that the longer the exposure, the more unhealthy it feels.\n\nIt is good their food is decent, (it really is) because most of their customers are absolute shit-heads.\n\nIn short: \n\nFood = four stars\nAtmosphere = toxic\n\nTo Go Only\n\nI think I need to find a new neighborhood place.", "author": "Jonny P."}

The first time I went, I received one of the most delicious burritos I've ever had.\n\nUnfortunately, every time I've gone since then they've gotten my order very wrong. My preferred meal is a steak burrito (steak, rice, and beans in a tortilla). Instead, they serve me a super burrito (+ sour cream, guac, and cheese, three foods which I do not enjoy, and which they charge extra for), even after I say \"not super\". When I've pointed out the mistake, they've made me a new burrito... that still contains the ingredients I don't want, leaving me eat a very disappointing meal. I'm sure this problem stems from the fact that the employee who takes the orders will answer the phone while I'm mid sentence with him, and won't let me clarify my order if I think he's gotten it wrong.\n\nThe food at El Metate is great... if you can get the food you want.

The outside chairs and tables will remind you of the decor found in Mexico (which they probably got it from =P ), and makes it look so lively.  The inside seating area is nicer and more spacy... but on a nice SF day, why not take advantage of the outside seating area with the umbrellas! \n\nI got the Colorado burrito ( i think that's what it was called) that came with colorado chile, steak, and potatoes.  I thought it would be similar to a california burrito found in SoCal, but I was so wrong.  The burrito was good, but like many other mexican restaurants, it comes with too much rice, and too little meat. It was flavorful and not spicy... but where was the meat!!  Seriously.  The salsa was a watery red liquid that lacked flavor.  The chips were really good and fresh, but it would have been nice to have a good salsa to dip it in!   They also have these fresh fruit drinks that are DELICIOUS!!!! I wish I had gotten one, but I tried my friend's strawberry drink, and MAN, it was soooo refreshing!  They had multiple flavors: strawberry, horchata, cantaloupe, watermelon, and some others.  Get one, it's only $1.50 and REALLY GOOD.\n\nThe place is pretty popular for lunch and has ample seating for groups, but I think I prefer Taqueria San Francisco (even tho it's less nice).

Did I ever tell you how I don't like burritos in this city.  I don't.  Bite me.  So, when I went to sit down in the dining area what did I see, a bunch of people eating tortas.  WTF!  I now know that to get their tortas one has to visit the shop next door.  I can't even remember what meat i got in my burrito, but i did want a little cup of salsa to dip my chips in.  Anywho, the dining area at El Metate is nice that a lot of other taquerias, seperate from the counter with almost a sit down restaraunt feel.\n\nAnywho, on a whim I got one of the alfajores sitting on the counter, I thought it was a little spendy for a cookie, but I have a sweet tooth that will make me weigh 450 lbs some day, and the friendly employee dude told me how they raised the price because everywhere else they charged twice as much for them and that they were homemade by a little blind lady or something.  Oh, alfajores are shortbread cookies stuffed with dulce de leche, they look like a negative oreo.  You know what, by the end of my burrito I was way too full to completely enjoy the cookie, so I stuck it in my murse and rode around town to do this and that.  A week later after going to the market i unpacked my bag and found my poor forgotten alfajore in the side pocket of my murse.\n\nDid I forget to talk about how i rode up and down Van Ness, Harrison, and Folsom before heading up Bryant and finding El Metate?  I think i did like 10 miles in 20 block radius.  Anyway, that was my stupid fault, not El Metate, I can't really rate a place according to my stupidity.  \n\nSo, I think Mr. Alfajore sat on my counter for another day until while making dinner one day I decided to pop open his little plastic tub and take a bite.  \n\nWHOA!  This cookie was awesome.  Really light and flakey shortbread cookie and creamy, caramelly filling.  I couldn't resist eating the whole thing before my dinner was done cooking.  It was amazing!\n\ni'll go back one day to check out a torta, maybe even remember how to get there.  And maybe be fantasizing about my alfajore until i go back for another one (sorry mint CocoJo, I'm totally cheating on you, I know).\n\nOK, so went back for the Torta this weekend and I'd have to say it was pretty good.  I got the Ranchero with chicken milanesa, nicely cooked/breaded/crunchy.  I likes the spiciness of the jalepeno, the creaminess of the avocado and the cheese in it is amazing fresh farm cheese stuff (I was expecting jack).  And the chipolte sauce also added a nice smoky kick.  I decided to get soup over chips and was not disappointed.  Tortilla soup with still slightly crunchy chips, more cheese, lots of chicken and very yummy broth.  I found the chicken a bit dry, but overall the soup was good.  All of this for only a little more than a fiver is pretty fricken bitchen.  I only ate half my sannie and saved the rest for later.  Also, had to have another alfajore, YUM!\n\nOh yeah it was SUCH a nice day in SF that I sat out on the sidewalk, so nice.", "author": "Adrian L."}

Like we don't patronize enough taquerias... Living in Potrero and the Mission with the whole 24th Street corridor in between us... I'm really going to be annoyed with myself if I yelp another taqueria... What can I say, alright? We drink a lot of booze, have a lot of morning sex, and eat a lot of burritos. This is the PERFECT MAN FOR ME.\n\nAnyway, El Metate is so pretty on the outside. It really always intrigued me for that reason... Most Mission taquerias are nasty-looking. But not this one. It's a cheerful yellow stucco building on the end of a drab block of Bryant, and they even use, like, Comic Sans font on their signage or something. As if to say, \"Eat here! Even though one block over there are a MILLION TAQUERIAS WITH THE SAME FOOD! Because our food is joyful! And comic! Comic Sans! Happy, happy tacos!\"\n\nAnd inside, the happiness theme continues. It's bright and cheerful and -- small. You pretty much should never go here when it's raining, because you're going to end up sitting outside nine times out of ten. \n\nBut, the happiness theme ALSO continued in my stomach. Their fish tacos are really good. Mmm mmm mmm good. The fish were swimming around and flipping in my tummy saying, \"We're so happy to make you happy! Eat that entire huge portion in front of you! We taste sooo good just for you and NO stomach acid doesn't burn so don't feel bad! We're smiling down here! EAT MORE!\"\n\nHow did I know this?

When I want something - he will usually agree 90% of the time, not necessarily to please me but rather because I am craving something he loves too.  \n\nBut one cuisine in which we never agree is Mexican.  I am just not a big fan of Mexican food, and he loves it like none other.  In my defense, before all you taco-lovers crucify me in your minds, I like almost all food.  There are only four things to know about me regarding food - -  I do NOT eat chicken feet, I don't much like pizza, I don't like ice cream in general, and Mexican food is my least favorite.  I appreciate a good burrito once in awhile, and I live and die for nachos, but it's rare that I get hungry and start craving Mexican food.\n \nBut I am not hing if not compromising every once in awhile, and combine that with my incredible hunger on this day -  I was agreeable to most ANYTHING.  So when he meekly asked, \"Mexican...?\" all I could do was nod and say, \"Whatever, just go!\" while I was keeled over in the front seat.\n \nWe pass 236 other restaurants (and I can smell ALL the food) to pull up to a rather bright yellow restaurant called \"El Metate\".  Even in my near-comatose state, I noticed the place with the outdoor seating and lots of people even at this odd hour of 3 pm.  \n\n*BOING*  This place looks pretty good, I make a note to myself.\n \nYou walk in and order.\nService is about as non-existent as any Chinese or Vietnamese joint, but they took our order and within 5-10 minutes, served up our food.  I ordered two fish tacos ($2.50 each) and Robbie-Boy ordered the enchilada plate.  Lest you think that two fish tacos is all I can eat - make no mistake, dinner was to be in about 3 hours and I just needed to hold myself over until then.  So, two fish tacos, it would be.\n \nInitially, we sat outside.\nBut due to the cold weather, we moved indoors and walking in, I decided I really liked this place.  Against the walls, and spread out all over every table was the biggest array of hot sauces I have ever seen, consisting of every spicy pepper known to mankind.  Anyone who knows me knows I love me some HOT SAUCE!\n \nI woofed down two fish tacos in exactly 14.6 seconds, with perhaps a pint of hot sauce on each.\nAnd it was good.  Crispy fried fish that tasted fresh, with piles of lettuce and other goodies on top, laid out on tortillas.\n\n*GULP*... *GULP*\n \nI was full and all was well with the world again.\n\nI woofed down my lunch with the aid of the aguas frescas they had available - which I had in strawberry.  Very sweet, not normally my thing, but for this lunch, it worked.\n \nAs a sidenote, their tortilla chips are not that great - rather tasteless.  But their salsa was  good, especially after I poured the habanero hot sauce into it.  Delicious.\n \nEl Metate would be a great place to come to with friends for cold Coronas and lots of food.  It's cheap, it's fast, and it's large enough to hold a group of friends comfortably - - and you can chatter to your heart's content w/ nobody giving you any grief about it.\n \nMake no mistake - - Mexican food is still not a favorite of mine, but El Metate is cool nonetheless.", "author": "Grace K."}

I knew I wanted a burrito, but had no idea where to satisfy that craving for something new. I decided I'd get the 27 whichever way it was going. And right about when I stepped out onto Bryant, one came headed towards the heart of the mission. On I went.\n\nKeeping an eye out for anything Mexican - 18th turned into 19th, then 20th, then 21st, and right about 22nd and Bryant, El Metate appeared.\n\nA nice modern exterior covered a warm and inviting interior. Christmas lights were everyone, and the guy behind the counter tells me he loves Christmas, and always wants the place feel festive. Nice.\n\nBurrito didn't blow me away, especially with the lack of wheat tortillas, but there was much to love - no problem getting more black beans instead of rice, and no charge for lettuce.\n\nAnd did I mention the cost? No? Try $4.75, which was one of the best burrito deals ever. Satisfaction/cost ratio was outstanding.\n\nSealing the fifth star - the 27 showed up going the opposite way as I headed out, confirming good karma exudes from this little slice of burrito heaven.", "author": "Jason B."}

Two words: fish tacos.\n\nI went here for lunch yesterday and was blown away by the fish tacos. This after having a heated discussion with a friend about how Mexican places seem to be the talked about genre when it comes to comparisons. You know what I'm talking about. They always contain these sentences: \n\n\"You have to try the burritos from _______!\" \n\"I can't believe you haven't had the tacos from _________!\"\n\"What! You're crazy! These are no where near as good as the ones from ________.\"\n\nYou've all been there. \n\nThe gauntlet was thrown, so I agreed to go because I was hoping to wave my finger in his face about how it was the same as everywhere else. \n\nHe won. Whatever. \n\nWhen I made my way home after work, I tried to describe the experience to my wife, and it was nearly impossible. I just kept rambling on about the consistency of the bite and how even the cilantro involved made it better. (I actually HATE cilantro) Eventually, she walked away leaving me unsatisfied with my verbal skills. I was babbling like a drunken 5th grader with a seven-word vocabulary. \n\nThere is no way I can do this place justice. Please just stop in, get two fish tacos and enjoy. Maybe shoot me a note on how I can best describe the delicious that happens during your experience. Apparently, I need help.", "author": "Ian G."}

I entered the dining room and expected to be waited on. There was only a couple there and nothing else was happening. After a long while, we were finally told that we had to go to the other room to order. (Slap on my forehead!). Order in the kitchen or other room and then sit down in the dining room! Okay, it shows I'm such a newbie. This is what I get for circling four times around the block looking for a parking space. I'm tired and I need to sit down and eat! I love the Horchata, more creamy than usual ones. I had the chicken enchilada. It came on a big plate with guac, sour cream, Spanish rice and black beans. I love the condiment corner. They had some sort of cantaloupe condiment. I can eat a bowlful, but I had will power. By the time, I ate my plate, I was super full any way. I can't wait to go back there and try the burrito. I also loved the hard chips, which comes out wrapped in yellow paper with the order. It got my dentures cracking. I can really afford to eat here, because my order was under $10 with a little tip!", "author": "Helen L."}

This review is more a 3.5 stars, but I am always a bit more generous hoping for a better round two.\nI ordered the fish burrito with all the stuff, as well as a Pinapple Agua Fresca and chips and salsa.\nThe chips were definitely of the same grain as the burrito tortilla and they were perfectly fried.  But interestingly where I appreciated the chips I found the tortilla to be a bit much.  I love me the lard like anyone else, but it was just too overwhelming.  The other problem is I barely tasted any sour cream or salsa of any sort.  I needed more of that and less rice and beans.  Also, I waited till I got home to eat my burrito which gave it about 25 minutes to sit in the foil.  The fish had definitely lost some of that crunch.\nI am not giving up on this place and next time around will wait around to chow my eats.", "author": "Sheila Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-10-19", "description": "Good but not great.  Seeing that this place gets 4 starts, I must say I had pretty high expectations.  Also I have not had Mexican food for maybe 6 months so I was starved for some really tasty tacos.  El Metate was set up for a stellar experience and review, but it disappointed.  I ordered a variety of tacos (bistec Mexicana, al Pastor Carnitas and fish).  Overall the fish taco was the best.  I was kind of hoping for more of a grilled fish taco to make it lighter, but deep fried is fine.  The beef and the pork was dry and did not have a huge amount of flavor.  For me, the difference between average Mexican food and great Mexican food is that great Mexican food can exploit the fresh and bright flavors of cilantro, lime, onions to enhance the heavier meats and cheese.  El Metate really didn't do this. The meat had good meat flavor, but that was kind of it.  It sat on your palate like a brick.  This is typically what I experience at average Mexican places.  Overall I would give this two stars but I will give it a one star bonus for a few reasons.  The fish taco was juicy and tasty (even though I really didn't want a fried fish taco).  Also the horchata was a nice refreshing drink.  Lastly, the restaurant itself was bright and welcoming (but don't expect a lot of service--this is very much of a self serve type of operation).  It would be a fun place to have some drinks and some finger food with friends, but for food on its own, I would rather go to a good taco truck.", "author": "Scott C."}

El Metate has good burritos for sure, but I can't say if they're better than say El Farolito or Papalote. I usually get either the fish burrito or the al pastor and both are delicious. The al pastor is a little different and kind of reminds me of beef brisket. The roomy eating area is clean and nicely decorated, a rarity among burrito places.

Even so...the fish tacos here are DAMN GOOD! The fish was breaded and fried, but it was not heavy or greasy. The cheese, lettuce, and salsa were extremely fresh and refreshing. The squeeze of lime brought out all the flavors of the ingredients. The only thing that threw me off was the rice. I'm not used to rice in fish tacos and I can't say that I like it. There were several bites in which I only got rice. Perhaps increasing the fish to rice ratio would make a better taco.\nThe carnitas torta mexicano was also delicious. The carnitas was moist, tender, and flavorful. The combination of refried beans, lettuce, tomato, red onion, avacado, jalapeno, and mayo gave the torta a wide range of flavors and somehow came together nicely. The torta also came with a side of tortilla soup. The soup was pretty flavorful, with generous portions of vegetables. The chicken in the soup was soft and tender. The tortillas were soaked in the soup, but still managed to add a crunchy texture to each bite.\nEl Metate offers fresh and delicious food at very affordable prices. The fish tacos aren't quite like I had in Kauii, but they are cheaper and more convenient, since I don't need a plane ticket to get them!", "author": "Siao W."}

Or get a chile relleno IN your burrito. OMG.\n\nThe burritos here aren't as big as you might be used to, if you are accustomed to El Farolito, or Castillito (my former favorite veggie burrito), but they are just the right size. With the other gigantic Mission burritos, I always have to save the last third for later.

That really makes a good veggie burrito great.\n\nMy BF almost always gets the quesadilla suiza, and it always looks and smells soooo good. I have to recommend it on his behalf.\n\nThe owner (Pancho?), who is not at the front counter as much anymore since their tiendita opened on the corner, is super friendly.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-12-23", "description": "This is a review about a food-poisoning experience.  \n\nBeen in the Mission District for roughly 60 years.  While waiting to meet a contractor, I stopped in to the El Metate restaurant and take out on Bryant near 22nd street.  Hadn't eaten all day, so I asked for one of the larger meals, the Del Mar which includes breaded fish, oysters and/or clams, rice and vegetables.  \n\nThe Tip\nWasn't wearing my glasses, but really didn't think I needed to cuz my order was take out, not dining.  So I didn't think to leave a tip.  The cashier had to show me where to sign the receipt.  \n\nNext, the cashier asked if they had everything to make the meal.  Two cooks responded simultaneously.  Four cooks began cooking one one stove top, while another, a fifth, started cooking on the other, cooking the breaded fish filets.  I watched, but the other four cooks closed in together (I couldn't even see in between their arms.)  So I went outside to look through the window.  I first noticed one cook preparing the shelled oysters/claims/muscles.  He held the pan high up in the air.  I also noted there was very little oil in the pan:  it was as if he was touching the flame now and then, but letting the shelled fish cook high above, perhaps a foot or more above the flame.  Then another cook moved over and was positioned to block my view from the sidewalk.  After they were done, I noticed how there were exceses of rice and vegetables (usually bell peppers) piled into the styrofoam container.  The other cook, the fifth cook, never put the breaded fish into the container.  \n\nAlarmed by the cooking methods as well as the lack of breaded fish, I surmised that this was all about not leaving a tip.  I didn't really care about pointing out to anyone that there wasn't any breaded fish, even though it was certainly cooked.  (My Kaiser physician voiced a belief he had about foods made with bread that is cooked in oil may be responsible for a diabetic condition where the oily bread blocks the cellular pores that insulin fits into, thus obstructing glucose (food energy) from nourishing those cells.  So I ignored the missing fish item(s); usually there are two, I believe.  \n\nWhen I got back home, the contractor called to say he would be a half hour late.  So I sat down to have my meal--well, what was left of it.  (Again, I didn't really mind not having the breaded fish because of its possible relationship to diabeties; but I did mind them not telling me.  I figured one or more wanted to get back at me for not leaving a tip.)  \n\nWhen the contractor arrived, I explained the project, and then asked him, the usual, when I could expect a bid.  I got home about 8 P.M. or so, and then began to check my emails.  By 10 P.M., I felt sick.  So I laid down.  Started to get cold, unusually cold.  In fact, it kind of felt as if my blood were leaking someplace cuz I kept getting colder and colder around the chest, shoulder, and head areas.  \n\nHaving a background in biological sciences--including anatomy, physiology, and nutrition--I let myself think this was normal, this much cold--well, because it was a big meal.  (As I understand the nutritional aspect, when you consume food(s), especially when they pass from the stomach and into the first foot or so of your small intestine, the ilium, a lot of your blood rushes to that area carrying molecules for digestion--breaking food particles into different categories and then transporting each of those particles into the blood system.)  Problem was, never have I felt so much blood go down into this digestive process:  I felt as if I was literally freezing.  If it continued, I believe I would have blacked out.  \n\nOnly, I felt a sensation just beyond the sphincter muscle between the stomach and the ilium.  The sensation was signalling me to throw up what was in my ilium at that location.  (My wife says that's impossible, to throw up any food beyond your sphincter muscle cuz that's what the sphincter muscle is for, to prevent food from backing up into the stomach.)  Well, I did, even if this is a first.  Anyway, after I coughed up a portion of a muscle, I felt better; it took me a moment, but I felt better.  \n\nStill cold, I laid down in bed again--covers all around me and even a space heater near me.  Then I began to feel that throw up sensation again--only, it was only slight, as if it were just the left-over film of liquid around the piece of muscle or clam that I had thrown up, the act of which made me feel better.  The signals were weak, to weak for me to get up again.  But I could feel the toxic film of liquid move on down the intestine.  By the time this weak sensation was about 8 inches beyond the ilium, I dropped into sleep.  By 3 a.m., I was awake.  \n\nI called the police to report the unusual manner in which the cooks cooked the order.  They attempted to focus on the report as if it was just a common occurence of food poisoning from toxic sea food.  You, of course, are free to derive your own interpretation.", "author": "Ken S."}

The plan was to start early, two-ish, on a Saturday and alternate between tacos and drinks until we all ended up in the hospital...or the gutter.  Admittedly, this was a high-class, can't fail idea which I was wishing I'd thought of myself.  We got somewhat delayed by the weather which, being the second day of Spring, pretty much demanded that we lounge about Dolores Park with the all the other Missionites for most of the afternoon.  Just for the record, no, we did not bring our johnny-come-lately-looks-good-but-i-don't-know -how-to-ride-it fixed gears and no, we didn't feel smug drinking Tecate tallboys in paper bags...come on folks, think outside the hipster box for once, you cowards.\n\nWhere was I?  Ok, yeah, tacos.  By the time we got around to the abridged taco tour, we randomly settled on 3 places, and we might have hit more if El Metate hadn't ended the tour on such a high note.  I will only say this about the chile verde pork tacos...\n\n...sorry, I got nuthin'.  I've a sore throat and I'm kinda tired so words are failing.  But they were good.  Man, they were good.  They've been haunting my dreams good.  The pork is perfectly juicy, tender, and  flavorful.  There wasn't a lot of talking at the table, just a lot of head-shaking, nodding, ecstatic grimaces, and pointing at our plates.  The fish tacos were also great, as were the chips and salsa.  Many hot sauces to chose from as well.  The service was prompt and very friendly and fun.  Nice, colorful back room to eat in.

I also ordered a 1/2 pint of salsa to go, this was before I saw the different types of salsa listed on the menu. The \"hot salsa\" is of the watery, pureed persuasion, but wasn't overly vinegary. The salsa fresca was as it should be, but missing chile heat.\r\nThe register guy was super nice and I'm looking forward to hitting it up for lunch, trying the chile verde, and some of the other salsas.

The space is very small but it looks like they are expanding.  The thing will be if they will still be good then.  The prices are very fair and the people working there are cool.  My only complaint was that it was not very comfortable.  The seats were not comfortable and it was cold.  Believe me I am no baby but I like to have a decent place to sit and enjoy a hot meal,  not one that cools down in 30 secs due to a cold room.  I really hope that the expanison will not affect the quality of the food.  Best new Mexican for me and I will recommend for a quick meal but not for a comfortable meal.  hell I guess is all you can ask at the prices they charge.", "author": "Bucky W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-04-21", "description": "The burritos here seem a little different from burritos else where.  The first time I came here, it was only because it was a couple of blocks away from where I was working at the time and I wasn't expecting much.  The veggie burrito here uses 'seasonal vegetables' and I don't know if I came during the wrong season my first time, but I couldn't get past the fact that there was broccoli, carrots, and peas in my burrito.\n\nSo, I avoided it at first for a little bit.  Then I came back a few months later and asked them to use black beans instead.  This, for some reason totally changed the veggie burrito.  The sauteed carrots, broccoli, and other 'seasonal' vegetables in there were now getting in to my stomach regularly because of these burritos.\n\nAnd let me rewind for a second: these are the best black beans I've had over at any taqueria (at least in my opinion).  The refried black beans at that other place are good, but those are refried.  These are just plain black beans and they do them proper. \n\nI've had the grilled steak burrito and that wasn't so great.  It may've been timing (in that I got the driest part of the steak that'd been sitting around for a while) but I can only say that the grilled steak sucked the one time I had it in my burrito.\n\nI had what I think was the shredded beef burrito (the colorado sauce or whatever) and that was real good.  Funny story behind that: I was actually ordered a veggie burrito on my way back home to the East Bay but got someone else's order and didn't notice til I took my first bite out of it on the Bay Bridge (yes, I was that hungry).  In short, it was good.\n\nI've heard, but can't say I know this as I've never tried it, that the fish tacos are really good here as well.\n\nFinally, the salsa & chips here leave much, very much left to be desired.  Unfortunately, the salsa here is really just a blend of something with hot-sauce.\n\nAmbiance: More of a hole-in-the-wall place though they do have a couple of tables outside where it can be really pleasant on a lot of days.  Of course, you might want to come one or two hours off of lunch time just because they might be occupied.", "author": "Anx R."}

As advertised, the carnitas were just right and oh so tasty. My wife and I also tried the fish tacos. Also tasty. Lastly, she had (and I sampled) a Prawn burrito. Muy bien. Not 5 stars, though, in my book. The main reason is that they don't have good salsa. They give some watery salsa-like fluid and then have all those bottled hot sauces around to augment/alter the flavor of your meal. Not that I don't love Cholula, but I could have really gone for some of the Farolito green salsa with that fantastic carnitas burrito. Food gets 5 stars, overall gets 4.", "author": "Scott M."}

Its always fresh and full of flavor. I read some of the comments below and just laughed when some floks complained about the place yet their bad experience had nothing to do with the food. Like getting booted in the shoulder with a soccer ball outside or not getting enough chips. To those people I say we dont want you here anyways, GO AWAY!

If you have an extra ten minutes go somewhere good, like Taqueria Guadalajara, where the juke box is extra loud and the soccer/telenovela can get intense.", "author": "mathew p."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-12-02", "description": "3 months in the city...And this is my go-to place for a burrito. Hailing from down south it is very hard to compare the Mexican food between San Diego and San Fran so I have finally given up. Both cities have their own take on what a truly good burrito consists of so therefore this burrito is based on the \"San Fran\" burrito (steamed pressed, wrapped in foil w/ rice and beans) On that note, El Metate is great and I absolutely love the service. Everything on the menu is great and affordable. I usually go with the Chile Colorado (think carne asada burrito w/ potato's and enchilada sauce) and a tall Modelo from the Liquor store down the street - can't go wrong. I've also had the fish tacos (No SD by any means) as well as an 'old trusty' if you are in the know. Both are great. I would give El Metate an additional .5 star if they had better salsa/hot sauce - though tasty, their one hot sauce (salsa) is not spicy. In the end, 1. Grab a beer in a brown bag 2. Order what you want 3. Sit outside and enjoy...", "author": "Stan W."}

It's true.  The tacos, burritos, and quesadillas are all excellent.  3 years ago when we first found this taqueria, there were never lines, and the prices were about 25% cheaper.  Now every night at 6pm the tiny little space, recently expanded with some redesign, has a line out the door.  Though missing the slightly cheaper prices and yearning for that feeling like it's your own little spot no one else knows about, it's great to see that it's been fully discovered.", "author": "Beth S."}

I was headed down to 24th St. in search of a burrito one Saturday after being out a bit late the night before.  On my way, I noticed a place across the street with a string of lights above the door.  I was wondering if perhaps it was a restaurant when I saw a fellow walking out of it with a stack of \"to go\" trays!  I was very excited because this is very close to my house.  I walked into El Metate and immediately fell in love with place.  I love the bright decor and the selection of different hot sauces on the wall.  I ordered my buritto to go and took it home.  When I finished it, I immediately called my good friend back in Wisconsin and raved about my new favorite taqueria that's practically right around the corner from my house.  I've actually tried several different menu items there and while the burritos are still my favorite, I would recommend anything.  The guys who work there are friendly and the prices are reasonable.", "author": "Sara H."}
