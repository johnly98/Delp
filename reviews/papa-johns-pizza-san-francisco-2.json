We ordered the extra large with Canadian bacon and sausage. I walked a few minutes to picked up the preordered very hot pie and called Uber to drive me back to the hotel; for a total elapsed time of 20 minutes from the initial call.\n\nThe undercarriage was nicely browned and the crust was surprisingly very good.The cheese pulled somewhat and the toppings were very good. The sauce was sweeter than I would have liked but it does provide an interesting ingredient for a fun to eat pizza. $10.95 special, ten slices. Papa John's is the third largest take out pizza chain, and their pizza is better tasting than many restaurants' pizza.\n\nHere's the ingredient list:\nhttps://www.papajohns.com/company/papa-johns-ingredients.html", "author": "Jerry P."}

Whoever is on shift right now needs to be trained to handle their customers more like we actually matter instead of asking us to \"hold\" and then blowing us off. I guess since I don't seem to matter after being a loyal customer since before the Sutter location opened, I should start ordering from Dominos and Pizza Hut.

At first, I doubted it, but after taking a few bites of that steaming hot goodness, my mindset was completely changed. My eyes were opened, and my life was cleansed. I walked into the establishment and was greeted by the god himself, Papa John. He told me that he was going to be stepping down from his position as CEO  of Papa Johns pizza. I cried and told him multiple times not to, but he insisted. Steve Richie stepped into the building. John stared at him menacingly. John quickly grabbed a container of parmesan and sprinkled it in Steven eyeballs. Steve screamed as me and Papa ran to the back of the kitchen where we stole ALL of the pizza. We jumped into the getaway car and drove to the nearest bank. I walked up to the bank manager. \"I would like to trade this pizza for $500,000.\" I said. The manager agreed, and handed me the money. He asked for the pizza, but I bounced. John was waiting in the car, and I hopped in the back. The bank called the police. A couple minutes in driving, we had the cops on our tail. We drove faster and faster, until our car hit the limit. The engine was over heated, and was going to explode. I looked into Papa John's eyes and whispered into his ear... \"Better ingredients, Better pizza.\" The car exploded and I saw John fly miles into the sky. I jumped out of the burning vehicle onto the road. I am currently writing this review in the hospital, I had broken both my legs from the incident.

In the interest of objectivity I selected \"Papa's Favorite\" (pepperoni and sausage). To make sure it was a fair evaluation, I got an order of buffalo wings and an 8\" mega chocolate chip cookie. And I added 3 garlic butter sauces to my order, for science.\n\nMy order was submitted at 6:59 and was delivered at 7:18. Granted, I live just a few blocks away (I'm not lazy; I was controlling the variables!), but that is still freaking impressive. The driver used our tricky call box correctly, rather than phoning me to be let in, passing my litmus test for delivery.\n\nThe pizza surpassed my expectations. It is definitely among the better chain pizzas. I liked the sauce and appreciated the generous amount of cheese. The crust was on the soft side and buckled under the weighty toppings, but wasn't soggy. However the sausage was only a grade above \"rabbit poo pellets.\" The wings were incredibly soggy, typical of pizza places without deep fryers, but they were also large and tasty. I can see the mega cookie being a hit with groups, as it really helps stretch the pizza. \n\nYou MUST order online via the special offers page. I paid $14 for my large (usually $19.99) and got $1 off on the cookie. The wings were regular price- 8 for $7.

Its not as complex as Round Table but better and fresher feeling than Dominos and Pizza Hut.

There is no reason you should be reading this review unless you are from another country where they don't have these. Its like reading a review for Mcdonalds.

They didn't even cover the whole slice.  Their was a very small section near the middle of each slice, (around the whole pie)that had ANY toppings on it. I'm talking not enough toppings to throw over a handful of chips and call it nachos.  Like literally two table spoons of all of the above vegetables combined sprinkled in a slim trail on my giant Xlarge Pizza. Also barely any sauce.\n\nI got Garlic instead of olives. somehow there was (No Exxageration) a minimum of between 4-6 garlic cloves, PER SLICE.  Would have loved to have see the Bell Peppers, Mushrooms, single onion slice or teaspoon of diced (not sliced) tomatoes given this type of attention.\n\nI literally put sauce on top of their slices, added fresh chopped vegetables, spices, and cheese and baked it in the oven for 10-12 minutes to make it decent.\n\nAVOID.

After my pizza was taking nearly 2 hours to get to me I had called the location about the status.  The first person I spoke to said it had gone out for delivery at 7:30, it was now 8:30 so it wasn't making sense.  I was put on hold to speak to a manager but during that time I got a text from the driver saying he was downstairs.  I went and no one was there.  \n\nI called back and got the manager. He was immediately defensive, says the driver was there and couldn't get a hold of me and has been wasting valueable time trying to make ME happy.  He talked over me and I wouldn't let me tell my side of the story.  After sternly asking \"can I please talk\" I shared my version which, I placed an order nearly 2 hours ago, my buzzer never rang but I got a text but still no one at the door, pizza taking over an hour to deliver, all sorts of issues.  He again was defensive, arrogant, and made zero effort to rectify the situation which very much frustrated me. He then said he didn't like MY attitude (one of a frustrated customer trying to get answers and a pizza) and he wasn't willing to help me and hung up on me! \n\nI then get a knock on my door a few minutes later (9pm) and the driver had called my building manager to let him in.  Turns out dispatch gave him the wrong apt # which explains the failed attempts. So kudos to the driver for not giving up and ensuring customer satisfaction but at that point I was too angry to eat. \n\nHad the manager employed some problem solving and customer service 101 skills before jumping to the conclusion that I was somehow at fault then this situation could have been avoided.
