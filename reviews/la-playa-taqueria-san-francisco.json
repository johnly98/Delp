I was pretty hungry after work after not eating all day -- so I decided, why not? They aren't the best, but it's some food... That's was big mistake. \n\nI ordered the shrimp burrito with black beans. I learned that because of the woman's attitude, that if I add a tip to my credit card charge, I might get a little better service. This time... she and the cook talked about me in front of me, assuming I couldn't understand what they were saying. What happened was when my burrito came up... they had a little back and forth about how I had wanted black beans, but the cook at used pinto instead. It was determined that he didn't make it right -- but they agreed to give it to me instead, since it was \"to go\". She turned around and said, \"yeah it's yours\". I didn't believe her but hesitantly took it, thinking, well I can handle eating pinto beans even if she lied to me. \n\nTurns out the burrito was as disgusting as it gets. It had some sort of sloppy mayo sauce mixed with shredded iceberg -- and no beans at all. It was a soupy mess. Also the first bite I took had a shrimp skin and it felt like I had chewed on someone's gnasty finger nail! \n\nI actually drove back with my burrito and gave it back to them. She barely looked at me, took it and went over to the cook, and they snickered. She said to me, we're making you a new one. I said I didn't want it and wanted my money back. She gave it back, but tried to keep the tip. But she gave it back when I asked for it. Now I feel sick and have lost my appetite completely. I don't know why they are still in business, especially with all of the burrito places in SF! These people are rude and the burritos suck. I only eat there out of desperation. But from now on, I think I would rather starve to death.", "author": "C L."}

Then when i get home i realized she didnt give us the side of beans with the quesadilla.   Not a big deal but its the principle. \n\nThe food itself was TERRIBLE!  I took two bites of the carne asada burrito and threw the rest out. It wasnt fresh and the beef was bland & chewy. I never waste food but this sh*t was gross.  The fish taco was just as bad.

When I realized it was National Taco Day (Tuesday, October 4th, 2016), I decided I wanted tacos for dinner. The usual spots on the way home seemed boring, so the roommate and I decided to get delivery via Postmates. (They were doing a special for taco day, so the delivery fee was only $1.99.) I placed the order at 6:21pm and it arrived at 6:54pm. I live in Outer Richmond.\n\n*Burrito Super ($9.30): Served with your choice of meat, rice, tortillas, beans, salsa - Refried beans, Carnitas, Hot salsa, Flour whole wheat tortilla (+$0.35), Guacamole (+$0.95), Jalapeno (+$0.75)\n*Carnitas Taco ($2.75): Served with cilantro, onions and fresh salsa\n*Fish Taco ($2.95): Served with baja style with cabbage, gaucamole and pancho sauce\n*Shrimp Taco ($2.95): Served with cilantro, onions and fresh salsa\n*Pollo Taco ($2.75): Served with cilantro, onions and fresh salsa\n*Nachos Regular ($6): Served with melted cheese, Refried beans (on side), Hot salsa, Beef (+$1.50), Cheese (+$0.75), Guacamole (+$0.95), Jalapeno (+$0.75)\n*Chicken Enchilada ($8.25)\n\nI got the four tacos and the nachos. The tacos were a good size. I actually couldn't eat all of them since my eyes were hungrier than my stomach. I ate the shrimp and fish taco that day and had the other two for lunch the next. (Though I did take a bite of each that day for taste purposes.) The fish taco was good. Crispy and I love the cabbage and sauce that came with it. Provided a nice fresh crunchy contrast. The shrimp tacos were okay. It had a good amount of shrimp, but I found them to be a little rubbery. The carnitas taco was good even with reheating. Nice, crispy, fried pork pieces. The chicken one was just all right. I found the chicken a little dry.\n\nI really enjoyed the nachos, but I wanted them to be cheesier. I paid for extra cheese, but I not sure if I got it. If so, then the dish doesn't normally come with much cheese. I did enjoy all the toppings though. The beef had a nice smokey grill flavor. The dish itself had a nice heat from the salsa and jalapenos. The roomie ordered the burrito and enchiladas. He seemed to enjoy them. We also got about four bags of chips and sides of pico. (I think they came with the tacos since I ordered four of them?) I didn't really eat the chips, but I liked throwing the pico on the tacos and nachos to give it an added element of freshness.\n\nOverall, I though their tacos were okay. And priced average at less than $3 each. (Not sure if Postmates inflates item prices, but I don't think they do based on past experience.) With Postmates delivery fee special, it was a nice way to celebrate National Taco Day.", "author": "Elena N."}

I'd forgot to get a drink so I said, \"Oh sorry can you also add a bottled water?\" She didn't reply, just got the water and apparently added the price difference to whatever I paid without saying anything.  With indifferent people that chose to work in the service industry, I always make a point of saying many \"Thank yous\" to see if they're just having a bad day or if they're just in the wrong job for their personality.  I offered three or four \"Thanks'\" during this encounter and got nary a \"you're welcome\" or anything close in return. \n Two steak tacos came out shortly thereafter.  Seemed to be a relatively generous amount of ok quality meat  with some chips on the side.  The meat was really, really watery though, and the juices overflowed onto the plate making the tortillas wet and useless at holding their contents.

So here is my review:  \n\nI ordered a seafood burrito to go.  I got home, cut it in half, ate nearly to the bottom of the burrito and I bit down on something hard- really hard.  I thought I had broken my tooth.  Upon further examination I discovered it was a ROCK.  That a pebble was inside my burrito.  It was horrible and disgusting.  \n\nI am not sure this was by accident and that the restaurant/ food is just that dirty and gross that random pieces of pebble end up in the food they serve people?  Or if was the passive aggressive work of the super unfriendly woman at the register who I did not tip on this visit because she was extra annoyed and mean to me since my crime was that I came into the restaurant she works at and I made an order.

Steak and shrimp burrito was pretty good. For the price and portion size it's a good value. The burrito could be even better with some additional flavor thrown in. If La Playa Taqueria were to start including a flavorful hot sauce with each order that would be a great way to bring up the burritos to the next level.\n\nQuesadilla with added shrimp was quite good. We were happy to get both guacamole and sour cream along with it. Tortilla is flavorful, can distinctly pick up the flavor of cheese with it and the shrimp compliments well. The seasonings the chef splashed over shrimp while cooking came through. \n\nThere was a different staff member at the register than I've seen on prior trips who was friendly and efficiently kept the line moving. Some of the comment concerns regarding unfriendly staff may have been addressed and improved on.\n\nI'm deducting a star due to past experiences where staff have locked the front door during posted business hours and started closing early, ignored surprised patrons at the door in the process. Life happens and there may be cases where it's necessary. A sign on the door explaining the situation would go a long way. To some degree I consider La Playa Taqueria undependable and a second-tier option due to finding the place closing during business hours.

I ordered a chicken & shrimp Super Burrito to go, the shrimp was overcooked beyond belief. Also the smallest Super Burrito I've ever see, as soon as I bit off the end and looked at it almost a quarter of it was tortilla and forgot my refried beans that I asked. Was I suppost to pay nearly $8.00 for an wrong, overcooked burrito,  I don't think so.  Keep in mind I ordered the same thing last week to go and it was perfect by the time I got here, that's the only reason I came back! I only live four blocks away.\n\nWe went back and showed the women who takes the orders that the burrito was all kinds of bad and told her we wanted our money back. She said no, please let me have it corrected. She took it over to the cook, yelled at him, then stood there and made sure he made it the right. She was awesome!\n\n\nThe quality control at this place is absurd!!! It must be the lack of a latin community in the neighborhood that let's these Mexican restaurants get away with selling such bad interpretations of Mexican food.....", "author": "Nick V."}

The food is always hot, and while the spanish rice can be less then al dente, the delightful refired beans more then make up for it. \n\nLove garlic? Go for the amply sized three pepper (or if you add Jalapenos, four pepper) burrito, which perfectly melds poblano, green and red peppers, along with some saut\u00e9ed long cut onions and half an avocado. With their superb Carne Asada, it may be one of the most remarkably tasty burritos in The City. \n\nCredit Cards accepted, fresh chips (you can often see them frying in back) available, seating is minimal, and service is usually with what passes for a smile in the Outside Lands.", "author": "Casey U."}

Don't f*ck around with the stuff on the menu thats wack (breakfast burrito and other random American-Mex food, although this place technically makes American-Mex, but moving on). Matter of fact, to all the uppity yups on here that are all \"they don't make a breakfast burrito like I'm used to at the pretentious little organic deli\", I have two remarks: one, what is the appeal of a breakfast burrito? The very idea is disgusting! Scrambled eggs in a burrito?!?! What are you thinking? And where do you think that came from? Some hellish kitchen in a bizarre state like Arizona or Florida no doubt. Anyway. \n\nSecond: to those who note that \"the girl at the counter was rude\", you think the world revolves around you? Grow up and get a life. Better yet, move away from San Francisco! You're perfect for somewhere. Why don't you live above a shopping mall? PF Changs and Chipotle will be right next door. \n\nOk, back to La Playa and the delicious three pepper burrito. They do it right, stuffed full with everything that's supposed to go in a burrito, the burritos are huge, and you can get several tasty salsas (just ask!). They are also reasonably priced. The girl at the counter can definitely be a little short but don't walk away until you get your salsa and your pico. Just be patient, it will be worth it.  \n\nFour stars because the fish taco was nothing to write home about. In fact, it was kind of bad. But it had a tasty sauce in it, the fish was just cooked in a weird not good way. Know this and don't be tempted. Yes, fish tacos are delicious, but this is not the place.  \n\nFinal comment: the burrito really is fantastic! I've eaten California-Mex style burritos from Los Angeles to the Central Valley to San Francisco and La Playa gets high marks.", "author": "Michael M."}

However, recently over the last year or so we have had trouble placing our take out orders.  Several times nobody answered their phone and we often called back with still no answer.  We had no idea if they closed the shop or just didn't bother picking up the phone.  We then ate elsewhere or just cooked at home.  I understand that an order can be placed online but I refuse to take the time to go online to place an order not knowing when it will be ready.  They should at least pick up the phone and say \"Can you wait..I will get right back\"..but no, just nothing.  Also the ladies at the counter have never been friendly.  If they want to stay in business they should try to care about their customers that support them.  The food has usually been satisfactory but we do not plan to patronize this restaurant any more.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-01-26", "description": "Three out of five?  How?!\n\nI really, really, really wanted to like this place.  As anyone who is familiar with the Sunset knows there aren't any taquerias in the area.  So I had high hopes that La Playa Taqueria would be the place to get half decent tacos without having to drive out to the Mission.  I was sorely disappointed by my trip here.\n\nLet me start by saying that at over two dollars for a taco (just under five for two), is a bit on the pricier side in terms of tacos.  The meat choices are very limited: carne asada, carnitas, and chicken.  Even Chipotle offers more variation!  But with so few meat choices, each one must be fine tuned, right?  At a glance, I already had a sinking feeling in my stomach that this was going to be less than delicious.\n\nI should have just followed my instincts and left.  However, my stomach ended up ordering three carne asada and three carnitas (to split with my SO).  The total, with a Jarritos came out to $17.94.  We were not given chips or salsa to start (these came to our table later) and they didn't even offer to open our drink!  Our food was ready in less than 10 minutes which was great but it was not served with lime (as EVERY taqueria does).  Fine, get up and ask.\n\nI take a look at my plate and these tacos are just overstuffed.  The cilantro and onions were roughly chopped and just thrown atop the taco in a mess.  The salsa was splattered on top in chunks.  Note that this isn't a hot sauce but a mild, bland veggie puree.  Since they used a medium sized tortilla and they are served side-by-side, each taco became soggy due to the steam coming off of the one next to it.  These tacos had no structure and turned into a floppy mess.\n\nI start off with the carne asada taco.  It was difficult to eat due to the soggy, messy factors but on top of that the meat wasn't good.  It felt like shredded meat, whereas carne asada is supposed to be small chunks of meat.  The favor was unlike any other carne asada I have ever had.  It amazed me that they somehow managed to achieve the flavor of peppered beef jerky!\n\nThe carnitas was closer to flavor to any other carnitas taco I've ever had.  However, it was super fatty.  It was the fattiest pork I've ever had in tacos.  Some of the meat was crispy while others just fell apart in your mouth.  Inconsistent at best.\n\nNot even worth the convenience factor.  I would much rather drive down to SSF or into the Mission for tacos.  Probably spend less on gas than I will here for subpar food.", "author": "Sandy C."}

I saw that the fish tacos were good so I gave one a try.  I ordered a baja fish taco for a little snacky.  The size of the taco was decent as they put a lot of stuffing into it.  The batter of the fish was crispy, but extremely greasy and I crunched on two fish bones, which totally ruined my fish taco experience from here.

I've never complained about having too much of something, but once I open the container, all I can think about is.. where the hell are all of the chips!?

I usually end up walking back home and having to scoop up toppings with tortilla chips that I already have at home and tossing away all the soggy ones at the bottom of the container.\nYou get a small bag of chips with salsa with every order (unless you order nachos).\nThey're cash only and have an ATM inside.", "author": "Cheryl Q."}

The only other burrito joint in the area that delivers is yucky, and I would rather go and fetch food from La Playa than have that other place bring the food to me.  The other suggestion is that they extend the breakfast end time from noon until 1.  I often arrive from my morning jobs right before noon, and based on lines I have seen queuing up about then, other folks are also rushing to get breakfast at the last minute before it ends.  And they are absolutely adamant about that 12 noon stop time.

The Chipotle sauce used on the shrimp burritos is crave-worthy. You can order a side of it to put on anything they make, and that's a good thing. The only downside is a little inconsistency in the quality of burritos depending on who is working. A great burrito is all about the right proportions of ingredients well distributed and mingled.

It was just a couple blocks from my place (always lots of parking available!), and would be a perfect treat when I was too tired to cook or it was a long day. I would tend to default to the fajita burrito -- loved the bell peppers and onions. Make sure to ask for salsa/hot sauce, if you like a little extra spice! They are very quick (if you call in an order, you can pick it up within 10 minutes, usually) and tend to be consistent. The staff was always friendly enough to me. I would say that sometimes the food is a tad salty -- I think it's the chicken that gets over-seasoned. Otherwise, though, it's really good -- not enough to make a special trip out to the Outer Sunset, but if you're in the area looking for a satisfying meal, it's a great place.

If you dont know there are not a lot of options for food in the Sunset in general, and it gets meager on a Sun night.  All I wanted was 2 steak and shrimp burritos.  One for me and one for my friend and some chips for Escobar.  It was about 3 min til 8 on Sun.  The sign in the window clearly stated that they were open til 8 on Sun.  There were about 3 people inside waiting for their food, but the other sign in the window said 'Closed.'  Now I have been there about 20 times in the last couple months.  So that little dude has seen my face plenty.  I am sure he bought an ipod or 2 with the amount of dinero I have given him.  Anyways, I poke my head in the door and politely ask if he could wrap a couple burritos up for me and my boy.  The little prick said they were closed and turned his back on me.  That pissed me off proper like.   I had pizza instead, which I absolutely was not in the mood for.   \nSo I boycotted them and eat less burritos.  Visited some other places some good some not so good.   \nYesterday my hunger strike ended.  I had a steak and shrimp burrito with chipotle sauce (he is charging an extra $.50 for that).  The truth of the matter is, it was delicious and filled me up.  The flavor that the sauce gives warrants the extra sratch.  Also my amigo behind the counter seemed happy to see me.

I try, whenever possible, to support the businesses in my immediate neighborhood.  I've eaten La Playa's food on several occasions (usually purchased to go)...and I'll have to say that a few of those times the food was extremely delicious.  I've ordered and enjoyed the nachos, the chiles rellenos, the veggie burritos, the steak and the chicken burritos and the shrimp chipotle burrito - they all tasted good - well, except that the meat inside the steak burrito was horribly salty - other than that ok.  But, there are several MAJOR MAJOR drawbacks to La Playa Taqueria.  First of all, it is not uncommon to get an order to go, get back home and find out that you did NOT get what you ordered.  And, well,  here's the BIGGEST PROBLEM - I've gotten sick after going there - on 3 separate occasions now - once after eating a \"vegetarian burrito\" - which makes me wonder...hmmm...how can they screw up veggies that bad??  And, their BEST TASTING burrito, the shrimp chipotle burrito, which is absolutely delicious- has given me major stomach problems on 2 separate occasions - once, about 6 months ago I got the runs after eating one - and about 6 weeks ago I ordered one, came home, ate it around 8:30 pm and felt sick to my stomach about 30 minutes later.  I went to bed at 11 pm, and woke up at 1:00 in the morning and threw up over and over for hours on end...so, I'm thinking food poisoning...I'm thinking  that I can't trust this place...ever again...even though I WANT to love it - I can't go back there again.  I have noticed that one of the male employees is very dirty-looking and his hands are dirty too - maybe that's why I got sick.  I also wonder if maybe their seafood and meat is not being kept at the correct temperature.

Nothing hits the spot after a surf session like a super chicken burrito from La Playa Taqueria.  The chicken is always cooked to perfection unlike most burrito shops that over cook everything.  The staff is always friendly, polite, and attentive.  If you are in the Sunset this is a go to spot for a quick cheap meal.", "author": "David C."}

I always get the super carne asada burrito w/ pinto beans and am usually very satisfied with it.  There was one time that I took it to go and and my burrito was upset and no longer hot after sitting upright and in the open on my walk back home.  The service is fairly quick and the price is actually decent.  I noticed someone said it was fairly greasy - don't eat mexican food then!  I also read a note saying they microwave their chips... they actually fry them and store them under a heat lamp.  I agree that the salsa isn't up to par.  I think it has to do with them pre packing it into those little dixies and leaving them out for such a long time.  An alternate place with essentially the same food is \"beach burrito\" (almost the same name!) on Judah and 44th but they're a bit more expensive.  I enjoy this place and will continue to go my typical once a week.", "author": "Sokokyu K."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-10-15", "description": "Not too many options for Mexican food in the outer Sunset.  Burritos are average, but the quesadillas are pretty good.  Only 2 stars, cuz the service sucks, despite what other reviews say.  If I phone in the order, there's usually little or no wait.  But if I drop in, it takes forever.  And of the 7 or so times I've been there, I've dealt with rude cashiers with an attitude at least 5 times.  And they've gotten my order wrong at least 3 times.  But sometimes my wife and I crave Mexican food, and there's really not a whole lot of choices out here.", "author": "R N."}

But this is damn good. We usually eat here once a month, and i always get the steak and shrimp. It's damn good.", "author": "John H."}

Recently I notice the tastes of their burrito is going down the hill, price is going up the hill. Today I made a mistake to buy the burrito again. I did not see any chunks of chicken at all, mysterious canned tuna like meat, tasted awful. Looked like food scrap was wrapped. Only a few bites, I couldn't finish it, scared to have food poisoning.  I will not try their food again. BAD, BAD, shame on you La Playa !", "author": "Hanako S."}

Not sure what the deal is, but they're going to lose my business going forward.", "author": "dontdoit d."}
