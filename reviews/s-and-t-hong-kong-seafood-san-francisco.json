Very small \n- pan fried turnip cake: this was fine \n- shrimp stuffed eggplant: no sauce to help the flavor along. Tasted only like oil. Eggplant was slightly undercooked.\n- deep fried shrimp ball: smaller than standard but was well fried. Couldn't really taste the flavor of the shrimp paste and was pretty bland because of that.

Late August, typical grey sky (Indian Summer had not yet arrived), a fresh chill in the air.  After circling the block several times, we got lucky and managed to wedge our car into a parking spot with a tinge of \"pink\" on one end.  And all for a late Saturday night nibble in a slightly seedy, little Cantonese restaurant in the outer Sunset that our Taiwanese AirBnb host had recommended.  \n\nWe had a brief pause to scrutinize the menu while sitting in the only two seats in a waiting area that accommodates 4.5 people, before they escorted us to our table.  They were busy, loud, and I was one of only two non-Asians in the lot.  That was a good sign.\n\nAnother \"ahhh\".  This was my reaction as I slowly sipped my intensely fragrant jasmine tea.  I started dusting off cobwebbed memories of \"SF past\" , the smells, the tastes, the feelings that had been lovingly stored away, ready and waiting to emerge when I finally returned to The City.  I'd been gone way too long and I had only 4 days to make up for lost time.\n\nWar won ton soup on a crisp night was a given.  The delicate broth with delicious meat filled dumplings, sharing the bowl with shrimp, scallops, squid, bbq pork, chicken, and bok choy was so satisfying.  We were good. We slurped in peace.\n\nWe added a pork and oyster pot dish that also featured tofu, shitaki mushrooms, whole garlic, and ginger.  Lets not forget the one bowl of white rice we shared, as we unsuccessfully tried to avoid white starch.   Just can't do that in a real Chinese restaurant.  \n\nMy frugal nature always dictates that leftovers not be left behind.  And while we had plenty, that's ok, we had a little refrigerator in our Airbnb room.  \n\nDammit, do these leftovers mean I now have one less opportunity to knock off a bookmark in SF?

We had reserved a table and it was ready when we arrived on-time at 5:30pm on a Saturday night. I found it somewhat annoying that the server tried to dictate where the children should sit before they arrived. It was quite obvious that he was trying to maintain a traffic lane in a restaurant that they had overbooked with large tables. While this is not uncommon in Chinese restaurants, especially around Lunar New Year, the Fire Inspector might find issue with this. \n\nThe woman manager/owner? had a very bad habit of yelling across the restaurant at her staff as well as customers. Perhaps she has hearing issues? Either way, this is inappropriate and quite annoying in a crowded restaurant. \n\nThe worse is the condition of the Men's Room.

Dim sum is pretty hard to differentiate, it's all steamed or fried at the end of the day so the difference with each restaurant is basically quality of ingredients and execution. While other places I've tried in SF are overpriced, S&T is more fairly priced while still offering the same variety of dim sum options and slightly higher quality than what I've tasted around the city.\n\nHere, you order from a piece of paper, and waiters check on the list and bring items to your table. I think they also have carts around but I also like this paper method to see exactly what the restaurant has and so that you can easily order your favorite items. I tried the Chinese broccoli, xiao long bao, har cheung/shrimp noodles, ribs, shu mai. taro pastry, egg tarts, and all were tasty.\n\nIt does get really busy on the weekends, so come before 10:30 if you don't want to wait.

Growing up Chinese and needing to be careful with money we were in places like this all the time.  If you are repulsed by spotty service, sketchy bathrooms, Dragon Lady owners, and all Chinese clientele, then don't bother.  To me, that's all part of the je nais sais quoi.  Those are all the things you ignore because you want a place that spends its energy on making excellent food.  \n\nHere's an example:  the roast duck.  A duck is not like a giant Costco chicken where you can pull off giant hunks of boneless meat.  A duck has a lot of bones in it.  You can pay $20 for the Peking Duck and avoid acknowledging that, but when you get the $6 dim sum plate, you're getting about seven pieces of duck and three of them are more bone than not.  But I put those pieces in my mouth and I remember... notice that this crispy skin is righteous!  Notice that the amount of salt is just perfect.  Note that the fat is cooked enough that you just want to suck on it.  Dealing with the bones makes you have your moment of Zen... you can't just shove it down and fail to appreciate these nuances.  Then you go back to the meaty pieces and really enjoy it. \n\nOr let's try the Chinese broccoli.  Sure it's a huge plate because vegetables are relatively cheap.  But it's cooked perfectly... all the bitterness is gone, but the crunch is just right, and the oyster sauce complements the actual taste of the vegetable perfectly.   They are artists back in that kitchen.  \n\nDumplings are good, but actual bite sized.  I admit I've gotten used to places where they make the huge ones, but dumplings are meant to be a one-bite experience.  Have it that way. \n\nI actually can't wait to come back.

Yeah yeah yeah, it's gunna be a long wait time, it's a holiday, it's going to be busy.. whatever.  We still went out as a family of 5 to eat lunch.  \n\nThis isn't the usual place we go to get dim sum but we decided to try someplace new.  So we get a number, wait a little long to get seated but we were OK, we get seated, take our order on the paper (where you mark the quantity of dishes you want), then waited. And waited..... about 20 min pass and we ask 2 waiters to check on our order.  Nothing happens... Literally, the waiters didn't even come back to our table to inform us of what happened when they \"checked\" on our order.  Wait another 10 minutes and my mom physically gets up to go to the front desk area and ask the lady owner (definitely the owner bcus we saw 4 framed photos on the wall with lady owner IN the photos).  Once my mom asks, lady owner is INSTANTLY annoyed and starts barking in Cantonese (and I can understand everything) to all her employees and realize that our order was never even put into the ordering system. \n\nMy fam and I were patiently waiting, seriously, so patient that we had the time to check out the interior of the restaurant to look at the owner's framed photos on the walls..\n\nSo finally she says, \"1 minute, your food will come out\" and she starts off with dessert.  The almond jell-o dessert thing we ordered.  Which was fine.. but really... as our first dish... Alright lady.  We ate it anyways of course to pass the time..\n\nThen it gets worse, we wait again for a more.... hot dish... then a waitress takes out noodles (like an egg noodle chow mein dish), then sets it onto the table... my brother uses his chop stick to instantly dive into the noodle dish to put some on his plate.  Then ALL OF A SUDDEN the waitress says \"Opps wrong table\" and takes the dish back while my bro is MID-GRABBIN in the noodle dish already.  Literally noodles fall off of the dish and onto the table and the waitress picks it up with her hands and says \"It's ok, it's ok\" and puts it back onto the dish and walks back into the kitchen direction.  I was literally so disgusted.  I already know FOR SURE she was going to bring that dish back into the kitchen and serve it out again onto the correct table.  Fucking gross.\n\nSo my family and I are almost traumatized (maybe a little exaggerated term, but you get what I mean) at this point after everything that has already happened and then when another server was taking out some steamed dim sum to another table, the lady owner grabs the dishes from the tray while the waitress is holding it, checks all of the steam containers and whichever one we ordered she just threw them onto our table and says (in Cantonese) \"just serve this table first, they're whining and complaining.\" EXCUSE ME LADY OWNER????!?!??!? Omg at this point I really wanted to say something but tbh she prob wouldn't have understood me anyways with my broken ass Chinglish accent. \n\nAll the waiters and waitresses literally all seemed so stressed and tired out...  Probably cus it was busy but probably more because they have a barking boss lady that makes them all stressed out! Trust me, I was a waitress before, bosses need to chill and be coo if they want to run a good-serviced restaurant.\n\nBut anyways, woah lady owner you need to fucking chill.  Your food is coo but your attitude makes your restaurant disgusting.  How dare you go around to your CUSTOMERS and tell us that we're whining and complaining RIGHT in front of our faces, when you literally are the one whining and complaining to all your startled employees..

This ensures that you get what you want and do not have to wait around for the carts to come to you. I have had experiences where the carts never came to my table and I never got the items that I was looking for, but at S&T, you don't have to worry about that! \n\nThe food is always fresh and delicious!

Therefore we can conclude a few things.\n\n- Yelpers generally care more about dim sum out of a wide array of representative Cantonese cuisine delights.\n\n- Some might freeze panic like a deer in headlights if they had to take over the reins of ordering at the dinner table (when no dim sum is around), and thus stay in shallow waters to avoid drowning in the deeper unknown even with a GPS and scuba gear.\n\n- S&T would be considered astronomical pricing in Chinatown or parts of Irving (which is why Ming Kee couldn't survive...old school locals preferred crappy quality and cheap pricing over paying a dollar or two more for top quality). Some probably would rather eat gourmet roach coaches, Go to MY China or Hakkasan, than spend a similar amount on a non glitzy decent Cantonese dinner. \n\nListen to Susy C. Dinner here is quite da Sh&T indeed. Try to show up after 6 pm without a reservation. Maybe you'll get as far as the waiting area by the stand where you see some Hello Kitty stuffed animals and mini plush dolls. No doubt this was the handiwork of the lady boss. If you are a real a$$ FOB you will notice various framed pictures of the lady boss with various celebrities from Hong Kong who have dined at the restaurant, hung across the upper walls around the main dining room. Definitely InstaBook worthy ego boosting material. Maybe some of you out there might know who Law Kar Ying and \"Fat Mama\" Maria Cordero are. Oh Ed Lee ate here too.  \n\nVery interesting that a restaurant of this stature and quality tried to open a branch in San Mateo downtown (HK Causeway Bay) and it flopped so bad, yet this place is still thriving and doing very well. Or maybe the feng shui in SM at that spot has been cursed for years.\n\nOK too much BS...let's get to the food.\n\nCheck the live seafood tanks to give yourself an idea of what they have. Then peruse the regular menu, but I find the more effective technique is to chat with the waiter, examine what others are eating, and also scan the specials menu. There is quite a lot of variety here that can slow you down.\n\nBBQ pork (cha siu) - arguably one of the most recognizeable of Cantonese roasties, and popular amongst expats. The rendition here is quite splendid and has all the right things going for it, such as a very natural color (no food coloring), thus more brown than red. The cut of meat resembles pork shoulder (mui tau) and has decent marbling, tender but with a good bite. The slices rest on a bed of yellow soybeans, which is a good traditional pairing. The \"nam yu\" sauce of the marination seemed a tad heavy, but a great effort indeed. Worthy of recommendation.\n\nPacific surf clam (gwai fei pong) - steamed with garlic, bean thread noodles, with soy sauce and some oil. Outperformed Brother Seafood easy, best one I'd had so far. The adductor muscle/scallop from the clam is good chit. A bit too much oil, but it was at the bottom of the plate. If they do this right, seafood should be good here too (but beware, $30/lb for a coral/sesame grouper...not cheap). Easy to see why locals just stick with salt pepper crab (even they stick with shallow waters during dinner...)\n\nslow fire soup of the day - a small pot is enough for 4 to 5 people. Saturday night's offering was stewed with papaya (for sweetness), chicken feet (none could be seen in the soup), peanuts, pork/pork bone, and snow ear funghi. The materials are cheap but the effect is solid. Soothing on a cold evening. \n\nyam leaf with garlic in superior broth - always good to ask the waiter what Chinese greens are available. Stir fry with garlic is way too boring these days, and too much oil and heat can cause issues....so cooking in superior broth is the way to go. Still a bit bland? Tell them to add garlic, which is stir fried first (browned) then throw in with the veggies. Tender, moist, juicy, yet a very light crisp on the stems. \n\nsoy sauce chicken - hint: this might be available only 6 pm or after, so ask before ordering if it is available if you arrive before 6. Ming Kee still makes the most stellar soy sauce chicken around, but until they reopen, S&T's version is still quite noteworthy indeed.\n\nComp house dessert - red bean soup. Slightly diluted in texture, but it turns out it was because of the ginger juice added which gave the flavor profile an extra dimension. Decent dried orange peel flavor. Great way to end the meal.\n\nGood stuff. I'll be back. An easy 4.25 stars for me.\n\nFortunately the lady boss doesn't need the celeb photo shots taken inside the restaurant, to prove that S&T is indeed da Sh&T.", "author": "Ken K."}

I'm not sure if I was there to taste Dim Sum or Kikkoman's soy sauce.\n\nBut this is a very well decorated place. The owner is also pretty boss because he/she got a lot of pictures with celebrities.

If you don't speak or read Chinese, you can still eat here because they have English on their menu. The service is very good and the food comes out quickly. \n\nOne of the items I was super excited about was the \"low sa bao\" (spilling sand bun) but when I opened the bun, there wasn't much yolk spilling out. It still tasted good. The Portugese egg tart wasn't as good as the ones I've eaten in Macau. It was basically an egg tart that got burned. I really liked their \"ha gau.\" They give 4 pieces and there was a lot of shrimp inside.\n\nHanging on the wall in the restaurant, they have photos of the owner with Hong Kong celebrities. I'm not sure when those photos were taken but they look pretty recent (photos haven't faded yet). Iif you're a fan of HK dramas, you might want to come check this place out.

So tasty and fresh. \nSteamed cod fish - the meat is so fluffy compared to frozen fish that is solid. It's \"hung Lung cod\". The bad thing is that they didn't tell me this is $23.5 per pound. So ended up to be $48 for the fish. But so good and fresh. \nHour-cooked soup - not greasy at all. Tonight is pork chop with Chinese squash.

When I bring someone here, that person always asks this first.  Who is this short haired Asian lady pictured with a bunch of random folk framed across the walls of the whole restaurant?  To most people, one of the only recognizable faces is San Francisco's current mayor, Ed Lee.  The others are an assortment of Chinese film and television stars (and some singers).  The short haired lady is either the owner or manager.  \n\nOn the weekends, this place is a mad house during the dim sum hours.  When the table is finally ready, don't expect to pick from dim sum carts because there are none.  They have their list of dim sum to choose from and you'll tag the ones wanted with the numerical quantity desired.  Below I made a mini set of items for first time goers of S&T:\n \nGET IT!\n*Pan fried taro cake - My favorite dim sum item here.  They make it different than a lot of places.  The taro cake is actually made up of shaved up shards of taro and then pan fried.  Can you say \"yummy taro in my belly?\" \n\nTRY IT!\n*Scallop dumplings - Here they're formed in a shape similar to a large tortellini.  The wrapping of the dumpling is a little thick, but the mixture of scallops and yellow chives make up for it.  Wish there was more scallop though.    \n\n*Steamed Chicken Feet - I don't always order this due to the oily nature.  What am I kidding myself?  Most dim sum is fatty in some way or another anyway.  They cut them into smaller pieces.  Two benefits come from this:  the juice gets sucked into the feet more and also they are easier to eat.    \n\nAVOID!\n*Green onion pancake - I couldn't hold back my yearning for a green onion pancake the last time.  I understand this is not supposed to be their forte, but come on.  Order at your own risk.  Mistake was made and I'm passing the message along.  \n\n*\"Special Order\" chow mein - Periodically, the dim sum servers will come around with \"specials\" that come with a \"special\" price.  One of them is the chow mein and you can order it by the bucket at a dim sum-to-go place that'll taste comparable.  \n\nCompared to some other dim sum offerings in the local vicinity, they definitely do a better job than their immediate peers.  When compared to a larger spectrum, S&T is a passable dim sum spot.  The restaurant also has a to-go dim sum area for a bite on the run.  Personally I wouldn't mind driving further for some better dim sum.  In a pinch, I wouldn't ever complain about coming back here.  Reasonably priced with an equivalent quality one would expect.", "author": "Arnold T."}

Surprisingly there was no wait for a table of six. There's no dim sum carts at S&T; they have a paper menu which you just mark off which dim sum plates you want.

I can speak Chinese and communicate fluently with the waiters here so I know it is not a language barrier. So if you don't speak Chinese, forget about it. You will never get anything you ask for. We asked for ice waters, no ice waters. We asked for soy sauce and chili sauce, after the 5th-6th time, we finally got it and half our dim sum was finished. Here's a tip, if you don't want your customers asking you for condiments, then put them on the table. It's really simple and many restaurants adopt that practice. It's not rocket science. The part that makes this to be an unbelievable experience is when I just wanted to double check that our order went in because when I placed it, the waiter was all excited to see this kid walk in the restaurant so I thought he may have forgotten it. In my most polite Chinese voice, I just simply asked if the order was in and he said if you can't wait then box up your stuff and you can go. Omg! Needless to say, I got the tab, cancel those items, and that cocky waiter can get his big fat $0 tip for his poor attitude! We wanted to tell the manager/owner about our experience and she said she wasn't the person to talk to and we were like okay then why is your picture framed all over the restaurant with celebrities?

He joked with us while getting us the check, and then after we stupidly left the restaurant without our $20 worth of boxed food, ran out into the street to find us. We had already gone by then, but luckily remembered and turned back. He had saved the food and joked that he had a heart attack trying to find us. So nice!", "author": "Cynthia S."}

So, by showing up at 6pm, we avoided the rush, and people started lining up at around 6:30pm. \n\nFor a family of four, we ordered the $88/ 4 entree special. It included fake shark fin soup, fried pigeon, stir-fry veggies and beef, and a steamed fish. I always detest ordering the combo specials because they tend to come with some not-as-appetizing dishes. In this case, I could have gone without the fake shark fin soup and the stir-fry veggies and beef. They were simple and ordinary. At least the pigeon dish lived up to its name as being a Shek-Ki delicacy, and the steam fish was flavorful and light. \n\nAlso, we added a $25 lobster noodle as my mother raved about it. She said, from her previous visit, the lobster noodles included a big and succulent lobster and her foreign visitor ate it like a barbarian. But this time, my mother was wrong as the lobster was small. Despite it size, this dish was still good. My favorite part was substituting the ee mein with thin egg noodles. The thin egg noodles soaked in lobster juice and became my favorite part of the meal. \n\nI would def come back to this restaurant, either for dim sum or dinner.

She told me to \"skip Chinatown because it is overpriced and low quality\" and head out to Sunset. I followed here advice a few years ago and was very pleasantly surprised. Came back with the wifey last week and was again impressed. We ordered a lot so strap on your seat belts. \n\nWe ordered the Har Gow (about $3 I think), Spinach and shrimp dumpling (about $3), BBQ Pork Bun (about $3), Roast Duck ($5), Fried Calamari ($5), Fried Chicken Wings ($5), and the Singapore Noodles ($11). You are probably asking yourself, \"Was all of that really necessary?\" Well the waiter was asking the same thing. We didn't finish it, but I am sure that it made for some really tasty left-overs for this one homeless man back in the Mission. \n\nAnyhow, The Har Gow were amazing. Perfectly flavored and so delish. The spinach and shrimp dumplings were really good too, but not quite as good as the Har Gow. The BBQ pork buns were the best I have ever had. It was not that cheesy looking died-red meat, but was very tender and flavorful, nice sized chunks of pork. There was a great meat-bun ratio and the bun was really good. The wifey loved it, which says a lot because she does not care for these typically. in fact, i have never seen her eat one before. \n\nThe roast duck was probably the best, if not definitely in the top three, that I have ever had (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TR5FbzexqkO0jJ7Sc3MsMA?select=WdpmXuCeUTBLG-qaHsI6uA). i had some good duck in Singapore and in Malaysia chinatowns, but this was cooked with care. The skin was very crispy, the meat was perfectly seasoned, and it was cooked perfectly. A+! The chicken wings were one of the few things that we though we could have lived without. They weren't bad by any means, but they just weren't amazing. They were basic salt and pepper fried chicken wings. The calamari was quite exceptional though. Perfectly seasoned and battered and cooked to a perfect tenderness. No chewiness, which is amazing. I questioned whether or not it was really calamari. \n\nThe Singapore noodles (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/TR5FbzexqkO0jJ7Sc3MsMA?select=_Kz5XRhmIkJBcj23vVEUiQ)were very aptly named. Very thin rice noodles pan fried with curry powder, char siu pork, shrimp, and egg. They were so flavorful and delicious and really showed a nice mix of Indian/Indonesian, Chinese, and native Malay seasoning. It brought me back to the place for sure. \n\nThe chili sauce that they served was phenomenal. Hands down, the best Asian Chili sauce i have ever tasted. It was so deep, layered and flavorful, I could have just eaten that with some wonton chips and been happy. The mustard was really good too, cleared the sinuses right out. \n\nI do not know the Chinese names for the things that we ordered, but I bet you everyone else in the restaurant did. We were the only non-Asians and, it seemed, the only folks that did not speak Chinese. Experiences like that are some of my favorite aspects of America. I hope places like this continue to thrive and welcome foreigners. All of the staff were extremely friendly, welcoming, and helpful. The service was quick, but they also were not too busy. Definitely make the trip out to check it out. It is so worth it!", "author": "Miguel V."}

Located on Noriega and 30th near a slew of competition, this place is by far the best.  The service is fast, top quality, friendly, sincere, and memorable.  Simon, the waiter who took care of us talk about interesting culinary details of the dish.\n\nFor $80, you can purchase a five course dinner for 4.  With that order was an amazing shark fin soup, a vegetable and beef order that was excellent, a whole steamed fish seasone with green onions and ginger that was hearty, a vegetable dish, and there was one other dish that was quite good.  The atmosphere is classic Hong Kong style and reminiscent of many restaurants I frequented when I visited Hong Kong many years ago.  Classic bright lights, fast pace, yet very professional service.\n\nThe wine was superb and my friends and I had an excellent time.  One interesting detail was a newspaper review from the Chronicle which indicated that S&T was the best Chinese Restaurant in San Francisco.  The restaurant critics from the SF Chronicle are known to be very picky.    If you have been here in the past and have not enjoyed the experience, the management has changed many times, but, over the past 10 years, it's been under the same ownership.  I met the owner, a woman who was very sincere and had the energy of a person who abides by high standards.\n\nThe waiter who took care of our table, a very friendly man, was a sincere host who gave us an excellent complimentary green bean soup for dessert at the end.  \n\nThe wine, the food, the service, and overall \"time\" was an enjoyable experience.  I cannot wait to come here again.  Even on a slow weekday late at night, the place was crowded and filled with life.", "author": "Tony U."}

Anywho... \n\nWoke up WAY too early but I was bribed by family to get out of bed for dim sum. Glad I did!  We were seated promptly at 9am by some man in a gray vest. Reminds me of all dim sum restaurants and their outfits. They always wear vests which I find kind of cute. Dressing up for breakfast! Place filled up fast so don't drag your feet if you want a seat here.\n\nIt's more expensive than the average dim sum restaurant but they sure give you your moneys worth.  It's the subtle things that make a restaurant earn extra brownie points. I knew it was going to be a good meal when I noticed they added cilantro in the bbq pork rice roll, which is just a little something more than usual.\n\nAlso loved the bean curd roll.  It was filled with pork and shreds of vegetables that combined all the flavors so nicely. The Chicken and Rice in Lotus Leaf has always been a favorite of mine.  Lovin' the egg yolk and Chinese sausage they added in.  It's like a little surprise when you dig through the rice :) I don't normally order egg rolls but they make them extra crunchy and when you dip it in the spicy red sauce your mouth just waters! Their beef chow fun wasn't greasy at all and I happily finished my meal off with a Egg Custard Tart.  Skip the Shanghai Dumplings here though.. save that order for Shanghai Dumpling King in the Richmond district.\n\nOh. And something unfortunate happened during our meal.\n\nMy mother: *facing the window* Omg. They're going to take the trash in through the front..\nMe: ewwwww\nMother: Really.\nMe: Eeeewww! *Turns around*\n\nIsn't it a health code violation to drag the trash can THROUGH the restaurant?! I wasn't thrilled to see some smelly can dragging next to all the food and people. Even so, food was great and I'll forgive them if they never drag another trash can through the restaurant while I'm there again.........Ignorance is bliss.", "author": "Samantha L."}

One of my favs.\n\nPork Siu Mai: You can get it with or without the shrimp but so many other dishes have shrimp, it's better to get it just regular.

They do not skimp on any of the ingredients and it was strictly no frills, solid, good food. \n\nThe crab meat in the soup tasted fresh and sweet; the chicken meat was tender and springy; the spareribs were lightly battered and salted perfectly; the claypot had literally only fish and tofu but it was full of what Chinese people call \"breath of a wok\" meaning it was piping hot; and the stir-fry was interesting but very delicious. \n\nS&T is a little bit more expensive than other restaurants but you get what you pay for.

The dim sum is good for the price you pay, but don't expect anything fine or special. I would give this place a 3 stars rating in comparison to Chinese restaurants of its class (local family eatery). The one star is for the dining experience because the waiting staff was really rude on the day of my visit to the point of being hostile. I went in for a no frills dim sum lunch and was delighted to see that they had Vietnamese style egg rolls on the menu and ordered it with great anticipation because I just happen to have a craving for Vietnamese imperial rolls. What came out was regular Chinese cabbage egg rolls. When I asked a waiter what it was, he admitted that they were Chinese vegetarian egg rolls and they didn't have Vietnamese egg rolls. So I wondered why they would attempt to serve me something I didn't order without first informing me and this led the waiter to talk to his manager before he agreed to take the dish back without charge (luckily I had not eaten any of the egg rolls, because it was obvious they were not Vietnamese style egg rolls and I thought a simple mistake may have been made). As I was leaving after finishing lunch, another waiter stopped me (literally blocked my way out) and told me in my face (really loudly) that no one should expect a Cantonese seafood restaurant to actually serve Vietnamese egg rolls even if it's on the menu, just like no one should expect to find authentic Shanghai dumplings in a Cantonese restaurant. He warned for me to even harbor such an expectation was a serious mistake and I should not do that again. Of course this was total nonsense. The restaurant not only misrepresented itself in writing on the menu but it's the customer's fault for questioning something that wasn't ordered? By that time I just wanted to get out of the place as I was afraid of getting hit. So I apologized for being an idiot and thanked the waiter for his advice and was then let go. Wow! These people need some serious crash course on customer service. And please get the Vietnamese style egg roll off the menu if you don't have it. Oh, BTW, lots of Cantonese restaurants serve great Shanghai dumplings as well as Vietnamese style egg rolls.", "author": "Giovani T."}

It's like any typical Chinese restaurant unorganized but the food was still good. I go to places like this not for the service but for the food. The one down fall is the long wait on the weekends. My parents enjoy their dim sum because it's not too salty, which is a change from a lot of other Chinese restaurants.   \nLike I said the service is not that great, but during my mother's dinner it was a whole new level of horrible service. My mother asked if what we ordered came with rice and the waiter told me my mom very rudely, \"No, of course not what do you think rice is not automatic with the meal\". It was in his tone of voice belittling my mother's question, which made me very upset.  \nThe worse part of it all was, the food wasn't even that good, which is the reason for the mediocre rating. \nThe sizzling seafood rice soup we order lacked any sizzle and it tasted more like instant soup with seafood and snap peas. It took them a long time to serve us, which it's normal due to the weather and being I was there for dinner on a Saturday night; however, I was not pleased with the food; the Peking duck we ordered was way too fatty. \nOverall their dim sum is better than their dinner and the service there is not great.

Hong Kong Seafood Restaurant chooses not to compromise the choice to maintain authentic Hong Kong traditions.  Even when they include sweet and sour pork, it is prepared with higher quality than the syrupy, fatty, pineapple overly dessert sweet versions elsewhere.\n\nHong Kong Seafood restaurant deserves five stars, even if not consistently perfect, if compared with most other restaurants on several levels. We dined there this evening, Feb. 3 as we have previous times before. The restaurant is not fancy but cleaner with warmer lighting than 96% of the others in this city. Most Chinese restaurants are notorious for filthy bathrooms and kitchens.  This restaurant even has a vase of fresh beautiful flowers in the ladies restroom and clean.  The fish tank water is clean, whereas many other restaurant fish tanks are yellowish and murky looking.  Food here is as close to Hong Kong authentic style as can be found in this area.  I recommend trying their sauteed geoduck with bright, firm, flavorful accompaniment of vegetables.  Their House special seafood soup is generous with large tender scallops, perfectly cooked large shrimp, whole baby bok choy, pork filled wonton dumplings and other delicious ingredients in a tasty broth.  Our other dishes were deliciously memorable as well.  Whereas most other restaurants service chicken and call it minced squab with lettuce cups, Hong Kong Seafood Restaurant offers real minced squab with fresh, crisp, perfectly trimmed lettuce cups as an appetizer, but portion is generous enough as a dinner entree.  Every time we dine there, we are never disappointed.\n\nOther Yelp customers complain about unimpressive service, but if customers fail to be courteous and gracious to the wait staff, waiters do not earn enough to suffer boorish customers.

Initially when we walked in, everything seemed ok and noticed that there was a couple of tables that had some peanuts on their table so we asked if we can get some.  This lady, the owner, told us that you have to order it and it's $5 with a really crappy attitude.  Really?  $5 for peanuts, so my first thought was you can shove those peanuts right up your a__!!!  So, as it turns out, this lady had opened a restaurant in San Mateo that went out of business and now I know why!  She made a smart ass comment about people were ust eating up all the peanuts at that restaurant which was one of the reasons she went out of business so if we wanted peanuts, $5!  Can you say, \"Beeeeyaatch!\"\n\nHow can a business owner be so loud and obnoxious????  Throughout the entire dinner, she was just rude to other patrons who had a complaint on their dishes, talking crap loudly.  Now, I grew up in a restaurant environment and just apalled on how this lady can treat her customers.  Damn shame!  She was rude, unprofessional as hell, scowling throughout the night, abrupt and didn't even have the common courtesy to say Thank you and just plopped the check on our table.\n\nIn fact, one of the dishes we ordered didn't come out and since we were almost done with the dinner, we asked the waiter to make sure that we cancel it.  The waiter told her and she responded in a loud tone, \"Oh well, whatever, just give them the check!\"   Wouldn't the professional response be, \"Oh, I'm so sorry, but definitely, I will take it off your check.\"  NOTHING BUT RUDENESS!  \n\nI would never ever, ever, ever come to this place again!

Tried and true favorites are the soup of the day, steamed whole fish, walnut prawns and their fu jian tofu.  We also enjoy the pork and kabocha pumpkin stew.  We never leave hungry.

With reservations a rarity, it requires patience and planning, and those who rely on serendipity may wind up going hungry for a long time.  Of course, once you're familiar with a few good hunting grounds (and parking spots), it's not too hard to land that perfect omelet or pancake.  \n\nBut of all the brunches, none is quite as elusive, or deadly, as Dim Sum; and the dumpling hunter can all too quickly become the prey.  After all, how many people's Sundays have been laid to waste by the lines at Koi Palace?  How many would-be feasts abandoned in despairing fatigue and exchanged in famished desperation for a Starbucks muffin or (God forbid) a McGriddle?  And even those that do score a table must ask: at what cost?  For the receipt oft tallies a dim sum indeed (sorry, I just had to).\n\nThus, S&T Hong Kong Seafood is nothing short of a miraculous find, so much so that I really do hesitate to share it (but I'm a total review count whore, so what can I do?).  Conveniently located (for me, anyway) at 33rd & Noriega, our party of 5 showed up at 11 AM on Sunday and only had to wait 15 minutes.  Luckily one of us spoke Chinese and handled the ordering; we wound up with 16 delectable plates that we were just barely able to finish.  All in all, a perfect Dim Sum feast.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-12-26", "description": "My family ate here on Christmas Day and had awful service. You should AVOID eating here although the food tasted decent and I liked the fish. Here's what went wrong:\n \n1. We preordered a 10-person dinner. When the first people in our party arrived, they were seated in the back room. About 10 minutes later the owner lady came to the table to find out who we were because apparently we weren't supposed to be sitting there. Without any explanation, she told us this was not our table --like it was our fault that we sat there-- then moved us to a table in the main dining room.\n\n2. When our party was complete a few minutes later, we told the waiter we were ready to eat. We had 9 people although we had preordered a 10 person dinner. 20 minutes passes and no food. My mother went to the lady owner to ask why after 20 minutes we aren't getting any food, and the owner lady had the nerve to tell her that we just arrived there when it was her that 25 minutes ago made us all get up and change tables so obviously we didn't all just arrive there. It's amazing that the lady owner can be so rude to her customers.\n\n3. A waiter came to our table, no apology, just removed the extra setting and said he thought we were waiting for someone (just an excuse because we already told the waiter 20 minutes ago we were ready to eat).\n\n4. At that moment another waiter brought an appetizer plate to a table next to us, and those people started eating it -- even though they were already 2 courses into their dinner. We told the waiter it looks like our appetizer is at the next table. The waiter then took that plate off their table and brought it back into the kitchen. A short time later we received our appetizer plate, and hoped it was not the one they had just brought back.\n\n5. When the waiter brought another table next to us their dessert, the people said that they had not yet been served all their courses. The waiters huddled together, I guess to decide whether a dish was missing or not. The conclusion was that they were missing a dish and later the waiters brought them a chicken in a take out box. Then we started tracking the dishes for our dinner.\n \n6. At the 2nd to the last course my mother mentioned to the waiter that we still have a dish besides the fried rice, which is typically the last course before dessert; the waiter said he would look into it. When they brought the fried rice, my mother again told the waiter that we were still missing a course (wow, is that a coincidence?!)  The lady owner then came to our table to see what food we were having and told us that the kitchen claims they cooked the dish. She also said nobody admitted to eating our dish. The lady owner thought maybe we already ate the dish. We told her to look at our table of food that we didn't get that dish. We wanted the dish but lady owner didn't want to give it to us, and said she will refund some money for that dish. We had been there almost 2 hours already, and there was an empty table next to us so they didn't need our table. You would think lady owner would want to serve us the dish and make money on the dish we preordered but she refused.\n \n7. For our trouble, they brought us a complimentary dessert of some mango sticky ball, which was nice until they tried to add it to the bill later.\n\n8. When the bill came they tried to charge us tax and tip on the dish that we never received. They only deducted the amount of the missing dish after tax and tip was included in the original total. While speaking with lady owner that we shouldn't be charged tax and tip on a dish that we never received, she said that she would fix it but she decided to add the \"complimentary\" dessert to the bill so that we can pay tax on it, stating that we need to pay tax to Obama. The amount that she added to the bill for the \"complimentary\" dessert was almost as much as as the cost of the missing dish. Isn't that rude to try to add things to the bill to make us pay tax on something we never ordered? Owner lady rudely states she's spending a lot of time redoing the bill to make me happy.\n \n9. After asking a waiter's opinion of whether she should charge tax and tip on the complimentary dessert and missing dish (don't ask me why she is asking a waiter), owner lady redoes the bill back to the original then manually deducted the missing dish and the tip on the missing dish. She was still not deducting the tax on the dish we never received. I got tired of trying to get her to deduct the tax. \n\n10.We decided we're never coming back to this restaurant!", "author": "B L."}

The side on the left, where you enter. . . and the side to the right, where there is another room.  Normally, I am seated to the right, where two waiters serve you.

They were much friendlier, and did not constantly pester us to order the \"larger\" plates.  Also, they changed our plates three times.  I am unsure to why service immensely improved - because of the different waiters/waitresses, or because that we were a party of thirteen?\n\nNow, onto the food.  Their dim sum is a favorite, secondary to the expensive and packed Koi Palace.  Their siao long baos almost match those of Koi Palace, and this place's shrimps puffs are definitely the best.

My party of 4 went nuts and I believe we ended up ordering around 16 dishes, which is WAY too much, but it's just so easy when you're checking off all the things you want to try on their order form. Service was pretty good for dim sum, and the staff was friendly though pretty harried throughout the restaurant. Even with all that we ordered, the total bill came out to about $15/pp, which is still quite reasonable.", "author": "Phuoc K."}

They forgot one dessert, but it was fine as we were all totally stuffed by then. \n \nPrice: Went with a group of 6, and we ate and ate and ate and ate for $25 a head... \n\nFood: Great XO noodles and noodle rolls, the shitake shu mai didnt seem too different from regular shu mai, the prok buns were right there, the potstickers were huge, not to be confused with the fried pork dumplings which were deep fried balls of dough with porky stuff inside... I had a lobster roll too which was good, but deep fried.  I prefer steamed to fried as it is less filling and I can try more stuff!! The desserts were good- there's a deep fried bread/dough strip that I guess usually comes with sweet milk, but was served plain- could have definitely used some powdered sugar at least.  \n\nProcess: I liked the fact that we ordered from a list, as my friend put it, you're not waiting to see if your favorite thing comes out- takes the apprehension out of it, you just wait and eat and dig the goodness.  \n\nLocation: I live in Oakland so this was kindof a schlep, but I will vow to take my dog to the beach more and pick up some to go stuff from here, fun Sunday outing!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-02-17", "description": "This is the best Dim Sum in San Francisco (and Koi Palace, because everyone compares Dim Sum to THAT place).\n\nFirst, this is good Dim Sum, not 'In and Out.' Expect to wait at least 30 minutes during peak times. Dim Sum is meant to be done over a period of longer than a hour with friends, delicacies and tea.\n\nThe ingredients taste fresher (and probably are due to volume) than other Chinese restaurants. You can taste the subtle differences when the flavors explode in your mouth. It is really hard to quantify good dim sum, but this is it. The tea doesn't come from a bag, the dim sum is cooked fresh and the service is quick. The hot sauce isn't from a jar on your table that has been sitting around for 6 months.\n\nMy favorites here are:\nPan Fried Chive Dumpling: A shrimp and chive cake that has been grilled on both sides like a panini to add in flavor.\n\nShrimp Dumpling: Yeah it just tastes better here. No lies. I mean this is the real litmus test of a restaurant. For those of you not in the dim sum know: This is what it sounds like, shrimp with a bit of oil, starch and salt steamed in dumpling form.\n\nNoodle Rolls: Probably the big stand out. Most dim sum places offer shrimp noodle rolls and beef noodle rolls but this place has a bunch. And it is of note because they really pack a bunch. I recommend the BBQ noodle roll and the chive noodle roll (vegan). Not in the dim sum know? These are rice noodle rolled around a filler and then drenched in soy sauce. The medley is very tasty with the right mix of acidity and sweetness.\n\nI'd add those on with your favorites and enjoy.\n\nAlso their signature is a soy sauce chicken (12$ half/23$ whole). Another thing I cannot explain, but if you go here for dinner be sure to order it. Again it is what it sounds like, soy sauce and chicken! But they must have some secret process to bring out the flavors.", "author": "Joe Z."}

There was not really a very long wait, but it was a very hot day and the place does not have air conditioning.  When we got our table, the first thing I noticed was there were still food stains at the edge fo the table.  The bus person must not have wipe the table before turning it over to the next guests, which was us.  The dishes and bowls also had food stains on them.  I have to rinse them off with hot tea.\n\nThe food there was just OK and the service was so so.  There were flies everywhere, but that is what you expect when you go to a Chinese dim sum restaurant.  There was only one bathroom and inside was so dirty, paper on the floor, and the floor was wet.  There were also little critters living inside the walls which I don't even want to say it, you know what I mean.\n\nI wish the owner would take better care of the place and not be cheap.

Let's begin my sordid tale of mediocre Chinese dim sum. \n\nThe gf and I had some errands to run, and it just so happened that we were in the neighborhood. Instead of the typical run to Mongkok Dim Sum, we came here, figuring that we could sit down and actually eat something, instead of on the go for a change. \n\nWe ordered, har gow, some Chinese garlic spare ribs, shanghai dumplings, donut noodle roll, shrimp noodle roll, egg rolls, deep fried shrimp balls, and chicken feet. Everything was ok, not special. But when I tried the spare ribs, I started to tank. I felt queasy in the stomach, and need to take in some air. The plates weren't really cleaned, and the cups that I drank my tea in had a greasy film to it. Even though it's listed as a 98 in cleaniness, I think the REAL score is more like a 78. There's no way this place gets a 98 in scoring, unless they're kicking back some cash to the inspector. The tables are dirty, dishes are greasy, and the people who bring you food to your table, NEVER wipe or clean the utensils which they use to cut up your food. \n\nService was way below average. There wasn't many people, but apparently it took them over 20 minutes for us to get our check, and they forgot to bring us our deep fried shrimp balls. I wish I had avoided this place, but I can't help but feel that we got screwed over in service, and in the quality of food. The prices are definitely not good, as in I can get better service and quality of food elsewhere in the city, and be content. \n\nIn the end, this place isn't worth it, and I really don't see how people still rave about this place, when it's obvious it's not.", "author": "Clinton L."}

Unfortunately, we were given a old rickety table right next to the kitchen exit and the fish tanks of nasty looking fishes.\n\nBut from sitting next to the kitchen exit, I saw that everything that came out of there looked amazing! Not like the usual chinese restaurants where they just drop it from the wok to the plate, but everything was nicely arranged. \n\nI don't like to drink a lot of chinese soup, but this is great! Then my favorite dish of all - salt and pepper spareribs, cooked to perfection! They're known for their soy sauce chicken, delicious as well. The assorted seafood pot was bubblingly delcious.\n\nBeing an ABC, I don't hold myself to being an expert in which restaurants tastes good in terms of chinese food, but S & T is tops in the sunset district! Even with the crappy seating, they still get the full ratings!", "author": "Cavan W."}

HK Seafood always appeared as some form of epicurian challenge I had to conquer for some reason. Since being transferred to The City, my goal has always been to try every restaurant in town. HK has been in my sights since my first passing. \n\nHK, when open, always was either filled inside or had a small customer base outside waiting to get in. To me, I always thought to myself this was a good thing! \n\nIn attempt to plan ahead and make my first time at HK something special I planned for Thanksgiving dinner at HK. I didn't tell my wife and she was somewhat reserved in us going out to eat in our neighborhood for Thanksgiving dinner. I would of been as apprehensive as her knowing the shortage of \"western\" style food in our part of town. \n\nSo, after putting on our Sunday best and slowly strolling up Noriega towards HK the anticipation was building inside me. We arrived and immediately noticed the small crowd waiting outside. No problem I thought. I stepped up to the hostess and proudly exclaimed, \"two for dinner\"! She looked at me as if I just spoke in some foreign tongue. I guess I did to her as she continued to just stare at me in total wonder. She scribbled something on the table sheet and gave me a scrap of paper with something else scribbled on it. After roughly 15 minutes of enjoying the warm Thanksgiving sun and the company of the other well-dressed diners we were ushered to our table. \n\nOur next challenge was in attempt to put ourselves at ease. There we were. The only Anglo-Saxon looking folks seated squarley smack dab in the middle of a sea of Asian families. After we slowly realized that not every eye in the room was staring a hole through our heads we relaxed and perused the menu. I knew what I wanted and didn't want the tasty morsels, as described on the menu, to dissuade my decision from my self-determined culinary experience. \n\nEither it was planned or our good fortune was shining upon us as the waiter arrived at our table side speaking perfect English. I told him what I wanted ... Dungeness Crab prepared anyway the chef would care to experiment with. I told the waiter I wanted the crab on a bed of spicy/garlicky noodles as well as a platter of vegetables. The waiter stood there with this look of indecision and question. The waiter spoke, \"so ... you want the crab anyway the chef thinks he should prepare it? Is that what you said?\" I looked directly into his eyes and gave him the affirmative. The waiter's face then lit up as if I just offered him the Mayor of San Francisco job. He stated the chef will be delighted to prepare the crab my way and he suggested the vegetables. Of course I had no idea what the hell he just named but when he offered a pair of frosty Tsing-Tao brewskis to start the evening off I knew we were going to be ok. \n\nOur meal arrived and as it did you would of thought I ordered deep-fried kitten. Again we experienced the un-easy feeling of every eye in the room starring a hole through, what is now the room's visual target ... our food. Which can only stated, was truly excellent. \n\nThe crab, which by this point, morphed into two Dungeness crabs was excellent. We had a Salt and Pepper crab and a deep-fried crab. Both fantastic. I had no idea what the heck the vegetable was but it was excellent. The noodles were great and just what I was hoping for. The combination of the noodles, crab and veggies was way more than my wife and I can eat. The leftovers were truly appreciated later that night.\n\nAt this point my wife was starting to become somewhat at ease. I was as well. We were now receiving thumbs up from our fellow diners on our choice. The little kids were all over but it gave the establishment a nuance that was necessary for the feeling of Thanksgiving. \n\nBottom line: Hong Kong Seafood Restaurant was excellent. The food was tasty, the service was perfectly fine and the decor was simple and clean. We were made to feel at home and thoroughly enjoyed our time and dinner. \n\nWe will be back!!", "author": "Wayne B."}

They have all the standards, all done well, and if you can read or speak chinese you have an extra section of menu opened up to you.  My advice is go with someone who can speak chinese, but some of those \"hidden\" items are a little more adventurous if you're just used to basic dim sum or chinese food.  The non dim sum menu is good as well.  It's a little pricier than the average chinese restaurant in the sunset by a few dollars per item, but it is better than some of those cheaper spots.

Unbelievable that there are so few out here with the Chinese population being so freaking high.\n\nAnd if you don't have enough restaurants to push each other to out do the other, then you will be left with this. A very mediocre place with shitty ass service and some very annoying employees.\n\nLet's start with the food. That's almost their saving grace but not really. The food here lacks consistency. Take, for example, their XO noodles. One day, it would be beautifully cooked. Nice and dry and not too oily with great spicy flavoring deep inside the noodle along with the wonderful flavor of dark soy. The next day, lightly colored noodles with hardly any spice in them and very oily. Stir frying something like this is not that hard. And the noodles are pre-packaged stuff so they take the guess out of that. Unbelievable!\n\nNow, for the employees. We've been coming here when we were looking for a house in the Sunset. Kinda stuck with us and been coming ever since. Dad likes this place more than the other place on Ulloa and 20 something. Not sure why... But the staff here sucks balls then and still sucks balls now. The only difference was the female that was the manager a couple of years ago is now the owner, I think.

Can't say the same for the rest of the crew. Some of the waiters are cool. Some are just fucking stupid and lazy. And the servers. One of them seems to be a fucking race to see who can push out the most food. She's also the same one that wants to see how much sauce she can wear in one shift. Too fast and too sloppy. And there's a couple others that look like they're all hot shit. You work as a dim sum pusher, bitch! This ain't no Miss Hong Kong! And the two bitches that run the front of house and do the cashier work. The one with the glasses needs a mirror to see that she is an ugly ass bitch.

Acts like she passed her TOEFL exam or some shit.\n\nThat being said, I still come here. But not by myself or with friends. With my family.

Waiting outside in the cold was I found out, was nothing compared to the amount of time it took for the food to come to our table.  \n\nOnce food came, the first two dishes arrived one at a time.  Without the rice too!  We really should have waited, but we were so hungry from waiting so long that we basically scarfed down those two plates.  Eventually, the rest of the dishes came, thankfully all around the same time.  \n\nI enjoyed every dish that I ate.  The prices are higher here, but you can easily tell that the food is of much higher quality.  Look at the crab/lobster tanks and compare it to any other similar restaurant in the Sunset.  They are actually alive (fresh), and you can tell when you eat it.  I must admit I have rather dull taste buds, but everyone else at the table agreed with me that the food was excellent here.\n\nSo in summation, this place makes some delicious Chinese food, but the service was excruciatingly slow.  But the food was so delicious!!", "author": "Jeff H."}

Our waitress provided great service - she was warm and accomodating - this is not very common at most Chinese restaurants. We thought our beers weren't cold enough and she brought out an ice bucket.

They ordered an egg plate that looked like egg custard, they all seemed to think it wasn't very good (but they had seconds), but I didn't like it.

The little $1.99 section on the menu is great if you don't want to spend too much.. best things there are 1. salt and pepper fried tofu squares 2. pork lungs?  comes with an awesome spicy soy sauce on a bed of brussel sprouts.  The fried calamari may sound tempting for such a low price, but it's not that good.  I could hardly taste the calamari at all and it's always soggy.  Other things to try on the menu if this is your first time: Chiu Jou Fun Go (Chiu Jou dumplings with peanuts, chives, and meat inside.. mmmmmm SO GOOD), fried shrimp dumplings, Porteguese egg tarts, and your traditional Ha Gao (plain shrimp dumpings).  \n\nWeekend afternoons are SUCH  a long wait.

We were a party of 2, arrived at about noon on Sunday and ended up waiting about 35 minutes for a table.  At about 1:30 or so, they seemed to stop sending stuff out en masse so we had to ask for an order form so we could get the last few dishes we needed to finish off our meal.  It took us a while to figure this out since neither of us is Chinese, but once we did, it was fine.\n\nThe food quality was excellent - even better than Ton Kiang in my opinion.  Every dish was hot, seasoned well, and just plain solid.  In fact, I'm still thinking about how great each dish was.  We had:\n\nbbq pork buns\nsticky rice with chicken wrapped in leaves\nshu mai\npan friend shrimp & chive dumplings\ntaro cake\nbeef rice noodles\nshrimp rice noodles\nshrimp dumplings\nbeef meatballs\n\nOur tab was $30 for all that.   \n\nI'd give it 5 stars for food quality, but gotta take off one on the overall review for service.

Weekend dim sum hours usually full and requires maybe at least 20 minutes of wait time, longer for large parties.  Same for dinner on weekends.  But they do take reservations for dinner.   My favorite dish for dim sum besides the typical siu-mai and har-gow, I like their crab porridge and lobster lo-mein.  For dinner, I love their squabs.  It's better to ask them to hold however many squabs that you want, because they run out pretty quick.  The waiters are friendly, they like to joke and chat with guests whenever they come around to make sure everything is ok, and to pick up our plates.  It's the best place to go for Chinese food in the Sunset district.  Now I'm afraid more ppl are gonna go there to eat which will cause the wait for a table to be even longer  =)  But still, I highly recommend this restaurant.", "author": "Tadaa T."}

The food is OK here, but their service is awful. During a family lunch with 14 people, I asked for an extra setting for a late guest, and the waiter rudely responded that we should have eaten at home because we were \"so troublesome.\" Then after our mean, the cashier lady simply dumped the bill on your table without looking. After spending a lot of money there for such a large group, I thought they would have wanted our repeat business. I guess not.

Nonetheless, S&T is probably the better din sum restaurants in the sunset district.  if you want better then just go to koi palace in daly city but be prepared to wait to get in.  There is a wait at S&T but not too bad.  The place is quite larde with two seperate rooms.  They do dinner service here also but I have yet to try that...it is quite full though everytime I drive by at night.   Also they've got another door outside if you just want to buy takeout.  I recommend getting takeout here instead of at the dim sum takeout shop up a block if you are looking for better quality.

The shrimp rice noodle ( ha cherng ) was good . The rice noodle was really smooth ( probably the smoothest I've had so far ) which I really liked . The shrimp dumpling ( ha gow ) and shui mai was alright . The custard bun was pretty good .. the custard was pretty creamy . The soy sauce chow mein was pretty good too . The pan fried radish cake was ok but for some reason , it tasted a little weird too . The salt & pepper squid was ehhh ..  not much flavor . The shanghai dumplings weren't that good either . Had really little soup in them & not much flavor . I liked the fact that they had big clam jook because you don't see that in a lot of places but it wasn't good . The big clam is good but not the jook . Like my dad said , they probably just used a machine to grind up the rice to make the jook . I think so because the jook was very watery and not thick at all . You can't taste any small bits of rice at all . I didn't like the texture of the mango pudding .. it was too mushy . It wasn't firm enough probably because they didn't add the powder you're suppose to add to jellos and puddings to make it firm ( I'm not sure what it's called , sorry ) . Overall , I give them 3 stars for yum cha . If I average it out with my previous dinner experience , I would have to say this restaurant deserves 3.5 stars but since Yelp doesn't allow me to get half stars , I'll cut this place some slack and give this restaurant 4 stars because the food was on the better side =]", "author": "Eileen L."}
