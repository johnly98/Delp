It's owned and ran by true Frenchies and it's a fun authentic bistro vibe. I've never had an issue with my food. Eggs are always perfectly cooked and the pain Perdu was great. Coffee is excellent too. \nI will say that the space could use some sprucing up. The decor is a little cheesy and outdated and the tables and menus could use a wipe down. \nThe service, menu, and wine is what gives this place 5 stars. I will be back :)", "author": "Nicole K."}

Because of its great deal, it's only offered Tuesday-Thursday and Sunday nights. Sadly we were told that they only served a limited number of them and could only offer us 1 prix fixe course for our group of 6 which disappointed us. \n\nWe had the boeuf bourguignon ($30, beef stewed in red wine w/ veggies), the cassoulet Toulousain ($32, beans, tomatoes, sausage, and a duck leg), the Bourride Provencale ($25, seafood stew), and a prix fixe course here and while nothing was \"bad\", everything besides the prix fixe felt like a poor value.The portions weren't large, nothing seemed very labor intensive nor were the ingredients particularly special. In addition our server forgot an item on our order and it took longer than expected to have that item removed from our bill.\n\nConclusions: I would highly recommend Baker Street Bistro for their neighborhood prix fixe menu but otherwise I would advise spending just a bit extra to go to a high-brow establishment like Jardiniere in Hayes Valley or saving money and going to Chez Maman in Potrero.", "author": "Andrew H."}

Knowing their love of old school French food, I picked Baker Street Bistro. I made a reservation for four about a half week prior for Tuesday, May 1st at 6:30pm.\n\nNeighborhood Prix Fixe ($25) x2\n*Soup of the day, plate of the day, mixed greens, dessert of the day\n*No substitutions & no sharing for the prix fixe\n*Available Sunday through Thursday evenings from 5:30pm until sold out\n*No Prix Fixe on Fridays and Saturdays\n\nBoth of my parents got the prix fixe. That day, the soup was clam chowder, the plate was pork, and the dessert was chocolate mousse. The soup was good. Not too thick and with a good amount of clams. (I'm more of a brothy soup girl.) The dessert was also tasty. A nice rich chocolate mousse. And I always need greens, so the salad fulfilled that craving. The plate of the day was the most disappointing. Came with mashed potatoes and a white sauce, but the meat was dry and overcooked. You definitely needed a lot of the sauce to counteract the rubbery texture of the meat.\n\n*Assiette Charcuti\u00e8re: P\u00e2t\u00e9 de campagne, dry saucisson, smoked duck breast, garlic sausage, cornichons & onions ($18.50)\n*Escargot Bourguignon: Snails (1/2 dozen) in garlic & parsley butter sauce ($12.50)\n*Foie-Frais de canard poele aux pommes et aux raisins: Fresh pan-seared foie-gras ($22)\n*Steak Grill\u00e9, Beurre Ma\u00eetre d'H\u00f4tel, Pomme Frites: Grilled New York Steak, Ma\u00eetre D' Butter, French fries & mixed green salad ($30)\n*Coquilles St-Jacques Saute\u00e9s, Pur\u00e9e de Brocolis & Courgettes Sautees: Pan-seared wild sea-scallops, red pepper coulis, sauteed zucchini, broccoli puree ($30)\n*Sparkling Brut, J. Roget ($12 glass)\n*2013 Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape, Domaine Juliette Avril, Rhone Valley ($60)\n*Coffee ($3)\n\nFirst off, the foie was fantastic. A great portion for the price. I ate a fair amount and even dipped the bread in the tasty foie oil. Mmmmm, meat butter. I really enjoyed the roommate's scallops. Such great flavor as they used Hokkaido scallops. My steak was cooked nicely (in between rare and medium rare), but the meat itself didn't have much flavor. I did enjoy the fries with ketchup and mayo though. Fried nicely so crispy. The snails were okay. Not much flavor, so we had to add a fair amount of salt. I wish the butter had more garlic and parsley. Would have made the dish better.\n\nCute neighborhood french bistro. I'd definitely come back for that foie. And at $25, the neighborhood menu is such a great deal. Tasty and affordable.", "author": "Elena N."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-07-01", "description": "We came here as part of an off-site for work. Since they technically close at 2:30pm, but we had to take a late lunch due to the earlier part of our off-site event, we made a reservation for 2pm for 14 people and sent in our orders ahead of time. We ran even later than anticipated due to technical errors where we were earlier, but the staff was still amazing and super friendly. Here's the breakdown:\n\nAmbiance: Cute, quaint restaurant. No frills, but has that authentic mom and pop vibe where you know the food is going to be amazing.\n\nFood: Even though we sent in our orders ahead of time, they didn't prep anything until we got there and they confirmed our orders. As an appetizer, we ordered a plate of Escargots Bourguignon to share. What's better than anything covered in butter? These were great though, and not chewy at all. I ordered the Moules Proven\u00e7ale with french fries. Others in our party ordered the Bourride Proven\u00e7ale and Paillard de Poulet. My mussels were excellent and the fries were solid. The seafood stew was also really good. The broth was rich and prefect for bread dipping. However, I don't think those that ordered the seafood stew ever got their side of risotto...\n\nDessert: Not your stereotypical desserts! We ordered the Profiteroles, Fraises Balsamic, and  \nTarte Tartin \u00e0 la Poire. All very good!\n\nDrinks: We ordered a couple bottles of red wine for the table, which were pretty good. Our waters were constantly being refilled and several people ordered, Coca-colas, lemonades, and an Arnold palmer. \n\nService: The staff was very friendly and attentive. It definitely helped that we were the only ones in the restaurant by that point, but they never made us feel like we were a bother and they ensured that we had everything they wanted before they closed the kitchen.\n\nPrice: For 14 of us, with entrees, appetizers, entrees, wine, desserts, and coffees, our total was around $700. Not bad.", "author": "Leana L."}

Unfortunately, the kitchen ran out of mashed potatoes, so we had to make do with fries. The bread roll did not come out warm and soft, but instead was hard and cold. The chicken tasted bland and the steak was okay. Better steak can be had for about the same price.

Food is fine in fact quite nice as evidenced by the four stars of many of the guests but definitely not worth enduring this one particular French server. Want to share our poor experience due to the very rude server at this bistro, which we previously found to be a quaint and lovely  little neighborhood spot. We booked an open table rezzie for a somewhat spontaneous group dinner for a 40th bday for 8 people at 8 pm on Saturday evening. While open table confirmed the reservation for 8 pm, the restaurant called and left a message for an 8:30 start instead. No problem. \n\nHowever, When the group arrived, the server advised that the kitchen closed in an hour and everyone needed to hurry and get their order in. So, while they pushed out our start time by 30 mins we needed to hurry up and order. As a former server of a fast paced higher end seafood grill, I understand how the kitchen works and that it's nice to close up shop in a timely manner. But asking a group to come in later and then rushing them to order - was the first offputting event of the evening. Also, an 8 pm dinner on a Saturday night is hardly a late night dinner.  \n\nNext, as she took the drink order, she singled out one of our group, the wife of the 40 year old and advised that she would give everyone drinks except her. The server said it loudly and in an Unkind way which was mortifying for our guest basically implying that she was too drunk to be served. My friend had a drink or two before dinner but was in no way, shape or form, sloppy or out of hand. We actually applaud when a server makes an assessment to decline drinks to someone who has been previously overserved but there were two problems with this: 1)she focused on the wrong person in the group (admittedly there were others who had been overserved) and 2)she said it in a way that was humiliating and loud. Even if she truly believed our friend was too drunk to continue to be served, she could have very easily said it in a more professional way.  This was how the meal started. Not good. \n\nThe group had to make a fast decision to either stay and eat or to leave based on the very poor service and attitude but given the time of not and the size of the group, we decided to stick it out. Bad idea!\n\nThe server and one other staff member proceeded to sit and linger across from the table, while we finished our meal further adding to a very uncomfortable experience for what should have been a super fun night. \n\nIf the restaurant didn't want a group of 8,at 8 pm on a Saturday night,they should not have accepted the reservation. \n\nI am born and raised in San Francisco as were several others at the table. Several of us have been to this establishment over the years and have been served by the French woman.  While she can be abrupt and very French, this time she crossed the line and was just plain horrible, putting a huge damper on an otherwise fun day and milestone for our friend. It was truly one of the worst experiences with a server any of us have ever had. \n\nNeedless to say, no one will be returning and we will do our best to let our friends, family and acquaintances that the service is seriously subpar.", "author": "tammy o."}

I thought it was unique and French and might as well try it. For a french restaurant, this place had a decent amount of veg options. I was thoroughly unimpressed with my meal, and the ratttoui...brb I'm just going to google this. Ok ratatouille. My ratatouille (obviously just copy/pasted) wasn't very flavorful.

The experience was not at all what one would expect from a restaurant where main dishes start at $25.Maybe we went on a bad night ???\nClaustrophobes beware! Tables are small and literally inches apart affording no privacy whatsoever. We could clearly hear conversations from each and every one of the tables beside and near us even though patrons spoke at sotto voce! Annoying too. So close together, staff had to move tables anytime anyone got up from, or returned to, a table. Those, like me, sitting against the wall on bench seats - all ladies naturally - had to keep purse and jacket on our laps. Not surprisingly a waitress knocked over a patron's wine glass while trying to squeeze a dish onto one of the table. The glass broke and sent glass shards across neighboring tables. We were two tables over and felt the spray. No apologies incidentally although the waitress did say it was her fault.\nFood not at all reminiscent of Paris! To claim it is would be an insult to French food. Started with a bread basket of soft spongy sourdough bread accompanied by frozen butter packets. The fish stew was disappointing - the broth was bland and the fish was chewy and tasteless. Anxious to leave, I asked to take it home. They packaged it in a flimsy plastic container normally used for a sandwich or dessert. \nWe chose this restaurant because it is relatively close to the Palace of Fine Arts. But will go somewhere else next time.", "author": "R C C L."}

There were 2 sets of doors and there was no sign so it wasn't clear which one to go in from.  When we walked in, we asked for a table of 4 and the only server there said she would get a table for us shortly and asked us to wait outside.  What was supposed to be a short wait ended up being over 15 minutes.  By that time, I was starving so I prayed that this place was going to be worth the wait.\n\nOnce we got seated, we realized they were serving brunch.  I'm not a huge fan of brunch so my choices of food was limited.  We were ready to order, but since there was only one server, it took forever for her to make it to our table.  Although we flagged her down, she still didn't come by right away.  By that time, I was getting annoyed.  We had to wait 15 minutes to order.  For a small place like that, it seemed like it was too much for her to handle.  The more annoying part was that she was more attentive to the table next to us and often ignored us.\n\nI ordered a Croque Madame, which was a hot ham and cheese sandwich with fried egg on top along with a side of fries.  When my food came out, it didn't look too appealing as it was a big flat sandwich smothered with cheese and a side of mixed green salad.  My father-in-law said it looked like a patty melt.  Although it was nothing special, I ended up eating most of it since I was hungry and giving the rest to my husband.  The fries were good, but nothing special either.  \n\nWhen we were done, we were ready to leave, but had to wait 15 minutes to get our check.  They said they had to reboot the computer, but by then, I was done with their excuses and being so slow.  I don't think I'll ever come back again.", "author": "Erica S."}

And we chose out because the weather was absolutely perfect and it made our dining atmosphere that much more special. \n\nBetween 5:30 and I believe 6 or 7, they offer a prix fixe dinner. I wanted to give my family the option of ordering that as well as other main dishes from the menu. \n\nOur waitress was great and she had a very appealing French accent that made our experience even more memorable. She gave us menus and answered any questions we had. We ended up ordering a lot. \n\nMy sister and father both got the prix fixe dinners, which included tomato-basil soup, a salad, pork loin with mashed potatoes as an entree, and fresh fruit for dessert. My sister wanted to try the French onion soup, so we ordered that as well. My mother and I wanted to try something different. So we ordered mussels and escargot for appetizers. My mother ordered a beef stew as an entree and I chose the duck confit. \n\nOur waitress offered us a timely manner as to how our food would be served. She brought things out so that everyone would be eating their entrees at the same time. She was great. Our family loved her service. I wish I got her name. \n\nShe first brought out the mussels and escargot. These mussels were absolutely delicious. They were perfectly cooked and the sauce it was cooked in was addicting. It was served with bread and pommes frites (aka french fries). The escargot melts in your mouth. It has a rich, buttery sauce and made me forget I was eating snails. \n\nThen the soups came out. Two tomato-basils and a French onion. It came out piping hot. And everyone enjoyed it. \n\nThen our entrees came. And by then we were so full. I was really excited to try my entree though, so I pushed through. My duck confit was rich and delicious. It was tender and juicy on the inside and had a crunchy skin. My mother's beef stew was tender and rich. My sister and father's food was juicy and also cooked perfectly. We were in French heaven. \n\nAlthough we were stuffed, we decided to order creme brulee to end our night as well as the prix fixe fresh fruit dessert. And it was perfect. \n\nThe overall bill ended up being a little over $200 but was well worth it. We also got a bottle of red wine. \n\nA helpful tip? \nCome early to find good parking. The residents here are not very forgiving. One of them tried to tow a car while we were having dinner and he was kind enough to ask around before he called. \n\nGood luck.

Well that's a disappointment so we decide to split the Oeufs Copenhague with some coffee. Time goes by and nothing is brought to us, no coffee no water, nothing. The couple next to us was seated at the same time and already had their coffee and water. We had to flag someone down and ask for our coffee. We finally get our poached eggs and Salmon and the taste is good but nothing out of the ordinary. We drink our average coffee but we're never offered refills.

That sax riff in the middle takes me back. Give me a minute... OK, I'm back on Baker Street and this time for a Saturday brunch with Jamie W. after taking an interesting morning shuttle tour of the Presidio's hidden mysteries. We were planning to go right up to Point Bonita since the lighthouse was open, but we were quite famished. Yes, I use that word. On purpose. Anyway, I had a flashback to Baker Street Bistro, a good one, so a Parisian-style d\u00e9jeuner sounded tr\u00e8s bon pour nous.\n\nAnd that's all the high school French I can remember. Anyway, it looks to be popular among the locals since the waitress appeared to recognize all the customers except us. That didn't stop us from receiving attentive service though. Everything on the brunch menu looked appetizing in a very French way. Jamie went for the $12 Oeufs B\u00e9n\u00e9dicte, eggs benedict to us unilingual plebeians, lovingly prepared with a pair of firmly poached eggs ladled generously with hollandaise sauce as they rested on Canadian bacon and a split English muffin. It came with a side of mixed greens and home fries (see photo). Now I would have normally repeated an order as luxuriant as that, but for some reason, I was drawn to the cafe sandwiches.\n\nThe $11.50 Croque Madame was calling out my name with a Brigitte Bardot accent. A smart move as it was a criminally luscious creation, a slice of ham with a thick layer of melted Swiss cheese topped by a fried egg sunny-side up, all of it resting on two slices of toasted pain de mie that were pure buttery decadence. No potatoes thankfully given the artery clogging that must have been occurring in real time, but a side of mixed greens to alleviate one's conscience about the caloric intake...NOT! (see photo). Sinfully delicious and totally worth it. Funny how comforting an overwhelming slab of melted cheese will do for you. Anxious, panting canines surrounded us. I closed my eyes and dreamt I was at the Tuileries Garden.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...decadent brunch items make this a most worthwhile weekend indulgence...the Croque Madame is a must-eat\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars...the outdoor seating is perfect on a morning on the brink of warming\nSERVICE - 4 stars...quite attentive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...play that sax solo again...\"windin' your way down on Baker Street.\nlight in your head and dead on your feet...\"", "author": "Ed U."}

It's already a tough area for parking, but factor in the gorgeous weather drawing people outside and it was going to be that much worse.  At least, so I thought - multiple spaces in front?  I like this Baker Street Bistro place already!\n\nOn top of getting nearby parking and the sunny skies above, it was awesome that we were able to snag a table outside.  What's more...the food was pretty good!  Although nothing about it really stood out, my Eggs Benedict dish wasn't too shabby (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baker-street-bistro-san-francisco?select=TYWWiz3J2mPo91QQWMd9uw#AyUN2fM9ww-44ggpPSEAaw).  The eggs were poached perfectly, the Hollandaise sauce had just a touch of acidity, and the Canadian baon was oh so good.  Sadly, the home fries were my least favorite part of the dish.  Although they weren't awful, they weren't as good as they could have been either (needed more seasoning).\n\nWhat did stand out for me was the Pain Perdu (Cinnamon French Toast) my friend had ordered for the three of us to share.  Although the added fruit and strawberry coulis made the dish a little sweeter than I would have liked, the French troast was terrific (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baker-street-bistro-san-francisco?select=TYWWiz3J2mPo91QQWMd9uw#rgpaXJRizzFg-jKuv3Z31g).  The slices were lightly browned, covered with just the right amount of cinnamon, and maintained some bite while still soaking in the syrup.  No soggy and mushy French toast here!\n\nBased on our meal and the reviews I read from other Yelpers, I'd say there's a fairly decent chance I'll be back at some point to check out their dinner menu.  However, as much as I would like to say it would be soley because of the food, the (relative) wealth of parking in this part of the Marina might have something to do with it too.

Even with no make-up, she can make head turns faster than  Wile E. Coyote. Then, you have the other sibling who is to nicely put it \"unfortunate looking\". With her make-up skills, she ends up looking like Mimi Bobeck from The Drew Carey show. I totally feel for her as I've probably been mistaken for a tranny with my quad layer caked on make-up, tattooed eyebrows, and triple stacked whore lashes mid-day. Sadly, not everyone can be as fortunate. \n\nBaker Street Bistro IS that \"unfortunate\" sibling. One of my most memorable meals last year was at its sister restaurant, Bistro Central Parc (my review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/bistro-central-parc-san-francisco#hrid:8iXzFqkMP-OUolQ737sZkg). There, the food was just as amazing as the service which was a complete opposite from my experience at Baker Street Bistro.\n\nF O O D\nNeeding to feed my foie gras addiction before the upcoming ban in 10 days, I dragged Mr. NSS here because they had three featured foie gras dishes which is the only reason I choose Baker Street Bistro for dinner. \n\n*Escargot Bourguignon in Garlic & Parsley Sauce ($10.50) - 4 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#V8MQpBbNqjwetBABV2va_A\nThe best part of our meal, the escargot was tenderly soft with a tantalizing garlicky herbaceousness.\n \n*Pan Seared Foie Gras & Smoked Duck Breast w/ Pine Nuts & Duck Gizzard Confit Salad ($16.50) - 3.5 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#TYWWiz3J2mPo91QQWMd9uw\nSurprisingly, the smoked duck breast was the winner in the dish. It was rich and tender with just the right amount of smoky flavor to awaken my taste buds. The foie gras tasted like almost like regular liver and lacked the quintessential rich decadence.    \n\n*Tournedos Rossini: Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin Topped w/ Pan Seared Foie Gras ($29) - 2 STARS\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#ZLuekYfJ7-0-WebCba8RiA\nThe Tournedos Rossini was a disappointment both in quality and execution. The bland beef tenderloin was difficult to cut and had tons of fibrous connective tissue having not been broken down making the steak extra chewy (at least my mouth got a work out). The lack of richness from the foie gras and the watery demi-glace made this dish utterly disappointing. \n\nPoor Mr. NSS's dish looked like a reduced fat dinner plate which he didn't like. \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xc9iz3CT9v133LFdjhOZcQ?select=9APlC6s9R3UCiV3iYZCP-A#gLaYkZwsOkUb87v5wmydeQ\n\nS E R V I C E\nContrived friendliness with a complete lack of attentiveness is not what I expected from a seemingly charming neighborhood restaurant especially after having received such warm, genuine, and attentive service from its sister restaurant, Bistro Central Parc. Mr. NSS had to go inside to ask for the bill and go back inside to pay for it. A bit inexcusable. \n\nA M B I A N C E / D E C O R\nParisian bistro meets French country nook with crisp white linen tables, outdoor patio seating, yellow hued walls, and rustic wooden furnishings. Seating is tight and meant for small parties no more than four. \n\nP A R K I N G\nModerate to difficult street parking. \n\nWith just less than 10 days before the foie gras ban, Baker Street Bistro is not a place I would recommend to indulge in your foie gras' desires. When you bite into foie gras, a burst of luxurious richness should coat every crevice of your mouth and have you grinning from ear-to-ear. It should make your toes curl and your eyes roll back into your head. The foie gras at Baker Street Bistro was like boring, mediocre, and mundane sex. *yawn* If you want mind-blowing \"sex\", please do yourself a favor and go to La Folie or Alexander's Steakhouse before the ban.\n\nUnless you like boring, mediocre, and mundane \"sex\" than by all means.

Living in the city and looking for a good French food experience to try for dinner (and seeing the reviews), we thought perhaps we could not go wrong with trying 'Baker Street Bistro'.\n\nAlong with my dining partner, we were squeezed into a table for two that even Munchkins could not feel comfortable fitting in. After being given menus, it took forever for the server to return to the table to take our order. So, let's cut to the chase...\n\nThe French onion Soup was tasteless. Each escargot was literally the size of a pea (yes, a pea), and even with the garlic butter sauce their taste was pitiful.  My friend had the risotto and gave it a  5/10. We both had ordered a glass of wine before the meal  and not once did the server come by to offer a refill - I sadly had to try and flag her down.\n\nI just wanted to get the check and leave.\n\nYelpers: Spend your hard earned money elsewhere.", "author": "Bobby J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-08", "description": "Three and a half stars, on the three side for my particular review. Close though.\n\nSaw this place on \"Check Please!\" and had to \"check\" it out.  Got a nice window seat with pillows which was really spacious and comfy.  Ordered a bottle of the best rose they had.  He offered for me to taste it and I said to just pour and he made me feel like a turd for not tasting the wine.  It was a fifty dollar bottle do we really have to go through with this?  Oh how the French can unknowingly make us feel like the uncultured animals that we are lol.  He was cool but there you have it.  My mom is a French native and I have been to France and Paris more times than I can remember so our \"Parisian Style\" server was exactly that to the T.\nAfter the wine came he fired all of our app's and loaded up our table like it was a Chinese food restaurant.  It worked out well since two of our app's were molten straight from the broiler but it was his call to bring out four dishes all at once.  \n\nWe had four app's and I had no problem finishing my steak frite salad.\n\nThe goat cheese salad had a great vinaigrette and diced tomato garnish.  It was good.  The goat cheese was bread crusted and deep fried in their frier. Portion was good to big.\n\nThe half dozen oysters were sweet and delicious.  Served on a bed of Ice with lemon and a mild mignonette.  Sweet small tasty fresh oysters shucked with no shell broken into the meat.\n\nMy wife loved the escargot.  I thought it was good too.  I noticed that they use tarragon in the butter which I was ok with but IMO is too sweet for escargot.  I still had no problem eating this buttery delicious dish.  \n\nThe onion soup was perfect.  Not too much crouton inside, cheese all over the bowl and toasted nicely.  Perfect gratin.  Excellent savoir.  Lots of broth.  Not too many onions.  Overflowing and spilling all over the soup charger when you crack into it.  Best balance of onion soup ingredients in a bowl in SF for sure.  Not like a chowder like often results even when I make the stuff.  \n\nMy wife had the mussels and the tarragon was completely blowing the dish away. Cream in mussels is already pushing it for me but the tarragon was a deal breaker for me at this point.  No mussel envy as I ate my entire steak frite salad.  I think even the compound butter on my steak had tarragon but it was not killing the steak which I happily ate up with a side of french mustard.  I love steak frite salad.  I think it is one of my favorites.  The steak here was a bit on the smaller side no more than 8oz. for sure.  Trimmed more than I like but it was good.  Excellent Frites.  Good salad.\n\nMy wife loves dessert so she ordered one for each of us.... I ordered a Chimay and they brought and poured me a Duvel.  No complaints from me but, heyo?\n\nThe creme brulee was good to excellent.  Vanilla beans on the bottom and all.  Snappy and not too eggy with a strawberry garnish.  \n\nThe Chocolate mousse was excellent.  I took one bite of it and the whole meal pretty much kicked in and I was KO'ed for the night.  I slept so good after this meal.  Better than I had in a long time.  That says a lot.  I will be back for sure to try their brunch maybe.  The photos of the Steak with a slice of foie look incredible.  \n\nWith tip we easily spent over $200 eating like royalty.  \n\nI will be back for the $22 prix fix chefs choice menu for sure as well.  Good value I would have to think for this level of food.", "author": "Johnny B."}

Who wants to walk into a restaurant and be approached by someone who could care less that you are patronizing them?  NO ONE.  The waiter with the big nose needs to go find work not working with the public.  We were seated at a table that had a folding chair card table chair that was brought in at a second thought and was uncomfortable .  If you like a pretentious crowd that think they are getting a \"a good dinning experience,\" then this place is for YOU! It was a joke and obviously people are gullible  enough to accept 2nd rate food, service and a shabby environment for prices that are NOT CHEAP.     The food was OK, but forgettable.   I have had much better, for less at other French restaurants.  The place is tacky and dirty.   Paint pealing and base boars scrapped up.   There is tension with the staff, and you can tell they are not pleased to be working there.  We had reservations a week in advance and the place had many available tables, but they chose to put us in a table by the service station?  When asked to sit somewhere else the guy with the big nose got indignant and was not very accommodating or respectful to our request.  That is how you treat a customer?  Sorry, there were many options, but the guy chose to be nasty.   We were served by three different people?  And the person who came to the table with our food, had to ASK US WHO HAD WHAT?   Overall, this place was a nightmare.  NEVER AGAIN!  STAY AWAY unless you want pretentious attitude,  and SO SO food in a dirty tacky place filled with people who are ripping you off.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-12-12", "description": "This review is for brunch only. 2.5 stars but rounding down due to the service.\n\nMy friend called ahead to make reservations since we had a party of 7, but they apparently don't take reservations for Saturday. They did say we shouldn't have a problem, and we were seated right away at noon. It was busy, but they have outdoor seating available as well do it didn't seem like people had to wait long to be seated. However, the service once we were sat was a different story. It took them over half an hour to take our order, and although we were chatting and catching up with each other, there wasn't much of an opportunity to flag anyone down. I was also missing a place setting, and had to ask a couple of times before someone brought me a knife and fork. After we finally ordered, the drinks took at least ten mintues before arriving, and the food took about 20 minutes after that. The dishes I tried were:\n\n-Oeufs Copenhague (Smoked Salmon, Poached Eggs, English Muffin, Hollandaise Sauce, $13.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baker-street-bistro-san-francisco?select=Y9nn31cJsirVhLhB36xd7Q#RjFVAY2fWo08QbcVIH8FEQ): Pretty good but not amazing. The smoked salmon got lost underneath the hollandaise, but the english muffin was soft and fluffy. I enjoyed the potatoes, but not all of them were cooked enough and/or crispy enough.\n -Steak \u00e0 Cheval (Steak & Egg, $24, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baker-street-bistro-san-francisco?select=Y9nn31cJsirVhLhB36xd7Q#_9kQsoDXUu_n9xBbjCeb7w): This dish is priced as $18.50 on the website, but I'm pretty the price was increased $24. For $24, I wouldn't recommend this dish. The cut of steak wasn't quality, and it was chewy and gristley. Not recommended.\n-Pain Perdu (Two Slices of Cinnamon French Toast, Fresh Fruit, Strawberry Coulis & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u00eeche, $11.50, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baker-street-bistro-san-francisco?select=Y9nn31cJsirVhLhB36xd7Q#Y9nn31cJsirVhLhB36xd7Q): Listed as \"A brunch favorite\" on the menu, I was very underwhelmed by their version of French toast. Again, it was good, but not amazing. However, the presentation was nice, with the strawberry coulis in heart shapes on the creme fraiche. They needed a bit more sauce though, since the pain perdu was on the dry side. \n-Moules Proven\u00e7ale (Mussels, White Wine, Shallots, Parsley, Tomato & Pesto, $19, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baker-street-bistro-san-francisco?select=Y9nn31cJsirVhLhB36xd7Q#AMbv2hk1gN0_vq_6NQAqRw):\nListed as the \"Best mussels in town!\" on their menu, this I would believe. They gave you a HUGE bowl of mussels, and it was a great dish to share! I also really enjoyed their white wine sauce.\n\nAside from the slow and lackluster service, the food overall was on the disappointing side. It seemed like the chef needed a little more help during the lunch rush since it didn't seem like he had any help in the kitchen, which was a semi-open concept. It took way too long for our food to arrive, and I wouldn't recommend dining here if you're in a rush. I wouldn't return here for lunch, but would give it a second chance for dinner provided the servers are different! Parking can also be tough in this area.", "author": "Amy D."}

This is classic French bistro fare that is consistent and tasty, and a place I know the missus will enjoy anytime. Gold stars all around.\n\nFood:\nI've enjoyed the Onion soup, Moules Poulette, Escargots, Charcuterie Plate, Navarin d'Agneau (lamb stew), Tournedos (beef tenderloin), grilled lamb chops, and smoked duck breast salad. My favorites are the charcuterie plate, the grilled lamb chops, and the smoked duck breast salad. One talented chef cranks out all of these dishes and more, night after night, with precision and care.  Perfectly-balanced dishes with loads of flavor.  We usually start with champagne and move on down the wine list which includes some nice chardonnays and Bordeaux. \n\nService:\nAlways excellent, including the time we had to wait an extra 30 minutes even though we had a reservation, because we were given complimentary glasses of wine and thanked for our patience.  The servers give great recommendations in case you aren't sure what will work with your choices, so no need to fear the wine list.  Really great service.\n\nVibe:\nEat-and-drink-the-night-away-chic.  Time seems to stop when we go to Baker Street, and all I want to do is order yet another bottle of wine and another charcuterie plate.  Outdoor seating is great on a sunny day, with heaters perfect for chilly nights. Dress up if you like, or not; it doesn't really matter.\n\nFamily-friendly:\nSeulement si les enfants adorent la cuisine Francaise.  But if they aren't into French food, either bring them for brunch or just leave them at home and save Baker Street for date night.\n\nSummary:\nBaker Street is one of a few restaurants that has restored my faith in French Bistro fare, and for that I am thankful.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-02-12", "description": "I was excited to brunch at Baker St. Bistro, a cute little neighborhood place with outdoor seating, a French proprietor, a simple yet delicious brunch menu, and some great company to enjoy my first meal in SF.  The menu consists of a variety of 5 eggs benedict, the croque monsieur or croque madame, a variety of salads and a few entree plates of mussels and a few other options.\n\nWe get quickly sat and handed our menus. We wait, we wait a little bit more, we still wait a little bit more (but, all this was somewhat  ok since conversation was flowing and we were having fun albeit being thirsty).  We put in our orders.  The food came out pretty fast. The fruit plate ($9) was fresh and good but teeny tiny and I wasn't impressed.  The boyfriend ordered the croque madame, boasting this may be the best croque madame he has ever had although he pretty much says that daily about almost anything that is really good. Regardless, it was a damn good croque. \n \nMy eggs benedict were regular; nothing different or amazing but, the kicker were the potatoes that came with the dish. These potatoes were flavorful yet, they were cold and hard almost inedible (although I did eat them, since I eat everything that is put in front of my face clearly). These babies definitely seemed as if they were sitting around in the back for an hour or so. The coffee was nothing amazing and it took the waitress or bus boy about 30 minutes to come by and actually refill those mugs.  We waited for what seemed to be a lifetime for our check and I finally just went up to the proprietor (who seemed to be the only waitress) and gave her my credit card. I seriously think there was one waitress/hostess and one busser for this busy somewhat largish restaurant.  The service faltered.\n\nOverall the food was at about a 3.5 type meal (I typically round up) but, the service brought this meal down to a solid 3 stars.  I'm a visitor to this delicious city so I have way too many other places to try than to come back to this place again.  Sorry Baker St Bistro, I will not be back not even for that delicious croque madame.", "author": "Stephanie Y."}

From the first moment you walk in, the one waiter/hostess/owner? sets the tone with an aggressive \"Can I help you?\" as if you've pig-headedly wandered into her home. \n\nFor brunch, the menu is so petite that what is there better be spectacular- your choices: pain perdu (french toast), mussles, eggs benedict (and variations), salad or croque monsieur (ham/swiss sandwich). \n\nWe had: The eggs benedict and the croque monsieur. \n\nOur friends had the eggs florentine and the french toast, so we pretty much had the menu covered (my sandwich came with a salad). \n\nThe sandwich was good but nothing to write home about. Ham, melted swiss, butter and fresh bread. The salad was a small bunch of greens with a non-descript almost un-tasteable dressing. \n\nThe french toast was apparently decently good, but my friend couldn't stop talking about how disappointing it was to have fancy, expensive french toast without real maple syrup.\n\nThe menfolk seemed contented with their eggs.\n\nThe french fries *were* spectacular, but that was about all that was. The coffee was strong and flavorful as well.\n\nHowever, it got quite crowded for a small joint, and apparently the do-it-yourselfer owner/manager doesn't want to pay for another waiter. So there was a lot of waiting on our part, and not a lot of good service on hers. Mostly it was intermittent \"I'll get there when I get there\" interactions with her, and 30 minutes of empty coffee cups, 50 minutes before our food came sortof experience.\n\nAnd the place isn't cheap.\n\nWouldn't recommend.", "author": "Nadia H."}

Well, let's start not with the food but with the ambiance, a funky \"Paris-bistro\" decor marred only by the unwillingness of the oh-so-trendy couple who were unwilling to even suggest to their bratty hooligan 8-year old that he restrain himself. \"Isn't he cute, climbing the bar and spilling the drinks?\"  \"Isn't he precocious, opening the door with the handicapped push-plate - and keeping it open so all that nice, cool fog could come into the restaurant?\"  Until my wife yelled at the little monster to close the door!  Some people have no courtesy.  Or common sense.  Of course, when they (finally) left they were replaced by a group of millennials who were unbelievably loud - I'm sure there were a few in Burlingame that didn't hear them.\n\nIt would have helped if the restaurant staff politely suggested that such behavior could, just possibly, interfere with the other guests' enjoyment of the premises but maybe that's a bridge too far.\n\nSo, let's get on to the food.  I had the boeuf bourguignon.  It's a dish I've made dozens of times and enjoyed in bistros all over the world.  Not here.  First of all, the beef was tough and flavorless, sure signs of it having sat on the stove, simmering, for the better part of hours.  The dish tasted strongly of celery and undercooked wine, which tells me the chef doesn't have a clue about how and when to add his aromatics.  It was as insipid a dish as I've ever had, an effort that my children could easily surpass.\n\nI'd love to tell you that my wife's scallops were better but I'd be lying if I did.  She was presented with a beautiful plate but the scallops were brutally overcooked.  What flavor was left was sharp and astringent, with a tough and unforgiving texture. They were presented on a puree of potatoes and broccoli, which I thought was a rather odd combo for scallops - and it didn't work.\n\nThe only dish at the table was our dinner companion's steak frittes - it's pretty hard to screw that up.  And, no, we didn't accept the dessert offerings.\n\nI dined here maybe 20 years ago and remembered it as being half decent.  Today, I'd cut that 50% by 90%.  Not Recommended.", "author": "robert l."}

You can park around here, eat then walk over to Palace of Fine arts / Exploratorium quite easily.\n\nCute french restaurant with real French server (not sure if he's the owner?)\n\nTheir early dinner pre fixe menu (for $18.50) is a REAL BARGAIN.\n\nFour of us went and we all decided to have the prefixe menu.  \n\nBaguette & butter. Your standard fare. \n\nSoup of the day: Cauliflower soup.  A little spicy and a little bland but not bad.\n\nMain: Pork chop with white beans.  Nothing spectacular but not bad either.  It was cooked just right.  Oh and it came with a side of salad. \n\nDessert: Chocolate Mouse cake with cream and strawberries.  How can you ever go wrong with chocolate?\n\nThe portions were JUST RIGHT for a pre fixe menu.  Their non pre-fixe entrees looked a lot bigger - but with 3 courses we really didn't need any more food than what was given to us. \n\nNow for the fun part.  If you like medium to sweet white wine, be sure to ask \"What are your sweeter wines?\".  He'll say \"We have no sweet wines\".  (last time I went with some girlfriends he elaborated and said that only dessert wines are supposed to be sweet - with a face that could be interpreted as \"you ignorant americans\" haha)  \n\nBasically if you like your white wine sweet / medium - you are out of luck.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-09-19", "description": "Tucked in a less traveled corner of Cow Hollow flanked by dive bars like Liverpool Lil's and Final Final, Baker Street Bistro is a v\u00e9ritable restaurant de voisinage (true neighborhood restaurant).\n\nSince 1991, Baker Street Bistro has been turning out classic French bistro food.  Nothing fancy.  Nothing imaginative.  Nothing over-the-top.  Just simple, solid meals to the delight of Francophiles throughout The City.\n\nTopped with rich, pan-seared foie gras and flavorful smoked duck breast, the salade du sud-ouest ($14.50) makes a simple bed of mixed greens with pine nuts sing.  Unfortunately, the chef was heavy-handed with both sesame oil and capers, overpowering the delicate flavor of the tuna in the tartare de thon (tuna tartare, $14.50).\n\nThe classic moules Proven\u00e7ale (mussels with white wine, shallots, parsley, tomato, and pesto, $16.50) was delicious, while the accompanying frites (fries) lacked the correct hint of golden brown, indicating slight under cooking.  Drizzled with a rich carrot and ginger wine reduction, the poulet saut\u00e9 (saut\u00e9ed chicken breast, $16.50) was moist and tasty, but the vegetables and mashed potato sides were nothing special.\n\nThe reasonably priced wine list is almost exclusively comprised of European selections.  A warning, however:  many wines are stored in the overly warm dining room, both making the temperature at which they are served too high and potentially jeopardizing their freshness.\n\nService is typically French--a little brusque, slightly hurried, and not all that friendly.  In other words, authentic.\n\nSure, one can find more innovation, a higher level of execution, and better service at other French bistros in the City (Chapeau!, for example), but this higher level of establishment comes with a steeper price tag.  For The City, Baker Street Bistro is a value, offering mostly well prepared food at reasonable prices.", "author": "CJ G."}

Seems we covered anatidae anatomy 101: I had the seared foie gras (this was pre-ban), and my friends had the duck breast and duck confit. Lot of bird parts on the table!\n\nNo one seemed particularly impressed with their dish but me. We all agreed the duck breast lacked flavor and the confit was just average. The foie gras was, by far, the best item on the table. It wasn't served with the prettiest presentation (a bit on the oily-looking side), but it was cooked perfectly and had a gorgeous, rich flavor. I really didn't wanna share, but everyone kept reaching for my beloved soon-to-be-banned delicacy. It was served with apple compote and grapes. Even my fiercely anti-foie-gras/animal rights enthusiast friend dared to have a bite after I reminded her that \"her people\" have won the war (for now) - and she admitted it was delicious.\n\nOverall, it was a pleasant experience to dine here. Service was alright and parking was easy to find. The food could use a little work.", "author": "Thy N."}

There is outdoor seating as well as a modest amount of indoor seating.  There were 7 of us so we sat inside.  They don't take reservations for groups under 10, so it was a bit tricky, but it worked out just fine.\n\nThe items ordered:  eggs benedict, a ham and cheese croque, another ham and cheese on a baguette, the charcuterie plate, cheese plate and a bowl of fruit.\n\nThe benedicts were absolutely perfect.  Sauce was quite possibly the best I've ever had - hint of lemon, not too buttery. Eggs were poached to perfection.  The breakfast potatoes were quite tasty.\n\nThe charcuterie plate: various cured meats and a duck liver pate.  I couldn't stop eating the pate, and the whole plate was devoured by several of us.  There was plenty for 4 people to share.\n\nI had very little of the cheese plate, so couldn't really speak much for that, though it did look lovely.\n\nThe croque sandwich was decadent beyond belief.  I only had 1 bite, but it was unctuous and cheesy and tasty.  The ham was sliced very thinly and I would have liked a bit more of it.\n\nMy daughter ordered the bowl of fruit.  It as the largest most beautiful array of fruit I have ever seen in a restaurant.  A wide variety of very fresh fruits.\n\nApparently there was no server/busboy that day so the owner (?) was dashing around wearing his stress on his sleeve.  It was unnerving and a little sad, and I say that sympathetically.  I caught his eye as he came storming in from the outside with plates in his hand.  I was sitting in such a way that could easily have been mistaken for trying to get his attention, so as he approached, he looked at me, hesitated and was about to ask if I needed anything.  I just smiled and said, \"No - we're all fine.\"  A while later, he came back to ask if everything was ok, and my friend and I told him everything was wonderful, but that we thought he should take a moment to breathe...  He was gracious and totally got what we were saying.  While he was trying so hard to please everyone, he lost sight of the fact that he can only do one thing at a time, and no one was in a hurry to go anywhere.  At least, that was my take.  Slow down, breathe, and know it'll all get done! \n\nAnother note:  Our usual breakfast joint in the Marina is Home Plate.  I managed to sway my husband to try a new place, and I'm SO glad to say that he loved it so much he wouldn't hesitate to go back.

We knew we were going to be a bit late so we called later on to move our reservations another 30 minutes. The restaurant gave us no issues with that request. No one sat outside because it was a really cold night. The place got pretty packed during our dinner.\n\nMy friend who has came to this place before told me that the menu looked quite different from the last time. Perhaps, they keep some of the stuff on the menu on all the time where as some entrees' they keep changing around.\n\nThe place is small but very cozy. The bathroom is only a onsy but it felt even that was nicely decorated. The staff was friendly.\n\nI originally wanted the sea scallops but they ran out so the server recommended the sea bass dish which turned out really good. My friend knew I wasn't going to be full so she gave me some of her mussels and french fries which was also very delish. If you decide to get the mussels, make sure you get the fries too (it's optional for an extra $2 I think). Dip or soak the fries in the mussel sauce. Soooo good!\n\nI think everyone was pretty satisfied with their food. We had a bottle of Pinot Grigio to compliment our dinner which was a good call. By the time, we were done with our main course we didn't have any room for dessert even though I was craving the Creme' Brulee. Had to pass because I couldn't down anything else. Also, I forgot to mention that the dinner roll was pretty good/fresh as well.\n\nI would definitely come back here. It worked out for a party of 6 but I think this would be a good place to bring a date. It's not so loud and crazy, it's cozy, and not too too expensive.\n\nThe only issue I had with this place was that the parking sucks. You have to look for street parking.

Our orders were similar, but not the same, so we had hoped the waiter will know which one goes where when he dropped them off. After the food was dropped off at the table, the waiter didn't bother to check if he got our orders correctly. We no longer saw him at all during the rest of the dining hour.\n\nSo, at the end, my husband went to pay the bill. He decided to not tip for the food and service that was below our expectation.

I agree 100% one of the reviewer's review: \" service is horrible, nerve go back again \". This morning my husband took me to this small restaurant for brunch before we head to the beach. What French restaurant means ? If it is not fancy, at least cozy warm place, right ? No ! It locates right next to several big trash dumpster. \nThe restaurant is not busy early this morning, only one customer at outdoor table, three customers inside. One African American with French accent behind the counter took her time to finish her drink from a big paper cup while we sat waiting for her come to us to take our order. Guess what? The server finally put down her drink cup, took a paper wiping her mouth and came to our table taking our orders without washing her hands. While we waited for our food, I watched her picked up something from the floor. I am a nurse, I cannot tolerate poor hygiene of restaurant staffs. But I did not say anything just because I don't want to ruin a good day and good mood. I just wish she is not the one serve the food. Unfortunately, this woman served our food. We ordered three dishes. Pain Perdue, eggs Benedict and mussels. Mussels tastes ok, pain Perdue looks pretty so I want to save for the last. I started to eat eggs Benedict. I found the salad is not fresh at all. 1/3 of salad of the dish is yellow, half yellow even black leaves. Obviously the salad has been a few days old. Just like you buy a big box of salad from Costco, you can't finish them all in one or two days. A few days later, you find the mixed salad go bad, you either throw them away, or at least you pick out the rotten salad, rewash the remaining one still can eat. So I picked out some yellow and rotten salad to the empty plate. I showed the salad to that server and said: \" this salad is not fresh.\" She took the plate back to kitchen then she come back challenged me: \" you said this salad not fresh ? The yellow leaves just young one \" I told her that I eat salad everyday and I know what is fresh and what is not fresh. She started to argue with me with very bad attitude. My God ! Where in the world a restaurant server argued with a customer who complained the salad not fresh with obvious evidence! I asked her if she is owner or not. She said she is not. I asked her who is the chief and I want to talk to the chief instead of her. She told me the chief is not in the restaurant now. Our food were served 10 minutes ago, now the chief is not in the restaurant now ? I am very upset about her rude attitude and lie. She asked me what about the rest of salad and other food on that plate. She did not even offer exchange a plate with fresh salad. Of course, I told her that I will not eat that plate with rotten salad. She went back to kitchen and came out yelled at us with angry voice: \" all the dishes is on house. Thankful for coming.\" Wow, she wanted us to leave. I told her that we would never come back again. She got mad like a crazy dog. She pushed the door open and yelled to us: \"out, out. \" basically, that server with a bad attitude instead of with a smile, that server argued with customer instead of apologizing for the bad food, that server with poor hygiene instead of wearing clean uniform and good hygiene ruined our holiday weekend. We ordered 3 plates of food and only ate half of mussels and we got kicked out. What a awful, horrible experience ! Nerve ever go back again!\nAlso, I noted that the restaurant' s breads and butters are just placed on a small short table along the narrow hallway close to the restroom. I can understand and accept the food table placed in the narrow hallway because of limited space, but at least use a cloth to cover the bread.", "author": "Yanhua L."}

The toast offering was measly and missing the shredded cheese on top of the sauce.  Also, I think whole wheat was a bad choice to soak up the broth.  I didn't like how the salmon filet was in tiny chunks as opposed to a single large piece.  The shrimp were small and tough, a sign of being overcooked.

A tasty Sunday brunch before driving back to Los Angeles was exactly what I needed.  There were three of us, we had Oeufs Copenhague, Oeufs Florentine, and Pain Perdu.\n\nOeufs Copenhague is a smoked salmon \"Eggs Benedict\" with a buttery hollendaise that was intoxicating.  I regretfully did not get a bite of my friend's Oeufs Florentine, that greedy gus!  Next time for sure!\n\nBoth Oeufs dishes came with a side salad that was a nice spring mix lightly tossed with vinaigrette, and tender roasted potatoes with herbs.\n\nThe Pain Perdu (French Toast) was delicately egg battered with cinnamon sugar, maple syrup and came with creme fraiche and strawberry coulis artfully swirled on the plate for dipping and a side of fresh fruit.  We all agreed that the maple syrup could have been served on the side rather than drizzled on top, that way there was the option to choose between the different sauces available, but the combination of maple syrup and strawberry / cream was actually pretty darn delicious.\n\nThere is outdoor seating, very reminiscent to Parisian cafe, and an extremely friendly and helpful waitress.  If you want to practice your French she'll gladly oblige, or answer questions about what the dishes or just help with translation or pronunciation if you wish.  \n\nI have to admit, the decor is a little old and funky.  Oversized Christmas ornaments, random vintage clocks and an odd wall sculpture featuring ducks.

Though Baker Street Bistro oozes with Parisian charm, the high prices do not justify the mediocrity of the food.  \n\nA few friends and I found ourselves in the area on Saturday night and were able to snag a last-minute reservation.  Between us, we ordered the following:\n- Scallops special\n- Salmon special\n- Lamb Stew\n- Mussels\n- An extra order of fries\n- Profiteroles for dessert\n\nMy friends claimed that the lamb stew and the mussels were both very tasty.  For that, I would bump this review up to 2.5 stars, though I didn't try either of the dishes so I can't confirm.  \n\nI ordered the scallops and my boyfriend ordered the salmon.  Having tried both of them, I am shocked that the other food was tasty.  My scallops were almost entirely devoid of flavor, and the little taste they had was fishy and unpleasant.  I had 4 scallops on my plate and I could only stomach 1.  My boyfriend's salmon was no better and the portion size was miniscule.  He finished his salmon, then ate the rest of my scallops and declared that they were much better than his salmon.  Poor soul.  \n\nThe side order of fries was very tasty.  Good thing, too, since this constituted the bulk of my meal (very healthy, I know).\n\nThe profiteroles filled with ice cream were delicious.  Very heavy, but delicious.  I recommend them for dessert.\n\nGiven the experience, our bill was entirely too high.  I think we paid $30 each, and that does not include appetizers or drinks.  Our meal definitely was not worth that much.  \n\nI think it's safe to say that I won't be back.", "author": "Julie S."}

My friend was extremely satisfied by the croque-monsieur, which was quite large and prepared exactly as I remember them to be in France. \n\nOur waitress was wonderful, constantly checking in on us. I felt very at home, especially because she spoke a blend of Creole and English. Speaking to her in French was a wonderful opportunity to practice the language,  and she was extremely welcoming. Would definitely go again to at least say hello!", "author": "Travis L."}

I have to admit, it was a great idea. Super cute and super close to the theater. It was raining and he dropped me out in front to grab a table- so sweet. We were in a rush so ordered our entrees pretty quickly. I had the mussels while he had the chicken special. My order of mussels was GINORMOUS. I mean, it could feed 5 people at best. But of course, being the lady that I am, finished it off in one swoop. Wait staff is attentive and food came out in a timely matter.

While the food was delivered to the table in a reasonable period of time, no one ever returned to ask us if everything was okay or if we were enjoying the meal.

I had the duck breast l'Orange.  Duck was overcooked and lacked a good layer of crispy melty fat that really makes duck knock my socks off.\n\nThe real annoyances were the service, selection and prices.  Service was slow and our waiter just had that forced, fake style of waiting that makes my skin crawl.  Many of the items on the menu were not available, including the duck confit, which was my original choice.\n\nAND NOTE BENE: the prices are about $2-3 dollars more than listed on their menu online.

So delicious and full of flavor. The chocolate mousse was so good! \n\nAnd, the onion soup was good too, although it is heavy on cheese. Next time I go back I want to try the salad with the walnut caramelized glazed Feta cheese. \n\nMy friend had that and said it was delicious!

Fiance and I ate here on a Saturday night around 9:15pm after spending the day in Marin.  \n\nPros:  I appreciate a French restaurant where the chef and the staff actually speaks French.  The location of this bistro is very unassuming with seats both inside and outside the restaurant.  Because of our late seating time, we had a wonderful little table for two by the window.  \n\nThe menu had enough selections without feeling like they were trying too hard.  While they were out of the oysters (which I was told was delightful), we couldn't help ourselves and ordered 3 appetizers to share - the escargot, a foie gras terrine, and an assortment plate with cold cuts and another pate.  They had a decent wine selection as well.  We also ordered a NY Steak and a seafood stew.  Finally, because that's the only dessert I can't possibly resist even though I'm trying to fit into a wedding dress, we shared an order of profiteroles.\n\nLet's talk about the food.  The foie gras terrine had a wonderfully rich flavor that made me keep reaching back for more bread.  According to the waiter, the foie gras is braised with cognac rather than port, and while the alcohol is faint, it's noticeable.  The melt in your mouth quality is superb, and it took an extreme amount of willpower not to reach over and eat my fiance's share.  The assorted meats and pate platter was very good.  If we didn't already order the terrine, I'd have attacked the pate like there was no tomorrow.  It was so good that I decided we needed to box it up and eat it the next day.  Which is today, and I can still tell you it was delicious. \n\nOur main course arrived with generous portions of food.  Tried a bite of fiance's NY Steak and found it acceptable, but not stellar.  My seafood stew on the other hand was wonderful.  Most seafood stews I've had had an overabundance of tomato, but the seafood broth for this dish was flavorful without taking away the individual flavors of the seafood inside.  The side of risotto was also delicious.\n\nBy the time the profiteroles came along, I was more than pleasantly full.  The ice cream was teeth hurting cold, which made the chocolate sauce harden.  But it was wonderfully good.  Many restaurants don't serve this, but when I do get my fix, it's most certainly a treat.\n\nLast but certainly not least, the waiters were superb.  It might have to do with the fact we were the last diners of the evening, but our glasses were always full, never had a moment to complain about.  We had wonderful service.\n\nCons:  Despite the mostly glowing review above, there were a few small things which make me unfortunately give this place a solid 4 rather than the 5 stars I so wanted.\n\nI found Krab with a \"K\" in my seafood stew.  Now, I'm not an entire snob, but Krab with a \"K\" had no place in there.  I'm a firm believer that if you do not have the actual decent ingredient, you don't put it in.  I definitely think it didn't need to be there, and the dish would have turned out equally wonderful.  So yes, slightly disillusioned now that the seafood stew was not perfect after all.\n\nAlso, I was not in love with the escargot dish.  I think it's one of those things where the garlic butter sauce completely overpowered the escargot to the point I couldn't really tell what I was eating.  To be honest, the size and the quality could have been better for the price they charged.  Slightly disappointed.  But completely forgotten after eating a piece of the foie gras terrine (see the raving positive comments above).\n\nAnd lastly, I was slightly disappointed when they refused to let me get a box for the remains of my seafood stew.  They worried I might get food poisoning if I took it home with us, and did not pack it for me to go.  Was somewhat upset that they made that determination for me.  Which noble in their intent to cover their butts if I die of food poisoning, that was my call to make.  Plus, had I known they wouldn't have let me take it home, I'd have finished all my mussels!  Argh!\n\nBottom line:  I would definitely come here again.  And I would skip the escargot.  And not share the foie gras terrine, because it's awesome.  And the best part of the night - despite all the binge ordering, the meal came out before tip, under $100.  Imagine that!  If I live in the city, I'd most assuredly come back whenever I'd like a bistro fix.", "author": "Minnie L."}

The food and the service were superb. This is not a pretentious place, and we were made to feel quite at home from the moment we entered.

The owner took our order and attended to our needs, without hovering or attempting to oversell his offerings. My lamb stew was excellent, and it is a regular menu item. My wife ordered the salmon special. She commented on how moist the fish was - we cook salmon a lot and know it takes extra care to avoid drying it out while cooking.

This guy has the same amount of obsession that the owner of Burma Superstar has... (A high school friend of mine is one of her friends and knew her before she started. Wow, she was so attentive to what we did and didn't eat and constantly asking us why or why not... ). \n\nI can't explain it, but there are a lot of things that are very important that are hard to measure on spreadsheets. It's extremely difficult to recognize when someone's talented at business.  \n\n It's hard for me to even write a clever food review because it's not my territory. I'm like the truck driver wandering by mistake into the beauty salon. Heck, even I am out of my territory in the beauty salon.\n\nFrench food is really a cliche in America based on the 1990s superpower Impressionist art shows in all the great museums and weird ideas based on 1890s France. I wouldn't be surprised if most American tourists stumbled out of the airplane expecting French people to be working part time on Serge Gainsbourg style videos and reading Japanese novels, which is the subconscious mentality I had.\n\n and it's so nice to stumble into a little French Basque bistro like this.  I didn't even -know- there were Basques in France. \n\nOne of my best friends took me to a down-home country style French restaraunt when I was in Paris and it was a mild shock to me, because I'm so used to French food being marketed to a weird market segment, mainly nouveau riche people who like to buy $400 high heels. It was really neat. There are farmers in France and they eat food that's very different from what's usually presented. So that's the same feeling I got at the Baker Street Bistro. \n\nIt's extremely refreshing for an uncouth barbarian like me to find stuff like this, but in truth my friends are all real-deal food and wine maniacs,   so I stumbled on this place only through their great wisdom. \n\nMy friends like to tease me about my bad habits, as I used to never consider food this essential life item (that's what hip hop records and the truly great sneakers are for), so I appreciate them gently guiding me back to the light. \n\nThanks for introducing me to this place, it's run by good people who make great food!

We started with escargot, the charcuterie platter, two salads, and mussels. We had also ordered soup, but the server warned us that it was way too much food. My brother was not swayed. He had the apps as well as the french onion soup and a salad. And yes, he finished his meal. The escargot was buttery, but not garlicky enough. We also could not enjoy this as much because we could not get bread. We ordered twice, but we were done with apps by the time she finally remembered. The birthday girl seemed to enjoy the charcuterie platter, but I did not really sample. What I tried was bland. I prefer Italian charcuterie over the French style. The salads came with a wheel of fried, breaded goat cheese. That was the best tasting and prepared fried goat cheese I have had. The rest of the salad was a simple mix of lettuce in a light vinaigrette. The star dish of the night was the mussels with fries. It is meant to be an entree portion, but we thought it would be okay for an app for our party of five. The serving was HUGE and seemed endless. Mussels were fresh, flavorful, and cooked perfectly. We were also surprised by how crispy and tasty the fries were. We dipped them in the mussel broth (since we had no bread) which made them even tastier. Entrees were disappointing. Four of us ordered the duck, all medium. They all came well-done which means dry and tasteless. My brother ordered the scallop special for $30. Four small scallops on the plate.

This immediately evoked the humor of our host, who owned the restaurant, and we had a lovely time dancing through the menu choices. Ultimately, we did order the escargot and French fries. Wait, we had entrees as well. The bourride, a fish stew, was delicious. The Caesar salad was just right. The croque monsieur brought ham and cheese to a new level of consciousness. Really, it was amazing! \n\nSomewhere in the middle of all this we decided to order wine. Quelle surprise! Given that we were trying to decide on three glasses, the owner suggested we share a half bottle of the Sancerre 2007 sauvignon blanc. We were delighted to discover it \"was fermented without introducing cultured yeasts,\" and we savored its complexity. \n\nDessert was mandatory, of course!  Chocolate cake, creme broulee, and profiteroles graced the table, with 2 coffees and 1 tea. The whole afternoon cost $137.43 + tip, of which $25 was the Sancerre, and $25.50 was the 3 kir royales. \n\nWe engaged the owner in conversation, and found out he was a neighbor of ours!

All of the non-prix fixe entrees (duck confit, filet with foie gras, risotto, etc.) were eloquently and deliciously described in the menu, while the prix fixe entree was referred to unenthusiastically as \"chicken stew with tomatoes and potatoes.\" The dessert? \"Something with coconuts.\" I guess we won't be having that...\n\nI ordered the new york steak with shallots, tarragon butter and pommes frites. The steak was just okay; a bit over-buttered, uncomfortably chewy and undercooked. I definitely would not order it again.

For dessert, we once again ordered the profiteroles--chocolate covered cream puffs with vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries.

Loved the ginormous slices of bread - perfect for sharing.\n\nWe also split the two eggs whites scrambled, which was better than average thanks to generous portions and what seemed to be a lack of excess oil and butter.

I was very much disappointed by ALL of street bistros/cafes over there.\n\nFood at Baker Street Bistro, in SF USA, is by far better.   At every plain dish served in real France, I couldn't help imaging back this restaurant in the rim of Marina district.\n\nAnd changed my mind about the fruit fly.    After all, fruit flies make me nostalgic of the good old high school experiment...\n\n\n***ORIGINAL REVIEW 8/19/07***\nThanks to Sofi O., I was able to discover this wonderful restaurant.  Many say it's a cute neighborhood restaurant, but it's actually more than that.  Went here for dinner, and food was very good.\n\nI say they have the best food out of  other similar-type French restaurants -- namely Fringale, Chapeau, Cassis, South Park Bistro, etc. -- that are noted for cozy Parisian feel, quality food, and reasonable prices.\n\nThe only reason for one less star is bugging flies.  There were one or two flying throughout our meal, and I found a fruit fly in my Sauterne (a dessert wine).  I will have to go back here again and check for flies next time in order to give full 5 stars.", "author": "Mami T."}

Right in the middle of a neighborhood.  Foodwise, it was average.  We had the french onion soup, hangar steak, and an encrusted white fish.  Washed it down with a bottle of pinot noir.  I never saw the bill, but the prices on the a la carte menu weren't on par with the quality of food.\n\nIt's probably only worth it if you have their prix fixe:  soup, salad, entree, and dessert for around $17.00.

I was ready to slice and dice with my recently used butter knife.\n\nIt was a friend's b-day, we order some apps  the assorted pate plate w/ crostini, ordered a nice bottle of Pinot Grigio and start to enjoy the evening.  We got to ordering the entree.  Now though I am a big fan of the meat and love to eat it, very very rarely do I order steak.  I don't really know the cuts of meats etc...I can be a simple girl at times.  I order \"steak\" when I'm with the folks and they want the fine dining of Black Angus, I don't do steak at some fancy sassy Bistro.  I digress.\n\nSo this is how it goes:\n\nMe:  \"I'll have the New York Steak\"\nWaitress:  \"Medium rare. yes?\"\nMe: \"Hmm...medium, I'm not a big fan of bloody meat.  Maybe...\"\nWaitress: She just looks at me like I'm crazy, \"how dare she ask for it medium!\"\n\nPause...\n\nMy sister interrupts, \"New York steak is best served medium rare, otherwise it ruins the cut of the steak. You don't want it overcooked.\"\n\nMe:  \"I guess, still not a fan of the bloody meat.  I'll try it.   Medium rare, then.  Thanks.\"\n\nOkay, so the waitress does one of these Euro type hmmmphs, tilts her head to the right, and ROLLS HER EYES!!!  I know in her head, she is thinking, \"Theeese steww-pid Ah-merhi-CAN with their gauche ways!! I can't beleeeve she wants it medium.  Sacre bleu!!!\"\n\nAnyway, it set me off and was unnecessary and rude.  This just further adds to my stereotypes of French people.  However karma is a bitch, she broke two glasses throughout the evening.\n\nSo I got my steak, I'm not a hypocrite, it was good, it wasn't too bloody, and it was a nice cut of meat.  However, I could have done without the eye rolling.  The shallot tarragon butter?  It tasted like regular butter.  But who knows, I may not be that discerning in taste since I didn't know New York steak is best served medium rare.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2012-05-10", "description": "I've been here three times now---although previous visits were quite a few years back.  This is a nice little neighborhood place, and being in a neighborhood, even though it's just off the bend where Lombard (the boulevard) becomes Richardson, there isn't a lot of parking---I'd cab it, if you can find one of those, these days.  Baker Street Bistro seems to be very popular among the ladies of a certain age, as for most of our time there the place was divided nearly by half between thirty somethings and posh older women.\n\nThe menu is fairly diverse and from my standpoint a delight in that there was NO pizza, NO burgers, NO mac-n-cheese, and NO hangar steak (for the burger/pizza/mac-n-cheese crowd who are evolving).  Whoopee!  The by-the-bottle wine list was decent, with the most expensive bottle at $65.00.  We very much enjoyed our selection, and it was a great improvement over they by-the-glass reds available, and the sparkling wine.\n\nWhere Baker Street falls short is in value.  With entrees (main courses) right around $30.00 it's up there with the City's best establishments (or, perversely, right down there with the tourist joints in the Wharf) yet I didn't think the food was at the same level as the price.  I started with oysters (if the oysters aren't bad, they're bound to be good, and the sauce was spot on), and then had the Foie Gras, just because it's going to be illegal---I don't see what the attraction is, it's liver that tastes like very mild liver, but now that it's illegal I'll have to have more of it to fight the Nanny State.  The partner had the warm chevre salad, which he also liked, although I thought it was better at Chez Papa.  For our main course I had the Boeuf Bourgignon and the Partner had the halibut, which he pronounced delightful.  My boeuf bourgignon was decent;  the beef was flavorful and soft, although the sauce seemed a bit thin and there were no mushrooms, but recipes vary by region and I'm no expert on French cooking.  Still, when my own recipe (Julia Child) tastes better than an expensive restaurant dish, I'm never a happy camper.  I want to aspire to restaurant quality, but I want the restaurants to wow me.\n\nWe finished with dessert---a Tarte Tatin with pears, and strawberries with black pepper and basalmic, with vanilla ice cream.  The vanilla ice cream was very good, but next time I'd request it on the side of not at all, as the berry/basalmic/pepper combination was a bit overwhelmed by by the ice cream.  The flavors are very subtle and I think that without the ice cream this dessert would have stolen the night's show.  I want to try it at home.\n\nBecause another poster brought it up, I'll mention that we were asked if we'd like to move to the window table as it became available (next to us), just as we finished our first glasses of wine.  I had been dying to ask to do so, but since we'd already dusted our table cloth with crumbs I thought, with only one waiter on duty,  it would be rude, so I was most thankful as I don't like having people close by on both sides (what can I say).  We were only asked, it was not a request, and I was thrilled.\n\nOver all, the disconnect between the expense and the level of the food puts this review at two stars.  If the plates had been $20.00, I might have been more enthusiastic.  One can hope the prices are justified by decent wages and perhaps benefits, but still, for that price I expect to be wowed and Wow! was not a word either of us uttered, all night long.", "author": "Paul T."}

What a disappointment! Our experience was poles apart from what the group said on the show. \nFrom the moment we entered, the visit was negative, with the owner/chef greeting us, in a less than friendly way. There were 5 of us, and we could see a table for 5 was already set up, but instead of seating us there, asked us to wait, and proceeded to pull tables together in a corner at the back, just beside the kitchen. I should mention that the restaurant was practically empty, so that was completely incomprehensible, and after we were sitting for a few minutes it became obvious the table was the worst in the room, and the heat from the open kitchen started to become unbearable. We asked the owner (who was waiting tables) if we could move down away from the heat, (remember the place was almost empty) he was not pleased. We were moved but very grudgingly, and were made to feel like we had really asked for something outrageous! \nWe made a couple of attempts to engage the owner in conversation, as he took our order and served us, but it quickly became apparent he was not interested in being pleasant or helpful. On his video, he mentions that he learned to cook with his grandmother and mother, and with their passion. We saw none of that, and wonder if his mother and grandmother were as unfriendly as he was, or would they be ashamed of his attitude!! \nAs for the food - 2 of us ordered the soup of the day, which was supposed to be vegetable soup, but it was so bland one could not really tell what it was, and it was served lukewarm. The French Onion soup was overdone with cheese. We each had a different entre and the consensus was the same, just ok, nothing to distinguish them from any other mediocre restaurant/bistro. \nThe attitude and the almost hostile behavior of the owner left us completely baffled and shocked. In case you might be thinking we were dressed weirdly, or behaved in an odd way, let me assure you we were just a regular family of adults out for a celebration meal, in what we had expected to be a nice bistro that had been recommended.\nMy husband and I plan on a trip to France in September and were looking forward to it, but after this experience, it really has set a negative tone to the trip. \nWe do not recommend this bistro and certainly will not be back.\nMarcella M", "author": "Marcella M."}

I moved into the neighborhood 10 years ago and must have driven by this place hundreds of times. But finally, a wrong has been righted, and my stomach was oh-so-greatly pleased by a solid and reasonbly priced dinner. \n\nI definitely recommend this place for dinner, especially if you want something cozy and different from the usual Marina/Cow Hollow commercial venues. With a pseudo-French bistro atmosphere, what appears to be a small place is suprisingly large, seating upwards of 40, and those closer the door can observe (to some extent) the action in the kitchen nearby. The bay window tables are a real treat, and there is outdoor seating for when the weather is pleasant.\n\nThe menu is suprisingly robust - lots of choices, and there's also a Prix Fixe menu - flat fee for a fixed three course meal of an appetizer (soup), entree and dessert. Tonight it was cauliflower soup, pork loin with an applekraut side and a salad, and a blissfully decadent light chocolate cake with a dreamy cream and strawberries on the side - with just the right dash of powdered sugar. And this was $14.50! You're damn skippy I was happy with this meal. :)\n\nThe Prix Fixe menu rotates, so you can keep coming back and try something different. And if you want whatever you want, you can order anything else from the menu. \n\nRecommendation: the French Onion soup is ((insert Homer Simpson drool sound effect here)). In a word, lovely! I was definitely pleased - this is one of my all-time favorite dishes, and I'm happy to have found a new favorite spot for it since my once-favorite French restaurant on Chestnut shut down years ago (it's now occupied by Ashoka, the Indian restaurant near Fillmore). \n\nI'll definitely be coming back here, and heartily recommend it to everyone. If you plan to go on a busy night, bear in mind this is a small establishment, so it will be cozy, and if it's really busy you might have to put up with a wait - it's a small kitchen and not a lot of room for staff, so be sure you're not starving when you go. We were served in a reasonble time, but it wasn't that busy (especially for a Tuesday night), so I imagine Friday and Saturday nights must be a long wait for service.\n\nBut yes, go! You'll have happy stomach and nice experience without shoveling out too much money. This place is a keeper.\n\n(FEB '08 UPDATE: Avoid going here on busy nights like Friday and Saturday - the kitchen and dining room staff get overwhelmed, service is ridiculously slow on these nights, and the prix fixe menu looks like a chef's lazy shortcut.

The restaurant is super cute and off the main Chestnut drag, right up against the Presidio. One knock against it is that the seats are not too comfortable. \n\nWe were out for a casual dinner and so asked the waiter for a wine recommendation under $40. He said the Syrah for $42 was great. For $2 more, we were very pleased with the wine. To start, we had the fresh pan seared foie gras, apple compote, and figs. AMAZING! It was so fresh and just melted in my mouth. This is an absolute must! \n\nFor my entree, I had the traditional duck leg confit, saut\u00e9ed potatoes, mushrooms with garlic & parsley, and cooked tomato. The duck fell off the bone and was so succulent. The potatoes were perfectly seasoned and so delicious. The cooked tomato was stuffed with some type of breading and baked. It was very different than anything I've had and was also very delicious. My fiance had the cassoulet (as always) and was in love. We absolutely devoured the meal and completely cleaned our plates. \n\nWe split the profiteroles for dessert. These were just okay. The chocolate sauce was amazing, but it was served just room temperature. The pastry was also cold and didn't' taste that fresh. It was still delicious, but I've had much better profiteroles. \n\nStill, we had a fantastic time and the prices are very reasonable. The menu is great and extensive.

She took our name and asked us to wait outside. OK, the restaurant is small but still, it was chilly. Over 10 minutes later, I went back inside to tell her that we would be fine sitting outside,  but that we were hungry. She said OK, but was distracted (because she was also a server).

Another server (male with a friendly smile) came over to us and asked us if we had been helped. I explained and he offered us a seat. We sat down, only to have the first server (female) apologize for the confusion and try to clean off our table for us. \n\nEventually someone who I would assume was an owner (female, dressed professionally, French speaker). She took our order  without writing anything down and was very sweet. She and her male server also helped us to push the wasp away from our table when it hovered around us. \n\nThe food was pretty good. I had an egg white omlette with Swiss cheese and onions and a decaf coffee. They did not refill the coffee until I specifically asked for it.  And then, the coffee she used to refill my cup with caffeinated. Besides that, I liked that they had Benedict options (some vegetarian) and parking was not too hard to find. I do wish though that they had had a vegan dish or two and not charged so many extra fees for the eggs. Omlette was something like 8 dollars, egg whites was an additional 1.50, cheese .75, and onions .75.  I felt nickle and dimed.

It's small and reminiscent of corner cafes in Paris neighborhoods. \n\nBut in the end it's the food that counts and I've been disppointed twice now. My first dinner there  was off the menu and so unremarkable that I \ncan't remember what I had.  \n\nOn my last visit, I chose the prix fix dinner.  At $16 it  was a \"bargain\" but the food lacked  personality or appeal.  The  chicken and potato were smothered in a tomato-based sauce and had almsot no taste; the  white pepper available at the table didn't help boast the flavor.  \nThe cheese coating on the lobster bisque was stringy,  making it  awkward to eat.  The finale was a small  white colored  gelatin- based dessert, with a faint coconut flavor.\n\nMy companion had the  steak ($24)  and said \"It was ok, nothing great.\"\n\nAnother  disappointment was the 5 oz. serving of  unexceptional wine for  $7.50.  \n\nThe cheesey American music from the 80's playing  in the background became vaguely annoying; it was certainly incongruous.  \n\nOn the positive side; the service was pleasant; the waitor served us  promptly.

(the other being A16 which is much pricier!)  The food is extraordinary, fresh and delicious with only the best local ingredients.  For those who said the service was sub-par I urge you to reconsider.  This is a true French cafe, by that I mean that when you come here you should expect that your meal is an adventure in and of itself and that you should take your time enjoying the entire process of French dining.  I think too many of us, myself included, are so used to the rush and hectic pace of the Bay Area that we simply can't enjoy food and a slower pace the way the authentic French staff at Baker Street Bistro expect people to.

Atypical of most french restaurants.  There were even families there with their kids, so as one who knows little about french cuisine, I actually liked it.\n\nBread was good, crunchy on the outiside chewy on the inside, however, they didn't bring us any bread plates so we had to use napkins.\n\nWine:  We had a glass of the house Syrah and Chardonney.  The odd thing was that if you ordered a bottle of wine, they brought you larger/thinner wine glasses, while if you ordered just a glass, they filled your the small wine glasses that were already on the table.\n\nI had a \"mixed greens salad\" and that was exactly that.  A plate of mixed greens like you'd find in a bag at the supermarket lightly coated with olive oil.  While I like mixed greens, there was nothing else in the salad and for $7, it was no worth it.\n\nDuck breast glazed, this was actually quite good, duck was very tender and flavorful.  While the duck confit appeared overdone and there were more lentils then duck.\n\nDessert:  Peach melba. The peach had the taste as if it came out of a Del Monte can with two raspberries and some cream.  For $12 they could use real peaches.  the apple tart was much better, but it really tasted like a slice of apple pie with creme fresh on top.  Not the best pie and many of the apple slices had the 'shells' that surround the seeds still on them.  Seems the cores were cut a bit to close.\n\nI'm ranking this a 2 because honestly, for the high price that we, or rather I, paid for this meal I didn't get much value out of it, nor was the food particularly amazing.  I've eaten in plenty of $50/person places and this wasn't close to delivering what I would expect for dinner.  I wanted it to work out, but there were quite a few let downs.", "author": "S M."}

The place can be considered cozy or cramped depending on your mood.  The tables are close enough where you can hear others next to you speak but it doesn't really matter unless you're trying to listen haha.  The bistro is a small little place neatly tucked off Baker St. on the neighborhood side.  The decor was nothing special but felt very warm and natural.  Although we didn't need to make reservations it definitely got busy after we came in (around 7:45).\n\nOn to the good stuff; I thought the food was great.  The service was decent to good but not great.  Our waiter did try to check up on us as often has he could but he was clearly busy with many other tables as the whole restaurant only had two waiters.  On the times he did stop by he was very nice and sincere so I'll cut him some slack.  Oh yeah, back to the food.  Everything was great.  We started off  our dinner with the French onion soup and a wild mushroom soup (puree).  Both soups were great.  The French onion had a nice rich broth with plenty of onions and was topped with piece of bread and slice of gruyere all melted and bubbly from the oven.  It was served in a nice little miniature crock pot which was a nice touch.  For our entrees we had the crusted seared sea bass and the seafood stew (cioppino like) served with a vegetable risotto.  Both dishes were great except for the side of risotto which tasted a bit undercooked. We washed everything down with 2 glasses of bordeaux.

The food is great and the casual French menu and relaxed atmosphere make for a nice date spot or friendly night out in the neighborhood. They have a great fixed price menu (at last check $16.50 for four courses) and brunch is outstanding - seriously try the french toast. \n\nUnfortunately they just can't get the service down (trying to be a little too French?). It is the reason I have to hold back on the making this a four-star review. It seems like they just don't know the basics of serving a table. Across the board they lack the little things: asking for a drink order when approaching the table, checking in on tables, refilling drinks and being friendly. \n\nThe service isn't terrible, but it leaves a lot to be desired. Eventually it was the reason we stopped going there for our weekly dinners and primarily just hit it up for brunch or the occasional dinner.

Approaching the restaurant, you would know immediately it was a French bistro.  The exterior reminded me very much of the Art Deco style of all Metropolitan station entrances in Paris and many Parisian hotels, complete with elegant chairs and tables in the patio for outside dining (on warmer days).  The interior was warm, cozy, with many touches again of French decors and fabrics.  The friendly host and head chef came to chat with us at our table.  We felt instantly welcomed.  But the best part was the food itself.  The menu was a comprehensive map of France itself with so many authentic items to choose from.  The price was shockingly reasonable for a French restaurant.  The four of us ordered different dishes and appetizers, and each dish was impeccable!  The portion was just sufficient yet not offensively large as in many typical American restaurants.  The desserts were perfect and exquisite, as you would expect a French dessert to be.  The servers and the host knew when to check in and socialize with us and when to leave us to our food and conversations.  We had a wonderful time (for a very small price).  We would definitely bring more friends back here for dinner, lunch or brunch.  Baker St Bistro is a gem in a city that's only second to New York City in the number of restaurants.  You get honest, good, authentic French food at neighborhood-bistro prices in a beautiful ambiance among friendly, pleasant staff and patrons.  I highly recommend Baker St. Bistro.

The soup in the mussel dish was good, however too sweet for my taste and not warm enough. Plus, it's not very good if you dip the fries in the soup, try dipping the bread instead. I just don't understand. I mean the ambiance was nice, I felt like I was really eating at a bistro in France (even though I've never been to France, but it just felt like it).

The leek added a real frenchy taste to this dish.  Our entries were rack of lamb and steak.  Chef Danel is really  an expert at searing meat. Lamb was seasoned perfectly with rosemary and cooked to perfection. There was the crispy crunch from the searing of the meat with herb, then the meat inside is juicy, tender and full of flavor.

Yeah, you might think this sounds crazy, but I am not kidding. Okay so now that I have your attention, I will tell you about our night......we walk in and the place is looking super cute...not totally full and they tried to give us this table in the corner----but nobody puts baby in a corner!!!!!!! anywho, so we ask for the booth, which they gladly gave us. All is well, and we have fabu glasses of champagne and a nice cheese platter, and THEN, they ask us to move to that f-ing corner table! but they promise us free wine and dessert--a deal we can't pass up. So, we move. Let's just say that the night went downhill from here. We proceeded to wait and wait and wait for some semblance of service, but all we really got was bumped up against, ignored, menus dropped on us, and water glasses left empty....not ideal. then, as we were waiting for our entrees,  they offered us dessert, perfect timing if you ask me ( I'm being sarcastic). After that they tried to serve us the wrong entrees...finally we got the right entrees and just as we were beginning to enjoy our meals, a waiter was walking by with plates he had just cleared and a freaking dirty fish knife dropped onto my coat, and fell into the back of my pants, slipping right into my ass crack...perfect spot for a dirty fish knife, right? Ughhh! kill me. so not my idea of a nice night out! anyway, we already had free dessert and wine, so what else could they do for us? Well maybe they just gave up because they sure seemed to stop trying to make it better. You would think after a dirty knife goes into your ass, they would try to make nice, but NO, not these peeps. I really think that they are good people, but I am just not sure what happened. I mean come on! anyway, our free dessert came, but oddly we had no choice in what type of dessert we got. As we watched the next table over reading their dessert menus, we ate out preselected flan, which I personally don't like. the waitress, however informed me that \"everyone likes flan\" I said, well I don't. she brought choc cake. whoopdie doo. whatever it is hard to recover from being fish knifed in the butt.

Some decent things, but mostly mediocre. For ex., each meat dish was cooked wrong--- supposed to be medium rare for the lamb and duck. Each was medium to medium well; supposed to be rare for the steak, but was raw/not even a warm center. In addition, wine prices are EXPLOITIVE.  No bottles for less than $35 and bottles that go for $10 - $20 a bottle were going for minimum of $9 a glass. In such small glasses, this is a 300 - 600 % markup! Many clearly better restaurants have wines at $30 or less. And the service--- we were sitting at a table at which the busboy and waiter could have easily gone to the other side to collect plates, but they asked us to pass them over. Even a server at Denny's wouldn't do that! And why couldn't the waiter tell the busboy where the 1 cappucino went? Our conversation was  interrupted each time they had to deliver something. Who is managing this place?", "author": "randy b."}

The food was fabulous, the presentation delightful and I think people are raving more about the breakfast than the actual wedding!   Thankfully the day was gorgeous so we could take advantage of the outdoor seating.  Baker St Bistro is a fabulous restaurant for any occasion and I am so glad the staff could be part of my wedding weekend!", "author": "Marina A."}

The food and wine list are also excellent and the service is attentive, accomodating, and authentic.  I felt I was being served by people who were truly interested in our having a nice dinner.  Small and cozy ... this place truly reminds me of a Parisian cafe.", "author": "Jen L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2009-06-29", "description": "I want to give this place a better rating because i think the food is pretty good and the service is decent considering it is a french place,  but I found the ambiance/atmosphere really lacking.\n\nIt is not anything like a street cafe in Paris. Don't be deceived by the quaint yelp picture with christmas lights and outdoor seating. The restaurant is located on a residential street so there is nothing to see nearby (no people, no other stores, just apts and parked cars). Definitely not the same lively, bustling, people- watching paris street cafe feel. The interior also needs some remodeling. I noticed some of the seat cushions are ripped and the menus don't look very clean. There was also a huge wasp-bee flying around that kept on bothering us until a waiter killed it. Also, I came around 7:30 pm on a Fri night and there was only one other group there. Not sure if it was just a slow night, but it definitely took away from the atmosphere. I did notice more people coming after 8:00 pm, but considering the overall high reviews, i thought this place would be more popular. I think maybe it is more of  a brunch place.", "author": "chrissie s."}

Worth going here once in a group and trying all the dishes, but since their menu rarely changes, once is enough. Move on. Try another restaurant (plentiful in SF!).", "author": "Cary W."}

We've been here for dinner twice, and twice we made reservations well in advance only to find that they had no record of our reservations, both times.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2007-12-21", "description": "My second visit was last night.  This is a cozy little Bistro off the beaten path of Cow Hollow.  My wife and I both had the Prix Fixe dinner and it was excellent.  1st course was a Cream of Wild Mushroom soup that was outstanding.  Tasty, good portion--could have made a meal of it.  Following that came a little green salad--simple butter lettuce and a light dressing.  The main course was Baby Back Ribs in a tasty sauce with a lentil ragout.  Good portion, tasty, done perfect.  For dessert we had a Bread Pudding in a rum type sauce with strawberries and whipped cream.  The cost of this meal wa $16.50 and it was delicious.  The people next to us ordered from the regular menu and one had a lamb steak and the other a chicken breast.  Both looked good and were generous portions.  Service was very good.  For a neighborhood bistro this is a 5 star place.  We will go again.", "author": "Wayne E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-08-14", "description": "This modest, out-of-the-way Bistro is a real find.  I trek all the way from the East Bay to enjoy its laidback atmosphere and tasty offerings - which come at totally reasonable prices.  On the weekends, when most brunch spots are overrun and have waits of over an hour, BSB seems always to have a table available - and this is not because of poor quality.  I just think it's not that well known or as faddish as other places.  There's outdoor seating to enjoy when the smallish interior gets too crowded.  I always order the bouillabase - subtle, red fishy broth, tender scallops and other goodies, topped with a perfectly toasted slice of baguette and pepper aioli.  The other week, my family and I also tried the risotto for a late brunch - it came speckled with squash, beet, and sundried tomatoes - a perfect summertime dish.  It was delicious - not too mushy or overrun with ingredients.  The fluffy french toast is also an excellent standby.  As for the service, there are several attentive and friendly waiters to assist.  The owner also frequently emerges from the back to shmooze with regulars and newcomers alike. (I did find it strange when he chose to dump along the street a bucketful of dirty washwater just outside his place - bad choice!).  The only drawback I see for this place, besides its somewhat remote location over by the Presidio, is its espresso drinks.  They just aren't that strong or flavorful.  I like my cappuccinos dry and theirs was decidedly weak.  Alas, I will return in spite of that.  Again and again.  Sitting outside, with a mellow breeze and fog blowing over, with its quiet atmosphere, gives me images of being at a lazy brasserie in France.", "author": "David S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-06", "description": "Went to Baker Street Bistro on the recommendation of someone who lives in the area. French bistro cuisine is one of my favorites, so on my birthday, my wife, daughter and I had to give it a try. At best it was just okay. The ambiance and decor are warm and inviting. The service is friendly and sharp. Our only complaint is the food wasn't so great. I started with the salad with smoked duck, duck gizzard and foie gras. The smoked duck had no smoke flavor, the gizzard was like jerky, but the foie gras was good. The \"Julia Child\" beef bourginon was salty, the beef was dried out and the sauce lacked complexity. Simply one note flavor like canned stew but WAY saltier than canned. My wife's duck a l'orange was very good. It was served with polenta cakes and she does not like polenta. She asked if she could substitute any other sort of starch and it was made clear that there are \"no substitutions\" as stated at the bottom of the menu. These days, I would think restaurants would be a little more accommodating with a SIMPLE request like a side starch substitution. My daughter's steak was just that, a steak with fries and a small side of vinaigrette salad. Nothing special. Sad to say, but \"you can get that anywhere\". We did not partake of the desserts. We frequent Chouchou in the forest hill neighborhood and can say that, by comparison, there is no comparison.  Chouchou is our favorite.  We will probably still return to Baker Street Bistro for another try in the summer for some outdoor sidewalk dining.  We always give it a couple of trys.", "author": "Andrew L."}

This charming tiny restaurant is a find and worth driving clear across the City in the rain to  get to it which we had to do.  This is the second time we have been there and it was just as delightful but even more so because we had the prix  fixe menu.  I thought I was reading the menu wrong when it said $16.50 for a four course dinner.  I read it again and yes it was true from I think 5:30 to 7:00, I am not sure of the days but we were their on a Friday night at 6:30 so it worked for us.  The spinach soup was delicious and not just a cup of it but a bowl.  A lightly dressed salad accompanied the delicious boned trout in a nice butter sauce with sliced almonds and rice.  This was then followed by dessert which I assumed would be a dish of ice cream considering the price of the dinner and the full size servings of each course.  But to my happy amazement the dessert was a wonderful brownie like cake garnished with a strawberry and resting on a delightful sauce.  Some of the entrees go for about $18.00 which is still reasonable  but then when you think a four course for $16.50 it is unbelievable.  And to top all that off the waiters are nice, efficient and unassuming.  I much prefer this restaurant to one that charges high prices, gives attitude and bad service and then dismal food .  I can hardly wait to go again and pretend I am in Paris at a fabulous  little charming restaurant that I was so lucky to find.", "author": "Sally F."}
