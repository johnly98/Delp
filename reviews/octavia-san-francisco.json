A huge portion (yes, I understand that petit filet is from higher up on the loin).  And delicious - much more flavor that filet mignon, and accompanied by a corn preparation which was superb!\nDessert:  we had a toasted angel food cake with sweet corn ice cream which was simply marvelous!

The restaurant is located in a very quaint neighborhood, and the restaurant looks like the front of a home. I loved the ambiance of the candle-lit restaurant, and the homey feels. \n\nWe decided to do the tasting menu, which I thought would be a great way to try a few items on their menu. We started off with the levain bread baked in house, and it was some of the best bread I have had! The crust was perfectly crunchy, crispy and smoky, and the bread itself was soft and pillowy. They also gave us these savory cream puffs ( I think?), but they were super light and a great way to start the meal. There were also a lot of salads involved with the tasting menu, and also a crudo that was most memorable. The entrees included a fish and a sliced steak plate, and both were very good. The fish was very tender, and the steak was cooked perfectly to a tender, medium rare. The desserts were a chocolate pudding and a pavlova. The pavlova wasn't as special, but the chocolate pudding was very good and very rich with chocolate flavor.\n\nOverall a very cute place for a date or a birthday celebration! This was a rather light tasting menu, with most of the courses being heavy on the salads, but otherwise, beautiful presentations!", "author": "Sandra S."}

Took my friend here for her birthday, we each got a deviled egg, which is more like spiced sous vide egg...wasn't so great. However, the heirloom tomato salad with homemade cheese compensated for it, and it was one of the absolute best salads I've ever had. All the cheese and flavor falls into a layer of faro and it was phenomenal. We also got the house sourdough bread which was definiitely a 10/10 as far as breads go. \n\nFor our main we shared a sliced, \"Wagyu\" steak, which was perfectly cooked and tasty, but nothing special. The dessert was ridiculous and nothing like I expected, withmeringuee, ice cream, roasted pears...great.\n\nAs noted, service was great, water glasses full, always around. Place had a nice ambiance, was full and nice. Would return. Spent around $100 for 2 with 1 drink.", "author": "Jordan C."}

Wagyu beef (cooked to perfection), salmon (with amazing crispy skin), halibut crudo (had never had this before and it was so light and fresh), shrimp pasta (loved the little crunchies on top)\n\nLowlights: Eating too much bread at the beginning!! Probably contributed to being so full by the end of the meal. Also, the deviled egg was actually a boiled egg with a runny yolk. It was still delicious but not exactly what we were expecting, as we were really looking forward to a gourmet deviled egg.\n\nThe service was also excellent. Our waiter was very helpful, attentive, and friendly. Each person who brought a course out described it in detail. \n\nWe both said we would love to come back to Octavia again - either to try another one of their blind tastings or to just get a taste of some of the other dishes their menu has to offer.", "author": "Jessie K."}

For my 3800th review, one-starred Octavia is well worth the honors.\n\nI had the pleasure of dining with a fun group of folks, all of whom opted for the $70 tasting menu. This is an amazing deal given how much you're getting; the entrees alone, on an a la carte basis, are priced in the mid-$30s. It's all the more amazing given that it's not uncommon to spend twice as much on food alone at one-star Michelin establishments here in the Bay Area these days.\n\nWe started with Octavia's take on a deviled egg. Absolutely savory and delicious, and what a way to begin a meal on an already-filling note. We were also served helpings of their house-baked levain bread, complete with warm butter. Soooo fresh and sooo good. On a normal day when I'm not pigging out, this could be a meal in and of itself. Of course, we kept asking for more, please!\n\nIf this wasn't enough carbs already, we were also presented with a dish of gougeres (fancy cheese puffs for the uninitiated) to share. Cue up foodgasmic squeals of delight all around, Meg Ryan-style in \"When Harry Met Sally.\"\n\nNext came a series of dishes ranging from sashimi to salad to salmon to steak. Even if these were tasting-sized, as opposed to full entree-sized, we'd have already passed the $70 mark in value halfway through. So much substance and so much enjoyment throughout. And as if all this wasn't enough, we chose two desserts: the warm chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart with salted caramel ice cream (ZOMG!!!) and some profiteroles. \n\nWe were beyond floored with the value and variety we got by choosing the tasting menu. It was truly a Michelin-worthy dining experience and I'm all WTF at some of the middling reviews here. The service managed to be professional and casual at the same time, and the entire experience was an approachable family-style affair over quality dishes. So, folks, leave your sour grapes at the door and just enjoy an evening's worth of conversation with a good group of folks. A job well done, Octavia!", "author": "Vincent L."}

The interior features beige walls, with wooden tables, dark shelves and chairs, earthy decorations, and unique plants. I noticed that our courses came mostly on dark plates during the daylight, and on light plates after dark. Perhaps coincidence, but the contrast was great for pictures.\n\nI came here for a belated birthday celebration in June 2017. The person I was seeing at the time let me pick the restaurant, and I realized I had this one bookmarked for over two years, ever since I watched a segment on Chef Melissa Perello.\n\nI wasn't fully aware of their tasting menu until we arrived, and my date and I were both excited to try that.\n\nThe tasting menu is ~$80, and consists of ten courses. These include six light courses, two main courses, and two desserts. Warm, fresh bread is also served with salted butter, and it certainly makes you eye the '$8 loaf to-go' line on the menu.\n\nTheir deviled egg is the most unique I've ever had! After having a few drinks prior, I was glad to start the tasting menu with a little spice. \n\nThe anchovies we were served here were the first I had ever tried. I don't know if I like anchovies in general or if they were just great here, but the latter they certainly were. The salty fish paired with the cream on crunchy chips provided a great blend of flavors and textures.\n\nI must say the the dish that was most surprising, and thus my favorite, was the corn custard. It's incredibly unassuming, and after receiving the fresh, colorful dishes that preceded it, I felt a little let down. Corn custard? I won't spoil it...you'll know what I mean when you try it.\n\nThe main dishes were cooked well, and also had a good blend of powerful flavors. A couple weeks before we came here I had started eating red meat again after about 9 months of passing it up, so the flavors of meat were exciting again.\n\nThe desserts were delicious, and of course, my second favorite part of the meal. I love the combinations here, and I felt the same amount of guilt eating their ice cream and berries as I did their ice cream and cake--none.\n\nThe service was slow, but it was pleasant and our server was knowledgeable and kind. The ambiance was likewise pleasant, and nothing seemed out of place.\n\nOctavia made my belated twenty-second birthday celebration special, and I will never forget that experience.", "author": "Colby D."}

One of my favorite parts is that we never had one specific waiter. The staff was very well organized and customer service was their number one priority. Their job was to serve you when you need it. \n\nThe food was out of this world. The bread was crisp on the outside, warm and fluffy on the inside. I would recommend trying the deviled egg. This was a new take and the egg was cooked so perfectly. The fat from the yolk mixed with the spices creates fireworks in your mouth. \n\nDesert was no and after thought.

Both I've heard are delicious and special in their own little ways. After combing through the menu online, many \"ooh's\" and \"aah's\" later (mostly from me), and taking into consideration location of post dinner plans, we decided to dine at Octavia. I also knew which three desserts I wanted prior to getting to dinner. \n\nWe started off with bread (so good you have to get this! Get two!), the chilled squid ink noodles and much raved about \"deviled egg\". The quotes imply it's not really deviled (because deviled eggs have a hard yolk). The egg is actually beautifully yolky and was delicious nonetheless. If you order the bread, this is a good time to eat it, slathering butter all over it and sopping up the sunshine on your plate. \n\nMoving on to dinner, we ordered the Day boat scallops, and Sonoma duck breast & sausage. I loved everything about the scallop dish. Absolutely everything was perfect. The flavors were well balanced, it had enough texture variance, and of course it was delicious.   \n\nSince I don't eat pork, I had a small bite of duck which was a tad gamey but still really good. \n\nNow on to dessert. I knew which three I wanted and when I asked the waiter for which his favorite was he mentioned they were all good (of course) which made it even harder to choose. He seemed a little judgey that I was going to order three desserts (eh, ain't no thang) so I went with two and decided to get a third if I still wanted it (of course I still want it but decided against the third later, lol). \n\nWe went with the Wildflower Honey crumb pudding and Winter spice profiteroles. Of the two, we enjoyed the honey crumb pudding much more than the profiteroles. \n\nI probably would skip the profiteroles next time. I found the ice cream to profiterole ratio to be quite aggressive and didn't think there was enough miso caramel to balance the dessert. \n\nFood coma ensues. \n\nPost dinner plans you ask? Yeah about that...\n\nAnyways, wonderful experience overall, delicious food, and cozy little restaurant totally deserving of a Michelin Star. \n\nIt's very unassuming from the outside, don't pass it up!", "author": "Shereen A."}

I also had some really wonderful meals in the restaurant that occupied the space before her. \n\nThe food is gorgeous. Everything comes out looking like a mini work of art. My favorite dish, just based on aesthetics, was the blueberry parfait. It looked like an Easter egg, with delicate, brightly colored flowers scattered above a cloud of house-made yogurt. It tasted good too. Not too sweet, but complex enough and satisfying enough to end the meal right. My favorite dish, just based on flavors, was the sweet onion soup. They served it in two stages. It comes with the morels,cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche and other yummy things already in the bowl, then they slowly pour the warm soup over it all. This creamy rich soup is fragrant an soothing. It was definitely a good choice. Everything we had contained at least one kind of vegetable, even my oyster. They were all super fresh and very high quality. So much so, everything was bursting with flavor. They really know how to develop a flavor profile at Octavia.\n\nService was good. They take a team approach. Everyone who we had contact with (there were at least four) was pleasant and efficient). They also seemed to pace things really well. I never felt rushed.\n\nOctavia is not large. It manages to be intimate and cozy without feeling too closed in. Even though other tables are close, you feel like you have your own space.\n\nSo why not five stars? I'm not being picky when I say this. Octavia didn't wow me. It was an all together a good experience. Everything was solid across the board. Octavia met all expectations, but I didn't leave wishing for more.\n\nI can still remember the joy my first dining experience at Frances was. Once we finally snagged a reservation, we had heard all the hype, and it still far exceeded expectations. Everything was delicious.

The first thing I noticed unfortunately was a faint smell of burning oil. It wasn't extremely strong but also not pleasant especially for a restaurant of this calibre. This may have been a byproduct of a hot day, poor ventilation and the open kitchen concept. \n\nMy first impression was how expensive their wine list was. It wasn't surprising that quite a few tables brought their own bottles. \n\nHomemade bread is probably the best I have ever tasted!! Definitely get this. \n\nDeviled egg is an og on the menu. As others have mentioned, it's not your traditional prep. You get a whole egg that's a bit runny and sprinkled with spices. It was good with a nice spicy kick! \n\nWe also got a pasta dish that came highly recommended. The pasta was a bit over cooked but I loved the zucchini and other vegetables. \n\nWe ended with a sharing a petite sirloin medium rare. It was very good with interesting texture that almost seemed more rubbery like duck. \n\nThe service was friendly and helpful especially when choosing dishes from the menu but the timing of dishes is horrendous. We would sit for 20 min at a time between courses. Even before our last course came out, I was ready to go home and go to bed. It felt like we were there for hours when the meal could've been finished within 90 min max. \n\nOverall, it was a nice meal with good service but the food quality and variety wasn't what I would expect for a Michelin restaurant.

I was predisposed to love Octavia. \n\nTempting as it sounded, we declined their 9-course blind tasting menu in lieu of our own \"tasting\" menu of sorts. We shared the Eggplant Soup which was sufficiently smokey, & the Squash & Blossoms which uniquely showcased the vegetable. The Deviled Egg was spicy on the outside & soft on the inside from being cooked gently; & still whole rather than halved. I didn't try his Trout appetizer. \n\nFor our mains, he chose a medium-rare Filet & I had Dumplings with a cremini mushroom sauce & plenty of veggies like bitter greens, onions, & peppers. \n\nDessert was Angel Food Cake with blackberries & corn ice cream. The cake had a sugary, crunchy br\u00fbl\u00e9e on top. \n\nEverything we tried was prepared in an unexpected way but never at the expense of taste; these unique twists made sense & wasn't done simply for the sake of being inventive. I think both meat & non-meat eaters would be happy here; my vegetarian dishes were brimming with exciting textures & wonderful flavors. \n\nThe icing on the cake of an already 5-star experience was our delightful waitress who made great suggestions & made us feel at home.

This restaurant is one of those \"silent yet brilliant\" types which just passes under the radar. Not as well-known as HOPR (House Of Prime Rib) or as \"instafamous\" as Mr. Holmes Bakehouse, they still managed to snag a coveted Michelin Star. \n\nOctavia is located on.....where else? Octavia Street in the Lower Pacific Heights area of San Francisco. It's fairly close to Japantown. There's plenty of street parking around the area. It's also only a couple of blocks from Fillmore Street which is good for shopping with all its good boutique shops. \n\nUpon walking into the space, I was immediately impressed with the beauty and professionalism of the restaurant. (As one would expect from a Michelin Starred place.) The ambiance is dim and cozy. This seems like the perfect place for dates. The open kitchen adds a modern tone to the space as does their Nest thermostat! (That's the first time I've seen a restaurant with a Nest. The geek in me was highly impressed.) Our server was polite yet not overly suffocating. We ordered 3 dishes to try and opted out of dessert because we just gobbled up half a cheesecake earlier. (Oh the agony of saving space for even more gluttony to come.)\n\nGrilled Monterey Squid : This was a really good appetizer to share. The amount was good enough to share between two people. It doesn't say in the description on the menu, but this dish is quite spicy. I drank two glasses of water while finishing this. I have to say the butter beans were the star of this dish. They were crispy on the outside while still soft on the inside. We totally inhaled those beans!\n\nWild Nettle Tagliatelle : This was a good pasta dish if you love tagliatelle. The egg yolk mixed with the green pasta was perfect. \n\nPetit Filet : This is a great meat dish for those of you who like Filet Mignon.

When I tried making a res for 3, the only options were for super late dinners (think 10:30 pm). But if you make a res far enough in advance (over a week in advance), you should be fine. \n\nFirst off, this restaurant is gorgeous. I love that you can see into the kitchen, and see all the chefs working. The ambiance is really great, too. They have the perfect music selection. The whole look of this restaurant ties in with the food. Everything is modern and elegant. \n\nFor starters, we had the levain with butter and deviled eggs. The deviled eggs are pretty much soft boiled eggs. The levain was really good, and the butter defied gravity. For my main entree, I had the petit filet, which came with green beans and a cauliflower pur\u00e9e. Everything was cooked perfectly, and the seasoning was just right. I was disappointed with the desserts, though. I tried the honey crumble pudding and the profiteroles. The desserts were on the dry side, and I like my desserts sweeter.", "author": "Rachel H."}

We couldn't get enough of it. We wanted more. So damn good. The Deviled Egg was spicier than anticipated but good. The Squid Ink Pasta didn't necessarily wow me, but it good nonetheless. Now the Petit Filets were perfectly cooked. I had zero complaints. I was surprised by the portion. Worth every penny. The filet literally melted in my mouth. Mmmm.\n\nWe topped off dinner with a tiny birthday cupcake, angel food cake, and some tea. Overall, our experience at Octavia was one to rave about.

Octavia met all of my expectations and then some!\n\nI've had them bookmarked for ages and finally got the chance when my friend came in from out of town wanting to eat something fancy.  We were going through the menu picking out about 5 dishes to order when our server same to the table to tell us about the specials.  That night they had a 10 course tasting for only $70 so our previous order went right out the window.  All the food that came out was exactly what I had been planning to order plus some spectacular mains and desserts.\n\nOur menu from 12/2/17:\n-Baked Levain: daaaayum this bread was so good, a must-order!!\n-Deviled Egg: not too impressed, a soft boiled egg with some hot cheeto dust would've tasted the same\n-Chilled Squid Ink Noodles: super light and refreshing\n-Dungeness Crab Toast: like high end crab and artichoke dip, my friend's favorite dish\n-Chicory Salad: dressing was a little strong, but balanced by grilled persimmon\n-Tagliatelle: great balance of flavors and textures\n-Petit Filet: steak is never a bad idea\n-Scallops: perfectly seared \n-Toasted Angel Food Cake: came with an amazing roasted squash ice cream, like pumpkin x10\n-Mint & Cocoa Eton Mess: loved the crunch in this dish, both desserts were amazing\n\nOn top of the great food, our server was super attentive and gracious.  I love it when your server is just as excited about your meal as you are (maybe more, in this case).  The one thing that happened that might have put a damper on my night was they took the leftover bread I was planning to take home away from the table.  By the time I realized what happened (dramatic \"Noooooo!\" with an arm outstretched, many people staring), he'd already made it to the back kitchen and threw it away.  Distraught, I told another server about what had just transpired.  I didn't really hear anything back from either of them, so I sulked about bread all through dessert.  When the check came, our server casually slides a brown bag across the table, \"And here's your extra bread.\"  Bless you my fine dining dinner night's savior!!\n\nTips and Tricks\n-TL:DR eat here, it is delicious and worth every penny\n-Get!! That!! Bread!!!!\n-If you want a weekend table, you should book a couple weeks in advance\n-Do not skip on dessert\n-We found street parking on Octavia 1 block down", "author": "Jessica L."}

I went with a group of 4 and we ordered most of the items on the menu. We asked about a tasting menu but its not available all the time, which was okay because everything was delicious. If they do have one later, I'm first in line to come back. \n\nTotally forgot the name of our waiter but he was great. All my friends and I love to food and we also love to capture the best photo of our food too. He was super nice and understanding. Thank you! We got the table by the windows, perfect lighting. The interior is very warm and comforting. Love the wide open kitchen.\n\nWe started with the house made bread with cultured butterorligurian olive oil. Yum! The bread was warm and soft with a crust on the outside. The butter was really good. We also got a bottle of red wine. \n\nDeviled Egg - We had two orders. Cooked perfectly. It's rich, I think ordering one myself would have been too much. \nSmoked mushroom 'POZOLE,' hominy, maitake, lime cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche, popcorn - This is a soup. My friends said the popcorn and wanted to order but not knowing it was soup. They were so nice to split the soup for us in 2 settings. Great service again. \nGrilled CALAMARI - Was my favorite small/appertizer dish. Flavors on full blast. I can eat that everyday. Made with green farro, pancetta, sugar snap pea, kimchi, cilantro & mint. Wow!! Might have been my favorite dish all around too. \nKale Salad - Toasted in hazelnut, aged parmesan, pickled fennel, strawberry. - I'm the biggest fan of kale but the dressing and strawberries was a great touch. Refreshing. \nHouse Ricotta TORTELLINI. A lot of flavor. The cheese was sound but I think the top part of the tortellini was a little hard.\n\nPetit Filet - YUM! The beef was cook perfectly. Very tender and not over seasoned.\nSeared Alaskan Halibut. Cooked with artichoke, fava beans and greens. The smokey saffron broth was yummy. Great add to the halibut but this might have been my least favorite entree. \nGrilled Pork Chop might have been the WINNER of the entrees. I am not the biggest pork chip girl but the brooks cherry, caraway sauerkraut, cipollini, mustard seed mixed together, gives it the best pork chop. It was amazing.\n\nWe shared dessert. Got the Wildflower Honey CRUMB PUDDING. Goes great with the                          cr\u00e8me fra\u012bche, brooks cherry, honey toffee. Not too sweet which was perfect for us.

On a recent visit to SF, we made late dinner reservations at Octavia.  First, the menu looked interesting and adventurous.  Second, the ambiance seemed modern yet comfortable.  Third, the reviews and the chef both sounded great.\n\nOur server was very nice and somewhat helpful with the wine.  I didn't love the wine selection, since there were quite a few drier red wines by the glass (and I wanted something a little fruitier).\n\nThe food was great overall.  The house baked bread was wonderful (they gave us butter instead of the olive oil we asked for) and worth getting if you are really hungry.  We also just had to try to Deviled Egg since it's so unique!  My bf cracked his open first and it just melted right out, but mine didn't do the same and was slightly overcooked (it was gooey and tasty, but the yolk didn't run).  Next we moved onto the Little Gem salad and the Tagliatelle.  Both are completely worth ordering and both had a little crunch on top for unique texture and flavor.  The steak was also delicious, as well as the ending of Chocolate Souffle Tart.\n\nAll around, a great dining experience if you're looking to taste unique chef creations.  One other thing I completely appreciate about this place is that the chef was in the kitchen.  Sometimes they are in the back or off doing something else, but she was literally overseeing every plate that went out of that kitchen.  To me, that's a sign that I can recommend this place to others and they will have the same great meal as I did.", "author": "Jeannine S."}

When dining with old friends, we sometime wonder how we first met. For us, it was because we both dated the same boy. At the time, he lived around here with a fancy math undergraduate degree at Stanford followed by MIT Sloan. We were smitten initially but when he stopped being interesting, we ditched him and the two of us continued our tradition of eating good food.\n\nOctavia is a Michelin that offered non prix fixe menu, which is fantastic. It offered small bites with the prettiest presentation. We went for the fish and the deviled soft boiled egg. Bread was delicious. Because I'm currently on a diet - sugar free and carb free, I was hesitant at first but was seduced by the beautiful dark bread it served up. I cheated. I had a slice smeared with butter. Squid pasta with more egg and kale salad followed. Unbelievable salad. She then ordered another pasta dish (just kill me now already - the diet at that point has gone out of the window). She then asked for the duck entree - which turns out to be a substantial portion. We doggie bagged it. Finally dessert. There are quite a few excellent ones to choose from. She ordered two without even consulting me. I think she just wanted dessert as where she is from there isn't any. She's now moved far and far away in Southern India running an orphanage, and only comes back every six months. Octavia has it all - everything on the menu was terrific.\n\nThis is a fabulous place to hang out. I think a reservation is always a good idea but you can walk in if you show up before 6. I'd like to think Baker & Banker was good, but Octavia really takes it up a notch.", "author": "Victoria E."}

On the 2017 SF Chronicle's 100 Best Restaurants List.\n\nWith these accolades, I had high expectations for my recent dinner at Octavia. Sadly, both the food and service were disappointing. I made reservations a couple weeks in advance, and they only had a 9:00pm slot left for a Saturday night. It was still busy when we arrived, but there were a few other tables available at that time. There aren't a lot of tables in this restaurant, so reservations are highly recommended. We were seated right away, and I tried:\n\n-Deviled Egg (Dolcini Farm Egg, Fresno Chili Relish, Marash Pepper, Spice, $5, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=uF3DbuzfyJ5FlBqoeo3zTA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=E2yNcLVPSA534-GzYBR72w&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Super bland, and only slightly reminiscent of a deviled egg. The egg was cooked perfectly for a soft boiled egg, but I didn't think the other components to this dish were flavorful- skip!\n-Chilled Squid Ink Noodles (Cortez Bottarga, Fennel Vinaigrette, Lemon Argrumato, $7, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=iMKjDPyXSF-uO9DnfflAnQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The texture of the noodles was great, and I loved the al dente chewiness and lemon flavor. However, this dish needed more salt, and the bottarga and fennel combination didn't do anything for me. I probably wouldn't get this again.\n-Baby Eggplant (Cucumber, Watercress, Sesame Labneh, Toasted Seeds, Lime, Mint, $14, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=M39vQFdountfRfyMDHVPIQ&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- this was one of my favorite dishes from the meal. The eggplant had an awesome char, and was cooked perfectly. I loved the way all the flavors in this dish worked together, and just wished they had more eggplant versus cucumber. Highly recommended!\n-Wild Nettle Tagliatelle (Bacon, Egg Yolk, Green Peppercorn, Parmesan, Pangrattato, $18, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=kzCeNtMcI9LownoQzwLSkw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): The fresh tagliatelle was great, but tasted bland to me. I also didn't like the bacon bits and would have preferred larger pieces of bacon- skip!\n-Sarah's House Baked Levain (Purple Barley, Black Sesame, Dark Rye, $2, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=0pR5iWQ4dEio0BjBIgPNTg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): I didn't like this- the grains/flavors didn't work for me. Skip!\n-Bone In Ribeye (Served w/Daikon Pickled in Ponzu, Ponzu BBQ Sauce, Porcini Mushroom Butter, Red Pepper Aioli?, $100, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LNe0gt4wgMgnaahwPF6qVw&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg, https://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=5jSNvVikF0V0aoFnJXMbmA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): We were all super excited to hear that the rib eye was available that night as an additional entree off the menu. We ordered this for an entree to split, and were looking forward to our steak. We waited, and waited, and waited. After finishing our other plates and sitting there for at least 20 minutes, we flagged down our server to follow up on our order. At that point, he explained that the steak takes 45 minutes to prepare since it's a thick cut. Uh, thanks for telling us that AFTER the fact- it was really lucky that for once we weren't rushing to get somewhere by a certain time. He went to check in the kitchen and assured us our steak was coming out next. 5 minutes later he brought us warm plates so that our cold plates wouldn't cool off the hot steak too quickly. 10 minutes after that, we finally get our steak, and our plates are cold. The most frustrating part about this whole situation is that our $100 steak was UNDERCOOKED. We ordered it medium rare, and the steak came out mostly rare. I don't mind my steak rare, but my friends had to send it back. There was no apology from our server, or acknowledgement that the steak was undercooked. The steak itself was really good, and we loved the flavorful crust as well as the great sear. However, we didn't care for the sauces since they were too salty. The butter didn't have much flavor, and the pickled daikon was so salty and tart that it was difficult to eat. \n\nI should have asked to speak to the manager about our steak, instead of leaving the meal unhappy and disappointed. I was just shocked that a restaurant of Octavia's caliber would have such a terrible server who doesn't know how to communicate a 45 minute cooking time, nor how to apologize for a long wait time for an entree, nor how to acknowledge/apologize for an undercooked steak. I will never be back to Octavia, and hope this review saves others from possibly missing any events due to waiting for their ribeye.", "author": "Amy D."}

The menu is split into small bites, smaller plates for sharing, and then larger entrees. Our server recommended about 2 large entrees, three small plates, and three small bites for our group of three. I can't remember a few of the dishes given my stomach moves faster than my brain, but here are the ones that left an impression: \n\nDeviled Egg - Highly recommend - I don't normally like deviled eggs but this one had a very unique flavor. \nChilled Squid Ink Noodles - My favorite small plate, great al dente noodles. Highly recommend!  \nAvocado Salad - I really enjoyed this dish, the vegetables and flavor combination left my mouth feeling very fresh.\nGrilled Calamari - This was ok. I didn't really like the texture of grilled calamari but wanted to give it a try. Would recommend picking a different dish. \nTortellini Dish - Can't remember the exact name of this dish, but this one was my favorite of the group! Great flavors and extremely well made pasta. \nAlaskan Halibut - The fish was extremely well cooked but I didn't find anything super special with the dish. However, great alternative to the more meat heavy entr\u00e9e options. \n\n[Desert]\nI had the warm chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart. TO DIE FOR!

We had a reservation but it was not very busy when we arrived early and got seated right away.\n\nThe menu is small-ish but switched up every few weeks. Between the time I made the reservation and the dining -- 3 weeks apart -- several items on the menu had changed. But you can still see the old favorites like Deviled egg, Squid ink noodles, and petite fillet on the menu.\n\nWe were lucky to find street parking, but would not count on it. The dining room is dimly lit and much darker than the kitchen in the back, intimate but you may need your cell phone flashlight to read the menu later into the evening.\n\nWe started with the old-fashioned house cocktail (vermouth and zesty orange peel). Husband loved it.\n\nWe had the following appetizers\n- Levian bread: with fresh churned butter; bread has a slight sourdough taste, very spongey with a nice heavy crust\n- Oysters: fresh, with very light Japanese-style seasoning\n- Squid ink noodles: refreshing and lemon-y, not too memorable\n- Grilled squid with butter beans and avocado: favorite dish of the night, spicy and crunchy and all sorts of deliciousness\n\nand entrees:\n- Ling cod: perfectly seared fish with very crispy skin, and the sweet red potatoes addition is, although not the best, at least interesting\n- Ricotta remoulade: cheesey dumplings shaped like small matzoh ball, a very very heavy dish and I didn't enjoy the heavy flavor combination\n\nDessert menu looks great (especially that eton mess), and it has a very promising locally-sourced tea selection. We ended up skipping dessert as my \"ricotta remoulade\" was wayyyyy toooooo heavyyyyyyyyyy.\n\nOverall food is delightful -- appetizers are outstanding, and some hit and miss with the entrees.

We shared everything - deviled egg, chilled ink squid noodles, home baked bread ( amazing), eggplant soup that was absolutely delicious.

The cake was light and fluffy, served with sweet corn ice cream. The crumble had minimal sweetness. If you like sweet, the crumble is not for you. I love desserts that are not very sweet so I really enjoyed it. It was a great experience, we will definitely be back.", "author": "Gaurav P."}

The desserts were actually the stand outs.  Angel food cake was better than expected, and the chocolate molten cake was quite good.  That chocolate brittle really was something special.

Once everyone was here, we were so busy catching up, that it took us quite a while (two rounds of delicious bread) to actually place our food order...there was so much to catch up on. But what I really appreciated - and which made all the difference - is that at no point in time did we feel rushed to place an order. (Usually, at places that are hard to get in, the restaurant is eager to get you in and out.)\n\nThe food was delicious (especially the deviled eggs), but what I really loved was the service.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-07-18", "description": "Great venue, awesome service, and decent food!  I can see why it has a star, but I think a change in the entrees would make it even better.  \n\nVenue: My friend and I came here for a Saturday 5pm reservation- the place was pretty empty given the time, but it started filling up around 5:30.  Lot of sunlight in the restaurant, and the minimal decor with wood accents added a nice touch to the intimate setting without being too fancy.  \n\nService: very impressed with the attention the staff provided!  I noticed they would frequently walk by to see our food status so they would know when to clear the plates away or not / fill waters / refill wine glasses.  They were also kind enough to be mindful of our timing (we told them we had a show at 7pm and therefore needed to leave around 6:45)- they originally said that the tasting menu (see below) would take around 2 hours but they were very attentive to make sure the dishes came out relatively quickly without rushing or making us wait for a long time for dishes to come out.  Very thankful of them for that!\n\nFood: we decided to do their tasting course ($70 per person), which consists of around 8-10 dishes, some available a la carte but also some exclusive to the tasting menu.  Overall, these dishes tended to pack a lot of flavor, though at times it came across as too spicy for my liking (still not used to strong spices like cumin, etc.).  However, btetter to be too flavorful than bland, I guess?  Some highlights include:\n- Deviled Egg (fresno chili relish, dolcini egg, marash pepper and spices) ($5) - eats / looks more like a poached egg, but I found the flavor combo with the cumin and pepper to be a rather unique one.  Bit spicy for my taste, but thank god for the rich runny yolk to mitigate that.\n- Anchovies on chickpea poppyseed sable cracker and creme fraiche ($6) - the nutty flavor of the cracker surprisingly went really well with the salty anchovy (which I love!).  I did have a few instances where I bit into the cracker and nearly dropped anchovy on myself because the whole topping slid off the cracker, but I can live with that.\n- Tagliatelle (eggplant and sherry ragout, sundried tomato, fried caper, pangrattato) ($18) - one of my favorites!  Usually not a fan of eggplant but it added an earthiness to the pasta dish.  Also liked how it was a lighter pasta dish; most of the time it has a heavy sauce or something that leaves me in a food coma for the rest of the day.  Definitely would recommend as an a la carte option.\n- Dark chocolate cake with salted caramel ice cream and drizzle (tasting menu only) - good dessert for chocolate lovers; the salted caramel and dark bitter chocolate go well together.  The dessert is a bit rich, so maybe not for those who want a heavy dessert to end the meal.  \n- Summer Berry Eton Mess ($10) - another favorite dish!  If you want to end the meal on a light, refreshing note, go with the Eton Mess- the meringue gives a good crunch to the soft whipped cream and berries without adding anything too much sweetness, and the meyer lemon ice cream is always a great way to add acidity as a sort of palette cleanser.  Between the two desserts, we finished this one.\n\nI'd say the two entrees we had (petit filet and wild king salmon) were good, but not as memorable as the other dishes listed above.  Nothing really wrong with them, and the proteins were cooked well, but I guess the flavors seemed a bit muted / muddled / weren't as impactful as the others; hence my review doesn't give Octavia a perfect score.  \n\nOverall, loved the venue and service.  Foodwise, we favored the appetizers, smaller plates, and desserts over the entrees.  If the entrees were as flavorful and creative as the other dishes were, I might have given Octavia 5 stars.  But I can see how Octavia deserves a Michelin Star and would gladly come back again and again.", "author": "Audrey H."}

The waiters knew what they were serving and were fun to interact with. They went above and beyond their job of serving food and explaining the dishes.

My friend and I hopped on the Octavia train on a whim because it was the only Michelin starred restaurant which an available last-minute reservation that was not $300 per person.\n\nAMBIANCE:\n\nThe Ambiance is great. Fancy casual, just as most of SF is. Most of the patrons skewed older with a few young professionals thrown into the mix. The restaurant is quite small with minimalistic decor. The dining room gets quite dark as the sun goes down, which makes it a bit romantic, but I was there with a guy friend and it didn't seem to make it too awkward. There's a soft buzz of chit chat but no boisterous storytellers which is probably because there is no bar at the restaurant, so it's just for dining with a side of wine. \n\nFOOD:\n\nThe food is amazing. What I really liked was that we were allowed to get the set menu AND order a la carte. Some places don't let you do that so it was nice that we were allowed to order a few oysters in addition to the rest of the meal. The meat was cooked well and the food was fresh. I was full by the end of the meal which is always a good sign (and sometimes doesn't happen...) I got the chocolate cake for dessert and it was just what I needed to close out my experience at Octavia.\n\nDRINK:\n\nThe wine selection is alright. We got a bottle of red burgandy. It was okay. I think it was $78 or so, which is reasonable. I prefer a larger wine selection with exotic and fine wines. That's not what you'll get at Octavia but that's okay. I was still happy with the experience because the food was bomb and the prices weren't crazy.\n\nSERVICE:\nI was seated right away even though I was 20 minutes early. The server took my wine order and brought some bread and butter (costs extra) while I waited for my friend to arrive. The servers weren't chatty but were friendly, so I have no complaints about the service.\n\nGreat date place to celebrate something special or just because.

It was certainly more and enough for me but even my 6'2\" age 25 son said it was completely filling for him in addition to being delicious. The price was only $103! I expected to pay more for this type of ambiance, service, and especially the delightful food.

The service and decor were great, on par with restaurants in that tier. However, the food wasn't imo. We got squid ink, lamb tar tar, tuna salad (raw tuna), steak, lamb, salmon.\n\nOne thing you do see is they do take really fresh ingredients. The tuna had these plums in it and they were one of the sweetest plums I've had.\n\nThe only dish I thought that really stood out was the lamb tartar. The decision to make it ground lamb was very smart and the toast that you spread it on was delicious. Would highly recommend that. It's got some acidity to it, so the gamey taste really doesn't hit you.", "author": "Victor D."}

That was me with Octavia. I have always passed by after driving home and thought it looked so cute, but never had the balls to actually try it out. After finally coming here, I was so glad I followed my intuition. Little did I know that it had amazing reviews on yelp, but it also earned 1 Michelin Star this year? :O \n\nDrinks: \nTo start, they have a very extensive drink menu - I ordered the house cocktail (kind of tasted like a negroni) and the house wine (Cuvee No. 10) and both complimented the food very well from start to finish. They do have corkage though if you don't want to spend 10+ per drink.\n\nFood: \nThe food is kind of a la carte and can be shared in groups. The top and middle row of the menu are smaller bites, while the bottom is entrees. \n\nIn terms of starters, the deviled egg, chilled squid ink noodle, little gems salad, and tagliatelle tonnato (tuna pasta) were good, but the little gems were the star. I had so much hopes for that deviled egg :( \n\nFor main courses (which are huge and can be shared) - their steak was cooked very well and was so flavorful and their chicken hash also had distinct qualities to it--the corn consistency might be weird at first but its flavorful. The fish had great skin to it, but didn't match the star power of the other dishes. In terms of dessert, the short bread had an asian inspiration with it and the corn ice cream had a very distinctive but great flavor if you like corn that is. \n\nPro Tips: \n-Reservations are highly recommended or you can try waiting. \n-It can get a bit chilly inside, so I suggest keeping a jacket with you! \n-The Bread service is endless and so tasty, don't feel nervous to ask for more bread. \n-They offer corkage for $25 \n-The waiters are really tall yet super nice and kept the drinks pouring! \n-There's a lot of parking rules in the area, so be careful where you park!", "author": "Eric Joseph D."}

My friend recommended this restaurant to me a while ago and I finally decided to try it. I loved the d\u00e9cor and atmosphere of the restaurant. It kind of has a hipster mid-century vibe with a lot of wood accents. \n\nThe food here really impressed me. Service was pretty good too. They switched waiters half way through the night when it became really busy. \n\nThe chilled squid ink noodles- the portion was really small, but for the price it's worth trying it. I wish it had slightly more flavor but I liked the lemony taste.\n\nPan con tomate with burrata- mmmm I LOVE burrata cheese with a passion so naturally I liked this dish. It was refreshing and perfectly light in flavor.\n\nGrilled petit filet- OMG this dish was mindblowing. The meat was tender and flavorful and the matsutake broth was magnificent. Loved the trumpet mushrooms too. They complemented the meat perfectly.\n\nBouillabaisse- included scallop, shellfish, and potatoes. Loved this dish too! Everything was cooked perfectly and the sauce was just amazing. \n\nOysters- I'm not a huge fan of oysters, but they are growing on me slowly. These tasted fresh and loved the sauce on them.\n\nToasted Angel food cake- Don't leave without trying this dessert! It was sooo good. Slightly crisp on the outside and moist on the inside. It was to die for. \n\nThe house white wine- I think this was the most disappointing out of everything we had here. I completely regretted ordering a bottle. It just wasn't good at all. \n\nCan't wait to come back and try some of their other dishes!", "author": "Mai Y."}

We arrived about 30 min before our reservation and they seated us right away.  They had a sign on our table wishing us a \"Happy Anniversary\", that was a nice touch. \n\nThere is no bar but the restaurant had a lively energy...felt like a relaxed but slightly upscale happy hour vibe. No music, just the sounds of people chatting it up.  It wasn't even packed, there were still several empty tables when we arrived.\n\nWe ordered the tasting menu for $70/person.  They were able to accommodate my list of food allergies which was a bonus.\n\nWe really liked the food... Everything tasted fresh, was perfectly cooked, with attention to detail on the plating...\n\nActually, on second thought dessert was kind of meh.  We appreciated the candles to make our anniversary feel special and we ate it but nothing to get excited about... \n\nSo aside from the mediocre dessert everything else was above average tasty.\n\nWe felt they were creative with ingredients and seasonings, but also that there was no flow between the dishes. It's more of a random sampling of the menu than a \"tasting menu\" where you kind of expect the dishes to be presented in an order with a purpose.\n\nI probably would have given this meal 4 stars but I had to take away a star based on the service so I'll go over my reasons for that...\n\nService was great at the beginning and started going downhill by the end. At that point the restaurant was full and at times people were standing along a side wall awkwardly waiting to be seated.\n\nThe tables are tiny so they cleared the bread when they served our entrees but I only ate one slice and would have liked to eat more of what they claimed to be their \"famous bread\" with my entree.  (I can't be the only one that waits to eat the bread with the delicious sauces on my plate...)\nBut then I felt awkward asking for more as they just intentionally took it off the table.  I almost asked if they could put a couple slices in a to-go box but I figured they would charge us for a whole loaf so I just kept my mouth shut. \n\nAlso, they had our wine in a decanter by the kitchen and at some point just stopped filling our wine glasses. I finally asked for more wine, and our server straight up told me that we had already finished it.  I'm definitely thinking, \"hmmmm, I see it...it's right over there...\"  So again, I felt awkward, but I didn't want to argue with him...\n\nEventually he found it and brought it back and refilled our glasses but at that point we are eating desserts so that was terrible timing. They should know that the 1994 Cab we saved for this special occasion was meant to be drank with the wagyu beef course, not the dessert!!  \n\nI thought this was a pretty big mistake for a restaurant at this level.  At that point they should have apologized and maybe even offered to comp a dessert wine... Just my opinion.\n\nOverall great meal. It was really fun, enjoyed the night out, and we both walked out saying, that was great but we'll probably never go back. We would rather try something different next time. Or go back to one of our favorites...\n\nTotal cost was just under $250 with 2 glasses of bubbles, corkage and all those city taxes.", "author": "Tami G."}

Perhaps adding tomatoes or some citrus would mix it up a bit. \n\nMain: \nKabocha squash- the squash was good but the \"green\" curry was nothing more than coconut milk/ cream\nDuck leg- Duck was overcooked and they outdid it with the carrots \n\nDessert:\nHoney crumb pudding - a misnomer. Was more like a big unsweetened cupcake with preserved fruits. Not worth $10.\nBlack sesame Eaton Mess- was a mess... the meringue was too heavy on the heavy cream and had no added value to the meal(but calories).

The \"Deviled\" Egg was perfectly cooked with a silky runny yolk and the chili lended some spice but not a scorching heat. The Squid Ink Noodles were dressed with fennel and lemon which took them to another level. The Crudo dish was beautiful I didn't want to eat it...but I did. Very fresh and clean. The Charred Snap Peas was favorite dish. I've never been more excited about a vegetarian dish before. The peas were tender bursting with sweetness and I could've eaten a whole bowl of the house ricotta. I usually skip dessert but I tried the Sassafras float - a fun play on a root beer float. This one had a sorbet, ice cream, gingersnap cookie and sassafras soda. It was wonderful - different textures and the ice cream and soda weren't too sweet. Very well balanced. Also, you can't skip on the house bread and butter. It's he cheapest thing on the menu and it's delicious. The staff was very friendly and were knowledgeable about each dish.

It was shaping up to be a great night, until the main courses arrived. \n\nMy pork loin had been sous vided and arrived soft, bland and tepid. It had a weird kind of space food quality that gave it the consistency of firm tofu. While I was not thrilled by this, the surrounding vegetable and mushrooms -- which were also tepid -- were pretty tasty. I didn't say anything because I did not want to derail our evening and eating some room temperature pork is not the worst thing in the world. \n\nMy wife's salmon also came out at the neglected bathtub temperature that I assume they sous vided it at. Luke wark salmon is kind of gross and when she sent it back we all assumed that the kitchen would quickly cook up a fresh one. But instead they came back a couple minutes later having reheated the old peice. Stop and think about this for a moment: this fish had now been for a bath (sous vide), fried, cooled down to room temp and then refried. Gross. When my wife suggested that was not really up to standard for a restaurant that takes it self so seriously, the server (not our original waiter) said it would take 20 minutes to remake in a clear effort to say \"don't make a fuss and just eat your god damned thrice cooked fish!\" \n\nWhen my wife said not to bother and that she would just skip the rest of the meal, our original waiter said he would have it out in 8 minutes. Our meal was already disrupted at that point. But when the new fish arrived it was indeed hot -- it had been baked at the core of the sun for those 8 minutes and was totally overcooked. \n\nWe tried to salvage what we could from the meal, but we were really shocked when the manager insisted that we pay for the drowned, neglected, thrice-cooked salmon. Moreover, he or she did so without even having the courtesy to come and speak to us. \n\nTo be fair, our waiter was very nice and I actually felt sorry for him but if there was a zero star rating on Yelp, Octavia would definitely deserve it. I hope someone there has a long tepid bath in their sous vide and comes out with a better attitude towards food and customer service.", "author": "matthew S."}

The dishes I ordered tasted average but was twice the price of what I would typically pay. Hence, I gave this restaurant such a low star rating because it just isn't worth the money at all. Servers were very nice, but it doesn't make up for the food. I would NOT recommend this restaurant. \n\nThe following was what I ordered:\n\nDeviled Eggs: not the traditional deviled eggs. It's simply a boiled egg with spices sprinkled on layered on top of crushed red peppers. Very salty but was decent\n\nCold Squid Ink Noodles: kind of bland and nothing special\n\nSmoked Mushroom Pozole: was more of a soup dish that was more for show than taste\n\nGrilled Pork Chop: very generous portion of pork chop but it was very expensive. It didn't taste anything special so I wasn't impressed at all", "author": "Derek L."}

I usually dislike dimly lit restaurants (how unromantic, I know), but I was okay with Octavia! Actual restaurant space is pretty small and each party probably stays ~2 hours from start to finish of their dinner. There was about a 15 minute wait in-between each course for us. Service was great but they forgot to give us bread! I figured they didn't do that anymore until we were a few courses into our meal and I saw The Bread Guy walking around for empty tables to put bread & butter on. Not a huge loss but I was curious to try it! \n\nMENU (from last week)\n-chilled squid ink noodles - Not terrible but not worth the hype. It's pretty much what you'd think cold noodles would taste like with a bit of lemon juice. The husband was hoping that the noodles would have a nice chewy texture but they did not. \n\n-burrata salad - I love burrata! Definitely recommend this salad if you do too. \n\n-sunchoke soup - our favorite dish this evening! It was creamy and full of a roasted but sweet flavor. I especially liked the yogurt. \n\n-potato gnocchi - nothing in particular stood out to me about the gnocchi, but I love potatoes so I would say it was a good staple to have. \n\n-\"Osso Buco\" - I had no idea what this was so I googled it. It's basically a stew made of veal shank. It was very hearty but a little too much on the salty side for my taste. The sweetness of the squash helped but it wasn't enough to balance everything. The kale also adds a sour taste but I wasn't won over. \n\n-Pork Loin - meat was surprisingly juicy, unlike most of the other Yelp reviews I saw. This dish had a good balance of sweetness and saltiness.", "author": "Grace J."}

Unfortunately,  after we were able to join we were given menus and water but no one came back to take our drink orders, and I really needed a drink after fighting BART delays and all the Gay Pride folks in tutus (they were super cute just not in a hurry).  We finally had to flag someone down to get a glass of wine (but this was the only time we experienced a lack of service). \n\nThe server will ask casually if you would like bread, do not skip the bread, it is some of the best bread I have ever tasted, and it would be tragedy to miss this warm morsel with its side of salted butter.  \n\nAll of the apps were tasty, although I thought $3 for each oyster was little on the high side.  The hard boiled egg was nice with it's spicy sauce, the calamari was beautiful and complex, the squid ink noodles were okay although I may have preferred them more saucy since I found them a little dry all on their own.\n\nFrom the apps we went right to the mains.  I am not normally a red meat gal, but the petit fillet with its roasted cabbage and faro lured me in.  It was a beautiful plate, the steak was butter tender, and every bite was succulent and roasty. The duck, although cooked to a nice temperature, suffered from not fully rendering the fat, which is always a drag.\n\nSimilar to my comment about the bread do not skip dessert, it is a can't miss course even if you don't normally order sweets.  The Honey crumb pudding with honey toffee was perfect and not too sweet.  The Rocky road Eton Mess was a mess of yummy with great texture.\n\nWe steered away from the very specific cocktails and it is pretty easy to select a wine to pair, but the wine menu did not blow me away, which is no big deal.", "author": "Heather D."}

Corner location w/ a wood interior & not too many tables created a cozy atmosphere.\n\nEvery course is served family style, so from smallest to largest we ordered:\n-\"DEVILED EGG\": Nice presentation, beautiful to cut into and make yolk porn with, but I could skip this next time. As much as I love soft-boiled eggs, this was not much more than just that. Still yummy though.\n-Chilled SQUID INK NOODLES: Delicious. Squid ink noodles and bottarga are a match made in heaven, and this dish showcased that wonderfully. Each forkful was a refreshing bite of lemon upon chilled noodles. Definitely a must order.\n-LITTLE GEM LETTUCE, roasted bing cherry, toasted pistachio, blu del granduca: Awesome salad! My family and I were practically fighting over pieces. Next time we should probably just get 2 orders lol\n-TAGLIATELLE TONNATO: Great pasta dish and the albacore tuna is what made it unique. They change their pasta offerings regularly but you can be sure they know how to do it right.\n-Grilled PETIT FILET: The star of the dinner, at least for me. Each piece was so BEAUTIFULLY PINK and perfectly cooked. I was practically drooling as it arrived at our table. The roasted cabbage, cherry tomato, charred eggplant, and creme fraiche added a savory freshness to the dish\n-CHICKEN confit \"hash\": Juicy chicken! The corn made for an interesting flavor profile that I kept eating more of.\n-King SALMON: Super crispy skin made this salmon amazing. As with the other larges dishes, the vegetables complemented the meal perfectly.\n-Angel food cake w/ corn ice cream: Perfect end to our meal. The cake was so fluffy and the corn ice cream was so good! I wish I could have more!\n\nI had a nice dining experience; friendly/funny staff, good portions, & great value.

Having read so much about Octavia in the SF press, my friend and I committed ourselves to going awhile back since reservations are fairly hard to come by for a reasonable dining hour during the week. Aside from the beautiful pasta and protein plates that are all over the Internet, the one thing my friend wanted to get was the breaded eggplant.  My experience with eggplant has always been neutral to general distaste; I certainly avoided it if it were presented to me in its raw and unadulterated form.  That being said, and trying to open myself to trying new things, I had one bite of that eggplant dish and was an immediate fan.  Here's a rundown of what we shared that night:\n\n\"Deviled Egg,\" Fresno Chile Relish, Marash Pepper & Spice: We each got our own egg, which was a good idea since sharing this would have been awkward.  While the presentation of the egg was beautiful, there was a little too much of the chili pepper and spices on the egg.  The egg was cooked perfectly, but I was only so-so on this.\n\nCrisp Eggplant, Miso Butter & Charred Sungold Tomato: As previously mentioned, this was probably my favorite dish of the evening.  The breading and miso butter on the eggplant was what made this an absolute home run of a dish for me.\n\nSaffron Tonnarelli, Fino Sherry, Tomato, Toasted Garlic & Fennel: The pasta itself was cooked perfectly and I loved the fresh tomatoes that came with the pasta.  The saffron wasn't overwhelming, but it seemed to play second fiddle to the garlic on the dish.  This was the perfect amount of pasta to share between two people!\n\nLocal King Salmon, Anson Mills Farro Verde, Green Olive, Purslane, Avocado: After some mulling over on whether or not we share an entree or get our own, we decided on sharing the salmon.  I'm pretty glad we did too since this was a generous serving of salmon! I loved loved loved the purslane and avocado that came with this.  While salmon isn't always my first choice of protein, I'm glad that I decided to get a little adventurous and step outside of the land animal box too.  \n\nWith all of the items we ordered, we had to pass on dessert and called it quits before getting to the \"too full, can't talk\" realm.  Service wise, our server was an absolute gem and was great in his recommendations and his advice on how to approach the menu.

Even then, his attitude and body language was \"it is what it is.\" He didn't even greet the rest of our party as they showed up. He avoided us completely without acknowledgement of our situation or making any eye contact as we were waiting where there was no waiting area and as a party of 6 we had to constantly get out of the way of waiters and try not to fall over on the people who were seated.\n\nFinally when our table was ready he tried to make up for it and offered us champagne, but before I could take a sip, I realized he was taking us downstairs to the restaurant's kitchen. He said we got the special chef's table. We never asked to be seated in the kitchen surrounded with the busy hard working staff. Some ask for that, but we clearly didn't. (I am a chef myself and did not wish to be seated in the kitchen when dining out with friends.) The setting felt like the dungeons and a far far cry from the beautiful main dining area we had reserved for like our previous visits.\n\nIf you have a party of 6 and do not wish to have your meal in the restaurant's kitchen make sure to ask NOT to get the \"chef's table.\" It seems like if the tables in the main dining area don't clear in time, they will seat you down in the kitchen. \n\nEven though the food was excellent, as it has always been, it's a shame the host couldn't practice the basics of customer relations; communication, kindness/sympathy, and an apology.", "author": "P Y."}

Id been meaning to hit Octavia since they opened but time has not been on my side. Recently there was a special dinner that a friend organized so I went to check it out. We split a ton of dishes amongst a group to get a good idea of the spread. We ended up with:\n\n\n-Chilled Squid Ink NOODLES, Cortez Bottarga, Fennel, Lemon Oil\n-Mushrooms \"A LA GRECQUE\" with Grilled Levain \n-BEEF TONGUE, Piracicaba Broccoli, Toasted Garlic, Marrow Broth\n-Chilled Early Girl TOMATO SOUP, Burrata Cheese & Garlic Toast\n-Brandt Farms Beef RIB-EYE, Eggplant Caponata, Nardello Pepper, Confit Tomato\n-Marin Coast King SALMON, Farro Verde, Green Olive, Purslane, Avocado \n-Arbuckle GRITS, Sweet Corn, Ricotta, King Trumpet Mushroom, Blistered Padr\u00f3ns\n-Long & Baily PORK CHOP, Grilled Zucchini, Creamed Corn, Roasted Mission Fig\n\nAll delicious across the boad. Id argue that I like Frances a bit more as it's a more focused menu (that I remember) whereas Octavia has a much more global influence. The other thing would be price/portion size/performance. of the entrees are pretty high. but then Im willing to pay more for quality, which Octavia has in droves. The staff are super friendly and that's a good draw for your dining experience. I remember the Baker and Banker space looking more formal and definitely more brightly lit.

The space is clean and modern with enough nick backs to look at but mostly people watching. It is actually a smallish place so probably best to reserve on a busy day (we did). We tried several of the small plates. Each was characterized by nuanced tastes. The oysters were fresh and accompanied by some subtle tastes that elevated them.

Rather, make a reservation- it will not disappoint. As fellow Yelper, Brittany F noted...the menu is short and sweet...but every dish was thoughtful and delicious. We ordered a variety of dishes to share and I am so glad we did. We ordered the deviled egg: not ideal for sharing, but this one is one of their signature items so it was worth ordering. It's not your traditional deviled egg....but worth a try! Next, we had the halibut crudo served over an avocado crema/mousse. This was delicious. Definitely a petite portion, but lovely and delicate. Next, we indulged in the Tagliatelle in a pesto sauce. This dish did not really stand out to me as much as the others, but it was still a-ok. Next, we had salmon  served with in  a brown butter fig sauce. This dish had the wow factor for sure. The butter sauce was rich but not over powering. We ordered an extra side of the sauce just to dip our bread in. It was lovely. For dessert, we ordered the Eton Mess...and this was my first time trying this dessert. Per my dining buddy it was one of the best she's ever had...even though it was not a totally traditional take on the classic old school dessert. All I know is that it was beautifully plated and equally delicious. Our other dessert was a fruit cake....I believe it was shortcake. This was light but definitely more on the spectrum of a sweet I'd have with my morning coffee. \n\nTo sum it up- Octavia delivers on good food and excellent customer service.

Liked this a lot. \n\nRib-eye: expertly cooked and I actually like the fact that they retained a ring of fat on one side of the ribeye to give more flavor. \n\nRicotta dumping: I was never a big fan of balls of mozzarella and this one reminded of that. This is only for die-hard cheese fans. The tomato was just not enough to overcome somewhat bland ricotta dumpling. \n\nI tried the Octavia signature Pinot Noir blended from three different vineyards in Sonoma coast and it was very good.

Maybe earlier in the evening before it's so dim you're straining to see your food. I'm 29. I don't have problems seeing. It was very dark in here; so dark I saw similarly-aged humans using their phone to navigate the menu. You could say the lighting was maybe... too sexy.\n\nArrival\nWe dropped in here a little earlier than our 8:15 reservation.\nThey were perfectly accommodating and seated me and my husband immediately.\nI had mentioned in the reservation that we were celebrating getting hitched that morning at City Hall and were looking to spoil ourselves a little bit.\nThey promptly served us a sparkling ros\u00e9 something on the house. Nice! Right?\nTrouble is, my very thoughtful friend had called ahead ordered us two glasses of champagne that we never saw. She was very disappointed and after finding out she was charged and we were none the wiser. And man I was bummed. Not because I didn't have champagne but because having to tell someone about the surprise afterwards takes the wind out of your sails if you know what I mean. So maybe give a little ring a half hour ahead if you have any little special something you wanted to make sure happened.\n\nFood\nWe started with the \"deviled\" egg and chilled squid ink noodles.\nBoth were balanced dishes. I preferred the noodles,\nas the deviled egg was a little bland. \nThough perfectly soft-boiled, generally it's flowing into something well-seasoned. I just wanted more from a $5 dollar egg.\nThe noodles had an amazingly clean, refreshing, savory flavor with just the tiniest bit of gumminess to the noodle. Which is impressive. They're hard to explain but also unforgettable. \nI think the bread showed up around this time. I had been slowly losing my mind that it wasn't the first thing to come out. It also wasn't refilled at any point, which is the opposite of what I had been told by other patrons. I would have been happy to pay for another portion, but it was never offered, it was just swept off the table. \nWe shared the butternut squash soup, which was well-presented and they brought us two bowls to portion between us, which I appreciated! It was deliciously creamy and a great compromise between the usual (and unfortunately) sweet profile and was cut with a savory lentil. I was really impressed because generally I am not a bs soup fan. But yes to this. \nBy the time we got to the malfatti, I was worried I wouldn't be able to eat anymore. But we charged on. Butter. I tasted mostly butter, but my husband ate anything left with a reckless abandon. These porcini mushrooms were no joke.\nWe finished up with the Angel Food Cake, which honestly was a little forgettable. \nDessert is often generally my favorite course, but the pumpkin ice cream was really lacking impressionable flavor and I wouldn't say \"subtle\" was the aim. It was fully overpowered by the coconut and brown butter; I had my doubts when I read it on the menu. Pumpkin is a little difficult to pull flavor out of and you'll definitely find that's true with this dish. The presentation was fun, but it took the angel food cake to a heavier place and it lost it's airy-ness for me.\n\nDrinks\nI got The Relief, which was amazing -- really fantastic. Floral but bright but not at all syrupy or heavy. I would definitely recommend.\nMy husband got the house cocktail, it was a little too dark for me. I tend to avoid dark liquors in life, but it was still a smoky little treat. \n\nService\nWhomever was the host was fantastic. The few times we got to interact with him I felt like a damn kwane. But we mostly had a server who I would describe as a mixture between a sleepy koala and a dismissive cat. Maybe that's the vibe they want but I would say his attitude was inconsistent with the rest of the service we received. He was still attentive, but he wasn't having any of our chatty nonsense.\n\nThe experience was enjoyable\nand sure, I'd recommend it\nbut I probably would only visit for squid ink noodles and to try another non-pumpkin dessert.", "author": "Kiera R."}

Not good food.\n\nInterior is contemporary and refined but rather dark and a tad cramped (uncomfortable chairs).\n\nThey are strict on reservations. Booking via opentable = $25 per person fee if you cancel.\n\nMade a reservation for dinner and was seated promptly. Friendly and courteous staff.\n\nOrdered:\n\nSquid ink noodles - texture was a bit too soft; utterly devoid of flavor. Typical SF restaurant to add ink to spruce up an otherwise boring dish.\n\nKale salad - pretty good, but I fail to see how a salad without truffles or protein is worth $13. The best part of this was the garlic crouton which is essentially just a buttery toasted bruschetta.\n\nDuck leg - small portion size. Hideously over cooked. Skin was even noticeably charred. The carrot was cooked nicely though.\n\nSquash and green curry - my favorite dish. Interesting balance of creaminess and spice with some nicely cooked veggies.\n\nBlack sesame Eton mess - ice cream was good but the mandarin and buddha's hand were mere afterthoughts drowned out in some really sweet sugary slabs (not sure if toffee or nougat or something). Cream with sesame was too rich and should have better balanced the sesame flavor.\n\nHoney crumb pudding - decent dessert, not too sweet yet had a robust flavor and texture to anchor preserved fruits. The creme fraiche was a nice touch.\n\nService was attentive and professional.\n\nThey also charge a mandatory $4/customer charge to offset the increases in employee healthcare (thanks, ACA).\n\nOverall my issue is in how expensive the food cost given the quality. Michelin prices but below Michelin flavors. Based on other restaurants in the new America genre and this part of the world, Octavia charges 1.5-2x what they should.\n\nI don't plan on coming back.", "author": "Erik R."}

Squid ink noodle is my favorite; so fresh and refreshing! Tomatero Salads are also outstanding! Duck breast is skillfully cooked and super, though I was looking for more tenderness. I highly recommend their Ethiopian coffee, aromatic and full of great flavor. I didnt like the Profiteroles as much as my friend's Honey Bread.\n\nService is good.

I've been to Frances and Octavia when they first opened and experienced her cuisine once again at a special Michelin All-Star dinner in August. Of all Californian fare restaurants, I think Melissa does the best at synthesizing the flavor profiles utilizing our great produce and creating eclectic, fresh dishes that are memorable with their flavor combinations. \n\nLike Frances, the vibe at Octavia is homey and comfortable, although in a bigger space, more mood lighting, and an open kitchen visible in the back; it's very much solidified itself as a neighborhood gem restaurant. Service is warm and friendly while being restrained and not pushy. The wine list is quaint, but expansive and well curated with great selections from Frances, Italy, and California. The $25 corkage fee is also a tremendous bargain if you want to pop special bottles. \n\nNow for the food;\n1. Tempura butternut squash with sudachi (a Japanese citrus) aioli. Very well done tempura with a light crisp batter while still perfectly cooking the squash to a tender al dente. \n2. Nettle tagliatelle with house cured pancetta was a Californian rendition on carbonara. Well made noodles with a nice chew to accompany the texture and richness of the sauce, while the nettle (an edible plant with an earthy profile) was made into pasta giving extra flavor depth. \n3. Ling cod, clams, nori beurre-blanc w/ potatoes was incredibly memorable. I'm stealing the nori beurre-blanc because it's so good. It gave the fish added umami and a slight Asian influence from the seaweed (nori). The cod itself was so flavorful, flaky, and moist, with perfectly charred skin while not being overly salty to achieve that perfect crust. Clams and potatoes accompanied perfectly with the dish's cohesiveness and was a very well rounded and thoughtful dish. \n4. Angel food cake with pumpkin sherbet. I was eyeing the signature chocolate souffle again, but its so interesting to taste their more seasonal desserts. Creamy pumpkin sherbet with fluffy and cloying food cake. Overall not that heavy and not cloying, although the roasted pumpkin felt slightly out of place/excessive? \n\nOverall I love Octavia, I love Frances, I love Melissa's cooking. With all the great places to eat in SF and constant restaurant openings, it's important to revisit these classics and Octavia, along with Frances,reminds me why it's going to be one of my monthly spots.

We arrived a few minutes early for our reservation, and were promptly seated once the previous diners table was cleaned up. \n\nThe space itself is beautiful, the bold dark hues against the white walls and wooden tables was really charming. \n\nWhile the menu itself isn't particularly large, it does feel like there are a lot of dishes to choose from, and multiple dishes that would suite an array of palates. I will 100% make my way back to Octavia as soon as I can stand going to back to the city (lol).\n\nWe ordered:\n\n+ The Deviled Egg - This is a MUST GET. When we initially saw the pictures I didn't think a homely egg could be a stand out dish on it's own, but this really really works-- so long as you break the egg into the relish below and get a bite with a little bit of everything. If you're not into sharing (we are) you could probably get one per person, but we wanted to taste a little bit of everything on the menu so we only got one.\n\n+ Steak Tartare - This was a little underwhelming and I think the kalamata olives mixed in don't really add anything and are too powerful on their own to be in a tartare. That said, it wasn't bad, but I probably wouldn't order it again.\n\n+ Corn Chowder - This came in second to my favorite dish of the night. There is something wonderful about a great bowl of summer corn chowder and this hit all the notes I was hoping for. Despite having a dollop of creme fraiche and potatoes, it wasn't too heavy and the broth was rich, flavorful, but not heavy handed. This was the only dish I regret sharing because it was so, so delicious.\n\n+ Saffron Linguine w/ Dungeness broth & tomato ragout - My mouth is watering just thinking about this pasta. They listed it as an appetizer, but our server offered me an entree sized portion if I wanted it. I actually stuck to the appetizer portion and it was plenty after all the appetizers and still saving room for dessert. This dish was phenomenal. The sauce was light, and not as fishy as I had expected it to be, and full of crab flavor despite not having any meat in it otherwise. I also enjoyed the linguine which were prepared al dente, and clearly made in house.\n\n+ Fingerling potato hash w/ cioppolini onions, padron peppers, and sweet summer corn - I only had a few bites of this, but for a vegetarian entree I thought it was really good. The cioppolini onions and padron peppers were of course, my favorite bites.\n\n+ Chocolate Souffle Tart - Get this dessert. Get it. Lick the plate clean!

We got a reservation on the earlier side and were one of the first patrons to join for dinner.\n\nTo start, she ordered the fried green tomatoes and I got the deviled egg. Both were amazing to the point of inspiring my sister to claim it (the fried green tomatoes) was the best dish she had ever tasted. The dish included chanterelles, purslane and a vinaigrette that I'm pretty sure she still dreams about. I was equally impressed with the egg. It is one of their signature items and isn't your typical deviled egg. It was soft-boiled and covered in a marash pepper and spice mix and surrounded by a tasteful amount of fresno chile relish. The flavor of the spices surrounding the egg paired well with the relish, and both were spot on with the perfectly cooked egg.\n\nFor our main dishes we picked two to split. We ordered a pork mole. And a salmon, French-inspired dish. The king salmon was served over a fresh bean cassoulet, arrowhead cabbage, summer squash and squash blossoms. The pork featured pork from a local farm, Llano Seco, salsa mole, blistered peppers, roasted grapes, and tomatillo. The roasted grapes through me for a loop, but the flavors of the pork mole were incredibly unique and surprisingly delicious together. Together they created a flavor profile that knocked both our socks off. The salmon was also delicious, and very rich. We left quite satisfied with this amount of food for the two of us.\n\nEverything is prepared based on the season, so you may not be able to enjoy these exact dishes, but be confident the chefs at Octavia will put together a delicious and creative dish made with the finest of ingredients.\n\nThe service was pretty spectacular. I'm pretty sure the waiter was not as excited about our excitement about the delicious food, but he was patient with us and quite kind. Since there weren't many other people there at the time we were well attended to, with refilled waters, and answers to all of our questions about the menu. They were incredibly accommodating to food intolerances and had options for meat-lovers, non-meat eaters, people trying to eat Whole30 or paleo, gluten free, and so forth.\n\nThe restaurant is located in a quite unassuming area in San Francisco. It could easily be mistaken for an apartment, since it is tucked away in a residential area. That all just adds to its charm. With just one visit Octavia has made it into my top five restaurant choices for dinner in San Francisco.

You could definitely taste the brininess. However, I wished there was a bit of heat and acidity to the oysters. We also shared the roasted beets and fig salad with arugula and watercress. We ordered the albacore tuna confit and that was a winner. It was so good that we both agreed to order a second one!

Came across an early dinner reservation on a Sunday night and couldn't pass it up since this is \"hot and new\". I've been to the sister restaurant Frances a long time ago and wasn't that impressed, but was ready to give this new place a try. \n\nFood/drinks- chilled squid ink noodles: delicious, a fancy pasta salad; mushroom 'a la creque': lots of mushroom flavor and came with toast; beef tongue and marrow broth: good, but a bit disappointed especially after reading yelpers' reviews saying it's amazing; turnip greens and rapini salad: very refreshing, enjoyed a lot: king salmon: beautifully cooked medium rare with classic components, summer berry Eton mess: amazing dessert, refreshing yet creative in terms of flavors and textures, would order again; bread: read some yelp reviews saying bread is available upon request though not written anywhere on the menu, but our waitress kindly asked us if we wanted any bread without us asking, it was really good seeds/nut bread; had a glass of Chardonnay which was nice\n\nAmbiance/Decor- clean, modern and sleek with open kitchen. I couldn't tell that much things were different compared to the former restaurant that was here, but I'm sure there were. I liked the tables and chairs, bench seating available at one corner of the restaurant. \n\nService/Staff- friendly and attentive. Seated immediately at our table when we arrived on time for our reservation. Our waitress wore cowboy boots, how cute. There were white (fabric) napkins on the table already but the waitress brought over a black one especially for me after we ordered our food/drinks because I was wearing black pants. I very much appreciated that since it is a pain to have white lint sticking to black pants, which happened to me before! The items we ordered were all correct and other staff were attentive to take away/replace plates and refill water etc. throughout our meal. \n\nTips- there is no sign to or on the restroom door so I almost went into the kitchen side door thinking it was the restroom! Restroom is located at the back, left of the kitchen; it's door looks like a closer and is grey/white color. Make reservations, drop ins are difficult, at least during this time when the restaurant is still fairly new. \n\nWe saw Brett Cooper, the ex-chef of Outerlands/current chef at Aster came in to dine. Very interesting to see the chef circle interact and so that was cool. I'm sure he got to taste everything on the menu!\n\nOverall a solid restaurant that I actually enjoyed much more compared to Frances. Most things were prepared in a fairly classic way, but I think that's Melissa's style. Food and wine was delicious, everything was executed well, service was awesome, and the place is nice. I was content.", "author": "Iris H."}

Throw in some booze and some oysters, and you're guaranteed an even better night. *Wink Wink*\n\nOpening on Thursday, April 16th, comes Octavia, Frances' sister restaurant in the old Baker and Banker space. Having a been to Frances several times, I knew we were in for a treat with Octavia. The New American menu is comprised with seven \"bites\"/small apps ($3.50 - $8), four small plates ($9-$13), four entrees ($24-$48), and five desserts ($8-$9). Wine and beer only but they do have a house loophole cocktail and a good variety of vermouth available. Wines by the glass were $10-$22+ (house wine is $15/glass).  Like every new restaurant that has been popping up, portions are small so expect to spend around $80-$100 a person for a full meal with wine. \n\nReservations are highly recommended as we saw several parties turned away. Do note, that you need to provide a credit card to secure reservations and there's a 48 hour cancellation policy. If they can't reseat your table, you will be charged $25 per person and the credit will be applied on your next visit. \n\n~ * ~ D R I N K S ~ * ~\n*House Cocktail: Lillet blanc, vermouth, petal, thorn ($10): http://bit.ly/1JZeaXV\n*Domaine de Galouchey - Bordeaux - Vin de Jardin - 2011 ($22/glass): http://bit.ly/1DtiJ7k\n\nI'm a hard booze girl so getting things started with a cocktail was a must. Usually not a fan of loophole cocktails because they tend to be overly sweet but the house cocktail was good. I asked for a red wine to pair with the ribeye and was brought the most expensive one at $22/glass. Go figure but the bright silkiness was unparalleled. \n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~ \n*Shigoku Oysters w/ fennel mignonette ($3.50 each): 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1H7ZFCU\nUber fresh, clean, sweet and meaty. \n\n*Kale Salad w/ garbanzo, preserved lemon, carrots, feta, toasted sesame ($10): 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1cQfxgy\nGreat balance of creamy, nutty and subtle citrus flavors. I really enjoyed the m\u00e9lange of lemon, feta, and toasted sesame. \n\n*Deviled Eggs w/ Fresno chili relish, marash pepper & spice ($4 each): 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1HnP6dx\nNothing like a little egg porn to make you salivate. Although the egg was perfectly soft boiled, it just seemed like a standard egg to me; even with the spices.  \n\n*Grilled Beef Tongue w/ charred broccoli, marrow broth ($8): 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1HLF06A\nOne of most favorite cuts, the lengua was incredibly tender. Seemed braised rather than grilled though (no grill marks). \n\n*Chilled Squid Ink Noodles w/ cortez bottarga, lemon oil, green garlic ($6): 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1bdxSmM\nMy favorite dish of the night, the squid ink noodles had a great toothsome chew with a lovely brininess from the bottarga. You get a heaping tablespoon of this per an order so I highly recommend ordering one for yourself. \n\n*Dry Aged Ribeye w/ watercress, wild ramp, stilton butter ($42): 3.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1E1HKuV\nThe only disappointment of the night. We were requested the steak rare-plus and was told the kitchen tends to undercook their steaks, and that medium rare should be sufficient. It arrived medium. *sad pouty lip* Other than that, the rib eye was deliciously tender and flavorful from the 60 dry aging process. Additionally like another reviewer had commented, I wish the steak had charred crust. Had the steak been cooked rarer, no doubt this would be a 5 star ribeye. \n\n*Almond Milk Panna Cotta w/ delta blueberries, pain d'amande cookies (comped - $8): 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1aKKEIF\nFor all you chinese folks out there, if you like dofu fa, you will like the almond milk panna cotta. It was silky smooth and I enjoyed the sweet, tart bursts from the blueberries. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nProfessional, knowledgeable, and gracious. As it was opening week, there were some kinks but that's to be expected with any new restaurant. For example, there was a 30+ minute lag before receiving our steak entr\u00e9e. I did mention to our waiter that our steak was overcooked to our liking and he was very apologetic so he comped our dessert. \n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nWhat huge change from when it was Baker & Banker! The space has been transformed to a contemporary rustic space with an open kitchen and lots of natural light. Good for dates but not large groups. Not the greatest acoustics as it got quite loud once the dining room was full. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~\nI hope they consider valet in the future because parking is very tough in the area and there's no nearby parking lot. \n\nSo...who doesn't like date night right?\n\nOh yah, the one footing the bill.

The room is beautiful, they've totally nailed it on the branding, and the staff is friendly. The vermouth list is awesome. The bread was INCREDIBLE. Presentation is beautiful on all dishes.\n\nUnfortunately the cons outweighed the pros:\n- The staffing system means you get served by multiple people. I get that this is a \"thing\" but it made us feel not cared for. Stick with one server for a table, sometimes the old way is the best way. There was duplication in people asking to get us things, when we had already asked someone else.\n- The staff was not educated on food and beverage. One of the servers, in a conversation with us about vermouth cocktails, said \"that one's like an old-fashioned, old fashioneds have vermouth in them!\". No, they don't. \n\nThe food was ok:\n- Risotto - really good, pretty hard to go wrong \n- Osso Bucco - cooked well but was overly strong and salty, 2 people sharing and we couldn't eat it all because it was overwhelming\n- Duck - some of the worst I've had. The skin was not seared (what?!), it was wet and undercooked. The breast itself was VERY rare, honestly too rare. Both of those things combined with it being cut into HUGE slabs made it just gross. \n- Crumb pudding - dry and lacking flavor.\n\nBummed overall, but glad we finally went.", "author": "Ashley B."}

We tried their salmon and mushroom entrees and their deviled egg appetizer.  The deviled egg is just one soft boiled egg with a lot of spicy pepper sprinkled on it with the egg sitting on an oily pepper sauce. You might think $5 for a soft boiled egg is a bit of a stretch, but the pepper topping and sauce made it worth it.  The entrees were great too, although I would say the price point was a bit high and the salmon could have used a bit more flavoring, but overall we enjoyed everything we bought.

Our waiter was cordial and gave us good wine recommendations. He recommended a light and crisp chardonnay to go with out food. No complaints in regards to the service.\n\nFOOD was decent. We ordered: the deviled egg, chilled squid ink noodles, corn soup, tagliatelle, and pork loin. Portion sizes are small. And we split all of the five dishes.\n\nNot sure if we misunderstood the concept, but the deviled egg was a bit confusing to us, as it didn't seem deviled. It was really just a boiled egg...that had some seasoning on it...that we cut open. The squid ink noodles were interesting and novel to me. But my friend commented that she didn't like it very much. Other than that, I thought it was decently prepared and not bland. The next dish that came out was our corn soup, which I thought was very well done. It was a little sweet and pretty flavorful. The tagliatelle was a favorite for both my friend and I. Flavorful, well done pasta. The last dish that came out was the pork loin, which for me, was not the most flavorful. They put a mustard sauce below the pork loin, but it was overwhelmingly mustardy when I ate the two together. And significantly less flavorful when I ate the pork loin on its own. I also found the pork loin a bit too chewy for my liking. \n\nPersonally my favorites were the corn soup and the tagliatelle.

Sarah's house baked Levain with the cultured butter  was wonderful, we ate it all up before any other thing came. It was crunchy on the outside but the crust wasn't too big with soft, fresh and dense on the inside. Chilled Squid Ink Noodles were delicious and went well with the lemon and fennel flavor. Their take on Pozole was interesting and flavorful. However, I don't know how I feel about the popcorn in it. For the main course we got the Petit Fillet and Peruvian Purple Polenta. We got Petit fillet as medium rare, the meat was good quality and went well with accompaniments. It was nothing special that you could not do at your grill. Peruvian Purple Polenta was my least favorite. It is hard to make polenta bad in my opinion but the high ratio of peas to polenta in it didn't work for me. For dessert, we got the Toasted Angel Food Cake and Souffle tart. The Toasted Angel Food Cake is served with blueberry, mascarpone, lavender ice cream and goes complimented it very well. Cake was light, juicy and not too sweet, the ice cream was delicious too. Warm Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 tart is accompanied by cocoa nib brittle, salted caramel ice cream, which is quite obviously a good combination. Tart was hot and perfect texture.

There when you wanted them, not there when you didn't.   I felt really bad since, due the ever-increasing shittiness of Bay Area traffic, we were more than 30 minutes late for our reservation.   The staff made no big deal of it (thank you!) though.\n\nFor drink, they don't have a full liquor license, so you have wine, beer and loophole cocktails mostly with vermouth.  My friend had a madera and tonic which was very good.  I had a wonderful Chenin Blanc with a light, crisp fruity flavor and a minerally finish.\n\nFood:\n\nDeviled Egg:  Perfectly cooked soft-boiled egg with some spices and chile thrown on there.   Really enjoyed it.  If you don't appreciate the value of a perfectly cooked egg, the subtleness and refinement of this dish may not register.\n\nSpring Greens and Burrata:  Fresh greens, burrata and asparagus.  I adore spring veggies and burrata.  Needless to say, we were very pleased with this dish.  Generous portion too.\n\nPapardelle:  Toasted walnut and brown butter pesto with aged balsamic and cress.  I am not sure where the cress was in this dish, but I don't care....it was sumptuous and comforting and delicious.  Perfect pasta and sauce was delectable.  \n\nDuck Breast:  Best duck I have ever eaten.  The breast was perfectly medium rare.  Silky smooth, delicate and toothsome all at the same time.  There was the perfect amount of delicious fat and the skin was so perfectly crispy.  The duck on its own was a trip to flavor country.  It was served with grilled escarole, fennel and some type of pepper.  They all added a necessary and welcome crunch.  It was also served with these bready/crouton things that must have been soaked in crack.  Really, really impressive.\n\nWhat I liked most about this place was that it was unique and different while being comforting and familiar and non-pretentious at the same time.   I have been getting so tired of all these high-concept restaurants that ultimately don't deliver on flavor.   This place also seemed like a a good value for the quality that you get.  The four dishes above were more than filling (there was no room for dessert even though we really wanted to order one).  With our food and two drinks each, our bill was $118 before tip.  Not cheap, but I have paid much more for less.\n\nEnjoy.", "author": "Christian C."}

The servers were nice and the service was fine. The food however, was a disappointment. For the price point and reviews I would have expected a lot more.\n\nOysters - 2/5 stars $4/each SKIP - I've had better oysters at Fisherman's Wharf. They were very sub-par.\n\nDeviled Egg -  4/5 stars -  Definitely interesting and tasty but nothing to be raved about. It's essentially just a soft-boiled egg (cooked to perfection) with spices. We are going to try replicating it at home.\n\nChilled Squid Ink Noodles - 3.5/5 - The noodles were refreshing and lemony. Definitely interesting and worth trying but not anything incredibly amazing\n\nSpring Greens Salad - 3.5/5 - Burrata, Pesto, English Peas, Spinach - again tasty but nothing special\n\nPapperdelle - 5/5 - This was by far my favorite dish of the night, I highly recommend, very flavorful\n\nDuck - 4/5 - Crispy skin, tender meat, delicious - highly recommend\n\nFlourless Chococate Cake - 3/5 - very tasty but also extremely dry, if it was moist it would have been 5/5\n\nI'm glad we came here to try a restaurant I have been hearing so much about but I won't be coming back.

We grabbed a bottle of Pinot Noir and after some deliberations, decided to try the ten course chef's tasting of small plates. As plate after plate arrived for us, our conversation would be delightfully derailed by yet another fresh pairing of elements and flavors.

Even a month out, he could only get 5:15PM reservations, but it worked out well.\n\nFirst up was the bread and butter. If it was just that, we probably could have still left quite satisfied. The bread was amazing. \n\nWe shared a carafe of the white house wine and started out with the \"Deviled Egg\" and Chilled Squid Ink Noodles. The egg was an interesting interpretation, adding a lot of spices and textures to a familiar dish. While it was far from my favorite of the evening, its presentation and taste were so unique I was still thrilled. The noodles were also interesting. Slightly tangy, but without a distinct flavor present, it was exciting for my taste buds.\n\nFor our entrees, I ordered the petit filet and my bf ordered the duck. AMAZING.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there. For dessert, I ordered the float and my bf ordered the lemon angel food cake. My dessert was a treat for the eyes and stomach. My bf's dessert was just as amazing. The tartness of the lemon was nicely balanced and I don't think I've had such creative and tasty desserts before. [If it's any indication how much I loved dessert, I stumbled upon the lady responsible for Octavia's dessert creations and I follow her on Instagram now!]\n\nLooking for a lovely restaurant for dinner?

The twinkling lights and rustic/warm interior just screamed \"Christmas in San Francisco.\"\n\nAtmosphere: Refined and modern \"rugged\" typical of SF. Slightly dim lighting with candles, wood tables and hefty wood beams in the restaurant. This would be a great place for a special date or even a work dinner. The chef's table in the kitchen looks cool for that too. We had reservations at 5 pm and the place filled up completely by around 5:30/6. Not surprised though.\n\nFood: This is where the star gets knocked. We ordered the deviled egg which is more like a soft-boiled egg (still good though), salad to share (too salty), and gnocchi (very good). For the entree, I ordered the pork loin which was amazing. The pieces were thick cut and the apple butter was flavorful. The side of vegetables with curry (I think) did not mesh well with the meat, in my opinion. They were also pretty salty. A little disappointed by the saltiness of 2 of the dishes but still good.\n\nService: Attentive.

I was so looking forward to going here, but I'm thinking I just really ordered everything wrong.  \n\nWe were greeted quickly and seated right away by the hostess.  The place was lovely and very relaxing to me with the dark wood throughout.  The menu looked great and I was really excited as I've heard great things about the food.  Unfortunately, it just didn't really work for me.  I started with the oysters.  My oyster was very salty, almost briny, and may have set the tone for my meal.  The deviled egg was good, I think the highlight of my meal.  I enjoyed the sunchoke soup that my friend ordered and wish I ordered that instead of the roasted cauliflower salad, which was good as well, but I still had a salty taste in my mouth from the oyster apparently and things just tasted slightly off to me during the whole meal.  For my entree, I had the malfatti ricotta dumplings.  I guess I was thinking of some ricotta dumplings that I recently had else where, because I was disappointed at how dense these dumpling were.  I was hoping they were more on the light or fluffy side.  Dessert did help finish the meal with a high note.  The eton mess was different, but delicious.  \n\nIn regard to service, our server was ok, but we were seated next to another table of 4 that had a different server who was more engaging and entertaining.  I really wished we had him instead as our server wasn't really as engaging or descriptive as he was.  She didn't really offer much when we asked for suggestions on the menu and I noticed that the other tables were being served bread, which we eventually got after I asked her for it.  Again, she wasn't rude or anything like that, just not much initiative to offer things.  \n\nI do think Octavia is worth trying again eventually.

There was A LOT of burrata on the plate, so it's a great table share. The salad was dressed perfectly, and had persimmons and pistachios, a great accompaniment to the burrata.\n\nThe petite fillet, I drool. It was cooked perfectly and the trumpet mushrooms they cooked with the steak were so flavorful. The steak itself had a slight mushroom flavor and was seared on the outside.\n\nLastly, the dessert was possibly my favorite. The molten chocolate was perfectly baked and it had such a deep chocolate flavor. \n\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a birthday dinner, date night, or even a fun and nice dinner with friends!

Combined with the heat from the peppers, the runny yolk is just delicious. Toped with bottarga and served with fennel and lemon oil, the chilled squid ink noodles ($7) were tasty, but a little salty. With a refreshing hint of lemon, the linguine al pesto ($14) is cooked perfectly al dente and paired with winter greens, a serious helping of parmesan and fennel.\n\nThe food is great, but the staff makes the dining experience even better:  from Samantha, the hostess, to the servers and bussers, everyone is awesome.\n\nHouse wines, a Paul Hobbs sauvignon blanc and chardonnay blend and a Gros Ventre Sonoma coast pinot, are available by the glass, carafe or bottle at reasonable prices.

The dishes were of high quality, but some of them worked better than others...in particular, the artichoke was delicious - like fried chicken! The pasta dishes - first the squid ink was tasteless, and the salt cod was too firm and didn't marry well with the noodle. \n\nThe service is what pulls this rating down. It felt like nobody was coordinating the kitchen. There wasn't a sense of ownership of the dining room, nobody cared about the guests and their meal. Gaps are fine between courses, but only if the server communicates", "author": "Cate R."}

We ordered the Squash Salad, Summer Beans, and deviled egg (not really a deviled egg; just a soft boiled egg on a hot chile relish) to start. For entrees, the Polenta was outstanding!\n\nAtmosphere is very quite.

THEN my duck entree! OMG! soooo good. and i've had my fair share of delicious duck entrees. but this was cooked just so perfectly, so juicy and tender and i want to eat at least 18 more pounds of it. nod nod.  the bread they served was also great, warm with salted butter yayyy.  i'd come back again in some time..!", "author": "Christina L."}

In reality the deviled egg is a slow poached pouch of yolky goodness topped with a fresno chile creation that gave the dish some delightful spice and smoke. The roasted cauliflower was a sweet surprise with figs while the tuna had a basil Nicoise vibe. \n\nSecond course include the light a refreshing little gems with fuyu persimmons tossed in a caesaresque  dressing. Followed by a rich and decadent gulf shrimp tagliatelle, the shrimp were plumb and fresh and everything was tossed with fennel and pimento.\n\nFor the main we shared the petite filet which had been butter poached (yes that is an actual thing) for two hours and served with ciopolini. I can't even doesn't do this dish justice. Imagine a perfect tender petite filet filled magically with buttery goodness. So heavenly and relish.\n\nDessert was a chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart. Picture a crispy chocolate shell filled to the brim with pillow of rich thick chocolate.\n\nWines included a bottle of Syrah and carafe of the cab franc both paired perfectly with everything. \n\nIn all it was a memorable evening with amazing attentive service. I was not bothered by the noise level but we dined in a corner window seat which likely helped diminish the sound issue.\n\nWould I go back yes yes yes! \n\nSide note I think Judy would be adorable with a bow tie just saying!

Still somewhat new, but c'mon.\n\nThey did a great job updating the space and making it more cozy and well light with the exposed wood/rustic feel and romantic lighting.\n\nOur favorite dishes were the starters - the fried eggplant and the halibut crudo were both outstanding.  The only disappointing aspect of those dishes were how small the portions were.\n\nThe saffron tonnarelli was also good.\n\nThe deviled eggs weren't ordering (inmho).\n\nThe pork chop was good, but daunting.  They're rather generous and give you a large piece, but you realize a huge slab of it is fat and it's a huge piece of meat that covered half of the plate it's served on.. just not incredibly appetizing, and surprising given how small the starter portions are.\n\nOverall, the meal was good and I would return in a year+? The service was terrible in the sense that it took forever every step of the way.  It looked as though they had a good amount of staff working the small restaurant but literally every course we'd be left sitting with empty dishes waiting for our plates to be cleared, more bread, water please!!!, etc.  Even at the end we were trying to get out of there and they just took forever - we dined with 3 of us, 6pm reservation and we finally left around 8:45-9pm.", "author": "Melody T."}

Velvety, soft beef with a great beef jus that was both rich and subtle.\n\nCorn Soup - Chef Perello always makes a great soup.  This is no exception.  Extremely smooth, buttery corn soup with a great addition of creme fraiche.\n\nPork Chop - Well-cooked, juicy and tender medium-rare.\n\nHouse red by the carafe was pretty light and complemented most of the dishes well.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-21", "description": "Dare I say that Octavia is better than Frances. Yeah and I totally did during the entire meal. Repeatedly. A lot. And probably enough to annoy my husband but what do I care - he is married to me and stuck with me. I'll be as bold to say it's the best restaurant right now in SF (and totally better than the overhyped State Bird Provisions - which is good but not GREAT).\n\nWe tried to recap what we liked the most, so here it is in the order of MY favorites (different than my husband's):\n\nBeef tongue: Apparently beef tongue is fatty, delicate, and pulled-pork like in its consistency. It's not at all chewy. This stuff just melted in your mouth. I had no idea that beef tongue was so delicious. I was always grossed out by the concept, but this dish totally converted me into a beef tongue fiend. Forget the steaks. Cut off all their tongues and give me their milk. Also, I now have a mental note to go to fancy butcher shops and buy a lot of beef tongues to cook.\n\nChocolate torte (dessert): I thought this would be a standard fare but was feeling the idea of having dessert. I was delightfully wrong. I went to Liholiho for their baked Hawaiian (which is EXCELLENT) but this actually outdid it. It was chocolate HEAVEN. Best of all, the salted caramel melted into the hot torte... and then there were crunchy chunks of dark chocolate around it (yay for food texture!). I kept making awful jokes to my husband (that were pretty serious in nature) that I wanted to kidnap the baker and bring him/her home with us. Then lock them in a room with an oven and cocoa.\n\nRomano beans: Had thought of not getting it. So glad we got it. Flash fried so it was very lightly crispy and then there were small fried onion bits on top of it. Second favorite starter.\n\nHalibut crudo: My husband's favorite. For sushi and tartare lovers. Halibut was raw and silky, avocados were buttery and firm, and the crisps were (duh) crispy. \n\nSaffron tonarelli: Tomatoes were fresh and acidic. Saffron was present but not overwhelming. Dish had just enough oil. So good.\n\nButter beans and garlic with mushroom soup: Buttery. Creamy. Delicious.\n\nDeviled egg: Poached egg with melty yolk and a lot of hot spicy stuff. Very good. Surprised it wasn't my favorite dish - the egg specials are usually my favorite at every restaurant I go to. Goes to show the caliber of Octavia. Soooo good. This probably would have been my favorite at any other restaurant.\n\nChilled squid ink noodles: Excellent but not as memorable as the other dishes. \n\nOysters: Good.\n\nAlso the complimentary bread was served perfectly warm, the butter was fresh and light. Everything was perfect. Wine was excellent (I think it was the Tenuta 2010). Service was attentive and on pointe. Really have nothing bad to say about the restaurant. Ranking the dishes was incredibly hard. Please take all my money.", "author": "Sylvia L."}

But here the mood fits the neighborhood and the cuisine. \n\nWe had a deviled egg, which is not to be missed (we liked it so much we ordered another one one!) - it's  topped with a spicy and peppery spice mix, reminding of Yemenite Zhug in dry form, and compliment the runnyiness of the egg perfectly. \nFollowed by squid ink noodles, which had a perfect texture, with just enough hints of the ocean in taste. \n\nThe Tagliatelle was so great, my partner decreed she would divorce me and marry it instead; and I might do the same myself. \n\nThe chicken confit was the least interesting dish we had. It was still quite good, but wasn't up to par with the dishes leading to it. \n\nTo conclude, the food was amazing, the prices reasonable ($100 per person including drinks and a tip), and we are looking for an excuse to visit again.", "author": "Shay E."}

Octavia is an elegant restaurant that happens to be named after the street it lies on...Octavia! Haha\n\nMy girlfriend and I dined here on a Friday around 6pm. Surprising we got seats without a wait, though the restaurant was at capacity throughout our time here. \n\nStarters:\n\nChilled Squid Ink Noodles: This was cooked to perfection and had just the right amount of lemon oil added to it. \n\nBeef Tongue: The accompanying ingredients were roasted garlic and a marrow broth. In my opinion this was the best dish offered. I could have ordered this over and over again. 5 stars!!\n\nLocal Halibut: 4 stars. I felt as if I was having sashimi thought the avocado and chips gave it a good western feeling\n\nWhite Corn Soup: 4 stars. I have a thing for anything that contains or is made from corn. This was a great soup though it was a tad bit too creamy for my liking. \n\nSnapper: My girlfriend ordered this and thoroughly enjoyed.

The staff is attentive and friendly, and we loved our meal. My friend and I shared two starters, a salad and an entree and were deliciously full at the end.\n\nCrispy artichokes - out of this world. If they'd brought me this in a bucket, I would have had it all and called it a day.\nGrilled asparagus - I don't LOVE asparagus, but this dish was fantastic.\nSpinach salad - again, for something that could be just so-so, it was delicious.\nRibeye with charred radishes and (more) asparagus - In small places like this, sometimes you have to lower your expectations for how the steak will turn out. No need here at Octavia - this was incredible meat, perfectly cooked and seasoned. I was blown away. \n\nAs a young restaurant, there are two small things I noted that I'm sure they can work out:\n1) Timing - the pacing of our meal seemed slower than it should have been. Maybe it was deliberate, but if so they need to find a better balance between not rushing our meal and not making us wait too long between dishes.\n2) Bread service - we saw the bread basket being offered up to some tables, but never to us. We were actually fine with that, but at the end of the meal were curious why. Our waiter informed us that, like water, bread is available upon request. That made sense to us both...but unlike the water shortage, there isn't a bread shortage that everyone is aware of. Considering Octavia prints up fresh menus every day, \"Bread upon request\" could certainly be added at the bottom.", "author": "David B."}

I get that they're trying to do something different, but if you want a deviled egg, this is not going to satisfy you. Cauliflower soup was very good and filling, a little salty but still delicious. Angel food cake was also amazing but I was so full from eating all the bread that I couldn't even finish it lol.

Plan at least 30-50 a person without drinks. Plan on screaming to hear your dining companions. Plan on this place being very popular.\n\nThe food is not the most radical but that was some of the best beef tongue I've had in SF in a while outside of a Mexican restaurant.\n\nThe smaller plates were the standouts for us. The beef tongue with broccolini and a delicious broth was pure heaven with melt in your mouth tongue. The \"deviled egg\" was just one soft boiled egg in a spicy sauce, I would have loved something with a contrasting texture and $5 for one egg still kills me. The mushroom and green garlic soup was also incredibly good, it reminded me of soup in France where it has the right balance of being rich while still maintaining a lightness and airiness to the creamy soup. The Mushrooms a la Grecque was probably my least favorite dish although the portion was more condiment or snack size than starter or app size. It was not like what is common in France where the dish comes from or at least that name does but the French Spouse liked it well enough.\n\nThe French Spouse enjoyed their pasta with salt cod which they said they could make in two portion size. My quail was cooked well but it lacked salt and seasoning within the bird and on the skin. The morel and jus that came with it were the real stars but alas there was not enough of either.\n\nWe finished with a comped Panna Cotta which was delicious but a bit loose for my liking and a poppy seed angel food cake which I found quite fascinating with the crisp outside, not as sweet as most angel food cake and delightful with the berries and really good ice cream.\n\nThe non-alcoholic drinks are limited to bottled sodas, teas, espresso drinks and water.\n\nDecor: What is with restauranteurs spending money on designed and then not doing anything about sound design or accessibility? That is whack and I am seeing it more and more in places that are charging over 25 a plate.  When did being cool mean being noisy and unaccessible or perhaps it's just the market they going after. There were many many tech guys in jeans (not guessing, I literally recognized people) with skinny girls in stilletos and perfectly straighten hair as well as old fashioned older WASPs. The bathrooms and door are not wheelchair accessible. The light is poor and the sound is even worse than Alta CA.\n\nService: There were issues, not surprising for a place that has only been open a couple of weeks. There is no front host stand so there was confusion as to whether anyone had helped the people at the front door. Our server wanted to take our order without asking if we had questions or even explaining the menu which is odd since for 99 percent of the diners it was a new restaurant. There was also long gaps between course which the tables on either side of us did not experience.  I will admit I was thrilled to look in a kitchen it not be all bearded bros. It's amazing how few woman are running kitchens in SF and it would be great if that changed considering how many excellent female chefs there are.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

Don't believe the hype.\"\n- Public Enemy\n\nTo clear up non-existent widespread confusion on the topic ... in 1988, when the iconic rap group, Public Enemy, released their single \"Don't Believe the Hype,\" neither Chuck D nor Flavor Flav were referring to Octavia. \n\nThis is generally believed to be true by even the most fastidious of culinary historians. Perhaps that's because at that time Ronald Reagan was still president, Flavor Flav was a solid 24+ years from embarrassing himself on reality TV & Melissa Perello was 12-years-old. \n\nBut ... the fact that 3 generations of golden retrievers would live happy lives & die of natural causes back-to-back between the release date of that rap song & the day the James Beard winner would open her sequel to Frances, also helps verify the chronology.    \n\nAll that is to say, despite getting a semi-obnoxious amount of buzz & generally being an uppity hipster's wet dream, the menu is fresh, the food is original & Octavia is truly one of the great restaurants in San Francisco.       \n\nIf you can get a reservation.

This happened to be 2 days prior which made me nervous. None the less the online reservations was super easy and user friendly. Was able to lock in one for 930pm.\n\nWe were able to get a table, which was right next to the window and had a cool view of the fog rolling through the street. Lighting in the place was really dim, however the heavenly light from the kitchen shined over the floor as people ate what seemed to be delicious food. Making it sort of an in-kitchen eating experience. Keep in mind they do have a table in the back for larger parties as well with a very personal experience with the chefs. \n\nThe service was exceptional. Our server politely asked to hang up my jacket and kindly sat us at our table.\n\nNowwww onto the food...where to start...\nWe ordered everything on the menu, so I guess we will go over the highlights..\n\n2 Deviled Egg-Super Fresh Tasting Egg with a perfect hint of fresh chili slightly refreshing kind of heat. The chili sauce & egg yolk make for a great dip with the bread\n\nChilled Squid Ink Noodle-Def. a first for me. Very unique flavor in its own. Worth trying. Once for me though.\n\nAvocado Cream/Strawberry-I want this avocado cream on the daily. Bagels, Salads, Fish, shoot put it in a drink!!! Perfect blend with the strawberries and the freshness of the dish was perfectly balanced with textures.\n\nArtichoke and Walnut-Personally my favorite dish on the menu. Even tho is was an small plate. Wow!! The flavor!!! The walnuts and artichoke create this forest, smokey, savory taste and the cheese is the crown of it all. The way this dish melted in my mouth I wanted to order a second.\n\n-Kale Salad VS Brassica -Little over powering hints of provolone taste at the beginning and end of my bite. However it was well seasoned and perfect amount of dressing and olives. Now the Kale salad was phenomenal!! Perfectly dressed with the fennel I couldn't get enough!\n\nWhite Bean/Chanterelle Mushroom Soup-Wish it was a little hotter in my opinion, however the flavor was very very good! With crispy mushrooms at the bottom to compliment this soup was an new tasting experience for everyone at the table.\n\nDuck-Was a little to raw for my liking. Had to chew a bit to get it down. Flavor was delicious, fat was perfect flavor balance. Veggies were perfectly cooked. The carrots went great with the Duck.\n\nPetit Filet-Wow!!! Perfection!! I usually base my experience with meat from a time I had at PorterHouse some years ago. This lived up to a prefect beef taste. Cooked to perfection the Filet was served with an even seared outside leaving the middle with pink! Veggies were all cooked well.\n\nCurry-Now this was fresh!! To go back and forth between meats and then sneak this in for a bite or two was perfect! Mint stood out to compliment as well overall this was a perfect twist on a curry dish. \n\nOur experience at Octavia was exceptional. We will be back and thank the entire staff for letting us shut the place down!!", "author": "Brandon C."}

Thankfully we live nearby so we didn't leave the abode until 9:15 to walk over. \n\nThe most memorable dishes of the night were:\n\nSquid ink spaghetti: small dish but big on flavor. It may be a bit too much on the seafood flavor but I relished that. The surprising part is it is a cold dish, but that just made it feel refreshing. \n\nCauliflower salad: salt and zest combined for a very well-balanced dish. The dates with the cauliflower balanced in texture - crunch with chewiness. It's a winner!\n\nShellfish bisque: very Very big on seafood flavor, but a dish i would order all the time though I did wish it was warm. The hubby didn't like it as much so definitely not a dish for everyone. But if you love sipping the juice from a crab head, a lobster when you break into its claws, or a clam, then you'll love this bisque because it tastes as though someone gathered all those juices into a bowl. \n\nTagliatelle: this made it onto this list not because it was good, but because it was memorably disappointing. The pasta had the perfect texture but it just tasted overwhelmingly green - must be the nettles. \n\nWe also had the beet burrata, and deviled egg.

Melissa Perello has dazzled crowds for years at Frances but I've always thought it was too packed and too loud to really engage in the kind of artistic appreciation the food deserves.  Here, Perello has a lot more space, as do her patrons, and the results are impeccable in every way.\n\nIn lieu of entrees, my wife and I took the tasting route, fitting in five different smaller plates and a dessert for maximum menu coverage.  This plan proved to be a stroke of genius by the end, when we were stumped at the thought of trying to pick favorites.   The first two arrivals were a beautiful (ok, all the dishes were works of art) roasted cauliflower salad with Meyer Lemon and Medjool dates and toasted almonds.  The cauliflower was crisp outside and soft inside, and the date puree (along with a few whole dates) added a fun and sweet complement to the tart lemon.  Along with this salad, we received sauteed prawns on a flavorful, deep green bed of broccoli and cavolo nero.  The prawns were done just right, and the bowl (each piece here is handmade for the restaurant) was encircled with a stream of earthy, fabulous pumpkin seed pesto.  \n\nNext came heartier, more robust courses.  The soup started with a mound of roasted kuri squash, poured over with a creamy broth of red lentils in a fragrant Madras curry and then doused with a drizzle of whipped yogurt.  This is my kind of comfort food.  This was balanced by sharp, tangy bites of spinach tossed in rapini pesto with provolone and taggiasche olives, all topped off with crunchy garlic toasts.  Finally, another deep green delight unfolded itself with the tagliatelle constructed of stinging nettles nicely finished with grana padano, lemon, and a superb flurry of toasted bread crumbs (pangrattato) that added unique taste and texture.  \n\nSometimes a meal is so good you have to push yourself to have dessert because you know they'll just kill it, and we were right.  We received a lovely round brown-toasted angel food cake, surrounded by chunks of pink lady apple and smooth brown butter (evoking caramel) ice cream.  All about the plate were delicate traces apple sauce that helped bring everything together decadently.\n\nThere is gorgeous, rustic, natural decor abounding here, and a full open kitchen is always a treat.   The spacious area in front of the kitchen is a great stage for watching food emerge, wine (or cocktails - the house special is a real find) being delivered, and hot bread being wrapped and carried to tables.

I had the pleasure of meeting her during one of my Frances visits and she seems like a very nice, genuine, humble woman.  So, after hearing Octavia was opening in Pacific Heights, I was thrilled to plan a visit. \n\nDinner at Octavia was the evening of July 4th. Happy 4th America and happy 4th to me getting to finally try this new local gem. Upon arriving, I noticed the light airy feel of the space. I had dined in the location before when it was Banker & Baker which had a darker feel to it lacking the nice bright light and California farm to table, chabby chic esque-style the new space has. I would guess the restaurant seats approximately 35-40 people offering a nice intimate feel (about 50% more seats than found in Frances I would estimate). We were immediately welcomed by our server and walked through the menu.  She was very pleasant and informative and I quickly saw that we were in store for a fabulous visit!\n\nAfter studying the menu and taking into account what I had read thanks to Michael Bauer's review we decided we would start with the Local Halibut Crudo, sharing two entrees: The Long & Belly Pork Chop and the Saffron Tonnarelli (an appetizer portion so I'd recommend two if you plan to share as Entr\u00e9e).\n\nI have to admit as a wine enthusiast (and student since I've recently started taking classes including California and Italian specializations) I was surprised by the Wine List. We had mentioned to our server we would like a full body, fruit forward California red (take note readers that's my FAVORITE type of red wine!). This is a typical request, especially for a California Red Wine list.  We were told there were many similar options, however, they were French and not California. As local California residents eating California cuisine, we were hoping to enjoy California Wine with our lovely dinner. I took a peek after the visit and the only by the glass California wine is a Sonoma Coast Chardonnay (yum). I'm still curious about the Wine selection and why there isn't a full body fruit forward California wine? Anyone else agree with me on this?\n\nAs for the food selections, I have no such complaint. We were in heaven with delicious menu options, especially once we discovered there was house-made bread.

I assume this is intended to make things easier for the kitchen on such a busy night, but given the high tariff, I do not believe the restaurant should be held to a different set of standards than any other night.\n\nThat's why it was so disappointing to be served a meal in which not a single one of my three courses - a seafood bisque, a gnocchi, and a beef dish with petit filet and short ribs - was delivered hot.  Each dish was lukewarm at delivery, which meant that even though I consumed each dish as rapidly as could be expected of anyone in a fine-dining restaurant, each dish was cold before I finished it.\n\nWhen I consider that I can order food at home from Sprig' and have it delivered from God-knows-where and arrive piping hot, it should not to too much to expect food delivered from the other side of the room to similarly arrive hot.\n\nI should note that my partner only complained about the lukewarm soup: his other two courses were apparently hot.  The service was fine, as would have been the dishes themselves if I had not had to consume them at a breakneck pace to try to finish them before what little heat was there disappeared. \n\nIt left me feeling a bit like my food had been mass-prepared and scooped out of a cafeteria bin.  (And perhaps it was.). I did not complain to my server, as I didn't really want to wait while my food was taken away and microwaved; it wasn't inedible or gross, it just wasn't hot.  I'd expected more from the folks behind Frances, and for $90. Probably won't return.\n\nI'm wavering between two and three stars.

I had expectations set at roughly 112.7 out of 10 since Yelpers have been hyping this place up since it replaced Baker and Banker a few years ago. Sad to say, the dinner experience was mundane and frankly a little underwhelming. \n \nOverall - 3.5 stars out of 5\n\nFood (3/5) \n\n- Deviled Eggs. The egg itself was cooked well, trademarked by delicious runny yolk the moment you cut into it. Unfortunately, the seasoning ruined the dish for me. It was this weird tangy, salty, peppery concoction that I can only describe as a spicier version of Mexican candy. The seasoning also gave the dish a grainy texture, kind of like when you eat hardboiled eggs but pour too much salt on top.\n\n- Squid Ink Noodles. Good, not great. Tapas sized so it only yielded about two bites per person. The noodles themselves had good texture and taste. It is served with this white cream sauce that is citrusy. This dish is served cold, which is different.\n\n- Steak Tartare. Middle of the road for me. There's nothing that is inherently wrong with the dish, just that you can pretty much find something of equal or better quality and taste at any higher end establishment in the city.\n\n- Beef Ribeye. This was probably the best dish out of the bunch. Cooked medium rare, the meat has melt in your mouth texture and has a nice hint of gaminess. \n\nAmbiance (4.5/5) - Good overall. I would describe the decor as contemporary rustic. The restaurant is split between two tops for those on Tinder date #5 and four tops for folks at dinner with friends. You can actually hear those sitting across the table without having to shout, so that's a plus.\n\nService (5/5) - Server was helpful choosing dishes and was attentive without being too in your face.\n\nValue (1/5) - Dinner plus 2 glasses of wine and tip ran just south of $200. I think this is the biggest issue I have not only with Octavia, but a majority of higher end dining in SF. Had the food been transcendent, then okay whatever, I'll pay the price of admission to play.

The space that once housed Quince and Baker and Banker has transformed into the lovely and rustic Octavia. The restaurant has barely been open a couple weeks but we thought it was running smoothly. No one seemed to be waiting on reservations and most of the tables were filled. The room is casually elegant yet intimate. The dishware is custom made for Octavia and complement the feel of the room. \n\nWe ordered the squid ink pasta, hen of the wood mushrooms, grilled asparagus and beef tongue as our small plates. The beef tongue was so delicately savory and the squid ink noodles brought the perfect mix of salt, tang and heat. For entrees, we tried the quail and pacherri with cod. The quail was the meatiest and moistest quail we've every tasted and packed a lot of flavor. The pacherri had great sauce that I wish I had more of. \n\nFor dessert the standout dish was the chocolate souffl\u00e9 tart. It is like a molten chocolate cake encased in a chocolate crumb crust and presented on a bed of warm caramel and caramel ice cream.

No thanks.\n\nMy boyfriend waited out front before opening on a Sat night in hopes of getting a two-top within the hour or so (no reservation). Upon entering the restaurant, he was literally looked up and down by the waitress as well as the front of house manager. Apparently jeans and a button up is considered underdressed at the five o'clock hour? \n\nThe manager quoted him close to four hours without any reassurance and without eye contact. Please note that more than half the restaurant was empty and it was early on a Sat evening- 5:00pm. \n\nI was walking over from a local community clinic that I volunteer at. When I heard the rundown of what had occurred, I was disgusted. I understand that we didn't have a reservation, but to not even attempt to be accommodating?

Found street parking just down the corner.\n\nSourdough bread:  5 stars.  Simply amazing bread - crisp exterior with dense, moist and chewy interior.  And they salt the butter.

Not sure the ink taste was prominent, but might be a good thing for most people.\n\nLittle gems salad:  2 stars.  Wonderfully fresh produce/greens but dressing was underwhelming.  Not worth it unless you really need roughage or veggies for the day.\n\nDeviled egg:  1 star.  A very expensive soft boiled egg.  It LOOKS like it would be amazing but flavor is just ok. \n\nSweet Onion Soup:  4 stars.  Wow.  Not an overpowering onion flavor at all, and the hint of sweetness was nice.  Creamy soup topped with creme fraiche, so rich and calorie dense.\n\nCrab pasta:  4 stars.  Delicious but definitely scant on the crab.  I had maybe 1 1/2 claws, and I mean just the claw part, not the entire appendage.  Enough pasta thought for an entree (with the above appetizers, of course.\n\nDuck:  4 stars.  Well prepared duck.  Husband loved it.\n\nToasted angel cake dessert:  5 stars.  A perfect ending - light, minimally sweet.  Elder flower ice cream was delicious - not floral at all.  Cake was crusted with sugar on two sides so it was lightly sweet and crisp.  \n\nONE PROBLEM:  \n\nDon't come early.  We came 20 minutes early for our 7:30pm time, so we were standing in the servers' aisle, plastered against the window.

Squid ink noodles (chilled): it's a small portion, but it's perfect for 2 people to share since it can be pretty intense \n\nAs always, I love their warm bread and salted butter.  My boyfriend actually enjoyed this more than the Animal Farm butter we had at Per se last week.\n\nOther dishes:\n1. Delicata squash: lightly breaded and fried (unexpected), but the burrata and pipian verde (almost tasted like guacamole) made the dish \n2. Little gems: if you like fuyu persimmons, it's good. I liked the sunchoke for the fall \n3. Iacopi butter bean and parmesan soup: very wonderfully cheesy. It was rich and had leaves of baby kale, and the grilled levain croutons had a great char on them. \n4. Tagliatelle: with pesto, winter geens, fennel, and meyer lemon. The lemon was a nice touch.  \n5. Petite Filet: a very generous portion for $35, but I wasn't blown away by the beef. The trumpet mushrooms and toasted barley were actually the highlights for me. \n6. Gulf snapper: perfectly cooked, but the best parts of the dish were the roasted Japanese eggplant and charred early girl tomatoes, which had so much intense flavor\n\nDesserts: \n1. Chocolate souffle tart: I got this last time, and again, I love the outer crust of the souffle and the generous portion of salted caramel ice cream \n2. Wildflower honey crumb pudding: kind of like a spiced loaf with quince and creme fraiche; our friends who got this didn't love it\n\nAt times, we felt rushed on service when they kept trying to clear our plates before we were done, and one of the servers seemed distracted and a bit annoyed when we asked for pepper, but overall, service was ok. \n\nI do appreciate that they change their menu a bit more than Frances, but I like that they keep some favorites on the menu.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-08-28", "description": "For a start of my birthday weekend, Octavia comes to mind as my first choice to kick off this weekend. Having seen but not tasted some of the dishes served up at Octavia makes me very curious to try out the replacement of what used to Bakers and Bankers.  \n\nWe arrived a few minutes early and let the dinner crashers in first since we already have our reservation. At first glance, I do admire the beautiful space of the restaurant and get excited to be seated. Having been one of the first few patrons of the day's dinner service, it was brave of me to even tried to ask for the table by the window but the server informed me that the table for two was currently being reserved for a party of 6, since we were there early enough and had no plan of holding up the table, I asked if the waiter would check again. I guess I was being too bold to even ask because I was immediately met by the man who works as the day's host who as soon as he walked up to me said, \"That space is reserved for 2 people who've requested for that space already. So I can either seat you here or there.\" So now the store's changed, not only was the table reserved for the party of 6, it's now for 2 and these two wanted this table also but not here yet. \n\nI was stunned at the tone and arrogance of this guy who was supposed to be the front of the house host and stared at him for a few minutes; trying make a decision whether to turn around and walk out and immediately he followed with, \"so, we can stand here and have a staring contest or you can choose a table?\" Wow, since when does it make one deserving of being talked to like a child? Not a good sign, but I didn't feel like letting this arrogant man host ruin my night and ruin my dinner, I chose another table. Having done so, this same man still continued to run his mouth saying \"...always have to wrestle someone every night about that table.\" \"Wrestle\" Your patrons are not some sort of children or wild animal you have to wrestle into a seat, really??? I thought, another bad sign.\n\nSo I ignore the arrogance and the attitude of this host, perhaps he's poorly paid, perhaps he's going through a divorce, perhaps it has been his manifesto to be disrespectful to his patrons, who knows, at this point, I just want to sit down and have a meal. \n\nWe tried the famed and very photogenic chilled squid ink noodle and the Halibut Crudo to start and the chilled squid ink noodle was nice, lemony and refreshing, but it might be just me but I would have preferred this warm as the consistency of the noodle was a bit off being chilled and broken up instead of chewy. The Halibut Crudo was fresh, well seasoned and well complemented by the sweetness of the melon that kept me wanting more.\n\nFor our mains, we had the King Salmon and the Pork Chop. The King Salmon was cooked perfectly but the vegetable or grains were way over-salted to the point where we couldn't even finish the rest. I did inform the server of the level of overpowering saltiness when the server checked in on us and nothing, he didn't say anything. What again is the point of checking in on your patron's experience? To elicit the canned \"oh everything's great?\" \n\nAs for the Pork Chop, it was not memorable. The dish was constructed of a whole large hunk of bone-in pork chop that was tender but not anything spectacular. Nopa's pork chop would still kill this one any day. \n\nWe cleaned our palate with the Nectarine Float which was the star of this dinner experience. The unsweetened fizzy Lavender water acted as the liquid within which the fresh Nectarine and Nectarine sorbet floated in amalgamation with a scoop of perfectly creamy and tart ricotta cheese. Wow, what a refreshing and effervescent experience of a dessert! This one is a must try for sure. \n\nAnyway, Octavia, I may try you again in the future but really do hope I don't have to deal with the arrogant and disrespectful host who seems to really hate dealing with a patron's request for a table. It is possible he might be ignorant of how tack goes a long way when communicating a negative response to a request but I'm not here to make excuses for this kind of behavior. \n\nA good restaurant is represented in the way it's food is made and the level of care of this process just as much as how its staff treats the patron and this 3 star is a fair representation of the whole experience at Octavia tonight.", "author": "Taffany H."}

I really cannot believe that a Michelin Star restaurant can really mess up on the entr\u00e9e. Everything was going well prior though. From the time we first enter the restaurant to the very hospitable host that made sure we were taken care of. One thing to note is that their home baked sourdough is fantastic. It's warm and soft in the middle and has a crunch to it around the crust. I know their menu changes on a seasonal basis, so it's not a surprise that some of the photos and menu items that you are seeing on Yelp do not align with the current menu. I really want to love this place and I genuinely enjoyed everything from the atmosphere to the appetizers, but do not order their steak. You will get a piece of meat that is very chewy, but very hard to shallow. I almost choked on the piece because it was impossible to break up the pieces and cut. The host was very attentive and asked how my steak was and they were able to replace it with another appetizer (corn soup). Again, order their appetizers because it will be your best bet.", "author": "David H."}

I wanted to order everything but I didn't. Started off with deviled egg. It's very simple. A soft boiled egg with tons of red pepper flakes. It was really missing the creamy component. I wish it had like creme fraiche. Halibut crudo, beef tongue, and chilled squid ink noodle were all decent but all these plates are super small to where there isn't more than a bit per person if you brought a date. If you was to get a salad, avoid the little gem salad. It is just lettuce wedges. Highlight of the meal was the corn soup (must get!). Creamy and screams corn. Shared the ribeye. Sad but that meat took about +20 minutes after our last dish and one side of it was charred and well done. I asked for medium rare! Didn't complain because I couldn't wait another +20 minutes. Just sliced off all the super charred edges and moved on. If I ever come back, I would avoid the entree all together and just order appetizers and do it tapas style.", "author": "Kien M."}

Basically, everything a contemporary, casual restaurant should be. \n\nI made it here for date night after months of scheduling snafu. While awaiting the date, the restaurant even managed to snag a Michelin star so I knew there was going to be some semblance of standard to be met coming in. But boy, were they met, and then some.\n\nFirst, the space is warm and inviting. Warm, soft lighting fills the open space, with rustic decor, and the hum of happy conversation fills the air. The wine list is both creative and playful in its descriptions of its wines making even less well known vintages and terroirs feel like they're just around the corner. The full bottles of tap and complimentary sparkling water are always much appreciated. Heck, I even loved the antique styled (if a little too light in the hand), cutlery.\n\nThen there's the food. Oh my god the food. Started off with the levain bread which was warm and hearty. Then for starters we had the cauliflower with fig and almonds. I am obsessed with dishes that eat well i.e. taste amazing but also perfectly balance texture and bite on the palate. This one did just that. The deviled egg was perfectly runny with a touch of spicy flare. The tonarelli with gulf shrimp was to die for: the pasta, al dente and the shrimp fresh and cooked not a second past perfect. Then, I had the duck with olive tapenade which was again, perfectly executed. We finished off the meal with a decadent chocolate souffle tart with salted caramel ice cream, familiar yet unique in its delivery of a plethora of chocolate textures. \n\nThis is without a doubt one of the best meals I've had all year. I left feeling extremely full and satisfied. Octavia is thoughtful in every detail (down to the scent of the hand soap), impeccably flavored and perfectly cooked. I hope to come back again soon.", "author": "Mark D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2016-01-18", "description": "If this restaurant experience weren't such a massive, massive disappointment I might have given it three stars but given the expectations I brought to dinner at this joint it simply fails on so many fronts that I can't give it more.  Ironically, if I were to deconstruct the elements - the food, the service, the ambiance - it might deserve more but in this case the whole is less than the sum of its parts.\n\nLet's start at the beginning: my wife and I went there in celebration of my birthday.  We'd been to Frances, the younger and much hipper sister of this restaurant and really enjoyed it so we were looking forward to a very special evening.  We were greeted in fine fashion and seated promptly (a restaurant in San Francisco that honors reservations?  maybe I should have been suspicious).  Anyway, the maitre'd took our coats, took our wine, seated us and turned us over to a very pleasant server, who was both attentive and unobtrusive - a great start.  The table next to us was occupied by a family enjoying a quiet meal - this was soon to change but more on that later.\n\nThe first course arrived promptly.  My wife liked her cauliflower salad quite a bit and I thought the flavors in the shellfish broth were outstanding - or they would have been had they been other than lukewarm, at best.  Oh, well - the shrimp beignets were outstanding. And the bread?  Out of this world!  But now the wheels start to come off the bus.\n\nI'd say, conservatively, we had 45 minutes between finishing the first course and the arrival of the mains.  You know what happens when you have that long, with bread and wine, between courses?  Right: you lose your appetite.  By the time the mains arrived we were dying to be impressed and not caring at all.  But wait - there's more: I ordered the duck, which arrived cut into thick slabs (duck should be sliced thinly) and stone cold (duck should be warm, yanno). It was served on a bed of kale, persimmons and carrots, which was simply weird and didn't work well at all.  My wife's fish, snapper, was served on a bed of black rice and tapenade, which overpowered the fish and worked even less well.  In short the mains were just a mess of flavors, none of which were complimentary.\n\nWhat about the noise, you ask?  Well, after the family left they were replaced by a table full of stereotypes who bleated away in a shrill, atonal cacophony that brought into high relief the fact that the walls, tables, floors - every surface, in fact - was hard, reflective and unforgiving.  \n\nSo, couple together terrible food service, muddled and confusing food that couldn't seem to be served at the proper temperature and a noise profile that went from soft to extreme in seconds and you have a recipe for an unpleasant evening.  A shame, really, because individually the components could have worked but thrown together and it was a disappointing disaster.  We won't go back.", "author": "robert l."}

She had wanted to try Octavia so we took a 5:30 pm reservation, which was available. We were well greeted and quickly seated at at table against a side wall. The tables are a beautiful natural wood, thick and sturdy and the dish ware, at least some of which is crafted for the restaurant by an obviously gifted ceramicist, is beautiful. But despite some high points along the way, the experience went downhill from there. \n\nThe waiter, who ran down the menu, was rather abrupt and cool, snobbish is the vernacular. He wanted us to order all at once, rather than start with the deviled egg while we reviewed and discussed the menu. So we complied. We made our selections, which we decided to share and have served family style. \n\nThe wine list is robust, with a wide selection, but as one who lives in the provinces so to speak, in Sonoma County, the prices were very high. We gave him our order and then asked about wine, saying we were looking for something light that might match our order and that we had just come from an intensive tasting of big Italian wines (the Slow Wine event). He said something to the effect, well this (his suggestion) is French and the tone implied that meant better than Italian. The comment turned us sour on the waiter. But we took his suggestion, which proved to be good. The 2012 Domaine Jean Claude Regnaudot PINOT NOIR 'Les Clos Roussots' 1er Cru Maranges France, in 500 ML carafe for $44 was perfect for our diverse array of dishes. \n\nThe meal started with two tiny dishes: a Deviled Egg ($3.50) with some fresno chili relish. It was cooked very well, with a wet yoke in the center, but warm still. A nice way to begin. The egg was delivered with Roasted CAULIFLOWER Salad, Meyer Lemon, Medjool Date, Toasted Almond ($7.50). It was perhaps the best dish of the evening. Nice contrasts between the roast vegetable and the date. The dressing was not too lemony, but had creaminess to it that made it long on the palette. A short wait later and we received the SHELLFISH BISQUE, Shrimp Boulettes, Espelette, Lime & Cr\u00e8me Fra\u012bche ($12) and the Stinging Nettle TAGLIATELLE, Grana Padano, Meyer Lemon, Pangrattato ($14). This where the meal crashed. Both were too salty and the bisque tasted too much like crab guts. It was overpowering. Both Tiffany and I have eaten and made plenty of shellfish soups and this was simply too strong. We did not finish it despite the fact that we split one bowl. The Nettle dish was also way over salted and killed what would have been a delicious dish. It was beautiful to look at, but I could not fathom wanting more than the first moderate helping I took. I think Tiffany found it more acceptable to her taste, but agreed it was over salted. We ended the meal with the Five-Dot Ranch PETIT FILET, Toasted Farro, Cipollini Onion, Trumpet Mushroom ($35). It was actually also very good. I love farrow and it was cooked to perfection as were the onions, mushrooms and the medium-rare filet, which was cut into three narrow ovoid tubes, perhaps four or five inches long. \n\nSo, three of five dishes were good, the wine perfect for the meal, but the snobbish head waiter and two bad dishes, given the price ($157 all in for basically one full meal) would make it hard for me to return, given the many great places in the city. Too bad, because it is a beautiful restaurant and I really like Melissa Perello's food and her other wildly popular place, Frances.", "author": "Michael D."}

They would not allow for anything else. Furthermore, they continued to argue justifying that it was on the fine print on Open Table's website.

Chef Melissa Perello has opened a sister restaurant, Octavia, at long last.  The new place is on the site of the recently closed Baker and Banker but has been given a remodel.  The room is light and airy, tables are well-spaced, and there is an open kitchen so it is possible to see the magic as it is getting prepared.  And the new place has that most essential of all things, Chef Perello.  Simply put, she has a deft touch with food; her plates are all well-considered and come together beautifully.\n\nI started with a small plate of chilled squid ink noodles with bottarga, lemon oil and green garlic.  I can't say how many times squid ink noodles have disappointed, generally because the taste of squid ink just wasn't there. Here, the noodles tasted of squid ink and the dish was complex and assertive with the addition of the other components.  Lovely food.\n\nNext, a gift from the chef: morel mushrooms over toast.  Here is a quick review: Yum and thank you chef.\n\nA salad of little gems with blue cheese, grilled red onion, ramps and buttermilk was complex although the taste of the little gems was a bit overwhelmed by everything else.  I think the onions were a bit much for the greens.\n\nFinally, a main of halibut with bintje potatoes, ramps and green garlic fumet was perfection.  Halibut is so easy to ruin, but here the seafood was perfectly cooked but not overcooked.  The potatoes were a revelation and the broth in which the seafood was nestled brought everything together.\n\nI would be remiss if I failed to mention that the pricing for this wonderful meal was modest.  A bargain meal in San Francisco.", "author": "David D."}

I've been a huge fan of Frances, and somehow Chef Melissa Perello has managed to surpass all expectations with Octavia.\n\nThe restaurant was full when we arrived, and yet, while \"busy,\" the energy was far from frenetic or stressful --I would describe it as more of an upbeat, harmonious vibe, which I later attributed to the incredible way the staff just worked together; like so well, that I needed to note that. I also learned, from talking with our waiter, that Chef Perello's own style in the kitchen seems to be rather zen, which made complete sense as the atmosphere in the dining area as well as the food preparation and presentation was, to me, just flawless.\n\nAs for the food itself... I'm running out of amazing adjectives here; I was just dumbfounded. The flavors and textures were so amazingly well thought-out... and clever! \nMy friend and I tried quite a few dishes. The beef tongue in marrow broth (and anyone turned off by eating tongue will thank me if they get over it just once to try this dish) was so tender you could cut into it with a spoon. The \"soubise\" was a frothy, creamy onion soup with maitaki mushrooms and a \"pistachio pesto\", and I don't think I've ever had a more delightful soup. The \"deviled egg\" (in quotes because it's not the conventional deviled egg) was a perfectly done, peeled, soft-boiled egg with chile relish and spices --and while I'm not much for spicy, the flavors Chef Perello chose just worked so well together.\n\nYet after all that, the highlight for me was my quail entr\u00e9e, with morel mushrooms and spinach. I'm getting a little teary-eyed because I loved this so much! My friend ordered the halibut, and that too was extremely well-prepared.\n\nThe one downside to the evening was our own doing: we left literally no room for dessert. As it was my birthday, someone on staff decided that would not do, and we were brought out two chocolate biscuits topped with sea salt, and it was just perfection.\n\nThe decor was a simple country rustic, borrowing from what I knew from Frances, but perhaps up a notch. I absolutely loved everything about Octavia, and would go here again in a heartbeat.", "author": "Gregor K."}

I initially had thought the deviled egg was cooked sous vide but it turns out it was only soft boiled (and peeled extra carefully). Our server was also very friendly to us and the surrounding tables. Everyone seemed to have a fantastic time speaking with her. The only area of improvement would be the environment. It felt casual and had the feeling of a bazaar.

The eggplant was very comforting and warm, and the hallibut was incredibly refreshing.  We couldn't pick a \"favorite\" becuase they were both so delicious!  \n\nWe then shared the tonnarelli pasta and the corn chowder soup.  Again, both were executed wonderfully.  The tonnarelli was just the right amount of food for an \"in between\" course.  The soup was a lot of food!  I have a feeling I will crave it on any cold day--it was comforting and well executed.  \n\nFor the main course, we had ricotta dumplings and the ribeye.  Again, both were great, but both were larger than we anticipated!  The ribeye was probably the most disappointing part of the entire meal, but only because it was a good steak that didn't stand out among all of the other dishes.  \n\nWe ended with the chocolate tart, which our server insisted that we have.

Came in today to an almost empty restaurant and without a look of recognition or even a hint of a smile to matre'd tells me he is fully booked and had only a few tables reserved for walk ins. Ummm that's what I am... I told him I've come in here before and that I was planning on a quick bite and would be on my way in about twenty. He tells me he's sorry. Flat faced. So in my opinion a feeding establishment should be accommodating within reason, inviting and friendly in addition to good food. If you fail the first three the last is pretty much moot.", "author": "Kriszti D."}

We got oysters and the deviled egg to start.  both were fantastic, the deviled egg had a nice spicy kick!  Next we got the trout and the kale salad.  The trout and cream cheese was so rich and creamy, when eaten with the potatoes it was absolutely perfect.  The kale salad had one of the best dressings I've ever had.  For our main dishes, we got the duck and the ricotta dumplings.  I'd been wanting the ricotta dumplings ever since seeing them on the menu and they were everything I'd hoped for.  They were simple, yet delicious.  The duck was perfectly done and wonderfully tender.  Overall, everything we had tasted amazing.  Every item seemed like something that I would get if I went to dinner at the chef's house.  They were not in your face or trying to impress you, just amazing dishes cooked to perfection.

The atmosphere is comfy, beautiful stoneware dishes and good service.  We ordered their\" handmade bread\"@ $8 per serving along with other appetizers to start with.  We received 3 slices of bread and a small heel.  When I asked the waiter if we could have another slice of bread for there were 4 of us, he informed us we would have to place another order to receive the additional bread . Thus was the beginning of the end of our visit there. The food was well sourced, cooked well but for these prices $$$ incredibly BLAND AND BORING.  We had the pork chop, halibut steamed well but just sat in a pool of hoisin sauce.  I did not find the food different or interesting , rather it is much like most of these new restaurants .  They're all the same.  Overdone, overpriced and over hyped.just because you're spending bucks doesn't translate to over the top food. Screw the top 100. Eating out should not be a pretentious event.  I'm saving my $$$ for those restaurants that knock my socks off and sticking with the tried and true authentic restaurants that provide good food, good service, welcoming atmosphere.  That is why these restaurants, have returning customers.", "author": "Stephanie M."}

All the staff seemed too busy to pay attention to their patrons and were rather unfriendly.  My husband and I use to dine at Baker & Banker frequently before they closed.  What had set Baker & Banker aside from other restaurants was that the owners would always make an effort to stop by and greet every table. The atmosphere always felt warm  versus Octavia seemed cold and pretentious.  Our server never once checked in to ask how we liked the dishes.  No one offered to take our coats when we sat down and no one said bye or thanked us for dining there even though we left a nice tip despite the poor service and mediocre food quality.  One would consider coming back to give it another chance but why bother when there are plenty of actual good restaurants in the city that do live up to their reputation.", "author": "Lisa W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-29", "description": "I'd give 5 stars for the food and service but am deducting a star for the crazy uncomfortable chairs and the bathroom situation.\n\nFood & Service:\n\nThe food was absolutely delicious and I appreciated the innovative farm to table approach. It's just as good as Frances, which I also love, and the portions are huge. The chilled tomato soup with garlicky croutons and burrata was so refreshing and tasted of summer, yet it was hearty enough to feel like a substantial appetizer. I loved how the server poured the soup over the croutons so that they retained some crispiness and texture. I also tried the tonarelli (pasta) appetizer which was cooked perfectly al dente and also featured tomatoes and saffron - amazing. Everyone at our table loved their entrees as well - the grits with corn, ricotta and trumpet mushrooms were so decadent and cheesy and delicious and the blistered padron peppers cut the creaminess with some spice. Salmon was cooked to perfection as well. For dessert we shared the nectarine and angel food cake (heaven) and the chocolate tart w/salted caramel ice cream which disappeared almost as soon as it hit the table (yum). We were so stuffed! \n\nOur waiter was incredibly attentive and well versed on all of the dishes on the menu and steered us in the right direction when we had questions about which dishes to go with. It was the perfect balance of attentiveness but also leaving us alone enough to chat without constant interruption. The meal was paced in a relaxed way so that we didn't feel rushed and I really appreciated the fact that we could linger and talk, which is what fine dining is all about. It's a pet peeve of mine when restaurants try to turn tables too quickly and Octavia did a great job making us feel taken care of. The bread was great, I do wish it had been offered before we ordered our appetizers rather than during/after we finished them, but other than that everything from food/service perspective was pretty perfect.\n\nOther: \nI don't think I've ever complained about a restaurant chair before but the chairs here are crazy uncomfortable. They are so shallow they might as well have been designed for a child. Even the person who was 5'2\" in our group felt like the chair was ending in a really uncomfortable position, so I can't imagine how a guy who is over 6 feet would feel in these. It appeared that the back row of tables had better chairs (wicker ones that looked deeper) but the black ones in the front of the house were ridiculous. I perched on my seat like I was falling forward the entire night and no one in our group could put their feet flat on the ground as it was too uncomfortable on the legs.\n\nAlso, there is only 1 bathroom stall for restaurant patrons and staff to share. Ugh. It is also placed right by the kitchen in a teeny tiny corner so you have to stand in the way of the servers in an awkward line while you wait and there was always a line because 1 bathroom is simply not enough for 50 people. This is not something I associate with fine dining and does not echo the level of service or quality of food - which were both outstanding - at the restaurant.", "author": "Britt M."}

The seed bread they served was excellent and wonderfully moist inside.  The entrees (salmon and rib eye, respectively) were good, but perhaps continue two somewhat unfortunate dinning trends.  Often, kitchens seem a little more conservative on the main than the smaller dishes, and that was the case here.  Secondly, my wife's rib eye was at least twice the size of my salmon, which is another typical and unfortunate restaurant trend.  Who are the people who think that 4 or perhaps 6 ounces of salmon is a portion?  Clearly, the same people don't expect 4 ounce portions of steak!  This is nothing unique to Octavia, but I was particularly struck at the persistence of this trend in the dinning scene.  \n\nSorry for the digression, but dessert was also very good, we found a nice red wine, and the house vermouth cocktail was surprisingly good given that it was only vermouth and Octavia lacks any liquor.\n\nSo, absolutely a very good place and one that I would return to, and probably priced about right considering food and atmosphere.", "author": "Richard P."}

We told our waiter we were concerned about timing for our main course, but he again assured us we would be fine. 20+ minutes later we had to go and told the manager that we had to go.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-23", "description": "For a Michelin-rated restaurant at this price point, Octavia was very disappointing.  Here's a quick summary:\n\n- The roasted cauliflower salad was delicious and things were off to a great start\n- The turnip greens salad was interesting.  It's not something we would order again but I could see it being an acquired taste.\n- The gulf snapper was very good; however, as a $30+ entree I was expecting something more memorable.  The filet was relatively small, and it's not a dish I would go back for, especially not at this price. \n- The duck breast is where things took a turn for the worst.  Our server told us the chef recommended medium rare.  The meat was so chewy, it was almost inedible.  My guest barely touched it, and I swallowed a piece after chewing for 2 minutes.  We asked for a to-go bag (more on this below).  Our waiter should have asked if everything was ok, but he didn't.\n- For dessert, we ordered their \"specialty,\"  the warm Chocolate Souffl\u00e9 TART.  I'm sure it's good when it isn't burnt-- it was so dry and hard it was difficult to cut with a fork.  We told our server and he removed it from our bill.  He seemed surprised. \n- After we paid, we were not given our to-go bag with duck and had to seek out someone near the kitchen to find it for us.  The next night, I cooked the duck on a cast-iron skillet and it was much better and actually chewable.\n\nOverall, a very disappointing experience.  A restaurant like this needs to be amazing every night.  They shouldn't make mistakes like serving a burnt dessert.  And whoever is recommending the duck at medium rare must have really sharp teeth.", "author": "Andrew E."}

We were pretty frustrated by the time we sat down. We ordered the porcini panade and chicken confit as entrees and were not disappointed: great flavors, beautiful presentation. We were, however, underwhelmed with the deviled egg (what's all the hype??), the safron fettucini, and the beef tartare. We were excited to try a non-traditional dessert - the honey crumb cake - but were ultimately unsatisfied, because the mildly-sweetened cake was lost in the sea of cream.

This would be a gem if this was just an ordinary under the radar restaurant serving new American food. But because there is a lot of hype of food sourcing and chef pedigree, it is very expensive and the servings are quite small. Would only be a regular if the prices were in half. And there is nothing super special to be a \"special occasion\" place.", "author": "Dylan Y."}

The service was excellent, the decor very comfortable, but the food was just o.k.. I am a chef and receiving a Michelin Star is a big deal in my mind. This means the food needs to be the best of the best and it just wasn't. We started with some oysters which were fine, but not special. Then, we had a few of the signature dishes- \"deviled\" egg and cold squid ink noodles. The egg was o.k., but lacked salt and was over-seasoned with both dry and one-note chilies on the bottom. The Squid Ink noodles were interesting, but probably would be more enjoyable at room temperature than chilled.  The Chanterelle mushroom soup was probably the strongest dish, but had the odd addition of artichoke hearts instead of sauteed mushrooms in the bottom. I think even charred spring onions or carmelized shallots would have been better. The duck breast was also quite good. Just to be thorough, we also had the pasta with duck confit, the red trout, the honey crumble and the orange float which was interesting. The other odd part was the presence of citrus in so many dishes. I realize it is seasonal, but with such a limited menu, you would expect less of certain types of ingredients. Finally, let me just say that the technical skills and presentation were excellent, but the flavors were not quite as exciting as I would from a Michelin rated restaurant.", "author": "dan s."}

Located at the old Banker and Baker location on a residential corner in Lower Pac Heights, there won't be as many people walking by to check it out and put their name down, such as Rich Table in Hayes Valley. But their restaurant does fill up. Back to why the restaurant is one of my favorites, it boils down to the food. Location is not ideal, ambience is nice but a tad chilly on a cold day but the food is exceptional. While the menu is seasonal and changes on a regular basis, they do have staples and one of their staple dishes is the chilled squid ink noodles. Super refreshing with the amount of citrus they use. I also had the cauliflower appetizer which was scrumptious. The pasta dish was my least favorite of everything, but still really good! Lastly, I shared the duck and steak entrees which were my favorites. My date and I assumed the meat was sous vide then grilled since it was so tender so we asked the waitress to confirm our hypothesis. Wrong, no sous vide, just plain old fashion grilling by the owner chef. Damn, that was good.", "author": "Kai C."}

We were in the way of the runners at some points, which I'm sure was really annoying, but they all just went with it and were very accommodating. Our server was great too. The food was all very good - the squid ink pasta and halibut were standouts. So very good. The strawberry short cake-like desert was also quite delicious. For the combination of good food and great service, I will definitely be back. And for a small celebration (max 12 guests), their chef's table is definitely a venue to consider.", "author": "Missy S."}

We've eaten at Frances and had high expectations for her new restaurant. We weren't disappointed. Parking on street was moderately easy to find on a Tues night and the nearby J-town garage was our backup. We were warmly greeted upon entering and shown to our table right away. Service was friendly and attentive. We ordered the mixed green salad with buratta, smoked trout, duck, ricotta dumplings, angel food cake, and crumb pudding. Everything was delicious with the duck being the standout dish of the night. Dessert came with candles to celebrate our anniversary. Such a nice touch!", "author": "tina l."}

Every course was such an enjoyable experience and the natural style Pinot noir we tried was a perfect complement (not too smack-you-in-the-face barnyardy). The squid ink noodles with bottarga was unbelievably delicious and savory. Just a heads up, the appetizers are on the smaller side, but that just means you can try more things. We had the deviled egg (one each), the squid noodles, the greens, and the malfatti ricotta dumplings (malfatti means misshapen, not \"badly made\" as I had translated it, these dumplings are the OPPOSITE of badly made. They are extremely well made. I don't speak Italian SHUSH.) and that was plenty for two people. That didn't stop us from getting dessert though, thank god, because the rocky road eton mess was so alarmingly delicious I seriously regretted choosing to share it. There wasn't a single misstep throughout the meal, except for maybe when a waiter asked if I would like more bread, and having not finished my first piece I declined, and then she cleared our bread plates and swept away with my last piece of bread, and I shed a small tear, but lbr I probably didn't need it anyway. Oh, and the price of everything, even with a bottle of wine was totally reasonable. I'm gonna try to go back asap. A+!", "author": "Claire T."}

We shared many of the small plates and starters and were impressed by how each one was creative, balanced and delicious. We especially enjoyed the \"deviled egg\" which is like a beyond perfect soft boiled egg with amazing seasonings and spices. I've never tasted an egg like this before, and would go back just to have it again. Other standouts were the calamari and also the lemony squid ink pasta. The wine list is impressive and international with a heavy emphasis in excellent french wines. There was also a great selection of wines by the glass as well. We enjoyed a Premier Cru Chablis as well as the house Pinot Noir cuvee. The ambiance at Octavia is warm and inviting and the service is spot on. Octavia is quite new and just opened 7 months ago.

I have always been fond of Melissa Perello's food back in the day at Charles Nob Hill, which most of foodies think should come back. Melissa's sister restaurant Frances in SF is quite good as well, but CNH was pretty hard to beat. We started off at Octavia with Morro Bay oyster's which were quite salty and just OK. The Deviled Egg was very touch notch and served on the soft boiled side with a nice flavor of pepper & spice. We didn't really care for the Beef Tongue and Summer Tomatoes. We noticed that Octavia likes to use a lot of cilantro, dill, and tomatoes in their dishes which were not a big fan of considering the dishes that were served.The Calamari salad was pasty and not what we expected. The Red Lentil & Kuri Squash soup was excellent and well prepared. The saffron Tonnarelli pasta was good, but then again tomatoes were in the dish. Hold the tomatoes and add rabbit or another gamey animal to the pasta dish. We finished off with the Pork Chop and Polenta dishes and both were excellent. We passed on dessert considering how much we shared. I would add padded seats and pillows to sit on considering the seating was a bit uncomfortable. I would highly recommend getting valet parking for us folks traveling long distances, and street parking was quite difficult to find. Back in the Baker and Banker days there was valet which was a nice convenience. Overall, there was some hit and misses on the dishes that can improve over time. The staff was very attentive. I would definitely be back at some point, but not anytime soon until I hear of some improvements. For right now stick with Melissa's sister restaurant Frances which is a bit better.", "author": "Mark L."}

The beef tongue melts in your mouth.  The green beans were prefectly cooked.  The highlight of the entire meal was the corn chowder.  Both my wife and I thought it was the best corn soup we have ever tried.  We had the salomon entre which I wasn't crazt about.  Not that it wasnt good, because it was perfectly cooked.  It's just that it is something you can prepare at home without too much fuss.  The service was spot on.  Our server was previously at Quince and then at Francis for 5 years and was asked to move to Octavia.  Melissa was wise to pull vetran staff from Francis to open this restaruant.  Their professionalism shows well for a new venture.  For dessert we had the chocolate souffle with caramel which was very good.  Their wine list is very nice and quite extensive including dessert wines.  This is a super replacement for Baker and Banker and should become even more successful as time passes. The decor is very pleasant and gave a nice feeling of calmness.  I would highly recommed this restaruant.", "author": "Michael B."}
