Period.\n\nThe chicken and steak are well seasoned and cooked. The ingredients are fresh. The portion sizes are more than ample (2 tacos will def fill you up). The prices are super reasonable (2 tacos only ran me a little over 7 bucks, not including tax + tip). Your taco platter comes with a nice side of refried/black beans topped with cheese. Service is quick, friendly, and efficient. Even during their lunch rush hour (where people are waiting in a long line out the door), I was able to order/pick up my food in under 10 minutes. That's thanks to the hard-working kitchen staff who are busting their butts to create dynamite fresh Mex food for the masses. \n\nFYI, unlike most taquerias and fast-casual restaurants, Uno Dos Tacos boasts a full liquor license. So if you're so inclined, margaritas, palomas, and tequila shots are available for purchase (the house margarita is just $8 and just as tasty as any you'd find at a high-end Mexican restaurant).\n\nSo long story short... if you're in the SOMA/FiDi area and need some quick, guilt-free Mexican food, run (don't walk) to Uno Dos Tacos. This place is legit.", "author": "Kevin B."}

My office is at the corner of 2nd and Market and Uno Dos is right down stairs on Stevenson and 2nd. Its always packed for lunch, happy hour, and dinner so I thought I would stop in to see what the hype was all about. I read on the website that their tortillas are handmade daily from fresh masa; winning! I opted for 3 tacos - carne, tinga, carnitas. Of the three I liked the tinga the most; the chicken was boiled well and had a good flavor to it although it was not spicy which is what tinga de pollo should be. The carnitas was too fatty and too wet for my liking. The carne was pink on the inside; not a bad thing just not my preference. I did enjoy the refried black beans, chips, and salsa a lot. I would like to stop in again and try the other meats.", "author": "John C."}

There's an outside patio area, but it was pretty full (and extremely loud). Luckily, there was some room at one of the long communal tables inside, so we snagged a spot.\n\nYou order at the counter and pick up your food at the counter when your buzzer goes off, so I recommend grabbing a seat first before if it's crowded. Their menu is very easy to understand, with a nice table to make it even easier. You can order either a taco, burrito, salad, or plate with one of the following fillings: carne asada, tinga, carnitas, lengua, fish, or vegetables. \n\nThey also offer some great happy hour deals on food from 4 pm till close. For $5, you can order tostaditas, flautas, gorditas, quesadilla frita, or sope.\n\nI opted for the classic carne asada burrito for $8, which comes with grilled flap meat, beans, and salsa fresca. Yes the ingredients are simple, but I prefer simple burritos so this was right up my alley. I just wish they added rice to their burritos, but I asked when ordering and was told this was something they don't do. I also ordered chips and guac ($7) for us to share.\n\nI was pretty happy with my burrito, as they really crammed it full of meat. I guess when the main ingredients are meat and beans, you end up with large mouthfuls of both. The carne asada itself was delicious and had good flavor. The portion of chips and guacamole was huge and we ended up unable to finish it on top of our main orders.\n\nMy coworker also got us a pitcher of margarita which was delicious. It was a good balance between sweet and being too strong, which can be a hard line to walk sometimes.\n\nOverall I really enjoyed my experience here and would definitely come back!", "author": "Dianna H."}

This is my go to spot for taco salads and a chicharonnes taco.   The food has been consistently good, but Do Not go here on a taco Tuesday after work. Went to pick up dinner after taking orders from my fam and didn't realize it was a mad house here. While the line was decently sized I waited since I didn't want to find another place retake orders from the fam. No problems with ordering the food, but once my take out food was finally ready the issues popped up.  \n\nFirst they forgot four tacos from my order. I repeat, not one, but four!  Luckily I noticed while I was grabbing utensils and didn't leave yet. Went back and it took awhile for the guy passing out food to understand that I was missing items from my order. Once he got it, there were no apologies or any sense of urgency to fill my order. Instead I waited quite a bit of time again. I understand that it's a taco Tuesday special and it's busy, but I'd appreciate some kind of acknowledgement.  With the waiting for the missing tacos, the rest of my food is likely now cold and unfortunately I didn't realize until I left that I'm also missing my sides of beans.\n\nAlso, the four tacos were all chicken. Once I got the items I noticed they all had different toppings. I confirmed if it was all chicken and they said yes. Hoping that's the case when I finally get home to eat.\n\nJust got home.  What was supposed to be a chicken salad is now a steak salad and there is no dressing for any of the salads.  Very disappointing.\n\nUpdate - business owner reaching out has my hopes up that this last experience was just a blip. I'll give them another try one day.", "author": "Joanne T."}

I ordered a carnitas plate with beans and tortillas. The pork was tender and there were plenty of them. It was the right level of saltiness and really fresh. I also ordered a margarita which tasted like the ones I've had in Mexico.

The food had a somewhat Mexican fast food flavor, so it wasn't super enjoyable but good enough if you are looking for something to munch on with margaritas. I had a fish taco and a veggie taco, fish was fried well, veggies were alright and under seasoned. The guacamole was essentially fresh mashed avocado and that was probably my favorite part. Oh and we sat outside in the SF fog but stayed warm with blankets the restaurant provides! Overall fun vibe for happy hour but wouldn't recommend coming here just for the food.", "author": "Farrah N."}

My coworker knew of this place and brought me along for some authentic Mexican food on a cold, rainy Tuesday. The line was semi long but it seemed like people were generally in and out fast -- they just wanted to take their lunch break and then head back to the office. \n\nThe guacamole and chips are AMAZING! The guac itself is expertly flavored and isn't too salty. The salsa is delicious! \n\nI also got the carne asada plate for $10. It is a bit pricey to me but well worth it for how filling and how flavorful everything is. I'm normally not a fan of black beans but I finished everything on my plate. \n\nThere are tables in the center of the restaurant where people just collectively sit and enjoy their quick lunches. You'll probably make a few friends who are sitting next to you -- they'll pretty much hear your whole conversation and you, theirs. \n\nI'd be curious what Happy Hour is like here! There's a tequila bar on the other side that's seems like it's decked out with liquor. And the food itself is already amazing -- that I'm sure of!", "author": "Christine W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-09-15", "description": "I walked by on a random Friday afternoon after work (today) and ran into the place all my co-workers mention Uno Dos Tacos more like Uno Dos de Todo! As a person of hispanic decent you bet I was going to REALLY rate this highly raved about downtown joint so here we go: \n\nClever name, love it. Its not Rubios, Guadalajara Tacos, El Sombrero, what have you. The name is authentically clever and multi-culturally friendly. I begin with this because the food is not Americanized, it is REAL Casual Mexican food and you would expect something totally different if someone told you about the place. Uno Dos Tacos is Mexican Chic with a spacious front patio, metal and wood accents, bright color, dim lighting inside and an over all clean and pleasing to the eye presentation. Hands down five stars for first impressions. \n\nI showed during Happy Hour, four dollar draft beer and five dollar bar menu. Ten dollar good time before hitting BART. \n\nThe menu for Happy Hour is simple, classic, and filling if you're wanting a small bite with your beer. Flautas, Gorditas, Quesadillas, Tacos..you know, basic, authentic and to the point. If you are vegan you will have to ask for your bar bites without sour cream and cheese and meat of course. I wish they would add something more vegetarian friendly but its not a big deal. \n\nI ordered the Mexican IPA tap with what I thought was gonna be a two gorditas but it was two sopes without cheese or sour cream and no meat. \n\nSo here is what happened,\n\nI couldn't see the menu because it was too far for my eye sight and I didn't have my glasses and so I asked Alicia (with the purple hair) what was on the Happy Hour menu that I could make vegan and she said Gorditas, corn flour round pockets you fill with pretty with anything but instead it was two Sopes, corn flour flat cakes usually with bean spread directly on and whatever you want on top of that. \n\nMy food was ready in five minutes or less, the vegan sopes bar bite size and a Mexican IPA, I ordered some chips and salsa (pico de gallo) for the wait as well. On the first bite I knew the food was gonna be delicious! The chips are salted right and semi-fresh not home made thats for sure, home fried is what they they are and not paper thin chips that look like they are almost questionable to eat and the pico de gallo was perfectly seasoned with a great amount of lime! \n\nThe sopes were also very good, the home made corn flour sopes were on hit! They had black beans and salsa that is also found in the front of the food bar for grabs, and a bit of cilantro on top. \n\nOver all this place is really good! The Mexican IPA is delicious I think its great they have a Mexican IPA to go with the vibe and theme of the place. \n\nIf you are looking for an authentically hip Mexican joint look no further, the esthetic speaks for itself. It is between this place and TropiSue\u00f1o so far!\n\nPS: They have blankets if you get cold outside........no thanks but GREAT idea!", "author": "Karlos G."}

I have to break up a casual conversation between the worker ringing the buzzers and the chef as they clearly seemed to have nothing else to do. (So where was my food?) I say excuse me and show them my ticket. The chef decides to pass it down the line to another chef and says \"Oh, I never saw this ticket.\" They banter back and forth (\"No thats not my order.\" \"No, you make it, I didn't have that ticket.\") before one finally gives in to make the order. Mind you the person working the buzzers said no apologies nor explained why they decided to skip my order. The tacos finally get made and she hands it to me with a \"Here you go.\" No apology, no smile, just attitude. I guess I was wrong to interrupt their conversation. Strike dos.\n\nAs I sit down and eat these dreaded tacos that I had to practically beg to be made, I notice how dripping wet they are from the carnitas. No one wants to eat a soaked tortilla that falls apart the moment you pick it up. The tacos turned into a bowl of soggy meat and limp pieces of tortilla.

Given the SoMa/FiDi location, it is better than the scarce competition.  Plus the ambiance and drink specials help seal the deal when you want Mexican food but don't want to walk more than a few blocks from your office. \n\nChicaronnes Taco: This taco far surpassed expectations and was the highlight of my meal.  It wasn't like the pork rind chicaronnes you get in a bag.  More like chunks of pork that happened to have very crispy fat and skin attached.  It reminded a bit of when places that fry carintas in a final step to make them nice and crispy.\n\nPescado Taco: This fish itself was nice, but the batter exterior wasn't crispy at all.  An inexpensive fish taco from Rubio's is far superior.  Speaking of, they could probably make their taco a little better by adding some crema.\n\nAsada Taco: This was very meh.  The cubes of meat tasted like something out of Chipotle rather than a Taqueria in the Mission.  I'm not used to my carne asada being a neutral gray and would have preferred it to have a bit of diverse texture (from grilling the exterior to a nice well done).\n\nPineapple Agua Fresca: Pretty awesome agua fresca.  Lots of pineapple juice and pulp as opposed to those cheap places that cut corners and give you sugar water with a little taste of fruit.  Very refreshing.", "author": "Adam B."}

The food is a solid 3-3.5, but overall rounded up to a 4 for the crackin' happy hour and their stellar service!  \n\nSERVICE:\nCashiers are always patient and help answer any questions. Bartenders are friendly and make the drinks quickly and thoroughly. The workers are also always constantly cleaning and clearing empty dishes! \n\nWater & utensils are self-serve,\n\nCATERING: I have gotten breakfast burrito catering for the office recently (which was a hit!) Super responsive. The order received was 100% correct, and was ready to pick up at the exact time I specified (and phew, I got to skip that early b-fast line rush!)\n\nBREAKFAST: The breakfast burritos for $2.99 is a steal for the area and although it's on the 'smaller' end (just eggs, cheese, potatoes & choice of meat/veggie), I think it's the perfect portion size for breakfast! And you can't complain for the price.\n\nHAPPY HOUR!\n+ lasts til 9 PM!\n+ outdoor patio! (wish the view was nicer, but it's koo)\n+ BLANKETS PROVIDED BECAUSE IT GETS COLD SOMETIMES (no space heaters). TAKE A PIC WITH ONE ON FOR THE 'GRAM.\n+ 6 tacos for $19 or $5 app specials!\n+ $30 marg pitchers or a bucket of 6 beers for $25\n\nThere's' limited seating inside and it gets kinda loud, so I usually sit outside. There always seems to be seating for small groups even when it's at peak time (or at least recently - maybe not during summer!).\n\nI dig the tacos. Fresh corn tortillas, nice corn flavor and the right amount of thickness. Not soggy. My favorite is the fish (fried cod), but the carnitas and tinga (chicken) are also very good. Very tender. Asada was kinda dry (maybe just my batch) but it was very flavorful and had a nice smokey flavor.\nI wish it came with the option of more pico de gallo / fresh veggies, but maybe I can try asking next time.\n\nTheir other HH specials are always very fresh and well-made. Most of them involve their fresh corn masa / dough which is spectacular (I'm a big fan of corn...)\n\nThe guac is decent - it is very fresh and on the more creamy (vs chunky & thick) and lemony side. I prefer my guac chunky, but every place has their own style.\n\nMargs: very well balanced! Not watered down and they also don't use any artificial sweeteners! They measure out their tequilas - so yay for consistency! A pitcher serves a good ~5-6 drinks. They ask if you want salt on the rim when they give you the cups when you order a pitcher. Big plus! It's the little details :)\n\nMy only notes for improvement are:\n- They only have 2 salsas. I wish there was more variety and that it packed more flavor. I like my salsas with a lot of oomph.\n- The salsa/pico de gallo that comes with the chips is kinda whatevs (tomatoes are  soft, and it's pretty watery at the bottom - I like my pico super crunchy and drained of water!)", "author": "Emily C."}

Once for dinner and once for breakfast. \n\nI was working late at the office and needed someplace to buy my dinner and bring it back to the office. Being in FiDi means that there aren't a lot of good places to eat, let alone places that are still open for dinner. I have always passed by Uno Dos Tacos on the way to the office, and thought I would get a bowl. I ended up ordering the Carne Asada Salad and chips and salsa. I was very surprised that this place was so busy. It was already way past happy hour. The line didn't move very quickly and the food also came out very slow. I probably waited about 20 minutes for my food to come out. The salad wasn't very memorable. I remember the proportion of meat to salad to beans ratio wasn't very good. There were too many beans. The chips and salsa were chips and salsa. Nothing made the amazing, but they weren't horrible either.\n\nFor breakfast, my coworker and I both ordered the bacon breakfast burrito ($4/each). The normal breakfast burrito $3.50, but when you add meat of some kind, they add 50 cents.  My coworker swears by these burritos and comes everyday to get one. I have to say, it is a great value! I was surprised about how cheap it was. Now I understand why there is a line, sometimes out of the door for breakfast. You get a decent sized burrito for cheap. The filling and taste was meh, but if you just need food, this is the place to get it. Don't expect your burrito to come out extra fast. They also have fresh squeezed orange juice, which tasted very good. \n\nPro tip: If I've learned anything, if you don't plan on eating in the restaurant, order ahead and have your food waiting for you by the time you pick it up. You can use that time you would have waited to do more productive things.", "author": "Carolyn Z."}

There is no immediate obvious reason for this from the get-go, since it requires two people to man two stations, but after the fact, we wonder why more places don't do the same.\n\nFood is decent (tacos, chips, and quesadillas weren't bad, just nothing special), though the drinks and the vibes are definitely where it's at.

Upside was that it was pretty big and I ate the rest for dinner (strangely enough it tasted better as leftovers).  Price was pretty decent for the area since I paid less than $10.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-07-07", "description": "I went to Unos Dos Tacos on a Thursday for lunch (around 12:30pm) with my coworkers. The restaurant has a really great location - on the corner of a block in the middle of the Financial District, close to KPMG, Fidelity, and a few other big companies/buildings. There is both indoor and outdoor seating. There is a bar and seating on tables and long counters indoors, and several tables under umbrellas outdoors. Because it was cold and windy, the indoor seating was completely packed but the outdoor seating was not, so we sat outside. It's definitely a great place for an informal lunch meeting with a client or with coworkers!\n\nThere is a wide variety of options to choose from - the dishes are prepared as tacos, burritos, salads, or plates. I'm not too sure what the plate is (read through the other reviews), but the other three options are pretty straightforward. There are several choices of meat - chicken, beef, pork, and fish - and then a vegetarian option. I chose to go with two fish tacos and a side of chips which came with salsa and guacamole.\n\nThe fish tacos are definitely tasty, albeit expensive ($4.50 each). I thought it was odd that the fish was fried rather than grilled, but it added to the great taste. The tacos contained the fish, lettuce salad, and diced tomatoes (the same salsa that came with the chips), and came with a side of black beans topped with cheese. Two tacos were enough to satisfy me, but I probably should have ordered a third to fill me up completely.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the food and the vibe of Uno Dos Tacos! If it is cold outside, I would recommend you to sit inside if possible. If it is crowded inside, watch out for the pigeons flying around the outdoor seating! There was a woman who was literally bullied into moving tables because of a brave pigeon (LOL). I would also recommend you to try a variety of tacos instead of a single type - that is something I definitely want to do when I come back next time, and maybe go for a burrito rather than a taco. There are a few people who get salads, but it's not as common.\n\nI give this restaurant 4 stars overall because while the food is great, it isn't completely mind-blowing. I was disappointed the fish tacos were fried rather than grilled, and that the food was expensive overall ($3+ for any taco). But I am definitely coming back for more!", "author": "Rahul R."}

Probably the best salsa I've found in the area...from the mild tomatillo-based green sauce, to the more chile-based red sauce that packs a spicy punch along with delicious flavor.  Fair warning, I love spicy! In fact I carry a bottle of El Yucateco XXXTRA HOT Chile Habanero sauce around in my bag and put it on practically everything -- I would rate El Yucatero an 8 and the sauce from Uno Dos Tacos a 6 on a 1-10 spiciness scale, but spice level is subjective anyway right so just go try it for yourself, you won't be disappointed!\n\nI was introduced to this place at a vendor presentation last week where Uno Dos Tacos was served for lunch. I had the Tinga burrito, which is juicy simmered shredded chicken.  Today I had the Asada burrito which boasts huge chunks of tender grilled flap meat, black beans and salsa fresca all wrapped in a flour tortilla. I also had lengua tacos -- lengua done right is my absolute favorite for tacos and Uno Dos Tacos definitely knows how to prepare lengua!

Regardless, the food here is pretty good!  One of my friends and I shared a plate of their six taco plate ($16 and comes with one fish and one lengua already - any additional taco of those costs an extra $1).  The tacos were pretty standard - nothing mind-blowing, if anything it was just basic.  We got 2 carne asada and 2 chicken.  Chicken tasted a little weird, but carne asada was good.  The fish was probably the best.\n\nWe also got baskets on baskets of chips and salsa/guac.  I don't normally like chunky salsa and guac, but they were actually really good!  The guac tasted fresh and I dipped my chips in the salsa sauce (I don't like tomatoes) and that had a great spice and kick to it.  I think the chips and guac/salsa were my favorite thing we had - I know, so basic.  But they really were tasty!\n\nA margarita pitcher is almost $30.  It probably served 5 cups.

There are also corn tortillas on the side so you can opt to make your own taco if you wish. If you are going to get tacos I vote to go with the platter because you can put way more meat in it! The meat was a bit flavorless so next time I'd probably order a side of guac to mix things up a bit.

Naturally, gravitated to the left side of the restaurant, and found myself talking to a chirpy bartender.  I asked which drink has the higher alcohol content--the margarita or the sangria.  She said that the sangria seems stronger because it has brandy in it.  Say no more.  $20 later, I had a pitcher in my hand and I was ready to party (not by myself, but with two of my girl friends).  The pitcher was enough for us to get a good tipsy feeling going on, but then again, we are all relatively lightweights.  \n\nThe food was delicious!  We got a sopas (never had it before--was like chicharon on a tart), and flautas (I LOVE flautas! I wish the happy hour portion was bigger, but it was only $5 anyway), and my woman friends got tacos.  We had chips and some very good chunky guac to start off, and it already got us full.  However, not to be deterred, we still finished all of our food.

My Carne Asada burrito was literally exploding with guacamole and sour cream; two of my favorite things ever. {Note: These heavenly items don't come standard, I added them to their already fabulous burrito creation.} The burrito was also packed with black beans, pico & cheese. \n\nDid I mentioned the guacamole? ;) It's amazing and you must, at the very least, order a side of guac & chips! I loved their salsa in the 'squeeze' bottles. I honestly wanted to squeeze it in my mouth, I couldn't get enough. The chips were super fresh and I'm pretty positive that the corn tortillas are made right there on site!

I took my first bite of the chicken taco and Oh My God, I was blown away by how flavorful it was. I didn't even need salsa on it. The salsa was spicy just how I like it. The fish taco was also good.

I went to the old place on my first day of work at my current job.  Six years ago.  Also, I had about exactly 24 hours of experience in San Francisco and California that day.\n\nUno Dos Tacos is adequate food, some drink options, above average service and cleanliness, and a great space in a good location.  I come here for lunch on Saturdays because not a lot is open in this neck of the woods.  I've had tacos all three times, and I always get a mix.  The food is good quality, but a little dry.  Clearly it's not cheap meat, which can ruin a good taco.  The side sauce is good, but you only get one option so far as I know.  The tacos come with a small side of Black Beans which are tasty.  I've tried Carne Asada, Chicken, and Carnitas tacos.\n\nI think this place really shines because of the space and location.  And, for that matter, the availability on the weekend.  The interior is spacious and open.  The line and kitchen is completely unshielded, but you have plenty of space between it and the seating area.  They also have a huge patio outside on 2nd (very close to Market).  That's where I ate my first ever lunch in SF.  ... Nostalgia.  \n\nTwo final notes:\n\n1.  They have alcohol, but it is at a separate counter from where you get food.  Not sure what that's all about.  I've never drank here.\n2.  They have Breakfast Burritos during the week.  Also, I've not tried.  Yet.  Soon.", "author": "Adam S."}

I've been here a few times, mainly to take advantage of the post-work Happy Hour specials that run most of the night. Our favorite margarita is the \"La Paloma\" -- which we normally get a few pitchers of!\n\nThe food is decent, and decently priced. Nothing *too* special, but nothing awful either. Just some decent Tex Mex. I had the Asada salad, and though the meat was cooked well and tasted good, I found the rest of the salad itself was bland. To make up for it, I had to douse the lettuce in salsa. Not bad but not really my thing. My friends had the Asada, Tinga, and Carnitas tacos. They actually found the Asada to be overcooked, though they enjoyed the Tinga and Carnitas tacos. \n\nSo yes, you can probably find way better Mexican food in the Mission, but if you're looking for a fun, casual, post-work vibe, this is a great spot.

Inside is spacious and there is plenty of outdoor seating on their patio. Great for groups in a casual setting if you can snag some seating.\n\nYou have the the usual suspects: tacos, burriton, quesadillas, plate, etc...  I ended up with the chicken plate that comes with a nice little mound of chicken, black beans and three tortillas. I had to slather their non spicy hot sauce to get any flavor and even then, the star of the show were those tortillas. Where's the spice? Where's the heat? Honesty, where is it?\n\nBonus: that guac is good! Not the biggest portion, but super fresh and delicious. Chips, freshly fried, albeit a bit greasy.

Located about a half a block from the Montgomery Bart station on Market St., you can find this establishment.\n\nThere are helpful signs when you walk in, to the left you'll find the tequila bar, and on the right, you can order food. I wanted to try the tacos, but when scanning the menu, I saw that Salsa and Chips were only $2. I held back from order 3 tacos though, because $3.50 is a little hefty for street tacos, for me at least.\n\nRight after ordering, the cashier attended to grabbing my chips and salsa right away. This was good, because I could snack on something while waiting for my main course. But, I didn't even have to wait that long for them to assemble my two tacos.\n\nThe Chips and Salsa were pretty good. I was iffy at first, because I usually like the more well-blended salsas, and theirs is chopped in small cubes, but it turned out to be very good. My problem with it however, is that you get a lot of chips, for just a small container of salsa, I felt weird about asking if I needed to pay the full price for a refill (so if any owners read this review, please let me know if salsa refills cost full price).\n\nI was excited to try the tacos. They're made with your choice of meat, followed with onions and cilantro, all on top of a freshly made masa tortilla. You also get a small container of black beans, and another one with some spicy salsa, with a wedge of lime on the side. I tried my first one with just lime on top. It turned out to be just okay for me though. I was hoping to taste the fresh cilantro and seasoned meat. I could taste them, but I wished they had more flavor. You can add the salsa to add some flavor, but I was hoping that the ingredients would stand out on their own.\n\nWith the price and the flavor of the tacos, I can only give a 3 star rating for now.

Not sure but it happens every time and it takes up time during the work day when I find myself needing to go to the bathroom multiple times throughout the work day.", "author": "John C."}

I honestly love the guacamole and tomato salsa with chips.  It has the nice flavor to it when you mix both together.  Usually get some tacos to go with the chips, the asada and carnitas are some good options.  Also, the breakfast burritos are cheap and tasty and are about $3.50.  This place gets busy when it's warm outside, cause people love to sit outside and drink margaritas and beers, lol.  Honestly a wonderful place to stop by on the way to the Giants game or before heading home as it is conveniently located close to the Montgomery Bart station.  The one drawback that I have is they do not serve rice in the burritos.  But there's many options of food and drink.  All in all a go to spot when in the area.", "author": "Jeremaine R."}

You can order from the counter for an order to go or choose to stay and eat in. Although Uno Dos Tacos is not as Mexican authentic in decor, they definitely bring on the heat with their homemade salsa and Tapatio Sauce (with influence from Guadalajara). In addition to their friendly customer service their food hits the spot.  \n\nYou can't beat their $3.25 breakfast burritos (modest size). Add $.50 for chorizo, veggies or bacon, but they are quite flavorful without. You can also get plain coffee for $2 without the long wait... For now. They do not have speciality coffee drinks.

There's just something very impersonal about the approach in both places that doesn't appear to bother most of their customers. I like the less-than-immaculate mamacita touch you'd find in the Mission because it makes the food taste more authentic. But that doesn't appear to be a priority here. Turnover is, and offering a hipster-friendly selection of fillings. Paganini and his partners took over the shuttered Sellers Market, and people are queuing up at the lunch hour.\n\nI decided to give it a go around 2PM to avoid the crowds, and that worked since I just walked into the cavernous place and ordered (photo: http://bit.ly/1nx1izE). At $3.25 per taco, it adds up, so a trio took me to ten bucks quite easily. They were served up on those familiar metal trays they use at Super Duper as well with a child's serving of black beans and a bit of salsa verde for good measure. I tried the Asada with grilled flap meat and roasted tomato salsa, the Carnitas with slow roasted pork and the same salsa, and the Lengua with braised beef tongue and tomatilla salsa (photo: http://bit.ly/1pkYPYp). They're kinda small, enough to call them taquitos if you ask me.\n\nBut they weren't unreasonably priced when I just spent almost double for the same quantity at Tacombi in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Same concept, hipper ambiance. And they were reasonably tasty for how long they lasted. They just lacked distinction much like the burgers at Super Duper. In other words, there was nothing served here that I couldn't have gotten at similarly targeted taquerias. But they get points for convenience. They open at 7AM five days a week and close at 9PM except on Fridays when they close at 10AM for the post-work crowd. They even made the audacious move to stay open Saturdays 10:30AM to 8PM.

I found myself talking to the owner this afternoon, and after telling him that this was some of the best chicken I've ever had, he told me they're all his mother's recipes. I've been to Chipotle, and this was way better than what I've had there - to say you may as well go to Chipotle instead because the flavors are better there... I shake my head and scoff.\n\nI stumbled across this place after seeing it out of the corner of my eye, and was pleased with the very simple menu upon walking in: tacos, burritos, salads, or a plate, with your choice of meat. I went with the chicken plate and it didn't take too long at all to come out; the owner actually brought me my food and gave me some of his red salsa that he makes himself, to try.\n\nThe plate was the perfect amount of food, with a pile of shredded, marinated chicken, black beans, pico de gallo, and three homemade corn tortillas. The first bite blew me away. I couldn't get enough of that chicken, and when I'd rip off a piece of tortilla to scoop my beans and salsa with, I'd get a little scoop of perfection in every bite. The green salsa on the table, which looks like maybe a tomatillo based sauce, was spicy and incredibly good.\n\nMy complaint was that, while I'm always disappointed by how small corn tortillas are compared to flour, three didn't seem like they were enough. To be honest, they may be enough for someone that doesn't scoop up their food with them, and uses mainly their fork, but when you're relying on your tortillas they disappear fast. I'm not sure how much extra tortillas are, or how many come in an order. Also, $3.75 is steep for one taco. It's the reason why I went with the plate instead, which was a little over eight bucks, but perhaps it wound up better that way in the end.\n\nThe simplicity of the meal - meat, beans, tortillas, and salsa - is what made me think of meals I've grown up with, and I appreciated how satisfying such a basic dish could be. \n\nI can't wait to bring my guy here later this week for dinner.

Good enough reason for me at least. \n\nBetween lunch and happy hour, I much prefer the latter based on my experiences at Uno Dos Tacos. Perhaps I misread what the plate entailed but I was thinking a rice bowl \u00e0 la Chipotle thinking that it might be easier to scoff down as I work through lunch but it turned out to be a deconstructed taco plate. Still I thought the asada was flavorful and not too tough or sinewy but I left feeling a little hungry still. Happy hour however is a different story. How about a jalepeno-spiced sangria or $4 drafts to wash down some guacamole and chips? Separate counter for booze makes for shorter lines too. The happy hour vibe, if you can grab a table, is lively but not too packed unlike most other post-work watering holes in the neighborhood. \n\nI had higher expectations for Uno Dos Tacos since my friend had mentioned that it was good when they were at their pop up location in Russian hill.

Walking down Market, I realized it's actually located around the corner on 2nd Street and not on Market.

The lengua with braised beef tongue and tomatillo salsa. Both on fresh corn tortillas. The pescado was on the smaller side, but nicely fried. I just wish there was more fish since there was so much breading. The lengua was nice and tender.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-09-29", "description": "Helllllllo, San Francisco! This will be my first review of an establishment in your locale. Of all of my options I think that I feel most passionately about this review. I was on a recent business trip in the San Francisco region and a coworker of mine took me and a few others out to Uno Dos. Below I will provide you with a comprehensive explanation regarding my experience, and what you may be able to expect from your visit.\n\nFood: I really wanted a burrito, but then ... for the same cost ... I realized that I could get TWO tacos and try TWO different meats! And so the inner-battle for gastrointestinal dominance waged between by stomach and brain. My brain was eloquently piecing together a justifiable and rational explanation regarding its position on the matter, while my stomach was boisterously yelling at my brain like a potty-mouth 5-year-old. Yea, it was ugly.\n\nI finally settled on two tacos -- yep, my brain won. I ordered the carne asada and the carnitas tacos, with guacamole, and with a side of queso. First things first...the meats. The carne asada was excellent. Well-seasoned, tender, and cooked to perfection. The only thing that I like on my carne asada that was not present, was a high heat char from a grill or broiler. Even without that though, this was top-notch. The carnitas were probably the best that I have ever had. Melt-in-your mouth pork, bursting with flavor. I strongly recommend the carinatas. (Meat 5/5)\n\nThe homemade corn tortillas were definitely fresh. For me though, I am a flour tortilla guy. If you are a corn-person (that sounds weird)... then go for the corn tortillas -- you will not be disappointed. The guacamole was some of the best I have had in terms of freshness and quality. A little bit too heavy-handed on the chopped onions, but the flavor was on point. Nxt, the side of Queso. This is where an unfortunate circumstance happened. I wanted a side of cheese sauce (i.e. Queso). The dude acted confused by this order, and asked if I wanted melted cheese. I said, 'yes, a cheese sauce.' \n\nIn retrospect, my assumption is that they just don't serve this. Bummer. What I got was a small ramekin of grated cheese. Not gonna penalize them for it, but it was sad. (Tortilla 4, Guacamole 4, cheese N/A)\n\nOk, so now onto the compilation of the taco. Everything was fresh, the flavors were good, except for the EXCESSIVE serving of chopped onions on the taco. I had to scarpe/pick the vast majority of them out of the taco. There were waaaaay to many. Like, between 1/8 and 1/4 cup on each taco. It was nuts. This was quite disappointing; but easily fixable -- just a nuisance.\n\nFood: 4 / 5\n\nService: The place was hopping on a Friday afternoon at lunch. Literally, a line out the door and down the street. As such, the main concern for the establishment was quickly fulfilling ticket orders. I get that. It was so busy, that a dude, seemingly a manager of sorts -- was pulling people out of line and ringing them out at the bar. I appreciate that they were doing all that they could to rock-out the voluminous quantity of tickets. As such, I cannot penalize them for lack of service.\n\nService: 4 / 5\n\nAtmosphere: Waaaaay too busy for my liking; but the overall decor on the inside, and the clean and comfortable area on the outside were really nice. There is indoor and outdoor seating available. indoors it is cramped with all the people hustling about. Outdoors it is also quite cramped. Good luck trying to find a place to sit. Also, do not leave your food for one second! If the aggressive pigeons don't get it, a fast-working bus-person will. The 'bussers' were zooming around very efficiently trying to get things ready for the seemingly endless horde of taco consumers -- so, again, I cannot blame them for being a little over-zealous in their duties.\n\nAtmosphere: 3 / 5\n\nPrice: For what I paid, I feel like the quality was fair. For the cost, it did not blow me away; but I would possibly pay it again if I ever came back.\n\nPrice: 3 / 5\n\nFinal Thoughts: As with all of my reviews, I reserve the right to round up or down. I feel as if Uno Dos is deserving of a 4 star review, despite the minor hiccups in service and food compilation. Overall though, I would say that this is a solid place to grab some tacos and take them back to your office / home / car, etc. Honestly, these tacos are legit, and I fully recommend checking this place out.", "author": "Anthony S."}

What I got was not what I'm accustomed to getting when ordering Chorizo and eggs. After my first bite, all the eggs showed no signs of chorizo. I thought they forgot to add it, which bothered me since they charged me extra for it. When I got half way down, there it was! on one side of the tortilla with one chunk of a potato. I realize I wasn't ordering a gourmet burrito, but it looks as if someone threw the ingredients onto the tortilla, instead of cooking and mixing it all together the way it's suppose to be or at least all the times I've had it in Los Angeles.

It has an urban vibe with the high ceilings and minimalist decor with nice salsa music playing. There have a large outdoor seating area that had large tables for groups and small tables, as well as  bar style seating area, it is a great place for people watching! I ordered a carne asada salad that was fantastic. They use chopped romaine lettuce, black beans, a house made salsa and a light dressing that complemented the salad as opposed to the overpowering ones that are often used. I also ordered a pineapple agua fresco that was great. They use pottery bowls and silverware which is a refreshing touch in a taqueria. They also serve beer, wine and sangria. My only complaint, I had to leave before happy hour!\n\nBefore I had time to post my review I returned the following day for Happy Hour! I ordered a sangria and it was great. They also offer beer and in the near future they will have a full liquor license so margaritas will be on the way.  I ordered chops and salsa for $1.95 and the pico de gallo is house made and they gave a generous amount. Definitely enough for two people. I decided to order a fish taco instead the the small plates they offer for Happy Hour and the fish was battered and served in a crispy corn tortilla, very nice.  Monday I will return to try the offered items.\n\nWhen I mentioned Uno Dos to a friend who works around the corner, she also loved it and enjoyed the sarapes that are in a basked near the door to use when it is cold outside. I thought they were part of the decor, it is another reason to love the charm and thought that went into this gem. By the way, my phone phone was dead and I could not find an outlet.

So, I'm raising my overall review from 3 Stars to 4.\n_____________________________\nFor me, this place is a recent find.\n\nFrom time to time, I have a craving for a breakfast burrito.  They have a small size basic breakfast burrito with Eggs, Cheese, Potatoes, and Salsa Fresca for $3.50.  I get vegetables added for $0.50 more.  While Burritos are not authentic Mexican food, the combination of ingredients, flavors and the size is just about perfect for a breakfast meal.  Any larger, and I might have to share, or risk falling asleep.\n\nUnfortunately, I always have to make a special request for a small container of their nice salsa verde.\n\nI just don't understand why they always seem to have only have one type of salsa pre-packaged and ready to hand out (it's OK, but not my favorite).  They have other salsas accessible to the cooks; but, if you ask for one of them, the cooks actually have to stop what they are doing to serve you some.  Personally, I think they should either have a do it yourself salsa bar, have more types of the salsas pre-packaged and ready to select, or have the sever at the counter ladle and serve it.\n\nFor lunch, I haven't visited much.  I liked the Battered Cod Fish Taco, and the Carnitas taco was OK.\n\nAs I get a chance to try more items, I'll consider changing my overall rating.

I think it's also a great idea to have the bar separate from the food ordering/cashier, both lines were very quick.  I rarely enjoy a beer on my lunch break but this place was too inviting to pass up the opportunity.  I am definitely visiting Uno Dos again very soon.", "author": "Jessika S."}

Let's just say, I do not plan on going back any time soon, unless I was desperate for Mexican food and this place happened to be the only Mexican restaurant left in the city. \n\nI genuinely feel bad for talking down about this restaurant because the service was nice and the workers were friendly, but unfortunately, the service does not compensate for the quality of the food. \n\nOne of their options during happy hour is a quesadilla for $5, which I thought was a great deal. When I saw how puny the quesadilla was, I was disappointed. My friend said, \"even Polly Pocket had bigger portions than this.\" When I tasted the quesadilla, I felt like I needed to get drunk off of the happy hour alcohol menu just to make the food taste a little bit better. \n\nThe quesadillas tasted more like corn chips than anything else because there was barely any cheese inside. Even I can make better quesadillas than Uno Dos Tacos... and I'm Asian. \n\nOverall, Uno Dos Tacos isn't the worst place in the Financial District, but to me, it's not worth it.", "author": "Mark B."}

Their outside seating area and garden is on 2nd Street just off Market. 595 Market St, San Francisco, CA 94105\n(415) 974-6922.\n\nWhy must you visit: For starters it has delicious Mexican food in a fabulous downtown San Francisco location. On top of the food, the drinks (specifically the margaritas) are awesome. Chef Luis Flores is not only involved on the culinary side, he's also very hands on with the cocktails and is a tequila enthusiast. I learned this during my visit when Chef Flores walked me through his extensive tequila assortment sharing his passion for tequila and the delicious drinks him and his team have created. Check out the bar below!\n\nA Bit More About Chef Luis Flores: Luis' culinary roots go back to a big family and warm kitchen in Guadalajara, Jalisco, where his mom and aunt gave him a taste for cooking from scratch. No matter how big the meal - the tortillas would be made by hand and the salsas carefully crafted to bring out the flavor.\n\nWhat are Chef Flores's favorite dishes to prepare: To this day Luis' favorite foods, including Carnitas and Mole, are among the most time-consuming to prepare. But that's what makes them rewarding. \"I always wanted to open a restaurant that captured the real flavor of Mexico,\" says Luis. \"Homemade and deeply personal.\" You can see exactly how Luis makes it all work, thanks to the big expo kitchen at Uno Dos Tacos allows you to be part of the action.\n\nWhat are the happy hour specials:  $4 beers, $6.50 Margaritas, $5 Sangria and assorted Bar Bites for $5 from 4:00-8:00pm. Yes that is NOT a typo, Uno Dos Tacos San Francisco has a FOUR HOUR HAPPY HOUR!! WOW, I want to move in!!\n\nThanks for checking out my post I hope you enjoy dining with The JetSetting Fashionista.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-25", "description": "When my secretary alerted me that there was a new Mexican restaurant near our office, my heart skipped a beat. One cuisine whose absence is acutely felt in the FiDi is Mexican. To be sure, there's plenty of quasi-Mexican chains that serve colonized Mexican fare, but this feels unacceptable when you know that less than a mile away, in the magical Mission, you can get authentic Mexican cuisine that will knock at least one, if not both, of your socks off.  \n\nI dropped by UDT promptly around 1:00 p.m. PDT.  There was a line winding out of the door and into the foyer of a high rise, which is no surprise at a new restaurant.  Just have to note that the foyer of a high rise is not a good sign.  When it was finally my turn to order, I ordered two fish tacos.  As an aside, UDT serves what I like to call \"Health Mex,\" which is not my favorite right out of the gates.  But considering their lunch menu does not contain cheese or sour cream, it's hard to understand why they have to fry the fish tacos.  Can't you grill the fish in those bad boys?  That tastes so much better, and lightens up lunch considerably. \n\nAfter I ordered two fish tacos, the cashier handed me a pager (he also dropped a big stack of pagers on me and onto the floor, but that's no big deal and is not reflected in my rating whatsoever).  I grabbed the pager and awaited my takeout order, which was served extremely quickly, much to my pleasure.  When I'm on my lunch break, I definitely appreciate when I do not have to wait longer than 5 minutes for takeout.  I grabbed the salsa from an adjacent table and squirted some on my tacos.  I'm not going to candy coat it for you, it annoys me that there is no salsa bar.  I can't imagine what people must be doing to salsa bars in the city to have caused so many restaurants to discontinue the DIY salsa option--- or worse (gasps) - charge for salsa(!)  I shudder just thinking about it.  I don't appreciate having to beg for salsa, however, for the record.  And there's no amount of salsa that ever equals \"enough\" in those tiny pre-portioned plastic ramekins.  \n\nI took those tacos straight back to the office, which is less than 3 blocks away.  They were pretty cold by the time I got to them.  I acknowledge that I did put salsa on them, but even the taco shells were cold.  They were served with a little side of black beans topped with cotija cheese, which was a nice touch but honestly not really necessary.  How about just getting the tacos right, first?  \n\nUDT is receiving a ton of hype and attention from the FiDi crowd, but I feel like this is a classic example of how so-so food receives an undeserved yet colossal reception in San Francisco.  This is not the best taco you will have, not by a long shot.  At a price of nearly $10 for two (fish) tacos, I think your lunch money would be better spent elsewhere.  \n\nOf course, let's acknowledge that this is a new restaurant and perhaps needs time to work out the kinks.  And their happy hour looks kinda slammin.  It also appears that they have a full host of less healthy ingredients at dinner.  The service is quite good.  You'll receive a prompt greeting, a menu while you wait in line, as well as a sample of chips and guacamole.  The cashiers were fantastic-super friendly and helpful. Best of all, they seem to get that you don't want to wait a frakking month for a lunch order.  The service at UDT most definitely saves the day.  \n\nOverall, it's not bad, but it's not the best, either.  It tastes like teen spirit.", "author": "Sunny S."}

There was no option for refried, no whole wheat, corn, or spinach tortilla, and no variance on the spiciness. Perhaps this makes for a quicker assembly. Kind of like Henry Ford saying, \"You can have any color car you want, as long as it's black.\"\n\nWrapped in freshly made corn tortillas, the carnitas taco ($3.25) was rich and very flavorful. The taco de pescado ($4.50, really?!) comes with fried (rather than grilled) cod and was good, but a little greasy. The agua de pi\u00f1a had the right balance: not too sweet, not too sour.  Don;t miss the house-made roasted jalape\u00f1o salsa--it's  available in squeezable containers on the tables (be careful or you'll wear it) and is quite piquant.\n\nWhile not a contender for the best taco in town, Uno Dos Tacos focuses on using fresh, wholesome ingredients and is a far better alternative than Chipotle for Mexican in the FiDi.", "author": "CJ G."}

They are very TexMex style - if you know and like breakfast burritos in Austin, TX (how could you not?), these are like that.  Manageable size for breakfast, very egg-y, and totally delicious.  I get mine without potatoes and cheese (the cheese is never melted) and add bacon and sometimes avocado.  The price is reasonable and it's a solid size for breakfast.  The eggs are perfectly cooked - scrambled and a little soft.  I douse the whole thing in their house smoky salsa and it's perfection.*\n\nI'm so glad this is in walking distance of my office...\n\nI love this type of hipster/Americanized \"Mexican\" food - and I think a lot of the negative reviews on here are simply because this is not super authentic Mexican cuisine.  If you're OK with this style, however, then I think you'll like Uno Dos Tacos.\n\nI've been a few times for lunch and \"afternoon snacks\" - as in, sometimes I stop here for a single taco rather than my usual coffee/pastry break.  I think the tacos are awesome.  If I'm here for a snack only, I just order one fish taco.  If I go for lunch, I usually get carnitas, lengua, and fish tacos.  I LOVE all three of these.  The fish tacos are served with a really tasty chipotle mayo and then a big heap of fresh slaw and pico de gallo - it helps to freshen up the fried fish and mayo combination.  I never think the fish is overly heavy or greasy - I actually love the more \"tempura\" style of batter, and they freshly fry the fish up for each order.  The carnitas and lengua tacos are also terrific - the lengua is pretty oily, however.  I don't think it's a bad thing - it reminds me of my favorite old-school taco joint in East Moline, IL (Adolphs Mexican Foods - check it out!) - and it certainly doesn't take away from the flavor.  Rather, I think it adds to it.  But I could see that grossing some people out... I will say that this place IS pretty expensive.  I think they could stand to take at least $0.50 off of all of their tacos - especially with all the taxes we have to pay for food in SF now that are basically funding the costs that they would otherwise have to pay to their employees...\n\nI used to order the chips, salsa, and guacamole with my meal but have since stopped, as I don't really think they're anything to write home about.  At the very least, just get the chips and guacamole and then take some of the free salsa that they have by the silverware - it's a LOT tastier than the pico de gallo (more or less) that they make you pay for... \n\nIt looks like this place has a pretty decent happy hour, but the environment is a little weird - usually one big group of office workers - so I would probably opt to try that and sit outside if you really can't think of anywhere more interesting to go.  I'm also intrigued by their breakfast burrito selection and am definitely going to have to try that sometime soon!", "author": "Tay H."}

The lady behind the counter was nice, but the food is where I had a bit of an issue. I ordered a coca-cola in a glass which was great and then I got a chicken burrito and some chips and salsa. The chips were nice and fresh, but the salsa didn't have a lot of taste. I was looking for something a bit more stronger, but it was just bland. The burrito was ok. It wasn't gross or anything, but the sauces inside mix together a bit too much so after awhile the burrito gets really soggy and almost has a watery feel to it.

Up that hot sauce game. Either a typical Mission green sauce, or a La Victoria (San Jose) -style orange sauce would hit the spot so much better than the current mild/med salsa.\n\n2.) This is a personal preference, but a griddle toasted tortilla would really be a level up. Throw it on a for 5-10 secs for that subtle crunch - helping offset that sogginess from wrapping a steaming burrito in foil would be worth an extra $.50 to me.\n\nI grew up eating out of a lot of gritty taquerias, in contrast this place is fresh, clean and i think the kitchen staff and customer service at this place are top notch.", "author": "Priyan P."}

I don't need 8 pounds of chorizo, egg, potatoes and cheese in my belly at 8 in the morning. With that said, they are fantastic! They chorizo makes the burrito by far! It gives it a little kick that'll wake up and give you a solid start to the day.\n\nHowever, I'm not a huge fan of their lunch or normal menu - the tacos in my opinion are just so-so. I always expect Mexican food to have more flavor, their tacos are pretty bland but what does a white irish dude know? I haven't tried the rest of the food so I can't speak to that but I've heard great things about their salads - I'll have to check that out next. \n\nThe food is reasonably price, pretty cheap actually. In an area that I think lacks reasonably priced good food this place is great! Outside of the breakfast burrito, I'd rather branch out a bit farther and hit a better Mexican up. But like I said, the food is reasonably priced, the staff is always extremely friendly, it's in a prime location, their breakfast burrito is off the charts but their tacos are so-so.", "author": "Sean D."}

New places tend to make noise fast, and when you've got legit owners opening up a Mexican place in the old Seller's spot, you've got yourself a potential hot spot.  I loved Seller's, mostly because there was always space to eat, and on a nice day, sitting al fresco was amazing for people watching.  During my morning perusal of Eater SF, I saw the brief mentioning of the opening of Uno Dos Tacos, and immediately sent it to my old co-worker (we used to work on 2nd/Mission). We met up around 11:45 and the line was already significant; how did everyone else hear about this so fast?! Anyway, I ended up ordering the Beef Asada plate with a side of guac and it was DELICIOUS. Pricey, sure, but a nice little upgrade from my typical Chipotle bowl. My friend had a pork taco and a fish taco, and at the end, admitted that he'll probably be hungry later.  Well duh. The corn tortillas was really what sold me on the place, and while my friend seemed to think that Tropisueno down the street might have the leg up, I sort of think this place might be good for an \"every now and then\" meal. I would definitely make another visit back here when I'm in the mood for a non-fast food experience.", "author": "Lisa I."}

Without your burritos I don't know how I would make it through the day. Seriously, this stuff is brain food that I'd credit as partly responsible for everyone of my career achievements in the past year. However, you've got to change up your music selection. It's so bad. If I have to listen to Cumbia de la Cerveza one more time I'm going to lose my mind, a mind expanded by your eggy burrito concoctions. There is so much great Latin music out there (except Ranchero)! Why do you insist on playing the same shitty songs every day. I remember one day you guys played Santana and it was fantastic. Another day you played alternative Latin rock and that was good too. But every other day you play the same 10 songs on repeat. Please, for the lost of Santa Salsa con Huevos change it up!", "author": "Trevor C."}

Food was good, seasoned ok but they forgot to add the salsa or hot sauce to my to-go box.  I wasn't about to make a return trip just to get it.  with the salsa the tacos probably would've been better.\n\nTwo big problems with the order.  First, I ordered one each of a fish, chicken, and pork taco.  On the receipt, it shows that I paid for a chicken, beef, and pork taco, each at $3.25.  Second problem: my order somehow got lost.  I waited a solid 10min before having to ask on my order status and it was obvious that none of the cooks could locate the order.  So, they hastily put it together and that was that.  Yes, I ordered at 12:30pm in the heat of the lunch rush, but missing an order is kind of a big thing.  But, I saved $1.25 on the fish taco so I guess that worked out.\n\nWill probably return to see what the actual turnaround time is on orders, and whether it is worth replacing this for chipotle.", "author": "Garrett L."}

Once I started eating the burrito, it was amazing! It had perfectly cooked carnitas with just the right amount of beans, salsa fresca, crema, y guacamole. At least for me, it was just the right amount of protein, carbs, and fats I needed that didn't give me that afternoon slump, or those extra carbohydrates from the rice.

It wasn't great and as another yelper mentioned, it really is a Chipotle alternative. You pick from the menu and do not have a lot of choices to customize your burrito. They only asked me if I wanted to add cheese. I didn't have a choice of beans like you have at other places. Maybe you do, but they do not tell you your choices at the order counter. My burrito came with meat that didn't have much flavor, pico de gallo, cheese, and black beans. You can add some roasted jalapeno salsa which has some good heat to it, and it definitely made up for the lack of flavor on the meat. I typically do not have them put salsa in my burrito because it can make it your experience a wet mess (soggy tortilla), and if you have ever tried to eat one and have salsa juice drip onto your dress shirt...... it's no bueno! I always put salsa on right before I take a bite. I asked for no salsa but instead asked for onions and cilantro. No can do because it only comes in the pica de gallo. \n\nMy personal choice of ingredients for a basic burrito is carne asada, cheese, avocado slices, onions/cilantro, rice, refried beans or refried black beans. I can only get this at a few places that are consistently fresh and delicious (Taqueria Cancun #1, Pancho Villa #2, and El Farolito #3).\n\n\nThe Good:\nAlternative to long burrito lines in the FIDI\nFresh ingredients\nTasty Salsa\nLots of tables available indoors and on the patio\n\nThe Bad:\nCan't customize your burrito filling \n\nThe Ugly:\nCarne asada had no flavor. \n\nI would only come back to this place again to try their tacos which seem to be more popular.", "author": "David M."}

When I walked towards the restaurant, it had loud music playing with lots of people sitting in the front patio area after work chatting over a drink or beer. The environment was relaxing and chill, which was a great plus. After walking in, I saw how even more crowded it was and was so thankful my friend arrived early to get a table. When I got up to order my food and drink, I was slightly confused by the happy hour menu because the four items had no explanation, which was confusing for someone who comes here for the first time. Nonetheless, I asked what the items were and ended up ordering flautas, which were chicken wrapped into flute-like tubes, drizzled with salsa and sauce, and topped with other veggies. When the flautas were ready, I quickly realized that was not enough food, so I ordered two pork tacos. Both dishes tasted good but were not uniquely or overly amazing, so I am happy that I tried the food here, but I probably will not come back often.", "author": "Annie C."}

So, I finally decided that on my 40th birthday I wanted to get lunch there with my girlfriends and finally see what this place had in store for us!  We had been walking around the city so we were quite parched, so we started with a pitcher of Margaritas!!  Complete with chili salted rims on our glasses.  Yummmmm!  Next up, Luis Flores recommended that we get the guacamole and chips!!  The tortilla chips were so fresh and the guacamole was soon good that we ordered another bowl!  Their salsas are also really tasty!! For our tacos, we ordered Vegetariano, Chicken, Asada, Carnitas, and Pescado tacos that came with salsas and beans!!  The tacos are OUT OF THIS WORLD!!  I personally had three they were that good!!!  And what really made the tacos so incredibly tasty was the handmade corn tortillas that they made fresh right on the spot!  The fresh tortillas were so tender and delicious!! Luis Flores, as well as the rest of the staff were so gracious to us! They went out of there way to make us feel so welcome! And for dessert we had churros to take with us for on our train ride home!  I definitely recommend this place!!  Great ambiance, friendly amazing staff, and scrumptious food!!!

Of the four tacos I liked the beef one the most and then the fish taco.  The fish taco wasn't as crunchy as I had hoped but still had good texture.  They had a sweet salsa and a habanero sauce (was on all the tables) to add onto your tacos.  I was a little hesitant at first to try the habanero sauce, but after my bf tried it (he has a high tolerance for hot stuff), he said it wasn't hot, it turned out to be slightly hot to me, not enough to make you ask for water.  I also tried the aguas frescas - watermelon, lime and mint.  The drink was refreshing, slightly sweet and not overly sweet.  Plenty of seating inside and outside of the restaurant and walking distance from the 5th and Mission parking garage.  Because this restaurant is in the financial district I expect them to be very busy during the lunch work week.  I would definitely come back.", "author": "Joycelyn L."}

We came in on a Saturday and ordered 2 fish tacos, 1 carnitas, 1 tinga, 1 carne asada, and a side of chips and salsa. Unfortunately, the only taco I liked was the carnitas and basically left the tinga and carne asada taco half-eaten. The tinga was flavorless and the carne asada was so dry it was almost like jerky (or day old taco meat). The fish tacos were ok, but they were a little greasy. The chips were good, but the fresh salsa had a lot of pepper in it and overwhelmed the salsa. My husband and I can usually power through \"ok to not-great\" tasting food and are pretty forgiving when we go out to eat, but the food here was just not good.", "author": "Trinh N."}
