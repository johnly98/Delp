I checked on Yelp for reservations (super convenient btw) and luckily there was availability for the later night. If you don't have a reservation, you may run the risk of having to wait a bit, because it gets crowded on a Friday night . When we arrived, we were a bit early, but when our reservation time came up, we were seated right away.\n\nThe ambiance is quirky and the service was great! Our server was attentive and I appreciated her fun and joking energy. Between two of us, we got the following:\n\n- Spaghetti & Meatballs (+1 Extra Meatball = 4 Total)\n- Cheesy Garlic Bread\n- Mozzarella Cauliflower Balls\n- 2 Beers on Draft\n\nThe star of the show for me was the spaghetti and meatballs, which was the reason why we came back. I don't think it's meant to be flashy, nor a game changing dish, but it's a dish that provided me with such warmth and comfort to my taste buds and soul. It's like a warm hug being given to your stomach - it's just such a solid plate of spaghetti and meatballs. The meatball was the right texture, not dry or overly seasoned. I'd be curious to try it in the sandwich. The mozzarella cauliflower balls were an unexpected treat, as we tried this for the first time. It's like a friend mac and cheese ball without the mac and my friend who doesn't really seek cauliflower, really enjoyed it. For the cheesy garlic bread, I probably would pass on it next time because the complimentary bread would have been sufficient for the pasta.\n\nWe initially intended to order two plates of the spaghetti and meatballs, but luckily pulled back. The whole meal was just right (with the added meatball), leaving us feeling content, if not full. I'll definitely be back to try the other things on the menu!", "author": "Vincent L."}

To be told that they were completely booked with reservations. Hold on I thought walk ins was welcome. Well the host suggested other wise telling me and my party of 6 (2 adults and 3kids) we would have to wait 45 minutes or sit at the bar. Words was exchange and another patron stated she never heard of that. When do you need reservations.\nAnother 15mins went by when the host let us know that someone had cancelled. Yeah right there was never a reservation to begin with. \n\nNow the waiter she was hella rude maybe because we asked for the free bread twice, and as our party wasn't aware that they don't split checks. When the check came everything was itemize. For instance if you order the spaghetti and meat balls on the menu its a flat rate. However on the receipt they charge the toppings separately.\n\nI never mentioned that this was my first time and been wanting to eat here since they was in that hole in the wall across from Pizza Hut, yeah. Take that Ms. I'VE BEEN WORKING HERE FOR 5 YEARS. Her attitude sucked. The bartender rocks and has great customer service.\n\nAs we proceeded to leave the table the host rudely came over and stated that not tipping affect all of them. Look I work for tips and tips are given on good customer service and that I didn't receive from the beginning. Now because you decided to seat us and take our order that's your job. However being rude with gestures, facial expressions, and sighs don't get you jack.\n\nBeware!!! I won't be going back and will share my experience with others that want to dine with them. Its really sad too because the food was actually good.", "author": "Charlotte T."}

The spaghetti w/meatballs is definitely good, though it's not much different than what you could make at home.

Steak with potatoes and asparagus was ok.\n\nDiverse drink options (including a couple cheap beers), eclectic vibe, and very friendly service.

Just spaghetti, bread, salad, and fries. All other dishes just said avail later. So note there's not much selection if you order lunch for delivery through Caviar.\n\nMy coworker who got the spaghetti loved it. Especially the meatballs. She said they rivalled a spot we frequently order from where they actually specialize in meatballs. I tried some of the fries and they were fine. Thicker than I like so very potato-y. I tend to prefer thinner fries as I like my fries crispy. These were kind of limp and soggy. The delivery time probably didn't help, but they also didn't have the nice golden fried color. If you have a fry craving, I don't think these would fulfill that.\n\nSolid spaghetti and meatballs, but I wish they offered more variety on their lunch delivery menu. It seems like you have more options when placing a takeout order. So why not offer the same options for delivery as well? Seems kinda weird to me.", "author": "Elena N."}

I ordered the Buccatini Alfredo ($17), which was very creamy! I usually like a lot of sauce packed on my pasta, so this worked for me. I just had to add a bit of salt to taste as it was heavier on the creamy side, and needed just a tad more of savoriness. My fiance order the spaghetti ($17), and he most enjoyed the meatballs! Not sure what kind of meat is in it, but he enjoyed it! I love thick pasta noodles that are filled with carbs (lol), so I'm a fan. \n\nFor cocktails, we ordered the Lychee Margarita and the Matcha Panacea. I wouldn't be dying to come back for the drinks as they weren't anything special.  \n\nThe ambiance is casual and fun. It's a good place to go if meeting up with a couple people. There didn't seem to be a lot of tables for large parties, although there was one large family seated at the corner tables so it's possible I'm sure.

Three flavors predominate: garlic, lemon, and hot peppers. None of them backs down and somehow together they achieve a perfect balance for the silky risotto and the lovingly infused prawns. It was impossible to take my last bite until there were no bites left to take. I suspect the presence of lemon oil, due to the wonderful intensity of the lemon flavor (meant to ask the server but forgot!) My server did say after I ordered that it was her personal favorite as well.\n\nMy wife had the spaghetti and meatballs and waxed enthusiastic about the meatballs in particular: I had a taste and found them imaginatively flavored and textured, tho I was so immersed in my prawn experience that I was reluctant to let anything interrupt it for long. Our vegan son had the spaghetti marinara, I think, and was very happy with his entree too.\n\nWe lived in SF from the early seventies thru 1999, including years in the Mission near 24th Street, and now return as tourists from Fairfield several times a year. Our son moved back to SF to a neighborhood in the Haight, close to the Panhandle. It was he who suggested Emmy's, which we had never heard of.

That was my thought process and it worked out swell. The big ol' meatballs in the spaghetti and meatballs dish were hearty, well-seasoned, and enough food to fill me. The noodles were cooked well and the sauce wasn't overbearing or over-portioned. Again, if you have spaghetti in the title, you should nail it.

There were eight of us, and everyone seemed to enjoy their meals.\n\nNow, the bad part: Assuming it would be hectic, I made reservations online through their website more than a week in advance (on a Thursday). I received a confirmation email for the correct date. The next evening (a Friday, but a week before the reservation), I received a set of calls and text messages asking where my group was and when we'd be arriving, and then if we were still coming. The next day, I called to confirm the correct reservation date--they had no record of the mix-up or of contacting me multiple times. They confirmed my upcoming reservation.\n\nFast-forward to the day of the reservation. That afternoon, I received another confirmation email for the correct time. A couple of hours later I receive a couple of texts messages: the first one asked if we could change our reservation time and arrive earlier. I replied and said we would try, but we had several people coming from outside the city. Their reply: \"Ok thank you! We will try our best as well.\" Three hours later, I received a follow-up text: we were on the waiting list.

And for the fun. You don't go to Emmy's and order a fettuccini alfredo for your entree. That's a rookie mistake. Their starter salads are always excellent, as is their cheesy garlic bread. The cocktails are seasonal, creative, and strong. The carafes of house red wine are very well-priced and very delicious.\n\nThe atmosphere is as good as the food -- and that's saying a lot. I always ask everyone I've gone to dinner there with to try to articulate the vibe, and everyone comes up with something different. My best attempt at describing it is -- mom's home cooked spaghetti and meatballs, but mom is a badass Rosie the Riveter with bicep tattoos and eyebrow piercings, and she's gonna serve you your spaghetti and meatballs and you're gonna f***ing like it. Because it's delicious and hearty and good for the soul. And the decor, the decor I can only describe -- with a completely straight face -- as postmodern second wave feminism on acid.\n\nThe waitresses are amazing, kind, memorable, and fun. There's a photo booth in the back which is always a great way to remember a particularly exuberant night.\n\nEmmy's has been, and always will be, my favorite restaurant in SF.

Maybe folks were telling me about this place for years and my selective hearing blocked it out. Anywho, on a cool date night, we decided on this place for it's cool vibe and good food. This was told to me by my date. I had no idea how great it was...\n\nLiving in my \"bubble\" between work and home, I've never really ventured out to outer mission as much so when I arrived here, I thought man, this is far! LOL. From the moment you approach the outside, you know it's going to be an eclectic place. The details in the place really give it personality. From the lights to the tin roof bar to the aprons hanging on the clothes line. Then there's the menu. What a really cool menu! Yes, it's busy but love the colors and personality. It really reflects what a cool place this is. Our server was really helpful and chill. She checked in on us often and gave us our space when needed. \n\nFor dinner, we started with the Shack Caesar salad for $10 and added anchovies for $1. Whole romaine leaves, creamy dressing and fresh parmesan. I love salads that come pretty whole, like an iceberg wedge salad, ones that require a fork and knife. Nothing out of the ordinary as far as flavor, I liked the salad. I really like the option of anchovies which brought a great salty element to the overall bite. For my meal, I got the Linguine for $17. This dish was filled with mussels, clams, Spanish chorizo in an herb butter garlic and white wine sauce. OH EM GEE! I couldn't see the noodles! There were so many mussels, clams and chorizo! I'm only kidding but man it was packed with flavor and the dish was huge. I highly recommend this dish if you're into seafood. \n\nI'm gonna say it again, what a great spot for a date night! It had such a great vibe, awesome food and great service. This is one of those SF gems that people will always remember when visiting or giving out recommendations. If you're in the area (or even if you're not), make your way to this joint.

It clearly speaks to the changing mission street culture, young, white, \"trying to hard to be in\" 25 - 35-year-olds.  The menu reflects a mashup of dishes heavy on Italian inspiration with some extras tossed in for excitement. A few things to know if you are planning your first visit; Parking isn't the easiest in that part of the Mission - so plan accordingly. You will need reservations. If you are sensitive to noise levels - bring earplugs and opt out. The high ceilings and poor sound meant for a very loud dinner, more so when the wait staff has to talk over the noise to reach you.\nThe food options are diverse and eclectic, both the traditional spaghetti and meatballs were filling, but the sauce wasn't the best seasoned (somewhat reminded me of \"sauce for non-Italia\u200bns\"). I prefer mine with more depth, however, the Spaghetti Puttanesca had great flavor and didn't overdo the olives to the extent that it was off-putting. Now I will admit, I am a meatball snob and try as I might, don't consider baked meatballs really a \"meatball\" just simply seasoned ground meat balls,  I come from the \"fry them in a cast iron skillet\". At our table of 6 all commented on them, and while they were tasty; the \"mush\" factor from them being overworked in preparation was evident. I had the meatball sandwich, which needed at least one if not two more meatballs to be balanced with the bread as they smashed so much. On a \"must try\" is the coconut mussels. Truly well done and along with the prawn ceviche and the puttanesca were the meal highlights. By the way - the menu tries hard to be \"fun\" and \"eclectic\" to match the vibe of the place, but it mostly is just a mess if you as vision limited. All and all, it can be a fun night out of drinking and eating with the right group of friends - but not a date or night where talking is part of your meal.", "author": "Frank S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-11", "description": "I've been wanting to try Emmy's Spaghetti Shack for some time now. Ever since I walked past it on this fascinating strip of Mission south of 24th (I've also wanted to try the Sushi place and Peruvian place - seriously one of the best hidden gems for food in the City).\n\nDue to the storm causing a tree to fall on a Bart train, I knew I would be ejected onto 24th Street station and figured I would take the quick walk from there. What I didn't realize was the rain was coming down torrential and sideways so by the time I got to Emmy's I was completely soaked. Fortunately the staff is incredibly nice (one of the things that makes it 5 star in my opinion) and got me seated at the bar and were quickly attentive even if I wanted to spend some time looking over.\n\nAs I opened the menu I got the complimentary focaccia with oil and vinegar and quickly went to the drinks - hey, I was soaked externally so might as well get soaked internally. At this point a few others with my idea came in and the staff realized how bad it had been down the road.\n\nTo start, I got the Pear Shack Mule. I had been debating wines, but as I didn't know what I was going to order figure booze would be a solid first round. I love mules, I love pear - had to order it. It was delicious, you get tasty pear, not too strong and made me forget a bit that I was just as covered in liquid. Star for this!\n\nBut I came for food, too! The cheesy garlic bread were a must, but I had trouble deciding between Emmy's Famous Spaghetti and Meatballs, or the Linguine with mussels, clams, and chorizo. On one hand, it is the signature dish; on the other hand, I love a garlicy linguine and clams. I brought this up to the bartender and she wanted to push me to the spaghetti but also brought in other staff and her friends for their input. One of her friend's husband has only ever ordered the spaghetti for the 15 years this place has been open and that solidified it.\n\nThe cheesy garlic bread was okay. Garlicky Texas toast topped with cheese. Moses' Beard I miss good, greasy garlic knots. This was the lowest point of the meal - aside from being soaked.\n\nThe Spaghetti quickly made up for it as the steaming plate of noodles and 3 meatballs covered in cheese appeared before me. Perfectly cooked, the sauce didn't need anything either, and while not the best meatballs I've had, they were good. Tried to get as many forkfuls of spaghetti, meatball, and garlic bread as I could. A star for the food!\n\nI also ordered a second Pear Shack Mule around this time.\n\nNow to cap out the 5 star rating: music and ambiance. The music was an 80s Pandora playlist, guessing David Bowie (RIP) but with a good mix of Talking Heads, Tears for Fears, and other great pop tracks. I LOVE this music and have my own 80s mix. As well, the decorations in the shack are delightful - between the futuristic horses running through a waterfall rainbow, the hanging pantaloons, the photo booth, and funny signs. Just coming here to look around is worth it. \n\nAgain, have to get back to the staff. All of them were hard working and great. Even though the bartender was talking with her friends likewise trapped by the weather, she was attentive to me and the other bar patrons. She even apologized for talking with \"the family\" but I thought she was great and tipped justly. \n\nI would gladly return for to try that linguine and experience more of the Shack.

After glancing over the menu, I was excited to find a great deal of vegan dishes and ZOODLES! The perfect option when you're wanting some Italian food but don't want to carb overload.  A rainy Saturday night, my fianc\u00e9 and I made it down to the mission to dig into some good 'ol Italian food at Emmy's Spaghetti Shack.  \n\nWe arrived around 8PM and were told there would be about a 30-45 minute wait for a table for two. No problem, put your name down and grad a drink next door at the Royal Cuckoo (highly recommended!) and the staff from ESS will text you when the table is ready.  After one very strong Manhattan, some good live jazz music and the wait time flew by for our table.  We were immediately sat towards the back and greeted by the server with some water.  I went for the Zoodles and my fianc\u00e9 choose the famous spaghetti and meatballs.  I also got a glass of the house red wine (reasonably priced at $8 a glass).

The spaghetti comes with three HUGE meatballs and what my fianc\u00e9 said was a nice al dente pasta and perfect marinara sauce (that I saw on the menu is vegan).

Highly do not recommend for parties. \n\nWe went here for my wife's birthday and I made a reservation at 7 for 9 people. This place is not good for large parties. We got to Emmys at 6:55. We were not seated until 7:40. There was only one table large enough for our party and there was already a family sitting there so we had to wait for them to leave. When we finally got seated, gave us cheesy garlic bread on the house. Which was fantastic. Everything about every meal was fantastic. We had a great time. Before we got seated we asked them to chill our birthday pie. They did no problem but they charged us $3.50 for 5 people as a cakage fee so it was $17.50. The pie cost me $5. \n\nAnyway, whatever, the food is great. Service is okay.", "author": "Be L."}

We ordered the spaghetti and meatballs ( the highlight of the meal) and the Orecchiette. Both of the dishes were on the more salty side but the orecchiette was defiantly really salty and the flavors did not mesh well. Highly recommend getting the spaghetti with meatballs along with the pear mule or the drinks they serve in the boot.\n\nService: \nIt seems that all the waiters here are in a bbad mood. From the time we got seated to when we left it seems that smiles were rare here.

I'm from Rhode Island and my maiden name ended with an i so my standards for Italian food are super high. While Emmy's was good it was nothing to write home about (although here I am writing). Major points on Yelp reservations since it made seating our large group a breeze. Our waitress was friendly and handled our largeish group pretty well. We ordered the garlic bread as an appetizer and unfortunately it came out about a minute before our entrees did. Maybe that was by design, but I always like appetizers to be done before the mains come. I went with the classic spaghetti and meatballs, mostly because I love them, secondly because the photos on Yelp looked so damn delicious. It was photogenic yes, but not the most flavorful spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had. Overall with so many great dining options in SF I don't think I'd head in again. If you don't eat much Italian food and are craving it then I think Emmy's would be a great spot for you to check out.

I came here with my coworkers, and we ordered a whole unofficial tasting menu. \n\nAppetizers:\n- Mozzarella balls: absolutely delicious. I don't normally like mozzarella, but these were perfection, fried with the texture of a tater tot and savory. \n- shrimp ceviche: kind of out of place, and the shrimp was cooked, but it was top notch! Really refreshing and punchy with flavor. Even the from a guy who makes his own ceviche loved it. \n- garlic bread: this was alright. It was slices of toast, with pretty raw minced garlic and cilantro all over it. WARNING: this will give you garlic breath for a couple days at least. No exaggeration. \n\nMain dishes:\n- Bucatini with mushroom and leek: this was one of my favorites. The bucatini is like a short spaghetti straw (it literally has a tunnel/hole through it!). It was really creamy, and the mushroom and leek offered it awesome mix of texture and subtle flavors.\n- Fall pappardelle: this one was just okay. By the time I got to this dish, the pasta was cooled and stuck together in an unappetizing mass, and I remembered it tasting slightly bitter \n- Zoodles: SO GOOD. I am a converted zoodle fanatic now. Everything about this dish was just perfect: the texture of the zoodles themselves (slightly crunchy), the fat juicy shrimp, and whatever sauce/seasoning they had complemented everything super well. \n- spaghetti with meatballs: I know they're famous for this dish, but I think my expectations were much higher. The spaghetti was good, the meatballs fell apart, it was tasty, but it really didn't stand out.", "author": "Ke C."}

The marinara sauce was subtly flavored, & just zesty enough to do its job of covering the pasta.\n\nThe meatballs were on point w texture.  They were nice & tender, while being thoroughly cooked.  The bread in them comes through though, & I prefer a meatier meatball.  No harm, no foul.\n\nThe meatball sandwich was surprisingly the superior dish.  The addition of fresh basil, provolone, & ciabatta bread elevated the meatballs & the marinara sauce to a higher level.  The basil cut out some of the sweetness in the sauce, for the better.  It just worked out so well.  Score.\n\nAll in all, Emmy's is a solid, super casual joint.  The vibe?  Italian diner.  I thought it was a cross between The Gold Spike & Sparky's.

You can and should make reservations through Yelp to be safe.\n\nThe half-booth seating (there are full booths for larger parties) puts you pretty close with other tables as is the norm with that type of seating. For this reason, it probably isn't great for an early date (before you're comfortable with each other) or if you're the type who is very uncomfortable in that type of seating. Again, nothing abnormal for city restaurants.\n\nThe only minor \"complaint\" is that the initial greet/drink order took a while (one of those times where you're ready to order everything by the time the server comes around), but I don't get bent out of shape about that and neither should you!\n\nThe fried cauliflower mozzarella was good as expected. We both ordered spaghetti and meatballs (as did the couple next to us) and were very happy with it. I have some leftover waiting for me for dinner tonight. It rivals a lot of the homemade spaghetti/meatballs I've had and is the best I can remember having at a restaurant.\n\nI had a Chianti which was good as well. We didn't order dessert so no report there unfortunately.\n\nHighly recommended when you're in the mood for spaghetti and meatballs (can't speak for the rest yet!).", "author": "J.P. M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-02-26", "description": "This is his story, not mine but I'm going to tell you anyway. Ten years ago, he was younger, childless, and free. He had the absolute freedom to do anything and everything he wanted and this was the place he hang out the most often, besides that bar, which was at the time, owned by a local celebrity with an odd name and picture still painted on the side of the wall, not far from here. There was a woman, who he dated, she was a roommate to the bar owner. She lived nearby and she was in love with him. He would dine and wine her in this restaurant, in its prior location, sometimes several times a week. It was a place filled with eclectic decorations, a little kitsch, a little spunk, plenty of visual entertainment. The food was filling and good, and the price was good. \n\nHe had not been here for many years and not before it closed and moved. He was delighted that it reopened, so on one evening he invited me here. To be quite honest, I think he invited himself here and I was there to listen to his stories. I think he needed to tell someone about his past, when he was good looking, younger, flush with money, incredibly driven, had his own tech firm, and he absolutely cornered the artist / bookish / creative types of women all over town. The list of women grew over the years and no one could seem to let go of him, because he was aloof  but he took great care of each relationship, paid great compliments to these ladies and treated them to meals in places like this, very good food, not gonna to break your bank, great service by friendly servers, and incredibly easy to spend a hour or two enjoying your food while admiring the decorative art on the wall. It was an atmospheric restaurant with good booth seating. It's both date and family friendly. And the menu looked like a little kids wrote it, in crayon style print. All in all, a winner.\n\nHe asked me what prompts me to write Yelp reviews. I told him that only if the food was good and the experience was memorable. I almost never write bad reviews. I eat out lots, and I don't always check in nor write reviews. It would need to pique my interest for me to check in and it would made a positive impression for me to write about it. I don't want to invite bad karma. I added.\n\nI think restaurants like this became a San Francisco institution. It is often the young who write reviews, but it's the middle age men and women who remember the city as their playground to come back to places like this, to reminisce, to fall in love again with their memories of the past. \n\nPerhaps the greatest strength and weakness for me is the sense of detachment. I enjoyed going out on occasion to eat with old friends because they can unload on me, and I'd show great empathy, and I listen intensely to their stories. Later on, I might write about them but too often the only thing that motivates me to write about any place is the food, and not the stories they told me. In that way, I'm very much like my almost 2 year old St. Barnard and Golden Retriver mix, Abby, I'm very motivated by food, and memories of the food. The stories were often just decorations.\n\nI remembered that evening, as he told me stories about these women, one particular lady who lived near here, his voice filled with regret and longing, longing for a past that he so dearly needed to hold on, as it was the best decade of his life and filled with so much potential. Yet it fleeted so ever quickly. I was busy eating my plate of food as he told me stories after stories. And when my plate was done, I eyed his greedily, \"Are you going to finish your spaghetti and meatballs?\" He said no, and I cleaned his plate. It was finger licking delicious.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Thankfully, Emmy's was open late enough (11pm) and we were able to get sat immediately. We were cutting it pretty close (it was about 10:15), but the host and server didn't seem too annoyed by our late arrival. There were still a lot of people still eating, and the vibe was loud and lively. They were playing top 40 rap from the 90's and everyone, including the servers, were singing and dancing. We got sat at a booth in the middle of the restaurant and were given created, handwritten menus that were fun to read. \n\nWe all ordered wine and beer (I thought their wine by the glass list was pretty diverse) and an order of the cheesy garlic bread. After a couple of bites, I had to give away my slices; the raw garlic is so intense that I knew I'd be reeking of garlic if I took any more bites. We all kept pointing out tasty-sounding dishes (so basically all of them) on the menu, but when it came time to order, we all went for the spaghetti and meatballs. I had been told in the past not to expect real Italian food, but I thought the meatballs tasted super authentic and the sauce was really good too! The portion size was more than generous and each order came with three large meatballs. I definitely took home a decent amount at the end of the meal.

Let me start with the fact that as soon as I walked in I could feel unwelcoming vibes. I tried my best to ignore them. As an out of town \"tourist\" I heard raving reviews about their spaghetti and meatballs. My brother and I were so excited to finally get a taste of what we had heard so many good things about. We sit down and it took forever to even be greeted/get water. We had to wave down one of the managers to give us some water. I'm honestly all about second chances, so I let that part slide. \nWe then got a plate of \"bread\" which I noticed was just pieces of hard stale bread gathered from a huge pile of bread stacked together in this plastic bin- Yuck! Cold and hard.\nNext- out spaghetti was mediocre at best. The meatballs tasted good, but the pasta was almost bare\nLacking sauce. So we ate what tasted plain noodles with okay meatballs. Cool.\nThis part really set me over the edge- as a tourist I am\nWanting to feel hospitality. No no no, not here. We were RUSHED. As soon as they could tell we were finishing our pasta they came around for the check. I was still finishing my wine and my brother his beer. They asked us- while we were still relaxing and enjoying our drink- if we could GET UP from our table and drink our drinks in the back corner of the restaurant so other guests could sit down I've never been so baffled. I get up to go look at where she wanted us to move to and man it makes me more upset. The tables looked like little kiddie tables with sprite cans and soda stains all over the floor and tables by a pinball machine! So they wanted us to move from our nice table to a sticky uncleared corner in the back so they could seat other guests, although we weren't done with our drinks. I'm still shook.

I'm a man of simple, south-of-the-border tastes, an irony I know, as I am a Far Easterner. But they decided to close, and I was left with nothing. NOTHING. Then I find out Emmy's took over the space? EMMY'S? Do you mean that thrift-shop corner spot up the street with the movable naugahyde booths and the Chef Boyardee spaghetti? I'm giving up my my menudo for that? And indeed I did as I decided to give the new Emmy's a try this past week, and what can I say? Well, it was like the big reveal at the end of an episode of \"Trading Spaces\" where the wife sobbed uncontrollably at how her bedroom walls were covered with chicken feathers. Decorator ego run amok.\n\nI didn't sob when I walked into Emmy's, but let's say I felt a strong case of Church Lady small-mouth when I saw the crowded tables, the bustling kitchen and the full bar with the music blaring from the speakers. Funky, vintage vibe tailor-made for the millennial mindset. I was about to turn around when the preoccupied hostess asked me if I was going to eat or drink. Gee, I didn't think it was a choice at a restaurant. I thought you could do both, but feeling like Sophie with her two crying children in front of the Nazi, I blurted out \"Eat...yes, eat\". She motioned me to sit at the bar in between alcohol-infused hipsters with their elbows firmly planted on the counter. I was given their graffiti-styled menu where I had to make out the words in the near-dark (photo: http://bit.ly/1wAVjeb). Pretty soon I was having a Helen Keller moment until I recognized the word Caesar. OK then, I shall start with the $10 Shack Caesar.\n\nIt was pretty good if too overly sauced with their house-made creamy dressing (photo: http://bit.ly/1E5EuzT). I like how they left the hearts intact the way I prefer a Caesar, but I'm bummed I couldn't see I could have had anchovies for a dollar extra since I couldn't read that footnote in the shadows of the hard liquor bottles. For my entree, I didn't return to their locally renowned meatballs but instead went healthy with the $16 Zoodles Rasta Pasta. This, I liked a lot, because the pasta was replaced with zucchini and other squash cut into a noodle-like consistency and then covered with pieces of roasted chicken and a light marinara sauce (photo: http://bit.ly/1K1HVej). With a little grated Parmesan, it was a nice light alternative to their pasta. It actually made me want to get one of those Vegetti zucchini spiral cutters to make my own. I would have enjoyed it if there weren't people behind me talking loud as they sipped their Chablis. Now if they started serving pupusas, maybe I wouldn't have minded as much.\n\nFOOD - 3.5 stars...overdressed Caesar compensated by zoodles well turned...I'd come back just for that if only...\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...crowded especially unbearable at the bar and quite loud from all the patrons chattering away\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...no complaints about the serviceable bartender whom I has to communicate in sign language...like I said, Helen Keller moment\nTOTAL - 3 stars...Emmy and her loud, hipster-heavy vibe makes me cry nostalgically for El Zocalo.", "author": "Ed U."}

That was nice.\n\nWould I go back? Sure, and I still gave 20% as overall we enjoyed ourselves, but it's too bad that for whatever reason we received lackluster service which meant that they didn't get revenue from another beer and we decided not to stick around for dessert.", "author": "Mitch K."}

Last night the server was so nice that once a booth came open on the opposite wall (kitchen side) she moved us.  Please look at making these booths more accommodating for everyone of any size.  I am not a small person but i am also not a very large person giving people room to eat drink and enjoy themselves is and should be the priority of any establishment and dont get me wrong we have enjoyed your establishment for 8 years now and will keep coming back, but wont take a booth on the rights side wall.   \n\nI really hope that management will fix the situation of the booths on the right side wall. \n\nThanks so much for such fabulous restaurant in the mission", "author": "B H."}

My friend and i shared the spaghetti and the other one ordered the risotto.  Half way through our meal, my friend discovered a hair strand in her risotto.  Initial reaction was of shock and then kind of got grossed out.  We called over one of the servers, the one with nice bangs and told her about the situation.  Her response threw us for a loop! She said: \"Are you sure it's not one of yours?...Just kidding.\"  I'm all for humor and all that, but honestly, that was inappropriate. The way she said it too was of pure annoyance.  Appalled by that,  I called over another server, the tall one with impressive cat-eye make up skills, to ask if there's a manager we can speak with. She said something to the effect of \"they pitch in and manage all together\"...okay..sure. We told her what nice bangs server said and her response just totally jaws-to-the-floored us. \"Oh sorry about that, I'm sure she didn't mean it and she said she was kidding.  We can replace it or just take it out of your bill\"  We were totally dismissed and told off in such a condescending way!  At this point, we just wanted to get out of there. We didn't finish our meal.  I felt so bad because I've been telling my friends how good Emmy's is only to be ruined by a hair strand and bad service. Another server approached us, the one with gorgeous long blonde hair, to ask how we're doing and we told her what happened.  She apologized for both servers, which she didn't need to do, and we thanked her for being the nice one that at least tried to smooth out the situation. My friend even went as far as to say that her kindness made it better.  After getting our bill, nice bangs went up to our table to apologize, trying to explain that maybe we didn't hear her say that she was kidding..blah..blah..blah.  I heard her say she was kidding, in an annoyed dead pan way, the thing is...the damage has been done.  If she was trying to be funny, then her joke fell flat.  As for tall girl with impressive cat-eye make up skills, I give you props for having your girl's back, but you also made us feel you didn't have ours...your customer and loyal patron.  My review may just be a blip in all your 4-5 star rating, and ours may just be an isolated case...but, Emmy's, you broke my heart...on my birthday to boot.  I'm breaking up with you for a little bit to mend my broken heart.  I wish you the best for now...and I hope we meet again.", "author": "Gia C."}

Emmy's Spaghetti Shack, which recently moved into the the space, not so much.  I went there with three friends and upon entering we all noticed that they hadn't really done much of a make-over except put up shabby aprons & shelving.  The rest of it was much the way El Z's had it.  Its hard to think they put much of an effort into the move.\n\nOn their website they state \"Later on it gets louder filled with all kinds of people out to have quality food and a good time\"...So does that mean the food gets better after 8:00 pm?  If so, good, cause what we experienced at 7:00 pm was a really bland, under-seasoned, poorly prepared dinner of Caesar salad, garlic bread and spaghetti & meat balls.  The noodles were overcooked, the bread barely touched by garlic and the salad was a milky mess of blah.  The parsley on the entree had more flavor than anything served.  Other than that, the drink I ordered was good because it had a Bundaberg ginger beer base but my friends complained about the Sangria.  \n\nI was looking forward to this having never gone to the original location, but was really disappointed.  So many of these reviews overrate the place, which I don't understand.  It's overpriced and lacks quality.  Like much of the change happening in the Mission, this place is just another tasteless hipster hangout.", "author": "Don R."}

We had a reservation but our table was not ready when we arrived. No big deal- they had a place for us to sit and we waited just a few minutes until we were seated in a booth. After waiting a bit for our waitress she finally came over to take our order. We ordered wine, starters and entrees. In the meantime, the booth near us was seated by a very large party that also included a HUGE dog. The group was too large to fully fit in the booth so one of the guys was seated in a chair at the end of the booth, along with \"bear\" the massive dog. This dog was so big that it impeded the staff when they were servicing tables. An hour later we found ourselves without our wine or starters or even water. The large party with the dog was already eating. When we were finally able to flag down our waitress she said she would \"check\" on our order- she had not bothered to return to our table until we waved her over. She did stop to pet the dog and repeatedly touched her own hair which were both incredible turn offs as we waited for her to serve us our food. Our wine finally arrived and starters shortly thereafter- over 1 1/2 hours after being seated. The large party was done and gone by the time our entrees arrived. This experience was not what we had expected. We picked Emmy's because we wanted to be there. I was embarrassed to take my mother to a restaurant with such poor service and questionable hygiene rules that allow wait staff to touch their hair and animals while working. I like the casual fun atmosphere of Emmy's but this was neither. The small discount for our poor service did not make up for the experience and I doubt we would return.", "author": "michelle w."}

We went to the new location last night and they have a great system in place where they text you 5 minutes before your table is ready. We popped out for a drink next door and it worked perfectly. The new space is bigger but still cute...no problem with that. The food was very good. \n\nMy problem was with the music! What happened? They used to have a DJ playing weird and interesting funky music. Last night they were blasting top 10 hits of the 1950's. I felt like I was in a Johnny Rockets. Or at a bad wedding. I'm guessing you have to have some kind of weird permit to have a DJ and maybe they lost it? Regardless, they could still make their own mix of interesting music. \n\nI really couldn't go back if they were playing that music.

But, the staff kind of ignores the fact that you have a baby...or gives the impression of being annoyed that my baby dropped her toy or something!  Most kid-friendly places will at least smile at the baby...or say hi...or look at them..haha....with the number of kids that come there, I was surprised at how cold the staff was about it.   It definitely wasn't the end of the world....but since they do have a ton of kids coming in during the earlier hours, it would be nice to have a warmer feel about it.  \n\nThe vibe is great, service was otherwise ok.  As a vegetarian in SF, I was surprised with the limited options.  For the few veg options they do have, the dishes seemed overpriced.  I wish they had some more filling veg options!  We got the zoodles, which was described really well...but lacked flavor....and was crazily priced at $14 for a medium size plate of zucchini!  absurd! \n\nI would go back for a drink and maybe an app...but would probably not return for a meal...prob better bet for the meatball lovers! :)", "author": "Nisha K."}

This place is amazing. The atmosphere is lovely- from the decor, to the lighting, to the music to the photo booth. It's super cozy and just lovely. Our waitress was great- friendly and accommodating. We ordered everything but the spaghetti. We ordered the prawn risotto, the orechiette, the cheesy garlic bread, a seasonal pear salad, the meatballs, mozzarella cauliflower bites, the sangria and the peanut butter chocolate dessert. It's hard to pick a favorite because literally every plate we ordered was better than the next. I recommend ordering a bunch of plates and sharing with the table so you can try a variety of menu items- there's just too many delicious things to miss out on. The menus change periodically due to seasonal dishes, etc. Also, the menus are hand written and designed, which shows how serious this restaurant takes their business and service.

A lil raw, which is always a good thing. These balls melt in your mouth. I savored every bite and finished only half of it.

Now it's easier to get a reservation and there is over double the seating as compared with their previous location a few blocks away.\n\n\nThe decor of the restaurant keeps the funky and chill vibe of the Mission and Bernal area, where there are so many good restaurants and foodie spots just steps away and Emmy's fits right in. Both of us ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and we were happy to see the dish lived up to the namesake of the restaurant. It comes served with 3 large all beef meatballs that are made fresh every day. The sauce is on the thick side with lots of tomatoes which makes it easy to spread on the meatballs as you break them apart. They go well with the thicker al dente noodles they use for the spaghetti. Portions are big enough to share or make a hearty meal for one. It made me feel like a kid again, twisting the noodles around my fork, and slurping them up over the red and white plastic tablecloths. You can tell when restaurants put a lot of pride and care into their food, and that can explain why people leave raving about this place, because they know how to make a simple dish well. It's a fun place that will keep me coming back as long as they keep maintaining their high food standards with the chilled vibe of a neighborhood mainstay.", "author": "Mark Y."}

Went in on a Sunday night and had a few dishes, their spaghetti and meatballs was the standout by far. \n\nTHE SHMAGHETTI:\n\nThe portions are huge, noodles cooked perfectly and their red sauce is delicious. Not overly seasoned, but distinguished, fresh and with a nice mouth feel. The sauce coats the noodles well. Their meatballs were huge, juicy and wonderful. Had that great home cooked feel to the dish. \n\nAlso had the clam linguini and the cheese stuffed pablanos. Clam linguini was good, but the chorizo they use has a really strong flavor and the shellfish have a hard time standing up to it.  \n\nThe poblanos stuffed with bacon and cheese is a dish I would make at 3am if I was stoned and couldn't find anything in my fridge. Not bad, just weird and doesn't belong on a Italian spaghetti house menu.  Stuffed is an overstatement, sort of a \"wedge melted on top of\" poblano. \n\n\nTHE SHACK: \n\nKitschy, maybe a little too kitschy. The handwritten menus are hard to decipher, there might have been something I wanted to order, but I'm not playing Where's Waldo with my menu, I just want to see it and order it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-10-11", "description": "I have been going to Emmy's for about 4 years now, so obviously I love it and the idea of it; but I am going to have to finally be brave and provide a less than stellar review that's been building up over time.\n\n1. Since the move, Emmy's has definitely lost it's intimate feel.  The nights were often crowded and the wait was often long at the other location, but somehow, that was part of the romance.  Even having El Amigo bar to wait in while we waited to be seated did something for the experience.  Now the experience is drab and instead of having El Amigo as a place to get drinks, the Emmy's bartender didn't even acknowledge me for 20 minutes (not exaggerating!) as I sat at the bar waiting for a friend.  I tried to make eye contact several times, but then I just gave up and started timing her.  Note: only one other person was at the bar--and she came just to pick up her take out order so it wasn't busy AT ALL.\n\n2. Again, the restaurant is not as packed as it used to be, but still waitresses have more than once forgotten items that myself or my friends have ordered.  Additionally, they rarely check in now to see how we are doing and what we need (something, I must note, that started occurring prior to the move as well).\n\n3. The spaghetti:  when I was last there, it was dry and looked like it was scrapped off of someone else's plate.  It just didn't look freshly made which was embarrassing to me as someone who brought a new friend there.  Needless to say she didn't understand what I have been raving about and I started questioning what I've been raving about too.\n\nTo bring this long story to an end, I have been to Emmy's several, several times and  I just must really love spaghetti because between the unhappy looking waitresses, often getting seated in the back when other seats were available, forgotten items and other forms of neglect, I'm going to reassess my love for this place.  I think my friends, the uniqueness of a spaghetti joint, and a chunk of fattening food on a big plate makes the atmosphere, however, I'm not sure about the staff, service, and quality anymore.", "author": "C.

The garlic bread was also tasty but be prepared to smell like cloves of garlic the rest of the night.

She was the RUDEST server ever and I was never treated so badly in a restaurant before. She gave us attitude when I asked for separate checks - how hard is it to make a separate check? Just think of it like you're writing a whole new check for another table - are you that lazy and incompetent? While we were eating and nowhere finished, she asked if we wanted boxes. WE WERE STILL EATING. Then, she kept ignoring my friend who wanted more bread and was more interested in talking to the other waitstaff than actually doing her job, but FINALLY brought over bread and olive oil with balsamic vinegar. Due to a health concern, my friend couldn't have balsamic vinegar in her olive oil and Dana never came back with a new bowl of just olive oil so my friend got up and got it herself. Then after we were finally finishing up, Dana comes over without saying anything and literally snatches all our plates with such hostility and attitude while spilling the oil on the table and not bothering to clean it up. (The oil eventually made a trail because the tables were not leveled.) She also never came by to ask how our food was or how we were doing. We get your job is hard lady, but do ***NOT*** take it out on your fellow patrons. We even complained not even realizing Dana Marie was the manager (oh brother!) and not surprising, Dana never came around to apologize. I think that says a lot about her as a person. \n\nAs far as the food goes, it's fine but nothing to really rave about. Their meatballs may be bigger but bigger doesn't always mean better - amirite?! Just because of Dana Marie, she ruined this whole experience for me. Never again.\n\nI also agree with the menu - it's extremely hard to read because it's so amateur.

No doubt their Yelp ratings will live on for a while, based on the old location's awesomeness. But trust me, the old Emmy's is gone forever.", "author": "jack b."}

The polenta however, was soupy, the short ribs undercooked and fatty, and the souvingon blanc- undrinkable. it's very noisy, and worth it to make reservations and avoid the line.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-01-17", "description": "After my friend told me how good the spaghetti and meatballs were at this place, I decided I had to give it a try. So, I came here with said friend on a Sunday night. When we got there, we were told that there is a 15 minute wait and we were fine with that and the hostess told us that we could sit at the counter and order drinks while we waited. We waited for a bit, probably about 10 minutes and we were told that our table was ready. We got seated in a booth and given our menus.\n\nAfter looking at the menu, I settled on the spaghetti with meatballs since my friend was raving about them. He, himself, got the orecchiette with pancetta and got garlic bread for starters.\n\nThe garlic bread left a lot to be desired, it had some garlic spread but not nearly enough and was hardly salted at all. My friend got his orecchiette before I got my spaghetti (i.e. they didn't come at the same time) and I don't really find that to be a big deal but I know it's bad serving etiquette.\n\nMy spaghetti and meatballs were okay for a little bit but the more I ate it, the more I disliked it. I think the problem came from the fact that it was fresh tomato sauce and so it was VERY acidic with each bite. I ended up having to resort to eating a remaining slice of garlic bread to cut some of the acid. The meatballs themselves were okay, it felt like they used too much filler and so it didn't taste as meaty as I imagined it should have been. Quite honestly, I struggled to finish the plate and I ended up having to get help from my friend.\n\nMy friend complained about how salty his orecchiette was but I didn't try it so I can't say from personal experience but I trust his judgement. During our entire meal, we didn't get checked in on once. It wasn't like the place was super busy and it wasn't that we needed anything in particular, but it's one of those things that we felt like that we weren't welcomed; it's a bit difficult to describe that feeling because it's not like they did anything in particular (really a more lack thereof) to make us feel that way.\n\nOver all, I can't say I look forward to coming back. It's one of those places that I feel like that I would come back if someone wanted to come but it would not be a place I would suggest going to. The food wasn't pleasing, the service was pretty non-existent and kids were running around like they owned the place (I know, it's not the place's fault but it's not Chuck-E-Cheese either).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-11-28", "description": "I had never been to Emmy's even though I've lived in SF for 20 years, so was happy to finally have the opportunity to eat there this past Tues.\nI'll start my review by saying that I'm 100% Italian, and have been surrounded by some of the best pasta in the world for most of my life, so I'm a stickler when it comes to Italian food.\nI ordered the Brussels sprouts (my favorite veg) and was disappointed to discover that they ruined them up by adding some sicky-sweet glaze on them. They're advertised as *caramelized* which is the NATURAL process of the sugars coming out while cooking, and since BS's are just perfect naturally caramelized, to see that they in fact CANDIED them was a huge disappointment--it's SO HARD to make a Brussels sprout gross, but they managed to. \nSkip them if you like the natural flavor of a BS, order them if you like your veggies SWEET.\nOn to the pasta.\nOf the 100's of cuts of pasta, I avoid spaghetti because it's the most *common* and for the $$, there's NO WAY to justify spending $14 on a plate of food that costs $1 to make--this is my general rule at ALL Italian restaurants--I get something more specialized or unique, but because I was sharing, ended up with the spaghetti and meat balls.\nThe pasta was cooked PERFECTLY--Italian style-aldente, which is REALLY hard to do (a +/-2 min window before going bad) so 1 star for the texture. \nThe sauce was good, but not overwhelmingly so--glad that it wasn't sweet.  \nSadly, the Parmesan they use isn't terribly aged, so it's almost like putting shredded Mozzarella on your pasta, which for me is weird. \nThe meatballs were good, but nothing to write home about either. \n\nEveryone talks about the HUGE portions, but they basically pile all the pasta on top of 3 generous meatballs so it looks like you get way more than you do. There literally is only about $0.75 worth of pasta (maybe 5oz), but with the meatballs, it's pretty filling.\nI removed stars because of the limited menu (Hey, why not add a lasagna? It's cheap to make and goes a long way, too, which seems to be the vibe of this place) and because of the Brussels sprouts, and also because they TOOK AWAY the bread we were eating when the apps came--we had only eaten about 1/2, and 1/2 of us didn't even get apps, but as soon as the food came the plates and dip were whisked away--we didn't even notice until it was too late.\n\nWe had a GREAT waiter who looked JUST LIKE Justin Theroux, so that was a bounus, and I WILL return (really wanted to try the sausage alfredo dish), but it's NOT a place to go for value.\n\nSadly, I think that because the other space was so quirky and they were kind of a niche market, them moving to another place and having to compete with *regular sized* Italian places will be their undoing--it's WAY overpriced for what you get, and the food isn't SO tasty that it justifies the price.", "author": "D C."}

Again, the spaghetti and meatballs were delicious (meatballs were perfect), the focaccia bread was very fresh, and the green salad was very tasty and fresh. The dessert was yummy.\n\nThe not so good....\n\nWe were a party of four who arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday night -- the restaurant was virtually empty at the time with only one other table seated, so we assumed that the service would be speedy.\n\nThis place is NOT service with a smile. Unlike the wait staff, we are not hipsters, and we don't 'dress the part' so perhaps that worked against us, or might explain why our service was less than stellar. I'm assuming they don't know how to act around people who aren't wearing skin tight skinny jeans, tight flannel shirts and neon green aviator glasses with tattoo sleeves. Our waitress was not friendly and the service was sloooooooooow.\n\nThe entrees (all spaghetti & meatballs) took quite a while to arrive. Again, the other table that was seated already had their food so the cooks weren't cooking for any other tables We were seated toward the rear of the restaurant and noticed that throughout the meal the four waiters were huddled together, gossiping, and checking their phones. No one came over to check on us. We suspect that our food was ready pretty quickly but was sitting on the counter for quite some time while the wait staff chit chatted in the back.\n\nAfter we finished the entrees, someone finally came around and we opted to order a dessert -- quite frankly, i was worried because by the time we ordered dessert the restaurant was quite full, and I knew that it was going to take forever to get it. We ordered the donut with ice cream on top -- should take about 2 minutes to put together. We timed it and it took 24 min to receive the dessert. All the while, some or all the waiters were in the back talking, laughing, gossiping and/or checking phones.\n\nIn the end, when the waitress brought our check she just placed it down on the table -- didn't smile, didn't say thank you, didn't ask if we didn't even joy the meal.

Granted, this is not a stuffy fine dining establishment and I'm not suggesting that elevator John Tesh would have been preferred, but there were 4 of us at dinner that evening and we all basically just ate in silence because yelling at each other was too unpleasant.  \nIn a club, the music should be center stage, but in a restaurant, it needs to be in the background.\nAs a side note, we did ask our waitress if it was possible to lower the volume a bit. She kinda laughed and said \"oooh, but then you'd hear all the kitchen sounds\".\nI actually don't understand at all how the staff doesn't see the simple common sense behind this, as even they seem to have trouble hearing over the music.  The doll that sat us, could not hear us when we told her the other 2 in our party were parking the car and would  be in shortly.\nThe conversation between us and the waitress needed to be repeated several times just in the ordering process.  \nIf they have a hard time taking orders, wouldn't you think they'd take it upon themselves to turn the dang volume down?\nBased on the dining experience that evening, I should just rate Emmy's one star.

In a city where that is disappearing I for one relish this \" shack\".", "author": "helen w."}

Our party of five sat at the bar as we waited on our table. Not being much of a drinker, I asked the bartender for her take on certain drinks. She wasn't very friendly or responsive for the most part. Ended up ordering a drink, sat there and sipped on it as I watched her pour boxed sangria into glass bottles and refrigerate them. If you're taking boxed wine, dividing it up into glass bottles, and selling it for $20 a bottle, then you should at the very least do that in a more enclosed area so your customers don't see that. Found that to be tacky. Then, within seconds of being seated, a waitress approaches our table, without us calling her over, and says \"I'm not your guys' waitress but I'll go get your guys' waitress and see if she wants to wait on you guys.\" Being throw off by such an awkward and unnecessary statement, all we thought to say was \"ok, thanks.\" Also, we waited longer for our food than a number of folks who came in after us. In fact, we received our food right at closing time. They began turning off what little lights they had on as I was still eating. Here it was we waited quite some time for our plates, then feel rushed in having to finish them. We shared some of this feedback with our assigned waitress, who was apologetic, and I appreciate that... But even still, the food was good but not good enough to make me want to go back. There were a couple of friendly workers there but overall it was unwelcoming and awkward.", "author": "Julisa G."}

We made a phone reservation and were seated after a 10 minute wait. We also waited a while for the server but we didn't mind because some of us work in the restaurant industry so we have loads of tolerance. The server( no name) was curt and actually made us feel like we inconvenienced her. We ordered food and beer without much dialogue from her highness...our waitress. I would have liked to ask if they had any tagliatelle but there was no time for that. She was so rushed. Another server brought out the appetizers. She was equally as rude and rushed. We enjoyed the garlic cheese bread, the beet salad and the mini mac...all very good! Then we waited. We could have ordered more beers if anyone had even come near or even glanced at our table. But they didn't. The food was dropped off after a good half hour in between apps and dinner. The first server came by and was surprised that we weren't eating. I saw her go to the computer where she may just have placed our orders. Eventually the food came. The orrichette was delicious and my son loved the meatball sando. The steak was blah. The \"poppers\" were nothing more than undercooked flavorless peppers with bland cheese. What a waste that was!! I don't think my family will want to go back! I will go just for that beet salad and mini mac but hopefully Emmy will get some one who can smile to wait on tables. A lot of people want a job. You don't have to keep negative people working there!!", "author": "Sage K."}

Service is kind and courteous, and there's a great selection of food. i got the spaghetti and it was good. The sangria is also pretty great and they have a larger selection of cocktails which looked fun. I will say that I can't read the menu for the life of me but that would be my only complaint! I didn't get to try the photobooth but liked that it was there in the back along with some old school arcade games.", "author": "Maria J."}

I got there a bit early so sat at the bar and ordered a beer, and the bartender said barely 2 words to me. I am not looking for someone to be my best friend, but a \"hey, how's it going?\" From a bartender is not asking much. I sat there and drank my beer until my friends showed up, and when we tried to sit down, I was told I had to close my tab before they could seat us, guess transferring tabs is a little too advanced for these people. We order more drinks, an app, 3 mains, and desert. Food was ok, but we always came here because it had become a kind of tradition for us. After we finished our dessert our waitress came up to us and asked us to leave our table as they had \"a lot of people waiting\". I looked back and saw about 4 people waiting, hardly what I would call a long wait. I have never been asked to leave  a restaurant before because I was sitting at my table too long, and just Incase anyone is wondering, the 3 of us had been there for an hour and 20 mins, nothing crazy. After moving to this new location, this place seems to have lost all of its appeal. Rude service never lasts long in this city, so I would advise they get it together if they want to keep customers coming back.", "author": "Rebecca H."}
