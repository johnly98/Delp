To honor the fallen in battle, a world class art museum, and architectural marvel, and incredible views.\n\nYour general admission ticket also includes viewing at the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco. One not only gets to enjoy art, but music and other venues are presented there. If you are a member you get the special privileges that come with it. Discounts, special showings, travelling exhibits, and more.\n\nMy Favorite area is the impressionists, but still, every room has something special that caught my eye. Especially the Rodin Exhibits. And don't forget to see the porcelain rooms and other special areas. \n\nIf you wish dine at the caf\u00e9 or get special gifts for the family in their gift shop. Everything is available right down to the self guided electric tours and the nice docents there.\n\nIt's not just a place for the rich to schmooze, or struggling artists. I can be for everyone.

Downstairs they have a small exhibit on scientific innovation and literature from the \"Islamic world.\" It is there from August 25, 2018 - January 27, 2019. I was in love with it and spent quite a bit of time trying to read it and fail at it horribly as it's mostly in Persian and some Arabic and I haven't read either in at least a decade. What was funny to me was that the constant thanks to the ambassadors of art. I guess these are some major donor they wanted to thank so I'll mention them as well so no attention goes unnoticed. Lead Support was by The Francis Goldsmith Exhibition Fund and Major Support was from Barbro and Bernard Osher.\n\nWhen you go upstairs its a literal feeling of all roads lead to Rome as no matter where you go you will eventually come back to the center after exploring every corner of a dedicated area. For me the best part about the upstairs were the Rodin sculptures. You can lose track of time just admiring them. Apart from that, there is an overabundance of Christian art work. At times it felt like I was looking at the Medici family rejects. \n\nThere is a small room of impressionist work and it is absolutely beautiful. There is an area with coffins including actual mummies from Egypt. There is a machine that shows the X-ray of one of the mummy's on display. It was created in conjunction with or by the Stanford Medical School. \n\nThere are so many things about the museums in California that I loved but one of the ones that I loved the most is that they let you photograph and don't make you feel like you're being intrusive when you are looking at art work. In Houston, people start shouting at you if you get too close to the work even if you are behind the line. \n\nOverall, this museum was a total joy. I wish I would have gotten to see the parts that were closed due to the private event.", "author": "Zain R."}

I am madly in love with Monet's work, and so when I found out that I would be in San Francisco while Monet: The Early Years Exhibit was being displayed I dragged both my and my fianc\u00e9's butt up the hill to the Legion of Honor.  Of course, this museum was wonderful on its own accord, but I have been to several other art museums that I might prefer over this one (but I say that lightly because the other museums were also more expansive).  What I did particularly like about this museum was its collection of art from artists such as Rodin - I have not seen much of his work in any other museum I have visited.  The Legion of Honor also tickled my fancy because it houses mostly French art - and French art is something I can never get enough of.\n\nAs I mentioned, I loved this museum for the mere fact that it presented one of the most amazing exhibits I have ever seen - Monet: The Early Years.  In this exhibit, many of Monet's earliest works - some of the least publicly displayed pieces - were shown, some for only the second time in history.  That was crazy!  I saw some artwork that I never thought I would see because of how valuable they are - how did the Legion of Honor manage to obtain all of this artwork, especially those that had only been shown in public once before?  I don't know if I will have the answer to that question, but quite honestly it doesn't matter.  Clearly, the Legion of Honor has damn good curators that are able to put such wonderful exhibits together for their patrons.  \n\nThough I wish the museum was slightly bigger, I must also say that because it was smaller, it was manageable.  You could easily spend an hour or two here and have seen almost everything there is to see!  This means you could go on to the other museums in the area or take a steep walk down to the beach not too far away from the Legion of Honor.  This museum sits atop a hill overlooking a luxurious-looking golf course, and it provides a great view of the city.  So, as you can tell, there is a lot of sight-seeing to do here.\n\nAnd get this?  If you are visiting town and happen to buy the SF City Pass, you could gain access into the Legion  of Honor free of charge.  Mind you, that only buys you general admission and if you are to go see the special exhibits you will have to pay for those.  The special exhibits such as the Monet: The Early Years cost somewhere around $35; that could be viewed as a little steep, but if it's an exhibit you really want to see, I guarantee that it will be well worth the money.  The only thing that I didn't particularly like about this museum were the staff working here.  The staff who worked the front desk where tickets are bought were just plain rude - no doubt, it can be a monotonous job, but that's no reason for snotty-ness.\n\nP.S. transportation to and from here can be a little tricky...you're best off taking a bus and then hiking it up the hill.

If you have someone who has trouble walking, especially up hill,  drop them off and you go park the car.  It was a weekend day for us and it was quite a mob scene.\n\nEach gallery is a collection from certain periods and/or artist.  Sculptures and furniture are mixed in with the wall hangings.  Most pieces have descriptions that go beyond artist and dates.  I especially enjoy information giving background on the artists and the work itself.  The store has guides and you can purchase an audio headset that give you lots of information beyond what is on the small cards on the wall.\n\nThe downstairs floor has a few small exhibits, a gift shop and a great cafe which I will review in a separate posting.  Bathrooms are also on this lower floor, and there is an exit to the outside.\n\nGive yourself at least a half day.  It is open daily from 9:30 - 5:15 and it will take you that amount of time if you are thorough, read a lot of the information and have lunch there.  But a great way to spend a day.  The staff do a great job:  A-OK.", "author": "Mitch K."}

First. the special exhibit- Gods in Color was amazing.  I'll never look at plain white ancient marble statues the same way.  But then we went to the porcelain room- don't miss this!  It's on the same level as the cafe.  After that we went upstairs- and we were fascinated by the variety and the quality of the exhibits.  What a treat to see a Rembrandt!  The art spans most of Europe and also includes Egyptian works.  \nPrices- I have the ROAM cards- because I am a member at a museum that gets me in free to other museums.  So we saved the 15 dollar basic entrance fee.  There was an extra fee of 10 dollars for the Gods in Color- and for a small exhibit some people might not feel it was worth ten dollars.  Also extra, the Klimt exhibit- another 10 dollars.  My friends did this- we did not- and they thought it was very small, and not really worth the ten extra.  There's plenty here without the extra exhibits.  Unless you have a real interest in what's \"extra\" just see the regular collection- and spend that money you saved in the cafe.\n\nMake sure you try the cafe.  We found the food to be quite wonderful.  I had the pate salad and my husband had the truffled grilled cheese.  I really recommend a visit here.  Our bill was 51 dollars- which included a coffee and a soda water.  It was not cheap- but the food quality was good and the ambiance is nice and how great to eat great food at the museum!\n\nThere's a lovely walk down to Land's End and the Sutro Baths from the museum.

I've been to the museum but never really take a tour of the museum and this is the first time I walked into this museum. Anyway, we visited the museum for Klimt & Rodin's exhibition and then saw there are Gods in color and decided to check it out as well. I never knew the ticket price is going to be that pricy. But I think we spent around $140 just for the 2 exhibitions.\n\nFor Klimt and Rodin's exhibition it was interesting but then I do wish they have more arts to be displaced. They had good 4-5 rooms for the exhibition. But then the room was more filled with people than the art itself. As for gods of color. It was kind of boring. It literally just shows if the marble curving used to have color or not. If so, where the coloring are coming from and what was the materials.\n\nOverall, it was a good half day spent in the museum!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-04", "description": "Legion of Honor (visited on 3/18/2017)\n\nIconic, towering, elegant and magnificent in elevation, located in Lincoln Park overlooking the Golden Gate Bridge and surrounded by plush greenery stands the historic Legion of Honor, one of the largest Museums in San Francisco.  Designed by Architect George Applegarth's, the Legion of Honor is a Neoclassical architecture replica of Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in Paris.    \n\nSo, if you can't go to Paris, come here!  Versatile, the museum is great for viewing art of course!  But, weddings often take place here, a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge is in the background, and for photographers this is a great place to shoot pictures.  \nI came to the Legion of Honor specifically to view the Monet exhibit: The Early Years (Feb 27 2017-May 29, 2017). \n\nClaude Monet is one of my favorite painters!  So for me, this is a once in a lifetime experience to view 60 amazing art pieces by French Impressionist painter Claude Monet from his pre-Impressionist years 1858 to 1826.  It is interesting to see the evolvement of his work to the famous Water lilies painting that is housed in the post impressionist gallery.  \n\nRegarding this exhibit, you can definitely see glimpses of the emerging impressionistic style of quick, broad strokes of broken color, particularly in the atmosphere (i.e. water, sky, and clouds).  In this installment, through various paintings, one gets to peer into the inner world of Monet, from his struggle to break away the popular painting style of the time, to his comrade with fellow like-minded artists, his struggle financially, his big break, and finally his family life.  \n\nThrough, landscape scenes, portraitures, and still life, one can see the talent, experimentation with lighting and color and various focal points that contributed to Monet ultimately coming up with artistic style Impressionism \n\nAbout this museum:\n\nPROS/TIPS\n\nVISITING- To visit this museum come early or take public transportation!  There is a small parking lot in the front of the museum and a larger one lower, but because art enthusiasts coming to view this very special exhibit, I highly suggest coming early.  We arrived at 11am and were able to find parking in the lower lot.   \n\nTICKETS- Tickets for adults are pricey $35/per person (good if you go to The De Young Museum the same day because it will be free and vice versa).  I used to be a member of The De Young Museum but did not renew my membership because of financial hardship but I am thinking of becoming a member again.  With the two tickets we bought, the sales agent said it would go directly to my membership fee and I would have access again to private member showings and discounts at both museums.\n\nLegion of Honor and most museums in San Francisco are wheelchair friendly!  I love that SF is dedicated to supporting people with disabilities, or people like me who just happen to have an injury so walking through a museum is a lot less painless in a wheelchair.  The wheel chairs are available first come first serve, so come early!   \n\nPERMANENT GALLERIES/EXISTING GALLERIES\n**Auguste Rodin's\" The Thinker\" sculpture greets you, centered in the Court of Honor, when you walk into the plaza (amazing piece of art!)\n**Permanent galleries- Several galleries include: Ancient art, Medieval art, 16th century- 20th century Neoclassical Art through Post Impressionism, Porcelain gallery, Sculpture (Rodin),\nFlorence Gold Theater (re-created)\n**Current galleries\n--------Monet: The Early Years (Feb 25, 2017 - May 29, 2017) (**5 stars)\n--------The Future of the Past: Mummies and Medicine May 14, 2016 - Aug 26, 2018 \n          This was pretty interesting exhibit it.

There were lots of seating inside and the outside patio.  Very surprised how fast the line went and how fast the waitress brought to us our food.\n**Museum Store is located in the lower level (**5 stars) - Lots of items (books, posters, kitchenware clothing, prints, etc.)\n\nCONS\nOther con is that there is only one bathroom and that is on the ground level....I think a museum this large should have another bathroom on the second floor.

At the end of your museum visit, as you exit, take a look to your left at the view of the bay. This is natures art, no gallery needed. \n\nSunday date day was my 1st visit to the Legion of Honor. Not to be confused with the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in France. Although, it is a mirror image of the original, being granted permission by the French government to replicate in 1915. If you've ever been to any of the cultural buildings in France, Paris in particular, then you've seen the magnificence, impressive details and commanding presence these buildings offer. California's Legion of Honor will not disappoint!   \n\nAt present, the renowned Rodin sculpture 'The Thinker' (notice the French theme here) greets you as you walk through the archway. Inside are other various pieces from his collection, which were purchased by the museums founders way back in 1915 from the artist himself!\n\nMy sights were set on The Mummies & Medicine and the Monet exhibitions. \n\n~The Future of the Past: Mummies and Medicine~\nI was a little disappointed in the size of this exhibit. Especially considering the length of time it has been on display - I would expect a sizable viewing. There were 3 sarcophagi: one mummy dating around 2500 BCE, the other dating closer to 3,000 BCE and several amulets. What about the abundance of sculpture, jewelry, and pottery this region of Africa is known to have created? What about the manuscripts, papyrus and relief paintings that are recognized globally? I was also disappointed that this miniature exhibit was tucked away in an end room alllllllll the way down the hall. Nobody puts baby in a corner! But that's exactly where she was. I think this exhibit could have been curated better. \n\n~Monet: The Early Years~\nNow this is an exhibition! Most of us have seen the beautiful paintings of Monet's Water Lilies, or the gardens of his home in Giverny. But what about the artists work at the start of his career? Who was his benefactor? Who was his muse? This exhibit did a phenomenal job at \"introducing\" us to Monet, his friends and his wife. Which, once you read about his path, each of these elements play a key role in his artwork. Many of his pieces are phenomenal! The colors capture reflections that seem impossible with paint. Is this a photograph? No! It's really a painting. I was utterly blown away at his skill at capturing \"the light.\" There's a bookshop as you exit the exhibit where you can purchase books, art etc. or not. I did buy some art to display in my home - the one with the gentleman sitting on the park bench. While some photography is allowed, there are a few paintings where it is not permitted. They're labeled. Rest assured, staff is watching and will check you hard. So don't try it! You'll be embarrassed. \n\nWith so many rooms and halls and levels, the Legion of Honor reminds me of the Louvre, just on a smaller scale. You better come with plenty of time to spare, or at the very least have a check-list of specific art you intend to see for the day. We clearly were not prepared. Hungry and running out of time, we meandered through the French, English, Italian and Russian paintings. Sprinkled in between were full scaled rooms - literally somebody's 'chamber' on display; walls, floors, chandeliers and all! Breathtaking!\n\nAs we were roaming the halls about to make our exit, I began to hear what I imagined to be an organ. Wait! Am I late for mass?! Or is that the signal for it's time to go? Who knew there was a full scale organ in the museum! Indeed, starting at 4pm on the dot, each Saturday & Sunday you can experience a cathedral sound on the custom made Skinner Organ that is built right into the museum walls. What makes this organ unique from others is that the pipes are hidden. But, you still hear that majestic sound! \n\nThere's a lot. I know! Take it all in.

I find the Legion of Honor (AND the DeYoung) to have wonderful presentation of their paintings/exhibits. Things are well-lit in beautiful settings and exhibit halls. Plus, the parquet floors add to the grandeur of the Legion of Honor! I love that place!! The artwork is very carefully displayed. Not too cluttered and with very good description(s) and simply placed. No hodgepodge in this museum, as if each and every piece is just 'so very special' and lovingly placed and cared for. Kudos to those who do the presentation(s) in both buildings (Legion and the DeYoung). Make a visit soon! It will be something you'll well-remember! Have fun!", "author": "Linda S."}

Humor aside, this fine art museum lies at the northwestern tip of the City in Lincoln Park just south of the Golden Gate Bridge. Parking can be very difficult in the area, but transit is also limited, so getting here is a bit more difficult than finding the Legion of Doom.\n\nThe entry is just impressive. You walk through a large courtyard bounded by tall columns with a sweeping view of the City and Golden Gate. The layout of the interior is equally impressive with high ceilings and large display areas. Most of the artwork is classic with few modern or post modern exhibits. There is a nice Rodin sculpture area and a decent collection of Impressionists. The basement usually hosts traveling exhibitions with an additional admission fee.\n\nThe Legion of Honor is partnered with the de Young Museum, so memberships work at both facilities. It is a beautiful place with a beautiful collection in a beautiful - if remote - location. Assuming you can find a parking space, art lovers will love the trip.", "author": "Kristian D."}

Unfortunately, unless you are somewhat well versed in the historical elements of a certain room, you can only see pieces for their aesthetic value. Nonetheless, it is still fun to walk from room to room appreciating the various details of the different time periods. \n\nOccasionally, a docent or a well-versed visitor will give a short lecture on certain works. We were lucky enough to listen in on a explanation of the French salons. The docent covered everything from the architecture all the way to the nuances of how the furniture was oriented!\n\nThe current special exhibit on Breguet timepieces is also worth the $5 in my opinion. The pieces are incredibly well-preserved and quite a spectacle to view.\n\nMy only complaint would probably be the standoff-ish nature of some of the employees. The lady working the front desk literally deigned to welcome us to the museum...it was very cold and odd.

Instead, this is the museum of European arts as a part of the San Francisco fine arts museum system. As impressive as the Greco-Roman temple architecture, Legion of Honor's art collection is definitely worth checking out!\n\nThe museum architecture is a masterpiece of its own: a fine example of a Greek column temple placed on top of the hill with spectacular view of San Francisco - certainly worthy of the collection that the museum holds within! In its medium-sized collection, you will find both familiar classics like Rodin sculptures and exciting surprises like a old basilica dome ceiling. Even without an audio guide, you will find at least a handful of art pieces to awe you.\n\nBy the way, did you know the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco is in a collaboration with Paris's famous Musee du Louvre?

I had no idea that it was a museum!  The exterior is wonderful for pictures, and I have seen several engagement/wedding shoots here too. There's Rodin's Thinker in the front of the museum, along with a glass pyramid, similar to the one at the Louvre.\n\nOnce inside, the ticketing process is very easy and there's a quick bag check. For first-timers, it helps to know that the whole museum is shaped like a U. You're in the deep part of the U at the entrance.\n\nIt was only a couple days ago that I stepped foot inside here for the first time. I came for the Breguet exhibit, which was very magical and astounding. \n\nHaving arrived at the museum in the late afternoon, I didn't have a lot of time to pause and admire and contemplate the works of art in other galleries of the museum. I skimmed over the book collection and the porcelain and the silver wares. Instead, I spent most of my time on the Impressionist paintings and admiring the floors, the ceilings, and just the joyous moments of being inside a stunning museum. This museum is very open and for a January weekend (also the second to last day of the Breguet collection), it wasn't too crowded.\n\nI'm going to try to make it a goal to come here at least once a season!\n\nThere's also a marvelous free (!) organ concert every Saturday and Sunday starting at 4 pm!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-13", "description": "\"High Style: The Brooklyn Museum Costume Collection\" from March 14 - July 19 is the reason I paid a return visit to the Legion of Honor-just for this exhibit alone. And it was the first Tuesday of the month!  Free general admission yet paying a special exhibition fee ($11.00).\n\nThe principal reason I wanted to view the exhibition was the work of the Anglo-American couturier Charles James (1906-1978).  Charles James's work was the 2014 theme of the Metropolitan Museum's fund raising gala for its Costume Institute. From the Metropolitan Museum's website on James: \"James's design process, specifically his use of sculptural, scientific, and mathematical approaches to construct revolutionary ball gowns and innovative tailoring that continue to influence designers today.\" There is a lot of material utilized behind the fabric and seams in the construction of a Charles James gown such as boning, tulle, and horsehair under all the draping, folding, and pleating. \n\nMany of his creations were worn by many of New York's elite socialites (i.e. Millicent Rogers, Babe Paley and Diana Vreeland) at galas and in their portraits of the 1940s and 1950s. Marlene Dietrich wore his designs. \n\nChristian Dior credits James as his inspiration for his revolutionary New Look. And amongst today's designers who cites Charles James as an influence in his work is Zac Posen. James and Posen's gowns are wearable works of art.\n\nEven better--I was quite delighted to learn I could take no-flash photos of the collection. Good thing I had my charger key with me to power my iPhone as there were so many designs to snap photos of the exhibition.\n\nBefore going in, I inquired about the free docent tour as in \"could I return to view the exhibition if I partake in aforementioned tour?\" I was advised I could if I go sign up at check-in. I was just there checking in my backpack, so I went back and got my name on the list---lucky slot number three. I was delighted to learn the docent tour includes utilizing a free handset, no need to pay the eight dollars for the self-guided audio tour. And I was quite delighted I could use my own headphones instead of the ones provided with the device for the docent tour.\n\nCharles James was the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance of \"High Style: The Brooklyn Museum Costume Collection.\" The exhibition also featured creations by Jacques Doucet, House of Dr\u00e9coll, Steven Arpad, Callot Soeurs, Elsa Schiaparelli, Bonnie Cashin, Arnold Scaasi, Christian Dior, Yves St. Laurent, Madame Gres, Gilbert Adrian (\"Gowns by Adrian\"), Halston, and my personal favorite, Chanel. I was surprised and shocked there was only one Coco Chanel creation in the exhibition. Charles James's archetectual, artistic, and sculptural creations conclude the exhibition.\n\nMy film her-storian side was delightfully happy. The gown Ava Gardner wore in 1954's The Barefoot Contessa designed by the Fontana Sisters (Sorelle and Michol) is amongst the exhibition. It is a creation of pink duchesse silk satin, black velvet appliqu\u00e9s, and black silk velvet panelling. There is a 1960 pale blue silk taffeta dress Hubert de Givenchy worn by model-actress Lauren Bacall. \n\nI mentioned Adrian who was credited as \"Gowns by Adrian\" for over 250-350 MGM films, where he was the chief costume designer. \"The Tigress\" ensemble by Adrian is featured. Made of beige, black, and orange silk chin\u00e9 and gold lam\u00e9, Adrian made this for his wife, the actress Janet Gaynor after and inspired by a holiday they took to Africa.\n\nCharles James has two rooms devoted to his work of design sketches and his clothes. In the first room, in the center is the Clover Leaf ball gown, 1953. Made of pink silk faille, copper silk shuntang, and black silk lace with ivory silk faille backing. It is in a glass case and the visitor can walk to see all  360 degrees of the ball gown. It is surrounded by other James's works such as La Sir\u00e8ne (1939), Ensemble (1947), Ribbon (1947), Dinner Dress (1950), Bustle (1947) and muslins of some of the aforementioned designs.\n\nThe second room is devoted to James's other masterpieces, muslins and computer animation videos. These videos show the construction and underpinnings of James's B&W Clover Leaf (1953), Diamond (1957), Ball Gown (1951) and Tree (1955) along with the aforementioned gowns and muslins.\n\nI plan to return before the exhibition's last day of July 19. I am bringing reinforcements--more cameras. It sure beats getting postcards. I did view the postcards available for purchase, unfortunately the selection was quite limited in what designs were featured. Translation: there were no standouts I wanted to purchase.", "author": "Chiara A."}

(If curious about city history, you can find her graceful and extremely statuesque likeness soaring in the skies in the middle of Union Square.)\n\nThe museum has a fairly small hodgepodge collection inside, but a pretty awe inspiring setting, classic columns and even a tiny crystal clear glass pyramid (inspired, no doubt, by the Louvre pyramid) set in the museum's front courtyard.\n\nTypically more of a modern art fan, I still appreciate the neoclassical setting and the small but powerful collection of Rodin sculptures, English and Victorian works, a room full of Dutch masters (Rembrandt is always moody and evocative) and a bevy of impressionist paintings.  Its a small but poetic collection, a remarkable setting, and the exhibitions here are often creative and memorable.  Plan a visit here, if you can.

The Klimt and Rodin exhibit was a sore disappointment:  Very small, and in places very badly lit.  A friend and I got there just before 1pm on Saturday 1/13.  We had to wait until 3:45 to get in.  The male gatekeeper was very polite.  The female gatekeeper not so much so.  'Twas a very poor exhibit of a painter whose work I've loved, and longed to see, for decades.  And my guest and I both travelled two hours each way on public transit just to see it.\n\nThe gallery with the \"resident\" Monet waterlily painting was apparently closed.  So my friend and I didn't get to see that painting.  Kind of a big deal, as she was visiting from out of town, and I'd raved about it to her.\n\nFriend and I stopped in at the caf\u00e9 after seeing the exhibit, for coffees.  We had to wait to have the coffees brought to our table, which was fine.  While we were waiting, and finally sipping, an older Asian male caf\u00e9 employee came to our table--TWICE within five minutes!--and told us the caf\u00e9 was closing in 10 minutes.  Talk about a bum's rush.  Boo!\n\nThe exhibits at the SFFAMs have been declining in quality in recent years.

Remembering the sign outside mentioning the provocative nature of her art I was determined to simply avoid all the rest of her pieces. But then the museum thought it was a good idea to drape a couple of Sarah Lucas' breast over The Three Shades. You'd think that they would have given her own exhibit room for the amount of pieces she had or better yet skip the Degos exhibit and showcase Sarah. The piggybacking off Rodin was a bit pathetic and the vague similarities attempted to be drawn of the two was further pathetic. I could draw no comparisons only the stark contrast of good and bad. \n\nOf course those admiring the work are the same propagators who are nothing more than a by product of San Francisco/Berkeley feminist liberalism.

Monet, Renoir, Degas, van Gough to name a few along with numerous other offerings.

Not that there isn't enough parking but there are so much cars here!!!! It's not just the parking for legion of honor but parking for the nearby trails, legion of honor, overlook, and golf course. \nNo after you find parking you will come up to the Legion of Honor and be confused when you first lay eyes on it. How can something so beautiful, so greek be just resting in San Francisco?!\nIt feels like a roman/greek building just for you to adventure and explore. \nFirst up the front of Legion of Honor does not have a gate around it which means you can come after 5PM and take some pictures here if you arrive too late. Majestic roman type pillars grace both sides of the building. Now if you come here before 5PM, you are greeted with the courtyard which has the pillar walkways on both sides. There are neat statues scattered around and there is also this one awesome half glass pyramid area where you are allowed to sit besides. Perfect for taking some cool pictures.\nThen of course you have the museum which is kind of expensive and it is mostly painting exhibition interior, nothing like the exterior museum at all. So don't go in there expecting King Leonidas' house because you will say THIS IS NOT SPARTAAAAAAA\n\nIf you are facing the museum entrance, to your right is the land's end trail and an overlook to the Golden Gate bridge. To the left will be the golf course which you need to be weary of golf balls flying.", "author": "Jason H."}

There were also 40 well-preserved examples of period hats, some adorned with feathers, lace, and flowers on display throughout the exhibit.\nNeedless to say, we really enjoyed the full experience!\nSince it was not a Saturday or Sunday, there were not as many visitors roaming about. We were able to find parking near the Museum quite easily.

It's a bit of a challenge visiting two museums in one day, but it can be done and it can save you money.\n\nThe location of this museum couldn't be better.  Yes, it's far from downtown, but it's worth the trek.  It's in Lincoln Park and you can get a good view of the Golden Gate from here.  Get here early though if you want to be able to find parking!  That great view attracts many camera-toting tourists, so parking may be a challenge on peak times and weekends!\n\nThis museum is not very big.  It's smaller than the de Young and SF MOMA.  Three hours in this museum would be plenty of time to see most of the more interesting stuff.  The Rodin sculptures are always fun to see.  \n\nWe came here on Veteran's Day as I was off from work and wanted to see the Houghton Hall exhibit.  I admit that I was a Downton Abbey devotee for a while, and love the grandeur of English country homes, so it was a nice treat to see this exhibit.  It's not a very big exihibit, so you can go through it in about an hour.  An audio tour will cost you an additional $6, but it makes for a better experience.

The empty lot allowed for some great snapshots.  \n\nI recently came back about two weeks ago and was really excited to see the Impressionists' exhibit.  The gorgeous day and hubbub of the museum-goers was truly refreshing to see.  The only awful part was finding parking.  If you drive all the way down the hill, you have to deal with an awful line of cars trying to turn around at the dead end if they were unfortunate enough to not get a spot.  \n\nOverall, the museum is gorgeous and the artwork is thoughtfully curated.  If you're on foot and have time to spare, the Legion of Honor is coincidentally along the Land's End trail, too!  So if you're hiking and checking out the museum on a gorgeous day, you are most assuredly in for a San Francisco treat along the hidden gem of Land's End.", "author": "Viva C."}

It's located near Lands End so either before or after you visit the museum, you'll enjoy beautiful views on a clear day.  The museum itself, it's a European art museum that has paintings, sculptures, photography and special exhibits.  The best thing about it for me is its collection of Dutch and Belgian paintings.  It's not that large so it isn't overwhelming.  Admission is $10 which isn't bad.", "author": "Anthony G."}

Those art pieces truly capture the the beauty of nature.  There are a lot of classical European artworks and other ancient arts.  The outside of the museum has columns that looks like resembles old Rome.  Also, there is a guy playing a guitar on the outside.  Everything about this museum just takes you back through time.

Although the de Young in Golden Gate Park also has a lovely setting, the location of the Legion of Honor is particularly striking, and one should definitely allow time to walk the surrounding parkland and enjoy the stunning water views if at all possible. The building itself is a reduction of the neoclassical original in Paris, interest in which was spurred by an international exhibition in San Francisco planned just before WWI.\nThe art collection within consists of a small number of objects of so-called ancient art from the near east and Mediterranean civilizations, and a much broader overview of painting in Europe from the Renaissance through the 1900s, with a smattering of decorative arts usefully included as well. The range and quality of works displayed provide a good survey of the development of the western tradition in art, particularly given the limited holdings of this material on the west coast of the U.S. compared with the northeastern U.S.\nThe museum also regularly hosts both domestic and international traveling special exhibitions. There is a pleasant cafe which includes outdoor seating and a museum store. The building is accessible and it is reachable via public bus from downtown San Francisco, particularly if you alert the driver to your destination when you board. If you've come out to the Legion in the morning, it is also quite possible to continue your journey to the de Young via public transit and enjoy a full day of the fine arts in SF in two beautiful venues!", "author": "Edward M."}

First of all, the property is situated in a prime location (as it should be!) with AH-MAY-ZING views of the Golden Gate bridge on the left and the city on the right. There are also a couple of large, beautiful sculptures gracing the front lawns. The architecture of the building itself is quite photogenic on it's own, add the stunning views, a wonderful collection of fine art, a gourmet cafe, reasonable admission prices ($40 total for 3 of us to get in and that included the additional fee into the Bonnard exhibit) and the whole experience is a win-win.  \n\nWe thought the collection inside was lovely.  Rodin, Monet, Fra Angelico to Picasso - all kinds of European art and furniture too. We went during the exhibition of the \"Portrait of a Lady with a Unicorn\", (ca. 1505-1506), which is on loan to the US for the first time.  The painting was supposedly inspired by the Mona Lisa.  Very cool.  \n\nI didn't know this until our last visit, but the museum was built to commemorate Californian soldiers who died in World War I.

I love how there isn't an overwhelming amount of art (paintings, sculpture, deco art). It allows you to focus on a few that you really enjoy. \n\nAt first, I never heard of this place. It's tucked away past Clement St. in the Sunset and the drive there is accompanied by a golf course on your right. You stop at this structure supported by columns and not far from your periphery is the ocean. I think the placement of this museum was perfect. Although it doesn't get much sunshine, on the days that there are, I think that the light rays play off the building impeccably. I went on a cloudy Tuesday (first of the month) and it was free admission for the general public & $10-11 for the special exhibit, which at this time was a collection of costumes from the Brooklyn Museum. FYI, de Young & the Legion are both free on the first Tuesdays of the month. \n\nI love paintings so I was happy when I came across Monet's \"Water Lilies\" and a few small pieces by Van Gogh. I was also introduced to the main attraction, \"the Russian Bride\" and if you haven't seen it, it's definitely a feast for the eyes. It commands your attention when you walk into the room. The artist captures the emotions of the bride and the many others in the room with her. The docent told us it was an arranged marriage and a young bride, she was betrothed to a much older man. \n\nAs for the experience, I was very glad there weren't many people at the time we went because it was sometimes my friend and I alone with the painting. I have to say I was bit annoyed by these two ladies who couldn't help but take photos in front of almost every major piece, which forced us to step away from truly admiring the painting's grand presence. We eventually came back, so it turned out to be okay. My friend and I also decided to take a tour at noon and the docent emphasized the different decorative art one would see in a place of wealth and excess. I loved this artwork pieced together by different types of stone-- alabaster, marble, etc. It depicted a vase of flowers. Just the workmanship alone was incredible. It must have taken the artists a very long time to piece together a medium-sized picture such as this. I also loved the room reconstructed from wooden panels taken from a Parisian hotel (considered an apartment). I definitely need to come back to look at this room again. It took my breath away and I can't imagine how long this project took to complete. \n\nOverall, I had such a delightful experience even though it was a free day and I expected there to be lots of people, but if you come in early enough, you can skip the crowds. I would highly recommend anyone who has a taste for fine European art to visit this museum!!!", "author": "Brittany D."}

Those three items I usually write reviews on Yelp. However, as stated on my profile, I also love art. (I can't be a meathead all the time.) My interest in art stated in college when I took an art history course just to meet women. There were some good looking women in my art history class. However when it came to decide a major the only one that interests me was art history. (Little did I realize that major at UC Berkeley is one of the most intense majors as the art history major is considered one of the top majors in the country along with NYU and Columbia).\n\nOf all the art forms Impressionism is my favorite due to the visible brushstrokes, interplay of light, and informal subject matter.  About three years ago I went to the de Young Museum for the 2-part Musee d'Orsay Exhibition that exhibited the largest collections of Impressionism paintings in the world. When the opportunity of another Impressionism exhibition would be in San Francisco I couldn't pass it up.\n\nI came here yesterday to see the Intimate Impressionism Exhibition. The collection in this exhibition is about one-fourth less than the overwhelming Musee d'Orsay collections that were displayed at the de Young. As a compliment to this exhibition I purchased an audio tour that provided me insights of specific paintings in the exhibition. From painting to painting your get a glimpse of history how Impressionism progressed. Since the collections on this exhibition weren't abundant as the Musee d'Orsay Exhibitions it took me about an hour and a half to analyze through all the paintings. This exhibition showed a small sample of works by Degas, Renoir, Manet, Monet, Pissarro, van Gogh, and other artists. You can see how each artist interprets its own interplay of light on the subject matter. Two paintings that stood out for me at this exhibition were Vincent van Gogh's \"Flower Beds in Holland\" and Antoine Vollon's \"Mound of Butter\". For the painting by van Gogh you can how the bright colors of the flower beds contrasted with murky background. On the painting by Vollon he uses the Impressionism technique of visible brushstrokes to capture the realism of butter; the painting looks like an actual butter. For those who inspiring to be painters instead of trying to be the next Picasso as a starting point observe this painting by Vollon to understand the basics of painting.\n\nEven though I enjoyed this exhibition I couldn't give it a perfect 5-star rating as the 2-part Musee d'Orsay Exhibitions at the de Young were the best exhibition I ever seen due to the abundance of work displayed. However if you don't know anything about art and want a quick introduction of Impressionism I recommend checking the Intimate Impressionism Exhibition at the Legion of Honor.", "author": "Gerald R."}

There were definitely a handful of noteworthy pieces, though small in size. \n\nThe tours are self guided with each open room usually dwells on one specific painter, you can start by reading his biography or a background plaque and then starts to view the paintings in order, along the wall.

There's also an entrance to the amazing Lands End Trail right next to the museum, which I totally recommend checking out after you visit the Legion of Honor!\n\nThere's a very small parking lot right out in front of the museum. The day I went, I got there pretty early (close to the time the museum opened), so I was able to snag a spot. I believe it's free parking for 4 hours. I think the architecture on the outside is so beautiful. The giant fountain, the lions, the tall pillars look so regal and are very reminiscent of old Greek architecture. It's no surprise to see why people are having little photoshoots outside!\n\nThe architecture on the inside is also quite nice. It kind of reminds me a lot of the National Gallery in London, but on a MUCH smaller scale. I recall one room here with a really ornate ceiling that was beautiful! I enjoyed the collections of art in this museum. It's all very fine art, which I don't really know much about, but I enjoyed looking at them. Again, the museum is quite small and you can probably get through it in an hour.\n\nWith a ticket from the Legion of Honor, you can also get into the deYoung that same day! I actually prefer the Legion of Honor, though, despite how much smaller it is. I felt like I had a much more simple, quiet experience here that is better for enjoying art compared to the deYoung.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-02", "description": "This review is for Legion of Honor as a wedding reception venue. We held our black tie reception here last year and it was truly a magical event space. We rented out the full museum to accommodate ~550 guests, which worked well for that crowd size. A couple of key things to keep in mind when planning an event here:\n\n- The doors to the museum close at 5pm. If your event starts at 6pm or 7pm, this leaves very limited time for vendor setup. I would recommend not starting your event until 7:30pm and giving vendors a setup goal of 7pm. We made the mistake of planning these times too close together and several early arrival guests ended up waiting outside in the cold :(\n\n- The museum requires little additional floral decor, given the existing beauty of the architecture, which is a plus. Your biggest decor expense will likely be lighting, particularly if you want to light the outside columns leading into the museum. \n\n- Clarify with your caterer when food will be served. I forgot to ask, assuming it would be when the doors opened at 7pm, and the food was not served until 8:30pm given the limited set up time window. We had people drinking for about 1.5 hours without food, which is not a good combination. Tell your guests to eat something in advance or make sure to have some appetizers that are easier to serve earlier in the evening.\n\n- There is quite a bit of price variation in the vendors on the museum's preferred vendor list. I recommend requesting multiple quotes to find the ones that are right for your budget before deciding. \n\n- Expect to pay several hundred dollars in event insurance specific to a museum.\n\n- Consider hiring the museum organist for party music. We did this for a portion of the evening and it was a really special addition to the night. He is very flexible and has a wide range of repertoire styles.\n\n- Consider hiring a valet service for a large event. We had 100 guest arrive in their own cars, and in black tie attire it's a bit far to walk from the parking lot to the entrance, especially in winter! We worked with CA Parking and they did a great job.", "author": "Aleta C."}

If you dont have a card, you can pay $10 for general admission for a somewhat small exhibit. I thought since it was free, I might as well experience this even though I am not an artsy smartsy person. The only painters I recognized were Picasso and Monet. That was the highlight of my trip because I remember in Titanic, Jack mentioned the Lily painting and how the vibrant colors blended together. It was the last painting I viewed and it definitely lived up to the hype. The painting is absolutely beautiful and I tried to understand the deepness of the painting by reading the description. Haha I just liked reliving the Titanic scene in my head. Only one floor is accessible for general admission and it took an hour or so for a quick browse. It is free so I couldnt really complain but I liked deYoung better because there was more of a variety of art like sculptures and paintings and historical references. I noticed a religious theme in the different showroom.\n\nThere is actually a small free parking lot right in front of the museum but if that runs out, there is a smaller free parking lot at the entrance from the street which is about .4 miles away. I parked on the street on Saturday around 11am because I thought closer parking cost money but as I walked closer, I noticed the different parking lots. Try to get as close to the museum as possible.\n\n\n**TIPS**\n1) I am not sure how long free admission will last but this weekend may be your last chance with your BOFA card. When I went to deYoung, my friend was able to download the BOFA app and got free admission, so maybe they will let you here. If not, bring a check as proof.\n2) Parking lots along the way are free but limited.\n3) Enjoy!", "author": "Amy H."}

It's not the largest museum, less than a half day affair, with numerous rooms of art, with multiple rooms bunched into same themes. LOTS of religiously themes works of art, which, I don't know about you, but I'm just tired of. It's essentially like my views on Egyptian exhibits whenever I'm at a museum... skip. Not saying the art is profound or well made, but when you're looking at the millionth rendition of Mary and Jesus, you start wondering if you're at an amateur hour during The Renaissance where everyone's jumping on the latest craze.\n\nThe artwork here is extremely classic, even with a porcelain collection on the lower floor. Very Eurocentric, which some 'Asian' works bought by Europeans... or when looking at the porcelain works on the first floor, they explain some background how Europeans wanted to copy these works to increase their collections more easily. Cuz... money.\n\nThe special exhibit during our visit was titled 'High Style: The Brooklyn Museum Costume Collection'. Not really for me, maybe because I'm not in the scene. A lot of interesting fashion, some really eccentric, but some very elegant.\n\nIn a way, I feel like I'm committing heresy with my 3 star review. The place is nice and elegant, but I didn't find things extraordinary or something to drool over.

We were there to see a chamber music performance by the SF Symphony in the Florence Gould Theater. As soon as I walked into the 200-person theater: INSTANTLY BACK TO FRANCE AGAIN. I couldn't stop staring at the colorful lush frescoes on the ceiling when I was supposed to be staring at the world-famous violinist playing his multi-thousand-dollar instrument from the 17th century. \n\nThe Legion of Honor gave us a great experience, and, much to their delight, we will likely be repeat customers--we want to go back and see the museum itself now. The Legion is a delightfully beautiful way to take an escape from the States and enter Europe for an afternoon.\n\nSo why only 4 stars? THE PARKING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN WORSE. I understand that this is not their fault, but it caused us great frustration and wasted half an hour. We looped around the front roundabout and the side aisle 3-4 times each before throwing our hands up in sheer frustration and driving down past Fulton to park near Balboa. It was only about a 10-minute walk to the Legion from our parking spot, but we wished that there was adequate parking at the Legion to accommodate both museum patrons and chamber music performance-goers. \n\nOther than that, our day was absolutely lovely, thanks to the Legion and its collaboration with SF Symphony, with due gratitude to Mozart and Franck as well. :)", "author": "Rebecca M."}

Then looking around we found that we had stumbled across a museum. \n\nSince we had ditched Lands End (which was amazing by the way) to get food, it worked out perfect that we paid admission to the museum and they had a cafe located downstairs that we ate at prior to browsing the rest of the museum. I'm so glad that they did have a cafe because we spent 4-5 hours browsing the museum and even then, we could have spent more time there. \n\nThe museum itself is huge with sculptures outside and on the inside it is a maze of amazing pieces of art from different periods on multiple levels.

Of all the years that I've lived in the Bay Area, this was finally the first time that I made it into the Legion of Honor. The architecture of the building, the surroundings, the exhibits, all contribute to what it has to offer.\n\nI happened to go on the first Saturday of the month. At least for this year (or maybe it was just this month), it was a free admission day, if you are a Bank of America debit/credit card holder. *yay for freebies* Despite being a free day, it was not crowded at all. I could walk through each gallery at a leisurely pace and without having to rub elbows with the other visitors.\n\nI would have to say that I'm not entirely a huge fan of fine art; however, there are certain classical eras that I do enjoy.  The Legion of Honor has a great variety of work, so there's bound to be something for everyone to enjoy.\n\nIf you plan to stop and have a bite to eat or drink, the cafe is well situated, so on a beautiful day, it will be nice to sit out in their patio to soak in the weather, remain at peace, before walking back into the building.\n\nGreat place to go on a leisurely afternoon! And if you have time, I would even recommending starting the day/afternoon at Lands End, then walking to the Legion of Honor and back. It's a short, beautiful walk!", "author": "Audrey C."}

It's not even a review of the cafe.\n\nIt's a review of the Legion of Honor Cafe's BLT sandwich as experienced on a single day.\n\nAfter hiking the nearby trails (accessed from the southish end of the parking lot on the water side), I wandered in with my son. Thought I'd bribe him with a snack so I could dash through the Brooklyn Museum Costume Collection (member here: I'll see any exhibit, any time). After viewing the menu and the outrageous prices, we decided to split the BLT. Added on avocado. The bill? $18.75. Not even kidding. This is a *museum cafe* people! Unbelievable.\n\nThen the sandwich arrived--unassuming, underwhelming, sizable but not huge, standard 'mixed greens' salad on the plate. We each took a bite and stopped talking. Three or four or five slices of crisp, melt-in-your-mouth bacon. Fatty salty perfection. Tomatoes roasted until they were rich and flavorful, the juice releasing and soaking the greens when I bit down. Lightly dressed leaves--is that a hint of lemon?--and creamy, succulent avocado. Lightly toasted bread holding it all together. Every bite sublime. Absolutely obscene. One of the best sandwiches I ever ate. Ever.\n\nWe ate silently, slowly. My son nodded with each bite. \n\nThe exhibition was pretty good, too.", "author": "M. C."}

The Legion of Honor is a musuem filled with art from all over the world.  I got to see two Rembrandts, one upstairs and one down.  You can take photos upstairs but not down so I was able to get some good shots.  There are sculptures and porcelain, clay pots, etc.  We spent about 1.5 hours until it closed.  I would have loved to spend more time but that's what happens when you get there late like we did.\n\nTry and go before the Mosaic leaves (I think in August) and goes back to Israel where it was recently discovered and unearthed during a road widening project.  It's awesome to have it before you and there is a short video showing how they removed it from the ground and preserved it.  \n\nDon't forget to check out the overlook of the golf course and stop by the Holocaust Memorial.  The Memorial is located outside next to the lookout.  It's amazing that there were so many death camps.  You hear of Auchwitz but there were many, many more and they're inscripted on the memorial.  It's a sad but gentle reminder of what horror the Jews endured during a tragic time in history.  \n\nWe always drive down the park to see the spectacular view of the GG Bridge while we're at Lincoln Park.

It's just simply breathtaking inside and out.\n\nFirst of all, regarding parking:  There is limited parking in the museum parking lot, and if that's full (most likely it might be) you can park at a lot down the road from the museum OR on the street to the right of the museum.\n\nWalking up to the museum, I was just in awe looking up at the building, it's like something out of a history book.  Everything from the courtyard, to the grounds, to the magnificent columns lining the perimeter of the courtyard just takes your breath away.  \n\nYou're \"greeted\" at the entrance to the museum courtyard by a sculpture called \"The Thinker\" who is in a hunched position looking like he's....what else, thinking of course.  There is a pyramid structure near the entrance to the museum (that honestly looks Lourve-esque), which looks like it may have a light feature to be used in the evening.  \n\n$:  Admission to the museum for adults is $10 general and $15 for general + admission to the special exhibits.  \n\nTIP:  Make sure to pick up a map/guide to the museum when you pay admission, as each section is numbered and the guide will tell you what art/pieces are from each specific time period.\n\nThe upper level contains the majority of the exhibits:  Paintings, sculptures, chairs, glasses, couches, etc.  The galleries are wide and spacious with high ceilings and definitely give the patrons an almost regal emotion or feel as they view all of these exquisite and inspiring pieces of art.  I have to say that the gallery that gave me that feeling of \"awe\" was the gallery 1 which contains paintings by Monet, Cezanne, and Picasso.  I have to say I couldn't believe my eyes that I was in the presence of artwork by these famous and historical artists.  The lower level contains the museum cafe and giftshop, more exhibits, and most importantly, the special exhibits, which as of this writing is Pulp Fashion.\n\nBottom Line:  A must see for the art-lover if visiting SF.  Wonderful. Amazing. Inspiring.", "author": "Michael C."}

One becomes a different person after each visit.  The permanent collection be old friends to visit often - the portraits stare back with emotion knowingly.  The traveling exhibits tell a story through the work of different artists.  There is a visual and a historical connection with the past that makes one walk away a different person.\n\n602 reviews.  Do your really need another one to get you over there?  Well, if it takes 603 reviews to convince you then please read my review and make it over there to see this amazing museum.   It is the best museum in San Francisco:\n\nLocation \n- out away from the city on a hill with nice views of the bay. \n- It is far enough away that you can find a parking place\n- Close to some nice restaurants that you can enjoy after the museum: Geary and Clement street - take your pick.\n\nThe exhibits\n- Sofie and I always enjoy the exhibits.  I didn't want to see a couple of the traveling exhibits because the art seemed boring (Georgia O'Keeffe) but after attending the exhibit and learning about O'Keeffe's art I bought a print because the people at Legion of Honor did such an outstanding job of displaying the works and explaining what was behind them... the painting of a few leaves meant a lot to me because I understood what she was saying through the drawing!\n- Audio tour - we always get the audio tours - very informative.  (Sometimes I bring my own headphones and just plug into their device... creeps me out wondering who last wore those headphones and wondering if they ever wash their ears.)\n- I like the quirky little exhibit downstairs showing different printed matter. Current exhibit is Artists & Editions: A Publication in Memory of Steven Leiber (1957-2012).  My favorite was a yellow sign \"Back in 1 Minute\".  Have you considered that a little yellow sticky could end up in an art museum?  Nice.\n\nTips:\n- Bring a snack if you think you will be hungry... or a suitcase of money because the cafeteria is costly.\n- If you rent the audio tour for an exhibit - do not turn it in... haul it upstairs and listen the notes for the permanent exhibits... then return it when you are done.\n- Come early to get a nice parking spot and avoid the crowds.\n- Nice bathrooms are downstairs\n- Get a membership!  You will be able to see the de Young and Legion of Honor for free all the time and bring  friend.  If you see even one major exhibit the membership price will pay for the exhibit - and they send a great magazine if you are a member.  Sofie reads the magazine and I look at the pictures.  Then, when we go to to the museum she tells me stuff and I say, \"Wow!  That's pretty interesting!  Where'd you learn about that?!\"  Sofie says, \"I read it in your magazine.\"  I say in a still and quiet voice, \"Oh.\"", "author": "Steve S."}

It is absolutely stunning, a jaw-dropping marvel of Parisian architecture from George Applegarth who modeled it after the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in Paris. The French influence can be seen everywhere, from the glass pyramid in the courtyard (reminiscent of the Louvre) to the perfect circle of a fountain (reminiscent of Versailles). That the museum sits atop gorgeous Lincoln Park/Lands End (a surreal wonderland of nature that doesn't seem like it could possibly exist within urban San Francisco) only adds to its mystical beauty.\n\nThe European essence permeates the entire museum. Legion of Honor is truly a cosmopolitan art museum, offering almost every form of European art, from paintings to sculptures to furniture to whole re-created rooms. In keeping with my other Yelp reviews of cultural institutions, here are the pieces I most recommend seeing:\n\n1) The current special exhibit, \"Royal Treasures from the Louvre\": If you've never been inside the Louvre (or have and can't remember anything more than a feeling of tortured claustrophobia and the occasional glimpse of a painting peeking out from amidst the throng of tourists), this exhibit is for you. I especially loved the Mosaic Tabletop, the display of ewers (esp. #104) and the Personal Collection of Marie Antoinette.\n\n2) Porcelain Gallery: It has the feel of an antique shop rather than a museum wing with its plush rugs and sitting chairs, but there are some lovely objects to see here, especially the twin Tulipiere vases\n\n3) Rodin's \"Victor Hugo\": The most captivating (in my opinion) of the museum's rather large collection of Rodin's work \n \n4) Louis XV/Paneled Room: The kingwood is breathtaking, as are the artifacts\n\n5) Glass Goblets: Bright and glittering, especially the Roemer\n\n6) Religious panels from the Middle Ages such as Bicci di Lorenzo's \"St. John the Baptist and St. Miniato\": These take me back to grade 12, when I did a project on art of the Middle Ages\n\n7) Jean-Leon Gerome, \"The Bath\": The perfect representation of Europe's (rather misguided and romanticized) fascination with the Middle East during the 19th century\n\n8) John Martin, \"The Assuaging of the Waters: A mesmerizing use of color to re-create the Great Flood. Try to find Noah's Ark without reading the description plaque. I think part of why I like this painting so much is because the interplay of light and water reminds me of my favorite painting in the whole world, Claude Lorrain's \"Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba\"\n\n9) The Impressionism/Post-Impression Room: A well-rounded collection of works from heavyweights like Monet, C\u00e9zanne, Pissarro and my personal favorite, Degas\n\nHappy viewing!", "author": "Josephine L."}

Marble-lad floors invite you in to a circular foyer flanked with even more enticing galleries. Marble statues in one direction, royal furniture pieces in other.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-01-03", "description": "Besides having the best name in the world, Legion of Honor is a well curated, architecturally significant museum. If you are a strict fan of contemporary art, your aesthetics will be tested by countless rooms of 18th century art, decor and furniture, but if you invest the time in closely ogling these Old World paintings you will be astounded by the content, color and technique.\n\nThe building itself is a throwback to more regal times, sitting atop Lincoln Park gifting views to those who choose to visit. Take the time to soak in the views before presuing the art inside. The layout of Legion of Honor is a seemingly never ending maze of rooms on the top floor. Each room flows into another one and it seems as if you may miss a few rooms without ever knowing it.\n\nMuseum staff was friendly and the museum itself is curated beautifully as the displays, including the background wall colors, match the time of the works being exhibited. The permanent collection is spaced very well and specifically the sculptures are smartly stood away from the wall so you can see the process behind much of Rodin's work.\n\nWhile we were there, we also had the chance to see the Anders Zorn exhibition which was exceptional. A Swedish Master, Zorn captures water more perfectly than humanly imaginable. As you look close, all you see are small brush marks and as you step back to view from afar you see brilliant water, as far into the painting as you can look. I didn't mind for one second paying the extra $6 to see this show as it was very comprehensive, covering numerous room and the artist's entire career.\n\nA visit to Legion of Honor is a must for art lovers. The only negative is that it is extremely heavy in terms of 18th and 17th century art, but that is its mission. It just becomes a little overwhelming going from room to room of the permanent collection seeing very similar styles and objects. It is certainly a very nice lesson in the periods displayed. At $10 ($16 total for admission and special exhibition), it is a bargain. You can easily spend 3 hours here without missing a beat. If you are hungry, visit the cafe, it is excellent.", "author": "Jonathan G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-10-08", "description": "Truly a beautiful museum and in my opinion, the most European feeling of all in our fair city.  Since my elderly, over-grown teenager of a father seems to do nothing but lay in bed all day lately as his health deteriorates, we have been trying to come up with ideas that will force him to walk and get some exercise.  Tuesday morning, I realized that the first Tuesday of the month is free at the Legion of Honor (and De Young) so we poked him out of bed and came here.\n\nEver since the major renovation they had over a decade ago, the Legion of Honor has always been one of my favorites, especially with all the Rodin that Mrs. Spreckels donated many years ago.  She made many worthwhile contributions to the city in her time and this museum is one of them.  As we walked through all the various halls, I explained to my dad about her and reminded him of the statue of her that I had pointed out while dining at Burger Bar in Union Square.\n\nRodin has always been my favorite and seeing his timeless staues is always a moving and emotional experience for me.  In one hall, I was surprised by a statue of a squatting female that I had never noticed before which seemed especially risque.  I don't remember the name, but believe it was named after a woman with a name starting in E.  Elsa?  I don't remember, but thought it to be especially racy for the era.\n\nDidn't think to take a picture of it at the time, but did take a couple while there.  Next time, I'll get one of her for sure.\n\nIn an era of greed and ridiculous price gouging for just about everything imaginable, it is comforting to see that the prices for our city's museums remain at a reasonable rate so that everyone, especially today's youth can explore and enjoy.  I recently went to Coit Tower the other day, only to discover that the stairway was closed (as always for years) and that the $3.00 fee for the rickety elevator ride to the top was now $7.00!  For three people, that would have been $21.00.  You have got to be kidding me.  Hmmm, I see another review coming up. \n\nUnlike the Academy of Sciences, the Legion of Honor and De Young museum still have reasonable admission pricing and also a free day, once a month.  These are not profit centers nor were they ever intended to be.  Hoping that whoever is in charge will work hard to keep it this way so that future generations of San Franciscans and visitors can enjoy and get their culture for years to come.  That's what museums are all about.", "author": "Roy N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2012-03-05", "description": "As part of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco (FAMSF) along with the de Young museum, the Legion of Honor houses some of the world's most beautiful works of art, with extensive collections in both Ancient and European art.\n\nOne of the main attractions is the impressive collection of sculptures by French artist, Auguste Rodin (my personal favorite and the majority of my time is spent here).  He was known for his radical and individualistic approach to sculpting, especially when it came to the human body and its realism.\n\nAs you approach the entrance, one of Rodin's signature pieces, \"The Thinker\", towers over you.  Standing in this courtyard, one really gets a feel of the majesty that this palace provides to its visitors.  Almost every time I come here, I see professional photographers at work for wedding pictures or for even just regular couples trying to capture the moment.\n\nAs if the Rodin collection wasn't enough, you can also check out some great pieces from the Impressionist era, such artists like Pissarro, Seurat, Cezanne, and another one of my personal favorites, Claude Monet.\n\nI really love how the curators set up one of Monet's masterpieces, \"Water Lilies\".  As you turn the corner and head towards its section, you can immediately view the painting from a distance as the corridors are perfectly aligned so that you can see all the way to the back wall.  And voila, there you will find all of its glory and beauty!\n\nIn the central room on the top floor, you'll find an organ player where they usually set up seats for people to sit and watch.  During one memorable performance, they had played a piece from the Broadway musical, Phantom of the Opera, that just blew me away.\n\nYou'll find the museum cafe and gift shop on the lower level.  The cafe actually serves pretty decent food and drinks and also includes a pretty big outdoor courtyard with plenty of seating with a small view of the Pacific.  This is a great place to sit down and enjoy a book and I've also seen people study here as well.\n\nThere have been many special exhibits at this museum, including Cartier & America, Japonesque, and the recent one for Italian artist, Gian Lorenzo Bernini, best known for his sculptures and architectural works throughout Rome.  The highlight of this particular exhibit was Bernini's sculpture of the classic Greek myth \"Medusa\".  This piece of art was truly impressive to see.", "author": "Tony L."}

But I am sorry to say that I will NEVER set foot in that place again due to the total tools they employ.\n    \nThis weekend, I went to see the \"Impressionists on the Water\" exhibit with my daughter.  From the moment we set foot there, the first people who greeted us at what I later learned was a ticket desk, barked at everyone to move along, right past them.  While some people went through, the folks in front of me seemed to be as bewildered as I since we still needed to buy our tickets. Now, perhaps the people who went in before us had pre-purchased tickets, I don't know.  But when we asked where to get tickets, we were ordered to come back into the line to buy them. The same ass who waved everyone through was very rude to the people ahead of us, and treated them like they were the idiots.  Wow.  Fortunately, a woman waved us over, and was somewhat more pleasant.\n\nAfter the rather pointless \"light saber\" wanding of our bags (I had a pocket knife, as did my daughter - I wonder what they were looking for?), we were passed through to the gallery.  As we attempted to enter the exhibit, Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber, who were apparently posted by the velvet ropes to check tickets, had wandered off to playfully push and shove each other like the pimply teens they were.  As we attempted to pass however, they came scampering back to order us, rather indignantly, to show them our tickets - again, as if we were trying to pull something over on them, rather than a product of their own ineptness.  Whatever - cuz you so badass, working at the museum.  Oh well, better than McDonald's, I guess.\n\nAs we went through the gallery we were repeatedly reprimanded by the \"guards\" for getting too close to the exhibits, even though there were no signs posted anywhere about maintaining 18\" of distance from the paintings on the wall.  Of course, the rules only seemed to apply to us, since we unknowingly must have done something to offend them - they didn't appear to have a problem with anyone else, even though they got much closer than we did.\n    \nThe final gems were in the gift shop.  When I had the gall to attempt to ask one of the counter princesses if there were any postcards of a particular painting that I liked, before I had even formed my question, Miss Thing rudely cut me off and said that everything they had was out on the floor, \"I mean, it's the last weekend of the exhibit, you know!!!\"  Please forgive me - I am such a dolt to assume you might have had something that I may have overlooked in the piles of overpriced crap that they had left over, spread liberally around the shop.  I promptly put down the items I had intended to purchase and left without giving them another dime.  God forbid I should force my stupid money on you.  Please, get back to your important gossiping instead of doing the jobs you are paid to do. \n  \nPeople have a bad day occasionally, but really?  The whole stinking crew?  I have never seen a more uppity bunch of snotty little oinks in one place in my whole life.  You know, just because you have the fortune to be employed at a place where great works of art are displayed, doesn't mean you're better than the people who pay a sum equivalent to twice your daily wage for the privilege to look at them.  I have been to many museums, all over the world - without exception, the people who worked in them were eager to answer questions and share their knowledge with their GUESTS.

Yes, it was crowded, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nThe layout is interesting. When I first noticed it I wanted to dock a star, but after viewing what all the rooms had to offer, it's really a small inconvenience more than anything. We started with the lower level before jumping in to the main rooms that are on the main level. The layout that I consider interesting is in the main level.\n\nIf you walk straight in, you are caught in what seems to be the special exhibition room. It's the one that most people are in.

And because of its location near the water, it's wonderfully scenic and romantic. No wonder I often see happy couples having their weddings and/or pictures taken.  Parking can be challenging, but is not impossible and there are times that I feel that I have this museum to myself. And somewhere in the middle of my visit, I like their cafe and museum shop. If you want, you can then drive over the the De Young on the same admission. But personally, I'd stay here within this great open and well lit space as long as I could.\n\nAnd here's today's Historical footnote:\n\nThe Legion of Honor was the gift of Alma de Bretteville Spreckels, wife of the sugar magnate and Thoroughbred racehorse owner/breeder Adolph B. Spreckels The building is a three-quarters scale imitation of the Palais de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. It was completed in 1924.\n\nThe museum building occupies an elevated site in Lincoln Park with views over the Golden Gate Bridge. Most of the surrounding Lincoln Park Golf Course is on the site of a potter's field called the \"Golden Gate Cemetery\" that the City had bought in 1867. \n\nThe plaza and fountain in front of the Palace of the Legion of Honor is the western terminus of the Lincoln Highway, the first road across America. The terminus marker and an interpretive plaque are located in the southwest corner of the plaza and fountain, just to the left of the Palace.", "author": "Eric B."}

The pastime of viewing such great artists such as Monet, Caillebotte, Signac and others captivate us with their nautical subjects in light-infused compositions. Those of us who own boats and spend much of our time on the water can appreciate the leisurely life style of these boat owning artists.\n\nOf course, boating themes appear frequently in the history of French art, spanning documentary marine paintings of the 18th century, romantic and naturalist works of the mid-19th century, the Barbizon School, the House Painters School, the School of Scandal and even the School of Hard Knocks which has come down to our time in various colors of black and blue. \n\nWe, the post-post-Impressionist viewing public, approach this subject matter with dynamic new digital techniques and emphases such as iPod and Droid Robot non-flash phone cameras and Paint apps including the textured and feathery audio tour machines available at the entrance to this amicable collection.\n\nThe fleeting effects of light and shadow lead us inexorably to the transformed gift shop where books on competitive boating and au courant motifs drawn from the artists and America Cup racers' daily lives enchant us and cause us to purchase many artistically thick and heavy collections of prints to be placed on our coffee tables and those of our descendants. \n\nNote that noshing in the Cafe, where even the lowly hot dog has the name of a French artiste, is a highly recommended and salubrious nautical experience especially if one sits in the plein air courtyard and feeds bun crumbs to the blackbirds (against the rules.) Watch your 2-year old closely lest he SQUEEZE THROUGH the bars of the locked gate forcing you to run at top speed all the way through the museum, out the door and around the building while trying to suppress images of him rolling down the hill and onto the street only to find out that he has now squeezed back through the fence and into the courtyard and is happily chewing on your hot dog and feeding the rest of the bun to the birds.", "author": "William L."}

Not being a member, the general admission was reasonable.  They do give discounts to seniors and students, and if you have a Bank of America credit card, you can get in free on Sunday.  The special (on loan) exhibits are an extra charge.  Parking is free in the area around the museum, but it does fill up quickly.  I suggest you get there close to opening (9:30 am) or you have to take your chances on someone pulling out as you arrive.\n\nWhat a treat to see some of the famous pieces here.  You don't have to travel to Europe to take in these beauties.  We did not choose to enter the current special exhibit (High Style), but there was plenty to take in with the general admission ticket.  A good representation of art and sculpture.  The museum building itself is beautiful to look at, too.

I was thrilled because a) There was like nobody there. Mainly because it was closed, b) I could see the statue and it was really powerful in person. It made me think. I was sad because the statue was in an outside courtyard on your way into the museum, and the courtyard was gated and locked, mainly because they were closed. I mean I get it. I understand why they have to keep it locked up when they are closed. Mainly because of people like me. But still. It was like he was in jail. Seriously. I think he is thinking about how to tunnel the eff out of there.\n\nWalking the rest of the grounds was fun. Some really awesome statues. A fountain. Lots of cool trees. Close to the Holocaust Memorial. And when I say close, I mean the memorial is, like, in the parking lot of this mueseum.\n\nI hate golf, but I've never wanted to do anything as bad in my life as I wanted to play golf when I saw that golf course.

It's a thorough look at Cartier's influence on American style and culture in the 20th century.  One can see the detail that went into each intricate piece of jewelry.  From brooches, to tiaras, to earrings, to necklaces and watches, it was a very impressive showing of art.  Some of the most memorable pieces included yellow diamond and emerald-encrusted crocodiles and a diamond-encrusted snake.  One of the most creative pieces were the mystery clocks, which seemed to show the clock hands suspended in midair.  I was here for 3 hours and didn't even have time to see the rest of the museum since the exhibit has so many pieces to see.\n\nBesides special exhibits like \"Cartier and America\", they also have a really good permanent collection, which mainly focuses on European art and ranges in styles from traditional, to impressionist to cubism.  The building itself is really cool and the surrounding grounds includes impressive views of the bay and the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\nThe cost is bit much ($20 for an adult), but you can save some money with your MUNI pass or transfer ticket or try to go on a free day of the month.

Also didn't realize there are several casts of this statue all over the world, everyone wins! \n\nSince there was barely an hour to closing, my friends and I got to slip in for free. They were displaying Bernini's tortured cast of Medusa as one of their special exhibitions, originally on display at the Capitoline Museum in Rome (where I was lucky enough to see it for the first time studying abroad). Two other special exhibits were \"The Mourners\" and \"Pisarro's People\" (the latter for an extra fee). \n\nBy far, my favorite rooms housed an impressive Rodin sculpture collection and gorgeous paintings by instantly recognizable French Impressionists, both extremely beautiful and distinctive of their era. Their permanent collection alone is impressive for a small museum. \n\nIt's a relatively small place and I was able to see everything I wanted in the hour we had left.

They wanna see porn, all they have to do is fire up their Macbooks and launch Safari and you are seconds away from ending up in a confessional this Saturday. But back in my day, to catch a glimpse of girls sans clothes I had to travel half way around the world.\n\nThe year was 1986, I was 12 and had never seen naked boobs in full motion. I was too young for R rated movies and there was no internet. So really my only access to viewing porn was whenever I was at my friends house and checking out his big brothers stash of Playboy. \n\nThat summer my parents entered a triathlon in Roth, Germany. We would be tagging along with one of my dad's coworkers and his 14 year old son. I had never heard of Roth before, but I did know it was a small town and not to expect too much excitement. \n\nRace Day.\n\nThe day came, and my parents knowing that spending 10 plus hours watching a triathlon wouldn't be the most exciting thing ever left me my dad's friends son together back at the hotel.\n\n \"Now don't you boys get in any trouble ok?\"\n\nMy friend and I hanging out playing a hand held video game (Yes kids, we had video games back then) when he looks up and says to me. \"you know, there is a theater in town that shows X-rated movies\"\n\nOk, I'm listening.\n\nHe goes on to tell me that this being Europe, that the locals are much more open when it comes to nudity and that anyone at any age can walk into a movie theater and see naked ladies.\n\nSo where might this X rated movie theater be?\n\n\"It's just a few blocks away, they are showing a matinee at 1:00 we could go and be back before our parents return and they would never know\"\n\nI must admit, I was feeling very nervous and thought something might go wrong. The German Police could be planning a sting and arrest us as we try and purchase tickets. But I weighed my options and boobies won out.\n\nJust as my friend had promised, the theater didn't bat an eye and sold us tickets. It was assigned seating and took a few minutes to find our digs. At this point I started hyperventilating. I mean in just a few minutes I am going to see real live boobs! \n\nBut, something was just not right. I take a look around the theater and see quite a few families sitting around us. Moms with their young children seated just a few feet from us. I started to think that German parents were the coolest parents on the planet. I mean taking your kids to a porn flick? How rad is that?\n\nThe lights dim and the movie starts. Long story short, it was an animated flick about a girl and her missing balloon. And no, the girl was not naked.\n\nFast forward a few years later, and today it's historical documents and Impressionist art that gets me hot. And Tomorrow the Legion of Honor will be porn central as they will have in it's temporary collection an original copy of the Magna Carta.", "author": "V B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-12-19", "description": "This review is for the Legion of Honor as a wedding venue.\n\nWe choose the Balustrade Lawn for the Ceremony and the Rodin Galleries for the Reception.  Our wedding here was amazing!!!  We couldn't have asked for a more beautiful venue, especially the view during our ceremony with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background.  \n\nWe chose the Rodin Galleries because if you are going to have a reception at a museum, why not be surrounded by amazing artwork?  The caf\u00e9 holds more people, but it was a little too plain for our taste.\n\nHere are the reasons that I didn't give it 5-stars.  (These are also tips if you are thinking about the Legion as a venue.)\n\n1. Budget.  I know weddings are expensive and everyone always go over budget, but here are some things that you should consider when booking there.  Everything had to be rented.  There is pretty much no lighting except for what is lighting the sculptures (prepare to spend at least $2000 on lighting, we spent about $3000.)  You are required to use only approved caterers, which vary in price.  The Legion does not supply anything with regards to chairs or tables (unless you have the reception in the caf\u00e9.)  For a 100 person wedding, we spent about $6000 on rentals for the ceremony and reception (of course prices will very depending on your vendor).  $400 was spent on the fire permit (required for the caterer.)  About $300 for insurance because of the artwork.  And we were charged rush set-up fees from a couple vendors because of the short timeline that they give you to set up.  If you want more time than the allotted 4 hours, it is $1500 an hour.\n\n2. Timeline.  Your vendors have an extremely short amount of time to set up because the museum is open until 5:15pm (except Mondays when they are closed).  So depending when your reception is (which must start by 7pm, according to their policy), your vendors have to \"haul a##\" to set up, and you are probably too busy getting married to oversee any of it.\n\n3. Policies and Procedures.  The Legion gives you 17 pages of policies and procedures that you must follow.  The important ones include a number of rules regarding the flowers or other \"organic materials.\" You can kiss all candles goodbye (the fire permit mentioned above is for catering.  No live flame allowed in the galleries.  Hope you like battery powered tea candles.)  All vendors must be approved by the Legion and must do a walkthrough, which is hard to coordinate when you have a lot of vendors.  No rice, flower petals, or even bubbles can be used during the ceremony, even for the ceremony on the lawn.  Lastly, no animals allowed.\n\n\nAgain, the wedding was beautiful!!!  And we don't even slightly regret having our wedding at the Legion of Honor.  You should just be aware of the extra costs and rules if you are considering a wedding there.", "author": "Matthew M."}

The permanent collection features works from the 15 - 18th century.

I gather inspiration from the basement collection of Greek works. A nice selection of jewelry, black painted vases and found glass vases are in the side cabinets.

If you like crowds while viewing fine art.  I'm talking about people up in your personal space.  People who could describe the scent of your deodorant, detergent and perfume by the end of the exhibit.  Sometimes, I purposely dress a little shabby to make sure no one treads on me.

Before heading in we walked around for a bit and discovered the Holocaust memorial, while nice was kind of small, while enjoying the views of the Golden Gate Bridge and the Bay.  As we head inside I notice the glass sculpture by Dale Chihuly, it's funny I never notices his stuff in Seattle but always spot it everywhere else, digression I know...\n\nWe notice that there was an Anne Leibovitz exhibit going on, so we paid the extra $5.00 and grab our ticket/sticker to allow us entry.  We decided to do the Anne Leibovitz exhibit first and I will say I was impressed, I've always enjoyed her photography and this exhibit was Annie overload but in a good way.\n\nAfter spending some time in there we decided to check out the rest of the museum.  It had a nice variety, like others I enjoyed the Robin sculptures, The Dead Sea Scrolls exhibit, Monet, Rembrandt, and the Chihuly glass sculptures inside were pretty nice too.\n\nIt was smaller than I expected but I was OK with that because we now had plenty of time to head over to Golden Gate Park and check out the De Young Museum, with the CityPass we had you could visit both museums on the same day so we did.", "author": "Me H."}

Art that will make your head swirl and history that will make you appreciate humanity. \n If visiting on a Sunday, do stay for the live organ recital, held in the first chamber of the museum. The sound eminates throughout the building and is something one must witness in their lifetime.\n Fun fact: Did you know the museum is technically considered one of the three cemetaries in San Francisco? During seismic retrofitting, hundreds of skeletons were found under the grounds of the museum. Turns out the land was once a 'Potter's Cemetary' where peasants and ethnic people were laid to rest.

Made me realize how deficient my knowledge of French history is. If you enjoy French impressionism or studying France, you must see this exhibit while it lasts! It is more etchings than paintings, while the special counterpart showing at the deYoung is more paintings. Both are awesome, and they're buy-one-get-one, so there's no reason not to see both. Yes, the Legion is more out in the boonies, but sooo worth it.\n\nI can't say enough about the beautiful architecture, views, and peaceful feeling here to do it justice, so please go see it for yourself. Parking was a breeze, and the whole atmosphere was very relaxed. \n\nThe setting is especially perfect for photos, so if you plan to take pics, allow plenty of time to fully take advantage of all the scenery. We only snapped a few as we didn't have much time, but next time we go, we'll get a lot more. In one shot, we got: trees, sky, blue bay, stonework, hills, lawn, hedges, and ourselves. That's what I call bang for our photo buck!\n\nThe layout inside was a bit odd, but with all the inner and outer beauty, it didn't matter. Even the ladies' restroom is wonderfully high-class. \n\nWe packed a lunch, so I can't comment on their food offerings.

I'm not art connoisseur so I can't go into detail. This is a review from someone who happened to be at the place at some time.\n\nWhen you arrive, you have to battle for parking, there's not really a sizable lot to speak of so good luck on that front. I'm not sure if this had anything to do with the fact that it was a BoA weekend where you can get in for free or if it's always like that.\n\nWhen you approach you are visually greeted by the architecture of the place. It's fairly imposing as you walk up to the entrance. As you walk past the main gate you see what looks like a mini replica of what looks like the Pyramid at the Louvre made more well known by Tom Hank's movie \"The Da Vinci code\"\n\nOnce inside it is pretty easy to navigate and see everything without the need for a map. On display at the time of our visit were amongst other things were the Mourners.These are small statues from Burgundy in France made hundreds of year ago. The detail and quality are impressive given how long ago these were made. Definitely a highlight.

The building alone is a work of art as it's a three-quarters scale imitation of the Hotel de Salm in Paris. An interesting piece of little known history is that the Lincoln Park Golf Course that surrounds the museum was once the site of the Golden Gate Cemetery. The bodies were moved down to Colma, CA in 1908 when the cemetery was closed; however, in the 1990s when the city was doing seismic retrofitting of the surrounding park, coffins and skeletal remains were still unearthed. Very cool history for a very cool spot in the city. Also, the beautiful historic building is a popular backdrop for couples taking their engagement pictures as well as day-of pictures with their wedding party.\n\nThe name is used for both the museum building and the collection it houses. The Legion's collection spans more than 6,000 years of ancient and European art. Some of the collection highlights and my favorites are: St. John the Baptist by El Greco (1600), The Trotting Horse by Edgar Degas (1881), and Waterlilies by Claude Monet (1914). The museum has a variety of classic and innovative traveling exhibitions. I've seen a traveling exhibit of beautiful Cartier jewelry and works from the Louvre and Museum de Orsay.\n\nCurrently the Legion is showcasing Pulp Fiction: The Art of Belgian artist Isabelle de Borchgrave. de Borchgrave creates fashion literally out of manipulating paper. The exhibition features masterpieces of intricate paper clothing inspired by early European paintings or from famous museum pieces from around the world. The exhibit is somewhat of a history of fashion from such famous individuals as the Medici family, Elizabeth I, Marie-Antoinette and Christian Dior, and Coco Chanel, to name a few. The pieces are literally amazing and its mind boggling how she was able to create these extraordinary pieces of clothing (and shoes) out of paper. The Legion is the first American museum to dedicate an entire exhibition to these works of textile art. \n\nThe exhibit costs $15 for adults, $12 seniors, $11 for kids 6-17 and college students with ID. The museum is open from 9:30am to 5:15pm and has a delicious cafe with outdoor seating.", "author": "Alice S."}

I must state that I'm not the sort of art person that sits for a long time and ponders the meaning of a piece. I'm more likely to sit and stare at the ceiling amazed by the architecture of a building and the artistic layout of a particular room. I found the layout to be a bit strange (when you get to one end of the museum you have no choice but to go through everything you've already seen to get back to the middle and visit the other side). \n\nThe Rodin sculpture selection was absolutely stunning and I loved that they had paintings organized chronologically from almost every artistic movement in Europe.

It was with my mom and little sister (16) and we went to see the Marie Antoinette show.  I got to see the bed from her bedroom.  Her clothes and furniture, it was all very cool.  \n\nThen the first time I went this year was to see the Pulp Fashion show.  I thought it was going to be a show of Elizabethan era dresses, which would be cool in itself.  But when I get there it is one of the most amazing things I've ever seen.  PAPER DRESSES! FROM MY FAVORITE PAINTINGS!  My first thought is who has been doing these amazing works and why haven't I been following them around in a VW Bus for the past decade. Such delicate that all you can think is \"how maddening it must have been to try and get that tissue paper to drape exactly like that\".  My best friend and I found our wedding dress there, but we found it would be in poor taste to try and try it on.\n\nI also saw the Japanese print show.  WOW.  i now am obsessed with Hiroshige and Hokusai.  What amazing colors and beautiful landscapes. And their dedication to the beauty of Mt. Fuji fired up my own feelings of dedication I have for the bay area and its beauty.\n\nThen there are their small shows ( no pun intended) that you walk into not knowing anything and fall in love.  Their miniature show made me a little girl again.  I forgot how much I loved pretty little things.  So, so, so tiny.  How could he make that knight killing that dragon so colorful and detailed, and about a half an inch in diameter. Freaking amazing.\n\nThen there are the grounds around the museum.  After each visit, before I leave I like to walk over on the lawn towards the bay and sit on the wall.

My favorite was the mummy in the Very Postmortem Exhibit! This was what I was hoping to catch a glimpse of in the King Tut exhibit, of course not King Tut himself, but a mummy at least!!! The Legion of Honor should have let De Young borrow their mummy!\n\nI was also excited to the see the Impressionist exhibition. This was my first time in the presence of a real MONET, and it was splendid!!! The art was so lovely. It's hard to believe that a few strokes of color here and there can be turned into something so beautiful and fluid. Monet=Splendid.\n\nBack to Cartier. Wow, if you have not gone to this spectacular display of sheer brilliance, literally, then go now!! Stop reading and just go!! I'm not even a jewelry person, I always laughed at the notion that ALL women were moved by diamonds, since I, certainly was not. After seeing the exhibit though, well... I can definitely see why \"diamonds are a girl's best friend!\"\n\nThe sheer decadence and beauty each piece provoked teared me up with joy and envy!! Damn you diamonds!!! Why are thou so SHINY!!! Glittering pieces of gorgeousness!! I have to give it to Cartier, they are truly the masters of their craft!! You could just see the blood, sweat and tears that went into each piece. Sooooo beautiful!! \n\nI came in with a relative notion of beauty, and I came out with a deep understanding of pulchritude....and a wish list a mile long!!

And in the true spirit of art, the Legion of Honor appears to be a complex, multifaceted, beautiful whole, the parts of which I intend to enjoy more thoroughly at a later date.\n\nAnd how could I not?  The grounds are beautiful and lovingly kept - it was such a joy to take a turn off the main road and be met with rolling fields and trees.  When I made it up the hill to the museum itself, I was in absolute awe of the view.  I love the courtyard area out front, I love the Thinker, and I love all the tourists taking pictures of themselves thinking with him.\n\nThe Japanesque exhibit itself was in the lower level, and was really quite nice.  There was a lot of material to see, but it was organized very intuitively, and the placards by the pictures were informative - and interesting, too!  If you're the type of person who doesn't often read them (and I'm not saying I am!), I imagine they would be quite enough to hold your attention.  The only thing that made the experience any less than stellar was the enormous guided tour going on, but I know that can't be helped - and for what it's worth, the guide sounded very knowledgeable!\n\nWhile my experience wasn't life-changing, the Legion of Honor served its purpose well.  I wanted to know more about the Japanese influence on French artistry.  I got that and more in a lovely setting that's really quite close to where I live - and for only $8 with a MUNI pass.

The result was a memorable, romantic ceremony and reception, which our friends and family, more than a year later, are still talking about.\n\nI read a really negative review of the Legion's event staff, which is what promoted me to write now - over a year after our wedding. I was really surprised at the negative review I read as my wedding was around the same time and I had none of those issues. I am very sorry that bride had difficulties, however my experience was great. \n\nWe got married in the Court of Honor and the entire bridal party had access to the theatre and dressing rooms (and bathroom!) prior to the ceremony and throughout the evening - good thing too because my sister left my husband's ring in her bag down there and one of the groomsmen had to run and get it during the ceremony! When we arrived we were greeted with a plate of yummy cheese and several bottles of champagne. It was a lovely, relaxing way to prepare for the ceremony.\n\nThe ceremony itself was a dream and I know that Vince the facilities manager for the Legion and Jill from Bon Appetit had a lot to do with it.  Additionally, the coordination was really quite impressive (while we were taking pictures after the ceremony, we watched them break down the chairs, etc - they did it in under 20 minutes - amazing!). Both Vince and Jill were VERY helpful and responsive. \n\nLastly. It's hard to imagine what the cafe will look like all dressed up, but it's really quite nice.

His typical lamp shades were made from hundreds of pieces of stained glass cut from poured sheets and then carefully layered to create varied tones, values and trick effects. The surface of the glass was then rippled, mottled, dicrolic to effect a change in color when the light was active.\n\nUtterly unique, Tiffany's could be multi-themed... floral, geometric, fruited, plantlike. The only limitation was inside the creative and fertile mind of it's maker, the geniused Louis Comfort Tiffany who also attached his kaleidoscoped translucent glassworks to shades and bases of copper that unified and linked the shards together. In fact, the bases themselves were also works of art that often enhanced the entire package beloved by millions and sought by museums and collectors throughout the world.\n\nIn the presence of such genius, it is often difficult to put into words something so precious as you gaze upon matched and mismatched sections of design as bases and shrouds can be removed and transferred easily in order to achieve a completely different affect. 2 dimensioned photographing cannot capture what in person is alive and living, breathing, and altering itself as time applies her patina in sections and arenas. Circling each hand-built, mind dreamed creation allows the viewer to capture more fully a complete original entity. Each a mini half-globe, pulsing, throbbing, flashing as different angles of inner light flow through from the center through to the outside atmosphere.\n\nThe exhibit is available and alive until the end of May. Go, take an aficionado with you and together you can experience what is not just greatness but divine inspiration formed into touchable, usable, functional wonderment.\n\nIn the meantime, I bought a book for my Mom's birthday, as soon as she opens her present, I'll take pictures and post them here but to experience them for yourself, you must go and submerge your entire being into what is more than greatness, it is unbelievable.

I'm reviewing this basically as a setting for photography - I work part-time as a model and I've done several shoots here. The grounds are beautiful - despite the amount of tourist traffic running through this place, it's kept very clean. The lawn is well-manicured and the fountain out front is clear of trash. The entryway of the museum is framed on both sides by huge concrete pillars; the minimalist atmosphere with its neutral colors make for a great backdrop in photos. From the front steps, there is an amazing view of the city; if you go down the hill a little bit toward the golf course, the entire length of the GG Bridge and part of the Marin Headlands are also visible. I also want to give a quick bit of praise to the guy at the door - even though I didn't pay, he let me run in real quick to use the bathroom in the middle of a shoot one day.

While it is the less accessible from a transit perspective compared to the De Young, the 18 bus terminates in front. Get here when the museum opens at 9:30am for one of the coveted parking spots.\n\nThe current special exhibit is Artistic Luxury: Faberge, Tiffany, and Lalique. The exhibit is laid out very well. The works of the three are first presented in the context of the 1900 World's Fair in Paris, and you get a little taste of each at the start. It then moves on in the order of the name of the show. My favorites are definitely the Tiffany stained glass pieces and the Faberge egg that was a clock.\n\nI highly recommend a weekend trip to the museum to see Artistic Luxury.", "author": "Eating Sleeping T."}

To be photographed by the genius that Leibowitz is an honor that few ever can claim. \n\nThe exhibit itself was amazing and intense, but also intensely crowded and suffocating. You were basically given a few seconds for each picture before being pushed along, as if you were on an airport people mover. The crowd only slightly marred my experience however. Leibowitz has perfected the technique of capturing the human essence, both celebrity and \"real people.\" The photos capturing the death of her father and long-time lover are poignant, and you feel almost voyeuristic observing such a personal moment, but you can't take your eyes away. \n\nThe Legion and its permanent exhibit are an amazing testament to the curator.

I was told that I had to use the free-standing public restrooms outside the museum, which I did.  \n\nMy maid of honor laid sheets down on the gooey floor of the men's restroom and I put my wedding gown on as bridesmaids stood guard outside.

Our rental contract addendum contained a fee for having the ceremony in the Court of Honor, and the Court was not listed as one of the areas subject to an additional hourly fee.  When our final payment came due, the Legion read a 30 minute time limit into the contract and tried to charge us extra for having the Court open for an hour.  We worked it out, thankfully, and I understand that they've revised their rental materials to include a 30 minute allowance for Court of Honor ceremonies.\n\nIn spite of these things, it was a magical day!\n\nEDIT: In response to an email I sent expressing how disappointing and gross it was to change in the men's restroom, I received a condescending, petty reply.

If you get all of that, though, you're looking at about $20.\n\nIt's a full day for me whenever I come out here. I prefer this little museum to a lot of others... the scale is nice. The parking isn't maddening, though you might have to park down on the street and walk up. I think it's Clement? Not sure. Plus the feeling of solitude up there is wonderful. I always keep my eyes peeled for possible stray golf balls, though.... you just never know when a wild card golfer is going to poink you in the head with a golf ball. It can happen!!\n\nRegardless of that possible danger, it's very much worth the trip. The last time I went it was about $14 to get in. For me it was entirely worth it. I hope it will be for you, too.", "author": "Shari D."}

The courtyard itself is pretty amazing as you step in from the parking lot.\n\nOnce inside, this place is a little smaller than I expected. The experience you'll have here will greatly be weighted by the special exhibit(s) at that time, so check ahead as it may/may not be worth it to you to make it all the way out here.\n\nI had the opportunity to check out the Masterpieces of French Jewelry and I must say some of the pieces were so extravagant, exquisite and beautiful it was memorizing. I mean the detail and fine intricacies of some of these pieces were so beyond anything I've ever seen. Take for example the Zipper Necklace. As a necklace, this piece was gorgeous, but the inside teeth and tassel at the base transforms this piece into a bracelet. \n\nAnother favorite piece of mine were these platinum diamond earrings - this piece of jewelry was my favorite. They were complimented in the same case as these other pieces such as the corn on the cob piece which was amazing.\n\nThe rest of the museum was ok. I did like the Italian Renaissance art they had on display, but like I said before, the feature exhibits are what you should pay attention to when deciding if/when to visit the Legion of Honor.\n\nThis place has free admission on the 1st Tuesday of the month as others have mentioned. Once you purchase your ticket here, you can keep the stub and get free admission (same day) to the de Young Museum.", "author": "E E."}

In fact, admission at one gives you admission to both (but only for the same day), so for people with extreme stamina, you can get 2 museums for the price of one.\n\nWhile De Young contains the contemporary and indigenous art, Legion of Honor has the classic Medieval, Renaissance, and Baroque stuff (including a tantalizingly few Medieval tapestries, one of my favorite genres), as well as the largest Rodin collection outside the Musee Rodin in Paris.  The distribution of the art is very appropriate considering the differing architectures of the two museums.\n\nThe current special exhibition is of French jewelry, which is far more interesting than it sounds, especially the Art Nouveau and Art Deco collections.

I had my camera, so that was great!\n\nNot so good:  This is why I didn't give it 5 stars, but it's my own fault.  Well, I ended up going on the first Tuesday of the month, which is free admission day.  OK, free is good, BUT apparently the word is out that it's free that day because there was a long line to get in.  I think I ended up waiting almost an hour.  Damn, why did I leave my book in the car?  I could've been reading it while I was standing in line (I had gone by myself).  I actually considered leaving & coming back on another day where I would pay admission just to avoid the masses of people.  So, of course there were large crowds for the exhibit too, which makes it less enjoyable.  Reminds me of my Picasso Museum experience in Barcelona...it was free that day & Festes de la Merce was going on in town while I was there (OK, that wasn't planned too well), so there were hordes & hordes of people there. What can I say, I'm not a fan of really crowded museums? \n\nBack to the good:  If you pay for admission at Legion of Honor, it's also good for the DeYoung Museum that day, & vice-versa.  I believe you can take a shuttle between the two.   On the free admission days, the special exhibit entrance fees are also discounted.", "author": "Linda T."}

I've been to most of the other museums in the Bay Area, but for some obscure reason, have missed this one. Anyway, I LOVED it. This is what a true museum should feel like on the inside. The people working there were just fabulous. We have a membership to the Asian Art Museum and there is a reciprocal program for the Legion of Honor except when we got there, the person at the desk had no idea what the reciprocal was and our card wasn't able to swipe through the machine. The lady at the desk was just incredibly nice. She whispered \"ENJOY YOURSELVES!\" and let us in with a member's pass. How awesome was that? I mean, even though our card should've worked, we could've encountered a not-so-nice person who could've made us pay the admission fee.", "author": "Anita L."}

They had an entire room from an 18th century French hotel reconstructed. They had a number of the interiors of houses from Europe, built during the dark ages, reconstructed. These were small, primitive, very basic dwellings. But it was fascinating to enter them and imagine how people lived in the 11-13th centuries. They also had sculptures, paintings, all the things you see in any museum.\n\nI went back today expecting to see all that and perhaps more, since the Museum had done a renovation and added space in the years in between my visits. I was disappointed because the dark ages European homes were gone. It seemed as only a portion of the French hotel room was there, plus a wood paneled room from another structure. There was room after room of paintings. Blah...All of these museums have paintings. After a while they don't seem to be that much different. Removing the unique architectural pieces and replacing the space with more of the same paintings really takes this museum from great to average, in my opinion.\n\n$10 for the basic admission, $15 to see the traveling exhibits and the museum. Not a good value imo.\n\nI still recommend people visit the Legion of Honor, but in my opinion the managers have made  mistakes and could be doing much better.", "author": "Steve J."}

They had Rodin's \"The Kiss\" in bronze on display, and I had never seen it before. I was mesmerized; it was the most beautiful and moving sculpture I had ever seen.

It's a great place, when not foggy, to walk around, the building itself is very nice as well. Entrance isn't too expensive either, my advice (if you're cash-strapped) is to go for a (cheap) concert (for instance, the Pocket Opera performs here regularly) so you get to go inside for free. The Gould theater inside is kind of old and decrepit, but it's fine for chamber music performances. The collection of the museum leaves much to be desired, though. It doesn't come close to being able to compete with Chicago's, New York's or Boston's fine art museums. Too bad, I really believe SF deserves better.\n\nI love the organ that's played every Sunday at 4pm (if I'm not mistaking).

The legion building is simple yet beautiful and positioned where you get several great views of the area.  After checking out the cool courtyard, you can either choose to see the main exhibit or some of the smaller rooms.  If you can, show up on Saturday or Sunday and enjoy a free concert at 4 PM in the Rodin Hall.

The view was awesome! \n\nI can't believe that after living in the bay for 10 years that I have never been to this part of S.F.  The view of the golden gate as well as the ocean was by far one of the most beautiful spots in Frisco that gives the city its renowned beauty.\n\nI personally thought the museum was a bit small, didn't check out the impressionism exhibit but their collection was just okay.  I thought maybe Stanford museum had more interesting ones.  But a few really stuck out.  The two statues, the thinker and the El Cid in the front of the museum was really cool.  I am a history geek and I remember El Cid on history channel!  Seeing his statue was really cool.  There were few biblical paintings that were great too but dead sea scroll was the best for me.\n\nI saw 2 scraps or pieces of paper that were probably one of the oldest written documents ever.

Great gift shop too.  \n\nThere are marvelous pipe organ concerts on the weekends and relevant activities for children of two different age groups on Saturdays.  My kids have enjoyed these.  \n\nGreat exhibits we have seen here include Georgia O'Keefe, Claude Lorrain, Gustave Courbet, Bouquets to Art (yearly), Monet in Normandy, Art Deco, DaVinci and Poland (?!), Max Ernst, and Henry Moore.  \n\nYou can take gorgeous walks around and behind the museum up to the VA hospital behind it and out along the ocean.

The current special exhibit, da Vinci's sketches, was a bit of a let down - just a small room with about 15 items.

Here, you'll find several artworks by some famous artists like Van Gogh, Monet, Seurat, Rodin... as well as artworks by a bunch of people I didn't know, but still pretty impressive stuff!!  ;-)\n\nThe highlight of this place for me was being \"greeted\" at the front by the world famous statue, \"Thinker\" by Rodin.  Just the fact that I've seen so many references to that statue, whether it be on TV, movies, people's jokes and conversations... and to finally see THE STATUE was like... whoa, cool  :-)\n\nPlus, if you visit here, you get a free admission to the De Young Museum (which is where they have American art I believe) on the same day... unfortunately we didn't have time to go there, our trip to SF was pretty short :-(", "author": "Melissa B."}

I have to tell you now, I have no art background whatsoever. I have no extensive knowledge about it, but the fact is, you don't have to have those to appreciate this place. \n\nThey have everything from religious paintings, 17-19th century, renaissance, etc, but I think their biggest collection is of European art, which I loved. I noticed they had many of Rodin's and Monet's that I remember from history classes. I was trying to look for Picasso because I've heard he has some here, but didn't find any. Too bad. I think I was just so distracted because there are so many things to see! \n\nI particularly loved the victorian room completed with its walls, doors, cabinets, and other furniture. Also, the crazy beautiful ceiling that I believe is Spanish. (?) It was as if I was in a whole different place and time. Another part of the museum that I enjoyed so much was their special exhibit of Faberge, Tiffany, and Lalique; Just amazing! Worthy of the extra $10. \n\nI would definitely come back again, especially that their next special exhibit is King Tut's. That's something I'm very much looking forward to.

But in terms of a museum I want to lose myself in, give me the Legion of Honor anyday. \n\nUnlike the SFMOMA, which is consistently stuffed to the gills with tourists and onlookers breathing over your shoulder, chewing gum while listening to audio tours and  bumping into you while not looking where they are going -- the Legion is ever so open, blissfully expansive (and free of the masses) and PEACEFUL, even on a Saturday. Such a gorgeous view of the city outside, such a beautiful building, with its stone walls and curving wood banisters... One can relax and hear oneself think.\n\nThe exhbits are always interesting, with a good number of works on paper, and always an exhibit of illustrated or artist's books. Many rare works of art you couldn't see anywhere else, both historic and contemporary. I was so happy to finally get my membership card in the mail, so I could visit the current show, \"Rembrandt to Thiebaud: A Decade of Collecting Works on Paper,\" which is a real stunner. You'll want to take your time with this one.\n\nI listened to the sounds of an antique violin on display, and wandered through the French period rooms to gaze at the historic decorative paneling, glass and furniture. I even spotted a man walking through the halls in full period costume of the 17th century.\n\nAt 4 pm, Keith Thompson played an amazing concert on the majestic symphonic organ, built into the walls of the museum itself. The acoustics of the rooms are so impressive, the music travels throughout the museum. Unfortunately, this also meant that you could hear every cell phone user and obnoxious incessant conversationalist in the rooms as well. (Such music is meant to transport you --- please consider not talking for a few minutes of music, ok, people? Silence isn't deadly, I promise. We'll all enjoy the experience, more, ok?. Text message if you must.)\n\nYou can also enjoy a meal in the cafe - not cheap, but tasty.

I couldn't have asked for a lovelier location to exchange vows.\n\n\n The museum (along with most of the museums in San Francisco) uses an amazing caterer, which we were required to use for our ceremony. We couldn't have been happier with the meal and the service, and the fact that it held in the museum cafe made no difference. They transformed the space into the perfect wedding venue.\n\n\n Aside from the wedding, the museum itself is quite a hidden little gem in the city. Most attention goes to the Modern Art Museum or the DeYoung in Golden Gate Park. The Legion is often overlooked, I'm guessing because of the off-the-beaten-path location.\n\n\n However, if you can find your way to this landmark, do it. Be warned: The weekends are pretty brutal. You may have to fight your way through a gaggle of brides and their limos. Photographers LOVE the lighting in the courtyard and often bring their subjects here for a quick photo shootwhich is incredibly annoying for brides (like me) who are actually booked to be married at the museum.", "author": "sfKristina"}

On a number of occasions I've accompanied a friend who has a hearing deficit and when informed that she cannot hear their instructions and asked them to please speak up she is met with a sideways glance and ignored. So, my recent visits have started out on a less than bright note.  And given that I'm not a huge fan of the bulk of their displayed collection I guess that leaves going there to enjoy the stunning setting and possibly buy something in the cafe.  I will say that the people in the cafe are much kinder and helpful than those up front.  I just wish management would be more aggressive in upgrading their menu.  On the visit to the cafe today around 11am we found the display cases empty.  Maybe I'm expecting too much to want something to eat with my coffee.  After a brief visit to view the handful of Matisse paintings, drawings, etc. we decided to check out their lunch menu.  Meh!  Would rather go home and make some lunch.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-06-21", "description": "On the most perfect January day I've ever seen in SF, I came here with one of my favorite native San Franciscans. The initial draw was the Marie-Antoinette exhibit (http://www.famsf.org/legion/exhibitions/exhibition.asp?exhibitionkey=737) , which was pretty amazing in and of itself, but I love just about everything about this place. In fact, it's my favorite museum in the SF Bay Area.\n\n\n The architecture of the building reminds me of museums I've been to in Europe (for some reason, it reminds me of the Picasso Museum, which is my favorite museum in Paris). Big and cavernous and a little dark and dank, especially in some of the medieval art rooms at the very back. And you don't have to be a sculpture buff to appreciate the fact that this place has THE THINKER -- not the original, which is at the Rodin Museum, but one of the 20 casts made of it -- as well as an impressive collection of other Rodin sculptures. I love the fact that the Thinker represents Dante in front of the gates of hell, I suppose that would give anyone pause for thought.\n\n\n They also have nice, big rooms that are generally uncrowded, so you can sit and ponder the meaning of life just like Kim Novak did in Vertigo. And then there is \"The Broken Pitcher\" by Bouguereau, the poster I hung in my college dorm room, which is still as hauntingly beautiful to me now as it was 25 years ago. In January, I sat in that room on a fairly empty week day, pondering her sorrowful gaze (there are many interpretations, some form of lost innocence being the most predominant). This is not my favorite Bouguereau -- that one is The Birth of Venus at the Musee d'Orsay, one of the many interpretations that pays homage to Botticelli -- but it is a close second.\n\n\n There is also a small Holocaust memorial just to the left of the fountain outside if you are standing facing the city with your back to the museum. I wandered over there and sat in front of it for a few moments and found it very moving.\n\n\n Finally, there are the stunning city views from everywhere outside and the beautiful grounds of Lincoln Park, where the Legion is located. If you are lucky enough to be here on a clear day, the view is simply spectacular. I cannot think of a more lovely setting for a wedding, except maybe Laguna Beach, California.", "author": "bloomsday"}

I was struck by her independence and her attention to detail. It wasn't for whatever reasons the 'patrons of the Arts' had to say anything about it. It was her, her colors flowing onto the page, and her attention to nature that drew me in. I get Georgia. I want so bad to go to Ghost Ranch-it's like a pilgrimage unrequited-for it has not happened yet. I like the fact Gaugin was interested in people that looked like me in fabrics uncommon to stuffy western society at the time. I loved the colors. Possibly the patrons might not agree with me, but I don't care. \nThey don't paint. I do. \nI've seen the whole, entire Louvre, the Smithsonian, and the Musee Orsay. The De Young-does not cut it. The Legion of Honor does.\n\nWhy didn't I become an artist and only an artist? Because I never wanted to have to sell my soul, my passion, to the galleries, who treat art as if skinny jeans were the new fashion. Fashion is fickle and like a cruel mistress leaves next season and returns forlorn and strung out ten years later wishing she could have seen you for what you were. \nI'm not talking about what THEY say art is--like at the new DeYoung-believe me-I met one of the patrons and she was none to happy with my modest, mortal opinion. I remember the old De Young. It was so much livelier and more in harmony with the Louvre. Alas, the artsies took it over and destroyed the building I remember as a child. It was the place where my mother took me to show me the world under one roof. The place I first saw two inches away from my nose Monet's works come to visit its precious halls when I was 17. Guess how many Georgia O' Keefe's are in the De Young? One. Only one. I guess the Bubble Gum machine art is just a nice. It's sad really. \n\nThe Legion of Honor on the other hand has preserved one of the places from my childhood that I certainly will take others to see. When you first walk in, you see the Replica of the Thinker by Rodin. The original is in the garden at the Musee Rodin in Paris. In the main hall is more of his works. My body communicates as a dancer and he understood the human body well, with all its twists, turns, and range of emotion gauged in a single piece of stone or metal. There is nothing like it. It is for the vivacity of existence, my love of exploding color on my paint brush, or sliding color with my multicolored, smudged finger that I appreciate the Legion over the De Young. \nIt was here at the Legion that one of Leonardo Da Vinci's painting hung on the walls. I took my mother to see it to repay the favor of inspiration.\n I absolutely adore Rodin, and am convinced, that if I were to live during his time, I would have been his groupie or even better, I would have loved to be his apprentice. I applaud the Legion of Honor for treasuring the works of the past in order to honor the future and inspire the artists who just don't want to see what everyone else likes.\n\nThe mark of anything of anyone of good character is healthy love and respect for the past to inspire the future to create their own opinions. Like oral histories, the art should be honored and preserved. Not put in a basement or have a cave plundered without respect to those ancestors. \n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i7gRXXh9Q_Q", "author": "J A."}

I had never been to this museum and wasn't sure what to expect.  When we arrived the parking was sparse but we lucked out as someone was leaving just steps from the front of the museum.  The museum is quite impressive from the exterior flanked with large columns.  There is a covered courtyard before entering that appears ideal for a swanky party or wedding.  Upon entering you are greeted by the ticket office and security.  There is a coat check room located on the first floor.  The permanent exhibits are located on than floor and featured several of Rodin's sculpture pieces, along with numerous rooms of private collections of artwork, primarily paintings, sculpture pieces and furniture.  The large rooms are filled with lots of natural light and warmed with herringbone-laced hardwood flooring.  It was quite impressive to see so many masterpieces in one location.  While the museum was bustling with spectators the proportions of the building never made you feel crowded, which was the opposite of the De Young exhibit (see my review of the De Young Museum for more details).  Downstairs featured the current exhibit of the Japanese Woodcut Art.  Having taken some art history classes in college along with printmaking classes, I was very interested in seeing the collection.  Of course there was the famous Hokusai's Wave, but also a showcase of how each step of color and image were laid to create the final work.  There were several rooms filled with works from various artists along with French artist's interpretation of Woodcut Art but using lithography.  In addition, spectators that were interested could view a video of a Woodcut Artist creating a print. Overall, I found the museum a true gem and would definitely like to go back and spend more time viewing the permanent collections along with any current exhibits.  If you enjoy architecture or art the Legion of Honor should be on your list of places to see.", "author": "Perry W."}

The Legion of Honor is one of them, so today I ventured out to have a look at their collection.  I was here once before but then I only visited the temporary Monet in Normandy exhibition.\n\nFirst of all: The views of the Golden Gate Bridge, the Pacific Ocean and the city are amazing!  Just walk up to the museum and walk around for a bit, you will not be disappointed.\n\nThe museum itself is a beautiful building, with a very nice 'courtyard' where you will find one of Rodin's \"The Thinker\".  The Rodin collection is impressive, one of the best in the world (except of course for the Rodin museum in Paris).  I was less impressed by their collection of European art, but of course that's because I'm European and visited the most beautiful European museums where the collections are much more impressive.  It's a nice collection though.\n\nI do not understand why they put displays in the hallway to the restrooms, or even hide one of the collections behind the women's restrooms (the ceramics).  The shop is small (the one at the MoMA is way better), but that's not really a problem, but the volunteers were gossiping about the curators and visitors (not really nice of them).", "author": "Marijke D."}

I would suggest to purchase a yearly membership which would cover both Fine Arts Museums, Legion of Honor and De Young in Golden Gate park.  It is only about $80 per family per year, kids under 12 are always free and the cost of membership pays off after about 3 visits.  The membership would also get you a handy discount in both museums' gift shops which are full of current-exhibitions-themed books, jewelry and home decorations.  One of the great places to buy classy inexpensive gifts for friends.

The facilities manager was at all times professional, and I must emphasize this, given the earlier review posted.  He accommodated our needs with ease.  For example, he helped me every step of the way in acquiring event insurance.  He was instrumental in the design of our ceremony decor.  We were able to get married among Rodin and Chihuly sculptures and the facilities manager made many useful suggestions as to how to save money on lighting and maximize the use of topiaries and waxleaf panel hedges.  He has an aesthetic gift, and combined with his experience in executing events, his input was invaluable.  When I had an issue with a vendor, he guided me as to how to resolve the problem in a professional and constructive manner.\n\nGetting married at the Legion was simply a treat.  All of our friends remarked on the beauty of the setting and somehow, this grand space transformed into an intimate setting for our nuptials.

Half the people I talk to don't even know it's there.  Every first Tuesday is free too, so there isn't an excuse not to visit the most beautiful art museum in the world.  Really. No Joke.  First of all, it's set overlooking the Pacific ocean, the Golden Gate Bridge, Marin Headlands and back at the 7 Hills of San Francisco. \nSecondly it has the largest collection of Rodins outside of the Musee Rodin in Paris (Philadelphia argues they have a larger collection...and indeed the have the Burghers of Calais life size, but most of the pieces there are done posthumusly...not that that's a problem, but Dorothy Spreckels, of the Spreckels sugar fortune collected many pieces during Rodin's last few years alive from the artist himself and donated her collection almost in entirety to the Legion of Honor) Also there is one of 5 or 6 castings of The Thinker there.\nLegion of Honor also hosts many visiting paintings from time to time. When the British museum was renovating, the Egyptian collection came, but also a very famous (and my favorite) Thomas Gainesborough made it out here of a beautiful newly wedded couple.  The collection is all in all- stunning, but strained until now because the de Young collection and Legion collection were housed in the Legion during the de Young construction.  \nI love this place. Also Sherwin and I have a tree there.  Some tree was planted on our anniversary 65 or something years ago.", "author": "Yvonne Y."}

You get a taste of many different periods without spending too much time on any one.  The collection of Rodin is wonderful.  I spend a lot of time just staring at the figures, moving around them in circles..........\nWhen I was there last, there was one of the dead sea scrolls along with some other pieces on loan from the Israel Antiquities Authority.  It was kind of surreal seeing a piece of one of the scrolls in person.  Unfortunately some guy started taking flash photography of the scroll while I was in the exhibit!!!  Can you believe it?  Another guy was knocking on the Rodins!  The only thing that is at all negative about this beautiful place is that there doesn't seem to be any security anywhere!  The view from Land's End is amazing and the exterior of the museum is nearly as breathtaking as the interior.  But Alas, my favorite thing about the museum is that there is a painting I came across which has my sister in it!  It is called Love and the Maiden and the Maiden is my sister!  I mean an exact rendition!  I sent her a picture and she couldn't believe it either.  They also have a Chihuly in the court of honor now which I haven't seen.

It stood out in the midst of this stormy San Francisco weather with wind, rain and the turbulent waves of the pacific ocean.  This set the mood for our visit to the museum.\nThe Marie Antoinette exhibit was featured that day,  it was the  one before the Leiboivitz exhibit.  It was awesome;  she is one of my favorite historical figures.  The paintings were grand and there were actual pieces of her furniture displayed, remarkably well preserved.   I can't even describe in words how beautiful some of the pieces were.  It really takes your breaths away.\nThe rest of the museum displays some of my favorite European styles of art history.  Everything from baroque and rococo and some impressionism.  It begins in about the middle ages through the renaissance and into the classical period finishing with a few examples of modern art.  It also has some rooms of original fireplaces, chandeliers, and silver.

It's truly in a beautiful place. The facilities are well maintained and clean. I have to say that their permanent collection never appears to change significantly. I tend to hope that they would rearrange some stuff or add more variety. In that sense it seems to always be the same. Aren't museums supposed to do that every once in a while even for their permanent collections? The museum cafe is very good but a little fancy (organic such and such/$$). I guess a museum cafe should be fancy, especially in a prestigious place like this. I would suggest checking their website in advance for information about their current exhibitions. There is a membership you can buy with which you can also visit the De Young Museum in Golden Gate Park. Parking can be a hassle. The last couple of times we had to park at the bottom of the hill in the residential area because the lots were full. No biggie really, I guess we needed the exercise : P but just keep that in mind in case you have trouble walking long distances or uphill.", "author": "Al B."}
