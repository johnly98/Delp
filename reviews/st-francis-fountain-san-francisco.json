The wait was around 10 minutes, which we utilized to decide what to order. \n\nWe were seated on the other side of the restaurant which didn't have the best ambiance. They definitely skimped on the lighting, making the entire room feel really dull and uninviting. The water served was lukewarm and tasted funky. \n\nMy sister ordered the buttermilk hot cakes that came with salted butter and one slice of orange garnish. In terms of flavor, although fluffy, we both came to a consensus that it was somewhat off-putting? I wasn't sure if it was the flour they used or their over all pancake batter, but there was this grainy floury aftertaste the more you ate it. \n\nI ordered the French Toast Delight that came with yogurt, granola and fruits. With how it was worded on the menu, I originally assumed the parfait-like portion of this dish would be on the side, INSTEAD it was on TOP of my French toast... Amongst my fruit, I was lucky to get a nice piece of the apple core, which humans can totally just ingest those apple seeds no problem (if you didn't get, sarcasm). Anyway, for $10.50, all I wanted was some good simple French Toast, but got played hard. The yogurt toppings in my opinion was a terrible pairing. The sourness from the yogurt literally overpowered everything and the dryness of the granola ruined the texture I hoped from the fluffy French toast... The selection of fruit was quite sad, just raisins, apple and cantaloupe chunks, strawberries and grapes, which are some odd pairings with yogurt and toast? As for the toast, I was disappointed.... just didn't satisfy those cravings and wished I walked a bit further or something to go to some other brunch place. \n\nTL;DR: don't recommend the pancakes and French toast Delight. However I'm sure their other brunch items may be better.", "author": "Lisa L."}

I am super happy my friends are so cool and they suggested I hit up St. Francis Fountain while I was in San Francisco.

We easily found a parking spot and had no problems getting a table for two. This place is long and skinny and it might be tough to have large groups or the weekend wave could also be a damper. \n\nThe prices were so cheap! I really could not believe it. And there was a ton of veggie and vegan options. I could to omelettes, 2 eggs special, breakfast sandwich, a veggie hash with vegan chorizo, huevos rancheros but the \"Nebulous Potato Thing\" won this breakfast battle. It's potatos, salsa, sour cream, melted cheese tiled with an egg.

We had the tofu scramble with mushroom, green onion and ranchero sauce. It came with potatoes and toast, and since my girlfriend is vegan they were kind enough to tip her off about asking for vegan butter since the toast usually comes pre-buttered. The scramble could have had more flavor and pizazz to it, for sure. The potatoes and veggies were great but I think marinating the tofu or throwing some spices on it would have really kicked things up a notch. \n\nOn the sweet side, I had the vegan pancakes with strawberries and I can honestly say they were the best vegan pancakes I've ever had.

The tuna was super dry and there was hardly enough cheese.  Plus, it was mostly hardened once it reached the table.  Oh, and the tomato slices even managed to be bland.  The french fries were revolting.  See attached photos.  They looked as though they were fried and then refried in old, stanky oil....and then let to sit out for....some time.\n\nMy boyfriend's meal was no better.  His french toast tasted totally of salted butter - so much so that it overpowered the maple syrup, which is hard to do.\n\nI realize this review sounds pretty dire, but I think the place is cute and service is quick and I'm sure their ice cream sundaes are enjoyable, so maybe just come here for the dessert...\n\nP.S. They have an inexplicable policy of ending outdoor seating TWO HOURS before they close (maybe three, but definitely no less than two).  This was hugely disappointing to us, as we brought our dog and I was very freaked out to tie him up outside (even though we literally sat on the opposite side of the window).  I really can't explain why anyone would have this type of policy, and even though we didn't make a stink when they informed us that we couldn't sit outside (literally just \"oh, ok\"), the waiter told us repeatedly and even went so far as to suggest we \"remember this for next time.\" Very bizarre...especially since another couple with a dog was sitting at one of those tables when we arrived, at least an hour after that supposedly ended.", "author": "Tay H."}

They even have veganaise and Earth Balance Buttery Spread.\n\nI ordered the vegan blueberry pancakes with a side of vegan chorizo hash. The pancakes are more dense and chewy than your typical buttermilk variety. This is neither better nor worse, just different. They were bursting with blueberries, which was a treat. The vegan chorizo hash is quite oily (as hash often is), but it's quite tasty. They served it with the Earth Balance spread, which I had never tried before. It's pretty similar to a salted, whipped butter.\n\nMy partner ordered the Polar Melt on light rye. The seitan is well seasoned. If you like patty melts and the like, this is a great veggie option (it came with jack cheese, which you can probably leave off it you want to go vegan). It's one of the best melts I've tasted in a long time!\n\nThey carry Mitchell's ice cream and La Copa Loca gelato for desserts and fountain drinks. They also have vanilla soy as a non-dairy option.

Although I have been here in SF a very long time I don't get to every corner of the city and until recently had no reason to visit 24th street.\n\nIt is a rather odd feeling when you are in a place that feels familiar down to the correct old booths but you can't order the old 49er special which was trademark of the place.  Supposedly the long gone special is what the local businessman who got the 49ers going in San Francisco so very long ago ate in the back booths when they were considering their options.  If I recall correctly it was something like  1/2 of a grilled cheese and  1/2 of a club sandwich.  With most of the kids infesting this place parents probably not yet conceived I doubt any of the 30-40 folks in the place when I was there having breakfast have a clue about it.  We're talking old time San Francisco grub - legendary grub which is sadly lacking from the place.\n\nBeing an old fart, it is nice to see respectful hard-working young wait staff and I'll give them 10 stars for their efforts (even thought I did not get the 10% Senior Discount). The service was fast and friendly which is refreshing.\n\nSorry to say the food was pretty tasteless due in my opinion to trying to be too many things at once.  I had hoped for a classic breakfast from the old days but it was not in the offerings.  Instead was a mishmash of things trying to mix Latino inspired and classic American breakfast at once which vaguely tasted like an enchilada with cheap sauce and a dash of a classic breakfast.  If I want a classic Latino breakfast I can get one which has flavors which sing down on Geary Street for less than half of the $22 I paid for Breakfast at the St. Francis...\n\nI'm left with the Height Street metaphor writing this.  Younger folks think hanging on the Height is reliving the Summer of Love.  They are trying to feel something now which has little if any resemblance to what happened there so long ago.  So, The St. Francis will remain a caricature of the once great place it was now full of young people making their own St. Francis Fountain reality in 2017.  There is an old saying you can never go home and this is clearly the case with the St. Francis.\n\nI do wish I had a time machine to revisit it 35 years ago...", "author": "Dalt W."}

I definitely enjoyed the food here, but the wait was long and somewhat convoluted. Really convenient location on 24th Street, just a 10-15 minute walk from the BART. I live just steps away from this place, so I'll be back, but maybe not when it's so busy. \n\nOur wait experience: The guy calling names out didn't try very hard, so you had to be leaning in on your tippy toes to hear if he called your name. Oftentimes people would leave and come back after their name had already been called, and they would have to talk to the host about putting their name back where it was before. Overall, it was a slight roller coaster of emotions before we even got seated. It took about 45 minutes to get seated, though he gave us an estimate of 20 minutes (we arrived at 11:15am). \n\nOur pre-dining experience: They were obviously busy; our host plopped menus down on our table and our server took about 15 minutes to take our order (he acknowledged us every so often, so I couldn't be too mad). A lady came around serving coffee, and before we could say no, she started pouring for us -- we were a little taken aback by this. \n\nTHE FOOD: Fortunately, the food was delicious. I ordered the corned beef hash with over-medium eggs. Everything was rich, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. Decent portion size too, which was expected but appreciated from this diner establishment. They do have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options here if that's your thang. \n\nProtip: If you're a larger person, I'd recommend sitting at the bar -- the booths are quite small.", "author": "Christine L."}

I was not given a menu card and had to ask twice for it. After a brief while I saw and grabbed the menu card that was lying a few seats down on the diner bar. \n\nA waitress whizzed by few times but I was unable to get her attention or a simple few word response. After about 10 minutes I leaned over a little from my stool and said: \"Could I have some coffee please\". \nNo reaction, no response as if I was surrounded by blind deaf mutes. In my third attempt asking for coffee, I finally got heard and got a cup of coffee.\n\nBut nothing much else happened. I tried to get the attention of another diner bartender but he seemed to be \"not seeing me\". Finally was able to get the attention of a waitress which promised me she'll be right with me. But, that never happened either.\n\nHaving made my choice for breakfast, I mentioned upon receiving the coffee that I'd like to order XYZ  from the menu. To my astonishment, I was not heard.\n\nSo I sat there with my coffee trying to get the attention of the person behind the diner bar or the waitress. However, despite the sparsely populated restaurant it appeared that all waiters were extremely busy when it came to me trying to getting their attention.\n\nAnother attempt failed, I was not heard but I was ignored. The ignoring continued and I started to notice that a man that came in after me and sat several seats down from me got recognized right away, placed his order and received is breakfast within about five minutes.\nHmm...\n\nStill trying to get the attention of the waitress or diner bar waiter I noticed a couple coming in and sitting down. Right away they got service, ordered the food and again within about five minutes got their food.\nhmm... hmm...\n\nI made one final last attempt to get the attention to what my breakfast but I was ignored as if I were the invisible man.\n\nI finally I had it, got up walked upfront to the cash register and said: \"I want to pay for coffee and would like to know why I am being ignored, sitting here for almost  1/2 an hour and people coming in after me are being served. Did I offend anyone? \" \n\nThe reply was: \"It's okay, you don't have to pay for the coffee, have a nice day.\" \nI said: \"Thanks, but I ordered the coffee and of course I want to pay for it but I just like to know why no one would take my breakfast order as I'm here for over an hour and I noticed people Coming in after me getting served fairly swiftly.\"\n\nAgain the reply was (irrelevant to my question):  ...The coffee is on the house, just have a nice day, goodbye.\"\nOne could say that that reply was basically falling short of saying \"please leave the premises\" so obvious it was.\n\nSo anyone who reads this tell me now why? What did I do wrong?\nI was formal friendly, nicely dressed, patient and with a calm voice...\nWhat possible offense could I have done to be treated like that?\nI have no clue.\n\nWhen I left the establishment and walked out I looked one more time back through the window and saw briefly in the window a reflection of myself:\n\nTall, white-haired, fit white male, dressed in brown leather shoes, beige slacks, a blue blazer, a white shirt two button open at the collar and a red, neutral with no advertising or any label of sorts baseball cap on my head.\n\nAnd then it dawned on me!\n\nThose employees there are in my opinion the bottom end of lowlife presumptuous and judgmental bigots lower than pond scum.  \nThe reason I'm saying it is that from their behavior they likely were making a judgment based on my race, age and the way I was dressed (which coincidentally happened to be similar to what the current president was dressed like during campaigning Although I dressed like that years before that man appeared like that And can prove it with a family snapshot taken years ago)\n\nThe fact that I'm tall, a white male and dressed evidently and obviously a little better than all those drab, somewhat raggedy dressed down around me folks has absolutely nothing to do with my true persona, character and behavior.\n\nSo much for open-mindedness, fairness and equality as once again those who preach the most, practice the least and are the most intolerant themselves!", "author": "The N."}

From the moment I walked in, I loved this place, with its wooden booths and candy counter and old menu items hung on the wall as decoration (the pineapple and cream cheese salad sign is hilarious!).\n\nThe service is super friendly. We walked in and were immediately seated (though that was before 10 am. By the time we left shortly after 10, the place was pretty packed) and given water and coffee. Two servers were handling tables, expediting food, taking orders and checking refills, and they were very attentive. Even when most of the booths were filled, our coffee cups were never empty.\n\nAnd the food is AMAZING. It's what you only dream diner food can be. The sourdough french toast is absolutely the perfect balance of sweetness tempered by sourdough tartness. The eggs are great and the potatoes are salty and delicious and addicting. My only regret is that I got full and couldn't eat more!\n\nDefinitely check this place out!", "author": "Victoria B."}

We had a 20 minute wait before we were seated. The place has s very hipster diner feel. The server was very accommodating of my dietary needs. The best part about the menu is they have a lot of vegetarian options other than the typical pancakes and waffles. We ordered the buttermilk pancakes with strawberry, a veggie mess replacing the egg with tofu and a vegan chili bowl. The pancakes even though good were the last impressive of the lot. The bowl of chili came with the most delicious cornbread I've eaten. The vegetarian mess was a winner as well. This is definitely going to be a regular spot for me when I'm craving a hearty brunch.", "author": "Jeel J."}

Not so at the St Francis. In addition to Vegan Pancakes(!), there was a vegan scramble with different options for sauces, and tofu could be substituted in on most of their egg dishes. She ended up with a tofu scramble with a ginger peanut sauce, while I opted for the Veggie mess, which was assorted veggies scrambled with eggs and veggie chorizo.

We heard about this place from other relatives, raving about how great this place is. So when we decided to come here, it was about ten minutes to 2pm on a Sunday. My mom, my brother, and my elderly aunt and I walk in, all smiles, hungry, and hoping to a good meal! The stoned looking hipster guy at the counter looked at us, rolled his eyes, and let out a big sigh as if we were bothering him. He then seemed to force a smile and walked up to us and said in quite a stern manner, \"We close at 3. We're not seating anyone.\" Umm. Wow. Hi. Not even a, \"Hello, how are you?\" or a, \"Hi, welcome! What would you like?\"\n\nAs waitress and hostess myself, I was appalled by his attitude. If I was to ever do what he did to MY customers, I'd be fired on the spot! Anyways, I kindly stayed smiling and gently replied, \"But your website says you close at 4pm?\" then he snapped back. \"Yeah no, we're closing at 3pm. To-go orders only.\" and hands us all one menu. One. Single. Menu. My family and I looked at each other in shock. Did did we do something wrong?\n\nA group of hipster kids (perhaps friends of the server?) came in after us as we're still standing by the door. And the server smiles, laughs, welcomes then in and seats them all. Meanwhile, my party had been standing near the entrance for about ten minutes. I was about to order just a couple things, a milkshake and a grilled cheese, we couldn't get anyone's attention, because all theirs was focused on their friends. Unbelievable.\n\nMy dad finally comes in to join us, about five minutes after that. Then he asks us, \"Why are you all standing here?\" and my mom replies, \"They refused to seat us...\" so my dad finally says, \"Forget it. Let's go.\" and we all leave. I could see the server look at us through the window as if he was relieved to see us go.\n\nMy family and I are Bay Area locals who've been here for five generations. Never in my life have I been to a local joint and treated like trash. So sad this place lacks local charm, and also sadly seems to be overrun by entitled hipsters and yuppies. Not saying they can't enjoy this place too, but when you make your fellow neighbors who know the area inside and out feel unwelcome, that right there is bad business.\n\nI was truly looking forward to this, but I'm appalled by what I experienced yesterday. All we wanted were some shakes and maybe a sandwich. Instead, we got service with attitude, dirty looks, and no food. Maybe hire some new people or train your current servers in courses for attitude adjustment. So sorry to give such a negative review to an old local joint.", "author": "Molly M."}

He gave me corn beef hash with eggs Instead of vegan chorizo hash. I haven't ate animal products in over a year. When I told him he gave me the wrong thing he kept asking what kind of eggs I wanted on my VEGAN chorizo hash. I told him it's not vegan if you're adding eggs. Then he said he would comp my meal but actually only gave me the difference. It also came with bread with regular butter but I didn't know that it was regular butter or meat I thought they just accidentally put egg. So now I'm disappointed and I have a stomach ache.

I took one of my daughters and we went for brunch, I was in the mood for some vegan pancakes. We found parking right in front and it wasn't super busy, so we took a seat and made our decisions, she got the strawberry vegan pancakes with a side of vegan sausage patties and I got the vegan blueberry pancakes with a side of potatoes, we split everything and were stuffed by time we finished.\n\nEverything tastes so good, I can't believe we ate it all! The blueberry pancakes are loaded with fruit with an option for vegan butter too if you'd like. The potatoes are done perfectly, just enough crispyness and softness inside to make them perfect, plus the herbs in them rock! My daughter ate all the vegan sausage patties, mumbling how good those were too, all in all, it was a great success, we'll definitely be back soon.\n\nKeep up the good work and thanks for offering the non-animal meals, its nice to have those options for the whole family.", "author": "Garden R."}

No contest. \n\nI've had the milkshakes and the egg scrambles and the vegan sausage and The Nebulous Potato Thing and maybe (maybe!) one time I had all of it in one sitting. Maybe. What can I say? I live abroad, so when I get back in town I hoover everything I know I can't get across the Atlantic - like pancakes and decent avocados. \n\nThere's often a wait to sit, but they have quite a bit of space inside and if the weather's nice, they will sit people along the side of the building right in the sun. I've never waited more than 15-20 minutes which, for brunch in San Francisco, is unheard of. \n\nThe service is friendly, and food comes out quick, and I've never felt rushed out of my booth or table.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-01-11", "description": "Now I see what all the hype is about... this place is top-notch! \n\nI'm surprised that I have never come here, as I've had it on my list of bookmarks for quite some time, and so many of my friends are fans. I guess I'm just never in that neighborhood, so a few of us East Bay/ Contra Costa County folks hopped in a car and drove to the city specifically to grab their grub.\n\nSurprisingly, we were able to get seated right away. I think we must have just beat the morning rush, since we did leave Walnut Creek at around 10:30 in the morning. A quick drive over the bridge, and we made it to our destination. \n\nFirst impression: cute, old-school diner atmosphere. Cozy wooden booths. Hustling and bustling, the place packed full of customers, which is usually a good sign. \n\nTheir coffee is delicious, a mild and tasty brew, and they have soy milk for your dairy-free needs. This started off our meal on a high note, as we ordered 4 coffees and scanned the menu, our little vegan hearts pounding with excitement. \n\n\nThere are plentiful vegan and vegetarian options for both breakfast and lunch, so we took our time reading over the menu. Everything looked and tasted spectacular!!! We ooh'ed and ahh'ed when the food was brought over, as our dishes were quite aesthetically appealing, especially for diner food.  \n\nRosanne P. opted for the Devil's Burger (actually not a burger, but thinly sliced seitan), Richard A. got the Vegan Breakfast Burrito, and Laura C. ordered a killer tofu scramble with spinach and mushrooms. \n\nI was going to get the Vegan Rancheros, but they didn't have vegan cheese, so the waitress suggested getting The Vegan Thing instead (\"pile of spuds with vegan jack cheese, fresh salsa, guacamole, and green onions\") with added vegan chorizo instead of cheese. Great tip! It was everything a great breakfast should be: starchy, spicy, sweet and savory. The potatoes were cooked so that one side was a little well done crunchy (but not burnt). I thought that really elevated the dish. Even the guac had a good flavor; not sure if it is housemade, but it sure tasted like it was. The chorizo was mighty spicy and set my mouth on fire... I loved every second of it. It hurt so good! \n\nI tried a bite of Rosie's sandwich... that seitan is phenomenal! It almost had a roast beef, pastrami-esque texture and flavor, without being as overpoweringly salty as its meaty counterpart. I've never seen seitan sliced so thin. I would love to order this on my next visit, as it comes with a heaping side of fries if you so choose. It looks fantastic, especially when you choose to add grilled onions and avocado on top. \n\nWe each must have had at least 2-3 cups of coffee, as they were quick to come by with a fresh pot to give us a warm-up. I really appreciated that! The staff is excellent, very attentive and well-mannered, especially for a Sunday morning (when I know my demeanor can be a little bit cranky). Diane was our main waitress, and she seemed quite knowledgeable about the menu. I hope we weren't bothering her with our demands (more soy milk, please/ a side of jam for my toast, thank you). \n\nWould I return? Abso-friggin-lutely! This is probably my new favorite brunch joint in all of San Francisco. I left there feeling very full and yet energized, ready to take on the world!...  or at least Rainbow Grocery right down the street.", "author": "Brandi W."}

I told the server very politely, thinking I'm just order scrambled instead, but he very rudely tells me that they can't make eggs two different ways, that I can't order over medium eggs when I want them over easy (I didn't, btw. Over easy and over medium are 2 very different things), and he tells me that they can't make me anymore eggs! An hour wasted, somehow it still cost us $38. So rude!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2015-12-20", "description": "I sought this place out on a recent visit to San Francisco (September 2015). We walked quite a distance to get here from where we were staying. My partner and I arrived just after 2:00 on a weekday and didn't realize until we arrived that they actually close at 3:00pm. As a rule, I generally do not stay to dine at a restaurant if I arrive less than an hour before closing, but since we only wanted to grab a soda/shake/ice cream treat we figured we could be out in less than an hour. \n\nWhen we walked in we got glared at and I can only assume this was because of the time - but it was literally not even 2:15 yet. We were off to an awkward start. There were two people standing behind the counter, but to use the word \"working\" would be a stretch. We sat at the counter and as the kid handed us the menus, he warned \"we close a 3\". Not the friendliest greeting. I assured him we only wanted ice cream so we would be quick. \n\nThere were two other people at the counter who were already eating so we were the only two people in the place that required service, but the server never came back to ask if we had questions. It felt like he was hoping we would go away if he didn't approach us... and we nearly did. It was only the fact that it was such a long hike to get there that kept us determined to order something. He pulled the fence across the front windows while we were trying to figure out the difference between shakes and sodas, etc even though at that point it wasn't yet 2:30pm. \n\nWe finally had to call him back to us. I asked a question about one of the ice cream items and he seemed like he couldn't be bothered. He prepared our order and brought it to us with 25 mins to spare till closing. The ice cream itself was good, although I think it had been a bit over-hyped and not necessarily detour-worthy on our course. Halfway through our shakes / ice cream, he came back and gave us the tumblers with the remaining third of our treats as if it was an afterthought to offer it to us. At other restaurants, my experience has been that you get what remains in the metal tumbler along with your poured shake, but it was weird, as if he was doing us a favor. \n\nAt one point we were trying to wrap up and get the bill (still before closing time) but couldn't get the attention of the server who again couldn't be bothered. We were also hoping to get the glass of water we had asked for when we placed our order. At one point, a guy who had been eating at the counter a few seats down from us walked behind the counter and standing directly in front of us AND facing us at the counter he filled himself a glass of water. My partner politely asked if we could have a glass of water to which he replied, \"Yeah\", we thanked him and his response was, \"I'm actually on break\" like he wanted us to know he was doing us a favor filling a glass of water for us while he was on his break 30 mins before they closed. \n\nThe entire experience was so off-putting and rude. They truly made us feel like we had wronged them in some way when all we could honestly think of was that they were mad that it was 2:00pm and we were going to make them do something during their last hour. We finally got the original server's attention by signaling to him during a break in his casual conversation with his friends at the counter. We asked for the check and he seemed so disgusted to have to prepare and give us the bill that we wanted to leave without asking for it just to avoid one more unnecessarily awkward interaction with the staff. \n\nWe paid the bill and heard them yell something as we walked out the door. We don't know what they yelled, but I will guess it wasn't \"have a nice day\". The customer service was non-existent and they seemed like our presence and request for two simple ice creams and a cup of water was beyond comprehension. All of this being said, we were out the door before 3:00pm, so it was NOT because we had over-stayed our welcome. Very disappointing, uncomfortable, a very strange experience.... and now after reading these Yelp reviews, I see that we are not alone in being treated this way by the staff. These little turds do not deserve jobs until they learn some basic human decency. Grow up, kids.", "author": "Lisa P."}

Be sure to stir so the malt is distributed evenly throughout the shake.\n\nOverall: \nI would rate this place 4.5 stars. I honestly can't complain about this place. The music was pleasing, the service was quick, and food was delicious. Their menu was had a wide variety from their breakfast menu to their authentic shakes. Meals ranged from the high $5-10 range and well worth it. Whenever I'm back in town and in need for that old school American feel, this will be the place to be.", "author": "Leland S."}

He looked at me and replied \"I'm not a waiter.\" I apologized and asked if he could please let my server know I was ready. He then replied \"No.\" I asked \"seriously?! Are you kidding?\" And he replied \"No.\" I was appalled! Later my waiter came (15 minutes later) and I was livid, I mentioned my interaction with his employee and he said \"oh, he is just busy. He is making sundaes and running around. He didn't mean to be mean. If you don't want to be here then I understand (and starts to take my menu).\" Seriously? I was floored. There is no justifying the poor attitude the sundae maker had towards me. The fact that my server tried to excuse it was a slap in the face. \n\nShortly after this, one of the other employees pulls his coworker to the side and they start talking about me (it's so obvious!) and they both look my direction and quickly look the other way when they see I am aware of what's happening. \n\nUnreal.

The dot-com boom and subsequent gentrification were responsible for the development of its \"micro-culture\". It has its own distinct identity and is pretty diverse in its own right. This translates into the diversification of eateries and drinking spots as well.\n\nOn one end of the spectrum, there are of course the taquerias which are the equivalent of Starbucks: there's one in every corner. Then there are the fine dining establishments that have put The Mission on the map as the center of the foodie revolution. On the other end are the dive bars, the late night hotdog vendors, the liquor store delis... \n\nAnd then there's St. Francis Fountain. \n\nThis retro-diner sticks out like a sore thumb in the predominantly Latin-inspired stretch that is 24th Street, Mission. \n\nAs soon as you enter the place, you are transported back in time. Once an ice cream parlor/candy store, they still retain some of their merchandise in glass display cases (for display only). From Gobstoppers to Mork & Mindy collectible cards with bubble gum to Pez dispensers and a bucket of Bazooka Joe. Give that section a quick gander and you will literally feel like a kid in a candy store. \n\nThe food is nothing to be excited about. All standard breakfast fare. They do have a good selection of Mitchell's ice cream and I feel obligated to order a milkshake the next time I'm here because let's face it, that's what 10 year old me would do. \n\nThe novelty of having an ice cream parlor around the corner from where I live that serves breakfast while reminding me what it was like to be a kid is definitely enough to rank this among one of my favorite places to go to in The Mission. \n\n4.6 stars", "author": "Angelo B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-02-19", "description": "St. Francis Fountain is one of those places I've been meaning to go to for the longest time, but for whatever reason, just haven't. \n\nThis past week, that finally changed. After striking out at Golden Era (closed on a Tuesday?!) and Weird Fish (closed for a private party?!), we decided on St. Francis. Since it was a week night, there were a ton of empty tables, which was a nice welcome compared to the last time I tried to eat there (a weekend morning) when we were told our wait would be an hour or two. \n\nWhen we walked in we were told to sit wherever we pleased. So we sat at a nice table in the back. \"Oh wait, not that one, in case a party of more than four comes in\" is what we were told. Oh, okay. So we moved to another table. No big deal, although no larger party did come in during our time there (about an hour before closing).\n\nI get the menu and I'm stoked to see all the vegan options. A bit later our drink orders are taken. A friend gets a Diet Coke. Another gets a Vanilla Coke. I hold off because I'm eyeing the soy milkshakes.\n\nServer comes a bit later. A friend orders first. She wants one of the Things (not certain if she orders the Vegan one or the Nebulous Potato one). Only catch, she wants black beans instead of homefries. We are told that the chef will refuse to make it this way, because the homefries are important for the \"structural integrity\" of the dish. OK fine. So she orders something else.\n\nI am torn between a few items, so I decide to ask some questions. \n\nSince the Chorizo and Eggs is calling out my name, I think that maybe I'll get that with tofu instead of eggs, even though that substitution costs an extra dollar or two. So I ask if they have vegan sour cream. The answer of which is no. \n\nThis is surprising to me, because they have vegan cheese and vegan other things. Additionally, anyone who KNOWS breakfast knows that sour cream is an important component in the \"structural integrity\" of potatoes. So why they cater to the vegan crowd on almost everything else but sour cream is baffling, but again, fine.\n\nInstead, I decide to get the Vegan Thing. I really want black beans instead of homefries, but I'd rather have vegan cheese than no sour cream. I need some kind of fake dairy to satiate my hunger.\n\nAlongside this, I order that shake I've been lusting after since the second we walked in.\n\nMoments later, our server returns to inform me that they're out of soy for the shakes. Insert sad face here. Instead, I decide to get a vanilla coke as well, since I've just tasted my companion's and it's quite good. Server goes to get it and returns shortly, saying they just ran out of vanilla coke - in fact, my friend got the last one. Which is annoying because not only are they out of it, but I'd also assumed that a diner like SFF would make their own - you know, regular coke with vanilla infusion. I mean, even Denny's does this on their own. But oh well, I settle for a diet vanilla coke, which is just fine in my book.\n\nSo we're sitting and chatting and waiting for our food when our server returns again to inform me that the chef has just begun making my meal and realizes that they're out of vegan cheese. Uh what?\n\nBegrudgingly, I settle on the Vegan Chorizo Hash & Tofu instead. Which is twice-removed from the meal I really wanted, but whatever, I'm starving.\n\nA minute or two passes and he comes out with my friends' meals. Mine doesn't come out for another 10 or so. So by the time they've finished their meals, I'm less than halfway through. As their plates are being cleared, I just ask for a to-go box, because we have some place we need to get to, and my food just isn't that good anyway.\n\nThe check comes, and my coke is comped. That's all. While I'm not expecting handouts, and I don't blame anyone for my subpar dining experience, it was still super disappointing that my entire time there felt more like a hassle than a pleasure. And while any singular instance of what happened wouldn't have bothered me, the fact that so many things went wrong, one after another, was discouraging.\n\nI don't know - call me a cynic, or an asshole, but if a menu boasts having lots of vegan options, I'd think that actually having those vegan ingredients on hand would be important to the \"structural integrity\" of its claim.", "author": "Natalye R."}

In lieu of toast, you have your choice of English muffin, homemade biscuits, cornbread, or banana bread. Of course, I choose the homemade biscuit. \n\nCoffee served in one of those classic style cups and handwritten bills make this place even cooler. \n\nMy scramble was delicious. Lots of avocado, and a fresh cilantro salsa, all within the eggs. Biscuits were warm and soft, and the homefries were crispy enough and not too oily.

St Francis Fountain is definitely a great place to visit when in San Francisco because this is where the locals /natives eat!\nTheir menu is pretty big and has a lot of great choices for breakfast, lunch and dinner and many\ndelicious fountain favorites!

Hey, at least I tried. \n\nOK, Back to Basics...\n\nFounded in 1918, St. Francis Fountain operated as a candy store and ice cream parlor. 10 years ago, the current owners installed a kitchen turning St. Francis Fountain into a greasy spoon diner while keep the nostalgia of the early 1900s ice cream parlor with swirly retro stools. Serving breakfast ALL day, St. Francis Fountain has an extensive all-American breakfast menu with weekend specials (5 eggs benedict variations), a nice vegan selection, and $4 mimosas! They also have soups, salads, sandwiches and burgers on the menu. Don't forget to stop by their candy counter to revive the fat kid in you (mines never left) with Pop Rocks, Necco Wafers, Ring Pops and Sugar Daddys. \n\nSince Mr. NSS loves breakfast food, I thought St. Francis Fountain would be a great place to bring him. Do expect a wait on the weekends. On a Sunday afternoon at 2:30 PM, there was still a 10-15 minute wait. On the bright side, parking is much easier in this part of The Mission and Humphry Slocombe Ice Cream is just several blocks away.\n\nWhile enjoying the 80s and 90s throwbacks playing in the background, Mr. NSS had the Chef's Mess ($10) which was an artery-clogging behemoth of a thing in a bowl. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Zx_VDLeaFdnMFkGyorDZtQ?select=8-4ip_RG5nlesdN-19dNog#8-4ip_RG5nlesdN-19dNog Crispy homefries with scrambled eggs, bacon, and mushrooms topped with melted cheese, tomatoes & sour cream.

The sausage gave a rich porky bite while the spinach was added just to make me feel better from the cholesterol-filled dish. Umm, at least it was Atkins-friendly (I didn't eat the bread)? =X\n\nService was friendly enough and drink refills were promptly made. This is very much a hipster place so make sure to come with your skinny jeans, fedora, and black-rimmed glasses. \n\nAfter several FAILED attempts of trying to \"refine\" Mr. NSS, I've come to terms that guys like and appreciate simplicity.

St. Francis Fountain just happened to be the pick of the day. And what a good choice it was...\n\nOld school 50's style dining brought to you by Mission Hipsters. I had read reviews that stated the servers here are aloof or dirty. I found the opposite to be true for the most part. Our coffee and water never got empty without being refilled. The food came out to the table lightning quick as well. \n\nThe only mishap was when our waitress was a bit... ok, very confused while taking our order. Vegan Blueberry Pancakes were repeated back to us twice with \"Buttermilk Pancakes\". So once that confusion was solved our order came out extremely fast to the point were we thought it wasn't ours. So what did we get instead of Vegan Blueberry Pancakes? That's right, a Vegan Breakfast Burrito... Huh? It turned out to be a good thing since they asked if we would like to keep the burrito while they would whip up the correct pancake order. Free food? Score!\n\nThe Tofu Scramble with Ranchero was delicious even though it appeared to be undercooked and not very scrambled. Since I don't eat with my eyes I dove into the flavors of all the Ranchero sauce mixed with the tofu, mushrooms and green onions. One of the better tasting scrambles I've had in awhile. Coupled with a generous portion of tasty spuds along with a few slices of toast, this is a huge shareable dish.  \n\nThose Vegan Blueberry Pancakes that took some haggling to get weren't too bad. I like blueberries as much as anyone but I think they went a little buck wild with the blueberry scooper. The entire center was blueberries. They were good, not great. I would probably get one of the other Vegan options next time.\n\nThat free Vegan Breakfast Burrito plate was something I would consider ordering next visit. The black beans on the side had a bit of a chili kick to them. Very tasty. The filling was consisted mostly of a Vegan jack cheese. Not sure what they use but it was a change of pace from the usual burrito. \n\nA pretty cool atmosphere along with all the great Vegan options makes this a place you should check out at least once to see if it's for you.", "author": "John B."}

Whaaaaaat. And then the straws--while being super cute, old school-style red and white swirl straws--lose their integrity in fairly short order and basically dissolve and stop transporting shake from glass to mouth. Paper straws: probably better for the environment, but freaking impossible to use to drink a thick shake.\n\nThe hipster quotient here is painfully high. I'm always turn between rolling up my sleeves so that they'll see my tattoos--you know, waving my feathers and strutting and clucking and whatever to show that I'm not afraid of them--or deliberately disguising anything about myself that doesn't look hella yuppie so that they will be forced to deal with this odious outsider among them. Alternately, in my surly hungover state, I want to shake both waitstaff and patrons and scream \"Why do you deliberately wear outfits that clash and fit you in unflattering ways so that you are actively making yourself uglier? WHYYYYYYY?\" However, I can tolerate absurdly high levels of hipsterdom in exchange for tasty brunch and hangover amelioration.\n\nSo, on the one hand, the food is awesome and the shop is super cute. On the other hand, your hangover might elevate from unpleasant to genuinely nauseous based on some of the things people there wear.\n\nI guess I'm just getting old.

The place had good reviews so we gave it a try.  First off, the staff was friendly and we were seated immediately at the counter.  I had the mac 'n cheese with strawberry milkshake.  Forgot what the boyfriend ordered.  Felt that the mac 'n cheese lacked creaminess and the full bodied cheesy flavor I was looking for.  Too dry - 1 star.  The strawberry milkshake - now, that one I left with wanting more but had to fight with myself to resist ordering another one - 5 stars.  \n\nThe level of cleanliness was something I was not pleased with.

I have yet to try anything bad at this restaurant.  In order to be thorough they also have soups, salads and some vegetarian items on the menu that I have never tried.\n\nOn my most recent visit I ordered one of my menu favorites, the Chef's Mess (pictured).  This is an egg scrambler that combines their homefries, bacon pieces and sliced mushrooms.  Cheddar and jack cheese are melted on top of the scrambler then diced tomatoes, a dollop of sour cream and chopped green onions finish the dish.  Your choice of toast comes with this selection.\n\nOn my second most recent visit I had the Hamburger with Bacon and Cheddar (also pictured).  All of their burgers are cooked medium well unless of course you ask otherwise, and these are thick, lean, beefy patties.  The menu states that they are 6 oz. patties.  The base burger comes with shredded lettuce, sliced tomato, a few thin strings of red onion and a couple of pickle chips.  The burger had a thick slice of cheddar melted on top of the patty along with two thick strips of crispy bacon that I had to crumble in half in order to make it fit.  The price is on the steeper side, but the burger is delicious.\n\nBurgers and sandwiches come with French Fries on the side.  I like how they are fried up crispy with the skin intact.  If you are not into the fried potatoes however, there are several other sides you can choose from including salad, soup, chili, mac and cheese or fruit.\n\nThey serve Mitchell's ice cream at St. Francis Fountain with about a dozen flavors.  I don't let my lactose intolerance bother me ever.  I carry Lactaid tablets with me at all times, and I enjoy ordering ice cream items.  My favorite flavor combination has always been vanilla ice cream with orange sherbet.  That's right the Dreamsicle combo.  Perhaps that is why I love the Dream Shake (pictured) so much.\n\nI sit at the counter most of the time because I enjoy watching the waitress make my shake with a light pour of whole milk, a shot of Torani vanilla syrup, orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream.  One of the waitresses with short dark hair makes a real kick ass milkshake.  Sorry but I always forget to ask her name.  She leaves the shake on the mixer for a super long time and the result is a shake so thick the long metal spoon will stand up in the middle of the glass for a good half hour after the shake has been made.  Don't ask why, but I tried it once (the spoon caper, that is).\n\nThe service is usually pretty good as the wait staff are really cool.\n\nAlthough I have a long time to go before I can exercise the ten percent senior discount here I'm hopeful that San Francisco's oldest ice cream parlor will still be here serving up a great menu and delicious ice cream treats.", "author": "Wilhelm Y."}

Though it's not my partner's favorite---but I'm a lot more down to earth and more food-obsessed. It's total diner food---excellent menu creations of potatoes, cheese, bacon, and sour cream. Big portions. I usually can't decide between the Chef's Mess and the Nebulous Potato Thing. But if you go, you MUST THING YOUR SPUDS, it just makes everything even more delicious. There is usually a wait on weekends, but it's totally worth it. I've also come here on evenings and had a milkshake and those are quite delicious as well. Very fun, diner, hipster vibe.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-06-14", "description": "Established in 1918, the St. Francis Fountain has been serving the Mission District over three generations until an ownership change in 2002 which was initially intended to inspire community renewal that later became consumed by the larger gentrification project. According to a local source, they used to make their own ice cream but had since resorted to using Mitchells' most conventional lines of flavors. I came here to meet fellow Yelp buddy Tom R on a sunny sweltering afternoon and was able to grab a quick ice cream sundae to get an impression of this place.\n\nIn spite ongoing efforts to shift its focus from an old fashioned confectionary towards a modern diner that serves Missions' growing numbers of hipsters and young professionals, the venue still embodied the retro charms that preceded the contemporaries in the area. There was the candy counter situated by the entrance followed by rows of wooden booths juxtaposed by a lengthy dinette counter and red topped stools which were raised from the floor and spread across the middle of the diner. We were seated towards the back at the counter and I was treated to a Black & White Sundae ($6). It came with big scoops of Mitchells chocolate and vanilla ice cream layered with melted marshmallow sauce, chocolate sauce, whipped ice cream and peanuts. The concept was nothing path-breaking as I had a chance to observe how the sundae was prepared, but thanks to Mitchells the double scoops of ice cream were outstanding despite a lack of twisted imagination of Humphry Slocombe and other confectionaries in the area.\n\nPersonalized service and developing a sense of belonging for customers are two essential qualities that historically have defined what a good diner is all about. The quality of service was a major disappointment as I was ignored at the doorstep for a good 10 minutes until Tom showed up. Without hesitation, the server flocked to him instantaneously to offer seating and if we weren't together I would have been invisible and completely dismissed. Poor service didn't stop there as the server offered to settle our bill as soon as we were finished with our snack. There was little consideration about making this place communal and friendly to hang out, and the attitude of the servers were unresponsive and ignorant about the restaurant business. Overall, my experience was marked by a pretty decent ice cream sundae with an original ambiance and d\u00e9cor. Since service was unresponsive and stink-face offensive, I must admit that I will not be coming back unless they hire a counter staff that is capable of communicating and relating to individuals from various backgrounds, and one that reflects the demographics of the local community at hand.", "author": "Daniel L."}

We eyed St. Francis Fountain earlier in the week and made plans to give it a try.  We found metered parking right in front of the restaurant.\n\nThe place had a nostalgic diner look with a long counter and wooden booths (with old fashioned coat/hat hooks).  We immediately opted for a booth.  Being a larger man, my husband found the booth more than a little snug.  I found that while charming in a vintage way, the wooden booths were a little uncomfortable (the 90 degree angle made one practice good posture) and the torn leatherette seats could have used some refurbishing.  \n\nMenus were retro in style, though I felt selections were a bit pricey.  We ordered a NY Reuben sandwich (w/choice of 1 side) and Turkey Club, each was 9.25.  My husband also ordered a large malt.  Food was delivered quickly enough but without the malt.  Sandwiches were okay, I thought both could have used more meat.  My husband loved his reuben sandwich.  When he asked about the shake, our waitress replied it was not ready yet (I thought it was forgotten).  It was delivered halfway into the meal and presented with two cute red/white waxed paper straws in a heavy milkshake glass.  I forgave our busy waitress as the malt was definitely worth the wait.  It had a subtle malt/vanilla taste and was very smooth and creamy.  \n\nThough I'm on the fence about St. Francis Fountain, if I do return I'll probably select something from the soda fountain as the malt was delicious. My husband, on the other hand, would return tomorrow.  He enjoyed everything about the place.  I think 4 stars is a good compromise.", "author": "A O."}

Well, I had the \"Veggie Mess\" and it had soooo much cheese on it plus a pile of sour cream, I wasn't quite expecting that.  It was good once I attempted a little cheese removal.  \n\nReason #2 for a 3 star rating:  They have a second room for seating that was completely open (only 3 tables sat in there) and yet there was  a wait list.  I get it if they are short staffed but that didn't seem to be the case.  Either way, the wait was only about 10 minutes but it just seemed odd.\n\nReason #3.  I get that its a place that employ's the hipsters... goes with the whole Mission Schtick... but I have a problem when dudes that are serving food are wearing tank tops.  I have only witnessed such behavior in places like Springfield Missouri where I was surprised they were wearing shirts at all.  But here in SF, I figured even the hipsters would realize I don't want to see an eyeful of armpit hair as you pass a plate across the table.  Also, one of the other servers was wearing his pants way low on his ass so most of his boxer briefs were showing and they did not appear to be brand new.  \n\nSo Reason #3 is the main reason for the 3 star rating.....

Awesome! Our server was super busy so he didn't refill our waters until we asked but more importantly, our food came out hot and in a timely fashion. As usual, there was the dilemma of sweet or savory? We opted to share one of each so it worked out perfectly!\n\nSavory:\n3 egg white omelette with spinach, mushrooms, and jack cheese ($9.50 plus $1.50 to sub for egg whites) - $11 was worth all the food we got! The omelette tasted amazing...the spinach and mushrooms were on top of the eggs and the cheese was melted inside. A different approach but SO good! The home fries with a drizzle of tabasco sauce was heaven...thick crispy layer on the outside (the way I like it) and didn't need salt or pepper. And to top if off, the corn bread was TO DIE FOR! It was fresh and crumbly with a crunchy crust...not dry at all either.

I have something to say: \n\nStop being dicks. \n\nI have given you six chances -- six!! -- since moving to your neck of the woods. And the sh*tty part is I REALLY like your food. But my god, your service is abysmal. Why would I go to you and be treated like a herpes outbreak when I can go to any of the restaurants next door and be treated like ... well ... like a patron? \n\nIn fact, I'm curious as to your hiring process. I'm guessing the hiring manager is a friend of the wait staff, right?Because I was in restaurant management for 15 years and I can not, for the life of me, figure out who looked at the current St. Francis crew, compared them to the rest of the potential candidates in San Francisco and said \"Yes. This is the best of the best. These are the people I want to be the face of St. Francis and everything we stand for. This is the right decision.\"\n\nIt doesn't make sense any other way. \n\nSo what was the straw that broke the camel's back, you ask? When we had friends from Portland in town who wanted to try you out. I told them it wasn't a good idea, but hey, it wasn't busy and we were hungry so we figured, what the hell? It can't be bad when it's not busy, right? \n\nWrong. \n\nYou seated us in the new addition, which was awesome. And you were kinda-sorta friendly, which made me think you were going to change my opinion of St. Francis' staff. But then everything unraveled. You forgot about us until I tracked you down and asked if we could order. You brought each of our meals at different times. You forgot one of our orders completely. You also forgot a milkshake, then tried to give it to me when I was paying the bill, then looked confused when I said we no longer wanted it. And I think you might have charged me for it, had I not taken care of the matter myself. \n\nBut you know what? I still tipped you 20%. Because it's not your fault that someone thinks you're great as the face of St. Francis. It's the hiring manager's fault. \n\nAnd to that guy/girl, whomever you are, I have one last thing to say: Quit hiring people based on their super-duper-hip haircuts and skinny jeans and start hiring based on competency levels. Because I still really like your food (hence the extra star), and would really like to come back someday.

I consider myself a pretty regular sized asian girl and I fit just right in the booth. It may be uncomfortable if you are a larger sized person!\n-The food takes a while. And service is also slow. My waiter was pretty nice but he kept forgetting or mixing up things we asked. For example, we asked him to put our shakes in to-go cups but they came in glasses. I asked for jam but he never got around to bringing it. I wanted a vanilla shake but he kept asking me what flavor I want to put in it, and I ended up with a rocky road shake. \n-Ugh the STRAWS! I love the planet. I love being green but for goodness sake's, the straws are made of paper and mine pretty much flattened and wilted to a deflated wet newspaper texture after a few sips of my shake. How do I enjoy the delicious shake if it refuses to be sipped through the straw?\n-They did not have tabasco. Only tapatio... \n\nThese things aside, the food was satisfying and ingredients fresh.  It's not at the top of my list of favorite lunch spots in the mission, but it's definitely a unique hiptastic diner! \n\n3.5 stars!", "author": "Gloria C."}

I work in the area, so of course I love that St. Francis is there for all times of the day. I've had the omelets for breakfast when I'm a bit early for work, call in for the takeout lunch of the sampler (side salad, cup of mac and cheese, and cup of chili for $8), and have nothin but great things to say about their burgers.\n\nBut. Today. I took a man friend here for late breakfast/lunch, and we couldn't decide what to order. I finally chose the French toast with yogurt, granola, and fruit with a side of bacon - it comes to me heaping and plentiful, takes up the whole plate, and a drizzle syrup starts my eating game, all for $10. My dining partner wasn't so lucky. He didn't like some of the breakfast burrito options, so decided to add some extras - bacon, cilantro, avocado, potatoes - to a burrito that was listed on the menu.\n\nMy dish was tasty. So was his. But imagine our surprise when the bill comes and his breakfast burrito  - modified, sure, to add some extras - is fucking TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. I'm sorry, why? Because our smart (I'm obviously being ironic) server added all of the extras for the breakfast burrito a la carte. Here's the thing - we were more than willing to build the burrito on its own, but $25 fucking dollars for one? It was a dick move for the server to charge it all separately, especially since each item wasn't in full on the side and was mixed ultimately for the burrito. Of course, we don't realize this until my credit card is charged, and I had to get back to work.\n\nDear server at St. Francis: if you're seeing that someone's BURRITO is totaling $25, don't be an ass and bring it to their attention. You can also mod that shit in Aloha. Play fair.", "author": "Jenz y."}

I called ahead, was disconnected but didn't give up, I called back.  A nice female took my order and  I requested an itemized bill, so I could collect money from my co-worker. I also ordered a milkshake, but did not indicate the size, small or large, just a milkshake.\n\nUpon arriving, I saw my ready order sitting sideways on the counter.  I waited patiently while several individuals paid and left and several more were waited upon.  Finally, I said, \"My food is to go and it's right there - UPSIDE DOWN...\" The wait attendant appeared irritated, I asked about my milkshake, he said it was coming and proceeded to attend to another patron who had ordered a milkshake in a cup that appeared to be a 16 oz cup.  My mouth watered with excitement as I anticipated my milkshake in a 16 oz cup, as well.  Much to my chagrin, my milkshake was half the size.  I mentioned to the waiter, I did not order a small. HE replied, \"Yes, you did I took your order.\"   I thought \"Wow, I know I was talking to a female.\"    Extra stars deducted b/c when I went back to office, found out he overcharged me than when you compare it to the menu, not a huge amount but just the principal, it looks like he was just coming up with the figures as he rang me up (even though I called ahead of time, asking for the amount).  Also, I didn't get any utensils with my order to eat the dish.\n\nLong story short, I did not feel welcome.

The Reuben is a great sandwich, and they have great hand-cut fries. They have vanilla and cherry syrup to add to sodas, and they have lots of vegetarian/vegan options. This provides flexibility when you have friends with restrictions. \n- The location is great. It's a 10-15 minute walk from my house, but you're in the middle of the 24th street corridor. \n- The place is a landmark, been in existence since 1920 or something. The decor is very old-timey and true to its original form and purpose. \n\nOverall, I think these are the ingredients for a solid experience.\n\nBut there are some bad things: \n- The crowd and waiters are too cool for school. Oh my goodness, the entire place is filled with ironic hipsters. \n- The prices are kind of high for diner food. $6 for a milkshake is a bit much. \n- To get very nitpicky: GET RID OF THOSE ANNOYING STRAWS. They have paper straws, perhaps in an attempt to seem authentic and \"green.\" Authenticity I don't give one whit about, and for \"green\"ness just buy normal compostable straws. I go through 2-3 of those dumb paper straws in a meal, and it's annoying as heck. \n- I don't think they do a very good job of clearing out tables or getting new folks in tables on the weekend. There can be 15 people waiting for a table, with three tables empty and three yet to have the previous occupants' dishes cleared. \n\nOverall, I really do like this place.

My family is from NYC, but I grew up throughout the country. Wherever I lived I would seek out the best diner and call it my culinary home. In Boston, it was S&S in Inman Square. In NYC, it was too many to choose from (paradise!). In Santa Fe, it was the Plaza Cafe. \n\nSo, when I moved to San Francisco last year and discovered I lived a block away from a diner people raved about, I got nervous. \"What if it totally sucks? What if the place I like is miles away at the end of some trolley car, or whatever they drive here, line?\" \n\nTo be honest, my worries were not quelled when I saw the hipster crowds hanging outside. My experience is that the \"scene\" spots in life are not always the best eating. And why should they be? If a scene is what people want to pay for, give them the scene (and cut your expenses on those gourmet cheeses).  \n\nBy the time I had my first meal at St. Francis, a BLT and a cup of chicken soup, I was prepared for the worse.  But from the minute I stepped inside to my last slurp of chocolate milkshake, my fears were replaced by admiration for the quality, care and charm of this singular, homestyle, \"write home about\" worthy establishment. \nHere's why St. Francis excels, in particular: \n\n1. They have all the diner standards, but they use fresh ingredients and prepare the food with care. The flavors are clear, well balanced, and I find the dishes to be as rich, salty and cheesy as you want them to be, but they go easy on the grease. \n2. The staff is fresh, young and beautiful (ok, put up your hipster shields), but they are also sincere, kind and attentive (put your shields down). \n3. They don't rush you. If they are not busy you are free to leisurely finish your meandering conversation about the New Yorker article you and your friend both skimmed but have strong opinions about. \n4. Going alone feels great, even without a book. If you're a freelancer like me, this is a useful bonus. It's not Cheers where everyone comes rushing over and gives you a hug, but you will be looked in the eye, treated with respect and served amazing food. \n\nI wish I could recommend lots of menu items, but I'm now stuck in the most satisfying ordering rut, the veggie reuben with spinach salad and a chocolate milkshake. They also make great hamburgers.\n\nThe things I've had that were ho hum (no bad, just meh), were the macaroni and cheese and the hot fudge sundae.

Here exists a place where you can step out of everyday, busy life in 2010 and set foot into a 1950's time-warp.  If there was a television in this place, I would have expected to see a black and white episode of \"I Love Lucy\" playing in the background.  From what I understand, this establishment was already old-school by the 1950's, and actually is closer to 100 years old!  \n\nIt doesn't take much more than that to get me excited about \"hip\" little diners like this; you already have a pretty clear idea of what is being served up at the St. Francis: Breakfast, Burgers, Coffee - Oh, and a selection of Mitchell's Ice Cream, so Milkshakes, Banana Splits and Hot Fudge Sundaes (if that's what you want for lunch!).  I went with the Turkey Bacon Club on Sliced Sourdough with Cheddar and a Caesar Salad...not one bit disappointed by my decision at all.  \n\nSurprisingly the parking is pretty easy here, considering that this part of San Francisco can be a little challenging at times (and many spaces limited to 1 hour only).  Just bring a handful of change ($2/hr...wow San Francisco!), and be ready to sidestep the panhandler with the shopping cart after you feed the meter.  Really, though, it actually is a pretty nice neighborhood!\n\nAlso be prepared to \"chat it up\" with the person sitting next to you if you come alone and sit at the counter: the place fills up quick, and the \"hip-girl\" with the Oversized sunglasses (which never came off) sitting next to me wanted some conversation in addition to me passing her the sugar for her soy-infused coffee.  \n\n\"What was I doing in the neighborhood?\" was the general tone of the conversation.  \n\nJust passing through...and I will be sure to do that here again sometime soon!", "author": "Christian H."}

Ask them their opinion and tell you and not settle for the annoying \"it's all good!\" \n\nGet a milkshake. They are fantastic. My boyfriend and I shared a large (around $5.50, i think) and struggled to finish it. After a little bit of playing around, I have now found my standard, which is with strawberry ice cream and banana flavouring. The large will come in a pretty diner glass, with the leftovers in the metal tin. Basically you will never run out. \n\nThe breakfast menu is fantastic and I usually order off there. The chorizo, although fake meat, tastes really good! Breakfast burrito is solid. I have now had the burger and it's actually good. I don't know why I am surprised, but it was good. I don't even know what to tell you to order. Everything that I have had here has been good. \n\nIf it wasn't for the insane wait that you have to endure on the weekends, I could possibly make St. Francis an even more frequent stop.

Even if they're not particularly authentic, I'm usually a big believer in them.  Especially if they're kind of gross and musty and dusty and moldy.  OK, maybe not the moldy part, but really, there's not much an old place has to do to win my heart.\n\nSadly, St. Francis Fountain has failed to win my heart.\n\nYes, the neon sign is authentic, and yes, they serve breakfast, and yes, the crampedness--new word!--of the booths is both familiarly uncomfortable and an excellent reminder that Americans are fatter than they used to be, and this is remarkable considering the people who used to frequent greasy diners like this probably didn't have very much money and didn't see a doctor regularly and probably died at ridiculously young ages, but they were still thinner than us!\n\nAnyway, the first thing that annoys me is the name of the place.  It's not really called St. Francis Fountain.  It's called just St. Francis.  Maybe it was St. Francis Diner or St. Francis Restaurant or St. Francis Coffee Shop, but it's definitely not St. Francis Fountain.  Why do people call it that?  Well, it's because the largest other word on said old neon sign is \"Fountain,\" but so what?  \"Fountain\" just means they serve soda and shakes and malts.  OK, here comes one of my famous analogies.  It's like referring to regular old Safeway as Safeway Pharmacy.  Now why would someone call Safeway Safeway Pharmacy?  Well, some Safeways happen to have the word \"Pharmacy\" on their signs.  Do you call them Safeway Pharmacy?  No, so don't call St. Francis St. Francis Fountain.\n\nNow that that's all cleared up, I'm pretty underwhelmed by their breakfasts.  I either want to be wowed by a coffee-shop breakfast, or I want to be in too much of a food coma to have heard you ask me how my breakfast was.  Sadly, I was right in the middle.\n\nThe main redeeming quality of this place is that they sell ridiculous candy.  It's not old-timey candy from the era during which said problematic neon sign was made, but it's pretty old and unique.  They have some cool stuff that I haven't seen sold in stores since at least the late '80s.

This last week has been full of moving and unpacking madness, and I'm not ashamed to say that we've eaten here no less than three times. They have loads of veggie and vegan options, their milkshakes make me weak in the knees, and there's enough variety on the menu to keep trying new things and not get bored. All good things in my book. \n\nThe service has been good, though I wouldn't recommend popping in anywhere near closing time. Expect some grumbling is all I'm sayin. I also am totally pissed about the straws. Paper straws aren't cool in that once they've been in your drink for more than two or three minutes they basically stop functioning as a straw. So while I appreciate the old-timiness of the paper straw, sometimes progress is good, folks. Give in to the lure of the plastic straw.", "author": "heather c."}

I've only ever chosen to sit outside, actually (which is lovely, and the tables are far enough away from pedestrians that they still feel somehow private) so I can't speak to the indoor seating/service/ambiance...\n\n3.

But since I have yet to be disappointed by the food here (honest!), I'm willing to make some sacrifices.\n\nIt's true, dear Yelpers: I have been pleasantly surprised by (enamored of!) many a St. Francis Fountain dish, especially when it comes to breakfast. As a veg, I really appreciate the surprising amount of vegetarian/vegan-friendly options on the menu... and ones that aren't relegated to a fruit cup or a bland veggie plate, either! Several dishes are great (Toasted Vegan sandwich, Chorizo & Eggs, the oh-my-god French Toast Delight), BUT my absolutely favorite is still the \"My Chef Jess:\" 2 eggs scrambled with homefries, vegan chorizo and mushrooms, topped with melted cheese, tomato, sour cream & green onions. WITH A BAKED GOOD OF YOUR CHOICE! COME ON now, does it get any better than that?! Sure, the servers don't sprinkle goodwill and sunshine everywhere they go, but they are generally attentive enough to consistently refill water/coffee and provide some amusement (intentional or not).\n\nIf I could write a love letter to St. Francis Fountain, I surely would. \"Dear St. Francis: You are dreamy and a half.

We sat outside, and after ordering - and lovin' - the banana pancakes, we ordered a feast: B&G, black beans, breakfast burritos! It was amazing and I registered in my brain that was a fair priced, full of flavor, casual brunch spot in the middle of hipster land.\n\nSecond time, rainy Sunday post loooooong wine tasting the night before. In serious need of good confort food + coffee to balance out the headache. After trying different places with long lines, St Francis' 15 minute wait didn't seem so bad. \n\nWe were sat at the counter and I was enchanted by the old diner vibe, the 80's candy bar and the 60's music they were playing. The menu, again, made me dizzy with so many options, and we both went for the vegan chorizo - I got the chorizo and eggs, he got the chorizo hash. And, of course, the fabulous B&G!\n\nThe food took a while, but when it came it was a fabulous experience! The service was friendly and they refilled our coffee and water promptly. I saw lots of dishes that looked delicious passing by me, and thought I need to come back many times to try them all. By the end of two hours, I was happy and even my headache was gone.\n\nSt Francis is the case of appreciating something for what it is - hipster crowd, good food, casual fun vibe, and yes:  usual lines + pricey.....like EVERY good brunch place in SF.

I used to come to St. Francis all the time, way back before it turned into hipster hell. It used to welcome people from all walks of life, but apparently now it is REALLY like a diner in the 1950s - except maybe in Alabama.  I always wondered why I almost NEVER see a brown face eating here. Now I may understand why. \n\nI walked in to eat.  A customer at the counter was asking the girl to microwave the to go coffee she'd just been served because it was too cold. The girl actually said okay and microwaved it instead of making her  a new one. \n\nI stood by the door and waited. The hipster girl with the ironic mullet and mustard sweater saw me, gave me a blank stare and kept walking. She started putting away cups. She walked past me. She walked past again. She cleaned. She saw me again. She went in the back. I stood there and looked around for the \"please seat yourself\" sign. Didn't see one. I finally said, \"Excuse me - but do you see me?\" or something to that effect. She looked at me and said \"I'm sorry, I thought you were all together\" and pointed to the latino family at the counter with two kids that was leaving with their cold coffee.  I am half Mexican, so I guess she thought we always roll in packs and never solo. They'd obviously been there for some time judging by the dirty dishes in front of them. I know she saw me walk in. I know she saw me looking at her expectantly. \n\nI walked out. \n\nFrom reading the reviews here, it looks like they don't discriminate in terms of bad service. You can be white and still get treated like dirt, according to what others have said here.

I had a few bites of my meal, and enjoyed the drinks and company instead.\n\nBased on the other recommendations- I'd suggest one stick to foods that rely less on the quality of the original ingredients, and rely more upon preserved foods and spices.  This place has great ambiance, malts, and sandwiches made of meat, relishes, mustards, and bread.\n\nThe handsome and trendy staff and patrons range from my middle-aged Precita Eyes volunteer dining companions at the counter to the gaggles of 20-somethings in Valencia-styled capris and ironic t-shirts.

The turkey sandwich was on crappy bread that you get at Safeway, the turkey was clearly pre-packaged, and it just didn't look appetizing at all.  The Chef's Mess was gross.  I left at least half of it on my plate.  That partially could've been my fault, ordering something so heavy.   \n\nThe shake and malt were way too watery and the cheese fries, which we had ordered with bacon were no bueno.  They didn't get that we wanted bacon bits on the cheese fries, so they brought us a plate of bacon??!! What??? The fries were soggy and not seasoned well.

Not great, but pretty reliable.\n\nWent in for breakfast on a Saturday morning, noticed menu had changed a bit, prices went up.  More Vegan options for those who care - I do not.  However, I did order the vegan choriso and 2-egg scramble, wanting something a little lighter and also subbed out a side salad for the potatoes and toast.  Something St. Francis has had no problem doing for me in the past.\n\nBreakfast comes to the table and the salad out of the bag that they gave me was brown and rotten, covered in dressing.  The waiter never came back to check and after waiving down the busser had it sent back, explaining it was brown and rotten and asked for a new one.  After 15 minutes and some confusion on the staff's part my salad comes back to the table.  More brown.  More rotten than before.\n\nI finished my breakfast, went to pay the bill and mentioned to the waiter that my salad, again, was brown and rotten.  I was told that that's all they have right now.  i said, \"well why didn't you level with me and tell me that and offer me something else rather than serving me rotten food twice?\"  Then the waiter said that there was nothing wrong with the salad after telling me loudly that I needed to \"calm down.\"  I had the manager come out, walked over to my table, picked up the plate of salad and showed in to them and said, \"I'm sorry, would you eat this?\"  The manager shook his head no and the waiter said that he would eat it and that he saw nothing wrong with it.\n\nIt was a joke.  I'm not talking about a little brown around the edges - I'm talking about slimy, brown and rotten- old.\n\nI punished them by getting out of there as fast as I could and leaving a $20 dollar bill.  Meaning I tipped about 25% and paid $10.50 for 2 scrambled eggs for my breakfast.\n\nHow hard would it have been to say, \"I'm sorry, I wasn't paying attention, we're not ready for salad service.\"  Or \"How can I make you happy?\" or \"Please don't call the health department.\"?\n\nTheir food is totally unremarkable, except the Guiness float, and their service makes me want to throw a flaming brick through the window.

I'm just amazed that the owner continue to employ people like this in the age of Yelp. Here's the deal:\n\nI'm new to the neighborhood and went in for ice cream on Tuesday, Sep 15 at about 4:15PM. The store was empty, except for a foursome sharing a booth and two employees - a man and woman - behind the counter.\n\n\"Cup, or cone?\" the girl asked.\n\nAfter paying approx $4.50 for a double scoop cone, I proceeded to enjoy it at the otherwise empty counter. The girl who took my order was smiling and courteous and continued about her work. That is, until the guy - a muscly young man with blue eyes - working behind the counter literally shoved her out of the way in order to tell me that I had to leave.\n\n\"Huh? Why?\"\n\n\"Because you have a cone. Cups inside. Cones outside. Leave, now.\"\n\nI was flummoxed. \"Uh...ok,\" I stammered as I walked outside, a bit shocked by the rudeness. I figured I'd walk around the block, finish my cone, and go inside to express my dismay that I wasn't told ahead of time that I couldn't stay if I got my ice cream in a cone.\n\nWhen I entered the store again, a few more customers had come in, but the girl recognized me and asked, \"is everything all right?\"\n\nI said, \"I'm here to complain, but please go ahead and finish with these people.\" After a few minutes, the customers cleared out. But right then, the male employee came back out, saw me, and made a dash toward us. \"What do you want?\" he said, forcefully and visibly angry.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to someone about the cone policy. I've never been in here before...\"\n\n\"Look -\" he cut me off. \"I can't even talk to you. You're going to have to leave.\"\n\n\"Excuse me?\"\n\n\"If the owner even finds out I've been taking complaints from customers, I'll get in big trouble. It's store policy.\"\n\nI looked at both the guy - still starting at me, eyes blazing - and the girl, who was looking at the floor in embarrassed silence. \"Wait, are you telling me I can't come in here and talk to the manager about the service?\"\n\n\"I'm going to get in trouble, in TROUBLE\" he repeated.\n\nI didn't buy it. \"You're not going to get in trouble for listening to me.\"\n\n\"Sir, I'm going to get in trouble if I so much as even talk to you. You really should just get up and leave.\"\n\n\"Look, if it comes down to it, I'll tell the owner that I just wouldn't shut up. I don't want my money back, and I don't want anything free. All I want is to suggest suggest that you be more proactive about telling people about your policy.\"\n\n \"THERE'S A SIGN!\" he yelled, pointing to a small 12\"x16\" sign at the far end of the long fountain. \"We don't HAVE to tell people.\" At this point I turned around to the four people in the booth who were staring, mouths agape.\n\nI said, \"Okay, what I hear you saying is that you want me to take my complaints to the owner. That's fine. Where can I reach him?\"\n\nThe guy silently slapped a card on the counter that had the number of the store on it. \"And I can reach him here?\"\n\n\"Yeah, go ahead and try.\" the guy spit back. \"Now leave.\"\n\nI was literally reeling with shock at this welcome to my new neighborhood. I left the store, and called the number, and got the girl, who suggested I call back \"maybe on weekdays, between 11 and 3, and on some weekends.\" She said the owner's name was \"Levon.\"\n\nI have called back almost every day since and left my name and number, and somehow \"Levon\" never calls me back. The guy on the phone recognizes my voice when I call. As far as I can tell, the guy is playing a game, and never intends to put me through to the owner.\n\nJust today, I called the St. Francis, gave my name and number, and asked if the owner was there. \"He's in a meeting,\" the guy responded. I called back 10 minutes later, asked again, and was told he wasn't in today and that I should try back later. \"Well, someone just told me that he was in an in a meeting.\"\n\n\"Oh? Well, we have lots of employees here and I don't like being called a liar. Bye.\" And he hung up.\n\nI wouldn't have imagined that level of service here in San Francisco. That said, I'll be living right down the street from them. We'll see how long the charade keeps up.\n\n***\nI finally connected with Levon through Facebook, and we met for coffee. He was very cordial, and listened carefully as I recounted what happened. He explained the (rather charming) purpose behind their deliberately old-fashioned policies, and apologized for the bad experience I had there. I'll keep private the details of our conversation, but he welcomed me back to the store at any time, and I look forward to taking him up on his offer once I get settled in to my new neighborhood.", "author": "Jason B."}

The service was slooooow, and our waiter seemed to disappear for way too long at regular intervals while another server was practically having a menage-a-trois with the group next to us. Yo, can I get some service over heeeerrre? Oh, you're busy? Fine... I guess I'll just wait...\n\nI ordered the no-huevos rancheros. My beans were runny and had a generally peculiar consistency. The biggest insult were the tortillas that were shoved onto the plate and into the beans where they got wet and made them difficult to operate in typical huevos rancheros-eating fashion. \n\nEven more annoying: our bill was delivered to us in the form of chicken scratch. Only the discoverers of the Rosetta Stone might be able to relate to our experiences trying to figure out who ordered what and how much we all owed.\n\nAs we left we noticed a cue of people waiting to get into SFF for their Saturday brunches.

After our meal finally came, we were told that our milkshakes were \"coming right up.\"  Another 15 or 20 minutes later, when it became apparent that we'd just been forgotten, we asked for them to go.  Now, I'm sorry, but when I pay 5 bucks for a \"small\" milkshake, I expect a little more than a six-inch high paper cup thrown at me.  \n\nThe bottom line is they couldn't be bothered to care about their customers, and no amount of old-school charm makes up for that.", "author": "Liliana S."}

We had just finished our soundcheck around 10am, and were hungry as all hell. I searched for all the closest \"breakfast\" places nearby on my iphone (yelp app =]). This was the closest one that popped up. After finding parking a couple streets down, we turned onto 24th and noticed all of the amazing smells from restaurants from nearby Mexican joints and bakeries. We were almost swayed towards one of these, but decided to check out St Francis since they seemed to have actual breakfast which we were in the mood for. \n\nWe were seated within 15 minutes of arriving, and the place was hoppin'. We read the menu and our mouths started to water, and learned that it was one of, if not the first (I can't quite remember which) ice cream places in SF. The staff was friendly and helpful in making our decisions.\n\nThe Order:\nI ordered the Country Breakfast with 2 biscuits in sausage gravy, 2 scrambled eggs (you can get them any way you please) and hash browns. Now these has browns are amazing on their own (big chunky pieces of tater). But they have an option to \"thing\" your spuds. Oh...my god folks...they add sour cream, cheese, chives and their homemade salsa that tastes like it came from a legit Mexican place. Best potatoes I've ever had. The biscuits and gravy were out of this world. While I've had bigger biscuits, these were unbelievably buttery and deliscious, and the gravy was bomb. The guitarist in the band had the exact same breakfast I did and was equally blown away which is a feat considering his food snobbery. Our keyboardist had this awesome breakfast burrito and a coffee shake which was also amazing. \n\nThe Verdict: \nGuys, this was hands down the best plate of biscuits and gravy I've ever had, and I always judge breakfast places by their pancakes or biscuits (usually both). The band has decided to come back here for sure next time we're in SF to try their lunch and dinner offerings. The best place I'd had before this was Ole's Waffle Shop in Alameda, which is also phenomenal.", "author": "Patrick R."}

That and I spent my last bit of cash on produce at the local market and the Slocombe place only takes cash.  So I decided to save Slocombe for another day and move on.  I remembered that the St. Francis Fountain was nearby so I headed over there.\n\nWhen I stepped into the restaurant, I felt like I had stepped into the set of Back to the Future.  Total 50s  vibe plus your standard quotient of hipsters.  After all this is the Mission.  The menus even look like they date back to the 50s..except when you look at the prices.  It never ceases to amaze me what people will charge for ice cream.  $7 for a banana split?  $4 for a milkshake?  What if it doesn't bring all the boys to the yard?  Instead I opted for a single scoop of Rocky Road, which set me back $3.  The marshmallows were a slightly orange hue, but the ice cream was the most ethreal scoop of ice cream that I've ever tasted.  Very rich in flavor and not the slightest hint of freezer burn.  \n\nI'm not really a Mission chic, and I'm surprised that something this charming exists in the Mission, but I would definitely stop back on a spectacular sunny day for some more Rocky Road.", "author": "Amy Z."}

She mentioned that this old diner was more of a brunch spot, but was open for dinner as well. We sat at a booth by the back, and got served right away. After perusing the lengthy menu, I immediately noticed that it was a Coke and not a Pepsi establishment!  The straws were paperesque and reminded me of a combo of a pixie stick and candy cane. How awesome! I already loved this place and haven't even eaten yet! \nFor my pre-race dinner (as Kaiser 5K was early the next morning), I wanted something hearty, so the cheeseburger was calling my name, but was undecided on the sides. There were about 6 different sides to choose from (garden or chef or caesar salad, fries, mac and cheese, coleslaw, etc.,). Being the cheese freak, I had to get the mac and cheese! Service was speedy, and within minutes, our meals arrived. Burger was superb and juicy with fresh shredded lettuce and tomatoes. Could've done without the onions, pickles, and mayo, but tend to like my sammies on the dry side anyway. Wished the bun was a bit thicker, as it got a lil' soggy on the bottom. Regardless, it was delish and totally enjoyable! The mac and cheese was the perfect amount, topped with some bread crumbs for texture, and not oily at all! \n\nThis place is reasonably priced (burger was about $7)! \nHoly cow, while perusing the candy counter, I saw NKOTB, Yo MTV Raps, Knight Ridder, Garbage Pail Kids, and 21 Jump Street collector cards!? Are you kidding me? How crazy awesome is that!? Jaw breakers, lollipops, and other sugary goodies were also available for sale. \n\nUndoubtedly, I'll be back at SFF!

While more scene than substance, it's the atmosphere and service that suffer more than the reliable, if pedestrian, food.\n\nWithout much competition for diner fare in the area, it will satisfy your needs (especially for breakfast).  It's been a few years (and probably a management change) since I've sampled lunch and a shake.  However, I'd recommend sticking to mid-week breakfast; it can be busy on weekends even though they have now added sidewalk tables.\n\nThe service was mixed; split about 50/50 between helpful and disinterested staff.  I didn't enjoy the atmosphere due to both the seemingly bored staff members, which can't be ignored while seated at the counter, and the loud, poor quality music system and corresponding raised customer voices.  Outdoors would likely be a better choice on weekends.  On a weekday, the atmosphere is generally more relaxed.\n\nOn the other hand, if you are under 30 and looking to be part of a scene, the atmosphere may be a positive.  And, the cooks continue to produce competent versions of classic diner breakfasts.  Expect to spend slightly above average for a diner ($15 per person for breakfast).\n\nNote: See \"about me\" for a description of my ratings.

They are such a staple in American culture, the 2nd home of locals and travelers alike, places where you can sit at the counter with a piece of pie and a thick-rimmed cup of coffee and hang your hat for a while.  \n\nSt. Francis fountain is representative of my favorite type of diner - one with real history, and with a menu that addresses today's dietary preferences without getting too far away from the Blue Plate Special of decades past.   \n\nBreakfast?  Yep.  Burger and a shake? Yep, yep.  BLT and and Egg Cream, followed by a piece of cherry pie?  Yep, yep, yep.\n\nOK, if all of the above has sold you, I do have to disclose one caveat.  SFF is a Hipster Mecca.  It's the St. Francis Fountain of the Tragically Hip - they runneth over and spilleth onto the street.  That factor can range from slightly to extremely annoying, depending on the length the line and your level of hunger and tolerance.  Since my level of hunger is always at a 10 and tolerance at a 3-4, this would usually keep me away.  However, I like it so much that I find ways to go at off hours in order to avoid killing everyone.  So, this means 11:30am, 3pm, or some such similar hour.\n\nOK!  Back to the positive - GREAT candy counter.  One of the best I have seen.  Hours are just what you want them to be - 8 to 10 - time for breakfast, lunch and supper, and not conducive to late night munchies.  \n\nBurgers and shakes rock, which is the test of diner-worthiness in my book.

It's an old soda fountain, which is neat, plus, it has counter seating, which is neat, and it has vegan food, which is peachy keen. \n\nBUT.\n\nI've been to SFF a bunch of times now (10+), and each time I've identified myself as a vegan (\"Can I get the tofu scramble, vegan style, please?\"), and only yesterday was I informed that the homefries, which come standard with all tofu scrambles, are fried in BUTTER and therefore NOT VEGAN. Many thanks to the server who finally filled me  in, but it's too bad nobody mentioned it previously. Yeah, I know I should have explicitly asked, so it is my fault, but in a city like San Francisco, if you're going to be offering vegan-enticing options like tofu scramble and calling things vegan on your menu, you probably want to be clued in to the fact that vegans don't want to eat butter and that some of them are too hungry or caffeine deprived or just plain stupid* to ask outright if you've put butter in the potatoes. The customer is always dumb, after all. \n\nAnyway, I love the thai tofu scramble (with fruit or beans instead of homefries, *sniff*), and the coffee is always good, and so is the vegan chorizo and the veggie burrito swimming in a lake of tasty beans. I hear they have soy gelato as well and can whip up some vegan 'shakes, but when I tried to order one, they were sadly out of soy. \n\nIn conclusion, I really do like St. Francis Fountain a lot but wish they would knock it off with the butter potatoes.\n\n*just because we try to eat ethically doesn't mean we're smart!", "author": "Jordan P."}

Awesome Dream Shake by the way (your \"old school\" straw will fall apart... as for a 2!).  However, our server (who was a brunette with a symmetrical bob hair cut) was rude and not that engaging, and looked at us weird after we ordered only ONE milk shake for the both of us.

Still, just because the mission is half Hipster, half Mexican community, doesn't give this PARTICULAR waitress the right to be an elitist or even act like one for that matter.

Now is when I reveal what a huge hypocrite I am. \n\nBoogaloo's is the devil's den, but St. Francis Fountain -- that OTHER hipster breakfast enclave in the Mission -- isn't so bad. In fact, it's pretty good. I like it, and when it's not busy, I'll sneak in for a vegan peanut butter milkshake and I will REALLY ENJOY IT.\n\nDamn it. \n\nThe difference between this place and Boogaloo's is... They have good food. Duh. They have good VEGAN food, too. I mean, man -- their vegan milkshakes are awesomely delicious. And I've always had good service here. \n\nMy friend Sara and I boldly journeyed here for brunch in a torrential downpour when our office out on ends-of-the-earth-Marin-Headlands Beach was closed during the big storms at the beginning of January. We basically had the place to ourselves (only a torrential downpour and 60-mile-an-hour winds could keep the hipsters away; they're like the Wicked Witch of the West, you know; they melt in water!). And as pretty much the only customers, we had a great time with the servers. \n\nThey taught me a thing or two about my new (psychotic) CrackBerry (further evidence that hipsters are hypocrites themselves when it comes to technology; see my Boogaloo's review: http://www.yelp.com/biz/boogaloos-san-francisco#hrid:Z9uvuBpgNtfjQWRsq6YABQ).   They served us delicious vegan sammies and fries that left me NOT complaining about wanting REAL diner food. AND...\n\nI met the milkshake alchemist. \n\nOn first glance, you'd never know the depth of skill this girl possesses. But she can make you any kind of milkshake under the sun -- totally vegan, and you'd never know it. The flavors she concocts, back in her wood-paneled kitchen laboratory... Hot damn. That particular day, I tried banana walnut, at her suggestion. Oh yeah.\n\nSo my beef with St. Francis is, of course, that we really only get downpours torrential enough to keep the hipsters away about once every couple months. So I'm usually passing the Fountain by, groaning at all the skinny jeans lined up outside as I move on to the Sun Rise a few blocks up 24th.\n\nTherefore I can only give them three stars. And yes, I'm punishing them for their clientele. But just know that I really want to give them more, and be satisfied that I realize I'm a hypocrite. \n\nHipsters make the best vegan milkshakes.

My boyfriend (AT THE TIME, for all you stalkers just waiting for me to enter back into the dating world), who seems to get all of his calories from beer and whiskey, couldn't quite wrap his mind around my suggestion that we go out and get some brunch. Once I explained to him that MOST people require food, especially after a long night of drinking, he suggested St. Francis.\n\nOn the walk there, however, he began grumbling about it. Saying it would probably be a long wait to get a table, and moaning and groaning about the \"hipsters\" that hang around. It almost made me suggest that we try something else instead, but I'm not familiar with the Mission at all, so I stuck to the original choice.\n\nComplaining about wait time and hipsters seem to be very common complaints for this place. Perhaps we were lucky, because we were able to just walk in and take a seat.

While my brain did somersaults as I tried to decide which out of, like, a GAZILLION, combinations of scrambles or omelets I wanted, my boyfriend groaned from across the table.\n\n\"Oh god, they're everywhere!\" \n\nFreaked out, I immediately thought that there were bugs somewhere and I was ready to scream and run to the hills. But it dawned on me that he meant hipsters.\n\nI looked around. \n\nWell, I guess there were a lot of \"hipsters\" there.

Frankly people, you're eating food at a restaurant on THE MISSION. Please tell me what you expect to find? \n\nI ordered a two-egg scramble with feta and spinach, and it came out pretty quickly. I'm normally not a potato fan (ironic, considering i'm irish as hell) but their potatoes rocked my mouth off! They were crunchy and well-seasoned. The scramble was just the right size, too. And there was plenty of feta to make me happy. It seemed a little crazy that my meal cost almost $10, but hey, being hip doesn't come cheap.\n\nThe service was kind of weird. All the people that came to our table were cool, though! But one girl took our orders, one girl gave me coffee, a DIFFERENT girl brought our food, and then some dude gave me a coffee refill.

The diner has a traditional aesthetic to love.  Like any true diner, it features a bar that can accommodate lots of customers.  St. Francis is not a large establishment, but even on a busy Sunday the wait was not long at all.  \n\nA few items that made this place worth the wait were the Nebulous Potato Thing and the old fashioned Dream Shake (complete with paper straws).  One thing I just can never turn down are the traditional biscuits and gravy; a dish that St. Francis has perfected seemingly just for me.\n\nSt. Francis Fountain earns five stars from me for taking a traditional American diner setting/menu and adding a very genuine dose of creativity to the formula.  They do a great job welcoming the latin flavors and influences from the neighborhood and translating them into a lengthy delicious menu that has something for everyone.  \n\nThanks for taking credit cards.

Me like-ah!\n\nFood is everything you'd expect: basic egg dishes, grilled sandwiches + fries, and milkshakes for dessert. It's all good. A Chef's Mess (scrambled eggs, bacon, taters, avocados, green onions, tomatoes and sour cream in a lovely, gigantic pile) will do you right. \n\nSt. Francis even has a candy counter...although I doubt George McFly would have much interest in ironic \"Magnum, P.I.,\" and \"Gong Show\" trading cards. When did Topps and Fleer become such trendy pussies that they make bullshit disposable cards for bullshit disposable hipstards?\n\nAhhh...but I forgive. Some of those hipster women are damn cute, no matter how high-maintenance their faux-hemian fashion sense may be. If you wanna feel the 1.21 \"jiggawatt\" buzz of swarming hipster bees, St. Francis is most definitely the place. And, of course, you can try to pick them up using the words of George McFly himself: \"I am your...density.\"\n\nIt's too bad the prices aren't as 1955 as the decor, or else I'd drive the DeLorean here every day.", "author": "John G."}

The wait staff could use a bath, a training on health code and a serious attitude adjustment ( the last comment refers to one staff member in particular, the rest of the waiters and waitresses are nice.) \n\nThe last straw for me was a very negative experience with the aforementioned waitress, who forced 5 of us to squeeze into one of their very tiny booths. If the group had been all small people it wouldn't have been as uncomfortable but there were three large men among us. She was extremely rude about it, not even allowing us to move into one of the slightly larger booths or pull up a chair because of \"fire code.\" After about 15 minutes of practically sitting in each others laps, another waitress came by and took pity on us and pulled up a chair. As we were walking out, we saw the same waitress behind the counter with an unlit cigarette in her mouth. Yuck! She must have been having a very bad day. Nonetheless, I won't be back.\n\nAtmosphere is cute, but I can't handle the grumpy hipster crowd on weekend mornings.

SO... it all started because I had had a long day and was doing laundry last week. I live near the St. Francis so imagine the temptation of a strawberry shake since my throat was hurting and I felt like I was getting sick. My friend happened to be picking up a to-go order and asked them to make it for me. I continually stopped by only to be ignored or assured that it was being made. I finally made it back after giving the servers plenty of time to finally complete the task of a small shake in a restaurant with only 5 customers in it. \n\nWhen I walked in, a male server walked up to me immediately and asked me to leave my SERVICE DOG outside. When I respectfully responded that she's a service animal, he responded with a snide, \"well if you don't have papers then she really can't be in here.\" I never understand why people think I would need papers for my service dog that has a California Service Dog tag. I picked her up and said, \"she has a tag, see?\" As I held the tag out for him to read he asked me to still wait outside since it was a \"to-go\" order. \n\nYes, yes, it's good customer service to ask me to wait outside when it's cold and I have sore throat, just because you don't like that I have a service dog. Nevermind--the fact that I was waiting on a simple shake for 30 minutes! It took me a split second to decide that I wasn't going to put up with anymore rude hipsters. Ultimately, the overpriced oily diner food is not worth fake smiling hipsters that are only there to look good. I give this place 5 thumbs down.

This is not to say that it is making food on the same level as Coi or any other place I have given high marks to, but it is at the top of its game and delivers 5 stars in the HUNG-OVER BRUNCH CATEGORY.\n\nOh my ice-skating Christ...the \"Chef's Mess\" might be heaven on earth.  It is a plate sized omelette containing all the awesomeness you have ever wanted in an omelette including hash, the perfect amount of cheese melted throughout, and topped with a heaping amount of sour cream.  I took a bite of this masterpiece and promptly moistened the front side of my boxer shorts.  Yeah...its that tasty.  The corned beef hash was fantastic as was the kick ass breakfast burrito.\n\nA top all of that we sat outside, the service was very prompt (and very kind), and the price was right.  Yes.

YES. aside from food and drink, you can come here as if you were going to an old tyme soda fountain (turns out they are one) and get random old candy (probably actually old) and cool packs of trading cards (you will pay way more than you did in 1982-7).  \n\nExperience:  Yeah, yeah hipster this, fixie that.  I already knew going in that I would probably see/talk to/overhear/smell the b.o. of a dozen of 'em.  It's all good, you know why?  These were the nicest people I've ever been served by.  Who knows what they were saying when they went back to the kitchen, but who cares?  When it came to actual customer service, they killed it.  Absolutely killed.  Better service than I've had in this great food city, or any other.  Sounds unbelievable, I know.  I happen to be a customer service expert.  I could run circles around any service person.  These dudes were amazing.  I honestly feel the main reason I am gushing about this, is simply because they all took really good care of my kids, their twin cousins- who had their own table.  If you can nail that aspect of serving diners, you will have customers for generations.  Obviously, they have done so before me.  \n\nFood:  Deeeeeelicious hotcakes.  I love hotcakes/pancakes.  The kids all had Kiddie cakes, which came out like a famous looking mouse.  Wonderful idea, they all loved 'em.  I had hog cakes, which is pancakes with green onions and bacon in the batter.  OINK.  devoured.  We also had some medium sized plates stuffed with large sized portions, which is kinda good, kinda bad, but in the end turns out to be way more than it looks like it's gonna be.  Great food.  I also had an espresso malted milkshake with an added shot (of espresso, ya big dummy!).  Waker upper!  These dudes also got skills making coffee drinks, which is a huge plus on an early Sunday morning after a really late Saturday night.  big plus for me and the lady.  \n\nOutcome: We made it in close to when they opened, so we were able to sit right away at two adjacent booths.  When we left, the place was packed all over, with a long wait outside.  We won!  We will for sure be back, just as long as we go early.  Them hipsters like to wake up late!\n\nNote: watch what you add on, the prices will creep up on the bill if you're not careful...  (something like a city health tax? extra bacon?) either way, you should be cautious wherever you dine I guess.  \n\nMaybe I'll come get an actual fountain drink next time.  Root beer float.

Tucked away on 24th street in the Mission is this old style 50's joint that my folks probably ate at in their teens.  The booths are small and intimate (for small framed folks from the 50's) but that adds to the charm.  Breakfasts are down home, bacon, eggs and flap jacks. It's hard to screw up breakfast!  Burgers are good as well, make sure you leave space for ice cream!  Beat the hoards and get there before 12 if you don't like waiting.\n\nJump into a 50's time capsule! Hope nothing ever changes with this place.\n\nUpdate: Minus one star from my orginal review. Went this past presidents day weekend, the waitstaff all looked like they went out the night before.

Yes we see you are busy, acknowledging your patrons is the LEAST you could do.  This was at 1:30-2 in the afternoon well after the breakfast rush, nobody appeared to be in charge.

We asked the waiter about that rumor, and he said we were sitting in that very booth! One friend almost wet himself with excitement over that one. From that moment on, we knew we'd have a great breakfast at St. Francis Fountain.\n\nWhile there have been slight changes since the old days, most of the changes are for the better, including a large menu with an awesome selection of vegan items. Friendly service from the laid-back staff. Hipsters-blah-blah-hipsters. Who cares? If a hipster is someone who plays the Purple Rain soundtrack during breakfast, I say them's my kind of peeps! They also carry an odd array of '80s trading cards, including ALF, Mork & Mindy, and He-Man. It's sad that the '80s are now considered old school, but it's still fun.

(If you are from or have lived in LA, you understand my frustration of not having a car...) So I walked down 24th St. from the BART station thinking, where the heck am I? This feels like the hippy version of Inglewood! I should have brought my mase! Finally found the place, cute little corner diner type shop, everything on the menu sounded scrumptious, I love breakfast food any time of the day! Ordered the corned beef hash, eggs over medium, with biscuits and a side of country gravy. The first bite tasted so good, but by the 3rd bite, I realized it was my hunger causing the illusion. The food was just OK, I can find faults in each item: The hash was a bit too greasy, the medium eggs were too easy, the biscuits were too dry, and the gravy had about a cup of green onions in it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-10-25", "description": "I have to start this review off by saying I've only eaten at this restaurant on two occasions so this review will only be based on a couple of visits. I've also only had breakfast here. My first visit was a really great experience. The breakfast I ordered was prepared perfectly and I loved everything I ordered. Service was good, the place appeared clean and I liked the old school atmosphere. Had I written a review after that meal, I would have given this place at least four stars. So here's the problem. When I went back a second time, my experience wasn't quite as good. The meal I ordered didn't measure up to the last one. I ordered something different but I don't think that should make a difference. So I can only attribute it to the possibility I didn't  have the same cook the second time around. That would make sense. What is troubling is the one item on my plate that wasn't prepared properly were two freaking fried eggs. I think that at a minimum, a cook should be able to get those right. They were overcooked on one side and that's the one thing that bugs me--when eggs are left too long on the grill and they get brown. When I make that mistake at home (it's rare but it has happened), I toss the things and fry myself up a couple more. I did takeout this time so I left without looking at the carton before I left the place. That was my mistake. So now I'm on the fence about this place but have decided to give it a third try. I really like their menu and the fact they have a lot of selections for vegetarians and vegans so it could be a great go-to place for me when I'm on that side of the city. For right now, however, I'm going to stick with the three stars. It wasn't like my entire meal the second time wasn't good. If my next meal meets my standards, I'll raise my rating. On the other hand, if my next visit isn't a positive one I'm going to have to knock off a star and that will be it for me. Hopefully, that won't be the case.", "author": "Rabbit B."}

This may beyond rescue, and I'm not sure it's worth it.  I hadn't been here is a long time and apparently I hadn't missed anything but misery.  We walked in around 6:30 before a play at Brava Theater across the street and all was well until we noticed there was a group of about five huddled by the front door and they weren't being seated or talked to by anyone else.  We pushed around and grabbed a couple seats at the counter and noticed a very agitated guy two counter stools away.  Finally he yelled out at the waiter who kept walking by us without a word of encouragement and asked if his food was being cooked.  The waiter tried to ignore him, but this guy looked very street smart and rough, so after a couple stand off's the waiter went into the kitchen which I could see from my seat, and asked what the hell was going on with the order that wasn't being cooked or delivered.  So waiterboy came out and told angry customer that the order was almost ready which was not the truth.  We kept being ignored all this time and waiterboy was actually matched on the floor by waitergirl who appeared to be equally inept.  About 20 minutes so far and not a peep about our awkward status, but what we saw finally delivered to angry customer told us not to order 'food' at this time.  Not sure in angry customer ordered and omelette or an egg casserole, but it was hideous as a vision and smelled gross.  There were a couple of dueces that seemed to be fetching their own water and condiments after waiting way too long, but the place was really dead and I still can't imaging what this place does to pay the bill's.  Finally waiterboy came and asked what we wanted and we said we each wanted a small shake, it is a fountain, and he gave us each a glass of water and disappeared again.

The fries were pretty good (medium thickness and crispy enough) and the homefries had good seasoning. My strawberry shake definitely hit the spot.\n\nFor our second trip there, we got a chicken salad and a reuben with chicken vegetable soup. I loved how the soup was served piping hot. It was a little salty though. The reuben was very good, not too salty, not too greasy. Bread was perfected toasted with just enough butter and went well with the melted cheese and just the right amount of pastrami. My boyfriend's chicken salad was good enough (not disgusting and not amazing). We also got a mint ice cream for dessert.

Hands-down. They have a ridiculously extensive menu and the prices are about on-par with what it is in San Francisco. (Anywhere else and it'd be overpriced, though.) I've had a pretty big portion of the menu and everything is good, which is key in a place that you choose to dine at with a group. I've taken several people here and they all loved it. The location is a little harsh (24th and York ain't exactly the safest spot in the City) and the wait can be pretty intense on weekend mornings, but all of this is waived when you take your first bite of their biscuits'n'gravy or a sip of a Guinness (yes, the beer) float. \n\nAnd, ho-hah, you can have vegan shakes/ice cream and they have vegan sausages and the like!

We got the Side Platter (bowl of mac & cheese, cup of chili, and caesar salad), the Veggie Mess, and the corn bread. The vegetarian chili was especially delicious since it was on the lighter and healthier side being a three bean chili without fake meat. The chili is NOT another lackluster attempt in the futile fight to make 'meatless' taste 'meaty', so give it a try if you haven't already. The Veggie Mess should be called Hangover Heaven since it is a heavy pile of starchy potato and faux meat covered in gooey cheese heaped on a plate - complete bliss when you have an insatiable appetite. Mac and cheese and corn bread were solid and the caesar was a nice complement to the heavier plates. The only thing on the menu I've had and didn't love was the S.F.

When I lived in Florida, we used to always go to this breakfast spot for their incredible coffee.  I moved to Chicago and visited Florida a few months after the move.  My friend and I went to the breakfast place and I asked the server about the coffee.  Sure enough, it was Folgers.  At least I admit to it.  Maybe I'm not so picky after all.).  Our server was both attentive and adorable.  Even if the food and coffee were terrible, I'd go back for him.\n\nI had the vegan chorizo hash.  Yum.  I've always wanted to try chorizo but not being a pig or cow eater, I haven't taken the plunge.  My friend also ordered the vegan chorizo hash and said it tasted very close to the real thing.

It's not like it is hard to beat out Denny's but it is hard to find a place that will make breakfast at night, right. \n\nThe place looks much like the way it was opened back in the twenties. All of the booths and counters have to be at least 30-40 years old which gives it character, but with character comes the aging lines of time. It was easy to recognize where to sit in the booth because the butt prints of diners' past marked the landing zone with cracks and holes in the leather. The booths stand up straight like wooden castles that surround your party. \n\nThe food feels like they throw the kitchen sink at you. We had the french toast delight and the chef's mess. The french toast was anything but french and instead resembled the desert mountains of the west right after the first snow storm of the year. The toast was deep in the mountain floor under piles of strawberries, pineapples, nut, apples, raisins and sugar powdered granola. Ribbons of yogurt lined the lodes of french toast. I enjoyed it just as much as the 49'ers... the 1849ers upon discovering gold at Sutter's mill. The contrast between the different textures and flavors, made the whole dish enjoyable with little nuggets of delight in every bite.\n\nThe chef's mess was what it claimed to be with eggs, cheese, sour cream, green onions and of course the most important ingredient... bacon. With these ingredients, its like shooting fish in a barrel when it comes to making something tasty. Rather than make your stomach feel like it hits your knees the mess was lighter and energizing.\n\nThe food was hearty but not overbearing. It seemed that the waiters were not eating it though because they were both morbidly skinny. I am coming back next time I feel like pancakes late, yet I don't want to feel like a bloated whale afterward.

I've also come here late at night to sit at the counter and get a banana split and I'll admit it - I felt special.\nBe prepared to wait on the weekends - they've recently taken over the space next door to deal with their high weekend volume but its not always in use.  Grab a cup of Philz on the way, write your name down, and enjoy the weekend bustle as you wait for a damn good brunch.", "author": "Jane F."}

This place is more than your neighborhood diner, it is an institution, similar to Tadich Grill and the House of Prime Rib, and maybe one of the oldest diners around.  And while diner offerings stir up memories of eggs, bacon, potatoes and white toast, St. Francis does that and more.  While having all your diner favorites like eggs Benedict and piled high French toast, they also have all your favorite veg options for the most discerning of palates.  So, next time you're on 24th street, stop by St. Francis and enjoy one of their lovely milkshakes, but get there early or be prepared to wait, this place is always packed.  One last thing, this place is stocked with your old school favorites like garbage pale kids trading cards, bazooka gum, and cry babies!  Enjoy!", "author": "David M."}

This place hit the spot!  I ordered the biscuits and gravy with a side order of bacon (oh yeah, my arteries are closing up just from typing that sentence) and surprisingly the gravy was so much better than I thought it was going to be.  This really didn't taste like your run of the mill canned gravy.  It has some spices and flavors going on that I didn't expect from this joint.  And the bacon, well don't even get me started on the bacon.   I know me some bacon, and this was pretty duuuurned good bacon.  This wasn't some limp-dick, see-thru, paper-thin, bacon you might get at Denny's or IHOP or some other chain type place.  This bacon was thick, salty, and crunchy, just the way it's supposed to be.  The homefries weren't half bad either.  Normally homefries aren't my thing, I always find big chunks of potatoes to be too dry and starchy.  But these were mixed up with little bit of green onions and probably cooked in a nice amount of oil/lard/something to keep them somewhat moist.  \n\nThis place is a little heavy on the hipster vibe, but the waitstaff was actually really nice to us.  We sat at the counter so maybe that's why we got a little more attention since they're right in your face while they grab silverware or make the coffee.

It looks like most of the fixtures are still there.\n\nI would've given this place 5 stars, but i found a piece of bacon in my potatoes.

Needless to say the food was warm at best.\n\nIt drives me nuts when no one is the waiter for that section.  One person took our order, another brought us water, another brought us coffee, another brought a malted milk and another brought us our food.

The clientele consisted mostly of locals, kids coming back from school and grabbing a cone, stuff like that. It was about as authentic and genuine as you could get. Unfortunately, business didn't go too well in the 90s, so the family had to sell it, after owning the place since its inception in 1918.\n\nTwo owners later, the St. Francis, now with a grill, has a larger menu, infused with california style cuisine that is all completely average, no more homemade ice cream, (it's winchells, still good, bot not *as* good.) the candy counter has now been replaced with collectors cards that would make any gen xer wet their pants, the staff can range from being attentive to indifferent to just rude, and the clientele (and staff) mostly consists of twentysomething white hipsters.  \n\nTo summarize: Zero charm, overpriced nothing food, spotty service with a certain degree of attitude, and clientele that is often just as obnoxious.

The only caveat was that the service was somewhat lacking; I don't know if it was just a poor staff to customer ratio, but, the service wasn't all that great, but, not terrible either. I will definately give it another shot; the positives far outweigh the negatives.\n****UPDATE****\nI went back this afternoon with my boyfriend and had absolutely TERRIFIC service.

I had it on my list of places to visit in SF mainly because of the vegan shake and ice cream.\n\nMy boyfriend and I ended up having lunch here on our last day in town.  The guy next to us had ordered the Vegan Chorizo Hash with Tofu, and it looked sooooo good, we BOTH GOT IT.  \n\nIt was pretty amazing: in the center, a tofu scramble with ranchero sauce, and surrounding it, vegan chorizo mixed in with diced potatoes, with three soft, hot corn tortillas on the side! \n\nIt comes with a side: I got mine with a side of veggie chili--it wasn't as good as the Whole Foods canned variety, but was topped with scallions--and my boyfriend got a side of home fries, which were really good, nice and firm, and covered in herbs.\n\nHe got the \"Dream\" shake (orange sherbet and vanilla, topped with whipped cream and a cherry), and I got the vanilla \"All Soy\" shake.  The ice cream they use (I hear it is a local ice creamery, right?) IS SO GOOD.  I didn't see vanilla beans but would have guessed they were in there.  It was so very vanilla-y, and with a cherry on top.  \n\nThe server was staight-up abrasive, very unhelpful.  The bill came out to $43, which I think is kind of expensive for 2 diner-style entrees and a shake.  But the has was very good, and so was my shake, and I'd go back for either!\n\nWe ended up getting some 80s trading cards which was fun.  The lock on the bathroom door was broken, which was scary!, but one of my favorite things about the place was the old-school \"BORAXO\" powder hand soap dispenser in there.", "author": "D P."}

Why don't you just go up to every customer, look them in the eye and say 'I could care less if you eat or not today because I'm a bitch.'\" Because that's kinda what it felt like. (2) I ordered coffee, because it's how I roll. I couldn't get anyone's attention to refill my coffee, and had about a cup and a half of it the entire time. Ask my friends...they will tell you that a cup and a half is not even near enough to satisfy me. Better yet, since I'm sitting at the counter, you would have thought that perhaps they might have been better at refills. Oye again...\n\nWhile this has nothing to do with my rating, my friend and I were giggling about this...ok, it was more me giggling than anything...they still have the original neon signs above the door, and one of them says something about they make their own candy locally and fresh or some junk. But, the candy they sell is all Wonka stuff. I kept saying, \"Where are the Umpa Loompas in the back making it?\"\n\nOh...and another cool thing...they have Duran Duran trading cards from like...the 1800's...that's kinda cool...I think...", "author": "Nicolas H."}

It was the original soda fountain in San Francisco and they do a good job of maintaining the look and feel of an old soda fountain. Plus, the milkshakes are delicious. When i moved to the city i  frequented the St. Francis 3-4 days a week. Don't let the hipster wait staff scare you off, they're friendly. Plus, it provides a great aesthetic. \n\nAs for the food, the scrambles are great; tons of fresh veggies and plenty of cheese. I've never been much of an omelet gal but I've heard they're good. When I'm feeling glutenous I go for the biscuits and gravy, delish. The breakfast burritos are tasty as well and definitely try the vegan chorizo. On that note, for all you veggies out there, they have a wide variety of vegetarian options. They're tofu dishes are tasty as well as the veggie rueben. \n\nThe St. Francis isn't five stars because the coffee is bad and the food isn't five star quality. If your a mimosa person they're available but pricey and bloody's aren't offered. I keep going back because the food is consistent, the service is good and it's fun.", "author": "K B."}

Forget everything you think you know about 1950's-style diners--especially if that knowledge was imparted from such establishments as Lori's downtown.  St. Francis Soda Fountain is the real deal--from the paper straws to the design of the menus to the old-fashioned powdered soap in the bathroom, it's clear the management has paid close attention to detail, and doesn't take their customers for suckers.\n\nApparently, St. Francis used to make their own ice cream, but in recent years have switched to Mitchell's (which is almost the same thing).  The first time i sat down at the counter, i ordered a single-scoop in a cone, and was told they only serve it in a glass dish unless you're getting it to go.  Apparently that's the traditional way these things are done.  i appreciated that.  \n\nRecently my girlfriend were on 24th waiting for a show to begin, and we decided to stroll in for a small bite to eat.  Among the best deals on the menu (and there are quite a few...it's a tough decision) is the bowl of chili and cornbread.  We both decided on that, having no idea what we had bargained for.  The chili was absolutely delicious, full of veggies and covered in cheese, but the best part was by far the thick chunk of cornbread that came with it.  Moist and buttery, with a dense, substantial consistency and baked with chopped jalape\u00f1os throughout, then pan-toasted just prior to serving for a nice, crispy outside.

So why am I telling you this? Other than because I can? Because on days like this I want my Momma to scoop me into her lap and spoon feed me Kraft Macaroni and Cheese.  As this is not an option I can at least search for a culinary equivalent. With its retro stylings and tweaked diner menu, I took my foggyheaded self straight to St Francis. Veggie chili topped with cheddar cheese, sour cream, and green onions with a generous slice of warm, crispy-on-the-outside-soft-and-buttery-on-the-inside corn bread was EXACTLY what I needed. It was a hug from my innards outwards. Generally I think a lot of their food is pretty good, if not somewhat expensive, but when it comes to their comfort food selections (aforementioned chili and cornbread, other baked goods like banana bread and biscuits, milkshakes, soups) they live up to their holy title.

Hubby has fond  memories of going there for ice cream when he was a wee lad, back in the halcyon days when if was safe for elementary school age kids in the Mission to walked to their neighborhood school on their own. I believe there was a slump in the 90's. I remember a local family ran it for a while, but it never took off, probably because the food was  ordinary and the atmosphere dead. When we heard there were new owners, we decided to try St. Francis again. When our happy little family of four walked in, I could immediately feel the hipness quotient drop several notches. And this was when you could still walk in at 11:30am and have your pick of tables. The food kept us coming back - ice cream mocha- yum! and I'm particularly fond of eggs Sandhya. And the staff has been nothing but pleasant, even making nice with the young 'uns. Maybe they are surly only to those of their own kind. Alas, the time came when the wait to be seated became longer and longer, and finally, the death knell, the little yellow wait list pad, appeared. So, we don't usually go anymore on week-ends, but we get the same food without the wait at other times of the week.", "author": "Kara P."}

Well if you do a search for St. Francis Fountain, I highly recommend that you go to the offered alternative. The place is not a neat old diner. It's a tired old diner, much in need of some soapy water applied to most surfaces, followed by a paint brush. Their burgers are okay. But couldn't stand up against a Jumbo Jack. They weren't serving fries. The Chef's Mess was a rather colorless, unappetizing pile of vegetable matter and cheese, which had about as much eye appeal as the contents of a Mexican barf bag. The chili was very watery. The very dry mac and cheese was ok. The service made me feel I had not so much slipped into the past, as it made me feel that I'd been rudely transported to some greasy spoon in some depressed rural  backwater . The biggest disappointment was the milkshake. I'm a big lover of shakes and after reading a good number of reviews here on Yelp, I was excited. I must admit it was very thick. But it had been left mixing so long that it had lost that sort of icy crystaline texture which is one of the primary qualities sought by a true shake aficionado. It was very like the ones that first came out of shake machines at MacDonalds about 45 years ago. The service, if you want to call it that, was minimalist. All I can say, given all the kudos in other reviews, is that they must make some kind of world class fries. I won't likely return. And the check was nearly $45 for 3 people.", "author": "Rellsky S."}
