Not sure what it was... as I review the health ratings..\n\nWe ordered three dishes, and they are listed below :\n\nGalbi - so so good. Everything on the dish including the bed of onions was delicious. I really loved the light char yet the meat was tender and juicy! the smaller portion feeds 2 easily if you order at least a couple more dishes. \n\nKimchi pancake - the best kimchi pancake I have had!! I loved how they cut the pancake into smaller portions and each bite was consistent. Kimchi, crunchy pancake, yummmmmm!!!\n\nChicken wings- don't order original. It's so basic and unflavored. Garlic was super yummy. We ordered half half and they charge $1 more . Not the best wings I've had - the batter is a little thicker and airy here but the chicken is moist, tender. I think the garlic flavor could be a little more deep, it was pretty shallow and only could be tasted on bites with the inconsistently spread garlic sauce.\n\n\nFYI they have taken the seafood pancake off the menu because the owner is currently sick. It is a labor intensive dish and will not be back until she recovers.\n\nParking is iffy and the area is too- try to park close!\n\nOtherwise, service was amazing and we would come back should we be convinced it wasn't this food that gave us both issues... but probably not :(", "author": "Karen H."}

The server was very attentive and checked in often in how we were doing. Definitely on the pricier side compared to other Korean restaurants in the city and the servings sizes are not huge but just enough to fill you up. \n\nI tried the following: \nKimchi fried rice - pretty tasty, not too spicy and more on the sweet side. The seaweed added gives a nice texture and flavor to the rice. \n\nGrilled asparagus - $6, small serving size, they use baby asparagus and season it with a sweetened soy sauce and season seeds. Good flavor and crunch.  \n\nGarlic Fried Chicken - my favorite dish! They put it on a hot plate with garlic on top and you have flip onto the hot dish. Perfect crunch and flavor and the chicken was super juicy inside. Highly recommend trying! \n\nSweet and Spicy Chicken - I can't handle spicy but my bf enjoyed it. Said it had a nice kick and also sweet flavor to contrast.  \n\nMochi Ice Cream - mango and strawberry $5, they drizzle the mochi with some chocolate and top it with kiwi. Personally prefer the mochi as is without extra sauce. Just tastes like store bought mochi, unfrozen. Probably could skip. \n\nOverall, solid place. Nice ambience for a date night.

My family and friends said they can drink the refreshing citron soju and eat the garlic chicken wings all day!  Being a vegetarian, I ate most of the mushroom japchae and enjoyed the fresh veggie wraps that I made with the veggie basket. The citron soju was indeed refreshing. We also tried the peach soju and all of us prefer the citron soju. For dessert, we had vanilla and Strawberry mochi ice cream and green tea cheesecake.

We yelped it and came across this random restaurant in the mission - was surprisingly decent.\n\nWe ordered kimchi fried rice, taco trio, and rice cake skewers. We were overly ambitious for ordering the rice cake skewers, but the taco trio and kimchi fried rice were legit. The taco trio is perfect for the indecisive folks since it includes combos of bulgogi, spicy pork belly, and kimchi. Kimchi fried rice is just delicious any time of day. I would not say this place is purely Korean, since the food does taste slightly Americanized (like all Asian restaurants in this area), but it was still tasty and filling. \n\nThe restaurant is super spacious and we did not have to wait to get seated (the best of both worlds especially when hungry).

Edison bulbs, string lights, and wooden bar. The layout is very \"open.\" There's tables off to the sides, but right in front of the door, there is a random open space.\n\nFried chicken - We got this in both of the sauces, garlic and sweet-spicy. We couldn't tell which of the sauces we liked better. Both were very very sweet. The garlic wings were topped with lots of garlic that we ended up scraping off the wing before eating. The sweet-spicy could use more balancing. Dish came with pickled daikon. The wings also come out piping hot so be careful when taking the first bite.\n\nKimchi Fried Rice - This was my favorite. It's like comfort food. The rice was cooked nicely. It had really good flavor. I could kill a whole bowl by myself.\n\nSeafood pancake - This came out on a hot plate. It was a little burnt but still good. I think the pancake could have used more seafood but overall I would order again.\n\nOnly complaint is the smell of the place. It has an overpowering bathroom cleaner smell that hits you every once in a while. i'm not sure if it's just an old building or if the pipes are bad, but it's a little distracting when you are trying to eat. \n\nWill come back to try the meat dishes and soup.

Good food and welcoming space for a date or to catch up with friends. \n\nCame here on a Tuesday night w/ my bf a couple weeks ago. The staff noticed us right away upon entering, but took a while for us to be seated. Service was slow that night, not sure why since the restaurant wasn't even packed, but it picked up as the night went on. \n\nFood was okay. Everything we ordered was shared/shareable, which was nice. We ordered the Korean ramen, Kimchi Fried Rice w/ pork, and Garlic pork belly. Only downside of the food was the limited banchan and the ramen. The banchan is not like your typical kbbq restaurant where they serve you 5+ banchan options. Here, they only serve kimchi and bean sprouts. Both good, but wish there was more in quantity and more variety in the banchan. The ramen tasted like instant ramen and they tossed in some spicy Korean broth. I was craving noodles that night so it was okay and filling, but I would not recommend ordering this nor would I order this again for $11. \n\nKimchi fried rice had all the right flavors. It was pretty spicy for me and my bf. A simple but filling dish - rice, kimchi, dry seaweed, pork, and a fried egg on top. $13\n\nFavorite of the night was the garlic pork belly. It came out last, BUT tasted so good. Kinda pricy though for $21. If you love garlic like me, then you'll enjoy this dish. Jam-packed with flavor, the garlic pork belly is served on a sizzling plate and is more than enough meat to share with another person.\n\nAll in all, I'd probably come back to try other items if I'm in the area and use that 10% off check in on yelp!", "author": "Debby N."}

However, we decided to try this place based on a recommendation from a fellow foodie I met in a yoga class. She led me to some cool places like Mozzeria in the Mission, which we really liked (review: http://bit.ly/2pEQQht). I thought parking would be a bear, but surprisingly there were free meters right around the corner on Santa Rosa. Piece of cake. There was just one group of rambunctious guys at a table next to the window, but otherwise it was pretty empty on a Wednesday evening.\n\nThe menu was smallish but nicely eclectic even if it was really Korean with a hipster attitude. As we were deciding what to have, the young server gave us a free mini-appetizer of the Sweet Potato Fries with Spicy Mayo (photo: http://bit.ly/2pEQzbq). They weren't deep-fried, but they were tasty with a snap, and we never turn down mayo. Jamie and I went with splitting three dishes. The first was the $6 Baby Asparagus with toasted sesame seeds served on a sizzling iron plate (photo: http://bit.ly/2pU6txS). It was delicious, just not enough of it to satisfy beyond a few bites. Our second dish was the $13 Kimchi Fried Rice with Pork, which was covered with a fried egg and sprinkled with strips of dry seaweed (photo: http://bit.ly/2pEQmYH).\n\nThis was good solid comfort food, a bit by-the-numbers but no complaints, especially with the mini-banchan that came with it (photo: http://bit.ly/2pi2EGy). Our main event was the $17 Garlic Fried Chicken, a hearty portion with at least ten drumettes stacked precariously on a hot iron plate and coated in marinated minced garlic (photo: http://bit.ly/2oRqbew). As much as I love garlic, even I thought the minced garlic was excessive and we ended up scraping much of it off to get to the screaming hot poultry. It came with pickled radish cubes which provided some relief from the sticky heat (photo: http://bit.ly/2oNmjg5). They appear to be searching for their bearings a bit, but they're still off to a promising start.\n\nFOOD - 4 stars...edgy, tasty Cal-Korean with a few flaws but a little tweaking will help them\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...blessedly low-key on a weeknight\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...fairly quiet but mostly responsive\nTOTAL - 4 stars...modern Korean spot looks out of place in the Excelsior but what the hell", "author": "Ed U."}

They were hard to eat but my friend doesn't like to complain so he ate them all anyways but agreed they were way too salty. If I was with anyone else I would've sent them back. It tasted like someone dumped the salt shaker on it. So sad. \n\nI also wish they had more vegetarian/pescetarian options. They very easily accommodated me when I asked for the meat on the side of my japchae though which was nice. I let my friend have all of it instead. I think some tofu/shrimp options would be really good. \n\nStaff here is great. I think I saw the owner there again having a full meal (just like another review said teehee). I love the different kinds of soju and wine they have. Also kind of annoying is they just placed the bottle of soju unopened on our table both times. I rarely see this happen. Its like opening your own bottle of wine or beer. I'm pretty sure its industry standard to open the bottle before serving it.

We also ended up getting a bottle of peach soju to go with our meal :) Everything turned out to be super yummy and we ended up finishing everything we ordered! (This doesn't happen a lot because I usually get full really easily) \n\nI really enjoyed the Korean ramen, especially on a cold, rainy day. It's a bit different from the tofu soup at other Korean restaurants with ramen added to it, but I really like the flavoring and the ramen texture here. I would definitely order this again. You have the options of adding cheese, spam or kimchi for an additional price - I believe it was $1/$2 for each item. We decided to go with just the spam and kimchi since we're already having a lot of cheese from the cheese corn! \n\nThe cheese corn has a nice presentation and tastes pretty good as well! I like how it has the Panko/fried bread crumbs along the sides and some siracha sauce on top. It is not the best cheese corn that I've ever had, but it is pretty good and unique from the other cheese corn dishes I've had at other places. \n\nThe taco trio was super juicy and flavorful! It has three different kinds of meat I believe and I enjoyed all of them! :) i wouldn't mind if there was a little bit less of that orange sauce though, it was a bit too saucy for me, but that probably varies and I don't mind it too much so I would definitely order this again. Maybe next time there will be less orange sauce on it and not drenched like this time! \n\nI am looking forward to coming back and trying more items on the menu. Maybe the wings next time? And the hangover soup if I do a lot of drinking the night before ;)", "author": "Bailey L."}

What I ordered:\n\nKalbi - serving size wasn't what I expected for something so expensive so I guessed maybe their quality of meat was suppose to make up for it. However, their quality was no different from most Korean places. The marinade was a tad bit too sweet for my liking. I ordered the short ribs ssam style to include some lettuce, ssamjang and garlic but they missed out on the garlic and decided 3 pieces of lettuce was good enough. \n\nHaemul Pajeon - $16, about the typical price you find anywhere. Cooked to perfection and arrived somewhat crispy and not to flimsy, just the way I like it. Though this was lacking a lot in flavor and wouldn't recommend it. \n\nOverall, average Korean food and extremely over priced. Well at least the kalbi was.", "author": "Vince L."}

If you're not a native San Franciscan, you've probably only heard of the area because of Joe's Cable Car Restaurant (now defunct) that was featured on The Food Network. Good riddens with your $20 crappy burger served on a plastic plate, $7 sharing fee, and side of stank face. \n\nAside from awesome taquerias, Excelsior's food scene is non-existent until Hwaro soft opened a month ago. The menu is a mix of traditional and fusion Korean dishes (from Kimchi Jjigae to Korean Tacos). Prices are reasonable for SF standards and portions were generous. It's currently BYOB until they get their liquor license so definitely stop by Kukje beforehand and bring in soju and beer. Reservations accepted. \n\n~ * ~ F O O D ~ * ~\nThe banchans: kimchi  and cucumber salad were weak which is usually a bad sign for a Korean restaurant but the food turned out pretty decent. I like that they provide you with lettuce wraps upon request and they have purple rice (yay!) but they charge you $2/bowl bit.ly/2dE0nkp. \n\n*Kalbi: Marinated Beef Short-Ribs (LA cut) w/ banchan, lettuce for wrapping ($25) - 4.5 STARS\nbit.ly/2dC2mjY\nThe table's favorite, the Kalbi was perfectly marinated and grilled. Each savory sweet piece was nicely charred, marbled, and very tender. On par with the Kalbi I've had in the South Bay. \n\n*Taco Trio w/ bulgogi, spicy pork belly, kimchi, lettuce ($8) - 4 STARS\nbit.ly/2dp8cqL\nA really good value since there were generous amount of tender bulgogi and pork belly but the marinades were both sweet. A wedge of lime would have been perfect to cut through all the sweetness. \n\n*Korean Fried Chicken: Half Garlic, Half Sweet-Spicy ($16) - 3.5 STARS\nbit.ly/2cNwLL7\nWe requested half regular and half sweet spicy but received the garlic instead of the regular. The KFC batter is thick and crunchy and the chicken was moist and juicy. It was underseasoned but I prefer that over it being overly salty. The garlic mixture was raw, minced garlic and sugar. It was unappetizingly astringent and cloyingly sweet so we scraped it off. I didn't try the sweet spicy one. Accompanying pickled daikon was great - crunchy and nicely pickled.\n\nKimchi Fried Rice w/ pork, sunny-side up egg, seaweed ($12) - 3.5 STARS\nbit.ly/2d8MMw4\nThe fried rice was on the bland side since the kimchi was mild and not very fermented, but the perfectly cooked egg with an oozy yolk added a nice, creamy \"sauce\".\n\nSamgyupsal Gui: BBQ Pork Belly, spicy sauce ($19) - 3 STARS\nbit.ly/2cXBRIb\nIt was a pretty large portion of pork belly but it was chewy and the \"spicy\" sauce was more sweet than spicy. \n\n*Haemul Pajeon: Seafood Pancake w/ shrimp, squid, chives ($14) - 2 STARS\nbit.ly/2dDYfJb\nThe pajeon wasn't thoroughly browned and there was too much batter so it was doughy. Squid was chewy and there weren't any shrimp as per the menu. Dipping sauce (soy-vinegar) was good though. \n\nKimchi Jjigae: Kimchi Soup w/ tofu, veggies, pork belly ($12)\nbit.ly/2dL7k2x\nI didn't try any but my friends seemed to enjoy it. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nAll the servers were green but very upbeat, friendly, and attentive (kept our water glasses full). I brought a birthday cake as a surprise for the birthday girl and the server asked the birthday girl, \"Did you want me to bring out your cake, or did you want to save it for another time?\" \n\nFAIL.  \n\nUnderstandably mistakes happen but going forward, they should pull aside the customer who brought the cake or wait until the customer asks for it. \n\nSince it was a busy Saturday night and there was a constant flow of customers, it would have been nice if the owner was proactive, pitched in with her staff and/or interacted with customers. Instead, she was having a full, sit down meal with her dining companion at the bar for the majority of time we were there (2.5 hours). Obviously, her restaurant, her rules but it came off unprofessional.\n\n~ * ~ A M B I A N C E / D E C O R ~ * ~\nThe space is minimalist and hipster. Good for parties of 2-4 and there's two communal tables that fit 6 people each. When we arrived, the ambiance was very upbeat and lively with the pop music that was playing...just as any fun Korean restaurant should be (like Playground, Tonight, The Spot, and Toyose). \n\nThe music soon turned into odd mix of slow, depressing jazz tracks when the owner started having dinner at the bar. Since the music was dampening the mood, my friend's bf kindly provided feedback to one of the servers. She spoke with the owner who changed it for half a track, then changed it back to the slow, jazz music, and returned to dinner with her dining companion at the bar. Again, her restaurant, her rules but she didn't seem receptive to feedback which is unfortunate. \n\n~ * ~ P A R K I N G ~ * ~ \nDifficult street parking. \n\nHwaro is the first and only Korean restaurant in the area serving pretty solid food.

I went with a big group, so I was able to try a good portion of their menu.\n\nFavorites!\n- Taco trio: love fusion tacos! These were filled with variations of lettuce, kimchi, bulgogi, spicy pork, and a creamy mayo-based sauce to tie everything together. \n- Garlic pork belly BBQ plate: We were debating between this and the galbi, and I'm so happy we went with pork belly! Tender and flavorful, and went well with the lettuce wraps (wish they gave only lettuce, the cabbage included was odd). I enjoyed the mini trio of sides that came with it (kimchi, cucumber, sauce) to enjoy the pork belly+lettuce with. Highly recommend! \n- Seafood pancake: Although I wish it was a tad bit crispier, this was delicious and made for a wonderful appetizer. Dipping sauce was yummy--I wish it came with more!\n\nOthers:\n- Kimchi cheese: Okay, I LOVE kimchi, but keep in mind that a lot of their dishes already come with kimchi. This dish was kimchi-overkill, especially noting that the majority of our dishes had or came with kimchi. I would pass on this one, and would try their cheese corn instead for some variety.\n- Kimchi fried rice: It was good, nothing extraordinary. Standard kimchi fried rice that didn't have any wow factor for me.\n- Garlic fried chicken: The garlic is apparently sweetened with combined sugar, but it just tasted (and definitely felt) like raw garlic to me. I would pass on this one.\n- Sweet n' spicy fried chicken: If you like a lot of sauce on your wings, then this might be for you! Personally, I would love to try their regular bare fried chicken instead--the meat itself is indeed crispy and juicy!\n\nI can't wait to come back for more; would love to try their korean ramen and especially the hangover soup that everyone raves about!", "author": "Kris C."}

While I wouldn't go as far as to say that this is the best Korean restaurant I've ever been to, Hwaro had one of the best kimchi soups I've ever had. Seriously, it was revelatory. Extremely spicy with a little bit of sour/citrusy tang. It reminded me of the Tom Yum soup my mom made for me growing up. \nOften kimchi soup can end up tasting like cabbage soup that's slightly spicy, bc I think the kimchi juices slide off and the chef doesn't add more of those flavors back in, but this was not the case at Hwaro. The kimchi soup at Hwaro was totally full bodied in flavor - spicy, sour, and savory. Soup like this is difficult to replicate consistently so I'm curious to see if it will be as amazing next time around. \n\nThe japchae was really good too...but that soup, man.

We ordered the French Fries (topped with kimchi), Taco Trio, Kimchi Fried Rice, Japchae, and Kimchi Soup. Yes, I know, that's a lot of food for two people! \n\nThe french fries were the first to come. A third way into the fries my boyfriend mentions that these fries remind him of McDonald's fries. He spent the rest of dinner convincing himself (and me) that these fries are old fries (when I say old, I mean fries that have been left out for a few hours) from McDonald's. Everyone knows what leftover McDonald's fries tastes like, and these kimchi fries definitely tasted like that. Don't get me wrong, the fries were pretty delicious (although it would've been better if the fries were waffle fries, so it can hold the kimchi and sauce more)! But the thought that these fries may have been possibly from McDonald's was just so shocking. \n\nAnyway, enough about the fries. The Taco Trio was very flavorful. It's an appetizer, but I think it's enough to be a meal on it's own. Kimchi Fried Rice was pretty good, good amount of spiciness but lacked a bit of salt. I was not a fan of the Japchae. I don't eat Korean food often so I'm not entirely sure what it's supposed to taste like, but the noodle texture was just not that good. I only had a spoon of the Kimchi Soup and I thought it was extremely sour. Not sure if that's what it's supposed to taste like, but my boyfriend enjoyed it.", "author": "Lina C."}

The sweet potato with mayo that they serve as an appetizer was weird. Such a weird thing to serve, or is it just me who thinks it's odd? My bf and I ordered the kimchi fried rice, japchae, and the half and half spicy chicken wings (garlic fried and sweet spicy). Favorite dish out of the three has to be the kimchi fried rice. Can't go wrong with ordering this usually. However, the japchae was not good at all. I thought it was just me, but shortly after, my bf commented the same. For the fried chicken, the garlic fried chicken just had a slab of minced garlic placed right on top. When I ate it, didn't know it was going to be like that so I bit right into a huge mouthful of garlic. It's weird how they just put the garlic all on top in one huge chunk. As much as I looove garlic, that was mehhhhh. The sweet spicy flavor on the other hand, was actually really delicious. For the price and the food, I'd much rather go to another Korean restaurant. Service wasn't too great either. However, glad I was able to try this place and unbookmark it.", "author": "Annie H."}

YES!\n\nI was a bit upset when I saw Goldilocks close. I had recently been there and while it was my third favorite Filipino restaurant in Excelsior, they did introduce me to some new stuff.\n\nMy mood changed when I saw the sign on the door saying the new place was Hwaro, a Korean restaurant. Excelsior has Filipino, Japanese, Thai, Laotian, Vietnamese, all types of Chinese. But we don't have Korean. \n\nLet alone one that serves alcohol.\n\nThis week they are going through a soft launch - they don't officially open or have a working credit card until 9/5/16 - but are taking customers. The lunch menu is very different from the dinner, which also explains the large break in between.\n\nWhen I walked in on a Tuesday, there were a few groups eating - and I do recommend coming here in a group or on a date so you can try more. I sat by myself and spent time on the menu. They have a number of small plates that sound great like the Taco Trio, gyoza, and asparagus because something has to be green. \n\nThere are also big plates which are must shares. Three types of KFC (Korean Fried Chicken), kimchee fried rice, seafood pancakes, tonkatsu. They have Korean ramen and a Hangover Soup! \n\nI went with the sizzling BBQ eel. I love eel, heck I've had eel fried rice directly across the street. The great waitress warned me it was only 6 pieces but that was enough for tonight. Along with it came some lettuce to make wraps, some banchan, and I ordered a side of rice. It was delicious and it will be hard not to order it again.\n\nOr live out a dream and special order a BBQ eel taco.\n\nAfter finishing up I got to talk to the two waitresses, the owner Ina jamming out to classic bossanova, and the head chef Ryan. They explained some of the backstory, how they will soon be getting three types of Korean beer (including Hite!), shoju, and wine, and that the neighborhood has welcomed them. \n\nI really like Hwaro and feel it not only adds a culinary option to Excelsior, but adds a more modern option as well. With Rocks Den, Sushi Raw, and now Hwaro, this part of Excelsior is getting some gentrification. Not white people (says the white person), but more gentrifying for Millenials - modern locations with a modern vibe. I don't want the area to be completely changed - I may actually be addicted to Baby's lumpia - but I like that we are getting options to take groups or dates to. Excelsior isn't only for cheap lunch, and Hwaro helps this.\n\nUPDATE: I came over for lunch and got the sweet and spicy fried chicken bento and the pork belly quesadilla. The bento came with side salad, some of the least greasy japchae I've ever had, two dumplings, rice, kimchi and 4 wings covered in sauce. Ask for extra napkins! I definitely got a lot of sauce on my face/beard. The wings were cooked perfectly, and the sauce was both sweet and spicy. Not bad for the amount of food I got.\n\nBut the pork belly quesadilla stole the show! I want one right now. Full of delicious pork belly, kimchi, cheese, sauce, and I want to say butter because it was decadent. Still can't wait to bring people here.\n\nUpdate 9/18: Took two friends here for dinner to finally get a group dinner going. We got:\n-Corn Cheese - basically a skillet filled with sweet corn and mozzarella cheese. Two things I love\n-Gyoza - I'm a sucker for dumplings\n-Rice Cake Skewers - Because it was my birthday, the owner gave these to us on the house, and explained that growing up in Korea, this was one of her favorite street food snacks. We got two skewers with about 5 rice cakes on top, covered in the sweet and spicy sauce from the chicken wings. If you like sweet and spicy, these are really good, a bit chewy. Glad I got to try these!\n-Kimchee Pancake - one of my guests doesn't like seafood, which is why we got this. Turns out he also doesn't like kimchee, SMH. This was delicious.\n-Kimchee Fried Rice - yeah, my friend didn't have the best meal, but his loss. This was delicious, spicy fried rice with some seaweed which gives it a really interesting flavor. But man that pork belly is so good.\n\nOh, and for my return trip I was recommended trying the miso pork belly.\n\nAlso they have the cleanest bathroom in Excelsior.", "author": "Michael C."}

We were craving Korean food and had to quickly pick a random place nearby that was open since most Korean restaurants close midday. We eventually found this place that looked really nice from the pictures. \n\nWe arrived to the area and I'm being serious when I say the location was really sketchy and scary. My friend got hit on by an old man, another old man waving at us from above his apartment with a Chucky doll, and there were even boys calling us from across the street. No joke, this all happened just walking 2 blocks down to the restaurant. I know this doesn't have anything to do with the restaurant itself, but I thought I would mention it just for the safety of it.\n\nAnyways, we came in and it was pretty empty except for 3 middle aged and elderly men sitting near the counter(?). We all thought they were employees at first, but they kept staring over at our table. Literally without any shame. They even turned around to watch my friends walk towards the bathroom. Overall, for the location and experience I would have given it a 1 or 2 star(s).\n\nNOW ONTO THE FOOD. My friends ordered bibimbap, taco trio, and kimchi fried rice with pork (?), while I ordered tteokbokki with ramen. I can't speak for my friends' meals, but they all really liked their food. I also really enjoyed my meal as well! Maybe personally for me, the sauce was a bit salty, but I still enjoyed it. \n\nLastly, the service was pretty good. Not amazing, but better than most places. They were very friendly and kind. The only issue was that they were a bit slow and didn't seem to pay attention when we called them at times even though the restaurant was empty once those creepy men left. \n\nI was debating on giving this place three stars, but despite everything, I still liked the food, so four stars it is lmao!", "author": "Sharon T."}

The fried chicken was expensive at $17 and I was hesitant to get it because of that, but my friend said let's just go ahead and try it because you can't go wrong with fried chicken. Well, this fried chicken just wasn't that good. I felt like the batter was too thick and a bit flavorless despite the garlic it came topped with. I can understand using a thick batter to get a good crunch to the chicken, but I really didn't enjoy it. :(\n\nThe tteokbokki was drowning in a sauce that had a strange artificial and syrupy taste that I didn't enjoy either. It came served in a big, wide bowl, but the actual portion of rice cake seemed a bit small for the price.\n\nAnother problem I had was with the seating at the tables to the left hand side of the restaurant. The tables were so uncomfortably close to each other! I felt like I was having dinner and listening to the drama of the diners intimately next to me. There was so much space in the middle of the room being unused. Why? Is it for special events?\n\nThe food wasn't good and it was expensive for the quality. Definitely not coming back and not recommending Hwaro to others. Sorry.

Most likely this restaurant was opened recently, since this area was known for their empty storefronts that sat empty for years. This is literally the only Korean restaurant in the Excelsior. I believe that this restaurant took over the former Goldilocks Bakery space. Walked into the restaurant and noticed the divey and hipster look with a bar on the right that serves beer, wine and soju. We ordered their Sweet and Spicy Fried Chicken and Tteok Bokki (Rice Cake) with Ramen. The Fried Chicken had a very nice breading and the sauce was not too spicy. The Tteok Bokki had a similar sauce to the Fried Chicken, but was not as spicy. We also added ramen to the Tteok Bokki, but the portion of ramen was very small. The service here was okay for a Friday night with not too many customers. The service was not very attentive, despite there being two waiters working and three tables occupied in the restaurant.

Customer service was a bit lacking as  I had to keep waiting for the waiter.\n\nThe four stars is reflected only on the quality of food. Ordered the kimchi fried rice, which tasted decent but it's far from the best I've had. It wasn't too spicy for those heat lovers and the flavors were definitely there but the price was a bit much for my liking. \n\nCustomer service would've definitely dropped this place to a 3.5 stars but it's still not a bad Korean restaurant to check out in the end.", "author": "Anson L."}

Not many other restaurants besides mexican or chinese food, so korean was a welcome change.\n\nThe interior and decor was very unexpected in a good way.  Modern and minimal design with large open space. \n\nThings we ordered:\n\n- Rice cake skewer\nfried/grilled korean rice cake with a sweet spicy sauce.  Texture was great, crunchy outside, gooey inside.  Sauce was nice and balanced.  One thing I would suggest to make it even better is to add some green onion slices in between the rice cakes. Also some sesame seeds on top.  I think that would bring out another level of flavor.\n\n- Grilled eel plate\nComes out with dipping sauce, ginger, and lettuce to make wraps.  Awesome flavor and perfectly cooked.  Highly recommend getting this.\n\n- Garlic and sweet spicy fried chicken\nFlavor of the sweet garlic sauce was good.  Sweet and spicy sauce was similar to the one on the rice cake skewers. The chicken is pretty big and filling. The batter is pretty fluffy which makes the chicken look massive.  \nPersonal preference here, I don't prefer fried chicken with this fluffy kind of tempura batter, wish there was less batter or a different kind, my go to standard for asian chicken wings is at SO.  But with that said, I know others like this style, and the batter/breading was done well.\n\n- Cold bibim buckwheat noodle\nFlavor was good and the sauce was nice and balanced.\nOne suggestion is that it did not come with a hard boiled egg, or a slice of meat, which I think would complete the dish.  Also the portion was pretty small for the price, especially considering that an egg or beef slices were not in the dish.\n\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the restaurant especially considering it being in the outer mission area. I would give this place 3 1/2 stars, but bumped it up for location, service, and since it only just opened.\n\nDefinitely going to come back to see how it progresses, and once they get their liquor/beer/wine license. They have a nice bar setup, and hope they have some nice beers on tap (always goes good with fried chicken).", "author": "Baek C."}

It wasn't too busy--we got a table right away, but it filled up as we were there. We ordered the taco trio (it was not really my favorite. I'd skip it next time), sweet and spicy fried chicken (Korean fried chicken is so damn good), and pork belly. There was a mixup in the kitchen and we didn't get our pork belly, but they were very apologetic about it and brought us free seaweed salad (REALLY GOOD), and we'd definitely over-ordered and by that point we were too full for it anyway. The vibe in there is really nice and the service was maybe a little slow, but we weren't really in any hurry. Overall really good experience, even with the mixup over the food.

Fried chicken wasn't bad - tasted like typical buffalo wings, except they were gigantic. We had the garlic and spicy and sweet. Both weren't bad - better than Buffalo Wild Wings for sure.

I would say my favorite things to order are the Pork Belly, Yuk Ge Jang, and all of the fried chicken. \nFOOD:\nPork Belly: Umm yes I'll have another round! I am someone who typically does not enjoy pork at all and I almost always order this dish. The miso one is the best I would say. It has a salty miso flavor and the meat just melts in your mouth. No regrets when I get this.\nYuk Ge Jang: This is perfect for the cold gloomy days of San Francisco. I'm in love with spicy food and this is the perfect amount of spice. It's the perfect balance of spicy and salty. The portion of this soup blows my mind, I'm a big eater and I end up with leftovers.\nFried Chicken: GET IT. I like getting it half garlic and half sweet/spicy. For those who claim to like garlic and complain about the amount of garlic that comes on the chicken.... you're clearly not the garlic lover you thought you were. I love mixing the sweet/spicy sauce and the garlic together to get that all in one burst of yummy flavors.\nKIMCHI: Hands down the best kimchi I've ever had. It's house made by owner's mother so that must be why. Nothing like a mom's touch.\n\nSERVICE:\nThe wait staff is always super friendly and are always ready to answer the millions of questions I have. Some nights when I come in it is pretty hectic with a full house but I can tell they are trying their best and that's all we could ask for really. I've seen the owners floating around the restaurant from time to time and they are always so sweet to their customers.\n\nAll I have to say is try this place out and thank me later.", "author": "Siren L."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-05-12", "description": "Hwaro is a sure hit - their focus on quality of ingredients is a rarity among Korean restaurants in SF (and even greater Bay Area). If you're just looking for your typical Korean BBQ on a grill and copious amounts of mediocre banchan, this is not the place! You're not going to leave with uncomfortably bloated stomachs, mild ulcers and/or numbed tastebuds from overindulgence of spices. Newsflash non-koreans, that's not what makes Korean food great. If you actually care about the experience of authentic, refreshing and innovative cuisine, check it out.\n\nGalbi - I usually don't get ribs at restaurants b/c hey... i can make it too. The meat was just the right amount of juicy and sweet, with the familiar taste of smoky grill. But what makes this one special is the napa cabbage accompanying the meat. It's so sweet and fresh! I'm so sick of the typical lifeless (and pesticide-lain) cabbage at other korean places, and I usually don't touch them. However, with the right amount of doenjang (soybean paste) and a morsel of meat... the refreshing crunch of the cabbage was so good! mmhmmm!\n\nStuffed Mushroom - this was an innovative dish that caught my eye. You get a large portobello mushroom stuffed with bulgogi and cheese on top. Great appetizer and intro to Korean flavors!\n\nYukgejang - this is a semi-spicy soup that reminds me of my grandmother. Again, I don't order this at restaurants because most of them put too much korean pepper flakes in the soup making your stomach pretty uncomfortable later. This place puts just the right amount of pepper - you get that crisp & spicy flavor that soothes your nostrils (this is my best attempt to translate a korean phrase to describe this type of spiciness; it has no equivalent english words) without feeling bad about yourself later on.\n\nThe highlight of my experience was the dessert! We got warm hotteok (korean street food - basically sugar and cinnamon in a pancake that's fried crisp on the outside and gooey and sticky inside) and vanilla ice cream. I can't believe I never thought of this combination! Imagine an asian version of crepe with cinnamon & sugar a la mode. It's sprinkled with matcha to add a little kick to the taste and nuts to round out the flavors.", "author": "S H."}

The two waitresses were SUPERB. Brought food quickly, checked on us regularly, and graciously fulfilled all our requests (\"Can we have more napkins?\" \"Could we get a refill of water?\" \"Could we also get some hot water?\" \"Could we get some plates?\" \"Actually, could we get bowls instead?\") It was at the point where we felt bad for asking, but they never once showed annoyance. Freaking fantastic. I'll come back to the customer service in a bit.\n\nFood was yummy, even for our impaired taste buds (remember how some of us were sick?) We ordered 2 seafood ramens, 1 spam ramen, 1 kimchi fried rice, 1 wakame salad, and a half-and-half order of fried chicken composed of sweet-spicy, and garlic. Seafood had LOTS of great seafood in it (mussels, shrimp, squid) and was quite flavorful. Not advertised as spicy, but it is mildly spicy. Spam ramen was also spot-on. Kimchi fried rice was delicious, but portion felt a little small (everyone gobbled it up though). Advertised as spicy, and also felt mildly spicy. Wakame salad was your standard seaweed salad, but it was stacked pretty tall. Felt pretty good for $4. Fried chicken was so delicious, even though some of us had to peel off the fried stuff cause of our sore throats :( :( STILL freaking good.\n\nNote: it IS a fusion spot, so we didn't get the usual Korean appetizers that come with the meal. Not a big deal to us since the meal itself was super yum.\n\nPrice? For the 5 of us, after tips and tax, we were sub $100. Probably because we chose some of the cheaper menu items. Regardless, DEFINITELY worth every penny.\n\nNow for the kicker. We ate around 7:30, and we finished our food round about 8:30 ish. We were taking our time, and it was luckily a quiet night. Waitresses never bugged us, never hurried us. When we finished, we did a White Elephant game, and then played Exploding Kittens (one of the gifts). Still, waitresses did not bug us or rush us. They brought the check over, and told us not to hurry. We played until about 9:30, then we went over to ask for a knife for our cake. We felt kind of bad since we had just paid the check and were now asking for extra service...But the waitress happily cleaned a a really nice cake knife (full tang, nice heft to the handle) and got a bunch of plates and metal forks (I was about to ask for paper plates and plastic forks though...). These ladies were really going above and beyond. We finished our cake, and then left an extra $10 for the trouble.\n\nTl;dr this place is freaking amazing, with absolutely phenomenal customer service to match the delicious food. Do keep in mind the contextual bullet points I started with.", "author": "Filmer Y."}

They were fully staffed.. I spotted about 6+ workers on the floor. Most were gathered behind the cash register. The 1st waiter came over and offered waters...but didn't end up actually bringing it. Another female server approached us after and offered menu and waters but forgot to bring the waters. Then she came back to take our order and later on brought us our drinks. We ordered 3 items in total: stuffed mushrooms, garlic pork belly and kimchi pancake. The mushrooms came out before we got our drinks. The utensils didn't get to us until we bugged the server for the 2nd time. We tried the first 2 items and agreed that the food was amazing! Before we could even finish the 2nd dish, another heavier set female server came over and asked us if we were ready for the check. We looked at her in confusion because it was clear we were still eating and waiting for the remaining dish. She went back to the kitchen to check on it...and realized they forgot our order. The owner came out and apologized while we waited. The 3rd dish finally came and we started to eat. Within a 10 min time frame, the heavier set female server came and rudely interrupted again and asked about the bill. We finally decided to get the check and a box to take our items to go. We didn't understand why she was being so rude when they had 30 min til close and the restaurant was still packed. She placed the bill on top of our to go box, did not say thank you, and rudely stormed off. Clearly, she has no respect for customers and shows zero appreciation for her job. The only reason why I would ever visit again is for the food and food only. The owner should really reevaulate who she hires. It makes all the difference when it comes to customer service and the reputation of the business.

What's wrong with that picture you ask? Chicken is flavorless, the outside coating is like a baggy giant coat hanging on the meat for dear life.  The garlic is plentiful... sounds like a garlic lovers' paradise however this big dollop of mince garlic is as raw as it gets and is somehow mixed with sugar but without any salt. The end result? Plain overpriced flavorless fried chicken that makes you cry tears of garlickyness with a hint of sugar.  (If you really want to order it please bring salt and pepper with you)\nThe redeeming seafood pancake:\nThe only reason why I am giving them 3 stars, the sauce was spot on.  The pancake was light, crunchy and with plenty of ingredients in there.  The calamari legs in there was soft and juicy, the cabbage added a nice texture to the light and fluffy pancake.

When often times some of these other restaurants either cook the same thing again and again or lose their DNA by overdoing the fusion thing, Hwaro is by far one of the best places by combining all the flavors, textures and presentations. I tried various dishes and they were all so delicious! The service is great; all various ingredients were perfectly cooked with the right texture and seasoning; the menu is so diverse and with each bite, you feel the love from a family run kitchen!", "author": "Philippe L."}

We might add that the restaurant was full around 6:30 PM on Saturday, and the noise level was not quite as loud as we had feared, in spite of families with children being there.  We were greeted warmly and had our reserved tables waiting for us.  The combination tacos, Portobello mushrooms stuffed with bulgogi were again outstanding.  We had japchae, a Korean clear noodle dish in addition to our usual Kalbi, spicy pork belly, Bibimbap, and the Hangover soup, which were all excellent.  Our friends also loved the food and the restaurant, a discovery for them. Glad we came back!\n\nPrevious Review, April, 2017\nAn outstanding Korean/Fusion restaurant with creative and flavorful food.  We came here from across town based on reviews because we wanted to find a Korean restaurant that was worthy of bringing knowledgeable friends, and the trip was not wasted.  Coming rather early on a Saturday evening, we were greeted warmly and had a choice of tables (They do accept reservations by phone, only when they are open after 5 PM).  We ordered the combination tacos (bulgogi+pork belly, bulgogi+kimchi, and pork belly+kimchi), Portabella mushrooms stuffed with bulgogi, Bibimbop (rice mixed with various ingredients served in a hot stone bowl) , Hangover soup (spicy beef soup), Pork belly and Kalbi (broiled beef short ribs).  They served three little banchan (side dishes), consisting of spinach, kimchi, and a special sauce.  This may sound meager, but all the three items were delicious - the kimchi was fresh and flavorful (best we had among all Korean restaurants in the Bay Area), and the special sauce consisting of miso and hot sauce and garlic was outstanding in flavor!  Much better than many more side dishes which all taste bland as in some other Korean restaurants I reviewed.  The tacos were outstanding as was the portabella mushrooms stuffed with bulgogi - these fusion dishes were so flavorful they would not be out of place in Quince or Benu (see my reviews of these outstanding restaurants).  They serve a bowl of lettuce and Napa cabbage leaves, which can be used to wrap the pork belly, kalbi, or bibimbop with the special sauce, adding a fresh, crunchy contrast to the hot dishes.  The pork belly and kalbi were both seasoned just right and delicious and the bibombop in sizzling hot stone bowl was also delicious.  The spicy beef hangover soup was also very tasty and satisfying.  They have beer and wine and Korean special beverages - Soju (tastes like weak vodka) and Makgeolli (milky Korean rice wine).  We had both Soju and Makgeolli, but wife wound up ordering Sauvignon blanc (a very good one- Joel Gott).  Although located in a somewhat gentrifying neighborhood, the restaurant has a clean,  modern feel with nice murals, though the chairs could be more comfortable.  The service was very friendly and prompt.  We would recommend this restaurant for foodies like us who are willing to travel a bit to find a truly satisfying gastronomic experience.  Definitely will come again.  Their website indicates they also deliver thru Doordash or Uber Eats..", "author": "Hoyle L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2017-04-07", "description": "Wow! The less said the better but this is more like a PSA so I'll elaborate. This place is Korean to the extent that I, an Indian male, could be Korean simply by changing my name to Kim Park or some other ridiculous stereotype. Do they play Bossanova? Yeah sure, but if I wanted to listen to Bossanova I wouldn't go to a bloody Korean restaurant would I? Can they make Kimchi fried rice? Yes but it turns out I can do it better if I were lost in the jungle with just some rice and kimchi and a rubber band. As in seriously better. And ramen? Sure they can make ramen but so did I when I was in college and used to buy the ready made ramen in the non-Asian grocery store. They literally didn't know what bori cha (roasted barley tea) is. And while they claimed that they added pork belly to the ramen, for which they charged an extra $2, that pig must have been starving because either they didn't give me pork belly or that pig did not have an ounce of fat on it's belly. \nTherefore: starving. As was I, after the whole thing was done because I couldn't stomach the idea that I had just had Korean food. Because I hadn't.\nThe service - well it's not the waitstaff's fault if some rich person decides to set up a restaurant which ostensibly serves Korean but in fact does not. They were trying their best but what level of service can make up for horrendous food? No level of service.\nNow if you want to listen to Bossanova and drink water or soju or beer, by all means go to this place. But if you want Korean food, you are as likely to find it just about anywhere. Maybe even at the Salvadorean place nearby. I mean the probability is the same because apparently anything can pass off as Korean just by giving it a Korean name and attracting gentrifying hipsters with Ikea decor and Bossanova?!", "author": "ch d."}

They must still be doing a soft opening as service is still somewhat lacking and the waitstaff could learn a few things. Maybe this isn't the best place for a big group-the food came staggered with me and another person's food coming first and then my last two co-worker's food coming a half an hour after we had already finished! The owner came out to explain why my friend's wings took so long (they had to re-do it) but no apologies. It was also hard to stomach seeing another friend's taco trio being delivered to a table of two that had come after us and had already two dishes on their table. So the service is spotty, how about the food?\n\n-Yuk Ge Jang: Bland, broth was watery. I was definitely left hungry after.\n-Pork Belly Platter: Flavor was very good, texture could be more tender. Questionable whether this was actually pork belly as there was hardly any fat and it was quite sturdy.\n-Seafood Pancake: I didn't get to try this, but my two friends really liked it and would recommend it.\n-Garlic Fried Chicken: Sweetened raw garlic slathered on top. Take away the raw garlic paste, the chicken itself was very bland. We think they added too much sugar to the raw garlic as it was almost sickly sweet.\n-Sweet & Spicy Fried Chicken: This was a lot better, more flavorful. \n-Taco Trio: DEFINITELY the thing to get here. Not only is it a good value (they give you a SHIT-TON of meat-for now-for the price), the meats were very tender, piled on and flavorful. I wanted to actually order this after I tried my friend's but was afraid that it would take forever.", "author": "Jenny W."}

The music was perfect and at just the right level. And then the food, wow! Every dish had honest flavors. I especially liked the  Rice cake Skewers as they brought me back to Korea. The Kimchi Soup will be my goto this winter on cold rainy nights. I also tried the Pork Belly  and Spicy Squid, both were delicious! The big Mushroom was stuffed with super tender and tasty Bulgogi And just when I thought I could not eat another bite, the Seafood  Pancake came out. It was better then the ones I had in Insa-dong.

I felt hella bad for my friends bc I chose the place.  The place itself is nicely decorated, clean, service was prompt and polite but the food was bleh.  It's more of a white-washed Korean restaurant and my roommate is Korean so maybe I'm spoiled by great tasting Korean food.  We ordered the Korean tacos, cheese corn, seafood pancake and the combo chicken wings (garlic and spicy).  The Korean tacos were good but too much mayo on them (the portions are also very small), the seafood pancake was ok only (not disgusting but not something I would order again), it wasn't crunchy enough, the cheese corn tasted good but the portion was so small, the chicken wings were moist and cooked perfectly but there was barely any flavor on it.  The garlic was basically fried chicken with minced garlic on top, the chili one was fried chicken w/the bottled chili-garlic sauce put on top.  It was the most disappointing thing on the menu.  I can't believe a chef would just put a blob of sauce on top and claim that as dish they found fit to serve at a restaurant.  The best thing was the tacos and the cheese corn but portions are very small.  I wouldn't go back again.", "author": "Honey S."}

The seaweed salad was delicious but very small; I could've finished it in one bite. The fries were solid especially with the spicy mayo. They brought out my kimchi and it sat there for over 25 minutes until they finally brought out my girlfriends japchae. The restaurant was not busy at all either. The people sitting next to us had come in 10 min later than we did and got their food before us. The only thing we were offered was a \"sorry about that small mistake\". The staff were very friendly but this was unacceptable in my opinion. I don't understand why they couldn't have offered a little more than a simple apology. If I were the waiter in a situation like this, I would not have charged the customer for the meal that came out 25 minutes late.

End up getting home and they had forgotten one of the things I ordered. I asked him to take it off my charge as well as the soggy fries. He told me that they can't take things off of checks they have to delete the whole check and rering everything and then run my card again.

Service was bad enough to actually warrant a yelp review. Very slow kitchen (45 minutes for a rice dish?). But the worst part was that the server ignored us to the point where I have to try to wave her down. She raises her hand to acknowledge and litetally returns to other tasks for another 10 minutes and never comes to check on us at all. I have to get up and walk to the back to check on my own order while my friends are already half way finished with their entrees. Awkward apology for the slow kitchen ensues from the other server when food finally arrives. To be honest, the slow kitchen wasn't nearly as bad as the lack of service.
