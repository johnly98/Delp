Came in the evening around 5, it was most empty, chill with a few people drinking. The ambiance nice. Mostly the decor is extremely unique with different pi\u00f1atas hanging from the ceiling and random painted portraits of animals behind the bar. It's literally the best place to get distracted and drink.\n\nThen by 7, things really picked up. The candles on the table suddenly made things feel intimate as the sun went down. You could snag a comfy booth or a nice table. AND best part was live musicians came in to serenade everyone! A guitarist and two different bands, mariachi?, came and each was better than the last. Great for drinks, dates, and hanging out!", "author": "Liz B."}

A tall margarita is more than enough to get a woman wasted. OK so I got my margarita, I noticed it was extremely strong so I asked one of the bartenders to top off the glass with sweet and sour, lemonade or something else. Not only it took like 10 minutes to get my drink back, but the bartender had no better idea than pouring real orange juice in the drink.\n\nI left this place wondering what was this person thinking of when he decided to ruin a margarita by adding fresh squeezed orange juice.", "author": "Melody C."}

Their margaritas are deadly, brings me back to the good 'ol college days... except that we were too broke to afford tequila ingredients. I meant as far as a great buzz for your buck.\n\nPresentation 5/5:\nI've never been inside a bar that had a layout or decorations specifically for the Latino culture, Asian culture, or any culture for that matter. So it was a bit interesting... There were pi\u00f1atas hanging from the ceiling, quotes littered the walls, and weird (creepy) dolls chilling all over the place. Very very cool atmosphere, busy on a Friday Night.\n\nCustomer Service 5/5:\nLaid back vibes all around. Usually, when you walk into a cash only bar and attempt to pay with card, they respond with something along the lines of:\n\"Cash only...if you can read.\"\nThe gentleman behind the bar was courteous, with thank you and pleases. Can definitely see why people come here (besides the deathmargarita). If the bartender is cool, then that's where you want to be.\n\nFood:\nNo food here, but the drinks are fantastic. The margarita's alcohol to juice ratio is at least 4/5ths of the glass. And that varies with some getting more. Honestly, I didn't get one but the group & bartender let me take a picture. Came here to wait for dinner reservations, couldn't end up crawling into restaurant.\n\nOverall, come here if you're looking for a nice drink with a laid back atmosphere.

Two of these will get you black-out drunk.

Cute tables and chairs.\n-clearly marked prices on the menu behind the bar-- when I'm running low on cash, do I have a chance to spend the rest of it on a beverage? Yes! \n-Good/bad for groups-- the company is always what I remember most fondly about this bar, but it's hard to talk to more than 1-2 people at a time.\n\nThings I hate about this bar: \n-_too many_ places to sit (it's setup like a diner)-- makes it real hard to get to the bar, or bathroom, or door without shoving people around (or being shoved around, which is also unpleasant). LAC: Take out the tables and chairs next to the bar-- at least on weekends! That can't be safe for fire code, either.\n-A popular, but unwise choice for a barhopping night, due to it always being the last bar (but packing a wallop on its own). \n-Maybe I've been coming here too long, but I remember when the margarita was $8.

Let's say that Latin American Club keeps the buzz going (or started, pre-game anybody?) with one of these pints in ya! I wish I started my night here!  \n\nThe decor of the place is good too. A bit dark, but with pinatas hanging above you (and not your typical donkey too), this place is quirky and yells San Francisco hip. There is a decent amount of seating at the Latin American Club, but you may struggle to find a spot if it is packed, which for a Saturday night, it is! \n\nI saw a lot of people try to use plastic here, but this place is a CASH ONLY establishment, but they do have an ATM located on the inside. \n\nOne comment is that on the Saturday night I was here, it was very stuffy and seemed to have poor air circulation. I hope they take some time to get that fixed!", "author": "Albert H."}

Well, they call it margaritas but it's actually just a cup full of ice and tequila with a smidget of margarita mix. It's strong, delicious, and will absolutely knock the sober out of you. \n\nIt's closer to the 24th Mission BART station than the 16th Mission station so there's less of a crowd and it's definitely not as turned up but sometimes that's what you want.

I used to come here before I would go out to El Rio on the weekends for their margaritas. \nHaven't been here in a few months and after my experience a few Saturday nights ago, I won't be going back.\nI have worked retail and food service jobs a majority of my adult life, so I understand what it's like to deal with rude, demanding customers and how to be cool and handle myself with tact in stressful situations. Never once did I insult someone or give them attitude when they asked for their money back or told me they didn't like the end product. \nMy 2 friends and I came in here for margaritas, since they're in pint glasses. Well apparently the price has gone up from $8 to $10 and now $12 for their regular margaritas. Unaware of the new $12 price, we decided to step it up a little and order 2 margaritas with Cazadores (not top shelf but not well tequila). \nWhen the bartender handed my friend the drinks and told her it was $40 for 3 drinks, she was understandably surprised. When she asked for the breakdown the bartender rudely said \"you ordered margaritas with Cazadores\", which are apparently $16 each and $8 for a regular size Bulleit Bourbon and Coke.\nAs we were getting the cash together, since we were all surprised, the bartender again gave us attitude and said she'd be back when we were ready. I'm usually a generous tipper but this time I refused to tip at all (she didn't need to make us feel like we were idiots or children). \nSo we decide to get past the rude attitude of the bartender and enjoy our drinks, unfortunately our $16 margaritas tasted like Margarita Mixer and very little tequila. I've had the regular margarita several times in the past, always strong and not too sweet. We tried drinking for a little while and only ended up taking a few sips, they were so sweet. We even had our other friend try it and she said she liked it, which means they weren't strong at all (she doesn't like the taste of tequila).\nI take the drinks back to the bar and when I ask the bartender to please re-make them, she gives me even more attitude, telling me that there are 5 shots of tequila in each one and pointed at the glass to show me that the tequila was roughly 2/3 of the drink. I calmly say okay and ask her for my money back, since she's obviously trying to argue that the margaritas are strong.\nFinally she hands me back the cash and walks away, as I'm counting I realize that she only gave me back $24 instead of $32. I wait and flag her down again and again calmly ask her for the correct change. Again she gives me attitude and proceeds to tell me that they were $12 each, I finally give her some attitude back and tell her \"No, they were the ones with Cazadores\". \nI'm thinking this ordeal is almost coming to close, when she decides to insult us after she hands me the correct change. As she's walking away from me, she says \"Those drinks were strong, you guys are crazy\".\nThat was the last straw and the reason that I have written this review. Nothing my friends or I did warranted the level of attitude and rudeness that the bartender gave to us.", "author": "Anica S."}

On a weekend night you can expect this place to be packed and smelling like a barn, but any other night it is usually pretty chill. \n\nLast time I went here me and my friend decided it would be a good idea to stand around talking about awkward things until a table became readily available. Somewhere between discussing Bacon Bra (Google it people!) and bot flies a group of people scurried out of the bar and we made ourselves comfortable. Lesson: Make sure you have enough horrendous stories gathered to clear the nearest table.\n\nThe drink I sipped was strong, but that doesn't really mean much when you only drink beer (IPA is the WAY).\n\nThe decor, as so many people have raved about, is amazing. Think if Michel Gondry and David Lynch had a baby together, and then that baby had a nightmare.

We ordered the drinks, $24, and I counted out the bills: 3 5's and 9 1's.\n \nI handed the stack of bills to the bartender, a 30-something brunette, who I would later learn was pissed off at the world. She walked to the other side of the bar, then came back a minute later and threw the 9 1's on the bar in front of me. \"You gave me 9 1's\", she said matter-of-factly.\n \n\"...Well, I also gave you 3 5's\" I said, confused. She immediately escalated the conversation to a ridiculous level of intensity, saying that she counted the money immediately after receiving it and that I was accusing her of stealing. I asked if she could maybe look around the bar to see if she had set them down by mistake, but she just got more agressive at the suggestion.\n \nEventually I said fuck it and started to pay her...again...adding another 20 to the stack of 1's. She refused to take the money, took our drinks back and told us to leave.\n \nSo all told, my 3 friends and I got a sip each of our drinks in exchange my $15 that somehow \"disappeared\".

While some of our local yelpers will be happy to know another place to get a big strong drink on the cheap, I prefer a bit more quality to my booze. Maybe even something that tastes like a margarita and not iced tequila with a lime slice.\n\nThe club wasn't exactly hopping.

I think I had been here before, but it was a long time ago, or it was a different place that looked liked this, or it was this place but with a different name.\n\nI'm quite proud of myself for actually reviewing a place in the 24th Street part of the Mission.  OK, this place is on 22nd, but I divide the bad old Mission into the 16th Street part and the 24th Street part.  I used to like the 16th Street part better, but then I've been to way more places there, so it's kind of unfair of me, seeing as I'm so set in my ways and often unwilling to try new places.\n\nBack to Alyssa G.'s birthday.  I was surprised how empty it was when we came in.  It was early on a Saturday night, but we were able to snag a big table.  The place filled up quick, and I had fun helping Alyssa G.'s friend trying to find pseudo-hipsters like herself to hit on.\n\nThe space is fun but way too tweeny.  By that I mean that the place feels like it can't decide whether it's a bar or a restaurant.  I know it's not really a restaurant, but some bar-ish booths would be nice.\n\nI felt all right being here because Alyssa G. is half Guatemalan and one-quarter Honduran (I think), so the birthday girl was 75 percent Latin American.  Most of this place's patrons were decidedly not Latin American, which I don't really mind but which is sort of strange and odd and typical in a San Francisco way.

Another highlight is the 21st Amendement Hell or High Watermelon beer they serve (in a can).  It gets fairly crowded on weekends but if you keep your eyes open you might be able to score a table.

They're cash only. Lame. The margaritas that they're allegedly famous for are WAAAY too strong and, well, nasty. In my oh-so-humble opinion. \n\nMy biggest issue, however, is absolutely the decor. It's dark, it's dingy, and it's full of the creepiest pinatas you've ever seen, plus these awful monster/mannequin things and the occasional taxidermist's masterpiece of some unidentifiable, unnatural-looking small animal. Oh, and there's a giant rat thing either painted on the wall, or it's a cutout. I can't remember exactly. But there's definitely a giant rat. \n\nSeriously, this is the stuff of nightmares. It's upsetting just to think about it. I'd say I'm sorry I don't have pictures to show you, but quite frankly I'm kind of glad that I don't. *shivers*\n\n*It's kind of not fair to give them a 2 star rating, it should probably be 3 at least, and for some people the freakish pinatas/awful margaritas might be a draw. But, as with all Yelp reviews, this is purely my subjective opinion of the place, and really says more about me than the bar itself. Not a fan of severed heads with X eyes hanging from the ceiling.

That this bar isn't full of brown people should genuflect on the last time you interacted with a Latino that didn't involve buying something (no disrespect to those looking for Latin Love, but this ain't that bar either).\n\nThis bar has the best pour in the City, and some of the best bartenders. If you're the kind of person who wants the \"realness\" of the Mission on a weekend night, then go here, you'll be embraced in the familiar tropes of striped shirt, bleached hair and teeth. Which is Awesome! (I can't help thinking though, that Tonic or Bliss would really get you where you obviously need to go. Just sayin'!) But for the rest of us, we already know how to navigate a neighborhood that gets ambushed on the weekends (I have sympathy for North Beach now). \n\nBesides it's probably an empirical fact. If you don't like the Latin, you live on the other side of the Caldecott Tunnel. \n\nDon't lie. \n\nI won't judge.\n\nI'm just sayin' the Skylark is bangin' on Thursday and Friday.

The US had just annexed California at the end of the Mexican-American war and the \"Californios\" then living here found themselves in another country without having moved a single step. What's worse they were now being overrun by scraggly Americano miners overcome with gold lust. \n\nThen Governor, Herbert McDougall, thought it would be a good idea, as a gesture of goodwill and electoral harmony, to build a club where Latinos and Americanos could meet, drink, dance and get to know each other, all while putting the tough times of the late-1840s behind them. On March 4th, 1852 a ribbon cutting ceremony was held and the Latin American Club was opened. \n\nIn attendance was the former governor of Mexican California, Jose Gutierrez Pico, who brought along, as a gift for the bar, 20 pinatas, many of which still survive today. Popular accounts of the day recorded that one pinata was smashed for every round of drinks from the new bar. This continued until drunken revelers became a greater threat to each other than to the colorful, candy-filled animals. \n\nAlso in attendance were famed 19th-century sportsman William Chinchester, who introduced the fast-growing sport of horseshoes to San Francisco, by way of an exhibition game at the opening of the bar that March afternoon, and renowned painter of dogs, Lawrence Crestwith, who presented to the bar a painting of his prized chihuahua, Max.\n\nThe Latin American has been a meeting place for friends and artists of all cultures ever since. \n\nOk, I may have made some (or all) of that up...\n\nBut, yes, I think this is a great bar as well. Who hasn't loved, lost or celebrated a birthday here? I've done all three... some more than once.", "author": "Nik S."}

No 'excuse me'...dude just looked right past us & plowed through. Were I a more unreasonable man, that would've been grounds for a roundhouse kick to the face.\n\nBasically, whole thing could've been solved if they would've just stacked the damn tables against the wall & made everyone stand like any other bar would.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-08-14", "description": "\"My Dad Comes Into Town For Business With Some Friends and then Proceeds to Drink Me Under the Table\" Part 3\n\nI have a love-hate relationship with hanging out in the Mission.  And by \"love-hate\" I mean \"pretty much hate, but I have to go there so often because that's where everything/everyone is so I convince myself there is some love there just so I don't have to hate myself too terribly but it can be hard to sleep at night sometimes I won't lie to you.\"  The Latin American Club, however, fits more into the category of \"bar I hate to love\" as opposed to \"bar I love to hate.\"  It can get horribly crowded so sometimes the idea of going here makes me cringe, but as far as the Mission goes (which is ALWAYS too crowded on weekends) I've actually had decent luck here.  And especially if you're able to grab a table, you're set.  The decor is a ridiculous hodgepodge of hanging things, the crowd is diverse, but mostly young and hip, you almost always overhear some hilarious conversation in line for the bathroom, drinks are decently priced and they aren't stingy with the booze.  I HATE TO ADMIT IT, but I think this is actually one of the few places in the City that I've been to a bunch and still managed to never have a bad time which is REALLY hard for me as I can be hard to please and like to make things difficult for myself - just ask any of my exes! (please don't.)\n\nSo when my dad was in town with his friends and the new boy had just met up with us at Kezar's and my dad's friend Andre is all \"SHOW US WHERE THE ACTION AT\" and I'm all \"BITCHES CAN YOU HANDLE THE ACTION????\" because I am pretty drunk at this point, what with company picnic plus baseball game plus two rounds of drinks and two rounds of shots with my DAD (don't forget that part) and all, not that I need an excuse to talk like a sailor in front of my dad, though he'd probably prefer that I \"watch [my] f***ing mouth\" (GOD we think we're SO FUNNY (SH*T I lost track of where this sentence needs to end!))\n\nANYWAY so there is a resounding \"yes\" to the question of being able to handle it, so we get in the boy's car (he's a trooper/keeper let me tell you!) and go to the Latin American.  This is where things get a little fuzzy for me, but I remember we got a table, got some good drinks, my dad and the boy tried to sing a Bob Dylan and Johnny Cash duet except the boy couldn't remember the words but that was fine my dad was too busy doing his terrible/fantastic Johnny Cash impersonation to probably notice anyone else, Andre made some more friends most likely, Geoff by this point was just laughing, I might have been asleep on the table - GOOD TIMES.  As per usual.  \n\nANYWAY, in addition to just being solid, I have to thank the Latin American for really saving my ass in the eyes of my father and his friends who after the Alembic debacle and the mediocre bar experience of Kezar's might have been starting to think that I am uncool.  The Latin American redeemed my image in the eyes of my father AND pushed me just over that edge of drunkenness for the evening such that I was able to trip on the sidewalk and end up with a bloody knee - my life and family are awesome!\n\nWoohoo!  As good as it gets!\n\nFor the Mission.", "author": "Ashley B."}

And I haven't been on the weekends - Thursday night is the closest I've gotten - the week night vibe fit my bill for a place I can sit down, have a brew (or strong drink - usually anyway), chat it up with a friend or two in a space that is big enough and filled up enough that there is some bustle and \"life\" around you..", "author": "Eric H."}
