One, if not at the very top, of my most favorite Italian restaurants in the city. Seriously, their focaccia would make my Nonna proud. I find every reason to go there - anniversary with my girlfriend, birthday, Saturday night out.  \n\nThe pizze is fantastic, especially the Funghi, - thin and a wonderful crust. As a vegetarian, I find that they accommodate variety well.  They are masters at dishes with mushrooms. The servers know their wines and never go wrong on the pairings.  The space is wonderful, touched with beautiful wooden tables, clean decor, and an amazing bar. And placed in the hip location of the Dog Patch, it provides a vibrant environment. Reservations are necessary, as it can get busy. \n\nSalute! Piccino!", "author": "John C."}

This place came as a recommendation from a trusted foodie, and every single dish that we tried was amazing. \n\nWe came here on a Saturday night with a reservation (made earlier that same day), and the entire dining experience was wonderful. The space is beautiful, and there were a lot of couples as well as larger groups of friends dining. \n\nWe ordered three dishes total, and honestly, I would recommend each and every one of them. The octopus is really tasty and if I had to pick a favorite, it may be the octopus. The funghi pizza is a safe choice for a larger group, and of course, it is delicious as well. Finally, the pork shoulder pasta and shishito was out of this world. Each time a new dish came out, we were prepared to be disappointed. We anticipated that the next dish would not be as good as the previous dish, and we were wrong time and time again.  \n\n1) octopus, marble potato, smoked paprika, lemon aioli, cilantro \n2) funghi: roasted mushroom, stracchino, shaved garlic pizza\n3) chiocciole, pork shoulder, shishito and gypsy pepper, horseradish \n\nThere's also free parking which is an amazing plus. We ordered three dishes and the total bill came out to around $80. It is definitely on the pricier end of things (although really not that bad for the quality of the food AND every dish was a hit).

In fact, the restaurant has a nice European feel and I really appreciated it. \n\nTo start, I split the chicken liver pate with a friend of mine and we both enjoyed it very much. Delicate and well seasoned with larger grains of salt made for a great starter. The trout caught my eye and decided to get that as my lunch main. It was seared with skin on and medium rare...perfect.

Both are really really good. \n\nTheir pizzas are excellent as well, I've tried the asparagi, the funghi, and the blanca. The funghi one is by one of the best tasting pizzas I've ever had, and I don't normally like pizza at all. Most mushroom pizzas are made with those cheap cremini mushrooms, but not the funghi here, this one is made with better, more expensive mushrooms. The asparagi is the most expensive and unique one, but the taste was just OK; I would pass on this. The blanca one is good, but very garlicky. The best thing about these pizzas is that the crust is super thin. The worst thing is that there may be too much crust ends. \n\nOverall, an excellent Italian place, if you get the pastas or the funghi pizza. Prices are also OK.", "author": "Jennifer W."}

Located in the Dogpatch area, this joint is known for serving up Italian appetizers, dishes, pizza, and the like. We ended up ordering the following: funghi pizza, pork & beef polpette/crushed tomato/parmesan (meatballs), strozzapreti/squash/currant/pine nut/midnight moon gouda pasta, and chiocciole/fennel sausage/braised kale/parmesan/chili pasta. \n\nAmbiance: The restaurant is pretty nice with both indoor & outdoor seating available. Indoors was well furnished & kept and the outdoor seating was just as great considering the warm mild weather that defines SF during the fall months (warmest months of the year in this area).\n\nNow onto the food! The funghi pizza was interesting. Personally, I'm a big fan of 'shrooms in general and this was indeed no expection (they're done well). The crust was thin but retained enough moisture that such was pleasant to eat without feeling like you were just eating pizza crust that felt too dry. Shaved garlic gave the pizza a little zest though there were so few pieces of such on it that its impact was minimal at best. \n\nPork & beef polpette/crushed tomato/parmesan (meatballs): Favorite dish out of the bunch. Crushed tomato was juicy/soft and complemented well with the parmesan. The meatballs themselves came out quite tender/soft/yummy/full of flavor. Would definitely recommend this dish to others!\n\nThe two pasta dishes were alright. For the strozzapreti/squash/currant/pine nut/midnight moon gouda pasta, I found such to taste just like pasta despite the squash added into the pasta & appreciated the mildness of flavor. For the chiocciole/fennel sausage/braised kale/parmesan/chili pasta, probably the best part was the sausage, which was cooked to perfection. The chili added a minimal kick though I found this one to be a bit too salty for my own personal taste.\n\nAll in all, a decent Italian restaurant to consider although I'm personally quite neutral about Italian cuisine since I've had it so many times in the past.

With so many Italian restaurants in the Bay Area, I can't believe I've waited this long to visit this popular one. After my delicious dinner there, I'm really kicking myself for not going sooner. It's truly a neighborhood gem. \n\nPiccino is located on Minnesota Street in the Dogpatch area of San Francisco. I actually really love this area of the city. It's not heavily crowded and my favorite ice cream shop, Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous is just a few blocks away! Parking is fairly easy on the streets. There's plenty of non-metered spaces everywhere. \n\nAs one walks up to the yellow outer fa\u00e7ade, one can already feel the casual hipster feel of this restaurant. Small tables of two line the side of the building, giving off a cozy and friendly vibe. The interior consists of an open dining room with a high ceiling which is filled with large orbes as lighting. There's also a bar area which looks into their open kitchen where all the chefs work together in harmony. This seems like the perfect place for a casual date or a group get together. We ordered our food and received them within a few minutes. Our server was nice and patient. They serve Sightglass Coffee too! That's definitely a plus in my book. Each item we ordered was really good, with the exception of the dessert. If it wasn't for that, this would be a five star review. \n\nSeared Octopus : This was a wonderful surprise! I didn't know octopus could taste this amazing. It wasn't rubbery or overdone. The exterior had a crispness while the interior was soft. The fingerling potatoes added another texture also. I would definitely order this again. \n\nSalsiccia : I took a chance on this as I really like a good Sicilian style pizza. It came out just as I imagined; crunchy thin crust with a good amount of their house made sausage spread evenly all over each slice. (That's one of my pet peeves. I need to have every ingredient spread evenly on each slice. : ))\n\nGrapefruit Float : Yes, it does say on the menu that it's Candied Grapefruit ice cream, but I really couldn't taste any of it. To me, it was just like plain Vanilla ice cream sitting in soda water. It wasn't worth the $8 price.", "author": "Julie W."}

We must have been the first or second party to order but somehow our pizza came after tens of other pizzas came out. I REALLY wanted to like the pizza but I just didn't. The crust was nice and thin and there were tons of mushrooms on it, but the type of mushrooms they used were just...bad. They had a really overpowering, pungent foot flavor? I'm not sure how to describe it but my friend and I had to scrape off all the mushrooms and douse it in leftover broth from the mussels to be able to stomach it.

Toward the end of our meal she sat a large party next to us at our shared table. The other party clearly didn't want us there (death looks/scooting their chairs into us, elbowing even though there was actually a ton of room) which made the last few minutes of an otherwise excellent meal uncomfortable. \n\nI don't blame the restaurant for that, but just think it deserves a mention in case you are someone who doesn't want to share tables ( if you are not okay sharing please don't! There are options here! You don't have to share if you're willing to wait a bit longer. Please don't ruin someone else's meal;  that's just mean!!)\n\nWith the exception of the last ten minutes of our meal, it was all very very good. We will be back.

I can taste the urge of extracting the humble ingredients to their greatest performance. In addition, the service is utterly pleasant. Our server is very attentive and nice, assuring us to have a wonderful dining experience.\n\nFood: My family order several dishes to share, from appetisers to desserts. First, the salad and the soup coordinate with the seasonal ingredients, like pears and nutmeg, warming up our appetite for the coming goodness. For the entrees, we ordered two pasta and one pizza. Both the pasta are the most outstanding ones I've tried! The al dente noodles and the refreshing sauce dance on one's taste buds. For the pizza, I'm a fan of their thin, crispy crust. Topped with the fresh ingredients and stringy cheese, the pizza conjure a graceful magic in my mouth. Fo desserts, we had the roasted pear, an elevated version of apple crisp, and brown butter hazelnut cake. I am pretty surprised to see how the pears plays out in the classic apple crisp. Yet, this dessert is on the sweet side, while the cake gives milky and creamy texture. Both desserts mark a perfect ending of our meals.", "author": "Jui Han Y."}

Not all of them are winners but this one is.\n\nI like the idea of shared plate. Pizza is always a good way to finish a big meal, but the salads are amazing and should be good to start. We had a bottle of Piseco, not bad.

The octopus is cooked perfectly with a nice char on the outside with a buttery finish on the inside. The flavor of the octopus is complimented well by the refreshing medley of vegetables and potatoes. \n\nBurrata - I'm not a huge fan of their version of burrata. I prefer burrata with tomatoes and served on grilled toast. Piccino's version looks and tastes more like a salad. Albeit a tasty and refreshing salad. \n\nBianca - By far the best pizza of the meal. This thin crust pizza is really cheesy and each of the different types of cheeses can be tasted. The shaved garlic is a nice touch adding a bit of kick to each bite. \n\nFunghi - I wish the topping on this pizza was placed on the Bianca. The funghi pizza lacks the cheesy flavor which I believe should be the core component of every pizza. Nevertheless, the mushroom flavor is prominent and quite tasty. \n\nFigura - We were adventurous and wanted to try fig on a pizza. The combination of the blue cheese and fig is great but maybe not so much on a pizza.\n\nApricot Shrub - The perfect refreshing drink for a hot day. The drink tastes like it's made from fresh apricots and it's not overly sweet. \n\n\n\"Less is More\" seems to be the core concept of Piccino. They take this idea to create refreshingly simple and light dishes. Each dish is very well executed with a perfect balance of heavy and light elements. However I do think some dishes, such as the Funghi pizza, may have been stripped too much. I do wish I had a chance to try their pasta to see how they applied the \"less is more\" concept.\n\nPiccino's interior is much like their food - light and refreshing. The interior is a well designed modern space with lots natural light throughout. The wood furniture adds a nice touch of warmth and makes the whole space feel very Scandinavian (hygge). On a good day, Piccino offers outside seating if you choose to dine al fresco. The whole experience feels very coherent as both the interior space and the food are one and the same. \n\nWhat I enjoy most about Piccino's is that you'll leave feeling full but not in a food coma.", "author": "Julian L."}

The venue is very large with a lot of seating so we were able to get a table for dinner even without a reservation on a Saturday evening. I like it when places aren't terribly full and when there is a lot of natural light. The staff here all very friendly and welcoming, which improved our dining experience for sure.\n\nWe started off with some bread with olive oil dip. It was delicious but I wish the portion were bigger! It just left me wanting more but it also wasn't very special. The main entrees were definitely the much more unique. We ordered a shell pasta dish with sausage and different vegetables and a white pizza. The pizza was so tasty and delicious. Although I hate paying a lot for fancy artisan pizzas, this one was so good that I felt it was worth it. The egg in the middle was cooked to perfection and was a nice addition to the pizza. I mostly enjoyed the shell pasta dish. The flavor was so powerful and rich but just kept you wanting more.

This pizza was basically just olive oil and cheese. It seemed more like a garlic cheese stick than a pizza to me but it still tasted delicious. We added an egg for an addtional $2. I didn't think it was worth it because the egg was just on the middle slice and didn't and any flavors to the pizza. \n~ Funghi pizza with added sausage ($17; 5/5): YUM! So many flavors and textures on this one. The added sausage gave that extra oomph to the flavorful funghi. When they say funghi, it's FUNGHI so if you are on the fence with mushrooms, I would not recommend. Like I said before, these pizzas aren't really saucy so you get to enjoy the toppings more!\n~ Baked egg ($17; 3/5): this dish was okay to me. Nothing special and definitely not worth $17.

The hostess said it would probably be 30-45 mins which I thought was reasonable. We decided to go to the coffee shop which is also part of the same building and restaurant, ordered two chai tea lattes and sat. I think it was only like 25 mins when they called me that our table was ready, we rushed back excited and hungry. They actually sat us on the bar looking table with the tall but rather comfortable stools, my mother in the other hand didn't like that much because she's very short and feels funny sitting on big tall chairs...but she made it work and said towards the end that they were actually rather comfy. We had some amazing wine that our very knowledgeable server suggested while we enjoyed the view of people making amazing looking plates and enjoying themselves while doing it. It's a wonderful thing to see ppl love what they do. Our food was every bit of amazing, my mother was happy and that's all I could ever ask for. Those meatballs were superb! I can't wait to go back!", "author": "Patricia H."}

After asking my very helpful waiter his recommendation he steered me towards a pasta which I honestly do not remember how to spell the name of but consisted of house made sausage, braised kale, breadcrumbs, and dill. Excuse my language but this plate was a god damn masterpiece- textually flawless, plate-licking delicious, flavors well balanced with some heat, perhaps a bit on the heavier side but hey it's pasta and we all know that's the goal. After trying my pasta, I placed a to go order for one of their pizzas to warm up later- I have no doubt they'll nail that too. \nA weird thing about me: Since i was a child I've always somewhat judged restaurants based on their lemonades. This lemonade is in my top 3 of all time, and trust me- I've had a lot of lemonade. \nYes this place is bourgeoisie SF at its peak but you knew what you were getting into when you walked in the door.

I swear to god, nothing was done to ANY of the empty tables during that period. It was totally insane.

Located in Dogpatch its pretty far from everything, but the great thing about this is that they have a parking lot right in front of the spot. \n\nI came here for brunch after making reservations on OpenTable and we actually got here way earlier than expected/our reservation, but they accommodated us and let us sit down earlier. It has such a cute ambiance that's very open with natural lighting, simple/modern design, and friendly service. We got a table near the window so it was great to people watch while we were enjoying our food and the sunlight. \n\nWe ended up getting the basket of warm pastries with seasonal jam/butter and the bianca pizza to share. The basket of warm pastries was delicious! They had about 4 various breads to try ranging from savory to sweet and paired with their jam it was heaven. You could tell they were fresh out of the oven and really thought about the flavors they paired within it. I know they sold some of them at their coffee shop as well but for the most part they did not because I wanted to buy some in bulk to take home. The pizza was also scrumptious as well! As a fan of thin crust they really out did themselves. The bottom was nice and toasted just how I like it and topped with just enough ingredients without being overwhelming. How can you go wrong with parmesan, garlic, and chili oil!? They even bring you pepper flakes that you can add on top which was awesome. \n\nWill definitely be coming back to enjoy this place again! \n\nHead over to the coffee shop after to enjoy some of their homemade chai as well.

I usually come here for dinner, but the brunch is decent. This is a review for their dinner.\n\nBread does not come with the meal and the focaccia bread appetizer ($6) is quite pricey. There aren't that many pieces. I would skip this.\n\nEntrees\nPiccino's pastas are good though as the other reviews say, the portion sizes are small. I could easily eat that and their pizza by myself. The pastas are around (~$20) and I very much enjoyed the cavatelli ($21). Is it the best pasta for the price? Yes, if you don't eat a lot; if you are a voracious eater, order the pizza ($15-$25). I recommend the funghi pizza; I love the balance of the mushrooms.\n\nDesserts!!!!!!\nThis place is definitely worth checking out just for the desserts.\nI've tried everything on their dessert menu. The best thing that I have eaten here is the Budino ($11). The portion looks small but it's filled to the brim with this butterscotch and light cream. I was skeptical with butterscotch because it tends to be overwhelmingly sweet; however, this custard dish was perfectly balanced: crunchy, creamy, sweet, and a hint of salty. The chocolate tart and pound cake (~$12) were okay; they aren't bad but not worth it in my opinion. Their tiramisu ($12) felt a bit dry. On another note, they change the desserts every few months; there was a plum cake a few months ago that was pretty amazing as well.\n\nIf you get anything at Piccino, get the Budino. \n\nThe only reason I took off a star was because the price was much higher for the portion size that I expected. If you are in the area, I'd recommend checking it out at least once. Maybe you'll get hooked on the desserts; that's what's got me coming back here.", "author": "Margaret H."}

Doesn't polpette require some bread to scoop up the sauce and to eat along with the meatballs?  The tomato sauce was bland and was more like chopped tomatoes.  \n\nAll the portions are small and the prices are pretty expensive considering.  The pesto pasta was good but didn't have the WOW factor that I was expecting judging from the presentation.  The pasta was topped with edible micro flowers.  Very fancy and again, it was a small portion. \n\nThe biggest disappointment though was the verdure crude which hardly made any sense to me.  There were some mini radishes, pickled beets, and baby carrots that were ontop of a smear of beet hummus.  Multi-grain crackers were included, but honestly it was messy and hard to share.  It would have been much better if the hummus was separate.\n\nPizza bianchi was good.  We got it with the egg and the center piece was the best part.\n\nThe wine by the glass and canned beer or on tap is very limited.\n\nObviously a disappointing experience.

The crust was a little soggy though.\n\nThe softshell crab: It was decent. I've had better softshell crab that was a little better seasoned and a lot cheaper. I'm not sure I would splurge on this again.\n\nThe zeppole (French beignets): I'm a sucker for desserts, so I really enjoyed this. A little pricey, but the beignets were very good.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-06-26", "description": "When SF Chronicle restaurant critic, Michael Bauer, removed Piccino from his annual list of the Bay Area's top 100 restaurants recently, his stated reason for doing so was that the menu - which had remained steady and solid - hadn't kept up to that of the competition.  Unlike other places that got axed from the list, he had no qualms about the solid goodness of the food to which he'd repeatedly awarded 3 solid stars (different rating system than yelp) in 2011 and again in 2013.  \n\nThis is akin to those times when a longtime, solid employee is suddenly dinged on a performance review for not keeping up with the latest trend to which I'd like to say:  who cares?  Good is good.\n\nPiccino is quite good.\n\nI think we're beyond the point that we need to describe the Dogpatch area and how perfectly this restaurant fits into the neighborhood.  This is the place I'd live at were I a financially successful neighbor.  It's the place I'd take dates to and later, once settled, it'd become \"our\" place.  It feels simultaneously upscale and casual and though it's Italian, it's not old-school-red-sauce-Italian.  It's modern and whatever anyone else might be doing on their menu, Piccino's menu is successful in its own right.  Reading through it then eating through it, words like \"fresh\", \"flavorful\", and \"lightly handled\" come to mind.  The food isn't heavy but it's perfectly executed and terribly satisfying.  \n\nA \"primi\" of cucumber, stone fruit, radish, mint, parsley, and sumac ($14) was delicate in flavor but a gorgeous mix of tastes and textures that I'd not have come up with on my own.  Is that not why we dine out in the first place?\n\nThen there's those things that I surely could make at home, but not with such artful finesse:  A pasta dish, Chiocciole (with fennel sausage, braised kale, parmesan, breadcrumbs, & chili; $22) was satisfying, with a spicy bite, and though I'd probably have liked more I think Piccino knows how large a portion ought to be.  \n\nNot on the regular menu - but if it is you must hunt it down and devour it - Ricotta Gnudi is something I've never seen or sampled elsewhere (take that Michael Bauer).  Pillows of ricotta cheese are somehow prepared like gnocchi and, hell, I don't have a clue how this is made.  I just know that Piccino's version had me longing to find this on menus all over town.  Should you find it on Piccino's ever-changing menu don't miss it.  \n\nDesserts?  Service?  Check and check.  All is good here and I'd welcome a return visit.   \n\nPiccino might no longer be on Michael Bauer's list but don't let that stop you from visiting.  On my list?

Wine selection is great -- especially their rose wine. The pasta is definitely homemade and everything here is pretty much fresh. Whatever you get - you wont be disapointed. \n\nWhat I recommend: \n- salad: garden greens, shallot, watermelon radish, herbs, red wine vinaigrette \n- pasta: creste di gallo, lamb rag\u00f9, pangrattato, pecorino sardo, oregano \n- pasta: e linguine, pancetta, asparagus, egg yolk, parmesan \n- pizza: aglio verde: green garlic, potato, rosemary, garlic confit, stracchino", "author": "Jenn L."}

The atmosphere of the restaurant got me really excited and I've had people strongly recommend it. For our first experience, the food was decent but the pizza was inedibly salty. Our second experience, the hostess was SO rude even before we opened our mouths, our waiter forgot to bring us our appetizers, never apologized and we waited for an very long time for even bread, while diners around us were served way before us. We eventually had to tell the manager who did comp us a few items but overall super disappointed in the experience. I won't be returning.", "author": "Danielle T."}

I can't quite put my finger on why, but I felt like I was having dinner at my friend's house.  This quality really sets Piccino apart from a zillion other restaurants in SF.  \n\nThe dishes are dreamily aromatic.  The sausage pizza was 100 times fresh & tasty, but I was disappointed w the crust.  I understand that the outside edges can be deceiving; they were appropriately crispy, but the rest of the pie was soft.  Thin crust should be firm throughout, yes?\n\nBut, the lasagna?  No misses here.  Fabulous.  The best lasagna I've had in SF.  Lighter than Italian Homemade, Marcella's Lasagneria, & Alimento (all outstanding in their own right).  The sauce was fantastic & the texture of this lasagna was absolutely pillowy, light perfection.  \n\nDon't skip dessert here.  They bake/make all desserts in house, in addition to cookies & pastry fare that they sell at their tiny cafe next door.  We ordered the apple walnut cake.  A touch of spice, moist, & served warm w fresh whipped cream.  It was a perfect winter dessert.  \n\nWe stopped at the cafe after dinner, & got a bunch of goodies to take home.  After trying the lemon cookies, & the oatmeal raisin, & the chocolate chip, & the fig newtons, & the chocolate marzipan cake, I can say that the fig newtons & the chocolate cake are exceptional.  I also appreciated the chocolate chip cookies being adult chocolate chip cookies; less sugar, more flavor.\n\nThe staff were all great.  Hostess, waiter, bussers.  Our waiter was informative, personable, & never rushed us.  This space is modern, but uber warm & cozy.  The sunlight it gets is positively gorgeous, & the lighting at night is soft & soothing.

The piccino bread was meh-- it's just bread and olive oil, pretty bland imo. We wanted to balance out the salad though, which was bomb. The fruits they added were a great touch to the slightly bitter greens. This dish was very refreshing and all the flavors meshed tog. We asked for no goat cheese and it still tasted good. The dish looked very simple but the flavors tasted complicated. As for the pork loin.. MmMmm. The meat was tender and the fat just melted in your mouth.

But the cookies taste divine, and are incredibly fresh so they're priced just at the tail end of me agreeing to pay it. Just a scosche more and I'd be like $3!

Now, that's not without trying: there've certainly been more occasions than that, when I've tried to have brunch here. Unfortunately, Piccino's popularity is not particular conducive to walk-ins or last minute reservation attempts, so some upfront planning is highly recommended.\n\nAnd it's easy to see why this is the case: the restaurant itself is comfortable and inviting, but definitely nicer and somewhat upscale. This is reflected in both the food on the menu, but especially in the prices: when you're paying close to $20 for an entree with the likes of some scrambled eggs and sauteed veggies, you know you're probably paying for a lot more than just the food itself, as tasty as it is.\n\nBecause of this, Piccino will unlikely ever be one of my top choices for brunch in my neighborhood, as your money will go a lot further at other nearby eateries, but if you're looking for something a bit more atmospheric (say, for a date), or something a bit simpler and fresher, they're well worth considering.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Another spacious restaurant with both seating and maneuvering shouldn't pose a problem.

Started off with a simple margherita smother in freshly tomato sauce, mozzarella, and topped with basil. My secondi is the slow poached halibut in basil-ginger broth, garnished artichokes, potatoes, and a little bit of lime. Finally, dessert of zeppole with side sauce of vanilla bean crema, meyer lemon curd, and huckleberry all in one. \n\nA simple place, serving simple foods, with happy simple friends.

Extremely refreshing, set me in a great mood for the rest of the meal. \n\nWe shared the burratta as starter, a perfect mix with peas and beans, plus mint and allium oil. It is probably one of my fav. burrata dish! \n\nWholesome Italian meals, we had brazino, prosciutto pizza, fregola sarda, and chiocciole.\n\nBrazino skin was beautifully seared. Fregola was cooked with clams, a very brothy, well balanced dish. Pizza was decorated with kumquat, which gave a freshness, balanced with the prosciutto. My chiocciole was amazing! It was al dente. The mix with braised kales and fennel sausages was nicely distributed, every bite had all the ingredients. The flavor was subtle, but complex. It is the most meaty dish among the 4, yet it was not heavy. \n\nDessert-we shared strawberry crostata with basil leaf ice cream from mr. and mrs. miscellaneous.... This is where the one star went missing.. The pastry was a bit too healthy, pretty dense and quite blend. Basil ice cream itself is nice, interesting flavour, but with crostata almost making it savory.... \n\nOverall, loved every part of the meal until the dessert.

This weekend, I tried the corn ravioli and it was most definitely the best ravioli of my life - it literally tasted like summer! The pasta was perfectly cooked, the corn filling was so creamy that I didn't miss cheese, the roasted corn kernels added a nice crunch, and the cherry tomatoes provided a sweet juiciness that complemented the dish perfectly. The padron peppers were a nice touch that added another flavor profile but the ravioli would have been fine without it as well. Not mentioned on the menu, but it's topped with basil leaves and thin garlic slices, which really bring the dish together given that the sauce is just a thin, clear sauce (note to vegetarians: it normally has chicken broth so make sure to ask for the vegetarian iteration). Our favorite pizza is the bianca but we also enjoy the funghi and zucca (seasonal squash blossom pizza). \n\nPiccino also has great dessert options. We were excited to learn that they serve Mr and Mrs Miscellaneous ice cream. Their current offering is the sweet cream flavor, which melts in your mouth and tastes like butter. We loved it so much that we had to order a second scoop after polishing off the first in a matter of minutes!", "author": "Janjri V."}

We were promptly seated and we decided to split the pastry basket and the baked eggs. \n\nThere were three small pastries and they were all warm. There was a small bread roll, a small (financier sized) banana bread and a small scone. See the theme here? Everything were small and the basket was $10. The pastries were good, but nothing special. I can make this at home. \n\nThe baked eggs came next. It was an egg baked in a lamb stew. It came with two small toasted rounds of baguette. We asked for extra baguette and they waiter didn't bring it until the end (plus they charged us $1 per small piece). \n\nThis place is so overrated. The food was very average and waaaay overpriced. Maybe dinner was better, but I get the sense that this restaurant is way more focused on where the ingredients came from than the actual taste of the food.

I'd say it's on the top of the list for restaurants in terms of atmosphere and ambiance. It's modern, slightly industrial, super bright and beautiful. I just loved looking at the architecture and light fixtures. Aside from how nice it is to have wine and enjoy great conversation, I'd say the pizza was okay. \n\nWe arrived earlier in the evening on a Saturday and decided to have some drinks before ordering. Service was really pushy; they didn't like that we took so long to order our meals. She came about 4-5 times to ask if we were ready to order. You can tell they're working hard to turn over.\n\nWe started with the bread and olive oil. That was a waste of the few dollars on the bill.\n\nWe went for two pizzas - the Pizza Bianca which I enjoyed. The cheese was salty, dough nice and chewy. Loved the combo of shaved garlic and chili oil, although it wasn't spicy at all. It still had a really satisfying flavor. The second one we ordered was the salciccia. I was little disappointed in this, but it was our fault for overlooking that it didn't have tomato sauce. The sausage was plain and overall I enjoyed the bianca way better.\n\nAlso, my partner and I drove all the way to Dogpatch from the northern part of the city one night and they stop taking new customers at 9pm sharp. Is this normal in SF? It was really frustrating. \n\nBottom line: boring pizza, beautiful place to impress someone, a little pricey. Service is okay.", "author": "Priti K."}

The pork and beef polpette is so tasty that I wish we ordered an additional one for myself.

My 3 friends and I walked in at 3:05PM and were promptly told by the staff that their brunch menu ends at 3, and we could order off their \"snack\" menu. We were hungry and there was nothing else close by, so we got a table (right by the drafty exit door) to order. \n\nOur server felt the need to tell us again that \"if only\" we had come in 5 minute earlier we could have ordered off that full menu. Thanks. That's what we wanted anyway...I don't see any reason why the server would tease a hungry group of people about this. \n\nNow, the food we did get was very good. I had the bread and olive oil and the cheese plate and I enjoyed both. I had to wave over our server multiple times to get our waters refilled.\n\nWhen it came time to settle our bill, we had 1 card and the rest cash. He asked if we wanted our change back, we said yes, and he kept it anyway saying it was \"only a few dollars\". Hard to calculate a tip when we didn't have the full amount, and I thought it odd that he'd ask if we wanted our change if he was just going to keep it. It was going to be his gratuity anyway, and it made me wonder if he was thinking we were going to not tip him do he was trying a pre-emptive strike to get some cash in his pocket?\n\nIt looked like a cute place but I doubt I'll be back after this experience.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-24", "description": "Golly Moses, has it really been 7-1/2 years since my first and last visit to Piccino? Back then, it was on the adjacent corner of 22nd Street and Tennessee where the Lab is now (...which by the way, sounds like quite an intriguing concept). It was a tiny cafe space where I recall that Jamie W. and I sat on a tiny table out on the sidewalk to split a pizza and a pasta dish. We had no idea they moved to the big yellow house on the other corner at Minnesota in an enclave with a women's clothing store and a wine shop right across from the new playground (photo: http://bit.ly/1BXoSx4). Such a nice space, very open, very Californian with a counter surrounding an open kitchen and large communal tables in the middle (photo: http://bit.ly/15sb4wc).\n\nIt's become quite a dining destination in Dogpatch, which is why another couple had suggested it for a dinner meet-up. You can still sit outside, but it was butt-cold that evening so fuggedaboutit. We were seated on a banquette next to a metal divider that made maneuvering out of it tricky. The server was the model of self-control expressing her enthusiasm for the dishes in a very measured fashion. I decided to start with the $14 Winter Citrus Salad with Fennel, Dandelion, Aged Goat Cheese and a Sherry Vinaigrette, which was a refreshing mix dominated by grapefruit slices though somewhat overpriced for the portion which was inexplicably scooted to one side of the plate as if it was on its way to the floor (photo: http://bit.ly/1B53lxa).\n\nSomebody was in a hurry. One of my dining companions and I ordered the same entree, a special that night, the $27 Roasted Riverdog Farm Chicken Breast, sliced in four pieces, sitting atop a Parmesan Risotto mixed with more Grapefruit, Warmed Radicchio and a Green Garlic Salsa Verde (photo: http://bit.ly/1CoL9To). That was an inventive dish, savory and succulent for white meat with the sweetness of the grapefruit providing a welcome balance. Jamie decided on the more reasonably priced $18 Pappardelle Bolognese with Oregano, which definitely had a meaty, earthy sauce you would expect but a bit hamstrung by the limpness of the pasta noodles (photo: http://bit.ly/15zndQl). No paisan was harmed in the making of that dish.\n\nEven Lidia Bastianich would have crinkled her ample forehead at such a wet texture. Our other dining companion went back to basics and ordered the $17 Funghi Pizze with Roasted Mushroom, Stracchino and Shaved Garlic (photo: http://bit.ly/1tbeE9d). I have to say the pizza is still the most satisfying item in their repertoire - crunchy, thin crust with flavorful toppings that don't overwhelm. She also ordered the $8 side of Sauteed Greens with Chili and Garlic. Simple goodness. Jamie had a side of his own, the $8 Fried Brussel Sprouts with Charred Leeks and Garum Vinaigrette, but he looked like he barely got any since the busman was hovering incessantly grabbing dishes as if the five-second rule applied to his job.\n\nIt was a major ding if you ask me. Our other complaint was the $3 surcharge for a shared bread roll which calculated to sixty-cents a slice. Not a dining phenomenon unique to Piccino, but I hate it as it's worse than not getting the complimentary water glass. Dessert pacified us as we shared three of them, and there was no grapefruit to be found. There was the old-fashioned $10 Peppermint Stix Ice Cream with Shortbread, Marshmallow and Dark Chocolate (photo: http://bit.ly/1urO9aW), which I thought was akin to a parlor treat sundae without the gloopiness of a sauce. Then there was the $9 Spiced Ginger Bread Pudding with Salted Caramel, Streusel and Crema (photo: http://bit.ly/1GOBx8Q).\n\nThat was a no-brain winner since it was a variation of the spiced ginger cake classic at Chow. Lastly, there was the $8 Zeppole with Vanilla Bean Crema, Meyer Lemon Curd and Huckleberry - five donut spheres, very lightly fried and powdered with fine sugar. They cleverly made the curd and crema look like a fried egg on the side (photo: http://bit.ly/1xPNu4t). Rounding out the meal was a $6 bottle of a 2013 De Forville Barbera d'Alba, which had a deep cherry flavor with a silky finish (photo: http://bit.ly/1EFGFqT). Piccino feels all grown up now like it's ready for its first prom worried it has to go to third base with its customers. I've got unnerving news for you, Piccino... I expect a homer.  \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...delicious neo-Italian fare with a few flaws, nothing irreparable though...pizza still heads the menu\nAMBIANCE - 4 stars....welcoming open space is a major improvement over the corner cafe they had years ago\nSERVICE - 3 stars...needs work, we didn't feel that special...and where did those Brussel sprout go?\nTOTAL - 4 stars...Dogpatch dining went up another notch in a big yellow house", "author": "Ed U."}

So go read her reviews if your feeling down, since they never fail to make me laugh and are informative as well. \n\nDinner for 2 on a weekend night, my friend and I ended up sitting at the bar since we didn't want to sit at the communal table. \nEasy parking right in front of the restaurant! \n\nI love the interior of this restaurant, wooden rustic tables, purse hooks, chairs, pumpkins for fall. I almost always will choose to sit at the bar if I have a choice, because I love watching the process of how they make the food.  The kitchen here is very clean and sparkly. \n\nWe ordered the funghi pizza, polpette ( meatballs), goat cheese and nectarine compote appetizer, and the chocolate cremeux for dessert. \n\nI love mushrooms so I knew we had to order this pizza, every bite had mushroom in it, and since the crust was the perfect density and size it absorbed all the delicious mushroom and cheese flavor.  I wish they gave more nectarine compote with the appetizer because I ended up with alot of extra goat cheese and not enough crackers or compote. \n\nThe polpette was so tender, and fell apart in my mouth, I usually don't like meatballs, but I saw several people had ordered them so decided to try them as well, I was not disappointed. \n\nThe chocolate cremeux was the perfect way to top off our meal, not too sweet, and a fantastic chocolate crust on the bottom.  My friend's iced coffee was one of the best iced coffees I've ever had, it had a strong, robust, coffee flavor, with the tiniest hint of bitterness.  They took time to make this coffee instead of just pouring hot coffee over ice, which I know many places do and which disgusts me because than the coffee becomes all watery and gross. \n\nYou must come here if you are ever in the Dogpatch area and are the slightest bit hungry, it would be a waste not to.", "author": "Tiffany Y."}

I want to think that most of those reviews are for the brunch or something like that because dinner was very disappointing. \n\nLet's start with the good part: the decoration is very nice. The waitress was nice. That's it. No wait, there's more. You can actually use Apple Pay with opentable to pay for your bill which is convenient. \n\nPizza was relatively small and dough was not very good. To be honest the pizza tasted like a pre-made frozen pizza from the supermarket. We had the margherita and the funghi. They looked very nice in the pictures but live it was a whole different story. \n\nThe service was also super super slow, even when there was hardly anyone there the waitress spent most of the time talking with the other employees instead of taking care of the customers. \n\nFor dessert we had the little donut balls. Nice but also not worth the price. \n\nMight try it once more for brunch. Maybe that's the forte of this place. Certainly never again for dinner and never again for pizza.", "author": "Nuno S."}

I had the butternut squash carrot soup and the pork chop for my main.\n\nI thought the sausage on the pizza was OK, as the taste didn't really stand out. The crust was good though, but I  didn't really care for the center parts becoming soggy quickly.  I really enjoyed the butternut squash soup.  You could taste the ginger and lemongrass inside. This added a unique surprising flavor.\n\nThe pork chop was an OK dish.   Our server said that it's cooked medium, but my piece was \"well\".   The moisture from the butter beans did help in eating the pork chop.  \n\nFor my dessert, we shared the apple date cake, chocolate mousse, goat cheese custard, and pear tarte.   From all four, the apple date cake stood out the best. The spices in the cake made the cake very pronounced to the other desserts flavors.    My second favorite was the goat cheese custard, only because I like goat cheese. \n\nOur server was great and the staff welcoming.

Super refreshing with the macerated strawberries and if you read my reviews, you know I love me prosecco! \n\nI then ordered the baked egg since it had polpette in it. Polpette is a meatball so the egg was on top with the meat and some vegetables (kale and onions) as well. It was a great dish with a bit of bread. It was one of those dishes that didn't look filling, but by the end of it I was definitely full and didn't want anymore food.  \n\nOverall, the food was delicious, drink was good.

I was running late to meet a couple friends and they decided to put an order in for me. I asked them to order the soft scrambled eggs with mushrooms, snap peas, and meyer lemon ricotta. The eggs were beautifully cooked as were the mushroom and peas. It was topped up with delicate greens in a very light vinaigrette. I also had a couple glasses of mimosa (It was the weekend anyway... or as the Brits and French say... \"the week-end.\" Sounds more luxurious when you break up the word.) Anyway, the three of us also shared an order of zeppole with vanilla bean crema, Meyer lemon curd, and huckleberries. The order was for four of these doughnut-like confections. They are dusted with sugar and taste absolutely magical. \n\nNow, because I arrived late, I couldn't be a full judge of service. Overall, it seemed alright. I did notice, however, that our server only addressed one of us at the table every time she came around. That was a little awkward when my friend and I would look at her, but she would only look at our other friend when it came to ordering or other questions. The ambiance: lovely. I love the \"modern rustic\" (yes, a paradox!) feel of Piccino. It is open, airy, and has plenty of windows for light. The crowd: yuppies in the \"emerging\" neighborhood of Dogpatch... mostly 30-somethings... some folks chatting about politics, the others gossiping or talking about travel plans. You get the picture.\n\nThis is a darling place. Since my good friends live around the corner, I look forward to visiting again!", "author": "James Z."}

Welcoming atmosphere and open area.  Loved the wood furnishings.  \n\nNOTE:  Street parking readily available.\n\nFOOD:\n1.  Marinated Olives:  Decent portion.

My favorite pizza that we ordered.  Actually, my mom and brother loved it too.  It was gone before we knew it and we were still hungry.  Simple yet tremendously satisfying.\n\n4.  Margherita Pizza:  tomato, mozzarella, fresh oregano.  With our hunger not yet satisfied, so we decided to order this 2nd pizza.  For me, it was just okay.  I preferred the Salsiccia Pizza quite honestly.  \n\nSince my mom and I had to wake up early the next morning, we decided to forgo dessert altogether.

I can't tell you how many of these so-called \"neighborhood gems\" that's I've been to that were a bust (e.g. Park Chow, Frascati, Garibaldi, Le P'tit Laurent, Hillside Supper Club etc). Gem my ass. More like a diamond ring you get from a gumball machine. \n\nUnlike any other neighborhood restaurants I've been to, Piccino is a triple threat: solid food, awesome service, and charming ambiance. All the components that make-up a 5 star restaurant.\n\nThis past Sunday, my friends and I (party of six) came to Piccino for brunch with reservations. They just have a lunch menu (no breakfast items) which was just fine by me because thanks to Anthony Bourdain, I will never look at bacteria-loving hollandaise sauce the same way again.\n\nWe shared the following apps and desserts but ordered our own entrees (pizzas). Based on our sampling of the menu, you really can't go wrong with any of their dishes as they execute top-notch ingredients very well. \n\n* ~ * F O O D * ~ *\n*Kenne tomales creamery aged goat cheese, carrot cake, orange oil, black pepper ($10) - 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1a0E49j\nInsanely delicious, this app was like eating an elevated and savory carrot cake. So ridiculously good, we ordered two orders. \n\n*Burrata, beets, crispy polenta, watercress, red wine vinegar ($14) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/18btVpt\nMilky burrata, fresh beets, and deliciously creamy fried polenta? The healthy way to get in your fried foods and cheese without an ounce of guilt!\n\n*Funghi: roasted mushrooms, stracchino, shaved garlic ($17 + $2 egg) - 3.5 STARS \nhttp://bit.ly/1idQf7J\nIf you love mushrooms then you will love the funghi pizza. Mushroom tapenade (in lieu of marinara sauce) layered atop a flavorful crust then topped with whole mushrooms and stracchino cheese. A bit too mushroomy for me and I couldn't taste the cheese but add an egg. Boom--brunch food!\n\n*Mr. NSS' Salsiccia: house made sausage, mozzarella, red onion ($16) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1a9nkPg\nI liked the salsiccia over my funghi pizza because you can actually taste and feel the texture of the ooey gooey cheese in your mouth. Loved the robust sausage and I liked that the crust stayed a lot more crisp than the funghi pizza. \n\n*Zeppole, vanilla bean crema, huckleberry marmellata ($7) - 4.5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1a9nqGB\n\n*Goat cheese custard, berries, black pepper tuile, pumpkin seed ($8) - 5 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1fVd0QV\n\n*Passito rosso poached figs, mascarpone mousse, hazelnuts, coco nib ($12) - 3 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/1bf1qKL\n\n*Apple tarte tatin, creme fraiche, pomegranate ($8) - 4 STARS\nhttp://bit.ly/Hhrcof\n\nAlthough I'm not a dessert person, I almost always order dessert when dining out in order to get a true sampling of the menu. We shared 4 desserts and by far, the fav among our group was the goat cheese custard which was a savory sweet deliciousness in a jar. Our 2nd fav was the zeppole which were fried to order and so light. The vanilla crema added just the right amount of creamy sweetness. I liked the buttery flakey crust of the apple tarte tatin but I think a scoop of vanilla ice cream would have made it even better to give it that lovely temperature contrast. The least fav was my pick of the poached figs and mascarpone mousse. The accompanying cake was dry and overall, the dessert lacked flavor. I guess that's what I get for trying to pick the healthiest dessert. \n\n* ~  * S E R V I C E * ~ *\nJust as solid as the food was the service. The staff was very friendly and casual yet professional and attentive. Although we had a larger party, service didn't suffer as they do with many restaurants. Food service was timely as well. \n\n* ~ * A M B I A N C E / D E C O R * ~ *\nI absolutely adore Piccino's ambiance. After having an ear-bleeding brunch at Central Kitchen the previous week, it was such a relief to have brunch/lunch in relaxed ambiance without having to shout across the table. \n\nIndustrial chic meets Napa wine country, Piccino's space is very open with tons of light coming through and natural wood furnishings. The funky buddha's hand adorning the tables was really cool! I'm a sucker for open kitchens and Piccino is no exception; loved their large open kitchen. Highly recommended for a first date!\n\n* ~ * P A R K I N G * ~ *\nPlenty of free, non-metered parking because Piccino is located in a desolate part of Dogpatch. Chocolate Lab is down the block and Mr. & Mrs. Miscellaneous is just a block away.  \n\nPiccino in Italian means \"little\" but there's nothing \"little\" about this restaurant. I mean, I don't think they call them \"Italian Stallions\" for nothing right? Umm, not that I was looking... \n\n#MindForeverInTheGutter", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

I'm usually one to save sweets for dessert at the end, but I'd been craving fig toast for quite some time now and it was well worth the wait! For entrees, we ordered the pork beef polpette and the strozzapreti which was just the right balance of meat, vegetables, and carbs. The polpette (essentially meatballs) was soo tender and well seasoned! I really like that these meatballs were substantial, but not too heavy and it was just the right amount for sharing.

I don't mind - I got a better view on their open kitchen - my \"partner in crime\" is already not thrilled and wants a more comfortable chair.  But we stay, since the pizza looks good, the awesome smell from the kitchen is intriguing and we are hungry. \n\nThe server/ waiter shows up and sparingly greets us. \"What you want to drink\"? we have not had a chance to look at the menu - we don't know - he is unhappy and it shows - he just leaves.  OK, I guess, next opportunity we get to order - we'd better be ready! He comes back and I dare to ask about any specials - big mistake... \n\nWell, we place the order from their great selection of seasonal dishes - burrata on heirloom polenta, brussel sprouts, a salad (I noted I wanted dressing on the side - and all the souses came on the side - I like this!) - and a pizza to share. \n\nAll ingredients were very fresh and high quality.  Burrata was good, polenta not so much. Brussel sprouts were just amazing - I would have licked the bowl if I could. \n\nNow, what we came here for - their pizza.  The first one we ordered - well, we are picky, but it just wasn't good enough for us to eat it.  However, our fault, should have read the menu better (not that we could ask our server any questions, since, well, he is important). We ordered another pizza - Margarita this time.  This was much better, but still not even close to my expectations.  The crust was blunt and the sauce really lacked favor. Again, ingredients are good, but may be add some more.. spices.  \n\nEither way, didn't feel like staying for dessert (partially because we got completely abandoned by our waiter). \n\nAlso, they didn't offer to take another pizza off the bill (well, we didn't ask since it is our fault, but... they could have offered), had to hunt people down to get my hot tea, getting the bill was a challenge.  \n\nI always conclude my review with a question - ever again? well, may be for this one - if we ever move to the neighborhood and don't want to drive. Definitely not putting on my \"destination restaurants\" list.", "author": "Marianna K."}

I haven't been to another place that does pizza and pasta nearly as well (and authentically!) \n\nI highly recommend the strozzapretti. The nettle pesto and midnight moon gouda made such a creamy combination, making this by far my favorite dish. \n\nI am not usually impressed by pizza but after browsing photos and previous reviews, my friend and I ordered the salsiccia. The pizza itself was thin-crust, which made the flavor from house-made sausage and red onion all the more distinct. The portion was generous enough for two girls who had just walked in from intense workouts! \n\nI love the fact that they have daily, seasonal menus, so I'll definitely be back to try more of their primi and contorni. I noticed the pork/beef poulette on the neighboring table and the marinara (crushed tomato) looked delicious. I'll be trying that next time.\n\nAll in all, if you're in the Dogpatch neighborhood, do not miss out!

At 11am when the restaurant opened, there was a steady line out the door - good thing we had reservations!\n\nThe space is open, airy, and much more roomy than it looks like from the outside - it can also accommodate large parties (there was a 10+ person baby shower table just behind us).\n\nNow, first things first - if you're a breakfast food type of eater at brunch (like me) - this may not be the most ideal place for you. There were precisely two egg options on the menu, and no traditional breakfast items like pancakes, french toast, etc.\n\nIf you're open to eating pizza for breakfast - you will love Piccino. The wide variety of thin crust pizzas (you can opt to put an egg on top), looked delicious.\n\nOur table started out with basket of warm pastries, which was delicious! Mixed with a scone, popover, and bread - definitely a great \"breakfast\" item. We were also eyeing the zeppole, but the server kindly informed us they were not able to make that dish that day.\n\nFor my main entree, I chose to go with one of the egg dishes - namely, the soft scrambled egg with brassicas and a horseradish cream fraiche. The dish was very refined, and the sauce definitely played a major role in flavor. \n\nI do have to say that for the $16 price tag, the portion size was a bit small. Had it come with a slice of toast or complimenting item, that might've alleviated my portion size distress.\n\nOverall, everyone at the table enjoyed their dishes. Others also felt the portions were a bit limited. The server also mentioned that the pizzas were \"mini\" and made for one, and then proceeded to upsell an additional salad - definitely unecessary. The pizza is more than adequate for two people.", "author": "Mansi A."}

I feel better about eating the food that comes out.\n\nThe menu is light and pricey. I honestly could not pronounce most of the things on the menu! A gentle question of \"have you've been here before?\" would've been nice with a little explanation of the items on their menu.  \n\nLove love their asparagus with avocado (pictured). Their Saliccia and Funghi pizza was delicious - more so the Saliccia because if the homemade sausage. The egg, however, did not add any special texture or taste to it.

In the reservation, I noted that it was a birthday so the restaurant would be aware it was a special night. Our group arrived 15 minutes early and after checking in with the host, I was told the table was ready and they were just setting it for us. 10 minutes later, we checked in again to see if it was set and we were told that despite our table being ready, the waitress had been overwhelmed with orders so they were 'giving her a rest and spacing out the orders'. Ookay. The host also somewhat smugly asked us what time it was at this point, it was 8:57. She then said they would try to seat us 'as close to 9 pm as possible'. Considering it was noted as a birthday dinner (and our group waited til most restaurants' closing times to eat because 9 pm was Piccino's earliest reservation available), this was incredibly disappointing. Our group waited outside until 10 minutes past 9 and then decided to leave and find another spot for the birthday dinner.

I wouldn't order it again. The pizza on the other hand was delicious! I don't eat dairy, so I asked the waiter if I could hold the cheese and add a vegetable.

That's how I would describe Piccino.  \n\nThere's things I really like about Piccino but there were other things about them that I didn't like and even loathe.  So I'll break it down from the top:\n\nThe Good:  \n\nI liked the ikea-esque decor.  It's bright, it's clean looking with the light colored wood framing and tables.  The noise level is moderate among the wine drinking aficionados, hipsters, and treehugging crowd that comes here and despite the tight space between tables I felt like we had a nice measure of privacy.  \n\nAlso as far as the food was concerned.  The two things that stood out was the Funghi and Bianca Pizzas.  Funghi pizza was full of delicious mushrooms, stracchino, and shaved garlic, it was packed with flavor.  Bianca consists of three cheeses, it was great with the thin crust used.\n\nThe Bad:\n\nAfter having the wonderful Funghi and Bianca you'd assume all the pizzas made here are equal but this wasn't the case.  We also ordered the Margherita pizza which was bland and boring.  Also to my surprise the salsicca pizza with pepperoni added was not good.  I already felt like a manly man like myself shouldn't be eating crust so thin so I tried to compensate and turn the salsicca into a meat-lovers pizza but some how it back fired. \n\nAlong with the not-so-good pizzas was the two desserts ordered.  We ordered a chocolate mousse style cake which just didn't taste good.  The cinnamon apple cake with ice cream was ok if you gotta have dessert which I didn't. \n\nThe Ugly:\n\nThe service was poor.  Our waitress serviced our table with mild neglect.  She came around very seldom and when we had questions or we ordered she was unfriendly and very short with us.  Her forced smile made it look like her face was going to crack.  I tried to play it off since we were having good conversation with our company but inside I was irritated with her.    \n\nSo if you go to Piccino, expect to get a little (Blondie aka Funghi, Bianca) as Good,  a little (Angel Eyes aka Magherita, desserts) as Bad, and (Tuco aka MY WAITRESS) as Ugly.", "author": "Michael L."}

They didn't ask for my credit card info so assumed the reservation was good to go as the person on the phone was like see you then.  When we finally get to the reservation weeks later, the reservation was no where to be found.  May have been a miscommunication but the front desk person there was extremely rude about it and had no sense of customer service.  The other families I was with also thought she was super rude and her tone was uncalled for.  She could have handled it better and could brush up on some customer service training from management with dealing with issues like this.  The restaurant looked empty too, and had many empty seats available.  Her tone was extremely rude especially with having all the kids around us and then having to hear her rude tone.  Very unhappy about the whole experience, the other families were even at awe at how rude she was to us.

When I went to talk to the host at 7:10pm about a table, he told me to give our server some time. Wow, okay? We made a reservation for 7pm, but we should give our server some time? I also told him it was my friend's birthday, which he failed to relay to our server.\n\nThen we ended up at a shared table seated next to an extremely obnoxious child who couldn't stop moving or making strange noises. So much for reservations.\n\nThroughout the meal, we had to ask for our bottle of water to be refilled. This happened at least five times. It was never taken or refilled without our asking. We also poured our own water the entire time, minus the first glass. Our server was often nowhere to be found, and I had to ask other servers and the host to help us instead. Even then, the hosts and servers were often conversing instead of attending to guests or tables.\n\nWe had to tell another server that it was my friend's birthday, which she was able to relay to the kitchen. The wine list also boasts expensive wines - there were no reasonably priced ones. The average glass cost $14-15. The $50 bottle we ordered was only okay.\n\nThe only saving grace was the food. The pasta I had was great, well seasoned and well made. The portions are pretty small though, so keep that in mind when ordering!\n\nWeirdly, in the middle of dusk, they placed a candle on our table.

I once ordered an endive salad that was three pieces of lettuce, five pistachios, and some honey drizzle.  Stick to the pizzas and you'll be okay.", "author": "Jessica H."}

We were greeted by a friendly hostess and seated in the corner which was pretty cozy overlooking the entire restaurant.\n\nWe started off with the butternut squash soup which was pretty good - the grapes and hazelnuts were a nice touch. I had the Salsiccia Pizza which was excellent - the sausage was tasty and onions were sweet which, combined with the mozzarella, was perfect. My girlfriend had the Margherita pizza which tasted fine, but it was nothing special.\n\nDecor was modern, yet relaxing and we never felt rushed by any of the staff who were all pleasant and attentive. I could tell this place has a higher attention to detail than most other places (food presentation, candle placement, utensils etc.) I came in wearing a t-shirt and felt a bit under dressed.

Finally decided to try their brunch spur of the moment this past Saturday.  I easily found last minute reservations on Opentable as well.  We decided on sharing the Funghi Pizza with an egg ($17 + 2) and the milk braised pork ($18).  \n\nThe pork came out first and it was tender, but not too soft, as it still stayed together pretty well.  The pork had a little bit of sweetness to it from the milk and I loved the herbs and the light sauce with potatoes and peas finishing off the dish.  I think it could have used a little more flavor but I appreciate that this dish was light, as it sounded heavy when reading it on the menu. When our pizza was presented to us we noticed that the egg was missing.  Our waitress offered to have it remade or to fry an egg separately and put it on top.  I asked her what she thought was better..but then she offered to have us hold on to the pizza in front of us while the other one with the egg was remade.  I loved the fresh mushrooms and garlic, but the pizza with the egg was so much better as it added more flavor to the pizza which it needed.  The egg yolk was perfect and oozed out when pierced and gave the pizza a more creamy flavor.  The pizza was thin but didn't get soggy and had the perfect crunch and no burnt parts at all.  We would say it's the best Italian style pizza we've had so far.  \n\nOur waitress was so sweet and we loved the minimalist decor of the restaurant.  And of course are pizza was pretty amazing and the pork was satisfying as well.  We can't wait to come back to try Piccino's dinner menu.

Just the right amount of dough and clearly cooked in the right oven at the perfect temperature.

I'm admitting it, it's one of my favourite restaurants in SF, and that doesn't come lightly, my inner Italian would never forgive me for it.\n\nI love its humble name, as I like translating Piccino as \"itty bitty\", yet nothing about this place is small. Friendly osteria feel with a more refined decor, offering a very well-thought-out menu filled with classics. The food is always delicious and service is just impeccable, they seriously have some of the best wait staff under one roof that I've ever seen.\n\nI've brought picky eaters, as well as vegetarian friends, and everyone loved it just the same. Come with a friend or two and try a little bit of everything. Add a perfectly thin crusted pizza to whatever you're ordering and don't say no to dessert.

Good, solid but nothing special.\n\nWe had the salad with little romaine lettuce (some cute little \"gem\") - too sour, too lemon-y.  But the true disappointment was the pizza.

We ordered three: 1) margherita, 2) sausage, and 3) potato. The sauce and the cheese on the margherita was flavorless (needed salt, spices), 2) the sausage pizza was slightly better, but again the sauce was just unremarkable and 3) the potato was interesting, but didn't wow me.\n\nThere are far better pizza places in and around SF - If you go to Piccino for the pizza you will be disappointed.

The cooking style is \"farm-to-table\" and minimalist with pristine presentation (I think Boulette's Larder is an apt comparison).  While the modest portions will not overwhelm you, I think the menu anticipates you will order a couple of courses.  (Our party of two adults and a toddler is usually satiated with two starters and two entrees.) \n\nThe thin crust pizzas are tasty, particularly the margherita, funghi, and salsiccia -- but some may find the pizza too thin for the price (ranging from $12-$20).  Also, please note the pizza is thinner than the traditional New York style thin crust pizza.  The market soup, little gem salads, and polpette (meatballs) are also reliably delicious, but, as previously noted, do not come in large portions.

I don't normally like lamb (it's usually too gamey for my taste), but this was done really well. The pasta was cooked perfectly, and the right amount of flavors combined for a perfect dish. Loved the addition of the pistachios for an extra crunch and I know it's a good pasta dish when I can't easily recreate it at home.\n\nEstate Pizza ($18) - Mozzarella di bufala, squash, corn, cherry tomatoes, arugula - Delicious thin crust pizza, and one of the best on their menu. All the ingredients were really fresh and light. I loved that the crust was not soggy in the middle. The crust is definitely more crispy, and it is less sourdough-y and less chewy than Flour and Water.\n\nFunghi Pizza ($18) - Instead of a layer of tomato sauce, imagine a layer of roasted mushroom puree. It's definitely different from any other mushroom pizza I've had, and delicious. I preferred the Estate pizza to this, but still enjoyed this. There were thin slices of garlic on top, so if you're on a first date, it's probably best to avoid this.\n\nDesserts:\n\nZeppole ($7) - Little fluffy donut pillows, sprinkled with sugar. They were piping hot and soft. It comes with 5 or 6 pieces. I would get this again.\n\nAffogato ($7) - Another dessert I'd definitely get again. The espresso paired perfectly with the palm sugar ice cream.

We had reservations for a Friday night but were late 45 minutes due to Giants' preseason game traffic. But they held on to our table! After letting them know we were running late, of course.\nVery impressive wine list! Although they were out of the Bordeaux I wanted, which was Ok because the server recommended something similar which I liked. \n\nFor food, we ordered:\n- pork and beef polpette, basically meatballs which were so light and delicious. The tomatoes were very fresh. \n- Funghi pizza which was also good but not as good as the reviews may indicate\n- Bianca pizza with egg.. this was definitely delicious! Yum. Good advice by the server to eat it fast or it turns chewy.\n\nThat's all we had because we ate some snacks beforehand d'oh. But it was good! If you're in the area, I'd recommend going. We took MUNI T from downtown and it's very convenient location at the 20th/3rd street stop, just 5 minutes walk to Minnesota St.", "author": "Vol T."}

None of this appeared to be done with malice, just utter incompetence.\n\nAdditionally the hostess was grossly unrealistic with seating times, telling groups \"a few minutes\" for wait time when several groups ahead had been waiting for 40 min+. \n\nNormally I'm sympathetic to the pressures of this role, however this was the worst experience I ever had with a hostess. \n\nFood and service are great once you sit down... if you ever get the chance.", "author": "Lindsey W."}

BIG MISTAKE.\n\nThe waitress came by after 10 or so minutes to offer us water...finally. Then, we asked for her recommendations. She told us that one entr\u00e9e was just delicious... And then told us she's never had it before. That was just the beginning.\n\nMy friend asked for a particular varietal of wine recommendation. The waitress brought over another waitress to help figure this out. I suggested maybe you could let my friend taste some wines? They were like okay... And they brought over two wines, however they only had one glass. I gave them my wine glass so my friend could taste the wine. Again this is just the beginning.\n\nDinner started and we both had soup to start. My friend didn't like her soup and I was looking for flavor, so wanted pepper. We had to ask the wait staff to help us get some pepper. This is just ridiculous service.\n\nFor some reason we weren't getting the message about how terrible the food and the service were. It came time for dessert. We're at Italian restaurant so we figured the dessert has to be good. There was this item on the menu called pink squirrel... And we were curious to what is a pink squirrel. Shouldn't they just call it strawberry or something what is pink squirrel? We asked the waitress and once again her ability to describe the food was sub optimal. She said it was \"some vodka infused dessert\".\n\nAt this point I have never gone out to seek the manager at a restaurant but this was too awful. After telling the manager of this lovely story, she seemed to be much more concerned with who it was on the team as opposed to customer service; she was also not listening that her staff had never tried the food so how can they serve it or recommend it well?! We both left clearly no tip. The manager didn't even say goodbye or sorry about the service. Wow. \n\nAVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE.\n\nWe only can hope a better place comes to Dogpatch soon to replace this one.\n\nCiao.", "author": "Sharon M."}

Not exactly what a hip Dogpatch restaurant wants to see walking through the door.\nHowever! The hostess greeted us very nicely.  I think we came in at 6:45 PM, so the dinner crowd was pretty much in full swing if not on the cusp.  When she asked if we had a res and I said no, she said we could sit at the bar area facing the store they are attached to.  For a hot second I thought we were being relegated to no-man's land because \"it's-a-mom-with-small-child\" and I got momentarily pissed (good thing I have a bangin' poker face), but I Zen-ed out on that feeling because I totally got that it was Saturday night and they literally have NO idea if my kid is chill or not.  So no problem.  The hostess totally decided to take it to the net, however, without any prompting, and brought some folded blankets so my son, George, wasn't eye-level with the bar by sitting on top of them.  Well played, my good hostess.\nThe server arrived pretty quickly and, as we are simple folk with simple needs, we got our crackers lickity split, as well as my vino (praise!).  The crackers they have as an appetizer are really worth ordering - large, maybe 6 inches long and 3 inches wide, they have a remarkably Zaatar flavor to them and just the right punch of sea salt.  My son and I loved them.  \nOur pizza came out in due course, meaning like 8 minutes - perfect.  We got a simple margarita and my son, George, seriously should have been on camera when he bit into the slice: \"This is GOOD pizza, mommy!\" with his little elf voice and face.  I actually DID try to have him do it again on camera, but he's very Greta Garbo - you better catch him the first time.   I did take a picture, though, so I'll add it here.  \nAlso, George was being so freakin' good, that I got like 800 smiles from both staff and patrons.  A nice feeling for all, and indicative of the place attracting a good crowd. \nWe got our check right when I asked, no prob.   \nAlso, the decor is very nice - not pretentious, not overly DIY or trying too hard or whatever.  Really classy and modern. They also have the added blessing of being on a corner, so there are many windows.  \nI will definitely go back, probably without George, so I can have a date night and order whatever.  But I'd like to take him again as well, as he really enjoyed it, which made me enjoy it all the more.

At that time, we were graduate students at UCSF and mission bay plus the Dogpatch neighborhood were beginning to develop. We fell in love with this restaurant and our families flew in from NY, Philadelphia, and LA, we had our (post PhD defence) graduation family celebratory lunch here.  It was perfect and we ordered perfect pizzas and sat outside, a meal we will never forget. We then left San Francisco and returned back East to continue our education and then careers. We returned a couple weeks ago for a double birthday brunch with an old friend. Wow, how things have changed!! First, the restaurant moved down the street one block and now occupies a very large, well lit, and airy elegant space in a yellow painted home adjacent to a fancy clothing store. We were delighted to see that despite their wonderful (congrats!!) expansion and growth, that the warm hospitality, kindness, and great pride in their food has not changed!  Their menu has expanded quite a bit beyond their superlative pizza to include tender meats and pastas and a host of desserts. We ordered lamb ragu pasta, white pizza, meatballs, salad, and all were truly superlative. Their pizza is a must...you won't eat better anywhere. The lamb ragu was also very special. Very flavorful without being gamey and perfectly seasoned on a bed of homemade pasta. They were so kind as I had no idea they had expanded and they were nearly packed when we arrived 15 min early without a reservation and they very kindly held a table for us without reservation. The chef, learning we were fans and patrons from the restaurant's beginning years, so generously brought us a pesto homemade pasta on the house which was so delicious as well as well as did not charge us for two birthday cake slices which were also absolutely delicious, esp the poppyseed cake. This was such a generous and kind gesture, and it made our reunion birthday brunch years later at our favorite San Francisco Italian restaurant so absolutely memorable and truly unforgettable.

Instead of taking her order, they helped the customer after her. Then the next after them. And so on.

Case in point, Colin Kaepernick's recent performance against the Chicago Bears. The same can be said about certain restaurants. \n\nSo let me preface this review by saying that Piccino is a good restaurant. I know that they have a talented team in the kitchen, and they're a huge boon to the emerging Dogpatch neighborhood. But I have to admit, my dinner experience last night was slightly better than average. And that was a huge surprise. It was like their A-team had the night off, and their B-team was doing the best they could to hold court.\n\nMy friends and I ordered a sausage/red onion pizza to share. It was delicious! One of the best pizzas I've had in a while. Next time I dine here, I'm going to order a pizza all for myself. The others can fend for themselves. For our entree, we ordered pasta. And when I say pasta, I mean very simple pasta - spaghetti with tomatoes, olive oil, garlic, and chili pepper flakes. For some reason unbeknownst to me, it took over 30 minutes for our spaghetti to arrive. And when it did finally arrive, the pasta was crunchy. Trust me, I know what al dente is, but this spaghetti was like 2 minutes undercooked. The sauce was fine, but nothing mind-blowing. I guess I could've sent the dish back to the kitchen, but I was so hungry (and the service was so slow), I just decided to suck it up.\n\nSpeaking of service, our waitress was a bit on the dour side. No smiles. No welcoming attitude. She really gave off the vibe that she wanted to be somewhere else. And that's kind of a shame, because we were a fun-loving, easy-going, low maintenance table, and her sour disposition kind of ruined our happy buzz. \nIn addition to the slow pasta service, I saw a few mishaps on the floor (this, unfortunately, is one of the down sides of having an open kitchen where you can see everything). First off, our pizza was delivered to the wrong table. We then received it a few minutes later, once the mistake was discovered. As I mentioned before, our pasta arrived 30 minutes later and undercooked (and this is a basic spaghetti dish that one could make at home in less than 10 minutes). Our dessert (Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous ice cream with espresso) arrived promptly. However, our decaf macchiatos arrived 10 minutes after the dessert. To her credit, the server admitted that she had accidentally spilled the drinks, hence the reason for the delay. But still, if you're spending $50 per person for dinner at a nice restaurant, you want your meal and coffee to arrive in a timely manner. \n\nAll in all, Piccino is a fine restaurant. There's a lot about the cuisine, ambiance, and clientele that reminds me of Delfina in the Mission (and that's a compliment). I will certainly come back (especially for the pizza). I just hope that their A-team is back on the line.\n\nP.S.\nPiccino also has a coffee bar off-shoot (with delicious espresso beverages and pastries). Their 12 hour ice-coffee is a refreshing treat on a hot, summer (or Indian summer) day.", "author": "Kevin B."}

The grilled octopus salad was divine. The pasta courses and pork belly were excellent. And the service was excellent--attentive, friendly, timely, welcoming. I had posted a Yelp review after a disappointing experience with both food and service a few months ago (after which I received a call from one of the owners apologizing and vowing to do better), but those problems have been completely eliminated. I am so delighted that one of my long-time favorite restaurants has returned to its superb form. Can't wait to go back!", "author": "Sheryl F."}

The food was excellent, but the service was awful.  The only reason why this isn't a 5 star review is because of the server.  The greeter was a young woman who was wonderful, we had 7:30pm reservations and our table wasn't quite ready, but she was attentive and kept us updated on wait times, so no problems there. \n\nOur actual waitress was horrible.  She was a tight lipped woman with short hair who didn't smile once.  She didn't even introduce herself, the first words out of her mouth were \"do you know what you want?\"  We had to flag down the greeter to get some water.   When we had finished our meals, she came over and put the dessert menu on our table without saying a single word and just walked away.  \n\nMy friend and I were laughing at just how absurd the entire interaction was the whole night.  I almost wanted to ask her if we offended her or did anything wrong, because it was just so ridiculous.  Every other staff member we talked to was more pleasant than this woman. \n\nThe food was excellent.  I highly recommend the pork ragu - it was seriously the best pasta I've ever had in my life.  We got a salad and roasted tomato soup to start,  great.  We shared the ragu, and I had the pork loin and my friend had trout for entrees, both excellent.  Pork loin a bit pricey for what it was, but was fine.  Dessert was goat cheese tart which was delicious as well. \n\nDecor was warm and inviting, loved the wood panels.  Open kitchen. \n\nAll in all I'll probably be back, but will be on the look out for that awful server.  If I end up with her again I will seriously request for another waiter/waitress.", "author": "X X."}

This is a cute bustling Dogpatch restaurant with potential, airy interior and open kitchen, high ceilings, nicely dressed casual crowd. We popped in on a busy Friday for a quick light bite. It was busy and we opted for immediate outside seating, though it was chilly. \n\nThe dinner menu is short with fancy pizza offerings, pasta, some salads.\n\nA innovative pasta of mint, chili and parsley was well executed.  But was brought out first. \n\nThe starter came out last, a \"special\" burata and egg plant with toasted bread. The bread was burnt was of immediate concern. This is a classic line manager failing. Burnt toast is easily remedied, throw away, start over. The dish itself was not special. The eggplant over powered the delicate cheese. The entire dish came off as it was a forced special.\n\nThat was dinner. \n\nAs it was a quick meal, dim outside lighting and cool, we let the waitress pick a glass of red for the meal. Bad move. Her (or the managements choice) pick was $17 a glass. A nice pour in nice stemware, but sticker shock. Granted a typical glass of wine is easily $11-14, it's was poor form to go upper end. \n\nThe desire to fill the house at all costs, had the front standing room only with patrons waiting creating an airport restaurant scene.

I'm a New Yorker in Northern California... otherwise known as \"WHERE CAN I FIND A DECENT SLICE???\" \n\nI'm so sorry to disappoint, but this just isn't the place. While the ambiance is lovely - hardwood floor, dim lighting, packed bar - the food is sub-par. For all the talk of \"amazing pizza,\" I was expecting a menu boasting creative creations. But there aren't any. And while I appreciate the effort, good pizza isn't good simply because the crust is thin (and it's really thin). The tomato sauce honestly tasted like ketchup. Both my friend and I - another NY transplant - were severely disappointed. Yes, the dishes are presented and prepared with style, but that doesn't make the pizza taste better either.\n\nI also think Piccino, due to their unwarranted and insane popularity, need to hire more staff.

Yeah, that's not quite what I had expected, but who cares when the coffee is good, right?\n\nSince there wasn't anyone around when my friend and I arrived, I was pretty happy we were able to just walk right up and order (especially after reading some of these reviews about the wait and the lines).  I thought about ordering their regular drip coffee, but decided to get something a little different and went with the Americano instead.  The guy working the counter did a pretty good job of crafting my drink, and I liked the robust flavor.  Not quite to the level of Philz for me, but still pretty darn solid.  Of course, it helps when you've got Sightglass coffee to work with.  Not to take anything away from Piccino (since you still need to know how to make the drinks), but it helps when you have something good to start with.\n\nThere are a few tables around for those that want to grab a seat, but it's really more of a grab-and-go kind of spot.

Piccino has easy freeway access, and also plentiful street parking close by.\n\nSaturday dinner was a popular affair, but our reservation was honored exactly when we arrived - though maybe not so much for diners arriving for later seatings, who crowded the entrance for much of our meal, occasionally propping the door open and allowing a chill wind to blast past the bar.  They had a neat child seat for our one year old which hung directly off the end of the table.\n\nThe wine list is heavy on European options, with a few Californian selections thrown in seemingly at random. They offer many wines by the glass and caraffe, and our sever seemed to have opinions on the list, though they may or may not have been borne out by the bottle we ended up choosing.\n\nGoat cheese and date cake starter came with a wonderful meyer lemon compote - well balanced and delicious.  Smoked trout mantecato was a small glass jar of mild-flavored fish salad, which went well with the crostini and strawberry salad.  The cured sardine had excellent flavors and a very appealing plating - definitely recommended.\n\nDespite it being early on at Saturday service, they were out of the pappardelle with rabbit sugo and perhaps a few other items.  The milk-braised pork with english pea ragu was hearty, though the legumes ranged from sweet and light to somewhat bitter and starchy.  The funghi pizza, with thin and crisp crust, was well-flavored as advertised, though missing the egg we had ordered on it.  Pizzas are almost personal-sized, maybe good to share between two people depending on your appetite.\n\nLike many of the plates, desserts were small portions.  Of particular note, the passion fruit crema was strongly flavored, perhaps too strongly for its accompaniments, but good.\n\nOverall, service was friendly and relatively fast, giving us plenty of time for a leisurely meal despite the crowds of aspiring diners in the front.  While this is definitely not the place you want to be if you are in the habit of complaining about small plates for rather high prices, the food is uniformly well executed and delicious.", "author": "Albert H."}

The gnocchi were also delightful but only enough for a few people, not a party of ten.\nIt was kind of embarrassing to have to ask for more.\nAll in all we had a terrific time, but taking clients to dinner and having to ask them if their paltry two to three leaves of greens was enough for them was not comfortable.

Yes, the dishes were carefully prepared and decorated (if you're into that), but over-salted. For a brunch menu, all items were about $20+ and that did not include  basic table bread.  Upon request, the home-backed focciaca arrived with smooth (likely artisanal-crafted) butter, but ruined by a layer-topping of salt. The coffee was warm, not hot, and disappointingly bitter.  Coffee refills are $4 per cup - for brunch, really?  The baked (single) egg on greens, pork sausage and beef polpette was tasty but over-salted. Perhaps most satisfying was my companion's single service pizza topped with ricotta, stone fruit and arugula $18 (plus $2 extra for an egg); but even that left us uninspired and unimpressed.", "author": "Tim Y."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-30", "description": "Tuscan-style dishes with a light California touch abound at Piccino. \n\nWith its rough wood floors, natural wood counter and tables, upbeat, but not too loud, music, and otherwise minimalist decor, the dining room at Piccino makes it clear that it's all about the food. If diners were left with any doubt of the importance owners Sher Rogat and Margherita Stewart Sagan place on the cuisine, the open kitchen where patrons can watch their dishes being carefully prepared quickly dispels them. \n\nThe menu features classic, seasonally driven thin-crust pizzas and polpette (Tuscan-style pork and beef meatballs), salads, soups, and house-made pastas, as well as contorni (vegetable sides), and entrees of meat, fish, or poultry.\n\nThe mixed chiccodia (chicory) in an achiovy-rich, Cesar-like dressing was a fresh, light starter. Unfortunately, the thin house-made crisps tucked in the salad became a little soggy from an over application of dressing.  Bucking the wood-fired oven trend, the pizzas are cooked in a standard pizza oven. The thin crust is almost cracker-like--not chewy, but not too dry. The delicate crust is perfectly cooked--lightly browned (not burned) on the edges and not soggy in the center--a combination I have not experienced since a glorious lunch at Bond 45 in New York.\n\nThe wine list focuses on Italian producers with a sprinkling of California standouts. With a substantial number of wines by the glass as well as by the bottle--from a fruity Prosecco to a hearty Alianico from Pietracupa--diners will have no trouble finding an appropriate choice to complement each dish. \n\nFor dessert, be sure to try the light but satisfying zeppole (St. Joseph's Day cake, also called sfinge) with cardamom cream and candied orange peel. \n\nOne minor fly in the soup, however:  while it is de rigueur in many restaurants to provide complementary filtered still or sparkling water, Piccino still chooses to pad the bill by charging $2 for this most basic part of the dining experience. (Minus one star.)\n\nSimple and beautiful, Piccino is a Dogpatch standout.", "author": "CJ G."}

We found this place, low and behold, after it was featured in the Sunday San Francisco Chronicle Food and Wine section.  It was listed as one of the top restaurants of 2011 to visit.  So we went, and notwithstanding the fact that it seemed far out of the way and in an area that was seemingly sparsely populated, it was really, really amazing.  \n\nTIP:  If you can, sit at the bar -- even though the tables are of a good size and can probably accomodate a fairly sized group, I suggest that if you are with only one to two other people, that you sit at the bar.  The reason being -- you get to watch the chefs.  My friend and I ate, laughed, enjoyed some wine, but more than anything we both kept commenting on how enjoyable it was to watch the chefs.  This is because of the 90degree angle that the bar forms around the open kitchen.  We could see everyone working, such that it was similar if not better than watching Iron Chef or something not unlike that program.  We watched pizzas being made, desserts plated and other items being prepared.  This really made all the difference for me, so I highly recommend it.\n\nService:  Top notch.  The hostess was beyond nice, even though we came in without a reservation.  Note to readers:  We came in around 6:30, without a reservation, and we were still able to find a seat at the bar.  There were not, however, any tables available.  Now based on the above, I'm not sure if our visit was similar to everyone else's, such that they were all coming because of the Chronicle article, but let me tell you -- after 20-30 minutes, there was a line out the door.  Accordingly, PLAN ahead.  This place takes reservations, but not from OpenTable.com.  Do yourself a favor and make the reservation.  \n\nThe waitress was also very good.  We talked to her about the food, but we also talked to her about the restaurant, how long it had been there, and so on and so forth.  She as both knowledge and efficient, both friendly and professional.\n\nFood:  Oh my gahhhh.  We ordered two things each + shared a dessert.  I had the pork and beef polpette (see my photos).  My friend had the funghi pizza.  Both were amazing, but that pizza... man oh man... that pizza was good.  It was probably against some rule somewhere out there in the universe, but I used the sauce that came with my polpette and put it in the pizza, and I think I saw stars.  The food only got better when the zeppole arrived.  Thing french begneits, because they're essentially the same kind of dessert; the cardamon creme sauce though was simply divine.  I'm going back just for these.\n\nAll in all, a hidden gem that I feel guilty about even reviewing, since it may make making a reservation harder for me!  \n\nOH and by the way -- our entire dinner (two entrees + one dessert + one glass of wine + one ice tea) = around $50.00.  Pretty affordable if you ask me.", "author": "Bryan H."}

I remember the first time I went there everything I ate was memorable. What I love about this place is that the food is thoughtful, in the sense that everything that is on the plate is meant to be there. The chefs really know how to play with flavors and deliver a fantastic meal.\n\nYou HAVE to get the burratta appetizer. It's the softest cheese I've ever had over this crispy rectangle of polenta, but the combination of the crispy texture of the polenta with the softness of the cheese is unreal. It comes on top of an arugula salad that is drizzled with sea salt and I can't even explain how delicious it is to get a bite with a sea salt gem, a little cheese a little arugula and the crunch of the polenta. I then ordered a pasta that has been the best unconventional pasta I've had. I am a FAN of sauces and of creaminess, so I was a little skeptical when the pasta was just flavored with a little butter. It blew me away how the chef managed to make such a creamy hearty pasta without the use of cream. There were mushrooms and slivers of finely cut parmesan cheese and it was just incredible, no other word to describe it.\n\nThe reason I am giving it 4 stars is because the second time I went there, things weren't as memorable. I ordered short ribs that were dry and insipid, and my boyfriend ordered risotto, which was really just barley in a chicken broth, which bugged me because as a restaurant, you can't call a dish something you won't deliver because the customer is going to expect what you are saying it is. We were expecting a creamy risotto and got wet barley. It was a \"bad\" risotto because it wasn't risotto. Seeing it as the barley plate, it was mediocre barley that needed salt, or some other element to deepen the flavor. I did order the burratta again, which was on point as usual.\n\nThe ambiance is great. It's cozy and warm and you feel like you are eating in front of a fireplace even though there is no real fire. I have nothing to complain about the aesthetic.\n\nI do highly recommend this place, and perhaps one has to order the italian dishes (pastas and pizzas) versus the meats and poultry.", "author": "Adriana A."}

First, if you don't have a reservation you will be treated like a second class citizen.  The front of house needs some serious work.  Second, this place takes forever to get food from the kitchen to your table.  I hope you are ready to spend at least 45 minutes waiting for a thin crust pizza even during times that aren't busy.  Who is managing the kitchen?  Apparently no one.  Third, don't even think about bringing kids here.  If you like restaurants that tolerate families then this is the place for you.  The staff should walk over to Serpentine to see how families should be treated. \n\nDogpatch is in a great area but the staff thinks they are located in Pacific Heights instead of a few blocks from the 22nd Street Caltrain station.  This place was great but once they moved to their current location and expanded they forgot why they were successful. Maybe the ownership changed recently or they simply don't care anymore. We won't be back and I would encourage anyone to look for alternatives in the area for restaurants that actually like customers.", "author": "James B."}

This establishment is small, to be sure, but I was surprised by its size and its spaciousness.  Reading reviews and descriptions of the restaurant, I expected Piccino to be \"tiny,\" but it's really of moderate size.  We came on a Sunday night and got reservations without trouble by phoning in the day before.  So coming here was pretty easy, and parking on the street was a snap.\n\nThe web site for the restaurant was informative and easy to navigate.  Before leaving home, I could see the day's menu and was able to look over the wine list.  Once we arrived, we were greeted warmly by the personnel, who seemed to be enjoying their work and to be proud of Piccino.\n\nOn to the food: it was all good.  We ordered a small plate of pickled veggies while waiting for a friend who managed to get lost while walking to the place.  Once he was seated, we ordered two soups (\"escarole, tomato and toasted barley soup, parmesan\"), two salads (\"mixed chicories, white anchovy, garlic crouton and creamy pecorino vinaigrette\") and the famous dish of pork and beef polpette, crushed tomatoes and parmesan.  I didn't try the soups, but I loved the salad and ate most of the polpette dish.  (The house encourages family-style service.)  For our main dishes, we ordered three pizzas for the five of us; this is what our server recommended, and the quantity seemed right.  Our pizzas were all vegetarian: the bianca, the funghi and the margherita.  They were all delicious, but I thought that the funghi was the clear winner.\n\nThe wine list is interesting.  A big fraction of the wines can be poured at the bar and be ordered by the glass or by the carafe.  I stuck to draft beers, getting the reserve wheat beer from  theTelegraph Brewing Company http://www.telegraphbrewing.com/beer.htm and then a half-order of a second beer whose reference I didn't take down.  (The third draft beer on the menu was from Linden Street, but I avoided it because it was from across the Bay.)\n\nI'm definitely a fan of Piccino.  I hope it won't be too long before we return.", "author": "Kenneth R."}

The menu is seasonally driven, so it does change often. Another thing i really liked about this place. \n\nThe polpette was good, and the simple red sauce was fantastic. The pizza was quite possibly the thinnest i have ever had. I loved the corn, prosciutto, and once again, the sauce was great. I found the peppers to be a little more spicy than i would have liked, but they were easy to pick off. \nThe flavors on the pizza worked really well together, and there were the perfect amounts of each.

The distance between the 2 sides was a bit wide though, and one of us was losing her voice. \n\nI ordered the beef and pork polpetted, which was tender, juicy, and just the right amount of cooked. Parts of the meatballs were tougher on the outside, and other parts softer and more soup-brewed-like, but in combination it was very delicious. Tomato sauce was very strongly tomato-y, sweet, and salted lightly. I wish it had been less pricey though-- for a pretty small portion it was $15. For dessert, I ordered a pink squirrel ice cream sandwich with dark chocolate bread. Ultimately, the sandwich turned out to be very tasty-- I liked the combination of a light ice cream with light, cracker/cookie dark chocolate bars (what I mean by cracker/cookie is that the bars were not as heavy or sugary as cookies, but resembled crackers more in its lightness). \n\nMy friends ordered peppermint tea for dessert.

There are dozens of better italian places in the city.\n\n2. Not kid friendly, which is highly unusual for a restaurant of this level and price point. Although they give crayons and coloring paper, they don't have standard high chairs or booster seats. The high chairs they have are the kind that screw on the table. Now that might be a management decision because they are actually safer than free-standing high chairs. However, this means that you must be seated at a communal table because the 2- and 4-seated tables can't support such a seat without toppling over. My 4-year daughter was setting on an Eames chair with blankets as her booster seat. Completely absurd.\n\n3. Good service. Service almost felt bad for the way things were run and more than made up for it by being so great.\n\n4. Only one cocktail on the menu. And it tasted like Campari + Aranciata San Pellegrino.

I say this place is definitely worth the visit - but opt for dinner time with good company to make it special.", "author": "Sarah H."}

Thank goodness I don't live in the neighborhood because I'd probably be here every evening!\n\nThe yellow exterior is warm, cozy and inviting yet the interior is modern and trendy. It's quite hard for a restaurant to simultaneously exude both vibes but Piccino somehow pulls it off irreproachably. I've been here several times with both my family and friends and both the food and service haven't failed to impress one bit. \n\nThis is first and foremost a gourmet pizza spot so keep that in mind when sifting through the menu - I highly recommend at least ordering one pizza for your table. The Funghi pizza is my absolute favorite (influx of truffles with just the right amount of stracchino cheese and a crispy crust) - the flavor is completely overwhelming in a great way. Close seconds are the bianca and salsiccia (sausage) pizzas. \n\nAlso, I'm not usually a vegetable-lover... I was one of those kids who had to be force-fed veggies in the most creative ways yet I simply could not get enough of the asparagus appetizer. It's crunchy, well-cooked and slightly buttery. Oh dear god. \n\nAnd finally, if you had to pick only one dessert for some ridiculous reason, order the Zeppole - it's basically an Italian version of beignets and it's creamy, crispy and delicious. \n\nSo if you're in the neighborhood and are craving pizza or a great unpretentious Italian meal, Piccino will hit the right spot. Versatile by nature, it's perfect for dates, nights out with foodie friends, family get-togethers and perhaps even business dinners. \n\nHappy Eating, Yelpers!\n\nP.S. The wine list is quite extensive and descriptive here - I love how they group the wines by boldness and flavor so that even a wine novice can choose exactly what their palette is craving.", "author": "Priya S."}

It's open and airy, always seems to have patrons in it when I go and for good reason. The food, the staff, and the environment are excellent.\n\nI've eaten every pizza this place makes and it never disappoints. The restaurant seems to adapt seasonly which makes so many of the items on their menu so good and \"new\". I've also had just about every salad on the menu and there isn't one I don't like. I've had a pasta dish there and a cheese style plate too and both were very tasty.\n\nBe prepared for a crowd at your typical peaks times as well as weekends.

I've spoken to the owners a number of times while wandering around the neighborhood and watched as they renovated the building and moved into a bigger space. They results are lovely! The restaurant is really beautiful. The colors, art, and design is super attractive and makes for a great lunch or early dinner spot when it's full of natural light.\n\nThe wine my waiter suggested was delicious and went very well with our dishes. The menu reflects appropriate seasonal choices and healthy options. The brooks cherries, burrata, polenta appetizer was delicious!!! I keep thinking about it! We ordered a zucchini pizza which was a new addition to the menu and it was so tasty! No sauce: just parmesan, olive oil, arugula, and summer squash.

As a thank you, I offered to buy him lunch/brunch.   We wanted to go to the excellent \"Just for You\" Cafe, but there was a long, winding line down the block to get in; not surprising, but I only had a little over an hour before my train to Santa Clara departed- so that was a no-go.    We looked around the neighborhood and found this place.  It was busy, but a very short line with a short wait (about 8min).  It looked clean, inviting, modern, and had an interesting menu.\n\nSo, my buddy ordered the polpette, and I ordered the Italian sausage with lentils, along with a couple of iced teas.    Both of us agreed that the food was excellent; very skillfully done.   The service was brisk, but attentive.  The surroundings were trendy, albeit bordering on precious.  But, my real problem wasn't with any of these things- my problem was with the portion sizes.    My friend received 3 medium-sized meatballs in sauce, nothing more, for $15.   I received one smallish sausage cut up on top of what looked to be a quarter cup of lentils for $16.   Add in two iced teas for about $6 and a very modest, but well flavored meal cost about $42 with tip.   I could have made this entire meal at home for about $10.\n\nI am not proposing that they necessarily have to increase to gargantuan \"American Smorgasbord-sized\" servings.  In fact, I wish more restaurants would trim down their heaping-plate serving sizes to do their part in reducing our epidemic fat-assery in this country.  BUT, they should contemplate lowering their price point for what most would consider an appetizer-sized portion.   These would have been reasonable at $10 or less per plate.\n\nI feel it necessary to point out that I very rarely gripe about prices at restaurants.   I am, by most accounts, a foodie, and I'm happy to pay $$$ for a meal (I recommend the $85 per person chef's menu at Koo) if I feel it is a unique experience, or a good value for the money.\n\nSo, in the end- thanks but no thanks, Piccino; I no longer live in Potrero Hill, so have no reason to go back to this restaurant unless I'm, once again, going to the 22nd Street Caltrain.   I think next time, I'll wait in line at Just for You Cafe and take the next train down...", "author": "Derek C."}

I commute from the 22nd station daily and probably hit up this coffee spot 2-3 a week. Yep, I'm that person waiting at 7am when it first opens up. And I'm not ashamed that one of the regular baristas simply looks at me and says \"soy latte?\" I don't drink the drip, so I suppose I can't speak for that, but my boyfriend and I both enjoy the espresso drinks immensely (he typically drinks non-fat cappuccinos or americanos). I will admit, Piccinos has officially made me a coffee addict.\n\nOn the pastry side! Also amazing. I'm a regular of the prune/plum muffin (I've seen it labeled both ways...although they seem pretty similar to me). The fresh berry coffee cake in the summer was TO DIE for and I can't wait for it to return. The current apple one is good, I'm just not a huge fan of cooked apples in general. If I'm looking for something sweeter, the cinnamon roll always hits the spot. The boyfriend loves the Pumpkin Muffin, but has also enjoyed several of the other pastry and has liked everything he has tried to date. \n\nI've been teetering about when I will try to Sow juice that they sell in the mornings... I haven't given in yet, but it's bound to happen someday soon. \n\nAnd yes, it is a bit pricier than other places--but honestly, it always feels like it's worth every penny.

This was absolutely considered the end of the earth by most San Franciscans. \n\nMy, have things changed. Granted it's been 12+ years but we're not gonna talk about that.\n\nNow it's an actual neighborhood called Dogpatch and it's the hottest, hippest destination in town. Piccino is well-positioned as the hub and an absolute must - especially if you're under the spell of the omnipotent wood-fired, Neapolitan-style pizza. With toppings like wild nettle, nectarine, whole milk and mint or roasted mushrooms, stracchino and shaved garlic there's no end in sight for this enchanting trend.\n\nBut pizza is far from the only reason to visit Piccino. I had a creamy, charred corn soup with relish, and a cheddar cauliflower, arugula, farro salad topped with almond gremolata that made me want to cry. Everything about this place is so hip it hurts. \n\nStarting with this understated-yet-oh-so-perfect centerpiece of onions. And their website, seriously I don't know what's more impressive - their food photos or their commitment to being the hub of this delightfully eclectic neighborhood.\n\nI went for lunch. And while I'm dying to go back for dinner, I can name a few reasons why a noontime visit is the way to roll. The daylight will give you lots of time to explore and take in the flavor of what makes this neighborhood so great. It will also give you time to get over the nervous breakdown that is sure to occur as you attempt to find parking in this neck of the woods.\n\nAfter lunch, check out neighboring MAC (Modern Appealing Clothing) then pop into the Piccino Coffee Bar next door, fuel up with a cup of Sightglass and head out to Poco Dolce for dessert. I know everybody is doing handcrafted chocolates but they are really doing it right plus it's fun to taste it at the source. Next head off to Wineworks and try your hand at making wine, or just sippin' it or just to check out a cool venue for a private event.\n\nOnce you calm down enough to consider getting back into your car, swing by Oliver's Butchery and grab an amazing cut of meat to whip up for dinner. \n\nNot a bad way to spend the day at the end of the earth if you ask me.", "author": "Michelle S."}

The journey here made me unsure and skeptical. But pulling up to the restaurant was a pleasant and adorable find. Very clean and modern-homey, the restaurant oozes of cream-of-the-cropness. No wonder it was all over the local press for 2011.\n\nWalking in just before 7pm, the restaurant was mildly filled. To my surprise, all the open tables were reserved and my dinning partner and I had to be sat at the bar. This was actually a good time, cause we got a front row seat to their open kitchen. Watching the chefs work was good insight to their legit skills, and incidentally keeping them on top of them game. We ordered a heavenly \"Funghi\" pizza that was thin, crispy and delicious, plus a meatball dish that was simple to the first impression, but to die for at the first bite. I washed it down with a red wine from their extensive and wide selection and ended with a beignet type dessert that came with a duo or dipping sauces. Sinful for sure.

Neighboring is a cute little wine retailer and a clothing shop, reminds me a lot of Hayes Valley. \n\nIt's super busy even on a Wednesday evening, filled most likely with Potrero Hill folks. Make sure you have reservations! Parking was (no surprise here) extremely easy. They have a changing menu, and a pretty extensive wine list.\n\nFood was a bit disappointing. Here's what we got:\n\nBREAD: seemed fresh but just didn't taste very good. The white part was insubstantial and I almost lost a tooth eating the crust. I covered mine in a whipped melted butter because I didn't appreciate the lemony olive oil dipping sauce. \n\nARUGULA TOMATO SALAD: prices here are fairly reasonable. But $10 for this tiny plate of arugula and a couple wedges of tomatoes and cucumbers didn't strike my fancy. It was fresh, decent, but not amazing - it tasted very home made. I did like the chunks of pan fried pizza dough.\n\nTALIATELLE w/TOMATO SAUCE: not sure if the pasta was fresh but it didn't have the right texture. It may have been undercooked or not fresh, and the portion was so small I think I might have been able to eat the whole portion in one bite (exaggeration). \n\nGYPSY PEPPER PANCETTA PIZZA: I thought I would love this pizza - can't go wrong with pancetta right? I don't know if I tasted the meat, there was no cheese, and overall lacked much flavor except tomato sauce (not seasoned well). I don't like the crust here because it is hard, think flatbread, but a little thicker. Also, the pizza is pretty small and too thin in the middle.\n\nSALSICCIA: the homemade sausage was the highlight of the night. Too bad there was so little of it.

Sucker for thin crust pizza!!!!! Tucked and hidden comes a cute, quaint, cozy, little italian cafe that i have fell inlove with. it was so enjoyable, i nearly ate 99% of my pizza pie. And they serve BLUE BOTTLE (oh san franciscan espresso lovers -- you know what i'm talking about!!!!)\n\n- food, light and fresh\n- prices, fair\n- service, impeccable\n- ambiance/space, very small\n\nMy friend use to live few buildings down and i've seen this spot but never bothered to try it out because it would always be filled with neighborhood regulars. I have decided to give it a try. this place servers blue bottle coffee so i was tempted to order a cafe latte but i've passed. walked pass the cafe bar and into the restaurant. their menu frequently changes for dinner but their brunch/lunch items usually stay consistent. sandwich vs. pizza. PIZZA!\n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\nMARGHERITA ($10) - tomato sauce, fresh mozzaralla, oregano. Kept my pizza simple since i'm on the 'healthy regein' and to judge a place by a simple dish. asked the waiter for the size of the pie and it is a 6' but very very thin crush. Definately not greasy!! The pie was served on a flat square wooden 'plate' ontop of parch paper (i think). i nearly ate my entire pie. The crust was so cripsy and delicious and light, the mozzarella was under the tomato sauce, usually its the sauce than the cheese. and there chopped fresh oregano sprinkled ontop of my pizza. mini itty bitty shaped leaves of oregano. i think that made my pizza extra tasty and perfect. LIGHT AND FRESH.\n\nThe wait staff was very pleasant. Even ones that were starting their shift when i was mid-way with my pizza. Everyone was just friendly and smiled all the time. Were they smiling at me because i'm a new face? were they smiling at me because i was eating alone? IDK but they were very friendly!!!! love that about a great place such as this spot.\n\nThis is an Italian cafe so they serve wine here. People who are drinking the wine know exactly what they want and regulars seem to pour into this place; i could see why, its a hidden cafe and locals from the neighborhood seem to know about this place. If i lived in the neighborhood, i'd totally be a regular too. \n\nWill I be back?

We really should've paid attention to all those negative reviews here on Yelp for the hostess service before we made the reservation.\n\nWe got to Piccino's at 6:25, went in, and there were 8-10 people blocking the doorway area. We waited for about a minute behind those people with no staff acknowledging our presence. So I went around and walked up to the Caucasian hostess who was looking at a computer screen and said hi. She looked up, with a blank and indifferent expression on her face:\n\n\"Can I help you?\"\n\"Yes, we have a reservation at 6:30\"\n\"Oh, blah for three?\"\n\"Yes\"\n\"You will be seated shortly\"\n\"Would it be possible for us to sit at that open corner table?\"\n\"That's a table for two, and will be turned in to a five for a later reservation\"\n\"Oh I see, that's ok then\"\n\nShe then left us with the others in-front of both the front door and the hostess bar, blocking the entry way and the staff grabbing drinks because she left no instruction for us where to wait. One by one, all the people in-front of us were seated, I guess everyone made reservations. After she seated the last couple, I went up to her:\n\n\"Excuse me, about when will we be seated? Were we not seated because the last person in our party is not here yet?\"\n\"No, I can seat just you two, but I can't because your table is not ready yet.\"\n\nShe then left again before I could get off another question. At this point my wife is clearly unhappy with the attitude of her service. Not once did she offer an apology for the delayed service or even a smile. She stopped the hostess after she came back, in a firm voice she asked:\n\n\"Excuse me, when will our table be ready?\"\nAt this point, the hostess is annoyed and agitated, in a condescending voice she said\n\"I seat only full parties, you're missing one person. Your table will be ready when the people occupying it leave!\"\n\"Do you have an approximate time for that?\"\n\"No, I don't know. They already paid, I don't know when they will leave. Maybe 10 minutes, maybe 20 minutes!\"\n\"But we have a reservation at 6:30!\"\n\"It's only 6:31, it's only one minute past your reservation!\"\n\"I really don't like your attitude.\"\n\"I don't like your attitude either!\"\n\"We have a good friend coming, we just really want to show her a good time. I don't think you're very polite, I don't want her to eat in this type of environment and service\"\n\"Well, you're not very polite either, you yelled at me.\"\n\"I didn't yell at you, I'm speaking to you in a firm and calm tone because you're mistreating us. I'm your customer, is this how you treat your customer?\"\n\nShe shook her head and went back to her computer screen. At this point I just stopped my wife and told her it's not worth it to be upset, let's not eat here anymore. The hostess is the face and the first impression of a restaurant, she already ruined it for Piccino, so it's pointless trying to eat here anymore. \n\nLuckily we found another good place and salvaged the night out with our friend.\nI've worked in the restaurant industry for 5 years and my family runs multiple restaurants, but this is the worst hostess service I've experienced. Here are some of my family secrets I'm willing to share to Piccino when it comes to service.\n\n1) It might be nice to greet all your customers with a smile and an acknowledgement when they first walk in. Why? Friendly service is part of your whole restaurant's dinning experience. Trust me when I say this, I can make all your overpriced, downsized dishes at home with better ingredients and tastes just as good if not better if I wanted to skip the service and atmosphere.\n2) It might be nice to set an expectation for how long the customer might wait. For example \"I'm sorry for the delay and thank you for being patient. I will try to seat you as soon as possible, you might have to wait for about x-xx amount of minutes because xxx.\"\n3) It might be nice to let people who have reservations to know how long they might have to wait if you can't seat them at the reserved time. Good restaurants get busy, and sometimes there are certain things beyond anyone's control, we all understand that. However, it's the hostess' job to keep customers in the loop about the wait time and apologize. It's arrogant to think an apology is not needed because it's \"only one minute\".\n4) Don't let the customer do your job for you. If customers have to initiate the \"greet and smile\" for you when they walk in, ask for the wait time, ask about where they will be seated, you have failed as a hostess.\n5) Last tip is for our hostess only. If you really hate your job, just quit. It will make your boss happier, your customers happier, and yourself happier.", "author": "Vince Y."}

The price are still a bit high for what you get but are in keeping with the income of the hipster and tech folks that have moved in the neighborhood in the last ten years. \n\nAll the food was tasty, small and very local.

The ambiance is VERY SF -- I took my old boss from New York there so she could get a true taste of yuppie SF -- lots of light, wood tables, earthy, and elegant. To start you can't go wrong with the farro and brasicas salad, if it's on the menu. The polpette is also very good if you're into something meaty. My favorite, however, is the margarita pizza. The pizza sauce is made with fresh tomatoes, hand-peeled (I asked for the recipe). The crust and cheese are good, but the star is really the sauce. They should bottle and sell the stuff!

This means that you can actually try multiple dishes w/o getting way too full. \n\nThe menu changes every quarter or so (seasonally) which is great. Plus the menu is super simple, with a good wine list. We generally always order an antipasti, something from the primi along with soup and just split one of the pizzas.", "author": "Al G."}

Trendy hornrims girl looked so put out when I refused the wine list and asked for a diet coke.  It's a business lunch at 11:00 on a weekday, Spruce, or whatever your name is.  Sorry, I didn't realize your establishment is too cool to stock plebian drinks like soda or even Pelligrino, I guess I'm the only troglodyte in SF supporting the billion dollar soda industry.  In any case, Ms. Disdainful with the gauche Kanji neck tattoo set the tone of the service.  The place isn't that cool; they are blaring U2 and Sting at top volume.  I settled for the lemonade, which was actually fresh lemons and water that you add your own simple syrup to.  Actually, not a bad idea.  \nI must say, after the service and the poor soundtrack I was fully prepared to hate the place and go the 1 or 2 star route, but I honestly can't due to one thing - the food is amazing!  The funghi pizza was incredible, as was my pasta.  Even the coffee ice cream with home made marshmallows was awesome. I'll definitely be back for the food; I'll just get take out so I can double park and also not have to deal with the wait staff.  \nBring your wallet tho - lunch for two (no wine, of course), with two entrees, appetizer, and dessert was over $100 with tax & tip.....", "author": "Ken P."}

We sat at the bar in front of the kitchen where we get to watch all the chefs and cooks in action, it is our favorite spot to sit every time we go to a restaurant. \n\nWe ordered a Funghi Pizza with Stracchino Cheese from Genoa. (Stracchino cheese is a fresh cheese orinated in Genoa Italy that is closely resemble a combination between cream chesee, but lighter in texture and the tanginess of creme fraiche.) Our very thin crust, crispy pizzas arrived and the based was covered with flavorful sauteed ground mushrooms, topped with more piece of mushrooms the stracchino cheese and thinly shaved garlic. There was no sauce of any kind in this pizza and it was the good call by the chef. The aroma of the mushroom was so potent, and the cheese was light and creamy with the thinly sliced garlic flakes that was not at all over powering the rest of the ingredients they shared in that pizza. All in all, the perfect flavor, taste and aroma combination. Bravo! \n\nOur server, a very friendly French guy from France's Loire Valley recommended a glass of red for my dining companion and a Pinot Blanc from Italy for me and they paired really nicely with our pizza. Good wine list, great food with menu changes daily I believe and that tells me that they only cook with ingredients that are in season. Overall, it was a great afternoon snacks for a post work week.

High quality olive oil makes a world of a difference!\n\nLa tur, hen of the woods mushroom and caramelized onion bruschetta - La tur is the best cheese I think I've ever had. It had the texture of goat chese but a subtle flavor of brie and was amazingly delicious. I kept the cheese and asked for some bread on the side to finish it up.\n\nCelery root soup, spigarello pesto and toasted walnut - very tasty and perfect for a chilly Sunday morning. They were kind enough to split the soup into two different bowls without us asking.\n\nFunghi Pizza: roasted mushrooms, stracchino and shaved garlic - We got this with an egg on it (were trying to make it a little brunch like) and it was SO delicious.

Kind of an odd experience to watch women shopping for summer dresses while eating, but fun nonetheless.\n\nMy friend and I were deep in conversation for most of the evening and the waiter was very good at being attentitive, yet giving us our space.

We both enjoyed the farro and ate most of it before the waiter took it away (again, too busy talking and not paying attention, and he probably didn't want to disturb us, otherwise, the plate would have been clean when he took it) The cabbage salad was a good-sized portion and very tasty.\n\nEntrees:\n- slow poached halibut, basil-ginger broth, artichokes, potatoes, lime\n- pork and beef polpette, crushed tomato, parmesan\n\nInitially they brought us the wrong entrees, but they corrected their mistake fairly quickly.\n\nThe halibut was kind of bad, which was really disappointing because I love slow-poached fish and it's really easy to do well. My halibut smelled fishy (not fresh) and it was overcooked. The basil ginger broth was too subtle for me. Not a lot of flavor. A big miss for them.\n\nThe pork and beef polpette was tasty, and seasoned well. \n\nDessert:\n- date macadamia nut cake, buttermilk caramel, kumquat, cr\u00e8me fraiche\n\nThe dessert was tasty but a bit too dense for me.

It was a warm night and really too bad that the windows didn't open because some fresh air would have been nice and there were flies buzzing around (which bugged the heck out of us) which could have been released.\n\nService was excellent. Could not have asked for a better waitress than Hana.  The other people who came to the table were cheerful and attentive.  It was a bit much to have someone top off my water glass every few minutes with the carafe that was right on the table.  I appreciate the attention, but I can do that myself and it would be less interuption of the conversation my friend and I were having.\n\nSkip the appetizers.  They are really tiny.  The artichoke was really an artichoke heart cut into four little pieces.  But the pizza was big and the atmosphere fun.\n\nI took the T-line and walked from 20th & Third and felt perfectly safe, so don't let the neighborhood keep you from enjoying this place.\n\nThey have outdoor seating.", "author": "Bay G."}

Whether offering Blue Bottle coffee as it previously did, or Sightglass coffee, as it does now, what really does it for me is the location. You definitely don't feel like you're still in the city but you're minutes away from great places to stroll.\n\nI appreciate the new cafe more than I did the previous one; there are now places to sit inside. The baked goods are considerably more delectable. The ambiance is much more rustic; I feel like I'm in some off-the-grid Spanish or Italian town when I walk in - somewhat expecting a stray dog to amble by outside or old men to throw around a bocce ball.\n\nIf you like everything that comes with great San Francisco coffee but you don't like the laptops and lines - this place gets you in and out so you can begin roaming around the oldest Victorians in San Francisco.", "author": "Amir S."}

There is plenty of seating at this new addition to the Dogpatch neighborhood.\n\nMy friend and I met for lunch here and shared the recommended Salsiccia Pizza, with its house made slightly spicy sausage.  The crust was crisp and airy, just how I like my thin crust pizzas.  For the appetizer, we also had a deliciously simple roasted beet, bleu cheese, and what appeared to be baked and crispy kale leaves.

Alas, I did not love Piccino.\n\nMuch has been written about the new space and I'll just say that I agree with everything that has been said, it is beautiful. Do note that it is extremely loud and at 8pm on a Friday night, the wait was around an hour.\n\nOnce seated, we come up with a game plan. We love to share (sharing is caring!) so ordered a number of items.\n\nPickled veggies: so good, actually the highlight of our meal. Who knew you could pickle a grape? Only gripe - these took over 20 minutes to arrive after ordering. C'mon, we know you're not just pickling them now...what took so long?\n\nBlack mission fig, fourme d'ambert, toasted walnut and fennel: these were fine, pretty tasty but the portion size seemed off for $11\n\nHeirloom tomato, lemon cucumber and wild arugula panzanella: the tomatoes were awesome, the bread nice and crunchy, but this dish suffered from being WAY overdressed. I literally had to choke down a couple of bites because it was so vinegary. \n\nBaked semolina gnocchi, poached egg, zucchini caponata and olive pur\u00e9e: our least favorite dish of the night. I pictured little pillows of perfection on a plate, instead this was one jumbled mess.\n\nPizza Bianca: loved the crust but the pizza itself didn't come together at all. WAY too much garlic, we joked after that this was glorified garlic bread. \n\nChocolate budino, brul\u00e9ed zabaglione, albion strawberries: our meal ended on a high note, this was a fantastic dessert.\n\nService was fine though we did have a long wait between ordering and our first dish being brought out. And then they brought the pizza and gnocchi at the same time which made for a tetris like exercise of rearranging our tiny table with all this stuff on it.\n\nOverall, I was quite disappointed in our meal at Piccino.

I usually go to Sightglass in the SOMA near my home, but ventured off to Piccino's near my studio. \n\nLike the usual coffee shop in the morning, it was crazy busy. I waited about 20 minutes total to get my cup. I order an Americano and always drink my coffee black. The barista calls out my order and hands it off. I inspected the coffee and it looked pretty peculiar. I thought, \"wow, what happened to the crema?!\" Rather than looking caramel in color like it should, it was mud black. Hence, like I expected the coffee was bitter and void of complex flavor. Either the barista doesn't know how to pack the espresso properly or the machine needs to be seriously calibrated. \n\nWhat else could go wrong? \n\nThe girl working the counter not only handed my card to another customer (it has my picture on it), but gave that person my receipt! Sadly, I had no control over how much tip to leave because the stranger had already filled in some arbitrary amount. Fed up, I signed the receipt, demanded a replacement drip cup and rushed back late to work.   \n\nI've worked many years as a barista in the past and it was odd that the staff appeared to be confused by my comments about the crema. I understand that shops get busy in the morning, but consistency from cup-to-cup is what you expect for paying a premium. \n\nI do have to give them credit that they didn't contest my disappointment and responded appropriately to my request for an alternative replacement.

The gnocchi was large and flat which was different from what i am used to, but loved it nonetheless.\n\nThen we had pizza...it was good, we added an egg.  we had the one with the prosciutto...my second visit i had the pepperoni one with egg...i think i prefer that one better, but both were tasty.  crisp thin crust...yum.\n\nLastly we had dessert.  we had the zeppole...and the lavender cheesecake.

First on the food: Only so so. The crispy polenta with burrata was quite good (though not big enough), and the beef tartar was decent as well. But the pizzas, which I thought would have been their strong suit, were underwhelming.  Unfortunately, while the food was passable, though at times disappointing, the service is what made the experience worse than it should have been. \n\nSpecifically:\n\n1. We had a reservation for 5:45 under the pretense that we needed to be out by 8 before the next reservation. Everyone in our 9 person party new this, though the hostess didn't miss an opportunity to tell every single person in our party as they walked through the door (You know you have to be done by 8, right?).  Even when the birthday girl arrived 20 minutes late after suffering through brutal traffic to get to the restaurant, the welcome message was the same. (Oh good, you're here. You know you have to be gone at 8, right?) \n\n2. As I mentioned it was my girlfriend's birthday and we brought two cakes as a surprise. When I asked the hostess if she could take the cakes to the back and bring them out after we finished our meal, she grimaced, as if there was something wrong with that, and agreed to our request with reluctance. Note to Piccino: you might talk to your hostess (this was the night of July 31) about her customer service skills!\n\nOn top of it all, they charged us a fee of $3 per person for the 9 person table just to cut the cake!!!

However, they really raised the bar with the new location in Dog Patch.  It's chicness is only surpassed by the food (and wine options...more on that in a sec).  I was there with a group of 5, so had the opportunity to try a bunch of different items.  Definitely get the pickled vegetables if they have them (including the aforementioned pickled grapes), and the cauliflower appetizer is a must (I hate nuts and still loved this app).  I can personally attest for the margherita and fungi pizza's - note, the fungi didn't last on the table too long it was that good.  I can also note that the margherita does its pizza job well and tastes excellent cold the next morning.\n\nSome others in my group had the halibut (went over well) and kale (again, I don't normally like kale, but this was fantastic).  We also had the roasted turnips - I didn't love that, but it might be a texture thing and not a flavor issue if you know what I mean.\n\nAnyway, I finished it off with ice cream.  Not sure if they make it themselves, but it was bi-rite worthy.\n\nThe staff is super friendly, fun and quite hip - it's a bit hard to tell where the patrons end and the staff starts, that's how comfortable they make you feel.  Oh, about the wine - make sure to ask \"Justin\" if he's working for a wine pairing recommendation to your meal.

No, I am not speaking of every staff member because there were some pretty great people helping but it did not smoother the arrogance in the air. \n\nWe had a large party and did our best not to annoy anyone but the owner (I presume the owner because she acted like it) was just not having it. One of the pictures feel about eight inches in back someone and she freaked out, started making some of us feel uncomfortable by telling all of the staff what had happened. She was right next to us discussing the incident to her staff and was not shy about it. That was just not professional, talk crap about us in the back but why in front of us?\n\nVery sorry we caused you such grief but don't make your guest who pay for your salary feel like crap. Very sorry you could not hang up your painting securely, I know some great ways to secure it. Very sorry we chose your establishment. And after all of that, she had to comment while we were leaving which was almost an hour after the incident about how precious her painting meant. Heck, I would have been happy if she would have just billed us instead of making us feel so bad. \n\nOh, and the bread incident!!!! BREAD, they actually took the bread from one end of the table to the other to feed all of us. BREAD!!! Just charge us for the bread and give us a lot of it. ARE YOU INSANE? The server even asked us who ordered the bread. Just put the bread down and get us more, very simple.\n\nBesides that, the food was great as always but I for one am very hesitant to spend my money there again. Why, because there are so many great restaurants in San Francisco that would not make twenty plus guest feel like crap over a painting and actually I think it was just a print of a painting. \n\nYes, I am extremely mad because I love the food and generally I love the service but I would love it even more if the owner never served me ever again because she really does not understand the food service industry. \n\nSorry but I was just saddened because today was a wonderful day ruined by an owner who can not control her emotions.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-01-28", "description": "Came here on a spur of the moment decision on a late Saturday night and were promptly seated.  We chose bar seating so we could see the chefs at work.\n\nPiccino is located in the Dogpatch but away from the action on 3rd street.  Rather, it's tucked away in a hidden cul de sac adjacent to the Muni depot.  Still, the place was pretty happening when we arrived (guess word of mouth travels fast, especially when it's mostly good reviews).\n\nBasic impression is that the menu is creative and the execution top notch.  There are items on the menu that are unique.  For starters we had the roasted cauliflower with  farro and almond gremolata, which while simple, was a tastefully prepared dish.  Temperature wise, we were surprised to find the dish was not hot at all, but this simply added to the freshness of the plate.\n\nThe baked gnocchi was a completely unexpected dish (although to be fair, our server gave us a heads up).  Not your typical bite-size gnocchi made from pasta, this \"Roman-style\" pasta was made from semolina and resembled a large patty of polenta.  This was artfully topped with root vegetable caponata, olive, dried plum and a poached egg on top.  Although entirely vegetarian, the caponata gave the dish a hearty bite and if one didn't realize it, you would think there was meat in it.  Our server actually said it could remind one of an African-inspired dish, which I felt was a perfect description based on my experience.\n\nFor pizza, we went with the funghi (roasted mushrooms, stracchino and shaved garlic).  The crust was perfect - extremely thin but crunchy and not burnt like in other places.  It was not only covered generously covered with mushrooms, there was also a ground mushroom paste that to me resembled an olive tapennade spread - which was a bit too earthy and overpowering for me.  On the flip side, the stracchino, with its stretchy texture and mild taste, could have used a bit more bite.  \n\nOverall, the execution of the dishes was great and I'm eager to come back and try different dishes to compare (e.g. the straightforward margherita pizza, the kale & butternut squash salad).  Also, they ran out of the zeppole (beignets), which looked amazing but we'll just have to wait until next time to try.\n\nDecor is great, very inviting with warm lighting and homey yet roomy feel.\n\n\n poached egg, root vegetable caponata, olive and dried plum", "author": "F.

Expect a full house and a wait for dinner, I'd advise to make reservations for sure. \n\nAs for the food, I would recommend going family style. Portions are small and best shared around the table.  Primi's weren't all that memorable and a little overpriced for what you get. Fettuccine was a little salty and very small for $18. The Polpettes (meatballs) were pretty tasty but not tasty enough to merit the $14 price tag for five. Semolina gnocchi was probably the best; a delightful blend of savory, tart, and sweet. \n\nWas hovering on the 3-3.5 star review as the service was slow too, but then the PIZZAS came. Seriously among the BEST pizza I've had in SF. Go for the margherita for sure- simple and really really well done. And the Funghi is outstanding as well. \n\nBottom line recommendation? Go for an early lunch, order a pizza and a beer; skip the crowd and don't fret the primi's unless one sounds particularly appealing to you!", "author": "Chris D."}

The coffee is perfectly frothed,  tastes amazing, never overcooked, and beautifully presented.   But the coffee isn't the reason I go out of my way for Piccino's.  You can get good Blue Bottle coffee in a bunch of places around the city.  They have, without question, the best morning sweets of anywhere I've been.  They have this apricot bread that is to die for, the best chocolate chip cookies I've had and these little cinnamon roll clusters that are unlike anything I've had before - like someone just took the center out of a cinnamon roll and stuck them together.   Just recently they added a pistachio torte that is something I've only seen in France and desperately needed over here in the states.  I could go on and on.\n\nAlso, to address the wait.  It is a bit slow sometimes, but it is worth waiting for!  Every time I've been waiting I've met some really cool people.  Last time I was in line I stood behind Michael Recchiuti, the guy that makes my favorite chocolate.  And before that it was a guy from twitter with some great stories.

My favorite is probably the salsiccia pizza and the broccoli di ciccio (love the toasted almonds). James and the crew always do such a superb job of recommending good wine that I've really expanded my wine repertoire since I started dining here. \n\nBeing a pizza fanatic, I can only think of two other places that have pizza that rival - possibly Zuni Cafe and Chez Panisse Cafe. Maybe Piccino doesn't have as much variety as Pizzetta 211, but that's fine by me, I'll come here for the great ambience, food, wine, and service any day.  \n\nIf you love to geek out and watch them cook, I recommend a seat at the counter. \n\nLast, but not least, the staff are cool as hell - thank you Holly, Julian, Justin and James for making the restaurant so welcoming!", "author": "S C."}

We stopped on a cloudy grey day that thankfully was not too cold in Potrero/ Dogpatch. At around 2:30pm, Just for You was about to close, so we swung by Piccino for a look.  A glance at the menu and the metal-topped tables outside (we had puppy with us) and we decided to stay.  Note that they have overhead heaters only on one side of the establishment.\n\nThe brunch menu is small, but it's creative and thoughtfully put together.  There was a glorious white breakfast pizza of pears, bleu cheese and greens, to be topped with an optional egg and bacon; I picked a very hot cazuela of erbette chard, potatoes, lamb sausage and 2 eggs.  Both were perfect brunch dishes, delicious and satisfying.  We finished with a dessert of piping hot zeppoli -- Italian doughnuts stuffed with ricotta and dusted with powdered sugar.  \n\nService was so friendly and warm - they should write the manual on making customers comfortable... one of our servers noticed a mushroom book that the husband had been carrying around, and we chatted briefly about seasonal foraging.\n\nThey're on Twitter and have advertised special events like a whole Pig Roast with Roli Roti, or oysters from Hog Island.

Watching the kitchen staff care-fully & lovingly assemble beautiful meals while seated at the counter, is a treat. The food is off the charts fantastic and consistent. The portions are sane. The creativity and wholesomeness is inspiring.  If you are looking for a cheap meal in a restaurant with wifi, go somewhere else...you will not have good things to say about this place.

All of their coffee is made with blue bottle beans from oakland and made to order (even each cup of coffee).  \n\nThe coffee is superb, the location is great if you live in the neighborhood but the service is a little hit or miss.  \n\nThere is no real rhyme or reason to how they do things.  A couple times I would order my coffee and then I'd just kinda stand around waiting.  The person working the espresso machine would be doing his thing and the person who took my order would just kinda turn around and either get my coffee going or tend to someone else's drip.  I'm used to the \"order and pay\" flow of commerce and here it was \"order and stand around... or pay... or wait until the coffee was done then pay... or pay immediately...\"  Also, when it gets a little more busy, the queue to pick up drinks is a little haphazard and crowded.\n\nEveryone was friendly though - I think the goal is to just be real casual here - so if that's the case then they've succeeded.  \n\nFor those who like the starbucks style drinks with every flavor of syrup under the sun, go somewhere else.

It kind of sucked, but it seemed like in the time we were waiting, we could have taken 3 of those seats, eaten and left. But I can understand why they wouldn't want to take that chance...\n\nAnyways about the service and food...\n\nEvery staff member was exceptionally polite and the wine-tender was really nice and helpful and gave a great suggestion. So if you are unsure about what to get, they have good taste there. \n\nI ordered the pickled grapes (or the veggies, at least I think that's what its called on the menu). They were awesome! I was afraid they would be too sour, but they were just the right blend of pickled and grape. \n\nI got the funghi pizza, and this was the most amazing pizza I have EVER had! I nearly forgot to chew at times. It was creamy, crispy, and the had the perfect amount of mushroom texture. I really think this place is better than Delfina.", "author": "Brandon R."}

Well balanced and complex flavors that were neither subtle nor obvious.

I literally forgot what I was talking about when I had took my first bite of one dish. My friend had to remind me of my story. \n\nI really appreciated the kitchen's attention to detail.  Portions were appropriate and so well balanced that while scraping the plate there was still the perfect amount of each ingredient.  A great example of a creative and balanced dish was the salmon.  Perfectly cooked fish with darkly crusted skin and tons of flavor over nectarines, squash and avacado.

It was a beautiful day and everything we ate hit the spot! Love the ambiance of the area during the day, and I'm also a huge fan of open kitchen designs\n\nWe started off with some antipasti to nibble on- the pickled vegetables were gorgeous and the flavors danced in my mouth. I also ate the best marinated olives I've ever had!\n\nThen we had the pork/beef polpette to share, which was the juiciest most succulent meatballs I've ever had. I'd definitely go back for these, the sauce was the perfect sweet/acid combination. \n\nAfter that we shared three pizzas between the 4 of us. Loved the thin crust. They did the classic pepperoni really well. The salsiccia (house made sausage, mozzarella and red onion) was creamy and rich, but after those amazing meatballs I had earlier I wish the sausage flavor was a bit more developed; I like my herbs.\n\nI guess the last pizza, the napoletana, was a pretty big disappointment. I love olives, and I love anchovies, but if it wasn't for the sweet sauce on there (this pizza has no cheese) then the anchovies would have taken over the whole dish; it was SO FRIGGIN SALTY!! Definitely the saltiest anchovies I have ever had and it really was kind of unpleasant to finish, it just wasn't balanced and needed some acidic flavor/lemon or something in my opinion - would not recommend it at all.\n\nThere's also a tasty beer selection, they were bottled but delightful.

There was no host station, so you just had to pick out the woman with a clipboard and try to get her attention.  It took a few minutes for her to seat us, but once she did, the wait staff was lovely and attentive.  Only additional complaint there was that it took a really long time to get our pizza.  Of note, the sommelier was great.  I am super excited about food, and people who are excited about food, and our sommelier's enthusiasm about wine was really lovely.\n\nThe food was delicious.  Among the standouts were the butter bean and broccoli rabe soup - amazingly savory, with all the beautiful components singing together in perfect harmony.   We had the pizza bianca, which was delightfully garlicky, and the cavolfiore - cauliflower, capers, and the most amazingly titillating pickled chiles.

The other pizza we had was the Napoletana.  This one exemplifies the lack of balance.  The toppings were far too salty (which says a lot considering I love anchovies, olives and capers (all together).  In addition, the pizza had too much sauce.

Also a rarity is the old school, generous pours of wine.  I'm not talking about a 3 oz. glass filled to the rim, but a good quality wine glass filled with 5 oz. of goodness and enough room to swirl, sniff and sip.

They lost some $$ there, because we would have definitely bought more wine, but I'm sure that will be rectified shortly.\n\nAll in all, its a charming location, nice decor, easy parking and great food and service.  We will be back!\n\n***Note to parents.....please take the \"not good for kids\" rating seriously.  We were told by our friend that made the reservation that it was ok to bring our 17 month old.  Not so.  Not only does the ambience not support a toddler, they don't even have ONE HIGHCHAIR.  We had to hold our squirmy girl the whole dinner, which took away some fun for us.  Totally our own fault, but definitely worth a babysitter for this place!", "author": "Sara J."}

Piccino is in the Dogpatch, where parking is aplenty. It was surprisingly easy to get a table at with 10 minutes notice, and with it being a warmish night (for SF), we were able to sit outside. Easy menu choices, great meatballs (aka polpette), and pretty decent pizza. I liked the crust's flavor and the lightness of the margherita and pepperoni pizzas' sauce. They also have maybe three beers to choose from, but they are all great local choices, and I definitely recommend this one in particular if I could remember its name (it'll come to me...). As a cheese lover, I would recommend a little more (ok, a lot) more cheese on the pizzas though. \n\nThis place isn't all about the hype and the food is good quality, so I'd recommend it even over my Trader Joe's frozen stuff!", "author": "Kim S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-07-20", "description": "I wasn't a big fan of the old Piccino.  It wasn't that I hated it, I just never understood all the fuss about their pizzas being so great.  To me they were like putting cheese and toppings on flatbread, putting it in the oven, and then serving.  The pizzas were super thin, tiny, and not very satisfying.  \n\nEven though I live very close to Piccino, I had't been to the new restaurant down the street from the old one.  I was meeting a friend for lunch and suggested we go to Piccino so I could finally try it.  We were meeting for an early lunch at 11:30 so when we got there we were the only ones in there.  When I first walked in, the first thing I noticed was the natural earthy feel of the restaurant (light wood floors and wood tables) and all the natural light the restaurant receives.  It has very high ceilings and there is lots of space in the restaurant.  \n\nThe first thing I ordered was a Diet Coke, not thinking I was saying anything wrong.  I was rebuffed by the waiter who informed me that Piccino does not serve soda because they want to serve healthy options.  What??  No soda??  Shouldn't you leave the decision about soda up to the customer?  I understand the healthy angle, but its not like you guys are Cafe Gratitude.  You can't serve pizza and not serve soda?!?!  They go together like peanut butter and jelly, ice cream and pie, Eddie Van Halen and David Lee Roth!  Having one without the other is a crime.  (this is why its 4 stars instead of 5)\n\nMy friend and I started our meal by sharing the two appetizers.  We ordered the 'Caramelized squash, farro and almond gremolata' and the 'Pork and beef polpette' which is a just a fancy italian name for meatballs.\n\nBoth of the dishes were delicious although I think $12 for 5 small meatballs (especially being an appetizer) is too expensive.\n\nNot being a fan of their pizza, I ordered the 'Chickpea fritter sandwich which had lemon yogurt and red pickled onions inside.  The sandwich also came with a small side of arugula salad.  The sandwich was small but in the name of healthy it was the right size as I had no intention of wanting to be bloated.  The sandwich was delicious and I would definitely order it again.\n\nOverall I like the new restaurant, but I'm not sure it would have the same feel at night.  Also, I think this restaurant is overpriced.  Our final bill with 15% tip came to be $50.  $50 for lunch for two people is too much.  Also, this soda thing is a real problem.\n\nDefinitely worth checking out, but bring your own soda to go with your pizza.", "author": "Ash S."}

We unfortunately had to cancel, but I came here literally the next day because the menu was so appealing and I couldn't stop thinking about it.\n\nThey were unfortunately out of the Red pizza which I desperately wanted (tomato sauce, goat cheese, roasted peppers, olives and arugula - i'm drooling just thinking about how amazing that is going to be...), so we instead shared a Margherita and a White pizza and added 2 eggs to the white.\n\nThe pizzas were both EXCELLENT.  The fresh tomato sauce on the red was tangy and delicious.  There was not a ton of cheese, which I was at first disappointed to note, but it actually did not matter.  It was still wonderful pizza!  For this little cheese fiend to say that, you KNOW it has to be good!\n\nThe white was the standout pizza of the evening.  It had a perfect blend of fresh tomatoes, zucchini, fresh oregano and herbs and garlic.  It was Cheeseboard-esque and bursting with flavor.  The two eggs on top were an awesome touch.  If you've never had eggs on top of your pizza, I highly recommend it.  We dipped the pizza in the runny yoke and were in heaven.", "author": "Julie S."}

But unfortunately it was much too sparse for me to even really consider it a pizza.

We chose items recommended by him- a delish Heirloom Polenta & Burratta- quite lovely . Also ordered Roasted Cauliflower & Chicory w/Creme Fraiche & anchovy salad. This did not arrive until after main course as it was forgotten.. Beef Cheeks w/mashed rutabaga & cippolini onions.  Unfortunately, the beef was very fatty/gristly, rutabaga intensely over powered with horseradish.  I think we ordered wrong.

Their crispy, thin crust is perfection...Mmm.  \n\nMargherita pizzas are always my baseline when eating at pizza restaurants and Piccino's is delightful...lots of fresh tomato sauce with a nice balance of cheese and basil.  Their funghi/mushroom pizza puts other restaurants versions to shame.  What sets it apart is that they not only put roasted mushrooms on the pizza, but also spread a chopped mushroom and garlic pesto-like mixture on it as well...all accentuated with a super creamy stracchino cheese.  Absolutely sublime!  \n\nTheir gnocchi should also not be missed...very different from your traditionally dense gnocchi.  These huge semolina pillows are served with roasted wild mushrooms and mouth-watering chunks of pancetta.

I've never been to a restaurant where people basically say, \"so what?\" which is how they treated us. \n\nIt's a shame because I LOVE the food. It's the perfect combination of fresh and hearty and makes you proud of what the bay area offers in refined, natura, innovative traditional italian meals. Piccino knows how to use their flavors and do an impeccable job of combining a perfect balance of flavors. \n\nBut again, the service is cold and leaves a sour taste in your mouth.

Having just moved from Colorado, I was not used to the higher coffee prices in SF and initially balked at the $2.50 Piccino was asking for a regular-sized coffee.   \n\nBut after tasting my coffee I found myself saying, \"This is a a great cup of coffee\".  Not just good, but great.  Like you don't ever want to the cup to end kind of great.  Like \"$2.50\" is MORE than reasonable kind of great.  The coffee is so rich and robust you don't even need to put sugar in it.  It almost has a sweet smell to it.  \n\nAnd the service is also wonderful and prompt.  I don't know that I can offer any complaints whatsoever about my experiences at Piccino since that first day, except maybe that I wish there was a large size coffee on their menu.  The coffee is just so good you want it to last a little longer.  \n\nThumbs up to the Barrista staff (Aussie Guy, Tall Blond Smiley Gal, Dark-haired Beanie Kid, Asian Gal, Thin Beard Man, Serene Librarian Guy with Glasses).  Even with a longish line and time intensive Blue-Bottle coffee making methods, they manage to keep things flowing at a good clip.

And I mean it.\n\nI think a lot of the less-than-stellar reviews are from folks who just don't \"get\" this place.  Piccino is different, it's very much its own place--go there with an open mind and senses, not in a rush, and you will love it.\n\nWhat is it about this place?  Piccino has nailed a wonderful and difficult-to-achieve aesthetic in every aspect of its operation.  The service and ambience are friendly and comfortable.  The food is superbly fresh, simple, restrained, and beautiful.  It's much closer to what \"homemade\" would be if you were a stellar cook than almost any restaurant food available these days.  That's the whole \"restraint\" thing: nothing at Piccino is over-salted or over-cheesed or over-buttered, like you get at most restaurants.  Restraint in food is so hard to find in this day and age...\n\nYet Piccino manages that restraint while still being creative and inventive (and a little bit funky).  Which is to say that while it's never boring, there is also never anything fussy about it. You'll find none of the rampant \"novelty for novelty's sake\" trend that tends to dominate the restaurant industry.  Just beautiful food.\n\nAs many have pointed out, the pizza is fantastic, wonderfully crisp and just the right amount of toppings.  We often try the specials, but we particularly love the funghi pizza with egg (divine). The salads are delicious and inventive while remaining somehow classic.  I also love the antipasti platter and the polpette (meatballs).  And blue bottle coffee!  The wine list is also well-edited. For a reasonable splurge, try the Sesti.\n\nFor the quality of the ingredients, and working closely with farmers, this place is not overpriced--in fact, I think it's an amazing value given the overall quality of food.\n\nIf only there were more places like this!

My boyfriend ordered a margherita pizza. I had already eaten lunch and got the homemade sesame, poppy, and nigella crackers. The pizza arrived with a charred, crispy crust. Both the waiter and chef offered to let my boyfriend have it and get a new pizza, on the house, without the crispy crust. He said, okay. I tried a piece of the crispy pizza, and thought it was perfect. It matched my pizza criteria. When the new pizza came, I must confess I didn't like it as much because the crust wasn't as good, but I thought everyone was super sweet to offer it to us. And my crackers were fabulous, far better than any store bought crackers. The desserts looked divine, but we were stuffed.", "author": "Eva UnTiger S."}

I've eaten here tens of times, before and after their move to the new location, and I've never had a bad meal.  However, the service is spotty and can be really quite bad.  It's often hard to get a refill for a glass of wine, so start trying to flag someone down when you still have about 1/3 glass left.   \n\nHowever, the worst experience I ever had was with the short female hostess who works on weekends.  A few months ago we had an 8:00 Friday reservation and when we arrived there were a lot of people there waiting.  I understand restaurants, particularly popular restaurants, running behind on the weekends.  I'm from New York, I'm used to waiting.  However, after 15 minutes we ask when she anticipates we might sit down.  She says \"we're very busy tonight.\"  No kidding?  We ask after another 15 minutes and she still doesn't know.  However, this time she asks: \n\n\"Can I at least get you a glass of wine...on you, of course.\"  \n\nAre you f***ing kidding me?  \n\nLet's be clear here, I do believe if a restaurant is way behind on reservations that they should offer a glass of wine to recognize the inconvenience to their patrons.  It doesn't need to be an expensive wine; it could simply be a glass of house wine, just a little something.  It goes a long way to making an unhappy client less unhappy.  Frankly, if they just had a bar where we could have ordered drinks while waiting, I still wouldn't have minded so much, but to have the hostess spell out that any wine we ordered would be \"on us\" after having us wait 30 minutes.  Seriously, I was ready to bitch slap the woman.  I am still amazed that anyone would say that to their client.  Needless to say we got into a little bit of a verbal altercation.  When we sat down, about an hour after our reservation, the waitress apologized and was excellent.  The wine we ordered while waiting was on the bill.  No surprise there but still notable.  \n\nThis only happened once, but then we don't normally go to Piccino on weekends.  Anyway, despite this, the food really is quite good and worth returning for.  Though perhaps not on a weekend.\n\nItems not to be missed include:\n\nThe squash and faro appetizer\nThe Fungi Pizza \nThe lamb ragu\nAlmost any of their side veggies (brussel sprouts and carrots were excellent)\n\nI love sitting at the kitchen bar so you can watch the chefs work.  The atmosphere is great and the wine list small but pretty good.  A bit on the expensive side for the menu.  I would expect a few more lower priced glasses (most were in the 13 -14 range), but it's still good.\n\nMy recommendations to Piccino are:\n\n1) Fire the awful hostess\n2) Take over the clothing store next to restaurant and turn it into a wine bar ala Bar Jamon/ Casa Mono in New York.  Give people a place to wait and order a drink and perhaps even a few snacks.  Dogpatch could easily support another wine bar and it just makes so much sense given Piccino's popularity and long wait times.", "author": "Jennifer C."}

Just a note, even though this is an Italian restaurant, they serve very few, if any, pasta dishes at lunch (mostly salads, pizzas, and a few soups).

We walked in and was greeted by the hostess and was told that we had to wait for about 20 minutes or so but while we waited, the bartender discussed some wine choices for my friend (I don't drink) and my friend settled on something for while we waited. I was offered non-alcoholic beverages but I opted not to. There wasn't much space for a waiting area which kind of sucked but it wasn't terrible either although we did needed to dodge people coming in and out. About 15 minutes went by and we were seated at the counter.\n\nMenus were brought out to us and we started with the burrata, asparagus, polenta, and sea salt salad to start. It wasn't bad but I felt like that the dressing was a bit too strong, especially on the watercress when being paired with the more delicate flavors of the polenta and asparagus. The polenta and asparagus was very good though.\n\nI ordered the funghi pizza while my friend ordered pappardelle with peas. It took a while for our food to arrive and unfortunately, my pizza arrived before my friend's pasta which isn't a huge deal for me but I can guess some people may have some issue with that. The pizza was okay but was sort of one dimensional. What I mean by that is that even though the flavors were there, it was sort of the same thing over and over again without variation. The pizza had some sliced mushrooms as well as what I can only describe as globs of melted cheeses here and there. The base of it was covered in a ground up mushroom paste/sauce. After a while, I was sort of bored with it which is unfortunate but luckily my friend helped me with it, otherwise I don't think I could have finished it by myself. I like mushrooms but the pizza didn't cut it for me.\n\nOur waiter came by to check in with us and offered my friend a different wine and he tried it out and decided that he liked it more than the first and got a glass of it. The bartender also came by at one point to ask if my friend wanted something else to try while we were waiting for the waiter to come by with the wine so that was nice.\n\nWe finished our entrees somewhat late, around 10'ish and our waiter brought the dessert menu over. We decided to split an ice cream sandwich (no idea how we were going to do that but we were determined) but unfortunately, the waiter told us that they were all out and suggested an alternative. Nothing else seemed to interest us so we decided to skip dessert.\n\nOver all, I enjoyed my experience here and wouldn't be opposed to coming back. Based from my pizza, it was a 3 star and I would give service 1 star (I don't think I would give any service more than 1 star in case that seems little to some of you).

Piccino, being a solid 4.5, fell into that basket until tonight, when an unexpected side effect of their open kitchen pushed it firmly into the 5 star range. I'm afraid saying why is going to breach a rule of etiquette, but I'm reporting something that reflects well on them so I'm going to make an exception.\n\nJust so you know, ordering more than 2 or 3 items blows this place out of the $$ range into the $$$ range, and it's best for people with moderate to small appetites, but the quality makes it a worthwhile choice. To their credit, they post their prices on their website menus, so you can judge for yourself.\n\nI started with the pickled vegetables, 4 stars. What set them above others I've tried elsewhere is that you could taste the individual ingredients through the pickling flavor. A bit pricey at $6.\n\nNext, the broccoli pizza with crescenza, olive, almond and calabrian chili. The flavor was wonderful, the crust crisp but not burnt, and the broccoli well shredded so I wasn't biting into big chunks. 5 stars\n\nAs an aside, I had a side of roasted baby carrots with sherry and cumin. Luscious, 5 stars.\n\nFor dessert, warm cinnamon apple cake, candied walnut, mascarpone ice cream. Small serving but quite good, 4 stars.\n\nThey place the tableware directly on the wood counter, a squick of mine. Even worse, the pickled veggies came in an odd-shaped container so I couldn't really rest the used fork on it, leaving me to put the used fork back on the counter and raising my squick to a new level. Eww.\n\nThe counter seating is reasonably deep underneath and comes with a cushion; the wire back of the chair is a bit uncomfortable and doesn't supply easy support. So overall the maddening 4.5 stars at this point.\n\nBut the cool thing is you get to watch the kitchen folks do their stuff. And that's where the etiquette violation comes in. Because you're not supposed to eavesdrop.\n\nThey serve pasta. What I didn't realize is that they make their own. Because right in front of me as I ate one of the line cooks started making pasta, flattening the dough and running it through a pasta machine. After doing this to a bunch of dough a few times, he called the guy in charge over and said something like \"I think I can save this, but\" and stopped. The \"but\" hung heavy in the air.\n\nA few minutes later the pasta was gone and the guy in charge was carrying off the pasta machine and there was no more working on pasta.\n\nSo, I learned three things about this place that push it into the 5-star realm:\n\n1) Piccino's kitchen has nothing to hide.\n\n2) The kitchen staff cares about the quality of the food.\n\n3) The guy in charge cares that the kitchen staff cares about the quality of the food.\n\nI hope they forgive me for this etiquette violation.", "author": "Charles B."}

They are always piping delicious smells out onto the street and tempting me with their wares. \n\nThere are some reviews here saying the crust is like a cracker. Let me start off by saying if you don't like gorgeous, crunchy crust pizza and for some reason I can't fathom, prefer soft, doughy blobs with tons of stuff all over it, this place is not for you. Piccino is about beautifully crafted food with simple ingredients and the pizza is more East Coast Italian style. Thank goodness. \n\nThe red sauce is well-crafted and slightly sweet most days and the menu changes up often. We are here at least 6 times a month (!) and are never bored. I've never gotten the special entree (the funghi, it calls to me) as the pizzas always seem better bang for the buck. The appetizers are fun to share.\n\nLast tips: \n\nThere are often little kiddies running around on the weekends. If you're a child hater (I don't really mind kids, most of them seem pretty well behaved), come on the weekdays. \n\nWhen things get busy, the tiny kitchen and seating can sometimes get overloaded. Trust me, I'm pretty impatient (raised in the tri-state), but the service is good and they will usually give you something for free for the wait if it's long and you are not an arse. Even then, I feel like they would give you something, they are so nice. \n\nAND it looks like they are opening a bigger location just on the other side of the block...so don't think they aren't concerned about it :)", "author": "Ash H."}

Part of that is simply due to its location in Dogpatch, which feels serene and earthy even at weekend prime time.\n\nI've been to Piccino four times now.  Twice for lunch, once for dinner, and once for take-out pizza.  Well, I ORDERED take-out, but also ordered a glass of wine while waiting for the pizza.  Then the pie came out while I was only half-way through the wine, so I had to open the box, sniff, snatch a bite, and, long story short, two glasses of wine and an empty pizza box later I'd had another dine-in experience at Piccino.\n\nI'm not going to recommend anything in particular from the menu this time, because I've tried something different on every visit, and been positively impressed each time.  Any pizza + contorno makes a fine small-ish meal for two.  Daily specials are divine.  The wine list is impressive in that the selections complement the menu beautifully and are in the low-to-medium price range (the pricing thing probably being a necessity for restauranteurs in the current economy, but Piccino took this approach from their opening, before our esteemed representatives in D.C. fell asleep at the wheel, drove the economy into a ditch and convinced everyone it was Wall Street's fault).\n\nService is friendly and professional, and the decor is tasteful, functional, and comfortable.\n\nGet to Piccino before Indian Summer fades -- maybe between the lunch and dinner hours -- snag a table outside, and bask in your good fortune at having logged onto yelp today!", "author": "Francisco G."}

They seem to be totally incapable of taking your order, making your pizzas and serving you a dessert in that amount of time. \n\nWhy a two star? This is not a four star restaurant and I'm\"m doing my part to let others know. \n\nThis was my third trip here over the last three years. Each time the pizza has been almost unrecognizable from the others. My first time there was shortly after they opened and I can honestly say that it was the worst pizza I had ever eaten. It was like someone had spread ketchup over a cracker with some mozzarella on top. The second seemed more like the dough you'd see over at Delfina. Much better, but still really sweet and \"ketchupy\". \n\nThis last trip was a week ago and I went it with my friend for a weekday lunch. We had a marg, a crescenza radacchio sausage pizza, an upside down blood orange cake, and a couple of drinks. \n\nThe pizza was ok. The marg was completely overpowed by the saltine-like \"thin\" (quotations are used because for a supposed thin pizza crust it is fairly thick) crust and sweet one note sauce. I would still relate it to ketchup. There were maybe 6-7 small bits of mozzerella and some dried oregano. I'm not a real cheezy pizza lover by any means but when your sauce is that sweet and your crust that thick the cheese is totally lost on your pizza in that quantity. It was boring. The special pie was a little bit better but really randomly over salty in areas. I'm not sure why as the sausage wasn't very salty. I like salt though so it wasn't a deal breaker. It was the better pizza of the two. \n\nWe wanted to try their desserts so we ordered an upside down cake. About fifteen minutes later, no exaggeration, our server came back and told us that they had run out of the cake on Sunday, this was a Tuesday, and didn't know if their baker had been in on Monday to make more. I guess they don't make their desserts fresh daily? They dug one up from somewhere. It was this tiny little cake soaked with some syrup and a slice of \"jerkyish\" blood orange on top that was so dry and tough you had to actually saw through it with a butter knife. It was terrible. They charged us 7.50 for this piece of leather. \n\nIn general the food is very expensive and I, like others, felt slightly ripped off. This was my last trip to Piccino.", "author": "Jack M."}

We went a few weeks after they moved into the new space figuring they'd need time to work out any kinks with the transition. Well, we waited a very long time for our food. The waiter screwed up the coffee press. When we ordered the french press for 2, we used to get 2 cups from one french press but they used the same amount of coffee grinds  with 1 cup so it came out super strong. And out came 2 french presses when we ordered 1. They also charged us for 2 french presses even though we told them it was not what we wanted. They tried to fix the french press issue with it coming out thicker than turkish coffee but it was pretty gross. \n\nWe felt pretty bad for the people sitting next to us. They were from LA and wanted to try this place but we were already done eating while their food did not come out. The wait staff got both of our orders totally messed up so we would get their food. We were done eating and they still had not received their food even though they ordered before us.\n\nWe told the owner about this and she knew about the transition.  The food, on the other hand, was delicious since it was the same chefs. The wait staff was horrible and clueless. They did not look happy to be there.\n\nWe waited a few months before venturing back. I like their food, but the rest of my family hated the service and vowed never to go back. Made my husband go do take-out and he went through the main restaurant to pick it up. Since we had not gone there for take-out after they moved, we were not aware you had to pick up food from the cafe (another entrance). The waiter yelled at my husband and asked him what the hell he was doing there in the restaurant. Hello? If we were first time diners, we'd NEVER come back here again (and not sure we'd go back there again). It was around 5:30 pm and they were pretty empty. Not sure why the guy would yell at a customer regarding a take-out order.\n\nI wanted to write the owners directly, but there was no email to be found on their website.

Lately, the best for me is the Fungi with TWO eggs!   \n\nThe service is always great.

It rivals that of my favorite thin crust go-to in NYC, Posto. Hooray!  (...and thank you to my foodie pal for introducing me to this spot.)\n\nThe menu is small but simple and focused. A short list of apps and pizzas is rounded out by a single daily entree special. I have only tried the White and Margherita pizzas, and both are delicious. I will certainly be returning to methodically work my way through the rest of the menu.\n\nService was excellent-- friendly and charming.\n\nWhile the space is small, it does have a few seats outside. This is one of those spots that is a small neighborhood gem, and I hope it stays that way!\n\n(P.S.  For $2, you can add 2 eggs to the top of your pizza.

I chose to have my birthday brunch there, including a large group of friends and my baby + stroller and they accommodated everyone.  We brought champagne, they were quick to chill it for us and take photos for us and were just awesome.  We did not feel rushed ever.  The food was impeccable.  The pizza with the egg on top, is a delight.  The coffee is delicious and out of all the amazing eateries in the city, this is one spot you don't have to wait an hour for, or deal with a waitress that is slammed and never brings you the extra drink.

The food (mostly pizza) at Piccino was delicious.  We started with the antipasti, which was tasty, but it's hard for an antipasti platter to really standout. With that said, the accompanying crispy flatbread was quite nice. For mains, we ordered the Margherita, Fungi, Napoletana, and Salsiccia.. Copious sharing ensued.  The crust was quite nice -- fresh, thin, kind of crispy at the edges. Among the four, the Napoletana was my fav with the Salsiccia running a close second.  While mushrooms are not my favorite food, everyone else in the group seemed quite pleased with it.  Piccino serves Blue Bottle Coffee which I really like, so that was another plus. And the service was great. Since lunch followed a morning tour of the Anchor Steam Brewery, I'd had plenty to consume and and decided to skip dessert.  But, look forward to next time...\n\nFor CalTrain commuters, highly recommended to take a small detour on the way back to your car/bus and check Piccino out.", "author": "Tom Y."}

I know it's not a Starbucks, and we're now in the slow food movement.  But seriously, it took me 15 minutes to even place an order, and there were only 3 people in front of me. Waiting for regular coffee, let alone something from the coffee bar, was no longer an option. \n\nThey are located just 2 blocks from the train station; there is no flexibility on my timing to get out the door. And, I am not the only one.  Running to the train with coffee counteracts any fuzzy feeling I've just bought for a $4 coffee. Not sure what kind of experience they are aiming for; if it's disappointment and frustration, they are successful. \n\nI gave them one last shot with their new space thinking that with new space would come new service. Very sadly disappointing. Today, I have been in line for 10 minutes and haven't even moved. At this point, I'm just curious as to how long they can actually expect people to wait.\n\nThe next test is whether or not ordering an extra hot latte will bring me anything more than luke warm. If the past tells me anything, it's that I already have my expectations too high. \n\nWell, I can't speak to the temperature because 25 minutes in line didnt even afford me the opportunity to place an order.\n\nSo much for trying to stay local.

Even the pizza options only include like 6 pizzas and the simple margerita is by far the best, funghi is too strong, but I could house like 5 of the margeritas at one time.\n\nTwo--if your cafe a door down is where you get the coffee for the restaurant customers, then you have to be prepared to catch a little flack when our coffee that we ordered at the beginning of our brunch is not ready until after we finished our meal because the cafe 'is really busy'. Of course it's busy. It is Sunday morning and your coffee is DELICIOUS.  But now you are dealing with making a restaurant guest's experience 3 star instead of 4. Am I wrong to think that you should either plan for this kind of back-up, prioritize restaurant guests or have another coffee system going for diners?\n\nThird--unfortunately, your desserts/baked goods leave something to be desired. (with the exception of the muffins which are fluffy, melt in your mouth, buckwheat? delicious) There is not that same uumpf and attention to detail that you put into the fabulous little pizzas with their fine flour crust and smooth sauce.  \n\nMy wholehearted recommendation if you go there is sit outside,don't be too hungry, get a special salad, get a margherita pizza and a glass of wine or cappuccino but you might regret paying the $$$ for the other items on the menu.", "author": "Vanessa J."}

It appears that moving to a bigger space has caused their prices to increase and their portions to shrink.  Anyway, I'm all for reducing the typical American restaurant serving size but not to appetizer portions at entree prices.\n\nIf you are really hungry, you are probably better off going somewhere else like 18th street.

If that was the case, that is SUPER LAME, and you should learn to appreciate the people who keep this city running - just because he's blue collar doesn't mean he doesn't appreciate good food. And if you didn't want to serve us for whatever reason, maybe you should have just said so rather than seating us and then acting like dicks.\n\nSo although the food was actually pretty good (thus the two stars), we will not be returning - there are plenty of places in this city with amazing food and the service to match.", "author": "Shannon M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-07-27", "description": "Everything I love about San Francisco cuisine in a small, tidy pizza shop. It's a quintessential Bay Area culinary experience. From the organic and fresh local ingredients used to make every single thing on the menu, to the ridiculously high quality of the accompaniments (blue bottle coffee, local beer and wine) Piccino is like the restaurant you wish you were at when you're stuck at the Ferry Building Farmer's Market on a crowded weekend.\n\nPiccino is a tiny, tiny pizza shop tucked away on a tiny, tiny, corner of the tiny, tiny Dogpatch neighborhood. If you've never been to the Dogpatch before, it's OK. I've lived here my whole life and only found out about its existence when it became relevant a few short years ago. It's super-charming. It's like Portrero Hill, but even charmier and with less of a view. This location does wonders for not making it a busy mob scene, for parking easily, and for enjoying the fun-ness of the city without all the drawbacks. \n\nThe pizza itself is a wonderfully yielding-but-crispy thin crust with the most organic-tasting tomato sauce on this planet. The pepperoni is locally made and completely worth it. The salads couldn't look greener if they painted them. Lastly, the ice tea is fresh and organic as well.\n\nThe service is efficient and done with a smile. Not a southern \"honey\" kind of smile, but a more modest and non-condescending \"of course this pizza rules\" smile that you can only understand and appreciate if you're a Bay Area native. \n\nWe all all live here because we search for the best things in life - the best landscape, the best weather, the best technology, the best architecture, the best wine, and, of course, the best food. Piccino reminds me why it is that I live here. And it makes me smile.", "author": "Tolga E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-01-22", "description": "My friends and I love pizza, and had heard great things about Piccino.  While it was good, it wasn't amazing, which it has to be to compete with all of the other great pizza places in SF.  On food alone, I would give Piccino four stars, but I have to agree with many of the previous reviewers on the sub-par service.  We started with the fried brussels sprouts, as well as the chicories salad.  The brussels sprouts were delicious, but I thought the portion size was a bit small for $10.  The salad was good too, like a fancy caesar.  For pizzas, the four of us shared the Salsiccia, Rosmarino, and Pancetta pizzas. The Rosmarino was our favorite, with the squash and gorgonzola making for a great match.  The housemade sausage was good, but there was nothing else special about the salsiccia pizza.  The sauce was very good on the pancetta pizza, as were the cheese and and broccoli shoots (and I don't even like broccoli), but the pancetta was not crispy enough, and I thought it was cut into a weird size.  The crust of all the pizzas were pretty good, but not chewy enough. Both desserts -- the zeppole and the persimmon creme brulee -- were delicious.\n\nHowever, we couldn't get past our waiter.  He was sort of spacy throughout the meal, more than once taking our order by memory and then halfway through changing his mind to try to write things down.  He was good enough to repeat our orders, which prevented a few mistakes.  But, even after repeating and writing down our dessert orders, he came back a few minutes later and still had the wrong order!  Also, strangely, our first two pizzas came out at the same time, but the third pizza didn't come out until about 10 minutes later.  We were nervous that our waiter forgot about it.  \n\nThe wait for our table was a little bit longer than the quoted 45 minutes, but that can sometimes be hard to predict, so I can't ding them for that.  I would probably go back to Piccino if I could get a reservation, but it's not on the top of my SF pizza list.", "author": "Pilan C."}

My coffee tasted terrible- like the machine was dirty- and after having my friend taste it and agree I decided to take it back and ask for a drip coffee. When I told the girl taking orders that my coffee tasted bad and that I'd like to swap it for a drip coffee she sniggered at me and poured me a drip coffee and asked me for $3.75.  I asked if she was really going to charge me for a replacement for bad product and she said \"I'm sorry if you don't like our coffee... We keep our machines clean..etc\". I asked if she'd heard the saying \"the customer is always right ?\" And that I'd owned a cafe for years and knew the taste of a dirty machine. At this point the barista came to her senses and told her to just give me the replacement and she did. Sniggering again.

I mean that's the namesake and all, but it's a good warning that you should be prepared to wait for a table, as there are about four inside and maybe twice that outside. I went for lunch on a weekday, so there wasn't too much of a wait, and if you can do that, you'll be in good shape. \n\nService is friendly and casual, but you're here for the food. Next time perhaps I'll try one of their paninis, but you have to at least try their pizza first time around. Nothing fancy here, the choices are few but that works out fine since the pizzas are all delicious. You should order individually, each pie is perfect for one, and then you'll be able to mix and match. The daily specials give you enough variety to make this a regular destination as well. \n\nI hear their weekend brunch (they serve Blue Bottle Coffee!) is packed, but maybe with Just For You down the street, you'll have a shot at one or the other. \n\nIf I lived in the Dogpatch, I'd definitely hang out here more often. On a sunny afternoon, on my way to work, after work with a glass of wine (a small but tasty \"under the radar\" selection of Italian), Piccino would become that perfect neighborhood cafe (that just happened to serve phenomenal pizza, capable of attracting foodies from all over).", "author": "Nish N."}

The menu changes daily, but my favorite pizza is the Bianca, which has three cheeses and a lot of garlic. It's a tomato sauce-less pizza, so I ask for it with tomato sauce added. Because each pizza is made to order, it takes about fifteen minutes or so. When it's really busy in the restaurant (it's tiny and very popular) I sometimes have to get someone's attention and point to my finished and already boxed pizza, which is fine... just know that you might have to be assertive. The staff is very friendly and nice, they're just really busy. \n\nRe: portion size-- a hungry person could eat the whole pizza (six slices), but you can share the pizza and a salad with a co-worker and it's a perfect lunch that doesn't put you into a carbohydrate coma.\n\nThe coffee is amazing, and the iced coffee is really amazing... not your average watered down iced coffee that tastes like ashtray (ahem--Starbucks)... it's Blue Bottle coffee, and organic, real milk. (Soy is an option, but it tastes way more delicious with the real milk.)\nAn extra nice touch is that the staff will give you a glass milk bottle of iced water to drink while you're waiting for your drink or for your lunch to be ready. \n\nI'm so, so happy Piccino is walking distance from my workplace.", "author": "Dani Y."}

I'd heard a lot about this place and had received personal recommendations to dine here from friends whose foodie credentials I rate highly.  Piccino's is a cute neighbourhood restaurant that has a homely feel to it.  The exposed kitchen is beautiful and the dining room tiny, yet welcoming.  \n\nOn the good side, our waiter was excellent.  Friendly, knowledgeable and creator of one of the greatest shots of espresso I've ever had.  The menu is Italian in nature and we ordered up the salumi plate and little gem salad for starters.  The bresaola was lovely, served with a rough houmous like paste and some of the finest tasting olives I've had outside of Italy.  The little gem salad was ok, but i'm not much of a salad guy.\n\nWe selected a couple of pizzas for our mains and a baked meatball dish with white polenta.  The meat balls did not hold together well but tasted excellent, a little gamey and well spiced with thyme.  They were served in a light broth that complemented the richness of the meat and the sour note from the broccoli rabe went well with the creamy polenta.  The menu described the polenta as crispy, but it was anything but.\n\nThe pizzas were paper thin with toppings to match.  We had a white pizza with three cheeses and garlic as well as my standard, pepperoni.  Both were disappointing with the white pizza largely tasteless somewhat due to the entire absence of seasoning.  The pepperoni was equally as disappointing with very little pepperoni and a similar lack of seasoning.  Some smoked salt would have gone down well on this pie.  The final nail in the pizza's coffin was the paper thin dough.  When baked it came out more like a flatbread than a pizza and whilst i'm sure this is what many people love about the pizza here, I'm afraid I like my pizza to be more neopolitan in character with a thicker, chewy crust.  I presume the dough here is unleavened which would explain things.\n\nPiccino has a lot of potential and is also a young restaurant, with time I hope it irons out some of these flaws as it has some great touches.  Not least the serving of water in old skool milk bottles.\n\nOh and the waiter pulled an amazing shot of espresso.  I know I mentioned this already but the Blue Bottle coffee at his hand rendered an amazing shot.  It was smooth, not a hint of bitterness and a taste reminiscent of melted Valrhona chocolate and almost earned this place an extra star.", "author": "Tony S."}

Fresh, local and innovative food -- check\n\nBut like many internet dates, things are sometimes better on paper...Piccino does have a small menu, letting them focus doing a few things really well.  But when you're out of 2 of 5 starters and it's only 7.30, you have a problem.  1 option as a main is totally acceptable in my book...but not when your other choices are pizzas which literally swim, yes swim, in butter and oil.\n\nService really could have made up for my lack of culinary enthusiasm, but they really fell flat on this one too.

She also loves the olive appetizer.\n\nPiccino is also a surprisingly good place to go for brunch.  During brunch, you can add two eggs to the top of the pizza for a few additional dollars.  For the Salciccia, it adds even more deliciousness to the pizza.  (My girlfriend doesn't recommend it for the Pepperone, though).\n\nThe place is pretty small and quaint, but you usually don't have to wait to long.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the city (we go at least once a month).  Highly recommended.", "author": "Chad H."}

It's cute, really it is.\n\nBut... somehow... That's not enough in a restaurant to me.\n\nThe menu was really small and the variation wasn't enough for so few options. \n\nIn a group of 6 we got 3 pizzas. I was still STARVED. The pizzas were really light, crispy, and pretty good. But if you're hungry or have a huge apetite like me expect to want to eat 2 by yourself. Chewing the pizza made my jaw really sore, is that weird?\n\nAlso, we ordered the Margherita Pizza and it was totally stingy on the basil. I ordered it because I LOVE basil! There were officially 6 leaves on the entire pizza. 6 small ones. Was there a basil shortage and they were rationing us? It was basically all tomato sauce on a crust with a handful of spots with cheese and 1 small basil leafe per large pizza slice.\n\nSo Piccino, in my book, is just A-ok.

After dealing with too much family time, I was either going to hole up with the cats, a gallon of wine, and Dancing with the Stars or I was going to have a perfectly lovely, early dinner at Piccino w/ a lady friend. I opted for the latter and my day was redeemed.\n\nPiccino has been on my list since it opened. Like many of the other thin-crust pizza eateries in SF (Pizzeria Delfina, Pizzetta 211, Gialina, and so on), it is tiny in stature, but offers a lot in the way of redeeming a bad day. I arrived first and opted for the indoor corner table as the wind was starting to pick up. Large windows open up the tiny room to the Dogpatch street scene and let in a lot of natural light. \n\nMy dining companion arrived and we decided on a half bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and two pizzas. The Margherita was required, as it is the benchmark of a true pizzeria; our other choice was the white special of arugula, english peas, green garlic, and sorrel pesto. Presented on wax paper-covered boards, the pizzas arrived at the same time. I was surprised that the thin crust was crisp enough to be picked up without any noticeable droopage in the center. The white special pie read so well on paper with all of its quintessential seasonal ingredients, that I was a little let down by it. I think it need more oomph, perhaps by upping the green garlic and/or pesto. \n\nAt this point, people started to swarm for tables as the dinner rush hit. Our poor solo waiter was a bit swamped but heard us calling for a half bottle of the rose and quickly dropped it off with fresh glasses. The Margherita was the favorite of table, but it was very simple. I have a suspicion that the funghi pie or a pizza with anchovies or a salty meat/cheese might be the way to go here.\n\nAll in all, girl talk, pizza, wine, and that neighborhood gem feel redeemed my day.  3.5 stars.", "author": "Candice L."}

They would be happy to sit us at the bar if we wanted to stay longer than 7:30. I was very surprised by this greeting to a fine dining restaurant. I did not think I was going to a fast food joint that I only had 75 minutes to enjoy my meal. This restaurant is not cheap and it is not the type of greeting I would expect to receive. This was a celebratory meal, and I bit my tongue as I did not want to say anything to upset my dining partner. We were seated and the waitress came over and gave the menus and said, I understand that we are in a time crunch here so I will be right back to take your order. She took our orders and said she would put them in right away. We ate our meal, but did not really enjoy it due to the start of the meal. We finished our meal around 7:35 as dessert took about 10 minutes from when we ordered. The 2-top table adjacent to us got up around 7:15 and was not seated by the time we left. We went to the restroom after the meal and waited for Uber to come and left around 7:45 and our table along with the adjacent was still empty. I work in customer service, and the way that this restaurant handles customer service is really poor and needs improvement.

Perfect for a warm day.\n\nOne of the other specials was not available either, and we were informed that the polpette (beef and pork meatballs) came without pasta. There is no pasta to be had; their kitchen \"is not large enough to keep pasta fresh.\" I'm sure that makes sense to someone in the restaurant business, so I won't challenge it. In any case, the waiter informed a nearby table, around 12:30 pm, that the meatballs were also OUT. \n\nI asked at one point if there was sparkling water available. There was --  then there wasn't.

It would have been okay, despite our scenic view of the wall in front of us, but we couldn't help noticing that our stools were vibrating ever so slightly. It was confounding and irritating. We identified the source of the vibrations as the bar next to us, and when the nice guy checked on us again, he figured out that it was the refrigerator under the bar. Nothing to be done, I guess. \n\nMeanwhile, we still hadn't seen our waitress. Finally she came and took our orders. Once she noticed us, the service was just fine, but it took a long time before she noticed us. She came with our wine, served in short stubby water glasses. Normally I like to drink wine out of glasses like these, but my friend was drinking Prosecco, and I think it's just wrong to drink the bubbly from anything other than a proper flute. \n\nOur appetizer arrived - a romaine salad with meyer lemons, walnuts, and ricotta. It was good, but not remarkable. I think I would have preferred something stronger than the mild ricotta on this salad - like a nice goat cheese would have been just right. \n\nThen we got our pizza, and I have to admit the crust was fantastic. Crispy, chewy, substantial enough to hold without it flopping around messily, but delicate enough to taste light and subtle. The red sauce was too one-note for me. My friend thought it was too salty. I just thought it lacked any interesting variations in flavor. It just tasted like tomato sauce. \n\nSo, all in all for dinner, decent food in a charming restaurant, but too many details that just were wrong. \n\nI've also come to Piccino a couple of times in the morning for some coffee and a pastry. It takes a long time. Do not go if you're in a hurry. However, the coffee & pastries are really good.", "author": "Melinda K."}

It was cooked perfectly, but most of the ingredients (namely the red sauce and the bread/crust) lacked dimension. I felt like I was eating straight tomato sauce on top of plain bread. We tried the pepperoni and the margherita. The meat on the former was good, though, if slightly sparse.\n\nStarters were, overall, better. I enjoyed the eggplant appetizer, even if it was a bit too vinegary. And the mixed greens, blue cheese, and walnut salad (which was comped because the kitchen initially got our eggplan order wrong) was tasty enough, although I think I would've balked at what I got for the price if I'd actually ordered it.\n\nI enjoyed a tasty wine by the glass whose name I can't quite recall -- it might've been Santa Magdalena something-or-other. Skipped dessert so can't comment on sweets.\n\nService was great! Friendly and solicitous, very concerned about making sure we were taken care of. Lively yet comfortable atmosphere, too.

Last night we went for dinner, loved the place, heard much about the coffe on yelp, had to go back for coffee and pastries this morning. Piccino is definitely a great find, a cute cafe in a great neighborhood (close to my house, yay). Sure they have some kinks to work out , but those add to the charm.\n\nFirst the dinner:\nThe sign in the dining room says \"maximum occupancy\" 14 people. We just sat outside instead, no waiting there. The menu is quite limited, but everything we had was yummy. The most expensive wine on the menu was $28, how can you beat that! We had the asparagus salad with prosciutto and egg as a starter. Asparagus was very sweet, my first of the season.\nThen i had the Piccino special pizza with peashoots and salumi. I looooved the pizza but not because it was like a pizza. It was thethinnest crust I've ever seen with no tomato sauce. It was great for whatever it was. My husband had the involtini (meatballs wrapped in prosciutto?) in tomato sauce with potatoes. The dish was delicious, but the serving size was tiny and it really begged for some pasta.\nFor dessert, we had the best biscotti ever. None of those tooth-breaking bricks, this was chewy, mmm.\n\nFor breakfast this morning we greeted our waiter from last night (the same staff works all 3 shifts), got our cappuccinos to go. It was good, but I am no coffee conoisseur. For food we grabbed some fresh out of the oven focaccia with dried fruit and nuts. Crazy, eh?\n\nIn summary, Piccino has a great future, but maybe I don't want everyone to flock there :(\n\nNotes: Dinner is served thu-sat only (i think), they close at 8:30p. \nNo credit cards accepted.\nIf there is a line, go to yield wine bar around the corner :)", "author": "Ayse B."}

I mean, I like the thin crust pizzas on the flat wooden serving board, the glass milk bottle water carafes, and the handcrafted/thrown/fired platters... all very fartsy.  But besides the pizzas and a couple of saladsand soup, there's not much there, there. I've never gone to dinner there because there are usually just two entrees and if neither one of them is appearing fetching to me, I'm not going to settle for a pizza for dinner out.\n\nDon't get me wrong... I've been about four or five times now and I enjoy the pizza but that's mainly why I go.  It's nice to enjoy a well made thin crust pizza. a glass of wine and maybe a salad, to make you feel like you're in Italy somewhere.  A cool hour or so getaway vacation on a sunny day, sitting at the sidewalk tables and people-watching the Dogpatch denizens.  \n\nI enjoy that specific type of experience quite a bit so I do return to Piccino regularly... but just for that.  There's not much else on the menu, the wine list is limited, the parkig is challenging to say the least, and the serving staff is a little too cavalier for my taste.  They're not great on the follow-up side of things and seem a little novice in terms of rounding out a satisfying dining   experience.", "author": "Ric S."}

The thin crust pizza (we got the Red Piccino special pizza) wasn't as flavorful as I expected -- too little cheese, i think.

We ordered a pizza as our main course and watched pizza after pizza come out to other tables including the one next to ours but our pizza never came.  In fact, the two sitting next to us, who ordered after us, got 2 pizzas and finished them before ours probably was put in the oven...  When we inquired, they said that there were 'a lot of pizzas cooking' but didn't know when ours would arrive.  they offerred us 'nuts' as compensation for the delay and the uncertain further delay.   After 45 min of waiting, we decided to just get the check and go, so hungry were we.   We went down the street to Mijitas by the ballpark and got a delicious taco in 5 min flat during a ballgame which was delicious.  I am ashamed to say that I'll probably never go to piccino's again.

(More restaurants should do this).\n\nThe soup of the day, a parsnip & turnip soup, caught my attention, and a salad with roasted cauliflower caught hers, so we decided to avoid the cold night and stay for dinner instead. The soup was hearty, with the broth full of flavor. Winter greens in the soup added a nice contrasting texture. The salad was alright, served with a warmed vinaigrette, though it came with a bit too much anchovy for me. We ordered the Funghi pizza, which came out on a very thin, crispy crust done perfectly. Feeling indulgent, we finished the meal with a simple lemon tart. Nothing fancy, but it was a perfect balance of sweetness and pucker in a just light enough texture.\n\nThe service was a tad slow, but very friendly.

The wine selection is very limited and in my opinion their current selection is poor.  Lastly, their dessert menu is very limited (i.e. cookie plate, bread loaf).\n\nOn my first visit I had the gnocchi which was tasty however the portions were very small that it makes me wonder if they want me to order something else.  Well guess what......I had to so I had the salad which was delicious but also very small.  I left hungry and disappointed.  At this point I wasn't about to order another item.  \n\nOn my second visit there, I decided to try their pizza.  I ordered the margherita pizza which was not bad.  The pizza had a nice thin crust with uneven distribution of salt.  There were certain parts of the crust that were saltier.  In addition the tomato sauce was bland so I sprinkled it with a lot of pepper flakes to give it some taste.  Ugh!  \n\nOne of my pet peeves at this restaurant is the earthen-ware plates that you eat on.  It appears that the dishes are remnants from a pottery shop; uneven edges, chipped and funky shapes.  Perhaps this is the look they are going for but let's face it.......it's really not enjoyable to eat on and the food easily falls off these funky plates.\n\nI give this 3 stars because it has the potential.

Each time I've visited, the barista was paying meticulous attention to craft each individual drink. The espresso blend that Blue Bottle makes specifically for Piccino is good but not my favorite (I've heard that flavor profile described as \"vegetable undertones\" which isn't my favorite tasting note for coffee). I'm convinced that it's the craftsmanship that makes each drink so smooth and flavorful.\n\nThe tender loving care is apparent in the restaurant half of the house too. We had the squash/prosciutto/basil pizza and the funghi pizza with mushroom pesto. The thin-crust pizzas tantalize the taste buds with flavor. I usually eat a lot, but with such flavorful and tastefully prepared food, I slowed down to appreciate each bite, and the portion size turned out just right. I finished the meal feeling satisfied on account of the quality without having to stuff my face with quantity. Friendly service too.\n\nPicinno also has some prepared food in the cafe, such as sandwiches and muffins, which all look amazing albeit pricey enough that I haven't indulged in too many yet. I had a vegetarian sandwich with a soft cheese (mozzarella? crescenza?), a hard cheese (gouda? pecorino?), arugula, and pesto on house focaccia. It was a great combination, the only fault was that by nature of standing in the pre-made case, osmosis was taking effect on the pesto, so the bread lost the crisp toastiness that it could have had if the sandwich were made-to-order. Still a very good sandwich. Looking forward to try the muffins or scones next time.", "author": "Boaz G."}

OK, so when we go there at 810pm, the hostess said the people at our table were finishing up dessert. We waited until 850pm to get seated. That party of three businessmen weren't going anywhere. The hostess had tried to offer us the end portion of the communal table near the door. I refused since I had made this reservation and we were not just a walk-in. After all the people who were waiting had been seated before us, we finally had to ask the hostess if we could sit at the far end of a communal table set for 5, because nobody was sitting there for at least 25-30 minutes. Why she didn't offer that to us was beyond me? It was completely different from being squeezed in at the end of a communal table with 6 other table. That far table had 2 people dining separated by a floral piece in the middle.\n\nI chose Piccino because I wanted to be certain I could experience a pleasant evening for a birthday celebration with my family. It was just COMPLETE disappointment!! One would think that a manager would come over to apologize or offer us a complimentary drink, appetizer or dessert. No, instead after 20 minutes, the wine bar staff person asked us if we would like a drink, not on the house. Our French-speaking waiter took our order which took awhile, and forgot our Beef and Pork Meatball appetizer because we were already served our 2 pizzas. We had to remind them that they forgot. For dessert (which is NOT their strong suit) they ran out of the Zeppoles. \n\nIn the restaurant industry, so much is relied on good service and excellent management skills. Piccino did not have exemplify any of those qualities that night. I have told my coworkers and friends to not bother with that place. I could never recommend a restaurant based on that terrible experience, especially when the food was mediocre at best. The hostess should of recognized our dissatisfaction and sent a manager over to speak to us and apologize. I work in healthcare and we offer our patients who have been waiting a long time, a snack, a beverage or even a Starbucks card. And in the restaurant business, how easy it would have been to appease us with an apology and a complimentary appetizer? But instead I left with a very foul feeling and the need to spread the word to others that there are so many other great places to dine in the Bay Area instead of this place.", "author": "Flo H."}

For my intents and purposes Piccino is the Gary Danko of the neighborhood.  I can get clean, healthful, flavorful pizza and a nice half-caf cap for lunch.\n\nI felt like it was a little out of place for the Dogpatch but then again it is an \"up and coming\" neighborhood - translation, white people are settling down here.  As evidence of this, we were seated next to a white woman with dreads.  \n\nI tried the watermelon heirloom tomato salad because I was intrigued by the pickled watermelon rind.  It was refreshing but a bit too vinegary- it hit the back of my throat uncomfortably after a few bites.  I did enjoy the special white pizza - pancetta, figs, fresh mint.  I admit that I'll order anything with figs in it but the combination of fatty pork, dense sweet fruit and brightening mint was fantastic.  \n\nFor dessert I ordered the fresh pear tart which was quite sweet and a little too watery for my taste.  I think they need to add a little bit of flour to the fruit or use a more baker friendly  pear like the bosc.  \n\nThe service was pretty good.  The standard Mission hipster, tattooed staff is polite albeit inefficient.\n\nI usually rate pizza places by the Margherita (seriously if you can't get tomato sauce, mozzerella and basil right.. don't open a pizza joint).

Their pizzas here were really simple but really tasty. I had the Bianca which was amazing!  Dare I say, I liked it better than Pizzeria Delfina.  \n\nDefinitely extra points for not having a 1 hour wait, for being within walking distance of my apartment but still having tons of parking if I feel too lazy to walk down, and last but not least - for having outdoor seating areas and HEAT LAMPS which makes it feel like it's an 80 degree day - never mind that you can't see any blue in the sky!", "author": "Jean A."}

I received little to no acknowledgement, which would be fine if the guy working was a least providing good service.  The barista turned around to make the most leisurely-paced, semi-full, mediocre cup of drip coffee I've ever had.  All the while, a large line is forming behind me and another worker comes in to make herself a drink, chat with the dude working and leave.  The barista said hardly a word during the entire transaction, apart from weird grunts and mouth noises he made to himself, and proceeded to overcharge me a dollar.

The quality and execution of the food was fantastic, prepared with great attention to detail and care and with good ingredients. However, the choices on offer were limited and disappointing, mostly some combination of vegetables and refined flours. It was impossible to find any substantive nutrition on the menu and that left me with the impression this place is more suited for a \"late night snack\" than an actual meal. Even the antipasti plate had no meat, just vegetables and some fried bread type things. All were delicious but, again, lacking in protein and fats and leaving me hungry and insufficiently nourished. Same for the pizzas, they tasted great, were well prepared with fantastic ingredients, but had hardly any cheese and very few options with protein, more like a snack than a meal. \n\nThe space was nice but the design was impractical. I was with a party of 3 and we were seated two people at a bench and one person at another bench at a 90 degree angle, which made it extremely difficult to talk; there was no way in this configuration that 3 or 4 people could actually carry on a proper conversation over a meal. \n\nService was great.

The employees seemed clueless.  The guy behind the counter did not appear to know how to use a cash register and took like 20 minutes to make our coffee.  As we waited we joked that the place looked like it was run by a bunch of amateurs.  \n\nBut then we got our coffee!  Wow, it was simply the best coffee we'd ever had.  Rich flavor, pungent yet smooth, and very fresh tasting.  We learned that they serve the famous Blue Bottle brand of coffee, which certainly lives up to the hype.  And while the counter guy did take a long time to make the coffee, he apparently knew what he was doing, very much so.  We became regulars after that first visit. \n\nWe later tried the food, which it turns out is quite good, especially the pizzas.  I'd go with the Bianca pizza, which is topped with three types of cheese.  But, be warned, the portions are small.  Also, they serve everything on these annoying little plates, which look like a high school art project gone wrong.  \n\nThey recently expanded, moving the coffee operation to an adjacent storefront.  This cleared some badly needed space in their dinning room, but took some of the fun out of the coffee experience.  Instead of waiting for your coffee at their old zinc bar and chatting with the people in to enjoy their morning paper, you now huddle in the small dark closet like coffee space.

AWESOME esp with a egg on top.  For dessert we split the hazelnut chocolate torte - it is served cold but melts in your mouth...reminds us of a semifreddo in terms of how it smoothly coats the palate of your mouth in sweet cool chocolate complimented by salty caramel.

We ordered:\n\n- the antipasti plate: great crispy yummy flatbread served with cauliflower, chickpea, raddish, olives, apple slices and carrot slices\n- the monterey sardines: fishy in a nice way\n- winter chard: my least favorite of the night, a little dry and chewy\n- the pork and beef meatball with polenta and tomato sauce: very nice, \"spicy\" (both hot and full of spices) and fluffy meatballs, paired great with the polenta\n- the funghi pizza: nice and earthy, very light taste\n- the \"red\" pizza: panchetta, tomato sauce and red onion with ricotta\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the lemon tart, chocolate tart and the olive oil cake.  We ranked the chocolate tart #1, lemon tart #2, olive oil cake #3.\n\nAll in all, I think we enjoyed our time because of the great company we have, but the relaxed and friendly atmosphere and service definitely helped.  I loved the thin crust pizzas even though I normally don't eat pizza.  I think I'd definitely come back for lunch on a lazy afternoon.

I've tried the Peperonata (gypsy pepper, caramelized onion, green olive and pancetta) and the Bianca (parmesan, pecorino and mozzarella, shaved garlic and chili oil), and both were fantastic. The Bianca was simple and delicious, but I really fell in love with the Peperonata. So much flavor and every ingredient was so fresh and distinct. You can tell that there's a lot of intention in every aspect of your meal, and they really get the details right. Even the simple garden lettuce salad at Piccino's is beautiful, and again, so fresh. I love the bright, open space, and open kitchen, all surrounded by so much natural light. The interior plays into the modern/industrial feel of the Dogpatch neighborhood it's located in, and is very nicely designed. Service from the guy who let us come in at the very last minute for lunch was excellent, however, our actual waitresses could have been friendlier (they might have been peeved since we probably extended their lunch shift...but still). I'd highly reccomend Piccino's if you're a thin crust pizza lover, you'll be very satisfied.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-09-01", "description": "Great dual-purpose cafe in an up-and-coming neighborhood. Coffee shop by day, light restaurant by night. The menu is creative, very good, and constantly changing. I would broadly describe it as Continental/Mediterranean in flavor, California cuisine in philosophy. Pizzas are properly Italian style. The espresso is the best I have had in the Bay Area, and is the greatest standout here. The configuration and atmosphere is friendly and familiar, but open and relaxing (the second standout feature), and the staff is both friendly and helpful. I am vegetarian and generally survive easily on either small plates or margherita pizza.\n\nTwo key failings:\n\nEspresso is only served until ca. 5pm, at which point they shut off the machine. Why? Seriously, it is phenomenal, and people want it -- why send the baristas home at 5, of all times?\n\nWine is served in short tumblers, and is 100% European. The tumblers make delightful water or juice glasses, but completely fail to focus the smells (and therefore much of the flavor) of the wines, and the European exclusivity in the wine list is just needlessly narrow. Yield, a half block away, is a much better place to properly enjoy a glass or three.", "author": "Jonathan R."}

Piccino's has moved from the blue Victorian building to the yellow building on the other corner. They have now more space and full kitchen equipment. Staff is all new and the place has a posh Design Within Reach interior and image. I was so much looking forward to the new place and today went with two friends to try it out. I took two appetizers, first one was goat cheese and artichokes, second one was carrot soup. Both were ok but portions very small. What didn't go well, was that my appetizers were brought to the table both at the same time and they insisted on giving my other appetizer to my friend. They also insisted on giving me fork and knife for my soup. My friends both had pepperoni pizza.... but 40 minutes after I have gotten my two appetizers. The pizza is different now, not as tasty and it was not possible to make the usual alterations. What really was different, was how they are organized.... disorganized.  Waiters did not seem to have assigned tables and they all attended in their own ways to every table. While there was plenty of staff, everybody was annoyed how long it took to be served and servers seemed to continue on bringing cutlery and empty plates to tables and moving them around.The same empty plate came in front of my friend and disappeared three times. Quite hilarious. Our favorite staff that were so much fun to talk to, so knowledgeable, and so caring were not there anymore. We left hungry and disappointed.", "author": "Kir S."}

I normally plan for something a little more decadent at the end of a meal when I eat out. But may I just say--wow, those are some damn good cookies! Interesting flavors, and just plain kickass dipped in Piccino's really good coffee.\n\nBut anyhow, on to the pizza, which is why I'd hopped the 22 to Piccino in the first place. I have one word for you: Meh. I mean, the toppings were good, but the crust leaves much to be desired. It's thin,  which is good, but closer to a tasteless cracker than a good crispy pizza crust (which should be crispy on the outside, but have more genuine breadiness on the inside).  \n\nWhen all is said and done, I'd give it 3.5 stars.  Hooray for toppings and coffee and cookies.  The crust was my only complaint, but that's kind of the central pizza element.  Which raises a question of yelp protocol... do you round up with an in-between rating? I'm going to have to vote no. Crappy crust doesn't deserve to be over-rated, even if the place has other redeeming qualities.\n\nThat said, any time I'm in Dogpatch, I'm making a beeline to Piccino for cookies and coffee.", "author": "David K."}

I recommend two prerequisites before dining at Piccino. One, you should not be hungry. Two, you should have lots of extra money that you don't need and are anxious to throw away.  We arrived to a completely empty restaurant before the lunch hour. Not a soul inside. We asked for a table for two and were asked if we had a reservation. We did not, so we were offered two seats at the bar. When I pointed to the empty dining room, the hostess shuffled some papers, huffed and puffed and miraculously found us a table! Imagine that. I'll skip over the other irrittating details, but the menu featured a whopping two entrees, salads, antipasti and pizza. When I asked if I was missing the pasta or chicken, the waitress told me that the chef was not offering pasta that day. Hmmmm....Italian restaurant with no pasta. That makes sense. So, my tiny $15.00 bowl of meatballs arrived. Each meatball was cocktail-sized and there were six in the bowl. That comes out to $2.50 per tiny meatball. No vegetable, no pasta (not today), not even a sprig of parsley. I assumed that the chef wasn't fetauring parsley that day either. Oh, by the way, no bread on the table prior to the meal being served.  So, I got an eyecup full of mini meatballs and......uuuuuh.....nothing else for my fifteen hard earned dollars. But, I did feel oooooh so very hip and trendy the whole time I was there. Too bad no movers and shakers saw me through the front window.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2006-12-20", "description": "I have never posted a review here, though I have lurked around and found yelp quite helpful from time to time. I am posting this review as a public service - my way of saying thanks to all the other reviewers here whose information I have found so useful.\n\nI have been waiting for this pizza/cafe joint to open since I first heard about it coming to my 'hood. I consider myself the worst kind of pizza snob (yes from new york) and while I was quite excited about piccino opening its doors, I was also terribly afraid that, well, it would suck. New restaurants don't open very often in the sleepy dogpatch, and if it wasn't any good, I would be stuck with pizza mediocrity for years. So it was with a bit of trepidation, and much anticipation, that I went to piccino today (they just opened this week), and ordered myself a margherita pizza (tomato sauce, basil, cheese). \n\nThe place is small, no more than 12 chairs inside and has the feel of a small, relaxed lunch cafe. there are a few small tables outside also, but its a bit chilly this time of year to be eating outside. The decor is nice, and the service was relaxed and extremely friendly. To be honest, I cared not at all about the decor and service - but perhaps you do.\n\nThe pizza. This is the only thing that matters (they serve other stuff like sandwiches and espresso and blah blah - it all looked quite good actually, but I care not). First, it is NOT an nyc/brooklyn greasy slice. It doesn't exist here in SF, (Arinell is close but not quite - the sauce is off) likewise you can't find a good burrito in the east village. These are just the cruel vagaries of life - get over it (even though I can''t). But back to my pizza. The pizza is a single pie (they had three or four different pies, but you always judge a pizza place based on the basics), no slices for sale here. It is thin, exceptionally thin. If you don't like thin pizza, you are a.) weird b.) unwelcome here. The crust has a satisfying crispiness (no you won't be folding these wafer thin slices), and tastes like great bread. Then there is the sauce. this is clearly the highlight of the pizza. I have tried almost every pizza in the bay area (from extreme pizza to chez panisse) and not one has had a sauce this good. It is appropriately fresh tasting, it is just sweet enough and sour enough, with a perfect amount of saltiness to stand up to the crust and the cheese. And the cheese/sauce ratio is perfect. Yes, the mere fact that I could see the sauce was a good sign, but most importantly the taste combination was spot on. \n\nThis pizza is definitely a 'gourmet  pizza', but in its most simplistic form. I find it superior to Delfina, Pizzetta 211, Arizmendi, and even the venerable Cheeseboard. My standards for pizza are very, very high, and although it is not the best pizza I have ever had (Joe's Pizza, 7 Carmine St. NYC - hands down, bar none, best slice in the world, even more so at 3am) it is, in its own category, a sublime delight. My only sadness is that it is so small - i foresee some very long waits in my future. I almost decided not to post this review, and maybe I'll get lucky and it will never find the light of day, but as I said at the top, this is my public service to yelpers, and I'm not sure when, if ever, I will feel compelled to write in again.", "author": "Sterling S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-09-17", "description": "Well, let me tell you that this is the worst place to go eat if you are actually hungry. Like the worst. For a 20 dollar cup of coffee and a snack, the place is right up the alley of alleys.\n  I have been trying to go and eat at some high class joints. My friends have been teasing me about the \"foodie\" thing for some time. I like to eat and I like to try new things. Striking out smarts, though. And this place did.\n  Have you ever seen any media teasing the idiocy of fine dining? You know, the kinds that show people paying a shitload of money for a shred of salad and a cooked pigeon foot on the center of a massive plate, all topped off by rude service from some snotty prick? Piccino comes a little close to that.\n  The first time I was in there, I got the \"we don't serve crap here go somewhere else because we don't even know what crap is, \" crap from them. I was on my way to work in the Point and needed coffee and breakfast. There is NOTHING in the way of decent breakfast in the Point, so I stopped in the Dogpatch on my way out there. I wanted a cup of coffee and a bagel. Piccino was the only thing open. Inside, I got a \"we don't serve bagels, but you can buy this crappy artisan bread for $35 and then put some of our crappy artisan butter on it for $29 extra. By the way, we are annoying posers.\" They also acted completely lost when I asked them if they knew of anything around there that sold a simple bagel. They also acted insulted when I didn't want to pay an arm for their stuff.\n  If I wanted high end breakfast, I wouldn't have asked for a bagel.         They did have Blue Bottle, which saved their asses, believe me. If you don't know what Blue Bottle is by now, go the fuck back to your mom's house and that big red can of Sanka.\n  Well, I left. Flash forward to a few days ago. I wanted to go and eat with my girlfriend. She suggested something tried and true, but I wanted a change. Expansion of the knowledge I already got. I got on this trusty site and typed in Dogpatch and italian. I got Piccino.\n  We drove out and parked. The second I walked up to the place, I felt a sinking in my empty stomach. But I wanted to try something new, and if we turned around, my girlfriend would have given me shit for the rest of the night. She likes to do that. \n  We took a seat next to the door. It is a small place(REALLYSMALL), with only five tables. The kitchen takes up most of the place, and there are tables outside. If the weather is cold out and the doors are open, then you get to shiver while you eat. (Note to restaurant owners who are to cheap to install heaters.)\n  I was hungry and  quick to forgive. The menu looked good, and they had some good shit under cork behind the counter, so we got a few drinks and ordered some food.\n  The sight of it arriving is what got me. I ordered gnocchi. I got 10 gnocchi. 10. And they weren't fist sized, either. 10 gnocchi.\nMy girlfriend got a pizza that didn't hold a finger to the Baron. It was thin crust, really thin crust.\n  Don't get me wrong. The food was delicious. Hand made and everthing, but when you need food, you need food. We paid the $50(10 gnocchi) check and drove to In and Out in Daly City. Huh.", "author": "Jeremiah M."}

Pizza is one of them. I will eat the cornmeal crust pizza, I've learned to love deep dish (thank you Little Star) and occasionally I will let you convince me that figs or artichoke hearts are acceptable toppings. Sorry Piccino, your pie doesn't do it for me - too dry, the sauce is too much like a paste and not enough cheese for this dairy freak. It wasn't a bad combination of flavors, it just isn't something I'd go for again.\nThe salad on the other hand was pretty damn good. I'm a sucker for the beet salad, and while this one was a little pricey for what you get, it was perfectly balanced. Crisp lettuce mix, little bites of tangerines, bitty yellow beets and shavings of delightful cheese to top it all off. Very nice.", "author": "Colleen B."}

The hosts are downright snobby. The wait staff is aloof. (downgraded 1 star for poor service) I so wanted this to be my go-to neighborhood spot but have been utterly put off by the disdainful welcome at the door. A solo diner, walking in mid-week before 6pm to sit at the counter shouldn't have to wait 5 minutes to be acknowledged or told to wait maybe 20+ minutes for a seat at the counter. Its great that they have been so successful but would be so nice if they did something for to acknowledge local neighbors- neighbor night or something. I'd sworn off this place but l last Sunday, a dear friend begged me to go here for dinner. After being only somewhat neglected at the door (at 5:30pm) by the host, another person at the desk seated us at the counter.

On both visits, food exceeded expectations. Veggies are farm fresh and the pizza is delicious. The wine list is extensive and contains something for every taste and budget. The dining room is comfortable and pleasant to look at. Where Piccino fails its customers is in how its staff members fail to work as a team. There's no bus staff to assist the waitstaff and the waitstaff needs constant prodding to do the right thing. After asking for a few extra minutes to decide on an order, we are abandoned by our waitress who is replaced eventually by a waiter. Said waitress returns later in the mail to present a check with a $9.50 error - a charge for a 2nd wine glass I never ordered or received. We are not offered dessert until after we request the check which is 30 minutes after we finish our entrees. I also can't recall an Italian restaurant that does not provide bread to its patrons.

But it gave us the chance to try some other dishes that were quite tasty - little gem salad (awesome dressing) and the antipasti platter.  The wine was eh and the waiter, well he was confused.  Maybe you could blame that on the heat like they did for the pizza?  He was scattered and then lingered a bit too long at our table.

But both entrees were a bit on the salty side (one was gnudi and the other was a fish of the day).   For dessert, we had the lemon verbena affogato, which was done poorly.  It seems one would have to try hard to fail on such a simple dish (ice cream, espresso and whip cream).  But there was no whip cream, just a scoop of ice cream swimming in a bowl of expresso.  Had they included whip cream (traditionally a key ingredient) that may have married the lemon verbena (a bit flowery) flavor with the espresso but without it the contrast was off, and a waste of money.

The first time we tried to visit the new place, it was packed to the rafters, but tonight we got in and sat immediately at the bar.  Yes, they are serving beer and wine again -- I had a lovely Magnolia Blue Bell Bitter. The spicy mustard greens salad was perfect. The gnocchi were large, pillowy, and delicious. The waiter somehow marked the mushroom pizza instead of the house-made sausage, but whisked it away and offered us house-made crackers or a bowl of fancy olives.  Olives eaten, the salciccia pizza arrived. It was about 14\", and served on a very thin crust. The flavor and texture were perfect and light. The crust: crisp but not cracker-like. It was worth the extra wait. Finally, we had a strawberry crostada for dessert that had the nicest strawberries I've ever had in a restaurant.\n\nAt the bar, we watched a chef prepare the salad, olives, and crostada. Everything was carefully balanced and presented. We drank three or four carafes of water and never waited for a full carafe. Aside from the mistaken pizza order, the waitstaff was attentive and generally perfect (although our main server looked like Anthony Perkins, which was a little creepy, but also fun, so, there you go).\n\nSo, a salad, three large gnocchis, a bowl of olives, a small pizza, and a crostada were enough to share between the two of us despite being quite hungry on our way in.  Actually, maybe that sounds like a lot, but it was not that expensive.  We'll go back for sure, and maybe we'll take out a couple of pizzas occasionally since we're so close.\n\nOh, consider making a reservation if you'd like to eat there during busy times.", "author": "Jesse M."}

I would give a 4 star for my pizza because on the bottom, it was slighty black and burnt. Cheese was good. Wish they put little more fresh mozz cheese on my pizza.

The place has great pizza's; fresh, simple and delicious. The first time the hubs and I tried out the place was one of those nights where we didn't have a thing in the house to eat and it was sort of a last minute decision to finally try this place out rather than just ordering delivery, so we headed to this corner spot. When we first got there they were extremely busy, the place was packed. The place is small, very small. We were ignored for a bit and when someone finally greeted us she told us it would only be a few minutes (which I found strange, because it didn't appear as anyone was going to be leaving anytime soon). It was also a cold night so sitting outside was not an option. And then another couple came in after us and got the next table? Well, apparently they called ahead of time, whatever. 20 min later we were seated. So unfortunately, things did not start off all that good, but when we did get seated our waitress apologized and she was very friendly. The hubs and I split everything and we ended up having a great salad, fresh and oh so good gnocchi (I can't remember the exact details of them, but they where little pieces of heaven) a pizza, and a piece of olive oil cake. We also ordered a couple of glasses in wine. All very good! We have been back to sample some more of pizza's and they have all been great. I have also ordered the pizza's to go. I haven't tried many of the coffee drinks, one latte and it was good. Also the menu appears to change, always fun to see what they will be serving next.\n\nAs noted the place is small and I think they are still trying to figure things out.

I really don't want more people to know about it because its so small and I love not having to wait for a place to sit whenever I feel like coming.  The vibe is great.  The waitstaff are terrific.  The food is fresh and local and a lot of care is put into the quality of how its made.  The changing wine list is always perfect.  The plates are creative and locally made.  I live local so whenever I have guests visit from out of town I always take them here because this is and example of everything I love about San Francisco - delicious, original, laid back and proud of it.  If you want a quiet romantic place for two that's off the beaten path this is the place to go.", "author": "Natalie B."}

This is no small feat, and I'd like to thank Piccino from distracting us from any possibly sticky conversations with delicious pizza.

First, it's on my side of Po' Hill, making it perfect for that Sunday morning stumble to get Blue Bottle Coffee (aka nectar of the gods).

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-02", "description": "piccino is a very quaint and delicious italian restaurant/cafe. what first allured me was the blue bottle coffee counter inside, and the dogpatch location is convenient for me, but perhaps not for most.  what sold me was the amazing food- thin and light pizzas, many \"white\" or without sauce (which is how i prefer them) with toppings like roasted fennel and goat cheese or lemon and broccoli rabe. they are also beautiful to look at. I had a lamb pizza here once that was perhaps the best pizza i've ever had. and spectacular paninis made perfectly simple with ingredients like cabot cheddar. for dinner they carry other entrees like duck confit. the salads are always really great as well and they have an excellent lemon tart. piccino also supports local organic food so their menu changes frequently reflecting thriving vegetables of the season. and everything is served on these charming artful but very raw-looking ceramic dishes crafted by one of the owner's husband. i always enjoy examining every new one i get and admiring their semi-comical honesty. if you've ever torn slabs in ceramics, you'll know what i'm talking about. piccino is small but the wait is never very long (you can catch a drink at the wine bar around the corner) and the outside seating is plentiful- and who wouldn't rather eat outside? i would imagine the acquisition of their new heat lamps will better facilitate more outdoor seating throughout the less desirable temperature periods.", "author": "little gem z."}
