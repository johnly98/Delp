The three security members were outside checking ID's. That processed seemed easy enough. \n\nOnce inside you first see the open floor area, the bar to the left, and some booths over to the far right. I didn't get a chance to travel any further back because it was packed but not to the max yet.\n\nWhen to the part first to get some drinks. It seemed like this place was a bit understaffed. Lots of people were ordering drinks but only a few were being attended to you. I couldn't help but see the blatant conversation going on between two bartenders who were not helping anyone until they had decided to end their conversation and then decided to attend to the eager customers looking to order drinks, just odd and peculiar but oh well I guess.\n\nThe vibe of the crowd was mixed. I would say that the demographic was that of early to late 20s. Not too much of a rowdy crowd but eventually the Saloon did eventually fill up. \n\nThe bathroom was gross but that was to be expected. Just foul in every way imaginable.\n\nThe dancing is not really what you anticipate but then again it is a bar not a club. Everyone is dancing in their own world, more or less. If you come with a group then you should be good but be careful. There are some questionable folks that will wonder around looking suspect and suspicious, hold your wallets and phones close to you. \n\nStayed here till about midnight and then we had to go. This place just did not meet the expectations of a Friday night in San Francisco. Might have to give Vertigo Bar a try next time. Just an okay experience.\n\nOh, some of the mixed drinks are a bit watered down. That is probably a result of the amount of ice that is used in making their drinks. \n\nBest of luck to you all off you that choose to \"LIVE IT UP\" here on a Friday or Saturday night.\n\n#BottomsDown", "author": "Robert F."}

How do you review these places with the same scale as a nicer establishment?\n\nAs many Polk nights end up, a group of friends and I were at McTeague's around midnight on a Saturday (or Sunday I guess). There was a long line, but it moved pretty quickly. I think it took about 15-20 min before we got in. Main thing that my friends wanted to come here for -- no cover and a good time. I've never been, so didn't really know what to expect. Kind of got the typical dive bar scene but with so many angry people ?? So many drunk people spilling beer and yelling at each other, this place was just a bit way too aggressive for me scene wise.\n\nThe music was primarily rap and hip hop. The inside is actually fairly large, though it obviously gets crowded. It's a pretty good place to jam, that is if you get over the typical lurking crowd of men looking to prey on women. So I guess my 3 star review is more attributed to a less than desirable crowd in my personal opinion. If I want to have a divey night out, there are other places I would rather go to. \n\nService wise though, the bouncers here are super nice. Not nice like will let you in with your fake, but just super nice, friendly and awesome people. The SO and I chatted with one of the bouncers, he was an interesting dude who carried on a great conversation and even said goodbye to us on our way out. That's a real nice touch of service you just don't get at most places. \n\ntldr; overall, I thought it was an okay bar, but don't feel a strong affinity to come back.

I really love this place, but it unfortunately has a problem with attracting thieves. In 2015, two of my close friends had their iPhones stolen out of their back pockets. As I completely felt for them, I did not want to discredit the bar because I loved it and bad crowds can be found anywhere; especially in a city.\n\nI came back to the bar this last Saturday, the 9th and was there for about 30 minutes. I had one drink within this time span and went back to the bar to get another. I ordered my drink and opened my purse to pay and my iPhone, debit/credit cards, and license were gone. I am not one to lose things, nor have I ever had anything stolen from me.  A reminder that my purse was ZIPPED, so the people that are doing this obviously know exactly what they are doing.\n\nFurthermore, once I figured out my cards were missing, my boyfriend asked the bar tenders if there were any tabs open under my name because my things had been stolen. They said that there were not, and with this being said they should have been on alert looking for my name. I was not able to cancel my cards until I got home, and the next day there were three large charges on my account from McTeague's. Fortunately, I can have the charges reversed and purchase a new iPhone, but the fact that the bar tenders were alerted and still did not catch this is a bit concerning.\n\nOver all, I am sad to have to leave this review, but within the last year multiple items have been stolen from my friends and I here. Security told me that this kind of thing happens all of the time here. If this is the case, WHY isn't there security inside keeping an eye out? It is one thing to set your things down and have them stolen, but it is another to have them stolen from you while you diligently have them in your possession. \n\nMy point in writing this is so that this does not happen to anyone else.

Once for a night out with the girls and just recently for the USA's first World Cup game. This place is great. They had the American Outlaws there and hosted a bunch of people who emptied out a few of the beverages on tap.\n\nThe bartenders: Very witty. If you can't take sarcasm or aren't able to throw it right back...brace yourself if you decide to say something dumb. They keep the ball rolling and do a great job of getting beverages out quickly. & when they're out of something know what you want as a back up. They do a really good job of making sure you get something to drink!\n\nThe beverages: At night they made me a bullet Manhattan on the rocks & they made it mighty fine. At 9:00 in the morning I was served a delicious tequila sunrise. I will say it didn't feel right ordering a tequila sunrise there but I also didn't want to order an OJ. Pick your poison. Oh the noon time whiskey sour is delicious too! That's not a new drink. It's just a whiskey sour at 12:00. Still delicious.\n\nThe bar: Got prime seats at the end of the bar close to the door for the USA game. Also got prime seats at a booth in the evening. They've got great seating no matter what you're looking for. It's not overly decorated which is great because no one wants to be assaulted visually by cheap themed decor. I will say look up at the ceiling. They've got a few pieces of art work that's pretty cool & there may be a chance for you to get educated on premier league teams.\n\nThe grub: Bring your own. There is a bunch of places you can take out from and they encourage it too. But don't be a Dirty D and leave your junk all over the place. If you ask nicely the staff will dispose of it for you if you can't find a trash can yourself. \n\nNote: It's a Saloon. Don't expect table service or to get a novelty \"scorpion bowl\" with a plethora of fruit. You'll upset the regulars and the bartenders. And no one will feel bad if they kick you out. Great place to grab a beer or some whiskey and watch the game.", "author": "Tam T."}

The bartenders will remember you, treat you well, and they will be your best friends. Like best friends do, they are willing to back you up when the time comes.\n\nBy nature I'm a very relaxed guy. I like to watch football here for 6 hours and chat it up all Sunday long. A few weeks back though, I came as close to knocking out some teeth as I have in a very long time. A drunk, mouthy individual would not shut up. He just wouldn't, and he was directing his booze soaked ire to the left side of my face. For about 30 minutes.\n\nThe observant bartenders warned him. They told him he was pissing people off and needed to have a nice glass of shut the hell up. But would he listen? Nawwwwww, he was drunk. You know how that goes.\n\nThe bartenders who know me, know my demeanor, could smell something was wrong. The comments after the fact were that they'd never seen Justin like that before. I was ready to rip his head off. Perhaps me smacking his hand out of my vicinity and yelling point blank two inches from his face to shut the fuck up gave me away. I'm not positive.\n\nBefore I snapped and caught me an assault charge they 86ed him and sent his ass packing. That's good business right there, they recognized me as a regular and a fairly happy one at that. To evaluate and say hey, we know this guy and he's not like this. Something is amiss, we need to fix it. Well played, if it wasn't me that douche would have been pissing off another patron, I guarantee it.\n\nI calmed down about 10 minutes after he bounced. We had a shot and laughed it off. I tried to buy but they were having none of it. I explained the sitch to maybe 10 bar goers who approached me and said \"Dude... you were super pissed..... what did he do?\" Luckily it went no further, McTeague's had my back and vicariously that means if you're a good customer who doesn't start shit, they'll back you up too.\n\nI really appreciated that. Some bars will ignore and let the dust settle as it will. They treated me, a frequent visitor, with respect and remedied the situation before that asshole made me remedy it myself. I like McTeague's, and I like knowing that they care enough to take care of decent customers. I can honestly say I feel like they're my friends and I look forward to seeing their faces every time I roll through. \n\nMuch love Amber and Rick, much love. I'm sure Mr. asshole thanks you too, he got to keep his teeth.", "author": "Justin N."}

This place has a serious identity crisis going on. It's an Irish pub that thinks it's a night club of sorts. What sort, I don't know. 1990's rap and hip-hop music was blaring making it impossible to have a conversation, and the place was packed with wall-to-wall people, making it impossible to move. People were so intoxicated they were literally falling down, spilling their drinks, and subsequently the floor was covered in a mixture of various alcoholic liquids and broken glass. At one point I thought I was caught in the middle of a bar fight, but it turns out the wasted girl standing behind me in 5\" heels couldn't hold her liquor anymore and fell ass-first onto the floor, knocking me from behind in her descent. Not safe. At all. \n\nThey are definitely exceeding maximum capacity by a tremendous amount of people, violating fire and safety code(s) in the city. Trying to leave at 12:00A.M. was a nightmare. The crowd dynamics made it impossible to move, let alone leave the place. It was scary, and felt like I was about to be trampled. If anything were to happen, such as a fight, or misunderstanding between drunk people, the uncontrollable crowd dynamics would most definitely result in a serious crowd disaster. Over-crowded spaces like this can become dangerous places, if not well managed. Unfortunately, all of the 'security' was stationed at the entrance of the venue - not scattered throughout the bar, doing their jobs. They need to obey city code and stay within the limits of their capacity. \n\nIt was a weird, low-brow, sketchy, bridge-and-tunnel kinda place, with dynamics that could escalate into a dangerous situation, quickly. Keep your wallets, pocket books and any valuables close to you. Or better yet, just go somewhere else, anywhere else... you're bound to have a better experience.", "author": "Beckz K."}

I decided to check the bar out to see what it could offer, as our current game-watching location (Blue Light) was offering us nothing except a convenient place to watch our games.\n\nUpon walking into McTeague's, I found a very spacious spot with comfortable surroundings.  The place is Irish & Texas-themed, as one owner is Irish and the other is Texan.  I got to chat with Chris (the Texan owner) and found out he wanted the bar to be a home for us Texas Exes.  The bar had a lot going for it: Texas decor in the back room, Shiner Bock and Shiner Black on tap, and 2 smokers to cook up some BBQ.\n\nWe decided to hold our Christmas party at the bar to test it out.  Chris cooked up BBQ for our group that was pretty tasty... and yes, it was really Texas-style BBQ, not that crap California-style stuff.  Everyone who attended liked the space, the food, and the drinks.  There was a decent crowd, but there was plenty of room to walk around and mingle, unlike in Blue Light where you get packed in like sardines and struggle to get a drink.\n\nOverall, I love the spot and plan on having future Texas Exes events there.  It's also in a nice up-and-coming area on Lower Polk.  Chris is laid-back and really easy to work with.  I also hear they do free BBQ on college football game days.  Next year, they are planning on adding another couple of TVs during football season.\n\nThanks, McTeague's!", "author": "Kenny L."}

If you sit down here, when its crowded, you will shortly have people standing immediately next to you doing an awkward butt shake at face level.

You will see people actually pretty dressed up for this place.\n\nIt's always full to where you bump into everyone, and hard to get to the bar area to order a drink. There are booths on the sides and has the western feel to it. There is a separate room in the back with another bar and you have to walk though a mini hallway where guys usually stand against the wall like hawks to see all the women pass by or the occasional couple who I just want to tell them, Dear couple intensely making out in my way, get a room, tsk, tsk. If you look closely at in the back there are more hidden booths. \n\nI always have a good time here, theres only a juke box, which is good, but if you want more upbeat it's not the place to go for dancing. The prices are reasonable, last time I bought my friend a beer and I had a vodka tonic and it came out to be $10. So we proceeded with shot, shots, shots, shots and started to speak in another language, loudly, and that's when we knew we had too many. The drinks here are a million times better than at Mayes next door and there is no cover. \n\nI met the owner the other day and asked him why they do last call at 1:15am, and he says because it is too full and the cops pass by.

Ratios are usually pretty good here, like 50:50, very outgoing crowd, so if your anti-social and need a hardcore dive bar, then this isn't your place.  The crowd is a mix of ex-marina, North beachsters, and Russian Hill peeps... Major bonus since there arent any hipsters (sorry Mission peeps, but try Hemlock which is down the street).   Drinks are moderately priced.  Plus, a major bonus is that it doesnt take 10 hours to get 1 drink (ummmm like some places, I wont name, the hell with it, ex Mayes, lol).   \nOverall, cool place if your looking for a fun, mellow crowd, were you can meet new people and down some decent brew..", "author": "Mike M."}

Its a cool Irish bar with some Longhorn fans. However, It's a lot different at night on the weekends. The bar is packed on the weekends with twenty and thirty year olds that have not left their college days too far behind them. They are either working and would love nothing more than to spend their money on alcohol or they are unemployed and would love nothing more than alcohol. The lines can get a little long here, but its usually not too bad. There tables in the front, booths in the back, and some drink tables in the middle. No cover. Drink prices are average.\n\nOn another note, I came here once with my good friend, the black out queen. She has somewhat recently retired that crown, but she occasionally shows glimpses of her glory days. Today was one of those days and we could not be happier. At some point during the night she decided that paying for alcohol at a bar just doesn't really make sense. So, she got herself a beer glass, reached over the bar, and poured herself a glass from the tap. We paused...looked at her...and rejoiced in sweet, sweet victory. Somehow, she skated by on that one and I've never had a more satisfying beer. And I think at this point, my black out friend believed this was how bars worked now. So, she casually went back for more and she should not have. The bartender went off on her. We stood huddled together like little school children being scolded. Our eyes scanned the floor as if we were going to find our lost dignity down there. But, we didn't get kicked out. So, another plus because of cool bartenders!\n\nAnother bar that my black out friend did not get kicked out of.", "author": "Arthur C."}

The only selling point for me were the $2 Busch cans.  The place was too crowded with balding white guys for me.\n\nThen, reading other reviews, I found out that this place is owned by Irish-Texans.  The decor came to life for me.  I understood the randomness of the pub decor and saddles.  Also the tribute to the fallen angels of our time above the bar (R.I.P. Kurt, Hunter, Rick, Janis...) is something that no other bar has.\n\nTo seal the deal on my continued business to this establishment, I had to try the raved about happy hour.  They serve $3 pints and $11 pitchers of... not Coors... not Busch... rather Stella, Shiner Bock, Anchor Steam and everything quality you can name from noon-7pm.  And it just happened to be during the BCS National Championship where they serve FREE bbq during halftime (for all college games)!!!\n\nIf there is a must-see game on TV, I would highly recommend dropping by during happy hour and watching the game on the array of flat screens.", "author": "Joey S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-07-28", "description": "You may be asking yourself so why oh why did they need to open up another bar on Polk Street? Well there are many reasons but I can give you 2 good ones--a) Polk has the highest concentration of bars on a city street in San Francisco and it has to maintain its title and b) as a general observation (myself living in this area on and off over the last few years) I've noticed that Polkers--regardless of age, lifestyle choices, gender, income racket, you name it--seem to take a liking both alcohol and gatherings.Over opening weekend I saw many Polk regulars from all walks of life come into get a feel of the \"new family member\". Judging from everyone's reactions I can assume that it will be a welcome addition to the already active nightlife. \n \n The bar's namesake and itself is a nod to a character from Frank Norris' McTeague and to an era of San Francisco history almost forgotten (thrillist.com has more on the history of its origins both the novel and the building itself). Thoughtful decorations like the lamps, a wagon wheel on the ceiling, the high dark wood booths with thick lacquered tables and a long bar with plenty of libations quickly add to the gathering spot aura this place has already acquired. This place makes the most of its length and can definitely accommodate more than a few healthy sized clans. There is a pool table in the back (with some plush seating there as well) and apparently they plan on hosting music there at some point. For now there is a jukebox with a picture of Marilyn Monroe resting upon it. Staff members I met seemed in the custom Polk fashion of being cordial if not down right friendly.    \n\nThe selection at the bar is a healthy one. I counted at least 20+ beer taps (with minimal repeats). Popular local favorites like Anchor Steam and Prohibition Ale were amongst those present and the LARGE display of liquor set along glass shelves, against stone brick work, led me to believe that they can cover more than just the basics. Someone mentioned something about a menu but I didn't see one. Regardless of that one quibble I can say that this place has a lot to offer. Go while it still has that new bar smell to it.\n\n2 more quick things: they open at noon (earlier than most of the bars in the immediate area) and during the week Happy Hour is from 12-7. ($3 drafts,$3 wells seems to be special). Plus Friday afternoons around 4 or 5 have an extra bonus, free food. Last week's nibbles were smoked spicy chicken drumsticks and they were as big and good as you'd expect at a friend's BBQ. Yummy!", "author": "Veronica G."}

I'm not sure how (because it isn't exactly my usual style of bar) but it turned into my go-to spot. With that said, I was surprised by how much fun I had the first time I went, and the time after that, and the time after that, etc. In fact, I continually have a good time there. It may be that I hover in the back near the pool table, and feel genuine joy when someone finally picks a good song on the juke box. Or, it may be that if you are easy to please, this is the bar for you. Lots of good beer to choose from, and even if you have to wait a second, the bartenders are normally pretty nice and make up for it.\n\nI also like that the mix of people here is generally different, and most people are willing to get a little chatty over a game of pool. It makes it feel fun, without the awkward one-pool-table-competitiveness-vibe overwhelming everything. This bar is hard to peg...you can't really pin down the crowd with a generic catch-all, but that makes it pretty easy for you to blend in and have a good time with the people you came with.", "author": "Jessica B."}

I've been to McTeague's at night on the weekend, and I wasn't really feeling it. It was really packed, and it was hard to get a drink quickly.\n\nHowever, I've been there for happy hour on Friday, which had free nachos (!) and my friend and I easily found a place to sit and relax. Then it's a really laid back bar, with a good choice of beer, and a good option for hanging out and talking with your friends, especially because they have booths. I've also been there at 8:30 on a random Monday night, and even though it was almost empty, but to me, it's more enjoyable during the off-peak hours, because you really get to enjoy the atmosphere of the bar, and see then I start to understand why it's called McTeague (after the book) because of the nice wood decor and saloon vibe. \n\nOverall, I'll go back, but mostly because I live right nearby, and not on a Saturday night -- then maybe I'll head down the block to one of the other hundreds of bars nearby.", "author": "Ashley H."}

I was a bit confused about the roped off area in the back that said, \"Private Party\" yet there were only two people back there on the pool table.

I mean, this is a bar, how can you bogart the table like that.    Either way, for the area, I liked it.   I would probably go back.

Mainly because of the crowd. I partially think it was because I was in a shitty mood and came here after a long weekend, but then the other part of me thinks it's because I'm just reaching a point where I've been to a shit ton of bars like this and they're fast losing their cool factor to me.

Had gone to some crappy bar that I felt horribly out of place, walked down the street to this lovely gem just to fit right in. Welcomed by the Johnny Cash music and a handlebar mustached bartender who makes me feel at home, I walked up to order a PBR. \"Nope, PBR's too classy.. We do have LoneStar though.\" This is one of the reasons for my 5star rating. I visit Texas a few times a year, and have been looking for my beloved Lonestar since returning from my last visit. \nAll in all this place made me very happy, let me slip out of the city atmosphere, into an awesome saloon that I'll be returning to again. On top of Lonestar they have ShinerBock on tap served in rad mason jars. I also liked the paintings depicting legends who've passed (Janis Joplin, Cobain, Rick James!) as angels, and the big Texas Longhorns flag. I guess I could keep writing about everything I like.. because thats just it..I loved everything. Oh!

Because it opened up right after Mayes closed down, it appeared to be a feeble effort by the previous owners of Mayes to recoup the tons of $$ they had plowed into the failed venture.\n\nBut thankfully, it appears that McTeague's is here to stay.  It occupies a very welcome place in a string of bars on that stretch of Polk.\n\nWhat McTeague's does right: it's nice and dark and inviting.   It doesn't try to be a typical Irish sports bar.

I also think their drink prices are reasonable when compared to other bars. The only problem I had with the bar is the music. They played some of the worst music I ever heard at a bar. Maybe I picked a wrong night but for me to change my mind on the ratings, the music needs to start getting a little better.", "author": "Nir B."}

The locals, service, pool table, and sports kept us there all day. Excellent Bar with great drink selection, good vibes and attentive Service (drink was never empty). We were exploring SF from LA, and my husband and I left McTeague's with a hand full of insider hot spots. It felt like we were with old friends when really they were new ones.

Where else can you choose between private booth, saddle, belly up, pool table room or open floor with your favorite game on flat screen under a Hunter S Thompson coffin lid?  Rumor that they will open early (10 AM)  to support the needs of a March Madness Thursday March 19, 2009 pub crawl crowd, warms me heart.

Made an awful drink, which we politely asked to change for something else and she gave more attitude than I have ever seen.  Insecure girl thought she made the best drinks in town and said she is known for her drinks.  Told her it was nothing personal, just wasn't what we were expecting.  She was rude and went around to everyone talking about these rude people who didn't like her drink.  Managing bartender didn't seem to care that she was extremely rude and said it happened often and people mistook her \"way as a Puerto Rican\" for being rude.  I'm hispanic as well, so was a bit insulted.  She needs to realize she is in a SERVICE position and make customers happy rather than be a witch when someone expresses dislike for her amazing (amazingly awful) drinks.  Even the manager made an awful face when I explained how she made the drinks.  Will tell everyone I know to stay away from this place.  Awful.", "author": "J W."}
