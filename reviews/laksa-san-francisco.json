I love their pho and their garlic noodles are the best! Rival restaurants have health scores around the high 79's to low 80's, which is just plain unacceptable. \n\nThe most important thing I look for In a restaurant is their CCSF Health Department Health Score. I find that restaurants with a rating below 90 are inconsistent, one day good, the next bad. The chance of getting food poisoning also spikes once the rating drops below my red line number of 90, especially when seafood is on the menu. I make a small exception for Laksa. I love the food from the pho, to the rice plates and the garlic noodle dishes. Their imperial rolls are fantastic and the size of all the dishes is generous.

If you can't trek to the TL, Richmond, or Sunset for legit Vietnamese food (or East Man Jose followed by a T&A \"coffee\" run), it will do in a pinch. \n\nPlan A for lunch was a fail so Laksa came up on Yelp as the closest place to grab some food.  \n\nThe name is misleading as Laska doesn't serve Laksa, a Malaysian curry coconut soup. Laksa serves basic Vietnamese pho, vermicelli bowls, rice plates, and their signature garlic noodles. Unfortunately, you won't find other Vietnamese restaurant staples like bun bo hue, bun rieu, banh xeo, or che here. Everything is fairly priced for SF standards ($13.50 and under) but the portions are small. If you're hangry, you will need to order a side of spring rolls to be satiated. \n\nI remember when they first opened a year and ago, I called to inquire if they used msg and they said, they did but it looks like they no longer do (per sign). Seems fitting for the demographics. \n\nSince it's their signature item, I ordered the Garlic Noodles w/ charbroiled pork ($11): http://bit.ly/2Gq1DlC. The garlic noodles were meh - they were neither garlicky nor buttery, and had no chew to it. Stick with Perilla, PPQ, or Thanh Long for garlic noodles. \n\nThe charbroiled pork had good lemongrass flavor but was sliced thin so you don't get very much of it. Three broccoli florets rounded out the meal, though it looked like it was just placed there to cover the negative space and make the plate look more \"complete\".  \n\nService was cordial and prompt. \n\nClean, minimalist dining area. \n\nWhile I'm unlikely to return (just not my style of Vietnamese food), if I lived in the area and was in desperate need of Vietnamese food, Laksa would be an ok option. Convenience wins sometimes.", "author": "Cherylynn N."}

Not as bustling as the restaurants close to the BART stations, which helps add to the ambiance.  Food was just ok though.\n\nBeef Combo Pho: So I appreciated that the combo consisted of my top three: eye round, brisket and meatball.  I didn't even see the chewy tripe or slimy tendon on the menu.  Minor qualm was that the eye round was mixed into the broth (becoming well done) instead of presented in a rare pile on top (which enables you to eat it rare or medium rare, if you like).  But the big disappointment was the broth.  It tasted more salty than anything else.  Didn't have that umami richness and herbal bouquet that other joints have (e.g Bodega Bistro).  I mean, it was still pho, so it was an enjoyable meal overall.\n\nGarlic Noodles: Ordered a side of garlic noodles since they seemed quite popular on Yelp.  Can't say I was fan.  They just didn't seem garlicky enough.  Nothing like An The Go.", "author": "Adam B."}

I even ordered a side of rice and was still hungry after finishing my meal. The food did taste great though!\n\nAmbience: the restaurant has a simple and cheap feel to it. It was small and cozy, but not very comfortable. There was no effort put into making the place look very inviting or pleasing. The wooden, small chairs and tables weren't the most comfortable. \n\nCustomer service: we went there about an hour before closing time and the workers seemed to be rushed. They set up our table in a very careless, unattractive manner and forgot my side order - I had to remind them about it to receive it. I don't think I saw anybody smile. They all looked like they could care less about their customer and just wanted to wrap up and go home. \n\nPrice: price was pretty good and decent, as compared to most restaurants in the city that overcharge for nearly everything. \n\nI may come back here because the food really was tasty, but only if I'm too lazy to wait at another restaurant for a spot or to even look for one open, since I know there are better pho spots around town with more pros and less cons than Laksa.", "author": "Anna A."}

It was a lazy Sunday for my friends and we were just chilling in the apartment and found this place on Yelp. We were astonished by how great the garlic noodles looked in the photos. Thus, we decided to have it delivered because why not. \n\nI ordered the Five Spice Chicken with Garlic Noodles and Imperial Rolls. When I hear Five Spice Chicken, I expect flavorful and chicken with a kick of spiciness to it. Sadly, it did not taste how I imagined. It was basic. The garlic noodles were a huge disappointment too. They were not garlicky at all and were severely dried. The more bites I took, the more bland they tasted. If I don't need gum after eating garlic noodles, then you know that there wasn't enough garlic in it! When it came to the imperial rolls (which by the way are not so imperial like), I was not surprised that they were also plain. Without the dipping sauce, the rolls were whatever. \n\nI give Laksa 3 stars because it's not horrible, potions are okay, but it's not a place I would brag to anyone about in the SF area.", "author": "Monica C."}

The soup had absolutely no flavors and tasted like water. We had to make our own sauce by adding in a bunch of limes, hot sauce and hoisin sauce to make it better. Even then it was bland. It's likely that they did not make the broth with meat in it. Also, there's not a lot of options for meat such as tendon and tripe, and they have just the basics. I also tried the Imperial Roll vermicelli with chicken, which was better than pho. The chicken was nice and crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. The service is also bad. They gave us withered basil, and when we asked for more they said they ran out. Then, then shouldn't have served us leftover, withered basil in the first place.

Since I had returned from Vietnam and very excited to have a Vietnamese coffee. The old man was great! Very polite and accommodating and we talked about coffee! \n\nMy second time this week I was not impressed at all! Actually disappointed that the lady completely ignored me, I sat and watched her deliver a Vietnamese coffee to lady at a table but then when she made my coffee she told me \" your coffee is done\" it was obvious I need to get up from the table and get it.  To be honest I felt very uncomfortable as if I was a burden to be in the restaurant.   I order food which looked nothing like the menu, I kept looking for the cucumber and mint, which wasn't in the dish but should have. Food was great. I will not go back due to service.  While I ate my food she seemed irritated but I kept seeing her hugging an old lady and just sweet to other guests. I'm wondering the whole time should I even ask for a ice water or should I just go.   I also kept thinking go to a different restaurant and get a cucumber salad and add to this dish.    \n\nI should not feel uncomfortable in a restaurant that I am ordering food and spending money.   The restaurant was not busy only 3 singles the entire time and they did not all sit at the same time - the restaurant was empty.", "author": "Linette H."}

The five spice chicken has all the right flavors and was cooked perfectly, but the broth is where lives are changed and careers are made. Fell short. The five spice chicken pho came with the beef broth, so beware if you're not a red meat eater and looking for a chicken broth. Wasn't a problem for me.

This is a modern Vietnamese spot in the Mission on Guerrero right off 22nd, and if you didn't look at the sign, you'd swear you were at another Perilla, the city's more established Vietnamese mini-chain of currently three locations, all of which serve my favorite rendition of Five-Spice Chicken with Garlic Noodles. The secret to their allure is that they infuse their noodles with butter like Paula Deen on a racist-rant shoot-up, and for some reason, the poultry is plump and juicy while the skin is just slightly crisped. It's quite a feat they manage at all their locations.\n\nSure enough, Laksa offers Five-Spice Chicken and Garlic Noodles for $9, a full $2 cheaper than Perilla, so I decided to go for it. Even though the execution looked quite similar with the chicken thigh meat pounded to an inch of its former life with the skin intact and crisped. The buttery garlic noodles were there though in a bit more paltry serving, and even the broccoli florets made a cameo appearance (photo: http://bit.ly/2cMtKLV). However, it wasn't the same. The flavor wasn't quite at the same level and the edge of decadence didn't feel as evident for better or worse. OK, worse. It was decent enough though and hardly the cause for complaint.\n\nBefore I ate the chicken though, I ordered the $6.75 Fresh Spring Rolls, which I thought were a bit middling as well. I chose the grilled pork and I liked how you could see the grill marks through the translucent rice paper, but the rest of it was a bit by-the-numbers with the vermicelli noodles a bit limp and the lettuce a tad wilted (photo: http://bit.ly/2cS4aaj). The portion was certainly enough for two people, but Jamie W. wasn't with me so devoured it I did. There are a lot more garlic noodle and rice plates as well as pho of which I saw hefty bowls pass by me. I may have to come back and try their $9.25 Pho Ga sometime and see if it compares to Turtle Tower.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...solid executions of tried-and-true Vietnamese dishes but still middling in satisfaction\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...nice open space in the Mission\nSERVICE - 3.5 stars...certainly friendly and accommodating enough\nTOTAL - 3 stars...still prefer Perilla but I'm not dismissing it either", "author": "Ed U."}

I was greeted by a less than smiley woman for a first. As soon as I walked in the music was blaring and I asked her kindly if she wouldn't mind turning it down a notch. She seemed annoyed.  Not at all friendly as she dropped the menu down. After ordering she seemed annoyed when I asked her if she had any tea. I couldn't hear her when she told me what type of tea it was so I asked her to repeat what she said. Man, for some reason she just gave me the vibes! I received my pho and ate quietly. I almost thought of getting my pho to go because I felt such negative energy in there!!!  I had no idea what the hell the deal was with her. Anyway I was ready to pay up and get the heck out of there. I had to look for her in the kitchen to tell her I was ready to leave. She never asked me how the food was, like she did the other customers. She left me with the bill and walked away back to the kitchen and said nothing! I didn't bother giving not a penny tip. She was a complete dick. Never again.\n   She's still at it again. My response: Well then that was easy because if I was going to tip you, you definitely would never be one of them. I have a list of things in which showed disrespect and rudeness on your part.  I did nothing more than come in to get a bite to eat. I was never rude to you and said thank you many times. I think you may have confused the word respect because asking or requesting something from a waiter or waitress is not a bad thing nor is it unheard of. You had every opportunity to say no for whatever reason. It is you who should take responsibility for saying yes and then taking out your irritation for your own decision on me. If you didn't like your decision that is your fault. I have been in Hospitality for over 15 years and you need to grow up.", "author": "Pamela A."}

The second closest place to the 24th/Valencia area is Mau -- which is more overpriced. \n\nEven though pho is on the menu, the highlight at Laksa = the garlic noodles. If you like your noodles chewy and with substance (and lots of garlic), don't hesitate to get a plate of these. My dinner buddy said it was like \"garlic bread in noodle form.\" YUM! \n\nI got my garlic noodles with the imperial rolls and pork on the side. I highly recommend the imperial rolls as well -- they're not very big for the value, but they're crunchy and savory in all the right ways. My friend got the veggie plate, which left a lot more to be desired... It was just steamed veggies (cabbage, and a few slices of carrots/mushrooms) lacking in flavor. So I'd conclude that the meat plates beat out the veggie plates. \n\nThe staff was super friendly and offered us all hot water since it was freezing outside.

Simple and clean with lots of pretty orchids.\n\n3) A brisk take out business. (Thank gawd because we've had one too many Vietnamese delivery fails.)\n\n4) Solid and reasonably priced eats - insanely hard to find in the Mission these days! \n\nThe Chicken Curry had great flavor and went well with the garlic noodles. Though the sauce and potatoes probably would have benefitted from a bit more cooking time. The Five Spice Chicken Vermicelli Bowl was a good rendition of a staple.

You actually get real chicken for the soup and 1 piece in this soup was more than all you got in the pho ga soup.

The rare beef is great, especially if you order on the side, but I feel like there's always a lack of noodles.\n\nTheir imperial rolls are nice, albeit a bit expensive.\n\nLaksa is significantly cleaner than the typical Pho location, so that's a huge plus.

I was looking forward to flavorful pho broth. \n\nGrilled shrimp with garlic noodles- I enjoyed this hence the 2 stars, garlic noodles were good and the shrimp had flavor. \n\n5 spice chicken with imperial rolls and garlic noodles- chicken was bland and imperial rolls were burned but garlic noodles were good \n\nShrimp spring rolls- the shrimp spring rolls themselves were good (except I saw some old looking bean sprouts) but the peanut sauce they gave me was RANCID! The peanut sauce is what makes the roll good. So I could not eat these. Will see if I have some hoisin sauce and peanut butter etc to make it myself... Really disappointed that they would give me old rancid food .\n\n\nBut for Vietnamese delivery which is rare it's not bad. I'll just stick to the garlic noodles", "author": "Karen K."}

I'm a big fan of Vietnamese food, but there aren't many near the place I live. That is, until Laksa opened a few days ago.\n\nThe restaurant is nice, simple, and clean. \n\nThe price point is reasonable and similar to most of the Vietnamese restaurants in the city. \n\nThe portion is very generous. The first time I tried the garlic noodle and five spice chicken. Both were really tasty and could easily be my favorites.

There were only 3-4 people at that time eating. But no waiters. The dish cleaner had to sit us down. Then when the waiters came out, they noticed us and gave us the menu. I noticed that for a Vietnamese restaurant, none of them spoke Viet. They ARE nice but they were slow and also on their phones a majority of the time. \n\nFood: Food was sub-par. Compared to other Vietnamese restaurants, it lacked taste. The garlic noodle was bland. The beef was chewy. The pork was the best out of the food in a bad way.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-25", "description": "TL;DR The best pho place in the mission; visited 3 times now since the grand opening. The staff is really responsive and friendly and make you want to come back all the time. Which is easy, given that I love pho and live in the mission and it's the best place that's nearby.\n\nLonger / honest feedback:\n\n1. Their broth is really good. By the end of your meal when the broth is losing heat, you don't see egregious fat separation (which you find in bad pho).\n\n2. Their noodles are really good too. Springy and fresh tasting vs lesser places where it might fall apart quickly.\n\n3. Portion sizes are what you'd expect. I always ask for extra noodles / perhaps extra meat depending on how I'm feeling, and it's probably the same as an \"extra large\" at a lot of places. They don't have an explicit \"large vs normal\" sizing on the menu, so if you're a big eater be sure to ask for extras. Or you can also ask for more after you finish what's in the bowl; service here is great.\n\n4. Their 3-color drink (Ch\u00e8) is great! Minor nitpick is it'd be easier to drink with a thick boba straw (vs the normal plastic straw they provide) -- alternatively if the ice were crushed to small pieces then I could easily use my spoon to scoop the yummy things at the bottom. I love that every pho place does it a little differently: if you're curious their \"3 colors\" seem to be a white coconut milk + clear jelly + other stuff layer, red bean, and green (mung) bean.\n\n5. I really wish they had a tendon option for their pho. Tendon is one of my favorite parts and they just don't offer it. Which is fine considering they get everything else right, but maybe someday they'll have it! :D", "author": "Sam L."}

We walked in and the waitress signaled with a finger and a grunt to a table. The place was fairly empty, with only about 1-2 other customers  and after being ignored for about 20 minutes the waitress came. I tried being as kind as possible and kept our order simple. She wordlessly took our order and went to the back. When she came back (not even a few seconds later after we ordered) I asked if it would be too late to change 1 of the orders to which she rolled her eyes. She came back with our pho, again, without a word just nasty looks. The pho was average, a bit bland but fresh. After we finished, I went to go pay and still decided to leave a tip despite the bad service. She yanked the money out of my hand and tossed it under the desk without looking at me. I thanked her for the meal as I was leaving and she didn't even bother to look our way. Overall, I don't think we'll be returning.", "author": "Rubii N."}

I had pork chops garlic noodle, imperial rolls, green beans, and thai ice tea. Amazingly delicious. Garlic noodles are not too buttery or oily. The size of the garlic noodles and pork chops are huge. The price is considered cheap compared to other places. I would definitely come back and recommend this place to friends and family.  You should give this place a try if you're around the area. Yumm!!!", "author": "Lan L."}

The garlic noodles and shrimp are perfection. Pho on a cold day? Yes, please. You get a massive bowl that's filling and yummy, not to mention cheap. We love Laksa!", "author": "Rob R."}

I got the chicken curry pho and spring rolls, maybe I'll have to try something different next time!", "author": "Rohan S."}
