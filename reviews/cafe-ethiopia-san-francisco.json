Granted: this is the only Ethiopian place I've ever been to, so take that as you want. Regardless, as a sourdough fanatic I am enthralled by injera, the thin, spongey, deliciously sour bread used as utensil and plate. The items that we had on top: beeftartar (forget the name)& hamil with cottage cheese and lentil, potato, & splitpea. Added yogurt on the side, a glass of red, it was great. \n\nBeyond posters, art, and tiles of Ethiopian people, there's not a ton of 'atmosphere' and it feels like a family-owned restaurant. Nothing wrong with that-- just don't expect a fast meal.", "author": "Julia B."}

It was somewhat tricky telling the different stew-like selections apart, but luckily everything tasted great, so it wasn't a problem. Our dish was accompanied by a bowl of rolled injera, the wheat risen flat bread, which looked like a pancake, but tasted more like a wet, sour, spongey bread. Each of us drank the Ethiopian lager with our meals, which I personally didn't care for. \n\nThey are happy to serve on a separate dish for vegetarian selections, which ended up being a wise decision considering how I mentioned everything looked very similar and we weren't able to tell them apart. The menu does offer a few combination choices; however, they are fairly basic and all of the exciting options we wanted to combine would have been a significant extra charge; seems like that may have been conveniently planned. With the combo platters and extra add ons, this can add up to quite an expensive adventure.

You can down a glass and still be able to function as a designated driver (but, uh, better keep it at one glass).  Cordial and courteous, though very slow service: took way too long for our dishes to finally arrive.  Obviously understaffed.  Another reviewer referred to the interior decor and ambiance as 'drab,' but it really was not.  Tastefully arranged paintings & art pieces on the well-lit walls.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-15", "description": "I was once an Ethiopian food virgin. After eating dinner at Cafe Ethiopia this past weekend, my taste buds are no longer as innocent as they once were. Verdict? Ethiopian food is FANTASTIC. I'm planning on going back again soon to re-experience the party in my mouth. \n\nIf you're an Ethiopian food noob like me, here's how it works: They give you a plate with a giant, thin, sourdough crepe-thing called \"injera\". Then they spoon in each dish (typically of stew-consistency) into the middle of the injera. To eat the food, you tear bits of injera off the sides and use them to wrap around pieces of meat in the middle. They also give you extra injera on the side if you don't happen to have enough. No utensils -- so make sure you wash your hands before eating! \n\nI came here for a friend's birthday with about 10 people, and we ordered a LOT of food: the Tsebhi Derho (chicken drumsticks), Tibsie Sega (beef cubes sauteed in butter), Zigni (lean beef chunks), Gored Gored (beef chunks simmered in butter), and more. I was happy with every single dish we ordered, but the chicken drumsticks were my absolute favorite. The chicken was tender and flavorful, and the hard-boiled egg helped balance out the meal with some neutral taste. My only gripe about this food was the bones. Using my hands to separate the meat from the bones (for splitting between our whole party) was quite difficult. \n\nAs for the somewhat low average rating for this place, I'm sure lots of complaints were directed towards the long wait on the food. Also, the service was pretty inattentive (their water refilling frequency was terrible), but the staff was certainly among the friendliest I've had in a restaurant: think mom-and-pop style. \n\nI'm an absolute fan of this place, and would definitely recommend any newbie to make a dinner visit. Don't be afraid to get your hands dirty! \n\nTIP: If you're a fan of wine and/or sweet drinks, make sure to try out the honey wine! It pairs well with the meal and is a nice breath of fresh air between the intense flavors of the dishes.", "author": "Christine L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-05-17", "description": "I'm glad I didn't look at the rating before I went here. This is way better than the last Ehtopian restraunt I went to.\n\nService was a bit odd thought. Not bad per say but... I don't know. Friendly but sometimes offputting? Inconsistent? Suspicious of me? It's hard to pinpoint it. Once again, it wasn't as bad as the last restraunt I went to. I was a little taken a back though when the woman serving me did not greet me and only said, \"No dogs in the restraunt.\" I use a service dog (and a cane sometimes which I was using then) and told her so which she seemed kind of resentful about. I think she may be afraid of dogs as she tried to refill my glasses of water by standing as far away from my table as possble and reaching her arms in an arc as if to remain as high above my dog as possible. Thanfully she calmed down when she realized I was quiet and polite and all my dog intended to do was nap on top of my backpack while I ate.\n\nThe food was really good. Not the best I've ever had but so far the best I've had lately in San Francisco or Berkeley. The tastes were well rounded and nothing on my veggie combo was anything short of good. The Injara was not oversalted like in some places and so it was good with the food. The warm food was served warm at this place (which has been an issue at other restraunts I've been to, particularly family ones with only one or two servers). \n\nThe portions here are smaller than some Ehtopian restraunts in SF but the prices are, too.... but really, does one really need to sit down and eat three meals in one sitting because you got a veggie combo on one's own. I finished it but I was pushing myself because it was good. It's certainly enouh to fill one up for a meal, possibly a bit too much.\n\nI got offered a fork too which she seemed almost relieved I didn't take. She pretty much forgave the fact I had the service dog she had to let in at that point. I guess she has a lot of people coming in there that are even less familiar with Ethopian food than I who are demanding forks. I did have to ask her for napkins though. She forgot to check if I needed more water but after the first polite ask she was on the ball refilling it as needed.\n\nThey're honest here, too. A customer left his wallet and she got it back to him with all the contents there. He thanked her and told her he couldn't wait until the next time he ate there.\n\nThe decor here leaves something to be desired (continuity or a theme of some sort perhaps) but the place is clean. There's was some music on--- it was in Gaelic when I was there which was sort of a cultural contrast but it wasn't disruptive. The place was mostly empty despite the lunch rush.\n\nIt's probably more liike 4 or 4.5 stars but was generous and rounded up because the ratings of this place don't accurately tell you how good the food is.\n\nService could use some work. Food is solid. Decor could use some unified intent/theme and decluttering. Clean. Nice little family business.", "author": "A J."}

I've never had Ethiopian food so I can't quite say it's the best Ethiopian food I've had. My friend said that this place made her re-like Ethiopian food, so that's definitely a plus! I just thought that the value wasn't that great. \n\nFood: For four people, we ordered three dishes - Tsebhi Derho (chicken drumsticks), Lamb Tsebhi Begee (lamb), and Yatakelt Kilikil (potatoes, carrot and cabbage). There were literally two chicken drumsticks to our surprise. The flavors were delicious but there just wasn't enough meat considering they're about $15 a dish. The enjera was a little soft and sour flatbread that got some getting used to. Compared to all the dishes, I think eating the enjera got me the most full. All three dishes came in bowls and then were placed by the waiter onto the enjera family style. There was additional enjera so we wrapped the main courses in them by hand, no utensils!\n\nService: I will say, we got in probably 20 minutes before they closed, so it was nice that they still allowed us to come in to eat! It just sucked since we forgot they were closing, that when we tried to order more food, they told us that the kitchen had closed. \n\nOverall: It was a great experience and a wonderful first introduction to Ethiopian food.

Tear off some injera (spongy bread) and lay it on your food then scoop up a portion. I think you'll love it! \n\nThe staff aren't the most verbose but they're efficient and helpful.

We ordered almost every vegetarian dish as parts of 2 combo injeras- chard,potato,cabbage and carrot,yellow lentils,eggplant..\n\nour meat loving friends had zigni and the collard greens in chicken. The person who had zigni loved it, but the person who had the chicken was not impressed.\n\nThe injera itself tasted very sour as compared to the one's I have had earlier.

Also if you want extra injara bread you better cough up an extra $2.50.  Other restaurants just give it for free.  Slightly irritated by this extra $2.50/\n\nWould we return?  Most likely yes if it were lunch time and I was absolutely craving Ethiopian food.", "author": "Sahad P."}

A nice and convenient location, a beautiful setup, delightful waitresses and delicious authentic Ethiopian cuisine!\n\nI have went to many different Ethiopian restaurants in the San Francisco area, and by far, I feel really comfortable and welcomed in Cafe Ethiopia. The pictures on the walls give such a great feeling inside of connection to tradition and simple life. The food itself represents the tradition, and it is made so well I simply have a difficult time choosing what favorite dish I'd like to have, since all the food is superb! \n\nThe injara is excellent. I like having the spinach and my girlfriend loves to have Kantishara (Mushrooms with a wonderful sauce).

My family is part Ethiopian, and we have eaten at every Ethiopian restaurant in the area, as well as in Ethiopia.  The injera (bread) here is fermented longer than most places, and has a sourness that is delicious as well as most desirable in Ethiopian food. Their wats (or stews) are authentic, with layered flavors and robust spices.  The chicken and mushroom dish is one of the very best I've ever had, and their Doro Wat (national dish of Ethiopia) is spicy and perfectly constructed.  Don't miss the lamb on the bone either.  If you haven't had Ethiopian food before, give it a chance - no, you don't get bread, or a fork to eat these delicious dishes.  In Ethiopia, you eat with a torn piece of soft injera bread, made from high-protein teff flour.  You use the injera to pick up the stews from a shared central platter which is also lined with injera to soak up the fabulous sauces under the different stews.  Cafe Ethiopia is the real deal.

We eat vegetarian here and LOVE it.  \n\nIt's a busy place at peak times/weekends but I've never had to wait for a table, because they have plenty of space, with some nice private nooks in the back for big parties. Patrons seem young and hip, but there's a lot of variety.\n\nThere are lots of Ethiopian artifacts and art to look at while you wait a reasonable time for your food. The music is subtle but the place can get a bit loud when every table is full (weekends). Still, you can alway have a good conversation without shouting.\n\nThe menu is a bit confusing but we usually get two main dishes (one with protein, like tofu or lentils) and split back and forth from the same plate of injera. They also serve a nice big pint of draft beer for a great price. \n\nYou get \n--fresh food (freshly chopped zucchini, real spinach and greens, etc.), \n--lowfat food (you can stay on a diet and eat well here),\n--decent price for plenty of food, and \n--reliably good cooking (no bad surprises like I get at most $$ and $$$ places here).\n\nI never gain the slightest weight or body fat percentage eating their food, although the food looks and tastes rich. Also, Ethiopian spice is one of the few really good combos with tofu. Their tofu is creamy and just chewy enough--not too hard and not too soft, similar to Indian paneer/cheese cubes).\n\nThis is a home style restaurant, as the term \"Cafe\" Ethiopian would tell you. You don't eat off arty asymmetrical plates with micro-doses of food squirted around them, you eat a full meal off of Bakelite Chinese ware (the only affordable platter big enough to hold a round of injera, I guess). It reminds me of a home style Japanese restaurant in a Japanese mall in Cambridge, which had the best bowls of Japanese cafe food you can imagine. That place was always full of homesick Harvard students. A similar professionally down home vibe characterizes Cafe Ethiopia.\n\nThe woman who runs/owns it is a charming lady, and the serious man (co-owner? husband?) who does most of the waiting (although lately he has help from a couple of  young women) seems to have stepped out of a five star restaurant in Casablanca in 1944. Service is solid and courteous, much better than most restaurants in this price range.\n\nWe sometimes take home an order of injera (neatly rolled up) for breakfast the next day--it's great as toast. If you order takeout I would ask them to box up the injera separately (in the neat little rolls). If it's combined, it gets too steamy in the box. I don't know if they do this but they do have small boxes and I think it's possible.\n\nMy only critique--and true of all Ethiopian places I've been to--is my wish for a little finger bowl or towelette to freshen up for the process ahead of eating by hand. We always visit the bathroom to wash, but it's not the most appetizing place in any \nrestaurant. If I were the owner I would get someone in to really set up those restrooms with some bright paint, a picture or two, a trash can in the right spot for disposing of the paper towel AFTER you open the door, and a nice smelling natural hand soap.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-01-11", "description": "Ok - first - let me say that I know Ethiopian food. I have been to Ethiopia, I have eaten Ethiopian food in about 6 other countries - and I have probably eaten at about 90% of the Ethiopian restaurants in SF and the East Bay. So - I'm no newbie to this who is going to tell you about how quaint it is to eat with your fingers! Ethiopian is my favorite cuisine and I crave it weekly - seriously! \n\nThat said, Cafe Ethiopia is my favorite Ethiopian restaurant in the city! \n\nDecor - The space is clean, open, and nicely decorated. The location on Valencia can't be beat. \n\nService - I find the staff at Cafe Ethiopia to be very pleasant. Sometimes a little slow - and maybe not effusive - but they are kind people. I find that a big smile goes a long way. \n\nFood - I think a good measure of the food at an Ethiopian restaurant starts with the injera (the spongy soda bread that all your food comes on). The injera should be FRESH! I have gone to so many places in the city where the injera is dry and crumbles in your hands - that should not happen. The injera at Cafe Ethiopia is always fresh. Next - the vegetarian options are great. I love the veggie combo and my favorites are the messer wot (a wot is a stew - the messer wot is made of red lentils - a little spicy) and the gomen (the collard greens). The potatoes and yellow lentils are also perrenial favorites. The mushrooms can be spicy too - not in a bad way - but you should be warned. I also find the meat here to be very good - my favorite is the Zigni (beef in a berber sauce - berber is a typical Ethiopian spice)! My mouth waters just thinking about it! But as a warning, the Zigni can be a bit spicy - but berber is spicy - so it is meant to be that way. The lamb dishes are also very tasty. The one downside to the menu is that they don't serve shiro (a vegetarian favorite made out of chick-pea flour).\n\nBeverages - the restaurant carries a full selection of beers and wine including Tej (Ethiopian honey wine -- watch out, its SWEET - if you like Jewish kosher wines - then this is for YOU!) and various Ethiopian beers - I like the Hakim Stout. \n\nPrices - I find the prices here to be pretty comparable to other Ethiopian places in the city. Sometimes the portion can seem a bit small - but that is probably because I can always eat everything on the plate. \n\nEvery time I eat at this place, I have that wonderful post-Ethiopian \"oh my God my stomach is expanding with so much delicious food and injera feeling\" - and then contentment ensues :)", "author": "Sarah G."}

Ethiopian food can be a delectable treat for those who have been curious enough to explore it. For vegans it's a safe haven, a delicious meal with hardly any worry about eggs and dairy when you order vegetarian. But, for first time diners, I would not suggest Cafe Ethiopia.\n\nThe food was fine, but unimpressive. The eggplant was curiously bland for the amount of oil that they soaked into it. Luckily we ordered the vegetarian combo which featured the yellow lentil puree which was delicious. The other two dishes in the combo, kale and whole lentils, where somewhat bland and dissatisfying. Also: the proportions are horrible in my opinion. The vegetarian combo was a good deal, but the order of eggplant was _barley_ larger than one of the three separate dishes that came in the combo. This might not be a bad thing because it wasn't very good!\n\nThe service was a little tardy, but maintained friendly smile. The ambiance was uneventful except for the bathrooms.

Thank god such nonsense has been dispelled--and for the good of both business and customer! Customers have their standards, and they'd hardly become any establishment's if it hasn't got its own. Customer service alone, no matter how good, does not guarantee customer frequency. What would keep the customers coming back, ultimately, is the product. Why, just the other day I was at Amoeba Music, whom I have cattily impugned in a review for their absolutely terrible staff. Catty, yes, but I'm not the only one--many of their reviews have said the same thing about those curmudgeons who work there. But their Yelp reviews are good. And I came back, and will again, exactly because they have what I want to buy.\n\nCafe Ethiopia is, and even looks, modest. It boasts a very trendy location which surely work to its advantage, and would keep it accessible, that is, as opposed to being highfalutin. Indeed that is one of its few virtues. One cannot come here with too many great expectations, after all, after my second time here, they really haven't much of anything that other Ethiopian restaurants don't have, except, as said, that it is in the Mission. My friend and I had the #8: two meat and one vegetarian combo--other than my and my friend being in the Mission, to see and be seen and feel awfully cool and \"Indie,\" there wasn't anything on that plate that I couldn't have gotten at either Axum or Massawa, or any other Ethiopian restaurant for that matter.\n\nMy friend was more patient than I as she spoke in Cafe Ethiopia's behalf: \"Well, it's down-time...\" Exactly! So why exactly did we wait twenty minutes before a server attended to us? and another ten to get a water refill? Oh yeah, and when I walked in prior to my friend's arrival, not one server addressed me--I could have ran off with one of their chairs and none would have noticed, or perhaps given a damn!\n\nYeah... right... it's in the Mission... Perhaps it has also adopted the location's reputation for what I've called as its \"cool insouciance.\" A kind of \"artistic temperament,\" shall we say. I suspect Cafe Ethiopia is blind, and yes--insouciant, of its competition, otherwise their menu would be different: perhaps more varied, if not better. One saving grace could have been the service, but there really wasn't much of any.\n\nFor any business to keep afloat, it must be good at something. May it be an environmental, or humanitarian cause; great merchandise; stupendous ambiance; or the kind of service that is so \"feel-good\" that the customer will forgive it anything.\n\nYes, it's in the Mission. But Cafe Ethiopia, you're forgetting, there are people out there like me, by far (light-years!) more pretentious than anyone who lives/hangs out in the Mission: spilling out of size zero designer skinnies from downing too much PBR at the Delirium; just so over the Mission scene, thinking it overdone and pass\u00e9; and just  smugly \"been-there,-done-that.\" And we say, \"You can't coast in it forever, baby!\"", "author": "Rho-p O."}

I've always been curious about Ethiopian food since I had no idea what it'd be similar to. I've since learned Ethiopian food is much like Indian food, but instead of curries, they eat stews, called wat. Their bread, known as ingera, is like a light and sour naan with a sponge-like consistency. It is proper to break off a piece of ingera and dip it in the wat, using only one hand. The flavors I experienced were nothing like I've ever eaten.\n\nWe actually had our waitress order whatever she wanted for us. Daring choice, but I have no regrets. The total cost came out to $41 for 3 people.\n\nLamb Tsebhi Begee (Yebeg Wat) - Tender lamb with bones cooked with hot pepper and seasoning. Although not as spicy as I would've liked, the meat was tender and juicy.\n\nMeat & Vegetarian (Choose two meat and one vegetarian) - We got the Zigni (Kay Wat) (chunks of lean beef simmered in spicy sauce & seasoning), Tibsie Derho (saut\u00e9ed chicken pieces with fresh, tomatoes, onions served hot or mild), and Kustta (chopped fresh chard with potatoes and seasoned). The beef was my favorite dish of the night. It had interesting flavors and was very lean.\n\nAter (kik Wat) - Split peas flavored with berbere sauce. I really liked this one.

Their doro wat is good but you don't get the egg if you get it as part of the meat combo :(\n\nMy regular go-to is the meat combo of lamb but I pick an additional veggie dish instead of an additional meat.  I love their split lentils, aletcha, and chard.  Their kifto is tasty and their mushrooms also deserve a shout out.  I usually end up with leftover injera and food that I create a salad with the next day.

I love berbere sauce so I inevitably enjoyed the kay wat, but I've definitely had better doro tibbs elsewhere (like in DC).

I'd never had a mediocre experience...until I got to Cafe Ethiopia. I can't even describe how uninspiring their food was. And it was much more expensive than any other Ethiopian restaurant I'd tried (you have to order your meats and veggies separately, and it adds up fast). \n\nAnd then there was the crappy service. Again, never had a not-delightful server at an Ethiopian restaurant. But the woman here (I think she was the owner) seemed offended that we were eating there. Her expression never deviated from a glare, and when my friend (very politely) pointed out that she shorted him $10 on the change, her response was almost accusatory.

So needless to say, I wasn't expecting a lot when we ventured to Cafe Ethiopia.\n\nUpon entering the restaurant we were very pleasantly greeted, and seated at a nice table along the wall. For a Sunday evening, the restaurant was pretty crowded, with people constantly coming and going. At one point, some folks had to wait for about 10 minutes for a table, as there was no where to seat them. The staff seemed very cheerful, and eager to wait on us.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised with the menu selection, and the quantity of the food that was brought to us. We ordered a Chicken & Mushroom dish, as well as a combo plate that included a beef dish, another chicken dish, and vegetable dish (spinach). We also order a side dish of split peas, a glass of the Honey beer, and the Ethiopian lager beer. The food was server very quickly, and displayed very beautifully on a very large plate, for the two of us to share. Several times our waitress passed by, checking on us to make sure that everything was OK. A waiter came by 3 times to ensure that we had enough water.\n\nI've read a few of the other reviews here on Yelp, and don't understand their experiences with the staff, as our was excellent. One thing that I did find interesting was that the waiter asked if we were interested in dessert and we declined. Less than 30 seconds later, the waitress was their with our bill.

It pleases my soul each time I partake in such a tradition.\n\nI have to say that I was overall pleased with their food and service.

That seems kind of crazy, but it's nice, I guess.  The service is no frills, and when it's busy, it can be pretty slow, but it's nice to have the chance to chat with your dining mates while you wait for your food.\n\nThe meat dishes tend to be a bit greasy (must be the \"special butter\"??), but you don't realize it until you've eaten all the meat and you start to tear up the bread that has been under it and you realize it's all soaked with grease and then you see that your hands are all greasy too and THEN you see your disgusting, greasy, shredded napkin that you've managed to destroy during the course of your meal.  The process is delicious, though.\n\nThe vegetarian dishes are quite good, especially the eggplant, potato, and lentil ones, and they tend to be less greasy than the ones with meat.  But the beef, chicken, and lamb are all great, and you should go with them, grease and all, unless you're veg.\n\nThe bread is delicious in and of itself, and it's fun to eat with your hands and share a meal with your friends off of a giant plate.

I came here with a group of friends, two of whom had not ever had Ethiopian food.  We ordered the Tsebhi Derho/Doro Wat, Gored Gored, Lamb Tsebhi Begee/Yebeg Wat, Hamli/Gomen and whole lentil/Misir.  \n\nThe best dishes by far were the Gored Gored and Misir.  The beef and lentils were well spiced, the beef was tender and the lentils were just right.  Whiel the Doro Wat was good, it was nothing to write home about.  Unlike other Doro Wat I have had, the chicken did not fall off the bone (probably not good quality and not fresh) and the egg (which is usually my favorite part of this dish) must not have been cooked with the chicken as it did not have very much flavor.  The lamb is a definite stay away.  It was tough, fatty and grisly, and we barely touched it.  The gomen or collards did not have any flavor.  So overall the food ok.  I would definitely come back for the gored gored & whole lentils.\n\nMy friends really enjoyed the Hakim Stout.

The food wasn't too bad, but the other 2 were much better for similar price.  I got take out, so I can't speak much for the experience of dining there or the wait staff, but the one person I did interact with, the woman who rang up my take out, was super non-smiley and almost rude.\n\nI ordered the meat and vegetarian combo, with the kay wat (beef), lamb tshehi begee, and gomen (collard greens).  It seems yelpers really like the lamb, but I had kind of a scary experience with it.  It comes with the bones still in it, and I guess I had a bad \"chunk\" of it, because suddenly I had a mouthful of lamb and 5 pea-sized pieces of bone.  I had to chew extremely carefully to not crack my teeth and not swallow bones.  The beef was really really good though, very tender.  Both the lamb and the beef were pretty spicy, but not overwhelming.  The collard greens weren't as good as I was hoping; they kind of had a funny \"old\" taste to them.\n\nThe prices are either different than what's listed on MenuPages, or I got charged an extra 4$ for takeout.  Likely the prices are different.  MenuPages has the meat+veggie combo for 7.95$, and I was charged 11-something.  I figured that was probably the real price, since the lamb alone was 9$, so I didn't argue.  They took credit cards!\n\nI would probably come here again and try some of the other meats, or maybe just get the beef dish and not the combo.  It's extremely close to where I'm staying right now, which makes it very convenient.  Given the other reviews of the service, perhaps I'll stick to take out though.", "author": "emilie k."}

It was super flavorful and spicy and I thought the beef was cooked well. The chicken we ordered was just ok - my friend really liked it but I thought it wasn't flavorful or interesting enough. The zucchini was good but not amazing. I thought the weird pancake thing tasted better here than at the previous Ethiopian place I've been, so they get points for that.

Yes, you can ask for a  fork too.  I had the chicken with tomatoes and onion, which came all cut up and was pretty good.  I also had the spicy beef which was also all cut up and really yummy, the best one there.  The spinach was good too, but not spectacular.  Others had the other greens, which they loved.

We felt neither overly full nor starved. Memorable dishes were the chicken drumsticks (HOT!) and lamb (a little bony but good). I love the presentation on a giant enamel on metal plate with an underlay of the spongy bread. The spongy bread soaks up all the great juices, so don't leave it uneaten. It's the best part.
