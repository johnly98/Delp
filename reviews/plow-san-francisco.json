Breakfast or brunch was on my mind and I saw the positive Yelp reviews at Plow and thought I would check it out and oh my goodness I am happy that I did! \n\nI ordered \" the plow \" it came with two small lemon ricotta pancakes. I have to pause and mention that there is a tight team of 3 guys working and one is making ricotta fresh right there on the line. Talk about high-end pancakes! One guy is working on the potatoes, one is working on the meats, it is a friendly, swift and delicious team of chefs. The menu is expansive and they have such unique breakfasts, large portions and such high quality. \n\nThe plow also comes with crispy Neueske bacon, two eggs (I chose over medium) cooked absolutely perfectly, a hash of deep-fried country potatoes which were still soft and buttery inside but nice and crispy on the outside, caramelized onion and bacon tossed together, it was really a step above the norm. \n\nEveryone works as a friendly well-oiled machine, they all have their pace down and it works wonderfully for all of us. The service is lovely, they don't bother you but they check in with you which is nice, not overt or pushy which many places as packed as this can tend to be.

The downside being the wait. It's definitely easier to get in with a group of 2. Groups of 4 will be waiting a little longer. You put your name on a list and you have to be there when they call it out. No phone calls, which sucks. We walked around the area and grabbed coffee next door. The coffee shop has games so it wasn't too hard to kill time. \n\nTHE PLOW - so much food! I hope you have a big stomach or you'll be taking left overs. The pancakes are on the small side, but still packs some great flavors. The sausages are smaller too, but you honestly don't need more food. Eggs great. Potatoes were amazing.

I ordered the plow breakfast, which came with 2 eggs, 2 ricotta pancakes, potatoes, and breakfast meats--pretty much everything you'll ever want or need in the morning. For breakfast meats, I would highly recommend their homemade pork sausage; I chose the chicken apple sausage the first time, and it definitely wasn't as good. The ricotta pancakes were fluffy and the potatoes were super crispy. \n\nBe aware that this place has crazy lines, and they don't take reservations!

My friends and I came around 10:30am on a Saturday as a party of 5 and waited WAY OVER 2 hours. We were quoted 1.5 hours - 2 hours and called pretty frequently to check in on our table. \n\nThis is the part that irks me the most about my experience.. at one point maybe 1.5 hours in, they told us to come back in 15 minutes. We came back in around 10 minutes and they told us \"oh sorry, we just gave your table away\". Sorry, but WHAT???? You would think that a place this popular can figure out their reservations and their waiting system but NOPE. So if you come here, you better just wait right outside the restaurant....... They call your name once or twice and if you're not there they just skip right over you even if they tell you to come back at a certain time. Truly unlike anything else I've ever experienced before, but maybe I'm spoiled after being in Chicago and NY for a while now as they have their lines and reservation systems all figured out..\n\nService was good from one person, but rude from another. Honestly, at this point I was pretty hangry though. So maybe the service wasn't THAT bad, it just came across as horribly rude when we asked for more water and were ignored. Also the host just wasn't pleasant to my party at all. \n\nOrdered the Plow which comes with two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, plow potatoes, and your choice of house made pork sausage, Nueske's bacon, or chicken apple sausage. I got the chicken apple sauage which I really liked and the plow potatoes are SOOOO good. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also SOOOOOO good. (But was it because I was starving after waiting close to 2.5 hours for a table and the food?) \n\nI would come back, but I would never wait more than 30 minutes for the food. 3 stars because this restaurant needs to work on their service and their queue, but the food is pretty good.\n\nTL;DR: Wait outside the restaurant otherwise your table will be given away and you'll wait outside forever and be even more starving than you already were.\n\nAlso their place is tiny, so if you want to get seated as quickly as possible then come by yourself or with one other person. They have like one or two tables that can accommodate parties over 4 people.", "author": "Carol L."}

I can't wait over 1 hour for those lemon ricotta pancakes and home made pork sausages no matter how delicious they are and how harmoniously they go together.\n\nHow do you eat at Plow and not agonizingly have to wait for grub on a weekend? Start waiting in line before they open. I unexpectedly had to work a graveyard shift and would miraculously be in the city semi-awake at 7am on a Saturday so to Plow we went. They don't open until 8am on the weekends (Yelp hours were wrong) so we walked over to Farley's a half block away to get some caffeine and lined up around 7:40 am and managed to get in on the first seating.

I ordered **The Plow ** ($17.50), recommended to me by my breakfast bud as a sampling of Plow's hit items.  Eggs, choice of meat (I had chicken apple sausage), crispy potatoes, and lemon ricotta pancakes.  Sounds standard, but oh my god - they are out of this world.\n\nI identify as a huge tater lover, and I was still intrigued by this hype over their potatoes.  Best way to describe it: you know the crispy skin on peking duck?  These potatoes had that kind of delicate crisp to them!  HNGH.  Nom nom.\n\nTheir lemon ricotta pancakes are smol, light, and fluffy -- finally, a pancake that doesn't weigh you down!  The sausages were v flavorful and juicy, but not at all greasy - *praise*.  Best of all the parts were so well proportioned to each other!

One year later, I decide to challenge the wait at Plow again.\n\nMy friend came around 10:15 on a Saturday to put her name down and was told to check back in 2 hours or so.

It comes with two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, Plow potatoes, and your choice of pork sausage, bacon, or chicken apple sausage.

Almost everything was perfect about this platter: the eggs were perfectly scrambled, the potatoes were roasted just right, and OMG THE PANCAKES. They were so light with a nice lemon flavor that wasn't overpowering. The pancakes themselves aren't too sweet so you can control the sweetness with the syrup. The Plow platter comes with two mini pancakes, but I might need to order a whole side of these to myself next time!

I will try the homemade sausage patty next time since the chicken apple sausage was fairly ordinary. I will come back to this place just for the lemon ricotta pancakes and breakfast potatoes. Though the pancakes are small, they're just lovely - fragrant and fluffy with a little bit of crispy edge. The breakfast potatoes are amazing - the seasoning is spicy and earthy and they're crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside.\n\nI really enjoyed the smoked salmon eggs benedict - the eggs were perfectly poached and the hollandaise sauce was creamy but not overly heavy. I also appreciated that they toasted the english muffin so the muffin didn't dissolve to mush as we broke open the egg yolk. I was tempted to lick the plate.

So I say ok we'll sit outside. But then a big HAHA moment came, when she said they weren't seating outside for another 15 minutes to let the servers catch up with the inside rush. UGH so I say ok fine. 20 minutes go by, granted I have a 1.5 year old with me who was pretty patient, shocking I know. I go back in and ask how much longer, she says few more minutes, that's when I say, I need a definitive answer so that I can decide whether or not to leave. I got seated 3 minutes later.\n\nThe hostess part wasn't a great experience BUT our server was incredible. I didn't have to say anything, she just knew me being with a toddler that this was going to have to be a quick meal before he starts getting stir crazy and I was alone with him and she was on the ball with getting our order, serving food, and checking back with us to get the check squared away. It took 30 minutes from the moment we sat down to when we left.\n\nThe biscuit is toddler approved. My kid is still young and hasn't been exposed to a lot of sugar so the honey butter wasn't a win for him. That's ok, he'll learn how good it is later in life. \n\nThe eggs Benedict - my poached eggs were barely runny. There was a tiny bit of a run but most of the yolk had gotten cooked. I am insanely picky when it comes to how poached eggs should be cooked, and the yolk should be completely runny for me so I wasn't thrilled about this but the rest of it was delicious so it's ok. I would've done 2 or 3 star review for this fact alone but I did love our server so much that I give them 4 stars. Plus I've been here before and it was so good that I give them the benefit of the doubt. I probably won't get eggs Benedict next time. I'll stick with the pancakes.", "author": "Lisa D."}

Plow does not take reservations so two people went early to get our name and larger party in for a table. It took about twenty minutes which is wonderful for a table of six of you ask me.\n\nWe had heard that we should get their biscuits with honey butter so we ordered three biscuits to split amongst our group. They came and were warm. But yo....they were dense AF. Like, I was curious if it was a brick or a biscuit. It needed all the butter.\n\nI opted for the breakfast sandwich. It was not great. It was quite bland. My potatoes were clearly ones from the bottom as they were mostly scraps and wayyyyy overcooked.\n\nThe one thing that was delicious were the lemon ricotta pancakes.

I was told by a friend that there is usually a line out the door, and I'm not surprised. \n\nThe general atmosphere fits perfectly with the farm to table vibe, it feels relaxed and familiar. The servers were super friendly and nice. It reminded me of going to a hip friends house for breakfast. I sat at the breakfast bar and was able to see the kitchen staff preparing food, which also gave the sense of cleanliness because I could see any missteps made. \n\nThe food was delicious, it all tasted homemade and fresh. The eggs were creamy and moist. The potatoes had a crisp to them that made me keep going back for me. The pork sausage was slightly spicy, which I am not a fan of, but I was able to try my friend's chicken sausage which had a maple syrup aftertaste to them which was just delicious. I ordered the plow, which is two eggs, potatoes, meat and two of their lemon ricotta pancakes. Boy oh boy, those pancakes stole the entire show. They melted in your mouth with twangs of lemon and notes of sweet, melt-in-your-mouth savory flavors which I can only assume is the ricotta. Combined with the syrup served on the side and a small pat of butter on top, it was heavenly. \n\nI would absolutely check this place out again and suggest you do the same.", "author": "Emily R."}

Sure it's enjoyable and really beautiful to dine in with high ceilings and lots of natural light, but especially given the wait, the hype, and the price, it left me wanting a bit more. \n\nI went with the plow because it has their name on it and I couldn't decide what to go so as mine as we'll try a bit of everything. Yes the potatoes are dope, the crispness and the seasoning are lovely, but it loses its flair after a few of them. It could use a nice a nice homemade sauce: I asked and they have a garlic aioli which is a solid option. The house made sausage is super juicy and tender, but not the most exciting flavors. The pancakes are super fluffy and if lemon ricotta is your thing, then you'll love them. They were a bit overpowering for me, but thankfully the maple syrup helped balance it out a bit.

I love baked goods of all types and I've had more than my fair share of biscuits but this is definitely leagues above any other biscuit I've ever eaten in my life. It's SO flakey and buttery and delicious and pairs AMAZINGLY with the honey butter for an ultra decadent experience. The outer crust is so perfect and the inside is so soft and warm; next time I come to Plow I'm literally just ordering like 5 of these biscuits and calling it a day.\n\nI also tried the prosciutto & gruyere toast which was a solid savory option!

These pancakes live up to its hype and is worth getting. They have a strong lemon taste and are extra fluffy. \n\nWe also got the French roast and I WOULD NOT recommend this dish.

Unfortunately, I did not wake up early enough and arrived at 11am on Saturday for a brunch. The food was good, but definitely not worth the two hour wait for a party of two. When we arrived, there were about 4-5 parties waiting outside; however, when I put my name down, I was told there was about 1.5 pages of parties ahead of us. We were told to expect a 45min to 1hr wait and decided to just wait outside. The host and hostess had called several parties without any response, so we thought it will probably be quick. After about 45 minutes of waiting and noticing that people arrived after us got seated first. Later, my husband went in and found out that, many of the parties showed up after they were called and placed back on the waitlist in their original orders; therefore, they were being seated before us. I have no problem waiting for good food, but I feel their system flawed. Usually you would have to go to the back of the line if you missed your name, but not at Plow. So, if you want to eat here, drop by and put your name down and return at the time convenient to you. \n\nAfter about 1.5hr wait, we were finally seated at the bar right in front of the kitchen area. Not only is their seating system flawed, their waitresses were not efficient either. We were seated for about 10-15 minutes until someone finally came to offer water and coffee, then we were told that she would come back to take our order even though we said we were ready to place our orders. While we were waiting again, we noticed that the kitchen had a lull, since no orders were being placed, and the person putting all the food orders together was looking at his phone. Once the orders started going in, we saw that he did not wash his hands before starting to handle all the food. In addition, while waiting for our waitress, we saw that the hostess went into the kitchen area, reached in the pile of bacon and grabbed one with her bare hands. She went into the door that goes to the back of the kitchen to eat, which is good, and then came out and washed her hands. Maybe it would've been better to wash her hands before touching food that they will serve to customers. \n\nFinally, despite the long wait for service and slightly disturbed by the kitchen staff's lack of appropriate hand washing we were glad that we got our food because we were very hungry at that point (about 2 hrs since arrival). I ordered the Plow (the most popular dish), my husband ordered the pork chop and eggs. First, the potatoes are very good. It has a hard crispy outside and very soft center. It is also perfectly seasoned with salt, rosemary, grilled onions, and other herbs. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also delicious. They were light and fluffy with a hint of sweetness, it's one of the best pancakes I've had. I wish there were more than just two small ones. I ordered pork sausages and scrambled eggs. The sausages were nothing special, actually tasted a little dry. The scrambled eggs were nicely cooked to a soft scramble. For my husband's order, the pork chop is a decent size, but the marinade was overwhelmed with fish sauce. I understand that the pork chop is Vietnamese style, but all I can taste is fish sauce and nothing else. For his order, he also got scrambled eggs, and it also came with potatoes. \n\nOverall, I would give the food a four star, I would deduct a star because I don't think the food is good enough to worth that much wait, also for the slow service and poor hygiene.", "author": "Linda L."}

My friend stopped by around 9.45am to put our names down, and was given ETA of 90-120 minutes. So far, so good. (Honestly, the food in my opinion isn't worth a 2 hour wait, but np, we were going to commit).\n\nWe come back in just over 90 minutes (11.20am) to check on our seat. 25 more minutes the hostess says, back to Farleys (coffee shop) we go. We come back in about 20 minutes (11.40) to check again, and are told by a different (VERY sassy hostess) that we were called and weren't here, and so we'll get the next available table. She said it in a really dismissive way, sounding like she was really blaming us for not being here. That being said, I had to clarify and say, \n\nMe: \"well, we were told 25 minu--\"--oops before I can finish, I'm interrupted \nHostess: \"Well, we called YOUR NAME, and you WEREN'T HERE, so. We gave it away. You'll get the next table\". \nMe: \"How long will that be?\", \nHostess: \"About 25 minutes\". \nMe: \"Another 25 minutes? We were just--\" interrupted AGAIN \nHostess: \"WELL, we quoted you 2-2.5 hours, so we are STILL WITHIN OUR TIME RANGE we gave you. OKAY?!\", \nme: \"But--\",  \nHostess: \"M'AAM, We are still WITHIN The time we gave you SO.\" (glares at me, aggressive body language throughout--leaning in, glaring)\n\nI can't capture tone here but she was straight up talking DOWN to me, super rude, interrupting me before I could even complete HALF a sentence--all I wanted to say was \"is it actually going to be 25 minutes because if so I'm going to go wait in the coffee shop not stand out here in the frigid SF winds since you have no freaking space for your guests to wait indoors\".  Also, you MISQUOTED ME. I didn't even get to open my mouth to tell her they quoted us 120 mins on the upper end, i.e. 2 hours, not 2.5 hours. I understand it can be hard to get an accurate quote, but you should NEVER talk down to anyone like that and insult me by not giving me the opportunity to even finish a sentence. I didn't even raise my voice or tone or anything like that, I simply wanted to know if I should wait here or go back to the coffee shop, because lady, you told me 25 minutes, I'm back in 20 and you tell me it's my fault and you gave away my table and refuse to hear me out? This is after I waited close to 2 hours at this point, LADY. \n\nNever in my LIFE have I been treated so atrociously and been intimidated like this at an eating establishment in America. I am not kidding she talked down AT me (not TO me) and raised her voice and cut me off repeatedly so I couldn't ask any clarifying questions. Incredibly aggressive body language. What a NASTY experience. There was another lady who was kinder, but she was addressing other people. Also, the food was definitely not fantastic enough to warrant such treatment. It was delicious, but definitely not worth waiting 2 hours, and getting treated like you're a beggar, but paying $17 for a plate of two eggs, potatoes, a bit of sausage, and mini pancakes. Only to be seated out in the cold and told that their blankets are all dirty right now.\n\n---\n\nDear Plow--obviously quality of food comes first, but seriously, front of house staff are very important as well. Especially if you're having lines of people wait for brunch. Maybe consider employing one of those electronic systems that let's you notify customers via texts? Honestly never have I felt so insulted and intimidated.", "author": "Su Lin Y."}

Not only because it was a suggestion from a local San Franciscan, but my boyfriend finds fun and giddiness in the name itself. Weird. It's all about cows!!\n\nEven on a Friday morning, this place has a wait for the inside, which is warm and cozy and the Christmas spirit is definitely in the air. With an airplane to catch back home, we opted to sit outside with no wait. This wasn't so bad because I do enjoy sitting on a cup of hot tea while enjoying the crisp cold air through my nose and on my face. What better Christmas spirit?\n\nWhat we didn't know would be waiting for us was a very kind hostess who not only seated us at our table, but also had her hands filled with two warm and cozy blankets for each of us. I looked around. Every single seated customer had one around their shoulders or on their lap. What nice and thoughtful customer service to provide such amenities for the outside! Now I was really glad to sit outside. Just that small thing added to my cold and crisp winter morning.\n\nI enjoyed the warm blanket. It was perfect!!!\n\nSo let's get to food??? We didn't order much because it was just us two and we both don't want to feel overstuffed. But what to order when you can only order one? This was easy to decide! It was clear what their signature dish is that all tourists and locals like to order alike ...\n\nthe plow - two eggs sunny side up, two lemon ricotta pancakes, plow potatoes with house made pork sausage.\n\nNow everything on this plate was scrumptious. The eggs were perfectly yolky and freshly made. The patties were hand made from scratch and you can taste all the fresh flavors and hard work into molding these. The potatoes were crispy, crunchy and hot. And now the lemon ricotta pancakes: WERE THE ABSOLUTE BEST! Perfectly fluffy and soft with that great blend of lemon flavors woven within. Not too strong nor tangy, but perfectly sweeet! Now this is what they were known for!\n\nI would definitely come back here. Here for some more lemon ricotta pancakes and maybe try their almond pancakes next!", "author": "Cuc N."}

No problem, as that's actually not bad, but it was quite cold and I was just parked across the street, so I suggested that my wife sit in the car and I'll wait at the door for our table. When my name was called, I waved my wife over and the hostess made a big stink that \"everyone in the party needs to be present\" and I explained that that's my wife getting out of the car across the street as she was trying to stay warm. The hostess immediately called another party of 2 and seated them as my wife got to the front door.  I didn't think much of the hostess calling the other party as I assumed there must be more than one open table, but when I showed the hostess that my wife was here, who just walked across the street in the 30 seconds that just elapsed, the hostess said \"oh, I just gave away your table. Do you want to sit outside?\".  Wow, really?  I just waited 30 minutes for a table and my wife took all of 30 seconds to cross the street and you gave our table away after you saw her walking over?  I don't want to say the words I was thinking at that moment or describe the hand gestures that came to mind as I don't want this review to get banished into the backwaters of yelp, but that hostess is seriously uncool. When I said we didn't want to sit outside at a table that was available the entire 30 mins we were waiting out there, the hostess offered the counter, where we had our breakfast with a bit of bad taste provided by the hostess. \n\nThe good news?

Both brunch items were tasty but nothing amazing and definitely not worth a 2 hour wait. Everything was pretty standard in terms of taste in my opinion (eggs, sausage, potatoes etc.)...

It was about a 30-40 minute which was fine since it gave us some time to browse the surrounding bookstores and enjoy the surprisingly sunny SF weather.\n\nWe got seated 30 minutes later (HURRAY for an accurate hostess) and we quickly picked our dishes, eager to get our order in as we were starving. Our food took about 30-35 minutes to come out, but they felt like the longest 35 minutes of my life considering we had already waited an hour and were starving. On top of that, it didn't take long for us to drink all the water in the hopes of tiding our hunger and it wasn't refilled for a while. I eventually chose to order a $4 coffee because the food took so long and I was getting a little \"hangry\". But OK - maybe it was a little bit of our fault for not preparing ourselves for the wait.\n\nNow, this is where it gets bumpy on Plow's end. \nOur food came out; I got the chorizo scramble ($17), a change from the \"plow\" combo that I usually get. I also ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes ($16) because I was dying to have my friends try them!\nThe chorizo scramble itself tasted great, but we were starving and for the price tag of $17, the portions were skimpy. I ran out of soft tortillas quickly and was left with an large amount of beans showing that the dish wasn't proportionate either. The lemon ricotta pancakes are always a winner! However, 3 pancakes for $16 is still a reach, no matter how \"pure\" the maple syrup was. I was so hungry that I could've probably gone out to another restaurant after but did not want to order more after spending so much on such small portions.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I want to love this place and would recommend you try it out at least once for the delicious and fluffy lemon ricotta pancakes. They are easily the most unique, tasty pancakes I've ever had! But just be prepared financially and mentally for small portions and high prices.", "author": "Alexi G."}

Lemon ricotta pancake is fluffy and you can almost taste the ricotta cheese. You must try it. The plow potatoes are as fascinating. The skin of potatoes was so thin and yet crunchy. I had my eggs sunny side up and that worked great with the homemade sausage. I also tried the pumpkin pancakes. Although they weren't as heavenly as the lemon ricotta pancakes, they were as soft and fluffy. I think SF has plenty decent brunch options but Plow manages to rise above the rest. \n\nThe service is great and polite. Our waitress was great at making recommendations and checked on us a couple of times. \n\nThe wait wasn't too bad this time around. We only waited for about 30 minutes. That could be because it is the Friday after the Christmas break or because we got seated right around 2pm, which is when Plow closes. \n\nI strongly recommend trying Plow.

Considering that we came at 10 a.m. on a Sunday and waited a whopping 15 minutes (seriously, I timed it from the second we got out of our Lyft). Why? Everyone else wandered away to get coffee or check out the few shops down the street. Just stand around and wait a bit, apparently. Or perch on the wooden slabs affixed to the wall.\n\nFoodies and chefs alike have crowned Plow the best brunch in The City. (See: Dzung Duong of Honeysuckle Catering, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt of the Food Lab, critics at Thrillist, Eater SF, SF Gate, Conde Nast...) And holy hell, I used to think that title belonged to Kitchen Story. Nope.\n\nMy significant other went for the Plow breakfast, with two over easy eggs and their housemade pork sausage patties, while I ordered the breakfast sandwich with bacon and a cinnamon roll. Everything we had was phenomenal. The crispy roasted potatoes are the stuff of daydreams, and sitting at the breakfast bar watching cooks in the kitchen toss them with herbs and soft, sweet onions made them so much more satisfying to eat. Imagine a skin that shatters the moment it meets your front teeth. I would deep fry the heck out of my home fries the way that the folks at Plow do.\n\nThey've also mastered the art of cooking fluffy eggs, complete with crispy edges and runny yolks. Lemon ricotta pancakes? Tart and complemented every bite of potato that came after. The housemade pork patties exploded with juice and delectable flavor, ever so slightly caramelized on the outside by the flattop. The bacon on the sandwich was pliant, but it was clear that finishing it off on the flat-top really did it crispy justice. And wow, I hate frisee in every mixed greens salad I eat, but the bitter vegetable actually went so well with the fluffy Acme bread, meat, and eggs.\n\nThe cinnamon roll was a 9/10 on the indie pastry scale. I found it a little bit dry, but it satisfied a month-long craving for gooey cinnamon buns and it was made quite well.\n\nService is very friendly here, and despite the hustle and bustle, I was impressed by their professionalism and their ability to work with each other in the kitchen. Cue cooks working together to plate a sandwich, with one guy handling all eggs and another one popping the buns right off the flattop. Plus, our water jug never ran low. If the weekend wait is as bad as it seems, I think I'd pop in on a weekday instead. At the very least, I would come for those fantastically crispy potatoes.", "author": "Gwen W."}

We kept an eye on another party of four that was on the list before us. They were told repeatedly that their table was almost ready and to get prepared to be seated. Kind of in a warning/scolding tone. But it was a good 45 minutes after they were told they would get seated soon (1 hr and 35 minutes total) before they actually got seated. \n\nFor us, it took at least 2 hrs to get seated. We checked a couple times by either asking her or peering over her shoulder when she'd come outside with the list. The second to last time we asked, she was annoyed that we asked and brushed us off not bothering to check our name on the list. Then when we saw a group of four and a two top (who arrived after us) get seated we started to worry. We asked her for an update for the last time and she had a look of confusion and panic in her eyes. We told her the name (it was on the previous page - she had started a new page in the notepad) and we all realized she totally FORGOT about us.\n\nShe kinda freaked out, half apologized, and magically a table opened up soon. As a former hostess/restaurant worker and observing her for a couple hours, I don't think she really knows what she's doing. The \"forgetting a party\" happens on rare occasions, but I'm not sure why she couldn't push two tables for two together for a party of four. I saw multiple tables of two (who arrived much later than others) seated before parties of four on several occasions. Not sure why parties of four are treated as a second class at Plow.\n\nFood: OJ is not fresh. The side of nueske bacon $5.75 is very meh. You might as well order regular bacon. The biscuit $4.50 was good, but not anything mind blowing. The Plow breakfast platter is okay, the pancakes were a bit dry. I liked the sausage. The potatoes were okay and could have been crispier. The two egg brekke $15.75 is basic. \n\nThe white napkins are very linty and will leave a mess on your dark pants.\n\nTl;dr Disappointed the hostess forgot to seat our table of four.

My two other classmates each ordered the plow signature dish, a tasting platter, if you will, and a good first-timer dish according to the waitress. It included two eggs with your choice of house made pork sausage patties, Nueske's bacon, or chicken apple sausage, and two (mini) lemon ricotta pancakes with a side of yet again those delicious plow potatoes ($17.50). One of them also ordered fresh grapefruit juice and a warm buttermilk biscuit with honey butter (omg). \n\nSERVICE. 5 stars. The waitress even knew how to use an instax mini 9. She deserved bonus points for this. Tuesday morning around 10am is also the best time to come if you can. We were seated almost instantly upon arrival-- it took longer for my instax camera to produce an image on the Polaroid film. She was also very accommodating and gave great recommendations. We got pretty good seats by the window, but do be aware that since space is tight, the tables feel communal even though they're separate from each other. So if you're okay with sitting right next to the table next to you, then it should be fine. Get friendly.\n\nI will reiterate: excellent food, excellent service. Can't wait to be back to try the other items on the menu!", "author": "Brittany D."}

Luckily for us, we still managed to get here by 8AM, but the line was already insane. Once they opened the line went fairly quickly, but we were just one group too late to nab a table inside. We opted to outside seating which doesn't open until 8:30, but it was definitely better than waiting 45mins-1hr for a table inside. \n\nTo pass the time, they do offer free coffee that you can take in a to go container or in a mug. \n\nWe got The Plow w/ pork sausage, the 2-egg breakfast w/ bacon, and strawberry lemonades. The plow was as amazing as everyone has said. The ricotta pancakes were melt in your mouth and soooo fluffy - probs my fave part of the dish! I thought it would have a cheesier flavor, but it was a great balance between the lemon. The pork sausage was packed with flavor and savory and the potatoes were herby and crispy. I did find that the scrambled eggs were overcooked to the point where I didn't even eat them. The 2-egg breakfast had the same sentiments as well, but substitute the pancakes for toast. Both dishes were big enough portions where we felt full/satisfied after the meal without the brunch food coma that usually comes after.  I would also suggest getting the strawberry lemonades since they were the perfect mix of both ingredients without being overly acidic or sweet. \n\nPros: \n- Great ambiance inside/outside seating areas\n- Attentive servers \n- Lemon/ricotta pancakes!\n- Free coffee while you wait\n\nCons: \n- On the pricier side of brunch - Plow was $17 and the 2-egg was $16\n- 1-2hr wait after 8:30AM\n- Overcooked eggs\n\nIs it overhyped? TBH after seeing the raving reviews I did come in with really high expectations and while I wasn't disappointed I wouldn't say this is my fave/best brunch in SF. Would I wait 2 hours? Probs not. However, I do think that it's a place that you should come to try and then judge for yourself - but only after having the lemon/ricotta pancakes.", "author": "Keizzel C."}

The lemon ricotta pancakes are softer than normal pancakes because of the ricotta and they have a nice lemon-y taste throughout. And the POTATOES. They are always so on point with their potatoes.

Definitely try this place out, but come on a weekday if you can (weekend wait times are astronomical) and be prepared to shovel out some cash. Pros: delicious food, quaint atmosphere; Cons: price, over-hype\n\nFood: We ordered The Plow which came with eggs, lemon ricotta pancakes, meat, home fries, etc. We also tried the Breakfast Sandwich and the Biscuit. ALL ARE AMAZING. The lemon ricotta pancakes melt in your mouth with a subtle lemon flavor that helps cut through the fat. I gotta say I couldn't eat a ton of them though because they are ridiculously rich. The flakey biscuit comes with creamy honey butter -- a must try. The potatoes really steal the show. Definitely a top 3 home fry for me -- a strong plus for this place. Lastly, the breakfast sandwich is heavenly with a fluffy acme bun and delicious melted cheddar. I must say we were impressed. \n\nAtmosphere: This place feels very homey and, to me, almost nondescript. The tables and decor are simple and the place is very small so you feel like you're being served at someone's home. It helps that you're in the middle of a cute Portrero Hill neighborhood. \n\nValue: Now the portions here are huge (as brunch tends to be) but it is definitely pricey. Most main entrees are around $15-17 -- the higher end. I thought the quality of food was justifiable in the end. \n\nService: Kind and attentive -- food came pretty quickly. I have to say I'm sure we'd have a slightly different experience if we came on a busy weekend. \n\nIn all a star brunch place.

I came here on a recommendation of a friend. \n\nThis isn't to say that this place tastes bad, it's just nothing special compared to the other numerous brunch places in SF, none of them being particularly memorable. \n\nThis is the thing with these American-style brunch places. I find it difficult to be \"blown away\" by any of them, yet none of them are horrible or disgusting. They're all more or less \"normal\" bland breakfast food. Mediocre or average is probably the best word. Actually, they're probably worse due to the extremely long wait. I'd say it is not worth most people's time to wait 2-3 hours on a beautiful weekend to eat here. \n\nWe came here on a Monday afternoon, close to 2pm, and there was still a bit of wait of about 15 minutes (I've tried to come here once before for weekend brunch. The wait was over 2 hours so I left). I got \"The Plow,\" which was eggs, bacon, lemon pancakes, and potatoes. Nothing to write home about; how can you mess up this kind of food?! The food tastes exactly like how you'd imagine it to taste. You can probably make the same thing at home for a fraction of the price. The lemon pancakes are a little bit special, I guess you don't find them often. Eggs tasted like eggs, bacon tasted like bacon; potatoes tasted like potatoes (not that great). Bill is about $40 for 2 people. Seems expensive for what you get. \n\nOverall, I don't recommend people with better things to do to wait 2-3 hours for this place. It's simply not worth the time you'll never get back to eat stuff you can more or less make at home and taste more or less the same (like no special chefs required to make this).", "author": "Jennifer W."}

We asked about coffees since the wait was so long and the hostess brought out two and said- you want 4 cups right? we said yes. She then brought out 2 more cups and gave it to people across from us and rolled her eyes at us... I don't understand what we did to get the eyeroll other than asking for a cup? It was very strange, we asked for 2 cups more since there were four of us, and she got real shitty about everyone asking for coffee. I don't think we were being rude at all. Then things got weirder, we waited for another hour, and we saw that we were 4, 4-tops away on the list. My friends name was in the bottom of the page, another hour goes by (we are at 2 hours now) and groups of 4 or more that have been waiting for less than 45 minutes were getting seated. We were very confused. The hostess kept rolling her eyes at us and I don't know why. I don't understand what we were doing to upset her other than standing and waiting in line. My friend checked again, and a new list was made and there were 4, 4 tops ahead of us again and she was in a different page and in another area. We don't understand why she crossed us out from the other page and moved us down about 4, 4-tops, the only thing we asked for was coffee which we would be glad to pay for 2 hours ago. Things got strange when she suggested the 4 seater should be a three top and luckily the other host called our names, she was at the same time directing a 3 top to sit where we were and looked pissed that we were seated. The host made a comment about how long we were waiting and our waitress too. I will say the other host was kind and amicable. Having been a hostess before I understand how busy and stressful it can be when things are busy, but I don't understand why one should roll eyes and snap at people that are asking basic questions. It made me never want to come here again. I've never dealt with a hostile front of house before but this hostess was awful.

As commonly known, Plow has a very long wait for brunch on the weekends, and unfortunately, weekends are the only chance I get to have brunch in the city.  But, if you do have a chance to stop by, I'd recommend! It's located in a home-y neighborhood, with small shops down 18th and Farley's coffee shop down the way if you need a place to wait (or some coffee to settle your hunger!). \n\nMy boyfriend and I waited a decent 1.5 hours to get seated, closer to 2 hours to get our food.  We were seated outside, and thankfully it was a beautiful day in SF.  Although there was a slight chill (it's SF in February, expected lol), they provide blankets on the outside seats in case you get cold. Such a sweet touch, and made waiting for our food less uncomfortable.  Snuggling in, we both ordered the Plow, a combo breakfast platter with potatoes, 2 lemon ricotta pancakes, choice of chicken apple sausage, homemade pork sausage, or bacon, and 2 eggs any style. We got our eggs sunnyside up (the best way!) and ordered pork sausage with one order, and chicken apple with the other so we can share.  Chicken apple sausage was the winning protein for me!  The pork sausage was more of a patty, and not as juicy as I would have expected, I'd opt for chicken apple sausage if you're trying to decide! \n\"The Plow\" is like a familiar, warm hug! My favorite part were the lemon ricotta pancakes.  They were the perfect size so you get a wholesome taste, but not overpowering to the point where you can't finish your meal. The flavor was refreshing, and I love the creaminess/fluffiness the ricotta gives the pancake. Though pretty steep at $17.50 a plate, I thoroughly enjoyed the food, and both my boyfriend and I finish our plates clean.  \n\nIf you ever have 2-3 hours to spare on a weekend, I'd recommend to stop by~ (if not, try for a weekday as I hear those wait times are much more reasonable).", "author": "Tina T."}

The Plow plate has two eggs, meat of choice, two lemon ricotta pancakes, and plow potatoes. The eggs were perfectly over easy.

Considering I'm long past the peak age of waiting hours for brunch, deciding to come to a must-visit destination on a Saturday was a bold move, but we wanted to do something special for a friend's birthday. \n\nMoving on. I got there at 10 AM and was told it would be 1.5 - 2 hours for four. Fine, I get it, SF takes brunch seriously. My friends linked up and we decided we were going to stick it out, considering usually a suggested time is an overshoot. Well, it's not, and it's obvious the front-of-house staff doesn't care for their customers. Others waiting were enjoying cups of coffee, I asked if I could also have one,  but they were brewing at the moment and the hostess mentioned she'd bring me a cup. 30 minutes went by, and I went back to check in, as I understand they were insanely busy. Still not ready... Okay, that's fine too, but I was constantly greeted with glares and eye rolls. Finally received some coffee, but the wait continues and came with more staring and eye rolls.\n\nAfter two hours, I went in to check on the list and the dwindling crowd where people were obviously being seated before us. At one point, there were three groups in front of us, when I went back in 30 min later, there were four more groups AND my name had obviously been moved to the next page on the list. I have never seen/imagined something like this to happen, and I'm hoping it is in fact not true and a figment of my hangry imagination.\n\nFinally, the other host sat us 2.5 hours later and apologized. At the same time, the other hostess with the evil eye was trying to seat others at our table. Definitely felt like we were being bumped.\n\nNow to the good part and the fact that our wait/experience ended on a GREAT NOTE. Our server (I didn't catch her name!) was an absolute gem.

We got here around 10 am and we had to wait an hour for a table.  They print a new menu everyday, so it's great to see how they change things up.  So after waiting for an hour my friend and I studied the menu inside out and already knew what we were going to order when they seated us.   So here's what we ordered\n\nThe plow:  the plow has two eggs (any style you want), two lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes or sausages (don't get the pork sausage).   This was a pretty decent size order. However, i wasn't completely impressed by this dish because i was disappointed in the pork sausage. it was a little too chewy for me. The Lemon Ricotta pancakes were ok, it did have a lot of lemon flavor, but it wasn't as fluffy as i hoped for.   \n\nProsciutto and gruyere toast-  this dish came with potatoes.  My friend loved the potatoes, but i felt it was too dry.   We actually found a hair in this dish, but we just took it off and let it go, we waited an hour for food, we didn't want to wait anymore for it to be sent back to the kitchen.  This dish turned out pretty good.  I loved prosciutto, so anything with prosciutto is perfect. \n\nOverall,the service was great, next time i'll get here early so that we didn't have to wait until noon for food.

As long as you get your name on the list before closing at 2pm they will feed you! \n\nThey have indoor and outdoor seating we chose whatever came first. They do offer blankets for those seated outside. Luckily we got a seat inside very close quarters. They also some bar seating. Service was great, they cleaned tables quickly to keep the lines moving. Waitress was really sweet and was quick with our order. We were starving by the time we sat down. My BF went with the \"plow\" basically a little of everything. I went with their breakfast sandwich which comes with a side of house potatoes. The plow comes with eggs (your preference on cooking style), sausage patties, house potatoes and two mini lemon ricotta pancakes. Sadly they sold out of biscuits when we sat down. The lemon ricotta pancakes are delish! Soft fluffy puffs of pancake goodness with a tart zing of lemon. The ricotta cuts the sweetness from the pancakes and syrup giving it a nice balanced flavor profile. I really liked them, they were the perfect size. My bf really liked the flavor of the sausage patties. The eggs were sunny side up and cooked perfectly. Runny yoke but crispy edges just the way I like mine cooked. I really enjoyed the house potatoes. Some days you just feel like hardy chunks of potatoes versus crispy hash browns. The potatoes were seasoned well great flavor didn't need any additional seasoning. Nice and fork tender with a little crispy potato skin outside. I devoured my potatoes. Let's not forget my breakfast sandwich! Two fried eggs, aioli, fris\u00e9e, no cheddar for me, sandwich between two toasted Acme buns. Delicious! With a good side of house potatoes. When you bite into it, the egg bursts and you get the nice runny yolk all over your sandwich. Added a little hot sauce and it was perfection. Loved the refreshing crisp of the fris\u00e9e. The bread was fresh and soft. The aioli added great flavor and moisture to the bread. \n\nOverall a great food experience. I'll be honest not worth the hour wait to get in.

The two main brunches came wit bread and fried potatoes. Holy, those potatoes were to die for. I watched the chef toss them with salt and herbs and then had the pleasure of eating a half a plate of them. The steak+eggs definitely stole the show. Highly recommend this if you're in for a big breakfast!\n\n[Drinks]\nI had the mimosas. I didn't think they were that special as I've had better mimosas, but they went well with my food.

Everything on the menu is pretty classic brunch fare. My biggest struggle when brunching is having to choose between sweet and savory, so if that's something you go through too, fear not!

The Plow is hefty on its own, so I like to split it with something smaller (like the breakfast sandwich). Are you the kind of person who is skeptical about ordering non-meat foods? Fear not, the aioli in the breakfast sandwich transforms the egg in such a way that you will forget you even need meat! \n\nThe biggest downside is the wait- this is a pretty popular spot so if you come at any normal brunch time it'll be something close to an hour.

See, I've had this place bookmarked on Yelp for longer than I can remember and every so often, in some obscure conversation, someone would mention how wonderful the brunch is at Plow. I'd listen with hunger and envy. I'd get motivated to try to find someone who would be willing to get up at the crack of dawn with me. And I'd be disappointed when my friends laughed at my suggestion of eating that early.\n\nFast forward to today, March 7, 2017. He was willing to meet me at Plow at opening time. He might be a keeper for that reason alone. When I got there, we sluggishly greeted each other; both of us were still in a sleepy daze.\n\nWe were one of the first to get seated and we browsed the many tasty options on the menu. He was a good sport about sharing The Plow with me. With two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, plow potatoes, and bacon, it was a good amount for a weekday breakfast. We also ordered the jiggly coconut mochi cake.\n\nIt was all excellent. Our eggs over easy were cooked perfectly with beautiful runny yolks. The pancakes had a fluffy texture with a bit of refreshing lemon flavor. The bacon and potatoes were crispy and flavorful.

If you want to eat in less than an hour then I suggest coming here right when they open because otherwise you are going to be waiting for quite a while. My boyfriend and I got here around 1016am and the estimated wait time was 1.5-2 hours. After the initial hour pass, the worker said it was going to be another half an hour possibly for a table... it ended up being another full hour and thank god my boyfriend knows me so well because the hangry side of me was about to come out and reek havoc among SF. \n\nI don't want to say parking here is super easy because if you come on a weekday then it is time limited and some spots are metered, however, I guess my boyfriend was blessed this past Sunday because we were able to find parking across the street right away. \n\nThe menu gives you a good selection of food and drinks depending on what you're craving and from Yelp reviews we saw that things most noted were probably their lemon ricotta pancakes and their house potatoes so my boyfriend opted for the Plow which gave him both the pancakes, potatoes, and eggs and I got their breakfast sandwich with potatoes. The food did come pretty quick which was nice because I was starving by the time we sat down. \n\nSo... breakfast sandwich was pretty bomb. I'm not usually a fan of runny eggs, still not, but it was under the bun and I ate it and it exploded and it was very yummy with the rest of the sandwich so I cannot complain. The potatoes were cooked very crispy, but they don't really have a sauce for it outside of ketchup and hot sauce so I didn't find much flavor with it. And I never really had lemon ricotta pancakes before and theirs definitely taste strongly of lemon flavor, but I wasn't blown away by them.

Mine came with strawberries and thick whipped cream on top. There was also plenty of maple syrup on the side.

The lemon ricotta pancakes were SO scrumptious. The lemon was just the right amount. Combine that with the ricotta and you have an amazing balance of sweet and savory.

This is the most incredible place that I've ever experienced!\n\nYesterday on 1/11/2017, while I arrived in San Francisco, I decided to dine in at this well known local breakfast and brunch restaurant at the Potrero Hill neighborhood. \"Plow\" is the name by serving the customers from young to old to tasted their contemporary brunch dishes on every season and year! The atmosphere is very natural and elegant as I welcomed there. The concept is much more modern and contemporary like Bacon & Butter in Sacramento and Great Maple in San Diego (both in California) has and it feels like vising to the old country's kitchen in the plain lands.\n\nThe employees from servers and cookers are doing an excellent job for making the customers like me an outstanding service! Very friendly and approachable. No cons necessary.\n\nNow onto the food! I ordered the Plow Breakfast plate. It contains with your choice of house made breakfast pork sausage, Nuesake's bacon, or chicken apple sausage (I picked) along with 2 eggs (I picked scrambled), 2 mini Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and baked potatoes. As I ate it, that plate taste irresistibly delicious! The chicken apple sausage taste remarkable and flavorful and it cooked perfectly for perfection. The scrambled eggs cook very well and fluffy to eat which I did feel the softness of the eggs naturally. The potatoes cooked not bad and perfectly seasoned for both salt and black pepper. The biggest winner for the Plow Breakfast plate is the Lemon Ricotta pancakes! The pancakes tasted flawless and magnificent which I did feel the flavors of lemon and ricotta combined into a one great taste! Adding with a maple syrup is a breeze of fresh air. What a great breakfast meal indeed!\n\nParking at Plow can be challenging to park. You can park at the nearest surface street parking if it's available, but you'll better be act quickly to find the best spot to park. You can also ride a bike, walk or public transportation easier without the hassles.\n\nIn the end, Plow is the most majestic and sensational local breakfast/brunch duo restaurant that I've ever enjoyed the most!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-02-14", "description": "I couldn't decide between 4 and 5 stars and was going back and forth, but opted to give credit where credit is due. Plow creates a unique brunch experience, and while not everything on the menu is exceptional, certain menu options will change the way you think about \"typical\" breakfast meals. \n\nFirst off, the wait can be horrendous if you get here at not the right time. The best move is to arrive at 7:45am and you're most likely guaranteed to get seated with the first group. 15 min wait is worth the early rise. And the food (as well as the endless coffee) will remove any other doubts you had about not sleeping in.\n\nLet's revisit the coffee though. They have a special plow blend that they serve from Equator Coffee and if the smell of eggs and toast doesn't wake you up, the coffee sure will. It only costs $3.50 and they keep it coming the entire time you're there.\n\nNext, I ordered the gruyere and prosciutto toast and, to satisfy my sweet tooth, I order one ricotta lemon pancake. The toast was great, but not anything special. Sure the soft and warm yolk of fried egg on top of the toast slowly dripping onto the prosciutto and soaking in to the toast makes it irresistible, but this toast did not change my life. In fact, I am confident that I can recreate this at home. Additionally, the potatoes were solid, but I've had much better potatoes in the past. At this point I was leaning towards 4 stars.\n\n...then I tasted the pancake...\n\nAnd, for the first time in my life, I understood what a perfect pancake feels and tastes like. The pancake itself was an oxymoron: fluffy, but compact; light, but rich in flavor; strong lemon flavor, but hidden sweetness. It was so good, I forced my friend (who was full at that point) to try some. Hands down, the best pancake I've ever had. There is no comparison. None.\n\nThe most striking thing about Plow is the fact that the space is so simple and unsuspecting. And that's what gives it character. You come in with high expectations given the favorable reviews, but somehow Plow still manages to make you feel comfortable and catches you off guard. \n\nI didn't fully believe the hype before I ate here, but after experiencing it for myself I can truly say I'm sold. Plow, you earned 5 stars and then some. Thanks for everything.", "author": "Vasiliy M."}

What I've learned is to not let all places with 1-2 hour waits prove themselves worthy based on how esthetically  pleasing their decor looks or how well their food photographs. With that being said, Plow is easily one of the few places in SF that is NOT worth the 1-2 hour wait, money or camera space. If you're going to wait anywhere for a table during brunch, do yourself a favor and play the waiting game at better restaurants like Kitchen Story, Sweet Maple or Mission Beach Cafe. Luckily service was nice and attentive which is always the more important everlasting impression anyways. \n\nThe Breakfast Sandwich with Bacon- the best part about this sandwich was the cheddar cheese, aioli and fris\u00e9e. The eggs are supposed to be served soft, but mine in particular came out hard. Bacon was soggy. \n\nThe Plow- basically Plow's version of a Denny's Grand Slam. I hate lemon but love ricotta. I gave the lemon ricotta pancakes a try but if you're anything like me then definitely skip out on these. I overheard another customer sub out these pancakes for the almond flour pancakes instead.

They offer simple brunch classics that are done perfectly. My personal favorite is the Plow, which is breakfast sampler of all things good in the breakfast world: lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes, home made pork sausage (other meat options, but the sausage is my #1). My fianc\u00e9 ordered a new one, the dungeness crab scrambled eggs, which was DOPE.\n\nThe inside interior is rustic romantic (you know that weathered wood, farmhouse feel). Service is great. I always feel like I am eating at home with my mom cooking me a great meal. It also has that neighborhood feel. One time I ate, a cop parked and just said hello and gave badge stickers to all the kids. There is ample street parking everywhere, so not an issue if you want to drive over.\n\nI hear the line can get really long, but I am the crazy person that gets there around 7:30 am and is the first person in line. Around 7:45 people start lining up in masses. One thing to note if you want to be cray like me and be the first people seated, one time the biscuits weren't ready for us that early. Not really sure when they are typically done. But the biscuits there, also DOPE.", "author": "Frances P."}

I don't see anything special about this dish. \n--Soft scrambled eggs (4/5): it was good but again, I could have just made it at home. My friend and I was trying to look through the menu to order something special, but we can't find any. \n--Side order: Lemon Ricotta Pancake (4/5): probably our favorite item but have to say, Zazie does a better job in making their ricotta pancakes. \n\nMy friend and I had such a big expectation about Plow and our time there in the end termed out to be pretty disappointing.", "author": "Clare L."}

Where else could you find all these options (and more)? Who knows. But they certainly have them here, and they certainly do them well. There is also a more lunch-like part of the menu, but who cares.

I have visited twice in the past year and tried a sampling of their items. Everything is good but nothing (and I truly mean nothing) is worth waiting more than 30 minutes. Plow is pretty small but the staff does cram quite a few tables in the narrow space which also has bar seating and outdoor tables. I would definitely not recommend coming if you have a large group, or really any group larger than 3. The space is very simple and perfect for a brunch joint. There is a ton of natural light which is perfect for snapping some pictures of your food which is what EVERYONE in this restaurant is doing all of the time.\n\nI have sampled the Plow, the Prosciutto and Gruyere toast and the Breakfast Sandwich. My least favorite was DEFINITELY the Plow. Super overrated and nothing on the plate was really noteworthy. The pancakes are pretty basic and I think compared to a lot of the other notable places in the city offering lemon ricotta pancakes, the weakest. The Prosciutto and Gruyere toast is a pretty solid option and the Breakfast Sandwich is good, if not basic. The prices are pretty high for what you get but considering how popular this place is, I suppose it is reasonable. The service is fine but be prepared to wait a bit for your food since the kitchen is pretty small.\n\nAll in all, I do like Plow and maybe this review is negative. I just think there are other places in the city preparing more innovative food that are less mobbed and have better pricing.

Then, a server that we were not even speaking to at the time said \"No we're not going to just move people around.\" I was immediately taken aback by the rude response-- as someone who has worked in multiple customer service jobs I honestly could not believe that an employee said something like that when unprovoked to a potential customer. My mom trying to make light of the situation said sarcastically, \"oh we'll move them,\" while laughing and smiling, to which the employee rolled her eyes and basically scoffed, and my mom verbally had to say that it was a joke... I was just rubbed the wrong way by this place. Usually, I'm one to stick up for employees that work in customer service, as I work in the food/drink industry as well, but the attitude here by this one employee was extremely unacceptable.

We had to wait for about 1.5 hour for our table. Partially our fault as we missed the first time our name was called. There were people waiting at 9am! The staff was very friendly and the place is pretty cozy. \nWe had almost everything on the menu... (we like to share)\n- The plow\n- Soft scrambled eggs \n- French toast \n- Salmon eggs benedict \n- Dungeness crab scramble \n- Breakfast sandwich \n- Hong Kong toast \n\nLoved their house potatoes because they were crunchy instead of smooshy. Their hot sauce was good too. My favorite was the lemon ricotta pancakes with the plow dish. The crab scramble was also delicious. Nothing really disappointed me in the spread we got. The Hong Kong toast was also good but it just wasn't my cup of tea. \n\nI wouldn't mind coming again but it may be a shorter wait with a smaller party. Parking wasn't too bad either. They also don't have room for stroller parking if you're coming here with a baby/toddler and it's pretty difficult to have a high chair given the tight space.", "author": "Jenna T."}

I had a small reaction to it and we also picked out a nut in the crust. Unfortunately the waitress said the chef said there weren't nuts in the cake, which is false. This is a serious blunder, especially if there are unsuspecting customers with more serious nut allergies than me. \n\nFavorite thing here: Lemon Ricotta Pancakes!! I am such a fan :) Apparently it's one of their specialties. I love the thin layer of ricotta within the lemon-ricotta batter. It's finished with a dusting of powdered sugar, and a dash of maple syrup really brings it home!\n\nI ordered the Plow with chicken apple sausage. The eggs are fluffy and potatoes are super crispy with strong rosemary flavors. I couldn't taste the lavender salt in the potatoes but it's interesting to know that it's there. Chicken apple sausages were on the saltier side and slightly burnt, but really well-made. It's a ton of food, so a solid order for even the hangriest of people. \n\nApple Cinnamon cake: small nut reaction aside, it was delicious. You can really taste the moist, buttery cinnamon and the crust is full and thick. \n\nWas it worth the 2.5 hour wait for a party of 4? Probably not. I could see myself waiting at most an hour for those heavenly lemon ricotta pancakes.", "author": "Julia Y."}

To keep it short, plow is known for their brunch. Yea, they do brunch well. \n\nFrom their lemon ricotta pancakes to their signature \"the plow\" brunch dish, plow has gotten brunch and break food down to a tee. \n\nA small establishment, anticipate an at least 1 hour wait on the weekends. Put you name down and keep within close proximity to the host as they normally do roll call ever so often. I would suggest that you come in a small party, otherwise I can't imagine how long you would have to wait. \n\nI can't deny that the food was good. But, frankly, I wasn't blow away.  Yes, their Crispy rosemary potatoes are super delicious, but the rest of my plow dish ( eggs pork sausage and I subbed almond pancakes as I'm GF) was mediocre. It was cooked well, but I actually felt like it was missing some flavors.  For 2+ hour wait...I don't know if I would do it again. \n\nThe BF has the lemon pancakes and felt it was a bit undercooked. Maybe it's just our taste buds? He did like his salmon Benny though. \n\nPortion wise, it's decent and within the same limits as with most SF brunch establishments.  Pricing wise, most dishes are approx 15-18. Which is a little most hefty for brunch. \n\nWould I come back? Yes--absolutely. But not with that wait time. I would have to disclose that since I'm Gf I'm limited to certain items.  I saw a lot of other patrons ordering their baked goods and they looked delicious.

After some evil eyes I was able to sit. \n\nI then went on to order two plates one for myself one for my co-worker. Shouldn't be a problem since this is an establishment that sells food and literally doubled the revenue let alone the tip. I had asked if I could get one to go and that seemed to ruffle some feathers. More on that later. \n\nMy friend arrived shortly after and we enjoyed a wonderful meal. As said food was great but a lady interrupted us and said \"for next time, this is why we don't sit people prior to having a complete party\" \n\nMy thoughts:\n\n1.) I doubled your revenue and tip\n2.) you only had to serve one person. \n3.) I am a paying customer if I want to order the whole menu who cares. Better for you right?\n\nShe then explained as I asked her to put something in the box \" that they weren't doing to go orders because they were short staffed\" I guess the guy or gal that puts things in boxes called in sick because we were both paying patrons. \n\nThe last part of this was after I paid and was still gracious enough to leave these brats of humans a 20% tip.

Outdoor seating doesn't get going until 8:30am, so once the inside fills up with the early birds, it's just a waiting game. Luckily, there's a coffee shop a few buildings down so you can grab a cup to pass the time and saunter back. No buzzers, your name is just called, so make sure someone in your party stays behind in the event there's a rare opening!\n\nI'm a big proponent of doing a sweet dish as an amuse bouche for brunch, and while you might be tempted to get the lemon ricotta pancake, do the HK style toast instead. It's a thick slice of brioche toast lathered with butter and then glazed with condensed milk. Better than a cinnamon roll. Trust.\n\nThe bfast sandwich is no joke. The minute my cousin bit into it (which was comical to watch her try to figure out how), the yolk sprayed everywhere. All up her sleeve.

If its not obvious from the wait/long lines on the weekends or the confusing fact they typically have a small wait during the week this place is popular for good reason. The restaurant itself is small, inside there is a small counter and the seating with tables can get tight so don't be surprised if you touch your neighbors shoulder. They also have outside seating which can be a good option depending on the day. Don't let the size of the place fool you because the food they make will make you forget about the seating arrangement. \nMy go-to items are the breakfast sandwich (I recommend you treat yoself and get bacon and or avocado on it cause it dials up the awesomeness), buttermilk biscuits (make sure to get plenty of the rich sweet honey butter), and lemon ricotta pancakes. FYI the biscuits do run out so don't be sad if you get there late and they are out. However my favorite thing to order is The Plow, their namesake dish. You get 2 lemon ricotta pancakes, 2 eggs, potatoes, and choice of protein. The lemon ricotta pancakes are served with maple syrup and are fluffy delicious. They have just the right balance of lemon and ricotta so the pancake isn't soggy. While I'm partial to bacon as my protein side, their other options the pork sausage patties and chicken apple sausage are also quite good.

My two friends and I decided to come here early (right when it opens) since we read from the Yelp reviews that the wait would be an hour to an hour and a half. We came on a Sunday and we drove by at 7:55ish (it opens at 8am on weekends) and there was already a long line, so I can't imagine how early the people came and waited in line! We dropped off one of my friends so he could stand in line while we were looking for parking. Parking wasn't too bad, considering it was around 8am, and there's street parking nearby (90 degree street parking on hills). We proceeded to wait in line, and the line was quick, only for us to discover that the hostess was just taking down how many people were in your party and whether if you preferred sitting outside, inside, or no preference. She told us it would take 45 min before we were seated (we had 3 people and said we were fine sitting outside). I can imagine the long wait time for being seated since the venue is small, and the outside seating only had a few tables as well. When we checked in to see what our position in line was, it turned out that they already called us (though we missed it), but they told us we were next in line to be seated outside. So in total, our wait time was about an hour. Since it was a bit chilly, they offered blankets while we ate, which was a nice touch. The service was efficient and attentive. My friends really love biscuits so she ordered a biscuit as an appetizer and it was warm and delicious. I ordered The Plow, since it had a little bit of everything.

All around BOMB brunch. Everything was amazing. I came at 9 AM on a Friday. (Black Friday to be exact) For a table for 4 we were quoted 1-1.5 hours and we were definitely turned off at first.. but then after failing to find a bar open that early to kill time while we waited, we came back at 9:30 to find out that all the other parties got discouraged by the quote time and left meaning we got sat after only a 30 minute wait! yay~! (So try to stick around despite being quoted a long time AND try to come early!) We got seated outside & it was a bit chilly but they offer blankets for every seat! Kudos.\n\nI forget who our server was, but she was very down to earth and nice despite it being quite busy. NOW on to the important part: THE FOOD.\n\nTHE PLOW:\neffffinggg AMAZING.\n\nLemon Ricotta Pancake? Small, but amazing. Fluffy and perfect flavor. Sad that I didn't try the other ones cuz they sounded just as appetizing.\n\nHouse-made Sausage? Really good (recommended by server.) However, my friend got the apple something chicken sausage and THAT was astronomical. I'd say go for that one cuz that blew our minds.\n\nFried Potatoes? Best I've ever had, hands down. Perfect thin crisp on the outside. Seasoning just perfect, not overly salted with the perfect amount of rosemary coming through. Inside nice and soft, perfectly boiled. \n\nSoft Scrambled Eggs? This is how they do their eggs and boy do they do it gooooooood.\n\nWe also got the honey butter biscuit which was big and yummy. (though I have had better biscuits) BUT to be fair this was more scone-like and we did thoroughly enjoy them.\n\nMy only regret is not getting the other pancakes or the prosciutto and gruyere (because I had another reservation elsewhere for lunch right after.)\n\nPlow, I will be dreaming of you until I get a chance to return.\n\nCheers to the team at Plow!

I ordered the soft scramble with a side of chicken apple sausage, and my friend had the breakfast sandwich with avocado. \n\nMy meal navigated the perfect balance between filling, aesthetic, (somewhat healthy?), and absolutely delicious. You could tell the ingredients came from fresh sources and the dishes were freshly made.

I chose the bacon, which was very much not standard. It was incredibly smokey and full of flavor. Never had this type of bacon before, and it was awesome. Eggs - standard. Potatoes were quite good. Slightly crispy, soft and warm on the inside. Seasoned with several herbs. I personally enjoy eating this with the egg yolks, but that is up to you. Lemon ricotta pancakes are as good as everyone says they are. Light, fluffy, and flavors everywhere. Lemony to match the fluffiness, and the ricotta there to give it that extra bite. Man these were good. I was also able to taste the almond pancakes which were good, but the lemon ricotta is king. They are a bit on the smaller side with ordered with the plow, but that's because you wouldn't be able to finish it all if they were larger. \n\nService is great.

It was a SOLID breakfast. \n\nThe only reason I'm not giving it a higher review is for the customer service and the wait time for the food on top of the wait time to take a seat.

Because of the rain there was a uniform line waiting outside the door.

TL;DR is it worth the wait? No, it's not worth the horrendous weekend wait; however, it is worth the hassles of going early on a weekday. \n\nThe menu is always changing, with some staples such as the plow, the breakfast sandwich, some type of French toast, and the buttermilk biscuit. It seemed like some of the specialties could be hit-or-miss (I saw someone next to me get something that looked fancy but small.) I'm also usually a fan of French toast, but in a lot of pictures it was surprisingly burnt here. Thus, I went with their signature plow. \n\nThe Plow plate is the epitome of perfection on classic brunch items. In fact, I was almost going to pass on Plow because it seemed so commonplace, yet so professionally crafted. It seemed as if so much thought had been put into every detail, you could perform mindful eating with your otherwise mundane sausage/bacon, eggs, potatoes, and pancakes. My thoughts:\n\n1. Lemon ricotta pancakes - the most memorable! Soft and fluffy (albeit a bit burnt), with a refreshing lemon zest balanced by an attenuated sweetness and a touch of creamy ricotta.\n2. House made sausage - a close second. The patties were wonderfully juicy without being too greasy, and I especially liked the extra dimension from the boldly heavy use of pepper and caraway. \n3. Potatoes - quite a bit of hype, but I found it to be just okay. It did have a nice crisp and aromatic tones from the rosemary, though I found the outer crunchy coating too thick, causing the potatoes to be too dry.\n4. Eggs - Scrambled eggs pretty on point. The texture, consistency, and taste were all well executed. It used less butter than some of the more indulgent scrambles I've had, making it a lighter version.\n\nI had expected portions to be bigger for the $17 pricetag on the bouge equivalent of a McDonald's big breakfast. If you eat it slowly, you'll enjoy it more and it the portion size turns turns out to lie within the narrow window of satisfaction without a debilitating food coma. Plow was memorable, delicious, and Instagram-worthy, but for a total of over $20 for a breakfasty plate, I don't think it's worthwhile to return after the one-time dining experience to cross it off my bucket list.\n\nI arrived just after 7am on a weekday, and by the time I left around 8am the place was nearly full o_O Sometimes I feel like SF brunch is a encephalopathic pandemic.", "author": "Edna C."}

First impressions here are nothing but positive. In regards to the cold-smoked salmon toast, the salmon this joint uses is really as tender, yummy, and pleasant to taste as I've ever had. Never realized how good farm-raised salmon could be ... something for me to remember for next time. The combination with farmer's cheese, pickled red onion, caper, dill, Acme levain, and simple green salad served only to complement the dish even better.

I often choose the Plow, which is eggs, those devilishly good crispy potatoes, choice of meat (try the new-ish bacon confit, which is basically   a roasted piece of pork belly -- so yummy!), and a couple of those luscious mini lemon ricotta pancakes. It really is way too much food for one meal, so you might try my trick of eating no more than half of each item and taking the rest with me. I also love the french toast, which I had on today's visit, along with a side of that irresistible bacon confit (I just have to remember to rescue the remainder from the office fridge later today...). The dungeness scramble is also very good, with eggs that are cooked just a tolerable bit past runny. I'm freaked out by gross undercooked eggs, so this works for me.\n\nThe only down side for me is the coffee, which is a very bitter roast. I know that a lot of people seem to favor that over-roasted, super-bitter thing, but I'm not one of them. Give me a bitter cocktail any day (please!), but you can keep the bitter coffee. Really, I don't expect such a small kitchen to keep more than one type of roast on hand, so I do understand they have to pick something that a lot of people like. \n\nI've found the service to be attentive and oblivious at the same time. I'm pretty sure I was the very first person to put in my order this morning, but I saw a lot of food come out of the kitchen headed to tables that hadn't even settled on the menu before my order went in. When my food finally arrived about 16 minutes later, it didn't include the bacon confit side -- that was another 8 to 10 minutes in coming. None of this is a big deal if the server addresses the delay with a cheerful explanation, showing the customer that they haven't been forgotten. My server didn't say anything about any of it.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-03-10", "description": "There are two parts to this review, the food and the experience. \n\nFirst, THE EXPERIENCE. My kids have Celiac disease and therefore need to eat gluten free and be wary of cross-contamination.  This is insanely hard to manage when you eat out, so my experience is always tainted by that. I spent hours and hours making a list of choices to eat in the Bay Area that could be safe-ish based on yelp reviews and website info. \nPlow had lots of Yelp reviews talking about the GF pancakes and people saying they were sensitive had NO problems there, so I decided it would be a great choice. I took my husband and 2 seven-year-olds and there was a wait, which was expected. We had snacked earlier. We were told 45 minutes, which was a lot, but figured we'd be ok. It was cold and windy on that corner and there is no indoor place to wait. So cold, that the sidewalk tables came with blankets for those brave enough to sit there. We waited across the street in the sun with other waiting guests.\nWe waited and waited. My kids had their tablets and were very good, but my husband's blood sugar was dipping and he was getting mad. We checked the list that was 10 pages long, not kidding, and kept being told it wasn't our turn. The 45 minutes quoted passed. I finally begged the hostess as my kids looked like they would cry, and she snapped at me that she told us 2-hours. Wait, what!? Um no, she didn't! I tried not to get mad and was holding back my tears at this point as I went back outside to wait. \n\n  ***See, a person with Celiac can't just walk into any restaurant and order food expecting it to be fine, because the way food is prepared makes it very unsafe for the most part. And these are kids. Usually you call the restaurant in advance or read lots of reviews, it's pretty exhausting when planning a trip. And there is always anxiety.***\n\nSo we just--kept--waiting. It was two hours until seated.\nTHE FOOD / Experience - Finally seated, I asked to order immediately for the kids. The server then tells me that their gluten free pancakes are NOT safe for my kids because they are made in the exact same spot as the other gluten food. *I had promised my kids yummy pancakes and thick bacon as seen in so many yelp reviews... I teared up at that point and my husband looked sick and furious. I asked could they please cook the food in a pan, that was washed, instead of on the griddle. She must have noticed the panic and excused herself. She came back and gave me a speech about how the chef would make an exception this ONCE as it was very busy (Yeah, I hadn't noticed) and we cannot expect to get our gluten free pancakes without gluten. me- Fine, fine, thank you, thank you! Can I get 2 orders of bacon? Her- Oh, that won't be gluten free either... Me- WHAAAAAt? It's meat... Her- Yes, but its par cooked on the griddle earlier, with the other gluten stuff.    O M G.   Ok, so thats how it went. The \"children's meal\" was $11 and came with 2 pancakes smaller than my hand, about 5\" diameter, and a small dish of potatoes. Those were good, not amazing, but good -and the starving children liked them. Husband and I had the hash. The meat was good quality but dry, the dish was just ok, and really expensive also. So $70 dollars and 3 hours later... we learned a hard lesson to not buy the hype.\n\nNOTE- The server tried hard to make it okay. And I really appreciate that she actually knew what gluten was and the dangers of cross-contamination to those with Celiac, because most people don't.", "author": "Jacquie G."}

The week before I got to plow at 11:30am and it was a 2.5 hour wait for a party of 3. We couldn't wait because we were hungry. Came back this Saturday at 10:30am and it was 1.5 - 2 hour wait for a party of 2. WOW!!! I know, the wait is crazy long. Instead of just waiting outside, my friend and I decided to get coffee 2 blocks away to kill time. Also you can order coffee, drinks and baked goods from Plow as you wait for your table. \n\nIt was slightly over 1.5 hour wait and got a seat at the counter. We ordered **Equator coffee $3.75. Unlimited refills. We started with their **Hong Kong style toast  buttered brioche + sweetened condensed milk. I was super excited because its been forever since I had condensed milk. The brioche we had was super dry. Was a bit disappointed with that. We had one piece and let the milk soak in to soften up the brioche. My friend had their famous **\"The Plow\". Comes with everything, two eggs, choice of protein, 2 lemon ricotta pancakes + plow potatoes. She got the house made pork sausage patties. I thought it was super yummy. I got to try everything she had. I really like their triple fried plow potatoes. Must have!! I got their special **Cornbeef hash on poached eggs. I really like it. Wasn't too heavy.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-09-06", "description": "It's a chilly late-December morning in the week after Christmas. I have the day off work and so, visions of soft-scrambled eggs and crispy potatoes dancing in my head, I head over to Plow for breakfast. There's a line outside, as there always is, but when I inquire with the hostess about the wait time she says there's a seat opening up at the counter and it should be free in just 10 minutes. Only 10 minutes! Lucky me! I settle in for a short wait.\n\nUnderstanding that things at a busy restaurant can take longer than expected, I wait some 30 minutes outside with nothing but a newspaper for company (no coffee, no seating)  before poking my head inside again to check on the wait. \"Not too much longer,\" says the hostess. Back outside I go to chill, and I mean that in the sense of being cold. Somewhere in there I watch the hostess walk down the street and step directly in front of a (slowly, thank God) moving bus. Another 15 minutes pass so again, I ask to check on my progress. \"Sorry, there's nothing available yet\" says the hostess, looking agitated. Perhaps she's grumpy from getting honked at by the bus.\n\nFifty minutes after I first arrived--yes, that's 50, five with a zero after it, as in 5x the original estimated wait time--the hostess finally gestures for me to come inside. Alas, the seat isn't actually ready so she abandons me to stand in the small front lobby. For 5 minutes I wait awkwardly looking at the sign asking people not to stand in the small front lobby. At some point a busboy tries to shoo me outside.\n\nFinally--oh, miracle of miracles! a place setting is prepared and I sit down at the counter. Frozen and too hungry to think straight, I eagerly accept the server's offer of coffee while I contemplate the menu. A man arrives and is seated next to me. He asks to order a moment later and the server obliges him, taking his food order ahead of mine. When he tries to chat me up later it takes a great deal of my self-restraint not to stab him with my fork.\n\n\"Ah, but how was the breakfast?\" you ask. The breakfast was fine. Okay, taken on its own merits it was more than fine. The soft-scrambled eggs were creamy and tender with perfectly cooked mushrooms and greens. The Plow potatoes were hot and crispy. Their coffee is nice and strong and served in big hand-warming mugs. No one can dispute that Plow's cooks have their technique down. And just to be clear, I take no issue with Plow's long wait times as such--it was the completely bogus time estimate, along with the sneaking suspicion that I as a solo diner got bumped down the list--that had my hangrily grinding my teeth.\n\nI share the tale of this ordeal with you, dear readers, because it prompted me to make a serious lifestyle change. No more waiting in line for brunch. Don't do it. Cook breakfast at home. You too can learn to make hollandaise sauce. Go out for pho or a bowl of porridge with Chinese doughnuts. Most pho restaurants even have coffee! Anything but the interminable wait accompanied by the gurgling Gastrointestinal Orchestra of hunger.

I don't know if I would wait any longer than 45 min for a meal in SF but this place blows many hyped brunch places out of the water in terms of quality and deliciousness (*cough cough* Zazie). \n\nI ordered the Plow since I don't know when I'll be here again and it's got a little bit of everything. I was disappointed that they didn't have any of their biscuits (though at $4 each, that was probably a good thing). The best thing on the plate BY FAR were the potatoes.

I asked for my eggs poached and I substituted a salad for the meat options.\n\nThe eggs were perfectly poached, but had no seasoning to them otherwise, and the salad was fresh and crispy, but again, bland. The standouts of the dish were the crispy potatoes and the lemon ricotta pancakes. The potatoes were so expertly seasoned and full of flavor -- they could quite easily be some of the best potatoes I've ever had. And those lemon ricotta pancakes were out of this world! The lemon is very present in the pancakes and is balanced nicely by the ricotta, and the syrup with the pancakes added a nice sweetness that wasn't overbearing. The pancakes were light and fluffy and don't sit heavy in your stomach. I'll definitely be coming back for those pancakes!\n\nSomething to keep in mind: Plow is one of the most popular brunch restaurants in SF, so expect a long wait time (at least 1.5 hours) on the weekend. However, if you're a brunch queen like me who's trying to catch 'em all, you are an expert on surviving the brunch hunger pains and boredom of long wait times, and having to wait no longer affects you. \n\nIf you are not on a brunch quest like I am and you are willing to endure the long wait, bring a friend to keep you company, eat something light beforehand, and try to come as close to opening hours as you can, and you'll be brunching down in no time.\n\nThere is a lovely cafe across the street called Farley's that has plenty of indoor and outdoor seating and serves tea and light pastries where you can keep yourself from starving as you wait to be called. In general, the neighborhood where The Plow is located is really lovely and has a stunning view of the city skyline, so even if the wait is long, the environment is inviting. \n\nI'm putting The Plow on my list of brunch places to return to, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an exciting brunch spot!", "author": "Pooja M."}

It's always fun to see them prepare each meal. I like that the menu is short and simple. For such a small place, patrons needs to make quick decisions! We ended up sharing the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and the Scrambled Eggs. Both tasted very light and healthy. Would recommend. The service was also wonderful.\n\nOverall I felt like we spent longer waiting in line than actually eating and sipping our coffee, but it's definitely worth coming here to get a taste of those pancakes!", "author": "Stefanie C."}

We were lucky enough to be the last 3 seated (at the kitchen counter, highly recommended) for a Saturday breakfast once it opened up at 8. We shared two Plows (with delectable twice fried potatoes & lemon ricotta pancakes that are quite different, in a good way, than the ones at MyMy in Nob Hill) and a Gruyere Prosciutto plate (with an Instagram/porn-worthy garlic chili egg running overtop of the open-faced toast - WOW) and were treated warmly and with care from the moment we walked in the front door.\n\nWe ordered a cinnamon bun, which came out hot and fresh towards the end of the meal, and was simply orgasmic. The orange zest that's baked in is an incredibly palatable yet subtle addition to the already-near-perfect bun. \n\nMaxine, the owner, is one of the nicest people I've met in the industry of late, and I really appreciated her talking to us for quite some time during our meal and sharing stories with us. The chefs were hard working and communicated well to knock out ticket after ticket during the morning rush - they were fun to watch! Our service was outstanding throughout the meal.

One day, we decided to head here and make that happen. The wait was long - and was to be expected - like similar brunch places in SF, and especially for a place such as Plow. The place itself is very small. When we (finally) got seated, we were lucky enough to get the window seat of the restaurant, but even our waitress had a difficult time coming to our table to give us our menus/take our orders since there was another table REALLY close to us. I decided to get the Plow so I could get a little taste of everything, including the lemon ricotta pancakes I've been dying to try. The food came out at a reasonable time despite how busy the entire place was, and overall it was just...okay. The food tasted average, and the lemon ricotta pancakes I had were just, okay. I've had lemon ricotta pancakes at other restaurants that have wow'd me and made me want to keep eating even when I was extremely full, but this was just...meh. It wasn't terrible, but it also didn't make me want to wait on a busy day to come here either because I honestly don't think it'll be worth it. For the price we payed, the amount of time we waited, and the overall experience, it didn't make me feel this place is as spectacular as the reviews had made it out to be. I'd give this place 3.5 stars. \n\nOverall, this probably wouldn't be my first choice to get brunch in San Francisco.", "author": "Victoria K."}

Sadly, these pancakes weren't as good as I remembered when I came here last. Yes, the sweet lemon and honey taste was there, but the flavors just wasn't as packed this time around.

I'm usually one to avoid lemon flavored foods, but I have to say these two flapjacks were some of the lightest, fluffiest, tastiest I've had in as long as I can remember.

We can enter the website to check from which farm the ingredients come from, it's a little bit pricey for a breakfast/brunch but hey, you get what you pay for, right? If we want good quality, fresh ingredients and creativity and love on the preparation, nothing more fare than to pay for it. \nOk, enough with the blablabla and let's talk about the food. I got the Pastrami, gruyere cheese toast, my husband got the tuna sandwich and we also shared a side of lemon ricotta pancake. Oh man, everything was incredible!! I highly recommend the toast, it's a bit on the heavy/rich flavor side, but what would you expect from a pastrami toast? I would not get an entire dish of pancakes myself but if you have a sweet tooth, go for it!

Right at 2pm, they do a final call from the waitlist, meaning they call out everyone on their waitlist and see who's there. More than half the people on the list aren't there so whoever they call out at 2pm AND is present is guaranteed a table past 2pm. The place is very tiny so a wait is inevitable.

I don't know if it's the coffee fiend in me, but their cup of joe was addicting. I may have had a total of 4 cups.\n\nThe meal was real hearty leaving me stuffed. The house potatoes were nice and crispy seasoned with what tasted like rosemary. The lemon riccota pancakes were nice and fluffy with just the perfect amount of lemon flavoring. Initially I ordered for over-medium eggs so the yolk doesn't run throughout my plate but instead was served over-easy and a bit salty. I typically refrain from using condiments so I can savor the flavor of the dish, but their pork sausage was a tad dry, overcooked, and overly seasoned with herbs that ketchup helped neutralize the taste.\n\nAs I was wrapping up my meal, the chef also pulled out a fresh mochi cake from the oven and of course I couldn't resist, so I decided to order a slice to go. The cake reminded me of a Filipino bibingka cake. It has a spongy and gelatinous texture with a coconut after-taste. Very delicious especially when warm. \n\nPlow is perfect for splurging on breakfast. Personal advice is to come early because they do get packed and of course for the owners to add bottomless mimosas to their menu- one can only dream.", "author": "Denzell S."}

We went for a stroll across the street to grab some coffee and toast while we waited, but I saw others order coffee and mimosas from Plow while waiting. The staff seemed super nice and accommodating, considering how busy it was.\n\nWe finally got seated after about an hour and 15 mins. We both ordered The Plow, which comes with eggs, lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes, and your choice of pork sausage/bacon/chicken apple sausage. I went with the classic bacon option while my friend opted for the pork sausage.\n\nBeing seated outside, I noticed that we were not given a jug of water that we could use to fill our own glasses, while people sitting inside were. It didn't matter too much because our waitress was pretty good about refilling our waters. Just wish they kept it consistent with the tables, though.\n\nOnto the food... Honestly I was very disappointed. My over medium eggs came with a perfect runny yolk (yay!) but overall were extremely bland. They tasted like they were barely seasoned with any salt or pepper. The bacon was terrible. It was waaay too salty and was not crispy at all. It was actually pretty soggy. The lemon ricotta pancakes and potatoes, on the other hand, were the redeeming factors of the dish. The pancakes were fluffy and had a good balance of lemon flavor. The potatoes were pretty good as well, but not remarkable enough for me to say they were amazing. I tried some of my friend's pork sausage and thought it was pretty average. The worst part was when I found a piece of hair at the bottom of my plate. Definitely know it's not my own since it was short and black instead of long and ombr\u00e9. It's too bad I had already eaten a majority of the plate when I found it...\n\nI also noticed that they printed the menu specific for that day. I'm not sure if they print the menu everyday, but I sure hope not because that would be such a waste of paper.\n\nOverall, Plow was definitely overhyped. It wasn't worth it to me to wait 1+ hour and pay $17 for a mediocre plate of food that had a hair in it... But maybe I just had a bad experience? I'd give it a try again maybe if the wait weren't so long.", "author": "Cheryl N."}

Everything was good, but nothing great. \n\nThe chicken apple sausage was a standard sausage in my opinion. I was able to try my bf's house made pork sausage patties, and while they do have a robust smokey flavor, I found it dry and tough.. something I wouldn't like to have more than a few bites of. The potatoes were a little disappointing; if you can see with my picture, our potatoes were more on the dark brown, amber/orange side with a lot of burnt potato skins. At first I said to myself, \"I'm paying ~$17 for this..?\" (I will admit, the actual potatoes (that weren't burnt) were tasty though!) It's not when we finally left and saw that other people's potatoes were golden yellow and plumped with starchy goodness. So that's what the potatoes were suppose to be like! The lemon ricotta pancakes were probably the best of the dish, although nothing that I would be dying to come back for. \n\nMy bf and I had the lovely outdoor seating on a beautiful SF day. It's a little comical thinking back that we were all seated on such a steep street/hill with an incline hahaha. That's SF for ya! (Must...fight...gravity..!!) I loved the decor though!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-08-12", "description": "***This neighborhood breakfast spot utilizes high quality ingredients and a well-run kitchen to churn out delicious and satisfying breakfast and brunch dishes***\n\nPlow is located in Dogpatch, an up-and-coming neighborhood that will probably introduce several more destination restaurants in the next few years.  Plow is a weekday and weekend breakfast and brunch eatery.  The restaurant is small and casual though the d\u00e9cor is nicely done featuring homey but still contemporary notes.  The counter is nice and provides an excellent view of the short order counter where the team of chefs here efficiently crank out breakfast dishes like a well-run greasy spoon.\n\nThe food at Plow is not greasy spoon staples though.  You will see more upscale ingredients here like prosciutto and frisee as well as some great looking bread from a prestigious San Francisco bakery.  I had The Plow, which is their signature breakfast plate.  It is a hearty plate featuring two eggs, crispy fried potatoes with onions, choice of meat (chicken apple sausage, pork sausage patties or bacon), and two lemon ricotta pancakes.\n\nWith the exception of the lemon ricotta pancakes, this breakfast veered more towards fairly classic interpretations.  I had the eggs sunny side up, and they were quite good.  I would have liked the egg yolk a little less done, but the flavor was great.  The crispy potatoes were quite delicious.  The caramelized onions provided a mild sweet flavor while the potatoes combined a satisfying crispy exterior with a hot and soft center.  I also had their bacon, which was Nueske's bacon, a popular Midwestern bacon from Wisconsin.  The bacon had a smoky flavor as well as an appetizing pork flavor from the crispy fat.\n\nThe bacon was not as thick as Niman Ranch bacon, but the flavor was definitely memorable.  I also ordered their pork sausage patties, and these were good though I probably did prefer the bacon.  The center of the sausage was moist while the outside was well seared and crispy.  They get a little more adventurous with the seasoning so you get more herb and fennel notes with their sausage than you would experience at most breakfast spots.\n\nThe kitchen gussied up the pancakes a little more than they did with the other breakfast items in The Plow.  The pancakes featured both lemon and ricotta.  The lemon was nice.  It provided a noticeable lemon flavor as well as a lot of freshness.  I felt though that the ricotta probably hurt the pancake more than it helped it.  The pancakes had a great color and the smell of the pancake was very inviting.  Unfortunately, the pancake could have been sweeter.  The center was also a tad on the dry side and did not have that light and fluffy cake-like texture you would expect in an excellent pancake.\n\nService was fairly quick given how busy this restaurant gets (even on weekdays).  Prices are higher than your standard breakfast spot, but the ingredients at Plow are definitely high quality and the portions are surprisingly generous.\n\nI enjoyed The Plow at Plow though I felt the savory items were far superior to the disappointing lemon ricotta pancakes.  Part of me really loved the breakfast here, and, in some ways, Plow would rival my favorite breakfast restaurants--Matt's Big Breakfast in Phoenix or Huckleberry in Santa Monica, which features an excellent fried egg sandwich with bacon.  I would definitely go back and give Plow's other dishes a shot.  If you are a big breakfast fan, Plow is a must visit if you live in San Francisco or are just visiting.\n\nI believe free street parking is available in the nearby residential area though parking spaces are probably hard to find around here.", "author": "Anthony N."}

While pretending to be a flowerpots sitting on the sills outside, we decided to imbibe some self serve coffee (very strong - solid flavors). \n\nUpon being seated a little over an hour later, I noticed how once again new San Francisco the place is with a minimalist look, lots of natural lighting and light woodsy interior. It was also very cramped inside, but we did not want to wait extra for al fresco dining. \n\nOf course I ordered the Plow which came with the lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes and opted for the pork sausage and my eggs over medium. I also had a camellia iced tea on the side. I thoroughly enjoyed the fluffly sweetness of the pancakes but the CRISPY POTATOES were the star of the show; I now have a much higher standard for my brunch potatoes. The eggs were cooked perfectly (over medium is not really a thing so basically over easy). However the pork sausage was a huge letdown as it was very dry and had whole cumin seeds in it. It was remediable with dashes of Youk's hot sauce, but it was really just tough and dry. I had a bite of my friend's fried egg sandwich with avocado and it was stellar (though this is something rather difficult to not succeed in). The camellia iced tea was blase but refreshing.\n\nService was wonderful and our waters and teas were refilled regularly. I was a little miffed because the self serve coffee was ~$4 and there was no real sign or warning from the hostess who merely said \"help yourself.\" I guess it is San Francisco and people no longer bat an eye at a $4 cup of coffee. The area is definitely different now than it was when I drove through to lifeguard at UCSF in my high school days. \n\nOn the whole, a solid brunch place, but a little pricey ($30 after tax and tip for myself).

I came here on a Friday morning around 9:30 am and had to wait 20 minutes for a table for 3 and it was definitely worth it. Plow looks like a plain brunch place- the menu isn't that extensive and pretty simple, but they make everything so well. The place is also pretty small, but they manage to cram a lot of people in there! (There is also outdoor seating). \n\nI had the breakfast sandwich with bacon. I'm actually not much of a bacon person and I don't usually order it; I'm so glad I did. The bacon was cooked perfectly and almost a little sweet! The sandwich was also just delicious in general. The aioli sauce is so good and they really slather it on there. I also got to try my friend's order of the famous lemon ricotta pancakes and I now understand why they're so popular. The lemon flavor is quite prevalent, and the texture of the pancakes is crunchy on the outside and soft and cakey in the inside. So good!! \n\nThe place is also really nicely lit with cute decor. Such a nice place to have brunch with friends. Street parking is free and easy. I would love to come here again!", "author": "Ellen M."}

Super crispy fried rosemary potatoes, homemade sausage, lemony pancakes perfectly fluffy and soft scrambled eggs done exactly how they should be which I find pretty rare. Our server Yonya was great and always around for coffee refills. \n\nOne gripe though made it lose a star- it was $4.75 to order a piece of toast. It came with 3 slices and homemade jam that we didn't need or want and that price is outrageous, especially considering the Hong Kong toast with condensed milk was just $4.

Table for two AND outside tables are fine.\" Not only will your feet thank me but seeing other patrons who wished they were having a mimosa and a biscuit is priceless.

After a quick stop at Neighbor Bakehouse beforehand, we headed over to Plow.  We arrived about 10 minutes before opening to already a long line so still had to wait an additional 40 min after opening to secure a table.  We were flexible with either inside or outside tables to cut the wait time so I was a bit confused when two parties of 2 after us in line got seated inside before us.  \n\nWe got one of the outside tables that they start opening up at 8:30 and although it was a bit chilly, they provide blankets to keep you warm or to use as a backrest if you happen to be leaning back on an incline.  Per Ben's recommendation, we knew we had to get the Plow and if I did not just buy 7 pastries from Neighbor, we would have both gotten the Plow.  Lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes, pork sausage and two eggs anyway you like (we like poached), it is brunch heaven on a plate.  For our second order, we decided to go for a full order of lemon ricotta pancakes with blueberry compote and Vermont maple syrup.  If you order just pancakes, they are larger and thicker than the ones that comes with the Plow and comes with an order of 3.  At first bite, it tastes fluffy and light but as time goes by, you realize it is also decadent because of the ricotta with the hint of lemon lending a brightness to it.  \n\nIf I lived in the city and could get here even earlier without having to get up at 6AM, you would see me here more often so if this is Ben's way of getting us to move to SF, it may just be working!  Seriously though, although it is not foreign to me to wait in line for good food my limit would still be an hour.  However, if you don't mind waiting longer, I suggest swinging by Neighbor Bakehouse beforehand and get a pastry to stave off your hunger while you watch all the good food paraded past you while you wait.", "author": "Joyce Z."}

Okay, maybe I'm being a little dramatic, but let's be real, you can't find a more perfect brunch spot anywhere. First, I gotta give a shoutout to the street it's located on (Texas St, woot woot). \n\nYou will most definitely have a wait but you can grab a coffee and hang outside and soak in the views at the intersections around the block...not a bad way to wait for food! The interior is small but surprisingly fits a lot of people! There's bar/diner seating too if you're on your own. Service was seriously spectacular from the moment you walk in to the moment you (sadly) walk out. \n\nFood: potatoes. potatoes. potatoes. Get the potatoes. They are crispy, soft, bold, herbacious, and with some of the hot sauce on the side...perfectly tangy. The lemon ricotta pancakes are heavenly--warm, fluffy, with just the right amount of lemon and sweetness. All this with a side of the seasonal fruit, and you are in for one hell of a day. It is incredibly filling as well!

I've taken the cue from a few other people and tried to get here early.  I arrived before 8:30 am during the week to a nearly empty restaurant, and by the time I was finished less than an hour later all the seats were taken. So get here early.  Time went quickly, as I sat at the counter, dining solo, and enjoyed watching the chefs do their thing.\n\nFirst time I had The Plow breakfast.  This comes with 2 eggs your way, choice of protein, Plow potatoes,  and 2 lemon ricotta pancakes.  I like my eggs over hard, so that way I know I will get fresh cracked eggs.  I did not notice if the eggs for scrambled eggs or omelets come from a ladle.  I chose chicken apple sausage.  Everything was very good.  The lemon ricotta pancakes do not need any of the accompanying maple syrup and are light, and the lemon brings it together.  The potatoes are first boiled, lightly smashed, then deep fried and tossed with a few herbs and fewer onions that do not overpower.  Quite possibly the best breakfast potatoes I've had.  They pale in comparison to the undercooked potatoes from Crepevine, but that's another review.\n\nThe second time I had a simple two egg breakfast with house made pork sausage and a buttermilk biscuit.  This was an equally good choice, but I would choose the pork over both the chicken sausage and bacon, for the simple reason that the pork is house made, the bacon and chicken sausage are not.   Some of the coffee cakes and biscuits are only available until they are all gone, so it's a good idea to grab it while you can.  Same for the Chinese Breakfast,  which I want to try next ... pork shoulder with chili garlic ginger sauce, 2 fried eggs and rice.  It sounds so perfect. \n\nService is friendly and efficient.  Sitting at the counter I saw the servers correct the plates several times when the order was incorrect.  \n\nCoffee is provided by Equator, if I recall.  This place is worth getting up early for ... of course I'm up early every day whether I want to or not.  The only negative was the provided hot sauce ... it was not as spicy as I normally like on my eggs.", "author": "Michael M."}

Yes, there's a lot of hype...yes, there will be a wait...yes, there will probably be several tourists trying out the spot.  Typically, this will sway me away from any place, but after seeing all the pictures, reading all the reviews, and also hearing from several of my SF friends how delicious it was, I ponied up and decided to make my way there.  \n\nMy husband and I opted to try it out over the 4th of July weekend on a Friday mid-day, hoping to avoid the Saturday/Sunday brunch crowd.  We just prepared ourselves for a long wait - we ended up getting there around 12:30PM or so, and I think we waited for about an hour, which isn't bad.  My husband grabbed a beer as we waited, and I popped in to one of the boutique stores just up the block to browse/bum time.\n\nWhen I was browsing at the store, I asked the store owner what she recommended at Plow.  She started off by highly recommending the \"Plow\" plate to get a sampling of all their stuff, said to (\"whatever you do\") get the baked good of the day if they aren't sold out, and then proceeded to pretty much list off every item they offered.  Pretty much, I knew right then and there that Plow would be a repeat brunch spot ;)\n\nEverything we tried was excellent - every item blew my mind.  You can tell that every ingredient they use is high quality, in season, and fresh.  The eggs, for example - the yolks are bright orange, and whites so fluffy.  I learned that they buy their eggs from a local organic egg farmer in Napa - always delivered fresh.  \n\nWhile we wanted to try everything on the menu, we tried:\n\nThe Plow (two lemon ricotta pancakes, two eggs any style, choice of pork sausage/chicken sausage/bacon, crispy potatoes) *****5 stars*****- We decided to share the Plow so we could try a bunch of the stuff they offered.  We selected the pork sausage per recommendation of the waitress and poached eggs.  I can't even pick which item was my favorite - everything was so perfectly done and went so well together. The perfect amount of savory and sweet.  The crispy potatoes were the best I've ever had - crisp on the outside and soft in the inside, and piping hot from the fryer.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were the BEST pancakes ever, ever, ever, ever.  I will be getting these (at least as a \"side\") every single time.  Holy crap, so good.\n\nBanana Bread - *****4.5 stars***** One of the \"baked goods of the day\" - We thought it would be a bit much with everything else we were ordering, but since we received the recommendation to order \"whatever baked good they are offering\" we decided to go ahead.  We figured, \"well we can bring any left overs home.\"  Uhhhh, let's just say, there were no leftovers.  SO delicious; came out warm, had a crispy crust of sugar coating the top, had chunks of gooey bananas throughout, and buttery flavor.  Mmmm...\n\nLittle Gem Salad - *****5 stars ****** To balance out some of the savory of our meal, I decided to order a little gem salad.  I was expecting nothing special, but even the salad surprised me!  The dressing was amazing; fresh and tasty.  All ingredients were fresh, seasonal, and balanced everything nicely.  I wish I could get this salad for lunch every day!\n\nBubbles/Beer - We also opted to make it a true brunch and ordered some adult beverages.  Decent selection of beers and wine.  If a cup of joe is more your cup of tea ;) - I heard that their coffee (even their decaf) is excellent.\n\nOverall - this place is brunch/lunch perfection.

I had the soft scramble which was delicious but i don't know if it's so good it worth waiting almost two hours for. I also had a side of the lemon pancake which was deliciously soft. Our food came out very fast but that was probably but that could have been because we were the last few people to get seated to eat. The staff was friendly. I may try it again but I would have to go when they first open because I refuse to wait that long to eat again.", "author": "Kami M."}

I have to review Plow because it was an experience that was good enough to me that I want others to know.  \n\nI was here this past Saturday- 9/30 and got there about 12:30 for brunch.  I expected the hour or so wait and the weather was beautiful, so no complaints there.  \n\nThe host staff was awesome.  Hustling obviously, but happy, smiling and engaging as well.  Just great vibes all around (See the dread dude Randall at the door). \n\nThe food...I had really high expectations for the food as I had previously read some reviews touting Plow as the best breakfast in SF.  Usually I would brush these off as hyperbole, but in this case, those claims must be taken seriously.  \n\nI ordered the Plow, which was Lemon ricotta pancakes, breakfast potatoes, homemade pork sausage, eggs.  I did not want this meal to send.  Everything was perfectly cooked and the flavors were very memorable.  Everything, even down to the onions in the potatoes had so much flavor. This was clearly not your run of the mill brunch.  It doesn't matter how long the wait is here, the food is worth it.  So glad I got to try this place out while in town.  This will be a must hit spot anytime I am in SF.  \n\nSo essentially everything about this place is right, the hosts, service, food, atmosphere were all top notch.  Hats off to Plow for making this Minnesotan actually write a review.  I am already looking plane tickets to get back for my next experience.", "author": "Brian C."}

The Plow came with two small lemon ricotta pancakes (which were very lemony in a positive way), sausage, eggs, and potatoes. It was also $17... Other than the tiny pancakes, you could literally get that anywhere else for MUCH cheaper. The pancakes don't explain the steep pricing. The french toast was also nothing amazing, the apples on top were good though. \n\nLong story short, the food here is good, but nothing to wait in line for.

Many people were holding coffee, not sure if there is another cafe nearby or they ordered it from the restaurant as they wait. By 10:30, we were seated at the bar and placed our order of two egg benedicts with smoke salmon. \n\nThe restaurant had an extremely friendly and casual environment. Some customers came in athletic attire while others were in a casual dress. Outdoor seating is available. but it will not affect your wait time. We didn't understand why they needed 5-6 waitresses when we estimated seating capacity to be ~50, but everyone was always busy. There were 5 kitchen staff constantly preparing muffins and fried potatoes. \n\nThe fried potatoes were crunchy and not too oily. Even the bigger pieces of potatoes were crunchy which is extremely rare. My first benedict and salmon was delicious. But my other salmon was slightly sour and muffin a little too thick for me to enjoy. \n\nGreat for kids. But due to space limitations, not a place where you should dine with more than 6 people. \n\nFour stars because the smoked salmon was not as fresh as we expected.\n\nWe will definitely return to Plow.", "author": "Danae L."}

The pictures of the food looked delicious, and the decor looked super cute and up my alley. As mentioned in previous Yelp reviews, the wait is LONG, about 2 hours for a table and food. Because of the long wait, I had fairly high expectations that were unfortunately not met.\n\nFood - went with The Plow with house-made sausage patties and eggs over medium & the Hong Kong toast. \n\nThe Plow is easily sharable between two people, but who wants to share? The potatoes were definitely the highlight of this dish - they were crispy on the outside, but warm and fluffy on the inside. The pancakes were also warm and fluffy, but I found that the lemon flavor tasted a bit artificial. Sausage patties were underwhelming and under seasoned. In hindsight, I would've went with the chicken apple sausage. Eggs were also leaning towards over hard, rather over medium. \nThe Hong Kong toast was burnt to black and I don't think this is how it was supposed to be intentionally served. Not impressed by the lack of attention to detail in the food.\n\nAtmosphere - Very simple, but in the best way possible.\n\nService - I understand that it gets busy here, but there really aren't many tables around.

I know it sounds silly that potatoes, of all things, are what keep me coming back, but after you try them, you'll understand that these are not ordinary spuds. These little bites of heaven must be double-fried because they have the most delightful crispy edges that go into all the nooks and crevices. They're perfectly salted and seasoned with fragrant rosemary. Hands down, the BEST brunch potatoes in the city!\n\nOf course the potatoes aren't the only selling point for me. The popular lemon ricotta pancakes have a refreshingly light kick from the zest and are balanced out by the creamier texture of the ricotta cheese. They're definitely on the denser side, so if you're a fluffy pancake fan, these may not be for you.\n\nThey have a relatively small, but well-rounded menu that contains favorites such as the fried egg sandwich, smoked salmon eggs benedict, and corned beef hash. If it's your first time here, or for me the first 3 times, \"The Plow\" is the way to go! For $16 you get a nice sampling of two lemon ricotta pancakes, two eggs, a mound of heavenly potatoes, and your choice of bacon, or pork or chicken apple sausage.\n\nThey unexpectedly play throwback 90's R&B music all the time and I like the feel of their open kitchen and large glass windows that let in lots of natural light to help brighten your brunchy morning. The service is pretty average here. You're lucky if you get checked on once since they're busy running around all the time. They give you a pitcher of water though so refills are no problem. \n\nExpect an average wait of 1.5 hours, but if you're willing to wait until the early afternoon, you can arrive at 1:30 and only wait about a half hour since they stop taking names at 2pm. They can't accommodate parties of 6 or more due to their small size and they don't take reservations.

The mushrooms and eggs were very flavorful; the potatoes that came with them were a bit overcooked though but i scrapped a bit of the crust they had off and they were great. My friend seemed to enjoy his pancakes and will make the trip from Outer Richmond again for them. Service as very friendly and the restaurant was very clean.", "author": "Gaby E."}

By 759AM, there were more than 2 dozen people in line!! That's crazy for a Sunday morning. As soon as the doors opened at 8AM, we were greeted and went straight to the counter. (We always enjoy sitting at the counter to watch the chefs. The chefs get into a rhythm which is a joy to watch. Each station is so different and they're masters of it!!)\n\nAs for the food, it was above average. To be honest, in the past the food was a bit better. Whenever we go, at least one of us with get The Plow which is amaaaaazing. (It comes with two eggs, two pancakes, your choice of house-made pork sausage, bacon, or chicken sausage, and Plow potatoes.) This time we got The Plow and it was just okay. The potatoes weren't really seasoned, the pancakes were gummy and the eggs were over-easy when I requested for sunny-side up. The best part of the meal was the house-made pork sausage. It had some spiciness to it, which was great. My mom ordered the Smoked Trout Salad and my dad ordered the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs. My mom's salad was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, large chunks of smoked trout, avocado, and a poached egg on the side. It was tasty. My dad's corned beef hash was decent. We've had better at Sally's Dinner on the corner of 16th and De Haro. Both are homemade, but the one from Sally's has a better texture. The one from Plow was crunchy where it was hard and not as flavorful as the one from Sally's.\n \nThe service was great as always. They're personable and attentive to the customers. Every so often we catch a glance of them checking their phones and chatting, but it feels like a norm in the restaurant industry. Whenever we needed their attention, they gave us their undivided attention which is what matters anyway.", "author": "Aimee I."}

I ended up getting their specialty, \"The Plow\" - two eggs, choice of bacon or handmade sausage (pork or apple chicken), potatoes and lemon ricotta pancakes. I opted for sunny side up eggs and the pork sausage. I am not a pancake person at all, but the lemon ricotta pancakes were definitely the highlight for me! Crisp on the outside, but perfectly fluffy on the interior - the lemon flavor was absolutely delightful. I don't remember the last time I enjoyed a pancake. The potatoes were also excellent - super crispy and filled with rosemary flavor. The pork sausages were juicy, but not super greasy - I thought the flavor was great. \n\nPlow takes the classic breakfast and adds their own twist to make it their own. I've never had a breakfast / brunch quite like this one, which is why Plow is always so busy. They know how to do breakfast right! \n\nI knocked off a star because of the wait time. I wish the hostess would have been more upfront with how long the wait was. I showed up at around 9:40am and was told my wait time would be 45 minutes to 1 hour, but ended up waiting 2 long hours. Since I was told 45 to an hour I didn't think the wait time was bad at all, since most brunch places in SF have similar wait times. Had I known up front that the wait was going to be 2 hours I probably would have gone someplace else. \n\nWith that being said, I am glad I stuck it out and finally got to eat here - Plow is DEFINITELY worth the hype. This place is pure breakfast perfection and people come swarming here for a reason! Just know that it will take 2 hours. I definitely got a bit hangery towards the end of the wait, so I would definitely recommend a snack.", "author": "Samantha G."}

It was a little chilly in the early morning but they have open table on the outside. We were so glad we didn't have to wait too long for the seats. We decided to take the seats since we had to drive back down to LA right after. Then, one of the staffs handed me a blanket and said it will be chilly outside. I'm so happy about that. Then, she came with more blankets for the rest of our party. That was what I called a top notch service. \n\nI got the infamous egg breakfast sandwich with addition of avocado. It came with their well known potatoes. The dish is huge in portion. I could not finish the potatoes even though I have great love for them. My friends got the plow with home made sausage and they said it was really good. Their dishes were even bigger in portion. I also ordered an order of Earl Gray tea and it came with the most awesome tea pot.

What I mean by that is often times now when tourist come to visit and ask locals for a good brunch spot, there is a good chance they will be directed to check out the tasty and seasonal menus here at Plow. \n\nIf it is your first time here or you're thinking of checking it out, BEWARE that if you come here on the weekends, expect to wait in a line (~1hr wait time). This place does very well and for good reason too. The ambience is \"rustic\"--the tables and furniture are all wood. I don't know why but it does something strange to my body that puts me in the brunch mood all the time. Also, if you're struggling to pick out something off their menu, I highly suggest trying The Plow (eggs, potatoes, homemade sausage patty & lemon ricotta pancakes) or The Egg Sandwich (Fris\u00e9e, fried egg, bacon, aioli with a side of potatoes). Both are very tasty and stay on the menu throughout the year. This time around I had their Pork Chop and Eggs. The pork chop was cooked in a soy and garlic glaze and prepared with the perfect tenderness. If you have room for it, try one of their pastries too. I've never had room for one but they seem to be the first to go when this place begins to run out of certain items throughout the day. \n\nI cannot be absolutely sure but it feels as though they raised the prices on their menu. I remember The Plow being ~$13 but that is no longer the case. Everything on their menu jumped up noticeably by $1-2. If it comes from the price of a \"farm to table\" system then I guess I'm ok with it because the food is still very good and my experience has always been pleasant here. \n\nThe 4/5 rating comes from the wait time primarily. Sometimes it can get a little out of hand. \n\nP.S. The brioche french toast with cinnamon apples is dabomb.com", "author": "Greg Y."}

We arrived mid-morning on a weekday and were able to get right in to seats at the bar. As a fan of watching the action in the kitchen, this was the perfect seat for me. I fancy myself an accomplished breakfast-chef. Those that know me are probably rolling their eyes because scrambled eggs and boxed brownie mixes are about the extent of my cooking ability, but please let me live in my own fantasy.\n\nThe front row view was perfect: when this place gets busy, the chefs ramp up their speed and work together in the cramped kitchen to get everything timed correctly, served while hot and sped out to the customer. Watching them griddle batches of pancakes, beautifully scramble eggs, and salt a batch of the crispy fried potatoes and shake them around the steel mixing bowl before plating was theater of the highest sort for me (OK hyperbole, but it was FUN!).\n\nI enjoyed my Plow breakfast. I'm not totally a fan of lemon flavored pancakes, but these were perfectly prepared. If there was an option for just a buttermilk version I may go that way next time, but everything tasted good.

It makes it easy to not have to think or debate on different dishes, when this one is simple and both savory and a bit of sweet.", "author": "Audrey K."}

Crispy fried potatoes, lemon ricotta pancakes, scrambled eggs, pork sausage and a side of mochi cake was shared between myself and my friend on a Wednesday morning. We \"mmm\"ed and scarfed it all down while enjoying the warm atmosphere. Tables are pretty close together but I didn't mind. They also have a few tables outside if you don't mind the foggy droplets. We shared the Plow Plate and the mochi cake which was recommended to us by the people sitting next to us and finishing their great meal. Our waitress was attentive and we were in and out in no time. I have to say the pancakes, potatoes and mochi cake are a must and their biscuits looked fluffy and buttery. Their prices are higher than a diner but you get fresh ingredients with every bite. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in SF (as long as it's a weekday because I'm sure weekends are crazy and they don't take reservations).", "author": "Ashley M."}

But don't worry. If you're going to wait for anything let it be this! \n\nService: although I felt slightly rushed, I won't let it change my rating for this place considering how great the food was. It may have been because we came towards the end of closing time. Don't get me wrong, the people here are friendly, we just felt slightly rushed. \n\nFood: I ordered the plow expecting a typical meal of bacon, eggs, hash browns and pancakes. What I got was far from your typical breakfast! My favorite park about the meal had to have been the hash browns. I don't know how they make them or season them but they were amazing! Also the lemon ricotta pancakes were so fluffy and flavorful that I regretted not getting a stack of that all on its own! Amazing place! Definitely worth waiting for!", "author": "Joseph C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2016-10-02", "description": "If you reside in San Francisco and do not live under a rock, chances are you've heard of Plow. This may be because the food is delicious. It is equally possible you know them only for their ridiculous wait times (a problem that has become emblematic of any metropolitan area with a love of basic, bougie, boozy brunch). \n\nBrief summary of why the food is great. Any Google search will yield that it is \"comfort\" and \"rustic style.\" What this means in practice is an almost southern amount of decadence with all of the artisanal perks of any bay area establishment. You have your all inclusive brunch platter called \"The Plow.\" But the menu also has chia seed pudding and a plate of gluten free, almond flour pancakes. \n\nMore on The Plow. It's probably the best option on the menu, especially for a first timer. Eggs are prepared to your liking, and you get the choice between pork sausage, chicken apple sausage, and bacon. However the main attractions are the potatoes (so popular they are named \"plow potatoes\"). These little guys are perfectly crispy on the outside but ultimately melt on your tongue. Anyone on a diet--please evacuate immediately. To add insult to carbaphobic injury, the lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious. They are smaller than you'd expect, which is both a curse and a blessing.\n\nThe great food isn't the only reason this place is so busy. The interior of the restaurant is tiny, as if it is trying to spite you and your hungry stomach. There is ample outdoor seating for those who are waiting to be seated, but I'd also recommend exploring the surrounding area, or even walking all the way to the Mission, like one Yelper did. You will literally have enough time to walk several miles and back (if you can bear the hill, that is). Especially if you're trying to score brunch on a Sunday (but why would you do that to yourself). Alternatively, ordering a grapefruit mimosa is another good way to kill time.\n\nIf you plan on wandering--which I highly suggest--make sure you call them periodically or come back by the suggested time. When they invite people to come in, they do not call said people on the phone. If you aren't there, your spot is lost to the next people in line. I'm pretty sure they do this on purpose as a form of line management. Every time someone is called and doesn't show up, everyone waiting outside cheers.\n\nI only eat here once a year, because that's about how long it takes for me to no longer feel disenchanted by the wait time. A year out, and the memory of the line suddenly feels less sharp. \"Maybe this time will be different,\" I think to myself. \n\nIt never is.", "author": "Nicole C."}

The yolk was the right amount of runny. And the potatoes are honestly life altering. The seasoning is on point and the potatoes themselves are just the right amount of crispy. And the pancakes!

We wrote out name down around 11AM and knew that we would have to wait for 1+ hours, so walked all the way to Boba Guys in Mission to kill time. The whole thing took about one hour, and by the time we were back at Plow, we were 2nd in line for our spot!! (I HIGHLY recommend doing something like this while you wait--trust me, you won't miss anything). Once we got to Boba Guys, we also called Plow to ask about our spot and they politely told us that we still had about 40 minutes left. SCORE.\n\nFood-wise, plow is delicioso. The Mexican dudes working the kitchen are right by the bar, so the bar seaters can watch them make the fried egg sandwich to the french toast...it's a beautiful thing to see. I devoured the fried egg sandwich and my sis had the french toast. Their crispy potatoes are TO DIE FOR, just as everybody else has commented. Their portion sizes run along the perfect size to a little bit too much--I only noticed a few takeaway boxes being used.

I mean they were good but as a lover of lemon ricotta pancakes these were not the best I've had. They could use much more lemon flavor and could spruce up the blueberry compote as well. Maybe give you a bit more since there were about 12 blueberries in total and add a little more to it maybe some liqueur flavor or a wow factor. Perhaps I should have gone for the plow breakfast (pancakes, sausage, eggs, potatoes) for the price. $16 for just pancakes is a little steep.

I ordered a side order of sausage to try it, it was ok but definitely not needed with the main dish. \n \nMy vote: Go! It will be well worth the wait, I promise.", "author": "Tina B."}

Although many of the reviews comment on how long the wait typically is, if you go during the week, the wait is not nearly as long (I've never had to wait over 15 min which sounds crazy compared to what most reviews mention). However, it is still very crowded even during the week day, so expect to wait a little bit and make sure your entire party is present. \n\nParking is essentially just street parking around the area. As expected, it can be a bit tricky in SF some times, but there usually seems to be spots relatively close by.\n\nThey have indoor and outdoor seating, with a nice comfortable feel to the interior. Seating is a bit cramped inside, but doesn't feel uncomfortable. Although there is only one bathroom, it is nice that it is clean and tidy.\n\nThe service was very friendly from the moment we walked in to our actual table service. \n\nLike many others, I have had the plow. The portion size is pretty generous. The lemon ricotta pancakes are as good as everyone mentions in their reviews. The plow potatoes are also nice and crispy and well seasoned. I also had the chicken apple sausage, which was another plus to this dish. \n\nWe also had the french toast, which was surprisingly thick yet cooked nicely all the way through. The strawberries were fresh and, when topped with the syrup, was a perfect sweet start to the day.\n\nI've also had the breakfast sandwich which was also delicious. Adding the bacon to it made it even better (obviously!). \n\nAll in all, great breakfast/brunch place in SF. Be prepared to wait (especially if you go on the weekend), and it is a little pricey, but the food, service and ambiance will not disappoint!", "author": "Marc H."}

We finally did!\n\nI have known this place to be somewhere with a good hour or so wait especially on weekends. A popular thing people seem to do is put their name on the waitlist, and then wander off in the neighborhood for some coffee or pre-brunch snack. We waited about an hour and a half for a table inside. Due to high demand, it's possible you will be seated at a \"community\" table. Make friends with strangers, woohoo!\n\nNow onto the food, it seems they change their menu based on what's available during the season and what is popular. I got The Plow which comes with two eggs (over medium for me), potatoes (which are REALLY good, by the way), two lemon ricotta pancakes (which are amazing!) and a choice of their housemade sausages or bacon ($16.50). My friend got the salmon benedict ($18)with potatoes, and we shared two pieces of their french toast with carmelized apples and mascarpone ($11.50) Fluffy, I have to admit! All in all, the food is delicious and filling. \n\nI would come back for their lemon ricotta pancakes for sure! Their brunch is a little on the pricey side of things, but it's worth trying. I pretty much stayed full for the rest of my day.", "author": "Kathleen S."}

Luckily we were okay with sitting outside and did not have to wait for a table for two. They also provide throw blankets when it is colder outside. \n\nWe ordered the steak and eggs, plow breakfast and a side of Hong Kong toast. \n\nMy steak was good, but THOSE POTATOES. So delicious, especially with a little spicy ketchup. I thought the meat was a little overcooked from the medium rare I ordered but tasty nonetheless. The side of Hong Kong Toast was a must order for me as I love condensed milk based desserts. I was able to try the lemon ricotta pancakes and thought they alone would make for a very satisfying breakfast. \n\nIf you can get here and not wait too long then I think you would be very satisfied with your meal. If the wait is 1 hour + I think you might be better off going somewhere else. This is not to say the food isn't excellent and worth the expected high prices, but I just on principle don't wait an hour or more for food.", "author": "Harry S."}

Now that wait can be quite disappointing, especially since there's not much you can do around there to kill time. I brought my dog out that day and since the wait was 45 mins and we told them inside or out, whichever was first available was fine with us. Since we had time to kill, we took the pup to a dog park near by in dog patch area. But I hear there's a coffee shop not too far. We came back just in time and our table was ready as they quoted around 45 mins. \n\nI got their fresh squeezed orange juice. yummmmm, very refreshing. I ordered their fried egg sandwich, really good. The egg was perfectly cooked and runny. It was kinda messy, but delicious. The bf got the crab scramble which he really enjoyed. We shared the lemon ricotta pancakes, it was over hyped for me wasn't bad, but wasn't as good as I had expected.\n\nNow the highlight, why it's really worth the wait. Their potatoes, those CRISPY POTATOES. Nice crispy on the outside and fluffy potato goodness on the inside. They come out real hot too. I LOVE POTATOES and to me, they're definitely worth the wait.\n\nService was decent. Didn't have anything to really complain about. Food came out a bit slow.", "author": "Stephanie L."}

I've been wanting to go here for so long but I always end up backing out due to the long line. But there's something so catchy about Plow that further ignited my curiosity. Number one...long lines. Number two...great reviews. And number three...the pictures on Yelp look amazing!\n\nFinally I was able to pay a visit with a few friends from SoCal after picking them up from a 7am bus ride from LA. Since we were there around 7:30am, we were seated very quickly. It wasn't empty...but wasn't packed either.\n\nAmbience: Very relaxed. It's like waking up and stepping into a friend's kitchen while being strikened with a whiff of bacon and eggs cooking in the background. It's not huge but just right. I love how the tables are wooden...it provides the perfect touch to my pics for Instagram and Yelp lol.\n\nFood: So many choices to choose from! I wanna try the Corned Beef Hash, the Egg Sandwich, and the Crab Scramble on my next visit.  But for starters, I had to get \"The Plow\". What a huge serving! You get two eggs, crispy potatoes, chicken sausage, & lemon ricotta pancakes. The potatoes are so good! Perfectly crisp and seasoned with salt and rosemary. It went well with the runny egg yolks and chicken sausage. But I was surprised at the lemon ricotta pancakes. I'm usually not a lemon-flavored pastry type of person but the pancakes were so fluffy from the ricotta and refreshing and light from the lemon. I think they used just the lemon zest because they seemed perfumed with a lemon essence that I fell in love with.\n\nOverall Plow is a great place for breakfast. It's a little small so it's intended for smaller groups. Parking isn't too bad either...primarily residential parking spots. Just be patient and you'll eventually find one. I'll admit it's not the cheapest breakfast spot but it's totally worth every penny. I can't wait for my next visit.", "author": "Ralph N."}

It's just something that most San Franciscans do on a weekend morning, wait in line for one of the famous brunch places in the area. I've done it before and I'll do it again - although the wait seems far too long, Plow is mouth-watering good! \n\nRight on the 2-hour mark, our name was called and we were so excited to finally sit down and eat! For 3, we ordered the plow (they substitute avocado instead of meat if you're vegetarian), summer melon salad, almond flour pancakes, and the cornbread muffin. It was a LOT of food! \n\nMy favorites were the plow and the summer melon salad. The plow was the perfect dish for breakfast: 2 eggs, plow potatoes, and 2 mini lemon ricotta pancakes. If I were to go back again and get a dish solely for me, I would get this. The eggs were cooked perfects, the potatoes were just the right amount of crispy and had great seasoning, and the pancakes were soft, fluffy and just melted in your mouth. If you can't tell already, order this dish! There's definitely a reason it's named after the restaurant itself. The summer melon salad was beyond fresh and tasty. It had many crunchy melon pieces alongside lettuce, onions, cheese, and corn. I loved the combination of all these ingredients, but this is probably a supplement to your meal, I don't think this would fill you up.\n\nThe almond flour pancakes were just ok - they tasted more like regular pancakes to me and there wasn't really anything special about them. Same goes for the muffin, we honestly just ordered this because they told us they were running out of them and there was only a limited quantity so we had some high hopes. I didn't really like the texture of the muffin and the taste was just ok as well. \n\nService is great even though they're busy for at least 7 hours straight (7am-2pm). If you're willing to wait, go here! It's some good quality, hearty, delicious brunch food. I wish there was a shorter wait so I could keep going back again and again.", "author": "Malika R."}

I've gone on a Saturday and Sunday around 9am, and both times the wait is about 1 hour. There's a few coffee shops right down the street, so you can grab some coffee while you wait. You won't lose your spot if you're called Otherwise, if you're waiting outside the restaurant, bring a warm jacket, because there's limited outdoor heating.\n\nTip #3: The food is all delicious, but I especially love the egg sandwich.

What was even more awkward was the fact that they didn't ask us if WE minded sharing a table right next to the entrance with complete strangers. It was honestly uncomfortable and unacceptable.

Came to Plow on a saturday morning with my friend. We decided to brunch and catch up before she headed back to school. We waited a good 2 hours before we were finally seated, so either bring something to do, or get ready for some good conversations with your group. \n\nAmbiance/ Appearance:\nPlow is located in Potrero Hill and it felt very hipster and homey. Plow is on the corner, which is a good thing because it needs all the waiting area space it can provide. There is a few tables of outdoor seating on the side of the restaurant. Inside, there aren't too many tables, so most likely you will have to share with others. There was a slight rustic feel inside, but it felt very lively because of the music and background conversations. \n\nService:\nThe service is excellent. Servers and staff are super nice and made sure you felt comfortable.\n\nTaste: \nBoth my friend and I ordered the plow which consisted of a choice of meat, 2 lemon ricotta pancakes, two eggs, and crispy potatoes. Let me just say, the wait is totally worth it. My friend and I felt indifferent about the meat (she got the chicken apple sausage and I got the homemade pork sausage). I thought the sausage was kind of dry and was over it because everything else on the plate shined brighter. The pancakes are sooo good. They are cakey and moist, and just heavenly. The potatoes, were some of the best potatoes I have ever had. They were super crispy and seasoned well. It had some shallots or onions and other herbs. \n\nWith tax and tip, I think it came out to $20. Overall the food was bomb dot com! I would totally return again (but probably not on a weekend or at later times in the day to avoid the wait). Even with the wait, it is totally worth trying out. I recommend getting the crispy potatoes and lemon ricotta pancakes; they are just out of this world!", "author": "Vivian Y."}

I also ordered a rolled Jasmine tea.\n\nThe portion size is huge, so I couldn't finish everything but that works if you'd like some leftovers.\n\nAtmosphere:\n-The place is well decorated meaning colors are soothing and match the wood theme throughout the place. \n\nThe music is a little odd. Blend of house and jazz. \n\nParking:\n-There are side streets to park but no parking lot that belongs to the restaurant. \n\nWait times:\n-The place is small so be prepared to wait.

And we left satisfied. \n\nCame on a weekday @1PM and there was only a 15min wait. Easy...we went for a walk and checked out the shops in the vicinity. Table was ready in no time. (~10 tables, half indoors/half outdoors)\n\nWe got the Plow so we could try a little of everything. Variety is the spice of life and all that shizz. Came with 2 eggs, 2 lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes, and choice of meat. Not bad for $16!\n\nSo the food...Let's start with the NEGATIVES. 1. Compared to the banana pancakes at Bill's Cafe in SJ (A+), the pancakes are on the smaller side. And as we all know, #biggerisbetter...always. BUT if you're #qualityoverquantity, flavor is just right...enough lemony goodness without being overpowering.\n\n2. Baked goods were all out by the time we got there. +They must be damn delicious! -Get there early (definitely before noon)\n\nThe POSITIVES. The eggs were perfect..let's be real, it's hard to get eggs wrong. Potatoes were nice and crispy. Now the meat. For all you meatatarians, if you're not a bacon lover, please do yourself a favor and go with the pork sausage. I love me some bacon but after tasting my sister's pork sausage, I spent the whole meal secretly wishing I could steal her plate. Don't make the same mistake.\n\nOverall, a memorable breakfast.

I was so excited to try this place, such awesome reviews and even more awesome pictures.  Arrived and already tons of people outside waiting to be seated.  The place is pretty small and chaotic.  Checked in with the hostess who kind of just blew me off and wasn't very friendly said the wait would be 2 hours.  Yes, 2 hours.  I knew there would be a wait, and everyone said \"it's worth the wait.\" Well I made the mistake of saying yes, I'll wait.  So I put in my name for a a table of 4.  Checked in at 11:25.  There ends up being a ton of no shows due to the wait times.  Several names get called as they cross off names.  So I thought positively, and told myself there's no way this will take 2 hours.  Several other groups continuously check in.  It was a beautiful sunny day so we didn't mind the wait.  After an hour, our stomachs started growling. At about 12:15 we asked the hostess again how is the wait list looking, again very rude, short, and snappy and said \"your name is on the list, it won't be long.\"  So we wait and we wait, we hear a group of 4 next to us (who checked in about 45 mins after us) say they know the hostess and the wait won't be long.  To my surprise they were seated before us.  There were several groups who checked in after us, and got seated before us.  I was with my pregnant friend as well, who I'm sure you can imagine was very hungry.  Around 1:30 we checked in again and the hostess snapped and said didn't I tell you you're on the list.  She was so rude and awful.  We waited so long because we heard the food was worth it.  After the awful service and ridiculous wait time we finally got in the car at 1:45pm and left, mind you, they close at 2pm.  So very disappointed about my awful experience there.  Really hope they teach their hostess some manners.  They also should consider figuring out a better way to take down names.  I'm sure if you are in a party of just 2 you'll be fine.", "author": "Adrianna P."}

Breakfast/brunch is my favorite meal so I'm always into trying out new places with something different on the menu. Plow definitely is that place. I ordered the chia seed pudding and then a side of two over easy eggs. The chia pudding was AMAZING. It came with honey, fruit and bee pollen on top which was a perfect compliment. It was quite light so it didn't really fill me up but the eggs did the trick. The waitress was the one who told me that it would not be that filling which was helpful. At the end of the pudding and eggs I was still sort of hungry but I was happy to not have been too full as that usually makes me feel uneasy. \n\nAs for ambiance, Plow was very friendly. The design was minimalistic and simple which made me love it even more.

But I'm glad that's my only option or else I'd feel more guilty for not eating my veggies. The potatoes are so crispy! They're packed with flavor and I love the generous amount of dried rosemary used to season these carb-loaded tubers.\n\nI recommend \"The Plow\" -- two lemon ricotta pancakes, crispy potatoes, two eggs (any style), and a choice of bacon, house pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage. This dish is huge, very satisfying, and has variety. You'll unbuckle your belt and roll down the hill after you've devoured everything and licked the plate clean.\n\nThe Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon is also tasty. The muffins are too thick and too large, proportionally, compared to the salmon and eggs. The salmon is salty and flavorful, and it pairs nicely with the beautifully poached, ooey-gooey runny eggs. \n\nOur host was extremely friendly and our waitress was nice, but service was poorly timed. It took a few minutes before we got our water and for her to take our orders. We arrived at 1PM on a Saturday and were seated outside within 30 minutes (inside would've taken at least another 10 minutes). Plow is on a hill with a slight incline, so it felt a little awkward eating on slanted tables outside. Therefore, I recommend dining inside. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but parking is VERY easy in this neighborhood. I will definitely be back!", "author": "Priscilla W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-05-17", "description": "I was a little underwhelmed with brunch at Plow today. I was expecting that with the long lines at 10am that this place must be really good - especially since a lot of people travelled here from outside the neighborhood.\n\nWe left our names at the register and went to Farley's to chat away our 1-1.5hr wait. Why they don't take phone numbers to call beats me - too civilized that way? They do let you call to see where things are. So after 45 minutes we call and are told our table will be ready in half an hour. 15 minutes later we're back at the door and wait... wait.... wait... some more. We finally ask and they're like oh yeah, we called your name but we can put you at the top of the list now. I replied that we'd been waiting there for the past 20min at least and didn't hear anything. And we were watching them like a hawk because they weren't shouting people's names, just mumbling them as they walked around the sidewalk (it took most people several takes to understand that it was them being called).  Pro Tip: Try saying people's name louder than a whisper if you want us to actually hear you.\n\nService inside was good enough. I ordered the fried egg sandwich w/ bacon and my friend got the soft scrambled eggs. We didn't have to wait long for the food to arrive. Mine looks great. Hers looked like they gave her the potato dredges from the bottom of the bowl - lots of onions and burnt potato bits. I was a little surprised they even served it - it was noticeably poorer quality than everyone else's plates around us. Needless to say she wasn't going to take it lying down and asked them to exchange the potatoes\n\nAfter that was sorted we were ready to dig in - almost. I picked up my eggs sandwich and the yolk just dribbled away onto my plate. Okay, I can just sop it up later. I take a bite of my sandwich and yolk squirts out all over my hand and shirt sleeve. Yikes! I guess I should have expected it in a softly cooked egg but I had mistaken the sandwich for something I could eat by hand - you know, like a sandwich. So I put it down, cleaned myself up, then proceeded to eat it with knife and fork deconstructed style. Didn't really work because it was hard to get bread, frisee, spread, egg, cheese, bacon all in one bite. I ended up eating it one at a time and the bacon whole because I couldn't cut it into pieces with the knife.\n\nOkay, so these are all mishaps that shouldn't be held against the restaurant. However, in the end the food was just okay. Yes, it's better than your typical brunch place but I have high standards. The potatoes were crispy (deep fried instead of roasted) but bland. Definitely needed both salt and hot sauce to make interesting. Definitely looked better than they tasted. The sandwich wasn't that interesting - the extra for the bacon went to 2 skinny strips that I couldn't cut. Could barely taste the cheese. Was mostly a runny egg and nice bread meal.\n\nOverall, not worth the wait. If you live in the neighborhood and can stop by when there's no wait at all I'd bump it up to 3.5-4 stars possibly. My friend enjoyed her scrambled eggs and newly exchanged potatoes with added salt and hot sauce.", "author": "Jean K."}

So I'm pretty sure it was really good!! \n\nThe service was very good! The setting of the restaurant was very warm and cozy. There's an option to sit outside, inside, or along the bar area. The price for each dish is reasonable. When looking at the menu some of the dishes had an * next to them. Looks like some dishes they only serve until they run out, so heads up! \n\nDefinitely coming again to try the fried egg sandwich!!", "author": "Vangielynne P."}

I certainly have more important things to do in life.\n\nI went in on a Friday morning before I go to work assuming that things will move fast and boy, was I wrong. I sat at the bar, ordered the plow with beacon and found out that they don't have beacon. Uhm..., so you don't have the most consumed product in your menu at 9am? Well, then I went ahead with the chicken sausage per their recommendations and it took exactly 45 minutes for me to get my food. If on a normal Friday morning things are moving that slowly, I can't imagine how it'd be like on a weekend. \n\nSo to sum up, lemon ricotta pancakes were awesome. Scrambled eggs were fluffy and pretty good. Sausage and plow potatoes failed. Wait is frustrating. Prices are right.", "author": "Gokhan T."}

Came here for the first time (of many to follow) this last weekend. I don't think they take reservations so we rolled up and were quoted about 1.5 hours to be seated on a Sunday. We ended up waiting for about 2hr:15 minutes to actually be seated, so expect that or go as early as you can. \n\nI got The Plow which consisted of the legendary lemon ricotta pancakes, home fries, sunny side eggs and chicken apples sausages. It was a great introduction to this restaurant because you aren't just getting the lemon ricotta panakces, which everyone comes here for. A friend got the same except with bacon. The moment we got our food all the waiting was well worth it. Everything was perfect. Next time I will definitely try to get different things because everything looked amazing. Particularly the french toast and the banana bread. The chicken Tinga also looked great. We ended up being seated at the counter and got to watch all the workers do their thing and jam to the music that was playing (literally everyone was dancing). \n\nThe one thing is that there isn't much to do in the surrounding area while you are waiting. So you have to rough it out and stand in front of the restaurant until that fateful moment when your name is called. Then again, maybe there is and I just don't know the area.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-02-18", "description": "Bottom Line:  The food is delicious, the interior is cute and the service is friendly, but I don't think I'd typically wait more than 30 minutes to eat here.\n\nMy friend lives two block from Plow so as foodies and elite Yelpers, we had to give it a try.  If you are thinking about venturing to Potrero Hill yourself, here is some information that I hope will help you decide if Plow is worth the trip and the wait:\n\n- The Wait.  My take away from reading many Yelp reviews is that the wait runs one to two hours.  I really can't imagine waiting that long and luckily I didn't have to.  I arrived a few minutes before 8am on a Saturday and only waited about ten minutes for a party of two.  Since the restaurant doesn't open until 8am on Saturday, and we were able to get in on the first seating, we only had to wait long enough for the hostess to get to us.  It helped immensely that there were only two of us.  \n\n- Size Does Matter.  Plow is small and if your party is big, Plow won't be a good fit for you.  My recollection is that there are a handful of four-top tables but not many bigger options.  In fact, there website says they can only accommodate parties of six or less.  If you have a small party and want to sit at the counter, you can probably get seated faster.  And if you are a party of one, don't let the wait deter you, because you can probably snag a seat at the counter rather quickly.  \n\n- Food.  The food here is really good but not so good that I'd wait hours for it.  I do like how fresh their ingredients are and the uniqueness of some of their items.  You can definitely taste the quality of the ingredients they use and I fully appreciate their efforts to source their ingredients locally.  Also, they make many items, like their ricotta and pork sausage in house.   Because I was starving, we (and by \"we,\" I mean \"I\") ordered lots of food.  \n\n   - Breakfast Dessert!: We were seated at the counter overlooking the freshly baked breakfast desserts so of course I had to order the chocolate chip walnut coffee cake to start.  That probably isn't the right name for it, but just know those breakfast desserts are good!\n\n   - Eggs Benny:  Plow's rendition of the classic Eggs Benedict was wonderful.  I did it with the Fra' Mani ham (Fra' Mani is a fancy pork company out of Berkley that sells its products wholesale and to Costco).\n\n   - The Plow:  Probably the most popular dish on the menu, my friend went with the Plow.  She started it and I finished it!  (Hey, I said I was starving.)  Even though I am not much of a breakfast potato person, I thought Plow's crispy potatoes were delicious and I ate way more of those potatoes than I would anyone else's breakfast potatoes!  I also really enjoyed the sausage.  I am sure it helped that I had been in town for a vegetarian wedding all weekend and was craving meat like a cave man.  The homemade pork sausage had great texture and flavor.  For me, the lemon ricotta pancakes weren't worth the hype.  They were good, and I like the unique combination, but they didn't wow me.  Nevertheless, I think Plow makes their own ricotta which is very cool and admirable.      \n\n- Service.  Service was friendly an attentive.  Despite a line out the door, the staff remains calm and keeps on plowing through the service.  I also like that they kept my coffee full and didn't rush us out of there.  \n\n- The ambiance is very cute and the d\u00e9cor is well done - hardwood floors, marble counter top, big windows and an open kitchen.  \n\n- Extras.  Plow is a very cute, cohesive, well-thought-out place.  They also have a great, classy web site.  I can tell the owners put a lot of love and pride into this business and for that I applaud them!", "author": "Courtney K."}

Marvelous.\n\nAs we put our name down, the incredibly welcoming host mentioned that the wait would take about 1.5 hours. We were fine with that. We decided to take a walk around the neighborhood and enjoyed the bookstore down the block and some cafe's around the corner. We took a stroll back to check our status and we were cheery to be seated.\n\nWe had time to look at our menus and I decided on the Plow with pork sausage and poached eggs. My friend ordered the Plow as well with bacon with sunny side up eggs and the last member ordered a ham egg benedict. \nMy plate came and I was surprised with the large portion. I first began with the patty pork sausage and I felt that it tasted decent. It was quite solid and wasn't too juicy.  The poached eggs were flavorless and overcooked. There were way too many potatoes for one person to have for breakfast and I noticed that most of my pieces were pretty dry and burnt to the brownest of the brown. The lemon pancakes were a tad sour in my book. I ended up cutting up half of everything and passing it onto the other members of my table. I then drenched my food with the hot sauce that was provided and drowned it with pepper. I also ordered their black coffee that I thought tasted watered down and burnt at the same time. I was bummed.\nI had a sample of the ham benedict and I thought it was amazing. The egg had a slight hint of lemon that I enjoyed with this combination. But the english muffin itself wasn't crunchy at all which I thought was a bummer. The friends said the bacon was a Class A bacon which I regret to not have been able to try. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I really enjoyed my experience at Plow. I enjoyed the busy and bright atmosphere. The waitress was very kind and attentive. The hosts were really friendly and sarcastic. Maybe it was an off day for my pallet? Maybe it was an off day for the cooks?

We came here on a Sunday morning roughly 25 minutes after their doors opened (8am), and restaurant's first seating was full! (Man, everything good in SF requires a line!) The conservative wait time for us was 45 minutes for a table, which at the time had me concerned since my boyfriend and I had to meet up with a tour at 10am in Union Square. Immediately after the hostess told us about the wait I had asked about outdoor seating. She said that they would be seating people outside shortly, which concluded to me that our 45 minutes would be the extent of our wait if they had about 8 tables out on the sidewalk open.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had to strategize. If were were going to be seated before 9am, our order had to be ready buy the time they directed us to a table. So we went through the whole menu.  It was short and sweet which indicated to me that all of these dishes had to be good.  But the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes screamed at me, so I went with that and a side of bacon. My boyfriend, the Egg Sandwich with potatoes.\n\nWe were finally seated at 8:55, with our orders submitted by 8:57 (Hell yea I was watching the time!) Refills on our coffee and two waters followed at 9:02 and 9:05 respectively.

Local, made by Youk's \n\nWhat I did notice about Plow that put them at 5 star was that they gave out blankets to the customers who sat outside!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-08-27", "description": "One of my favorite breakfast places in SF, Plow serves delicious and reasonably priced traditional American breakfast in Portrero Hill. Bacon, eggs, pancakes, sausage, potatoes, and toast thrive here on a raw yet refined menu featuring all of the classics and then some. \n\nWhat makes the Plow different and \"better\" than other traditional breakfast joints is the high quality of their ingredients. The eggs, produce, dairy, breads, and meats served at Plow are sourced carefully and their superiority to the cheaper ingredients used by other restaurants is apparent both visually and in taste. \n\nThe restaurant is small inside although they do offer additional outdoor seating. The interior decorum is clean and modern with stainless steel bar and stool seating at the kitchen counter as well as table and chair seating in the dining room.\n\nMy favorites include \"The Plow\": two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, their DELICIOUS potatoes, and choice of bacon, chicken apple sausage, or pork sausage. I order \"The Plow\" when I am very hungry as this is a VERY filling breakfast. When I am a little less hungry I order the \"open-faced proscuitto + gruyere sandwich\" which is basically a piece of brioche toasted and topped with a garlic fried egg, gruyere cheese, prosciutto, frisee, parsley, and chili flakes.

The buttermilk biscuit came with honey butter. It was decent, though not worth the price ($4.25).

The soft-scrambled eggs ($13) were pretty good, with generous fillings (goat's cheese, asparagus, spinach, mushrooms). That said, it wasn't a particularly memorable dish. I'm not a huge fan of potatoes to begin with, and so wasn't blown away by their famous potatoes.\n\nService is great, and the servers were attentive and really friendly, which is fantastic, especially having waited for an hour for your table.

The wait staff is super nice and friendly!\n\nI wanted to come here to try the hash that my coworker told me about. Sadly, they did not have this hash. Fortunately, everything else on the menu sounded amazing. I basically wanted to order everything and eat it all.\n\nThe boyfriend and I were strategic about what we ordered. There was a matcha mochi cake, which I obviously had to try because MATCHA MOCHI sounds so fantastic. I got the Plow, because hey, this place is called Plow. Boyfriend got the 2 piece French toast vs. the 3 piece because we saw that there was HK toast. So...yes. All the toasts! They also serve Five Mountains tea, which isn't bad. On the bright side, they serve it in heavy iron tea pots.\n\nThe food itself was so very tasty. The French toast with strawberry and lemon curd on it basically made me cry. That's how good it was. I think I like it more than Curbsides, which is blasphemous in itself, but oh my goodness, I haven't had French toast that good in a long while. The Plow was delicious. I asked for my eggs to be hard-scrambled, but it was still on the soft-side - I guess that's what they're known for. I had to explain my messed up allergy but they were really understanding and fixed that for me in a jiff. The bacon was delicious and super crisp. The lemon ricotta pancakes probably would have been delicious if I didn't eat the fabulous French toast first - they were just a shadow of the French toast after the fact. Oh, and eat the potatoes as soon as they come out. That is when they are tastiest.\n\nI'd definitely come back, but I don't know if I'd wait for 2 hours for it.\n\nAlso, don't park at the bottom of the hill. That's where all the car thieves are, according to my friend.", "author": "Robbin A."}

That's the problem with being too popular: success gets to your head. Expect to wait at least 1 hour for a table on a week day, and 2 to 3 hours during the weekend.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-11-30", "description": "This is my all time favorite brunch place. Hands down. I try to make a trip up for brunch every couple months or so. The lines here get super long especially on weekends, but trust me, it's worth the long agonizing wait. If it is your first time here, I would order the plow (5/5). It is just their breakfast platter with a little bit of everything. On my numerous trips back to this place, I also tried the fried egg sandwich (4/5) and their crab scramble (3/5). \n\nThe plow is basically the most amazing breakfast platter you will ever eat. It comes with a heaping pile of potatoes (5/5). The potatoes aren't your average hash brown or the soggy potatoes that come with a diner breakfast. These potatoes are super crispy and brown on the outside, soft on the inside, and seasoned to perfection. You can hear the crunch as you bite down. You also have the option of bacon (4/5) or sausage (5/5). You really can't go wrong with either option. Their chicken apple sausage is the perfect amount of sweetness and savory. The bacon is fatty and rich. My only qualm is that the bacon is a little limp If you're really feeling hungry, get both! Why not! Also, with the plate comes the standard 2 eggs any way you like, I personally prefer them poached soft so you can dip the crispy potatoes and meat in the runny yolk. Finally, to top it all off, are 2 lemon ricotta pancakes (6/5). These pancakes are not your average fluffy pancake. They are slightly denser, but packed full of flavor. I'll be honest, I'm not a pancake person normally. Waffles win it all for me, but when it comes to these lemon ricotta pancakes, I would eat a hundred if I could. \n\nAs for the egg sandwich, they fry the egg to perfection. Yolk is perfectly runny, acting as a great sauce for the sandwich. The only reason this got a 4/5 in my book was due to the fact it really needed the addition of some meat. If you do get this sandwich, spend the extra couple bucks to add in some of that delicious bacon they have. Trust me, it'll take the sandwich to the next level. \n\nThe crab scramble had way too many green onions for my liking (I personally hate them and will pick them out given the chance, but this had way too many to do so). It covered up the taste of the crab a bit. There were large hunks of crab throughout the omelet which is great, but there were quite a few pieces of shells too, which made it a bit annoying to eat.\n\nAmazing food, great service - nothing more you could ask for.\n\nCons: \n- long wait on weekends and in the mornings \n- restaurant is small, so if you sit on the patio, it does get very cold\n\nPros: \n- brunch food here is A+ - everything is cooked to perfection\n- service is fast and friendly", "author": "Diana C."}

The pork sausage was ok, I'll opt for the bacon next time. The salad lost me a bit. I know, I know... Who orders salad at a breakfast spot... Still. It's a salad. And salads are in.

Now I'll admit that in 95% of restaurants I've found the host/hostess will overstate how long the wait will be, so I assumed we were looking at less than 45 minutes. Credit to them - they know their customers -- it was one hour exactly. Nice little neighborhood to stroll around in while you wait and friendly, relaxed crowd to hang with on the sidewalk (there are a few places to perch yourself if you'd rather not stand). Really cute place, and about 10 tables out on the sidewalk as well. We were taken inside at the one hour mark and they had coffee in front of us with lightening speed - high marks for that. The staff was incredibly nice and on top of everything. The husband ordered \"The Plow\"- eggs, sausage, potatoes and lemon ricotta pancakes (our friend had told us these were unbelievable and she was was right!)  I had a dish which was so amazing I have completely forgotten the name (amnesia induced by bliss).

When she met me at the table we pulled up the high chair thinking the woman had forgot, but she quickly came and rudely said \"I'm sorry ladies I can't do that!\" We explained to her that we had told her to add a high chair to the party and she told us to wait outside until she could get a bigger table. She then showed us she had two Samantha's and that she called the other Samantha. I'm convinced she just didn't hear us when we said to add the high chair to our party, and added our names to the list as a new party which made the wait time even longer.\n\nWhat saved that encounter was a really sweet busboy who came and asked what name our party was under to see what the wait time was because he had noticed every one being called except us.

We didn't feel rushed through, which is key after the inevitable wait, even on a weekday morning, which is when we went.\n\nI think the wait is the thing most people mention in their reviews, whether good or lukewarm. Like others, I was more than willing to wait a half hour for an outstanding breakfast -- but this was far from outstanding.\n\nFirst of all, the meals are a heart attack on a plate -- everything seems to be deep fried or cooked in vegetable oil (we sat at the bar, so we could see everything as it was cooked). My two friends got the Plow, which was two pancakes, eggs, breakfast meat, and toast. I ordered two eggs and the chicken apple sausage and toast.\n\nThe pancakes were, as others have written, delicious. The lemon flavoring makes them feel lighter than they are. The eggs were completely flavorless; my guess is that cooking with oil was behind this, rather than butter. I even had them add some cheese; what they added appeared on one side of the scramble but I didn't see cheese throughout.\n\nThe potatoes were delicious -- dude. Deep. Fried. How can they not be? Crispy and good. The toast was either a sour dough or almost Italian type bread which, when toasted, was hard to chew. The apple sausage was good, but not particularly memorable. For drinks, we ordered coffee and tea; they were happy with their coffee, my tea didn't stay very warm in the individual pot that was brought to the table.\n\nIn the end, if you do choose to go here, keep in mind that the portions are HUGE -- so perhaps share with someone at your table. I ate maybe a third of the eggs, 2 out of 4 of the sausage links, both small slices of toast, and maybe 1/2 the potatoes and left feeling very fool.

There's nothing like a bright and sunny morning in SF, I mean how often does that happen honestly? Good thing Plow takes full advantage of whenever the weather is beautiful with its huge storefront facing windows. \n\nWe opted for the Fried Egg Sandwich and THE PLOW. I thought the Fried Egg Sandwich sounded a bit ordinary, but it was far from it! Equipped with  two eggs fried, aioli, frisee, Vermont cheddar, Acme bun. The aioli puts a nice twist on the egg sandwich, and to top it off with Acme bun made fresh in the city, I could not resist. \n\nThe Plow is a must order at Plow -- two eggs, choice of house made pork sausage, Nueske bacon, or chicken apple sausage, two lemon ricotta pancakes, crispy potatoes. We went with the two eggs, house made pork sausage, two lemon ricotta pancakes, crispy potatoes. Man-oh-man was this dish delish. The pork sausage was nicely seasoned, not too salty (which is a huge plus to me), the lemon ricotta pancakes were AMAZING it made my mouth drop (and this is coming from a girl who doesn't like lemon zested anything...), and the seasoned house potatoes sounded average, but they definitely weren't. \n\nOverall we had a fantastic experience here at Plow. Parking was easy (no meter), we were seated right away (rare moment), and the service/ambiance screamed brunch, what more could you ask for. One thing bothered me though, there was a huge mix up with the check, we were charged an extra $20... Something was obviously wrong here. I've been reading about restaurants scamming their customers a lot lately down in Santa Ana, so I was extra careful to check the tab.

It's pretty popular, especially in the morning time, but it's earned its name. My family, boyfriend, and I went around 9:30 ish in the morning (party of 6) and had about a 20-25 minute wait from what I could remember. We were starving but the wait was totally worth it. \n\nFirst off, the service is great! ABSOLUTELY WELCOMING! Everyone there is super friendly and smiling, and always willing to offer you a helping hand, regardless of your needs. \n\nThe food was so delicious. We all nearly melted in our seats. I forgot what it was called, but I ordered the waffle with the strawberries & potatoes on the side. And I also tried my boyfriend's Lemon Ricotta pancakes. SOOOO GOOD. And makes me so hungry just thinking about it. The waffle was so fresh, the fruit and everything else complemented each other so well. The potatoes had the perfect amount of salt and spice and CRUNCH. I could cry just reminiscing. The pancakes too, oh my god. So much flavor. Lemon ricotta was such a good idea. \n\nThe decor was just a plus. Super clean, sleek, and modern. The clear windows allowed lots of sun to shine through which was nice. \n\nI will definitely be coming back in the near future. 10/10 would recommend!!!!", "author": "Lauryn S."}

It took me about 4 hours to decide what I wanted, and the server ended up choosing the breakfast sandwich for me - great choice! I ordered it with chicken sausage. The sandwich was perfect, it had two fried eggs, fris\u00e9e, homemade chicken sausage and melty cheese. The bread was a brioche bun and the sandwich was so delicious! \n\nMy friends both ordered \"the plow\" which came with A LOT of food! I had a bite of the famous lemon pancakes which had a great texture. Very tasty, but a little sweet for me. The coffee here is strong and made well, which everyone can appreciate.

Though I do suggest that you try to hit up this place during the week. The wait time goes down to 30 minutes. \n\nThis cute little place is located right at the corner surrounded by FREE parking. Just hope that you can find a spot! The place is small. Maybe no more than 20 people can sit down at a time. But there are a handful of seats at the counter where you can watch the magic happen.\n\nThe menu is small but features locally sourced, high quality ingredients, making even the simplest dishes stand out in comparison to the basic breakfast joint. Choose from a warm mushroom salad to a dungeness crab scramble to chia seed pudding.\n\nThe lemon ricotta pancakes are a popular choice. Very fluffy and light with tons of lemon flavor. I love the texture, but the lemon was a bit to strong for my taste. I suggest getting The Plow combo if you want to enjoy these. That way you can get it with two eggs any style and your choice of housemade sausage, Neuske bacon or chicken sausage. Some salt to balance out the sweetness.\n\nMy fave is the fried egg sandwich! Two eggs over easy sandwiched by soft, toasted Acme bread with frisee, aioli and cheese with the additional Neuske bacon (everything is better with bacon!). The creamy egg yolk mixes with all the components and makes it finger lickin' good! It also comes with a side of their infamous crispy potatoes!\n\nThey're serious about their potatoes. Smashed red potatoes flavored with fresh rosemary and onions and fried to perfection! They managed to find a way for you to have your hashbrowns and country potatoes together as one! You can't find potatoes like this anywhere else!\n\nBy the way, if you like scrambled eggs, they know how to do it right. Super light and fluffy yet still creamy. I don't even like scrambled eggs, but I love them here!\n\nGood thing I don't live next to here or else I'd have a muffin top full of crispy potatoes and bacon!", "author": "Daisy T."}

While the menu appears to have simple, classic brunch items, Plow really perfected all of the items on my plate. I got 'The Plow' which features the best of sweet and salty breakfast options. The lemon ricotta pancakes were perfectly fluffy and were complimented well with the little pitcher of maple syrup. The home fries, oh the home fries. These were very well seasoned, crispy and golden on the outside, soft on the inside. A separate waitress made sure we had little dishes of ketchup to go with our potatoes. Lastly, the scrambled eggs. These were also very yummy and I definitely got way more than the two the menu said I'd get. WIN.

I'm rating not only the service in the restaurant but on the phone as well. Service I'd give as 2-stars. Not that it hasn't been good it has, but it's also been inconsistent and poor - at times staff overwhelmed with the crowd or inconsistent messaging when calling in an order - sad to observe but sometimes the service is more along the lines of what's convenient for the staff, not the customer. \n\nFood. I'll never review a place I haven't been to at least 3 times and in the case of Plow it's 6+. The star of this place is the lemon ricotta pancakes. They are as good as other reviews have said. If lemon ricotta pancakes are your thing or even if they are not - give these a try at least once. Those pancakes are the only thing that brings me back to this place. The rest of the food appears fresh and is good, but can also be inconsistent. Bacon has been overcooked on more than one visit(leaving it on the dry side) and potatoes have gone from crisp on the outside, steamy good on the inside one visit to a greasy soggy mess on another. Sandwiches have been good.  The guys in the kitchen are hustling and doing a good job of getting dishes out, just need to focus on the consistency part. \n\nAmbiance. Plow is a cute clean place on the outer edge of shops and other restaurants on its street. It has a smallish indoor dining area and a handful of tables along the outside of the restaurant. They also have a counter space where you can see most of what's going on in the kitchen. The seating outside is plagued with people waiting, watching you eat while they suffer thru that long wait. Not uncommon to have 15 - 20 people milling around outside this place.  Lastly, it can get cold outside(most time you are in a shade), they offer blankets for folks sitting down to eat at the outside tables.  \n\nRecommendation. The place gets busy busy busy. If you don't mind waiting for an hour plus then line up, if you don't, then try to visit during the week(tho still busy) for those pancakes and see if they measure up. Or try coming by yourself and see if you can score a single seat at the counter quicker(this has worked but not always). Lastly, if you do hate waits, this place is not for you - I've seen people get worked up and not enjoy their breakfast/lunch.", "author": "Jorge M."}

You'll always have at least an hour wait, but that is a to be expected price to pay for a enjoyable brunch experience.  Worth it.\n\nThe menu changes, and I've enjoyed many items over the years, but this last weekend I tried the Benedict with Smoked Salmon and my boyfriend had The Plow. The Plow contains house made sausage that is so delicious!  It has a ton of flavor and melts in your mouth.  The house potatoes are a crispy baked potato wedge that with their hot sauce and ketchup are yummy with every bite.  The Benedict doesn't over do it with the hollandaise sauce and their smoked salmon is incredible, really bringing up the level of the classic Eggs Benedict.  \n\nI typically bring friends and family that travel from other parts of the state and/or other parts of the country to this little neighborhood spot.  With constant menu changes I'm always in for a treat with my traveling guests making this a wonderful regular location even for a lifelong local.  \n\nMimosas are always a nice touch to brunch, however, not bottomless, so don't indulge too much! \n\nxox", "author": "Mik B."}

Everyone told me this place was gangbusters, and the long line I saw outside seemed to confirm it was worth waiting for. \n\nLet me tell you: it wasn't. I live in Potrero Hill and I will still never be back. The best thing I can say about this place is that the hosts and hostesses are very, very nice about managing the very, very long wait. \n\nThe food is forgettable, except for bad things: the much-ballyhooed lemon ricotta pancakes taste like soured lemon square dessert with a strangely unwelcome doughiness to it. If you want lemon square dessert for breakfast, save yourself the hassle of the wait and go buy lemon squares. They will taste better.\n\nThe egg sandwich was the greasiest thing I have ever had. I LOVE a good breakfast sandwich and have never been so completely, utterly disappointed. I was unable to finish it as I began to feel queasy halfway through from all the butter that was making my hands shiny. I saw someone refer to it as \"Southern\" in another review. I used to live in Louisiana, and let me tell you, there was nothing Southern about this oily, sickening monstrosity.\n\nThe potatoes were fine. They tasted like I expect breakfast potatoes to taste. All of you who think they are God's gift to breakfast potatoes, where do you normally dine? Because anyone operating a restaurant ought to be able to produce a decent breakfast potato exactly like these very normal breakfast potatoes. It's a pretty basic side item.\n\nThere is a stunning dearth of restaurants with nice atmosphere in San Francisco, particularly given the upscale clientele and general quirkiness of the place. Plow is a nice place to sit - and easy to talk, especially when your table is next to a couple where the girl is taking selfies on her phone the whole time and not saying a world to her boyfriend who works on his laptop the whole time. And if you don't mind the sensation of knowing that there is a crowd of people waiting for you to hurry up and get out.\n\nI'm glad that Plow is doing well as maybe more brunch places with thoughtful decor will appear.

However, the meal was worth the trouble!\n\nWe arrived around 9:30 on a Tuesday and it was much busier than I expected. Fortunately not busy enough that we had to wait because thankfully, there were two seats available at the bar. Some helpful notes: they will not seat you unless your entire party is present. Even if it is just one other person. No exceptions. Also, there's only 6-7 seats at the bar and roughly seven tables (very small space). There are a couple tables for outside dining as well.\n\nOwner/Chef Maxine Siu was directly in front of us busily preparing dishes in their small partially-open kitchen. She was careful not to make eye contact with any patrons. Totally understandable, but it would have been so much fun to talk food. \n\nRuben started with a cup of Equator Coffee ($3.50) and we shared a Cinnamon Brioche ($4).

I love the crispy, herby tastes and it was not overly salty either.\n[+] Chicken-apple sausages (4 links) were very enjoyable and did not taste overcooked from the \"recooking\"\n[+/-] Eggs are made to your liking\n\nCORNED BEEF HASH ($15)\n[-] Yes, it comes with potatoes but it is NOT their signature crispy, herby goodness!

We made a reservation for 5 ahead of time, so I'm not too sure on the wait, but if you did make a reservation, make sure your entire party is there or they won't seat you! (They usually have a long line, I've heard.) The inside is a bit smaller, but not crowded at all, but we just preferred outdoor seating. We got the \"Plow\" plate (look for \"Plow\" on the menu), which was apparently one of the most popular, and so glad we got it! It came with a little bit of everything, including apple sausages, eggs, potatoes, and lemon ricotta pancakes. I am a huge fan of their potatoes, sausages, and above all, their lemon ricotta pancakes! Usually the lemon/ricotta flavor is subtle and I can barely taste it, but Plow did a great job in making a flavorful pancake with amazing hot fried potatoes that filled me up! The waiters were also super friendly and attentive, which made me love the place more. If you love brunch, you have to try this place out!", "author": "Hana C."}

I was initially feeling miserable as I saw my fiends sitting outside, the wind had been picking up and the sun was nowhere close to touching my skin. One of the waitress offered us blankets and it was very much needed. I see this a  sign of paying attention to the needs of customers and their satisfaction. I don't think I would have been able to enjoy my meal if that blanket wasn't a part of the equation. \n\nThe waitress was very patient as my friend and I caught up after almost three years apart. I ordered \"The Plow\" and it had all the makings of a good breakfast. The potatoes were amazing and just right. There was a great balance between the starch and crisp layer. We topped the order off with a biscuit and to be honest that would have been it for me with some coffee or tea. The honey butter is a great addition and melted makes it even better. The biscuit doesn't look like a biscuit but once you bite into it all those thoughts escape you. \n\nI look forward to going back, I hear that you have to go early.

Yesterday morning though, we both woke up early and decided to try our luck.  Parking was pretty easy as we got a space across the street. We arrived about 5 minutes or so after opening and got seated at the last table, which we shared with a couple that got in right before us.  Of course I was afraid that it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but it did!  7x7 released a few months ago the recipe for Plow's lemon ricotta pancakes and I took a stab at making them.  So, naturally I had to get The Plow ($16) & he instantly gravitated towards the Dungeness crab scramble ($17).  The waitress was coming around asking if we wanted coffee with her big pitcher.  Bf said yes and I declined since I'm so picky with coffee.  However, he (usually drinks black) and I (usually gets vanilla lattes and macchiatos) thought the coffee was quite good even with just a little bit of sugar, it was pretty mild.  The coffee was Equator.  \n\nThe Plow is two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, house potatoes and your choice of bacon, housemade pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage.  I chose to get the pork sausage.  I was so excited when our plates were finally in front of us.  His crab scramble was plentiful too and had a lot of fresh crab in it.  The creme fraiche was the perfect addition for the scramble.  He loved the house potatoes which was served with his meal too.  The toast it was served with was standard though.  As for my Plow: The eggs, which I chose over easy were perfectly cooked and the yolk just oozed all over once punctured.  The house potatoes were so crispy.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were fluffy, moist, and lemony; they were to die for.  The only thing that killed the breakfast was the sausage.  We were surprised that they were made into patties, and it did have some nice seasoning but they were so dry.  We had to dip the pieces into the egg yolk or pour syrup on them.  Perhaps they didn't put any fat in it and that's why it was so dry?  The dry sausage was really the only thing that killed the breakfast and prevented us from deeming Plow a 5 star breakfast.  \n\nOkay, I think even by SF standards the dishes are a little pricey for breakfast, but they're so worth it.  I'm gonna say a little gripe though, what I don't get is that, they offer free cups of coffee (refills too) for those stuck waiting for a table outside, but will ask around patrons dining if they'd like a cup...thought it may have been free, but was surprised to see the $3.50 charge on the receipt.  Bf was more optimistic than me though (even though he paid) and said, \"Well at least they kept filling me up.  Not all places give free refills.\"  Plow is a solid 4.5 stars.  I can't wait to come back for more lemon ricotta pancakes and house potatoes!", "author": "Cat C."}

While that hasn't really changed since then, they're going to have to make some room at the top of my brunch list for Plow.  MBC is still great and all, but it's kinda like when a kid gets a little brother or sister - still loved, just that there's someone else now to share the spotlight with.\n\nAfter my friend's brother raved about the food at Plow, my friend and I decided to come by on a Saturday morning to check them out.  He had warned us that there there was usually a long wait on weekends, so we were fully prepared with the possibility of not getting seated for a while.  However, when we put our names down, we were pleasantly surprised that was only going to take about 20 minutes to get a table.  Sweet!\n\nAlthough there were several dishes on their menu that I wanted to try (particularly \"The Plow\"), I ordered the Duck Hash with Poached Eggs so that I could compare it to the one I had at MBC.  Now unfortunately, I forgot to take a picture of my dish, but trust me when I say it looked so good when it was brought out.  And like the one I had at MBC, this one tasted just as good as it looked.  The hash had a lot of duck flavor, but not to the point where it was overpowering everything else on the plate.  It was especially impressive given that there wasn't a ton of duck meat (there was still enough to keep me happy though).  And what can I say about poached eggs?  Aren't they always good, especially when they're runny?  Yum.\n\nWhile I'm reluctant to say that the food at Plow is better than MBC (or vice versa, for that matter), they definitely win out in one important category - parking.  It was such a breeze getting a space.  Even though the drive here was a little longer, being able to drive up and park within a block without circling made it well worth it.  For that reason, I'd be slightly more inclined to come back to Plow than MBC, but I'm still going to show equal love to two of my favorites.", "author": "Mike L."}

We went there on New Year's Eve for breakfast and the wait was over an hour and a half.  I was starving and freezing by the time we got seated - outside.  Seriously, it was no higher than maybe 50-55 degrees and we were sitting outside.  Not pleasant.  I would advise them to stop seating people outside and just do indoor seating, but there is a very small dining room so that would not work.  It was not pleasant.  The seats were cold and not comfortable.  Plus, the seat we ended up sitting in was vacant for 20-30 minutes before we finally got seated.  What were they waiting for?  \n\nFor breakfast, I ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  They were bland and overly sweet all at the same time.  I know that Plow focuses on natural ingredients, but the lemon tasted very artificial.  I know it wasn't, but it tasted that way.  I found the pancake consistency to be very heavy and dense.  I couldn't finish the 2nd of 3 pancakes, although this was mostly due to taste.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back is that our bill was $40 - for breakfast.  When you're not ordering meat, you shouldn't expect to pay that much for breakfast.  I was not impressed at all.  Perhaps I caught them on a bad day, when it was really busy, and the kitchen was rushing to get food out, but this was not the experience I heard all my fellow yelpers raving about.  I feel like I got cheated.  \n\nMy advice is that if the line looks long - go somewhere else.

Without going into great detail, Ive done things in this area that helped the community, before this restaurant even existed.  I came here with my family, including two kids, and was given a wait time of 20 minutes.  I peeked at the sheet, because I don't want to get bamboozled, and noticed there were 4 parties ahead of me with 2 people for each party.  As I was waiting outside, I overhear the employee taking names talking on her phone telling the other person on the line to come to the restaurant now.  Now 20 minutes has gone by and all the parties above listed get their tables.  Out of nowhere, a group of 5 show up and magically get seated before us.  Keep in mind they did not have two hungry kids with them.  I kindly ask the employee how much longer is the wait and she responds by telling me it'll be another 5-10 minutes.  I questioned her about the party of 5, who weren't on the sign in sheet when I initially signed in, and her \"defensive response\" was how do you know they weren't ahead of you?  I told her I saw the list as she penciled my name on it and it did not reflect that party of 5.  She asked how long was I waiting and I told her over 25 minutes.  She responded to me and said, \"This is a restaurant, what do you expect?\"  \nIn my opinion, this is clearly an inexperienced person who needs to learn how to talk to customers.  Not once did I yell or make a scene in front of other customers.  I kindly told her we are leaving.  She responded by telling me if we wait she is saving the front table near the door for us.  I told her that this is the second time this happened to us where she seated people ahead of us and I didn't appreciate that.  I asked for her name and the manager.  She identified herself as Jess and she was the manager.  I again told her I'm not angry, but just disappointed on how we were handled and treated by her.  I may look like I'm 20, but I'm really in my late 30s, definitely older and more experienced with customers than her, based on our incident.  Don't get me wrong, the food here delivers, but they really need customer service training.  After reading a few reviews, it seems like this happened more than once.

Even the sausage, which I don't usually care for, was delicious. And the lemon ricotta pancake brought it all home with a nice sweetness to round out the rest of the savory meal.\n\nThe wait wasn't too bad for two people, either: 30 minutes. Bring a book and park yourself under the many shady trees to while away the time before your name is called.\n\nThe only disadvantage of this place is that it's a bit out of the way...a 38 minute walk from my place, and 30 with public transport (who else hates SF public transport?!), but it's completely worth it.", "author": "Neha S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-07-04", "description": "Arriving on a sunny, windy weekday afternoon, we entered Plow at around 1pm. The restaurant had quite a number of people, so we were kicked to curb, to wait in the wind. By kicking us to the curb, I mean they told us to step outside to wait till we're seated because they don't want it cramping up by the entrance. I like this idea because it makes the dining experience more enjoyable. They told us to wait about 5 mins, but we were seated within 3 mins. \n\nLocated on the corner of Mississippi St and Texas St, this place can easily be missed..only because it's located in a residential area. They do have a sign sticking out that says \"The Plow\" though. Parking wasn't bad for my friend and I because we found one quick, right across the street. \n\nSeated in the back, service was still prompt and good because they would come check on us quite often. The food came out fairly quick in about 10 minutes. For my drink, I ordered the housemade strawberry lemonade ($3.75) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#N3EwXeV_dXhdgR037ddEUw]. The drink looks adorable and instagram-worthy with its cute striped straw and lemon on the side, but don't let that fool you! I like the looks of it, but the straw is made of paper which can make it soggy. That's the only thing that irks me because the longer it sits in the lemonade, the faster it becomes soggy and the harder it becomes to drink. \n\nFor my dish, I ordered The Plow ($16) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#NYJXSTwF-Ugv0vFpKULyvQ] and a side of Nueske Bacon ($5.50) [http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/plow-san-francisco?select=idHQVocGRxfnUjULoUkgDA#fzy-q83TFoTe12n157Wu4Q]. The Plow was delicious! It consisted of  (2) small Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, Crispy Potatoes, Eggs, and House made pork sausage patties. I ordered this becuase it basically consisted of everything from the highlights on the Yelp page! I highly recommend ordering this for your first time because you get a taste of everything. Going from the lemon ricotta pancakes to crispy potatoes, to eggs and the house made pork sausage patties, everything just tasted so different from each other and unique! It changes your taste buds! \n\nThe side of nueske bacon was a recommended dish in the highlights and as a fan of bacon, I just haaad to order it! I don't think it was all that special, but it was decently good. It was also pretty oily. \n\nIf you can't finish your meal and plan to take the leftovers home, skip the crispy potatoes...it won't taste crispy anymore, haha. \n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience and would definitely come back again..on a weekday! ;)", "author": "Mandy G."}

But.... \n\n...This place has cracked the code on the country potatoes that accompanies most breakfast entrees. 99% of the time, these potatoes are just fillers to make sure you hit that 'brunch food coma' no matter the size of your main entree. The potatoes here are totally worth eating. I ate every molecule while only taking a couple of bites at other joints before giving up. Lots of crunchy edges here and minimal soft starchy centers. It both satisfies the country potatoes part of the brain as well as the FRENCH FRY loving part of the brain. These puppies must be deep fried here (and I love it). Just like the egg sandwich, so simple, yet no one else pulls it off like Plow. The abundance of rosemary is the icing on the cake. This herb is so cheap, wonder why more people don't use it liberally. It grows like weeds 365 days in most CA backyards.\n\nWaitress #1 warned me the egg sandwich might explode. I bit in to it, and indeed it popped, covering my hand and watch with egg yoke porn. It's a miracle the kid at the next table didn't lose an eye. Waitress #2 saw this, went inside, wet a towel (with warm water) and brought it to my table. Excellent service! Even better, I went for lunch on a weekday and had zero wait.

My friends raved about this place so I was pretty excited to finally try it. We ordered the proscuitto toast and the plow (one with bacon and one with chicken sausage). My order was the plow with bacon and it very tasty! The pancakes were light and fluffy, the potatoes were crispy on the outside and seasoned well. If I were to rate this restaurant on food alone, I would have definitely given this place a 5/5! It was actually the service that was less that subpar. ):\n\nI don't know if I went on a bad day but the service my party and I received was one of the worst and I wish I had spoken to the manager or someone about it. \n1) The server accidentally gave us the wrong food (two plows both with chicken sausage, no mention of a third plate coming either); it was supposed to be for the party of two in the adjacent table. No big deal, mix-ups happen. We gave them their food and they flagged down the server to let them know they had made a mistake. The server looked at us angrily like we had made the mistake and then rushed to the back. \n2) The server came back to let us know that we had ordered the same thing. I asked to confirm if mine had bacon, because that's what I had ordered. She rudely replied \"your food is coming soon\" and left without confirming what I had ordered. She could have just said yes and left it at that??? I didn't ask how long my food was taking, nor did I care about how long it would take... \n3) During the meal, our server did not check on us (or anyone for that matter) to see if we needed water or anything, not even once throughout the meal. \n4) When our server came by the tables I asked her \"excuse me, may I please have the check?\" She ignored me and continued to scan the tables in the area without approaching any of them. I thought that she didn't hear me so I repeated myself several more times until I got her attention. She gave me a dirty look and went to get our bill.\n5) When my friend got her card back with the receipt, the server threw the pen next to her instead of handing it to her along with her card. \n\nYou could've just said you didn't want to be tipped instead of treating us poorly? But you do you... We tipped her out of courtesy but it felt wrong because the service was nonexistent /: \n\nThe guy giving us condiments was totally coo tho. \n\nAnyways, I would go back cause the food was bomb but definitely not anytime soon because of this experience lol maybe next time will be better???

We seemed to have come in right before they opened the outside dining, which was cool because that shortened the wait significantly.

The pancakes people rave about is just ok. Seriously. If I didn't know it was ricotta in there, I'd think it was under cooked.  I still have my doubts on the full-cooked-ness of these pancakes. Outside was crispy, inside was goopy. \n\nThe rest of the food was pretty solid. I like that they don't shy away from making the scrambled eggs JUST done.

Both dishes were made on a gigantic piece of acme toast, which to be honest I wasn't a big fan of, but my friend was overjoyed so it's probably a matter of preference. We substituted potatoes for a side salad and it was quite a refreshing and crisp salad, a very good call on our part. The prosciutto on the toast was incredibly fresh and the chili garlic garnish on the egg really brought the whole taste together. The French toast on the other hand, I wasn't blown away by. Again it might be a matter of preference but I was a bit bothered by the thickness of the toast because the inside remained soggy from the batter.

I would put this up against any of the Eater SF contenders.

I understand they don't take reservations and of course we were happy to wait. We were 4 latinos guys excited and hungry to eat there. We put our name in the waiting lists for 4. There were only 4 ladies waiting outside before us since was a day during the week plus we planed to be there before the crowd. The 4 ladies got sat down of course before us. Then there was more people coming and getting sitting down before us. I came in and asked and they said because they were less than 4, I understood that. Then there were groups of 3 and 4 coming and getting sitting down before us again. After more than one hour waiting and starving, I ask the hostess ( an Asian lady) what was going on, then she said that we still have to wait cuz we were 4. We told her we saw groups of 3 and 4 getting a table before us even then came way after us and all she said is that they were in the list before us! Which it was a huge lie since I put my name on the list and I saw their names scratched off and we never got called. I felt discriminated and we promised not to come back again to that place no matter how good food is there. There's tons of more good choices all over the beautiful SF. We all work for the restaurant industry and that's NOT how it works. They lost 4 immediate customers plus some more after we shared our discriminatory experience.

But since all my Yelpy friends said it was worth the wait, I was very excited that the wait was really only about 35 minutes.\n\nSitting at the marble? counter is an excellent experience.  The 3 guys pumping out the brunch menu for 40+ occupants really know what they're doing.  It's fascinating watch them make the eggs, fry the potatoes, cook the lemon ricotta pancakes, and dole out all the other goodies in very organized and efficient fashion.\n\nTasty mimosa, tasty coffee.  I have to say, the lemon ricotta pancakes really were not my favorite.  I did appreciate that they were crispy-edged pancakes and the lemony flavor was spot on.. but I didn't quite like the ricotta texture in my otherwise fluffy pancakes.  I didn't feel like the cheese added anything... but then again, I'm lactose intolerant and don't really enjoy cheese anymore...\n\nLOVE the potatoes.  Super fried and delicious!  Seasoned perfectly.  The bacon was tasty but not memorable.  I tried Ingrid C's pork sausage and that was flavory herby goodness.\n\nDefinitely worth the wait.  There are plenty of cute shops to browse around including a bookstore about a block away.\n\nMy favorite brunch is still St. Mike's in Palo Alto, but this is pretty damn tasty if you're up in the city.\n\nExtra bonus love to all the piggy figurines and piggy symbol as the restaurant mascot.", "author": "Ruth C."}

In fact I have never given a negative review to anyone. I am a business owner in a highly competitive environment with a big emphasis on customer service. I know the challenges involved in dealing with the general public. It can be very demanding. \n\nThe plow does a really good breakfast sandwich. It is pricey but I enjoy it.\n\nBecause of my busy schedule I always order to go. This morning I ordered my sandwich en route.  When I arrived at the restaurant I noticed it was not as busy as usual so I politely asked the waitress if I could eat my to-go order at the restaurant and requested a seat outside. The waitress was gracious and asked me to wait while she asked the chef if that was ok?\n\nThe Plow has an open kitchen so I was standing approximately 10 feet from the conversation the waitress was having with the chef. Based on the facial expressions and body language of the chef she seemed troubled and reluctant to permit my request. I was put off by what I was witnessing but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because I could not hear what was being said and I could easily have been reading the situation wrong. \n\nAll seemed fine but as the waitress escorted me to a seat at the counter she said something to me that I did not hear. She placed my plate on the counter top and I asked her to repeat what she had said. \nShe said \"just want to let you know that we cannot do this again. This is the only time\". I was very surprised and felt like I had just been reprimanded. I asked for an explanation and I was told that the to-go box cost extra!!!  \"Are you kidding me!?\"\n\nI was not happy. If I had not witnessed the chefs reaction to my request I may not have been so annoyed. The waitress pleaded with me to sit down and explained that the box had been thrown away. I told her to get another box and to charge me for both. \n\nWhy didn't the waitress inform me that it was not a problem to seat me but there would be an extra charge for the paper box? Don't take me to a seat ignoring my request for outside seating and warn me as if I had done something wrong.  \n\nMy thoughts are the manager or chef needs to pay attention to the fact that she is being observed and she should show a little appreciation for her customers. Maybe she is over worked or maybe she just doesn't care? Maybe she might act differently if she was trying to start a business rather than running what outwardly looks like a successful one.\n\nWhen I go to a place to eat I want to be treated with a modicum of respect.

I did ask for my eggs to be cooked hard btw. The potatoes had an interested flavor that I think I liked but I couldn't tell because all i was served was a plate of potatoes skins. The pancakes...

My friend got it with the pork sausage and I got it with the chicken sausage, which are like meat patties and not the hot dog shaped ones. The chicken sausages were extremely dry and a little hard to swallow. The lemon ricotta pancakes were not fluffy whatsoever, which is how you imagine ricotta pancakes, but were somewhat hard. The flavor was good tho. My scrambled eggs were good and my friend enjoyed the poached eggs. The highlight were the potatoes. So crispy, perfectly seasoned, and full of rosemary flavor. My friend doesn't like rosemary too much so she wasn't fond of them, but I lovedddd em.\n\nOur coffees were never refilled and had to ask twice before it was.

Their gluten free pancakes or crispy potatoes or waffles or scrambled eggs - whatever it is, there is nothing like it elsewhere. They have distinguished themselves in a very big way when it comes to food, so everything else is secondary. For me, there has never been a chance to ever notice the service (although luckily it has been good for me whenever I have been here). There has never been a chance to ever notice the long line which can be pretty long (Read: might have to wait for an hour or more sometimes).\n\nI have been among that fan following where I would wake up at 6.30 am on a weekend, quickly drive to this place and wait in the queue; then feel highly accomplished for being one of the first few ones who quickly got a table for my hard work (waiting in the queue lol!). People who live in SF and who love good food know how amazing it is to be able to eat at this restaurant - it is THAT good! \n\nI have not found many restaurants who take the trouble to make gluten free stuff, much less gluten-free pancakes. Whatever I found at other restaurants scream this at the top of their lungs: \"Here it is! We took some corn/rice/quinoa/or whatever you call it 'gluten free' flour, dumped some milk, sugar, butter, oil and eggs in it. To give it some flavor as a favor to you, we will add a tiny bitsy drop of some fake vanilla essence like we are lazying around in the park on a bright sunny day; then throw this mess of a vanilla smelling concoction on a pan and v.o.i.l.a. there you go! See, we told you we have it in the menu!\" \n\nPlow is one of the very few restaurants who takes gluten free seriously and so well! Their gluten free pancakes with almond flour tastes like one jolly best stuff in the world! Keep it up Plow! Never stop making those pancakes ever ever!", "author": "Sun B."}

Heard about this place from friends so I'm glad I got to stop by as I was visiting from out of town. We got there around noon on a Sunday and of course, the corner was bustling with people waiting for a table. I can't believe we waited almost two hours to get seated, but I'm proud of us for making it through alive. The moment when your name does get called makes you feel like you've just won the lottery, it's great. We got a table outside which was fine because as other reviewers have said, they provide blankets. The outdoor seating can get a bit awkward with hungry folks staring at you and your food, the likelihood increasing exponentially the closer you are to the main door (which we were right beside). The indoor area is a bit small, but love the decor and atmosphere.  \n\nMaybe it was the hunger (or hanger), but I thought the coffee was really good. My friend had the plow while I had the dungeness crab scramble. The food here did not disappoint. The scramble was really good but it seemed to be a bit watery/mushy? Tried friend's pancakes and they were also good, not too flour-y. Definitely pretty heavy on the lemon, whether you are or aren't into that. Seemed like a lot of folks dining around us were substituting in almond flour pancakes. I also couldn't stop eyeing all the egg sandwiches that were being carried out of the kitchen!

Being from DC, I was kind of disappointed with the SF brunch scene but Plow definitely changed that. Yes, the wait is long and kind of annoying depending on when you go, but it's worth it, and definitely better than some other touristy brunch places (looking at you Mama's). Plow is in Portrero Hill, a mostly residential neighborhood and there are some cute stores, restaurants, bookshops around the block that you can check out while you wait. \nI decided to get the Plow as it has a little bit of everything - eggs your way, choice of pork/chicken sausage or bacon, two lemon ricotta pancakes, and crispy potatoes. Come hungry! The crispy potatoes are seriously the best - absolutely MUST HAVE. The lemon ricotta pancakes were really good too. I had my eggs poached and the chicken sausage, both of which were good. Although, the potatoes really stole the show! The fresh orange juice was delicious. We were seated outside and it was cute to watch people walk up and down the hill as we enjoyed our huge brunch. It's dog friendly which is nice. A bit more expensive than other places, good food, and friendly service except for the long wait. Will go back for the crispy potatoes!", "author": "Jaya P."}

I got the Plow breakfast (hey-- when in Rome, right?) which came with two eggs (over-easy for me), 4 things of chicken apple sausage, 2 lemon ricotta pancakes (yes! and yes!), and a big hoppin' load of crispy potato chunks (it's a bit ginger-y, so be advised). Oh-- and a cup of Equator coffee to wash it all down. I loved The Plow (get yer mind outta the gutter...lol). I believe the gal pal loved her pancakes too. I only wish my lemon ricotta pancakes had some blueberry compote (sp?) like the ones in the regular lemon ricotta pancake entree.

Being in close proximity to her work, I decided to take her on Saturday before she began her shift. Everyone knows you'd better be prepared to wait over an hour for a seat at any brunch spot in San Francisco; and Plow was no exception. To our surprise, our expected hour and a half turned into only 50 minutes! We were seated at the counter facing the open-aired kitchen. Plow is extremely homey. From the wooden decor to the spices stored in mason jars, I already knew I was going to like what I ordered. \n\nMy mom and I both got coffee to start the meal. If I didn't drive, I definitely would have tried the Bloody Beer. But their coffee was great! My mom even said, \"This is the best coffee I've had from any of the brunch spots you've taken me.\" It's hard to please my mom, especially when it comes to her coffee! \n\nBut onto the food... between the both of us, we ordered two dishes.\n\nMy mom chose the soft scrambled eggs with oyster mushrooms, spinach and cheddar accommodated with potatoes and toast. I never knew eggs can be that light, fluffy and divine! I absolutely love eggs, but this made me fall in LOVE with them even more. Oyster mushrooms have a really \"meaty\" quality to them, so I didn't miss that there was no carnivorous protein on the plate (besides the egg). \n.\nI decided to go with the Plow (2 ricotta lemon pancakes, eggs, house made sausages and potatoes). I had a small issue with my pancakes because they were a bit underdone in the center. The taste though... a punch of lemon-y goodness balanced with ricotta cheese! As for the house made sausage, the flavors again punched me in the face and left me in awe. It was unfortunately a bit on the drier side for my liking. \n\nBut the key to this delicious meal lies in the potatoes... It doesn't make sense! Crispy goodness from the start to finish of meal. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the potato. Plow has to be seasoning their potatoes with something, because I ate every bite possible off my plate and then my mom's plate!\n\nYou definitely need to give Plow a try if you have any interest in brunch foods.

It was the perfect amount of food for someone who has been waiting for a table for 1 hour! It was also delicious. The crispy potatoes were mixed with onions and both were extra crispy. These are probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had! The lemon ricotta pancakes were of course delicious as well.

Why ungodly? Coming from Berkeley, we knew we had to get up, at the latest, by 06AM in order to make the commute via BART to Plow. You bet I would have been disappointed if this brunch wasn't any good. \n\nSadly .. we still didn't make it by 08, hahaha (although to be fair, I was taking a little longer than I needed to get ready). We arrived around 8:45AM probably, and were told it would be a 45-60 min wait for two. There's not much to do around this neighborhood while you wait, sadly. You could walk a few blocks more to meet a freeway overpass (a little scary). There were a few shops around the area, but they were closed since it it was pretty early still. I think you get free coffee inside as you wait (I didn't get it myself .. because I didn't see it until we were already seated..).\n\nWe got our seats after about an hour, right at the counter. Pretty cool to watch the chefs pump out Plows like clockwork. It made waiting for our food not as bad! \n\nBF and I ordered:\n\n+ The Plow (of course): the bacon was good, the potatoes were good, and the eggs (we got them poached) were also good, but the real winner (to me) was the lemon ricotta pancakes!!! \n+ Dungeness Crab Scramble: so happy this was on the menu on this visit :) I never imagined mixing crab with eggs, but it worked so well! I loved it. Also came with the potatoes, which I was really happy about because they were well-seasoned, and muy yummy :) \n\n\nService was fast and efficient as it could be. \nParking on the street, didn't look like it would be too hard to find, at least on a Sat morning. \nRestaurant is tiny, so yes, if you don't want to wait.. getting here early is important.", "author": "Ashley N."}

I went back at least 4-5 times to talk to them, each time being quoted a longer time than the one before... once 2 hours rolled around and a 4 top was being dissected into 2(for some reason) we had had enough... my gf believes that people that they may have known(regulars, who knows) were being seated before us... I don't know about that but the overall attitude seemed to be \"oh well bro\"... the same hostess who seemed to have an attitude originally, said \"if I had known(you would have been like this) I would have just told you 2 and half hours\"... welp, like I said I'm in the business and I'm sorry but that IS what you do... under-promise and over-deliver... but, of course, if people will wait that long to eat there and still give them 5 stars then they probably don't give af what I think!

I had the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon. It was a very generous portion with a side of perfectly crispy potatoes. My friends and I also shared an order of the lemon ricotta pancakes.

I am always a fan when a restaurant knows they have long lines for tables and offer coffee or drinks while you wait to help pass the time more pleasantly.  I saw some folks starting up with mimosas before their tables were ready - that's the spirit! It is brunch after all...\n\nD\u00e9cor is simple, clean, and as open as it can be for the modest sized restaurant.

My party opted for eggs benedict with ham and I selected gluten free pancakes with a side of bacon.  I must say, the star of our plates were their breakfast potatoes! Are those rolled in crack?  I am just sayin' if any restaurant wants to know how to properly cook a breakfast potato they should take a lesson because Plow's are AMAZING!  The seasoning is delicious, not spicy but flavorful that goes deep into the hearty potato wedges.  Once rolled in their seasoning, I assume, the spuds are deep fried for a golden, crispy skin that keeps the potato soft and delicious inside.  My mouth is watering as I write this review thinking about the potatoes.  I am lucky my breakfast buddy shared because my pancakes came solo.  I would put those spuds on all plates, everyone deserves to have them!\n\nMy pancakes were so light and fluffy it was perfect.  I have tried a lot of GF pancakes, but these were delicious with a little sweetness to them without any syrup.  I did use my syrup sparingly, but they don't even need it.  Excellent texture and flavor for even a regular pancake.  Even my non-GF friend enjoyed the pancakes.\n\nI cannot attest to the eggs benedict other than I am told the sauce was a little lemony on the initial hit to the palette but didn't finish with that flavor, so it was complex enough to be interesting and enjoyable without being smacked by lemon.\n\nOverall, if you have time to kill, I suggest making it happen because it is a beautiful neighborhood, there is good coffee while you wait, and people watching is at your disposal.  After a morning run or sleeping in it is a good way to start the day.", "author": "Mandy L."}

Although you will probably have a very long line for weekend brunch, it's absolutely worth it. The space is small so I would suggest going with a small group of people.\n\nMy boyfriend and I headed over to Plow a bit late on a Sunday. We got there at 1pm and were told that we were just about borderline on whether we would get in before it closed or not. But, after 35min, we had a place at the bar, overlooking a chef's kitchen. We marveled at the organization that Chef Maxine had in her kitchen. People owned their stations and passed plates around with amazing speed. Granted, they have a few kinks to work out, but hey, they have only been open a week. No doubt they will get there very soon. But the speed and efficiency with which they work through their constant steam of orders is pretty amazing. \n\nBy the time we got there, they were out of a lot of things. Lucky for us, the things that we wanted were still available. The boy had a pulled pork sandwich and I had the egg sandwich to which I added bacon. Greatest decision ever. Together, the bill was just under $22. And both were fantastic. I can't speak for the pulled pork, because it was gone before I had a chance to ask for a bit. So I assume that it was delicious. The egg sandwich was one of the best I have ever had. I know it's just an egg sandwich but the ingredients blended together perfectly. The egg was done over easy and the yoke was the perfect gooey-ness. Together with the greens, cheese and aoli, it was amazing. \n\nAnd of course, the potatoes. Just about every non-french toast or pancake dish comes with potatoes. And they are fantastic. Amazing. The waiter brought us ketchup and hot sauce but it would have been a total waste to use them. The potatoes stood on their own. I love a place where condiments are a waste of table space. \n\nOn top of all of this, the service was great. Friendly and professional, they keep customers happy while running the restaurant as well. With the fast paced floor that they manage, they still had time to laugh and make jokes with us. Even the chef, as exhausted as she was, came to chat with us for 2min in between orders. And at the very end, when they caught us talking about the lemon cake that was on the counter, they gave us a complimentary taste. It's that kind of service that wins the hearts of a neighborhood. \n\nAll in all, I think Potrero Hill has a new gem. I can't wait to go back.", "author": "Mariko F."}

Lacking sleep already and a night of turkey I needed something to bring a good morning 'ring' to my day as I was tired, and mediocre was not going to do, thankfully I have a cousin who knows about food, and still remembering from years before on how she took me to places, I could put my faith in her to deliver.\n\nShe said that this place usually has line-ups going up the block (as this place is located on a hill), so to get here early, we arrived at 8 AM, the place was not empty, but it wasn't packed, probably being a holiday. It was a charming little place with real high ceilings, very bright white walls, defined by natural wood tables. It's a very happy, bright look, with the open kitchen concept that seems standard nowadays with new restaurants.\n\nOnce we sat down, we were presented the menu, and looking at that pageful of items to order, the problem was to decide on what to order. From pancakes, eggs, bacon, granola, sandwiches and salads, everything looked so good. My cousin and her husband had 'the Plow' which consists of two eggs, two pancakes, and they decided on the Nueske bacon. My partner ordered the lemon ricotta pancakes and I decided on the corned beef hash with yukon gold potatoes, chillies, and two eggs. As it wasn't that busy when we were here, the orders came quite quickly.\n\nSpeaking on my dish of hash browns, this was pefectly done, little bits of pefectly cooked potatoes mixed with strands of corned beef, and this was the stuff on the bottom of the plate. You could taste the freshness of the ingredients mixed with some chili to provide a kick, this was under the two sunny side eggs that were laid on top of the hash, welcoming me to breakfast like a set of eyes. Two small pieces of bread were laid on the top side of the eggs and I was ready to devour like a monster looking at this thing. My partner's pancakes were fluffy and had a good dense chew. I remember a smile everytime I took a bite, and I also remember my partners fork constantly coming over to my plate picking at little pieces of potato and meat.\n\nAnother thing that was damn good was the bacon here, whatever farmer they are getting this stuff from, it's like crack. I love the look that my partner had when she took a bite. One of those breakfast joints that if I was to be back in San Francisco I would check it out.

We arrived at 9 AM and were met with a one-hour wait, which we never tend to mind. We sat at the bar and it was fun to watch the cooks prepare the orders (also a good way to decide on different menu items because you can see them being prepared).\n\nWe got the Plow, which is their breakfast plate. It includes two eggs, two lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes, and choice of meat. The pancakes were an absolute standout. My husband is the meat eater between the two of us and said the house-made pork sausage patty was delightful. We also shared a biscuit with honey butter and enjoyed it immensely!\n\nBe aware that the menu items were pricey. We paid $4.50 for the biscuit, which felt high (especially compared to other restaurants where we typically get a biscuit on the side). Would highly recommend and would go back!", "author": "Roxanne S."}

Don't be ashamed to order yourself two dishes. You earned it by walking up and down the hill 20 times before being seated.\n\nLast time I went here, the next door building caught on fire--presumably an act of arson by a starving patron trying to cook their own sausages in the street.

Coming to Plow and not ordering those crispy potatoes is like going to Ike's and not ordering a sandwich. You just can't. Respect your body by giving it the best possible version of potatoes one could possibly eat for breakfast (permutations of dinner potatoes are a different story). I liked sitting at the bar and seeing all the work that goes into making the food.  \n\nregarding the wait: don't be intimidated. Who are you kidding? It's the 21st century, and we all have things to do while waiting.

I put my name down at 11:30am on a Saturday and was told the wait was going to be 2 hours for our party of 2. Not a problem, it was a beautiful day in SF so my brother and I killed time by taking pictures (instagrammers love those benches outside!) and making a coffee run. We got back at around 1 hour and 55 minutes after I was told \"2 hours\", but it seems we should have gotten back earlier, because our name was called multiple times already.

He gave away our table at the time we arrived. Instead of trying to accommodate us as quickly as possible, the host walked away and never helped us again. He did, unfortunately, pass off the responsibility to the other hostess. They didn't communicate the situation to her and we preceded to wait as if we were just the next table in line. He decided not to interact with us for the rest of the time. Coward! If you see him, Black guy, cool hair, no balls.\n\nTable after table, small two top tables were being sat before us.

However! They have outdoor seating on nice days, and that IS accessible, albeit requiring that one deal with the slight incline of the hill on which Plow sits.\n\nShowing up around 9am last Saturday, my friend and I were eventually seated after a ~45 minute wait. Part of this was due to having to wait for an outdoor seat though - had that not been necessary, our wait would have been about 15 minutes shorter. After perusing a fairly succinct menu, we ended up ordering the Plow, Dungeness crab scramble [ http://flic.kr/p/c2HfrY ], and an order of French toast to go.\n\nThe crab scramble wasn't bad, and most enjoyable when the scramble was eaten along with the accompanying toast. I was slightly turned off by how fishy the dish was though - while it WAS seafood, the taste was far stronger than one would expect of fresh seafood. The crispy potatoes that came as a side of that dish were pretty good though, albeit a bit too salty for my tastes. And while the French toast was just okay, the lemon ricotta pancakes that came with the Plow were easily the best part of the meal - light on both the lemon and ricotta, they reminded me somewhat of fluffy lemon cream cookies.\n\nAfter all is said and done, with tax and tip, expect the meal to come out to about $20 a person for a single entree.

And all my co-workers raved about Plow, so I figured that it was as good a time as any to give it a chance. There was still a 1-hour wait at 1pm (seriously), but the hostess told us that we would be guaranteed seating if we came back at 1:50-ish, if we weren't seated before that. So we went to Farley's on the next block for banana bread and coffee, and came back around 1:30. We got seated around 1:45.\n\nThe service was great, the food was great--the 3 of us split an order of lemon ricotta pancakes, and then we got the prosciutto sandwich, the fried egg sandwich, and the cold-smoked salmon toast. All three of us also really loved the ambiance and the lighting in the restaurant.\n\nI love smoked salmon. And this was some really good stuff. I would've loved some avocado to go with the toast rather than the weird cream cheese, but it was still pretty good. My friend's egg sandwich definitely needed a little more oomph, but she also didn't get the bacon or avocado add-ons--adding some bacon to it would've done the trick. The pancakes were fabulous. We went to MyMy's last weekend and got the lemon ricotta souffle pancakes, and while Plow does not have souffle pancakes, there was a stronger lemon flavor to their recipe, which I preferred over MyMy's.\n\nIf you have good company willing to wait with you, coming here is great.

The lemon flavor is very prominent and just a wonderful way to begin the day with some coffee.\n\nThe fried egg sandwich was a bit of a disappointment. While the Acme bread on which it was served was pretty delicious, the sandwich really only consisted of egg, cheese and frissee. Lacking in salt, it also ended up lacking in flavor.

Questionable food handling techniques. \n\nIn case you haven't already guessed, this is not another \"So, I was like, ohmygod, the lemon ricotta pancakes!\" kind of reviews. There are plenty of those already. \n\nOn my last visit, instead of sitting at a table, I sat at the counter. I was able to observe the food preparation in great detail.\n\nUnfortunately, I observed a lot of things which, once seen, can't be unseen.\n\nWorkers continuously alternated between touching surfaces of the kitchen and then raw food.  Some of the food was later cooked, which was a relief. However, some of the food was smoked fish, garnishes, or and salad greens, scooped by hand and placed on a plate.\n\nI observed a kitchen worker blow his nose, and continue working without washing his hands. Another sneezed, and served food off the stove using his hand. Another lifted his shirt and scratched his bare skin. Then he touched food. \n\nI never saw gloves used the kitchen area. That in itself is not a problem. Gloves usually lend a false sense of security, because they are not changed each time they come into contact with food. Often, workers touch all of the same contaminated surfaces with gloves, and then go on to touch food, then go back to touching equipment. An employee would have to go through thousands of glove changes each shift, for gloves to be effective.\n\nThe only way to avoid cross-contamination is to wash hands first, do only one type of food preparation, followed by another good hand washing. However, in such a small place, the workers are constantly alternating between touching all of the kitchen surfaces, and touching food. \n\nI'm knocking off only two points, even though this is a potential life-threatening food safety issue. I'm being realistic, since I think almost all restaurants do the same thing. However, in most cases, the customer doesn't see it.\n\nIf you sit at the counter, take a look at the workers, and see if you don't notice the same thing. Even if you're sitting at a table, as you walk by, see how much of this you can observe. And if you ever get food poisoning after eating there, think about what I've said. \n\nI love this restaurant. I want them to do well, and I want to come back many times. I do hope that on some future visits, I notice some major changes.  If not, I'll be calling the health department.", "author": "tout le monde a."}

Brunching at Plow is straight out of an episode from Portlandia. It's crazy and worth it, I dare say! \n\nI finally scored a table here by arriving right when it opened on a Saturday morning and willingly sitting outside with my dogs. At this point, I was willing to do anything just to try this place. Luckily, the food lived up to the hype. \n\nWhat strikes me about this place is how SIMPLE the food is. Some people might say that the food is too simple, and unimpressive. But I'm a believer that most often, simple food is harder to make than complicated food because you have to really do justice to the ingredients to make the dishes shine.\n\nAnd that's what they do best at Plow, simple food, but prepared with extraordinary care and attention to detail. We tried: \n\n-Cinnamon Brioche: deceivingly simple, but outrageously good. Reminded me of a Kouign Amann from B Patisserie\n-The Plow: the house made pork sausage was really really good\n-Fried Egg Sandwich w/ Bacon: hits all the notes - savory egg yolk, doughy bread, salty bacon, creamy aioli \n-Lemon Ricotta Pancake: good, but I've had better (Aquarius Cafe in Emeryville. R.I.P.)\n\nAnd those were my favorites, in that order. \n\nAnd possibly what's even more perplexing to me is that my favorite thing at Plow was the side crispy potatoes that come with every order. Chunky, twice-fried nuggets of potatoes that are impossibly crispy on the outside and creamy inside. The crispy side potatoes are worth a detour by themselves!  \n\nIf you can stomach the wait or manage to get there early, Plow is worth the trip!", "author": "Monelle A."}

I ordered the plow (breakfast sampler) and although my potatoes were nicely crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, everything else was just normally decent. Potatoes, eggs, small pancakes, sausage. Nothing to rave over. \n\nBut THEN, for the rest of the day, I got to re-experience my meal in the form of stomach pains and queasiness. I called my brunch friend and asked her how she was feeling and she said her stomach was hurting too! The only thing our meals had in common were the eggs. \n\nI'm sorry, if you're a brunch place and you can't make eggs without making customers sick, you've got a problem.", "author": "Hilary F."}

Fresh and locally sourced ingredients, well seasoned and well prepared, visually appealing-- the food is delicious.\n\nWhat does put a sour taste in my mouth is the service.  I live in the neighborhood and appreciate the small businesses that still predominate the area.  Given the plethora of places, a diner has the choice of where to patronize and support.  Plow has tested this power of choice on several occasions.  The first experience was when my sister came alone on the weekend around 1:30. She was told by the host that single diners could not be seated.  She then inquired about the bar and about ordering to go, but was told that neither was possible.\nShe left disappointed and puzzled by their service but assumed it was perhaps their policy on a busy weekend.\n\nAfter hearing about that experience, we were hesitant to try the restaurant but the online reviews persuaded us to at least give them a chance.  We were seated after about two hours, after receiving a call about our table being ready, and had a wonderful meal.  At the conclusion of the meal, we asked our server about their policy for solo diners and were told enthusiastically that solo diners were welcome, indicating their bar was a space that one could sit at.  And of course, takeout orders were possible.  We relayed what had been told on the previous occasion and the server insisted that it was not their policy to turn away solo diners, that they did indeed accept take out orders and that person who had given the erroneous information must not longer work there.  But in fact, as we departed from the restaurant, who did my sister see but the same person who had turned her away going into the back of the restaurant.\n\nWas this a case of discrimination for being single?   A restaurant policy to turn over as many tables as possible? Or was this a case of inconsistent training for service?  I will give them the  benefit of a doubt.  Paranoid or not, these are questions that restaurants should heed when making decisions on turning away people.  Isn't one customer just as good as two, especially if you're sitting at a stool at the bar that would otherwise remain empty?  The closing of SF's critical darling, Local's Corner should be an opportunity for businesses to reexamine their business practices and the public's perception of their business policies.  Restaurants are in the hospitality business to make people satisfied.  Diners want not just excellent food but are at the restaurant for the social experience of eating out. Plow should remember that their success depends on the satisfaction of their diners.  And this is one diner who would rather take their business elsewhere than to have to support one that only cares about the bottom line.\n\nUpdate July 2016\nPlow no longer gives you a call to let you know that your table is ready.  When the wait invariably stretches from an hour to two or more during brunch hours, it's just plain mean to your customers to have them lingering outside on the stoop!  I realize it was a courtesy call, so I guess now they're just plain rude for taking it away.", "author": "Betty T."}

I was intrigued.\n\nAbout Timing: I read about long lines so I arrived at 8am on Sunday and about a dozen people waiting so I sat right down when they opened. By 8:30 it was almost full but still no wait.\n\nI love going out for breakfast but I can prepare a better breakfast at home than I find in most restaurants. This is my breakfast dilemma. So when I read the reviews, I hoped that the food and great space would make it all worth while.\n\nThe space is impressive, clean, well-run and organized.\n\ni ordered \"the Plow\". Each part of it was good but as a combination, i wasn't impressed. Runny, fried eggs without bread? I loved the crispy potatoes but they were not ideal for sopping up eggs. The ricotta pancakes were great. The pork sausage was good but putting these items together on a plate didn't do it for me. i never eat pancakes but the lemon ricotta pancakes were great but with pork sausage and fried eggs? The price was $20 before the tip.\n\nOver-all: Plow experience is more like a rushed lunch at a hot new restaurant than the perfect breakfast in which one puts ones thoughts together for the day. Apparently from the reviews, Plow is popular and people were strategizing what to get before it opened at 8am on a Sunday. \n\nPersonally, I prefer a leisurely breakfast where i take my time; enjoy browsing the paper in sunny comfort, breaking into caffeine induced philosophical discussions now and then. \n\nI recommend trying Plow but for my taste, as a breakfast experience, it may be a victim of it's own success.", "author": "Bill W."}

We ate in 20 minutes,  got the bill and left in 25. The most relaxing part of this brunch was waiting at Farley's, a nearby coffee shop. \n\nAfter 40 minutes at the coffee shop, the table still wasn't ready. They gave us free apple fritters while we waited. I think this is their beignet but they called it \"apple fritter\" when they gave it to us. Freebies are a generous move and it was much appreciated.  \n\nThey told us a table would be another 20 minutes but the counter was available.  We waited 20 minutes anyway for our food.\n\nI was grumpy from hunger and impatience by the time my eggs benedict came.  My poached eggs had several pieces eggshells in them.  I bit down and felt a disgusting crunch.  Aww hell naw hell naw.  Further insult - the hollandaise was no longer emulsified.  The sauce had curdled.  Gross.  Lastly, it was not good in flavor... they added too much lemon.  Thumbs down for this dish; the other components were just so so.  The side of crispy potatoes with onions was the best thing on the plate.\n\nMy lemon ricotta pancake never came so they just canceled it and I GTFO'd.\n\nThe wait is definitely not worth it.  Not even if it was good.  Which it wasn't.\n\n- - - - -\n\nComments unrelated to food:\n\nSitting at the counter gave us a full view of the cooking.  One line cook who was in charge of eggs had a permanent close-to-tears look on his face.  My friend asked if I thought they liked cooking, since he was literally pumping out eggs (fried! poached! scrambled!) dish after dish.  This guy was a one-man sweatshop for eggs.  He and the other line cook (who was in charge of meats and pancakes) very much earned their salary.  \n\nThere was a woman in the kitchen who was in charge of potatoes and plating, and she would snack on every other dish she was preparing.  She was super chill and seemed to be just standing around every five minutes while the other two line cooks toiled away.  She also only wore an apron instead of a chef's jacket.  This led me to believe she was BOSS.\n\nI think it was just my hunger talking but I started to resent every dish she plated that wasn't my food.  She kept snacking everything she plated/prepared.

Tastier than the famous Mama's in my opinion. Every item on the plate has its own unique flavor and texture, yet it works all so well together.\n\nI'm a foodie who not only loves eating, but also loves cooking. I can usually make the typical cafe style breakfast/brunch at home, so I usually don't find breakfast menu surprising or eye catching, to me they're all pretty much the same. But at Plow, even their potatoes stand out of the breakfast restaurant crowd! Its crunchiness is amazingly  addictive that makes your teeth wanting to take one bite after another ( yet it's stil; fluffy on the inside). \n\nI had 'The Plow\" because i wanted to try the well-reviewed lemon ricotta pan cakes but I also wanted a salty breakfast ( The plow comes with 2 small pan cakes along with home made sausages and your choice of eggs). The lemon ricotta pan cakes didn't do it for me, BUT, the pork sausages I had was so flavored and made with high quality minced meat that left me amazed at how delicious it was at every bite. \n\nAgain, I usually find breakfast at restaurants really average, but Plow's breakfast went beyond my expectation, it is truly worth the wait.\n\nVery busy if you are visiting in weekend.

Not their fault though: there isn't a lot of seating inside the tiny space and they use it the best they can.\n\nIf you can come back on an off-hour (I went at 12pm on a Wednesday and got the last two seats at the counter), it's very good.\n\nMost reviews talk about the Lemon Ricotta pancakes (which I had) and the Breakfast Sandwich (which my boo ordered) and it's mainly because there isn't much else on the menu. Unless you like to order granola or porridge or yogurt for breakfast, which has never made sense to me as a restaurant patron, there's some combination of pancakes and eggs.\n\nThe good news is that they're both excellent! And those crispy potatoes are great.\n\nI'm giving them the fifth star for two reasons:\n\n1) They have Nueske's Bacon, which is probably my favorite stuff on the market.\n\n2) They have a hot sauce brand I've never heard of and is made in the same zip code. I'm always so annoyed when I ask for hot sauce at a place and I get either Tapatio or Cholula, as both are unappealing to me.

They have completely captivated the majority of San Francisco and definitely don't need my help, this is just a love letter to their high level of consistency, execution, and creativity.\n\nThere has never been a time when a plow classic has thrown me off whether it'd be the lemon ricotta pancakes, egg sandwich, or \"The Plow\" (eggs, sausage or bacon, lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes). Each time I've had them they've tasted exactly the same, which is a very good thing. The potatoes are always amazingly flaky and moist on the inside but crispy and herbaceous on the outside. They remind me of Jonathan Waxman's famous potatoes at Barbuto, except I don't have to travel all the way to New York for them.\n\nThey also take recipes from great breakfast places all over this nation such as Joanne Chang's Flour in Boston and execute them exceptionally. Their really nailed Joanne's chocolate brioche with pastry cream recipe... I hope they do her sticky buns with goo next!\n\nI also love it when they do their own seasonal riffs of breakfast, my favorite of all time was their \"Chinese Breakfast\" which had delicious red roasted pork on top of fluffy rice topped off with a fried egg. I will probably scream and jump up and down for joy when they bring it back--- it was one of the yummiest breakfasts I've ever had. *Siiigh* Those tender and aromatic pieces of pork mixed with the unctuousness of an oozing yolk on top of pristine pearly rice, oh god, it's a recipe for love potion.\n\nMy only advice is to get here as soon as they crack open their doors. Waiting an hour to eat food is pretty painful and is especially devastating when it's your first meal of the day.", "author": "Lisa Q."}

Came late on a Friday afternoon around 1? was seated right away. I ordered the Fried Egg Sandwich and my bf ordered The Plow. The Fried Egg Sandwich wasn't bad - didn't realize there would be no meat in this meal but i do love aioli sauce! wished there were more. The sandwich came with crispy potatoes and grilled onions - that was really good. super crispy on the outside and the potato texture on the inside. The Plow came with your choice of meat - i believe they make it themselves? with crispy potato, 2 eggs your style, and the LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES. Those were amazing. Crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I believe there was cheese in there but i couldn't taste it. The lemon addition in the pancake was amazing. felt like i was eating a pastry! I dont usually like pancakes cause they're a little on the heavy side but these were so light. I will be getting an order of Lemon Ricotta Pancakes next time :)\n\nbeware - this meal comes with food coma -____- at least it did for us!", "author": "Kristina L."}

Came with crispy potatoes and eggs prepared your way - we chose scrambled.\n\n- Eggs Benedict with Spinach and Mushrooms - My favorite.

They don't typically seat a table of 7 but after a bit of discussion they were ok with seating us outside. We put our names down and then had to wait for a little over 2-1/2 hours to get a table. At this point, it is fairly standard for all good Brunch places in San Francisco and being a large party definitely made it worse. But oh well, at least there is a nice bookstore a block away to kill some time. I also recommend stopping at Farley's and getting a croissant and coffee. \n\nThe group ordered a medley of dishes, the lemon ricotta pancackes, the french toast, the fried egg sandwich and the Plow. I won't bore the reader with the details (800 other reviews describe them quite accurately), but they were all delicious. I especially liked the sweet stuff (the french toast and pancakes) versus the fried egg. The potatoes with the fried egg was pretty awesome but I think the egg sandwich at Mission beach cafe is just a tad bit better. \n\nOverall, I think it is a very good brunch place. But I am just not convinced waiting 2-1/2 - 3 hrs for brunch here is worth it. But I am loath to make other recommendations since the good ones all have a long wait.

Anyways, I ordered the plow, substituting the lemon ricotta pancakes for their gluten free counterpart. Upon the arrival, first, of a french press filled with Ecuadorian coffee, then their decadent chia seed pudding. Both of which were very delightful. Next, our meals arrived.

After I dropped her off to find parking (an easy-by-SF-standards 10 minutes), she informed me there was an hour wait. \n\nNow, for good brunch, an hour is nothing. Many debates have been had in NYC brunch places (yes, I know this is SF, but you wait a similar amount of time for good brunch here!), and there have been stories of showing up 3 hours before closing (think Clinton Street Baking Company) and being told that you won't be able to get seated that day. \n\nThe only negative experience was the wait, though. The estimated wait time and the actual are nothing alike. If you're not there when they call your name, you get skipped. And yes, that means that if your name magically gets called 15 minutes after you put it down (and you wandered off because they told you to wait an hour), you get skipped. Really, really annoying. So bring your Kindle and coat (if it's cold), and stay put.\n\nWe got seated at the counter (with rosemary plants!) with a full view of the stoves. Really fun to watch! Out of the three guys working, one looks useless. I think this is also typical. The stove master is boss, though. Watching him work though palates of eggs was super fun. \n\nBeverages were tasty (although I thought the mimosa overpriced for the size), and I got the Plow in order to try a bit of everything. Here's the rundown:\n\n- Potatoes are crispy outside, soft inside, well-seasoned, and very tasty. \n- Pork sausage was the best meat option (homemade patties are delicious!)\n- Ricotta pancakes were bland and had a weird ricotta cheese texture (ha!) \n\nI'd come back.", "author": "Ingrid C."}

The wait was only 20 minutes my second time. =) Naturally, we waited on the cute benches attached to the side of the building. \n\nI wish I was living in the houses around the corner because I would be a regular! We had the French Toast... which was amazing. Literally I wanted MORE! And the The Plow, which consisted of a little bit of everything popular...house made pork sausage, lemon ricotta pancakes and crispy potatoes. I felt like the pork sausage tasted like some type of Vietnamese pork type food. The lemon ricotta pancakes were also amazing.

We patiently waited while it seemed to me that a lot of people gave up. \n\n \nPlow's dining room is bright and loaded with natural sunlight during the day. The restaurant features high ceiling, polished wood floors, and a busy open kitchen. They also have outside seating and provide blankets for those who are sleeveless and wear shorts on a cold windy spring day like last Sunday. That was very thoughtful of them.\n\nDon't even bother counting how many calories you think you are consuming, because it is probably a lot. They serve traditional breakfast items. We got the plow and egg benedict. The food is rich and heavy, the homemade sausage is OMG delicious.

Service was friendly, but can't say it was fully fast and efficient because the wait to order and receive our food after we were seated were longer than waiting for a table (table: 30 minutes, food: 35+ minutes).

She came over to ensure us that our food was coming out next so perhaps a little whining doesn't hurt anyone?\n\nWhen the food got out, all the waiting was worth it. SO WORTH IT! On our table, we have the french toast with roasted peaches, soft eggs, and the plow. I LOVE their french toast, they cut you 3 thick slices of \"french\" bread? Definitely not the skimpy slice of bread from a loaf. Lightly dusted with sugar powder, even the maple syrup was light! Each bite of the toast melts in my mouth, it's not oily and I finished my meal before the two hungry guys so that means something right there. I also had their homemade lemonade, it was decent, not too sweet, but the glass was pretty small.\n\nThe other guys seems to enjoy their food and one of them complimented on their potatoes. I had a up-coming culinary chef in my group and even he said he'll return to this place. The brunch did come up to about $15-$20 per person.

Well, it was for me on a nice, cool Sunday mid-morning. The lack of star perfection wasn't due to her, it was the 1-hour wait for a table, but hey, you learn to expect that at places in SF that don't take reservations. They don't take parties greater than 6. \n\nSituated on a corner in Potrero Hill, Plow is small inside with just as many seats outside. The reason for the bitch, is that they have 2-person tables lined up along the wall of the restaurant and well, I had to get in to the inner table for my seat. I asked her nicely if she could move her chair in, well, she moved her butt, not moving the chair and barely at that. So basically I just shoved past her. Good thing I was sitting next to her and didn't have to stare at her sour-puss face the entire meal like DK did sitting across from her. Anyway, she made for good conversation.\n\nOnto the food...once we were seated, our waitress took a while to bring us our waters and by then we were ready to order. You really can't go wrong with a breakfast place that has a pig sign under the name of their restaurant. Mmmm.....oink.\n\nI had: the plow  two eggs, choice of Nueske bacon, house made pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage, two pancakes + crispy potatoes  14\n\nDK had: max's biscuits + gravy  two buttermilk biscuits, pork sausage gravy, crispy potatoes  11\n\nIt came out fairly quickly and it was GOOD. The bacon was plentiful and was cooked just right, the pancakes had this lemony hint to them and were on the smaller size, but that's because they're not your average pancakes. They were really good though, but kind of had a french toast consistency and about the size of English muffins. The potatoes had some sort of Saffron or something on them, because they were as yellow as my egg yolks, but boy, were they good. I normally leave potatoes untouched on my plate (except for the hash brown kind), but these were awesome and just the right amount of crispy.\n\nDK's biscuits and gravy were really good and the gravy was coma-inducing. \n\nI really enjoyed my breakfast, sans bitch.

My friend and I showed up at 11am and waited an hour for our table.  When we finally did get seated, they provided us with blankets since it was pretty chilly outside (points for thoughtfulness!).\n\nWe ordered the salmon egg benedict, fried egg sandwich with bacon, and a lemon ricotta pancake to share (literally one pancake).  Believe what you've read about the pancakes - ours was amazingly fluffy and lemony, with the slight tartness balanced out by the syrup.  The fried egg sandwich was good on its own, but the bacon put it over the top (this coming from someone who normally takes the bacon off everything).  It's a bit messy to eat since the yolk gets everywhere, so ladies be careful if you're trying to impress your date.  The salmon egg benedict was disappointing - nothing you couldn't get at your neighborhood diner and certainly not worth an hour long wait (for ones worth the wait, try Mission Beach Cafe).  If you opt to sit outside like we did, make sure you're a fast eater - the SF chill made our food cold and unappetizing rather quickly.\n\nThe service was delightful and never rushed us, even though there was still a long line when we left.

Anytime of the day actually but I'm saying this because of the windows that line an entire wall of the corner located store, allowing a great amount of daylight into the room. That's the first thing I noticed. Came in with my sister late morning and we were seated right away! MAJOR plus! (since, I hear the wait can be terrible). I then noticed that we were seated very closely to another group of people (so close, it was as if we were all seated in one cozy table). Despite that fact, this is what gave the restaurant a social, friendly, casual, and \"fun intimate\" feeling. We got our waters right away and our waitress was very prompt!! \n\nWe looked through the menu, searching for something that stood out to us. Of course, we had to choose the infamous 'plow' and also decided on the Chicken Tinga to share. Eggs over easy for both- but you can have your eggs however you want them. Also, as a heads up, being the small business that it is, they don't serve groups greater than 6! \n\nThe menu says no cell phones allowed? (not sure what that meant or why) That didn't stop me from checking in and taking pictures of my food - I HAD TO! ;)\n\n-Chicken Tinga tasted mucho bien! A nice crunchy corn tortilla laid beneath chipotle tomato sauce and two eggs over easy, avocado, and creme fraiche. It was fresh and flavorsome. The textures and flavors mixed very well together and the combination of breakfast and mexican worked oh so well. \n \n-Plow: Lemon ricotta pancakes were zesty and very smooth from the homemade ricotta. It was a new idea for me. I liked it with syrup which added sweetness to the zest. Potatoes added crunchiness to the plate- dipped each bite with ketchup/hot sauce, scooping up the oozing yolk from the eggs (Mmmm spicy and savory)- Eggs over easy was a genius idea, I might add! Chicken apple sausage had a smooth, sweet, spicyness. Overall the whole plate was full of dimension. In my opinion, the pancakes were very appropriate, being that the potatoes were super crunchy, the eggs oozed yolk, and the sausage added a kick! \n\nBoth plates had different ideas but I personally liked the Chicken Tinga for flavor. \n\nDon't go here if you don't like loud and compact areas.

Take away some outside seating, or train the hosts to slow down the pace of the turnaround. The kitchen clearly cannot handle the amount of ppl who want your food. \n2. Get a bigger kitchern/look at what other stuff you can pre prep , or\n3.

This quaint cafe makes me want to live in Potrero Hill. I'd be blessed to come eat here every morning before work. Such a cute inspiration, if I ever become a restaurant owner, I'd love to echo a place like this. \n\n- Food, healthy and exquisit (organic)\n- Prices, little more out of the pocket (i spent $20 for myself)\n- Service, on-point\n- Ambiance, simple and cute neighborhood cafe\n\nThis is a restaurant that's packed all weekend long, especially for brunch. One to come with another or a few people. I've decided to drop in at 7:30AM on a Tuesday, alone (call me a loser, i guess I am. HA!). No worries, only one other person was there and the place was empty that early in the morning (good thing for me). Typically, I would'nt come to such a place alone but I been at the gym since 4:45AM, don't have to be at work until 9AM, bored and HUNGRY.\n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS\n\n**pictures to come**\n\nLEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES ($10.50) - house made ricotta, lemon zest, and pure maple syrup. This came out with three pancakes covering the entire place, a sprinkle of powder sugar drizzled ontop, a dab of melted butter, and a side of the pure maple syrup. I must say, this was absolutely DIVINE & HEAVENLY. The pancakes were something i've never had before, definately can taste the lemon zest, and the ricotta just gave the batter that creamy-sweet taste. It was extremely delcious!!!! And the pure maple syrup, you dont need that much on the pancakes. Highly recommend trying.\n\nCHICKEN APPLE SAUSAGE ($4) - kind of pricy for three sausage links. But it was definately needed to balance the sweet and creamy on the palate with some savory. Worth every penny after one bite. The sausages were perfectly cooked, browned on the outside and tender on the inside. \n\nCAMELLIA BLOSSOMED ICE TEA ($3) - it was served in a class with a lemon slice. Didn't add any sweetners and kepted it plain; taste real good with the lemon slice inside. Might not be for all palates but for those who like iced tea, this is for you.\n\nCOMPLIMENTARY H2O (Free) - love it when a restaurant brings out a chic glass bottle of water for the table. pour your own water!!!\n\nThe total of my bill was about $20 bucks. I left not feeling heavy nor gross. I left feeling refreshed and ready to start a long day in corporate america. That's a great feeling when you've ate well. \n\nWill I be back? Definately. I'll need to call people up to see if they'd like to wait in the long line with me on the weekend. If not, I can come back here alone and by myself at 7:30AM again. \n\nJABA APPROVED.

The granola is crunchy but not overly so, the yogurt is made fresh in-house and the honey is harvested from within the neighborhood.\n- Quite possibly the best B.L.T.A. I have ever had... Perfectly toasted bread, in-season heirlooms, fresh lettuce, creamy avocado, bacon cooked just right (not too crispy, not too limp) and just the right amount of aioli. It also came with a side of perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried potatoes that did not need any ketchup.\n- My peach pie was warmed just right, topped with a perfect sized dollop of whipped cream and bursting with fresh peaches.\n- Friendly, knowledgeable and attentive waitstaff.\n\nMinor flaws? The coffee should be WAY better considering how good everything else is. Doing to-order drips from either Four Barrel, Ritual or Sightglass would be more appropriate given the quality of the food. Also, please serve your butter at room temperature so that we can actually spread it on your muffins without risk of crumbling them to corn meal - cold butter does not spread well on muffins, no matter how hot they are. And I've never said this before but... get some comfortable chairs. They may look good but I felt like no matter how I was sitting I was uncomfortable.\n\nAnd while it's not Plow's fault, having to listen to the banal minutia of the lives of the 40 and 50-something yuppies that populate the neighborhood while waiting for a table was pretty obnoxious.

Well, I think Plow is doing just the opposite for their lemon ricotta pancakes. They're making a dense batter (anything with that much ricotta has to be dense), and then lightening it with whipped egg whites like you're supposed to do for waffles. Gives you a lighter texture, but still plenty of structure and a crispy exterior. Plus, waffles reheat poorly, and so did my leftover pancake. Now I could be totally off the mark, and no one but me could care about my little theory, but I like to know how things work. Especially yummy things.\n\nThe lemon ricotta pancakes were super delicious, but I wish something had been served alongside.\n\nI also wish I had gotten some of those potatoes.

In fact, Plow serves the best breakfast we've ever eaten.  No s*it.\n\nEach morsel that entered our mouths was pure perfection, nearly a religious experience and as good as sex.  Plow's potatoes are definitely the best breakfast potatoes I've ever eaten and they've somehow managed to make an English muffin taste divine... and I'd sworn off of them many years ago.  The fresh salad greens on our plate were better than anything I've had anywhere... really.  The were huge, robust and tasted truly \"farm fresh\", a claim most restaurants make but, hey we know better than to believe them.\n\nBest thing I had was the almond gluten free pancakes.  They were terrific.  I especially appreciate Plow serving real maple syrup, without asking and without extra charge.  Now that's classy and shows they care about food.\n\nThank you for the best breakfast ever... so depressed though that nothing will ever meet up to this experience again.", "author": "Danielle S."}

The wait was about 15 minutes for two on a Thursday afternoon at around 1pm. The hostess/server was very nice and assured us that we would be seated soon. Since Plow is, as they describe \"modest in size\" definitely expect to get seated literally inches away from some random people. Anyways! Since we looked at the menu beforehand, we received our orders within 15 minutes. Pretty fast! I also want to mention that the wait went by quickly since my boyfriend and I were watching the cooks cook/prepare the food in the open kitchen. I ordered the Plow while my boyfriend settled on the Fried Egg sandwich.\n\nTheir water was served in jugs! My favorite. :)\n\n(From their menu)\n\nThe Plow-- two eggs, choice of Nueske bacon, house made pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage, two lemon ricotta pancakes, crispy potatoes  14.5\n\nFried egg sandwich -- two eggs fried, aioli, frisee, Vermont cheddar, Acme bun  10.75  add Nueske bacon  12.75\n\nThe Plow was SO good! The eggs were on the watery/yolky side which I didn't mind. The bacon tasted exactly like how my mom makes it -- It was sweet and not too crispy. The lemon ricotta pancakes had a cake-like consistency and tons of flavor. My only complaint about the pancakes was that they were way too small! The potatoes? Best freaking breakfast potatoes I've ever had. They were flavorful, crispy, and oh so good! I also tasted my boyfriend's Fried Egg Sandwich was was also, very good. The total came out to be about $30 something for breakfast.. a little pricy, but totally worth it!", "author": "Joyce E."}

The wait was suppose to be about 2 hours which is ridiculous because it's not that good and I would never wait for food like that.  Don't get me wrong, I definitly enjoyed my meal, (but the company was better), but like I said, not wait 2 hours good.   \n\nIt was my first time so I got The Plow with sunny side up eggs and the pork sausage.  The eggs were cooked well, the potatoes perfect, lemon ricotta pancakes were good, but the sausage was boring.  I had a mimosa with my meal and I did like how the flute curved out just a tad for that extra sip.  My husband got the spinach eggs benedict which he inhaled so it was probably good.  Our friend Chris got his usual scramble and then ate my 2nd pancake since he likes them so much and I couldn't finish.  We were out of there in about a hour.

I love you\n\n\nPlow is hands down, forever in my heart, deep within my soul, my favorite place to get breakfast. I eat breakfast here when I'm happy, I eat here when I want to celebrate, I eat here when I want to treat myself to something nice. I even eat here when I'm sad. (I do eat my feelings in the form of house made pork sausage.) Something tells me I'll be frequenting this place a little more nowadays. ;( :D\n\nI've never had anything bad here. And not even just that, because well, that's a lukewarm statement. I've only had EXCELLENT things here. The coffee is delicious, and so is the food. I most always get the Plow, which consists of lemon ricotta pancakes, crispy, crispy rosemary potatoes, eggs, and some sort of protein. I've had the soft scramble as well. Last time I was there there were oyster mushrooms, goat cheese, and stinging nettles all enveloped in soft, pillow-y, quivering eggs. freaking yum. \n\nAnd seriously, I don't mean to assume, or step on anyone's toes, but... it doesn't seem like anyone hates their job here. I know, rude of me to say. But no, really. The service is always served with a genuine smile, and I always come back because they are really, really, really nice. \n\nI recently went on a Saturday and even though they open at 8, the restaurant was full by 8:05.

My table ordered a number of things to share: the french toast, crab scramble, some pork dish (i forget the oh so elegant name), and of course the plow. \n\nMe being a fan of all pancakes (just had the best sweet potato pancakes the weekend before at brenda's), I was super excited to taste the lemon ricotta pancakes as part of the plow. So when they came, and I tried them, I was definitely let down. they were.... just okay. Definitely not as flavorful as I had been hoping. Matter fact, that's how everything was. I think the highlight if anything was the potatoes. Definitely had a good little crisp going on, and when dunked in ketchup, it was bomb! \n\nOne thing though that I liked more as an afterthought was that I left not feeling weighed down by the food. Not sure if this was because I didn't eat much of it or if the food was just very healthy/airy/light, but i did appreciate not feeling like i need to take a two hour nap afterwards to digest the food.  \n\nso all in all... I'm glad I went to plow, and can now check it off my sf bucket list. but will likely not return, and don't really recommend it actually. there's other restaurants in the city where the food merits the wait a lot more.", "author": "Jennifer O."}

Also, it's also really cold in SF and you have to wait outside for a table so bring a warm jacket.\n\nThe food was pretty good. I ordered the \"The Plow\" which has a little bit of everything. The potatoes were really good. They seem to be deep fried first then tossed in a pan with some caramelized onions. The home-made pork sausage patties were really good as well. The only thing I didn't care too much for was the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were a bit dense. It's probably the ricotta that makes it like that but I like my pancakes light and fluffy. \n\nOverall, I would definitely come back to try the rest of the menu.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2013-01-26", "description": "Plow has been on my list of \"must try restaurants\" for awhile.  Today when hubby and I were near the area, we decided to stop in.  Little did I know it was going to be a royal waste of time!  We showed up at 1:00 on a Saturday and were told the wait would be 30-45 minutes for 2 of us.  So frustrating to see people streaming out and several four tops (arriving after us) getting seated before us.  Problem is:  the very small restaurant is made up of mostly of four tops - so parties of 4 get priority seating.  At 50 minutes, I seriously considered cutting bait but we had come so far so we persevered, pushing past the pangs of hunger and our near-frozen fingers and toes. Had we been given an accurate estimate of the hour wait time, we would've gone elsewhere.  Like, Chez Maman - close by and has never disappointed.  \n\nAn hour later, we were finally seated at the counter.  Our server showed up almost immediately to take our drink order but took awhile to come back for our food order.  After I made eye contact with her twice (once she mouthed \"I'll be right there\"), she finally came back.  Hubby had The Plow and when I ordered the eggs benedict, I was told, \"Oh, we're sold out.  We JUST sold the last one.  Literally a minute ago.\"  Really?!?  Way to add insult to injury.  We waited an hour in the cold wind, you took your sweet time with our food order and now you tell me that I just missed the last plate of eggs benedict by ONE minute?!?  Had she been more timely and efficient and showed up a minute earlier, I wouldn't have missed it.  Argh!\n\nUnfortunately, the food wasn't good enough to rid the bad taste in my mouth I got from the wait and the couldn't-care-less attitude of the staff.  Though the food is better than average, it is in NO WAY worth the hour wait (or 2 hours for some other Yelpers who seem to have much more fortitude than I).  \n\nI won't be going back unless they start taking reservations and upping the batch of hollandaise they make.  It's a head-scratcher for sure - they had plenty of eggs, ham/spinach/smoked salmon and english muffins (I had a side order, in fact) but they couldn't serve me eggs benedict?!?  I can only guess that they ran out of hollandaise.  How hard is it to make extra hollandaise?  Apparently this outage is a frequent occurrence - so why hasn't Plow addressed this?  Dear Plow:  Make extra hollandaise.  It doesn't cost much and you'll more than make up the cost of any potentially wasted hollandaise in the extra plates you sell.\n\nDon't get sucked into the hype.  I wouldn't recommend going to Plow but if you absolutely must, then 1) go on a weekday, 2) go with a party of four and 3) make sure you place your order of eggs benedict ASAP (before you do anything else!).", "author": "Tone C."}

But land too many hits on her (when she has 5 bars), and she'll turn into the bitch from hell. My health bar waiting at Plow was at that magic pixel of life remaining, and there was one moment where that final punch landed on me, and it was on... full on Dark Phoenix sour puss bitch-face for me the rest of the meal.\n\nHere's the tl;dr version of this review: Only eat here as a pair; not a 3-some, not a group of 4; Budda help you if you're a party of five or more. The food is better than average. The price is hipster high. And the wait is long and not worth it. The staff is friendly once you're seated.\n\nBack to the fighting game analogy; I started off the morning at full life. Sure, we had to wake up at 7:30AM on a Sunday to drive across town to eat here; but I knew what I was getting into. This is SF, brunch waits are supposed to be brutal, but it'll all be okay in the end... I know that. I also understand that when a party of four shows up, we'll have to wait for a space to free up to get seated. But when MULTIPLE groups of pairs and THREE people parties were being seated ahead of my four-person party, my life bar took a hit. Why couldn't they just wait for 2 pairs seated near each other to leave and push those two tables together for us? I guess the business sense I gathered from this experience was: In the long run, it's okay to piss off a group of four customers, if you've already made 10 other customers happy. You still end up +6 overall.\n\nWhen we were finally were given a table (an hour later after being initially told a 30 minute wait... you know, because we were the 3rd on the list arriving at 8:15AM), my lifebar took another big hit when I saw that a family group of four (parents plus 2 kids) who DEFINITELY came by after us were already seated and getting their order taken. How did this other four person party have priority over us?\n\nLife's at a pixel now. The final blow? A pair who came later than us and who was seated before us finished their meal. Their table was cleared but was intentionally kept empty and not filled by the exponentially growing line behind us. When the second couple who sat adjacent to the now empty table left, the tables were cleared and the two tables pushed together to seat an incoming party of four. Why didn't this happen for us? \n\n\"I can't control it!\" And that was it. Even if they brought out food blessed by Alice Waters herself, it still wouldn't erase the bitterness and sour taste already in my mouth.\n\nI will say that the actual service of the waitstaff after we were seated was exceptionally friendly and kind. The food? The best food item for me were their potatoes. Top tier. The lemon ricotta pancakes were good, but not food nirvana like most of the reviews seem to think. Solid high tier. The eggs were prepared fine, but who really messes up scrambled eggs, you know? Mid-tier. The sausage was a bit dry and the bacon a bit flimsy. Low tier.\n\nI'm sure if things didn't start off on the wrong foot, I may have enjoyed my meal better. But for the price paid, it was just not worth the effort, even if the waitstaff was nice.

Until one day the manager followed my 61 year old father across the street to scream at him in front of a large crowd of people. \n\nMy father had been a loyal customer for nearly two years, eating at Plow about three or more times a week. He had a friendly relationship with all of the waiters, as well as the owners. One day he wandered in for a quick breakfast (note: if you need to get somewhere and only have a short time to eat, this is not the place for you). He made if clear several times to the waiter that he was in a rush and asked repeatedly if they had time to make him his dish. The waiter and chef reassured him several times that there would be plenty of time. After not being able to get the waiter's attention for 30 minutes, and no sign of the meal anywhere, he signaled that he had to leave for his appointment. The waiter acknowledged him, and he got up and walked across the street. The manager of the restaurant ran after him, screaming and cursing in front of a group of people, and telling him how disrespectful it was for him to leave. \n\nWhen I found out that this had happened, I couldn't help but ask myself: Doesn't someone working in a restaurant always learn that the customer is always right? I though that was a basic rule of the restaurant business. I was shocked that the manager would talk that way to not only someone who has been such a loyal customer, but would speak to anyone that way. It makes me sad because I loved this place, yet I can't justify going back when they have treated my father with such disrespect and poor taste.", "author": "Aislinn C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 1}, "datePublished": "2012-08-26", "description": "This is one of the saddest, most frustrating reviews I've ever had to write. I discovered Plow in its first months and I was so excited. It had been forever since a really awesome new breakfast place knocked my socks off in SF. Everything was amazing, the restaurant was quaint and busy and clean, the service was impeccable. I came here again and again, and recommended it to my friends enthusiastically. I never wanted to yelp it because, selfishly, I hoped that it wouldn't become *too* popular. Of course, it did become popular, and the lines on the weekends got longer. Even so, I got up at 7am many a Saturday or Sunday morning to make it by 8am and beat the line. It was worth it. \n\nI first noticed things slipping in March 2012. I came with 2 other people, waited for an hour+ (wasn't surprised, I knew we'd have to wait). Then we were seated at a 4-top. However, the host informed us that really, we were only allowed to have one half of the table, and they were going to put a chair on the long end and seat another party in the other two seats. Yes, a table for 2 people (a standard 2-top) with a chair pushed onto a longside (in the tiny aisle). We couldn't even fit 3 plates of food and our water glasses on the table. We asked if we could wait for a larger table and were told no. Apparently, they only seat 3 people at tables for 2. OK. Even though it was expensive, and we were squished and basically sharing our table with strangers, I came back again and again anyway because the food was delicious, and aside from the seating issues, the service was good. \n\nI had been craving their lemon ricotta pancakes, and dragged my husband out of bed early yesterday morning. I was so excited to get there and be first in line when the doors opened. \n\nWe both ordered a coffee (they are $3.75 a piece, btw). Of course, it was 8am, and I drank my first cup in 5 minutes. Nobody came by to ask if I wanted a refill, so after trying to get someone's attention for 10 minutes, I got up and poured a refill myself. Remember, I was the first table in the restaurant. Nobody could possibly have been in the weeds yet. \n\nThe food came, and my bacon was practically raw. The waitress had set our food down and began taking the order of the table next to us. I waited until they were done and then tried to get her attention politely. I was probably too quiet and she didn't hear me. I said excuse me a little louder. And a little louder. I wasn't trying to be rude, just wanted to get her attention before she walked away since she hadn't been attentive and I didn't want to eat cold food. She seemed incredibly annoyed, even though I was nothing but polite about it. I thanked her profusely. She still hadn't offered me a single refill, so when she brought the bacon back, I asked for one. This also seemed to irritate her. Can I say it again? It was 8am. There's no reason for anything to be off with your first table of the day!\n\nAlone, that would be just bad service. But the food wasn't good. Like, not even diner-level good. My scrambled eggs were passable. The bacon came back fine. My lemon-ricotta pancakes were cold and rubbery. They tasted like they were day-old and had been sitting on the plate for an hour. My husband's eggs benedict (his usual favorite) was watery -- like the eggs hadn't been dried off before they were dropped on the spinach. And there was the tiniest serving of hollandaise sauce -- a smattering on top. These items used to be amazing. They were not just less-than amazing, they were subpar. If the waitress had been even the tiniest bit attentive, I might have pointed these things out to her. But at that point, I could feel her irritation, and I didn't want to complain to her about basically everything, particularly considering she was annoyed that I wanted a coffee refill.\n\nI wouldn't return to eat that food. Combine that with the irritated service from the waitress whose long hair wasn't tied back, but hanging over her shoulder. And the fact that this cost us $50. Two coffees and two breakfasts. \n\nMinus 1 star each for the food, the service, the wait and the price that adds insult to injury. I'm sorry, Plow. It was good when it was good. Now, I'm just happy to never return.", "author": "Marissa K."}

Wait to spend money. Why would people do that?? Get a scone from Farley's and go home, ya'll!\n\nAnyway, my misery over the wait isn't Plow's fault. In fact, once we were seated, they seemed to move things forward at a good pace. \n\nI had the fried egg sandwich with bacon, as did one other in our party. A third person had the ricotta pancakes. The fourth had the soft scramble. I also ordered a side salad, which was just lettuce. The salad, if you can call just lettuce a salad, was fine. The greens were fresh and the dressing was good. The sandwich was delicious, and the pillow-soft brioche bun really made it fabulous. The crispy potatoes were excellent, too. Ketchup would have been blasphemous. My friends enjoyed their meals, also. The creme fraiche pumpkin muffin was just okay. \n\nAll in all, I'd go back for SURE if I ever catch this place without a wait.", "author": "Karen Z."}

I have never been to their restaurant but after reading all the wonderful reviews I thought, \"what a great opportunity!\" \n First and for most, the owners of Plow are incredibly nice people.  It's was very obvious while speaking with them that they have a love and passion for what they do: making delicious food, using fresh ingredients, and quality over quantity. \n\nThe class made the following menu items: \n Pecan streusel muffins\n Lemon ricotta pancakes (and for those who don't know, the ricotta is home made, not store bough...talk about fresh)\n Shirred eggs with tomato and gruyere\n Biscuits and gravy\n Quiche\n Chinese breakfast (caramelized pork shoulder with eggs over rice)\n Plow potatoes \n Smoked trout salad\n\n Breakfast is my favorite meal; I love it all and was so impressed with the meal we made! The pork shoulder in the Chinese breakfast was mouthwatering. The tomato sauce for the shirred eggs...so fresh, a taste you would expect from an Italian restaurant. The savory sausage gravy over perfected buttermilk biscuits...amazing! And of course the lemon ricotta pancakes and the plow potatoes that I have read so much about were better than I expected. I am very picky about home fries/hash browns, and often find most restaurants just miss the mark, but Plow's technique of cooking their potatoes ensures every bite is full of flavor. \n\nI can not say enough about my breakfast experience!!

We were seated outside, and I ordered The Plow, which included: 2 pancakes, 3 pieces of bacon, 2 eggs, and some potatoes.  In addition, I ordered some chicken sausages on the side.

The chicken sausages were pretty good, probably wouldn't get it next time thought, it's just typical sausages.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-08-06", "description": "What a difference a couple years makes. I wrote a review of Plow a little over 3 years ago and after many more visits, I feel compelled to update my review. \n\nTHE FOOD: Still good, sometimes great. I often find myself craving their lemon ricotta pancakes and when that happens, nothing else will do. They really are that good. And other dishes are reliably good in a way where you can't really go wrong. BUT...my husband and eating partner-in-crime pretty much always orders eggs benedict at Plow and at any other breakfast/brunch establishment. The past maybe 5-7 trips to Plow have resulted in unpredictably cooked eggs on this dish. About 50% of the time, one or both of the eggs in his eggs benedict have been overcooked and either partially or completely lack a runny yolk...total bummer for an eggs benedict lover. We began to sort of hold our breath as he'd cut into his eggs, not really knowing what to expect. Otherwise, the food has continued to be reliably good for the most part.\n\nTHE SERVICE: Sadly, it's the service that's prompted me to update my humble review. And let me say that I'm not taking to my computer after one negative experience like some crazy hothead. Being totally reasonable, I can appreciate Plow having an \"off\" day. It's only after this started to become the norm that I took notice. Here are a couple examples of recent experiences:\n\n- Husband and I recently sat at the counter just on the other side of the glass from Maxine, the owner. We placed our typical huge order: coffee, orange juice, pastry of the day and cold-smoked salmon toast to share, lemon ricotta pancakes, and eggs benedict. (Told you - major fatties.) About 5 minutes after placing our order, we decided we wanted a side of bacon. So we asked our server if we could add this and were told it would be no problem. I mean, it's bacon, right? That should be pretty easy to toss in. So our food starts to come out and we dig in. First the pastry and salmon toast, then the pancakes and eggs benedict. No bacon in sight. We don't want to be jerks so we don't say anything just thinking that it'll show up soon. Well, fast forward to the end of our meal. We are to the point where our plates are empty and the server is asking us if she can clear them. We say Of Course! and also toss in that the bacon never arrived and that we don't need it at this point. Maxine overheard this and it immediately throws herself into our interaction by saying, \"It's coming out right now\" with what felt like a snippy tone. I sort of felt like we were in trouble but still managed to sheepishly say, \"But we're all done with our food. I mean, our plates are being taken away,\" to which Maxine  curtly replied, \"So you don't want it then?\" Maybe it's just me but it's not fun going out to eat and then feeling getting scolded by the owner and being made to feel like you've done something wrong. Actually, we were sort of expecting an apology when she jumped into the conversation. When she first started to speak, what I was expecting was more of a \"I'm so sorry! It looks like you guys are done eating. Do you still want the bacon even though it's late? Totally fine if you don't.\" \n\n- Last weekend we had some family in town and wanted to take them to Plow as we definitely enjoy the food. Knowing that a monster wait develops almost immediately, we got there at 7:30am to ensure we were the first people in line. As we stood there waiting, we all took turns studying the menu hanging on the front door planning what we were going to get. My husband, of course, was telling our family how he always gets the eggs benedict and that it's his favorite. So my mother decides she wants to try it too. The door opens at 8am and in we go. My mom orders first and requests the eggs benedict. The server quickly says, \"I'm so sorry but the eggs benedict isn't available yet.\" And we're all crestfallen. Half of our party was planning to order eggs benedict and it's really the one breakfast thing my husband will eat. So my husband politely asks, \"What does that mean - 'not ready'?\" She says their hollandaise sauce isn't ready yet and that it should take about 30 minutes. So we ask for a few minutes to figure out our plan. We decide we've got plenty of time and decide to wait the 30 minutes with some extra smaller plates to start. When the server returns, we tell her we're going to wait for the eggs benedict but order a few smaller things in the meantime. She says, \"I can't do that and have you hold the table that long.\" We go back and forth and then my husband asks why it takes so long to make hollandaise. He tells her it only takes a few minutes to do and that he doesn't understand. She says she doesn't know how it's made but she'll go ask and is clearly miffed with us. She returns quickly and says, \"Okay, they'll do it. It's ready.\" But we definitely feel the brunt of her irritation and again feel like we're in the  Principal's office and have done something wrong. Major mood-killer and unnecessary.", "author": "Amy K."}

The line was consistently long the entire time we were in the neighborhood, so unless you come substantially earlier I don't think there's any avoiding the queue.  You can grab a coffee from them (a nice brew) while you're in line, but I would eat something before coming, anticipating that brunch could actually become lunch before you know it.\n\nThe food at Plow is very fresh and quite tasty.  I had the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were nice and syrupy, but not sickeningly sweet.  My friends had the soft egg scramble (smelled great) and the 9-grain muffin (toasted perfectly) with homemade peanut butter and honey, which were also both delicious.  The market fruit platter consists of a tiny portion of grapes and berries and a sliver of a mango for $6; the other items we ordered were on the pricey side but not unreasonable.\n\nOverall, I think that eating at Plow could have been a  great experience, but, feeling faint and starving after the long wait, I devoured my food and didn't have a chance to enjoy the flavors or the ambiance.  If you have a scout who can get your name on the list early or want to wander around the pretty Potrero Hill neighborhood for a while on a lazy, sunny Sunday, Plow is a great place to eat.

The space is small and there is only one unisex bathroom behind a curtain. I ordered The Plow and couldn't help myself but to devour the entirety of it. The potatoes lived up to the hype and the lemon ricotta pancakes were a divine finish to the meal though the housemade pork sausage patties were probably my least favorite - they lacked salt or a kick in my opinion.

We ordered the doughnut holes as an appetizer (perfect couple of bites of freshly fried dough with powered sugar dusted on top to prep me for the main dish).  I ordered the duck hash.  It was excellent!  The hash consisted of sweet potatoes which was a nice change to a traditional hash.  It was the perfect sized portion; i was full, but didn't feel as tough I over did it.

Got seated @ the counter where we can get a glimpse of the action and we were greeted by our super-model-like-drop-dead-gorgeous and super-friendly waitress Ashley.

This past weekend she brought me here for breakfast. We got around the area around 8:30 am and parking was easy to find and best of all no wait to get seated. My sister did warn me on the weekend, however, the wait can be over an hour so I am glad we were there on a Friday. \n\nThey have great options on their menu but I had my sister decide what to get. We decided on The Plow and the Fried egg sandwich. The Plow comes with two eggs, crispy potatoes, lemon ricotta pancakes and a choice of meat. We chose the plate with chicken apple sausage. \n\nBoth plates were delicious. The freshness in the ingredients were there. The Plow is a great option if you want a hearty breakfast. The lemon ricotta pancakes are fluffy, although i usually don't opt for anything lemon-y, these were really good and I did eat it all. The eggs were perfectly cooked to my liking. I really wish I can mimic their crispy potatoes because they are the BEST breakfast potatoes I ever eaten; it is extra crispy on the outside, but not at all over cooked on the inside. The chicken apple sausage was yummy too. Everything on the plate complimented well with one another. The fried egg sandwich has frisee, cheese and two friend eggs between a soft warm bun. I don't really like frisee but it really worked well with the cheese and the saltiness of the egg. The sandwich also comes with crispy potatoes. \n\nService was friendly and quick. It is very cozy in there...just the way I like it in this type of places especially in the Bay. Can't wait to return.", "author": "Jeannie C."}

The breakfast potatoes are perfect, and love that they have a gluten free option for pancakes. I have no complaints about the food however, my last experience there with the service was dissappointing.\n\n I've worked in the service industry for 9 years, I've been a host, busser, runner, expo, server, manager - you name it. A few Sunday's ago I was meeting a friend for brunch. I put my name in with the host and went to Farley's for it was to be about an hour and a half wait. When I came back they called my name and I was seated, my friend was taking the bus and would be arriving shortly. A few minutes go by and one of the hosts comes by and asks me where the rest of my party is, I let her know that she'll be arriving shortly. She goes and talks to the other host and comes back and tells me that they don't seat people until all their party has arrived but since it was \"their mistake\" they would \"let [me] stay and get [me] some water.\" It was super awkward and uncomfortable. \n\nMy most recent job was as a host and I'm sure I've gotten a bad yelp review maybe for not smiling enough. You probably shouldn't go up to a partially seated table and say this - this is something you ask before you seat the party. I had mixed feelings about writing this review, it was Sunday brunch and I get what that feels like. I've worked Sunday brunch for at least the past year - it effing blows, it really does. I understand people who work in service are human beings (duh) and deserve the same respect any person working any job deserves. I get how stressful and shitty brunch shifts and hungover 20-30-somethings demanding more alcohol can be, and I also get how much working as a host totally sucks. This experience totally sucked. The food is excellent, the runner/busser who looked like he loved his job and loved the music (EnVogue Pandora) was great, the servers are fine, but this interaction with the host was pretty bad. I'll come back because the food, music, and most of the staff rocks but I hope my next experience isn't so uncomfortable.", "author": "Kati K."}

The wait was long (which is to expected for any brunch spot with 600+ reviews), but the wait was totally worth it. One great thing is that there are multiple options for vegetarians, and all sounded delicious. Another huge bonus for us was the gluten-free pancakes, since my husband is allergic to wheat. He hasn't had pancakes in years, and these were not just wheat-free... they were wheat-free and delicious! \n\nMy one star deduction is due to 2 things:\n\n1. The uncomfortable seating. I found the chairs to be incredibly uncomfortable, and it's a little disheartening to be eating something so delicious, but not be fully enjoying it because you are uncomfortable. \n\n2. It is not fully accessible to people in wheelchairs.

Side of potatoes too. My sandwich was on the bland side, since I didn't add bacon (+$2). Even avocados would have been an add on. Too bad. I think they should just offer it on for more texture and taste. But I sprinkled some hot sauce and ketchup and that helped. \n\nThe potatoes were really the stand out though. They must use a blend of small potatoes and sweet ones, with skin on and deep fried, then tossed in seasoning. Very savory and flavorful. First time I polished off my potatoes since I'm not a big potato starch fan.\n\nThe lemon ricotta pancakes were delish too. Thicker and more dense, the light lemon flavor was a nice surprise.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-20", "description": "So I think Plow is definitely a solid 4 but nothing more than that. Which was a bit of a let down for me because I had heard SO much about this place -- even some of my foodie friends calling it their favorite brunch in the city. I was hesitant on going there on a weekend because I knew the wait would be crazy but my friend who was visiting me had a car and down to drive us and was adamant on trying a new place which was perfect for me since Plow had been on my bucket list for so long. \n\nWe got there and were greeted with a FAT line out the door. The host told us the wait for 2 was easily an hour. Expecting that, we put our names down and headed around the neighborhood to scope it out while we waited (and Potrero Hill is very cute I might add). We came back exactly an hour later and were seated inside. The spot is super cute but it's also very small which totally explains why the wait is always so long. We both already knew we wanted the Plow (little bit of everything!) and got the buttered bread and homemade preserves as a starter. The bread was definitely tasty but the jam was honestly nothing mind blowing (it was mixed berry). Also it was a super small portion so each of us got only 2 tiny baguette pieces. I guess it's meant to be only for one. \n\nAnyways, another good thing was that the food came out relatively fast. Here's my breakdown on each of the parts of the dish:\n- Eggs: MIND blowing for SURE. You could tell in an instant that these eggs were farm fresh and organic. I loved them.\n- Chicken apple sausage: Very average IMO. The nice thing was that they got our dishes mixed up and actually brought both of us bacon but when we told them they brought us five sausages each -- which was more than enough!\n- Bacon: Super average. Sweet Maple's is 100X better.\n- Country potatoes: Definitely good but I thought they were a little too fried. They could have been just regular potatoes and still been just as good without being overly crispy. But I still enjoyed!\n- Pancakes: Good too but I was super sad to realize they didn't blow my mind. Now just a disclaimer -- if you like anything lemony then you will LOVE this -- because the texture is bomb, the portion is perfect, and the consistency is great (not too dry, not too soppy). But sadly I'm just really not a lemon person (never been into any lemony desserts either), but I LOVE my pancakes. So I enjoyed these but I wasn't blown away. My friend on the other hand loved them. I also should have known I probably wouldn't be obsessed, but my friends had told you could barely taste the lemon (which is not true). \n\nAll in all, excellent dining experience, ambiance, and service. You could tell the food was fresh too -- but I just wasn't blown away which is what I expected from a place with Plow's reputation. Not to say that's bad, I think a solid 4 is awesome, but I'm always in search of a 5 for brunching because I'm such a tough critic with it. (Olea still has my heart at #1). But I definitely loved my meal at Plow and do not regret going for 1 second!", "author": "Naseem K."}

I remembered loving their crispy potatoes and savoring our brunch. I was dying to take my potato-loving boyfriend to Plow to introduce him to the delights of their breakfast potatoes. \n\nAlas, every time we've tried to go for the last year and half, it has been an hour+ wait. Boyfriend is not one to wait around. We usually end up somewhere nearby and have explored many delicious restaurant alternatives as a result (a plus after all?). Well, we finally got our opportunity over a recent ridiculously rainy weekend. It was a downpour. My boyfriend woke me up at 7am on a Sunday and said, \"Plow opens at 8! Let's go today. It's our best chance.\" Look at the things we do for love!\n\nWe went (though I dragged my feet getting out of bed) and arrived around 8:30. The wait was going to be between 1 to 1.5 hours. (!!!!!) WTF?!? We decided to wait. I banked on the fact that everyone who put their names down ahead of us likely didn't want to wait around in the rain. As luck would have it, we were seated after about 30 minutes. We ordered quickly -- two coffees, two dungeness crab scrambles, one side order of lemon ricotta pancakes, please! \n\nAnd then we waited for an hour. We watched all the people around us get their food and begin eating. Our server came over to explain there had been a snafu in the kitchen and our food was just being fired. No apologies. No offer of something to put in our stomachs in the meantime to offset the three cups of coffee we had been drinking during the wait. We watched the people who were seated after us finish and pay their bill before our meals arrived. And then when it did arrive, it was fine... fine as in mediocre, not fine as in \"all is right in the world.\" Our scrambles were pretty salty and we got one tiny pancake to split... perhaps we could have asked for more info on what the \"side\" of pancakes consisted of.\n\nWhen we got our tab, we still got no apologies, nothing comped off of our bill, and no fulfillment from our experience. After a year and half of trying to return to Plow, it was a bust in the end. We left with a sour taste in our mouths and confusion as to why so many people keep coming back and waiting that long. Chez Maman is a half block away and has a lovely brunch. You'll find us there.", "author": "Kelly N."}

We got there at about 12:40 (I got to the city 30 minutes late and my friend got lost on the way there. You live in SF and you've been there countless times before, HOW DO YOU GET LOST??) when it was packed, giving us a 45-60 minute wait. I didn't mind at all; I'm a really patient person and we ended up spending that time in a nearby bookstore anyway. We got back and opted to eat outside on a beautiful day in the city. It was kind of awkward eating on a slanted plane, but it wasn't terribly uncomfortable. And the pigeons walking around the tables got a little bothersome (but not in an annoying way, if that makes sense), but that's also a risk you take sitting outside. And the blankets they had available were a nice touch in case it got chilly. Okay, none of y'all want to hear about this, let's talk food!\n\nGenerally I like to try what a place is known for on the first visit, which would thus be the Plow, but my friend decided to order one herself and offered to have me try some of her lemon ricotta pancakes. I easily obliged and chose a brunch favorite of mine anywhere: eggs benedict with ham. First of all, I loved my eggs benedict. Not too much hollandaise sauce and the english muffins were quite big, and quite deliciously fluffy. Also: I love eggs. Good choice, me. I also had a little bit of my friends' pancakes. It was then in that moment of that first bite when I promised myself I'd be back to have a whole plate of it for myself. Oh, and I can't forget:\n\nThem crispy potatoes, tho.\n\nI'd come back just for them, TBH. Furthermore, our waitress was super nice (and super cute) and, oh, they have Tapatio. I already liked this place from first impression, but honestly they had me at Tapatio. The coffee was decent, though I'd love to try their cold brew some time. It wasn't quite warm enough that day for it. WELP I guess that's another reason to come back huh?\n\nAnyway, to sum up, there really wasn't anything from my experience that would deserve to have a star docked off, so 5 it is! I'll be back, it's just a matter of when at this point. Thanks!", "author": "Allen Mark A."}

No other groups wanted outside tables, so we bypassed the TWO HOUR wait and endured a little chilly drizzle over hot coffee and good food -- the smarter choice in my opinion!  Good brunch -- but really glad we didn't wait TWO HOURS.  Ambrosia from the gods would not be worth that much of my time...\n\nI ordered the Plow ($15) -- good way to sample what they they do best.  Fresh eggs, 3 small chicken apple sausages, boatload of crispy potatoes, and 2 small lemon ricotta pancakes.  Pancakes and potatoes were the best.  I think the potatoes are flash fried or something -- amazingly crunchy, but not dripping with oil.  Best brunch potatoes I've had -- hands down.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were the perfect size (not too big - i think bottomless flapjacks is the grossest idea ever).  Texture was great and flavor was delicate and not too sweet.

If you are going on a weekend plan on waiting at least 1 hour for a table. Plow is not very big so the wait gets really long. They have a bar and stool area that faces the kitchen and also about  25-30 seats in the dining room.  If you go on a weekday there will probably be a wait as well, but it will be about 5-15 minutes.  \n\nMy personal favorite at Plow is their friend egg sandwich with potatoes on the side. Make sure to add avocado to your sandwich for an extra punch of flavor. Its so good I actually have dreams about it. In my dream, I eat about a hundred of them back to back without gaining an ounce of weight!  Love those dreams!  I've even started making my own fried egg sandwich at home inspired by the one at Plow. Mine is damn good but still doesn't hold a candle to the one at Plow!\n\nI've never tried their Chinese breakfast, but considering every time I go they are out of it, tells me its super popular and very good. \n\nThey are located in Potrero Hill so parking is pretty good considering its SF.

Walked in on a Tuesday late morning hoping to skip the brunch bunch and squeeze in before the lunch crowd, but I failed.. the little restaurant is already full. Luckily, I was a lone soldier and was able to fit in between two couples at the bar.\n\nI've been big on decor lately and Plow is another place that has me hooked. This homey, cozy place has a hint of chic mixed into it. The open kitchen makes sitting alone at the bar more enjoyable. I love watching the chefs work magic creating the seemingly simple dishes.\n\nI must confess, I did not order the famous Fried Egg Sandwich. Seeing that I already made my own version of scrambled eggs that morning, I ordered the Fried Chicken Sandwich instead. That and a side order of the gluten free almond pancake. What caught my eye was that the sandwich would be served on an Acme Torpedo Roll (and I'm a strong believe that unless you royally screw up your food, this roll will make anything taste amazing). \n\nWhen the sandwich came out, it exceed my expectation and then some. The chicken breast was breaded just enough to give it that crispy skin without the doughy texture. The chicken was fried so perfectly that it was white but juicy throughout. No Salmonella, thank you very much. Mixed with the cole slaw, this sandwich was perfection. I ate only half and took the rest to go. And then five minutes later I finished the sandwich in my car.\n\nYou might think gluten free pancake would be gross, but this was probably the best pancake I've ever had.

I only had two complaints, so I'll get those out of the way first: my tea was obscenely weak--just warm water really, and the bill was over 50 bucks for two people who just drank coffee and tea. That's pretty pricey for a casual Saturday breakfast.\nThis place is popular with the early crowd. We arrived at 9 and were seated at 9:45 (on a Saturday). We sat at the center, which turned out to be fun. There's an open kitchen, and everyone in it was totally tapped into their flow, cranking out food to a synchronized rhythm. Everyone seemed to really enjoy working there.  The music was 50's and 60's rock and soul hits, which created a nice atmosphere. The employees were smiling and dancing while they worked their butts off.\nThe food was excellent. We had the almond flour pancakes and the corned beef hash. Delicious and totally paleo. Definitely high quality ingredients prepared well.\nAnd our waitress Katie was so genuinely nice--perhaps the nicest waitress I've ever met in San Francisco.

Its nothing crazy special, but it is a decent place to go to if you're in the area and craving some lemon ricotta pancakes or homemade pork sausage. \n\nAs everyone else has said, the lemon ricotta pancakes are very tasty. We got them by ordering the 'plow' which came with little medallion sized pancakes, eggs, potatoes, and choice of meat. The pancakes weren't the best I've ever tasted, though (best I ever had were in auburn, ca). The pork sausage that is more like a meat patty was a nice touch, but for some reason it was too meaty... and something was just a little off in the seasoning. I also had the egg sandwhich with the bacon. Bacon was nice and thick, but overall the sandwhich was meh. Too messy even for an egg sandwhich, best part was the buns. The house potatoes were too crispy for my liking, although they were tender inside. \nI was curious about the pumpkin bread with icing... but didn't get to try. \n\nWith the considerable wait in mind, I didn't really understand all the hype.

I viewed their website in advance and was aware that they did not take reservations and were a small venue that could only accommodate up to six in a group, so we kept our group to six.   We had heard good things about Plow and we were excited to give it a try. \n\nWe arrived on a Sunday at 9:00 a.m. and we were told that it would be an hour wait.  The wait wasn't actually that long.  It felt like 20 minutes but it was probably 40 as we were busy chatting.  We sat outside.  \n\nAs we looked at the menu, someone pointed out a sentence in italics that said something to the effect of \"no modifications to the menu.\"  I don't have the exact wording.  Well, to start, that's a bit of a buzz kill as who doesn't modify something even a little?  I decided to order all \"sides\" so that I could enjoy what I wanted and not have a plate with things that I don't care for included.  Very simply put, I ordered 2 eggs scrambled, crispy potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit.  How can you go wrong with that?   No where on the menu did it say that the crispy potatoes were \"rosemary crispy potatoes\" and it just so happens that rosemary does not agree with me and I stay far away from it.  It spilled over into my scrambled eggs, and I could not have been more disappointed. As a group we made our own modifications, and friends shared pancakes and meat that they would not ordinarily order.  Friends enjoyed the lemon ricotta pancakes and the buttermilk biscuits and the eggs seemed to be quite fresh.  \n\nOn a more important note, the waitress that we had was anything but cheerful. She didn't appear to be overly friendly to anyone outside.  From the moment we sat down, we felt her negative energy and lack of any form of customer service.  Overall, we had a great time together, the food was good, but the service was not anything to write home about.  On the ABOUT section of their website it says \" Plow is a tribute to timeless recipes coupled with California cooking and warm hospitality.\"   Well, the hospitality portion was definitely missing from our experience which was really unfortunate. \n\nMy rating of 3 stars is more about the service than the menu or food experience.", "author": "Sharon M."}

I live a couple houses up and ride my bike past the restaurant every day. There is always some kind of line outside the restaurant, even on weekdays! Good for them! However, that means I just haven't been in awhile because waiting in the line sucks.\n\nAnyways, I went yesterday (Sunday) for brunch. Was quite disappointed in both the food and service we received at Plow. \n\n1) I ordered a duck and sweet potato hash. Sounds amazing, right? Well, the duck was fatty and flavorless. Quite gamey but not in a good way. I kept on having to add ketchup and hot sauce because it just tasted like someone had taken cubed duck breast and boiled it. There was no caramelization, no nice tasty brown spots on the meat. There were also fatty chunks on the meat that weren't rendered properly, like poorly cooked pork belly.  All of it was a dull brown-gray. The sweet potatoes fared no better. They were overcooked and disintegrated fairly quickly. I was super hungry and ate 2/3s of it, but ended picking at my friend's meals (they all got the Plow) to fill up.\n\n2) The service! It's gotten so snobby! The blonde girl who served us (we were sitting outside) really needs to consider the fact that she's at a BREAKFAST joint, not a Michelin starred restaurant. Two incidents. First, my friend asked if they had brown sugar. He just likes the extra richness. She says, \"We don't have brown sugar, we have RAW sugar\" in a tone that basically said \"how dare you ask for brown sugar when we have this organic local better-than-you sugar here already\". Second incident, another friend asked for goat cheese instead of cheddar on her fried egg sandwich. She makes a face and says \"well, I'll get that for you on the side because it probably won't taste good.\" Girl, have you even had goat cheese on eggs and frisee? It tastes FINE. Delicious, even! I understand if we were at a fine dining establishment, and the dish has specific ingredients that were meant to go together, but for fucks sake, we just want to switch out the cheese. \n\nBottom line, probably not coming here very often anymore, especially since the wait is a huge turn off. It's expensive too, I spent $20+ on just my dish (no coffee, no extras). I'm sad because this used to be a great, friendly, local brunch restaurant, and I feel like it's just turning into the next Mission Beach Cafe with the snob factor.

Actually, I've been hearing raves about Plow from friends, the blogs, and pretty much anybody who had been and weathered the wait for their tasty breakfasts. Truth be told, I am not enamored with Mission Beach Cafe or Boogaloos and didn't think that breakfast at Plow would wow me.\n\nThe breakfast wowed me. \n\nWe started with a corn and millet muffin, freshly baked and still warm from the oven. The muffin was crumbly and a bit hard to eat but the crust on the muffin top was crunchy and the millet added crispy bits to the slightly sweet corn muffin. Seriously though, all muffins should be eaten fresh and warm from the oven. \n\nNext up were a la carte orders of an almond pancake (gluten-free!) and a pumpkin pancake. The pumpkin pancake was fine, similar to what I make at home, but the almond pancake was really interesting. I didn't believe it was actually gluten-free at first b/c the texture was so spot on and it wasn't heavily almond flavored. I dislike marzipan, so I was quite pleased at the neutral flavor profile of the pancake. We asked the server and she informed us that it was made with almond, oat, and coconut flour. An excellent option for the g-f people out there.\n\nThe soft scrambled eggs were the turning point for me, where I switched from liking Plow to loving Plow. Of course we've all read about the proper way to slowly scramble eggs, slow and over low heat a la Julia Child or Jacques Pepin, and I thought I had it right before. I was wrong. These eggs were so, so silky. Not runny, but perfectly silky, highlighted by fava greens, chanterelles, and goat cheese. The much lauded crispy potatoes and some levain toast (well buttered with butter you could actually taste) were also there. I don't even like eggs and I kept going back to them, passing over the crispy fried potatoes!\n\nWe also tried the Chinese Breakfast whose name manages to simultaneously bring to mind my family and Humphry Slocombe's Secret Breakfast. Anyway, of course you can't go wrong with gingery braised pork shoulder over rice, but the soft scrambled eggs are really where it's at.\n\nAll the ingredients used were obviously quality; seasoning levels and ingredient ratios were also well balanced. Loved the clean yet rustic vibe of the naturally sunny dining room. Also loved our server who understood that we were there to sample some different dishes vs eating at a traditional pace. She brought things out at a comfortable rate and was there to answer questions as needed. I can't imagine this perfect vision of what breakfast at Plow is ruined by the hoards on weekends so I guess I'll just save it for an occasional 7am weekday treat.", "author": "Candice L."}

They're tossed in some salt, pepper and rosemary (and maybe other things that I just don't know about) and they add the perfect little crunch to the plow platter. \n\nThe wait can be a little long since they don't have much space to seat people, but it's always worth the wait for me.

It was a Sunday morning, around 10:30 am. As usual it was crowded, but I put my name in for a party of 1. I asked for a counter seat towards the wall, as at the time the only open seat they had was a ridiculously tight fit for a big guy like myself.\n\nI waited extremely patiently for an hour, watching the spot close out and get ready to open up, what would have been two counter seats.\n\nStill waiting, an SUV pulled up, one individual jumped out and put their name in on the wait list, while the other pulled around the block for parking.\n\nBy now, it has been 70 mins.\n\nAround 80 mins into waiting, with clear sight and eye contact from the lead host, she walked out and called the party of the SUV.

A patiently waiting customer, in queue, they should have given me that seat. I must have been at least 10 parties ahead when I put my name in.\n\nSure enough I marched in and confronted the lead host and asked why the two SUV individuals were seated A) ahead of me B) in the spot I had wait for 90 minutes.\n\nThe host first lied and said \"they were a ahead of me.\" I pointed out if she looked two pages back my name was at the bottom with notes of where I wanted to sit, and that I would wait. Then the host said \"they're a party of two, and there were two seats.\" At that point with my voice raising, the owner/manager walked over and tried to lie and cover up for the host. Not even knowing the facts.

During my last visit, I ordered the almond flour pancakes, which are perfectly fluffy on the inside, with the right amount of almond flavor so as to deliver a rich taste without being overwhelming.  I've also ordered the french toast with strawberry compote, mascarpone, and syrup, which was tremendous.  I'm a vegetarian so I can't comment on meat dishes, but friends whom I have gone to Plow with all rave about the dishes they've gotten (everything from The Plow to the Nicoise salad).  Plow is also one of the few places that serve Equator coffee in SF (especially now that La Boulange is being acquired by Starbucks) - while expensive at $3.75 / cup (unlimited refills), it complements a meal perfectly.  Service is great given how hectic things seem to be every time I visit (which has always been on weekends), as the staff is very friendly.\n\nThe main negative aspect, as other folks have noted here, is the wait - it can be absolutely brutal at 1-2 hours on weekends.  That wait will get you a single table for 2 if you're lucky, or perhaps a seat at a table of 4 (typically shared with other people if your party is fewer than 4 people) or at the bar.  If you show up after 10:30am on a weekend, be prepared to wait a while ... with limited breakfast / brunch options nearby if you decide that you can't stand the wait.  Plow is also quite pricey for brunch (even by SF standards) - in my opinion, it's worth it, but coupled with the long wait it's something to keep in mind.\n\nAll in all, Plow is definitely worth visiting - and if you can make it work, visit on a weekday to avoid the brutal lines (note that they're closed on Mondays).", "author": "Rishi N."}

My friend and I ordered the soft scrambled eggs, the cherry tomatoes and goat cheese for me, and the oyster mushrooms and cheddar for her.  The mister ordered the plow.  My eggs were cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  I can see why people rave about the crispy potatoes because they were very good.

I never would have ordered them even though everyone always raves about them, so that was a great way to try without committing, and I did love them both. I was a bit less impressed with the crispy potatoes, which also get raves - I found them to be good, but they didn't really elevate fried potatoes to a whole new level of deliciousness for me.

The demand is therefore high. If you're an early riser, I'd recommend arriving at Plow at opening time in order to avoid the wait. \n\nI eat rather \"clean\" by following a Paleo/SCD diet, which advocates avoiding starches and consuming high quality meats, vegs, and fruits. Plow serves delicious meals that easily fit in with this eating philosophy. The Two Eggs dish is a great option for people following this diet. Note that the staff can swap the potatoes with greens.\n\nService and atmosphere are both very good. \n\nPlow is not a greasy spoon, so it is not going to satisfy palates accustomed to heavier fare, but if you are hungry, the Plow dish (two eggs, choice of house made pork sausage, Nueske bacon, or chicken apple sausage, two lemon ricotta pancakes + crispy potatoes) is a great choice for people who are not on any restricted diets.", "author": "Kristina P."}

The name conjures up fantastically dirty thoughts, the food is always amazing, and the service is adorbz.\n\nI am going to forgo telling you about the potatoes, which are so magically perfect they are almost certainly fried in unicorn fat. I'll ignore the eggs, which come out great whether it be the soft scramble, shirred, or in the famously sandwiched form. I'll refrain from telling you how I thought I knew what a good pancake was until I had a lemon ricotta one from Plow- thereby rendering all other pancakes paltry puddles of tasteless batter by comparison.\n\nWhat I want to talk about is the homemade organic yogurt and granola. Really. I know, I know, who the fuck goes to a restaurant, waits outside in the freezing cold for a table, and then orders yogurt and granola? I never thought I would admit it, but...that person is me. It comes with seasonal fruit (just had pear and persimmon, yum!) and local honey, and is honestly the perfect portion size. Just ignore your inner fatty/hungover gut one morning (as I did) and try it. You won't regret it. I mean, they MAKE their own yogurt. How cool is that?\n\nOne thing that I am always amazed with is the fairly reasonable prices, considering the fantastic quality of the ingredients. It really puts other restaurants to shame in that department. Most ingredients on the menu are labeled with where they came from, almost always from great local farms.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-03-14", "description": "Sitting atop Potrero Hill on the corner surrounded by trees and benches is Plow. It is a small, hip, and trendy brunch spot. Their menu changes weekly, so come back often. The boast fresh organic produce from local farms, which is the norm in San Francisco, but not the standard.\n\nTheir french toast is crunchy outside with a custard-like creaminess inside, delicately sweet and garnished with fresh berries and a brulee'd banana. Served with subtle sweet Vermont syrup (not too sweet, not too thick, just perfect syrup). \n\nLemon ricotta pancakes is my favorite and it's one of the reasons I keep coming back. I have convinced many patrons to try their lemon ricotta pancakes when I brunch here. They are dense with pockets filled with ricotta (a light cheese, similar to mozzarella) and a subtle lemon flavor. I've tried to replicate their lemon-ricotta pancakes and while my pancakes can be similar in taste, they do not have the same thick, rich and hearty elements that Plow creates.\n\nThe eggs benedict are okay. The star of the dish is the hollandaise sauce which I feel is too zesty.  Most holllandaise sauce has a mild creamy flavor with subtle tang, however Plow's hollandaise sauce has a robust tang that overpowers the other mildly flavored components. I suspect a heavy hand in lemon juice. Poached eggs cooked to perfection. \n\n\"The Plow\" is a good way to sample all of their good things (it comes with lemon ricotta pancakes -smaller version). The potatoes are tasty but their inconsistent size makes the large pieces stand out in buttery goodness and the tiny bits too burnt to eat. Their homemade sausages are a bit dry. However, you can't go wrong with the chicken apple sausages (yum). \n\nThe house made organic yogurt + granola with fresh fruit is not worth it. I think that it could have used more berries and less citrus fruits in my honest opinion. \n\nThe fried egg sandwich is okay. The nueske bacon makes it a tad better. The acme bun was lovely. Everything else was standard. \n\nThe dungenous crab scramble was tasty. It had hearty pieces of crab meat. Definitely a go to dish to try. But I think it's a bit pricey at $17. \n\nThe almond pancake was disappointing. I didn't taste any flavor of almond. But I suppose that it is a fan for gluten-free eaters. \n\nThe counter seating is quite small and can be uncomfortable, however that's where you get to see the magic of everything being cooked. I like sitting outside because it's quieter. Inside its warm and loud. \n\nPrice wise, I think it's expensive. IMO, I think that brunch should be $10 and under. Many of the dishes here can be made at home for the fraction of the price. The prices here $10-$17 per meal. Not including extra such as drinks or side dishes. The coffee alone is a whopping $3.75.\n\nOverall, I think that the food is prepared well and presented beautifully. I will return because think their lemon ricotta pancakes are delicious. However, the prices, long wait, and hit-or-miss customer service pushes the over all rating down.", "author": "Ellie J."}

I'd come back if they just made this one change.  At this time of the year, the sun doesn't hit that part of the street and it was freezing on our last visit.\n- Service has been slipping.  On this last visit, our server forgot to put our order in and we waited for an hour (in the cold, at our outdoor table) after also waiting for about 45 minutes to get the table.  Not fun.  At least they did give us a big discount but it was still a miserable experience.\n\nAnd for all of this, you get to pay $3.75 for a cup of coffee (seriously?

A bit like the old Outerlands format, but marginally larger.\n\nI ordered the Plow since I don't expect I'd be making this trip again (why on earth are you near absolutely nothing, Plow?!) as it comes with 2 eggs any style, crispy potatoes, sausage or bacon, and those lemon ricotta pancakes. The potatoes are hot goodness. Even an hour later sitting in that compostable take-out box. Ohmy. The sausage is top-notch too, even though I don't usually order meat with my breakfast (chicken apple, if you're wondering the flavor!). The pancakes, which I was really anticipating, were not as rich as I was hoping. I guess I'm a fatty. I was hoping for a bit more creaminess/ricotta to burst out and shine, but it's very subtle. It isn't dry as some others have commented, but definitely not the best pancakes I've ever had either. They're too dense, perhaps griddle cakes would be a better term. Also, (TMI alert) I tasted lemon from when I ate it in the afternoon til I went to sleep which makes me think there must have been some kind of lemon extract or something in there cause it was way too strong.... just my opinion.\n\nI wish I'd shared it with someone and perhaps taken in the restaurant a bit more casually, but I'd have to say the food I ate wasn't really worth coming all the way over. Glad I tried it, but not going again.", "author": "Tiffany C."}

I believe that they take care in each dish, and it comes out in the offerings, primarily the potatoes.\n\nThe lemon ricotta pancake was fluffy and creamy; it boasted just a touch of sweetness balanced with a hint of lemon, to boot. The duckfat cornmeal pancake possessed this tartness from possibly buttermilk? It was just rich and fluffy, with a touch of crispness. The coffee crumbcake was just OK, unfortunately. Lots o' blueberry, but sort of a mealy texture and light flavor.\n\nOnto the actual food. The crispy potatoes are the best I have ever had in the \"roasted\" category, bar none. Honestly just outrageously delicious potatoes. The soft scrambled eggs were good, but nothing fancy. But... the potatoes. Yes, they are mighty fine and just so... dang....

Every day, in broad daylight, sometimes right across the street from Plow, car thieves have been successfully breaking into cars (targeting rental cars or out of state plates) and stealing people's bags/computers/cameras/etc. Each time it seems the victims had just eaten at Plow (it attracts a lot of tourists - people who have valuables in their cars and who aren't aware of the high level of break ins in SF or who don't expect it to happen in broad daylight in front of people). Plow used to have a small sign posted but it was really small and hard to see -- and it seems as though they either took it down or it's not prominent enough for people to notice. We have asked them repeatedly to make the notice more prominent as their customers are getting robbed daily, to no avail.

Sorry, you could have seated us before some of those 4-somes, gotten them to sit outside.

But since all 3 of us cook rather well, and I could have tossed together scrambled eggs with oyster 'srooms myself....  Yea, potatoes were good and something I don't normally eat but servings are too big (my sister and I could have shared one serving)--and I hate wasting food.  The chefs are ace though, looked like every single order they sent out was perfect.  I just don't think it's worth the time and money and is \"trendy.\"  Since you do have to wait so long, they ought to at least offer you something while you're waiting--free coffee or something.

I heard them tell the people in front of us that the wait was an hour. Then when I asked, they told me 45 minutes. So we started to wait. One positive is that they serve free coffee while you are waiting. I ended up have 4 cups while waiting the HOUR and a HALF to be seated.

She brought the beer and refilled the coffee?!?!? We had a child with us. She spilled some OJ on the table and waitress literally watched us clean it up with one of the napkins from the table and didn't offer to replace the napkin. I got up and literally got one myself. We asked for her recommendation on the best 2 items on the menu and she pretty much started at the top and read every item. I'm not sure she has ever eaten anything there.\n\nNow the food. I thought it would be great, seeing as everyone in the restaurant was taking pictures of their meals before eating them. It's BREAKFAST....how great could it be? I ordered the PLOW, which is bacon and eggs. Like I said, I'm old fashioned. Only thing I wanted was my eggs over medium. Guess what? I got runny yolks...way closer to over easy.

A second indication of the fine feast to come was the plump, perfectly contented pig which graces each menu and serves as the restaurant's icon.   I studied the menu carefully and greedily as we waited.\n\nOrdering a 1/2 \"appetizer\" portion of the French Toast with caramelized apples, mascarpone, and maple syrup seemed like the right thing to do, and it was a good call indeed, every bite moist, rich and delightful.  \n\nThe next course for me was a combination plate that sounded and tasted too good to be true:  a festival of flavors including extraordinary lemon ricotta pancakes, perfectly crispy home fried potatoes and housemade fennel sausage.  Paired with eggs, this terrific trio took me on a non-stop flight to gastro-paradise.   \n\nMy girlfriend loved her soft scrambled eggs with merguez sausage and even conceded to the home fry perfection, quite an accomplishment given that ambivalence is generally the best a breakfast potato can hope for from her.

Best evidence are the potatoes that come with the dishes: Even for very fine breakfast establishments, home fries or hash browns or whatever the accompanying spud side happens to be, is often an afterthought and underwhelming.  At Plow, the potatoes must be cooked twice.  They appear to be smashed before frying which likely means they were boiled or blanched first.  They are seasoned liberally (but not overly) with prominent rosemary.  They are ridiculously good!  This care extends to the house-made sausage patties, lemon ricotta pancakes, biscuits and perfectly runny eggs.  Ingredients are all locally-sourced and periodic wine-paired dinner events involving local vintners are a real plus.  \n\nPlow serves as an anchor establishment in a classic San Francisco neighborhood, but, for better or worse (depending on whether you live close by, I guess), it has become one of the hottest breakfast tables in the City.  This reputation is well-deserved based on our experience.  The chef-owners' hearts are very clearly in the right place evidenced by the menu planning and preparation of the offerings.  It is very possible that the project that is Plow has taken on a life of its own, exceeding its initial space for sure and maybe even the scope that was intended.

I heard this was some of the best brunch in SF and I agree wholeheartedly.  \n\nFollowing the Yelp reviews, we ordered up a fried egg sando w bacon, one lemon ricotta pancake and the smoked salmon and bially.  All were absolutely wonderful.\n\nThe house potatoes were the best I've ever had.  Perfectly seasoned and with onions, fried crisptacularly - wow.  On the sando, the bread was so soft and fluffy and perfectly airy that it made the whole dish for me.  The egg was cooked exactly right and it gooed all over me when I bit in.\n\nThe salmon was awesome, the cream cheese puffy and wonderful, and the onions were pickly and sour and great.\n\nWe sat at the counter and were treated to a view of what everyone else was getting, and, while the menu has a range of items on it, In 75 minutes I think we only saw like three different dishes go out - the Plow version of the Grand Slam, the sando and a friend chicken sandwich.  \n\nThe bially was a little big and bready for me, and it was oven cooked rather than toasted.  I'm sure there's a reason for this, but I prefer my toasted bread/bagel thingies crispy-toasted on the outside and chewy on the inside, and this was just like mostly warm dense bread.  \n\nThat was the only very slight miss for me in an otherwise pitch-perfect brunch to kick off the world's first Month of BRUNCH.

Could this explain why I have spotted all pork options on the menu in .3 seconds or less, my eye drawn to them like a spinning spiral illusion? Heck no. I own the fact that I love pork. I naturally spot pork on the menu like a bullseye. That being the case, I am coming in like the Big Bad Wolf when I come to Plow...little piggies better run because they can't hide from me (note to PETA: This was written in fun, please don't come after me, I am not some crazy carnivore, I dig the veggie movement and try to limit my consumption of meat for various reasons. Did I mention I own 2 Maine Coon cats that I adore and who live in a pet friendly home full of love and attention?). \n\nAnyway, I've read over the menu, and it's time to make a choice. Everybody has raved about the pork sausage patties, so that is a definite yes at this point, yet how could I pass up bacon?  BOOM! Ordered both. At most places the consequence would be a 2 year stomach bomb sentence with a 6 month food coma. This place, no stomach bomb or food coma symptoms emerge, I am in the clear. BOOM! Plow's quality ingredients must be credited here, only at a place that uses great ingredients could this be explained. Apart from eating the 3 little pigs, the potatoes are a huge compliment and a hit on their own. Having mediocre potatoes with your breakfast can be as disappointing as going on a date and finding out your date is a Dodgers fan. These are SF Giant approved potatoes, so be sure to order these because they are flash fried and baked (I think), and if you've tasted potatoes prepared like this before you will be happy that you are getting some bomb potatoes! (that's a reference to EXQUISITELY Delicious, a good bomb, not a stomach bomb  ;p )\n\nComplimenting my plate was a refreshingly chilled raspberry mimosas and a nice view of the cool hip crowd in a well lit and cool designed interior. Complimenting my experience was Randall's cheerful and genuine welcome, evolving from your typical greeting to a full on conversation and photo sharing of the 49er's last game at Candlestick (this was during playoff's, c'mon people, it deserves a shoutout). Thanks for showing us the pictures of your experience at the last game at candlestick park, awesome photos and the only thing that subdued my envy and made me feel better about missing out on such an amazing experience like Randall's was the amazing breakfast that I had the privilege of eating at this establishment!\n\nFriendly and attentive servers and nice ambiance in addition to the great food make this one of the better brunch options in the city.", "author": "Mariano A."}

When I want to eat, I want to eat!\n\nThankfully, I was catching up with a great old friend, which made the hour a bit bearable. But come on, who waits that long for brunch? I can think of many places where I can go for an equally good (or better) brunch where I don't have to wait that long, nor do I have to pay nearly $20 for. Don't get me wrong: I'm glad that I tried it and I thoroughly enjoyed the food, but I don't think I'll return to a place where a brunch dish and coffee costs almost $20 and I have to wait an hour. \n\nSo, the good stuff: I ordered The Plow ($15), and the lemon ricotta pancakes are just as good as everyone says. And I am always happy to see real maple syrup instead of high-fructose corn syrup crap. The eggs were also perfectly scrambled, and the homemade chicken apple sausage were smokey and sweet in a way that only homemade chicken apple sausage can be. I was pretty disappointed with the potatoes, which seemed to be more small pieces of deep fried once-potato. I like them crispy, but I still like to know they were once potatoes. The coffee was also good, but $3.75? When did coffee become a side dish?\n\nIf you can get there on a day or at a time where you don't have to wait too long, it's definitely worth a splurge or somewhere to bring an out-of-town guest.

I've wanted to try lemon ricotta pancakes for a while and I'm glad I got to try it here. They were fluffy and moist.

The pure maple syrup really made it taste as good as it did, but I think the ingredient that really did it was the caramel. There was a bit of caramel on the bananas and it just made it stand out from all the other french toast that I've had before. \n\nI'd love to come here again.

There are plenty of small, interesting shops nearby to spend the time in while you're waiting so the time passed quickly. \n\nAs far as the food, it was fantastic! I ordered the fried egg breakfast sandwich and my wife ordered the pumpkin pancakes. Both were absolutely delicious and the portions were a perfect size. We had mimosas with our brunch which were also fantastic, but a bit expensive at $8 / glass. \n\nThe service was also great. Unlike most places that are extremely busy, the staff was friendly and not bothered when I asked how much longer the wait would be. Our server was also pleasant and attentive.\n\nOverall, a wonderful experience and one that we'll definitely be repeating soon.", "author": "Adam P."}

But we all know that if you eat too much of something good, it becomes sorta not good. That's what happened to us.\nAll in all, a good place to have brunch. But there was a smell in the place that lingered. I don't know if it was saffron or something. But it stayed with me even when I left the place. That smell also was associated with the potatoes.

Even though we usually get there early (before 9) there is always a line so be prepared to wait.  They do give out free coffee though which is a plus.  The lemon ricotta pancakes are divine and I highly recommend The Plow, which gives you a taste of sweet and savory.  The fried egg sandwhich was nice but a little runny.", "author": "Madeline W."}

I have been here at least 2 dozen times if not more. we bring friends from all over the country when they come to visit, however....\n\ni have once had to return a chicken sandwich for being undercooked.\n\nnext time, i was not as lucky.  I didnt return the slightly undercooked chicken sandwich and paid for it bigtime.  spent the next day on the bathroom floor curled up in the fetal position...  no more details on that, but it was AWFUL....  i have never been sicker in my life.\n\nhavent seen the chicken sandwich on there for a while...\n\ni did not write a yelp review then, i sent them an email about how much i loved the food and that i wanted to make sure that it didnt happen to anyone else.\n\nthey wrote me back, and said let them know the next time i am in and they would comp the next meal.  fine, but i needed to wait a while before i was ready....\n\ni finally returned, but didnt want to make a scene, although, the food was great.  the service however was not.  It was as if they knew i was the one that complained about food poisoning and wouldnt even look at me, as if i was in the wrong.

I usually avoid the weekends because of the crowds but it has been busy during the weekdays also.  Parking is normally not bad in the area.  \n\nThe food has been consistently good over the years.  Like on everyone's review, The plow is my favorite but everything is good.  Had the fried egg sandwich on my last visit which was great!  The strawberry lemonade was good but I'll stick to coffee next time.  Lemon ricotta pancakes is a favorite staple here.  \n\nI'm not normally a breakfast/brunch person but when I want a special or something different for breakfast/brunch, it's PLOW. \n\nThey have outside seating on the sidewalk.  I prefer sitting indoors but from what I have seen, the outdoor seating is great with people with pets, restless kids and the extra seats keeps the wait time down for everyone.  I love the picture of the people sitting outside with their umbrellas out.  \n\nBaked is a short walk away and is a favorite place for sweet treat after brunch.", "author": "Rave Y."}

I figured there was no way a brunch place in Potrero Hill would be open at 8 am on a Saturday, and it was easier to agree with him than to argue with him. Imagine my surprise when the place was not only open, it was actually full. I mean, sure, it was a beautiful day, but it was 8:03 am, and the place wasn't even supposed to have its grand opening until Tuesday. \n\nLong story short, I am really glad I got to try this place. \n\nLocated in a large, bright space on the corner of 18th St and Texas St, Plow feels incredibly inviting. Big windows let a lot of light in, the light that shines on the huge open kitchen and typical Potrero Hill industrial chic interior. The restaurant only seats 35, and it seems as though there is a lot of underutilized space. I bet they could easily cram 50-60 people there, but they wisely chose not to do that. We'll see if they have to make a change once the lunch crowds start pouring in. \n\nThe staff and the owner, who stopped by to talk to us, were incredibly nice, helpful and friendly. They were truly happy to see you and greeted you with a genuine smile. In response to my question \"Why did you call the restaurant 'Plow,'\" the owner responded \"I am a hick who grew up in Northern Wisconsin.\" Where else would you get that kind of honesty? \n\nOn day one of serving brunch, they were still working out the kinks. We heard them discussing whether the sandwiches needed to be cut, and they seemed to be unsure about a couple of things. Our waitress told us they didn't have wheat toast, and they only had some other toast. It sounded like \"Lavigne,\" \"Lee Vaughn\" or \"Love in,\" the way she pronounced it. I figured she meant \"levain\" and said that it was fine. It was actually quite good. \n\nWe started by sharing the pastry basket. Splitting a scone, a mini muffin and a biscuit amongst the 3 of us. The scone was delicious, the other two pastries were just OK. I had the bacon with eggs and home fries and levain toast. I really liked the way they prepared the bacon, which was thick and not too crispy. The home fries had a bit too much seasoning for me, but I understand that they were probably trying to give it their own signature flavor. \n\nI was impressed with the Southern influences in their menu offerings, including biscuits and gravy (yes, please) and pig's ears (no, thanks). The prices are very reasonable here, but the servings aren't extremely large. They now offer a combo that includes pancakes, eggs, home fries and bacon on one plate. \n\nStill, for me, it's a simple formula: Gravy + bacon - pig's ears + free & easy parking + friendly attitude = many return visits.", "author": "Yan G."}

We woke up early in the morning and were one of the first few people to arrive, but was still put on the waiting list (3 groups ahead of us).  An hour later we still did not get seated, but somehow groups who arrived after us were seated.  Their wait time:  5-10 minutes.  After we did get seated, we saw all those other groups of 4 already nearly done with their meals.\n\nI tried to put this aside and focus on our meal.  Overall I liked the sides (potatoes and eggs) more than the main dishes (pancakes and sausages).  The ricotta pancake had this weird texture, but the flavor was good.  The sausages were really dry though.  \n\nWould I give this place another try?  No, my overall experience was tainted with the crappy service.", "author": "A W."}

Plow is a great addition to the neighborhood and has real good food.\n\nAfter two and half weeks in the armpit of Virginia, Newport News any food that hadn't been deep fried, factory made or served as part of a buffet would have been wonderful but plow went far above those expectation.\n\nI had to tried to go here on the weekend but they were always so crowded and they close early too so I was happy that at 11am on Wednesday it was only 1/2 full. \n\nThe atmosphere is pure California cuisine as is the menu. Wood tables, open windows, the organic farms they get their produce from listed on the menu, prices mostly from 7-12 dollars, skinny hipster waitresses. It's got it all. The good thing is the food delivers.\n\nWe got the Apple cinnamon coffee cake, Anson Mills stone cut oatmeal, celery root soup and smoked trout salad. Everything was simple and everything was simply perfect.\n\nThe coffee cake is cut above your store brand coffee cake. the portion was large and moist.\n\nThe oatmeal was oatmeal and done right, it came with banana slices and two tiny bowls of nuts and brown sugar, nothing special and at a huge mark up but good.\n\nThe celery root soup was the best thing and it showed that the chef has some real skills, the crunchy croutons and creme fraiche added to an already tasty soup.\n\nThe salad was large, fresh and tasty. It would have been great to have something of a different texture since the avocado and smoked trout had a very similar texture.\n\nSince I live in the neighborhood I will definitly be coming back here again for lunch or breakfast during the week.

I've been here twice-- once around 1pm for a late brunch, and waited around 30-40 minutes (for 2 people) and the second time, came around the same time, but waited over an hour for 3 people. We walked around a few blocks to get a cup of coffee while waiting and there were a few places to sit as well, so the wait wasn't too bad and it was definitely worth it. My boyfriend told me I should order \"The Plow\" and I would tell anyone else the same! But I probably would have ordered it without the suggestion because I was set on trying their famous lemon ricotta pancakes, BEST pancakes ever and \"The Plow\" comes with 2 of the pancakes, sausage or bacon, potatoes, and 2 eggs. I love it when restaurants give you an option of a sweet and savory dish. I almost always go for it because they surprisingly don't come so often. I tried the pumpkin pancakes the second time and they were just OK to me. Anyway, only downside about this place is the wait, but you can't escape that if you want to have a good brunch in SF.", "author": "Stephanie G."}

I should also note that I almost never rate a place 5 stars based on a first time visit, but Plow was so freakin' good, that I feel confident in giving them 5 shiny stars.\n\nEverything at Plow tasted just as good as it looked.\n\nStandouts included:\n+Lemon Ricotta Pancakes (house made ricotta, lemon zest, pure maple syrup) \n+Tinga (chicken in tomato chipotle sauce, two crispy corn tortillas, avocado, creme fraiche, cilantro)\n+Crispy Potatoes\n\nMid-conversation, my friend let out a big 'MMMM!!!!\" when he bit into his pancakes. I couldn't have agreed more! \n\nI like the fact that they work w/ local purveyors such as Frog Hollow Farms, Cowgirl Creamery, Monterey Fish Co, Acme Bread & Tcho Chocolate. When you see that they work w/ such local all-stars, you know you're in for a treat. I also really enjoyed Plow's Equator coffee while I waited for our table. And that wait was long! We came in at 11:30 am and had to wait an hour until we were seated. Normally I'd shoot for a much earlier brunch time to avoid the wait, but given that I was prepared for a leisurely Sunday brunch, the wait was pretty painless.\n\nI love the ambiance of this place. It's small, but w/ their high ceilings and all the light that shines in from their big windows, they're able to make the space work; especially decorated in its rustic, modern, simplistic fashion. I love their signage, logo and menu- all well done. They also have stool seating where you can watch the chefs work their magic (like we did!)\n\nThe host was cool and our server efficient. Parking was ample (not surprising for Portrero Hill ) and diners seemed to be all SF locals. \n\nLooking forward to coming back to Plow ASAP to try their Fried Egg Sandwich, The Plow (two eggs, choice of Nueske bacon, house made pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage, two pancakes & crispy potatoes), and/or a Chocolate Eclair.\n\nThis place makes me thankful for SF's amazing food scene!", "author": "Tiffany M."}

As expected, a cool new place on the hill attracts the crowds, so you would expect to wait a while for a seat. I waited 45 minutes for a seat at the counter facing the kitchen, totally worth it though. These people work their butts off, and it is amazing to watch.\n\nI got the pulled pork sandwich, which was really quite good. It's not roli roti, but it's close, and it was a very generous sized serving of that magical animal. It came with a side of potatoes that were the real magic. The waiter offered ketchup, but it really wasn't necessary. They seem to be boiled, then half squashed, and then deep fried and seasoned, giving them a half crispy half fluffy texture. So tasty!\n\nThey were already at 4+ stars when I tasted the lemon curd tart, which was perfection.\n\nSo in summary, this place is worth a visit, especially if you don't mind killing time waiting for the table by drinking some coffee from Farleys.

The restaurant offers a slew of other items, but I can never convince myself to try anything else.  The meal never disappoints and the best part I must say are the potatoes.  Twice fried and tossed with some herbs, need I say more?  My bf loves the lemon ricotta pancakes and they are definitely the perfect size given the amount of food you get.  This time, we decided to order the Huckleberry Coffee Cake to share as well.  It was only okay for me.  The cake had a different texture than typically coffee cake (more spongy versus crumbly) and I was expecting something different.  We had to wait a good while to get our main dishes, so our waitress was nice enough to comp us on the coffee cake.

Don't expect to get there and be seated right away. It's that popular! Also make sure that your whole party is there. They won't sit you until then. \nNone of these are negative traits, it's a part of business and a place so popular it's completely understandable. \n\nNow the food! I had the Plow which has eggs, crispy home fries (really good and actually crispy), pancakes and pork sausage. Everything was cooked to perfection except the pancakes. They were slightly burned on the outside so the burnt flavor overpowered them. Sad but still nice on the inside. \n\nWe sat outside and it was a little cold so our food got colder faster but it was still nice to be outside. Ask for a blanket if you're too cold.

The stools move with ease if you are a body builder and the space between diners is aggressive on the part of who determined to pack us in.  The healthy options are scarce.  you may think that all the green lettuces etc make this healthy however if you look closely, its an overpriced diner.  \nGeneric eggs (meaning not organic or free range,)non organic avocados etc, the perks of sitting at the counter where you see all their food still in their store bought containers and or with their store bought stickers still on them.  Not just a tell tale sign of their purchase decisions but also makes you wonder why they dont transfer their food into chef/kitchen containers to at least hide the fact that they are cheap in the food they buy and serve.  \nThe other \"perk\" of sitting at the counter is watching the cooks BAREHANDED make the salads and then scoop up the greens and barehanded plate it.  Yes, I know, some think that wearing gloves is a thing of the past and I could get behind that if the cooks did not have BLACK DIRT UNDER THEIR NAILS.  WE CANCELLED OUR SALAD ORDER AFTER SEEING THAT.  I mean, that was gross.\nNo dairy free options, no soy milk (laughable since even diners now carry soy milk), no maple syrup for the oatmeal but you can have brown sugar which is worse than white sugar.\nWe wish we had not gone and were speaking about how at least the coffee tasted good when my my male pal in crime (already needing chiropractor from having to stay tiny so the people on either side of him didnt feel scrunched)  suggested we ask if its organic and then we both decided not to ask as I think we knew the answer and needed to salvage one thing from the place.", "author": "Kate S."}

My friends got the Plow special (eggs, bacon, lemon ricotta pancakes, potatoes) and the biscuits and gravy. We all gobbled all of our food - everyone agreed everything was delicious all around. My only real complaint is that my salad was very over-dressed. (Why do restaurants put so much dressing on salads??) My friend who ordered the biscuits and gravy said the gravy was super (too) buttery and a bit too rich. But hey, it's sausage gravy.\n\nAlso - we didn't order the fruit on the side but we should have when we saw our table neighbors'. They had gala apple and asian pear slices, fuyu persimmon slices, and half of a mango, cubed. It looked AWESOME. 1000% better than the gross melon-pineapple-grape combo with maybe a single strawberry on it that you usually see at a brunch place. \n\nI'd definitely come back here.

Starting from the friendly host who seated us to the owner (the husband, the wife is the main chef busy cooking), our waitress, the ambience, the vibrant energy at the restaurant and the food.  It's a great place for breakfast, lunch and brunch!\n\nThe menu looked interesting to me.  Immediately the Crispy Pig Ears on the menu caught my eyes.  I rarely see this dish on a western restaurant's menu and was curious about the dish so I ordered it.  I liked it a lot!  It tastes almost like fried pork chops or salt and pepper pork chops except they served this dish with vinegar.  It was tasty.  I would go back just for this dish. But try it only if you are a food adventurer.\n\nThen we ordered an orange scone to savor prior to our brunch.  It's warm therefore tasted good, but for some reason it didn't \"wow\" me.  My friend on the other hand was crazy in love with it.  \n\nI ordered the Plow from the brunch menu.  I LOVE the 2 miniture pancakes made with the cottage cheese!  They tasted really good!  It also comes with your choice of egg style.  I asked for sunny and they were good.  There are also multiple choices of meats you can chose for Plow and I decided to try their homemade sausage.  That was a bit disappointing.  I like my sausage juicy and tender, but they were dry and too dense to me.  The flavor was delicious.  One last thing worth mentioning is their potatoes.  They are really good!  I'm not a big fan of potatoes, but I finished all the potatoes given on my plate.  They were crispy and flavorful!  Delicious!  I would go back for the potatoes and the pancakes as well!\n\nThen I think we also tried their cremebulee, but can't remember much.  I'm not sure if I was in food coma already that's why I don't remember or it wasn't memorable.  I will have to try it again next time I go to Plow and share with you later.  \n\n\nGive Plow a try!", "author": "Gina W."}

She offered to go fetch the friend herself, and when that was declined then she explained that she had to give it to us instead.\nI was impressed.\n\nThe room is quite charming- a great pale sage green, tons of light, great Tolex chairs & stools, lovely views from every window.

Our gluttonous bellies were full and satisfied when we left.

The stated 45 minute wait for two people became a bit over an hour, which is ok; the ebb and flow of restaurant traffic can't be predicted sometimes. By the time we sat down, we were understandably ravenous and wired from a couple cups of coffee in line. It took ten minutes for our server to get to us, and once we ordered, it was clear that everything was going to come out together 25-30 minutes later. We managed to get our fruit plate out early, but after waiting 90 minutes, we wish the food would have been paced better to get some of our sides out.

This was not cheap as the price of admission was $15.75, but it didn't fail to satisfy. The potatoes were some of the best I've had in the city, super crispy and salty. The eggs were scrambled to perfection and the pancakes may have been the highlight here. And the bacon, was well bacon. You can't really go wrong with bacon. All in all, the entire experience was enjoyable and the waitress even prevented my from getting a parking ticket as halfway through the meal she warned me there was street sweeping.

We sat at the counter and had the opportunity to observe the incredibly hard-working crew of three young cooks, their movements as choreographed as Bolshoi dancers, as they cooked everything fresh and perfect.

I saw that Plow had received three stars and having long been on my \"to-try\" places, I decided no better time than the present (especially considering the wait would considerably be less at 8:30am than later in the day).\n\nTurns out, there was no wait at all!  We got the last two counter seats offering excellent views of the dishes.  \n\nAlthough I am definitely more savory than sweet when it comes to taste, I couldn't pass up the chance to try the famous lemon ricotta pancakes.  They were so airy and light and fortunately not too sweet at all.  Not sure what the batter secret is but I can understand the hype.  That being said, I couldn't help but crave some of the savory options that I passed up (especially the savory bread pudding, which looked amazing!)\n\nAlso had the fried egg sandwich served with frisee and optional order of bacon.  While simple in execution, it was quite delicious and served on a lightly toasted bun.  The accompanying crunchy potatoes tossed with herbs and spices were excellent.\n\nI can see why this place gets packed (in fact, we apparently beat the rush as a wait began almost immediately after we were seated).  Crazy how people flock to this Potrero Hill outpost ... the power of good reviews, I guess.\n\nThe one BIG minus here is the smell of the water glasses.  It reeks of egg protein.  I know that some people can't smell it but for those that are sensitive to it, it's almost enough to make one lose his appetite.  The problem is that these glasses are placed in the dishwasher with all the plates that had contained egg yolk and it mixes.  It would be great if they could wash these separately or at least pre-wash those egg-tainted plates.\n\nService is very friendly and welcoming.   Note, not recommended for large groups because of limited seating (in fact, 6 is the max).", "author": "F. P."}

We have waited 1+ hours to snag a table here, but it was truly worth it.  Now this husband and wife team used to work at the beloved 42 Degrees, way back when.  Fast forward 15 years, they have taken over a lovely, light-filled space on Potrero Hill.  Nothing fancy, but clean, modern, yet comfortable.  You can't help but smile even after you waited outside for an hour.  It's a cheery spot.  And that's before you take your first bite of food!\n\nWe usually order The Plow, which is a short stack of lemon-ricotta pancakes, choice of bacon or sausage, and two eggs.  Now let's talk about the potatoes for a second here.  These are the crowning glory of the place.  They literally make the experience unforgettable.  I'm not a chef, but I do cook some and it seems to me the yukon gold potatoes are fried once, smashed by hand, seasoned with salt, pepper and herbs, and then fried again to a crispy, golden brown.  I am not doing them justice thru my description.  Go ahead, wait an hour on the sidewalk and tell me these don't make you do cartwheels.  They're that crazy good.\nThe coffee is strong, dark, the juices freshly squeezed, the breads are artisan.  Service is so friendly, so congenial, that if they spilled my potatoes on the floor, I would still give them a warm hug.  Assuming of course, I get a fresh plate of these beauties.\n\nI have yet to venture out and try their fried chicken sandwich, although just sighting it, it looks like it has a strong chance to be a contender against the fried chicken sandwich at Bakesale Bettys or Marlowe's.  \n\nAnother unfortunate another minus (along with the wait) is the lack of a full bar.

I was tired of greasy spoons that serve overcooked eggs in pools of canola oil.  Sometimes, you want to wake up and have some clean, fresh breakfast eggs and potatoes and you don't want to carry it around with you all day!\n\nI went here with a big group of 8 last weekend and considering how small plow is, they were quite happy and willing to accommodate us as soon as they could (which on a beautiful Sunday took about 20 minutes).\n\nThe food is delicious.  We tried almost everything.  The breakfast basket had a warm, savory corn millet muffin that melted in my mouth.  The jams were particularly tasty as well.  The orange scone and buttermilk thingy had just the right amount of sweetness - I hate overly sugary scones!\n\nWe also got quite a few salads - now somewhere in the review list a person was freaking out about rotten greens.  In my experience, we got EVERY kind of salad and there was NO ROTTEN greens.  The arugula had dressing on it, but it was fantastic and complemented the persimmons perfectly.\n\nOther highlights - the fried egg sandwich. It's huge, and when you bite into it, the yolk pours out.  Mmmmm.  The french toast and market omelette were fresh and tasty.  The housemade sausage patties were perfectly cooked.  And the pumpkin pancakes made me want to do a backflip.  Of course, our plow dish was filling and fun.  I love eating eggs, potatoes, and pancakes all in one!  And they're mini-pancakes so you're not overly stuffed.\n\nFinally, we got this pumpkin cheesecake at the end. Normally, I don't like cheesecake because it's too rich and sweet, but this one had cream and pumpkin spice that blended just right.  It was all, I'll say it again, delicious.\n\nMy final say is that if you're looking for a greasy spoon, this is not the place for you.  But if you're looking for a clean, fresh breakfast/brunch with top-of-the-line ingredients (they even list the farms/food places they get their ingredients from at the bottom of the menu), then go to plow!

Then we got our food, they shorted my son an egg and there was a generous slathering of butter on our toast. We don't eat cow body fluids, they make us sick. Not having much time left before work, we just finished the rest of our breakfast without complaint. I left my son to pay the bill and I walked up the hill to get our car. The bill was $50. Kind of expensive for eggs even with one drink each. Later I started feeling unwell and was wondering (not sure why I did not think of it at the time I was drinking it) if my drink was poured from the same containers as my son's and if there was bug larvae swimming around in my stomach. Those concerns and the expensive bill caused me to e-mail the restaurant and ask. I got a call from someone from the Plow and after convincing him that I was not my mother (she lives in Texas???) he gave me some mealymouthed excuses about how the bug could have only come from inside the clean glass and not the champagne or orange juice. I just don't believe him, bugs like food not glass. Anyway, he said they were sorry. I guess that's taking responsibility nowadays. I say skip this one and go to anyone of a hundred other places who serve a better, cleaner, bug free and less expensive breakfast.", "author": "Mike E."}

Although he's no longer with us, I'm thankful he indirectly lured me to plow, as it was an excellent choice and I can see why he used to love coming here.\n\nWe arrived a little after 11 on a Sunday for brunch, which led to an hour-and-a-half wait -- and turned out to be completely worthwhile. When I entered the crowded doorway of this intimate space, I was promptly greeted by the incredibly gracious and cool host/front-of-house manager. Great start. A friendly, genuine smile can go a long way.\n\nThey had some coffee sitting out, to which we helped ourselves, under the impression that it was complimentary for waiting customers. Unfortunately, we misunderstood and were charged $2.75 a piece for batch drip coffee we had to serve to ourselves, and I did not get offered a mug or replenishment of my cup once seated. The coffee was excellent, and ultimately I didn't really mind paying for it, but I just wish it had been more clearly marked as something that would be added to the bill. But that was really the only downside to the experience, and in the end, the overall quality of service and food made up for it. Oh, and bonus points for the dual-flush, water-saving toilet in the restroom.\n\nAnyway, back to the food: I had the egg sandwich -- two eggs, arugula and cheddar on an Acme bun. Delicious. The bun was grilled to perfection, and the eggs were prepared perfectly. The potatoes that accompanied the sandwich were also incredibly good; very crispy on the outside, and soft in the middle, with mildly caramelized onions. Yum.\n\nIt's rare that I make the trek out to Potrero Hill, but because of plow, I may need to come out more regularly.", "author": "Jamie T."}

By the looks of it, we arrived just in time because we only had to wait a few minutes for a table. The restaurant is very small, but laid out as smartly as possible, with an open kitchen, counter seating, and lots of small tables with just enough space for the waitstaff to navigate. I didn't even notice the hostess, who was standing directly behind me, until she offered us a cup of coffee while we waited. This was one of many nice service-related touches at Plow. That said, the waiting area is small and not especially comfortable. So be early, or dress appropriately. Even on the inside, the entire restaurant suffered a little whenever someone opened the door.\n\nOnce seated, table service was fast and friendly. Our waitress, dressed to the nines in the finest vintage apparel, gave us the quick walkthrough of the menu. We each opted for the restaurant's namesake breakfast. It arrived not long after: Two incredible-looking plates of breakfast: poached eggs, a short stack of lemon-ricotta pancakes, bacon (for her), sausage (for me), and smashed potatoes / homefries. The pancakes were the best. They were light, not too sweet, and tart. The poached eggs and my wife's bacon were very good, too.  Unfortunately the sausage disappointed a little, and while my potatoes were great, my wife's were underseasoned. \n\nGiven the service and the pancakes, I'm tempted to give plow my full recommendation. However, the coldness (not sure there's much  to do about that), the blandness of the sausage, and the inconsistency in the potatoes forces me to hold back a little. Still an excellent place and one that I'd love to revisit if I happen to be in San Francisco any time soon.", "author": "Joel R."}

I came here jet lagged after getting off a trans-pacific flight, looking for a satisfying meal that features fresh ingredients.  Plow did the job for sure.  \n\nI had \"the plow\" there for $13 -  \"two eggs, choice of Nueske bacon, house made pork sausage, or chicken apple sausage, 2 pancakes, and crispy potatoes.\"  I saw the Chinese sausage there on the menu, and they allowed me to substitute that for my sausage choice.  The food came relatively quick, presented nicely on a white plate.  The server was very attentive and nice while conscious of not being bothersome.  \n\nOverall, Plow is a place that I'd come back to as well as recommend to my friends.

It was neat to see how they cooked everything.  We started off with the monkey bread and it tasted just like cinnamon buns, just not as sweet and without the sugary frosting spread all on it.  I got \"the plow\", which came with scrambled eggs, their homemade pork sausage, lemon ricotta pancakes and crispy potatoes.  The homemade pork sausage was slightly spicy with really good flavor, while the pancakes were super soft and tasty.  I liked how they were mini pancakes and not the huge ones you'd get at like IHOP/Denny's.  The crispy potatoes were a little too salty for me, but my bf liked them.  I might have been able to eat the whole plate of food if it weren't for the monkey bread, but I did find many couples sharing the plow, if the other person ordered something small.  My bf got the fried egg sandwich that came with two eggs fried, cheddar, frisee, aioli, crispy potatoes  and Nueske bacon.  It looked good, and was an adequate sized sandwich.  I was tempted to order their organic yogurt with granola and mixed fruit, but felt I needed to order something more substancial since it was our first time here.  Plus, you can make that at home.\n\nOverall, one of the better brunch places I've been to and will surely come back for more.", "author": "Joycelyn L."}

Mainly because they were always so busy, but we took this as a good sign. \nWe stopped by this morning. We were there by 8:15 and it was a Wednesday, so we were seated right away. We also took this as a good sign. But, as is so often the case with small neighborhood restaurants (even the ones with great food) the service was the downfall. Although we were seated right away and we were asked if we would like coffee (we both said \"yes, please\") the coffee didn't come until much later and we had to ask again.\nThen several parties arrived after us, were also seated right away, and then had their orders taken before we did. After several attempts to make eye contact, I finally called out to the waitress (she had her back to us and was folding napkins) and I said \"Could we place our order?\" She stared at me blankly and said \"Oh, she just got busy.\" and gestured toward the other waitress. After she left, my husband said \"There are still 5 empty tables in here and two waitresses. I hate to see what the service is like when there is a line outside, 'cause this really isn't busy!\"\nMaybe they were short-staffed and we should give them the benefit of the doubt, but we are pretty patient people and it just seemed ridiculous.\nThe food itself was good. I mean it is breakfast, nothing too difficult! As other people have posted the potatoes that are served on the side are probably the best I have ever had. So that was slightly uplifting. But honestly at 34.05 for two people for eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes with coffee, I think we will stick with the Just for you Cafe on 22nd!", "author": "Alyssa A."}

But when the food is as kind to my stomach as the owners are to my spirit, I can't wait to say a nice thing or two.\n\nI'll say up front that a friend of mine is friends with the owner, so we got a little special service, like Randall, the adorable host, who brought us coffee (coffee, which btw, will make your spoon straighter than a guy from  Marin), and then they brought us complimentary fried donut holes/beignets. I never knew something fried could taste so...healthy.\n\nI had the egg sandwich. To be honest, I think I make a little bit meaner one at home, and maybe since Joel, the owner, is so nice here, I'll give him my recipe.\n\nAnd about that Joel. What a gem! Not only did he instruct me on how to make their INCREDIBLE house potatoes (truly, these potatoes are the crispy breakfast potatoes to end all breakfast potatoes), but he let me know to use rice bran oil (what the use in the fryer at Plow) or peanut oil rather than olive oil (which smokes the oven at high temps), but he checked on us throughout the meal and made sure that his friend (my friend) and the four of us weren't too cold (we were sitting by the front door) and that our coffees were always topped.\n\nAt the end of the meal, Joel extended his kindness one step further. He took care of the bill. Now this had nothing to do with the fact that I said I'd write him a review, and only had to do with the fact that one of my breakfast mates was his good friend and was babysitting for him that night, but that is a forgotten art and was a classy move on his part.\n\nNot only do I love the atmosphere, the style of the place, the natural light. But also the hooks for your purse under the counter. And how you can watch the magic cooking by the guys in the kitchen. And that your coffee is always topped like in the best little roadside diner. And that they'll even hang your coat. Yes, you will have to wait a long time, but you will get a breakfast that you will crave and service with so many smiles. And the potatoes...oh, those potatoes.

It was served on sliced Acme bread with thick shards of aged cheese and greens.  The menu had said it was served on an English muffin; I welcomed the alternative.  Not a bad deal for $7 (more if you get bacon).  The best part, though, was the potatoes on the side.  They hand crush cooked potatoes, deep fry them, and toss them with salt and herbs.  Great crispy texture.  \n\nWifey got the granola with fruit and house-made yogurt.  The fruit was figs and cantaloupe.  She opted against figs and asked for alternate fruit.  They could not offer any, and just doubled up on the cantaloupe.  No big deal until we noted they were slicing up juicy apples to top a salad on the menu.  It would have been nice if they'd offered her apples as a fig alternate.  Oh well.  She enjoyed it nonetheless.

We stepped in at about 9 and were promptly seated in the most quaint and lovely Farmhouse-esque setting. Beautiful wooden tables, great large windows for viewing clean little Potreo Hill. \n\nEnough about that fluff. The vitals. So gorgeous in it's simplicity, so delicious in literally every bite. The menu is small, but crafted in such a way that anyone could find something to fit their tastes to a tee. For me? The Plow. \n\nThis includes your choice of breakfast meat, 2 eggs any way, potatoes and pancakes. Sounds like a standard from anywhere. But here, that's just not fair nor accurate. Those eggs, so fresh, that bacon - so full of actual ham flavor - but those potatoes. NO ONE does potatoes correctly when eating out. They need to be tender inside, extremely crispy outside and have the right amount of seasoning, no grease and if you're lucky, accompanied by great caramelized onions. I thought only my Mom could make this magic. She must have divulged her secret to the Chefs at Plow. Never were potatoes so right OUTSIDE of my Mother's kitchen. \nLet's not though, forget those pancakes. These are light, airy, moist. These are LEMON. Lemon ricotta pancakes that are so subtle and meek in their own little corner of your plate, you would never expect them to absolutely wow you, as they are certain to do. \n\nPeople are funny about their breakfasts, they all know what's the best and where to get said \"best,\" but unless they are speaking of Plow, they are just wrong. \n\nHowever, maybe they are smarter than me and telling you other places to go so as not to form a line at Plow... \nshit.", "author": "Katie W."}

I think that the food there is great and well executed when it is available.  On my last visit my friend and I had been seated and it took a little while for someone to come over to the table. Enough time had passed before someone greeted us that we had already decided on what we wanted.  Like previous visits they were out and failed to tell us until after we ordered our food.  I can understand that popularity of certain dishes can cause a shortage, but when a place is out of 3 items on the menu it just looks bad. We were there at 10:30am, not even late into the afternoon so it was a bit frustrating. I feel like I've given this place enough tries and decided to not return.

Then we got seated and literally 20 mins later we finally get the waitress over so we can order. Ok, already unsatisfied with how long we had to wait for the waitress to take our order, it took another 45 mins to get our food. We were disappointed and unsatisfied at that point. I honestly don't remember what my friend and boyfriend ordered but I had the Lemon Ricotta pancakes - it was OK, the first pancake was full of flavor (very good), then the next 2 tasted like plain pancakes... i paid $10.00 for one good pancake and bad service. What a bad experience overall. The table next to us did not even get their food after our food came and they came in around the same time as us.

The simple menu and ambiance are a refreshing change form most overcrowded restaurants and over processed foods. I went on a bright and warm SF morning for brunch. I expected the ait to be long based on the previous reviews I read while I was browsing through on my phone. My part and I were offered coffee during our wait. We were seated about 45 minutes after our arrival. We opted to eat outside on account of the beautiful day. We were handed menu but waited an additional 20-25 minutes until our order was actually taken. I ordered 'The Plow' with bacon and added eggs and denied the toast and pancakes to fit my diet. My friends and I chit chat and it took absolutely forever to actually get our meals. I want to say it was at least 30 minutes, either way it was enough time for me to get borderline 'slap a b**ch I'm so hungry' crazy.\n\nI wasn't crazy about my food. My scrambled eggs were overcooked and I thought I could have at least gotten a few more pieces of bacon.

First, we were a party of three that was seated at a table that only comfortably seats two.  Other parties of three who were in line behind us for the first seating at 8am were seated at tables that could seat 4.  Why were we discriminated against?  Now for the food.  I ordered the egg scramble with goat cheese, oyster mushroom, and nettles.  The eggs were watery, the nettles and mushrooms were stringy and tough.  There were clumps of goat cheese throughout.  The worst about the eggs was that it was extremely salty.  It was impossible to eat and I left 3/4 of the eggs  on my plate.  My husband ordered the Plow which was edible.  The bacon came out all clumped together as if the cook had just thrown it on the plate.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were heavy.  As you can tell, we will not be back.

You've nailed the egg sandwich, the riccota pancakes, and the dungeness crab omelette. No easy feat, and done well over time. Kudos are in order. I rate Plow as the best breakfast per se in SF.\n\nThe downside is fame. People lined up, willing to wait for an hour or two for breakfast. One waits forever in the wind to sit and then you are informed that you may be seated at the bar or the communal table. Plow, some of us are not chatty for breakfast. Give us a choice of tables, not a choice to wait yet longer for a table.\n\nAcknowledge that this is the priciest breakfast around. Yes, the food is exemplary, but no attitude, please. Serve re-fills of coffee without being chased down, check that all is ok with the meal, and go the extra mile for your customer. We wait, we pay a gazillion dollars for pancakes, so make it a dining experience. Slow down to 95 mph. \n\nHere you are, at a crossroads. Don't coast on fame, please. Think about the experience and not just the food. You won't get away with not caring about your customer. \n\nWe, your public, are rooting for you. We want you to be as good each time we visit you.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-02-03", "description": "I came to Plow today with a friend after having been told this was probably one of the best brunch places in the city. In spite of being Superbowl Sunday, we still wound up waiting about an hour to sit at the bar, which wasn't really a big deal as all good brunches places force you to suffer hunger for extra time before allowing you to indulge.  We both ordered the Plow, which is their little-bit-of-everything (2 eggs, meat of your choice, potatoes and 2 lemon ricotta pancakes).  I actually asked to switch the potatoes for a slice of French toast, which I think is somewhat unheard of given the confusion it caused the line cooks (who we were watching the entire time).  The service is top notch, as our waitress caught the cooks on a couple occasions to make sure the plates came out as ordered.  The pancakes were fresh but didn't really taste strongly of lemon and were underwhelming, which made me glad that I had solid-but-not-spectacular french toast to compensate.  The house-made pork sausage was decent but could've used a much heavier hand of sage to make it really like breakfast sausage (for those of you who don't like the flavor of breakfast sausage, then this is perfect for you).  I stole a piece of potato from my friend, which was essentially smashed (as opposed to cut) potatoes thrown into a deep fryer to attain great crispy texture throughout.  Overall the ambience is clean and comfortable, and I wasn't feeling overly greased from the meal (always a good thing).  I'll be back to order other things off the menu next time (they look like they put a ton of Dungeness crab into their scrambled eggs), but I'm also still on the look-out for a better brunch place in SF.", "author": "Gene C."}

I made the short trip up the hill and stopped at the restaurant with a pig on its sign. What I found was the BEST breakfast food that I've ever had.\n     The \"plow\" breakfast was great. The home-made pork sausage was juicy, well-spiced, and well cooked. The mini lemon ricotta pancakes (I really do mean mini) had a nice crisp on the edges with a creamy center. The lemon flavor was bold without being overpowering. My eggs were cooked to my liking. But the star of this dish was the crispy potatoes. MAN these are GOOD. They grill moderate sized potatoes with onions, smash the potatoes, deep fry them, and toss them in salt and thyme. You get a hybrid concoction of homefries with the crisp of hashbrowns. VERY GOOD.\n     The tuna sandwich is hands down the BEST I've ever had. The tuna is tossed in olive oil, lightly salted, mixed with capers,  and extremely fresh. The boquerones (white anchovies in olive oil and vinegar) added an extra dimension of flavor to the sandwich. Add a little hard boiled egg and put it on bread from Acme, and you have a Masterpiece.\n     Unfortunately the portion sizes are bad. I can't really \"plow\" into a breakfast plate when there is not much food on it. I love eating and I'm willing to spend top dollar for top food. However, I feel that I should've been more satisfied after signing the check. It was really disappointing to watch the line cook throw a pile of crispy potatoes onto a plate only to have the head chef take some off and throw it back into the mixing bowl. The poor form ruined what was otherwise an AMAZING dining experience.", "author": "Siao W."}

Yesterday, we had a full day of activities planned and had to be out and about early anyway, so I thought why not make the most of a Saturday morning and make a trip to Plow for breakfast?\n\nWe got there a little before 9:30 and there was already a wait, but the host assured us it would only be a 15-20 minute wait.  In the meantime, he offered us coffee. Such a small and simple gesture, but always appreciated! Exactly 20 minutes later, we were seated at the counter where we could check out all the cooking action in the small, open kitchen.  It made it so hard to decide what to get because everything coming out looked so damn good. \n\nSo I decided on the plow, which was kinda like their combo breakfast with eggs, bacon or sausage, potatoes, and lemon ricotta pancakes! Hubby took a bit longer to decide and finally went with the plow as well.  I got the bacon and hubby got the home made sausage patties. The food took about 15 minutes to come out because the kitchen was so busy.  There were 3 people in the kitchen and they were hustling nonstop. Finally the food came out and it was worth the wait! My scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly, nice and delicate.  The bacon was good but I wish it was a little bit crispier. The potatoes were awesome.  They were so crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  They were also perfectly seasoned and mixed with sauteed onions.  With a little bit of ketchup, we were all set.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious, so soft, fluffy, and lemony, and came with a side of maple syrup.  I tried the homemade sausage and loved it.  They were so flavorful with all the herbs and spices.  Next time, I am so getting the sausage patties! \n\nWe had such a good meal here.  Not only was the food so delicious, but everyone there was so friendly and nice.  I loved their decor, so simple and bright with huge windows.  It just felt like a pleasant place to spend your weekend morning.  The great thing about sitting at the counter was that we got to see all the different stuff they had, so we had good ideas about what to order next time.  I was definitely intrigued by the fried pig ears! I know it sounds weird but they looked so good - light and crispy with what looked like a side of jalapeno vinaigrette.  Oh and I must have the chocolate eclair.  So many things to try next time.  I guess I'll need to plan another early morning to go to Plow again!", "author": "Kat M."}

I owe my discovery of this little slice of awesome to a friend who shares my love of simple food made impeccably. I have never tried to test the waters on a weekend but I can say mid-morning and lunchtime during the week likely offer up the best time to sample the fare with minimal wait.  I highly recommend sitting at the bar at least once, its always fun to watch the food come together.\n\nThe food here is solidly good. Lunch offerings are usually a few salads and sandwiches, and breakfast staples are in circulation all day, assuming they have not run out.  My first trip resulted in a so-so salad, and a pretty awesome lamb sandwich.  I have tried the breakfast potatoes which do indeed put all other potatoes to shame.  The scramble is a little slice of heaven, as is the homemade yogurt, be sure to try it.  \n\nIf you are looking for well made, simple, wholesome, locally sourced, organic eats in a wonderfully inviting and warm atmosphere then check this place out.  Plus, the owners are a husband and wife who can be found making food in the kitchen and helping visitors to their table. Well worth a try!", "author": "Jenny E."}

It looked modern but homey and like something definitely worth a try but...that line! On any given weekend morning there will be a crowd of people hanging out outside. I started resenting Plow for taunting me with its newness while shutting me out with it's dreadful long lines. \"It's already over-hyped,\" I secretly thought to myself. Anyway, I finally bit the bullet and tried it out last weekend. The wait time was 45 minutes for a table for three. Ugh. They offer complementary coffee inside to soften the pain of waiting but it runs out quickly and people inside are too busy to keep it replenished. It is probably good business for Farley's, the coffee shop up the street.\n\nAnyway, we finally got seated and I have to say the ambiance is simple but nice. It's going for a clean rustic vibe to go along with it's philosophy of using local, seasonal, farm-fresh ingredients. I works for me. We shared the lemon ricotta pancakes. SUPER DELICIOUS. I got the Plow breakfast plate (I think that was the name) which included eggs, potatoes, and two pancakes. Even though it's a pretty standard dish it just tasted better than I expected. The potatoes are crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and tossed with just the right amount of salt and some nice onions too. The freshness of the ingredients really makes a difference. I tried my friend's egg benedict with spinach and mushrooms and it was cooked to perfection. All our food was seemingly simple but wonderfully delicious and memorable. The nuances of the fresh ingredients really make all the difference in the flavors in the dishes. I felt totally satisfied but not overly stuffed nor heavy after my meal at Plow.

Service was professional, fun and friendly. Everything was clean, and I mean even the water was filtered and the glasses and silverware were spotless. Food was perfectly executed. I had the two eggs - comes with sausage, potatoes, toast. Partner had the scramble of the day. We also ordered a biscuit, which came with local Potrero Hill honey - highly recommended. Coffee was a yummy dark roast from Equator, good enough that we plan to hunt the beans down ourselves, and service was prompt about refilling. The best part was the price: very reasonable for the quality, service and atmosphere.

Im afraid to write this review because I know once I start talking about the amazing food Im definitely going to be craving it. First off, I am a breakfast potato FREAK. I literally found this restraunt by searching 'best breakfast potatoes' on yelp. And oh man did this place deliver! They are so good that I even order and extra side of them with my breakfast. I order the fried egg sandwhich with bacon every time I go and it is always cooked to perfection. My sister has had the pumpkin pancakes and my friend always gets the lemon pancakes and they both said they are excellent. I make it a point to go to this place EVERY time im in SF. Parking is always easy and there is a liquor store right across the street to get some 'beverages' while you wait outside. The wait is usually pretty long, Ive gone almost every day of the week and on weekends and its always pretty much the same but they do their best to get you seated quickly.

We had the granola with yogurt and fresh seasonal fruit (ordered for my 2-year-old daughter), which was delicious and not too sweet since the yogurt was homemade and plain. My husband had the pork chop, eggs, and potatoes, which he said were delicious. My friend also loved her egg sandwich, which was on a brioche-type bread (can't remember exactly what the menu said). I had the vegetarian omelette which was made with mushrooms, leeks, and a little bit of cheese. It was just right- not greasy or runny and just the right amount of vegetables/cheese. The potatoes were awesome- just the right amount of seasoning and a little crunchy on the edges. I also had the decaf coffee which was really good too. A couple of us were thinking about getting the lemon ricotta pancakes while we were waiting because they looked so good coming out of the kitchen, but they were gone by the time we sat down to order. We got there during the last hour of brunch service, so get there earlier if you want to make sure you get some of the more popular menu items! The advantage to getting there later like we did was that we only had to wait 5 to 10 minutes for a table. As far as kid-friendly, I was pleasantly surprised- there was a kids menu which came with a few crayons to color on. They also had high chairs available. \nWe're definitely coming back to Plow.", "author": "Aimee L."}

The wait was definitely worth it. We split the dungeness crab scramble and the plow so we got to try a little of everything. While the freshly fried potatoes were shatteringly crisp and the sausage was well seasoned the star of the show was definitely the ricotta pancakes. I saved some of the pancakes for last but I really should have eaten it all when it first came out. Sitting on the plate, the pancakes lost some of the lightest and airiness from coming directly off the griddle. The brunch was really simple, well done and satisfying. Best yet I completely cleaned my plate but did not feel heavy or fall into a food coma. All in all it was a great way to start off a Sunday.

First off, It starts with the space itself, which was constructed in amazing taste. It has beautiful wood floors, long, large windows, and high ceilings, making the somewhat small space seem larger. \n\nThe food is also great. My wife and I tried a few things on the menu, from the perfectly-assembled fried egg sandwich (potatoes on the side are the best in the bay, hands down), to a surprisingly fresh and flavorful little gem salad, to some delectable sweet fritters that take you to the South, without weighing you down to much. We also had the lusciously textured lemon ricotta pancakes, browned perfectly, and light, and creamy at the same time. \n\nWe were lucky enough to sit at the bar, so we could look into the kitchen and watch everything being made. It all looked fantastic. Very fresh, very simple, and with only the best ingredients. I can't wait to go back and explore their menu a bit. \n\nOh yea, I was reading the one and two star reviews just a bit up from mine, and couldn't help feel sorry for these people.

We needed a local brunch hangout here badly.\n\nService was good, our waitress was attentive enough and was very pleasant. Host was nice and accommodating. \n\nWe ordered the frittata and enjoyed it. The side of potatoes were good. Coffee was good, although we had to ask for refill,but no big deal. \n\nHere is where the 2 rating comes from.....a combination of meh Ive had better frittatas  and the French toast. The menu said it came with creme fraiche but we didn't get any, the flamb\u00e9 bananas had the horrible gas inhaling flavor which was really unattractive. The little 1/2 ounce syrup they bring with it was barely enough for one of the slices so I asked for extra and they said \"that will be an extra $3.\" You shouldn't charge $9.95 for two slices of toast and a little bit of bananas and then another $3 for 1/2 ounce of syrup.   What upset me was that they barely give you any to start with so how are you gonna then charge me 3 dollars for another 1/2  ounce.   I can maybe see $1 for 1 ounce but even that's  ridiculous. I know maple syrup is not cheap but $3, come on man even for San fransisco standards that's a bit much. I think I will continue to drive to Mission Beach for future brunch events where they don't charge for extra on something as small as maple syrup. \n\nI have a feeling if they continue to charge extra for things that are pretty standard at other brunch places and their food is not that blown away good,they may not get a lot of business, but I hope it changes.", "author": "cacao r."}

The reason for -2 stars is this... partly the coffee, but mostly the fact that I showed up 10 minutes before 8am on a Saturday, on my BIRTHDAY, to get a table. And there was one, for 6 people, but you let 4 people sit there, because a few of the people from my group were still packing their things to get to the airport... and they arrived at the restaurant before anyone who had been seated had ordered anything. I understand you are a small operation, but to not be friendly at all, to not only make us wait when we shouldn't have had to, to not offer us a cup of coffee, to not try to accomodate us (oh, you want to sit outside on a sunny day? Maybe we should move the tables? Ooooh...) is just kind of... annoying. I just had higher hopes... Ruby Wine was so nice, but both seem to cater to the Potrero stereotype of middle-aged and wealthy... I guess if you are a 20-something graduate student (nicely dressed, thank you) you aren't worth paying attention to. I'm sad, because the food was so great--- but the attitude and atmosphere will never bring me back, and recommending against this place in the future (sad also, since I live and work nearby). Oh well.", "author": "Amanda S."}

Best biscuits and gravy I've had in the Bay Area - flavorful rather than just salty gravy. Pleasant tasting lemon ricotta pancakes. I'd stay away from the cassoulet - it's the only bland offering.", "author": "Aiko S."}

As with any great breakfast spot with limited seating, the wait can be a little long depending on the time you come.  If you time it just right, or can be patient enough to enjoy the gorgeous views of the SF skyline, you will not be disappointed.  The food is spot-on and the service is fantastic.  The fried egg sandwich and the signature plow are both amazing!", "author": "Arash G."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-11-07", "description": "We ordered the Market Omelette with the side of Lemon Ricotta Pancake and Fried Egg Sandwich with bacon.  The crispy potatoes are a must try if it doesn't already come with your dish. My first taste of the pancake made me wished I had ordered the whole stack.  The sandwich looked really well put together.  I like the fact that they used frisee lettuce it holds up very well especially when the yolk is broken and all its gooey goodness gets all over them.  Everything was very well seasoned and I'm giving it 4 stars for overall quality of ingredients and taste.  With that said there is definitely room for improvement in the kitchen and in the service.  My omelette hardly had any mushrooms and I ended up eating 3/4 of it before I actually had any shiitake and sad to say the oyster mushrooms were no where to be found.  The staff was really friendly but need more attention to water and coffee refills.", "author": "Pamela M."}

Hands down, the BEST brunch ever in SF. My hubs & I grew up in the Bay Area & often go to SF for culinary adventures. We had a spontaneous New Years 2day adventure in SF and this was THE highlight. (Hey, we like food.) Hubs found it on Yelp - paying it forward, yes I am - and when we saw/read their website, we knew it was THE brunch place for us. Worth the 20min wait (altho' I can see it being longer at times). I had the egg sandwich (all about that cheese) and a side of 1 lemon ricotta pancake - which also came with those yummy potatos. My hubs had The Plow - a little bit of everything. Their crispy potatoes are phenom. Their lemon ricotta pancakes are to die for. The rest all culminates together - the friendly service, the intimate ambiance, the very nice owners-couple, the other excited patrons, the location, the venue - to make for a perfect way to start off your day. If you live in, near or are planning a trip to SF, I can't recommend this place enough for brekkie, lunch or wkend brunch...Just be patient - grab a coffee down the block - as you may have to wait a few minutes. But I say it again - it's DEF worth the wait. I will be back. Soon, I hope.", "author": "Lulu B."}

However, to be fair, they did say it would be that long and we stuck it out.  It's nice to have someplace like this to walk to. There really isn't any place to wait inside but it was a lovely day and there is Farley's & Hazel's the next block up for coffee while you wait.  It's a beautiful looking place but not great for crowds, they just don't have the capacity for it.  They might be able to accommodate 6 but probably not more than that.  We got seated at the bar, I always find it fascinating to watch a kitchen staff work.  We ordered egg sandwich (me), lamb sandwich (the man) and the lemon ricotta pancakes (to share).  Our waiter was nice if a bit tentative.  Everything but the egg sandwich came out, after we realized it wasn't coming, we told him about it and he said they're working on it now.  Then we saw him talking to the kitchen staff about it a few minutes later when it still didn't come out.  He hadn't followed through with the kitchen about it.  It eventually came and it was quite good, though quite messy, but I've yet to eat an egg sandwich that wasn't messy.  He was quite apologetic though it would have been nice to have been comped for it or had our bill reduced in some way.  The lamb sandwich was fabulous, perfectly cooked lamb topped with salsa verde which gave it a wonderful bright herbally flavor with a nice garlic kick.  The lemon ricotta pancakes were lovely, so light with nicely done edges.  No, they aren't big but when they taste like this, who cares?  I usually have regret when I order pancakes because they're so dense but not this time.  Nits aside, we'll definitely go back, it's a great addition to the neighborhood.  They open for brunch at 8 am, to avoid a marathon wait I would strongly suggest going early or going later.  I may just have to try bribing the man with brunch to get him out of bed early.", "author": "Nicole B."}

My sister and I decide to have lunch one day and we found Plow and decided to try it. The waitresses seated some people before us but from the moment we walked in they didn't even acknowledge our existence! Seriously? No hi? The waitresses weren't even busy but my sister and I waited to be polite. So this older white guy walks in and in less then 5 mins he gets \"hi, what can I help you with?\" and tells him about 15 minsso I step in and say \"really? We been here for 15 mins and before him\" she says it will be 30 mins and I said then what about that guy. She says oh it will be 30 mins too. Really? I specifically heard you say 15 for him. And this WHOLE time there is a table for two. I don't care if the food is good if that's the service you going to get. Or is it because my sister and I are Asian? Thanks Plow for ruining my appetite!", "author": "Cristina M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-10-03", "description": "Great new neighborhood place on Potrero Hill, brought to us by  a couple who are Potrero Hill residents. Great space, love the big windows; I wish it were larger, but you work with what you have. My 6 yr old loved the lemon ricotta pancakes and defended his plate from parental poaching. You can taste the great ingredients and attention to detail in every bite. Loved the baked goods and especially the homemade jam. Highly recommend this place for a great breakfast. Be warned that there could be a wait since there was considerable pent-up demand for just such a restaurant on the Hill. I am looking forward to trying the lunch options sometime during the week when I can squeeze into a single place at the bar.", "author": "Abigail M."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2012-04-28", "description": "We waited the expected 30-45 minutes, which was OK, especially since it was a nice day. Didn't quite understand why it took 15 minutes to prepare the empty table we ended up sitting at, but they were busy, so this was understandable. My wife ordered the cake/pastry that was on the menu (sorry but don't remember the kind) and coffee and I ordered the fried egg sandwich and bacon. This didn't seem like a lot of food, but still took about 20 minutes to get. The cake was quite good and the potatoes that came with the fried egg sandwich were wonderful, as other reviewers have said. The problem was the sandwich itself. I didn't order it over hard but it seemed like it was about half yolk. At first I picked it up to eat as a sandwich and ended up with a river of yolk pouring out! The taste of the sandwich, eating it with a nice and fork after that, was quite good. So the overall experience for us was 3 stars or less. So if your prepared for the wait, possibly slow service, and the runny egg sandwich (or order it over hard) your experience should be better.  I must say that all the food that people were eating around us looked great.", "author": "Sandy S."}
