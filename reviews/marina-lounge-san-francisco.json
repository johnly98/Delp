The moment we entered the lady bartender asked for our ID's and stared at mine for the longest time. Lady, it's me. I was 16 when I took that picture...\n\nMy boyfriend asked what beers they had on tap (I forgot what she said) but when he asked for Stella she gave him one that was already poured for the girls next to us (they ended up canceling the order). He stared at her and gave her a \"where did this come from\" look since he didn't know and she told him with an attitude \"I JUST poured it. It's what you wanted.\" Okay.. I gave her the benefit of the doubt cause maybe she was having a rough night. BUT!! When my boyfriend pulled out his debit card she scoffed and said \"cash only. You can use the ATM at the end.\" Did everything coming out of her mouth need have attitude with it\n\nHe went to the Bank of America down the street and paid. I was people watching while he went to get cash and noticed the bartender would whisper to what seemed to be regulars at this bar (late 50s males) and they would stare at a specific group (mainly younger girls) then laugh with her. Kind of regret leaving her a tip for the service she gave us and for the potential shit talking she must've done to her customers. At least be discreet about it..", "author": "Cathy N."}

I was super lucky via my Yelp search and found Marina lounge. San Francisco was burning a massive hole in my wallet so I was ready for a place that didn't cave in to the ever so abundant 8$ beer. Marina had an awesome vibe, full of die hard locals that coveted their city sports teams and didn't scoff at the non-familiar faces walking in. My warm welcome may have been due to the fact that I exude a warmth towards the dive scene and telepathically projected my allegiance to this type of atmosphere. The walls were littered with photos of old, giving you plenty to look at in between conversation. The wall facing the street had a massive window allowing you to people watch as well. I may go so far as to say that Marina was one of my all time favorite bars in the city, and one that I will make a point to go to whenever I'm back in town and in need of a drink.....which is always.", "author": "Nick B."}

Even though they were here for a big family event in Oakland, they stayed in the city.  The night they got off the plane we planned to meet in the city for a few drinks.  The text message exchange went something like this.\n\nRelative: My cousins recommended that we go to the Marina Lounge, it's in this place called the Marina.\n\nMe: Sigh, I guess I'll have to wear my striped shirt.\n\nR: What?\n\nMe: Never mind, see you in 45 minutes.\n\nLook, we all have BlackBerries so we can text with perfect grammar and punctuation, okay?\n\nAfter donning a striped shirt, I arrived to the Marina Lounge from Oakland in around 45 minutes.  I proceeded to wait because my Canadian relatives got lost on the way to the Marina.\n\nStill, being alone wasn't bad at all.  I was able to soak in the bar.  This place is about as un-Marina as any place in the Marina can get.  Sure, most of the men there were wearing striped shirts, it is the Marina after all, but the vibe was very un-pretentious.  It's not unlike Bar None, except that it's more low key with an older clientele and the un-Marina vibe won't get shattered when a person that embodies all of the Marina stereotypes walk in, because they won't come in. \n\nI can enjoy being here.

The bartenders are great, the jukebox is second to none, the pool table is fine and I can even play the old style game of PacMan.\n\nPeople are friendly.  You can bring food if you like.  \n\nThe Marina Lounge is a great neighborhood bar.", "author": "Allan B."}

I see a lot of bartenders here and that's always a fantastic sign, like seeing a chef constantly eating at another restaurant. Like the Page bar, they simply are what they are, which is an institution and the least pretentious place in the Marina by far. The bartenders are good ol' fashioned hard drinkin' bartenders like Sully (who loves his Fernet, so if you wanna get in good quick, buy him a shot), Gary and Ed who always have a pat on the back and will have a drink with you. I think the bald guys name is Dave, and he was cool too, but the one night I was here when he was, a really pretty girl was barbacking, which, was distracting and somewhat incongruous, but AOK. Great bar, so play some pool, play some Pac Man, shoot back some soldiers, and get drunk here as much as you can!!", "author": "Steve l."}

The bartenders are friendly and we usually play a game or two of pool and rock the jukebox.  Good relaxing crowd.", "author": "Robert D."}
