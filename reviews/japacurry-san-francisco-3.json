It's probably because they hardly ever come down to the peninsula anymore.  So now when I'm walking around downtown SF and spot that curry orange colored truck, I almost never hesitate to stop over for some curry.\n\nI'm basically writing this update because it's been a while since my last review, and it's about a couple of menu items that weren't on the menu back then.\n\nKaraage Curry w/ brown rice -- http://bit.ly/1T5wIdu\nI've had this many times since they added this to their menu.  They use huge pieces of Chicken Karaage and they still give a good amount of curry to pour on top.  I also like how they have the option to have brown rice as well.\n\nOkonomiyaki -- http://bit.ly/1T5wJy6\nI tried this at the Nihonmachi Festival one year and they did a good job with it.  The one they served me was loaded with seafood and veggies.  It was pretty much as good as any okonomiyaki should be.  I hope they add it to their regular menu someday.\n\nI've also tried their Curry Sandwich which was almost like a fried croquette filled with curry.  It was a good sized sandwich.  Very delicious and for about $5 it's quite a deal. \n\nI'm really glad to see that JapaCurry is still around and doing well.  Even though they still opened a brick and mortar at Izakaya Roku, I'm glad they decided to still keep their trucks operating.  I really hope they do come back to visit the peninsula.  Otherwise, it does make visiting them in the city a worthwhile visit and builds up anticipation for me for the next time I get to enjoy their curry.", "author": "Rodney H."}

Japa Curry Truck had plenty of Japanese options located right in the core of the city. I'm not sure how common Japanese food is in the city, but there was a pretty long lineup in front of Japa Curry Truck. It's not cheap compared to what we normally get in Toronto, especially considering that it is a food truck, but I decided it was worth a try.\n\nWe ordered the pork cutlet with vegetables and curry, which came to a total of $10. The curry and rice weren't especially warm. However, I DID really appreciate that they put the curry in a separate container out of the pork cutlet and rice so that the rice and cutlet would not be soggy when it was consumed. The pork cutlet was extremely crisp, though I didn't think it was particularly juicy. The rice was alright and the curry was average as well, I really appreciate it if it was a little hotter, though I understand that a truck can't produce so much heat. \n\nI think for the price I paid for the food, a cheaper price would be better to accommodate for the food.", "author": "Kristy N."}

Both the chicken and pork katsu are amazingly good drowned in the sweet and spicy curry over rice. They use a lot of onion in their curry, but it is all melted such that it blends in with the smoothness of the curry. All that's left of the onion is its sweetness in the sauce. The spicy curry is not too spicy so if you're debating whether to get mild or spicy, just go with the spicy as it's fairly mild. The katsu has a nice crisp to it and the meat is moist. On the side, you get some pickled vegetables in a tiny plastic cup. All this comes together for a wonderful curry experience.\n\nWith that said, if you want some pork belly instead of katsu, spend that extra dollar! The prices for this truck are very reasonable. The pork belly is so delicious. It's fatty and soft and everything nice you'd want from pork belly. Fill yo belly with that pork belly and you'll be belly belly happy.", "author": "Joshua M."}

But the chicken Katsu is overshadowed by the true champion of Japa Curry, the Chicken Karaage. The pieces of Karaage chicken are crispier, and juicier. When you pour the curry over it, angels sing from the heavens.\n\nFor $9, the prices are s bit high. The insane demand was bound to drive up the prices.

The quality of the chicken katsu is almost like no other place I've been to, it's simply incredible. Everywhere else it's either too dry or too juicy, and sometimes it feels like there is no meat when eating katsu in general. At JapaCurry it's always tender juicy and I feel like I'm actually eating chicken katsu done right. The chicken katsu is nice and thick and definitely makes me happy.\n\nNow the sauce ... the infamous sauce I think they have on most their dishes. You can order in different levels of spiciness, but I like to go spicy (but the extreme spice level). The sauce is just a perfect balance of savoury, sweet and spicy. They give you a good amount of sauce so every bite you can have it's amazing flavor in every bite. \n\nThe vegetables are boiled, and they're usually add some diversity to your meal with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots. Sometimes the vegetables aren't cooked all the way through so you get a bite of raw vegetables which is so bad because everything is really soft and melts in your mouth but when you hit this raw veggie it's such a turn off.\n\nThe line is probably a 10-20 minute wait depending what time you line up at. But it's definitely worth the wait, and you could even skip the wait if you go before noon. The service is excellent and once you do order it comes pretty fast.

Taking the opportunity to hit the streets (and mail a bill; yes, she mocked me for doing so), we were on the hunt for lunch eats when we happened upon the JapaCurry Truck right as it was opening. Being that neither one of us live in SF, our excitement for what the truck had to offer was briefly tempered by checking the Yelp reviews. The 4-star average let us give in to our food desires and we were customers 3 & 4. \n\nI haven't lived in a city with a robust Asian culinary scene in four years. Nashville is making strides but it's nowhere near the depth of what you can find on the west coast (duh). Not having had non-sushi Japanese food in far too long, I jumped at the chance to bring some Japanese curry into my life. After all, it's in the title. It has to be good, no? Yes. I knew curry was on the menu but wasn't sure about the protein until I saw the kara-age. Fried chicken is ALWAYS the right choice to the Kentucky native and Nashville local. For those who might not know, Japanese curry is not as flavor-forward (aggressive?) as Indian curry. In fact, to my tastes, it's a bit sweeter. So, expectations. My plate of chicken and rice was a lot bigger than I anticipated. Once I doused the ingredients with the curry, I dug in. Oh man. The fried chicken was meaty, flavorful on its own and sopped up the curry-stew like a sponge. In fact, it was so good at blending the flavors and mediums, I couldn't finish my lunch. Me. A charter member of the clean plate club. Leaving food on the table. I struggled to finish the last bites but my volcano goddess admonished me about my growing food baby belly and reminded me that I should only be eating a fistful of food at a time. Yeah, we don't eat together very often. Admitting defeat, I left the last forkfuls of rice and bites of chicken in the container and wondered where I could find a similar dish in the 615.

They put the curry on the side so it doesn't get the rice soggy, which is nice.  The Kurobuta Sausage with curry seems a little odd, but I just eat the sausage separately from the curry and rice.  The tonkatsu has a nice crunchy batter and it comes out freshly fried so it's tasty.  Portions are good so it's a definitely a fulfilling meal.\n\nThe Chicken Teriyaki was okay.

I have yet to find a solid Katsu Curry (I haven't tried Muracchi's yet) so when I heard about the arrival of the JapaCurry Truck last year, I was ecstatic.  After an excruciating five-month wait, I finally got to try JapaCurry's Katsu Curry when they were at Off The Grid - Civic Center on Friday, April 8, 2011.\n\nOTG - Civic Center starts at 11:30 AM, however, my collogues and I arrived 10 minutes prior to beat the lines. I stood in line at 11:25 AM (2 people in front of me) and as I waited for the JapaCurry Truck to \"Open, Open, Open\", I could smell the aroma of katsu frying permeating into the air. AHHHHHH... I ordered the Katsu Curry with Pork ($8) and within 2 minutes of ordering, it was ready. \n\nAfter a much-anticipated wait and hearing all the rave reviews, I think my high expectations of JapaCurry caused a slight disappointment. Or, it may be due to the fact that I previously devoured a mouth-watering Pork Belly Bun from Chairman Bao which curbed my appetite. \n\nA warm golden brown pork cutlet topped a heaping portion of sticky Japanese short grain rice with fukujinzuke pickles sprinkled on the side. The curry sauce was served in separate container so the pork katsu and rice wouldn't get soggy. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thAbNIGH1pWMi6uPw39e1w?select=rq56wbsQQu5CnB7tvPipnQ\n\nThe thick cut of pork katsu was coated with just the right amount of batter to produce that crunchy exterior while still being able to taste all the tender and juicy porkyness of the katsu. Once you slather the curry sauce on top of the katsu, it gets soggy quick so use the curry as a \"dipping\" sauce instead if you like your katsu to remain crisp. Although the curry sauce had the perfect consistency to coat the back of a spoon without dripping all over the place, I was expecting a bigger punch in flavor. I felt like it was missing the pungent and complex flavor of spices (i.e. coriander, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, and ginger). It was definitely missing heat though as the \"spicy\" was more like a black pepper taste to me. The fukujinzuke pickles added a touch of acidity to help balance the richness, although I wish there was an option to add more as teaspoon is just not enough for me. \n\nJapaCurry is definitely one of the better food trucks out there in terms of authenticity, quality and pricing for the amount of food given.

Only Muracci's brought back some of those memories with their most excellent food, but like a beloved neighbor that suddenly moves away from the fishing village in an Ozu film, I was feeling Muracci's was becoming more of a distant memory that has gained distance in the intervening months.\n\nThat was before JapaCurry came on the scene and in an orange truck no less. I only became aware of them when the controversy heated up in the blogosphere over its Second Street location from the protests raised by Alison Rowe of Harvest & Rowe, who complained loudly that JapaCurry would interfere with her bricks-and-mortar business. Interesting theory. She should perhaps explore the mediocrity of her food and the high prices of her own operation before throwing stones at passing food trucks.\n\nMuch to Ms. Rowe's chagrin, the publicity is obviously helping business at JapaCurry since I was barely able to get a meal scraped together by the time I arrived around 1:30PM at their Mission/New Montgomery location. I was told all I could score was sauce and rice for about $3. Hey, I'm Japanese. I'll take it. As it turned out, I was able to get some of the remaining Vegetable Curry (normally $7) and got extra sauce to go (see photo).\n\nI really liked the sauce. Spicy but not edgy.

I have seriously been missing out on Japanese Katsu Curry since I've moved to San Francisco.\n\nAs I've mentioned in my previous review, I always assumed that I didn't like curry.  The real problem I've been suffering from is that I've not had good curry...ever.  Queue JapaCurry where I finally made the step into having chicken katsu curry from JapaCurry's truck.  My impression: OUTSTANDING!  There are very few restaurants here in SF (including fancy pants ones) that can get me to overturn my conviction of a food I don't like into something I do like.  JapaCurry has earned all 5 stars in my mind.  I literally ate the entire thing, and didn't leave any rice spared in the box.  I didn't use all the curry sauce (is eating JUST curry sauce something one does if they enjoy it?  Seems like it needs to go with something), but I enjoyed every bite of my lunch.  I enjoyed it so much, I'm actually craving it on a regular basis now.\n\nCongratulations JapaCurry, you've converted a non-believer of curry into a craver of your food out of me!", "author": "Lisa I."}

So, we went, 'oh, are they trying something new?' Then, as we were in front of the truck contemplating if we should try it, a guy (the line organizer) came over and said, 'today, the wait is only 10 minutes. We had customers waited for 2 hours to get one and they said it's worth it.' Fell into the trap. We only wanted to get one to try it since we know Hawaiian L&L at financial district also has it. It wouldn't be $8 a burger there! But, my sister convinced me to get 2 because what if it's good. So, we ordered 2 ramen burgers with beef patty since we had wanted to try one for a long time (They ran out of the tofu patty one). Disappointing. The burger is small. No wonder people ordered 2 per person (dude, $16 for 2 burgers per person. Eating a gourmet burger at some other place is more worth it). The ramen and patty are bland. It is soy-glazed, but seriously, we couldn't taste the glaze until half-way. So, they were also selling custom sriracha for $5 a bottle, but they have some bottles laying around for people to try. If the sriracha had not been there, paying $8 for the burger would have been painful. So, since it's bland, we asked the guy if we could try it on the top of the burger. He said yeah go for it. Glad we did. We got a squirt of it and walked away. It's more tasteful. \nAnyway, we suspected the burger came from Hawaiian L&L because we saw some boxes labeled 'ramen burger.'

While Japacurry has been making the rounds near my work for about a year now, I usually prefer to get Muraccis over this due to the slightly larger portions and the awesome katsu they serve over there. However, Japacurry has added something to their menu that, while not served everyday, truly gives me a reason to come here. That item is their Chicken Kara-age Curry. For those unfamiliar with Chicken Kara-age, it's essentially the equivalent of some delicious chicken nuggets. Now top that off with the delicious curry sauce and you've got yourself a winner. \n\nWhile you can't go wrong with either Japacurry or Muraccis as both are delicious options, definitely give this place a shot if you haven't tried it before. And should you see the Kara-age special on the menu, order it without hesitation as it does sell out quite fast, a clear sign that something is probably quite delicious!", "author": "Gajan K."}

Do not plan on looking elegant while eating this, as you will need to bite pieces off with your teeth, because they don't supply plastic knives. The stringiness of the chicken doesn't help. Flavor was just fine, however.\n\nThe curry was just okay. I asked for spicy, and they basically just sprinkle more chile pepper powder on it. It wasn't bad, and it will definitely satisfy a curry craving, but it was really quite ordinary.\n\nOddly, they served a bed of shredded cabbage with the rice and karaage, which I thought was strange. Shredded cabbage is often served with tonkatsu, but never with katsu curry. I ordered karaage, which is even stranger with cabbage. Perhaps they're confused, or maybe just creative. Ha. I don't find the cabbage to be objectionable, but thought I'd mention this just cuz.\n\nNot sure if I'll be back. Much better options in the city. For $8, it was a decent deal, but that's pretty much what you'd pay in a real restaurant, so don't think you'll be saving money just because it's from a truck.", "author": "J K."}

No veggies when I know for a fact the Japanese put in at least carrots in their curry. What bothered me the most was that the curry wasn't even spicy at all! I had to eat it with kimchi borrowed from the kalbi taco truck parked a few feet away. The pork cutlet was dry and flavorless--not happy!! I also didn't like the fact that the pickled radish wasn't contained separately from the rice and curry. It got lost at the bottom of my rice and stained it with a hot pink, reddish hue. By the time I found it, I wasn't able to enjoy it with my curry because I had already gotten full.\n\nOkay, I get that being served from a truck doesn't allow for A+ presentation, and I do give JapaCurry 1 star for attracting me with their decked out cutesy truck and branding.

It's a bit more watery than I prefer, but at least they make up for it in flavor.]\n* PICKLES\n            - [4.5/5 - My biggest qualm is only that they give you so little of this! I always need extra pickles because each perfect bite must consist of some to balance out the curry.]\n* PORK KATSU\n            - [3.5/5 - I mean, it's fried & breaded pork cutlets. Not really something I'd ever look for or crave without the accompaniments.

I LOVE their Pumpkin croquette on its own, I think it's fantastic and would happily just order it alone.\n\nThe serving was kind of big for me, which is fine but basically it's steamed veggies with a pumpkin croquette and some slices of potato. The curry is separate which you can add in but there's something odd about just pouring curry over steamed veggies rather than having them in the curry in the first place. Maybe I'm just particularly picky since I tend to eat at another Japanese curry joint almost every week and I'm used to the veggies being in the curry.

I've had both the chicken katsu and the pork katsu curry dishes.  The curry was good and similar to the level of Muracci's.  But I'd say Muracci's wins in a close race.  Order the spicy curry.  Keep in mind, 'spicy' in Japanese food is like the level of heat in a taco bell sauce packet - i.e. not at all spicy.  \n\nThe meals are $8 and therefore \"cheaper\" than Muracci's.  But at Muracci's, the katsu is bigger/thicker, you can get brown rice for free (JapaCurry charges $0.50), and they give more rice.  So JapaCurry is giving the same value per $ as Muracci's.  Basically, you'll pay almost $2 more, but get 25% more food at Muracci's.  The plus here is that it's much quicker.  \n\nDon't forget to Badgein with your Clipper card for savings.\n\nPro tip:  Rather than ordering the Kurobata sausage curry and complaining about the size, order a Katsu curry and pay an extra $0.75 per sausage.  It's a 10x better deal.", "author": "Jon K."}

Lots of ways to build your order a la carte.\n\nThe Bad: Pricey if you want a full meal since a la carte items will take you over $10. Base dish doesn't have much to it, just meat and tons of rice, plus a REALLY SMALL side of red pickle (extra is less than $1, but these add up). \n\nI've eaten a lot of Japanese food and a lot of curry, but this was my first time eating Japanese curry. I'm definitely down for more! This is an excellent to-go option as the curry sauce (which you can order spicy) comes in a separate container and doesn't get your meat & rice all soggy.\n\nThe pork katsu was pretty much spot on and dipping it in the tub of curry sauce just took it over the top. I will definitely try this truck again, if I'm not looking for a cheap lunch, but it will be hard not to go back to the pork katsu.\n\nI like lots of rice, so I didn't have problem with the large quantity of white rice. They gave me extra curry sauce (I suspect because I ordered the croquette too) which I just dumped all over the rice after I was done with the other items. The red pickle made a good condiment for the rice, in spite of how little was provided.\n\nThe pumpkin croquette was very good, but as it is also offered as the veggie meal option, I'm not sure that one or two of those would really make a good meal for someone wanting to skip the meat (as I sometimes do).  There are vegetable and cheese options as sides, which I did not try, so this is definitely not the final word on whether a fully vegetarian meal could be achieved here.\n\nAll in all, my first visit to JapaCurry was positive.

I went here with a co-worker for lunch since it was close by, oh and it was pay day and.. it was on our list of places to try. Yes, we have a list. We both ordered the Teriyaki chicken bento box. It already came pre made, but it was still warm. Even though, it still looked really good and it tasted good too. I think the chicken was a little bit on the dry side, but still edible. I think if you order something other than the bento box then it's cooked to order. This place is cash only so make sure you go to the ATM first. The workers are nice. I most likely will try it again and order something other than the bento box, I think I was just playing it on the safe side.", "author": "Jeanie Ann D."}

They even have the signature \"Herro! Can I take you order?\" accent down perfect. \n\nI went down to their Sansome and Pine location (right in the middle of all the FiDi hubbub!) and was surprised to see not that many people waiting for their food. Then again, I went after 1pm. Luckily for me, lack of line meant that I just had to wait for pretty much two minutes to order and receive.\n\nNow, for the actual food, I walked fifteen minutes to go back home with this baby. I would anticipate my food tasting a little soggier than most would like, but JapaCurry's pork katsu somehow retained a state of succulent crisp. Mm baby. It brought me back to my trip to Japan. It tasted exactly like the food vendors there, too - serving a yummy snack-or-meal curry dish along the way. Here, you get a medium rectangle box with the katsu and a plastic container with the curry on the side, which is really considerate of them! I normally like my katsu breaded to be really unhealthily fried and crunchy, but JapaCurry's light crisp satisfied me perfectly. The pork was amazing - though a little too cooked and chewy for my medium rare tastes, but some fat still clung to the pork which made it taste fantastic without the curry, too. The curry amount in the container was PERFECT, which is actually EXTRAORDINARY because people usually don't give you enough curry to even finish half your meal. Perhaps there was even too much curry in the container, which means you can save extra to take home and dab on your other food or leftovers! And the pickled vegetable is really nice, too - quite mild with a soft crunch, which is lovely - usually it's too intrusive.\n\nMy only complaint would be that the spicy curry isn't spicy enough, but I also have a flame resistant tongue, so.", "author": "Amy Y."}

These were REALLY yummy.  They were fried just right, had a crunchy outside and soft inside.  Although they give you tonkatsu sauce for it, I recommend dipping it in the curry.  Actually, it would be an improvement on an already very yummy item if they added curry powder to the potatoes...*drool*\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed everything I had from JapaCurry and would get more in a heartbeat.

I was surprised to see how much you actually get. I ordered the Tonkatsu curry over rice . \n\nThe sauce had a hint of spice but not over powering, the tonkatsu was breaded and fried to the crisp and golden brown. It was the perfect combo with a little bit of rice, curry sauce and pork all in one bite. They give you a lot of rice which is good because there was so much sauce left over after eating the tonkatsu. I could eat the sauce itself with the rice.\n\nIt's fast and easy on the go kind of food. Good for a quick lunch or a snack. $6 well spent, go try it now!", "author": "Elsa Y."}

I had the chicken katsu curry for $7. For $7 it is a very reasonable curry. As I ordered, the guy said they have regular and spicy curry, so I ordered the spicy.\n\nThe order comes in 3 containers. A square one that has the rice and Chicken Katsu. A separate small round plastic container inside the square one with fukujinzuke (the pickled vegetable), and clear plastic round 1 pint container with the curry. This was very good that they did not pour the curry over the rice, as I had a 10 minute drive back to the office. Also makes it easy to heat up the curry in the microwave if needed. Also, they must have read the review here of the woman who complained about her pickled veggies being buried underneath her rice.\n\nSo now the taste... the chicken cutlet was decent. Not dry, and tender. But, you could tell that it was pre-fried in the morning and has been sitting for a while. Not freshly fried on the truck. The katsu at Muracchi in Los Altos is still the best in my book. \n\nThe curry, upon first bite did not seem so spicy, though I had asked for the spicy one. As mentioned by others, it seems like they cook this curry over a long time as you could tell the vegetables are almost in puree form and the vegetable flavor has been infused in the curry well. I love this style of curry. The thickness, I would put ad mid way between loose and thick.\n\nAs I made my way through my meal, the hotness started to kick in... Wow... the hotness is the type that you don't first notice, but as time goes on, it gradually comes on strong. By the end of my lunch, I had to go get a glass of water as the hotness was getting... well... pretty hot..\n\nFor a quick decent lunch at a good price, the Japacurry truck is definitely cool.", "author": "Takeshi S."}

While I thought the curry was pretty good overall, I feel like this one's mostly hype. The portions are fine, but I wish there was more meat. I got the pork katsu. I guess the last time I went out to get pork katsu was when I went to Muraccis. Thus, my heart sank when I opened the box and made that immediate comparison. Nevertheless, the meat was actually pretty good. The curry itself wasn't as impressive.

I was here for the Tofu Fest in Japantown SF when this truck caught my eye. My friends and I marveled at the cutesy design of the truck -- I wish all cars could be this adorably designed! The selection seemed pretty limited from only katsu curry to tofu or croquette curry. After munching on only tofu the whole morning, my carnivorous appetite went for the tonkatsu. For $7 the portion seemed on the slightly small side, but maybe I'm just a glutton. The meal was satisfying although not memorable. It didn't help that the pork katsu was pretty dry.

I had the kurobuta sausage curry and it was the perfect size for me and the spiciness was just right. Especially on the slightly grey chilly day in SF today, it was the ideal comfort food. I'll have to try the other varieties soon, I'm glad there's a food truck near work... I was getting tired of the same few places.", "author": "Amy C."}

I have tried most of their curry dishes as well as the nori bento box - All are very delicious!  Their curry has depth of flavor, their rice is made to perfection, and their chicken katsu tender and not greasy.  I try and go every Thursday to Mission and Montgomery.  I love that the lunch staff are Japanese expatriates.", "author": "Dana G."}

And was it ever worth the 10 minute wait!  Chicken Katsu is seriously amazing.  The care he puts into the food AND the curry on the side...PERFECT touch.  I even brought home the pork katsu for dinner for the hubby, and believe it or not, it traveled well.  Hubby gave it a \"4 star\" review as well, so is that 8 stars?  Run; do not walk!  Try it...you will NOT be disappointed!", "author": "Sonia C."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-01-06", "description": "Very, very good. I've had the chicken katsu and pork katsu. Both were well prepared, tender, and flavorful. But the curry... ohhh, the curry is fabulous. I can taste it now. It's MUCH better than the boxed curries you get at Japanese grocery stores, even after kicking it up with jalapenos and additional spices. They offer regular and spicy; the spicy is noticeably spicy, but not mouth-burningly hot. Regular is probably bland by comparison. The only drawback is that this is a truck, so there's nowhere to eat. You have to carry it elsewhere, or sit on the sidewalk.", "author": "Stuart M."}

It only came with three pieces of grilled vegetable: one slice of eggplant, one thin slice of green pepper, and one asparagus, and some curry sauce and rice.   But they charged $7 for it.  They should give a little more vegetables.  \n\nThe curry was not that amazing.  It tastes like the curry blocks you can buy from any Asian superstore.  They just added some onions.  \n\nFor $7 lunch, I am very disappointed.  I could spent this amount in any restaurants nearby and get way better quality food.", "author": "Jessica L."}

I thought I had the best japanese curry there was, eating at Muracci's, but boy was I wrong.  It happened like it usually happens, I hear about this new place on New Montgomery called Sushiritto (which by the way I will be reviewing on soon) and go there to see what the hype is about because hey, let's face it food makes me happy.  Anywho, I go and the line is not just out the door, it's out the door, around the corner and down that block.  Some people had sleeping bags!  One guy tried to cut in line and the old lady behind him hip tossed him to the curb.  Ok, I made up the sleeping bag part.  Well, I wasn't ready to wait a couple of days for a sushi burrito yet, so we leave and there it was, around the corner.  The line was long but compared to the other place, it seemed like a firecracker fuse compared to a bungie cord (on a very high bridge, that stretches and, well you get the point).  We all tried the katsu curry, and oh boy was it katsu-licious.  Sorry I'll stop.  Bottom line, best japanese curry yet!  Follow it, and if it's in your neighborhood, RUN TOWARDS IT.", "author": "Tony N."}

It's all about the food and the experience of finding a good spot to eat your food. Since I love Japanese curry, I had to try this one. Arrived just before the noon lunch rush at the howard location, and glad I did. Barely stood in line, and found a great shaded stump to sit and eat. A friend and I had a great time eating, talking, and enjoying the beautiful weather while eating our pork katsu curry (both ordered to be spicy!). I'm definitely trying this again. First, to try the other items on the menu (there are about 7-8 different options), and then have the pork katsu curry again. The pork was moist, and perfectly crisp.", "author": "Sooji H."}
