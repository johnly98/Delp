We walked in, and sat down right away but was greated by our server after a good 10mins. Keep in mind there were only 7 tables at that moment. \n\nAfter the server appeared we ordered. We asked for a soup and two entrees and two glasses of water. We waited close to 10 and then had to ask the waitress twice for the water. Which she then brought to us in plastic cups, as she said they ran out of glasses. That was confusing as there were literally 7 tables seated in the whole place?!? \n\n We started with The soup, Tom Yum Gai, good tasting and the right amount of mushrooms and onions.  And then We ordered the Pad Prik King which is one of our favorites. It was good, flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. Our second dish, the Pad See Ewi was soooo bland. Lacked flavor and appeal. \n\nNeedless to say we won't be returning back. We were not impressed with the dishes or the plastic cups.", "author": "Bill F."}

When I've ordered the combination lunch, I've gotten the fried egg rolls, fried tofu, chicken satay, barbecued chicken, chicken krapaw, curry chicken, all delicious, never disappointed.\n* Today I was served water, which I drank from, in a filthy glass.

Starved and craving Thai, it just so happened The Old Siam Thai Restaurant was conveniently across the street. Actually most of the diners who could't get into KK, went to Old Siam too. The restaurant was busy during our visit and was constant. Not a huge place, but comfortable for small to large parties. \n\nWe sat a 2 seater that faces the street - great for people watching. We ordered Tom Kha ($9) for an appetizer soup. Enough to serve 4 people in small bowls and we had 2 bowls each. We ordered the soup with chicken and there were a lot of chicken pieces in it. I really enjoyed the soup and the flavor. Needed more chili flakes, however. The extra spices were on the table to easy to add.\n\nFor my entree I ordered the Pad See Ew ($10) with Pork and my friend ordered the Pork Belly Chef Speciality with a side of white rice.\n\nMy noodles lacked oyster sauce and was bland unfortunately. I hadn't had Thai in a while and I was really looking forward to some delicious Pad See Ew. I was disappointed. The Pork Belly was way too salty for my taste and they were big chunks of what I thought looked liked bacon.  There were a lot of veggies and my friend really thought the pork belly would be on top and not mixed in. It would have been better to just placed the pork belly separate and on its own and customers can mix it themselves.\n\nService was good and our waters were refilled constantly. It was a quick meal, and glad we had no wait. We probably spent half the price then what we would have spent across the street. The location is borderline sketchy / tenderloin, so I recommend not sticking around too late in the area.", "author": "Maria C."}

We enjoyed the time so it wasn't bad. However, when we get our check, 18% of the tip was included. Also, they add tax after they include tip. So it was like they charged us 20% of the tip. We were just 3 people and I can not understand why they charged the tip. We asked to off the tip but they said it was added automatically. But it seems not. I saw other customer's review here. I doubted to go to the restaurant and I was right. IT WAS AWFUL DECISION. This restaurant should stop charging tips if they really want to get some tips.

However, when the price is taken into account it's definitely worth at least trying. Most of the dishes are 10 dollars or less, making this a budget restaurant that actually delivers pretty good food! The interior and service are nothing special, but are certainly passable. The menu is also extensive, with many different options available alongside different preparations of the same dish. We ordered the eggplant and salmon dish (with rice on the plate as well) and it was really delicious. If I had to be picky, the salmon might have been better seasoned. We also ordered a chicken and bamboo bird's nest, which was relatively hard to eat but also quite good. I think it just made me realize I don't have a huge love for bird's nest noodles. Finally, we ordered drinks; a Thai iced tea which was spot on, and then a strange mix of flavor syrup, Sprite, and mango slices.

This place was the only one open at the time and we quickly got inside to order. The food was good, and the prices were no surprise being SF. It was night time so there were not that many guests and the waitresses were attentive to us. The only thing that made me rate this place a 2 star is because of the way they acted at the end. I know it's rather unusual these days to tip in cash, but we did. We left them tips on the table and one of the waitresses didn't wait for us to leave the table when she took the tip and began counting it. She returns and now two of them are telling us that on the receipt it was a 15% gratuity. First, GRATUITY is what we, as the customers, wish to pay them extra for their services. Second, if they wanted us to forcibly pay additionally 15$ more they should've included the tip in the bill. And third, the audacity to DEMAND we give them more was ridiculous. They ruined our night simply by being like this. I understand if they were tired and wanted to close the place but to take it out on the customers is no way to bring us back. Definitely not returning to this place. \n\n\nAnoche estuvimos paseando alrededor de las diez de la noche a buscar algo qu\u00e9 comer. Este restaurante fue el \u00fanico que estaba abierto a estas horas y mi familia y yo nos metimos a comer. La comida fue exquisita aunque siendo San Francisco el precio fue predecible. Las meseras fueron muy atentas. La \u00fanica cosa que fue lo que caus\u00f3 que les diera dos estrellas es que al pagar nosotros decidimos dejar la propina en la mesa en lugar de escribirlo en el recibo como es usual. No s\u00f3lo la mesera nos arrrebat\u00f3 el dinero de la mesa cuando a\u00fan segu\u00edamos ah\u00ed (claro se notaba su prisa porque ya quer\u00edan cerrar el restaurante). Pero luego regresaron el dinero y nos dijeron que la propina ten\u00eda que ser el 15%, o sea 15$ de 'gratuidad'. Para empezar, la palabra dice 'gratuidad' no significa que sea necesario. Segundo, si quer\u00edan que a fuerzas les pag\u00e1ramos ese 15%, lo deber\u00edan haber puesto en el cheque, y no como propina. No fueron para nada profesional, s\u00e9 que quiz\u00e1s estaban cansadas y que quer\u00edan cerrar,  pero la manera que actuaron no nos gust\u00f3 para nada.

We don't even feel like gave 10% tips for this kind of customer service but waitress even refused to change the amount of the tips because it was in the computer system.  Anyway, the food tasted alright but with this kind of customer service I am  sure no one would go back again.", "author": "Max M."}

I swore to myself, SWORE, that I was going to hit this spot at least one time during my week in San Francisco. \n\nSWORE. \n\nThe Monday came and went. \n\nTuesday was a super-late night out that came and went. \n\nI got a free dinner (thanks Gatorade) on Wednesday night. \n\nThursday night was at the Madden Bowl. Came and went. \n\nI really started to wonder if you week-long dream was going to come to an end. \n\nIt did not. \n\nI took the fam on Friday night. And it was amazing. \n\nWe went early, which was perfect. I know a lot of people claim that their child is cute. A lot of times, they are right. But a lot of times it's overstated. And I feel like one of the few people in the world who is honest and will call out a baby for not being cute. I have Facebook. I see a lot of not-great-looking kids. Not that they are bad, mind you. Just not as cute as advertised. \n\nSo believe me when I tell you that my child is cute. Maybe the cutest in the world (we'll take on all challengers). But this staff could not be more adoring to my child. Seriously. We are still a little apprehensive when we take our child out in public. Especially in a new city. But the staff here put us completely at ease. So, so friendly. \n\nAnd this is before we even ordered the food. \n\nThe vegetable egg rolls were very good. Not the best I've ever had, but very good. \n\nThe scallion patty, though, was the best ever. Holy heck, this was amazing. Make sure you order this. Well, if you like onions. Don't do it if you don't. I hope that goes without saying, but a lot of you Yelpers don't give me a lot of faith. I don't mean that in a bad way, but some of you wary me. \n\nI'm going to try to remember the entrees we had. There were three. Thai Sukiyaki was absolutely great. Pad noodles. We also did beef with broc and the cashew chicken. I know, not really adventurous; but it's important to have some sort of base dish to judge it against. \n\nSeriously. I will always order a beef taco/enchilada combo the first time I ever visit a Mexican place. It will help me have something to compare to other places. \n\nLikewise, I tend to order the same Thai dishes at my first visit. So there you go. I don't know why I feel the need to justify my food order to you, but there you go. \n\nSo we got this grip of food, a couple of beers and apps for less than $70. In San Francisco, which seems impossible. But it was just a great value, great food and wonderful service. \n\nMy regret is that I wasn't able to eat here more. If I'm ever stuck in the FiDi again (I hope not, because I really didn't care too much for the Hilton), I will eat here repeatedly. REPEATEDLY. \n\nSo I beseech you to give this place a spot.

I am giving this place a 4star because I did not enjoy the tight close tables and very warm in back of restaurant.", "author": "Brooke N."}

You don't have to have the tofu and shrimp in the dish. \n\nI also ordered a Thai Iced Tea, I only wish they had coconut milk or other kinds of milk to substitute the evaporated milk.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2013-05-14", "description": "+ Karee Gai: Chicken cooked in mild yellow curry with potato and onions - can be selected as a rice plate ($8.95) or a la carte ($9.95). Selected the rice option simply because curry includes so much sauce, how else will you eat it - by licking it all up?? Anyway, this yellow curry is fantastic. The chicken is boneless, juicy and tender, the potatoes are perfectly cooked (not too crunchy yet not too soggy), and the curry is absolutely creamy and mild (as advertised, surprisingly).\n\n+ Special Rice Noodle: Flat rice noodle topped with ground chicken, shrimp, squid, tofu, mushroom, and house special sauce, $8.95. So much involved in this dish, talk about party in the mouth! Lots of flavor, lots of texture, lots of goodness. I don't care much for the tofu, but everything else tastes wonderful. I especially love that there is plenty of meat/seafood, so you don't have to hunt around, unsure if you've received all you've asked for, unlike certain other restaurants that are skimpy on such ingredients. Plenty to share, just a matter of whether or not you're willing to share!\n\nThis place is narrow, a bit cramped, with a waitlist. It doesn't quite give the best first impression when you enter, particularly if you wind up running into the pole structure that holds the building up while entering through the front door - it's a bit of an odd design. The column is literally right in the middle at the front entrance. Only one bathroom. There's a wide-screen TV that displays a slideshow of a bunch of the menu items, which is helpful, unless you're in a hurry to order and fail to notice the screen until after you've made your tough decisions, speaking from experience...The place is dimly lit, to the point where my photos were not ideal, with or without flash.

We ordered green curry with chicken, yellow curry with chicken, and a pad thai. Our curry dishes were specials that included fried rice and pad thai. The pad thai was flavorless; like another reviewer here, we left most of it on the plate. The fried rice lacked the edge or the heartiness of a good fried rice, and the curries could have come out of a can. Servers don't bother to put the drinks with the person who ordered them; they just put them down at one end of the table. And the only way they returned to fill water glasses was if you flagged them down. One of our group said the food reminded him of old cafeteria food. There are many better options for Thai, even in overpriced Union Square (this place at least was relatively cheap), so I don't see any reason to make a second visit here.", "author": "Gary M."}

The waitresses don't visit ur table unless called for, or you playing the waiting game.. 15mins, 20 mins...\n\nWe ordered the fried banana with mango ice cream, and she returns what seems like an eternity with just the ice cream. We ask about the fried banana and she gives a blank stare and says 'oh do u still want it?'. She goes to place the order for the fired banana, leaving the ice cream behind which is melting away in this heat. We ask her to take the ice cream. After 15 more mins, she returns with the fried banana and the same melted ice cream!! Seriously.

I would give it 1 star but some of the food was really good so I decided to give it 2 stars. Some of the food was really good and some of it was really bad. The service was pretty awful on the day that I went with a friend. It seemed like all of the workers were trying to do every job instead of just focusing on certain jobs. We had no idea who our actual server was the whole time because we were helped by several different people. In order to get anything we had to flag down a server as they walked by and I noticed that the tables around us were having to do the same thing.\n\nIt started off that they only brought us 1 water when we asked for 2. Not a big deal. Next, we had to wait at least 15 minutes before someone came over and asked if we were ready to order. After we ordered it took a really long time for us to get our food. A large group had come in after we ordered and the group had ordered and received their food before our first dish came so we were pretty annoyed by that. They also brought my friend's entree out first and didn't bring mine at all. He was almost finished with his food when he decided to remind one of the servers that we were still waiting for my dish. He had to ask a second server for my dish again before it was brought out to the table.\n\nWe ordered the Pan Fried Chive Cake as an appetizer. Don't get it. It was nice and crispy on the outside but it was mushy, chalky and doughy on the inside. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like that or if it just wasn't cooked all the way.\n\nI think the service would be better if they would start assigning a host role, and have the servers assigned to and focus on their own tables instead of all servers helping all tables.", "author": "Lane G."}

It was an uncomfortable and somewhat unsafe walk through the Tenderloin to get there.  Thankfully it was an uneventful walk, but I never would have done it after dark nor would I recommend it.\n\nMy cousin and I were seated quickly, and our server was quite patient as I tried to look up my previous Yelp review.  We didn't want to order the same dishes twice.\n\nSo this time we started with prawns in a lumpia wrap, I forgot what they were called in the menu.  Then we had the spicy seafood and then Lamb Massaman Curry.  We both had eyes on the curry dish, as we had passed it by on our first visit.\n\nThe appetizer was really good, it was kind of like a prawn lumpia.  The spicy seafood was as advertised.  There was a wide variety of seafood in the bowl: fish, squid, shrimp, scallops too I think.  It was right at my tolerance of spiciness.  Any spicier and I would not have liked it, because I like to taste my food while I'm eating it.\n\nBut the highlight of the meal was the Lamb Massaman Curry.  The lamb was neatly sliced into little cubes.  Each one was cooked perfectly and extremely tender.  It was outstanding!  We cleaned the dish of any remaining sauce with the naan once we had eaten all the lamb.\n\nMy only complaint was that the portions of rice were extremely small.  We eat rice like Asian people, not like tourists.  The bowl of rice we received with our entrees was barely enough for one of us.", "author": "The Bottomless Pi T."}

A bit small but it was pretty empty during lunch hour on a Saturday so we had no trouble finding seats. I ordered a Thai iced coffee which took forever to get to me. My bf got his Thai tea within a minute though, so I assumed it takes awhile to make Thai coffee. By the time my entree came my drink came shortly after. The workers at first were on their phones giggling over something, thus it took awhile for us to get our orders in. I was a bit cranky and hungry, so it was tiring to get their attention. They were nice however as soon as they picked up on our body language. \n\nThe lunch specials here are worth it! I forgot the pricing, about $10 for a plate of 2 half entrees (you choose from a set list), rice, soup, and appetizer. Pretty decent deal. My bf ordered that and got vegetarian pad thai, chicken, tofu, and tom yum soup. He was surprised at how tasty the vegetarian pad thai turned out and was pleased with his meal (he's a meat eater). The soup was pretty good, I ended up eating all of it. I ordered the pad kee mao with chicken spicy. It resulted in a mild and oily noodles mixed with ground chicken. I prefer regular chicken more so than ground, but the dish overall wasn't that bad. Tasty sauce and I added the vinegar hot peppers from the condiments tray to add some spice to it. I think I enjoyed the tom yum more than my noodles. Towards the bottom of my plate of pad kee mao resided a pool of oil. Not very pleasing, they could at least put lettuce underneath the noodles to hide/absorb the oil.\n\nOverall, a decent Thai restaurant.

I really wanted to still give this place a 3, but thinking about our overall experience, I just can't. If I'm with friends and they're really set on going here, I might politely follow along. But don't count on seeing me here by my own accord.\n\n= Amount for price: 4 =\nThis is too much food for ten bucks. Four of us each got the dinner special for $9.95. You choose an appetizer + entree, and fried rice & pad thai are included as part of the deal. All four items come on a single plate. I wouldn't exactly say that any of us were big eaters, which I think you'd have to be (or almost be) to finish the food.\n\n= Food: 2 2/3 =\nI ordered the chive cake appetizer for our table on a hunch it might be a Thai interpretation of pajeon (Korean green onion pancake). Turns out it kind of was. Instead of being a pancake, it came as four patty cakes. Biting through the crisp exterior revealed a moist, gel-like cave populated by coarsely cut chives (as opposed to the smaller bits in commonplace pajeon). Before I'd said anything, my three Korean friends compared it to pajeon too.\n\nAside from the default fried rice and pad thai, our combo plates included shrimp rolls, fried tofu, BBQ pork, fried chicken cutlets (think katsu), tofu pra ram, and red curry (described by our waitress as the spiciest kind). Everyone said the food was passable, with one lasting exception. One of my friends who hadn't gotten the curry tasted it; \"shampoo\" was his chosen word to describe the flavor.\n\nRepulsed yet intrigued, I had to try some too. While there definitely was a curry presence, I could see what he was talking about. Though still less than pleasant, it wasn't as jacknasty as I was expecting. Among shampoos, I'd group it in with Nexxus or Aussie rather than Nizoral or T/Gel. Even so, shampoo is for your hair, not your mouth. To top things off, it wasn't even spicy shampoo like we'd been warned / promised - the heat level was definitely trumped up. You're reading this from a spice weakling to boot. Oh, and the person whose dish it was? He endured teasing from the other two through the remainder of the meal.\n\nA final bit regarding my friend's analogy: the guy's an ESL student. You know his textbook contains eloquence absent from everyday American speech. So I think it says something that, of all his chapters of vocabulary and clunky translations from the electronic dictionary, he coined \"shampoo\" as the descriptor for this curry. He doesn't eat shampoo. We asked.\n\n= Service: 2 1/2 =\nAfter ordering, it was something like 15 minutes before we got our appetizer. Another 10 to 15 minutes elapsed before we had our main plates. It was a Thursday early evening with the place about half full and only two or three tables placing orders.\n\nI'm sure not all the waitresses are like the main one we had. Ours was curt to the point of often walking away before we were done answering or making requests. I don't think it was a language thing; even people who aren't adroit in English can still listen or at least be present as you're speaking. I didn't get the impression that she was mean-spirited, just too abbreviated.\n\nCase in point: in our last verbal interaction with her, I instinctively used two hands to separately point at my noodles and rice as I asked to get a box for my rice and... and that's as far as I got before the plate was out of my hands and heading to the register counter. I watched from my seat, unsure what she'd do with her incomplete instructions. She got a box and scraped the pad thai into it. Okay, that's good. She next picked up the plate and scraped the fried rice into a waste basin. So much for having leftovers later. But I'm not trippin'.\n\nOf the other waitresses, I kept thinking I'd seen two of them working at other restaurants.", "author": "Dan B."}

With my most recent experience, I'd say the mall versions BEAT THEM hands down! \n\nLearning from my lesson the first time around, I kept my order simple.  I ordered a 'Fresh roll' and requested it be made vegetarian.  On a previous occasion, the waitress was fluent and really competent.  She made certain I knew the difference between an egg roll and spring roll'; \"Fresh Roll\".  I did and thanked her for being so clear and taking extra initiatives to make certain.  I got what I ordered without flaw.  On that note, I returned the following week to order the same.\n\nThis time, I was greeted by an illiterate waitress that couldn't tell the different between their wine menu and general menu.  Had to reiterate, 'Give me the menu.'  Then, I ordered THE SAME ITEM, plus a 'Veggie (egg) Roll'.  I specifically said \"Make them both vegetarian.\"  \"Huh?\"  Was her frequent response; repetition of my orders and anything out of my mouth was necessary.  \n\nIf someone can BARELY SPEAK no less UNDERSTAND ENGLISH, SEND THEIR BUTT TO WORK IN THE BACK, NOT UPFRONT WITH CUSTOMERS!!! ITS A SAFE ASSUMPTION THAT A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CUSTOMERS ARE GOING TO BE/SPEAK THAI WHEN DINING IN A THAI RESTAURANT!!!\n\nHaving faith that things went well last week, I paid and walked out.  Midway through the Fresh Rolls, I saw pieces of shrimp tucked away.  HOLY CRAP!!!  I rushed back with the receipt and demanded to see the Manager.  Manger had the audacity to accuse me of NOT specifying I wanted vegetarian. HOW MUCH MORE CLEARER DO I HAVE TO BE WHEN I SAY \"MAKE THEM BOTH VEGETARIAN\"??!!??!!  I then put her on the spot and informed her I ordered the same last week without issue.  \"Oh, ok.  I'm so sorry. Do you want us to make another one or do you want your money back?\"  Poison me again?!?!?!?! Over a simple order that you can do right one week but not the other?!?!?!?!?!  I can get the same thing without error at the Metreon!!!!!!!!  \"Give me my money back!!!!!!!!!\"\n\nWHAT IS IT WITH THESE DAMN PEASANTS?!?!?! There's nothing wrong with being a mom-and-pop operation or being locally-based/run.  I've eaten at many places that are just the same.  The difference between the good and the horrible ones is when someone screws up, they acknowledge it, apologize, and offer to rectify the problem without cost to the customer.  These PRICKS, LIKE MANY DIVEY RESTAURANTS OWNED/OPERATED BY PEOPLE WHO WOULD BE BETTER OFF AS JANITORS, OPTED TOWARD DENYING WRONG-DOING OR BLAMING THE CUSTOMER UNTIL THEY GET CAUGHT RED HANDED!\n\nUpon a 3rd look at my receipt, I noticed they spelled 'vegetarian' as \"vegearian\".

It was the diviest of Thai eateries when they squeezed people in a small hovel next door, but the owner smartly expanded into the corner bar and made this the main dining room. The hovel became the kitchen as it should be. The net result is pretty nice considering it presents the gateway to the Tenderloin.\n\nPrices went up, too, but not unreasonably so. Presentation also got better, but the food remains the same...good, solid Thai dishes...nothing extraordinary but extremely well put-together. Certainly a lot better than a tourist trap like Bangkok Noodles on Powell, and I happen to prefer this place over any number of King of Thai Noodles around town.\n\nI had my usual - the Roast Duck Rice Plate - which they charge a fair price of $8.25. It tastes like a real quacker sacrificed himself for my palate. Jamie W. went for the $7.25 Pad Prik Sod with what looked like chow fun noodles. Tasty stuff.

At 10:30 we were told we had to immediately order because the kitchen was closing.  They close at 11:00.  At 10:40 they were refusing seating and taking to go orders only.  They were more concerned about leaving at 11pm that they were about the service.  So much more concerned two different appetizer plates on two occasions were taken from in front of me.  Both times I had food in my mouth I was not able to say anything.  I noticed the waitress would immediately go to the table and look at the tip amount and say thank you or nothing at all.  This immediately flagged me they were more concerned about the tip than the service so I left them a 91 cent tip.  We had not even left the place and they immediately grabbed the check looking at the tip.  They then proceeded to talk crap about us in their native tongue.  I could tell by the look of displeasure on her face.  The same look she would have seen had she looked at my face when she ripped our food from the table right in front of us.  But since she did not notice, it gave me great pleasure to notice her look of displeasure when she saw the tip.  They say Karma is a B----!  Well I am her brother!  Touche!  Now we are even!", "author": "K J."}

From what I remember, there are probably around 10 tables.  Also, the staff is friendly and the service is fast. We had a couple questions about the dishes, and our waitress answered them with ease. In addition, our food arrived quickly! Food that arrives fast when you're starving is always a plus.\n\nWe all ordered our own dishes. My friends ordered Pad Kee Mao, Spicy Pan-Fried Noodle, and Curry. I ordered Thai Pad Se-ew, which is basically stir-fried flat rice noodle with Chinese broccoli, egg, black soy sauce, and beef. The dish was flavorful, and the portion size was good. I'm usually not a fan of Chinese broccoli, but in this dish, the Chinese broccoli didn't even taste like Chinese broccoli. I don't know what they did, but I'm a fan! In addition, there was a good amount of meat in the dish too!\n\nOverall, a good experience.

We were handed the regular menu plus a two sided \"specials\" menu. One of the sides of the \"specials\" menu had a great selection (pad thai, panaang curry among them) of a mix of items for about 12 bucks! By the time they came to get my group's order, it was 7:20 and they wouldn't let us order from that menu because it's only served until 7!! In my defense, we should have been able to order from that menu, especially because they gave us that menu (so what that the \"specials\" menu had a second side we could order from...it wasn't any good). One of my friend, like me, really wanted to order from that menu while the rest of our group wanted us to just give in (who does that...I'm ready to put up a fight any day, well ok not a real fight but I don't like to give up without trying).\n\nSo fine, I settled for just some Panaang curry with chicken and it was delicious!

I got the regular Pad Thai with chicken and it was scrumptious. I scarfed it down basically in an instant, which is saying something because the serving was pretty generous, and all for decent prices. Of course, I was staying at the Hilton Union Square right next door where eggs delivered to the room cost $28. Anything could be considered cheap compared to that.\n\nThe Pad Thai was not as spicy as what one would get in Thailand, but that is easily fixed by ladling on any of the three spicy toppings the Old Siam has in glasses on the table. I was pretty ecstatic to see they served Chang and Leo beers, both of which I loved while over in Thailand. While I'm on the topic, if ever you get the chance to get your hands on a Beer Lao, don't hesitate! One of my favorite beers while over in Thailand and one that will definitely bring out your inner Communist! But I digress...\n\nI also ordered the banana roti and it was very well done. It could have been the exact same as one ordered at a street cart in Bangkok. Our server was friendly and helpful and even spoke some Thai, which is a welcome sight to someone accustomed to non-Asians working in Asian restaurants in the U.S.\n\nBy the way: service was extremely fast, and it's pretty close to the most whimsical place in San Francisco...

Truly.  I'm not making this stuff up.  I'm not even telling you this solely because I don't know a cleverer way to intro my Old Siam Thai Restaurant review, although I would be lying if I said that that didn't play any part in my decision.\n\nI mean, seriously, who wouldn't want to see these gangly British guys performing hits like \"Favourite Shirts (Boy Meets Girl)\" and \"Love Plus One\"?  Except that they're not in their twenties anymore, so they're probably not gangly, and even if they are thin in that rare way that a 58-year-old David Byrne can be, they wouldn't look particularly thin, which would ruin some of the magic, I think.  But then you'd hear that weird horn bridge part of L+1, and you'd be magically transported to your childhood, and the strangeness of sonic memory-feeling connections would get stuck in your mind, and assuming you didn't ingest too many controlled or uncontrolled substances, this experience would probably stick with you for a while.  Haircut One Hundred.  In 2011.\n\nI'm always suspicious of places that list non-vegetarian-looking ingredients in the descriptions of their offerings in the vegetarian section.  It's a different animal when it's an all-vegetarian restaurant.  Then, I assume that the chicken isn't really chicken and the beef isn't really beef.  But at a normal Thai restaurant--scratch that--a less-then-normal-for-San Francisco Thai restaurant?  Please.  Oyster sauce can be made from mushrooms, I believe, and this vegetarian version might actually be cheaper than the real animal (gotcha!), so I have no doubt that Old Siam Thai Restaurant uses non-oyster-derived oyster sauce.  But what if it doesn't?  Well, my friends, it might deserve a\n\nGRATUITOUS-MEAT ALERT\n\nListen, Ed U.  I understand and appreciate most of what you're about.  I've clicked so many clicks that I don't feel the need to explain myself; but I really should have visited Thai Dishes with my father, brother, and nephew; and I kind of blame you, sort of.\n\nThe '80s interior is pretty spectacular.  I love that it was clearly done recently.  It feels like some strange Asian-influenced airport lounge straight out of my childhood imagination on the ride home from my great-aunt's house after she and my great-uncle had returned from a trip to Singapore, which they called the Orient.\n\nThe food is all right.  It's nowhere near as good as I expected it to be, but I really don't know why I was expecting so much.\n\nBack to Haircut One Hundred.  True two-hit wonders are the rarest of breeds.  And although there is a slew of bands that name their songs irreferentially (think New Order), how many true two-hit wonders can you say the same of?\n\nOh, the servers wear special shirts.

Then we ordered and it took probably 10 minutes to get our drinks. \n\nThe girls working all looked busy. I did not notice any of them just hanging out and chatting, but all the same, there seemed to be a serious lack of staff organization. \n\nI'd probably go back if I was in the area and not in a rush to be served, but I wasn't exactly wowed by the place.", "author": "Lauren L."}

Not only bland, but no flavor. I used the curry sauce added to the noodles for it to be edible. DO NOT RECOMMEND.\n\nPineapple fried rice was bland. Lots of curry powder thrown in as they cooked the rice, so it coated the rice with a gritty powder taste. Pineapple, chicken and some cashew nuts were tossed in as well.\n\nThe salmon green curry was okay. The salmon was not fresh and overcooked. The green curry however was flavorful. We ordered Medium and there was a little heat.\n\nOverall, I would not come back for the food.\n\nThe service was inattentive and lacking -  the worst Thai restaurant in terms of service that I have encountered. I think that it must have been a really off night. However, first impressions do count. I had to chase down the waitress to seat us after a 30 minute wait. She tried to seat some folks who just walked in the door, brushing off the sign up sheet. Then she walked away without giving us menus. After 5 minutes. I just got up and grabbed the menus from the front. Another 10 minutes later, someone came to take our order. When we got our food, we had to move our empty soup bowls and beer bottles to a nearby bench to have room for our plates and food. The extra dishes, bowls and bottles were never picked up. We were never offered a refill for water or even asked if we wanted another drink. All I can say is that I was happy to pay and leave, I just wanted to leave behind that disappointing experience.", "author": "Kiki D."}

Happy to try something new, I was hopeful that I had found another gem in the city. Too bad this wasn't really one of them. \n\nSince it was my first time, I wanted a little variety so I had the lunch combination which came with fried rice, vegetable pad thai, and two entree choices. I went with the chicken satay and the BBQ chicken.\n\n1. Fried rice -- pretty plain stuff. It was primarily just white rice and some scrambled eggs. Bland to say the least.\n\n2. Vegetable pad thai -- This was better than the fried rice but the sauce they used for the noodles seemed artificial. Maybe, it's because I am accustomed to a different flavor for pad thai but this wasn't so great. Also, the vegetables were undercooked.\n\n3. Chicken satay -- I liked it. It came with some peanut sauce and was pretty tasty. Too bad there were only two skewers. \n\n4. BBQ Chicken -- Probably my favorite item out of the four choices. Juicy chicken that was cooked just right. \n\nAll this for about $10, which isn't too bad.\n\nWaitresses are very nice and prompt.\n\nNormally, I'd probably give this place a 3 star as it was an average Thai place. Nothing special. However, just as a finished eating, I saw a pretty large bug crawling up the wall near my table. Maybe, it was just a freak accident and this was a rare occurrence but it still made me question the cleanliness of the restaurant. Thus, I docked off 1 star. \n\nI'm unlikely to come here again....at least for lunch. Based on other reviews, it looks like their dinner food could be better. However, I'll be more hesitant until I can confirm the sanitation level of the place is up to par.\n\n2 stars.", "author": "Jonathan L."}

He ordered the pad thai ($7.25), a thai iced tea ($2?), and I a pad se-ew ($7.25), plus spring rolls (I think it was ~$5).\n\nI feel full just reminiscing about it.\n\nThe presentation for his pad thai was quite nice--noodles in one corner and an artfully displayed lot of unrelated produce on the other. From what I tried, the noodles were chewy and springy, a definite plus. The only complaint I have is that the shrimp and chicken in the dish were a bit tough from being over-cooked.\n\nThe presentation of my pad se-ew was not as glamourous--no garnish or fancy what have you--but still tasted alright nonetheless. I'm a sucker for Chinese broccoli, and there was a good amount mixed in this dish. The flat rice noodles were evenly coated brown, and were flavourful without being oily of overbearing. I found the portion rather generous, finished half and ended up saving the rest for dinner.\n\nThe spring rolls were crispy and hot with obviously fresh ingredients inside. I want to say that garnish is relatively useless and wasteful, but it just made it pop by jazzing up half the plate. I believe it came with four rolls, all cut in half, making that a total of eight pieces.\n\nAnd the Thai iced tea! Oh man. I had a sip but that was all I needed. It's pretty good here: creamy, and perhaps a bit sweet for my taste.\n\nOverall, decent prices for good food.

Living in the TL, there are plenty of Thai places to choose from, but if you want savory, flavorful food, you must come here.\n\nYes, the prices are slightly higher than before the renovations, but even then, they are cheaper than other popular trendy Thai places in the area. The quality is still superb and the portions large. Plus, they now accept credit cards.\n\nMy passion is curry, and I'm often disappointed by Yelp's high-ranked places that serve a mediocre, watered-down imitation. Old Siam's curry is rich, spicy and pops with flavor. Red is my favorite, but their green and yellow curries are also excellent. My only criticism (not just here, but at most Thai places) is a lack of vegetables in the curry. Bamboo shoots, carrots and bell peppers are fine, but any meat choice tends to drown out the balance. I guess this is great if you're feeling exceptionally carnivorous, but I find myself ordering the vegetarian Gang Pak more often.\n\nThe eggplant, green bean and duck noodle soup dishes are all wonderful here. And as much as I love and respect Osha, Old Siam's Spicy Thai Pan-Fried rice noodles wins hands-down. You get that fantastic smoky charred wok flavor that takes you back to eating at a stall on the side of a Bangkok road. Garlicky, chewy and just the right amount of oil. Definitely a late-night comfort food. Unfortunately, Old Siam is only open until 11pm at the latest.\n\nLocated where it is, the place is usually filled with tourists from Union Square and neighboring hotels. Just ignore the backpacks and SF maps unfurled across people's tables. The new decor is nice but not pretentious. The staff is super friendly and always smiling. But the food is what stands out the most. But hey, that's what you would expect from a restaurant, right?", "author": "David N."}

While we were able to get seated immediately, I saw that it was reasonably full of other customers happily dining (Mental note: so far so good - crowded restaurant means good food). The decor and ambiance is comfortable enough - though the Christmas icicle lights in mid-July is a head-scratcher.\n\n I can usually set my expectations based on the size of a menu. The larger the menu the less quality I expect. With almost 100 items in the menu \"book\" - all priced around $10, I was mentally preparing my self for a mediocre meal.\n\n I ordered the Jerked Pork appetizer and the Sweet and Sour Chicken Fried Rice. The Jerked Pork was great with a spicy dip which gives it a \"buffalo wings\" flavor. However, I have mixed feelings for the Sweet and Sour Chicken. The Chicken was perfectly breaded with a light crispy crunch, and was very tender and juicy. The bed of fried rice however, should have been left in the cardboard box it was cooked in and thrown out. Seriously, I don't know how they prepared the rice, but all I could think of while eating it was an old wet cardboard box. Overall, I give The Old Siam good marks - despite the cardboard rice.

The two previous times I ate there at the actual restaurant.  That experience pushed me to get take out this time.\n\nThe two previous times at Old Siam we had a long wait and I do mean long.  Granted it was the lunch hour but people were just not being served fast enough and if you have to wait over 5 minutes for a beverage, that is too long.  And when you only get 60 minutes you can't wait to be served to enjoy any lunch hour before rushing back to work.\n\nThe menu is pretty extensive so I felt a little overwhelmed but pleased at the same time.  Overall I felt the prices were maybe 50 cents too high for the area (it's kinda near the tenderloin even though it's also near a ton of hotels).\n\nThe food quality is pretty solid though.

Okay, so I was brought up in a very Asian community, so even the Thai restaurants are probably Chinese-Thai at the least.  This restaurant is \"ok\" at its best.  It fills you up to the point where you're satiated, but maybe not stuffed.  We came here for dinner and they served us water at first.  Then they asked us if we wanted anything to drink (okay, don't you see us consuming water already?  I guess you want us to buy your Thai tea now, yes?).  Onto dinner.  We had their vegetarian pad thai special  (with curry) and the pad see ew.  We added the soup for $2, which asn't bad at all.  I was surprised they did not ask us how spicy we wanted the curry, but I guess they went with their intuition and gave us medium (good call.  Thank god we didn't have our mom here or she'd be pissed off since she can't handle spices at all!  haha)  Anyway, what made this restaurant even more \"low class\" was when the waitress asked us if we wanted dessert.  What?  So you charge for your lil sweet desserts, too?  I don't know, we interpreted that as an Americanized restaurant afterward.  I'm so sorry, I've been frequenting Thai restaurants that actually give you complimentary  (yep, FREE) desserts.

It was empty when we got there at 6pm on a Thursday, but filled up within the hour. I got the yellow curry combo with coconut soup. Delicious. And the portions were fairly large. It's a hole-in-the-wall place; I would come back again for dinner with friends. I don't think it's date worthy.", "author": "Corinthia C."}

Having been spoiled by having Manora Thai and Basil by my old office, Old Siam had a high bar to jump with me and so far, not quite.  I've had pad thai, tom kha gai, tom yum gai and some of the curries.  All are ok but not great.  The flavors don't jump out like I feel they should and the ingredients tend to meld together.  Not sure if it's just the chef or other things.  It's decent but not up to the level I think they should be.", "author": "Ron T."}

I was very hungry and tired, and just wanted to grab a bite to eat near my hotel. I did not have high hopes as i was assuming this was going to be a generic thai place like so many others i have tried.\n\nSo i ordered a cup of chicken tom yum soup and spicy beef and basil dish, both extra spicy.\n\nThe tom yum i got was a rather large bowl, and filled with meat and vegetables. The broth was very tasty, and really tasted good. I was very impressed.\n\nThe spicy beef dish was a lot different from what i usually get when i order this dish. The plate consisted of what looked like ground beef with rd and green peppers. I was surprised, as i was not expecting that . The taste however won me over. Very tasty and savory sauce, and the beef, while ground, was actually pretty good. I missed the onions usually in the dish, but overall it was pretty good. \n\nI think i am going to go back for another cup of tom yum before i leave town.", "author": "Andy C."}

I didn't stay long enough to bask in its beauty because I had to go back to work, but I did stay long enough to wait for my takeout.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-02-16", "description": "Old Siam was quite a find.  Four of us went for dinner on Saturday and had a great meal.  Starting off, we split two appetizer plates, then ordered four entrees -- two curries (green w/ salmon and eggplant, red w/ chicken), a prawn dish and a crab soup.  The portions were generous, the food was pleasantly spicy but not too hot (I usually prefer my curries hotter, but we were considering some tastebuds not used to the heat), and the service impeccable.  And all this for about $65 (including tax, but not tip).  I have to say that Old Siam, while not my favorite Thai restaurant in town, is a great value.  Another consideration is it location, just off Union Square/Hallidie Plaza behind the Hilton and Parc 55 hotels.  I'll definitely go back when I'm in the neighborhood for a show or shopping.", "author": "George W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-12-05", "description": "I happened upon this tiny place as it was directly behind our hotel.  It's not that easy on the eyes and there is a funny pillar right in front of the entrance which kind of blocks you from going inside.  On first glance it is not very welcoming, but this is quickly overcome.  The staff is genuinely courteous and appreciative.  I really think they are glad to have you as their guest and they treat you with warmth and kindness.  The tables are formica and the chairs are cheap and not very comfortable, but I digress.  Let us discuss the menu.\nMy first night, I had the #100, Gang Pak.  A La Carte is the way to go as you get a generous portion and can order rice on the side.  This dish is served in a bowl and is a piping hot mix of vegetables and tofu in a basil and red curry broth.  The flavors are very delicate and the spice is perfect.  For a cold night, this dish is the way to warm your heart and soul.  And, it is very healthy if you have been eating too many rich meals.  Dinner was so good that I  had to return for lunch the next day and have the exact same dish.  My boyfriend branched out and had the #76,  roasted duck.  It was succulent and decadent.  I had to refrain from stealing too many samples from his plate.  They serve this duck on top of a bed of Chinese Broccoli and this bed of greens is a health and perfect compliment to the duck.\n\nI had to try this place one more time for dinner and again had the vegetarian Gang Pak.  Again, it was perfect and delicious.  \n\nDay 4 I told my boyfriend to choose the lunch place.  He knew I really wanted to eat here one more time so he indulged me a 4th time in as many days!  I had to branch out and so I ordered the #92, Gang Koor, which is prawns in red curry with pineapple tomato, bell pepper and generous amounts of basil.  Yet another winner of a meal.  Just enough spice and all the flavors were delicate and balanced.  I was so sad to leave that day and not have the Old Siam as a meal option.  I will make this place stop number one on my next visit to the city by the Bay.  I would give it 5 stars, but the humble interior holds it back.  Never mind, the humble interior adds to the experience.  I give it 5 stars for being consistently delicious.", "author": "Molly M."}

When we got there we all wanted spicy soup and what better place than a Thai restaurant right? Well unfortunantely not at Old Siam.  When we asked for spices and hot sauce we got the typical siracha and other condiments. Not really that hot.  The soup was really good though. I had the fish ball soup and ate it so quick, but I was dissapointed that it wasn't spicy. Nothing like spice to clear you mind. Well as we were walking out I saw their specials and looked like it was geared more towards the non spicy crowd.  I'll come here again and maybe bring my own hot sauce. haha", "author": "Chris G."}

Within 1-2 minutes after ordering my food, my thai iced tea (which was a little too sweet but just needed a little bit of water) was on the table and my glass of water constantly filled by the numerous waitresses. After just a few minutes my pad thai was on my table and I began to devour my dish.

They closed for earthquake retrofitting and remodeling and renamed the whole thing The Old Siam Thai Restaurant. The ambiance is nicer, the prices are slightly, and only slightly higher, and the restroom is now accessible. But the food and the staff are the same, good and friendly respectively.\n\nHad the pra ram tofu. The peanut sauce, unlike most places, was not bland but rather had a nice spicy undercurrent. Very good. And they now offer brown rice (yay!).\n\nI had ordered the ala carte, but the waitperson wisely brought me (and charged me for) the cheaper rice plate. It was plenty. The price may have gone up, but the portion sizes are the same. \n\nThe Old Siam Thai Restarant therefore now beats it's sibling across the street both in ambiance and portion size. But the TV over the bar is gone, along with the bar itself. So if you really want the TV with your dinner, you'll have to go across the street to Siam Thai Restaurant in the Parc 55 hotel.
