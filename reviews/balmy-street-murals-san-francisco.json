With the gentrification that is currently ongoing throughout the city, this neighborhood is in the epicenter of it all. Look no further than what is going on in Dolores Park a few blocks away from this alley. \n\nYou have the rich techies and the I'm-better-than-you-attitude hipsters who have migrated in this neighborhood and priced out the locals who were and are still the backbones of the city. These are hard-working middle class citizens who can no longer afford a rent in this neighborhood, nor the city. The park has been run over by thugs and hoodlums every weekend and leaves a wake of devastation behind every single time. These people have no respect for the history, authority, culture, environment and diversity of the city and all act entitled simply because they can afford a 3K - 5K rent to live in this neighborhood. \n\nYup, the park has become the landfill of the privileged. Check out the video on this link:  http://kron4.com/2015/03/24/video-shows-uphill-battle-to-keep-dolores-park-clean/\n\nWhy is this rant relevant to this review, you may ask?\n\nWell, some of the murals on Balmy Alley depicts that; however, just like the diverse city that is San Francisco, it is and so much more. This is just one part of the story, but all are connected with different artworks and artists all collaborating to tell their story and our story. The Mission is the mecca of murals and Balmy Alley is solely devoted to giving the artists a canvas to express themselves. A place to be seen and heard: sometimes more powerful than the spoken word. \n\nThe talents behind these murals are like our conscience just to remind us that these are constantly playing out and have an impact on all of us whether directly or indirectly. All of the murals are organically created with the freedom one might not be afforded with if it were to be exhibited in a museum or a gallery. There are no restraints with each brush stroke and paint stroke, and that is the beauty in every single piece. All are unique, and each one special with a distinct story to tell from whimsical to political. Just like the city, a cornucopia of artwork and very diverse.", "author": "John G."}

Every single piece of the walls and garage doors are filled with color and sometimes covered with adornments. \n\n4. The block carries a crucially important historic and contemporary statement, drawing attention to anger over human rights and other abuses throughout Central America. \n\nIt is a visually striking and emotionally overwhelming tapestry, with a crucial narrative.

We had left our Airbnb apartment early in the morning to go for a long walk through the residential side streets in the Mission District. \n\nWe discovered many small alleyways with beautiful, colourful and unique murals on the way to the more well-known Balmy Alley Murals, as we strolled along 24th Street heading east from Mission Street. We were the only people exploring the alley during our visit which made for a peaceful and relaxed atmosphere. \n\nWe arrived at Balmy Alley (which stemmed off from 24th Street), and I was immediately impressed by the intricate detail and vibrant colours that the murals displayed, painted on garage doors and fences in this residential back lane. We wandered down the alley and stopped at each mural to admire the beautiful street art and take photos. The murals depicted a variety of scenes which included messages and images of a political/social nature, San Francisco landmarks and street scenes, influential and historical people in San Francisco among others. The murals displayed so much culture and history. \n\nAs we explored the alley, we met a man named Tony, who was sitting on his driveway with his Chihuahua. He was drinking a can of beer while simultaneously smoking a joint. Initially, I thought he was homeless, but I was wrong. He started chatting with us and was very friendly. He told us a little bit about himself and his background (he was a History and Cultural Arts major in college) and then shared with us the history of some of the murals and the people featured on them. He was a wealth of knowledge and it was interesting to learn from him! \n\nExploring and wandering down Balmy Alley was well worth my time in San Francisco. It was a unique and slightly off the beaten path experience, and I enjoyed learning about the history of the murals.", "author": "Brittany T."}

I always find something new everytime I come and it makes me wonder the history of this alleyway's creation and significance as most of the murals focus on central messages of immigration, police brutality,and civil rights for the Hispanic and Latinx communities.\n\nIt is not a long walk and is a little hidden in the neighborhood, but definitely come check it out for a cultural and emotional eye-opening afternoon stroll!", "author": "Kyrie S."}

My wedding photographer had taken gorgeous shots here before, and I had always wanted to see it for myself.\n\nOn first glance, it might look like just another mural. But as you stroll down the brick-laden street of Balmy, the art seems to leap off the walls (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_cOXVjvweYYDsfcrSRaZug?select=TimZ_Luuti7G4mGBgjFdtw). Not only are the colors vibrant, but some of the art is actually 3-dimensional (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_cOXVjvweYYDsfcrSRaZug?select=p6F8rAhc_0SWdSlWZDwOOw), which helps to mask some of the more industrial elements of this street (namely, the unattractive metal screens on the windows).\n\nIt's truly a Mission gem. I'm partial to it because it represents families like mine. My parents came to the United States from Mexico in the early 70's, at a time when the Mission district became home to lots of Latino families. Although the murals are not limited to latin-american subjects, it represents an artistic and political movement that I'm proud of.", "author": "Mariela D."}
