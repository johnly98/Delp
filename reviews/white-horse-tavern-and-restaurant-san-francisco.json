I THINK that this place was inspired by The White Horse Tavern in Newport, Rhode Island which some say is the oldest tavern in the US. I asked our server but he had no idea and I was lazy to ask anyone else because whatever.\n\nThey had about 4 beers on tap and a fake fireplace that didn't produce any heat. It looked so fake they might as well not even have it. Because it was cold and I was sitting by a fake fire place giving me nothing, I have to knock off a star. Furthermore, they did't even have a classic cocktail menu to go along with the theme.\n\nI got some sweet potato garlic fries which were decent--I wish I had gotten the regular (salt and pepper) garlic fries instead. I now know that sweet potato fries and garlic don't necessarily mix--better as separate entities.\n\nI'd come back to grab a random drink at a random bar, but this place is just alright. I was expecting more with the cool theme but it's really just a dive bar (so if that's what you're looking for this is it).", "author": "Marlon T."}

This no-frills English tavern is in a tourist filled area, and yet it remains decently priced, not full of tourists, and unpretentious. There's no trendy decor, but you are really transported into a old fashioned pub, resplendent with a fake fireplace and weapons hanging on the mantle. Fair warning, you will probably not have LTE in here. I was trying to check in but there was no connection.\n\nThere are plenty of places to sit, and I instantly beelined to the popcorn machine and stocked up on ~free~ pub mix and popcorn. They only have 3 or so beers on tap, but they had Langunitas so it was ok. We settled into seats in the back corner of the place to play Settlers of Catan and Cards Against Humanity. Since the bartender/waiter knew our friends, the service was pretty good, with plenty of joking insults being thrown around by both parties. I didn't order food myself, but I did have someone else's lemon pepper wings, which had good flavor and crispy skin. The fries are also nice.\n\nAs the night progressed, more people came in and a group of guys started a rowdy game of shuffleboard. I'm sure we didn't help with the noise level after we drank a round of Fernet! If you haven't had it, Fernet is a liquor that tastes a little like licorice and a lot like mouthwash. It reaaaally got me, haha. I had never heard of it, but apparently it is very popular in SF. \n\nIf you're feeling knackered after a long day at work, make sure to go with your favorite mates to White Horse, but don't get too tanked or you'll look like a wanker!", "author": "Ruth T."}

It's attached to the Hotel Beresford, and I'm guessing that's the only way it stays in business.\nThey USE to have the best clam chowder anywhere in San Francisco. No longer. Not sure why. The bartender didn't seem interested in having a conversation. He did make a good drink but that was the highlight of a lackluster experience sitting around the bar.\n\nFriends were comparing their cameras and looking through the lens, of course up into the light at the bar and all the bottles, and the bartender twice barked at them both that no pictures were allowed, and started to grab one camera from my friends hands. Luckily, he stopped short as I put my hand in front of the camera. No pictures were being taken tough guy, just looking at camera equipment. Chill. Bartender was a complete ass, skinny pepper haired 40 something probably paying a lot of alimony and mad at the world for only being a bartender at his age.\n\nRed headed waitress is much more concerned about her smoke breaks than serving you. I heard one patron come from the seating area in back, up to the front of bar just to ask for a spoon. Bartender \"pleasantly\" (dripping with sarcasm) had to run to the kitchen to get one.

I had a lot of fun watching the band and the bartenders were great and friendly.  It was at the end of the night that made my whole experience take a dive.  I did not know the bar was closimg as i was not paying attention to the time.  I was headed out to the patio to get some air as i was feeling a lot of anxiety in the place as it was very crowded something i had to do several times throughout the night.  ( a byproduct of my time in the military.)  \n\nAs i was headed out i was stopped by a door man and he asked what i was doing in a rude manner.  I said i am going out sode for some air and he said \"no we are fucking close turn around and go the fuck inside\".  If im lying im dying.  I said what? You know you could be a little more respectful when talking to people.  In which he responded \" do we have a problem?\"  Now i never cause problems anywhere and have many many friends in the bar industry and after talking to them about this i know it was innapropriate.   I said all i said is you could be nicer.  And he said \" alright its time for you to go grabbing my arm and pushing me.  I pushed his hand off and he then TRIED to put me in a hold.  I got out of it and told him not to touch me.  I was not at all aggressive until he put his hands on me.  \n\nThen another door man came up as i was trying to leave and they both grabbed me.  Now i knew fighting wpuld only make thinks worse and ruin my case.   So i left and i asked ti see the manager.  When the manager came out i explained everything in a calm manner and he said i dont beleive you i trust my guy amd not you.  \n\nNow i have all this on video during that time the \"head\" of security came up and got in my face aggressively telling to get the fuck out of there and im on private property with alcohol on his breath.  He claimed to only have one shot but the stench from his mouth told me very different.  I told him that he could not legally do his job while intoxicated.  Had he not been intoxicated he may not have been so aggressive and had a more level head about him. I also explained that i would alert TABC and he said \"TABC is all over us anyways so who cares\" Iwanted to talk to the owner or someone else in charge.  He then pushed me and another guy throwing him down to the ground.  Me not so much.  I then explained i would call the police.  \n\nWhen the police arrived i knew there would not be much they could do at that time. They asked me if i wanted to press asault charges on the head of security and to be honest i should have.  But i declined.  What they did tell me is that they have had issues like this before from this bar anx the best thing to do is to call TABC and file a complaint.  I told him I would.\n\nAgain i have this all on video and have not yet filed a formal complaint to TABC.  I want to speak with the owner.  If i cant then i will proceed with what i have to do.  I dont want this to happen to someone else.   Being a security gaurd or a bouncer or a door man does not give you rights to put your hands on someone.  Your job is to deescalate not escalate.  Your staff needs to be trained correctly.  I have been a bouncer, security gaurd, personal protection, and i know better.

She disappeared for another 20minutes then came back and asked us again how we were doing without the check or boxes. I reminded her again for the 3rd time. She came back 10 minutes later without boxes, and somebody else's check and credit card. \n\nAt this point it's clear she's incapable of doing her job and I have no idea after reading the reviews of this pub why she hasn't gotten fired. \n\nI take the credit card and check to the bar and wait patiently to speak with the bartender (blonde bigger woman).

I told her in the nicest way possible that I wasn't sure she was capable of getting our bill since we've asked her 4 times in 45minutes and she gave us someone else's card (I said nothing about the possibility of her being intoxicated.) The bartender then explained to me she's not able to get the checks at the bar and I'll have to get it from the waitress, so I asked her if she knew where the waitress was. The bartender ignored my question, directed her attention to the woman next to me and proceeded to help her as if I didn't exist. \n\nDespite being completely dissed by the bartender when I was only trying to do the right thing, I'm honestly worried about the red headed waitress's health as she was clearly not sober. And to be that high or drunk while working says she's probably got some deep issues going on. Again, I have no idea how she hasn't been fired. They must not be doing well as a bar. I wonder why... lol", "author": "Katie R."}

We had been looking for a bar where we could talk to each other without shouting and where the environment looked comfortable. The White Horse looked like the place as we stuck our heads in for a quick look!\n\nMy friend found us a seat and i went to buy us some drinks from the bar. this is where i am extremely confused how this bar, that gets good ratings, decided to hire (i  hope he is not the owner setting this sort of president) a short little bearded fellow with a chip on his shoulder and who perhaps through that he was in fact Conor McGregor. \n\nI asked \"do you have a drinks menu?\" and smiled at him. He stared straight at me and then abruptly said \"No\". \n\nFor a second i thought he would then offer up some suggestions like every other place where customer service matters. Having worked in bars i thought i'd give him this moment to respond. He then looked at me, raised his eye brows and very condescendingly said \"thanks a lot. good chat!\" Having lived in the UK i know this sort of rude tough guy mentality does sometimes happen from time to time but usually its when customers are being rude and acting inappropriately. \n\nSo in some shock i took in how much of a rude little boy our McGregor-want-to-be was and responded by saying how enjoyable the chat was for me also. \n\nI'm not sure why you would treat customers this way and as with all things in the internet age, we do have the ability to warn others not to waste their time attending bars where they are poorly treated.", "author": "Rick D."}

Anyone who serves free hot dogs and popcorn deserves five stars, period.\n\nAnyway, White Horse Tavern is a dumpy pub near Union Square. I usually hesitate to try anything near this tourist-ridden area, but I gave old Whitey a chance and I'm glad I did. The drink prices are excellent and the draft selection is surprisingly good. It's not just the standard Bud Light and such. There are a few microbrews on tap as well.\n\nThe pub was empty on a Thursday at 6:30 PM. There were no TVs and no music. It felt somewhat sad but somewhat awesome at the same time. Regardless, I'm not sure why it wasn't packed because there were plenty of fresh hot dogs and popcorn to go around.\n\nAgain, let me stress the importance of free hot dogs and popcorn. These items are self-service, so don't be afraid to get up and grab a dog or a bag of corn. Please note that this doesn't affect the delightfulness of it all, but it's simply worth mentioning.\n\nCome hungry, come thirsty and probably forget your wallet.

We were in a party of 9. She interrupted us when we were trying to talk to her and ask her questions and she had a very unwelcoming and ill-mannered tone. When we ordered our food, we asked if the burger was a shareable size and the waitress made it seem like the burger was huge, when it came, it was small and defiantly not a shareable size. Also, we ordered the chicken wings, and they didn't come when the rest of the food was served. about 10 minutes later we asked if the chicken wings were on their way. The waitress responded very rudely and with a lot of attitude. our chicken wings still hadn't have come after 20 minutes of everyone else getting their food. Everyone finished eating and we still hadn't got our chicken wings. When we asked the waitress about it again, she said that the fryer was having a problem and that they would be out in a few minutes. But the thing is, all the stuff that was ordered by the rest of our group was fried! Like French fries, fish and chips, and shrimp and chips. It was just an excuse. After 35 minutes, we ask the waitress why the wings hadn't come and she was still saying the fryer was have issues! They didn't offer to give them to us for free, or to take the drinks off the tab or anything. They didn't do anything to makeup for the fact that we weren't getting our food.

We were welcomed with a smile and a hello.  I was a bit surprised by the $8 per drink price (not expensive, but more than I expected), but they were well-made (although I think all manhattans should have bitters) and reasonably portioned at 4 ounces or so (as compared to those super-sized portions typical elsewhere).  \n\nWhite Horse has an old-school feel.  The interior is what I'd imagine an old English pub to look like.  The furniture is well crafted (if not entirely comfortable).  And it's quiet.  While it was mostly empty when we were there (on a Friday night), I couldn't imagine it being very loud even when it's full.  Conversation is very easy.  \n\nDespite an \"it's your grandfather's restaurant\" vibe, the food is good steak & potatoes stuff.  I had the filet mignon.  The meat tasted great--well seasoned and cooked.  Try the crab cakes.\n\nService is very friendly and not overly formal--actually, quite casual.

No pretentious a-holes and no drunk biotches puking in the bathroom (sorry that's another review that I have to write another time). \n\nI'm getting off topic though. The food: everything on the menu was less than $20. Where in all of San Francisco, let alone in Union Square can you find a meal for under $20? I'd say most of their dishes were in the low teens in fact. Decided to have the fried chicken because of course I'm obsessed with fried chicken.

Linguini with prawns or chicken, tossed with fresh spinach, tomatoes, and basil pesto, is $11.50. And this isn't cafeteria-style cooking, either.

I don't remember my exact thought process in choosing this establishment, but I think it was the following quote from one of the reviews that pushed me over the edge:  \"your Grandfathers restaurant and smells like old people.\"  In addition, the place received positive reviews and seemed like a unique and interesting place to check out.  \n\nDue to a game of kickball and several intense rounds of Flip-Cup the previous night, I was understandably exhausted all day leading up to the date.  Yet, after laying eyes on my Date's pretty face and soaking in her positive vibes, I was instantly energized and excited for our adventure into this mysterious dining establishment.  \n\nThe restaurant didn't exactly smell like old people...more of a combination of an antique store and a dusty attic.  The d\u00e9cor conjured up images of a regal family dining room in England (not that I've ever been there, but that's how I imagine it).   The friendly waitress seated us at a table with booth seating on one side and chair seating on the other.  The seating arrangement discrepancy caused my Date to tower over me which threw off our vibe completely.  We remedied this situation by taking it upon ourselves to cozy into the corner booth (the restaurant was empty).  We ordered some drinks and began to relax and soak in the vibes of this rustic establishment.  After a few drinks and much debate over what to order, my Date got some sort of fish dish and I got a steak.  Both were reasonably priced and delicious.  The atmosphere was very cozy and extremely quiet.  The only other people in the place were these two older women who sat in close proximity to us and were probably horrified at our conversation which consisted of college drinking stores, sexual innuendo and other inappropriate subjects.  \n\nThis is not the most happening spot in the city, but if you're looking for a quiet, cozy and unique spot to enjoy some reasonably priced fine dining, the White Horse is a great choice.  It is also a great place to wine and dine potential girlfriends: it worked perfectly for me.", "author": "Patrick N."}

The mashed potatoes were possibly the best we have ever had.  All at a very reasonable rate.  Very convenient location and great service.", "author": "Bruce M."}

Naturally, one of the first comments he made was \"This is quite English, really\" -- because you definitely feel as though you've stepped into some Tudor structure.  We didn't come for the food, just for drinks, so we sat in the bar area.  The bartender had to be one of the oldest bartenders in San Francisco, but he was quite friendly and helpful.  We were the youngest people in the bar area by about 20 years, but no matter -- it felt very neighborhoody, especially since I grew up going to bar/restaurants (or pubs) rather often with my parents.  Drinks were good, atmosphere was rather impressive/interesting/surreal, and prices were normal.  Minus 1 star for not being somewhere I'd want to go every night.", "author": "Casey S."}

This little restaurant is a charming gem in the city if you want a slow night of decent food at reasonable prices.\n\nMy date and I were seated in the dining room which had only 1 server for 10 or so tables. Based on the reviews I'd read, I was surprised that there weren't many more people in the dining room. Both of us ordered the renowned ($18!) filet mignon. I also had a starter of goat cheese salad with roasted red peppers and greens. The salad was good - the cheese pungent with a crusty skin - but slightly overdressed by the balsamic vinaigrette. The star of the meal really was the filet, which, for me, was cooked a perfect rare. The mushroom, shallot, and cabernet sauce was rich and spot-on in flavor (it may be slightly too salty for some), and it balanced perfectly with the sauteed vegetables, the chives mashed potatoes, and the tender meat. I swabbed the plate clean of every last drop of the delicious sauce with the rest of the plate. I would have picked up the plate and licked it clean had there not been a proper English couple seated next to us (with accents and all; I told you...old England!). \n\nIt's not just the $18 filet mignon and the delectable sauce. It's not just the menu that probably hasn't been changed and has been perfected for decades. It's not just the feeling of entering another world, where everything is slower and easier. It's everything rolled up together into an unassuming package that makes White House Tavern & Restaurant such a winner.", "author": "Ian S."}

The first time we dined here we were almost afraid of what the food was going to be like due to the low prices. Every item we have tried has been fantastic. If I lived in the city I would be dining here at least once a week as the service has always been fantastic. Steve is a wonderful waiter and will make sure you have a great dining experience. If your looking for a place out of the ordinary this is it!", "author": "KJ J."}

It's one of those places that rarely exist anymore, especially in SF.  Just kind of old timey and precious.  I got the rack of lamb which which was simple and amazing.  The asparagus soup was also delicious, mmmm.  I need to go back and try the rest of their menu, looking forward to the fried chicken and filet mignon.", "author": "Sophie P."}

It was tender and juicy and my tummy was satisfied.", "author": "kenny l."}

It's not fancy but they were always very on top of things.  Sort of funny story...we took my father in law, who was a fussy guy there and it was a hassle to get him over there because he wasn't easy to trek around, old and senile as he was.  So we got him there like I think it was Father's Day or something, and he first said \"you went to all this trouble to bring me HERE?, shit\" in a real loud voice.  I think he was expecting some place like Harris' or something which this place isn't, and anyway, after that opening line, he orders a steak, and he starts complaining the moment the gets it \"it's tough! what kind of place did you bring me!\".. well the truth is, the steak was probably just fine, but the waiter took it back and brought him a new one no charge. Personally I felt like having a napkin over my head, but the waiter was kind and patient.  That's the point, they were nice about the old guy and didn't blink and eye.  I liked every meal I had there, must go back ... now that the father in law has passed on to his reward.", "author": "Sarah H."}

I simply wish they'd close the curtain on the entrance to the kitchen. The noise and glare from the kitchen diminished the coziness of the room. If you go be sure to request a table as far from the kitchen as possible.", "author": "Eileen M."}
