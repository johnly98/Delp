Go and eat the Azteca Burrito (which is basically an \"enchilada-style burrito\" or \"burrito mojado\") at Mexico au Parc and tell me you don't wanna put a ring on it. I dare you. I'm not saying this to scare you or raise your expectations, I just want you to be prepared for the strong emotions you're gonna feel. It's cheesy and juicy and towards the end a little bit messy and gooey--but in a good way. I like to get extra cheese on mine and I'll be honest, sometimes when I feel like being bad, I'll get some guac on the side. The best part: it's under $10. Yes, it IS possible to have lunch for less than $10 in SF!! Who needs a spouse when you can have this hot mess?! (Please don't tell my husband I said this. I mean, he's alright, but he's no Azteca Burrito.)\n\nCan you get better Mexican in SF? Of course you can. The sky is the limit! But when you're hangry AF and you don't wanna walk too far to get lunch (especially bc you fear the risk of bumping into your ex who works down the street or whatever) this is more than enough.  \n\nTip: For the best experience, go BEFORE NOON. I'm talking like 11 or 11:30. It's never too early for a burrito anyways.\n\nMy reason for deducting 1 star: The two-line system can be confusing at first and sometimes it takes a while for your order to come out. I've maybe had one burrito that maybe wasn't as \"fresh\" tasting, but that's life. Can't let one and burrito ruin the whole establishment. The staff are friendly and service is always great.", "author": "Rie U."}

They always ask you for sour cream, guac, and salsa and if you say you only want 1, you'll still be charged for ordering everything. So it's either you're all in, or you out!  There's a lot of different types of meats to pick from which is cool. I even saw a tofu option for the vegetarian/vegans. \n\nQuality of the food/meats are OK but the menu pricing is super misleading. It has happen twice where the menu prices bamboozle you once you pay at the register, after you already ordered your food so you don't really have a choice.. I don't eat out a lot in the city so I don't really like that uncertainty in pricing here. Azteca burrito is listed to be about $10ish bucks on the menu. I go to pay and the total was about $14. I asked for a receipt later on (after a couple customers already gone after me) but was told it was too late already.. Chips and a salsa bar are here too so that's a cool touch if you dine in.", "author": "Tiffany Z."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-09-09", "description": "OKAY, this place is WAY underrated! Hands down the BEST vegan (maybe vegan?) burrito I've ever had. I ONLY went to this place because I happened to temporarily work in SF. Original Bay Area folks know, if you're from Oakland and currently live in Oakland, you DON'T go to SF unless absolutely necessary and there are no alternatives. (At least the folks I know, lol). I took a Lyft to Mexico Au Parc on my lunch break to try it for the first time. The location is super cute. There is a park right across the street that is nice if you have the time to sit and eat. Now, what I didn't expect was a line outside of the restaurant! I had to ask about why there were two lines and quickly caught on that you could order from the grill in a separate line, so I jumped in that line, which happened to be shorter that day. I explained that I wanted a vegan burrito (listen, I'm not that strict of a vegan, so if something is in a tortilla that isn't vegan - I DON'T WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT).  I got a grilled veggie burrito which optionally has broccoli in it, which I wanted nothing to do with. I also added guac, and asked for no sour cream. They cook the veggies right next to the meats, so ... you should know that. They give you a small bag of chips (similar size to any other Mexican restaurants). Getting salsa is kind of a challenge, simply because there are a ton of people and everyone is moving everywhere. I do not know if they marinate these vegetables in a literal cow or season it with some sort of unicorn blend but this burrito is effing delicious for no understandable damn reason at all. Like, WHAT?! How!? So, of course, a Lyft ride + Long lines + crazy bustle + delicious burrito = I went back 4 times in a row.  Its Sunday, they aren't open. They are only open during standard business hours to serve employees of the surrounding offices... and here I am.. ready to travel to SF on a Sunday for this grilled veggie burrito, because they do things right. Tip: Do yourself a favor and call in your order so you can prance in and pass up everyone in line and wait (yep, wait) like 5 minutes instead of 20 minutes for you food.

You can pay extra for guacamole and sour cream inside your quesadilla, which I highly recommend. The quesadilla lasted me 2 meals because it was so huge and filling! I also recommend the chorizo breakfast burrito - I had half of it for breakfast, and I was full until the early afternoon and only ate half of my lunch. The salsas here are also fresh and yummy, but could be a bit spicier.

The top of their menu had 'Azteca Burrito', which had a long list of ingredients (meat, sauce, vege, beans, etc). It sounded cultural too, so I eagerly ordered it.\n\nThey asked me what meat I'd like and I said chicken. As expected, they put chicken in there. From this point on, everything became a cultural shock.\n\nRight after they put the chicken in, they wrapped up the burrito. I did not have time to protest, I was surprised because they didn't put in any sauce, onions, lettuce, or anything else that was promised in the 'Azteca Burrito'. By the time I came around to it, the burrito was in the oven. My co-worker was right next to me so I played it cool and didn't make a sound, but in my head I was thinking \"wtf?\"\n\nAs if they read my mind, they took out my tiny burrito, scooped up a spoonful of red sauce, and I watched in horror as they poured it ALL OVER my burrito. WTF!? At this point,\nI was in complete shock. I pictured myself grabbing that liquid burrito in my hands, dripping \n with sauce, eating and smiling with complete disregard of civility. Not Today. I watched in disbelief as they proceeded to put avocados and other sauces on top of  the burrito and at this point it looked like a mush of everything. You could barely see the burrito at this point. My knees were wobbly. \n\nI was quiet the whole time because I had an internal struggle to keep myself together. Usually when I order food I would make a lame comment about the weather, art, or whatever. But this time I was completely quiet.\n\nEventually, I figured out that I should be eating the burrito with a knife and a spoon, and that is what I did. It was decent, but I still wished I had a normal burrito instead. I want the good 'ol burrito that I am used to. ( They call it the Super burrito )\n\nI also ordered Horchata drink (it looks white and creamy) because my coworker said it's amazing and tastes like melted churros. I like Churros, but not the drink. \nLiking churros != liking Horchata. \n\nHorchata tastes like melted cinnamon + mint + sugar, and has a soft-rough texture.

It is nothing to write home about, and I wold never seek this place out if I didn't work literally around the corner, but I am always satisfied after eating here.\n\nMexico au parc (yes, a Mexican restaurant with a French name, indeed thaat's indicative) has a great location right on South Park in SOMA. Come lunchtime, the place is flooded with the daily mix of techies on a lunch break from their startups (I'm in that group) or art students from the Academy of Art across the street. There's often a long line at lunch, but it moves very quickly for takeout. Sitting inside at peak time can be more stressful.\n\nThere's two lines--get in the line to the right. The other line inside is more expensive options. If you want a grab and go meal, which you probably do, get on the right side. Do not expect friendly service--they are trying to get everyone in and out as soon as possible.\n\nThe meats look really good and I've been told they are and that the sauces are bomb, but as a vegetarian I get the Tofu Ranchero or the Supper Veggie burritos. Both come to under $6 and I can save half if I'm not totally starving. Note: I ask for hot salsa and these are NOT spicy. Everything here needs more flavor!\n\nGood selection of tortillas--whole wheat I'm a fan of, Spinach is also an option--and they move fast. The burritos I mentioned are satisfying--they are definitely filling--but you are not going to bite into one and think \"DAMN that's a good burrito!\" You will think \"Yay, my stomach is not growling anymore.\" And that counts for something. They are decent, not great.\n\nWhen you go to pay they will put a handful of chips in your bag, which is nice. The chips are NOT GOOD. Maybe just because I am a saltaholic but these taste unsalted and kind of taste like nothing. Then you get your own salsa at the bar next to the registers. The red onion/cilantro (at least I think that's what it is!) are bomb. And I haven't tried the aguas frescas yet but they look delicious.\n\nBottom line: decent food. Great setting. It'll satisfy you. But don't come from far away to go here. Grab a burrito, sit on a park bench, soak up the sun, and all will be well.", "author": "Courtney A."}

South Park was jumping with commerce today!  The economy is alive and well in San Francisco.  People were interviewing at the tables, talking about new job assignments, and phoning me with opportunities.  Yes, phoning, but none of the other diners seemed to mind.  \n\nThe steam table looked about normal for a burrito shop.  I ordered 2 super tacos, which turned out to be beans, rice, shredded lettuce, shredded cheese, sour cream, and carne asada piled so high on 4\" flour tortillas that I couldn't even see the tortillas.  These, with a real Coke hecho en Mexico, cost $9.75, and I got a free basket of corn chips on the side.  There was also a salsa bar, in case I wanted something on the chips.  I ate the tacos with a fork, because I couldn't pick them up.  \n\nThe weather was beautiful, as were the clientele, and it was a pleasure to walk through the park before and after lunch.  The Gran Oriental Filipino Masonic Hall dominated the scene, and apparently had a lot to do with the park's redevelopment and revival -- there were also Gran Oriental Filipino apartments on the north side of the park.  \n\nIt would be nice if the 30 and 45 stopped closer to South Park, but I was able to find the offset bus stop \"at 3rd and Brannan\" without too much trouble.

It's a good value, very quick service, it's tasty and you can't complain about the portion sizes.\n\nNote: it can be a bit hard to get a table during lunch, if you're with more than 2 or 3 people. It can be even harder if people with room to share, refuse to share.\n\nThere are entire picnic tables (complete with benches) in the dining area. When the place gets crowded, more than one group might have to sit at a single table.  But on my visit, a single person was possessed to sit at one of these picnic-style tables and copped an attitude when asked if the 4 of us could sit at the other side of the table.\n\nIt was sorta fun to watch the expression on his face after he snarled at us that \"I'm sitting here!\" and the 4 of us sat down anyway. Even though there was still enough room at that table for 4 more people, he scarfed down the remainder of his food, slamming down his fork after each bite and slamming down the bottle of tea after each swig.\n\nEach time he did this, the group of us snickered. So he'd slam them down even harder. More snickering. Snowball effect. Mocking the douchebag became almost like a sport.\n\nAfter the douche dramatically stormed out, another person asked if he could sit at the table. \"Sure, go ahead.\"  And we finished the meal in peace. Amazing how much farther you get in life when you're not a prick to others.\n\nOf course, our interaction with he-who-never-gets-laid isn't influencing my review of this eatery; it just made it a bit more memorable.

I don't know why there was cheese on there because it seemed wrong, but it was consumed so quickly I didn't really notice.

It was a purplish tint, with a hint of jalapeno.  It was pretty amazing.  I'd probably return just for that.  The quesadillas looked good too.  \n\nI liked how the walls were covered with prints of Diego RIvera, pictures of Frida Kahlo and other Mexican art.  Pretty classy joint.\n\n----ETA - I just took a bite into the 2nd half of the burrito I couldn't finish (it's a few days later) and I found the hot salsa that didn't seem to be there before...would be nice if I could've had this when I was choking down the first bit.

They definitely need to rethink their construction strategy.\r\n\r\nFlavor wise, the burrito was ok. Nothing mind blowing, maybe not worth the long walk from my office (we passed another taqueria, Victor's, on the way over but heard this place was better).\r\n\r\nThe salsa verde rules, which made my day. Nothing makes a so-so burrito taste better than good salsa..", "author": "a a."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-05-22", "description": "Really nice little spot close to where I live. It's not as dive-y as El Farolito, and definitely a lot cleaner. The prices aren't as cheap as what you'd find in the Mission, but the location is worth it. The salsa is fresh and really delicious - the tomato to water ratio is higher than at other places. The only way to have a burrito here is Azteca - which means they put enchilada sauce on top, along with sour cream and guacamole. YUM! However, the burritos are smaller than what I'm used to, and the meat is a little lacking in flavor.", "author": "Charrylenne S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2008-03-27", "description": "In an area that became very popular during the dot-com boom South Park is a nice slice of tranquil heaven in the middle of a rather busy area.  Mexico au Parc is a delicious spot when you cash goes far and quality is not spared.  My friends call me the bottom less pit since I seem to eat 24-7 and their Quesadillas even fill me up.  Ever order come with chips and the salsa is fresh and ranges from mild to burn-your-mouth-good.  I am normally not a huge fan of Mexican cuisine but the food here has made a believer out of me, the enchiladas are to DIE for.  The people are quick and friendly and even during the lunch time rush you can get in, get you food, and get out in 10 minutes and generally spend less the 7 bucks for your meal AND a drink.  There is something nice about coke in a glass bottle.  The restaurant is not REALLY set-up for a lot of in house dinning but there is a lovely park right out side.  Most of the portions are so generous half fills you up and then you have a nice snack for later.  If you are in South Park, GO HERE.", "author": "Amy P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-01-10", "description": "this is a very solid restaurant/taqueria.  as for the items i go for veggie super and meat quesadillas.  it is a solid option for lunch that's for sure.  lately i've been relying more on the super veggie for daily sustenance.  reason being, $4.50 2 meals.  good value.  there is nothing spectacular about this place though.  i think one of the reasons it does deserve 4 stars is the consistency and obvious value.  lack of similar taquerias in the area might have influenced me though.", "author": "Anthony Y."}
