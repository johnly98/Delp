I've tried taiyakis with red beans before, but I never thought that they could come with icecreams on top! \n\nThey offer different flavors, but I recommend you to start off with matcha icecream your first visit and black sesame for your second visit! \n\nMy favorite combination has been, \nSmall Taiyaki w/ Red Beans Fillings + Matcha flavor + chocolate sticks & matcha powder so far. \n\nIt starts with ice-cream of your choice on the top and as you move further down, you would be able to eat it with taiyaki cone and end with taiyaki + red beans at the bottom (last part seems to be my favorite!)", "author": "Justyn P."}

I chose matcha soft serve on top, black sesame on the bottom, a red bean paste filling at the bottom of the taiyaki cone, and topped with pocky sticks and matcha powder. I came on a Sunday afternoon and waited about 15 minutes till I was able to order, then about another 5 to get my order. \n\nThe matcha flavor wasn't very strong in my opinion, so I thought it was just alright. I liked the black sesame much better because it has a strong, bold flavor. I also got to try some of my boyfriend's tofu flavor, which reminds me more of soy milk than the actual tofu taste. As for the taiyaki cone, I thought it was a little salty and the batter was a bit dense. The cone goes really well with the red bean paste filling, though, so I'd recommend getting that. \n\nThe shop is very small, and since there are a bunch of people waiting inside for their order, it gets pretty stuffy. There's also no seating area so you'd have to take your dessert outside, which is a better idea anyway so it doesn't melt everywhere. Overall, I'd say if you haven't tried it before, you should, since it's a unique and picturesque dessert. I probably wouldn't make a trip across town for it, but I'd stop by if I was in the area and in the mood for some taiyaki and matcha/black sesame soft serve.", "author": "Bonnie N."}

There's signs that asks you to wait outside and wait to be called into order, which is smart so we're not all trying to fit in the small place like sardines. The staff works very fast and gets everyone in and out ASAP to avoid any mix ups/over crowding.

The large size is enough for 2 people or 1 if you're loving it aka me. There was no line so when we went so it was fast ordering and serving and eating it of course. I'd recommend coming here after eating a meal in the area or if you have a sweet tooth.", "author": "Mark D."}

So far I have tried the Matcha, Black Sesame, Tofu, Strawberry Rose, Pumpkin Miso, and Sweet Potato. For a non-sweet tooth, order the Tofu soft serve. To my surprise, my favorite was Sweet Potato. Sadly, it was a seasonal flavor and it didn't look that pretty for pictures, but it was very naturally sweet tasting, and I wish that was on the everyday menu. \n\nAlso, I have tried these softserve on a Takoyaki, waffle cone, and just a cup. I wish the takoyaki was crispier, instead the texture was more like an egg puff. The waffle cone doesn't taste right with softserve, should just be for ice cream in my opinion, therefore i prefer my Uji Time in a cup.\n\nIn addition, this location is in the heart of Japantown conviently located near Daiso,  grocery stores, and many popular resturants.", "author": "Sarah T."}

I ordered a deluxe taiyaki fish cone with 1-2 flavors and 2 toppings for $7.99 + tax. Choose a filling of red beans, Nutella, or none. They filled my cone with Nutella, matcha below, seasonal hojicha on top, 3 matcha pocky sticks, plus rainbow sprinkles. Small taiyaki $5.99 comes w/ 1 soft cream flavor and 2 toppings while large $6.99 has 1-2 flavors, no toppings.\n\nI don't know if it was my hot hojicha tea experience at Samovar 3 hours prior, but the soft cream wasn't to my liking. Not creamy enough and I might've gotten tired of the flavor. Matcha was on point, not too bitter nor sweet. I prefer Matcha Love's hojicha ice cream. Their taiyakis are premade so the estimated wait time was only a minute on the electronic menu board, despite the 5-15 min paper notice. It's definitely more thick and pancake-like than I'm used to. My first taiyaki experience was at Recess in SJ, hot and crispy with a soft interior and comes in flavors like green tea, taro, red velvet, and pumpkin. I've become accustomed to made to order cones. At least the premade one from Uji didn't melt my ice cream.\n\nThey also have mochi ice cream and slushes offered here. I wonder what the tofu soft cream tastes like, must be popular to be a menu regular. I'll try a sample in the future. Customer service is nice, nothing to complain about.

The taiyaki comes out fresh and warm, making the cone drippy. Its not hot enough to melt the ice cream at the top, but just expect a steady drip at the bottom of the cone. NAPKINS are a must.\n\nThere will most likely be a line out the door, especially since its a small storefront. Also you can smell the delicious taiyaki from a block away, so what do you expect?

Probably waited close to 20 minutes. Once inside decided on their Summer flavor of Strawberry Rose in a small Taiyaki cone with dango. At the pick up window, I was told that they had no dango and they could give another topping and had to settle for some Pocky sticks- mind you, toppings cost extra.\n\nThe flavor of the Strawberry Rose was okay, more Rose tasting than strawberry which made it hard to finish when it was like eating really floral perfume. It was also too icy instead of the advertised \"soft cream\", seemed to be more of a sherbert than soft serve which was disappointing. The cone itself was okay. This dessert is definitely more for the aesthetics and the gram than it is for consumption, it's very messy to eat.\n\nThe shop itself is super small, it's more of a grab and go place. Perhaps the seasonal flavor wasn't a good choice, since it looks like the matcha is their signature flavor here.

I wasn't intentionally seeking Uji Time out, but we passed it on our way to grab ramen from Marafuku and our dessert spot was decided right then and there. They must get pretty busy later on in the day, as there was a sign telling you to wait outside until it was your turn at the cashier. \n\nDon't be afraid to ask for samples, except maybe let the cashier know if you want to sample all 4 flavors (matcha, black sesame, tofu, and seasonal) so they don't have to keep walking back to the soft serve machine...hehe, sorry! Matcha was alright - pretty weak tea flavor. Current seasonal flavor is honeydew melon, and they got the flavor spot on! Really refreshing. Tofu reminded me of doufufa, or the silken tofu pudding you can get at dim sum - my friend was not so much a fan of this. I ended up getting black sesame on a small taiyaki, but it was a pretty close call with the tofu and melon. My friend got the large taiyaki for a dollar more with the black sesame and melon. The taiyaki itself it slightly sweet and they seem to be inconsistent with how cooked it is - mines was darker than my friend's. It certainly is very photogenic, but not the best vessel for soft serve - I had soft serve dripping down my arms by the time I got to the tail, and I eat FAST.\n\nThey can swirl the matcha and black sesame, but if you want to mix any other flavors you'd have to get a large/deluxe. Red bean/nutella is an optional filling for the taiyaki, and I didn't realize so I wasted one of my toppings on red bean, which is literally a scoop of red bean held in place with a popsicle stick...bound to fall off.

It was one of my absolute favorite dessert places to visit with friends. After graduating, I rarely ventured north of San Francisco so I was super excited when I heard that Uji Time was opening another location in Japantown. \n\nI came on a Wednesday afternoon, and there was a line to order but it moved pretty quickly. I really wanted to try the dango (mochi) topping but they were sold out so I decided to just go with the regular taiyaki cone ($6.99). This comes with a full-sized taiyaki and your choice of 1-2 flavors of soft cream. I've tried the matcha, black sesame, and tofu flavors at Berkeley, and my favorite has always been matcha. It's earthy, sweet, and has a pretty concentrated flavor. The tofu flavor is really unique - it tastes like soy milk and tofu pudding but in a frozen yogurt form. The Japantown matcha and tofu soft creams were pretty identical to Berkeley's. The Taiyaki cone tastes like a thick, crunchy waffle, and the red bean at the bottom is always a nice surprise. I enjoyed my dessert, as always. \n\nUnfortunately my experience as a whole wasn't as great as I expected. This Uji Time had a very different vibe than the one in Berkeley. I fondly remember sitting at the Berkeley location for up to 1 hour sometimes, just chatting with friends, playing board games, and enjoying our desserts. At the Japantown location I felt extremely rushed, and there was nowhere to sit and enjoy the ice cream. In addition, the cashier was extremely unfriendly. I had a couple questions about the toppings and prices, and she seemed really annoyed.\n\nI'm still giving this place 4 stars because my ice cream was tasty and brought back fond memories of my dessert outings in Berkeley, but my experience as a whole was a bit of a letdown.", "author": "Tiffany L."}

Maybe it was because I was already full to the brink of pain, but I wasn't terribly impressed with this place.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n\n1/2 Stars for Taste --\nI tried the matcha, black sesame, and pumpkin miso (seasonal) before ultimately settling on the pumpkin miso. I think all three were more subtle flavors. If you had blindfolded me and made me guess the three flavors, I probably wouldn't be able to guess them without much lip-smacking and deep thought. I wouldn't say the pumpkin miso tasted particularly like pumpkin or miso, I ultimately just chose it because I'm a fan of savory-sweet combinations. Also, FYI their ice cream borders more on the icy side and less on the creamy side. (I must confess I tend towards creamier ice cream, but that's a personal preference.) I found the taiyaki to be a little over hard/dry, but I think most places make it that way to withstand the sogginess of melted ice cream. \n\n0.5/1 Stars for Value --\nIt was $5.99 for a small taiyaki (1 flavor + 2 toppings), $6.99 for regular (1-2 flavors), or $7.99 for \"deluxe\" (1-2 flavors + 2 toppings). There are a few options for free toppings, but most of the worthwhile toppings cost $.50 or $.75. I don't think $6 is out of line at all (you would definitely pay $3 each for a scoop of ice cream and a taiyaki), but it is a pricy option for dessert. I didn't feel like the quality of the ice cream or the taiyaki quite cut it for me.\n\n1/1 Stars for Customer Service --\nThe server offered us samples to help us choose an ice cream flavor. Even though the line behind us got pretty long, the ice cream pretty much came out right after we paid. I don't know if that's the norm or if we just got lucky.\n\nNo bonus star because I probably wouldn't come back. Not a fan.\n\nTL;DR -- Interesting flavors (but subtle), ice cream is more icy than creamy. Come here more for the novelty than anything else.", "author": "Abby W."}

They offer samples of the ice cream in case you want to try it before buying, but was pretty inefficient in the way they organize the responsibilities -- there's literally only one cashier and she's walking back and forth to the ice cream area to grab samples.. Surely there's a more efficient way of providing samples.\n\nAnyways, it also always says the large fish taiyaki cake thing takes 1min to prep and the small takes 5min, but I think it only says that because people hate waiting and wouldn't wait for the small. We didn't mind and ordered the small anyways, and it was out within a minute. However, you can tell its already been out for a while. It was hard and not cakey whatsoever, whereas the large taiyakis are warm and easy to bite. \n\nThis place sucks.

Yep there is a long line for a small shop, but honestly I didn't feel like I was in line for a super long time. If you get bored, talk to your fellow peeps in line and see if they are just as excited to get a taiyaki cone as you are haha.\n\nI ordered a small taiyaki cone with matcha ice cream and it had a pocky stick, chocolate stick and some type of bread stick in it, and yes it was Instagram worthy. \n\nThe taiykai cone is denser than a normal waffle cone, firmer than a pancake but softer than a waffle  and it's not on the sweet side, the matcha ice cream is a nice companion to the cone.

I opted for their regular sized taiyaki with 2 flavors of soft serve since I really wanted to try both their tofu and matcha flavors. The matcha flavor tastes similar to that of green tea ice cream as opposed to the matcha soft serves I've tasted in Japan. The tofu flavor ended up being my favorite of the two and tastes similar to soy milk I would get in Taiwan for breakfast. I like that the tofu flavor is not exceptionally sweet and instead focuses on its unique flavor.\n\nThe one thing that disappointed me was their taiyaki cone which really only resembles taiyaki in appearance. It was stupendously sweet and more closely resembled one of those very sweet hard waffles that come individually packed. I found it hard to taste and to enjoy the soft serve when the taiyaki cone was so overwhelming in sweetness. There is also some red bean in the lower half of the taiyaki cone, but I could barely taste it for the same reason.

The Matcha green tea flavor was definitely pronounced. Their Black Sesame Ice Cream was also really good, I like how it wasn't overly pronounced. The Taiyaki bottom was also really cute, and I appreciated how it didn't get soggy eating it. It was really warm & soft, and the red bean paste at the bottom was a nice touch! 5/5.\n\nMy friend also got a Matcha Green Tea cone sprinkled with Matcha powder and with Pocky sticks- And he really enjoyed it, however we did agree for an additional 50 cents per topping, the matcha powder didn't seem worth it. And also food for thought, Daiso is next door and they also have Pocky, and you could also buy your own pack for 1.50 & put even more on your cone! He said if he came back next time he'd pass on the toppings but he loved his cone, but he also agreed with me on how annoying the service was.\n\nThe also ran out of their tofu and their seasonal flavor (it was Pi\u00f1a Colada when I asked what it was at that time) , which was a little disappointing but their matcha green tea and black sesame ice cream were good.\n\n(mini rant continued)\n\n I had first waited in line for about 10-15 minutes, and the cashier in the front was really sweet & took the orders promptly, so I didn't have issues there. I then waited near the pickup window along with other customers who were also waiting for their orders.\n\nAfter waiting for about another additional 10-15 minutes or so, around 5 customers after me, a group of the pickup window's friends walked to the pickup window after paying for their ice cream.

She then proceeded to do her friends orders first (there were at least 4-5 of them), and then push orders that were there first to the back.\n\nI just felt like it was really inconsiderate to gossip the minute she saw her friends walk through the door, AND ON TOP OF THAT streamline and do  their orders ahead of 6 other people who had ordered & waited fairly much longer than her friends did. \nI also noticed that her male coworker in the back was working solo, so the process of serving food became slower as she was distracted & wasn't being as productive. I ended up waiting an additional 15-20 minutes, waiting for her to finish her friends orders & have them leave before deciding to work on the orders that came before her friends. \n\nBy the time my friend had gotten his cone, I had waited over an additional 20 minutes in the timing it took for the  IMMEDIATE NEXT ORDER after her friends left. By the time I got my cone I was fed up from waiting.\n\nI sadly was really disappointed in the service here today.

Coconut ash didn't really taste like coconut and it was too bland. Tofu tasted like the tofufa (sweet tofu pudding). We ordered a regular sized taiyaki with tofu and black sesame flavor. They put some red bean paste inside at the bottom before swirling black sesame into the taiyaki. Then they cut off some of the black sesame and swirled tofu onto the taiyaki. \n\nI'm not sure how I feel about the layering (there's pros and cons to it).

Upon asking how long the matcha batch would take, the cashier told me it would take about 15-20 minutes because they'd need to make a new full one. I was not about to wait even longer, so I opted for the small taiyaki with black sesame, filled with red bean and topped with matcha powder and pocky sticks. I also got a sample of the tofu soft serve, which tasted like the soymilk you get at Chinese restaurants. \n\nMy order was ready within minutes, though I did note that on their screen, they anticipated a wait time of 10+ minutes for the larger orders. In any case, the pocky sticks that accompanied my soft serve was green tea flavored, which I appreciated. The taiyaki was nice as crisp - also a good touch. I was most disappointed with the black sesame and red bean filling. The black sesame, although creamy in texture, was not flavorful enough for me; it was more of a subtle black sesame flavor. I prefer my black sesame soft serve to taste like black sesame; not a hint of it. The red bean filling was NOT a filling; it was more like half a teaspoon of red bean paste at the bottom of the taiyaki \"cone\". Also, make sure to eat more of the ice cream prior to biting into the \"cone\" or you'll have a liquid soft serve surprise streaming down your hand. In retrospect, I'm glad they ran out of the matcha because I don't think I would've been able to enjoy the soft serve as much, given that my small was already half melted by the time I got to the taiyaki portion.

Although the wait might be long during peak hours, this place is definitely worth it to get your matcha soft-serve fix.\n\nFor $4 something, you get a HUGE proportion of matcha soft serve in a cup, waffle cone (YUM, I say this is the most worth option because you don't pay anymore for the waffle cone and it's huge, crunchy, and delicious), or Taiyaki fish cone (small vs large size). Do take note that if you get the infamous Taiyaki fish cone that you'll wait even longer because it takes around 10 mins. for the employees to actually make your cone since they're made fresh!\n\nThe two most important things for me when it comes to soft serve is of course the taste, but also the melting time. I disliked getting Uji Time at the Berkeley location because the majority of the time I went there, the soft serve melted quickly. However, at this SF Uji Time location, I have to say I was impressed with how well my matcha soft serve held up :) It seems like the proportions at the SF location is more too, as I found myself forcing myself to finish the soft serve to not waste the deliciousness. \n\nVery glad that there's a go-to matcha soft serve spot in SF ! Although parking around in this area is always a pain, there's now a forsure place to get your dessert fix after your yummy meal in this area.\n\nRANDOM TIP: If you're like me and you can't decide on getting matcha or black sesame, definitely just get the swirl. Although the employee/cashier person might deter you away from that option because they say the black sesame overpowers the matcha, I say STICK WITH YOUR GUT because I wish I had. The employee talked me out of getting the black sesame swirled with the matcha and I definitely regretted it after I received my cone. I've had the combination of both flavors in a swirl before and if you try to eat both flavors at the same time, yes the black sesame will overpower the matcha. HOWEVER, if you just dip your spoon into each separate flavor of the swirl, you can definitely enjoy both flavors separately.\n\nTLDR: I like this location better than Berkeley because for whatever reason, the matcha soft serve doesn't melt as quickly and it seems like the proportions are more (or maybe this just depends on the employee).", "author": "Jackie H."}

I've had a few taiyaki ice cream cones in socal, but this is the first time I got to try one in norcal! Unfortunately, I don't make my way to Berkeley too often. \n\nSan Francisco's Uji Time took over the spot in Japantown's mall that used to house the cotton candy milk tea establishment, next to the bridge. It's a tiny, tiny store, and only has room for literally maybe three customers at a  time with no seats at all, so you can imagine that the line was a little ridiculously long. Nevertheless, I was determined to try it out. The line actually moves fairly fast, and they also have a wait time posted on their digital screens iterating how long it would be until the next batch of taiyaki cones would be ready. The cones come in two sizes: mini and regular, and I got the mini! It's definitely still sizable for a \"mini,\" and my stomach was satisfied post-consumption.\n\nWhat I Ordered:\n-Matcha Small Taiyaki (3/5): The ice cream had a moderately strong matcha flavor, and I really enjoyed how they sprinkle matcha powder on the top of the ice cream. The ice cream itself was alright...it wasn't the best matcha ice cream I've had. The cone itself was pretty tasty, and paired well with the red bean at the bottom, as well as the ice cream.  \n\n-Matcha Chocolate Chip Mochi (4/5): Okay, I got this for the 'gram, but this was actually very tasty. Props.\n\nWarning: The cone is VERY messy to eat. I'm usually not a fan of messy foods that are sticky (i.e. I avoid chicken wings like the plague if I can), so this was a full-on panic situation for me. It wasn't a noticeably warm day in SF, but my ice cream started melting within a minute flat. Grab napkins! It dripped all over the place, and by the time I got to the bottom, it was just an unrecognizable mess of ice cream, soggy cone, and red bean. \n\nThe customer service was good! They offer samples of the ice cream if you're unsure of what flavor your want! I sampled the tofu flavor, which I've never, ever had in ice cream form before. It was pretty tasty, but I'm a slave to anything matcha-flavored so I still ordered the matcha. Maybe I'll get the tofu next time!", "author": "Stephanie N."}

The taiyaki was a wilted when it came off the iron (although I was told that the regular sized version is pre-made rather than made to order), and the matcha ice cream was definitely matcha-y but not the same buttery creaminess Japanese soft cream usually is.

I also wish they had the mini taiyakis like they do at the Berkeley location! But I'm sure they'll add them once they get started. \nAlso they have Calpico slushy!!!!!! Whaaaaa? That's the first I've heard of it. The girl was very nice and let me try some and I would definitely get some when it's warmer or the next time I go.

I enjoyed all the flavors as they were strong and true to actual flavors! Since this is a specialty shop, I dare say the matcha flavor is definitely stronger than non-specialty places. As for the fish cone itself, it felt sturdy. Soft crunchy texture on the outside and soft spongy on the inside without being soggy from the soft serve.

Each fish cone also comes with 2 toppings of your choice (pocky sticks, red bean, sprinkles, etc) The only improvements I suggest are adding a flavor swirl option and different flavor fishes! :D\n\nThey also server Calpico flavored slushies and mochi ice cream in various flavors. \n\nSERVICE: \nI was surprise there was no line when we came on a Saturday evening.

They had originally told us 15 min but for some reason it ended up being 30 min.  One couple in front of me ordered two regular-sized taiyaki cones; by the time they gave them the second one, the guy was almost done with his cone. Another couple asked to switch to a mini with a refund; it was taking so long.  Mini cones on the other hand take 5-10 min.  \n\nService didn't help with the wait at all.  The cashier had a bored attitude and had me repeat my order maybe 3 times.  They forgot orders rather frequently; during my 30 min waiting for food time, maybe 6 people came up to inquire about an order they had forgotten.  Even when people asked about the time for their cones, they probably gave some of the most insincere \"sorry\" I've ever seen, for example when they changed the wait time from 15 min to 20 min and then to 30 min.  \n\nI ordered a deluxe cone (regular sized cone with two toppings) with black sesame soft serve, azuki bean and pocky.  While waiting I also ordered a red bean mochi ice cream.  \n\nRed bean mochi- good texture; not too sweet for my taste.  Also wasn't served ice cold but warmed enough to enjoy immediately.\n\nTaiyaki ice cream- the black sesame ice cream thankfully wasn't sweet, though it did have a weird aftertaste (and I usually love black sesame anything).  Adding the azuki was helpful to add sweetness.  Because the cone was still warm, you had to eat the ice cream quickly because it melted quickly.  However, my biggest problem with my taiyaki cone was that one side was UNDERCOOKED.  To think that I waited that long for an underdone cone is incredibly disappointing.  \n\nThings I would have done differently (and who knows if this would have affected my experience):\n- go on a weekday possibly to avoid any long line\n- order a mini taiyaki cone so it won't take so long\n\nI sincerely hope that the staff will work on making the experience better, especially since there were a LOT of disappointed / frustrated customers today.  Until then, even if I'm in Japantown and my friends want to come, I'll be the one dissuading them from going.  :(", "author": "Audrey H."}

Back then, I wouldn't be caught dead in a pair of flats. Even when working retail and standing for 8+ hours, heels were a must even if each talon required bandaging at the end of the night...as long as we looked cute for the AT&T guys that worked in the kiosk out front. *wink wink*\n\nPass forward many sprained ankles later, flats are my BFF. Comfort over style on any day, says this 30ish old grandmama. \n\nI may be over cute shoes but I still can't turn down cutesy looking desserts. \n\nLast year, I started seeing all the Taiyaki fish cone pictures from Uji Time in Berkeley and heard they were opening up a location in San Francisco. That time has come...\n\nUji Time softly opened last week in the old Mitsu Teahouse space in the East building in Japantown near Hotel Kabuki, across from Daiso. Do note that the hours of operation currently listed on yelp does not apply to their soft opening. If you want to try their Taiyaki fish cones, I would try to come about an hour after their listed opening on Yelp. If you come a lot later in the day, they may have stopped making the taiyaki cones for the day. \n\nThey have three soft-serve flavors: matcha, black sesame, and tofu. You can choose a serving in a cup or regular cone ($3.99) or regular taiyaki cone (1-2 flavors - $6.99). You can add toppings for 50 cents each (they only had chocolate sticks and wafers).  They also have mochi ice cream ($2.29 each) in 12 flavors and calpico slushy. Cc's accepted. \n\nI ordered the Regular Taiyaki Cone with half matcha and half black sesame soft serve: http://bit.ly/2r4jfKM. The employee was very nice and kindly gave me free toppings (chocolate stick and French wafers) for waiting.\n\nI know Uji Time is really popular on IG but the cutesy Taiyaki cone is more a millennial Instagrammable novelty than anything else (i.e. they look cute but not functional). I'm happy I got to try it once but I would not go out of my way for it again.\n\n(+) Strong matcha flavor with a pronounced bitterness. \n(+) Black sesame was a lot more subtler with a nice nutty flavor.\n\n(-) I didn't like the icy and gritty texture of the soft serves, particularly the matcha one. Matcha Love is so much better IMO - their soft serves are deliciously creamy. \n(-) If you choose two flavors, they're aren't swirled like what I've seen in pics at their Berkeley location. You have to quickly eat one flavor before getting to the other. \n(-) The taiyaki cone is NOT functional. The soft serve quickly melted along the sides of the cone so it was really messy to eat. The soft serve that was in the cone had melted before I could even get halfway through the top of the soft serve. When I took a bite of the cone from the side, all the melted soft serve from inside the cone squirted out and splattered all over my lap. I ended up tossing it. \n\nI thought maybe it was soft opening kinks or that I was crazy not to like it. I asked several friends who've been to Uji Time in Berkeley and they all said, they were not impressed with their Taiyaki cone or soft serve. \n\nSorry, Uji Time is just not my cup of matcha.

Furthermore the red bean paste is very minimal and I only had a bite of it before it was gone.

Ever since seeing all the photogenic desserts from their original location in Berkeley, I've been wanting to check it out but couldn't quite bring myself to drive across the bridge just for ice cream in a fish-shaped cone :X (plus, they open starting in the afternoons = horrendous Bay Bridge traffic)\n\nThe SF location is across from Daiso in the Japantown Plaza. It opened in early May 2017, and not all the menu items are available during their soft opening phase (soft serve during soft opening... oh the puns that amuse me.) However they are very friendly and helpful; when I emailed them to confirm the hours, they promptly replied and even advised me to arrive ~3:45pm when the taiyaki cones would be ready.\n\nWe got the regular taikayi cone ($7, tax not included) with matcha and sesame soft serve. I think it's quite reasonably priced given all the work that goes into it, typical SF prices, and the sheer deliciousness P:\n\nThe taikayi cone was outstanding, arguably as good as the taiyaki made in the food stalls around Japantown. It had the perfect balance of mochi-like softness and light crisp, and tasted like a delicious cross between waffles and dorayaki pancakes. It was slightly warm, which was amazing but melted the bottom of the soft serve. There is also a layer of red bean paste at the bottom, so towards the end it turns into a traditional taiyaki pastry P:\n\nI must say, I think the matcha soft serve is the best I've had outside of Asia--the matcha flavor is strong as evidenced by the dark green hue, and the texture is a bit coarse from undissolved matcha. The mild sweetness and attenuated creaminess is just right. (It almost seems more appropriate to call this soft serve flavored matcha rather than matcha flavored soft serve!) \n\nThe sesame was tasty too, though not as memorable as the matcha. It's on the sweeter side, and the sesame flavor is less concentrated. (My favorite sesame ice cream place in SF is Marco Polo on Taraval.)\n\nOverall, my visit to Uji Time exceeded my expectations. They also serve ice cream mochi with interesting flavors, which look good too but a bit pricey. My suggestions would be to have more pretty backgrounds around the store (essential for Instagrams) and to perhaps tweak the presentation a bit so that both flavors show (also important for Instagrams).\n\nCan't wait to come back when they have their full menu.

The combination of the cone and the soft serve is perfect! \n\nOther notes:\nIf you are not a fan of matcha, there's other flavors to choose from. Black sesame is another popular one, and the best thing is you can choose two flavors at the same time.

I also thought about the taiyaki cone; it still has sweetened red beans inside.\n\nI might go back to Uji Time another day for one mochi if I feel like it.  That's why I never need a card that allows me to go on the eleventh time for any free dessert.

San Francisco is getting more and more dessert places and I'm just happy to include Uji Time. This place has been on my bookmarks since forever but I couldn't find the time to go to Berkeley so when I saw this, I had to pay my respects. The store itself is very simple, located diagonally from Daiso. It was a cold day but it doesn't stop me from having this. Since they just opened, they told me they didn't have the fish cones yet, but they have most of their items. I got the matcha/black sesame soft serve split into a cup. I already knew I was going to like it due to the anticipation I've been building. \n\nPricing/Flavors:\nOne flavor in a cone/cup is $3.99 but you get a lot for what you pay for. Mochis are $6.39 for 3pcs with many flavors or you can buy them single as well. They have three different flavors: matcha, black sesame, and tofu. \nI had to try both flavors since they didn't have tofu so what better way than to split it. I was scared the black sesame taste would be too strong but instead, it was very light. It sort of tastes like vanilla soft serve with slight hints of black sesame. The matcha ofc tastes like actual matcha powder combined into a soft serve. Nothing fake or artificial about these two. \n\nCustomer Service:\nThe cashier was friendly and told me right away what they had/didn't have. She came out with the soft serve really quick too. \n\nRecommend?\nHeck ya! I'd come back every week bc this can get so addicting. Soft serve is more preferable when you want some light yet sweet. Amazing soft serve and service!! Come next week when they start having their fish cones.", "author": "Lisa W."}

Came here late afternoon to a quiet minimal line. Checked out their menu which had a \"seasonal\" flavour and a mini taiyaki that comes with two toppings of your choice. The cashier said these options are only this store.\n\nWhen I went forth to ask about the seasonal flavour she tells me they don't have it. They only had Matcha or sesame which was disappointing. I came hoping for tofu because you can't get tofu flavour at too many places. Then I went about asking about the choice of toppings for the mini taiyaki. She then goes we don't have ......toppings today. Okay...there's a lot that's not available...what's going on?\n\nWith minimal options left, I chose the regular taiyaki with the only two flavours they had(matcha and sesame).\n\nIt took less than 2minutes for me to get my taiyaki...which I questioned(how long has the taiyaki been made and sitting given the low foot traffic?) you see the taiyaki being made at Berkeley uji and usually there's a wait time just for that and how fresh it is.\n\nThe matcha tasted the same. The sesame is not as good as the Berkeley uji. The sesame was for some reason more thick/milky? \n\nNow for the taiyaki, it definitely was not warm and tasted like it had been sitting; very soft and mushy(broke very easily). Not to mention the bottom half of my fish had a crack. :( \n\nMight give it another chance if there's seasonal flavour. Otherwise, I'd much rather drive to Berkeley .", "author": "Carmen L."}

Luckily, my friend and I visited this Uji location on a Monday during lunch, so it wasn't as busy at all. I've also been to the Uji in Berkeley, so if you're wondering, I think they're both great!\n\nBecause we had just eaten ramen, we weren't as hungry enough to have one of their delicious taiyaki cones, so we opted to each have a waffle cone of soft-serve matcha and their limited (10 times a day) melon (made of canteloupe). The cones were the perfect size to finish off our lunch for dessert. \n\nTheir melon actually tasted really good, and I'm not one to eat a canteloupe (ask my friends! I'm not a huge melon fan). It had a little bit of sweetness to it that made it more delicious than melon usually is (to me anyways). It's definitely something I wouldn't mind getting again! \n\nAs for the matcha, it tasted like matcha and not green tea, which was PERFECT. There are places that say they carry matcha-flavored items, but they straight up taste like green tea...there's a HUGE difference between the two! Their waffle cone tasted just like any other waffle cone, but the thing I liked about this place, is that they serve it to you, wrapped in a small, black napkin. This is nice because it can get messy quick.\n\nI haven't had this location's black sesame yet, but I'm sure it's just as good as its Berkeley location, so I would also recommend that too!

The taiyaki (cute bread-y fish used as a cone) is made fresh so the wait is worth it. Just don't wait too long to actually eat the soft serve once you get it - the warmth of the taiyaki tends to speed up the melting process of the soft serve. \n\nI got the taiyaki with black sesame soft serve. The staff inside are super friendly and patient - they offered me samples of the tofu, black sesame, and the matcha soft serve since it was my first time. Tofu tastes more like soy milk. Matcha is what you'd expect - not overly sweet. But the black sesame won my heart - not overly sweet either and did not skimp on the black sesame flavor. Delicious!!! Creamy goodness + hot taiyaki with a little red bean inside. \n\nI have slight obsession with Genki and their ice cream crepes, but I think I may have found another contender for my sweet tooth fixes.", "author": "Erica H."}

Not sure how busy they get, but the Taiyaki cone (fish-shaped cone) had a wait time. When I ordered, it initially said 25 mins wait. I didn't mind because I wanted to stop by the Daiso next door (one of my weaknesses) I came back about 10 mins later to check up on my order & apparently it was called out already. So definitely just wait next to the pick-up line to get your order because the estimated wait time is not accurate (at least for me) \n\nI got the matcha taiyaki cone.

The place is tiny but thankfully you can eat your dessert in the mall/outside plaza. The service was friendly and pleasant. Be warned the soft serve here isn't your typical sweet flavors. They have tofu, black sesame, matcha, and a season flavor that rotates. As of nov 1 the seasonal was a pumpkin miso. The soft serve isn't sweet but surprisingly interesting. I sampled the tofu, black sesame, and matcha and well it tastes like I expected. All the flavors were exactly as described, not really sweet but with the described flavor peaking at the end of each taste. I ended up going with the matcha which was my favorite of the bunch. For matcha soft serve it was one of the better ones I've tried. They have a handful of toppings, I choose the choco sticks and matcha pocky. You have the option on the cones from a normal waffle cone or a taiyaki cone (pretty much a waffle/cake-like cone in the shape of a fish). No surprises here I went with the taiyaki. Overall the dessert was ok. The taiyaki was a different twist on the typical boring cone and the soft serve was ok, but it isn't a place I'll go out of my way for. It's cute and worth a try if you want to try the taiyaki or you like matcha. \nThey also sell ice cream filled mochi in several flavors which looked nice, I'll be sure to come back to check it out.", "author": "Peter P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-05-26", "description": "I came here one evening after dinner with a friend and we decided to get taiyaki since I heard that tofu soft cream was served here. I never had tofu soft cream so I was pretty excited about this. Haven't had taiyaki in roughly two years so I was psyched up for that as well. Anyways, when we got there, there was a short line and it was roughly a five-minute wait. When we got to the front, I made up my mind about what to get and was disappointed that they did not have dango, which was quite unfortunate for me. I ended up getting a taiyaki cone with red bean filling and tofu soft cream, topped with kinako (soy bean powder) and a French crepe on the side. \n\nAfter five minutes, my order was ready and we quickly got out of the store since it was pretty hot inside and it was melting the soft cream. I started off with the tofu soft cream and I can best describe it as similar to a vanilla with a strong soy taste. This was compounded by the fact that I got kinako, since it only intensifies the soy taste. One thing to note was that the tofu soft cream started melting pretty fast, and the taiyaki's mouth couldn't really hold all of the soft cream so it started dripping roughly after five minutes, although this pretty much happens with most ice cream cones. I didn't think much of the French crepe although I really did enjoy the kinako. I was thinking I maybe should have gone with the honey instead of the French crepe, but that's my opinion. The red bean was all the way at the bottom, and it was pretty sweet and complimented the tofu soft cream. Overall, it was pretty good, although I wish I could have savored it longer since I had to eat the soft cream portion quickly. \n\nIn San Francisco, there are aren't that many places that serve taiyaki, so I'll take what I can get. This place does it pretty good, and I was pretty pleased with the tofu flavor. I noticed that they were out of hojicha (green tea) soft cream and I think if I were to come back here, it would be for that. I think for Japantown dessert places, this place is solidly among the best, and I believe one can't go wrong choosing this place.", "author": "Nelson X."}

Most people seem to get the matcha.   I wouldn't say that it's the best soft serve we've ever tried, its novelty seems to be the fish shaped cone cuteness that's freaking people out...add some pocky to it and flash your IG peace sign and you get the idea-lol.\n\nIf you're in the area and need a cool treat- this may be your jam!\n\nTIP:\n- Don't squeeze your fish cone, they're warm, soft and flexible -your whole deal will fall right on the floor!  (We saw it happen and the girl went back and asked for another and they gave her a hard time...but eventually relented. Yeah, your clumsiness may leave you sans ice cream. )\n\nAll of the waffle makers in that small space make it warm in there, and the space is small.

The average wait time at the Berk location is 10 minutes. \n\nOk, on to their offerings. Their permanent flavors are black sesame, matcha, and tofu. Their current seasonal flavor is corn (July 2017). Here's my breakdown of the soft serve:\n-black sesame: my favorite, tastes exactly like black sesame. If you're a fan of black sesame paste, you'll probably love this. I always recommend this flavor to my friends. \n-matcha: love this flavor too, bold matcha taste and not as sweet as the black sesame. I would recommend black sesame and matcha if you can get two flavors. \n-tofu: I love actual tofu, but I personally think this is gross. My friends think I'm crazy b/c they like it. Eh, to each their own\n-corn(July 2017): seasonal flavor, lol tastes like sweet butter \n-taiyaki cone: get it if you've never been, def worth that Yelp pic! It tastes like a waffle pancake hybrid, and has the texture of a dense pancake batter. The bottom of the cone has red bean, probably to prevent your soft serve from leaking through. \n\nThe one thing that beats this location is that they have 3 different sizes of taiyaki cones. \nSmall: perfect for one person (only 1 flavor, 2 free toppings) \nMedium: great size for sharing w/ one other person (2 flavors, no free toppings)\nLarge: omg you must really love soft serve and saved a lot of room for dessert", "author": "Sophia L."}

The fish itself was not a very good ice cream holder, when you bite it, it would break and the ice cream would come out and just get messy. I would prefer it in just a regular cone.

Initially, I was scared because there was a line out the door! However, the line moves relatively quickly and I was in and out in about 15 minutes.\n\nI would recommend the small taiyaki. They fill your cone with lots of soft-serve, so you'll still leave happy and stuffed. I got the black sesame soft serve with a French crepe and red bean paste as my toppings. The servers are super friendly and nice. I accidentally used the wrong credit card and it was no problem to cancel it and refund me!\n\nNot only was the ice cream delicious, but so was the toppings and fish cone! The only sad thing is you get the cone in a paper sheath (to protect from ice cream drips), which makes seeing the fish very difficult.\n\nOverall, definitely an experience I'd recommend.

You can also order the ice cream in a cone if you're not a fan of taiyaki. On the menu, it says it'll be a +5min wait.

The taiyaki cones are super cute and insta-worthy but take an additional 5 minutes to get your order as a result (and can probably take longer from back up of people who ordered before you). I really fell in love with their matcha soft serve though the first couple times coming here, and the portions for just soft serve are huge! Definitely enough for 2 people to share or one... super hungry person. heh. The last time I came here, I found that the matcha soft serve was slightly icier and grainier than I remembered- you could see little specks of unmixed matcha, which is the same reason why I'm not as into their black sesame soft serve.

Both were delicious.  \n1. The tofu tastes more like Asian soy milk drinks or those sweet dessert tofu that's really soft that I don't know the name of.  My mom made a good point which was that \"soy milk\" would have been a better name but tofu gets people interested.  \n2. The green tea is so packed with tea that it's slightly bitter. I love this.  I really dislike green tea ice creams that just have a hint of green tea.  I like for it to really punch me in the face with flavor.  \n3. The tayaki was delicious.  Full of flavor and had some red bean paste at the bottom.  \n\nI think the regular is worth it for having two flavors of ice cream and tayaki.  The odd thing is that it doesn't come with 2 toppings like the small and large do.  I tried the black sesame and didn't like it but mostly because I don't like that flavor in general.  You'd have to read other people's reviews on black sesame. The small size isn't worth it when you get so much more tayaki for 1 more dollar.  \n\nTL/DR:  it's good!

It reminded me of Chinese tofu pudding aka \"tau-foo-fah\". It flavor was light but it had the perfect amount of sweetness at the end of each taste. Decided to get both flavors and went for the Regular taiyaki size which consisted of two flavors (additional toppings is extra cost) and pocky. The order came out in less than 3 mins from ordering.

So PSA everyone **Uji Time is located in the same building as Daiso on the first floor.** This shop is small so after you order, you're pretty much given two choices: to either walk/shop around the plaza or to sit on the benches right outside the shop. \nWe shared a regular taiyaki with matcha and black sesame soft serve ($6.99 -- $7.58 total). Overall the flavors were good but I was hoping for more of a creamy texture. When I first tasted the matcha here, my brain quickly compared it to Matcha Love but noticed that it was less creamy. The lady served the two flavors separately too, so matcha was on top and black sesame was on the bottom. I had to dig under the matcha to taste the black sesame while the matcha was slowly melting down... \nAs for the taiyaki, it was meh. The taiyaki was soft on the inside and had a brittle, almost crunchy texture on the outside. It's not sweet and tasted like a pancake to me. The soft serve oozed on the sides of the taiyaki as I shared this with my friend. I was surprised to find the red bean inside though! \nI'm not sure if I'll come back. Maybe to try the other flavors. Their seasonal flavor rn is pumpkin miso btw! I wouldn't come back for the matcha but considering how far Matcha Love is (in SJ) and if I'm willing to make that hr drive...

I have had plenty of bad matcha or sesame ice cream cones in Kyoto and Tokyo, but Uji outdid then all. It is nice to know the next time I am in need of a sugar fix I can head to my local Japantown and save myself 17 hours of flight time.\n\nUji, you are now my third favorite ice cream place in SF!", "author": "James T."}

I was determined to find a place in SF but had no luck until this place popped up on yelp! I have a sweet tooth and was determined right there and then I had to get that UJI dessert! \n\nThis place is new. We went there on a Monday afternoon so there was no line. We were helped right away. I got the deluxe dessert in a fish cone. It comes with red bean on the very bottom, plus two flavors of ice cream (I got the matcha and sesame flavor), comes with two chocolate bar and pocket sticks. The fish cone was fresh out of the oven when I got my dessert and I devoured it. I know I will be returning for more! Oh and they also have Mochi ice cream here in a variety of flavors!\n\nThis place is in the same shopping center as Daiso. Small place with no tables but they do have benches right in front of the store.  \n \nMinus one star for not having many toppings available at the time", "author": "C O."}

We weren't actually looking for dessert but we couldn't resist to try it once we saw the line and interesting menu. We came on a late Monday night so the line was not bad at all. I was surprised to see people even lined up at this hour so I understood right the way that this is one of \"secret\" ice cream places. After checking out their menu, I had to get one. They offer very interesting, or say traditional, soft serve flavors. The regular flavors are matcha, black sesame, and tofu. They also offer seasonal special flavors. Even their \"regular\" flavors are very interesting. Instead of regular waffle cone, you can select more interesting taiyaki cone, which is Japanese traditional fish-shaped cake. I ordered the small taiyaki cone with black sesame soft serve and chocolate stick and pocky stick. Quite a presentation when it was served! I loved the creativity right the way. The black sesame flavor soft serve was amazing. Not too strong of black sesame. Not too sweet. The consistency is just right so the soft serve doesn't fall off the cone too quickly. The taiyaki cone itself was also very good. It's made right in the store and cooled slightly before putting the ice cream in. After we almost finished the cone, I discovered tiny bit of red bean toward the end of the fish!!! What a surprise! It's just so cute and so creative.  I definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes interesting flavored soft serve!", "author": "Wanting H."}

I asked the cashier if this was an accurate estimate and she said she didn't think they were making them today, which was untrue because everyone was walking away with one. So I was very confused at her comment.\n\nSecondly, the menu says if you get a regular or a deluxe you can have 1-2 flavors. I ordered a regular in a cone and asked for 2 flavors. The cashier said they don't do 2 flavors so again I was very confused by her comment.\n\nI ended up getting black sesame in a cone and was underwhelmed.\n\nLastly, the soft serve wasn't all that great. I was expecting super creamy soft serve like they have in Japan, and the soft serve was actually kind of icy. \n\nI don't think I'll be back.", "author": "Jessica B."}

The flavors include: matcha, tofu, black sesame, and their seasonal, sweet potato.

They open at 1PM officially - the hours sign on their door says 1PM. I got there a bit before 12:30PM and had to wait around for them to open (although they opened at 12:45PM). I got the taiyaki cone with matcha ice cream, red bean paste, and (Matcha) Pocky. The ice cream was pretty smooth and flavorful, but I've had better (in NYC). The ice cream became drippy towards the end, and it was really difficult to eat the red bean with the ice cream the way they put it on. The Pocky was a nice addition though. The taiyaki stayed crunchy even though there was ice cream in it, so I definitely appreciated that. There was also a ball of red bean at the tail of the taiyaki which was a pleasant surprise. $6.50 for a dessert of this size is way too expensive, though I understand that they can charge that because of the novelty and so on. Not a bad place, although there's not really space inside the store to sit or hang out; there are benches outside though. And there's wifi if you need it!", "author": "Andrea W."}

I've been wanting to try it again since then because I remember their tofu soft serve being good and one of the only places around I could get it. I got a regular sized taiyaki with tofu soft serve - but you can also order a second flavor for a regular size if you want to. Note that getting two flavors means that one flavor is inside the taiyaki and the second flavor is swirled on top NOT having two flavors swirled together. My friends thought the flavors would be swirled together - it's not how it is, but they didn't mind too much. \n\nThey're still in soft opening and the line was out the door on a Tuesday about an hour after they opened. The wait wasn't too bad and they work pretty quickly. \n\nThe cost for one regular taiyaki cone was almost 8 dollars which seems pricey but for the size you will see it's a reasonable cost.

I was so excited to find one I thought was as good as Japan but alas the search continues. We try all 4 flavors. Let's start with their tofu which taste like soyful dessert drink in San Jose so it's ok. The matcha was just ok like any matcha ice cream you can get almost anywhere. I knew it wasn't the same as Japan once they gave me the ice cream. Japan has a more darker green color with a strong delicious heavenly matcha flavor to die for. The sesame flavor base of my taste bud I like better than the matcha and tofu. Now for the seasonal flavor which is miso pumpkin ......... OMG.... it was....... it was... not good at all! A very strange taste which I would never recommend. That recipe needs to be buried and RIP. Seriously ! Last the fish which is a no no. It was very hard and doughy. The waffle cone is way better. Just say this place did not wow us 4 even the two that haven't been to Japan didn't enjoy it. In the end it's a 3 star. I know my review is a bit dramatic as long as u don't get that miso pumpkin flavor and the fish cone than overall it's not too bad.  Would I recommend it? Sure. But only get the regular waffle cone , never get the miso pumpkin and good to share to try for the first time. Would I come back? Probably not unless I'm with people who wants to try for their first time to test their own taste bud. Remember, everyone's taste is different. Again 3 star.", "author": "Christy V."}

I bring it up to the lady at the register and asked if if was the sesame. She turns behind her and asks, then turns to me and relays the message from the man making the cones, saying they don't have the black sesame. That's totally fine, but why would you take my order for black sesame & knowing that you don't have it, then serve me a pineapple before asking if that's okay with me? She stood completely frozen waiting for my response. I shook it off and just took the pineapple cone.

Uji time seems to be the most known chain for taiyaki so of course that was my go-to place. We ran down the street after dinner to catch dessert and barely made it 15 minutes before closing time. Oh gosh this place was poppin! The line was pretty long especially in the last 15 minutes and only got longer to the point where an employee had to cut It off. Luckily, I was able to get to try one! The service was a bit slow. I think the employees were trying to clean and work at the same time so that caused a bit of a delay on orders. Anyways, I opted to get no toppings to try the matcha and black sesame rather than the one topping, one flavor option. You can always get some sprinkles or some pocky anywhere but how often do you see black sesame and matcha as soft serve flavors? I'd definitely recommend choosing the two flavors if it's your first time. Ahh love at first bite. There's that sweet spot in any kind of matcha dessert and they hit It pretty well. It wasn't too sweet and It wasn't too bland. BUT the Star was definitely the black sesame. I was super hesitant in trying this. Black sesame does not sound appealing to me whatsoever, but I gave into peer pressure and got It haha. I can truly say that black sesame is one of my favorite ice cream flavors now. Where has It been all my life! The flavors mixed together pretty well and with that freshly baked cone? Even better!! I had a hard time finishing It but got far enough to try the red bean paste. I'm not too big of a fan on the paste but I think it's just my personal preference. I'd opt for a cone instead next time for some yummy soft serve. \n\nMy friend let me try his fruity basil mochi. It happened to be a secret flavor so I'd ask the employees working about additional flavors they may have aside from the list because that flavor was amazing!!", "author": "Yvonne P."}

Thank goodness for the girl that came by and brought samples of their 4 flavors. The matcha was the only flavor that was somewhat okay. The tofu flavor... why?! Just why would you ever make a dessert taste like tofu?! As soon as I realized I didn't eat any of those flavors, my fianc\u00e9 made me continue to wait another few minutes so we can at least try the cone. Unfortunately, they don't tell you until you look at the screen, which is inside and nowhere in sight when you're waiting in line, that there's a 15 minute additional wait for the stupid fish cone! I'm literally tolling my eyes and I continue to type. Anyways... how was he cone, you ask? It tasted like any other waffle cone but wasn't even cooked the whole way.

I enjoyed it because it's pretty hard to mess up green tea ice cream but I would rather go to Sophie's Crepes in the other plaza across the mall :) they have bomb ice cream and crepes.", "author": "Sophia L."}

Anyone who comes here and doesn't get one is missing out!\n\nThe taiyaki come are filled with one of three regular soft-serve ice cream flavors (matcha, black sesame, and tofu), or a seasonal flavor. My go-to is the black sesame: it's perfectly sweet (not saccharine) and creamy with a potent, nutty sesame flavor. But both other flavors are good if those are more your jam. Seasonal flavors haven't been my thing, although I'm waiting for the day they have taro as a seasonal flavor. \n\nFrom there, you can choose from a number of toppings: I myself like the sprinkles and chocolate sticks, which are flakey cylindrical cookies with a chocolate filling inside. I use them as a spoon to scoop up the black sesame ice cream, with the sprinkles as a nice unexpected crunch. Once you eat the bulk of the ice cream, you get to eat the ice cream-soaked cone and then the red bean filling at the bottom, which is arguably the best part.\n\nThe place is small, hot, and cramped, but clean with warm lighting and well lit video menus. There's nowhere to eat your cone on the inside, but the mall has a nice bench right outside with a mini Japanese zen garden behind it and plenty of their seating options throughout.\n\nYou almost always have to wait a long time, but it's worth it. Although, hot tip: if you live near the one in Berkeley, it's well worth visiting that one instead due to the shorter line. \n\nHighly recommend to out of town visitors and locals alike -- it's delicious, charming, and chances are you won't be able to get anything like it outside of Asia itself.", "author": "Emily M."}

The small taiyaki cone ($5.99) comes with 1 flavor (matcha, black sesame, tofu, and their seasonal flavor) and 2 toppings of your choice (french crepe, azuki, kink, matcha powder, pocky stick, poppy seeds, sprinkles, and a wafer stick).

I would say that it's better than the lavender flavor, which my friend got, because the lavender wasn't very strong at all. Overall, the flavor would be 3 stars.\n\nAgain, I want to be understanding and all but that 30 minute wait made me miss my train and late for work so it was just an unfortunate series of events. \n\nI'd stop by if there wasn't a line, but it isn't worth the wait.\n\nAlso, maybe their AC wasn't working because it was quite warm inside which doesn't make too much sense since it's specialty is ice cream.", "author": "Mary Z."}

I had very high expectations for this place when I saw the \"coming soon\" sign poster posted that they were going to open in Japantown . I know that they are still currently in there soft opening stage but please as customers are browsing the menu , the cashier should let them know ahead of time what they do / do not have in stock . Don't tell them after the customer asks them about it . \n\nYou need some serious ventilation installation in your shop . It is soooo stuffy inside . Even the poor cashier standing in the front taking customers orders had a mini fan infront of them cause it was so stuffy inside .. I understand you need to make taiyaki that's why its so hot . But I had to wait for 3 different flavored icecream coned taiyaki . My friend passed them to me one by one & I was carrying them outside to wait because I was afraid if we waited for all 3 of them in the shop , the soft served icecream would've melted by then .\n\nMochi Icecream \nYou have 12 different flavors listed, but only 3 of the 12 flavors were available !?! Like I said in the beginning , you should let customers know ahead of time what is / isn't available before customers start listing what they want to order . Wanted the green tea flavor , sorry not available . Wanted the sesame flavored , sorry not in stock . Wanted the red bean flavor , sorry we don't have . Can you just tell me what you have available right now ?? The cashier told us what they had but we couldn't really hear what they were saying . We just told them to give us one each of whatever flavored they had . Don't know what flavors we got but we received 3 frozen mochi icecream (had to wait a bit for them to defrost) they didn't taste anything special or something I would want to try again .\n\nAm I not mistaken that Uji Time is known for their taiyaki soft serve ice cream cones . Shouldn't you make the taiyaki cones on the spot when the  customer orders it . We ordered 3 taiyaki soft serve icecream cones and dearG who knows how long it was made and just sitting there . Each cone is suppose to take about 15mins to make according to the menu that they show . All 3 cones came out in less than 10 minutes wait time . When I held the cone it wasn't even warm & it even became deformed looking as I was holding it . \n\nTaiyaki soft serve flavors : \nTofu : tasted like Asian Vitasoy soymilk flavor \nSesame : very light sesame taste (creamy / milky)\nMatcha : very very strong matcha flavor . Being a crazy matcha addict , I love matcha . But I wanted to eat it as matcha soft serve ice cream and I expect it to be a tad bit sweet . But every bite I took it would just get bitter and bitter with the grainy matcha powder . It felt like I was just eating soft served matcha powder instead of soft serve matcha icecream . \n\nTopping Add On :\nWas making sure that the dango listed under the topping add on was similar to mochi . Asked about it and wanted to add it on . Then the cashier informed to us they didn't have it . At this point I was just annoyed that we were informed after we inquired about wanting to add it on . We just added pocky to our taiyaki . They gave us about 5-6 sticks of pocky . Made our fish look like a porcupine ..\n\nDon't think I would come back to this location but hopefully in the future if I ever need to do something in the east bay , I'll go try out their Berkeley location .", "author": "Annie L."}

The lines there are always confusing, sometimes mixed with their neighbor ice shave, because of lack of proper space for a short line. The waiter/waitress sometimes keep chatting among themselves while you keep waiting....which I really hate...and sometimes, there were just no one at the counter for some minutes.

When I got to the area where Mitsu Tea House had been, it finally clicked what the long line was for. It was still their soft opening and though the line was a tiny bit long, the wait wasn't actually all that bad. My friend and I was actually glad the line was long, because we had a bit of time to kill. \nAt first we were both a little bit unsure of what to get and was leaning toward getting the black sesame soft serve, until we noticed there was a \"seasonal flavor\" being displayed. Due to curiosity, we asked the cashier and was told it was \"Honey Lavender\". Tempted by the name, we immediately decided to get the seasonal flavor and the cashier was very nice to offer us a sample taste before we decided on the actual order and it was simply delicious. \nWe ordered the soft serve plain with nothing else besides the waffle cone (the taiyaki were with much longer waiting time, 25+ minutes for the large and 5+ minutes for the small) and it was really a good choice. Both the flavor of the lavender and honey blended very well together and was totally not overwhelming at all. The soft serve was delicious and just melt in your mouth leaving behind a very pleasant after-taste. The waffle cone was a bit plain but the sweetness of the soft serve and crunchy texture definitely made up for it. \nOverall, this was a very nice experience. The wait was a bit long due their opening but the time waiting for our soft serve was less than 10 minutes and we couldn't be happier. And we totally appreciated the very nice staff who offered to let us try out the flavor before actually ordering, it was a very nice gestures!

I asked the staff member if opening time was actually 12:30 or if it was a mistake on the sign. She just looked at me like she was annoyed AT ME, the customer, and said that they weren't ready.  I actually understand if you aren't quite ready but I just needed an estimate - 5 minutes I can do, but another 30 minutes is very different.  As a paying customer I had every right to ask \"what time do you open?\"\n\nWell about 2 minutes after I asked her, she opened the doors and there was already a line of at least 10 people behind me.  I was the first customer - i gave her my order but guess what...they didnt have the Taiyaki (fish) cones and If I wanted it I would have to wait another 30 minutes.  Ridiculous.  No apologies or anything, btw, for them not having the cone we came here for, for their FIRST customer.  It wasnt like they ran out and needed to make more!

And yes, the ice cream is decent and the cone is instagrammable.

I had no idea that this place had other locations that were popular. At the time of my visit, the location was still running a soft opening. Uji Time offers a variety of taiyaki sizes with varying flavors of soft serve, tons of flavors of mochi ice cream, and they even had calpico slushies. \n\nFood - 3/5\nI got the larger taiyaki with tofu and matcha flavor (protip: you can choose more than one flavor). For those of you that don't know, taiyaki is essentially a fish shaped cake (similar to a firm pancake). This particular taiyaki was filled with ice cream and red bean paste. The ice cream filling flavors were interesting (matcha green tea, tofu, black sesame, and honey lavendar). I would definitely recommend the matcha flavor. Honestly, I think I would get the small one next time. If the ice cream sits too long, the yummy freshly made cake gets cold.\n\n*Be careful with your licks and scoops of ice cream. We saw someone drop theirs on the floor and it doesn't get much more disappointing than \"floor ice cream\".\n\nService - 2/5\nAgain, this was a soft opening and this is the first SF location so naturally the line was out the door and down the hall. It was about a 30 minute wait to try this delicious treat. I think the major problem was that people didn't know what flavor they wanted, causing long order times.\n\nAmbience - 4/5\nThere is not seating inside, but it is located in the mall with seating right out side.

I've concluded that they do take great pride is the aesthetics of their presentation, which I appreciate.\n\nThe taiyaki fish cone was great, especially the mix of red bean and black sesame which was oddly delicious. The only issue is that since the ice cream melts, once you bite into the fish, the ice cream begins to drip down your clothes and hands.

We waited around 20 minutes and decided to get the small matcha takiyaki, small black sesame takiyaki and three mochis for a total of $20 (a little less to be accurate). The matcha and black sesame was good. The black sesame tasted a little more chocolatey to me than sesame - but I liked them both equally. We got the chance to sample their tofu flavor and it tasted like soybean more than tofu, but suggest matcha or black sesame over it. The takiyaki had red bean at the bottom when you reach the end which was a pleasant surprise. It was filling because it is much thicker than a cone, but satisfying on a hot summer day. We also had the lychee colada, matcha with chocolate, and black sesame mochi to take home - to my disappointment, the lychee colada didn't taste like lychee and the matcha chocolate chip didn't have ANY chocolate chips :( thus the lower ratings. They have the secret Mochi flavors at the cashier on the desk if you're interested but nothing stuck out to me so I went with the usual.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-05-20", "description": "This place is only good for photo ops. The reason there's a long line is because everyone is ordering the fish cones but they need to let all the freshly made ones cool down before they put the soft serve ice cream in there. And when they don't logistically plan for the amount of people coming this creates a huge delay. I understand that this is still a soft opening but please sort this out soon. \n\nThe communication behind the counter is horrible. We were patiently waiting for our number to be called. And when I was expecting our number to be called based on ascending order, they didn't call it. They continued past it, serving other customers the same orders I bought. They gave everyone a heads up about a 30 min delay to make the cones and I know they're busy/stressed in the back so I didn't want to complain too much about the wait. After waiting some more, I kindly asked what the status was and they said they called it already. Ok, then why didn't you call it again during the 30-40 min I was waiting inside which by the way is super hot in there (there's no ventilation in there, with no fans except for a personal one that the cashier has faced towards her). If someone doesn't pick up their order, they should continue to call the number for that person to come.  Not just once and call it a day.

After contemplating a bit more on my order, she slightly turns around and begins to mingle with two guys along the side conversing instead of helping or suggesting items to me.

Normally, we don't go out of our way to try the latest dessert hype, but since we were in the area, we thought - why not! The line was long, but we figured it would go fast since its soft serve ice cream. It's already pre-made, how long would it take, right?! Well, 40+ mins later we were finally able to order our desserts.  \n\nThe good thing is they offer free samples, before placing your order.  Just note that when you ask the cashier for the sample, he/she has to go to the back of the store where the soft serve machines are located and then walk back to the front to give you the samples. Not very efficient, in my opinion, and I think this is the reason it takes so long to order.  Once you order though, the desserts are ready within seconds. \n\nFlavor selection is limited - only 4 flavors available: matcha, black sesame, tofu, and their seasonal flavor (sweet corn). We got samples of tofu and sweet corn - tofu was kind of weird only because it literally taste like tofu. Sweet corn was ok.  We opted for the matcha and black sesame in the regular size taiyaki cone . Out of the two, the black sesame was our favorite.  The matcha was a bit on the bitter side but was still good.  What wasn't good was the under cooked taiyaki cone - the middle was still doughy. A bit disappointing since that was the reason we decide to get the dessert in the first place.  We didn't try the mochi ice creams so can't comment on those. \n\nI would probably give them another try if I was in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.", "author": "Jenny L."}

Other flavors included the tofu and the seasonal one. When I went the seasonal flavor was lavender and it tasted pretty good, very flowery. There were samples of each soft serve flavor being passed out and I was able to try most of them before ordering. The line was pretty long around 5pm but it was definitely worth it.

They have a range of amazing Asian flavors of ice cream like tofu, sesame and matcha. My personal favorite is sesame. My biggest issue is the wait to receive your dessert. It was slightly crowded, so I understand. Forgetting my order multiple times was my problem. I had to constantly check for my order and remind the staff of what I ordered. My friends had received their desserts 15-20 mins before me, I ended up holding our group back. I really wish they were more efficient when making the desserts and they stop forgetting customer's orders.", "author": "Natalie N."}

If you paid over $8 for a taiyaki cone and 2 flavors of soft serve plus toppings, you have been taken. The matcha soft serve is not sweet, does not have the mild green tea flavor (light green colored) and is not creamy. It is bitter, dark green, and icy. The seasonal flavor right now is Honey Lavender and is overwhelming on the lavender and icy. Not creamy at all. The taiyaki cone is worse to the point that I couldn't finish eating it. It tasted stale. And from other reviews it had to be sitting for a long time and was possibly undercooked. The batter for the taiyaki did not stand out and was not memorable. Also it was not very deep so you are not getting that much soft serve. As far as toppings go, they still do not have the dango/mochi and several others. The red bean tastes like it came from a can. Overall, nothing was memorable, Instagram worthy, or worth the money. I would not recommend this place. Try at your own risk.", "author": "Nana R."}

We had the green tea flavor which l liked but my kids say they preferred the traditional vanilla, strawberry or chocolate.", "author": "Jeannie L."}

I admit it looks pretty cool and the soft serve was good but I can't see myself going frequently. They offer a mini size and regular size for their fish taiyaki with ice cream. When I went they had tofu sesame and matcha flavor. My friend and I got the matcha and sesame swirl and also the tofu since it seemed unique. The matcha was really good and you can can actually taste the flavor unlike some places. The sesame just tastes like chocolate to me but just with black coloring. Surprisingly the tofu flavor was good. It might not be for everyone but I liked it because it was not too sweet and reminds me of soymilk instead tofu. When you get to the bottom you taste the red bean paste they put. Although the line was long, it only took 10-15 min of waiting till I got to order. Over all I recommend to try this place out if you haven't gone and want something to satisfy your sugar rush.", "author": "Ryan T."}

Got the regular fish with tofu and black sesame. Not too sweet and unique flavors for soft serve. With tip was $8 but that's not unusual for this town.", "author": "Elizabeth K."}

Fresh soft serve ice cream with delightful unique flavors found in Asia. It struck a chord and hit the spot, a most try for those that crave something new and traditional.", "author": "J. S."}
