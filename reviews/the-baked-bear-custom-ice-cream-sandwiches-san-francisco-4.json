It was my first time here, dragged by my friends who were extremely excited. I have never heard of this place and I am honestly shocked I haven't. \n\nBaked bear is, as per the description in the title, is a custom ice cream sandwich place. It doesn't only have ice cream sandwiches, but plain ice cream and... it slips my mind now, but there's other things too. \n\nI had gotten a custom ice cream sandwich. I got a snickerdoodle cookie with mint ice cream and Oreo crumbles. It came in a tray and it was a little difficult to eat. But it was totally worth the messiness. It was delicious and tasted very very sweet. Now of course, if you don't like it super sweet (or want it sweeter), you can customize it. Don't want it sweeter? Choose a different ice cream or topper. Want it sweeter? Choose a sweeter ice cream or topper. It's wonderful! Instead of a cookie as the \"buns\", you could have a donut or brownie. \n\n(Longer description if you need it:)\nIt's completely outdoors and wonderful if it's sunny (like the day I went). On the left of the truck, there is a menu written in chalk. For a custom ice cream, it has each step written out perfectly. It starts with what you want as \"buns\". There is a list of cookies they have (and they have a monthly cookie which I think is peach cobbler this month), a donut, or a brownie you could choose. Next is a list of potential ice creams you could get. I highly recommend the bear one, I didn't get it but it sounds LOVELY. (Its blue cake batter, fudge, and brownie). Next is a list of toppings, which is placed on the side of the sandwich, stuck onto the ice cream. \n\nIn the middle(ish) is where you order. To order, I said, \"Hi! I would like a Snickerdoodle cookie with mint ice cream and Oreo crumbles.\" They take your order and you move to your right. On your right is the place where you get your order and pay. \n\nFor utensils and napkins, it's on the table slightly on your right when you pick up your sandwich. There is seating in front of the truck (and towards the back...?). \n\nOverall, completely love it. :)) ALTHOUGH.... I'm not sure if it's worth $7. My friend thought it was super similar to Creme. Don't recommend going out of your way for this place but stop by if your in the area.", "author": "Naomi C."}

It's around some other cute food trucks around Fisherman's Wharf. \n\nI got got the espresso bean ice cream with a peanut butter cookie and cinnamon oatmeal cookie and oreo cookie topping ($6.95 + 0.50 per topping= $7.45). I felt like the cookies were pretty undercooked. I wished the peanut butter cookie had peanut chunks or something to bring out the peanut flavor more. The cinnamon oatmeal cookie had a good balance of cinnamon, but I wish it wasn't so undercooked. The espresso bean ice cream was creamy and smooth, though the espresso flavor was not strong at all and I prefer chocolate chips or something mixed in with my coffee flavor (though I guess that's how they get you to buy more toppings). There also wasn't not enough oreo crumbs in my opinion. \n\nMy friend got the cinnamon oatmeal cookie and an M&M cookie with cookies and cream ice cream and M&M toppings and whipped cream. She also thought the oatmeal cookie was undercooked, but she felt the M&M cookie was overcooked. She also felt while the ice cream was good, there was not enough cookies in her cookies and cream and it was just overly sugary. \n\nWe forgot to get our cookies pressed, which probably would have elevated it. Wished the server would have asked us, but still on us for forgetting! If I was in the area, I would possibly give it another try.", "author": "April L."}

I recognized it from an Insider video I saw a few years ago, and I even put it on my list of places to try out, on the off chance I would be in San Francisco. We spoke to the owner and he said he's going to close up the shop but if we order something now, he would stay open for us. Throwing all caution to the wind, we had dessert before dinner and split a brownie ice cream sandwich with the blue cake batter ice cream sandwich, drizzled with caramel. \n\nMan this sandwich was like my sweet tooth dream come true, but then on steroids. This sandwich was MASSIVE. I could see why we had to pay $7/$8 for it. The cake batter ice cream was creamy and subtly sweet (compared to the brownie), making it pair well with the brownie. The brownie had some crispy edges, but was ooey gooey on the inside. Just like how I like my brownies. He gave us lots of caramel syrup, which we appreciated. \n\nIf we had not been so full from the sweets we ate from our earlier trip to MOIC, I probably could have pushed through so with the help of my boyfriend, we would have finished it. Sadly we were defeated and didn't even finish half of it. I would love to come back to The Baked Bear if I have the chance!", "author": "Liselle L."}

The kiddo fell asleep in his stroller and it was my chance to break free and indulge in sweets without having to hide and sneak bites when he's not looking. Woohoo~  Excited was an understatement!\n\nIt was raining and so of course I was the only crazy person there.  I think the worker was surprised anyone even came 'cause I had to ask if they were even still open, lol.  I got to sample a few different flavors and the worker explained I could split 2 flavors if I couldn't decide.  There were so many choices which as a first timer can be overwhelming.  I like picking from a set of tried and true mixes, but that's just me!\n\nThe cookie I wanted only had 1 cookie left so I went with the cookies & cream and paired them with with the brownie dough swirl and salted caramel fudge ice cream.   My order was rung up right away which made me forget that I could & wanted to pick a topping.  It was also really dark so I didn't know I could get my sandwich hot pressed and missed it on the menu.  Oh well! \n\nThe worker was really apologetic that the salted caramel ice cream was on the soft side, almost melted.  Kinda wish he told me that beforehand and I would've picked something else.  He ended up not charging me for splitting the flavors (didn't know that was an extra charge) and gave me 2 free cookies on the house.  Awesome!!  That was a really nice surprise and I always appreciate free food :)\n\nI ran back to my hotel just 1 block away thinking that it would rain harder.  I tried to sneak a bite on my way there but the cookie was hard and the ice cream gushed out.  Once I got to my room the salted caramel already started melting into a pool of goop.  Nonetheless, it was really good!  I loved how the cookie still had a bit of that raw cookie dough taste and was still a bit chewy.  It would have been even better if I got my cookies hot pressed to soften it up (it doesn't melt the ice cream) and if the salted caramel fudge wasn't so soft.  This is definitely THE place to indulge in custom ice cream sandwich goodness.  \n\nI'll be making this a regular stop every time I'm in the Fisherman's Wharf area from now on!", "author": "Maria P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-08-11", "description": "I completely adore the Baked Bear's Ice Cream Sandwiches, and if you're in the need of a sweet treat, you HAVE to come here and give them a shot. A definite hidden gem by the end of the North Beach pier and a complete recommend! \n\nI almost missed their location twice around it- It's kind of a hidden gem I would say! It's tucked behind the touristy pier on North Beach. Their location is basically out of a food truck, but there's 2 large tables in the front for maybe medium sized groups. They also have a small sign that reads The Baked Bear out front, but their location is kinda nondescript.\n\nConceptually in the Bay if you're familiar with C.R.E.A.M or Cookiebar, it's the same concept, only I appreciate the Baked Bear more bc for the charged set price (for me around $6 for their cookie ice cream sandwich) you can choose as many additional toppings as you like without getting charged more. I really appreciate how it's kept at a fixed price, so load on the toppings! I think I actually would put this on par with Cookiebar, and it might actually be one of my new favorite places to get an ice cream sandwich! They also have donut ice cream sandwiches here, which I'll have to get next time.\n\nI ordered the custom ice cream sandwich, so I asked for 2 Red Velvet Cookies (ask for them to be warmed, it makes a difference, trust me!) with their infamous Bear Batter with Sprinkles and Fruity Pebbles on the side. \n\nThe Red Velvet cookies honestly looked more like a chocolate cookie (it was more of a darkish brown than a red) but it was still soft and very chewy. Probably not my favorite red velvet cookies ever- But still pretty good cookies, soft and slightly chewy. I'd also ask to have them warm, as it really makes a difference and softens the cookie a lot. I'D RECOMMEND ASKING FOR YOUR COOKIES TO BE WARMED, TRUST ME! \n\nTheir Bear Batter also really blew me away. Bear batter- Or their Cake Batter ice cream mixed with chocolate fudge chunks really impressed me- and especially since I'm normally not a fan of chocolate. The Bear Batter was sweet without being overwhelmed in their chocolate fudge chunks, and I'd definitely recommend that ice cream flavor.\n\nI also appreciate how if you order their custom ice cream sandwiches or donut ice cream sandwiches, for the set price you're paying for you also get unlimited topping options included! I ordered the Fruity Pebbles and Sprinkles together and I was a happy camper.\n\nThe girl who was working was also very sweet and was really fast making the sandwiches, as the line was getting a little long (even though I came at around 9pm at night & it was chilly from the cold). Props to her.\n\nI'd have to put the Baked Bear at 5 Stars. A total gem, if you're definitely near the Pier or even if you're in the mood for a bomb ice cream sandwich, you NEED to come by and try it here. I'd highly recommend and it definitely ranks near the top in terms of my favorite Ice Cream Sandwich spots in the Bay. Definitely worth coming here & checking it out!", "author": "Allison O."}

I wanted a warm chocolate chip cookie with my ice cream but they only had brownie bowls at the time. It comes with one scoop of any flavor ice cream. I chose cookies & cream with almonds for topping.

Your custom ice cream sandwich can either be a cookie, brownie, donut or a combo sandwich (cookie + brownie)... this is the first step is deciding your top and bottom LoL!

Between work and moving, there's been little time to enjoy my life, but at least I enjoyed some tasty ice cream!\n\nThe Baked Bear is located in tourist central in San Francisco; it's a hop, skip, and jump away from Pier 39 and the mobs thinking that SF is somehow cooler (in both temperature and attitude) than wherever they're from. They're wrong. The day I was here, it was a toasty 75 degrees out, and I had my nose out for delicious, sweet ice cream. If you're anything like me, you like your ice cream to have a fun spin to it, so getting a cookie, donut, or sundae to go with a plain Jane scoop is the way to go. My significant other didn't see the donut option when we opted to split our ice cream, but he did at least see the hot fudge sundae option when I let him choose.\n\nStrawberry ice cream paired with a fudgy brownie is delicious, let me tell ya that. $6 isn't too bad for a hot fudge sundae of any kind, so to see it at a reasonable price near the Wharf was really cool. I'm sure the donut ice cream sandwiches are earth-shattering, because they're certainly aesthetically appealing. If the sugar content or the warmth of the sandwiches doesn't appeal to you, though, I'd spring for a plain scoop or sundae. The menu is incredibly extensive and customizable, and everything comes out quickly, so you should have no problem getting your fix.\n\nAll the seating is outdoor, which really sucks on the approximate 10 days out of the year SF is hot. However, rest assured your ice cream will not melt otherwise.", "author": "Gwen W."}

She called me back promptly and said it wasn't found. Bummer!  So time to cancel the cards and start replacing everything. \nThe next morning she called me back. It WAS found. An employee found it and gave it to the GM, Emma. She was keeping it safe at their other location in North beach where she works. I arrived to retrieve it. Everything was intact! I tried to give her $20 to give to the employee that found it and she said 'No. This is our job to help and protect our customers.\" I argued with her awhile then asked her if I could at least give her a h7ug. She accepted and we shared a nice hug. Thank u Zana (sorry if I spelled it wrong)Emma, and your awesime crew. U really made my day!", "author": "Shelly R."}

And it helps that it smelled really good when you walk up to it!\n\nI ordered Red Velvet cookies with Vanilla ice cream and fruity pebbles.  Besides it being picture perfect, the sandwich was delicious!  The cookie was thick and even slightly warm when I got it!  It was chewy and tasted very fresh.  They didn't skimp on the ice-cream either.  There was so much ice-cream in the end that I couldn't even finish it.  There are other items that they sell there, but the main event is an ice-cream sandwich. \n\nThe service was fantastic as well.  There was only one lady doing everything...taking orders, making the order, and handling money...so it obviously took a little longer than expected, especially on a Saturday afternoon.

This ice cream shop is off a side street on fisherman's wharf. You can make any custom ice cream sandwich with cookies and/or donuts. I tried the combo (one cookie and one donut). The donut didn't taste as fresh as the cookie. I overheard with the customer before me that they ran out of the Oreo toppings. It was about midday on a weekday. \n\nIt's kind of pricey but the size of the sandwiches are big so you can easily share with someone else. Definitely come here on a hot day. They have a few picnic tables for you to eat on. The line is long but they take your order pretty quickly. You just have to wait for them to make it. They should pass out numbers because some sandwiches take longer to make than others.

I so badly wanted to be in love with this place but I wasn't completely wowed. I came across The Baked Bear on Utrip and researched them. Once looking them up I just had to try their ice cream sandwiches because they totally looked amazing!! Well as they say looks can be deceiving. \n\nMy husband and I got here and walked up to the window to order. Once I got to the window I noticed a whole lot of under baked cookies in the window. We all like a \"slightly\" under baked cookie every now and then. However, one that the entire center is undone and looks greasy except a thin line around the edge is a bit weird. I looked at the Red Velvet one because that was what I was going to get that it looked ok. The Red Velvet cookie had a glaze drizzled over the top. I ordered the Red Velvet Cookie paired with Cookies & Cream Ice Cream. My husband ordered a Brownie Sandwich paired with plain Vanilla Ice Cream. \n\nLet's start with my husband's because his was the better of the two. His was actually the bomb dot comb. Well the brownie was. The brownies were cooked perfectly and had chocolate chips in them to add he perfect crunch. One of the best brownies I have had. The ice cream they serve is not anything special by any means. It tasted like they went to the store and bought carton ice cream. The vanilla ice cream was just nice to have with the brownie but it didn't taste like anything to rave about. Now for my ice cream sandwich. The Red Velvet didn't taste like anything. It almost tasted like the brownie in the sense of chocolate flavor but it did not taste like Red Velvet. It tasted like a chocolate cookie. Not what I was looking for. It also was a tad under baked which wasn't the worse thing but was like meh..ok. My Cookies & Cream Ice Cream too tasted like store bought ice cream. You couldn't even hardly taste any Oreo chunks. Like where's the crunch? Come on! So I didn't even eat mine. I took a few small bits and ate some of the ice cream. I just helped my husband finish his. : p\n\nOverall, maybe this was a bad day or I went to a location that just doesn't produce as well. I think I simply give them 3.5 stars for the brownie ALONE. Everything else was nothing to talk about including the ice cream. Considering they aren't a brownie spot is why they aren't getting more stars because I have to rate them based off of what they are selling as a whole. I'm sorry, but as a whole I just wasn't super impressed. Maybe whoever is reading this will have better luck or just order the brownie.", "author": "Tiffany D."}

I went for the super blue ice cream(it was too pretty to skip out). Bear batter is cake batter flavored ice cream with fudge pieces. The cookie I got for the sandwich was snickerdoodle, also not a fan of. The total came out to be $6.45 which isn't bad for the size of the sandwich. Gave it a try and it was definitely not my cup of tea. It's way too sweet and I couldn't really taste the fruity pebbles bc of how sweet the ice cream was. You can also get it with a donut bun or brownie as well as heating it up. They have tables too so you don't have to stand while eating your sandwich.

We came here on a Sunday night around 6:30 PM. The line didn't look too ridiculous, but it actually turned out to be very slow because there was only one person working. That was okay with us! We waited patiently, which allowed us ample time to think about our creations. \n\nThe Baked Bear has 4 types of ice cream sandwiches: \n1) cookie, \n2) brownie, \n3) cookie AND brownie, \n4) DONUT. \nThey also offer Bear Bowls (cookie in a bowl with ice cream on top). You can choose from a variety of ice creams, but they have a unique flavor named \"Bear Batter\" which is blue birthday cake, fudge, and brownie bits!!!! YES!! \n\nWe waited in line for a while and when it was finally our turn, I learned why. Emma, the sole worker providing us with ice cream deliciousness, was treating each and every person with great customer service. She thanked us for waiting, listened attentively while my boyfriend said what he wanted, and she repeated it back to us. Even when my bf had a special request, she said \"Sure, of course we can do it! Why not?!\" It was then that I said it was his birthday, and she said his ice cream was going to be on the house! Emma, thank you for being so genuine and kind while there was a nonstop line outside for ice cream. You're the best! \n\nI ordered a funfetti cookie ice cream sandwich with bear batter ice cream and sprinkles. The cookie stays soft, the brownie and fudge in the ice cream were on point... Honestly it's all I've been thinking about for the past couple of days. I can't wait to go back and get that bear batter!", "author": "Lena C."}

Star Granted. \n\nStar 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nGiven that with an ice cream sandwich you're really getting two completely separate items combined I understand the price premium that's in play; and I wasn't devastated by the $5.50 price tag on my doughnut ice cream sandwich, which is one of the most expensive items on the menu. Star Granted. \n\nStars 3 and 4: How was the food?\n\nI mean what can you say really? The degree of customization, rotating flavors of ice cream and cookies alike all brought together by the fact that it's all homemade is an unbelievable combination, and if you don't like what you ordered it's likely your own fault.\n\nWas this the best donut I've had in my life or the best vanilla ice cream?

Looking at the menu and for my ice cream sandwich, I get to choose between six different cookies, twelve choices of ice cream and an optional topping(s). \n\nBut I decided to bypass all those steps, I decided to get the ice cream sandwich of the month posted on the menu, which is the Salted Caramel sandwich. For $4.50, I get a scoop of salted caramel ice cream sandwiched in a pair of warm and gooey salted caramel cookie. Initially I thought this was another one of my abnormal eats. But the ice cream had a great caramel taste and gooey caramel sauce was strong enough to bond against the wrapping paper. The price is slightly higher than Cream's. But in return, we get friendlier and refined service here. \n\nAs some of you have read from my \"Quick Tip\", if you live in North Beach, you get 10% off your bill.

I was looking around and craved for something sweet and noticed this shop. It's a great concept and very indulging. My visit to San Francisco during this time was during July 4 and it was pretty cold. I didn't care though since I'm a huge fan of ice cream and warm cookies combo. I liked how they let you customize your own instead of just offering set premade options. \nYou start with a choice of your favorite cookie/donut, ice cream ,toppings and the option to warm the cookies. There is a choice to mix and match your cookie for the top/bottom. I went with 2 white macadamia cookies warmed and rocky road ice cream with no toppings. I loved every bite although I had to share since it was getting too sweet for me to finish the whole ice cream sandwich. The prices are fair, expect to spend about $6 average for the cookie sandwiches and $4.50 starting for scoops. You can also order just the cookies which is a nice option to have as well.

The premise: Why should ice cream sandwiches be limited to cookies, when there are so many delicious baked goods in the world? That's just discrimination. \n\nAt the Baked Bear, you can have your ice cream sandwich with COOKIES (tonight's selection: chocolate chip, funfetti, red velvet, and white chocolate macadamia), BROWNIES, freshly-glazed DONUTS, OR ANY COMBINATION THEREOF. Whaaaaaaattttt?! Amazing. \n\nThey have a bunch of different flavors of ice cream, as well as \"toppings\" (side-ings?) that they'll roll your sandwich in. Or you can get it as a sundae, in a brownie bowl. Good luck deciding.\n\nI got a combo sandwich, with salted caramel fudge ice cream between a brownie and a donut, rolled in fruity pebbles. Let me repeat that: tonight, I ate a thing that was part brownie, part ice cream, part donut, and part cartoon-inspired dry cereal. Using my hands. I love America.\n\nAnd the thing was super well-constructed. I was pleasantly surprised; I was sure it would be a mess and fall apart/drip everywhere, but it stayed all together!\n\nHowever, there were some service-related hiccups. First of all, I'm pretty sure they put the wrong ice cream in my sandwich. It was nonetheless delicious, so I ate it anyway, but still. Also, the lady who took my friend's order just disappeared and never made his sandwich, so after waiting around for a while and then realizing she had straight up disappeared, he had to butt back into line and order again.

Located off Beach and Jones streets, it's right next to Carmel's Pizza, which I also had the pleasure of trying. \n\nMy cousin and her friends had a difficult time choosing what to order, myself included! The workers were super nice and patient, offering us cookie samples of flavor of the month: strawberry cheesecake. So good!! It's pink, has a light dusting of pink sugar sprinkles, and tastes like the cream cheese batter is in the cookie itself. I almost thought it would have CC chunks. What sets their cookies apart from franchised competitors like CREAM is how soft and chewy they are. I had one the following day and it still melted in my mouth. Ahhh. Eventually settling for a brownie bear bowl with a humongous scoop of mint chip ice cream, I opted for hot fudge topping, fifty cents extra. The brownie got too indulgent for my taste, so much ganache at the end. \n\nYou can ask for two ice cream flavors in the bowl or in a sandwich. They put the latter in a paper tray and you can use a fork to eat it instead of resulting in sticky fingers. Cookie/brownie/doughnuts can be mix and matched for sandwiches. One in our group ordered the doughnut sandwich with icing drizzled on top, when I looked back it was gone! Must've been that good, and it was shared between two people ;-)\n\nThey accept card!

I think I'm between a 3-3.5 for this place. \n\nI customized my own cookie ice cream sandwich and ended up choosing red velvet cookies with birthday cake ice cream . The combination was YUMMY highly due to the ice cream more so than the cookie. The red velvet cookie was not really that great and I would not recommend it nor get it again. It did not really taste like red velvet and I did not enjoy the white frosting? like part that was on top of the cookie. The birthday cake ice cream on the other hand was AMAZING. The cookie I would give a 1.5-2/5 and ice cream a 5/5. \n\nI also tried out a few of the other cookie flavors. Overall the cookies are all incredibly soft which is just how I like my cookies and they are not overly sweet which is great.\n\nSnickerdoodle - 3/5 It tasted a little more sugar-y than cinnamon and I like my snickerdoodles to have more of a cinnamon taste.\n\nFunfetti- 4/5 This was pretty good and what I expected from a funfetti cookie. I think this would taste amazing with the birthday cake ice cream and would love to try the combination together.\n\nCookies and Cream - 4/5 My favorite of the 4 cookies! It is not much of a strong cookies and cream taste but I really enjoyed the cookies and cream cookie the most! You cannot go wrong with oreos and cookies.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good dessert area around the wharf but I think some of the items are hit and misses.

I love ice cream sandwiches, but I think I've been spoiled by being able to make my own ice cream, cookies, and brownies. Since the boy and I were sharing, I decided we would go with the combo - cookie, brownie and ice cream. I decided on the s'more cookie and the cookies and cream ice cream. Since there was an option to get it hot pressed, we decided to go with that as well. \n\nWhen I was finally able to order, after waiting for a while (a lot longer than expected with the number of people in line), it was beautifully presented to us. I thought the brownie and the cookie would be nicely warm with slightly melted ice cream to make it into a somewhat sundae type dessert...and that's definitely not what I got. The brownie and cookies were lukewarm at best. The ice cream was super hard as well so it made the entire thing kind of hard to eat. \n\nOverall, it was an a-ok experience and not something as amazing as I thought it was going to be. \n\nProtip: definitely go with the combo. Best of both brownie and cookie worlds.", "author": "Nina Y."}

My sisters and mom came to visit me in SF and searched high and low for the ultimate sweet creation. Ema (the owner) is a peach. She was so patient and kind while we designed our creations. There are so many options! She smiled the whole time while giggle and mixed and matched cookies, brownies, and ice creams. Any sandwhich can also be pressed and warmed for maximum ooey gooey yumminess. My mom and Ema chatted for a while and she even sent us home with some delicious cookies.

When we got there, there were plenty of outdoor seating and families just having a fun time admiring how massive their sandwiches were! \n\nI ended up wanting their Salted Caramel Fuge ice cream with their Red Velvet Cookie while my friend wanted their Bear Batter on a brownie. They were both out of those flavors however, so we settled on Birthday Cake, which was kind of a bummer, but understandable since we came late and they're pretty popular.

It blew me away with how delicious it was. I would, however, suggest saving 50 cents and not adding the hot fudge to your sandwich as the hot fudge was actually just chocolate syrup and didn't add much to the dish.\n\nAs well as having amazing ice cream, I also really liked Baked Bear because of the amazingly kind staff.

I got a donut sandwich with bear batter ice cream and fruity pebbles topping. The donut was a bit dry and tasted like something you could get at Safeway. The ice cream itself was good, but a bit too sweet. Paired together with an icing drizzle, the dessert was unBEARably sweet (ba dum tss).", "author": "Sharon I."}

However, I believe it is overrated and it was not really what I expected. It is basically like CREAM however, there are more toppings, cookie choices and dessert choices to choose from. Although, I do like how you can substitute the cookie with a Donut or Brownie. I like how the ice cream flavors are not just the basic vanilla or chocolate but there is for example, the Baked Bear flavor where it is blue and has brownie bits.Other unique flavors are the salted caramel, birthday cake, those were the 2 that caught my eye. I was hoping that when they heated up the cookie, it was gonna be warm but it was not. Everything else was decent as far as seating, price, and choices to choose from.", "author": "Stacey M."}

And lucky for my husband, who had never tasted an ice cream sandwich before (silly Brits - he was literally picturing spreading ice cream on bread), and this was his first ever example of the treat.  Or is he unlucky since he'll never have such a great ice cream sandwich again?\n\nThis location has a few outdoor tables by Fisherman's Wharf, it's basically a food truck.  They have a great mix-n-match menu where you can create a custom ice cream sandwich that will top anything you can buy wrapped in plastic somewhere!  We went with one cookie of the month (it was full of things like little m+ms and other candies) and one white chocolate macadamia cookie, and cookie dough ice cream, and the ice cream was topped with mini M+Ms.  We got it slightly warmed, which was actually amazing because somehow the ice cream didn't melt everywhere (maybe because we ate it so fast?) but the cookies were softer and just had a hint of warmth about them.\n\nIt was so delicious.  Just so good.  The cookies absolutely had a homemade, fresh-baked quality about them.  The sandwich didn't fall apart at all, somehow, and it was only about $4 for a crazy-awesome dessert that we split between two of us since we were stuffed from pizza, but normal people should get one each because sharing something this yummy will make you sad.  It's cold here in England and yet if I had one of these in front of me right now I would devour it in a second!", "author": "Meredith A."}

The location is just a small trailer along the sidewalk with a couple of tables set up.

I had the cookie sandwich with a funfetti cookie and a lemon bar cookie (which was a seasonal flavor) with just vanilla ice cream and sprinkles and whipped cream. The funfetti cookie was soft and chewy, but the lemon bar cookie was hard so it made the sandwich hard to eat in any way.

A donut ice cream sandwich? Brownies? Cookies? And you can mix and match? Sold to the woman who has a sweet tooth. Though there aren't a lot of choices (compared to some places), I still found myself unable to choose. Emma quickly offered samples. Not a big deal, right?\nThat is until we were given the sample of the strawberry cheesecake cookie. It was a whole cookie that she split in half for my boyfriend and I to try. Those cookies aren't too small either! \nAfter choosing (donut with coffee ice cream and fruity pebbles) we were able to talk to Emma more and her daughter-in-law. Both were sweet and pleasant with amazing hospitality. It was like talking to old friends while indulging in delicious treats.

As the weather is getting nicer, the lines are getting longer, and with so many options to choose from can be a little frustrating for someone trying to sneak a break to ice cream, but it's always worth the wait... You won't be disappointed, and don't forget to Tip Emma :)", "author": "Mikaela J."}

I highly recommend funfetti cookie with birthday cake ice cream (although this isn't gluten free).", "author": "Dan T."}

The sandwich was amazing, and the value for money was great. The atmosphere they created was really happy and welcoming too. There is a long line, because they dedicate their attention to one creation at a time, and it's very much worth the wait. I got chatting with the owner, and, in the midst of our conversation, she accidentally mixed up the ice cream flavours. When I pointed that out, she fixed it, and surprised me with a complimentary cookie. Service and attitude was above and beyond.", "author": "Ani V."}
