Would recommend getting the single instead of the double.\n\nI ordered the double cheeseburger, calibur fries (cheese and grilled onions on top), and house ketchup. When my food came it reminded me of what I get at in-n-out. A new take on a classic with better ingredients perhaps. I bit into the burger and was disappointed. The beef wasn't moist at all, and there was barely any special sauce on the burger. I also  would've liked less onions on my fries. I really like the fries by themselves because they didn't have much salt, and the potato skins remained intact. The house ketchup was a blend that had a slight salsa texture to it, and tasted less salty. I've been noticing this new chunky looking ketchup around San Francisco, and I don't understand the appeal. \n\nI'd choose most fast food burger places over Calibur.", "author": "Keegan S."}

I went with a friend who said he \"didn't like burgers that much\", and was, in his words, a \"I like my meats cured\" kind of guy. We order (I recommend the burgers medium well) and then have our burgers nicely delivered to the table. Thank you, Calibur team member, for bringing it over, sorry, I did have my nose in my phone as it was a website chat that came to my Slack, and I was checking to see that someone was responding (yep, I see that \"Paz is typing...\"). Back to burgers.\n\nWe start talking about \"activation\" techniques (he's a marketing guy), and I'm maybe 1.5 bites into my Calibur burger. I look at my buddy's basket and it's wiped clean, burger's gone, and he's surreptitiously licking his fingers. It's been like, 2 minutes since the burgers arrived.\n\nMe: (raising eyebrow archly) You're done...? Already?\nNo-Burger Buddy: (sheepishly) yeah...\nMe: I guess you were hungry.\nNBB: Well, you were talking more than me. So I was eating.\n\nI see what's happening, he's trying to say it's my fault he ate the burger so quickly. Like he couldn't get a word in. More like, his mouth was full.\n\nMe: We've been here, like 2 minutes. What are we going to do for the next 30 mins, since you're done?\nNBB: (eyeing my fries) You going to eat the no-tallow fries?\nMe: You bet your cured-meats-only a__ I am. You can have 1. Ok, 2.\n\nHe ate all my Calibur fries. Now I have to go there tomorrow to get the no-tallow fries, my burgery taste buds feel cheated of their birthright.\n\n* Calibur is an organic burgers fast-food restaurant in West Portal, been there a few years, super awesome on ingredients and taste. Calibur's burgers are so yummy and, surprisingly for a burger, super light on the tummy. And then there's the price: $6.99 for an ORGANIC burger, this delicious, this well made? Seriously? It's a no brainer. The no-tallow fries $3.50 are amazing. If you get to eat them because you have to share. Don't share, get your own, and put them in your basket and set little finger-sized mousetraps around it.", "author": "Vik C."}

It would have had an easy 5 if things didn't feel a bit stingy. The Calibur Sauce (from what I noticed) was good except there wasn't nearly enough of it on the burger. They do give you house ketchup and let you know there's regular ketchup available if needed. (Kinda sweet but not bad,I'm a sucker for house made things) The cheese fries were meh, just a little cheese melted in top (I think more of a nacho type cheese is better than square cheese melted but just an opinion... the cheese was good quality so I'm not mad)The service was absolutely amazing! Liz took our order and was patient yet efficient when doing so. Offered to grill the jalape\u00f1os if I wanted. Then if I'm not mistaken the owner was the one doing the food running and it felt super genuine and homey. I don't doubt if I would have brought up my sauce or meat issue that he wouldn't have been happy to fix it... But again the food was good so I didn't want to bug. The refills for the (fun and delicious) sodas are $1. I would rather not feel the pressure and just have  you charge a $1 for the drink itself or keep the fountain behind the counter.. I do wish they would have asked how I wanted my burger cooked as im a medium rare typa' gal and they only served well done. The bun was what really took this meal and made it something tbh.

More than $15 for a double cheese burger and a side of fries at a no frills place? No juice whatsoever in the patties and they skimp on the lettuce and tomatoes. Never seen such thin veggies in burgers. If you have it the \"calibur\" way, get ready to slather on ketchup yourself because the patties are so damn dry. I could also barely detect any cheese on my burger.\n\nThe bun is a substantial brioche bun, which would be great for juicy patties to soak up juices, but alas, these burgers are cooked way past the point of being appetizing. I think they use good meat because I can taste the beefiness but the patties are too thick to cooked to medium well. I asked for medium rare but nope. If you're desperate for a burger, there's no other easy options in the area, unless you count bulls head, but it's more of a sit down. I guess when you're the only fish in the sleepy part of town, you can do well despite being subpar and overpriced. And the cashier was annoying and uppity.

Well I am glad I took a chance with this place because I can say more confidently that I will return here. \n\nThe burger was pretty big that what you normally see in fast food burger restaurants. They use real burger meat , meaning not like microwave patties. It's pretty thick, so I don't mind paying more for this burger. They grill it to medium or medium well. The beef is organic grass fed, so Holsteins cow  should have had a happy life eating natural grass at the Cream Co.. The bun is shiny and pretty and texture is different and I like it. If you open up the bun to inspect the burger, they use smaller red tomatoes  which I think tastes better.  Ingredients are fresh looking. Oh I forgot to mention that the brown paper wrapper on the burger was wrapped nicely and it caught the juices of the burger nicely.  Not oily burger or garlic fries. \n\nThey made my orders pretty quickly because I don't think I waited that long. It was nicely packed by the worker and delivered to my table.  I had ordered a single burger, double burger, garlic fries that came with fresh tomato sauce and Alameda Point soda fountain root beer. \n\nNot too busy on Sunday night at 5pm.

Still, despite the absence of pre-set combinations, there are plenty of ways you can customize your burger, starting with whether you want a single or double patty and ending with your choice of garnishes, sauces, and add-ons, which do have up-charges (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/calibur-san-francisco?select=6xbcS_5-u8dqPX3ItGLPcg).\n\n-- GARLIC FRIES...$4.49\n-- CALIBUR FRIES - French Fries topped with Grilled Onions and Calibur Sauce...$4.49\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/calibur-san-francisco?select=GqNIQy6ns5lhqKbuQEPVBg)\nBoth varieties had me excited, but neither blew me away.  Of the two, the Garlic Fries were better; crispy and garlicky, though all that rosemary was overwhelming.  As for the Calibur Fries, they're kind of like In N Out's Animal Style Fries, but without the cheese. Not bad, and pretty interesting, but the grilled onions, while sweet, tasted a little bitter/burnt.\n\n-- DOUBLE AMERICAN BURGER with Bacon (+$1.50) \"Calibur Style\" (Calibur Sauce, Lettuce, Tomatoes, and Grilled Onions, though I subbed them out for Raw Red Onions)...$9.49\n(https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/calibur-san-francisco?select=55tgsPzMDMYsXSd3CJN0ww)\nGranted, I got the double, but this was still one hefty burger!  The patties (cooked med well) were juicy and well seasoned and the strips of bacon just made it meatier.  At the same time, the burger didn't feel overly greasy and I liked how soft the bun was.  Too bad you can't choose the type of cheese, though you can sub for $.50 more per patty.\n\nEven though I've only had their burgers once (for now...), I'm definitely a fan of Calibur.  They may fall short of comparably priced spots like Super Duper, but they're definitely better than most of the other neighborhood burger joints I've been to, like Tower Burger or Jenny's on 9th Ave.  Tasty burgers, friendly staff, awesome location...I'm a fan and will definitely be back for more!", "author": "Mike L."}

We definitely support Ma & Pa businesses nowadays especially with all the corporate companies coming in and making it a little bit more difficult for them to survive.  We'll rate on a few items:\n\nAtmosphere 5/5 - relaxed and calm, with some good R&B playing in the background.  It was actually a perfect atmosphere for my girlfriend and I.  Plus the place was VERY clean.  We walked up and we were greeted by the cashier who was very friendly and definitely took pride in the 'human experience' of taking your order, giving excellent customer service and also describing what you were buying and/or asking about.  Our orders are always complicated because we have certain food allergies and choices so we take note if the person serving us is kind and patient or rude and inconsiderate. They were definitely kind here.  \n\nPrices 5/5 - not cheap nor expensive; everything is fair and priced right in my opinion.  Grass fed beef and organic ingredients are expensive, and owning a restaurant anywhere in the bay area is expensive.  No complaints here.  \n\nFood 5/5 - Burgers- we got lettuce wrap burgers with everything.  Beef patties were delicious and good sized.  All the veggies on the burger were fresh and tasty.  I normally hate pickles in my burger, but these were perfect, and the tomatoes were Roma, so they have a different taste (better than regular tomato's) Nothing was too seasoned or over cooked/spiced.  The meat tastes like MEAT, the way it's supposed to.  Not too lean or fatty, just right. The oils trickling off weren't too fatty or gross, but just perfect. All delicious and fresh.  The house sauce is bomb too. FRIES - we got garlic fries caliber style- these were amazing.  The soda is quality craft soda, sorta like HANSEN brand.  Very good quality.  My lady and I shared a diet soda and it was definitely better than any Diet Coke/Pepsi.  \nThey have homemade ketchup and house sauce- try both.  I love ketchup but hate how there is so much sugar in Heinz and other organic brands.  This ketchup was the biz  everything was just really tasty and excellent quality.  \n\nOverall- 15/15 perfect score from us.  this establishment is about quality and high standards from the chairs and tables, to the staffs attitude and all of that trickles into the food quality and presentation. The food was wrapped perfectly in the wrapper and every detail was carefully looked over.  After ordering we went back up to get another item to go.  We noticed a kind gentleman training a new employee behind the counter.  I could tell this man took a lot of pride in the business and really made a positive effort for success and training his employees. Having experience with many types of businesses, i asked him if he was the owner.  He said 'yes' and we chatted for quick minute.  He later brought our food to us and was VERY kind.   Thank you Sean for a great experience, we will return and recommend your business.  We wish your restaurant a lot of success and positivity.  The only feedback We will give is maybe hang some photos up on the walls, if you're into that-we were thinking classic muscle cars.  But if the plain white is the 'look' that's cool too.

I wanted burgers and the roommate didn't want to leave the house, so we placed an order through Caviar. We submitted the order at 2:05pm and it arrived at 2:43pm. (I live in Outer Richmond.)\n\nPrices listed below are what Caviar charges. Comparing this to Calibur's online menu, prices are the same.\n\n*Quarter pounder: 1/4 pound patty served with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, pickle and house made ketchup ($6.95), add Heinz ketchup (free), Dijon mustard (free), Jalapeno (+$0.50), Mushroom (+$1.50), Bacon (+$2), Cheddar cheese (+$1.50)\n*Half pounder: 1/2 pound patty served with caramelized onions, lettuce, tomato, pickle and house made ketchup ($9.50), add Raw yellow onion (free), Heinz ketchup (free), Mayo (free), Jalapeno (+$0.50), Egg (+$1.50), Bacon (+$2), American cheese (+$1.50)\n*Chili cheese fries ($5.95)\n*Tallow fries: fries cooked in beef tallow ($3.50), add Cheddar ($1.50)\n\nI got the quarter pounder. It was a little overcooked as I ordered my burger medium rare, but I was more bummed that they didn't put onions, lettuce, tomato and pickles in it. Both Caviar and Calibur's menus state they come standard with each burger. So where were my veggies?! I liked the flavors of the burger, but it wasn't the same without those ingredients.\n\nThe fries were good. Crispy on the outside and soft inside, but I wouldn't waste the money to add cheese. It was just shredded cheese melted on top. Most of it melted on the bottom of the paper dish, so it wasn't very cheesy. I wish they used cheese sauce instead. The chili fries were okay. I don't like beans, so I didn't really eat that much of this.\n\nI had a bite of the roommate's burger and really liked his half pounder. It was cooked medium rare as requested, so nice and juicy. And it was more flavorful than mine with the onion and egg. It made it feel more like a burger.

So when our craving for burgers ignited, we decided Calibur may be the exact spot we had been searching for. \n\nWhile I love mostly everything about the city, the one thing I DESPISE most of all is the FREAKIN' PARKING. My poor hubby drove around the area for at least 40 minutes trying to find a free spot. Finally, the Gods of Parking felt sorry for us and gave us a spot that was about two blocks away. Normally I would frown at the distance, but I was too dang hungry to care. \n\nCalibur itself is a pretty small building that is longer than it is wide. Decorations are bare since they seem to rely more on simplicity than anything else. To order burgers, you pick the size of the burger (quarter pounder, third pounder, and half pounder) and any additional toppings on top of the typical tomatoes, lettuce, and pickles. \n\nWe both got the third pounder, but I added an egg and mushrooms while my hubby added cheese and bacon. We also got garlic fries to share. First off, the prices are EXORBANT here. The burgers without any add-ons are already about $9 and any additional topping is at least $1. The fries were an additional $6 and before you know it, the final price rang up to $30. For burgers!? Crazy... \n\nThe food came out fast and looked very impressive at first glance. The burgers were piled on like a mountain and the fries were long, thick, and crispy. I made the mistake of undoing the wrapper around my burger and ended up making a big, big mess. The meat in both of our burgers were hot and juicy, tasting great with the crispy bun. I loved having the egg on mine and my hubby said his bacon was fried well. But unfortunately, the hot meat was terribly cooled by the icy cold tomatoes and lettuce. I was so disappointed! How could they serve cold tomatoes on a hot burger? Absolute atrocity! \n\nBut their fries... WOWEE! They know how to make their garlic fries right. It just didn't have the taste of garlic, it was COVERED in actual roasted garlic and thyme that made for a mouth-watering side. Super impressed with those! It did come with a fresh tomato sauce, but that was cold as well. What a bummer... \n\nSo while Calibur serves gigantic burgers, for the prices, it really can't do anything less. The fries were phenomenal, but serving food with cold ingredients was such a shame. The verdict? I guess even San Francisco has its fair share of sub-par eateries.", "author": "Quyen L."}

There is a 4 dollar for any three extra toppings. I got the fried egg, cheese and mushrooms. For the kids burger the add ons were half off. \n\nThe music that played in the shop was great.

Burgers aren't hard to make, but while some places give you a stunning job, most fail miserably.

Thusly,\n\nSINGLE BURGER ($6.49+$0.50 for cheese)\nTHE BUN: had excellent volume, immaculate tan color with a slightly shiny exterior, and was dense (dare I say a bit too dense), but otherwise was very refreshing compared to many other burger places that I've been to.\n\nTHE MEAT: was a little boring, but seasoned with justice. I got the single burger so maybe I should've gotten the double burger.\n\nTHE CONTENTS: roma tomatoes and lettuce were fresh. Onions and melted cheese (adds a few dolla extra) weren't bad. \n\nALSO TRIED\n\nGARLIC FRIES ($4.49): kinda boring fries with a smidgen of fried garlic. I suggest that they add more.\nCHILI CHESSE FRIES ($4.49): the same boring fries with chili and cheese.

Parked the ride, pulled out my phone and opened up this trendy little app that all the cool kids are using to find local businesses that we love to support. \n\nI figured I would give Calibur a shot. Walking in it felt like I was squeezing into a subway station that has the most amazing burger and garlic fry smells coming from the kitchen in the back and waft towards you while you stare at the menu trying to decide what you want to eat. \n\nThe menu is pretty cut and dry... Want a burger, great... How large of a burger would you like? Quarter, third or half pounder? They also have a veggie burger that I hear is pretty damn good as well. Then you choose your toppings, they have five options on the board for you to choose from cheese (cheddar, american or swiss, bacon,egg, mushrooms and avocado, ranging in price from $1.50-$2.00 with bacon being the most expensive. Or you can choose 3 toppings of your choice for $4. \n\nThey do have standard toppings that come on your burger that make it \"Calibur style\" those include caramelized onions, Calibur sauce (a homemade ketchup that tastes more like a marinara sauce), lettuce, tomatoes and pickles. I personally went with a third pounder with cheddar cheese and done up \"Calibur Style\" of course with the s.o.s. (sauce on side) please! Also ordered some garlic fries and took a seat. \n\nAbout 10 mins later there was a monster of a burger sitting before me and I thought to myself, let's see how far we can get with this one before its time to call it quits. The guy who brought the burger out reminded me to be careful as Calibur burger's are juicy and he was not lying about that. The burger was cooked to perfection, seasoned just right and all of the ingredients tasted fresh as could be, all stuffed between a light and fluffy brioche bun.\n\nThe garlic fries were crispy and were coated in finely chopped garlic and a rosemary and thyme seasoning that packed a punch. I read that they fry them in a mixture of beef tallow (a fancy way of saying beef fat) and rice bran oil. They did not seem greasy and they were definitely crunchy. \n\nI was over all pleased with this visit and will give it another try in the future as it was a pleasant way to chill and scarf down a burger (yes, I ended up eating it all) while watching college football on their flat screen mounted above the entry way. \n\nGreat service, and a tasty burger and fries...

Don't get me wrong, I mean I think a place that serves full-portion artisan salads deserves to thrive, but I'm the type that can't be trusted at a salad bar. I don't mean I sneeze into the protective glass guard or anything, but I ladle on the unhealthy toppings like nobody's business. I'm lucky if I see a lettuce leaf underneath all the bacon bits, candied pecans and ranch dressing. That sorta describes my experience at Market & Rye. I single-handedly defeated its purpose, but I guess I can always find redemption at its surviving location in Potrero Hill. Anyway it's all about the burger now. It's owned by two young guys who obviously gave a lot of thought to their food.\n\nAfter all, they hand-grind the fresh meat and hand-cut the potatoes. They also use Three Twins ice cream in their milkshakes. And that's all they do if you don't count the chopped salad option. Which I don't. It's the In-N-Out model, and I respect it. I hate when fast food places diversify beyond reason. I call that the Jack-in-the-Box syndrome: offer too many things and do all of them badly. But no they stick with the basics, and I decided to go whole hog that evening. I ordered the &9.50 Half Pounder and added Cheese ($1.50), Bacon ($2) and Mushroom ($1.50), so that amounts to $14.50 and I haven't even left the burger yet. A Regular $3.50 order of Fries please. Y'see? I showed discretion by not going for the Large. But I did go for the $5.95 Strawberry Milkshake. I had to, it's a house specialty, right? RIGHT?? And so the wait began.\n\nI sat myself at a lone table next to the front window, and about 15 minutes elapsed. In the meantime, I found myself trapped by the hand railing and a bevy of fat-bottom girls who barricaded themselves with their iPhones at the next table. The food finally arrived. The burger was ridiculously huge and camouflaged by the butcher paper wrapping (photo: http://bit.ly/1sNBQa5). Pricey sure but juicy and delicious with all the right accessories.

The milkshake was thick and abundant (photo: http://bit.ly/ZFSSMK). Brain freeze ahead. They gave me a complimentary bottle of water when they saw me gorging. Egad, I'm full.

Standard ingredients are lettuce, tomatoes, special sauce, & caramelized onions.  Cheddar, blue and American are options for cheeses.  \n\nThe bun was thick but enjoyable.  As mentioned our beef was cooked just right, medium and juicy!  You can tell everything is made fresh here. Loved the carmelized onion.  Nicely melted cheddar too.

Also, \"house-made ketchup\" is always something that sounds good, but when you find that the regular ketchup thing is completely empty, that should tell you something.\n\nI came here with the best friend because I hadn't realized that I completely skipped lunch by accident. It was 4pm. Oops. They were also having a Harry Potter special: Butterbeer milkshakes. Obviously, this had to happen no matter what.\n\nThe staff was friendly and made sure to inform me that the wait time for this special milkshake would be 10 minutes. No big deal, since I needed actual food and not just delicious Potter-inspired dessert beverages. I ordered a burger with cheese and their house-made ketchup, no special sauce because it had mayo that I'm allergic to, garlic fries, and said Butterbeer milkshake.\n\nFood arrived quickly. As I mentioned in the first sentence...holy moly. Best burger bun I have ever had in my entire life. The rest of the burger...um...not so great. I don't know what it was about the house-made ketchup, but it was awful. Best friend also had the same reaction and we were both pretty bummed that the Heinz dispenser was completely out (but as best friends, I was given the last of the ketchup that could be dispensed. Seriously, best friendship right there). The burger was strange. It was...steamed? It was...cold? I don't know how it was cooked, but it lacked the wonderful grease that you order a burger for in the first place. It felt like Chris Traeger in Parks & Rec was trying to make a burger with Ron Swanson's advice, and then tried to make it \"just a bit healthier\". That is not what I want in my burger.\n\nThe fries were pretty good. Super garlicky af which is a necessity and quite delicious. The Butterbeer milkshake? Surprisingly good. I felt bad for them since it was obviously a pain to make. It had butterscotch pudding, Butterfinger bits, vanilla ice cream. Stuff like that. It was a nice thick shake, but slightly difficult to get through the straw\n\nAll in all, a good place, but I've never been so upset by a burger before. I'd only come back for a shake and fries. And maybe the bun on its own, if they'll give that to me.", "author": "Robbin A."}

The grilled mushrooms were a great add on to provide a bit more flavor. The bun was nice and crispy. Overall, the taste of the burger was decent because it wasn't SUPER good but you could tell there was a lot of effort put into it to make it look aesthetically pleasing. The garlic fries were a bit strange because they added a whole bunch of rosemary on top. I wasn't a huge fan of the rosemary because it took away the garlic taste.

The beef was seasoned but not enough for my palate.   I am all about intense flavors and proper technique and temperature.  The bacon was perfectly prepped- crispy and thick. Lettuce tomato and grilled onions spot on. Nice buns Hun.  \nFreshly bought brioche.  \nCons- the tables were not self bussed or staff bussed properly.    Unsure on the policy here. If diners can self bus so the next diner up can use the spot it needs to be clearly indicated.  I had to wipe off a leftover chunk of beef on my table.

The fries are crispy, the shakes creamy, the burgers savory. Ingredients are top shelf. From the produce to the buns, it's all fresh and carefully put together. I don't know how to describe the flavor but strongly encourage you to try this place and take the challenge to describe it.

I am typically dedicated to my favorite burger joint of all time (Hall of Flame),  but I decided to give this new, sexy place a try. I CHEATED on Hall of Flame and I am so sorry that I did. \n\nI got the half pounder with egg, bacon and mushrooms. Also got chili cheese fries and regular fries... No expense can be spared when getting it on with your mistress. \n\nBurger: I order medium rare because I expect it to come out medium (although I'm ok with either)... It came out medium well,  if not well done. This was hugely disappointing, but the most disappointing part was my egg was cooked solid... You order an egg on a burger expecting it to ooze and fulfill your delicious, yolky fantasies. No such luck. The bacon was okay -  not extra crispy as one would hope, but more of a thicker, chewier cut. \n\nFries: they sounded good in theory,  with the way they describe it on the menu, but they were nothing extraordinary. They give you a shit ton, which you think is awesome because you pay so damn much - lest we forget how cheap fries can be. \n\nWhen we got our platters, the chili cheese fries had that look they've been sitting for awhile - you know, where the cheese looks like it congealed on top? Taste - wise, it was alright...  But it tasted like a can of Trader Joe's chili with a slice of kraft cheese thrown on top.\n\nHubby and I ate here, with the entirety of the meal costing $40 before tip. Had it been the best burger in San Francisco, I would have gladly come back. However, with the overcooked patty, overcooked yolk and congealed cheese, I will not be back. I'd rather spend $40 somewhere else... Or better yet, $6 at In-N-Out or $10 at Hall of Flame, where their meals come with fries. \n\nAlso, the cashier was super friendly, but the younger teenage / college kid making milkshakes is lazy. Customer complains ketchup is empty, you should probably refill the ketchup, instead of sighing heavily, as if the world is against you. \n\nAlso, for all you organic fiends, you should probably do some research on what exactly organic means... Because that term is so loosely thrown around with everybody jumping in like cattle thinking it's super healthy. Companies price point their items higher because of the organic label hive mentality.", "author": "Christina B."}

Ordered the veggie burger and was disappointed to find it was actually a black bean burger. Usually that's called out of the menu, since it has such a distinct flavor.  The patty was not very firm, and ended up oozing out the sides of the bun. Not at all a satisfying veggie burger experience. It's a bummer, because the bun, grilled onions, etc., were delicious.  But, without a good veggie burger option, I will not return.\n\nAlso got the veggie fries (guess they're usually fried in lard), and they were quite good. Wish they had a smaller order, though, because the amount was far too much for one person. \n\nOne other thing to note was how long it took for my order to be completed.  More than 15 minutes. Far too long to wait for a burger and fries. Don't know if it would've been shorter without the veggie fries.", "author": "Lyn R."}

With so many great burger options in the city like Causwells, Roam, Chez, etc., I expected something amazing when i ate here.\n\nI was pretty annoyed that when I ordered, the worker never asked me about adding cheese. Like seriously? If you aren't gonna ask me what cheese I want, then it should be included automatically. There was no clear signage about cheese options. Definitely not visible on the topping list. So I had my burger with no cheese. So that sucked.\n\nEven without the cheese, there was a lack of flavor going on. Beef patty was just okay, seemed a bit on the dry side. And their \"Sauce\" tastes like a bland salsa. Only real flavors were the caramelized onions and mushrooms.\n\nI got the chili cheese fries, and that wasn't that great either. \n\nThe only bright spot of the dine in, was my vanilla milkshake.\n\nI wouldn't say this burger joint is overpriced. I think if the food is amazing, the price will be justified. So I guess spending $23 and change on a mediocre experience didn't feel that great.\n\nThe people here are nice, and I wanted to love this place because I live close by, but don't think I will be back anytime soon.", "author": "Charles L."}

Overall, the flavors of the burger did not complement each other.  \n\nSecondly, the garlic fries had a bitter taste because of the rosemary garlic mixture. NOTHING GARLICY ABOUT IT AT ALL. And also, it came with their \"homemade sauce\" which he said was ketchup, but as it turns out, it's just marinara sauce which does not taste good with fries. \n\nI spent $28 dollars, and it was SO NOT WORTH IT AT ALL.

I'm getting totally addicted to this place and nothing would please me more than if everyone could experience what Calibur offers.  Most basic, the burgers are totally amazing, juicy, delicious with an old-fashioned beefy taste that I haven't encountered since my childhood.  I'm serious; these burgers are f'ing extraordinary. If you don't specify otherwise, they'll be cooked medium rare.  The first time I got one of these medium rare burgers I was alarmed, having grown used to gray over cooked patties because of the danger of pathogens in rare ground beef.   But no worries here; their meat is super fresh and local, from a ranch up in Mendocino.  If you're still worried, just specify medium when you order.  A standard burger comes on an almost magical bun, more like brioche than commercial bread.  It's topped with delicious griddled  onions, lettuce, tomato and sauce.  Today I added blue cheese to the burger, and that's the way I'll order it forever.  I wish I could accurately explain how delicious these burgers truly are. In Michelin Guides a restaurant with a star is described as worthy of a detour from a planned route. And so that's how I'll finish this review; Calibur is worth a trip from anywhere in the city - so today I anoint it SF's first Michelin Star burger place. Bravo Calibur!", "author": "Peter D."}

I was a bit disappointed when I read that they use a mix of tallow and rice bran oil.  I know tallow is expensive that's why a lot of establishments use cheap oil and this place had to use a mix.

When it comes to burgers (and burritos), I consider myself I foodie. I've had hundreds all of the world. So why the bad review? I really hate to do this, but I think this would help management. \n\nThe Good: Fries were unique and I enjoyed them. Organic items on the menu, simplistic menu which I'm a fan of and sugar cane coke bottles. \n\nThe Bad: I ordered a medium rare burger and it came extremely rare. Sadly, I took one bite out of the burger already and swallowed (and got sick shortly after). I never usually send items back, but this time I had too. The meat was so rare, the center was cold. I never order a burger anything other than medium rare (best flavors, imo), so trust me, I know what rare and medium rare looks like. The owner (I believe) agreed and apologized several times. He was really on top of it and I applaud him for handling it so well. He brought me another burger and followed up within 3 minutes. Sadly, this time it was cooked well done, but I didn't want to prolong my dinner since my girlfriend was nearly done with her food. As an FYI, her burger was medium well versus her requested medium. \n\nFOOD/DRINK: \n-Got the 1/3 pounder with cheddar cheese and avocado\n-My girlfriend ordered the 1/4 pounded with cheddar cheese\n-Large fries\n-Coke and Sprite (bottles)\nTotal Bill: 32 dollars\n\nAMBIANCE: Simple burger joint decor, not a whole lot of character or personalized. They had the giants game on though, which was nice. \n\nSERVICE: Unlike my fellow yelpers, the service was very good. One inconvenience is if you order a bottle soda, you need to grab it on your own, then walk back to the cashier to have them remove the cap. Often times, waiting for someone to finish their order. It would better to have a bottle cap opener on that utensils table, since the restaurant is self serve anyways. \n\nCREDIT CARD: Yes\n\nPARKING:  Meter\n\nOVERALL: No matter how good a burger is, if you don't cook it properly.. it can't be that great. It may be growing pains since they're new, so I hope to try them out sometime again. However, definetely not a good first experience.", "author": "Austin N."}

Calibur does a better burger, a MUCH better burger. The meat is excellent. The veg. with the burger is fresh and tasty. Great bun. The ketchup onion sauce absolutely rocks the burger. Flavorful and perfectly cooked. Hands down the best burger I've had in San Francisco, and I've been to all the supposed top spots. The fries are also very good, as are the shakes.\n\nThe bad:\nIt's a small place. However, so far seating hasn't been that bad. \n\nA few comments:\n- Calibur had kind of a rough start. I was there early on and service was slow + they were having problems with their fries. However, both problems have been more than fixed. The service is now very good and the fries are now excellent.\n- Their homemade ketchup sauce rocks on their burgers, but I like regular ol' ketchup on my fries... which they have if you ask for it.\n- Wish they'd put a condiment station by their water: ketchup(s), mustard, & hot sauce(s)\n- Wish they'd add onion rings to the menu.\n\nSummary:\nCalibur is now my favorite spot for a burger in San Francisco.", "author": "Michael S."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-11-23", "description": "Got the quarter pounder with 3 toppings: bacon, mushrooms, and egg.\nI have to wonder if the topping proportions are randomly sized or they just try to fit it all in. I did here this couple nearby compare bacon portions, and they seemed different.\n\nBurger was okay, got it medium-well, the juices pretty much could not contain themselves and made a mess. I was really surprised about how intact my egg remained. The bacon wasn't crispy, it was thick though, just not well crisped. Mushrooms were tasty though. Bun was what I expected, nice partially-shiny crown, something that will hold all the yummy...it did give out when I got more than half-way done, got all soggy on me :(\n\nAlso got fries to share. Really should have known better, for two people, a large order of fries is overkill and just an accessory to this meal I could have gone without. A bit on the limpy side too. Their house-made ketchup isn't bad, it's different, but you have to see it in the unprocessed light vs the standard ketchup they also offer. It's weird, and I haven't decided if I like it, but I don't hate it.\n\nMilkshake was really light. Flavorful, yum, yes, but if you want thick (and cold) this won't be it. If you don't want to fight your drink, then get this $6 shake, or grab a squirt soda, OR Mexican coca cola it!\n\nIt's still 4 stars because there is potential, and really for what they are offering, the price is on the mark. Can't really say what the \"special\" factor is. Maybe it's offering high-quality ingredient for your basic burger and accessories? I like to think of this as my fancier In-N-Out. Yes...that's why we shelled nearly $40 here for 2 burgers, a milkshake, and fries.\n\nAnd they really weren't as slow as some of the reviews made this place seem. It felt like an average wait time of 5-10 minutes for orders, and place was getting packed after we got there.\n\nSo food is solid 3.5 (noting botched, nothing really profound)\nI want them to do well...and amaze me next time, so I rounded up okay!", "author": "Carol L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-12-23", "description": "This place uses high quality ingredients and you can tell through the taste. The beef tastes really good, the vegetables taste fresh, and the fries are tasty.\n\nOf course, using good ingredients comes at a little bit of a higher price, but I certainly don't mind for anything that is of quality.\n\nThe fries are really good. They have a nice texture to them. Mildly crispy on the outside but still a little soft. I found them to be seasoned really well.\n\nA couple things that I wished they did, as far as my personal preferences go. I'm a huge mayo fan, and I think that any really tasty burger will either have mayo or a mayo based sauce (like In-N-Out spread, Big Mac Special Sauce, Shack Sauce) to take it to another level. Here I think they only add their house made ketchup (which personally I don't care too much for, and thankfully isn't a dominating flavor).\n\nAlso, I'm more of a soft bun kind of guy. While you can take a look at their bun and immediately tell that they are fresh and artisanal, they aren't as soft as I like. I like burgers with soft buns because they kind of stick closer to the patty and holding the ingredients much better. Eating the burger here can be a little more cumbersome, and I think that's because of the bun.\n\nDespite my nitpicking, they still make a really good burger. Perhaps one of the best in the neighborhood and surrounding area. The service is friendly and attentive which certainly goes a long way in making me want to come back.\n\nAnother bonus is they serve Three Twins ice cream. Haven't had an opportunity to order it here, but would definitely come back to try a shake some day.", "author": "Jeffrey J."}

The ambiance is nice and the well dressed up hole in the wall is inviting and in a good area with lots to see, but other than that there isn't much else that shines for me. The biggest problem is the price, and boy for what you get it is high. A burger can run you anywhere from 8 bucks all the way to around 15 dollars. Toppings are WAY to expensive. $1.50 for your average slice of cheddar is pretty steep. Milkshakes cost almost as much as the cheapest burger and the veggie burger is your typical run of the mill patty. I get that this place is supposed to be organic and GMO-free but honestly it doesn't even taste that way. This reminds me of a more expensive, lower quality super duper burger. At least at super duper burger you can tell the food is high quality. \n\nThe people who work there are nice enough and they are willing to answer any questions that you may have, as well as bus your table for you (which was unexpected at this kind of place) but strangely enough one of the people working there (seemed like a manager type) was watching my company and I eat maintaining eye contact with me and then the second I finish eating he almost jogged over to the table to grab my dishes.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-01-24", "description": "$18.38 for 1 good-sized quarter pounder (with three add-on's for $4) and 1 strawberry milkshake is steep, especially for the location that it's in.  I mean, West Portal is a beautiful neighborhood with a combination of chain (Starbucks, Peets, Squat & Gobble, etc.) and local, independent shops (Bookshop West Portal, Two Cats Comics, Ambassador Toys, Shaw's, Goat Hill, Spiazzo, Submarine Center, etc.), but Calibur needs to lower their price.\n\nI placed my order over the phone and the guy (Sean?) was very helpful; I was thinking about the 1/3 pounder, but seeing as I wasn't ridiculously hungry, I went for the 1/4 pounder, no onions and pickles, and adding on mushrooms, egg, and bacon.  I then thought about getting a side of fries, but when the guy over the phone told me the fries was a larger portion, I decided to hold off until next time.  Upon arriving to pick up my order, I found out that if you live or work in or around West Portal, you actually get a small discount off your meal; simply mention it (and perhaps show ID) to a staff prior to paying.  \n\nAlright, so after getting home and taking my burger out of the bag, prior to enjoyment I noticed there were pickles as I clearly instructed, over the phone, \"No pickles\".  Oh, and I do believe the guy mentioned the burger includes housemade ketchup, which clearly I received zero of.  I should've called to let them know, but didn't want to create any hassle since the guy seemed pretty nice.  Regardless of the errors, the burger was still enjoyable nonetheless; I did appreciate the different add-on's from your typical burger joint.  The runny egg makes for a messier burger, but that's what you get.  For a meal close to $20, I feel the patties could've been thicker (that is, if Calibur shapes their own patties) so customers are getting more of what they paid for. Then again, beef does shrink once they begin cooking on the grill so perhaps shape them larger prior to cooking.  And since people are paying a steep price, I'd suggest creating a more \"premium\" or original burger that already includes the various sides, perhaps Calibur's original variation on a mushroom burger or burger loco moco.", "author": "Jessica S."}

Before McDonald's switched from beef tallow to vegetable oil for their excellent fries in 1990, it was the perfect recipe. Calibur's tallow was overwhelming.

A burger joint that serves ALL ORGANIC(NO pesticides & GMO) is VERY HARD TO FIND. This can be my go to place since its organic with no GENETIC MODIFICATION of the food that I am eating so I praise them for that. \n-nice staff since it wasnt busy at 5:30 sunday. \n-1/2 lb burger even with no toppings was very juicy!\n-tallow fries was fried twice in beef fat(not healthy) but does have beef flavor. To be honest I RATHER EAT BEEF FAT FRIED FRIES OVER FRIES THAT WAS FRIED IN GMO COTTON SEED/CORN OIL ANY DAY! \nAnd it is true that GMO in general can cause health related issues like unusual reactions from your body after consumption of some GMO foods since your body is not use to the food being genetically created in a lab by altering its genes. Also there is no significant long term studies done about eating GMO foods. But scientists speculate that GMO's might cause DOWNSYNDROME AND INCREASED ASTHMA. Also the government gives permission to the corporations/companies the task of researching and handling GMO's safety if you didnt know. Also if u can please support GMO labeling initiatives of your groceries in FUTURE VOTING BALLETS if you care about what u eat since voting is the least u can do. \n\nCONS:\n-The website does not state clearly that ALL their ingredients are ORGANIC. \n-The burger joint was clean and well lit. But the area where u order is narrow and have to move out the way for food to be brought out. \n-a little pricy. \n-needs more of their calibur sauce in burger. But i was asked if i needed more while eating.   \n\nBeing very generous i give it overall 4/5 stars based on food and price.

The burgers here are organic which is awesome-It's so nice to fulfill a burger craving without all the guilt!  Ordering on Eat24 is super easy as you have many choices for toppings and extras.  This was our lucky \"winning meal\" twice now for the Warriors playoffs including the BIG Championship win last night!!!!!  Go Dubs!  Ordering for pick up went without a hitch on both occasions which really says a lot when placing a large order for 10-15 burgers with different meat temps, and various condiments & toppings.  I spoke to Sean over the phone the 1st time I placed our groups large order because I had forgotten to order a chocolate milkshake, plus I admit I was slightly worried as to how well they would execute the order!  After adding the milkshake and speaking to Sean briefly I learned they were new to using Eat24.  He was very genuine, friendly, and assured me that my order was received and would be ready for pick up in 30 min as I requested...and it was!  Not only that, each burger was neatly labeled on their containers in detail with a sharpie making it really easy for us, and my medium rare burger was a perfect med rare.  Score!  Bun to patty ratio was proportional.  Additionally you can just taste the freshness of the ingredients: the crisp of raw onions and lettuce, a juicy tomato, melted cheddar cheese with a bite, and a soft fresh bun with a spread of Dijon mustard and ketchup -can't get any better than that in my book!  Tallow and Veg fries tasted great, and probably excellent when it's served hot/ non take-out.  The only thing our group was not a fan of is the organic ketchup, mainly because it just does not taste like ketchup, doesn't particularly look like ketchup either consistency wise, besides being red (looks more like pur\u00e9ed organic tomatoes).  But they have regular Heinz ketchup too, so it's a non issue.  Highly recommended and will be back for sure!", "author": "Caryn H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-03-07", "description": "This rating is based solely on their veggie burger, which was the best I've had in a long time.  Everyone's preferences are different, of course (I see one recent reviewer could have made a better one \"in the comfort of her own home\"), and one person's five star veggie burger isn't necessarily another's, so I'll try and articulate what I liked about it without making comparisons to veggie burgers around town that I _do not like_ at all.  First, the patty itself was flavorful and just spicy enough.  Some veggie burgers are bland, and others rely - IMHO - too heavily on beets, and thus become too sweet.  I liked the texture of the patty as well.  It was firm without being too hard, and the contents were course without being too chunky.  If I had eaten the patty by itself I would have enjoyed it.  I found the bun to be just right: fresh, soft, and flavorful.  The lettuce, tomatoes, onion, and pickles both looked and tasted fresh - and were present in just the right quantities (personally, I'm always a little perplexed and disappointed when I end up with _just one pickle_ on a burger).  I got Swiss cheese and avocado and although I'm sure the whole thing would have been pretty good without these additions, the melted cheese really tied the whole thing together.  To each their own, but for my taste, this veggie burger rocks.", "author": "Marie M."}
