All were very worthy and memorable (especially with the California Chili hot sauce), I'd rate:\n\n1.  Chicken tenders [$8, 5.0 stars] -- incredible batter, perfectly cooked. \n\n2.  Bacon deviled eggs [$8, 4.5 stars] -- a little small, 5 x 1/3 eggs, but OMG.\n\n3.

I wish the chicken was more flavorful but it came with a sweet dipping sauce, which was good in moderation.\n\nThe Pork Sandwich - The disappointment of the evening.

They also serve food, which I've had a couple of times (and was good pub grub) but the main highlight is the beer.\n\nI've occasionally had issues with the place getting a little overheated (especially upstairs), but it's not unbearable. Other than that it's a nice space.\n\nHighlights: watching a dog show on the bar TV from 3 years ago while sipping on a pint and becoming increasingly more invested in which doggo was going to end up on top.

Burger\n\nThe streak fries are very, very good. I highly recommend you get them. During the 2 times I have been here, I have ordered at least 5 portions of it because they just disappear because they are so good. They always come out super hot, which I really like. They are also super crispy on the outside, and soft on the inside. The chicken tender were surprisingly good. They were super crispy on the outside, and tender on the inside (in the best way possible). The sliders and burgers were also very good. Always come out well seasoned. I've never personally had any of the deviled eggs (with bacon jam or cured rock cod), but I kept needing to order more of both kinds during the work event. I think in total, over the course of 1.5 hours, I ordered about 6-7 portions of it. It seemed like people really enjoyed them.  \n\nThis place has a very impressive selection of beers. They also do have wines, if beers/ciders aren't really your thing. I would definitely be back for the fun environment and tasty food.

We were initially dismayed at the wall of people & sound when we crossed the threshold.  And there wasn't an empty seat in the house at 7 pm on a Wednesday night.\n\nBut \"seating karma\" was with us that evening. On making an about-face near the bar, I noted a sweet window spot just opening up. We descended quickly, to the annoyance of others who noticed too late. (I've been those people many, many times).\n\nI left to order beers while P guarded the spot.  And after our beers were half sipped, I guarded the spot while he ordered food at the register; necessary precautions with the constant, roving packs of seat-hunters. Sort of ridiculous, truth be told.\n\nThe food was decent and very much in the gastropub mode:\n\n-- Sliders: We ordered two plates of 3 mixed sliders:  The chicken slider was a bit boring; the pulled pork was good but not great; but the standard beef was my favorite\n\n-- Deviled eggs with bacon jam: Decadent as expected. Delicious but not mind-blowing.\n\nThe service here was excellent, even though the only option was to order beer and food at the bar. The super friendly bartender looked like she had just hopped off the bus from Kansas. She was so very psyched and excited about every single beer she poured it became a joy to order.  Bussers roamed the room efficiently, removed empty plates and beer glasses out of our way.\n\nAnd speaking of beer, their list was fantastic: 31 beers, all from California, consisting of multiple types and styles, and mostly winners. I tried a double IPA, a session pale ale, and ended with lovely, smooth Baltic Porter. We didn't really need brews at the concert venue after that.  :-p\n\nLove: \n-- Great beer list and service\n-- The faded, neon sign out front advertising the old 1950's Key Club location. Definitely on the hipster end of the spectrum. But I loved the disinformation.\n\nDidn't Love:\n-- Crowds, crowds, crowds. Yes, there is such a thing as being too popular; we were indeed fortunate we found a spot. Next time I try to come here I'll make sure to have a backup spot in mind. I doubt we'll be as lucky.", "author": "Dan B."}

Keep in mind that if you go here, their kitchen is not prepared for any sort of rush.  Friends and I went here before a show at the Masonic a few weeks ago.  We all ordered at the same time, my 3 friends got their food in about 10 min or so.  I kept waiting for my food (nothing complicated, just a salad and crostini).  30 min later I still don't have my food.  The waitress was pleasant and it definitely wasn't her fault, she was trying her best.  Finally I go back to the person who took my order and she was very nonchalant and rude, tells me the kitchen is backed up and to wait.  I told her it was ridiculous that my entire group had already finished eating and I hadn't gotten my food.  They gave me my money back right as my food came out, 45 min after we ordered.  The food tasted fine but by this point I was so irritated that I didn't enjoy it at all.  I will not go back.", "author": "Julie P."}

Servers were very nice, and the beer {we had a very dark ale it was excellent} was very good.  We ordered the fried chicken bites, the deviled eggs, the crab cake bites and the steak fries.  The crab cake bites were very fishy {too fishy} but the sauce on them was very good.  The deviled eggs were amazing - definitely my favorite of our order.  Our server, who seemed rush, pulled our table number 1/2 way through delivering our order.  When I asked if she still knew we were getting a few other dishes she immediately returned it, however, when we got the remainder of our order the fried chicken bites were over-cooked and very dry and the steak fries tasted like they had been sitting for quite some time.

We sat at the bar so we didn't have to keep getting up to order. Overall I would return if I was nearby, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here.", "author": "Rachelle Anne J."}

It was a disappointment, especially after reading so many rave reviews of their food.  The menu has apps, salads, sandwiches and cheese/charcuterie.  I had the fried chicken sandwich and fries, which the bartender said was so excellent he ate it everyday for a month straight when he started working there.  That's some high praise, so when it arrived with two thin, barely crispy 1/4 inch thick slices of chicken I was disheartened.  I got the impression the chicken was previously fried and then reheated when the sandwich was prepared.  The steak fries were hot, but only half of them were crisp and the other half were sad limp high school cafeteria steak fries that you eat because they're there, but you aren't happy about them.  \n\nThe chicken sando + fries were $13.

I was telling my boyfriend last night how I feel there are so many of these types of bars in SF now that the novelty has gone a little downhill for the city and that it's really hard to choose a favorite with the wide variety of beer on tap from various breweries. I don't really explore this area too often but I figured it's hard to compete with the ~30 or so beers they have!\n\nWhat's a little annoying about this place is that the servers don't take any orders; they only deliver your food. All food and drink orders are at one register at the bar which is a little hectic considering the capacity and popularity this place gets on a weekend and having to wait in a line that one person is in charge of. And if you're sitting up top like we did, you will get some serious cardio in! Aside from that, the food, beer, service and layout of this place is awesome. Price ranges from $6-8 for a good glass of craft beer, small plates from $4-$12, and a good meals from $10-$18 which is very reasonable IMO. My boyfriend and I got a cozy two-person table upstairs and got to enjoy people watching from above while sipping on beers. I tried a very good sour and the Altamont Mango Crush Wheat Ale which was delicious! Lately I've been on a light and fruity beer craze so these have hit the spot! As for food, we shared their five pc bacon deviled eggs, five pc dungeness crab tator tots, their charcuterie board, and their Hopwater truffle ricotta. I definitely want to come back for a good burger or sandwich with fries! Beer isn't complete without some good fries!\n\nGood spot for big and small parties and post-work happy hour. It can get a little loud here so maybe not too ideal for a first date. They also have TVs playing the most current sports game which is easily observed from upstairs, woohoo!", "author": "Kathleen S."}

The restaurant offers about 30 local cali beers on tap. The menu provides a pretty good description of taste and the bar tenders are very knowledgeable about providing suggestions as well in case you get stuck.\n\nI started with the Blitzen, a high content, triple IPA. The beer was delicious, plus it was 10% alcohol. As our buzz set in, we  took a gander at their food menu. The buttermilk chicken sandwich caught my eye. While waiting for the food to arrive, I ordered the Hella Hoppy, a 9% double IPA. I guess I was watching my IPA count...\n\nThe food arrived shortly thereafter, and I was very happy with my chicken sandwich. The deep-fried buttermilk chicken was served on fresh sourdough baguette topped with slaw, mozzarella and chimichurri. I wasn't too sure how the chimichurri would work with the fried chicken, but I was happily surprised that it did. The sandwich came with thick cut steak fries which were good, but could have used a few more seconds in the frier to get more crispy. \n\nMy wife ordered the veggie sandwich and was loving it until she found a black curly hair on her plate.

You have to order at the bar and they give you a number to set down on your table. Since I am not a big fan of beer, my review is based mainly on their food. However, I did order a glass of Two Rivers Raspberry Cider, since it seemed to be the least likely to be \"beer-like.\" I made a good choice because the cider was very light and fruity. \n\nFor dinner, I had the Soup of the Day (cauliflower and beer cheese) and Angus Ground Chuck Burger. I also got to try their Onion Dip, Dungeness Tater Tots, and an Angus Ground Chuck Slider. \n\nCauliflower & Beer Cheese Soup: HARD PASS. When the waitress brought it out, the bowl it was in was hotter than the soup itself. The soup was disgusting and tasted like they used bleu cheese to make it. I took one sip and didn't touch it again for the rest of the meal. \n\nOnion Dip: Meh. The dip came with homemade potato chips. The waitress let us know that if we ran out of chips we could always flag her down for more. The dip itself wasn't spectacular and I would probably would pass. \n\nTater Tots: very strange. The tots were made of real crab and potatoes. I would definitely pass because the flavors did not go well together for any of my friends or me. \n\nBurger & Slider: Meh. The burger was too oily for me and the steak fries that came with it were too salty. The slider tasted better only because of the house yellow pepper catsup that came with it. \n\nThe food here was mediocre. I wouldn't come here again unless my friends wanted to just drink beer and hang out.", "author": "Melanie H."}

We celebrated my bf's birthday here and we had a good 10 or more people so we got here early and sorta took over the back room. But it was that chill. No one cared and it was feel good fun with their so many beer on tap and their food you have to go to the bar to order and one waitress brings the plates to you.\n\nOkay so the food, we ordered the duck three ways, crab \"tater tots\", burger and crab salad. My friend order the deviled eggs with bacon and some other stuff, i don't really recall.  \n\nLet's start with the apps. So the duck three ways was amazing! i wanted to lick the plate! Lol the only downfall is that one of our friends came later and order the duck three ways and our plates did not look the same.  They added extra stuff to his plate which kinda threw us off and was disappointing.. The crab tots are not tater tots, hence the quotes i put prior when i was listing the food.  it was good but not a lot of crab and we were REALLY expecting tater tots. They really are just croquettes. The deviled eggs, I would recommend. It was pretty good.\n\nNow the main course.  The bf had the burger, which i asked for medium rare and it came out beyond well. It was really dry, which was disappointing because the seasoning of the burger was really good, but for us to keep eating the burger, we had to keep adding ketchup to get us through how dry it was.  The crab salad, for $17 (i think, might have been slightly more or less) was a completely rip off and definitely did not look like what a few people have posted in the pictures. It was such a huge let down. It was greens with some salty crab meat and sauce, that I can recall... the only thing good about it was the dressing, the dressing was pretty amazing.

Anything from good ole' familiar local boy Anchor to more niche in-state players. You're bound to find something you like and it'll be like drinking your way through the Golden State without ever leaving your seat. \n\nThere are drawbacks though. The ordering process is a little confusing when you first walk in especially if it's crowded but basically you order at one end of the bar and you get a number for your food and your brews right away. We didn't find menus at first and went around the bar ourselves to get them. Think it would be more efficient maybe to split the food and beer ordering. Speaking of food, it's acceptable bar food here. Nothing to exceptionally rave about but they complement the brews well. I accompanied my Sticky Zipper American IPA with their burger and it was executed well as ordered. Relatively juicy and paired with tomatoes and arugula, which I love, and served with a hearty order of steak fries. The fried chicken sandwich, which sounded so good on the menu, turned out to be a little wet and messy which nullifies any fried action on the chicken. \n\nStill, if you like beers, and Californian beers in particular, you should come here.

Ok so not snow, but the hills were there. \n\nI had an amber that the bartender recommend and it was wonderful. Smooth, light, and refreshing. There are plenty of beers on tap for all. I sat at the bar, it was fairly crowded for a Thursday evening at 7:00. That's always a good sign. There is more seating towards the back, that's great for larger groups. You order at the bar and a server brings your food. \n\nThen I got what I wanted-the truffle Brie with toasted bread. I'll be honest it was the strangest yet greatest thing I have ever eaten. Tangy but creamy light yet full. I can't really describe it, but it was good!! Just get it if you love Brie. \n\nThe Dungeness Crab tator tots were really just a fancy version of mini crab cakes, but again delish. Crispy on the outside and full of rich crab on the inside.

So after a Saturday night of sushi and drinks we strolled in kinda later on around 11:00 or so.\n\nThere was some scattered open seating towards the entrance but after a little while we were able to relocate upstairs. The crowd there was pretty solid and average that night, some middle aged folk and younger people as well. Not unwelcoming in the least. Kinda dark lighting, good ambiance and overall I ended up really liking the scene inside.\n\nThe food we tried was limited. Homegirl and I split a burger and fries as we had already threw down on some sushi earlier. She got the burger medium well which was probably pretty wise considering how rare it came out. I normally get things medium rare, and it came out right in between medium and medium-rare. It was fantastic though, the arugula was a hit with both of us. What was kinda cool to me was that it wasn't anything individually fantastic about the burger, rather just a culmination of healthy and fresh ingredients. Everything tasted really awesome. The fries were good but I mean, fries are fries to me. I'm not someone who's gonna rant and rave about fried slivers of potatoes. I remember the beer selection being pretty standard as well, but I'm not a huge drinker either so don't take my word for it.", "author": "Jim B."}

The beer selection is thumbs up; the food is good, but what has not got this place pushed to the four star mark for me is the ambience. \n\nDRINKS/FOOD: I split the an order of sliders. It was solid, but nothing spectacular. A pretty small slider with no frills, but made decently. The drink options are great and many. All the drinks are local brews of the Bay Area and can satisfy anybody's IPA to red ale needs. \n\nAMBIENCE: For a Wednesday night, it was fairly packed when we got in at 7:30. We got the edge of a table, but it seems if you are patient, you can get a table. The line moves fast when ordering and is pretty orderly, which is appreciated. It is fairly well lit, but perhaps a touch brighter. Also, the music selection is nowhere to be found. Maybe some quiet music in the background would help. My friend said that there was music, but it was pretty loud so I couldn't hear it. \n\nSomehow, there's something about this place I like and I feel like is lacking.

Great choices and quick bartenders. \n\nAgain, a great place to grab drinks and hang out. Don't bother with the food.", "author": "Yohan N."}

They were generous about sampling, and had great recommendations. \n\nThe space is very cool, and it's huge! Most places in our neighborhood are holes in the wall, and don't offer much space for crowds. Hopwater has a huge main bar area, a back seated area, an upstairs seated area that seems like it would fit another 40 people, and there's whispers of a back patio opening up eventually too. And the fact that they restored such an odd, awesome old building really enhances the space. It's definitely a tribute to the old Key Klub, and they even kept the old neon sign (which still works!). The beer-themed decorations are great too.\n\nThe beer is fantastic. The selection is amazing, and all the beers I tried were top-notch. The new Anchor IPA, which I haven't seen in any other bar, was very good. They have 30 beers on tap, and plan on changing the beers frequently. \n\nFood service supposedly starts today. They're planning to have good American pub food, with burgers, sandwiches, lots of meat and a salad (Louie, they guessed) or three. \n\nThe fellow bar-goers were great too.

The weekend I was there Bay To Breakers was going on, and even though the Hopwater isn't on the race course, it definitely made for good people watching. \n\nI love the exterior of the building. I don't know if they had just moved in and plan to renovate it, but I hope they don't. The rotted out \"Key Club\" sign gave it a sort of punk-noir/speak-easy vibe. When I went in I was shocked to find everything well-appointed in copper and wood, giving further credence to this being the kind of place Sam Spade finds the bad guys hanging out at - albeit the upscale ones.\nThis being SF I anticipated a $15 burger and $7 pints, but I was pleased to find the food and drinks there incredibly reasonable, with a lot on tap. I think I paid about $10 for my burger, and $5 a pint for good Northern California beer. I found a place by a window and camped out there, watching the sun go down behind the buildings and a naked dude in a scarf do laps after the race or something. \n\nRegardless of how many times that man brought his dong around the block, the Hopwater was content to let me sit and watch. I think I hung out for about 3 hours, I ordered one meal, and drank about one inexpensive beer an hour. The whole time the service was still chipper, and everyone was having a good time.

A tall, heavyset bearded guy was at the register. I asked if it would be okay to push two tables together, something that I as as server would really appreciate because it's annoying when guests start rearranging furniture. All he would say is 'it's open seating' in a soulless voice.\n\nMe: Hi! I'm in a group and the long table is taken, can I move tables together?\nHim: It's open seating.\nMe: I know, but is it cool if I move tables together?\nHim: It's open seating.\nMe: Yes, I understand, so no one minds if we rearrange things?\nHim: It's open seating.\n\nI finally got irritated at the obstinate refusal to help and walked away. Then, of course, there's no table service, so I had to keep getting up and interacting with this guy whenever I needed drinks or food.\n\nEach interaction was unpleasant and I have no idea what this guy had against me, but he would ignore me as if I were invisible, be oddly dismissive and impatient when taking my order, and in complete contrast to how I was treated, I watched him be super nice to the regulars in my party. We ordered a lot of food and drinks, and I seriously don't get why this guy was such a dick to me the whole time. It completely and totally ruined my experience here, I left feeling livid and somewhat hurt because I'm a nice, polite person that treats service people like gold. I've worked in service positions my entire life and I know how a good customer can make your shift.\n\nHe had a lot of chances to turn it around, because we continually ordered drinks. Each time, though, I got the same treatment. I couldn't believe it. He had been kind of rolling his eyes and being all impatient when taking our food order and, not surprisingly, one of the items was wrong. When I took it back to him, he gave me a hard stare and waited for me to explain. \n\nMe: I'm sorry, we asked for x ---\nHim: Yeah? I put that in.\nMe: .. but we got y.\n\nWith a look of irritated disgust, he snatched the plate from my hand and without a word, disappeared into the kitchen.\n\nI have a lot of patience and rarely complain in restaurants, but that was it for me. I wish I was exaggerating about what happened, but I experienced some really shitty service and a lot of unwarranted attitude, the likes of which I cannot remember ever previously receiving at a restaurant.\n\nThe food was okay, not great. Fries came out unsalted, by far not enough crostini on the cheese or meat plates (cheese is mostly soft varieties and needs something to spread it on), chicken tenders weren't crispy (sauce on top made matters worse). \n\nAt a certain point, my interactions with the guy were so unpleasant that my whole experience was affected. It was really hard to find things to like when I felt that I'd been treated so dismissively. No worries, though..

We were cozy sitting 6 to one of the small booths upstairs. Everyone was getting beers round after round and I got the Cobb salad which was pretty good. We didn't have to deal with many servers or people who worked there because we were upstairs, but the one guy who dropped my salad off gave me attitude for having my number stick thing on the ground. Sorry, I've never been here before and assumed you called numbers...don't be rude to me for something that was an accident.\n\nWe eventually moved to a bigger booth downstairs and had a couple mini beer glasses that broke during that move. My friends wanted to play quarters in them, but we decided that probably wasn't the best idea in public when clearly the staff either didn't like us to begin with or just wasn't friendly in general. One girl came over and started to take the glasses and said \"these are broken and they're dirty anyways, so I'm gonna take them.....\" with more attitude than I've ever been spoken to with in a bar or restaurant. Just after that, someone went up to the bar and ordered another round. The bartender said the beers would be brought to our table since we were right next to the cash register and there were 6. The woman who brought them was so unnecessarily rude about it, saying \"we don't normally do this, so next time get them yourselves\". It was a simple misunderstanding no need to be sassy.\n\nSo I have worked in restaurants for 6 years. Since when has it become ok to talk to your customers like this? This is my first time in San Francisco, so maybe it's just a culture thing? I work in a ski resort in Colorado, at one of the busiest restaurants, and if I EVER spoke to a customer with an attitude like I experienced at Hopwater last night, there is no doubt I would hear about it later. We had a couple misunderstandings at a bar none of us had been to before.....I'm sorry you find that reason to be rude. With the amount of beer consumed and dollars spent, you (whoever is reading this) absolutely need to make sure your employees get an attitude adjustment and learn how to work in the service industry so that they don't make their customers want to leave on the spot, no matter how good the beer and vibe is. \n\nMaybe it was an off night and everyone was pissed because it's Halloween weekend or because the Giants aren't in the World Series...I don't know.

I like hearing those kinds of things. I am by no means a beer snob, but you will never catch me with a bottle/can of coors or bud in my hands. \n\nAnyways, the SANDWICH. Okay, wowuhhhh. Juicy tender pieces of fried chicken breast tenders sit on a soft french roll bun, soaking up all the garlicky-herby goodness that chimichurri has to offer. Melting mozzarella cheese graced every crevice of that chickmeat while thinly sliced tomatoes waited to be devoured in a single bite. \n\nPaired with handcut steak fries, crisped to a perfect golden brown, this was an excellent meal to end my Wednesday and start my short trip in Frisco. \n\nI nightcapped with the barley wine that was also on tap, and I have to admit, I don't remember how I got to my hotel so quickly. It must have been that I walked/tumbled down some steep ass hill. Anyways, I'm still alive and breathin'! \n\nI will make a point to stop in here again if I am near Union Square.", "author": "Thomas O."}

We chose this place because of the beer selection, like everyone else. It's impressive. \n\nBeers are served in an imperial pint glass or a snifter and they are either $6 or $7. They also have wine options between $7-12 a glass. These beers apparently rotate frequently and had a bunch of interesting varietals to try. Food: we ordered the Dungeness crab tater tots, which were bizarre and only had like 5 or 6 pieces, so we didn't get anything else. Crab mixed with potato severely diluted the point of the crab and the end result was mushy with most the taste coming from the sauce. Pass.\n\nSeating upstairs feels crammed, it's stuffy. and loud. I definitely recommend finding a spot on the ground floor next to the glorious beer board and beautiful tap wall. Much more space and comfortable even though the place was packed with brew drinking enthusiasts! ..What was nice, it was a good crowd, not a bunch of snobbish, hipster \"douche-baggery\" that often fills places like this in other places in the city. \n\nThe major drawback, like anywhere in this area of the city, is the parking situation..so I am not counting that against Hopwater...but it made our night start much later than anticipated. Nearby parking lots can fetch up to $30 flat rate. \n\nOverall, we definitely enjoyed our time and trying some neat and tasty suds. Because we live north of the GG Bridge, parking for an hour made this destination tough as a rendezvous point.

You order food and drinks by the bar area, which makes it pretty easy to get everything you want at one time. Once you place your order, they will bring your dish to your table. I ordered a friend chicken sandwich that I was pretty good. Nothing too spectacular with the sandwich, but it got the job done and was satisfying enough. I also ordered a cider to go with the meal, which was enjoyable. I think that next time I would opt to try one of the many beers that they have on tap. Seating was found quite easily, although the tables were a bit small and more equipped to hold two people to a table. Definitely a neat place to scope out if you are in the area.", "author": "Daniel H."}

You'll find some very interesting ales, stouts, and ciders over here. My favorite was the Pecan stout.\nWe also ordered some food. The highlight were the deviled eggs and meat charcuterie. Deviled eggs were quite possibly the most amazing appetizers I've ever had. The spotlight from the charcuterie was definitely on the duck liver mousse. Smooth, creamy and delicious. We also ordered a Burger which was delicious and juicy(fries could use some help). However, stay away from chicken tenders here. Pretty soggy, lackluster flavor and a tiny portion. \n To sum it all - it was a great experience at hopwater, but they could use some extra staff behind the bar (gets pretty busy) and maybe work on their portion size.", "author": "Dhruv B."}

It was crowded so I made my choices based on brief descriptions on the chalkboard menu above the bar.  They also serve bites - the dungeness crab puffs were mmm good and so were the deviled eggs.

I'm sure it's no issue on quiet nights when there is nothing going on at the Masonic but it was a bit annoying the night we went.  That said, beer selection is obvs on point and the food was pretty darn tasty:  hubs got pork sandwich that he really liked and the I got the chicken tenders which I could have easily eaten another portion.  I would go back but next time I'll either make sure there is nothing going on at the Masonic or be sure to eat beforehand.", "author": "Krista C."}

Def recommend if you're looking to drink craft beer with friends, and especially if you wanna grab a house burger too.\n\nDrinks: We honestly didn't order any, but according to the drink menu, everything was a Cali craft beer and ranged pretty much from $5-$7. Not bad, considering what the rest of SF charges. Free water.\n\nFood: Not much on the menu. Some apps, and a verrryy small handful of burger/sando selections. Ranged from like $8-$14.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-05", "description": "I wish I could give one review for the drink and one for the grub. Alas...I cannot. So, let's start with the good news: the beer selection is excellent. I have yet to find a better selection of California craft beers. I tried three beers, all IPAs which ranged in goodness. The specific beers matter less than the great selection. A plus was that the servers behind the bar were all really friendly and helpful. So, if you want to have a wide range of CA craft beers to try with a friendly beer-tender...this is a great place.\n\n As for the grub well...why not five stars? In a word, the food was average...and I'm being kind. I had the charcuterie plate to start which was fine. Nothing to brag about but not bad. What really left me sad was the pathetic burger. Notwithstanding the fact that having it with cheese is an option (at a gastropub?) the meat was terribly overcooked. I order my burgers medium rare and this was decidedly medium well. A chef knows that if you're going to error...error on the side of rare. While I'd like to think this was aberration, I was sitting at the bar next to a regular who confessed he's experienced a the same issue again and again and orders his burgers rare. My advice to the chef is to pick a cheese for your burger and stick to it. Once you decide on a cheese...cook the damn thing correctly. I simply can't give 4 and 5 stars to a place with truly pedestrian food. And all I'm really judging here is the burger. But if you can't do that right...am I really going to explore the rest of the menu? Me thinks not. In summary, excellent selection of California craft beers accompanied by average, at best, gastropub fare.\n\nA hint: This is a seat yourself place with an order at the register and get a number style. So...if you have a large party it could be painful. Before you head to this place have a good sense of what you're getting into...this is not a sit down and be served by a waiter place. This is not a problem...just something I know some folks will want to know before they arrive.\n\nIn closing I'd like to share that if these guys can better define their burger and learn to cook meat...i will gladly revise my rating to 5 stars.", "author": "Z Z."}

I'm guessing that this place was taking a bet that they would lower cost significantly by eliminating a phone line--and thus someone who needs to be there to answer it, and by having their bartender take food and beverage orders for the entire establishments.

And if you forget to order something, want to get another drink or if your order is entered wrong -- as was the case for us--  you have to start over and stand in the long line once again.

The mushroom had a very rich, savory, firewood smoky flavor (I have to really emphasize the firewood flavor). Also, as a connoisseur (at least I wish to be) of craft local brews both home and abroad, I'm disappointed I wasn't feeling really well because they have a beautiful selection of about 30 crafts on tap.

The inside is very nice with a large bar, tables and a loft above with more tables. The vibe was pretty chill (we had early dinner on a Monday). There were mostly young people (late 20s/early 30s) but also a few older folks. You order at the bar and then they bring the food to you at your table. Sometimes when restaurants are set up like this, your plate never gets cleared, etc. but the service was surprisingly good.\nWe had a golden beet salad, some deviled eggs and a chicken sandwich. Everything was very good--deviled eggs aren't necessarily my thing but they had bacon and something sweet on them, so they were delicious.

I went with my boyfriend and two friends and we all tried different beers, all of which were delicious. (I even got to taste before I ordered which I appreciated). We had dinner and my burger was the perfect compliment to my drink. Excellent service, happy staff, beautiful space. I HIGHLY recommend Hopwater and will be back very soon!", "author": "Anne P."}

Amazing flavor!  Simple options all well done and a selection of beers to meet any picky palate. Service was attentive and speedy.", "author": "John Q."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-07", "description": "Went there on a recommendation from a show on TV. The beer was good, but the place was way smaller than it looked. The crowd was like a college bar and seemed like the neighborhood was not the best area. Tip, there is no sign, it is where the large, lit up sign with nothing in it is.", "author": "Thomas I."}

Bartender was very knowledge about what was being served. Great lighting and not so noisy you can't have a good conversation. Will be back again soon.", "author": "Marshall R."}

My husband and I wanted to go to a laid back place close to our hotel but wasn't frozen reheated junk, Hopwater fit the bill.  The decor is nice but the acoustics are terrible, it is really loud. There is a great beer selection full of a lot of beers I have never heard of.  I didn't ask for any but I saw some people trying samples prior to ordering.  As far as dinner, we shared the deviled eggs with bacon jam, which were fantastic, there were 6 so it wasn't a skimpy appetizer either. I had the Dungenus  Louis salad and my husband had the chicken sandwich. My salad was fantastic, lots of crab, the lettuce was arugula (yum) and the cherry tomatoes and broccolini were fresh.  My husband thought his sandwich was so-so. The fries on the other hand were great, thick cut steak fry style. All in all I would come back.", "author": "Tracy G."}

This place was near our hotel so we decided to check it out. Excellent beer selection with super nice bartenders that made us feel right at home. The food was surprisingly great as well. We had the crab tater tots and sliders and would have ordered more if we didn't already have dinner plans later. Wish we didn't live 3000 miles away.", "author": "Andrew A."}

The burger was great and I loved that they serve you a normal portion of fries (not a heaping huge mound!). Food came out super quick. Great beer selection. Great place to go for a casual dinner or drink!", "author": "Lauren B."}

I was a little surprise how spacious the place is. It's two stories, with a huge beer bar and kitchen on the first floor with lots of bar seats and large tables for big groups. Upstairs there are smaller tables (fits 4 per table). They have over 30 selection of Californian craft beers with a large chalkboard menu atop the bar that does a pretty good job in describing each beer. Prices per beer were pretty decent at about $6-8. Food menu was small but tasty, their burgers and deep fried stuff were pretty solid. There's no waiter service so you have to order everything at the bar, but they are pretty fast about it.  They also have a good selection of salads and healthy eats as well. The place has a cozy feel to it, I came on a Tuesday night, so the crowd was predominately people coming off work. Overall, a great gastropub (a pub that specializes in serving high-quality food, yes I just learned this word) in the union square area!", "author": "Quyen T."}
