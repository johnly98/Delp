Hungover and want a burger? Again, your place. Craving a milkshake? Come here. I usually get the farmers market salad with the turkey patties and red wine vinaigrette dressing. Now this isn't a cheap salad by any means, but you definitely get your bang for your buck. Is usually runs about $15 but compared to other places, your salad is huge and very filling. They always update what's in the salad based on the season which I love and makes it so I won't ever get sick of the salad. \n\nI've had the classic cheeseburger which is great and my boyfriend usually gets the tejano burger which looks delicious. You also can't go wrong with any of their French fries. \n\nMy only gripe is that the salad is so big that I always need an extra dressing, and almost every time I ask for an extra dressing, they forget to add it. Now I do my best to double check before leaving, but if I could recommend anything, maybe make your dressing sizes larger to be even with how large the salad is. \n\nAlso you can order online for pick up ahead! Highly recommend doing it to beat the rush. They also do delivery on caviar and I believe grub hub.", "author": "Morgan J."}

Unfortunately, the delivery took longer than expected (over an hour), but I think that was more Caviar's fault. And when our food did arrive, my burger was luke-warm. That being said, it was one of the better luke-warm burgers I've ever had. That's a testament to the wonderful ingredients Roam uses. I had the Heritage Burger which consists of Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fontina, Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, Herb Mayo. You also have the option of adding extra condiments like House Sauce, Ketchup, and Jalape\u00f1o Relish (among other tasty toppings). The burger runs about $12, but even without fries, it's a satisfying meal in itself.\n\nThe next time I visit Roam, I'll probably opt to dine in as opposed to dine out.

Their beef was juicy and savory, not too salty. I liked how my burger had fries and avocado. Hehehe. You can ask for the fries on the side, so they don't get soggy/wet from the juice of the meat, but I like it together. The fat from the meat dripping onto the fries give a poutine-like feeling. \n\nI saw many people using their hot sauce, so I had to give it a try.

I read reviews online of people saying it was good, however those saying that this is nothing more than an instagram shop had me a bit worried.\n\nUnfortunately, they were right. I got a BBQ burger because it was the only one of their premade options(which should be the best combinations they offer), and was also the heartiest as the rest were mostly just veggie filled with 1 difference between each burger. There was very little flavor from both the meat and cheese, which are the centerpiece of any burger. The bun had very little flavor, and I had to eat it by itself to even taste it. The onions HEAVILY overpowered any other flavor going on for the most part and had to take most of it off, and for being a BBQ burger, there was very little BBQ sauce to be found, and I had to add more, plus ketchup.\n\nThe grass fed beef was terrible compared to others Ive had, which makes me wonder if it really is, as is the aged cheddar which had very little flavor. Im pretty confident they dont even season their meat in any way, something that EVERY piece of meat should always have. The ONLY nice thing is you could tell everything was fresh, but its not enough to excuse the blandness of everything. But this place is definitely not for fans of food, especially burgers, and more of a \"hip\" place to get something to eat.\n\nFor a $12, this is probably one of the worst burgers Ive ever had, and I can say that most fast food places put out a better burger than this place. The burger looks nice, but it doesnt matter at all if its tasteless. I'll never be coming back here again unless someone else is paying for my food, because Id rather spend mine elsewhere.", "author": "Josh E."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-08-10", "description": "I'm unsure when it happened, but this much I know: after I hike, I need a burger. It's a thing now. A real thing. A real, legitimate, gotta have it thing. And so, even after I had quenched my initial post hike appetite with a donut, biscuits and gravy, a breakfast sandwich, orange juice, a pizza, and possibly some snacks, I was still intent on getting my burger. \n\nA plan was made, a route was mapped, and I was burgerbound.\n\nRoam is a counter-order affair, which I kinda like. Sometimes you want to sit down and be served, but it's nice being able to belly up to the bar for fast casual and make your order, then eat in peace. I bellied, I ordered the French and Fries, and also the Fryfecta, and also a chocolate shake. Don't judge--I'd been burning thousands and only eating hundreds of calories per day for almost a week. I needed to restore the balance.\n\nIt wasn't as tidy of an ordering process as I thought--but that's not bad. You just have decisions to make. What kind of bun, what kind of meat, how pink your meat will be; this is a custom joint. I ordered (sesame seed bun, beef, and of course, pink) and we were on our way to sit down.\n\nThe food came out pretty quickly, and I set off to work. The burger was adorned with a few truffle-parmesan fries which gave it some depth, but the real money was from the piquant sauce. I still don't know what that is entirely for them, but the basic idea behind a piquant sauce is that it's a sharp or strong flavor. This is a French burger, so why not hearken to the French cuisine and make a sauce piquant. Look it up. Piquant--having a pleasantly sharp taste or appetizing flavor. It was bright, but not overwhelming, and even though I do love fries, avocado, caramelized onions, mustard, and greens, that sauce won the day.\n\nThe Fryfecta--a platter of normal fries, sweet potato ones, and shoestring fried zucchini strands, was a good call. The shreds are just hard to eat without a fork, so don't think of them as fries. They're more a side dish for forking. But still, we dipped in ketchup and I dipped my fries into my shake, and they were salty salvation.\n\nThe real money, though, was on that chocolate shake. It's the real deal. So creamy, and the ice cream they use has a nice base. The chocolate was smooth, neither too astringent or too blonde, but a rich and easy to swallow brown and beautiful creation.\n\nOverall, my post-hike belly was tamed. Mission accomplished. At $50 for two of us, it was a little more than I usually pay, but this is not exactly a side-of-the-road ma and pop in a small town shack. I went all out, but maybe would reel it in a little bit next time to keep it more affordable. Compared to a sit-down spot, though, we came out ahead. \n\nReally solid experience with some fun twists on the menu. It was the right call!", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I adore the zesty Tejano burger with its toppings of pepper jack, jalape\u00f1o relish, avocado, tomato, white corn strips, and herb ranch. This burger is impossibly juicy, ridiculously tasty, and somehow - naturally gluten-free. And I'm not forced to eat their burgers protein-style (wrapped in lettuce) as their gluten-free buns are legitimately good. Accoutrements? Though their fries are awesome (um, hello chipotle maple seasoning), I find this burger to be very filling on its own.\n\nIf you're in an especially decadent mood, then spring for the Tahitian vanilla bean shake with brul\u00e9ed marshmallow.

For starters you choose your choice of meat: beef, turkey, veggie, etc. then you spend at least the next 5 minutes narrowing down a style. You can choose from your classic burger, sunny side, pacific blue, BBQ, and chalet, just to name a few. Now if that already hasn't grabbed your taste buds attention, you still need to select your choice of sauce and toppings!\n\nI kept it pretty simple and went with a classic cheeseburger, medium, with avocado, smoke wood bacon, and white cheddar cheese. My burger was sooo juicy and seasoned very well. I am a sucker for avocado and really enjoyed the large portion they gave me.\n\nAs a group, I came with muh peeps and we shared the fry-fecta which consists of: russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack fries. If you are with a group of people, this is the perfect item and the portion of it is big!  My group (4 people) didn't even finish half the basket of fries.  I am not a big zucchini fan but woahhhh, I really enjoyed them.\n\nAs for beverages, you have your selection of sodas, beer, wine, and of course MILKSHAKES!!! The best part about the shakes!? You can mix flavors! I highly recommend chocolate mixed with coffee!! YUM-MY!!  The shake was thick but not to the point where you had to struggle drinking it.  We all ordered larges but for the price, I was expecting a bigger cup, like an actual large.  The large has to be at least....8 oz, so I can only imagine the size of the small.\n\nBy the time I ate half of my burger, chowed down on the fry assortment, and sampled everyone's shake including my own, I was pretty full.  No worries, you can take your shake to go!\n\nSeating is limited so if you're a large party, don't be surprised if there aren't too many seating options.

The russet fries are also delicious and crispy. They have a water station and I enjoyed it. The water was a cool temperature and didn't taste like tap water. Definitely worth trying although it is a bit pricey but I've come to realize everything is here in SF.", "author": "Andrea A."}

Iv'e been coming here for years and boy oh boy things haven't changed. Fresh ingredients, free range beef, diestel turkey, and all the sauces in the world. My favorite burger here is the BBQ burger with the beef patty. Such great flavors with each and every bite. They do not chill on the BBQ sauce which how I like it, sauce is not too sweet with a bit of spice which complements the burger and the SWISS cheese. They have great sides that go well as well, I usually get the fries but when I'm with a group the fryecta is the way to go! It's has French fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini + onion strings!

As a vegetarian, I was especially interested in trying the organic veggie burger, and I'm happy to report that it did not disappoint! And for those who don't prefer meat-free alternatives, Roam also carries grass-fed beef, free-range turkey, all-natural bison, and even elk.\n\nIn addition to the five types of burgers, there are several toppings and sauces to choose from. A bunch of suggested combinations/styles are available, but you can also build your own. The menu's customizable structure ensures that there's something for everyone, which is awesome for people who have dietary restrictions, or who're otherwise really picky with their food. \n\nThe veggie burger, as I already mentioned, is fantastic. Its specific ingredients aren't disclosed, but quinoa, rather than soy protein, visibly serves as the main component. As a result, it's softer and more delicate than some other veggie burgers. The patty's striking, reddish appearance is most likely attributed to beets, although you can't taste them.\n\nRusset or sweet potato fries are sold separately, and both are crispy, flavorful, and not too greasy. A third option, which I didn't have the chance to try, is the zucchini onion haystack. Or if you're truly indecisive, you can go with the \"fry-fecta,\" a selection of all three sides.\n\nRoam's Union Street location is a little out of the way, but it's walkable if you're heading over from Ghirardelli Square (about a mile). The variety and quality of the food is enough to warrant a trip if you need a break from all of that chocolate!", "author": "Daniela L."}

While space can be a little tightly packed at times, it's certainly worth a visit, if in the area. \n\nThey claim their burger patties to be grass fed, which is reflective both the price and taste. Each burger is about nine or ten dollars, alone. Everything they put on the plate is fresh and appears to be made in-house.\n\nMy burger of choice is usually The Heritage Burger, which consists of a meat of choice---beef, bison, elk, turkey, or veggie, applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and herb mayo. When made as is, while decent, it is lacking that power pack kick-you-in-the-back-of-the-throat burst of flavor, which I felt was largely due to the herb mayo condiment on the bun. \n\nThis time around, I had the Tejano Burger. When prepared as is, the burger consists of pepper jack cheese, jalape\u00f1o relish, avocado, tomato, white corn strips, and herb ranch. I substituted the herb mayo sauce for their house sauce, which I similar to a thousand island sauce. This little substitute made a world of difference on my palate.\n\nMy advice would be to pick apart and tweak your burger to your liking. While they have done an excellent job crafting signature burgers, they are not beyond reproach. Mind you, they are not one of those eateries where the staff grows sour at the request to substitute or remove a component on the burger. They offer a variety of patties and toppings to create signature burgers of your own.", "author": "Nadir G."}

I  have previously eaten at Roam several times and thought the food was excellent. I was in San Francisco and was looking forward to another meal at Roam.\n\nI ordered a Farmers Market salad topped with three mini beef patties. The salad was some spring mix, a few radish slices, a chunk of avocado, three sunflower seeds, and a dusting of feta cheese that was so light I couldn't taste it. What happened to the salad they use to serve? The one with a lot more ingredients. The dressing on my salad was a flavorless red wine vinaigrette.\n\nWhen ordering I was given two options for how I wanted the beef cooked. Pink or not pink. I chose pink. What I got was not pink. It was medium well on the outside, medium on the inside, dry and juiceless.\n\nAfter my food was served I was ignored. No one asked how my meal was. When I finished there was only one other customer dining. The place was empty.\n\nThe last time I ate at Roam was several years ago and the food was excellent. I recall the mini burger patties being larger.\n\nEven though the salad was lousy I wouldn't have bothered to write this review if the beef had been cooked properly. How can a high end burger place serve a dry over cooked patty?\n\nA salad top with three mini patties and a bottle of root beer was over $20. I won't be returning to Roam.", "author": "John W."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-08-05", "description": "Originally at the Fillmore location, we found out that they were having computer system issues and backed up to the point that the last order was taken an hour ago. The time spent in the SF-loves-waiting-in-lines-Tumblr-worthy line and my table-snagging success were thus in vain, and we decided to try this location instead. Trying Roam Artisan Burgers indeed required Roaming.\n\nCompared to Fillmore, the parking and wait time at this location is relatively better, though it is somewhat less ambiancey. Fillmore is straight-up posh and schmexy with its tall ceilings and shadowy lighting, while walking into this location doesn't blow you away in the same way, but still has nice touches like a unique mason jar cluster lamp and modern bright red bar stools. \n\n(+) The patty: Roam's juicy, thick, and chunky grass-fed beef patty makes In-N-Out patties look anorexic. (Sorry In-N-Out fans, but this is my honest opinion) Roam also offers bison but the menu did not specify that it costs $3 extra. I recommended bison to the boo and he couldn't even tell the difference.... boooo. Probably not worth the extra $3, though it's not a complete rip-off because I've tried bison before and confirmed it's not beef in disguise. \n\n(++) Chalet, $10 (Swiss, cremini mushrooms, watercress, tomato, house sauce): Mmm tastes classic. Swiss and cremini mushrooms pair well, and watercress adds a refreshing and peppery dimension.\n\n(++) Sunny Side, $10 (organic free-range egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, greens, tomato, sweet chili sauce): Pretty good, tastes like brunch food with the exploding runny egg. I highly recommend eating this deconstructed with a fork and knife unless you don't mind egg yolk gone rogue.\n\n(++) Heritage, $10 (applewood smoked bacon, fontina, butter lettuce, tomato, caramelized onions, herb mayo): Accentuates the caramelized onions, which are done very well here.\n\n(+/-) The Fry-Fecta, $6.75 (sampler of Russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack) Looks amazing in pictures, but it was just alright. Maybe it's Instagram syndrome because the presentation in the metal tin is simply beautiful. The regular fries and sweet potato fries were good but not completely out of the ordinary, and the boys didn't like the zucchini onion haystack so I had it all to myself :x To be honest it tastes mostly like fried batter since the zucchini and onion are very thin, but the texture (along with the taste of fried batter, of course) is quite addicting. I garnished my deconstructed sunny side with strings of the haystack and it looked very fancy, reminiscent of artsy Umami burgers and the like.\n\nOverall, Roam has one of the better burgers I've tried, with a reasonable but above-average $10 price tag--the satisfying dinner was worth the hilly 1-mile Roam from the Fillmore location.", "author": "Edna C."}

Now that we've settled this, artisan, I'll spare you any puns about visiting Roam and get on with it.\n\nI especially enjoy that you can eat here whether you eat meat or not. A lot of times burger places are dismal when you're not there for the meat, but you have choices here. They offer several meats (beef, turkey, bison and elk), and a variety of salads and veggie dishes that rotate seasonally. \n\nI tried both beef and bison burgers (separate trips, no shade) and was happy to receive a pretty picturesque, tasty lunch. The patties were on the slim slide, but the fresh tomato and avocado I added were added compensation. With all the merit badges for their grass fed and local options I appreciate the price point not being that high as well.\n\nThe salads look to be really nicely sized portions, and you can always tack on a skewer of meat patties with one if you're looking to get some extra protein.\n\nAtmosphere: Typical tech-lumber aesthetic, plus a short bar with a TV\n\nCrowd: Marina mix-and-match depending on the time of day\n\nTry: Tejano burger - tortilla strips, avocado, a little jalape\u00f1o and some ranch\n\nWill be back to have a milkshake!", "author": "Taylor S."}

We ordered a blue elk burger, sweet potato fries and a shake. Seating is poorly set up in my opinion. A small table that many people need to cram around. If you're only two like us, you're stuck with your knees banging into the empty chairs and other patrons running into them. Which brings me to my next rant about the chairs being so noisy. While modern, they are uncomfortable and make way too much noise, chairs aren't supposed to make that much noise. \n\nNow onto the food. I'd have to say I don't see what the hype is. Sweet potato fries are nothing special. The burger was dry (maybe it's that elk is so lean, who knows) and the blue cheese that was on it did not taste fresh. The salted Carmel milk shake, while delicious was not worth the close to $7 I paid for it. Being that we are not from San Francisco and love the culture sf has to over I was not impressed. Spending $23 on food for one person is almost a crime. There's a surcharge with this restaurant so I feel like it's a \"forced tip\". The staff seemed less than excited to be working this joint.

The shake was 100 as well; it had a good consistency and didn't feel processed or unnatural or anything. And what surprised me the most was how good the sweet potato fries were. I usually don't get sweet potato fries because I don't like them, but my girlfriend ordered them so I tried them out. And they were the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.

I'm definitely a burger girl (vs. hot dog or sandwich), and I absolutely recommend their veggie patty--red quinoa and beans! They also serve beer and various sodas/juices. I had a Boonst red ale and my friend had their ginger soda which is the most similar item to a Sprite/Sierra Mist.\n\nHow to order at Roam:\n1) Pick your patty (veggie, turkey, beef, bison, elk)\n2) Choose a burger style \n3) Drink of choice (water is serve-yourself, and so is condiments)\n\nMy friend and I split a veggie burger in their \"Tejano\" style and the most AMAZING part was their crushed tortilla chips that are stuffed inside the burger! DELICIOUS and the sauces/pepper jack cheese just brought the whole burger together. One of the best burgers I've ever had. I really wanted to try their sunny side (EGG!), french and fries (YES, with FRIES?!?!), and chalet (mushrooms)...but next time! Totally loved our santa-fe-styled \"Tejano.\"\n\nThere isn't table service, but you order at the cashier and a food runner brings your meal to your table. There's limited seating at this Roam, but there are a few small tables outside if it's sunny, and it's not entirely convenient for groups of larger than 4. However, ambiance is pretty cozy and barn-like with their soft lighting and PLENTY of bar seating. \n\nI would totally come back here to try their other styles of burgers, but everything was made fresh and so delicious! They should also get more beers on tap, but I was pretty fulfilled with my half burger and time spent here.", "author": "Jodi H."}

Lettuce, tomato, beef patty, pickle, onion, and cheese. That's about it. \n\nI mean... You don't need much to make a burger super awesome. I've been to places where I've had $20 fancy dancy gourmet burgers and I still wasn't satisfied. \n\nHere at Roam, holy moly, do they deliver. \n\nThe menu is fairly simple. You get to individualize your meal with whichever toppings you crave, or you can even go for any of their signature burgers. \n\nBurgers that I've tried:\n\nThe Classic - Probably my favorite. It has all the traditional ingredients you'd expect out of a burger. Their pickles are homemade!\n\nThe Tejano - Zesty with almost a Southwestern flare. It has avocado, white corn strips, and even some jalape\u00f1o relish. \n\nThe Veggie burger - Although the veggie patty kept falling apart, I can appreciate the fact that it was a true \"veggie patty\" made of beets and other fresh ingredients. House-made and organic too!\n\nOh and fries... Oh don't get me started! If you can't seem to choose between their russet potato fries, sweet potato fries, or their zucchini onion haystack, you gotta go for The Fry-Fecta! You get all three! \n\nAll in all, this is a great burger joint and it can please just about anyone's palate. From simple to quite extraordinary, meat lovers to vegetarians, and french fry connoisseurs, I can't possibly imagine anyone not being able to get their grub on at this place. \n\nThey even have gluten-free buns and lettuce wraps as an alternative. \n\nNext time I get a burger craving, I'll most likely come here! \n\nBesides...

It was juicy but not too oily. The bacon was perfectly cooked, not too salty or crispy, and the ratio of cheese to meat was on point. The burger was also the perfect size. Even though I like to eat a lot, I didn't feel too full afterwards, which is a good thing. Overall, the burger was probably one of the best burgers I have ever had. \n\nI also ordered a side of the truffle parmesan fries. I thought these fries were nicely done. I generally like my fries on the soggy side (I know a lot of people don't) and these were a good combination of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The truffle flavor was also not overwhelming, which generally happens with truffle. The light flavor of truffle and the drizzle of Parmesan cheese on the top made this an excellent side of fries. \n\nMy coworker recommended this place to me since he lives in the city.

I discussed with their staff extensively what my options were in regards to your menu since I have an allergy to grains and dairy. My order consisted of the Fry-Fecta (requested for the zucchini to be separated in it's own container), the BBQ burger as a lettuce wrap with bacon and mushrooms, a large vanilla shake for my daughter, and a glass of sauvignon blanc. My order roughly came out to $38 est. and I tipped $8. My total bill was $46.  I have been to your Fillmore location numerous times without any problems. Unfortunately, that was not the case here.\n \nThe Fry-Fecta came out and it was served all together. I had to send it back.  Then my burger arrived shortly after and it had cheese. So I had to send it back as well. My husband talked to the Day Manager at the time and she stated \"I'm sorry sir. I will check the kitchen to make sure your order comes out right.\" The manager went on to say that your establishment is not able to make adjustments to the orders.  She also stated that if my allergy flares up that we should go to the ER.  Their conversation continued for another 10 minutes as the manager's dismissive attitude began frustrating my husband. \n \nIn the meantime, my burger finally arrived and was still incorrect - It was missing the relish and the slaw.  Again, I had to ask for the server to make the correction.  As I continued to eat, I noticed that the burger was also missing the BBQ sauce and the mushrooms. At this time, I didn't even want to bother trying to correct their mistake.  Needless to say, it may have been worst prepared order I ever had - specially considering that I will soon have my allergic reaction and will have rashes all over my body that will stay with me for weeks.\n \nAt the end of my husband's long and frustrating conversation with the manager, she stated that she had a gift certificate if he wanted it.  At this point, would you take the gift certificate? We certainly did not.  At that point, my husband was so shocked and frustrated with the manager's dismissive attitude and the preparation of your food that we no longer want to consider going back to your restaurant.  It's quite a personal tragedy for us as food lovers since we rank your burgers near the top of our list.  In the end, the experience that I was looking forward to for my birthday did not happen (yes, we loved your burger so much that I chose to go to your restaurant for my birthday meal).  I was really disappointed. \n \nI hope this establishment has some kind of protocol when a problem like this does arises.

Then I tried the food. \nThe burger: Pacific Blue \nBlue Cheese, Watercress, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, Steak Sauce. \nFresh ingredients. Good quality meat. Onions are a bit mushy I'll have to ask for grilled instead of carmelized next time. Interesting combination of flavors they got going here. \n\nThe Fry-fecta: Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries , Zucchini Onion Haystack. The Fry-Fecta (all three). good but not great however I can definitely see putting the Zucchini fries into the burger since they are extra crispy and would compliment it well. \n\nSHAKES:\nStraus Family Creamery Shakes 12-16oz. Made with Organic Ice Cream\nI tried the seasonal Mexican chocolate and the salted caramel. Really thick and creamy but not malty. Easily the most impressive and ironically filling part of the meal. I hear good things about their homemade sodas too so I'll bookmark for a return visit. \n\nOverall: Good atmosphere and service. Pricy but definitely worth a first try and you can decide if there deserves to be a second like I did. Get the onions grilled. Don't forget to order a shake you won't regret it. Try adding zucchini fries with the burger it's different but added inside the burger I can only taste good things.", "author": "Norris T."}

I didn't have high expectations for this place, but after having eaten here last night I must say \"holy crap, that was a good burger!\" \n\nI'm a believer in these artisan burgers. The portion sizes are fair, the prices are decent, and they're delicious. I tried the popular French and Fries style with beef and I was in burger heaven. Fries in burgers are nothing new, but the fries were thick and I could actually taste the truffle. They also did not skimp out on the caramelized onions or the avocado. The other burger I tried was the Tejano. It wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but the corn strips and that herb ranch sauce were great. \n\nThe other must-try item is the Fry-Fecta side, which includes a bowl of russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack. Since the sauces for the burgers are free, they make great dipping sauces for the fries. The zucchini onion haystack goes particularly well in the burgers. They also make a number of delicious and creative milkshakes. I would argue Roam is the best place in the city for a burger - it's well worth the money for good quality.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

I wish I had just stuck to the sweet potato fries. To top that all off we tried the prickly pear soda (good but needs a strong prickly pear taste) and I had the coconut shake with toasted marshmallow on top-this was PHENOMENAL and by FAR the best shake I've had, albeit a bit expensive for the size, however, they did redeem themselves for that by making it was Strauss milk. \n\nOverall, it set us back almost $40 bucks but it's definitely up there as one of my favorite burger joints, and this is coming from someone who doesn't eat meat all that often.", "author": "Petra S."}

Far be it for me to provide any discouraging word about Roam even if they insert that ghastly word \"artisan\" in their title like it was a designer label on a cocktail dress for half-off at Loehmann's Back Room. It's taken me over a year to get over to this tony neighborhood to try it with Jamie W., and our verdict is that they serve pretty good burgers for prices under what I perceive to be the Union Street minimum price point. \n\nBased on its reputation for being leaner, the Bison was my choice of meat for the $7.99 Sunny Side which as you can guess, consists of a fried egg (organic free-range, of course), aged white cheddar appropriately melted, caramelized onions, greens, a ripe tomato slice, and a sweet chili sauce (see photo). Very juicy and flavorful and definitely less greasy than the standard beef option. Jamie chose to follow his standard In-n-Out route and went for the $6.99 Classic with cheese, butter lettuce, tomato, onions, house-made pickles, and their house sauce (see photo). \n\nHe was pleased. We shared a $2.99 side of Russet Fries, which was plenty for two. Jamie hated that they only serve Boylan sodas, a growing trend among the hipper eateries, since his heart belongs to Diet Coke. Mine does too, but I'm willing to cheat. Gee, what does that say about my character? A rather compact space considering the foot traffic, the place was especially hopping for a Saturday afternoon, but I would expect this to be a hot spot among the hipsters and baby bumper parents all week long. \n\nFOOD - 4 stars...quality burgers compare well with Super Duper and offer even more variety \nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...bit compact but comfortable enough when you snag a table \nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...automatic pilot \nTOTAL - 4 stars...good to know yet another burger option to consider", "author": "Ed U."}

It was prime dinner time and the place was packed, but the line moved quickly and we got a table with no worry.\n\nThe ambiance, lighting, and down home country-like decor was nice (self-serve water from a barrel? Super cute.)--I would know, since I had more than enough time to eye everything while I patiently waited for our food to be brought to us. I had to take breaks from screaming \"WHAT?\" at my boyf because it was so loud and therefore difficult to have a conversation, just to look at the pretty hanging lights.\n\nAnyway, my black currant kombucha was deeelicious and the fries were awesome too. I'm a sucker for fries. We split an order of the russet fries and I was definitely the one to finish them off. Reason being, my veggie burger was uninspired. (OR, I just really love fries. Mmm, yes.)\n\nSo the veggie burger was 70% bun, 15% unevenly spread tomato, lettuce, and avocado, and 15% veggie patty that crumbled apart so easily, looked like it was made with beets, and tasted like brown rice and not much else (to clarify: brown rice doesn't taste like much to begin with). If I do the math, that adds up to me being 100% uninterested in ordering the same thing again. I also asked for the jalapeno relish, which tasted like a combination of nothing mixed with the shame of their forgetfulness. So back to the yummy fries...I filled myself up so much with those fries, that I had 3/4 of my bland veggie burger for lunch today, yay? Once again, sriracha was my saving grace.\n\nI much prefer Umami burger, but would come here again for the kombucha, the (you guessed it!) fries, and to try a meaty burger to see if it's worth it. For the record, I do love the company ethics regarding animals yadda yadda and all that. I'd support this place and come again.", "author": "Michele P."}

On Sunday, 5.8.11, my friend and I came to RAB at around 5:45 PM just before the rush. \n\nF O O D:\nI already knew I wanted the Tejano Burger but choosing a meat was another story. In attempt to be more \"healthy\", I decided to go with Elk which is very low in fat (.9% Fat).\n\n*TEJANO \"ELK\" BURGER w/ Pepper Jack, Jalape\u00f1o Relish, Avocado, Tomato, White Corn Strips & Herb Ranch ($7.99 +$1.99 for Elk): YUMMY (sans the Elk)!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6wUNarxe7sJTriiqLjZHAA?select=1W59d7yr6msmOss4lEcQzg\n\nNestled between the toasted fluffy sesame bun was the elk patty draped with the melted pepper jack cheese and topped with slices of avocado, tomatoes, corn strips and smearing of jalapeno relish and herb ranch. \n\nEverything about the burger was mouth-watering except for the MOST important part of the burger...THE PATTY. The elk was overcooked making it very dry with a crumbly texture. It was my first time having elk and it had an assertive gamey flavor which was very overwhelming. I did like the creamy, spicy, buttery rich, tangy and crunchy texture from the other accoutrements through. Had I went with the bison or beef, I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed my burger. \n\n*FRY-FECTA - Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries & Zucchini Onion Haystack ($5.49): An ALMOST Solid Combo!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6wUNarxe7sJTriiqLjZHAA?select=XByD_LY0uJAA_fDNwIiUzA\n\nThe sweet potato fries were crisp throughout with a delicate sweetness that was heightened with the sprinkle of salt. The zucchini onion haystack was my favorite as it was light and crispy with a delicate sweet oniony flavor. It was like eating the gourmet version of the canned French's Potato Stick. It would have made a great addition to my burger if I didn't already have the white corn strips for crunch. The russet potato fries on the other hand arrived room temperature and were limp and soggy. \n\n\n*SALTED CARAMEL SHAKE w/ Brul\u00e9ed Marshmallow ($4.99 + $1 Bruleed Marshmallow): The BEST Fat-Free Thing I EVER Ate!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6wUNarxe7sJTriiqLjZHAA?select=CThOu3FZ7s9JqZkQ-W314A\n\nTrying to keep my fatASSery dinner as \"healthy\" as possible, I opted my milkshake be made with Straus' Non-Fat Frozen Yogurt. Topping the thick salted caramel milkshake was the crown jewel...the bruleed marshmallow with a waffle cone tip (ok, maybe not so \"fat-free\" after all). The milkshake had a nice caramelized burnt sugar flavor with a subtle saltiness. The yogurt added a tanginess which really help lighten the milkshake. The crown jewel, the bruleed marshmallow was SOOOO EFFEN GOOD! The light torching created a perfect crackling brown crust that was crisp and the marshmallow was like eating a oooey goooey fluffy cloud of sugar. The buttery waffle cone added a nice crisp texture contrast. NO milkshake is complete without this bruleed marshmallow, so it's a MUST!\n\nS E R V I C E:\nThe cashiers were ok; neither friendly nor rude.

What can I say about this burger joint? It's simply awesome!!! You can eat Bambi (Elk)!!! J/K! but all joking aside, this place offers some tasty burgers of different meat varieties and styles that are mouthwatering and delicious!\n\nElk/Sunny-Side Style: Organic Free-Range Egg, Aged White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Greens, Tomato, Sweet Chili Sauce. This burger is delicious. Bambi tastes good!!!\n\nBison/Heritage Style: Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fontina, Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, Herb Mayo. Delicious. The bacon goes excellent with the bison. Not too gamey in my mind.\n\nTurkey/French & Fries Style: Truffle Parmesan Fries, Gruyere, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Watercress, Dijon Mustard. The mustard adds a nice contrast to the meat and adds a delicious sweetness and tang to the palette.\n\nSalt & Caramel Milkshake: not too salty and thick. It tastes like a \"light\" milkshake, if that's even possible.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta: includes Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and the Zucchini Onion Haystack. Great side to go with all those burgers!\n\nIf you're a burger enthusiast, this is one destination you have to go to. Try all the free-roaming meats. This is not like any other typical burger joint.

For what you're getting, it's totally worth it.\n\nI was really debating between the bison and the elk and funny enough, I can't even picture what an elk looks like let alone did I know they were even edible.  It's like eating moose.  But then I found out people eat that too... may be more appropriate for a state where people eat lots of hunted meat, like Colorado.\n\nSo I get it with the sunny side egg, aged white cheddar, caramelized onions, tomato, and sweet chili sauce.  I was a fan of the egg because it was cooked perfectly, to the point where it just dripped all over my hands.  I bet there is technique to eating this and I will conquer it someday.\n\nBut next to the egg, all I could taste was the sweet chili sauce.   I had to look up what else was in the bigger because visually I could see the caramelized onions and melted white cheddar but I do not remember what they tasted like at all.  That darn sweet chili sauce... it better not have been that bottled kind from Thailand.\n\nI also wasn't a fan of the bread... it was too traditional and I guess I'm spoiled by the variety and accessibility of Acme Bead.  As for the Fry-fecta (cute name btw), it was so worth it and I totally appreciated the fact that the girl at the register told me this would be enough for 4 people.  At times, people will push you to ordering more at whatever chance they get especially since this side isn't obviously huge.\n\nTo top off my fatty habits, I got a Blue Bottle shake that was nearing $6 after tax.  It looks thick but when you drink it, it's much thinner.  It's good and definitely has more coffee flavor than I expected but I'm not terribly inclined to get it again.\n\nNow I just love this part of SF.  It's so perfect for a busy work day in the city because you feel like you're really getting away.  I need that.", "author": "Shannon L."}

I ordered one of the handcrafted soda (lemon), fries and two \"The Classic\" beef burgers ($30 for all of it) with grilled onions instead of fresh onions, no pickles and tried their house sauce. The house sauce is similar to thousand island dressing. This place is a self-serve type deal too, you gotta get your napkins, ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, salt, pepper, utensils & etc yourself. They had water cups stacked neatly next to a big container of ice water that you also serve yourself. We Waited about 10-15 minutes for our food. The food was hot, the burger was juicy and flavorful. Reminded me of in & out but wayyyyyyy better quality. My only complaints are there were tons of flies in the restaurant, I'm thinking because the windows didn't have screens and they were wide open and when the man bringing our food out came to our table with our food , his face was dripping sweat and there was a drop on his chin right over my food, ready to drop  I understand it gets hot in a restaurant kitchen but maybe he needs a sweatband  but other than that, it was good.

Only one portion size available (should be enough for 2 people in most cases).  Price = $3.99.  Decent for 2 people, too expensive for one person.\nFries were worst part of experience.  Many fries cut far too thin which caused the entire meal to seem very dry.  Most restaurants offer a caramel dipping sauce but Roam doesn't.  Their dry and overly crispy sweet potato fries definitely needed something to enhance the flavor.\n\nMy guest also tried a kids size ($4.99 for 6oz I believe).

The menu here is made up of burgers, sides, shakes, sodas, beer, wine and tea. What makes Roam stand out is if you feel like being adventurous  you can swap your cow patty for other animals like turkey, bison or elk. \n\nMy buddy and I came to Roam on a Friday night and found the line pretty much out the door. Roam is the type of place where you order at the bar, take a number and find a table (if you can). Luckily for us we were able to snag a small table right by the kitchen. \n\nWe ordered;\nBBQ Burger- Beef patty, aged white cheddar, BBQ sauce, caramelized onions, jalapeno relish, oil & vinegar slaw, bacon & a fried egg\nBacon Cheeseburger- Beef patty, aged white cheddar, Swiss, bacon & steak sauce\nTruffle Parm Fries\nHomemade blackberry soda\nCoconut shake W/ a Brul\u00e9ed marshmallow\nHazelnut chocolate shake\n\nFirst off, I was bummed that they didn't ask how I wanted my patty cooked. I didn't realize it until my burger was brought out medium well. I hate medium well. The patty tasted good and had the right amount of seasoning but because it wasn't cooked to my liking I didn't love this burger. Also, my fried egg was over cooked. The yolk on the egg was hard so I didn't get the yummy golden liquid all over my patty. All of the other elements on this burg were wonderful. The slaw was tangy and fresh, the jalapeno relish was spicy and the bacon was thick and crispy. My buddies burger patty was cooked the same as mine, which didn't seem to bother him like it did me. The fries were great, as was the blackberry soda and the shakes. I LOVED the brul\u00e9ed mallow in my shake. \n\nPrices here are actually cheap. I didn't pay over $20 for my burger, fries, soda and shake.  \n\nThe folks running this place do a great job at keeping the line moving, cleaning the tables quickly so the people waiting can sit down and they also get the food made quickly. \n\nNext time I'm gonna check out either their bison or elk burger. I'll just make sure to ask specifically for my burger to be cooked medium rare. I probably would have given Roam 5 stars if it wasn't for my beef patty and fried egg being over cooked.

The patty itself is not greasy but still really flavorful, and the whole wheat bun is surprisingly soft. I love the addition of the tortilla chip strips for an extra crunch against the creamy avocado and pepperjack. They have a fry-fecta that features sweet potato fries, french fries, and zucchini fries, but I'd recommend just getting the sweet potato.

Ever.\n\nI've eaten quite a few burgers in my lifetime, but I'd have to say, this place is by far my favorite. My favorite burger is the Sunny Side Burger. Words cannot express how much I love this burger. They make a perfect medium rare burger with this over easy egg on a toasted sesame bun. All the flavors combine perfectly together that you can't help but eat it in silence with a few nods of appreciation with every bite .....order it with some truffle parmesan fries, and you have an unbeatable combination. \n\nThis places exudes such a laid back atmosphere too. It's in a residential area, so it never gets too loud and busy. I've never had any trouble finding parking, so that's an additional plus. \n\nGive this place a try. It'll be worth your while....", "author": "Laney B."}

Roam has really tasty burgers and fries. I have had the classic burger and the veggie burger. Both are tasty. The classic burger I order without pickles and well done. Burgers come medium/medium well as my coworkers have gotten some pink ones. The russet fries are too die for. The veggie burger is good - good be better. It does not hold up well. When you bite into it does kinda ooze out from each side so I ask for it a lil more cooked and I get it Chalet style. Overall I enjoy Roam.", "author": "Courtney J."}

After looking at the Roam and Umami Burger menus, we decided Roam gave us more options. The boyfriend picked the BBQ with bacon and I went with the Turkey Tejano. I liked the crispy tortilla chips against the meat and southwestern sauce. The food came out fast - almost too fast - and it would have been better if they have grilled it longer and melted the cheese more. The sweet potato fries and herb mayo were on point. The truffle Parmesan fries were ok. We finished off the meal with the salted caramel milkshake which tasted a lot more like butterscotch.

I absolutely love artisan burgers, and Roam does not disappoint.\n\nYou order the type of meat patty + the \"style\" of burger (which specifies the toppings). Roam is most popular for their bison burger, but I've had bison before, so I opted for the Elk Burger (+$1.99), Tejano style ($9.25). It came with pepper jack cheese, jalapeno relish, avocado, tomato, white corn strips (fried chips basically), and herb ranch. Elk has a slightly sweet flavor, which paired well with the spices. The toppings were also perfectly proportioned - you get the kick of flavor from the cheese, relish, and ranch, then you get a refreshing vegetable accompaniment of avocado and tomato, and finally you get a satisfying and unique crunch of corn chips.\n\nI shared the Fry-Fecta ($6.25) with my two friends and it was more than enough. They serve you a metal pot of regular fries, sweet potatoes fries, and fried zucchini strings/strips. I usually find zucchini fries too overwhelming and hot, but these are stripped like shoestring onions. Ask for the housemade ranch!\n\nRoam serves up creative burgers in a casual-yet-chic setting.

With these high expectations I walked in. The place is pretty small - not enough tables for everyone that's for sure. You order first, then sit down. \n\nI got the Sunny Side Burger - I love a good egg on a burger. I order the beef patty (maybe should have gone with something else?). It was pretty good with the arugula which kind of cut through the kind of heaviness. We also got the sweet potato fries (since those are one of my favorite type of fries). \n\nI got the blood orange soda - it was pretty good. But the winner of the night was the salted caramel milkshake. It really tastes like salted caramel. I am a sucker for that flavor. It also came with a brulee marshmallow on top which was pretty good. I honestly don't like bruleed marshmallow that much, but it seemed to be good. \n\nOverall, it's a pretty good place, but nothing super amazing.", "author": "Nina Y."}

The caramelized onions were definitely done right. It was huge too! I was so full after this burger that I don't know why I had ordered the fries! \n\nFor fries, we got the trifrecta, which comes with THREE kinds of fries. You've got the normal potato fries, sweet potato fries, and a some veggie fries. The veggie fries were good because they were so thin that when they were fried, they were super crispy.

The beef was OK; bun was a general sesame seed bun; egg was messy; and overall size was smaller than expected. \n\nMy biggest gripe is the price, although I will say, it's fair given the location. Russet fries ($2.99) with parmesan (extra $0.75) were quite good-- crispy, perfectly seasoned, mildly salty, but overpriced IMO for the small round pan. Organic ketchup seemed unnecessary (organic, really?). Drinks are rather expensive too (soda, although Boyle's, is $2.49 for a bottle).

I do like their ordering concept-- we chose our protein  and a style (similar but simpler than The Counter). \n\nWe found a table (nice long community table for socialization). The iced tea I had tasted funky (something wasn't right with it). We waited at least 10 minutes for the food and the place was empty. When our burgers and fries finally came out, everything was \"meh\" tasting. The sauce was good under the patties, but The Haystack tasted old and oily. My burger was very pink inside, closer to the raw category.\n\nThe interior was classy but dirty. We could see the kitchen floor and identified random debris everywhere. The dinning room also felt dirty.\n\n A meat delivery guy showed up with a huge box of patties trying to squeeze by our table into the kitchen. It took a couple minutes for an actual employee to direct him.\n\nThroughout the whole experience, random people walked in and out of the kitchen (most of them lacking uniforms, making it unclear if they were even associated with the place). They were discussing random personal topics which always makes me feel awkward.

But I rounded them up to four stars.\n\nThey have an easy and basic ordering system.  I placed my order at the counter, took my number on a stick, and found a table.  Like anyone obsessed with writing food reviews, I selected my seat based on best lighting for my flash deficient phone.\n\nHeritage Burger (Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fontina, Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, Herb Mayo)\n\nThis was a good burger.  I think it was even a good + burger.  I do not think it was a great burger.  The core ingredients were all of high quality.  This is what tipped the overall score to four stars.  For some reason, the burger did not come together in a way to meet the sum of its parts.  I even added some of the zucchini-onion haystack to it.   Would I eat this burger again?  Yes, definitely.  Not only that, but I would thoroughly enjoy it.  Would I go across town again to get one?  Nope, nada, wouldn't do it!   Pearl's, Gott's, and Mo's are all closer.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/8yat8k4\n\nFry-Fecta ((Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Zucchini Onion Haystack))\n\nThis was pretty good.  It would be nice if there was a smaller size for one person. I enjoyed the haystack the most.  The fries and sweet potato fries were both decent.

The chocolate did not really come through.  There was just an overwhelming sweetness.  If you know me, and you are reading this, get up off the floor.  Yes, you did just read that I said something was too sweet.  Don't worry, I am not going to be writing that something had too much bacon.  BTW - this was more of a spoon shake than a straw shake.  I do NOT consider that a negative.  (Disclaimer - I've repeatedly referred to this as a $5 shake.  To be fair it was actually a $4.99 shake.)\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7kaqxju\n\nThe ambiance is clean and functional.  I found it to be a comfortable room to enjoy a burger.  It is not warm and cozy but not quite cold and industrial either.  When I arrived, it was relatively empty.  I was surprised by this.   It did start to pick up.  Of course, it is the Marina.  So, there was the obligatory table of two guys next to me discussing how much money they make, buying condos, and commuting to Hawaii.\n\nThe service was laid back and friendly.  It was maybe a little too laid back.  The guys at the counter had a little bit of that my dad bought me a Porsche but makes me work for gas money attitude.  But hey, they were friendly enough.   The food came out in good order.\n\nOverall, this is a pretty good burger made from high quality ingredients.  It just misses that X factor of a burger that makes you go holy cow.  No pun intended.  Ok, maybe it was intended.  The side was good.   The shake overpriced.  Oops I almost forgot.  They have Boylan's soda.

(I'm a vegetarian with an egg allergy, so I only really asked about the egg content of the veggie burger.)\n\nI got the veggie burger a la French & Fries, and probably should have realized from the price of the side of fries that this did not mean that the burger came with fries on the side, but that it came with a couple of fries jammed INSIDE it. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed with this, as I don't enjoy fries inside of my burgers or wraps, but I ate it anyway (the patty would likely have not survived me attempting to fish the fries out of the burger in one piece), and it was pretty good overall if a little difficult to eat because it was falling apart. If a crumbling burger is the price for knowing there aren't any weird things in my food, though, I'll take it! I really wanted fries, too, but at that point I didn't want to go back and order just fries, so that will have to wait until next time. I did, however, get a kombucha with black currant, and that was pretty nice.\n\nLet me tell you about the bathroom, though! Darkest. Bathroom. Ever. It very seriously reminded me of the photo processing dark room from a college class, and I actually accidentally turned OFF the light when I went in there because I thought that surely it was so dim in there that the actual light was not on, but sure enough, that was all the light that was provided. There weren't any dead bulbs, either! It's baffling why they'd want the bathroom to be so very dark (I mean, it's a dark colored bathroom on top of this), and the surprising darkness made me a bit nervous even though I've never had any fear of darkness before. I half expected the shady lights to flicker and maybe a monster to come oozing out of the mirror, and this was during daylight hours! It's strange and possibly suspicious to say the least, but hey, if you've got a flashlight with you or have good dark vision, you'll be fine.\n\nThe combinations of ingredients are pretty fun-sounding (as long as I get something that doesn't come with fries jammed inside of it), and I think I am definitely down to try this place again when I'm in a better mood to begin with, as trying to find parking in the vicinity to eat here left me with a splitting headache.

The Sunny Side Burger is one of my favorites, and the other burgers you can't go wrong with. All the burgers I've tried tasted very good. My boyfriend tried his burger with the bison meat, and he said it tastes the same as beef. We also tried the Fry-Fecta fries, which is a combination of russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack. You should definitely order the Fry-Fecta fries when you're here! The best out of the three fries is the zucchini onion haystack. It kind of tasted like funyuns to me, and I love funyuns.\n\nThis is the type of restaurant where you either dine in or order to go. If you dine in, you grab your number sign and find a table to sit at and wait for one of the waiters to come find your number to serve you your food. Some nights it's hard to find tables because it's crowded. There are outside seating with heaters if you cannot find a table inside.\n\nParking may be a hassle at night since it is the Marina.

The ordering system is easy and basic, but the cashier neglected to inquire about the done-ness level I desired--a prime consideration for an \"artisanal\" burger.\n\nTiny and crispy, the Brussels sprouts with Parmigiano Reggiano and chili flakes were quite flavorful. The sweet potato fries ($3.49) were too mushy--a big disappointment. The Tejano burger ($7.99) with pepper jack cheese, jalape\u00f1o relish, avocado, tomato, white corn tortilla strips, and herb ranch was so tasteless that it required a big dollop of Heinz organic ketchup to taste of anything at all. \n\nThe dining area is clean and functional, not warm and cozy: it screams, \"Eat your over-priced burger and leave.\" The service was laid back--maybe a little too laid back--as there were no clean forks available, and it seemed to take forever for the order to arrive.\n\nRoam Artisan Burgers takes the artisan / organic / green shtick a little too far: no Diet Coke and those oh-so-flimsy, thin brown napkins that require you to use four when one of the old fashioned kind would have been sufficient.\n\nAll in all, if you are seeking a really good burger, you may want to roam to another venue: there are better burger options in SF.", "author": "CJ G."}

I ate the entire thing and as my friends commented, \"Dag, you finished your burger before even the guys\". Hey! When a burger is good it's good. No time to be a pansy and eat it all delicately with a few bites here and there, though I think I was stuffing my mouth with french fries at the same time. (My Grandmother is rolling over in her grave!)\n\nThe other burgers which looked awesome - Tejano and French & Fries (the latter actually has french fries on the burger). and then a create your own burger with the standard fixings with bacon, mushrooms and cheddar. \n\nAll washed down with their fresh Italian made sodas. The seasonal flavor when we went was \"Blood Orange\". Also tried the Carmelized Pineapple. Perfect accompaniment. \n\nGo to this place! Whether you're in the area or not. JUST GO! I was feenin' for a burger from here only the very next day. I'm already plotting when to go there again....", "author": "Kim W."}

I might've had a better meal had I picked this instead.\n- white peach shake ($4.99): their special flavor of the day. super thick. did not have the consistency of a shake; more like drinking ice cream through a straw. fresh, delicious fruity flavor, just needs to be thinned down.\n- meyer lemon artisian soda ($2.49): flavor was too light to be worth the calories.\n- russet fries ($2.49): so good! very crispy. \n\nI'm enticed by the simplicity of the ordering process (burgers either come \"pink\" or \"no pink\"), the casual atmosphere & the variety of flavors.

We arrived at 11:30, no line, easy parking, and I ordered a Classic Buffalo Burger with extra pickles and jalapeno relish. My Mom ordered the seasonal vegetables and Fri-Fecta, as all the Yelp reviews recommended. The burgers took a while, about 15 minutes and I was kind of surprised at the size. It wasn't too big, not stuffed with good vegetable or anything and overall kind of plain. The patty itself was about the size of one you get on any fast food chain, it was by no means thick and juicy, which is what I want in a burger. I also asked for a whole wheat bun and got a white one, which tasted like one you get out of a bag at the supermarket, so I tossed it off to the side. Overall, I wouldn't go back for the burgers alone.\n\nNow the Fri-Fecta is a completely different story. I hardly ever eat fried foods, and I was planning on just trying one of each fry, but that plan failed badly. I basically polished off the entire bowl. They are AMAZINGLY addictive! No one type is better than the other, but I will say that the fresh herb seasoning on the potato fries was to die for. \n\nOverall, I would only go back for the fries, but I'm not sure if a plate of fries is enough to make me go back anytime soon. It's also pretty dark inside and service wasn't too friendly. I like the concept, but sometimes I feel like these types of places are just too over-hyped.", "author": "Hayley H."}

That threw me off a bit, but my growling tummy told me to everything would be okay once I got a burger in me (and no, not of a particular antlered friend). \n\nI decided that the French and Fry ($7.99) sounded pretty tasty, and I am a french fry fiend, so I ordered it up. My friend and I decided to split it; I wasn't sure if it'd be enough, but even a few hours later, we noticed that we were still full. We'd eaten breakfast around 10, so we weren't ravished, but the fact that half a burger satisfied our appetites shows how filling and substantial it is.\n\nEverything in that burger was necessary to make it as delectable as it was. Those caramelized onions and avocados separately would usually have me running, but they added the perfect texture and flavor to offset the salty and crispy fries tucked under the bun, which had a sprinkling of sesame seeds. The patty was just right as well; not too moist or dry, and fairly thick.\n\nYou get your own water, utensils, and napkins at a small station, and the food is brought to you. Once you're done eating, you leave your plates/cups on the table and it is cleared for you (the station also includes recycling, trash, and compost sections to dispose appropriately of what you can.) \n\nIt was pretty quiet on a Monday afternoon, with only two other tables inside taken, though the exterior tables were all filled with diners enjoying the lovely weather.

They nailed it with a super tasty and healthy burger with a super fresh, whole wheat bun from Pacific Coast Bakery. My burger was juicy and very delicious. Grass fed beef has 4 times more Omega 3 than regular corn fed beef, and it also has less fat overall. So now I can enjoy a nice juicy and decadent burger and get my Omega 3's at the same time. They have two options, pink or not pink...I choose pink...\n\nNow to the Milkshake:  It was was soooo good it almost deserves it's own separate review. A thick, creamy milkshake made with organic Straus Family Creamery ice cream...I would come here just for this. I picked half Dagoba Chocolate and half Blue Bottle Coffee...needless to say I was in milkshake nirvana after a few sips...a far cry from the fake ice cream shakes everywhere else...I also opted for the bruleed marshmallow topping...what the heck, I'm in this far, might as well go all the way...it was tasty and worth the 99 cent upgrade, but next time I don't want anything between me and my luscious milkshake.\n\nI tasted my friends ginger lime homemade soda and didn't want to give it back, but I was way past my sugar limit by then, until I realized they use agave to sweeten it...still I had to be polite.\n\nThe fries were pretty good, I had the sweet potato fries, but I like Pearl 's Phat Burger's fries much better, they're thicker and more tender inside.\n\nOverall I'd say this place is going to rock. I still have to try the seasonal veggies (what a great idea), the salads, and the beer and wine, but I have to pace myself. The service was top notch and very friendly.\n\nMy only suggestions are that they size up to 1/3 pound patties, that seems to be the perfect burger size, 1/2 pound is too much and the double patty thing ruins the symmetry of the burger (unless it's a double double from IN-N-Out Burger, a juicy exception indeed) and they use Organic Grass Fed Beef...I know, splitting hairs, but if they've gone this far, why not go all the way?\n\nI can't wait to go back...", "author": "Sky B."}

After reading an article about ROAM we headed out to the Marina to give it a try and we were blown away.  The atmosphere was fun, the energy was lively, and the food was to die for. Everything tasted super fresh and was beyond fulfilling for what we were hoping to get. So we were sold.\n\nWe contacted Josh at ROAM immediately and from the first email exchange he was pleasant and accommodating. He was clear that ROAM had never hosted a rehearsal dinner before but they were excited to make ours their first ever! We worked with Josh closely in getting our 50+ guest orders in before the big day and he was a pleasure the entire journey. From the time we walked in with our guests to the few hours later when we left, everyone was in great spirits as the event was a HUGE success. \n\nROAM had a unique sign welcoming our families and friends upon entrance and they hand delivered everyone's burgers with names attached to each plate. The food was brought out piping hot (in addition we had ordered shakes and fries too that came out quickly). Everyone was blown away by how professional and fun the staff at ROAM were with our huge party on a Friday night. It was awesome! And the food...I still get requests from family and friends when they visit to take a return trip back there.\n\nIt's still our favorite place to get the best burger and shake in San Francisco (the French & Fries Burger with the Salted Caramel Shake are my favorites), not only cause the cuisine is truly mouth watering, but because they helped make our special event so memorable.

Roam certainly has nailed all three and it was just the soft opening.\n\nFirst the food, a burger is about simplicity and taste, the all American classic.  It has become a trendy entree, but in my mind the best burgers are still all about great ingredients without the fuss.   I have tried all the burgers on the menu, the beef, bison, turkey and vegetarian.  I loved all the meat, it was juicy, cooked just right, nuzzled between a whole wheat bun and absolutely creative combinations of ingredients that will surely satisfy everyone.  My favorite was the egg and grilled onion and blue cheese.  I was also blown away by the veggie option, usually I just feel sorry for the vegetarians but I will actually order this one, it had uniquely Mediterranean flavors and great texture.  \n\nThe fries were all great, regular and sweet potato, fried onions...all expertly cooked items,  a squash salad for a healthier option.  Lastly the wine, beer and homemade shakes were great.  The owner, who has lived in Japan and traveled all over the world really focuses on flavors and staying true to balance and taste of ingredients.\n\nEverything at Roam comes from local farmers and suppliers, is organically grown and the meats are free range and organic.   There is a dedication to sustainable farming and the environment which I admire and support, and believe me you will taste.  \n\nThe atmosphere is great, lots of natural woods, reds and browns that create a casually nice atmosphere that is inviting and warm.  The bar is made up of a beautifully crafted wood piece that is worth noticing.  With lots of bar seating and a community table it's a great place to come in for a quick bite or sit and hang out with a few drinks and even catch a sports game, they do have a flat-screen TV over the bar.\n\nSince this was soft opening night all I can say about the service is if what I saw was any indication of the regular days to come, they have it covered.  The service was professional and absolutely seamless, the food kept coming out, the servers were friendly, responsive and making their way through the crowed and doing so with great efficiency and ease.  \n\nThe opening party was a success and a great practice run for the food and service which was top notch and can only go up from here.  The energy level was high, food was coming all night long, drinks were being poured and everyone got a taste of a new Union St place that is surely on its way to become a neighborhood staple.", "author": "Inga W."}

Aside from being messy it was definitely super tasty and delicious. Now I really liked the burger, but I would be just as happy if you put an in and out burger in front me of me and that is why this joint does not get the elusive fifth star.

She was very nice about it too and I tried my darnedest not to look at the table like a hungry wolf. \n\nWe sat down and the food came back shortly, delivered on a plate in a paper wrapper for the burgers or in a little metal basket for the single order of fries.  The burgers are certainly a good size, and the fries are a standard size portion.  I got a heritage burger or such which was bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomato and I can't remember what else.  I scarfed that thing down though and it was a nice burger.\n\nThe menu is burgers, fries, and drinks.  There is 100% grass fed beef, bison, and two other choices I didn't really look at, I think chicken and something.   You can choose among the classic, some other options, or build your own burger.

I chose the basic burger with a lettuce wrap instead of either bread choice.  Everything about the burger was great starting with the meat being tasty and properly cooked.  The sauce, greens, and other veggies included were all a perfect match and very fresh.  On the surface this is a top eating experience that is quick for a fast meal and has enough space for a small gathering.\n\nBecause I come across as very gay how people react to me is kind of a test.  After serving me the chef told the waiter near the kitchen door that when he came out with a lettuce wrapped burger and looked up he immediately knew who had ordered.  Big laughs for all.  The faggot ordered his burger wrapped in lettuce, get it?  This is the kind of thing that other diners might miss, but it gets so tiring.  Like they couldn't have waited a couple of minutes or gone behind the little swinging door?\n\nThis is going a bit off the deep end, but arguably this attitude is endemic in this neighborhood which is not exactly the most diverse place in the whole city.  Mileage will definately vary there.\n\nAnyway, awesome top-notch burgers, but the staff may not acknowledge the value of being nice to fops so be careful eating here while blatantly gay.

I try anything once.. possibly twice ;-)\n\n\nFirst thing I thought was rather cool was the menu style. You choose your meat, then the styling of your burger, and any additional sides. I ordered the Turkey burger \"Classic Style\" and ordered Cremini Mushrooms and aged White cheddar. I also order their \"house sauce on the side\". \n\nAnother thing I thought was a plus was when I said I wanted water, they let me know there was water in the condiment area. When I went over there they had stacks of full sized pint glasses and a large barrel of water sitting in ice. It looked so refreshing and cold! I also like that they gave me a glass and didnt subject me to plastic cups as most places do. \n\nThe food came out fairly quick and the burger was amazing! I didnt feel super heavy afterwards and the flavor was delish! My friend ordered the chocolate shake and was in Heaven. Everyone seemed to really enjoy their burgers!\n\nThe only reason for 4 stars is the seating arrangement is VERY uncomfortable. In order to maximize serving capacity, there is hardly no room and too many tables. With me being almost 6 foot tall, I kept getting bumped, pushed, and I couldnt even get close to the table and had my knees all over the other people dining with me!

The menu is on the right hand wall and the chic spot offers a whole bunch of different creative burgers with a variety of meats including beef, turkey, bison, and veggie. For me, it was a tough pick between the Pacific Blue (bleu cheese burger) and the Tejano (jalapeno-infused burger) with beef. I ended up getting the Tejano, which was a nice burger with avocado, jalapeno relish, pepperjack cheese, and crispy white corn stripes (similar to fritos but not as hard). It was a very delicious burger that isn't like anything I've ever tasted before-- crunchy but not too hard and needless to say, very VERY flavorful. Definitely coming back to try the bleu cheese offering next time. You can also design your own burger which is nice but I figured I would just leave the burger-crafting up to the professionals.\n\nWe also got the Fry-Fecta which comes with the zucchini onion stack, fries, and sweet potato fries.

No complaints about the taste, great burger. It's still more expensive than I'd expect, but my only advice would be to avoid the bison and you'll have a great burger.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nLet's go over the good points first: The fries were pretty awesome.\n\nThe downsides far outweigh that, however. I paid $17 for a bison bacon cheeseburger and fries. They didn't ask how I wanted it cooked (bad sign), and for the price, I was expecting a good-sized burger. What I got was barely larger than a fast food burger, with a generic, meh-tasting bun. I like a dripping pink bison burger cooked medium, and this did not taste like bison. Frankly, the meat tasted like frozen cafeteria hamburger. It had that weird twinge you get from the frostbitten patty you forgot about in the back of your freezer. You know, the one you regretfully turn to on a night you're too lazy to get take-out and you're out of better options, like cereal.\n\nOn top of that, they charged me for the bacon part of the bacon cheeseburger, but failed to put the bacon ON the burger. That's a pretty important component of a bacon cheeseburger.\n\nUPDATE: I had reached out to Roam about my experience, and they have handled it very professionally. I'll give it another try, and update my review if it's a different story now.", "author": "Andy R."}

I have not tried their milkshakes but friends who have do rave about them.  \n\nThe place is pretty casual but I mean it's Union St so occasionally you're of course gonna see some girls dressed to the nines.  I'm not sure what an artisan burger is exactly but the name alone makes it seem a little more classy than whatever you'd find at like a Johnny Rockets.  The space is kind of small but I can't remember ever having  to wait for a table (they have a few big communal tables, which is always kind of fun) and they have outdoor seating as well, I believe with heaters.  \n\nI like a lot of the establishments on Union in theory, but sometimes the crowd gets a little too yuppie / bro / douchetastic / [fill in adjective here to describe the atmosphere we both know all too well] for my taste.  ROAM benefits from (a) being a little farther east and (b) not having become a bar in earnest.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-10-15", "description": "After finding this restaurant listed in a \"top San Francisco restaurants\" article, and reading a few Yelp reviews, I decided to check it out. I was in a major burger mood today, and I was majorly hungry.\n\nI got the beef BBQ burger. I asked for the burger to be medium; it came out somewhere between rare & medium rare. VERY pink. I prefer little to no pink in a burger. This was a big turn off for me. The BBQ sauce was so lightly flavorful, and the other flavors of this burger worked so well together, I was pleasantly surprised. But IMO unless you're at a top tier restaurant, eating raw meats is pretty unsafe. And especially meats like turkey, bison, & elk that are served here, these need to be cooked through to kill off any bugs. I try not to eat raw meat very often. Carpaccio at a good Italian restaurant is one rare exception. And I'll eat a medium-rare steak on occasion at a really good steak house. And sushi. Other than that, I try to cook everything thoroughly.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta (great name) gave me a chance to sample their different fries. I liked the sweet potato fries. The zucchini onion haystack had a very nice flavor, thinly cut spirals of fried veggies, gently crunchy on the outside, sweet & soft on the inside. The russet fries are what you're used to. The diced parsley gave a nice color & fresh taste & aroma to the whole bowl of fries.\n\nI tried the mint chocolate chip shake w/bruleed marshmallow. The shake was relatively thin (I wish it was thicker; maybe a frozen glass/mug or some cream would help?), but tasty, & the tiny chocolate bits sprinkled over the top were quite good. And the bruleed marshmallow was a great touch. A marshmallow braised over the top of a triangular cookie of some type. This worked really well with the shake. I ate that first actually.\n\nI also got an agave soda. It's effectively an italian soda. A unique flavor. It wasn't amazing, but good.\n\nThe restaurant was busy when I got there, but the waitstaff quickly worked through the line. The server quickly brought my drinks, then my food.\n\nI understand that the restaurant is using a lot of sustainable ingredients, which I'm all for, that's part of the reason I decided to try it out. And the price of each individual item seems reasonable. But it's amazing how fast you can blast through $26 in this place.\n\nThis is a good restaurant. It's not a great restaurant. I wasn't blown away. I think I was most disappointed over their glossing over how I wanted my burger cooked. If you are the type of person who would get angry & return your food over something like that, then this is not the restaurant for you.\n\nUsually I have an easier time reviewing restaurants than this. Either a restaurant is great no matter the cost, or good for the value, or bad for the value, or just straight out bad food. It's not great, and it's not bad, so I can axe out those two. I think the problem is, do I feel I got a good meal? Other than the burger not being cooked the way I wanted, yes. Do I feel I overpaid? Yes. I feel I ate a good meal, just not a $26 one. I know the value of a dollar, I know how long I have to work to earn one. I'm not wowed by what I just ate for the money I spent. I don't mind paying a lot for a great meal, I just don't think this was it.\n\nBTW, this part of SF has a lot of stores, bars, and food, and lots of people walking around. It's fun for people watching, but parking is a PITA.\n\nI'm on the fence about this place.", "author": "Adam M."}

I'd been wanting to try it out and it was worth the wait.  \n\nI ordered a custom burger:  Buffalo, cheddar, grilled onions, and house made pickles.  The burger was perfect.  Really liked the flavor of the house made pickles.  My friend had the Chalet burger, which she said was awesome.  We shared the fry fecta.  The sweet potato fries were glazed with a chipotle sauce and were the best on the plate.  The regular fries were coated with truffle/parmesan mixture, a little salty for us.

I like to get a lettuce bun, not because I do paleo (hello, fry-fecta!) but because that huge burger plus the bun is just too much food!

Thick and creamy and the flavors on each were amazing. Worth every penny. \n\nI picked up all of this to go and after driving 20 mins back to the dogpatch and another hour before I was actually able to eat the burgers, I was absolutely certain that the burgers would be a soggy, gross mess. I nuked them for 30 seconds while still in their wrapper to warm them back up. Opened up the wrapper, took my first bite and was shocked. The burger was still juicy, bun soft and not soggy, toppings still in tact and not a broken, soggy mess. The sweet potato fries were delicious, but didn't hold up too well on the drive home, which was to be expected. \n\nAbsolutely love this place.", "author": "Jen D."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-12-23", "description": "I have to admit, their burgers are delish! \n\nI stumbled upon this joint randomly while taking a day trip to San Francisco Any place with the words \"artisan\" and \"burger\" mushed together in a name is worthy of trying out at least once just to see if the place lives up to its name after all, right?\n\nUpon entering the space you immediately think this place is going to be full of hipsters because of the industrial d\u00e9cor, but, surprisingly, there was a good mix of individuals eating there... businessmen, gym-rats from the gym a few doors down, even the snooty lady with the Louis Vuitton and overly-large sunglasses was sitting in a corner spot of the restaurant. The place was a good size and the tables weren't too squished together so you had enough elbow room to really dig into your burger a-la Adam Richman Man vs. Food style.\n\nServed cafe-style, you order once you enter the restaurant and a waiter brings your food based on the corresponding number they give you once you order. I ordered the Sunny Side burger with a regular beef patty, though they do serve alternate meat options such as a Turkey, Bison, or Veggie burgers. Also, I got a blood-red orange soda and spent a little over $10- which I think is expensive since I didn't get fries- but, hey- it's suppose to be artisan right? Thankfully my friend ordered sweet potato fries so I was able to try them without shelling out even more dough.\n\nThe Sunny Side burger was ahh-maze-ing. Even the presentation of the burger was delightful- each layer stacked perfectly on top of one another- bun, grilled onions chopped up and melted together with cheese, sunny-side-up egg, tomato, topped with fresh arugula and finished with the sesame seed bun.  You could tell they were serving top quality beef because the burger patty was resilient when you bit into it and, while fatty, delicious juice dripped down from the burger, the meat was still perfectly intact and not crumbling to pieces after you took a gargantuan bite out of it (seriously, it's one of those burgers you have to practically dislocate your jaw just so you can get your mouth around it, but not complaints here!). The taste was even better than its physical appeal. Everything was fresh- not a wilted leaf or soggy tomato in any bite! You need to try it for yourself.\n\nOkay, to be clear... I loved the burger. If I lived in SF, they would have my continued business just based on the quality of their burger alone. BUT, I want to say the service wasn't that great, the blood-orange soda was almost painful to drink, and the sweet potato fries were- JUST- sweet potato fries... nothing too special about them.\n\n You know... you go into an artisan burger joint and expect to get artisan service. No, the person to took my order simply asked what I wanted and scooted me away- no smile, no personable conversation- mind you, I was the only person in line! Really? For the $10 I spent for a burger and drink in addition to the $2 tip I just gave you, you should probably be a wee bit nicer to your customers. Luckily, the bus boy who wiped down my table was friendly enough to smile. As far as the blood-orange soda, YIKES! Do NOT go there... it was almost like drinking what I believe Orange Glo cleaner would taste like- very acidic to the point where it burns going down. SMH\n\nLike I said, I would definitely go back to Roam Artisan Burgers simply for the delicious burgers; however, everything else at this joint just wasn't so great. Perhaps that's why they called it Roam Artisan Burgers instead of Roam Artisan Restaurant because everything aside from the burgers was pretty mediocre.", "author": "Emily B."}

Don't forget a side of truffle parmesan fries and to top it off with the flavored soda of the week.  \n\nI gave it only 4 stars because parking is hard to find and the place is small so try to keep your party under 5 or you'll end up having to sit at separate tables.", "author": "Elaine C."}

OMG. Again, speechless. Eggs and bison - two of my favorite things smashed together.

Just wishful thinking.\n\n* Sweet Potato Fries - super tastey, but not as special as the brussel sprouts.\n\n* Onion Haystack - delicious and much thinner slices than you'd expect. It was like eating potato/vegetable chips, which felt more like junk food than an actual side dish.

I couldn't finish it all, so I had to get a box, and it was still so damn good hours later...  \n16 oz Coconut milkshake with bruleed marshmallow: Definitely tastes like real coconut, very refreshing, great with a burger.

I hate when all the burgers or dishes pretty much taste the same, they really take the time to craft their burgers to give them distinctive tastes. \n\nyes, I finished my burger.

The toppings and bun are super tasty and artisanal, but the real treat happens to be the truffle Parmesan fries. Perfectly crisp and seasoned. The house made caramelized pineapple soda tastes like a grilled pineapple and was perfect to cut the richness of the burger. \nOverall I love the vibe and I wouldn't kick the burger out of bed for being a little too thin for my tastes, but after trying Umami down the road I'd probably make that my first stop with Roam as a close runner up.", "author": "Stacy T."}

K and I finally made it down there on a recent Thursday to try it.  \n\nRoam tries to keep its menu pretty straightforward.  Burger with beef, turkey, buffalo and you can either select your toppings or choose from their suggested combinations.  Since it was our first time there, we decided to choose from their selections.  I had a French and Fry Burger (Truffle Parmesan Fries, Gruyere, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, Watercress, Dijon Mustard) while K had a Heritage (Applewood Smoked Bacon, Fontina, Butter Lettuce, Tomato, Caramelized Onions, Herb Mayo)  The prices were very reasonable for a high end burger place in the Marina.  We also ended up with just the regular fries and a monthly special milkshake (chocolate nutella) which tasted exactly like nutella with a milkshake.\n\nWe sat down with a number and waited patiently for our burger.  We got our ketchup from the station while waiting and it was interesting that they had organic Heinz ketchup!! it tasted the same as the non-organic though.\n\nWhen the burger finally came out, it was delicious.  The balance of the fries with the mustard was great.  The burger was juicy and moist.  K was very happy with her burger too, the bacon was cooked to a perfect crisp with plenty on the burger.  The carmelized onions were sweet and yummy, and I usually don't include onions on my burger but Roam's were amazing.  I consider myself a burger lover and think burgers are great when you can't stop eating them.  You continuously down the burger without thinking because of how great it is and this is one of those burgers.\n\nThe fries were perfectly crisp and tasty too.  Overall, Roam didn't disappoint.  The place is not very big and filled up around the time we left.  Parking isn't the easiest in the world but weekdays are manageable in the Marina.  I expected the crowd to be a little snobbish but there were a lot of families there.  \n\nOverall, a great burger place for a great burger.

So when a friend of mine told me I had to try this place out, and I looked online and found out where it was located, well let's just say it took me an additional 4 months to make it over here.\n\nEverything I tried here was stellar.  The fries (spiced with fresh herbs) were fried just right and not greasy in any way.  The burgers were filling, and the ingredients were high quality and layered on the burger with finesse and skill and in a balanced ratio (I'm all about appropriate ratios when it comes to burgers and sandwiches).  My homemade ginger lime soda was fabulous.  The prices were pretty reasonable considering the location and quality of ingredients.

The are SO fresh and the meat is cooked perfectly. Perfectly juicy. This goes for the beef, turkey, and veggie burgers. The vegetables they dress the burgers with are wonderfully crisp and the house sauce is divine. Never have I ever been able to eat a burger without cheese or ketchup or a bun but at Roam, I crave my burgers this way! What I mean is, the house sauce is so good that you don't want to cover up the taste with ketchup and they have a lettuce wrap option instead of your standard bun. Normally I would stay away from a lettuce wrap because my biggest pet peeve is when food breaks, but they have figured it out! They use big pieces of butter lettuce. It stays intact. Not to mention the garden salad is my favorite in the city so far, and I love the additions of a three slider kabob you can get with it. The shakes are on a whole new level. Nutella milkshake?!

It was very efficient, and the fact that it took a little while made me believe each was cooked to order.\n\nIn addition to the burger types, they also have a variety of \"add on\" options, like my selection, Sunny Side which feature an Organic Free-Range Egg, Aged White Cheddar, Caramelized Onions, Greens, Tomato, Sweet Chili Sauce. It was pretty delicious, specifically the chili sauce and onions. The elk burger itself was good, not fantastic. I would probably pick a regular burger or bison in the future. \n\nThe other great thing here are the fries. As long as your not alone, get the Fry-Fecta which is russet fries, sweet potato fries and zucchin/onion haystack. The best were the sweet potatoes, but the other were tasty too.\n\nOverall, the food is priced fairly, with specialtiy burgers around $8 and fries 3-4, or the fry fecta for $5.50.

They are tasteless and can best be compared to construction paper.  I saw some reviews here saying people were shocked when their burgers came pink inside. They explain it to you at the counter, if you want it well all you have to do is ask. So many people write lame reviews. If your burger is too pink, send it back ands quit whining. \nAlso, the space can be tight when they're crowded and the service sloooows way down when they're packed as well. When I go in there during the week, I can get my order within 12-15 minutes. Last Saturday I went there and I waited 35-40 minutes. Just so you know.", "author": "ed A."}

Pearl's way outshines and nearby Polker's does a better job on the burger with full table service at a lower price.\n\nAfter hearing some fairly positive things about Roam, I decided to check it out for myself. Ordering was similar to most other burger joints, where you place an order and the food is brought to your table.  The menu is basic burger fare with a handful of pre-designed burgers and a build your own menu. \n\nMy first beef (pun intended) was with the upcharge for Bison -- an extra $2.99!!  Hey, Roam, it's only a 1/4 lb burger, that makes the upcharge for buffalo $12/lb.  Ridiculous. And what's up with a 1/4 lb burger -- that might be big for MickeyD's, but a sneakily undersized burger for an \"artisan\" burger joint.  \n\nMy next beef was that the patty was quite thin -- I guess it has to be to make a 1/4 lb stretch to the size of the bun -- and cooked medium to medium-well. With a burger that thin, it would be nigh on impossible to get the burger insides warm and keep it just medium-rare.  :( \n\nThe fixings on the burger were OK, but not outstanding and the burger itself (per above) really wasn't all that good. The sides were tasty (had regular fries and sampled some sweet potato fries).  The beer menu was a bit limited and no prices shown for their selection of bottled beers. Imagine my surprise when the cash register rang up $8 for a 12oz bottle of Dogfish.\n\nWith the pricey specialty beer and the excessive upcharge for bison, my jaunt to Roam took almost $25 out of my pocket, for a so so burger.  :(  Next time, I'll roam down to Pearls...", "author": "Tom Y."}

Jumped on Yelp and found this place about 4 blocks away.\n\nReally rates a solid 3 1/2 stars. Dinging 1/2 star for the bun. Doesn't support the burger very well. Had the heritage burger with elk cooked medium with just a touch of pink.. Loved it. Elk was soooooooo good. DH had their classic beef burger cooked medium rare. Said was good also but same comment about the bun. Don't want a \"bigger\" bun, maybe just toasted.Noticed later that could have ordered a whole wheat bun. Both were cooked perfectly.\n\nAlso had the Fry-Fecta which is russets, sweet potatoes and a zucchini/onion haystack. Was tasty. Liked that the fries were neither too skinny or too thick. As Goldilocks says, they were just right.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm getting used to paying a pretty penny for burgers of decent quality. Our meals without drinks was $23. Not TOO bad. The elk is a $2 add-on. Saw some salads go by that looked good. \n\nNext time I'll try their shakes. If those are good, I'll probably up the rating to 4 stars.\n\nRestaurant is small but I wouldn't consider it tiny. Has one long communal table in the middle then room to seat about 20 other people (including outside) then can seat another 8 or so at the bar. Speaking of bars, they also serve beer/wine which is cool but was so hung over, couldn't even partake.

It was actually pretty good meat - not gamey and seasoned well. The bun was nothing special - kinda reminded me of a Big Mac bun complete with the sogginess that results from too much sauce/burger juice penetration. The house sauce is tasty, though, so I guess I shouldn't complain too much.\n\nThe seasoned vegetables are a bit misleading. I think the menu says something like a mix of kale and butternut squash with pumpkin pesto.

I mentioned burgers and since they were just returning from feasting on Seafood all week long, they were ecstatic.  I did a bit of research previously and Roam popped up in the results of being a highly rated burger joint.\n\nWe loved the many meat options such as Bison, Turkey, Veggie and grass fed Beef.  Even though it isn't mentioned on-line, I remember seeing on the restaurant menu the mention of Elk for an up charge.  Two of us opted for Bison which carried an up charge of $2.99 each. \n\nI decided on the Tejano which comes with Pepper Jack, Jalape\u00f1o Relish, Avocado, Tomato, White Corn Strips, Herb Ranch.  Usually when I enjoy a burger there is a moment where despite the toppings it already has, I would dip it in some ketchup and mustard.  I just love the mixture of the two condiments and a good burger in it.  From the moment of my first bite to the savoring of the last bite I was in total bliss.  The three of us were quietly admiring the burger choices made and enjoying our spoils.  We shared a Fry-fecta which comes with a zucchini onion haystack and Russet and sweet potato fries.  The counter guy suggested a dipping sauce which lightly topped all three.  Russet and sweet potato fries were the favorite, the latter forgettable.  Total for three burgers with upgrades, a shared side, two beers and a soda was somewhere over fifty five bucks.  A little steep but the food and time spent was excellent.\n\nNice spot with woody decor.  Love the bar, I believe the bartender was stating it came from a solid piece from the trunk of a tree found in Sonoma county.  Created by a local wood worker.  \n\nThe place is popular so seating is hard to come by as the night draws on.  You order food at the counter and receive a number to place at your table.  Most tables suit fours and the center of the space is filled with a large communal table which could suit a party of up to twelve.  I would suggest not sending folks ahead and saving tables as most do not do that and it'd be frowned upon.  Also if you are a parent, it is obnoxious to bring double wide strollers in here.  Saw this drunken father trying to push a stroller with baby in hand between the bar and communal table without maneuvering seated folks.  It made for an ugly situation.  Since the place is uber popular, the weeknight drew in some sexy in the city types.  If I was a local, I'd probably swing with a wing-man and stop in for a bite and beer often.\n\nIf you love burgers, you'd better bookmark it.", "author": "Jacob J."}

Maybe I'm just a pig... but if I wasn't sharing, I would have gotten a fork and just devoured the whole thing! I also got a blue-bottle coffee shake and that was delicious.

We don't get out that often with the whole family and when we get to a place that takes good care of us, we camp out and order lots of food and drinks (Did I not mention Racer 5 and Anchor on tap?  How can latchkey parents not love that?!) And we leave early, so everybody (eventually) wins.\n\nWe'll definitely be back when we're in the neighborhood.

Offer sweet potato fries on the side, and I think I've found my soulmate.\n\nAs a vegetarian, I'm stuck with the veggie burger (and the salads, I suppose, but I'm not a big salad fan--imagine that), but there are enough topping choices that I feel like I'm getting something new each time.  I always appreciate one that's made in-house, and not something you can grab in a freezer case at your local supermarket (gardenburger, anyone?).  It's more crumbly than I'd like--though, I know that it's common with these types of grain burgers.  The reviewer who mentioned it as being quinoa-like in texture was spot on.  It also has a mexican flavoring to it.  Bottom line:  it's definitely not bland.\n\nOthers I've taken here enjoy the bison and the beef.  I've heard raves on the turkey, so I doubt you could go wrong with any of the meats.\n\nAs far as beverages, they could not have picked a better creamery to create their shakes with than the local Straus.  The dairy is thick and delicious, with a variety of flavors to satisfy anyone's palette.  The marshmallow brulee and graham cracker topping is a great addition.  I've curbed my soda intake, but I'm curious to try their agave sweetened artisan sodas.  The Mothership wheat beer turned out to be a light and refreshing treat after a run.\n\nThe space is modern, with a custom wood interior to include panels and tables (one, being communal).  Outdoor seating makes for great people watching, botox and BMWs cruising down Union.  Sometimes it's just fun to sit at the bar, especially when a Giants game is on. \n\nI seemed to have been making a once-a-week pilgrimage to Roam since they've opened, and short of an empty pocketbook, I don't see any reason not to continue to do so.  For such high quality food, prices are more than reasonable.  The staff are friendly and patient, handling the influx of customers seemingly well.  The owners are receptive to any problems/issues.  Custom orders may make for easier screw-ups, but they do what's necessary to make it right.\n\nNot even a month old, they've got their kinks to work out as every new business does.

Light tasty meat, but my medium rare burger came medium.  Maybe I should ask for it bloody next time.  \n\n#2 Yummy sweet potato fries that don't taste like they are out of a bag (sorry Burgermeister)\n\n#3 Salted caramel Strauss Family Creamery milk shakes.  Yum.  I made the mistake of making my first one with frozen yogurt.  Not a good combination.  Second was made with soft serve ice cream....perfection in a cup.\n\n#4 Atmosphere.  I really like the space.  A chandelier made of various size Strauss Bottles with Edison lightbulbs , makes the DIY'er in me drool. I am usually there during the day, so I cannot say anything about the crowd that eats there.\n\nMinuses:\n\n#1  The Straws.   Why would anyone serve you a shake with a straw that is a little thicker than a coffee stirrer?  I should not have to turn red and make fish faces to sip my shake.  Really Roam, get new straws; there are plenty of compostable straws that are normal size.\n\n#2  Price.   When you look at the menu, it seems fairly priced and then you start adding toppings.  Before you know it, lunch for one is 23 bucks.  FYI the menu online says the bison burger is only 99 cents more...in restaurant it is 1.99 dollars more.  They need to update their online menu, intentionally or not, it is false advertising.\n\n#3 Staff.  A mixed bag of peeps.  Most are  well seasoned servers/counter peeps; attentive, computer literate, fast and polite .  I got the brush off by one woman on my second visit and the \"look\" while I made her stop counting her tips to take my order.

The sweet potato fries were amazing, but I personally really loved the Russet fries with Chipotle Maple -- do this!!!!", "author": "Shruti N."}

I saw organic this and grass-fed that along with an extensive list of burger customizations that got me so excited I felt as if the menu was fluffing me up to prepare for a porn shoot.\n\nI ended up choosing the grass-fed beef burger with just white cheddar and house sauce since I'm one of those cake-eating veggie haters. My boyfriend had a bison burger with an added fried egg - also without veggies. Our shared nutrient deficiencies is one of the main reasons why we work. We both loved our burgers and raved about the seemingly simple but incredible sesame seed bun. \n\nWe split the fry-fecta which, in addition to being a solid pun, is a delicious trio comprised of russet, sweet potato and zucchini/onion haystack. Also had a strawberry shake with a br\u00fbl\u00e9ed marshmallow on top that is absolutely out of this world. So much so that it makes a $4.99 combination of ice cream and milk seem completely reasonable. \n\nThe only reason this place doesn't get 5 stars is because, like most others have commented, they have two major problems - can't seem to properly cook a burger according to their 'pink or no pink' guidelines and have a hard time getting orders right. \n\nBoth of our burgers came out with veggies haughtily spread out over the patties. I sent mine back and, not surprisingly, it came back seconds later after everything had been scraped off. Not a huge deal but still a little irksome.The huge offense though - both of our 'no pink' patties were nearly raw in the middle. It was a little too dark to notice and I was a little too hungry to care but I'd be concerned to go there in the future and trust that my meat was cooked properly.\n\nBut the bottom line is that Roam has immense potential. My boyfriend and I talked to the owner, Josh, about these issues before leaving and he was completely receptive and appreciative of the feedback. I probably would've gone back anyway, but I feel much more confident about their ability to iron out the wrinkles knowing that there's at least one person there who really cares about the quality of the food.", "author": "Aubrey O."}

I like to eat local, I like burgers, and I like fresh ingredients.  What I don't like is screw ups, and even though they tried to correct them, it was done in a way that makes me not want to come back.  \n\n/Begin rant\n\nHere's the deal.  I came here on Tuesday and last Sunday.  My girlfriend and I can be slightly complicated when it comes to ordering.   However, the most difficult that we are is saying no bun.  We don't eat bread so we prefer it protein style.  \n\nThis is a burger place, there are toppings that you add to your burger. however of the four burgers I have ordered here every single one has had a mistake.  \n\nTwice I have ordered the burger with egg.  The first time it didn't come with the sauce, or the saut\u00e9ed onions.  Second time it came with just no saut\u00e9ed onions.  This is straight off of their ingredients except for the fact that I didn't want a bun.  \n\nMy girlfriend ordered the regular burger (sans bun), adding avocado, sauteed onions, pickles and asking for no tomatoes.  The first time, no avocado and no pickles.  Second time their were tomatoes, no avocado and no pickles.  It took them coming out with the burger three times before they got it right.  \n\nThey then gave us a dessert for free, even though we don't eat bread or sweets.  \n\nI understand that their are growing pains, however if you really wanted to keep my business you should have offered to pay for the meal or give me some kind of gift card, or something.  A free dessert (something that we wouldn't eat anyway) just doesn't cover it.  \n\nThe worst part is the food is great!  I want to eat there!  But I can't when the service is that bad. \n\nLastly, it took nearly 30 minutes for the burger to come out on our second time there.  It was 3pm on a Sunday.  I can't understand why it would take that long no matter how busy they are.  I could've killed the cow myself and cooked the burger in a shorter amount of time.  \n\n/end rant", "author": "Nick H."}

I love that you can pick your patty, so even when I order the same style over and over again, it's a different meal every time. \n\nThe beef is by far my favorite, though. I make a special trip to Roam on those 'I need red meat' days.  It is 100% Grass-Fed, and - being from the midwest - I can tell a quality burger. This is it.

It was reasonably quick, and we were able to find seats at the bar right after ordering.\n\nThe milkshake was awesome.  Kinda small, but just the right size for what it was.  Burger was also quite tasty, didn't blow my mind but was pretty good.  My accompaniment enjoyed the mini 'veggie burger' topped salad, which definitely fell short.  The veggie burgers seemed more like scoops of quinoa salad, whats up with that?  Also got the fry-fecta!  Great name.  Poor execution.  Sweet potato fries were good, normal fries were meh, zucchini sticks or whatever else were included were weak.  They are shaved too thin, and seemed to have too much batter.  \n\nBut this place really did have great attention to detail and I really like what they are trying to do.  From how they sweeten their drinks to their dedication to 'humanely' raised animals and organic dairy.  Thumbs up.

I had to add Gruyere cheese which was $1 more. Who passes on cheese, let alone Gruyere??? EB had the \"Chalet\" with beef. The patty was juicy and flavorful.

They also work with some interesting animals, like bison, elk, and ostrich.\nBUT if you're not a huge meat eater like me or a vegetarian, you definitely won't be missing out by getting the veggie burger. I was a little skeptical when I saw pictures on yelp that showed a red-colored veggie burger. I couldn't see how that could possibly be appetizing, but when I got it, I was blown away. I STILL have no idea what was in it, but they made it taste unusually like meat. It's like getting a meat patty without the added grease and guilt. \nALSO, I tried some of the mint chip shake, and it was delicious.

So- last Friday afternoon, I met him at his work and we headed to Roam in Cow Hollow.\n\nWe got there at noon and there was no line whatsoever.  I ordered the French and Fries (beef) and he ordered the Classic (Bison).  Both burgers were terrific!  They're just the right size and you can tell that each ingredient is carefully selected and fresh.  He described it best when he said - \"it's a gourmet burger that actually feels good for you\".  You're not stuffed after eating a whole burger, but you're delightfully full.\n\nTheir zucchini straws are the best of the three fry option (we shared the fry-fecta) - although all three are very good....it's just that you can get a good potato fry or sweet potato fry anywhere.  \n\nI had the house-made Meyer Lemon soda and it was a perfect lemonade-type companion to my burger and fries.  \n\nBy the time we finished our burgers, the line was out the door - so fair warning - come at 1pm and you will be waiting awhile.\n\nWe even waited in the line to get a shake!  Albeit, I did get the non-fat frozen yogurt (salted caramel) shake - but it was still awesome!  They caramelize a house-made marshmallow and float it on top of the shake on a mini-(house made) graham cracker.\n\nSeriously, they're painstakingly paying attention to detail here.  Every single item in this restaurant considers the environment impact - they have their own wine (organic, sustainable I'm sure) on tap - since kegs of wine have a lower impact than individual bottles!  That's attention to detail in my book!\n\nIt seems like they just opened so they're working out the kinks...but if you want to get a seriously delicious burger that you won't  feel bad about eating when you're done - go to Roam!  Just go by noon/12:30 or after 2 on a weekday to avoid the rush ;-)", "author": "Heather L."}

I could probably have any of their choices and be happy before I had to make my own. My first was a BBQ turkey burger, and it was so much juicier and flavorful than expected.\n\nI'm not a fries eater, but the regular, sweet potato, and zucchini strings all looked delish, and the veg special, a roasted butternut squash with kale and pesto was a great addition.\n\nRoam is casual and inexpensive, and was packed even on a Thursday evening at 9 PM. We had some trouble finding a table and ended up putting five around a mini two-seater, but it is what it is.  \n\nI was impressed with how fast the burgers and food order came out, despite a full house. The servers also regularly stopped by to clean off dirty plates and such.\n\nThe immediate experience was a 5-star but after discussing with dinnermates, there is room for improvement like with condiment selection and seating so giving a four today.\n\nBurger plus veggie special $13 (I think burger by itself around $7-8)", "author": "Aki N."}

The food is amazing!\n\nI've been here 3 times now and the first 2 times were good.  I tried the veggie burger tajano style... wow!  I was surprised by the veggie patty, expecting something that resembled more of a beef hamburger, I got something beet red and really seedy. Different, but in a good way.   It was amazing.\n\nI changed it up the second time and got some kind of french fry burger.  It was pretty good and stuffed with spinach.  Once again unexpected but definitely in a good way.\n\nThe third time I went in here I was pleased to see there was only myself and a couple in the restaurant.  The first 2 times it was packed and I had to fight for a table and service was a little slow... good but slow.  The bus boys were really on top of their jobs.\n\nThe girl working the register was actually texting on her phone.  Yea... I go on my phone at work but not obvious and in front of customers.  Whatever.  But the thing that pissed me off is I stood right in front of her for at least 20 seconds while she ignored me and sat on her phone.  Not even joking.  Then when she finally looked up and acknowledged me (meanwhile with a total stinkface... which I've learned to brush off lately as I get it ALL the time in the Marina... ALL the time.  Get over yourselves.. you're not that great) and with a slightly \"holier than thou\" tone to her voice asking if I was ready to order... stopped herself mid sentence... then informed me \"actually... he's going to ring you up\" and mumbled something about her boss texting her and walked away.\nSo her coworker sees me standing at the register awkwardly and asks if I've been helped yet.  I inform him I haven't and he actually gives his brainless coworker an awkward \"why the hell aren't you doing your job\" look while she walks out of sight.\n\nVery nice, he helps me out and puts in my order.  Meanwhile this girl who came back into sight is just standing around not really doing anything.  I sit down and wait for my delish burger.  Meanwhile she's finally doing something and making my milkshake.  She walks it over to my table and I look up from my phone to thank her and before I can even get the second syllable out, never even stopping to put my shake on the table, she slightly throws it at me, and continues to keep walking, and only acknowledges my gratitude with a snarky half smile.  \n\nWhat a _____!\n\nThey need to fire this girl.  For realz.  I witnessed her make a total ass of herself the rest of my unpleasant stay by flirting with her coworker in a pathetic and desperate manner, goof around unprofessionally, and make herself sound like a complete idiot.  I honestly could not tell by the way she was talking if it was a joke or not.  She was talking like valley girl that for a second I thought she really was joking and doing it on purpose... but then I wasn't so sure.\n\nAnd what amazed me was while she continued to text on her phone and other girls walked in, she put the phone down right away to help them.  I'm not trying to say she was hating on me... but it really seemed that way.  And keeping your guests guessing and even making them feel uncomfortable and unwanted (even if that was never the intention) is NOT a quality you want your restaurant to have.\n\n\n\nI work off tips.  And I'm a big tipper because of it.  And people really underestimate me.  I'm not trying to have a Pretty Woman moment here...\n\nBut I'm sick of SOME people in this area who think they are better than everyone else, and this girl personified this.  (and I know not everyone is... it's hard for me to stereotype because there are awesome people who live out here and I meet nice cool people here everyday... but when people like THIS GIRL are around, it's really unfair that they have to uphold the negative reputation)\n\nI am definitely going back because the food was pretty good and the service the other times have been decent, and that Mexican chocolate shake was like... WHOA!!!!\n\nBut I hope businesses check their yelps so they can see where they need to improve.  I know for a fact reviews can help or hurt a business.  So by putting this review up I am hoping they take care of the problem...\n\n\n\n\nOr at the very least... this brat checkity-check herself before she wrecks herself.\n\nKeeping it hood, even in the Marina", "author": "Kelly N."}

We San Franciscans are starting to buckle under the weight of leading the California food revolution (sorry LA) and are losing our patience.  Truffled mac and cheese, small plates, tapas, crudo, raw, cooked, parboiled, artisan cocktails, artisan cocktails, artisan pickles, organic, farm fresh, local, big named chefs, husband and wife teams - we've supported all of your wacky trends and now just want a decent plate of food for under $20.  Is that too much to ask?  \n\nSo, here is the trick: just do one thing and do it well; grilled cheese sandwiches, cupcakes, burgers, who cares, but stick to your guns.  It's ok, have some faith, we'll like it.  Have a nice staff that realizes it is there for us, and not the other way around.  Don't gouge us on price.  Don't have some crazy ass ordering system that requires us to wait in more than one line to get, or pay for, our food.  And, for the love of all that is good and holy, get some noise control.\n\nBecause, here is the thing: if you follow these easy pointers, girls like me, who are often accused of being overly critical (ahem), will still give you three stars even if your food is mediocre.  For instance, the bbq burger can have flavors that kind of run together (fully caramelizing the onions would be great); the veggie patty can completely fall apart and be a bit bland; and the fries can be a bit cold.   Stick to your guns, though, and add lots of extras: house made sodas, delicious shakes, beer and wine on tap, nice people, and you'll be just fine.  \n\nxoxo, the City by the Bay", "author": "Pammy C."}

The burgers here are good, but very small.  They have to be something like 6 oz.  My girlfriend told me that even she could eat 2 of them!  They have a great selection of meats, from buffalo and beef to turkey and venison, all super lean.  I asked what the mix was of the beef, and they said it was 90/10 which is incredibly lean.  You don't get the juicy beef taste with these burgers but you also don't get that sick feeling after eating greasy food.  It's a trade off. The patties are also VERY thin, which doesn't help in delivering the beefiness either.\n\nWe also got the Fryfecta.  The sweet potato fries were great.  The onion things weren't very substantial, and I think it was more breading than onion. They would have been good on top of a salad. The regular fries weren't too crispy, similar to In n Out fries.  \n\nWe ordered shakes too, and these blew us away.  We got the salted caramel shake and the dagoba chocolate shake.  Both were phenomenal, though very small portions.  All in all, regarding the portions, given the price, the portion size is reasonable.    \n\nService was great.  You order at the counter and they give you a number.  They bussed our table quickly too.

Me and a lot of friends in the neighborhood were excited about this place opening on Union. Here are the deets...\n\nRoam is a build your burger place, meaning, they number out your order, 1 -what kind of patty, choices beef, turkey, buffalo, etc.;  2 -style of burger, Classic, BBQ, French Fries, etc.; and 3- bun, white, wheat. Its kind of cool that they have all the different of choices. \n\nFirst note, none of the burgers come with sides, so after ordering our burgers, Turkey, Classic on white and Buffalo, French Fries on wheat we each ordered sweet potato fries. \n\nFor their fries they have different seasonings that can be added for an additional 50 cents. I ordered the maple sugar on my sweet potato fries. \n\nTotal $22.\n\nWas it worth it...i guess. When the food came out  it was awkward looking with a normal sized burger on an average-sized dinner plate and our fries neatly placed in a small paper concession container you might see used to serve tater tots at a minor league baseball game. Those two items took up less than 2/3rds of the plates with the other plus third empty...Maybe its the American in me, but i dont like empty space on my plate until i'm finished eating. \n\nThe burgers were very yummy. Each patty was similar in size not large enough to create the juicy burger affect, but enough to know youre eating a burger.  My the buffalo burger french fry style was very flavorful. I thought seasoning worked and happy i picked it. My friends turkey burger Classic was surprisingly good. The turkey meat was seasoned well. The sweet potato fries were blah given the cost. I can't believe they charged 50 cents for the maple on the fries, completely a McDonalds-like upsell. \n\nAnyway, its a new place and with all of the combinations i definitely will be going back.", "author": "Jason J."}

Every time I've had bison in other places, it was always too dry and a bit of a let down ... but I just ordered it as the healthy alternative. Roam let me have the best of both worlds!\n\nMy girlfriend ... excuse me, my wife! ... swears by the Farmer's Market Salad with turkey burger mini patties in the salad. Now that the wedding has passed, I'm looking forward to hitting up Roam again to try all the various burgers and perhaps even one of those amazing looking shakes.\n\nTo top things off, I had an incident recently where I called in an order for take-out and my order ended up not getting in the system amidst a busy rush. When I went to pick it up, the owner was sitting at the bar and overheard the situation as they apologized and said they would make my order right away. The owner stepped in, comped my order, got the order rushed in the back (he even went back to check on it directly), and chatted me up for a bit while I waited and was a super cool guy.

The portions are just perfect for lunch, though could be a little small for dinner.  \n\nMy main complaint, which isn't new, is the painfully slow ordering process.  I don't understand how it can possibly take so long to process orders.  Not only is the long wait annoying, but you only need to be about 6th in line to be forced to wait in the doorway or outside.  Fortunately, service is pretty quick once you place your order.\n\nBig thumb's up for Roam!", "author": "Mitchel H."}

I ordered the sweet potato fries with some seasoning on them, but found that they probably had a sprinkling of flavor (if that) on them.  Seriously?

I'd heard friends talking about this place at a party and so we decided to give it a try.  \n\nPlace was much cooler than I'd expected - great, mellow, but tasteful decor - sort of industrial log cabin with a big natural wood bar, as well as a cool communal table in the middle for multiple (or larger) parties to share.  \n\nMenu had lots of interesting choices.  I tend toward vegetarian and saw that their veggie burger was made in home - a nice change from the standard Boca or Gardenburgers most people stash in their freezer and deep fry.\n\nEveryone said their burger was delicious - mine included.  Had the \"french and frie\" (?) style - truffle french fries (on the burger!), gruyere, arugula and dijon...gooood stuff.  \n\nFrench fries - of which we got two orders of the mixed (ie: 3 different types of fries in one order) - were good, but not out of this world.  Sweet potato (seasoned w/ chipotle maple), regular (seasoned w/ truffle parmesan) and then sort of shoestring zucchini and onion (? can't fully remember).  Seasonings cost an addt'l .50, which felt a little steeper than necessary, but given the quality of the food (I think everything was organic, etc), the number of choices and the location, it was still very reasonable and we all left happy, full, and with a new go-to spot for dinner (and lunch).\n\nP.S.

You can build your own burgers and the fries and milkshakes are the best! I'm a veggie so I chose the grilled cheese with sweet potato fries.  The grilled cheese was cooked on a regular bun with a white cheese that was perfectly melted.  Delish! My boyfriend had the classic cheeseburger and he loved it.  It was a pretty big cheeseburger (they use high quality ingredients, which is always a plus).\n\nThe wait wasn't too long for the food considering the place was pretty busy.  I thought it would be hard to find a table, but we ended up snatching a couple seats on the long communal table.  The atmosphere is perfect if you just want a chill dinner or lunch...basic Marina crowd.  If you go, don't forget to check out the milkshakes.  By far the best milkshake I have ever had.  We had the pomegranate blueberry and it was the perfect consistency for a milkshake. The house-made sodas are also pretty good, not too sweet (and I never drink soda).  We had the ginger soda and the lime one, pretty interesting, but the taste is refreshing.\n\nThe prices are just right too, it was about $25 dollars for the bf and I.

The menu is full of interesting and delicious-sounding burgers. We finally got the chance to try it and I'm pretty disappointed. Really, this is a 2.5 star review. 3 for the food, 2 for the service. \n\nWhen we ordered, I was told I could either have \"pink in the middle\" or \"not pink in the middle\". Apparently \"pink in the middle\" equates to medium rare and when I asked if I could have it medium she said, \"well, we can try but when it's busy we either do it pink or not pink.\" Um, okay, for a burger place, that's kind of ridiculous. It took FOREVER to get our food - about 15 minutes for our drinks and probably 30 minutes in total for our food which would have ordinarily been probably not a huge deal but it wasn't very busy. \n\nAs for the food, I'd give it a 3 overall. My fiance's burger (he ordered the French and Fries) was actually pretty tasty. However, he asked for pink in the middle and it was definitely cooked all the way through. I ordered the BBQ burger but there was hardly any coleslaw (just about a tablespoon) and the bun had the tiniest smear of BBQ sauce which you couldn't even taste when you ate it - I had to ask for extra. Additionally, my burger wasn't even close to being medium. It was very, very, very medium rare (closer to the rare side with a good sear on each side). You could tell that the burger and all the fixings were high quality and a lot of it tasted good, the proportions were just totally off and it was improperly cooked. \n\nOverall, it wasn't a great experience. I don't think that I would return on my own accord, but if someone suggested it and really wanted to go, I don't think I would protest horribly.", "author": "Jess B."}

My friend's burger was also cooked just right, juicy and delectable, and the accompanying salad perfect as well. And I have yet to indulge in the Straus Family Creamery organic shakes (with frozen yogurt as a guilt-free option) boasting such tantalizing flavors as the oh-so-SF salted caramel, Dagoba Chocolate and Blue Bottle Coffee ...I think this is definitely where the \"artisan\" part starts to come in...\n\nThe problems? \n\n* Loud -  feels like a high school cafeteria, to the point where the glass of wine with dinner feels a bit incongruous.\n\n* Small portions - sacre bleu, that is prob the coup de grace preventing the 4th star from happening. Someone who goes to a burger place by definition is not a demure eater - isn't that a safe assumption?

They don't even taste like onion and zucchini, really. \n\nSide salad was really good as well. It's just a bunch of greens and a vinaigrette but I really enjoyed having a little something fresh on the side to tone down the burger and fries. Not to mention the greens tasted like they'd just pulled them out of the ground. \n\nI also tried one of their sodas. Which they make themselves or something. I would skip the lemonade one. It's not lemonade, but it's some kind of lemon flavor. Which you can barely taste. I suppose if you'd like a fizzy drink with a hint of lemon, that would be something for you to try, but I felt like it was a bit of a waste. \n\nLastly, their shakes. I got the chocolate shake with the marshmallow and damn. That shake was delicious. And I'm not a shake person. The marshmallow is way overpriced but you need to try it. It's a sweet treat. \n\nService was pretty good. Price is the only issue... Two burgers, fry-fecta, side salad, soda, and a shake = ~$50.

We went on a sunday afternoon, there wasn't much of a line and we even scored a table facing the TV, they only have one, but still it worked out well since the football game was on.\n\nI ordered the heritage, minus the mayo and instead with dijon. It was great, the onions, thick bacon, cheese, all tasted good. The roll was pretty good, definitely softened up with the juicy burger, but still held it's shape. My husband got a regular cheeseburger. We both enjoyed them well enough, but don't think they'd take the slot of the city's best burger. We got a side of fries and liked the parsley on them, but they weren't that great. I'd prefer slightly thinner, but overall, I think it was that they weren't quite cooked enough, or they had been sitting long enough that they were still warm, but not piping hot and crispy. I did get a chocolate shake which was very good.\n\nOverall, a solid burger spot, but not our favorite.", "author": "Lauren M."}

Sometimes finding seating can be a little hairy, but burger joints generally allow for fast turnover.  Their selection of meats is great, from \"regular\" grass-fed beef to turkey to veggie, but they also feature bison and elk.  Then you get to choose from a plethora of toppings, including fried egg!  I had the truffle burger the first time, which unfortunately is so inundated with truffle oil that I could've been eating cardboard and it would've still been delicious.  The second time I came, I had the classic bison burger, which is now among my favorite burgers of all time, juicy and great meaty flavor without as much fat.  Be warned, these burgers tend to fall apart on you, as the sesame seed bun cannot contain the combo of juicy meat and sometimes slightly damp produce toppings.  The sweet potato fries offer a mixture of crisped outside and soft sweet inside to just crispy bits, kind of like what happens when you get to the bottom of a carton of McDonald's fries (I find this to be a good thing).  The truffle parmesan over their regular fries is a great combo, not overwhelming like the burger.  The zucchini onion haystack really needs to be eaten with a fork and is the least memorable of the 3.  The artisan sodas are also delicious, and I look forward to trying the elk and milkshakes next time.", "author": "Gene C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-03-20", "description": "If I'm going to have a burger, it sort of has to be a great burger.  It's a special occasion and one that I approach with reverence as well as ritual.  Last night was one of those nights.  \nHats off to Roam for seemingly applying the same principles toward making a burger as I do toward eating one.  I wasn't sure exactly how/where to start and the menu doesn't clearly specify how things work but I got an orientation from one of the friendly busers (is that a word?) and he was most helpful, as was the guy who had just enjoyed the Bison Tejano and couldn't recommend it more highly.  The buser agreed it would be a good choice so I dove in on faith and was not disappointed.  \nHere are what I consider the highlights to this experience: \n\n1.  The burger was a civilized size.  I was a little worried that I'd get some gigantic thing I couldn't wrap my mouth around but no ... it was a perfect size making it easy to  get a proper bite which includes the perfect blend of bun (both the bottom and top) meat and delicious avocado, pepper jack, ranch love.  Oh my.  The flavors melded and came on slowly in my mouth, multiplying little by little until BAM!  I had to  pause for a moment and experience the sensation that took over my entire body.  \nOoh, there's a kick front he jalape\u00f1o jack! Mmm creamy love from the avocado.  Yes, yes yes juicy goodness of the ranch mixed in with Bison.  Whoa.  Very nice.  \n2.  Bison is delicious.  I was afraid it would be gamey - I can't do venison at all.  Bison is nothing like venison.  Hurrah.  And I understand it has less fat so that's a bonus. \n3.  I ordered the regular fries to go with my burger.  They were okay, but clearly overshadowed by the burger.  Again, portion size was proper.  If I am served a bucket load, I eat a bucket load, regardless of quality so I appreciate a little portion control on their part since I can't manage that on my own.  \n4.  I knew my burger dinner at Roam was destined when I scored a spot right out front.  I felt very Doris Day.  This has nothing to do with Roam per se, but still a highlight.  \n5.  Decent prices for excellent quality.  My go to spots for burgers:  Nopa, Absinthe Chez Maman & Marlowe.  All more expensive.  \n\nLowlights\n1.  The cashier was not as enthusiastic or friendly as the buser.  When my friend arrived and ordered his burger, the cashier could have easily up-sold him on fries but neglected to point out that the french burger only has a few fries between the bun, not an actual side of fries.  Customer service is super important in a town with so many wonderful options.  \n2.  Not a strike against Roam but I didn't get a beer or milkshake to complete the trinity of decadence but I'm sure either selection would have been great.", "author": "Wanda P."}

The first letdown was the way you ordered.  I am not a fan at all of anyplace that  makes you pay first; especially a place that sells alcohol.  There is nothing more annoying than a mobbed place where you have to wait in line every time you want another beer, or another bottle of wine.  Here, you can't even get a bottle of wine, and the 'carafe' of wine they sell you for more $$ than two glasses of wine gives you less wine than ordering two glasses of wine.\n\nI ordered the Heritage, minus the caramelized onions and with a Bison patty.  My wife ordered the Chalet with a Turkey patty.  We both split the Fry-Fecta, which is a combination of Russet Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, and a Zucchini Onion Haystack.  \n\nWhen ordering, I asked for the Bison burger to be medium rare, to which I was told matter-of-factly, all burgers with the exception of Turkey are cooked medium rare.  Apparently, the cooks do not know this; mine didn't even have a hint of pink.  Even though it wasn't done to my liking, it was still juicy, and it still tasted good.\n\nMy wife said the Turkey burger was nice and juicy and the flavors worked well, but was still average.\n\nThe Fry-Fecta was possibly the star of the meal.  Neither the Russet nor the Sweet Potato fries had much seasoning on them, but were twice fried, which was a plus.  I imagine the lack of seasoning is intentional, so you pay $7 for one of their special seasonings.  The Zucchini Onion Haystack was awesome; though it would be better with a thicker shoe-string cut.\n\nYou know when you go someplace starving and you swear you just had one of the best things you ever ate.  Unfortunately, that didn't happen here.  \n\nWe came, we ate, we left, and we'll probably forget we ever tried the place.\n\n2 Burgers, 1 Fry-Fecta, 1 Carafe of Wine = $53.00", "author": "Shane C."}

They have specialty burgers, or pick your own and customize with good condiment options.  They have beef, bison, turkey, veggie and elk burgers. Basic Burgers are $5.99; add $2.99 to make it a double.  We ordered our beef burgers medium rare and they didn't have any problem with that - some places don't want to serve burgers that border on \"rare.\"   We got an order of tries ($2.99) and a Zucchini and Onion Stack ($3.49).  On arrival, both seemed skimpy for the price, but it turned out to be enough to 3 of us.  They do have a kid's menu. \n\nThe overall atmosphere of the restaurant was nice, and they have seating inside and with heaters outside. You order at the counter and then seat yourself.  THAT was the problem - it was pretty crowded so it was very difficult to get a table.  I asked at the counter if we should get a table first and then order, but the guy told us to order first because a table usually opens up by the time your food comes.  It did, but only because we had to stand around and look for a table where the dinners were almost finished and then guard it with your life!  Its a pretty small place, and the tables are close together.  When it's crowded, people are standing everywhere waiting for tables. Waiters are dodging around people to deliver drinks.  There's no order to the process of getting a table, so people who came in after you get a table first if they are closer when the table opens up.  When a table does become available, if you are lucky enough to get it, you take it whether or not it is the right size for your party.  Four of us crowded around a table for two. \n\nI didn't like watching people, hoping to get their table while they finished their food, and I didn't like people standing over us while we were eating.  Despite our best efforts to ignore eager dinners who were waiting for our table, it didn't make for an enjoyable dinning experience.  To make it more uncomfortable, they bring you your drinks right after you order, so you are juggling your drinks and your things while waiting for a table - our wine glasses were empty by the time we sat down.  \n\nThis type of seating experience (seems to be very common in restaurants in San Francisco as we encountered it several times during our recent visit) really brings out the worst in people - dog eat dog to get a table.  This mess seems like something that could be handled with a little effort by the staff - they could give you a number and seat you when a table became available.

I wish there were more places like this!  \n\nThat said, I think their salad compilation is kind of light.  If you get a burger wrapped in lettuce (bunless) it feels like your meal lacked adequate vegetables but if you get the salad topped with the mini burgers it feels like an endless pile of lettuce with not enough meat (strangely, I think a burger patty and the mini burger trio are both 6 ounces?).  A happy medium would be nice..", "author": "Ava C."}

Hardly do I ever enjoy burger joints, so me enjoying a place like this in a beautiful area of San Francisco is on point. My entire family and I went. We ordered bison burgers all around and their meat was so tender. What I enjoyed the most though had to be the zuchinni and onion haystack and the sweet potato fries - crispy and thick enough to enjoy and devour. What I absolutely loved though: everything was organic & locally grown. From the vegetables, to the buns, to the potatoes to the condiments! They only used whole foods salt & pepper. We also ordered the Red Raspberry Sofa which was in season & Meyer lemon which were pretty tart but enjoyable. The amazingness of the place supports local farms & makes everything (the pickles are made in house and were delicious) & it's totally healthy. No corn syrup, no hormones. It was a beautiful experience. AND! The atmosphere was so cozy and delightful. It was hardy and clean at the same time. I'm definitely going back & recommend it to everyone! From adults to kids, it's a great time for friends & family.", "author": "Kai S."}

I'm sure you are paying a premium because it's on Union Street and more or less in the Marina District.  \n\n$5.99 for a classic which is no better, no worse than a burger at Five Guys or In-N-Out.  Beyond the house sauce which is their version of thousand island or the standard condiments, any \"special\" sauces is a $.50 upcharge!  If you want to upgrade to Elk or Buffalo meat, it's $2.00+ more to your burger.  The burger is small.  Not sure what makes it artisan if it's the bread or the meat.  \n\nThe fries are unique.  You can order it tossed with garlic parmesean or a maple chipotle glaze.  For what you are paying for, I would expect a basket of fries but it was more like a cup and a half of fries.  \n\nI tried the salted caramel shake.  The flavors was very very very subtle.  I was expected an explosion of caramel flavor like at Bi-Rite or Smitten.  But it tasted more like a vanilla shake with an essence of caramel.  \n\nI'd rather have a burger at Barney's, Burger Bistro, Burgermeister or The Counter.  Sure the price is $1-$2 more, it's also 20-30% bigger.  \n\nDon't fall for the hype.  It's uppity and snobby burgers.  This place is not worth the money you are paying.", "author": "David C."}

I will be more succinct this time.\n1. atmosphere: people just out of work who wear business casual. When they say casual, they mean business casual. The people coming out of the kitchen were wearing jeans - more casual than the patrons.\n2. the long table in the middle (at least when I was there) is a bit annoying and in the way, unless you bring 30 of your friends to sit with you.\n3. burger - good. Artisan... hmm... when I was there, they didn't give a choice between rare, medium, well, you had to state \"pink or not pink.\" Well, regardless of where you are, most of the time the cook gets it wrong anyway, so there. Be aware, what I ordered as \"pink\" was not rare; not dripping blood, but it was brown on the outside and a cooked pink inside.\n4. Staff - the guy who came out of the kitchen to deliver my burger was friendly. The rest of the staff seemed like they'd just as soon be somewhere else - but I suppose maybe that's the case with anyone selling burgers for a living - even if they're grass fed and called artisan. p.s. for those who complained and got my prior review removed - I feel the people who frequent a restaurant contribute to its atmosphere and make others feel either comfortable or uncomfortable - that's part of the dining experience and choice of where to dine.

Still hungry for burgers, I scanned my brain and remembered that Roam recently opened a few blocks down. The place reminded me of a western version of Super Duper.  Same set up --- order at the register and take a seat.  Maybe a cowboy would walk by soon. *crosses fingers* I was a bit over-whelmed by all variety of meats and sauces, so I decided to play it safe and ordered THE CLASSIC w/ Beef, Cheddar and a Fried Egg. It was a decent burger -- juicy, but too much pepper for me. I was a fan of the butter lettuce and the fresh tomatoes, but I'd skip on the chopped onions though. Not amaze-balls. Just an OK burger for my tastes. However, I was a bit jealous of my friend as she was chopping down the French and Fries burger. She was loving that burger down, son! If I ever do come back, I'd probably grab that one. I had a bite of both the Bison and Elk. Too Dry for a burger.

Very, very disappointing.\n\nMy husband was experiencing a craving for a burger and this place had pretty good reviews. I've been here before but this time we decided to sit down and eat at the restaurant. For those who haven't been, this is not the most inexpensive place for a burger, but we get that it's quality so we are ok with this. The burgers were pretty good, I must say. However, the service was just bad...and strange. When we ordered, the lady was pleasant enough. She seemed a bit bothered we didn't know what we wanted within a minute of walking in but got over it quickly enough. So after we were done, we decided to split a shake. My guy went to the restroom, but left his jacket and a bag at the table, as I left my over half-full beer- clear signs we weren't finished with our meal, or so we thought. \n\nWhile I ordered the shake the bus boy came over to our table and stacked up the glasses...I very politely told him I wasn't done with my beer and he said \"You're kidding right?!\" I told him I indeed was not kidding, and then he tried to unstack the four glasses to give me my beer back. Then he realized that maybe was not the best idea and asked what type of beer I had. I told him I was sorry because I wasn't sure, and pointed to the lady who took our order and told him that I asked her for the lightest beer they had on tap. He then said \"So you don't even know what beer you were drinking???\" I again told him no, not thinking it was really a big deal...to which he said \"Lady, you should know what kind of beer you're drinking.\"\n\nI don't know about any of you but there are several times I'll go into a bar and just ask for the hefeweizen on tap or whatever. I'm not saying I shouldn't know, however I really was disappointed that for the price point the service and attitude was so negative. To make matters worse he sent someone else over who asked what beer I was drinking, I again said I didn't know, the lightest beer on tap and that the lady WHO WAS STILL AT THE COUNTER could tell them. He then proceeded to bring me a beer in a glass that was about half full. \n\nSo. Long story short- burger is good, but don't expect the service to be on par with the price by any means. There are several restaurants in this city, many of which have burgers. While it was a good burger, I feel that for the $50 bucks we spent we can take our hard-earned cash to a place that actually cares about customers coming back.", "author": "Megan C."}

I was ecstatic when I heard about Roam-- the first place I've seen that only serves meat that fits the above description. \n\nCustomers walk-up to the counter to place their order- turkey burger, bison burger or regular burger- and pick their toppings/sides. Customers are then given a number and need to hunt for a table (see it and grab it seating--- I can see finding a table getting pretty difficult for large parties during meal times).  It took us about fifteen minutes to get a table for a group of five at around 7 pm.  Our food then took over 30 minutes to arrive-- it took us a while to notice that we had been skipped, and when we pointed this out to the manager- he explained that the kitchen may have misplaced our ticket.  He ended up not having us pay for our meal which I thought was a very nice gesture deserving of loyalty.\n\nI thought that the food was worth the wait, but then again, I don't eat meat often-- I had a turkey burger on multigrain bread with tomato, lettuce, avocado and caramelized onions (approx $8) and sweet potato fries ($3).  Both were phenomenal.\n\nThis is the type of place that will tailor your order to give you exactly what you want-- I REALLY wanted honey mustard on my burger but the restaurant didn't have any so they mixed together yellow mustard and agave nectar for me-- it was delicious!!!  If you're the type of person who doesn't eat their bun, you can also order your burger in a lettuce wrap instead.\n\nI'm definitely going back again!", "author": "Loving L."}

I had returned one other time before going out of town for winter break and yet again perfection.\n\nToday I returned for lunch around 11am, ordered the veggie sunny side on whole wheat,  yet again half way through the burger I did not find a black hair but something chewy, I had to spit it out and there I found a large piece of SOFT PLASTIC.  One side had a straight cut to it and the other rather ragged.  I hate to say it, I believe I digested part of it.  The piece that I spit out was about the size of a 1/3 of a dollar bill.

The second time I went, it was a much better experience.  Their burgers are the perfect size and their milkshakes are very tasty.  Their menu has many options that aim to please everyone - everything from the type of beef on the burger down to the type of seasoning on your french fries.  Their burgers are very lean and very easy to mow down....you don't need a bunch of napkins and you can actually set the burger down without having it collapse on you.\nMy only issue with this place is the seating configuration (per my sister's review below)...The large table in the center means well but in the end, I think it takes up too much space because the bar is also large in size.  If they did away with the large table, the tables against the walls could actually have their dining partner face them and not sit off to their side which seems a bit awkward, especially if you're like on a date or something.

It may have been a random selection out of our long list to tackle, but I find the creativity of the signature burgers and the vast freedom to engineer the burger of one's ultimate imagination that Roam offers to have been an appropriate start to our adventure.\n\nBut the execution was not as spot-on as the concept is noble. I was underwhelmed by the experience and  don't care to dwell too much longer than I have on the subject so will simply copy and paste the feedback I gave to the panel, except to add that Roam at least knows how to season, and if the French and Fry (my burger with gruy\u00e8re, avocado, truffle-parmesan fries, watercress and mustard) were simply a modified sandwich, it'd be a great one:\n\n-Structure: 9. One of the better composed burgers I've had in a while; did not fall apart the entire time. I also liked that the bun was quite sturdy while still managing to be soft and was impressed that it didn't sog up or fall apart in any way.\n-Texture: 5. All I got, unfortunately, was the chewiness of the bun. Avocado, as expected, did nothing (who needs more creamy when you have really rich flavors to stand up to); fries were a bit soggy (a recurring problem in the Fryfecta, as well); and the burger was a bit well for my liking.\n-Proportion and Flavor: 6. I did love the gruyere and truffle oil, but the beef definitely takes a back seat. My patty was a little over, and with no sear/caramelization to show for it. Onions helped bring out the sweetness of the beef, though. The proportion of everything between the bun was spot-on, but then the bread took over as this really big obstacle in chewing and in starchy flavor. And I think the watercress did work particularly well within this sandwich, but further took the focus from the beefy integrity of the burger, as it really just complemented the French flavors.\n-Bottom line: 8 for the concept and the establishment as whole; 6.5 for the burger experience.", "author": "Nuri K."}

The owners had the good sense to put in a place that really deserved a high end burger at a bargain price and they got it.  It's a upscale well designed place with sliding windows looking out on Union Street and their snazzy row of outside tables.  Entering you find a small but well laid out diner style space that looks and feels warm and friendly while very streamlined and contemporary.  Two tones of brown, some brick red, wood and imaginative lighting based on bottles and glass bulbs, very neat.  About a dozen tables including a ten seat family table in the center of the room, and an 8 stool bar with bright red metal stools and walls bereft of anything other than the menu board complete the interior landscape.\n\nNow to the gritty details, the burger (plural in this case, food that ranks near the top of the burger pyramid here in OZ.  For a pick and choose menu, this one is easy to decipher and master, thank you management.  So I ordered the grass fed beef with Gruyere and all the trimmings, their plain fries and a diet coke.  The burger was $4.99 plus a buck for the very good cheese, the fries were $2.49 and the Boylans diet coke another $2.29 so prices are a bargain in today's overpriced, undervalued burger market.  The burger came on a toasted local bakery made sesame bun that was perfect for the meat and burger fixings, no natural spillage disasters here.  The burger was GOOD, really good.  Fresh lettuce, tomato and onion, house made pickles and a tasty house sauce made it one of my favorite new burgers this year.  The Fries were really good, but no longer hot or even warm when served.  The meat choices are turkey, grass fed beef and buffalo are really top quality and the veggie burger sounds like a real winner too.  Various high quality cheeses, sauces, and artisan toppings round out the burger menu.  Salads are also available as well as seasonal vegetables along with the sides.  \n\nBeverages are also fabutastic and include Straus Family ice cream or frozen yogurt milk shakes in quite a few unique flavors, their own house made artisan sodas (Meyer lemon, ginger lime, prickly pear and caramelized pineapple), bottled Boylan diet and regular cola, Kemper root beer, mighty leaf teas, organic Kombucha Botanica, Blue Bottle coffee, organic milk and apple juice.  There are more beverages than food items, a first for this intrepid raconteur.  A selection of micro brews and good wines are also available.\n\nMade fresh with mindful ingredients, lots of organic and green touches, a really sweet and thoughtful staff, great prices and a super location make Roam a natural winner, sure to pop up in future locations, a well developed and executed restaurant, get thee to Roam.", "author": "Stu S."}

Roam is a large spare room with a family table in the middle seating about 10, bar seating, which looked incredibly uncombortable on these red metal chairs, and several two and four top tables.  You order at the end of the bar, where the menu is posted on the wall, then you get a number, sit down and wait for your food.  Water and condiments are available at a side table. It's kind of like a Chipotle, and I just don't like that atmosphere. It makes you want to eat and run, which I guess might be what they want so they can turn the tables over more quickly. They did have the world cup soccer match on the big screen tv above the bar, which we did watch.\nThe food was quite good and really too good for the space. Next time, maybe I'll take it to go.  We had a burger with jack cheese, jalapeno relish and ranch dressing and corn tortilla chips--strange combo but it tasted great on the lightly sweetened bun. Our choices were: red or not red. We ordered it red and it was just a tad more medium rare than medium rare.  We also tried the fry basket of fried onions/zucchini, sweet potatoes and potatoes.  The onions/zucchini are finely shredded almost in long strands, salted and they have a very light dusting of flour (or cornmeal or something along that line). They are veryyyy tasty, but a bit too salty.  The sweet potatoes are actually crisp, which is difficult to do with a fried sweet potato. And, the french fried potatoes were mediocre at best. I wouldn't order them again.  We didn't even eat half of them.\nWe also had a salted caramel shake with the marshmallow brulee. YUM.  The shake was a bit salty and caramelly, which was perfect. It's not huge but we shared it and didn't finish it. I loved the marshamallow brulee, which is one marshmallow burnt almost to a crisp by a torch, sitting ontop of a graham cracker.  I could have had a whole meal of these!\nthe condiments available are haberno sauce, dijon and regular mustard and ketchup.

They were out of bison patties, the milkshake machine wasn't working, and the cashiers seemed confused by... everything.  So I ended up with a turkey patty and a hole in my heart where a milkshake should be.\n\nThe burgers are pretty small for the price, but the buns are huge.  I get it: bread is cheaper than meat.  But the balance was just way off and you could barely taste the patty through all that bun.  (Other reviewers point out that this may be because the meat is lacking flavor, too.)  Roam also offers a broad selection of cheeses, but I couldn't taste my aged white cheddar under the mountains of bread, so it's kind of a waste.  Hubs had a beef burger with gruyere and was also disappointed.  To be fair, he was pretty bummed that they didn't have a bacon add-on.\n\nThe fry-fecta is awesome in theory, but the execution is sorely lacking.  The zucchini strips are sliced too thin to eat with your hands (more like strings than fries) and make a mess.  The sweet potato fries were delicious, but the regular ones totally forgettable.  The house-made prickly pear soda tasted kind of thick, but the kombucha was awesome.

These burgers have me salivating just thinking about them. Yes, I do not eat any red meat and am selective of anything non-vegetarian, but a vegetarian would not go hungry here. And it's as healthy as a burger can get. For all of you meat lovers out there, this is the best meat you can consume! On that same thought, all of you veggie lovers out there; this is the best sourced veggie burger you can consume! All of the meats are humanely raised on open pastures and the house-made veggie burgers are organic, gluten free, and vegan. Also, Roam only employs local farms committed to sustainable practices. To add to the bucket of goodness, the entire restaurant is made on sustainable practices.  Low VOC paint on the walls means less toxic air you breathe in. To top it off, you can have a perfectly healthy, satiating, mouth-watering gourmet meal for about $13 or less! \n\nTaste: Mouthwatering delicious!  \n\nAll of the shakes are sweetened with Agave Nectar, not refined white sugar. If you are watching calories and fat intake, but still want to indulge, you can have a yogurt-shake. The fresh veggie burger is the healthiest burger, and its really good.

So did the guy in front of me. The server spent the first fifteen minutes of my wait for the food flirting with said guy. It's was kind of cute, she gave him a free milkshake (where was mine), his food came out, and she was sad when left. \n\nWhile she was flirting with this guy, a tray of drinks sat idle at the end of the bar. 4 glasses of wine, a soda, and a few milkshakes. I actually thought it was weird that this tray of drinks just sat idle, but thought nothing of it, until a few minutes after the guy left the girl brought it over to a table. It wasn't my order or anything, but it urked me that this girl let at least a 5 item drink order sit there on the counter for at least 10 minutes. If I was waiting for my drinks that long I would have been pissed!\n\nAnyways, fast forward 15 minutes later and my burger still wasn't out. By this time two 16 year old cashier guys were fooling around with the tv. Finally I asked one of them to please check on my order, they came out with it (they did apologize for the seriously long wait) and I walked the two block walk home to enjoy what I hoped to be a great burger.\n\nNot only was my burger cold, the fries were soggy and also cold. I don't think it would have been much better hot, though. The bun is probably from the same vendor that Burger King uses for their burgers, and the meat was jut mediocre, like you could tell it's ben in a freezer for a significant amount of time. Overall, not good.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this place unless you are a cute 30ish guy, maybe then you'll get warm food and a free milkshake.", "author": "Celine S."}

Quality is decreasing a bit and still expensive for what it is (and tip is expected too). Importantly, the bathroom is usually a bit smelly and not at all clean (hadn't used it for the first couple years, but now this year have happened to need it a couple of times). Normally I eat meat of some sort there, but today, had Veggie burger, which was so \"undercooked\" that it just fell apart. Obviously it is mostly quinoa so it is not that it is raw, but it had no burger texture or \"hold\" like veggie burgers should to make them seem like a burger. It just flopped out of the roll like raw ground beef would - and was frankly lacking some flavor too (despite jack cheese). My shake was poorly made (again) and handed to me leaking all over (a nice bus boy noticed it on his own and came over to wipe it off a bit, which was thoughtful and proactive). What happened?!

Unfortunately, even after almost an hour there, I never got the chance. We stopped by Roam on Saturday afternoon, and my first impression was good - interesting menu, decent prices, nice decor. It didn't take long to order, but once we got a seat, I realized that almost every other table in the place was full of people waiting for their food - not a good sign. After 30 minutes, still no sign of our order (not even the french fries to tide me over??), and we checked at the counter to make sure it was coming.

The veggie burger is too sweet; just get it over with and call it a donut why don't you?  Of course, I am spoiled with the incredible veggie burger from THE PLANT Cafe, which sits alone as king of all veggie burgers.  Make me a queen to that burger and it could put its \"meat\" into my \"buns\" anytime.  I digress.\n\nStill, to be fair, concept and ingredients all seem fine, and the meat burgers had by my companions were all raved about and spewed forth their juices in joy.  I mean the meat looked very juicy so that the buns were wet at the end.  Mind out of the gutter, a soggy bottom bun is sure sign of a happy ending.\n\nWow, I should write more burger reviews so I can have fun.\n\nSpeaking of fun, the staff sure didn't look like they were having fun.  Yes, I know, you can hire cheap food service staff who have no stake in the business.  But, employees without a stake in their workplace unfortunately have a way of acting like they don't care because, why should they?  I'm philosophizing, and I don't want to overdo the point, but when I go into some of the best run food places I get a strong sense of staff who really care about the business and are really into it.

Everything was great except for the fact that the put way too much of this pickle relish. It kind of over-powered everything else, and found myself scraping it off. The service was great. The reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is that I think that it is a little over priced for a walk up/sit yourself restaurant. I got a standard hamburger, a beer and the fry-fecta. My meal came out to be $20 dollars.\n\nI also find that their menu is contradicting itself. They are all about being organic, and having grass-fed meat. What I find strange is that on one of their hamburgers they have corn strips.

The burger (with egg and white cheddar) was a bit soggier than I'd like but the slipperiness could be attributed to my choice of yummy toppings. The house sauce had a bi too much going on, although it was a good stab at adding a kick to the typical thou. Isle dressing sauce. \n\nSo let me begin with my never ending story:\nOrdered before there was any lunch crowd- read: no one else there. And we sit down, people trickle in. Some other people get their stuff before us, fine, it's mostly salads and non- stove things... We check the recipt and it doesnt have all the toppings we chose on it, my bf asks if they got it right becuase our cashier seemed newbie-ish. Another girl comes up and reassures us that the back of thr house gets more info than the recipt shoes... Ok. But when we get our food, pretty much all our toppings are jumbled between two burgers ( think if they wrote all our toppings on pieces of paper, put them in a hat, then pulled them out at random to put them between the two burgers.) its ok, happens sometimes. The poor server had to use the menu i had to write it down :/ Then we realize that the fries that were the only things we kept of the order, were not truffle. Bugger. We get the food back after  a dozen (literally) other people get theirs and we have to insert more change in the meter... And my bf is like  oh, raw onions, not grilled.

The staff looks young and mildly dazed sometimes but if they are not rude, it is A-OK with me.  The service is excellent - seen pleasing the whims of a picky family of 5 with 3 screaming kids, to refilling the mustard jars within a minute of it being emptied and hand drying each utensil.\n\nThe sponge dough they use for their burger is light and fluffy, almost no carbs at all.  They offer bison burgers as well.  The cost is very reasonable for burgers.  They bring in greens from local farms, which I really like.  The lemons they put in their water and ice tea is very fresh, and freshly sliced - I smell them when I take my first sip.\n\nParking is a nightmare there, on that street.  But I strongly recommend that you go try it.  For the price and the quality you get, it is a rare, rare deal in san francisco.

As a side note, there was an irate couple at the next table who also has reviewed on Yelp. I overheard the whole thing and was embarrassed by the couple's attitude and the way they treated the staff and was relieved when they stormed out of the restaurant. Try Roam yourself, and realize that if you go to a new restaurant when it's slammed, you might have to wait.", "author": "Hurston P."}

The veggie burger is great, very flavorful. it falls apart but i'm okay with that. The Turkey burger is also great, tasty and always perfectly prepared. There are a variety of interesting toppings and sauces that make these burgers even better. My boyfriend loves the \"french and fry\" burger and usually gets it doubled. I will ding Roam on not \"doubling\" the burger last time, but I forgive them because their milkshakes and sweet potato fries are awesome. \n\nmy one suggestion - more options for sides!!

As a reluctant carnivore, I always appreciate a turkey burger option.  Usually turkey patties aren't so inspired.  Au contraire, Roam's turkey patties are delicious - wonderfully seasoned and high quality.  \n\nI had a hard time choosing the style - swiss and mushrooms or truffle fries, avocado and gruyere?  My friend opted to top his burger with an egg - brilliant!  I'll be back to try the other options soon.   If you are super hungry, add an extra patty for a few bucks more.  Excellent fry options as well.  I went for the mix of potato, sweet potato, and crunchy zucchini onion mix. Yum!  \n\nI appreciate Roam's dedication to quality, local, natural ingredients.  \n\nThe surprising part- it was cheap! The burger was around $5.  Fries are a few bucks more (or $4.50 for the combo described above).  The Marina desperately needed a place like this.  \n\nThe owner stopped by to make sure the food was great and we were enjoying ourselves.  Check and check.  This guy truly cares about your experience and will go out of his way to right any wrong.  \n\nThe only negative was that it took a while to get our food.  I assume that's because all of the ingredients are fresh and burgers are made to order.  It's a new place and I assume that one little kink will work itself out.", "author": "laurie r."}

I don't know what it is, maybe I never had a decent burger before but to me they are always just blah, normally I would take Thai or sushi over a burger anytime; in fact I only eat it when I am hungry and nothing else is available. Tonight, I was super hungry and this place just happened to be next to the parking spot I found. \n\nFirst, I was quite impressed by the decor, it didn't look like a regular burger joint but looked much more trendy. The menu was simple yet everything on it seemed to be super-delicious and I had a hard time choosing. I finally decided on a BBQ beef burger with caramelized onions, aged white cheddar, BBQ sauce, oil & vinegar slaw and jalapeno relish. \n\nThe order came out lightening fast and the burger tasted simply astonishing. The sesame bun was amazing and complemented all other ingredients well. The beef patty was pink and the meat was melting in my mouth. With all the perfect trimmings there was big bang of flavor in every bite. I hoovered the whole thing in a minute, and drooling just thinking about it.... Great price too.

When I came in to get my first burger, they told me they had not yet set up in their registers for merchant discounts but would be doing so shortly.\n\nThe place is hopping. So when I went in a month later I found out they still hadn't put that in place. We all give each other a merchant discount (except them). I emailed to ask why and when would it be happening and I was told by Jason, they were just getting on their feet so hey had no idea when.  We're talking about 10% so I am not sure why they are being so stingy. We give 10% merchants discount on a $500 coat, they can't seem to give the same on a $9 (!!) burger!!\n\nSo I tried again on last Thursday, still no merchants discount AND when I went it to pick up the burger I ordered I had to ask why the price was so high. It seems they have decided to increase the purchase price on upgrading from a regular burger to a bison burger (from .99 cents to a whopping $2.99) though they haven't updated their menus OR their online menu.

A little gruyere and some sauteed onions on top of turkey that seems to have special spices and a little magic makes the best turkey burger I've ever had.  It was quite a pleasant surprise to be able to order a glass of Clif Family wine, a small local organic winery made by the owners of Clif Bar.  Best burgers in the Bay, I say.\n\nThat was Jen.  I had dinner with her and the thoughts expressed here don't necessarily reflect those of Jen.  To be honest, I thought the name \"artisan\" in the restaurant name was a little pompous.  Until I had my first bite.  And I truly can say that the turkey burger that I had (turkey burger tejano style) was literally a masterpiece.  I forget all the ingredients; but it was (a) beautiful; and (b) friggin' delicious.  There was some little pieces of goodness in there that were well thought-out and worthy of being called an artisan burger.  I am typically a fan of Frankie's turkey burger and this blows that away.

Sure the food is solid, and I felt compelled to try it since it's very close to my office.  However, it's one of those places where you feel like you just paid about two bucks too much for everything.  That's not a big deal when you're out on the town with your wife at night, but when it's a quick lunch nobody likes feeling suckered...or worse...leaving hungry after over paying.  Well, today I had a craving for a milk shake and remembered Roam sells them...albeit for $5.  When I placed the order the cashier said \"large or small.\"  I thought to myself, self, could they possibly have an even more expensive size than $5?  So I ordered the small and jokingly said \"it better be really big and really good!  She assured me it would be.  NOT.  First, I think I blew a brain vessel trying to suck the shake through a straw that's better suited for stirring coffee.  What cheap mother f'ers for not providing a decent straw with their rip off shakes.  That's how Roam is with everything though.  Anyway, it was so not $5 quality.  Am I wrong to expect actual strawberries or at least frozen strawberry mix in my $5 shake?  No chance.  It's that cheap syrup flavoring mixed with soft serve ice cream and the dixie cup it came in was an insult.  I frigging hate Roam.  Two stars is generous.", "author": "Mister H."}

It was also extremely mushy, so mushy I would not even call it a patty, but more like a heap of bloody beet mash. We went with my sister, who is a meat-eater, and even she said she can get much better burgers in her current hometown of San Diego. It was also overpriced. We were also not impressed with the atmosphere. It was unorganized, chaotic, and dirty.  We will not be returning.", "author": "Suzanne A."}

Onions were truly caramelized and sweet. Bun and meat were delicious and messy. Salt caramel shake for dessert was a delicious, decadent ending.

Wow you're arteries must be clogged you're thinking?!?! Well I always get the veggie burgers. They are sooo good!! They are homemade and like nothing I've had. I could never get sick of them. My favorite is the Pacific Blue or the Chalet. They also make homemade sodas with agave so it's not full of artificial sugars, they change seasonally and they are delicious! Recently I've had the apple, yummy autumn goodness!!! I also tried the salad for the first time recently with veggie burger sliders, it was delicious! I love this place!", "author": "Colleen m."}

But I wanted to try grassfed ground beef. Actually I wanted to try bison but all complaints are correct: despite ample time to change online menu to correct price, the bison is add'l $2.99, NOT $.99. For 1/4 lb. no way is that worth it even though I didn't pay.\nAnyway, ordered tryfecta and the french style burger (it's not really but has some cutesy french style name) with gruyere, avocado and truffled french fries on it. Also got tomato and pickle. Friend got classic.\nAfter paying I wanted a beer. Confusing as there is a bar but wasn't sure if supposes to tip or not, especially as there was tax on the beer. I did tip, which I think helped me later. $3+tax +$1 tip= pricey PBR.\nFood arrives. Tryfecta lukewarm. I like my fried foods hot. My burger looks good but doesn't have the truffles fries. No fries on it at all. I ask the server who confirms that the fries were forgotten. Back it goes. The tryfecta coolness is yucky. This is where I think tipping for the beer may have helped. I asked same guy I tipped if we could get hot fried Food. He was nice about it. I think tryfecta mustve sat waitng for burgers.\nBurger returns. Tasty! Chockful of stuff. Love the bun, but I'm a bread person.  Soft, yeasty and more sesame seeds than I've ever seen on a bun.  The meat? Can't really say! Cheese and avocado and fries kinda drowned out patty. Fatty tasty goodness. But as I told my friend- it could've just as easily been a veggie burger. The tryfecta- fries were good. Sweet potato fries pretty good. The onion and zucchini strings were tasty but more oil than vegetable. And I tasted those fried onions all night long. Ugh.\nFriend said his was good. He's a burger person.  His assessment was buegermeister better. And he wasn't keen on the tryfecta. Said fries pretty good but didn't care for swt pots or onion things. \nAll in all I found it tasty. But I'd rather have the bun and burger toppings with a nonfat Boca burger base. Then I could avoid the pointless meat but get all the tastiness.\nNo on the tryfecta. Next time just an order of the truffled parmesan fries.\nMaybe it really should be 3 stars but they were nice and I did enjoy my burger thing.\noh but they really need some heat in there! Freezing! Everyone had on coats and some even hats and scarves!", "author": "Allucaneat G."}

Full disclosure: my girlfriend is a vegetarian so, by proxy, I am as well. This means that on the rare occasion that I get meat, it comes with the joy of reuniting with a long lost friend. She got the veggie French and Fries burger and I got the Tejano with a beef patty and then we split a Fry-Fecta (partial orders of russet fries, sweet potato fries, and zucchini onion haystack). Sometimes I do this thing were I panic just before I order and end up randomly picking something on the menu. That's why I was a bit surprised when my burger came out with tortilla chips on it. All surprises aside, it was a great burger. I tried a bit of my girlfriend's and it was also very tasty. In the Fry-Fecta, the russet fries were definitely the weakest, but they were all very good. I love that you can match any of the patties with any of the burgers. It was on the noisier side inside the restaurant, but that might have been due to the large group all dressed in costumes. This place is absolutely prime for a return visit.", "author": "Jeremy J."}

I never felt rushed and asked her quite a few questions about the burgers since it was my first order.  When I got to the restaurant there was a huge line so a big plus for the service and patience of their employees.  I ordered the sunny side with truffle parmesan fries and boy was it good.  I'm not sure if I'll go with an egg on my burger again though.  I got the non-pink burger it wasn't dry or tough at all.  I do wish the burger was a bit bigger but it's the perfect meal for lunch.  I would suggest not getting the fries to go.  I work about 5 minutes away and by the time I got back, they were all soggy.  Maybe if I eat there, I will try the fries again.  I went there again last Friday and got the French and Fries.  You'd think i'd learn but again, the fries weren't that good.  The burger itself was delicious.

If you live elsewhere, like myself, don't let the fact that Roam is in the Marina detour you. It's worth the effort. They serve gourmet burgers at regular burger prices. For $4.99 you can get a regular burger or $6 for a gourmet burger and you can't go wrong. Their milkshakes are a must, they are amazing!!!! It's an order and sit place so don't expect attentive hand-and-foot service. It's just not that kind of place, so if you have to wait a minute for a table to be cleared, get over it. If you want a quality burger, shake and fries (get the sweet potato fries) then this is your place. I would have given them 5 stars if it hand't been for one crucial mistake (and I sat on this for a few days to see if I would cool down, but I didn't). They ask you if you want your burger pink and I strongly said YES, Pink please. They served me an amazingly over cooked burger that was obviously for someone that asked for it welllllll done. My disappointment was squashed upon my first bite. Grinding my teeth into that rubbery patty was delightful, the taste of the meat, the dressings and experience was outstanding.", "author": "Spencer C."}

So, if I temporarily fall off the veg bandwagon, and decide to \"splurge\" and have a real burger, this will definitely be the place!  Grass fed, organic, etc is the ONLY way to go!  My husband and I decided to share a veggie burger \"classic\" no onions with a side of fry-fecta and a prickly pear soda.  (I'm looking forward to the blue bottle coffee shake on my next visit) !  Veggie burgers can often be disappointing, but this one was tasty thanks to the super fresh ingredients and perfect amount of seasoning.  I think the bun was my favorite part...and the house made pickles, and the special sauce!  The fries were light, not greasy, and had the perfect amount of salt on them.  (Next time I'll probably try the truffle seasoning.)  Even the prickly pear soda was delicious.  Not too sweet and really refreshing.

How could I resist the call of burgers anyway? Plus, after my initial review, one of the owners reached out to me to apologize for the bad experience I had, and I thought it was a very nice gesture. I am all about keeping local business alive, and my intention was really not to hurt Roam's business. My initial review was more a cry of disappointment, since I wanted to like Roam so much all the time. So fast forward, I went back to Roam early July, on a sunny sunday afternoon, with family from out of town. Yes, I put the bar high enough because they were craving for burgers, and we were really hungry. The place was not crowded, we ate outside, everything was perfectly executed: the burgers were juicy and delicious, the fries were crunchy, and everything was served promptly. So, I put the bar higher for the next visit: coming with my husband, my kid, and my parents, visiting from France. The place was a little bit more crowded, but we got spots at the big table. It feels always weird that people wiuld not move a bit to let you eat facing your party: instead, I had to listen to some chick stories, but well...I chose the seasonal salad with the mini veggie burgers trio, my mom took the same, but with beef trio, and both my dad and my husband took the classic beef with russet and potato fries. Again, an excellent experience: it was tasty, served after 10 mn or so waiting, and there was no mistake in the order (it happened in the past that we were missing the fries, or another item). Even more pleasant was the feeling that the team working there seemed more committed to offer great service with great quality food. One of the co-owners, as she introduced herself, even checked if we were having a nice experience, which is to me , quite unusual in a casual burger place, but this attention to the clients is adding the cherry on top of my burger cake.", "author": "Helene L."}

The choices on the menu is great too, just enough choices, and everything is interesting.  The burger tasted fresh.  The tomato, the fried egg, the greens, it's all very good.  By comparison, it seems like the meat itself is the weakest part of the whole experience.  I want a burger that's full of juice. It should be messy, and there's should be beef juice dripping from the mouth at every bite.  By the time when I finished my burger here, my hands and face are clean.  My wife had the veggie burger, and she can taste everything except the patty.  It's not bad overall.  I would bring friends here when I want a nice place to sit down, eat, and have a beer.
