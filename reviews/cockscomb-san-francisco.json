I FINALLY got to go, and it did not disappoint!! \n\nThe pig's head is THE REASON to go to Cockscomb. It's a half pig's head with everything still there --yes even eyes, pieces of brain, snout -- and super crispy skin on top. The meat underneath is just incredibly tender, juicy, and flavorful. Even the beans and cabbage on the side was super tasty.\n\nThe tombo crudo (fresh & light compared to the heaviness of everything else) and beef heart were some other faves. And that's probably the best gnocchi I've ever had. The smoked XO sauce with the clams was packed with umami, and the foie gras with trotters was rich and decadent. \n\nTBH, there were two things I would have skipped -- the crispy pig ears (that were served with the pig's head) and the trucker's corn. \n\nWe WAY over ordered, so I had the bacon chop for dinner the next night. Still delicious and perfectly seared, even reheated in the oven. \n\nRecs for 2-3 people (well if you can eat a lot!): \"hot mess,\" tombo crudo, beef heart tartare, pig's head, gnocchi. It's going to be rich, but delicious!! I can't wait to go back! \n\nA list of everything we tried:\nThe Hot Mess Special (foie gras + trotters)\nTombo Crudo\nGnocchi\nTrucker's Corn\nClams & Smoked XO Sauce\nWood Oven Roasted Pig's Head\nBeef Heart Tartare\nCC Charcuterie\nBacon Chop\nChocolate Mousse", "author": "Rebecca S."}

Was I missing out big time? No, not really. Was it good food though? Yes, it was.\n\nAttention to detail and quality sourcing is an undeniable fact at Cockscomb so you best be sure that you'll be paying a premium for many of these dishes. That being said, the level of service provided is second to none. Dishes were described with impeccable precision, glasses were regularly topped off, and waiters would even refold your napkin if you stepped away to use the restroom!\n\nWe began our meal with the Hot Mess which is grilled sourdough topped with braised trotters and seared foie gras. It is then drizzled with brown butter pork an jus and garnished with mission and kubota figs. This is easily one of the most decadent things I've had in my life, but it hit all the right notes. The sourdough crust, despite being soaked in an jus and fatty foie gras, still maintained a little bit of crispness. The braised pork trotters then added a little bit of meatiness. Buttery notes were met with the foie gras and also the soft braised pig skin. And the figs then provided some nice sweetness. I definitely could have used some actual bread to soak up the extra an jus/sauce though. This dish was also very popular - at least all 3 of our adjacent tables also tried this.\n\nFor our shared main, we went with the ribeye wagyu (14 oz) which comes accompanied by diver scallops (locally sourced), roasted baby onions, roasted butterball potatoes, and drizzled with a brown butter green pepper corn an jus. The wagyu was good, but not the best I've had. It was tender, but did not have the melt in your mouth feel that I've experienced with wagyu at Japanese restaurants. The scallops, on the other hand, were definitely one of the best I've had! They were perfectly seared and the peppercorn an jus was a delicious accompaniment for it. As for the sides, I liked the roasted baby onions - they were sweet and slightly carmelized, a perfect pairing with the steak. The potatoes were more hearty but I personally felt they were a hair bit undercooked, a little harder than I prefer.\n\nWe also added a side of brown butter gnocchi with fresh parm. They were delicious little pillows of potatoes served over browned butter....so what's not to love?\n\nAnd to finish the meal off, we opted for the panna cotta. It was perfectly set and had the right consistency. It's pairing with fresh sliced strawberries and a reduced balsamic vinegar was also very good and not overwhelming, just acidic enough to cut an otherwise very creamy dessert. I've had a similar version before where the vinegar was not reduced nearly enough and it sucked so much, but Cockscomb version was on-point and one that I would opt for again and again!\n\nOverall, Cockscomb is a great place to come if you want to try some unique plates and splurge a little.", "author": "Elaine Y."}

The pig's ear salad was not the right combination since the ears are fried and the others were some citrus, but they didn't mesh well with each other. Way too salty we had to send it back. Just stick with the pig's ear by itself is good. The cod over the giant beans was bland, need a little bit more flavors. \n\nWe also ordered the pig's head to share. Though part of the pig's head was over roasted that one side was charred and we couldn't eat it. The Vietnamese salad that comes with the head was good. \n\nOverall the service was great!! That deserved a 5 stars! Everyone was nice and very attentive. I had a great time, but the food, not so much.", "author": "Lynnda T."}

On a Saturday night this place is hopping and has an energy that reminded us of NYC. \n\nWe went here to celebrate and, with a reservation, were seated promptly. A cute celebration card was waiting for us when we sat down! After much deliberation (wagyu beef/scallops sounded so tempting!) we decided to get the classic pork chop, the \"ham\"burger (pork burger), and a side of brown butter gnocchi. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed my burger more than the pork chop, though both dishes were fantastic. \n\nFor dessert, we got the berry cobbler, which came with delicious vanilla creme fraiche! Definitely recommmend!!!\n\nMost of the parties around us were larger groups ordering the pin steak (4lbs if steak!) and pig face.

We ordered a few starters to share family style, and each got our own entrees. The little gem salad was delightful and made me feel okay with drinking three cocktails, the roasted chicken entree was anything but ordinary and the grilled whole pineapple dessert with coconut ice cream almost made me die from happiness. \n\nFrom start to finish the staff was perfect in the welcome to the ordering to the execution.

We were seated in a really cool upstairs nook of this sprawling space. \n\nThe most important thing about eating here is that it smells amazing. From the moment you walk in, you're enveloped in the wonderful smell of the burning wood and all the delicious meats roasting on the embers. You'll be instantly hungry the minute you walk in, even if you had previously believed you wouldn't be. \n\nI had the little gem salad and the roasted chicken.

My family and I are huge fans of a great steak dinner, and Cockscomb definitely delivered an experience beyond our expectations. \n\nWe decided to celebrate my dad's birthday on a Monday night, and the restaurant staff was very kind to have a birthday card at the table once we were seated. Once we were seated, the waiter was very friendly and eloquently told us the specials of the day. \n\nAPPETIZERS\n+ Fried squid and pig ears-- This might sound like a strange dish to try, but it was delicious! The pig ears tasted like crispy pig skin chips and the calamari was fried perfectly. I also enjoyed the addition of mint and citrus  to give the dish some brightness. \n\n+ Little Gems Salad--I ordered this salad without expecting anything too amazing (since salads are usually about the same to me), but this salad was so good! The romaine lettuce was crispy, fresh and sweet, and I loved the light vinegarette dressing. They also added fried anchovies and shredded cheese to give the entire dish some saltiness. \n\nENTREES (Shared between 4 people) \n+ Pin Bone Steak--If you're looking to treat yourself and happen to have a party of four with you, get this steak! It was honestly one of the best steaks I have ever had at any restaurant. We ordered it medium rare, and the dry aged quality of the beef definitely proved itself in this dish. The steak was massive, and served with a delicious gravy and bone marrow dip. It also came with some fresh greens and crispy potatoes\n\n+ Tuna Collar--I was skeptical about ordering this dish, since I've never been too impressed by fish collars, but I was blown away by this dish! The tuna collar was massive, and it came decked out with peppercorns, green onions, peppers, and other aromatics. It was cooked in the wood fire, and the meat was tender and fatty.  \n\nOverall, this was an amazing experience and I cannot recommend this restaurant more! The staff was so kind and friendly, and the service was amazing. They were constantly checking up on us, and filling our waters.

The location of this restaurant is definitely in a weird spot in the city. It's far away from the actual hustle and bustle of SF and in between the residential and empty commercial buildings. It's not a dress up type of place, more casual and for happy hour type of eating experiences.\n\nSF made reservations for a Saturday night and we got seated upstairs. The restaurant was somewhat busy and we whizzed by the first floor, up the stairs to a corner seating arrangement overlooking the buildings. The tables were all crammed together upstairs and with people being seated, it was hard to maneuver between the chairs and the tables to get to the table and out.\n\nOur server that night was very enthusiastic, but you can tell he was saying the same thing over and over to each table. He described their specials that night and it was kind of like a two meals in one plate. I wish we didn't order it because it was so little for two people and cost a bit more. SF ordered the sirloin and scallops special since I originally wanted the Coulette steak dish. We also ordered half a dozen oysters, the grilled cheese sandwich, and a Pisco Punch. The oysters were very fresh and I really liked their condiments - a Jalapeno vinegar sauce and homemade hot sauce. The grilled cheese sandwich was also very good with the sunnyside up egg on top, but it wasn't anything that was so over the top crazy. And there wasn't anything special about the drink, it wasn't too strong but tasty.\n\nWhen it came to the actual main dish, it was SO DISAPPOINTING. The asparagus and the sirloin steak with scallops was okay. It was amazing and the portions were too small for two people. I though the sirloin was over seasoned with salt that I tried to eat the scallops to kind of off-taste the salt.

The aroma and aura of this spot is divine, and you'll easily lose yourself in great conversations with delectable food and hoppy beers for a few hours.\n\nAs a table we started off with a few Daily Requirements which were the Gnocchi, Duck Fat Cauliflower, and Grilled Asparagus. Now I wasn't trying to be no Jennie Craig spokesperson or be aware of my caloric intake. HELL TO THE NO\n\nGimme the butter\nGimme the carbs\nGimme the calories\nMOST IMPORANTLY\nGIMME THE MEATS\n\nThe gnocchi will make you cry tears of happiness because it is so well executed. I don't know how to describe it, but literally every bite you take you'll be slopping the sage & brown butter. A simple dish ingredient wise, but damn Cockscomb knocked it out of the park.\n\nYou have to also grab an order of the cauliflower because it's a great savory app.\n\nI was in complete desire for some proper meat sweats so I opted for the Bacon Chop. If there is one dish you need to try it has to be this one. My friend Farrah suggested this spot and I kept thanking her throughout the meal.\n\nDefinitely can't wait to come back!!", "author": "Tomas R."}

I requested counter seating and we were seated right in front of the giant fire roaring in the kitchen, which blasted my face with heat initially. Then I got accustomed to it and it became more like a light toasting. \n\nThe first waiter who came didn't know any of the market prices on the menu, but our second waitress seemed much more knowledgeable. I'd done my research beforehand and cautioned my friend about ordering anything else if our plan was to have the pig's head. Our waitress was honest in saying that it was pretty big and we would most likely have leftovers, so we decided to just have the head in addition to our beer and wine. \n\nThe pig's head is no joke. I watched it go into the oven and come out with blistered skin and a fork stuck through the eyeball. You even see its teeth (our pig had lots of cavities). It's kind of gross and the skin, once you cut through it, gives way to a dense layer of oily fat. I couldn't eat the skin without grease spilling out. Not the healthiest thing, but oh man it was so crunchy and had a slight sweetness from whatever sauce went on it. The meat underneath all that fat is tender and falls apart at the prod of a fork. There's also a salad with fried pig ears that comes with the head, which has a nice acidity that cuts through the fat. \n\nAmazingly, we finished the whole damn thing, including the eyeball (which was actually not bad). I think it would be a lot better with bread or something to soak up the juices and fat, and some vessel to eat the meat on. The meal sat heavily in my stomach until I walked up and down a couple hills. The other shareable dishes looked super good and there's a length specials menu. Would probably be a good place to go with a group so you can try everything!", "author": "Sophie W."}

You have to walk through the restaurant and up a flight of stairs to get to the bar but it's pretty cool because if you're lucky you can sit overlooking the restaurant (as the people who pushed us out of the way to get in before us even though we had been waiting longer did.)  I actually felt kind of lucky to be sitting right by the bartender.  He was fantastic.  Quick, friendly, knowledgeable and downright funny!\n\nI'm usually skeptical of house wine because it's almost always a blend that I feel I could have bought at a gas station.  Not here.  The house white was a chardonnay and it was delightful with my oysters.  Light and crisp, citrusy.  \n\nSpeaking of those oysters... My experience has been that the older and smaller guys are usually the $1 ones served.  Again, not here.   Full plump, large oysters are what we received.  The celery mignonette was GREAT as well as the firefighter hot sauce.  Try this hot sauce.  Do it.  It wins awards for a reason.  \n\nThe rest of the food was spot on.  We had to order another order of the pigs ears because we were fighting over them.  Ask your bartender if there are any off menu items for happy hour as well.  We got some very good chicharrones this way.  \n\nThis place is absolutely on my list to come back and have a proper dinner.", "author": "Christina R."}

It's sooo good and I feel like you'd have to be totally insane to NOT find something amazing on the menu that you're dying to order.\n\nI'm kicking myself for not ordering oysters, first of all. It's the very first thing on their menu and they specialize in fresh beautiful seafood. Ah, well. Next time. I was still blissfully happy with what we did enjoy. We chose a bunch of sides (\"daily requirements\") to start with. Gnocchi with sage & brown butter, mushrooms \"a la greque\" with garlic, lemon, and parsley, \"dirty\" crispy potatoes, and duck fat cauliflower with chili, garlic, and mint. Being gluten free I avoided anything with gluten (duh) or anything fried, since they use one fryer for all things fried. But most of the menu was available to me! I loooooved the mushrooms which were so rich and just lemony enough, and the cauliflower was nuts. Why don't I use fresh mint more often in my daily life? It took the cauliflower to another level and I could not get enough.\n\nFor my entree I had the \"Local Fish\" dish, and I seriously ate every bite. That's a huge deal for me -- I tend to leave half of my meal for take-home leftovers. But this was just too good... The catch of the day was halibut, and it was incredibly fresh and salt-watery without being fishy at all. So flaky and soft and moist. It's served with \"gigantic beans,\" which were hearty and rustic and gorgeous, plus marinated mussels. YUM. I got some shellfish in there! The best part was the skin of the fish... it was coated in fennel and pan-fried, so I had this perfect, crispy, aromatic skin that made every bite way better. I get a little weird about fennel sometimes because I'm not a huge fan of licorice-y flavors, but this application didn't make me think of candy... it was mild and bright and just right. \n\nFor dessert we all shared the panna cotta. I'm not a big dessert person (I always choose savory over sweet), but you guys.... this panna cotta was INSANE. I feel like I'm being so over-dramatic in this review, but honestly... I can't get over how rad every single aspect of our entire meal was. Service included. Our waitress was wonderful and she helped me out with all the gluten-free stuff, plus she made my bff feel comfortable and safe with his nut allergy. \n\nGo go go here any chance you get.", "author": "Kendall S."}

It was a breez to make reservations a couple weeks in advance for a Wed dinner at 6:15. Our table was ready for us when we arrived. We were seated in the upstairs area which is my personal favorite, as there is a lot more natural lighting up there.\n\nBased on my last experience, I knew to expect a couple of appetizers and entrees on their daily specials, and I wasn't disappointed. Our server reeled off a couple options for us, some of which sounded amazing. We ended up going with two appetizers and two entrees to share.\n\nWe started with an octopus and foie gras appetizers off their specials menu, which came in at $70 and $28 respectively. The octopus was pricey for the small portion size, but it was incredibly tender and probably the best octopus I've had in a couple years. The foie gras was served on a slice of sourdough bread and topped with a sweet strawberry sauce. I wasn't a huge fan of the sweet sauce, but it was an interesting way to eat foie gras so I appreciate the experience.\n\nFor our entrees, we went with the whole Liberty duck ($120) from the menu as well as a surf & turf ($195) from the daily specials. They brought out the whole duck before they cut it up so we could look at it and take a quick picture, which I thought was nice of them. However, when it actually came to eating the duck, it was a bit difficult as the pieces were cut up into awkward sizes and shapes. I quickly gave up trying to eat it with a fork and knife and picked it up with my hands. A lot of my friends did the same. The duck itself was also on the bland side. Probably my least favorite dish from this meal.\n\nThe surf and turf was interesting as it came with scallops, which I've never seen before. The steak was wagyu beef and came topped with some shiitake mushrooms and asparagus (gotta get your greens in!). The scallops were big and juicy and definitely my favorite part of this meal. I don't eat steak very often, but some of my friends thought the wagyu didn't taste as good as normal wagyu. Comparing this to the T-bone steak we tried last time, though, I think the T-bone steak was better if you're strictly comparing the steak itself.\n\nService was great, as always. We actually had the same server from last time who took great care of my friends and me.\n\nEnded up spending close to $100 here with a drink.", "author": "Dianna H."}

One of them had a group dinner here and wanted to repeat the experience, so I made reservations for seven of us. We were promptly seated and served upon arrival.\n\nNina Y. and I were the first ones there, so we started with some appetizers while waiting. We went with the crispy potatoes and cauliflower off the menu, both of which were tasty. When the rest of our crew arrived, my friend didn't need to look at the menu... he just asked for all the specials.\n\nI think there were five specials that day, and we ended up ordering four. Cockscomb really is best enjoyed family-style, which is what we did. I can't remember the names of the all the dishes we ordered, but they were all delicious! Everything from foie gras and pork belly to a whole catfish.\n\nFor dessert, there was a chocolatey one I wasn't too fond of, but the pineapple sorbet with grilled pineapple was one of the best things I've ever tasted. I would come back just for that, though I believe it was a limited-time special.\n\nAnyways, pro tips would include making reservations in advance and ordering off the menu of specials.

If I knew how to make kale taste as good as this I'd eat it more. \n\nCulotte steak was cooked more towards rare than med rare but no complaints here it was wonderful. I could have done without the sauce on top as I felt it took away from the premium quality steak. \n\nBoyfriend ordered the sole dish, but the waitress stated they were serving it with cod for the night.

Well, you can have a wonderful meal here without ordering items with exotic animal parts!\n\nI was able to get an 8:15pm reservation for 2 on a Saturday night with a few hour's notice.  The hostess initially seated us at the bar, but kindly moved us to a table upon request as the bar seats were a bit toasty from being close to the oven. \n\nWe had:\n* crunchy pigs ear and calamari- which was served with tarragon and citrus. It was a generous portion for two. Probably perfect for 3 as it IS indeed crunchy and chewy so splitting between 2 was a good hefty portion. I loved how the tarragon and citrus made this dish feel fresh and refreshing!  Hubs wished the pigs ear was saltier (probably more a la drinking food) but I thought it was perfect!\n* Octopus (daily special) - this dish was indeed special with the thick part of the tentacle being meaty yet tender, the tip of the tentacle being crispy. There was a hint of smokiness and a lovely spicy sauce to go with it. It was served on a bed of divinely crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside potatoes. This was an appetizer (1 large tentacle + 1 medium sized tentacle). This is probably one of the best things we've eaten this year!  It also came in at $70 for the dish. It's cheaper than a ticket to Europe (which I feel like is the only other place you could get octopus this good, if then!), but not for the faint of heart. The waitress had told us this price, but I had thought she must have meant $17 since it's an appetizer. \n* Spicy fennel sausage- I thought this dish was very well balanced between the sausage and the large pile of corn, tomatoes, shishito pepper it was served with. For me, the sausage by itself was too intense, but perfect with the corn, tomato, pepper.  Hubs who enjoys spicy food LOVED this sausage \n* the gnocchi- was a bit soft for me, but paired well with the sausage dish\n* we ended the meal with Chocolate Pot De Creme- this was a really nice way to end the meal!  It's chocolate pot de creme topped with toasted marshmallows, with a sprinkling of crunchy almonds between the pot de creme and toasted marshmallow.  The pot de creme is slightly bitter (they've added a touch of amaro to it) which pairs really well with the sweetness of the marshmallow.  This dessert had a lot of complexity both in flavors and texture. It was a wonderful combination of chocolate, slight nutty and crunchiness, along with the sweetness and different texture of the toasted marshmallow.  \n\nOverall, slight sticker shock from the octopus appetizer, but a wonderful meal!  The waitress was great in explaining the food -- very passionate and with gusto!  Also, one of the best meals we've had in the city so worth it in our book!  \n\nI will say the atmosphere is not a super smooth, refined atmosphere. It's hard to describe. It's got character and can be a bit loud, but we felt quite comfortable and pacing of service was good. \n\nFor people who love good food and enjoys a comfortable atmosphere with warm service and doesn't mind a louder dining room, we would whole heartedly recommend Cockscomb!", "author": "Kathryn C."}

And a badass.\n\nCockscomb is not for the faint of heart (or for vegetarians), but I'm completely convinced that anyone and everyone can enjoy their meal here (as long as they eat meat). Grossed out by the thought of pig ears or beef heart? If I could blindfold you and have you try the offal parts served here, you'd probably still enjoy yourself. For myself and a few of my adventurous eater friends, this restaurant was an absolute pleasure to dine at.\n\nSome of the things we ordered:\n- Crispy squid & pig ears: One of my favorite appetizers...possibly ever. The pig ear was so delightfully crispy and perfectly seasoned, and the squid wasn't tough in the slightest. The citrus, mint, and chili was a really beautiful compliment to everything.\n\n- Beef heart tartare: Enjoyed the tartare, but wasn't a fan of the grilled bread, which is probably my only negative criticism of the meal. The slices of grilled bread were just too big and just overpowered the taste of the tartare.\n\n- \"Hot Mess\" off-menu special: I wish I remembered the full details of this, but all I can recall is that it involved foie gras. Yum. It was delicious and rich as you'd expect. My only wish was that we ate it faster because it got cold fairly quickly.\n\n- Carrots with lebne + duck fat cauliflower: Great little sides that provided some fiber to a very carnivorous meal.\n\n- Roasted pigs head: A HUGE highlight of the dinner. It felt so primal seeing that entire half pigs head, eyeball and all, and then digging into it with our knives and forks. The skin was to die for - Amazingly crispy, crunchy, & savory. The meat was so tender that once you ate the skin, all the meat underneath just fell apart with a slight touch of the fork, and every part from the eye to the cheek tasted deliciously savory, rich, and all around just perfect. A bonus - A brain aioli dipping sauce for all of the skin and meat. Honestly this was one of the most decadent and most pleasurable eating experiences of my life. I took some of the leftover meat home and made fried rice with it the next day (highly recommend)\n\nOn top of all of this, service was fantastic, and our server was very attentive and friendly.\n\nI absolutely plan to go back to try some of their other unique meat-centric dishes like the whole duck or meat pie.", "author": "Sara L."}

For dinner, we ordered the oysters for apps and Pin Bone Steak (feeds 3-5) and three veggies sides. Veggie sides were on the small side but good, Pin Bone was awesome.\n\nYelpers let me down though by recommending the pineapple frozen thing which frankly sucked (and I like any dessert). It was this frozen pineapple with coconut ice cream and a crap ton of whipped cream with a side of super sweet grilled pineapple. Skip it. Also the service gradually tapered down to ignoring us when we were on the dessert. A little pricey considering we didn't order that much ($100/pp).", "author": "Karen S."}

I have been here before for dinner a couple of times before and the food has always been of great quality. The lunch menu is a shortened express menu and they have daily lunch specials which vary depending on which day of the week you attend. On Tuesdays they have a fried chicken special.\n\nWe were a party of four and we all decided to order the fried chicken sandwich. Note this is different to the chicken special and is actually a menu item. It was at this point however where our experience started to decline. The waitress asked us if we wanted our chicken sandwiches spicy and we said yes. When our food came out  we all got the chicken specials which was fried chicken with cornbread and coleslaw. Not the sandwiches we were quite expecting. 3 of us decided to keep our food as we were already quite hungry however one person requested it be made into a sandwich. \n\nAlthough there was nothing wrong with the special, we did not like how we were misled by the waitress when asked if we wanted our chicken spicy. We all assumed we would get spicy sandwiches.\n\nIn addition to this, we also ordered a few dozen oysters for the table. During the second dozen, our plates had been cleared quite quickly without being asked and we did not have any utensils left to finish our oysters. Not a big deal but during the busy lunch rush it was difficult to get the waitress to get more utensils. \n\nThe food was of the same great standard it always was (some oysters were disappointingly small) however the service left a lot of room for improvement.", "author": "Kathy L."}

Not heavy like it sounds, and a good amount of food.\n\nGnocchi: Quite possibly some of the best I've tasted. Nothing special about it, just yummy gnocchi with the perfect texture.\n\nHeirloom tomato salad: Of course my favorite part of this was the croutons #becausecarbs\n\nThe Hot Mess: I forget exactly what was on it, but it consisted of bread with foie gras on top and then meat on top of that. It was so rich, we couldn't finish it. This is nowhere a reflection of how it tasted, because I would order it again in a heart-attack heart beat - we were just stuffed already and could feel the fat coagulating in our throats. \n\nI'd definitely come back again, service was good and food was even better.

Right?\n\nLike NONE OTHER.\n\nI challenge you to find another high-end restaurant that puts a frickin' PIG'S HEAD right in the middle of your table.  Yes, yes, I get that Chinese restaurants have had whole pigs hanging behind glass since the beginnings of China Towns, and yes my friend Dorothy had a hugeass whole pig in her dinning room after her wedding, and Filipino yada yada yada...... no........ we're not talking barbarian style hunt and slay a pig to feed the tribe...  I am talking a nice trendy restaurant, with prices to match their high-end-ness, serving to all races of people, even the most squeamish, a PIG'S HEAD body removed...\n\nYeah?  Where?  That's right... So let's see what else we got:\n\n1. City of the Rose $13 \"Bieler rose wine, Cynar & dry vermouth\":  HORRIBLE.  Mostly tastes like cheap wine.  1/10\n\n2. Grilled Cheese $12 \"duck egg & honey\":  Another extremely disappointing serving.  Looks absolutely amateur for one.  Two sad looking pieces of stale toasts with cheese in the middle, honey dripping out like baby dribble.  Fried duck egg on top looks fine for a standard diner restaurant, for here... come on.....!  Doesn't taste much different than a chicken egg either.  2/10\n\n3. Whole Roasted Striped Bass $95 \"green bean almondine\":  So we learned the hard way that everything not served family style is probably crappy.  But they redeemed themselves with this fish!  Beautifully made, juicy, very crisp skin.  All X's crossed.  It's great.  Yes, I guess could be cooked a tad less to make the flesh even juicier, but it's still pretty good as it is.  Now get this--it's a whole fish but....... WHERE ARE THE BONES!?!?!?  Hell man, that's some kind of sick magic!  It's like a surgeon went in and removed all the bones in some mega operation, then sutured the whole thing back up!  Amazing.  Well done.  8/10\n\n4. Wood Oven Roasted Pigs Head $69 \"chicories, herbs & capers\":  Yes.  YES.  You want this.  You don't think you want this, but YOU WANT THIS.\n\nThis is probably the richest meat I've EVER had without getting that impulse to vomit.  ...(...um, maybe that doesn't sound so great... but I meant it as a good thing, really.)  The only thing I've ever had that was richer would be some Samoan food I had down in Carson--it was so extremely oily and fatty that I had to fight to keep it down after a few bites.  Really thought there would be a Samoan-style mess on the floor... after my eyes stopped tearing into the trash it all went. ...... okay okay... just saying... I've only had richer once.\n\nImagine... foie gras but instead of liver, it's face.  ...(.... okay... that didn't sound good either...)...\n\nUm, ...imagine beyond-ultra-marble Kobe beef, melting like butter just sitting on your plate, but with eyeballs on top........... oh... damn...\n\nI GIVE UP.  Trust me, you want this.  10/10\n\n5. Duck Fat Cauliflower $7 \"red fresno & mint\":  I think I was so struck with the fish and head that I totally forgot to eat this.  Seriously.  ?/10\n\n6. Latte $5:  Smooth, creamy, light.  6/10\n\n7. Fruit Bread Pudding $8:  The waiter called this a \"bread pudding.\"  Really, maybe it could technically qualify as bread pudding?  Maybe?  Pretty big stretch though.  But just think of it as a fruit-drenched cake with lots of cream, oozing with flavor.  Tastes awesome.  They could work on plating though--looks pretty amateur.  Also... I dunno, it's not really what I'd expect to have at a nicer restaurant.  Marie Calledar's perhaps.  Anyway, tastes good, but doesn't really belong here.  7/10\n\nIf you haven't been here, I urge you to.\n\nIf you call yourself a foodie, this absolutely must be on your list.\n\nAnd if you do not like this place, not that you have to enjoy everything they serve, but if you simply do not want to order every family-style dish they got...... YOU LOST YOUR FOODIE CARD.  Immediately shredded.  Go find yourself an Olive Garden or something...\n\n4/5\n\n#sanfrancisco #american #star", "author": "Dean C."}

Period. \nHow is it possible they have a solid four stars? \nWell where do I begin for them to get only one star from me? \nOh I know, the first let down was not having the Impossible burger for dinner, which was the ONLY reason we decided to check Cockscomb out. Why only serve it for lunch? The server said, \"Well if that's the only thing you came here for, you're out of luck because we only have it for lunch, but there's other places you can try that do serve it.\" Gently responding without coming off as a bitch I said, \"Well its 8:30pm and there's no way we would even be able to check out another place, on top of that you guys took a $20 reservation fee.\" Moving forward to an endless night it seemed like of kitchen mess ups and frustration; we proceeded to order. With not many vegetarian options directly visible, I decided to go with the grilled cheese and fried egg on top. I requested an over-hard egg. I'd say that that's the easiest way of making sure the eggs are not runny, yolky, or snotty; you get the picture. Well it took them THREE TIMES to get it right. I mean I am no chef by profession, but damn I would consider myself somewhat of a good cook at home and it does not take me three attempts to make a freaking over-hard egg. Every single time I cut into it, yolk spewed and oozed out all over the grilled cheese. Maybe some like it like that, but not me. It was unbelievable, the entire table was shocked at how many times they messed up. Ok so they finally got it right, the grilled cheese was good. I liked the honey on top, but because it took so long I already lost my appetite. It spiraled down fast from there and from there the dishes kept coming out. A kale and radish salad, cauliflower dish, artichoke (which made me choke), side mushrooms, side gnocchi with sage and butter, two $16 \"Ham\" burgers, oysters, the coulotte steak, bacon chop, and a $100 plate of crab. The only thing that everyone agreed they loved was the kale and radish salad. I mean all the veggie dishes were drenched in oil or butter not sure, but it was difficult to enjoy the vegetables! I'm so used to farm to table fresh veggies and this place is not that at all. I can't believe how awful the food was and not to mention I was only there for the Impossible burger, which I didn't get. A $600 bill that was not worth the oily veggies and an 'impossible' egg dilemma. Included was an 18% gratuity which was well deserved. The servers kept apologizing all night. All I got to say is the kitchen needs to get it together and think about making less artery-clogging dishes. Are they aware of the chemicals released from oils such as aldehyde that's linked directly to diseases and illness like cancer and heart problems in America? I couldn't put the fork to my mouth.

So when we planned to spend the Thanksgiving weekend in SF, we had to eat here again!  \n\nIts Saturday night, and of course, the place was packed.  As a result, our party of 10 was squeezed into to a table for 8.  So throughout the meal, we were asked to constantly lean in so the servers and patrons could pass through.  \n\nFor appetizers, we began with the beef tat tar which spread well on the toast.  However, that was not enough to hold us over for the next hour before receiving our main entrees of tuna collar, lobster, and pig head.  The pork was deliciously rich.  The accompanying crisp and fresh vinegarette salad helped reduce the heavy oil.  The skin was roasted to perfectly crispy crunch.\n\nThe tuna fin was moist and the meat fell off the bone.  Not much to review as I only got a small peice.\n\nLobster looked impressive.  However, there was very little meat.  The peice I did get was juicy, but this writer maybe slightly biased towards Chinese style of lobster and thus personally wouldn't recommend, particularly due to the $/oz of meat.\n\nLast but not least, dessert.  We had both the persimmon short cake and apple tart with aged cheese.  Cheese on an apple tart sounds odd, but according to the server it's a traditional English style and very good.  She was absolutely right.  The shortcake was equally delicious with the paper thin slices of persimmon topped with a sweet cream.\n\nIn conclusion, I had to reduce what would otherwise be a 5 star review to a 4 due to the long wait, inconvenient and tight  seating arrangements, and mediocre lobster.  \nThat being said, I would only return on a weeknight, and save the seafood for the restaurants on the pier.", "author": "Ken W."}

I realized that I'm not a huge fan of raw clams.  \n\n3. Pin bone steak (shared supper): this was the perfect amount of food for the 5 of us -3 boys and 2 girls. \nThe steak was nicely seasoned. The cook was a bit uneven. Some bits were rare while other parts were medium done. All delicious nonetheless.  \nIf I could order this again, I would see if I could sub out the potatoes. They were under seasoned but I think they may have tried to balance the saltiness of some cuts of steak with potatoes. \nThe herb salad they served with the steak was fantastic, I asked for more of this. \n\n\n 4. Duck fat cauliflower: ORDER THIS. This was so good. Just listen to me. \n\n5. Sunchokes: it was good but nothing to write home about.", "author": "Danni C."}

We got the huge sharing portion of the pin bone steak, tbh I thought it was just okay.. it was a 50 oz bone in steak and the meat was cooked unevenly, the main pieces were rare while all the other side pieces were overly cooked. I thought it was too rough and and the meat wasn't even tender. \n The appetizers and side dishes were amazing tho! The peach and tomato is refreshing and light. My favorite side dishes are the corn and potato. The corn is super tasty and potato is cooked to a perfect crisp.", "author": "Majes W."}

Every detail in the joint has a purpose - it's artful, and I appreciate that. \n\nWhat to Order:  \nDrinks: Any of the cocktails - but the Chef's Gin Jams is a rotating cocktail based on season. Fresh homemade jam is made per season and it's delicious with the gin. The drinks are also named after movies from the Bay Area (lovely detail, no!?) Great bar program! \n\nFood: The \"ham\"burger is one of THE BEST burger in SF. It's pork, not beef, and please add the egg. The crispy potatoes are also excellent\nAlso, be adventurous and if you see intestine or tripe, order it. Chef Chris is a \"use the whole animal\" type Chef so take advantage of his talents and try something new. \nThe Duck Fat cauliflower is also a crowd pleaser. \n\nDessert: \n If you did it right, you wont have room. But I have had a wide varoety and it's all good.

Sure, these are dishes that can be shared by 4-5 people, but they also charge $9 for a small plate of cauliflower.

I saw lots of couples on \"dates\", and while my friend and I vowed to bring our ladies with us the next time, this is not necessarily a \"date night endorsement.\" It just feels like there's too much life happening around you at Cockscomb for intimate banter.

We chose to sit at the counter (which I always recommend) since you can chat with the chefs and watch the magic happen.  Seeing how the food is created and watching how efficient an establishment is is always so intriguing to me.\n\nGetting to the burger, it really was unlike any other meatless burger I've had in the past.  It had the look and feel of actual ground beef, even the smell of the patty makes you think \"beef\".  There's a sear on the outside very similar to a beef patty and the pink interior is just like what a mid-rare burger would look like.  Being curious, i cut a piece of the patty and ate it separately and the texture is a bit different from a beef patty though; it's a bit more \"mushy\" but not off-putting at all.  Eaten as a whole with the bun, fixings, etc.,  it made me think I was eating a real beef burger.  Pretty amazing.\n\nThe burger came with a spring mix salad which was tasty.  We also ordered the house potatoes with aioli which was also tasty.  Nice, light crunch on the outside with a nice \"creamy\" potato interior.  It was a good sized bowl so we ended up not finishing it all.\n\nI don't get to the city as much as I used to but will hopefully be back here for dinner.", "author": "Mark Y."}

(and I LOVE BUTTER).\n\nAbout the impossible burger itself: I've now had it in several places, and the ones that are best are the ones that are cooked rare and with condiments that cut through the richness of the fat meant to stand in for the \"juice\" of a beef burger. This was cooked well, so turned out rather dry, and didn't have the benefit of the right condiments to round out the mouthfeel and taste. \n\nSitting at the bar/counter area meant watching the cooking happen. What was a bit awkward was that the part of the counterspace they used for laying out finished dishes was the same as the prep counter - which meant I ate my meal staring at a large platter of uncooked chicken.

Coming in at almost 4 lbs of bone-in steak, it will cost. Think about it... this is shareable from 3-5 people so it would be worth it for some great quality meat. It comes with au jus sauce and bone marrow dip. The bone marrow dip is to DIE for and a bit salty so it adds a lot of flavor. OH! DO NOT FORGET THIS. The steak comes out REALLY rare so please let your server know to cook your meat more. I couldn't eat a lot of it because it was so raw. She did not ask how we wanted it cook. Also, it comes with potatoes so don't order it as a side. \nCauliflower - We needed a vegetable and that was quite delicious. \nGnocchi - I've never had gnocchi before but I thought these ones were amazing. \n\nI came with 2 friends and we were stuffed from this meal.

I came to Cockscomb expecting amazing food and was extremely underwhelmed. I had a few friends tell me that they had \"meh\" experiences but I wanted to give it a try for myself. Sure enough, the food and experience was \"meh\" at best. \n\nI had the Impossible Burger and the Fried Chicken sandwich which were both severely over salted. I sat at the counter and watched the chef take a handfull of salt and throw it on the patty and I thought to myself \"this can't end well\". The impossible patty itself still tasted like a veggie burger (a lot of soy in it) - with all the R&D dollars, I was expecting a lot better. However, the patty isn't the restaurant's fault and I think it's cool that they carry it. The seasoning and preparation of the burger, however made the burger a lot worse than it is (I also tried the Impossible Burger in NYC and it was a lot better). The chicken sandwich, which I thought was practically impossible to mess up was also extremely salty and the bun was stale and cold. The sandwich had no structural integrity and it was one of the worst fried chicken sandwiches or burgers I've ever had.\n\nMy experience at Cockscomb was terrible to say the least, the only redeeming factors of this place is their service and their decor is nice (but their restrooms were filthy).

The food here is AMAZING!! \n\nI ordered the squid and melon appetizer -- so delicious and TBH, I've never had an appetizer with the combination of squid and melon.  The nuts and the sauce (can't figure out what the sauce is made of and I really want to know what it is) really complimented both those items.  For the main course, I also ordered a pin bone steak with foie gras (3 pieces) & the duck fat cauliflower. It was super pricey for the steak and foie gras ($185) but SOOOOO WORTH IT. I would definitely reorder the pin bone steak with foie gras again. The duck fat cauliflower is tasty as well.  it was not too salty and the cauliflower was still crunchy and not overcooked. \n\nIt was my friends birthday and I had put it in the reservation but no one really mentioned anything about her birthday.  At the end of the dinner, they surprised my friend with a birthday pudding and candle.  We were really surprised and full, but still enjoyed the complimentary dessert.  :) YUM!\n\nI wished I came here with more friends so that I can order more and try more dishes!", "author": "Esther A."}

I was here for a company party and it was a perfect venue for a large crowd. We shared large platters of different dishes. The Lamb and Octopus was my favorite, the Octopus being the better of the two.  The Cauliflower with Ducks Fat and Brussels Sprouts were really delicious.  \n  They lost a star because we asked if they could bring out a little more steak that was well done and they brought out a plate that was entirely fat. I mean there was not one little piece of meat, nothing but white grossly fat - that was wrong. They also lost a star because it was so loud you had to yell in order to talk. They put three large parties in one room and it was crazy loud. Other parties would be trying to give a speech while we were talking loud.  \n  I wish there were a little more choices on the menu to break up the meat dishes.

They take their protein very seriously (high quality, sustainably and humanely raised) and they don't shy away from bold flavors, which are both huge pluses in my book.\n\nCandice G. describes Cockscomb perfectly: this is where you eat like a Dothraki. Pure bliss as long as you don't limit yourself. \n\nMy friends and I came here on a Wednesday night during dinner peak hours. You'll need to make a reservation because the restaurant gets packed even on week nights. That being said, I made an online reservation the night before, so you won't don't need to plan months or weeks ahead like other restaurants in the city (perhaps you do for a weekend or Friday night reservation).\n\nFirst off, I love the decor of the restaurant. Very rustic furniture, big wooden tables, marble and comfy chairs, with an open kitchen that smells amazing against the cool brisk SF weather. They offer delicious cocktails, including my favorite gin and tonic (with fresh strawberry pur\u00e9e)! They offer sparkling or tap water, or both! Their open bar is pretty amazing with more cocktails than I had time to drink.\n\nFor those of you who haven't been here, Cockscomb is known for big plates New American-Italian style, to share over good conversations with old friends. The portions are meant to be family style and usually my friends and I wouldn't have it any other way. Their menu is decided into: 7 categories (wine and cocktail on separate menu):\n\n\"oysters and shellfish\"\n\"cured and raw\" \n\"starters and salads\" \n\"terrines\" \n\"shared supper\"\n\"offal and butcher's cut\" \n\"daily requirements\". \n\nDaily requirements are side dishes usually vegetables that is cooked in glistening animal fat. Honestly? I wanted to order and eat everything on the menu. Realistically? I'm coming back for more.\n\nBetween my friends and I, we ended up ordering too much food but that is usually as expected haha. The pig hearts were delicious! Definitely bigger, more tender and flavorful than I had thought. For starters, we shared the medium seafood platter of oysters ($48), Tombo crudo (hamachi crudo with interesting Asian inspired textures), pig skins with anchovy, olives and capers (this was amazing!). Both the smaller starters were $16 per.\n\nFor family supper slash big meat, we shared the beef heart tartar ($16), which was so interesting! Meaty, gamey with delicious marinade for the red meat offal. Their special of the night was a huge Wagyu T-bone shared supper. It was huge and smelled amazing. However, having recently returned from Japan where we had prized Wagyu and matsuzake beef, this was far less tasty and did not taste like Japanese Wagyu. While it was around $130, it wasn't nearly as good as what we had in Japanese because this was probably American Wagyu, another breed. It's also to be expected because even Wagyu in Japan is $$$ for a just few strips! Overall, it was still a delicious steak, superior to most I've had in America.\n\nAs for vegetables, our daily requirements were roasted duck fat cauliflower, crispy \"dirty\" potatoes, broccoli di ciccio and mushroom a la greque. All were delicious, well cooked and paired well with our rustic dinner bounty. Each daily requirement ranged around $7-9\n\nFor dessert, which we amazingly made room for, we shared the chocolate torte and another dessert which I don't remember anymore, other than they were tasty but were not mind blowing.\n\nOverall, great meal that is a pricey but nevertheless worth the splurge and experience! It's always a lot of fun to share a huge spread of mouthwatering food, family style, which Cockscomb is great for! Worth a return! The only regret I have was having not taken much photos of our meal bc it was too good!\n\nFYI, Cockscomb also does a New Years'\nSpecial tasting or meal package. It is definitely on the $$$$ side, however I heard it's delicious. My friends went last year and shared 4 boxes of lobsters with claws the size of a novel for us to try!", "author": "Jenny Z."}

In summary, you're paying for a Mercedes Benz SUV, but walkout w/ a Toyota 4Runner or Rav4. You can decide for yourself. Still good, but not great, especially for the price point. Came here around 9PM on a Saturday. Great atmosphere. Very friendly & attentive staff. An adequate variety of options on the dinner menu and there are daily specials not listed. Good selection of beers I'll say. \n\nWe got the gnocchi. 8 pieces for $9. Conclusion = waste of $9. Nothing wrong with them but I felt like I was just eating uncooked pizza dough covered in olive oil. \n\nGot the special waygu ribeye with dirty crispy potatoes and roasted corn. The corn was very good and had great flavor. The crispy potatoes were crunchy but not burnt and had the roasted pepper flavor. Sides were great. The waygu ribeye, which was the centerpiece of the dinner, was a huge disappointment. The waygu ribeye (see picture below) can easily feed 2-3 people. I would say two. It was priced at around $160. For that price and all the hype I heard, I expected more. \n\nThe steak was plated nicely in that it was on a huge wood board and overwhelmingly showered with peppers & potatoes. It was as if they were trying to hide something...the disappointment perhaps? It was all show. The few inner strips of the steak were cooked well, but the outer strips and edges were under-cooked and resulted in being very chewy. The steak itself was not hot/warm and borderline cold. Outside of the basic salt and pepper seasoning, this had nothing else. \n\nI understand sometimes you just want to savor the steak itself; however, for $160 and all the hype, in addition to the steak being unevenly cooked & cold, this steak was a miss. For a restaurant to be known for its meats, they failed to deliver. What we received was merely presentation and quantity rather than quality. The meat/steak is a chef's/restaurant's canvas and what you do with it, separates you from the rest. The end resulting canvas can be found at TJ Maxx HomeGoods. Nothing wrong there, I shop there. I don't believe they did anything different to separate themselves from any other restaurant or warrant the premium prices.\n\nI wouldn't come back here again not because the food was bad, but mainly because you're overpaying for the quality you get. I wouldn't put this on the blacklist of restaurants because they definitely do some unique things that I don't consider to generally be offered elsewhere, such as pig ears, beef heart tartare, and duck. So come check it out for yourself, but you've been warned.", "author": "Michael K."}

Love the industrial/farm animal design and it was energized on this Friday night. We ate upstairs, which I really liked - it's a noisy restaurant (are there any in SF that aren't?) and the smaller upstairs room is a little less so. Plus I like the big windows with the early evening light pouring in. I'm a sucker for a place where everyone seems super happy to be there and Cockscomb is that kind of place. We started with the tombo crudo - deliciously spicy, and the kale and butternut squash salad - perfectly dressed. I chose the roast chicken, not being as much of a red meat type as my husband and it was yummy - parsnips and escarole, crisp, flavorful chicken - some left over to take home, too. My husband had the coulotte steak with bearnaise and pronounced it \"perfect!\" Added a side of mushrooms a la greque and we were very happy campers. Since it was a birthday dinner, we also shared a delicious chocolate concoction that was just the right size. Our waiter, who was on point and funny all evening, pointed to the pineapple dessert on the table next to us when reciting the choices and said \"THAT is great to order if you're here with a group, but ordering that for two, I would call a suicide attempt!\" Nice wine list, great cocktails, REALLY fun, friendly, and knowledgable staff - all in all a wonderful evening and a memorable meal!", "author": "Lisa W."}

We ended up ordering entirely specials, which were to die for. \n\nApp was trotter w/ foie and fuji apples. Simply amazing, pure umami to start the dinner. Could have split it four ways and been just as satisfied. The girlfriend had never had foie before, so it was special from the get go.\n\nMain was a 14oz American Wagyu w/ sea scallops and XO sauce. Amazing. Steak was done to the perfect doneness (rare, like they just walked it by the grill) and the scallops were the best I've ever had.

Talking to Chris who came to our table after dinner and talk about the origins of food and his desire to have Cockscomb be known as a SF Brasserie was great. It's not often you can have that type of conversation. He spent a good 10 minutes with us chatting and gave me some great restaurants to check out in my upcoming trip to Washington D.C. (You'll have to wait for my reviews to see what his favorites are there :-). \n\nChris is a fantastic and down to earth person who loves food and sharing the experience. Thanks Chris for an amazing evening.\n\nREVIEW\nWe walked in and waited at the bar ordering a great Amaretto Sour as a starter drink and had a great conversation with the bartender on gins and small distilleries (they serve some great locals such as St. George's from Alameda along with some other great local distilleries.\n\nAPPETIZER\nFor starters we ordered the special for tonight called \"Hot Mess\". This was a plate of seared fois gras and pig trotters set in a wonderful sweet berry sauce that offset the richness of the dish.\n5 stars\n\nNext was the Grilled Cheese with honey drizzle and fried duck egg with a wonderfully creamy yolk that I popped and poured over the dish. I then flipped over the white to cover the top and cut it up in bite size pieces for the table. The cheeses were oozing out of the bread like a river of cheese working it's way around the bread on the plate. This is a do not miss dish if you like GC and want it with a twist.\n5 stars\n\nMAIN COURSE 1\nDuck, served with the most amazing grilled squash. This is not the typical green squash squash bit rather various types with mottled skin that tasted very much like sweet potato and regular potatos perfectly seasoned with just enough salt to mix with the sweetness of the squash. I was surprised how good squash can be if care is given to think about cooking it differently such as tonight.\n\nThe duck skin was crispy and the amount of duck meat was surprisingly large. This feeds 4 easily.  The duck meat was tender, we'll seasoned and set on top of some duck au ju.\n5 stars\n\nMAIN COURSE 2\nPin Steak serverd with bone marrow sauce! Oh yes you heard it right. This is a massive sirloin with bone, cooked and served from rare to med rare so everyone was happy. The meat itself was fantastically seasoned and could stand on its own.  However, after you pour the bone marrow sauce on it and take a bite you want to yell \" THIS IS AWESOME!\".\n\nI have eaten tons of steak and a lot of bone marrow in my travels but bone marrow sauce poured on your steak? Yes it is WOW.\n5 Stars\n\nSIDE DISH\nDirty Potatoes which are slightly fried potato whole and pieces lightly salted with creme fraiche and sweet hot red peppers. The peppers add some nice flavor and slight heat to the potatoes to really give you something different than your usual potato dish. Crispy outside and a nice soft center made this a great starch to go along with the meat.\n5 stars\n\nDESSERT 1\nChocolate flourless cake with pistachio crumbles and chocolate ganache. A very rich and semi sweet cake that was excellent. Smooth as silk, and topped with a scoop of caramel ice cream, this dish was done in 30 seconds by the 4 of us.\n5 Stars\n\nDESSERT 2\nLemon olive oil cake with fresh citrus fruits (grapefruit, oranges). This was very refreshing and light.  The olive oil cake was perfect, great smooth texture, and extremely moist. The citrus juices soaked into the cake for a mouthful of flavors. If you want to go light in dessert this is a great option.\n5 Stars\n\nCappuccino and Americanos were great. A nice layer of very thick and creamy foam topped our cappuccinos and the espresso was excellent.\n\nTIP: We came for the pigs head but they were out. Chris told me you have to come early (we had 8:30pm reservations) or call ahead and let them know you want one as it varies as to how many heads he can get daily. \n\nI will definitely be back to order the bacon chop and pigs head to finish off the large main meat dishes on the menu.\n\nAn amazing evening and incredibly well prepared food. Our wait staff were fantastic, friendly and engaging.  Causal dining has been taken to a new level at Cockscomb.\n\n5 STARS\n\nSong of the review: The Scorpions, \"Big City Nights\"\n\nChris, you rock!", "author": "Jay G."}

Both are expensive habits, so I try to ration my visits accordingly (but probably unsuccessfully).  So far, I've limited myself to special occasions to dine here (my wedding anniversary, the wedding anniversary for some friends, and to entertain out-of-town visitors).  \n\nFirst tip:  come hungry.  The portions are fairly big, but you want to try a bunch of different items.\nSecond tip:  make a dinner reservation, even during the week.  This place always seems full, even on random Wednesday nights.  Chef Cosentino is a big name in the culinary world, so plenty of tourists flock here.\nThird tip:  if you are looking for the \"Impossible burger,\" it's only served at lunch.  No dinner options for this popular (and curious) meal.\nFourth tip:  even though meat is the big draw here, leave some room for dessert.  After all the savory flavors, some sweet treats at the end of the meal are always welcome.\n\nSince the menu always changes, I will just highlight some of my most memorable dishes:\n\nPin bone steak:  one of the few non-rotating choices, it's listed under the \"Shared Suppers\" section.  And they are not kidding.  I've ordered this for parties of 4, and all 4 people need to be pretty hungry (and love beef) to finish this.  Served with a bone marrow dip, the steak is luxurious and food-coma inducing.  \n\nWood oven roasted pigs head:  always a head turner, this \"Shared Supper\" (also a menu staple) is not for the faint of heart.  The head of any animal is underrated by diners, with some of the most tender and flavorful meat inside the cheeks and neck of a beast.  The pig's head is no exception.  The skin was crispy from the oven-roasting and the meat among the most tasty I've ever had.  In addition, the dish is served with 2 different sauces on the side, both made from the pork \"drippings.\"  My wife & I shared this at one meal, but we had a difficult time sleeping that night, since that meal was so heavy.  You have been warned.\n\nCountry pate:  Sometimes this is offered by itself, other times as part of the charcuterie platter.  But it's the best pate I've ever had.  The meat is not so finely ground, but chunky instead, served with some very crusty bread.  I've been tempted to pick up an order of the pate to go and walk into AT&T Park with it, eating this while watching a Giants game (which would be SO San Francisco of me!).\n\nButcher's Choice:  this is usually one of the daily specials.  My favorite so far has been an order of cow udder, served with escargot.  I've never seen cow udder on any menu, but I plan to get an order every time it's available.  Literally, the best bite I've had here!", "author": "Jeffrey S."}

I got good vibes walking having high hopes for excellent food.\n\nMy only favorite item and highly recommend that you order is the grilled cheese. We ordered 5 items and it was the item I was least excited about ended up tasting the best. The bread and cheese ratio was the perfect balance. There was an extra flair of flavor added to the cheese that just made it that much more savory but what really impressed me and made the grilled cheese unique was the added honey! The marriage of this added ingredient was well thought out touch that made a grilled cheese become the life of the party.\n\nI was not impressed with the Bacon Chop. The fat ratio of the chop was extremely unbalanced and the texture of the Chop was not even a texture you can chew. Also not impressed with the Dirty Potatoes that everyone raves about. The spice was a bit strong and the the size of the potatoes was not cut to a proportionate size to the flavor. I was confused with every bite! The Pig Ears were ok. You need to put the lime on or the texture is just too dry and you don't get the max flavor.\n\nOur server Alicia was extremely attentive and pleasant which I appreciate and as that hard to find in SF. But the food overall was nothing good. I only truly enjoyed 1 out of the 5 items ordered.", "author": "Kevin C."}

I lauded him for pushing the comfort zones of diners by offering the parts of animals that we're unaccustomed to eating. Naturally, I was excited to try his newest restaurant iteration at Cockscomb a couple of days ago. Everyone from friends to online reviews suggested trying the pig's head. I was doomed from the start.\n\nNow, I consider myself a relatively adventurous eater, but I just could not get behind this shared plate. Maybe it was expectations versus reality, but you literally receive an entire roasted pig's head sliced sagittally. What I expected was something similar to Peking duck; meat served with a thin layer of crispy skin with accompanying sauce and condiments. Instead, it was just fat, and more fat underneath. Perhaps the only enjoyable part was the ear. After a few bites, I felt sick to my stomach over the amount of fat it had. I felt like a kid from that island in the Lord of the Flies. I would probably eat that head in that situation - only while stranded on a deserted island. Otherwise, serve me the duck or steak.\n\nOther than that abysmal main dish, the sides were average. I was neither too impressed by the sage gnocchi nor the duck fat cauliflower (of which was mainly stems). However, I did enjoy the starters including the grilled cheese with duck egg and honey and the beef heart tartare. It was a challenging meal to say the least, but I would return to try some of their other offerings.", "author": "Bailey Z."}

We headed upstairs to their bar for the happy hour and made it with 15 minutes to spare before 6pm. We ordered 20 of their $1 oysters, Crispy Pig Ears ($3), \"Dirty\" Crispy Potatoes ($4), and the Shared House Punch ($30). Although I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant, the service was lacking. Our bartender ignored us a couple times despite the fact that we were sitting at the bar directly in front of him. As for the food, it was okay at best. The pig ears were definitely crispy, but tasted quite mundane. As for the potatoes, they came out smelling absolutely amazing. But after biting into it, the insides of the potatoes were soft and lacked flavors. You have to eat it with the pickled peppers for a good spice and flavor, which was the best part of the dish. Lastly, the oysters were the most disappointing. They were tiny, sandy, and only came with the mignonette sauce (although we also asked for the house hot sauce). The mignonette had a hint of sweetness that I actually liked, but the oysters were just too sandy to enjoy. I was making sure I didn't swallow pieces of the shell or sand with each slurp.\n\nWe did get a good buzz off the punch bowl, which filled up four glasses for each of us. It was definitely made to be shared with four people, but we finished it. There was a lot of ice in it as well.

I organize all my team meeting lunches and this place was a regular on my list.  Not anymore.  \n\nLet me count the ways.\n1. We were a group of 12 and they have a $35 minimum per person, which seems a bit steep. \n2. The pig fries were disappointing. Not crunchy at all like I remember, but kind of chewy in an almost stale way. They were bland and sprinkled with too much wilted cilantro. And they should be hot! Such a let down on one of their signature appetizers.\n2. The special of the day was a hot fried chicken sandwich. It had no flavor or seasoning, and the chicken was drenched in grease. There was a jalapeno aioli on it but it was also greasy and flavorless.  Everywhere I looked, there was mounds of aioli on everything, even under the healthy tuna confit salad my coworker ordered. They need to take it easy on the aioli.\n3. I ordered a arugula salad with strawberry.  It was wilted from the overdressing. Now c'mon when someone orders a salad, do you think they want it drenched in oil? It should be lightly dressed and cold and refreshing. We picked out the strawberries.\n3. Our waiter insisted that the potato side was too small for 4 people to share and literally ordered enough for 20 people. It felt like he was taking advantage of the fact that we were a group. That is not cool. For comparison I had already ordered 3 of 2 different appetizers for our group of 12. He ordered 5 of the potato appetizer, even though it was quadruple in size.

From his TV show during the popular time till his famous restaurant in San Francisco and the charcuterie shop in the Ferry Building.\n\nOne thing I admire a chef is everything he does, he does it so well. So this new restaurant that's so popular every night at the bar and the opened kitchen. \n\nHe opened up about his fight with depression and all the celebrity status success he has on TV, how it all changed him to be a better man. And how he's now an advocate for other upcoming young chefs in this profession to deal with the pressure and hard work, brutal hours. \n\nI got so much respect for him and what he has been through. \n\nTalk about the delicious food he creates here at Cockscomb. \n\nThat chicken with sweetness skin dish was deliciously good. \n\nThe pig skin Amatriciana hits the spot, what diet? \n\nBeef heart tartare and green was bomb.\n\nPig head roasted, for the adventurous diners, you are in for a treat! I love biting on that pig ears, remind me of the food I grow up with in Saigon.\n\nAnything cured meat, is a MUST ORDER. Chef cured everything in house abs well as their pickles. \n\nThe food is delicious. The drink and wine list are fun. And the service is on point.\n\nAnd if you are lucky, you will see this humbled chef in the kitchen serving you a plate. \n\nParking can be a challenged here! So Lyft it!", "author": "Manda Bear B."}

When our waitress returned with our drinks we told her why we moved, she said it was \"all good\". Unfortunately, the young hostess felt differently. She went out of her way to come over to point out she noticed we moved and that \"it would have been nice to ask\". Seeing as to how the table wasn't occupied and she didn't seat anyone else at the other 2 top we vacated the entire time we were there her unnecessary need to come over and cop an attitude with us left a stain on our evening. \n\nBack to the reason why we came here. Our drinks were outstanding!The food was delicious and probably the best we ate during our visit to San Francisco.  I had the Coulotte Steak and he had the \"Ham\"burger.

Like, better than actual vegetarian restaurants do it. \n\nOf course, your options are more limited but I'd still say abundant and they don't go cheap on you with some salad or pasta dish. They KILL it and the truth is they don't have to. They're a meat place and everything from the name to sign will reinforce that but the Chef here still went above and beyond to create some incredible dishes for the non-meat and fish-eating friends and I really gotta give it up there because I've seen it done so rarely and even more rarely done well. \n\nOur server was too rad. I'd tell the table I'm waffling between some things because I want to ask about x and y and our guy would magically be right there with the answer just killing it. \n\nThe cocktails were sinfully good. \n+ I got the Pisco Punch (Pisco based punch with pineapple & Nutmeg) and at just $11 I would get it again every time. \n+ My second round was the Escape From Alcatraz (Sloanes gin, elderflower, mint, lemon, & elderflower tonic ) at $13 and it is potent and perfect and so well-presented that the rest of the table followed suit in ordering it as well. \n\nFor dinner my table split some stuff, most of which was meaty and hearty (literally, that lamb heart pastrami) and I did not partake but I did stuff myself with some notable delectable dishes. \n+ Broccoli Rabe Toast was something we shared but I wish I would've ordered my own because it was that good. \n+ The Grilled Cheese with duck egg and honey was the best grilled cheese I've ever had in my life. I'll be back for that, for sure. \n+ Gnocchi with sage and brown butter is crispy cream-yo-pants good.\n+ Duck Fat Cauliflower was grand and a great portion. A nice sharing dish to accompany the larger meat plates. \n+ The charred/seared (I forget, those drinks are potent) octopus salad was tasty but for me the salad just kinda got in the way of the octopus and slowed me down... which isn't always a bad thing, but next time I'd probably try one of the many other vegetarian and/or pescetarian dishes that I wasn't able to time. \n\nIs it on the pricier side? Yes but for that atmosphere, service, and food, I'd say they're pretty spot on in what they charge.

He was super friendly, just way overworked - so we ended up hungrily twiddling our thumbs for long stretches between appetizer and entrees. \n\nThe drinks were great --\u00a0we had a few of their house cocktails, really liked their gin and tonic. \n\nI thought the food was just okay. We had the dirty potatoes, coulotte steak, and bacon chop. The steak was good, but the bacon chop was too fatty for my taste and the dirty potatoes felt overly-seasoned + not crisp enough. \n\nThe tables adjacent to us both got the pin bone steak (giant $125 sharin' steak), which looked way more fun than our dishes\u00a0--\u00a0I'd try to coerce my dining companions into that if I come here again. \n\nThe price tags here are pretty heavy, which would be fine if they nailed the service/food, but seemed too high for what we got.", "author": "Ryan D."}

(5-6pm Mon-Thurs, in the upstairs bar area)\n\nCame here on a Wednesday to try their happy hour.  It is exclusive to their upstairs bar area. This restaurant requires reservations for the actual dining area, but luckily the bar does not! \n\nMy friends and I ordered their $1 oysters, Crispy Pig Ears($3), Crispy Potatoes($4), and Grilled cheese($6).\n\nThe oysters were just alright. They were really small and kind of forgettable. If you are craving oysters, there are better places in SOMA for fresh oysters.\n\nEverything else that we ordered was super delicious. The pig ears were nicely seasoned and crispy. A perfect \"bar\" food which goes well with a drink.  The crispy potatoes were topped with a ham puree and some sort of cream.  They give a decent amount for the price you pay for.  The highlight of the entire happy hour was definitely their Grilled cheese. It was simply amazing.  The bread is soaked in a slightly sweet honey with decadent melted cheese.  Definitely order this if you ever go to their happy hour.\n\nFor drinks, I tried the Calicraft: Winter sparkling ale.  It was a lighter beer which paired really well with the food their offered for happy hour. And for only $5, it was a great deal.  \n\nOverall, their happy hour is definitely worth it. I have yet to try their dinner menu, but maybe some time in the future.  Don't let the $$$ scare you away from trying their reasonably priced happy hour. You won't regret it.", "author": "Jacky C."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2017-01-04", "description": "I love good food and great restaurants, but I don't follow names of chefs.  I have heard of Mr. Cosentino but that is not why we ventured in.  I simply liked the brave offerings on their menu and simply have heard enough good things from their execution.\n\nI like the look of the space, very casual.  Busy and loud on the ground floor, due to the kitchen and probably where the regulars hang out.  Urban loft look upstairs with dark, minimalist tones.  Urban art is riddled throughout the space, which I liked big time.\n\nStarted with Oeufs Mayonaise ($13) which is their deviled egg rendition.  Great, one of the better ones I've had.  Super creamy yolk that was bursting with seasoned egg flavor.  Nice herb mayo on the bottom of the plate to make it even more creamy and indulgent.  And a tiny sliver of crisp chicken skin as a garnish was a nice touch.  Almost wished there were more.\n\nSipped on their house Martini ($12) and it was extremely spot on.  Quality gin, herby vermouth and briny olives.  Chilled and perfect.  Stuck with these for the duration of the whole meal to counter all the richness of the food.\n\nSmoked Oyster Chowder ($14) was on special and we couldn't resist.  Execution was precise and kraft-worthy.  Creamy with the perfect consistency.  Skillfully diced tender Yukon potato.  And maybe 3-4, mildly smoked oysters.  So mild that some of the oysters had a rawish texture.  And when put all together, made for a stellar soup course.\n\nSince it was our first time, we indulged in their Half Pig's Head Dish ($69).  There's 2 things about this dish;  1) it is pretty hardcore and not for casual meat eaters;  2) it is a lot of food that can be shared amongst 4 people.  There were only 2 of us, so we didn't even come close to finishing it.  But they pack things up nicely.\n\nI've had many different pig parts in my time, but I've never had all parts of the head before me.  It was good, real good.  But it is just so rich with fat and sticky gelatinous tissue that you seem to get your fill pretty quick.  Our version, the skin was really crisp.  So crisp it was hard to carve.  Super tasty, but super sticky on the tooth.\n\nWe enjoyed the diverse textures and flavors of the different areas.  Ears, cheeks and jaw muscles are all so different.  2 sauces came with, one an herbaceous jus and another some creamy mayo.  Both really good.  Lots of chicory salad to accompany, which is a great contrast to the rich meat.\n\nFor dessert we chose their Pineapple Upside Down Cake ($7) rendition, and I loved it.  It was a total twist on most other versions.  First the cake seemed like it had cornmeal or polenta in it, a little gritty.  But the slightly sweet corn flavor was great.  Some dried berry on top (could be currants or dried blueberry) along with the pineapple added the tart fruit component while soft cream tied everything together.  Very nice adult oriented dessert, sugar levels totally in check.\n\nNow that I've knocked the pig's head dish off my culinary bucket list, I can now venture into the rest of their menu.  Their family style dishes all sound so good, from a sharable pin bone steak to a pork belly and scallop platter that seemed intriguing.  Man, I just can't wait for the next outing.\n\n*looks in calendar for next special occasion*", "author": "D.wight L."}

I actually dined here twice over the weekend because all I wanted was the \"Impossible Burger.\" I came on Friday evening, only to discover that Cockscomb serves it ONLY for lunch Mon-Fri. I repeat, the Impossible Burger is only served Monday through Friday at lunch!!\n\nThat being said, the server that Friday evening made the Impossible Burger sound so tasty and intriguing that I had to come back on Monday. Luckily it was a 3 day weekend, otherwise there would have been no way to try it. This restaurant can only serve it at lunch because the other restaurant, Jardiniere (sp?), only exclusively serves it at dinner... kind of ridiculous....\n\nSo back on dinner experience... it was okay. Server was super nice, and my friend and I split a few dishes and dessert. Because my friend was pescetarian, we were limited to options which I think weren't really the star dishes of the restaurant. We got the spaghettini, which was herbal-y and simple, roasted carrots with dates, which was delicious, and the grilled cheese, which had a nice sweet twist to it w/ the honey. Reflecting back on that meal, that was a lot of carbs/sugar, haha. Afterwards, we had the flourless chocolate cake which is super chocolately and paired very nicely w/ vanilla ice cream. \n\nFast forward to Monday... I made reservations for lunch and we didn't get seated until 15+ minutes after our reservation time... I could see a couple other parties getting frustrated about getting seated late despite having reservations. I also noticed serve that day was extremely slow... \n\nAnd now... we finally got the Impossible Burger! It's good, but as someone with no dietary restrictions, it's not as good as a normal patty. It kind of creeps me out that I'm eating something synthetic. But it's still fascinating, and a good experience. Also, keep in mind even though the burger is vegan, it's quite oily with all the coconut oil... and the patty is crumbly and squeezes out easily. \n\nPersonally, I wouldn't come back to eat the burger again, but do recommend people to give it a try. It's also pricy, for $20...", "author": "Janet H."}

Heck, we're eating at the winner of Top Chef Master's restaurant, and so we're expecting to have a unique and tasty experience, and we do.\n\nIf you were in San Francisco on March 12, 2016 you know that it rained gently for a good part of the day, and then hard for a good part of the day.  As we are tourists, we had planned for a long walk that included parking near Cockscomb, a walk to the Ferry Building for the farmer's market, a walk down to Pier 33 where we can get on our Alcatraz 'cruise' to the island, and then we tour the island and then our day concluded with the walk back to Cockscomb.  Sounded like a great plan, and it was, and it's all being shared here so that you appreciate that we showed up at the restaurant early and soaked... They opened about five minutes early so we got some reprieve from the weather.\n\nWe had requested the opportunity to watch the chef's work, and so we were able to sit right at the kitchen and chat with the chefs as they were working. This was great, and I'd highly recommend this to you if you're interested in food, asking questions and chatting, and at this restaurant you'd better be prepared.  The chefs are not shy.  We spoke with probably five or six different people working in the kitchen and we found them all personable and fun.  I'm sure it's the culture that's been created at the restaurant, and, for me, it's a great culture.  The Top Chef was not in the night we were there, and yet his crew carried on.\n\nOn to the food, and know that the menu is very tempting.  My wife and I ended up selecting the 'bacon chop', as we planned to share it. We also ordered sides of cauliflower braised in duck fat, gnocchi, and grilled broccoli.  The 'bacon chop' is huge.  Picture, if you will, a New York steak that's thicker and longer than the biggest New York steak you've ever had.  My wife at a third, and I was forced to eat the other two-thirds, but I was able to suffer through it.\n\nTo summarize, we enjoyed everything, and Cockscomb is now on the short list of places we'd return.  I was surprised in San Francisco though, as we mentioned to people that we were going here for dinner, and they didn't seem to even know it exists.  As far as I'm concerned, that's good for us.  On the Saturday night that I was there, it was crowded and I'm sure that's good for the restaurant.  I like a place that can stay open, make money, and maintain quality, and this place seems to be doing that.", "author": "Thomas E M."}

We started with a beer and the only cocktail on their HH menu, a Negroni they have on tap. I've never had one before, so I thought I would give it a try. Wrong choice - good thing it was only $5 and my roomie's bf polished it off when they joined us later on.\n\nFood: From the HH menu, we ordered a dozen of their $1 oysters and their crispy potatoes. The oysters were pretty solid and I liked the sauce they served with it - very refreshing. The crispy potatoes were pretty good, but that leads into my one complaint that I'll save for later. Once my roomie joined us, she ordered the grilled cheese, which was pretty solid. Crispy, buttery bread, and just the right amount of cheese.\n\nDrinks: $5 HH specials were pretty decent. Mostly a beer place bc they only have the one cocktail special.\n\nAmbiance: Pretty cool. I like how they renovated the interior of such an old building. Very light and airy, though I did notice that my hair smelt a little like smoke just from the 3 min of standing by the wood fired kitchen area.\n\nOk, here's my one complaint: When we ordered the crispy potatoes, I took a snapchat picture to send to my roomie. When my bf and I first looked at it, we didn't see the ham puree on top and so we kept eating and figured it might be at the bottom. When we got halfway and my roomie showed up, we compared my snapchat to the other pictures on Yelp and YUP, NO HAM PUREE! Where there should have been distinct peaks of a brown mouse, there were none! I showed the waitress my snapchat picture and she literally glance at it for a millisecond and then said, \"It's there!\"  Um NOPE! I feel like she should at least give us the benefit of a doubt, aren't customers supposed to be right? Yes, the dish was half way eaten, but I had a picture from before we even touched it!

My sister and husband, however, assured me that their drinks were top notch.\n\nWe ordered a bunch of sides to share, including the Hot Mess special and Dirty Crispy Potatoes, which had a bit of a kick and damn good.  \n\nBut, the highlights were the Shared Supper Special of Cioppino and Whole Roasted Pig's Head (actually, only half a head).

A word of warning, however . . . it is so rich and fatty that I wouldn't recommend ordering it, if you only have a small party of 2-3 people (though the waiter says it feeds 2-3).  I couldn't imagine this being my main course, even with sides.  I think it only makes sense to order it with a large group, so you only have a few bites.\n\nWe also ordered a Chicken & Waffles plate for the kiddo.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2016-01-18", "description": "I had such high expectations of dining nirvana here but it was just not meant to be. I remember enjoying Incanto's head-to-tail dinner during Chris Cosentino's early days as its chef. I had not tried his latest venture before New Year's Eve when they were offering a special $110 four-course prix fixe dinner. Surely this was an optional choice. No, it wasn't. Since I made the reservation just two days in advance, I was left a message that there was a no-cancellation policy and that the prix fixe menu was mandatory. It struck me as rather restrictive, a reason to give me a case of pre-meat sweats. Would Cosentino's chops be worth it?\n\nNow understand that since I tried Incanto over a dozen years ago, Cosentino has become a celebrity chef as he became a constant presence on the Food Network and the ultimate anointment, a friend of Anthony Bourdain when he came to town looking for local eats. So when Jamie W. and I entered the restaurant, the former Zuppa, we saw his staff hovering around him like acolytes near the grill oven (photo: http://bit.ly/1SYZAG7). We were squeezed against a banquette right next to a trio of obnoxious twenty-something hipster wannabes bellowed their conversation like it was a decibel-challenged nightclub. Cocktails were needed immediately.\n\nJamie ordered the $11 Pisco Punch, a sweet Peruvian elixir with pineapple and nutmeg added to the mix (photo: http://bit.ly/1V27tcD). I went for the more clubby $12 Boothby, a blend of cranberry juice, Douglas Fir bourbon, sweet vermouth, bitters and sparkling wine (photo: http://bit.ly/1NguYZG). It was almost enough to distract me from the 'dude'-laden dialogue inches away from us. For the first course, Jamie tried the Parsnip & Smoked Haddock Chowder, a buttery-salty blend that was indeed velvety good and gone all too soon (photo: http://bit.ly/1n6TzLa). I went for what I presume to be a Cosentino specialty, the Foie Gras Torchon with Cranberries & Brioche (photo: http://bit.ly/1PbtRC1).\n\nExcept for the sweetness of the cranberries, I found the foie gras quite bland and not lusciously addictive. The second course brought salads. Jamie tried the Castel Franco & Ricotta Salata with Olives (photo: http://bit.ly/1PlTeL7). Castel Franco is a mild form of bitter radicchio that was overwhelmed by the amount of ricotta shavings on the plate. Mine was the other choice, the Butter Lettuce with Hazelnuts & Blood Orange (photo: http://bit.ly/1PlTcmq). It tasted like a standard steakhouse salad, inoffensive and tasty enough but nothing more really. The entrees came next, and we knew this was the make-or-break point of our evening since Cosentino, by all accounts, knows his meats.\n\nJamie ordered the Pork Belly, Clams & Buddha's Hand Citron Salsa (photo: http://bit.ly/1OsmYZr), an odd surf-&-turf combo that just didn't quite mesh despite the richness of the belly. The citrus flavor of the salsa added another idiosyncratic note that made Jamie's shoulders shrug in indifference. I went for the Ribeye with Bone Marrow & Spinach, and at last the steak delivered the goods in its tender preparation and meltably good texture (photo: http://bit.ly/1ZwtnFZ). Strangely I would have thought the bone marrow would mean toast wedges would be forthcoming upon which to spread the marrow. When I inquired about this, I received a puzzled look of acceptance and then about ten minutes of radio silence.\n\nWhen he did come with the grilled bread, I was done with the marrow and rather perturbed to find my request added to the bill later for $2. I just think for a restaurant at this exorbitant price point, a simple piece of bread could have been made complementary. Oh well. We moved to our final course, the dessert, and they were reasonably satisfying treats. Jamie had the Chocolate Cremeux & Golden Marshmallows, a mousse-like creation with its sole marshmallow given a bit of gold leaf (photo: http://bit.ly/1OB6GeK). I went with the Baked Apple with Gorgonzola & Honeycomb (photo: http://bit.ly/1PBxsDH). It was just half a small apple given the peasant treatment, but it was enough.\n\nNearly $300 later, we felt somewhat disappointed. It was less about the quality of the food which we didn't question but rather the indifferent manner which was pervasive throughout what should have been a more festive evening. The restaurant never did crowd up while we were there, and while we didn't expect Cosentino to stop by, it would have been a nice gesture. However, I could say the same about the staff overall since we didn't feel much warmth though it was clearly thrown at other diners around us. Alas, maybe we'll try the regular menu sometime as the burger looked like a good deal, but frankly we're in no hurry.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...considering Cosentino's reputation, marginally disappointing especially given the price point\nAMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...doesn't look much different than Zuppa but that's fine\nSERVICE - 3 stars...didn't feel the love\nTOTAL - 3 stars...it should be more than the meat, right?", "author": "Ed U."}

And felt very welcome by the restaurant in terms of being vegetarian friendly.\n\nWe were delighted by the kale/butternut squash salad (the \"birdseed\" is out of this world), the charred beat entree (so filling and a different take on beets with full flavors and hefty portions), and the Chinese broccoli side (one of my favorites, they charred the basil on the side which gave it some amazing herby and umami notes). We did the vegetarian version of all these, did not opt for the vegan accommodations they offered.\n\nPLEASE NOTE- the Impossible burger is not available at dinner.\n\nSO, OF COURSE in our 4 day trip to SF, we made ANOTHER reservation at LUNCHTIME two days later to try the Impossible burger.\n\nThoughts on the Impossible burger- a good hack of a lean meat burger with some yummy gouda cheese and pickles on top. However, the \"doneness\" of the burger really seems to vary a lot between diners (our table ordered 4 impossible burgers) and mine was sadly more well done so I could not see the famous \"heme\" or raw red showing through. All in all, it was really worth trying, however I had to stop with a few bites left to go because it seemed too much like meat! Veggies rule.\n\nAlso- excellent mocktails.", "author": "Jessica L."}

Having learned from the first time, we requested potatoes instead of a pile of lettuce as the accompaniment.  Our waiter told us it would be less expensive to make an order of potatoes than to substitute for two sides.  Why the regular burger comes with potatoes and the Impossible Burger doesn't, makes no sense.  My waiter the first time at Cockscomb had said it was because the Impossible Burger was ordered by vegans -- but potatoes are vegan, typically.  Anyhow, the Burger was not as good this time as last.  My friend thought it tasted like a veggie burger, which is decidedly not the point.

You get seated \"at the bar\" which happens to be upstairs. There are two levels and the entire interior is so beautiful with a rustic charm. \n\nGetting to this place was a little confusing since the entrance was sort of in an alleyway/side street. Once we went in, the greeter directed us upstairs and we picked seating by the curved counter. The natural sunlight from the top makes for some nice photos. :)\n\nOYSTERS $1/each: I thought the oysters were delicious but a bit on the small side. Granted it is not oyster season since the rule I just learned from my good friend Google is eat oysters on any month with an \"R\". Oops. But that won't stop me from getting my happy hour on. Amazing mignonette that comes with the oysters. Would definitely recommend getting a whole dozen for yourself.\n\nCRISPY PIG EARS $3: Yum! Crispy and slightly chewy. The lime adds a nice touch. Besides a bit of chili flakes, there also is some basil leaves and cilantro tossed in. \n\nGRILLED CHEESE $6: Honey, I think there's a contender for best grilled cheese I've ever had. And it might be because of the honey. Duck egg and honey sounds like a fancy combo and really, it is the best thing to have ever been combined. It was grilled perfectly on both sides. The honey gives it a nice sweet start and finish and reminds me of eating French Toast but at the same time a grilled cheese sandwich. The duck egg seemed to be soft boiled and it gives the sandwich a nice salty balance to the sweetness of the honey. Bless this grilled cheese and bless all of the future grilled cheeses I would be eating here at Cockscomb from now on.

So I'm guessing this place may get packed regardless of what day. However for happy hour (5-8pm Mon - Thurs) the top floor was pretty spacious and we had no trouble finding 3 seats at the bar. Waitress was very nice and asked for last call orders as we got there 15 minutes before happy hour ended.   \n\nTop floor had a very nice top down view of the rest of the restaurant which is nicely decored with a hipster wooden clean modern barn feel. Really enjoyed my sights during this meal. \n\nGREAT LITTLE SNACKS THEY GOT HERE.\n\n$1 oysters (miyagi size). These were the main sellers on the menu, however the least of my favorites out of all the dishes we got. To me, they had a too salty after taste to my liking to and to my experience. Wasn't the best I've had. \n\n$5 Honey Grilled Cheese - This was amazing. I almost ordered another all to myself. The toast was likely grilled with honey first so that it was soaked into the bread and the crusted the top while the cheese was later melted inside. So, much, cheese, porn. \n\n$3 Fried pig ears - first time getting pig ears an American restaurant. Usually get them at a Chinese restaurant. My oh my these were good. I like the rubbery texture with the salty crunch that is balanced with a little lime. \n\n$4 Crispy Potatoes - These were great omg. Perfect crisp to soft potatoe ratio. They also have this gravy and mayo sauce that makes everything the more sumptuous. \n\nAs for drinks, all drinks are like $5, I usually get wine, but my friend didn't really enjoy his cocktail. \n\nWould have been a 5 star if it wasn't for the oysters.

Be ready to do some sort of cardio before or after because the pig's head consists of mostly fatty goodness and crunchy pork skin!  They provide a large bowl of vinegary sauce on the side to thin the fattiness of the pork bites and aioli dipping that is made of brain parts!  This is the most interesting dish ever because I didn't know if it was a good splurge on getting my cholesterol level off the roof or not. \n\nTo top the fattiness off, we ordered up duck fat cauliflower and raw oysters as an opening appetizer.

I don't know what the cheese was, but it was magic and then drizzled with honey and topped with a duck egg. \n\nOkay! So besides the grilled cheese, we ordered quite the selection for only two people. Because I've might've drank a considerable amount of adult grape juice, only a few dishes stood out. The calf liver (which was a special for the night) was delicious. It was cooked perfectly (slightly pink in the middle) and served with a mushroom sauce. We also ordered the pigs ear terrine as an appetizer, but I honestly didn't think it was that great. The best way I could describe it is like... a pigs ear prosciutto, but with no flavor. It actually reminded me of Vietnamese food, which I could get for a lot cheaper. The one thing that we HAD to get was the roasted pig head. It was tender and fatty with a crispy skin BUT it was way too much for just two people. \n\nWith all that being said, the service was up to par.

The Impossible Burger is incredible and is a must try even if you're a carnivore. \n\nMy vegetarian brother came to visit from Kansas City so I had to do a little bit of research to find some good vegetarian grub because I can't take him to my usual favorite places where they have limited vegetarian items. This is one of two restaurants in SF that serves the Impossible Burger so I made a lunch reservation for us to check this place out. \n\nOur server was sweet but didn't seem very knowledgeable about the menu. I asked her to please point out the vegetarian items and she pretty much just said they had the Impossible Burger and not much else. Great way to fail on making a sale because I'm sure the kitchen could have left out some meat accoutrements if a special request was made. We ended up reading the menu ourselves to figure out what didn't have meat and I confirmed with her they were vegetarian before putting in the order. \n\nOur meal started with the gnocchi with sage brown butter and the house potatoes. Gnocchi was soft and fluffy and covered in awesome sauce i.e. brown butter sauce. House potatoes came perfectly crisped and brown on the outside with a delicious horseradish aoli that had a nice kick. For entrees we ordered the grilled cheese with duck egg and honey and OF COURSE the Impossible Burger. The grilled cheese must be eaten all together as in you must get a bite of the grilled cheese with the egg and honey to maximize deliciousness. Best part of the meal was without a doubt, the burger. It looked just like meat but texture is different from what you would expect from a plant based burger patty. It tasted to me almost like cut up shiitake mushrooms and had an incredible umami that's hard to describe. The pairing with the house made bread and butter pickles as well as mustard and cheese were just perfection. You have to go try it for yourself! We ended our meal with the chocolate dessert which was just a block of chocolate fudge with some cream and pistachios. I was expecting cake and am not a fan of fudge in general so didn't enjoy dessert at all. \n\nRestaurant is not very big so seating is a little tight. Be prepared to get cozy with your party and neighboring table! My one and only major complaint about this place is the lack of window coverings. Depending on the time of day, at least one person is screwed and will have the sun directly in their eyes because of the layout and lack of blinds or shades over the windows. We ended up finding one spot behind the hostess stand where it was shaded and requested to move. I would have been pissed if we were forced to stay where they initially sat us because my husband would have had the sun in his eyes the entire meal. \n\nStreet parking is available but limited so best way to get here is probably by Uber or Lyft, or MUNI if you don't mind walking a few blocks. They lock the doors before the clock strikes 11:30a so don't bother getting there too early for lunch because you'll be waiting outside in the cold. \n\nDecor is really unique and has a sense of humor. You must check out the bathroom if you go and don't forget to open the medicine cabinet/mirror to take a peek! Hilarious!", "author": "Betty R."}

It was almost 10 pm by the time the server David S. took our dinner order.\n\n(Fact) When I ordered the seafood platter, David informed me that they sold out on crab. I agreed to substitute the crab for some tuna tartar / poke thing. Definitely, not even comparable. \n\n(Fact) When I got to the shared Supper portion Steak, David informed me that they were out. So I ordered the Pigs Head. David informed me they were out. So I ordered the Coulotte Steak, David informed me they ran out of all beef items. I informed him of our table of 4 disappointment. I asked him what do they have since the menu was so limited. He suggested that they had a shared Pork Chop dish. It was 10 pm and our entire table was hungry and disappointed at the events and to be frank if weren't so late I would have got up and left. We settled for the Pork Chop dish. \"oh what a mistake\"!! A $75 mistake. It was as tough as any baseball glove I have ever owned and it was 50% fat. As we left there was over 3/4 of the dish left. But note to Chris Cosentino my dogs loved it.\n\n(Fact) The one other notable failure is the sausage which was so salty that what was left the critters in my neighborhood.\n\n(Fact) After the disappointment with the nights events, I wanted to take to yelp and write the review, but I thought the manager or the owners would want to know about our experience. So I waited till 5 pm on Monday when they opened again and spoke to Stephen the manager. When I told him the time of our reservations he was able to pull up the info. I informed him of running out of all the different items. If Cockscomb was unprepared to serve that late then they should not have taken the reservation so late, and on top of that people were still getting beef and crab after our designated 9:15 pm reservations. Stephen's response was \" we had a unexpectedly busy weekend\". He repeated this 3 times through out our brief conversation until I had to repeat it back to him. \"No apologies.\" He said he would bring it up to the attention of the \"higher ups\". and get back with me. \n\n$330 for a meal of salted pork fat and lard.", "author": "George F."}

I finally made it to Cockscomb after having it on my list since they opened. I was able to make reservations a couple days before for dinner on a Saturday night at 8:30pm for a party of 4. We were running about 15 minutes late, and they were super accommodating about pushing our reservation back. Our table was ready when we arrived, and I love how you can see the open kitchen from any seat in the restaurant. We tried:\n\n-Grilled Cheese (Duck Egg, Honey, $12, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dVXnplIjbeppj50nVvbKAg&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Yum- their grilled cheese had the perfect cheese to bread ratio, and we were all surprised at how well the honey worked with the sandwich. A must try!\n-\"Ham\"Burger (Caramelized Onions, Tomato, Gruyere, Served w/Crispy Potatoes, $15, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=Ztg96lLfoQRq9plDBg_69g&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): This is an interesting take on the traditional hamburger made with beef, since they make the patty with ground pork instead. I liked the combination of ingredients for the burger, but the patty was a bit on the dry side so I probably wouldn't get this again.\n-Duck Fat Cauliflower (Chili, Garlic, Mint, $7, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=VdurBvGMkisR5cwc1A1j7A&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Very interesting combination of ingredients, and we all liked the mint in this dish. \n-Chinese Broccoli (Garlic, Shiso, $7): Good, but only get this if you like bitter tasting vegetables, since the chinese broccoli (gai lan) is on the bitter side.\n-Summer Squash (Oregano, Chile, $7, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=hrKO92EwgwoIUXIIcPtUNA&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Just ok for me since I'm not a huge fan of squash. I wish the pieces were smaller so more of the piece was seared instead of the mushier squash consistency- skip!\n-Fruit (Polenta Cake w/Plum Jam, Figs, Wrapped in Fig Leaf, Drizzled in Olive Oil, http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=BgY_JWRewABAGz2QlKYn7Q&userid=76vIFZcC7owykCBjMfGVXg): Another unique item, and I liked this more than I thought I would. The polenta cake had a grainy consistency, but the flavors were really good, and I loved the plum jam, figs, and fig leaf. Recommended!\n\nA few people ordered the pin bone steak, which they slice and serve on a platter, and it looked amazing!! I would definitely recommend ordering this if you're here with 2-3+ other people, since it feeds 3-5. The chocolate dessert also looked really delicious, and we were torn between ordering that and trying the polenta cake. Our server was great- super friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes. Parking wasn't bad in this area later on a Friday night, and there were a good amount of street parking spots available.", "author": "Amy D."}

It exemplifies all things SF - the location, the decor, the hyper local ingredients, and especially the Impossible Burger (only at lunch).\n\nIf you aren't familiar with the Impossible Burger - here is the elevator pitch...  An impossible burger is a vegetarian burger that has the taste and texture of traditional beef hamburger. Environmentally friendly, the impossible burger is made from \"heme\" which is extracted from soybeans and fermented in yeast.\n\nI've been here several times for the Impossible Burger(lunch time reservations are highly encouraged) and I'd say the burger isn't going to fool anyone soon, but it's also far better than a bean or veggie burger.\n\nBut as with all things Silicon Valley/SF, the secrecy around the impossible burger is overly precious. You are not allowed to take any of the Impossible Burger out, even if you can't finish it, you aren't allowed to doggie bag it.", "author": "Madison W."}

However, on my recent visit, I was feeling disappointed with the service and the food.  \n\nI ordered the usual: \n1) Tombo crudo: nice raw tuna cubes marinated in Vietnamese herbs, served with rice cracker. I thought it was a nice dish/ appetizer. Bright, refreshing taste with nice acidity. \n2) Pepper squid and radishes: this was new for me. I have been here many times and this was the first time I ordered this dish. It was ok, a bit blend to be honest. Need some kick to it. Perhaps some acid?\n3) Pig skin spaghetti: this is my ultimate favorite dish from this restaurant and I was so disappointed that it never made it to our table. I actually reminded our waitress that we ordered the pig skin spaghetti when they brought out new utensils after our appetizers. She acknowledged my message and said that she didn't want to bring the spaghetti with the other appetizers because the spaghetti is spicy and should be served separately.... yea whatever!\n4) Coulotte steak: I remember this dish being very juicy and seductive and this particular time, it was looking pretty sad. I ordered my steak medium; the edges were looking more like well done and I saw some hint of pink in the middle portion of the meat but they seemed super dry... not very appealing unfortunately (they looked very pale and grey)... or maybe I was still upset that they decided to skip my pig skin spaghetti!!\n\nService was okay. The waitress didn't apologize about messing up our order or forgetting our spaghetti. Not sure if it's her fault or the kitchen fault. In addition, she didn't check if the steak was cooked to our liking! \n\nMaybe it's just me but I feel like the quality of the food is not as good as it used to.", "author": "Sam M."}

There were four of us eating and we started with the beef heart tartare, little gem salad and a tuna collar special. Tartare was underwhelming and my wife said it had the consistency of cat food, it was lacking salt or any bright notes, totally forgettable, little gem salad was also missing some acidity and was a real snoozer. The tuna collar was described to us as being braised on a bed of aromatics, when it came to the table it was indeed on a veritable medley of stuff with varying degrees of edibility. There was roasted garlic but only the smaller cloves were cooked the larger ones were straight up lumps of raw garlic, the dish was also sprinkled with pink peppercorns which were also inedible, I felt that it was an appetizer minefield and was scared to take bites in case I was unfortunate enough to encounter something I didn't want to swallow, I will also say this dish was also lacking salt. Be careful what you wish for though because the entrees arrived and suddenly it became apparent what the kitchen had been holding on to the salt for. Three of us at the table got the coulotte steak, it looked great but the very first bite of the meat proved so salty I immediately started looking around for our server, the rest of the steak orderers were also pushing their plates away from them. Our server was great and asked if we would like the same dishes but with less salt, I opted to try the fennel sausage instead and the other two switched out to the pasta with bottarga dish.\nAbout 15 minutes later out comes my sausage entree which was basically a sausage with a side salad....odd. One bite of the sausage and it was salt lick city all over again and if anything it was even saltier than the steak (which I considered to be only slightly less saline than the Dead Sea). Also oddly one of my dinner companions pasta was ok and the other one was also off the charts salty.\nNeedless to say at this point we cut our losses and asked for the check, the server was gracious enough to not charge us for any of the disastrous entrees.\nAnother thing that spoiled the experience for me was the constant yelling out of tickets by the expediter, is it really necessary to be so loud, I mean people are trying to talk and not get PTSD from the constant shouting. Maybe instead of yelling he could have put his mouth to better use by tasting the food that was leaving the kitchen?\nThe whole experience was solely redeemed by the professionalism of the front of house staff.

It was exquisite and had both great taste and texture. Later on, I realized Chris Cosentino had previously done Incanto. A few Valentines Day back I was there and had a memorable meal of heart. I had no desire to eat the k\u00e6stur h\u00e1karl in Iceland but maybe when I return I'll try the svi\u00f0. \n\nAnyway, I was excited by this restaurant as the Impossible Burger was talked up by my colleagues. We arrived early after work on Friday, and decided to adventure on the pig's head. It looked a bit gross, and we could hear the chatter from the neighboring tables.\n\nHow to eat it? Apparently, just dig in. There was some exquisite meat under the skin, which was dark and shredded, and reminded us of duck meat. The skin was a little dry and sticky, but it was okay. The big piece of pig rind was a bit more crunchy and had a better taste.\n\nThe fat!! Maybe our pig was extra fatty. You'd take a scoop from the face, and it'd be a blob of fat. You'd think, sure, I'll give it a try, it's on my plate. It tasty-- fatty, again not too delicious, but as the manager quoted later, 'rich'.\n\nApparently a lot of people don't feel well after eating the pig head. I'd even be willing to pay an extra $20 for them to carve it in front of us.

You enter the restaurant from a not-so-flashy entrance to a beautifully decorated interior.

We ended up being just 4 people and arrived 45 minutes earlier than planned. They were very accommodating and were able to seat us right away. \n\nThe service was friendly and very quick. The server was knowledgeable in the menu and gave great recommendations. The most impressive was that we were not looking to spend a lot of money and she didn't seem annoyed by this. She gave fantastic recommendations for saving money and still getting enough food to fill us up. \n\nSome of our selections were grilled cheese with duck egg, HAM burger, and Zampini. The food came out faster than expected and was delicious. I thought the grilled cheese was good but not great. But it definitely changed my life for the better because who would've thought to put HONEY on grilled cheese??? I wasn't that big of a fan of the duck egg on top, maybe I just don't like the consistency of duck egg. The HAMburger was delicious, probably my favorite of the night. The patty (made of ham, obvi) was juicy and tender. The dish came with large heaps of roasted potatoes. This all came out to be just $15, well worth it. Lastly, the Zampini. I really struggled understanding what this dish was at first until it came out and it was a ring of sausage. The sausage itself was good, but nothing too special. However, the corn and tomato succotash of sorts was the highlight of the plate for me. Not sure what seasoning they used, but it was a weird but delicious flavor. \n\nI took off one star because for a restaurant with the price that they charge, the menu items weren't that appealing to me. I chose the grilled cheese appetizer as an entree because nothing else sounded THAT amazing to me. To each their own though, I think the food was still fantastic I would give the other items a try next time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-22", "description": "Chef Chris Cosentino! Thanks for the excellent food!\n\nCame here for a birthday dinner on Saturday night. We had a reservation for 5 and I was the first to arrive 15 mins early, but our table was already ready and after I was brought there, the staff showed me where the bar was and suggested I could either hangout at the bar and waited at the table. Very thoughtful service!\n\nIt's not a big menu but all the dishes names sound very tempting. And since it is so hard to decide.... we just went ahead with the \"Shared Supper\" items and got both of them plus two other appetizers.\n\n#Beef Heart Tartare - Appetizers ($16): A.\nBeef tartare is pretty common but beef heart? It turned out to be pretty delicious. The meat definitely contained a lot more fat, and the texture was more smooth than regular beef tartare. I actually almost felt like eating fatty tuna tartare. Used it as a spread on grilled bread. Wonderful.\n\n#Octopus A La Plancha - Appetizers ($18): B.\nNot sure about this one. Portion was very small, and there were only few pieces of octopus plus some vegetables. Not recommended.\n\n#Pin Bone Steak - Shared Supper ($110): A+.\nFirst off, the price did justify at least from the portion point of view - this dish alone could have fed 6 people. And the steak itself was bomb! Very, very nicely cooked. Even though the bone size was enormous, every piece of meat I tasted was almost at the same level of rawness (borderline of rare and medium rare). Very juicy, very tender. This dish came with two sauces: bone marrow sauce and red wine sauce. Honestly I could not taste much from the bone marrow sauce, probably the flavor from bone marrow was sort of on the light side. But the red wine sauce was definitely worth to be put on the steak. Some vege that came with this dish definitely helped balanced my stomach a little bit.\n\n#Wood Oven Roasted Pig Head - Shared Supper ($65): A+.\nThis dish alone could have fed another 4 people! What a big head. For anyone that has tried Chinese style roasted pig before this dish actually reminded me exactly that. The skin was crispy (not brittle enough to a point that it would break once you bite on it though) but the meat / fat underneath was WOW. It was actually a huge amount of fat. If it was not cooked properly it would actually feel pretty nasty to put so much fat in your mouth at the same time. Nothing like that from this dish. Very flavorful and the temperature was just about right. The meat tasted like moist pulled pork with lots of flavor too.\n\nSome other notes:\n- Cocktails were great. We tried \"The Towering Inferno\" (gin and ginger beer based) and \"About Cherry Sling\" (gin and cherry based) and both were very refreshing, not too strong and tasted very fruity.\n- Service was wonderful. Our server was wonderful and very attentive, and very energetic when explaining the menu to us. The cocktails above were actually suggested by him, he surely knows what's good there.\n- At the end of our dinner Chef Chris Cosentino walked out from the kitchen, sat down at our table chatted with us for quite a bit of time! He explained his philosophy of this restaurant, his goal about customer experience, what new dish he is working on etc. A very nice and passionate chef. We got to take a picture with him too!\n\nOverall, a wonderful dining experience with amazing food. I may not be coming back too often because the dishes were just too meaty but if I can manage to gather a big group of friends from out of town, Cockscomb will definitely be the few on top of my list for dinner gathering.", "author": "Simon C."}

Nestled right across the street from where I used to live in SOMA, it is unassuming in front, but once inside, it is well laid out, seems bigger than it is space.  The open kitchen makes the dimly lit room more lively and exciting than your standard $$$ dining room.\n\nBut really, this place is about the food...and when I mean food I mean the different meat platters!!!  Okay, so we started off with the Grilled Cheese with Egg and Honey.  As far grilled cheeses go, you really can't get better than this.  Well you can, I was slightly disappointed that it wasn't the Truffle Grilled cheese I saw in pics on yelp, but I guess its not truffle season. Never the less, excellent grilled cheese.  The next dish was the pig ears and cabbage salad.  Similar to a Vietnamese salad dish, it was a bit tangy and spicy.  However, I probably would have enjoyed the pig ears by themselves, without all the cabbage and dressing.\n\nAfter wetting our appetites, we continued on to the heavier plates.  The beef heart tartare was delicious, but not for the faint of heart...  BEEFY is the best way to describe the flavor and the bread was perfectly grilled and buttered!  SO GOOD!  The butcher's choice was lamb heart with yellow zucchini.  It was well seasoned and cooked, but it just wasn't my thing.\n\nThe main event featured the heavy weight of the heavy weights!  Pine Bone Steak with Bone Marrow Dip!  The steak took a while, but after the seeing the size of it, you understand why.  Must have been at least 3 pounds!  The charring and seasoning was excellent.  The edges were a bit over cooked but it was darn near perfect the rest of the way.  The bone marrow dip was so flavorful and added an extra kick for your taste buds.  Of course the Au Jus kept it moist and juicy!  \n\nOverall, I loved the experience at Cockscomb!  Will definitely come back for the pig's head!!! And maybe bring more people so we can get that Pin Bone Steak again too!!!", "author": "Veasna H."}

I held back 1 star because I felt that the prices are extremely inconsistent. $105 for clams and pork belly?!?! That was the special of the day. Not sure what they can possible do to the pork belly and clams to justify the $100 bucks but I was not about to order it to find out. We just moved on to another special they had, pig skin linguini. It was a reasonable $18 and well worth it. It was creative and delicious. Another example is the lemonade (non-alcoholic). It was $7. And no, it did not come with refills. It was super sour, I had to ask for simple syrup. \n\nThe dish that really blew my mind was the kale salad with butternut squash and bird seeds ($14). It was unique and packed with flavors. \nPigs ear terrine ($13) - was reminiscent of a Vietnamese salad, which had great flavors. The pig ears were thinly shaved and not chewy. \nSquid and tomatillo ($15) - the squid, grape and tomatillo pairing was super refreshing.\nBacon chop ($34) - it was moist, smokey and flavorful. \nPin bone steak ($125) - This was a fun dish. Yes, the price tag is shocking but it feeds at least four. The steak came on a butcher board the size of our table. I do think it was under seasoned but nonetheless it was a great cut of beef. The sauces that came with it was great as well. I wish our server had told us it was that big. Not knowing, we over ordered.\n\nDesserts were the weakest dishes of the night. We had the panna cotta and a fruit popover. Both were fine but were overshadow by the great savory courses we had earlier.\n\nI suggest coming here with a group of 4, order a few apps and the pin bone steak.

I made reservations about a week and a half ago, and had to put down a credit card to keep the reservation (standard for a high volume night, I suppose). The place is awesome looking, by the way. A nice atmosphere. While I didn't spend any time at the bar, it was very cute looking. We were seated immediately upon arrival, given a choice of table or chef's counter. We were seated at a communal table, which did disappoint me at first since I had made reservations, I was expecting a private table. However, we shared the long table with two couples over the span of three hours, and it didn't bother us at all in the end.\n\nOur waiter was the best waiter I think I've ever had at any place I have ever eaten. His name is Sam, and I trusted him, wholeheartedly. He was very attentive, and knew the menu like the back of his own hand. He didn't even write down what we ordered, he just remembered, and we got everything we wanted in a very timely manner. The wine here is pricey (expect to pay about $100 for a bottle), but the bottle I chose was very good. It was the Arietta Bordeaux, 2014, and took about 20-30 minutes to fully open up, however Sam offered us a decanter (something that no other restaurant has ever offered). This wine paired well with everything we ordered.\n\nWe started with the grilled cheese. This was good. Could I make it at home? No. It uses incredibly expensive ingredients. Could I mimic it? Hmmm maybe. For our mains, we ordered the bacon chop, the sweet potato, as well as the spaghetti squash (a side dish). At first I found the bacon chop to be quite salty, but then I ate it with the tangerine slices served with it, and voila! Perfectly balanced. The sweet potato dish was delicious, no extra comments needed here. The spaghetti squash had a spicy kick that I wasn't expecting, but I welcomed it.\n\nFor dessert, we ordered the first thing that we heard (Sam recited the whole menu, and we never even saw a physical dessert menu). All of it sounded amazing, but we got a chocolate flourless (? I'm guessing because I can't remember since I didn't read it), cake with pistachios and a small scoop of coffee ice cream on top. So good. Order this.\n\nOverall, we were never rushed and we both felt very at ease. We had a lovely dinner, and would like to thank the staff and the owner for giving us a pleasant and romantic Valentine's Day dinner. I'd also like to add that I was sending photos of the food to my dad, who I found out had actually been here before with a group. He said that he ordered the Impossible Burger for lunch, with an expensive bottle of wine, but that it was all very good, and worth the price.\n\nI'd come back for either dinner or lunch.", "author": "Natalie M."}

The liver bruschetta was solid. It was a bit odd that we got the last liver bruschetta, apparently, and the tuna bruschetta only became an option at that point. I'm not sure why we weren't offered our choice of both from the start. In general, the start of our meal, once we were moved from the bar, lacked explanation.

Now that we've got that out of the way, on to the meat of the experience. \n\nWe came here for a birthday and managed to snag reservations at 8:30 for Friday that same week. Since we had a fairly large party, we decided to go family style. \n\nHere's what we ordered:\n\n- Beef Heart Tartare: The taste of this dish was forgettable, but the only unforgettable piece is when the birthday boy said that the texture reminded him of brains. \n- Duck Fat Cauliflower: Delicious and flavorful. \n- Grilled Cheese: BEST OF THE NIGHT! Who knew something as simple as grilled cheese with honey can be so amazing.\n- Bacon Chop: Meh. I thought it was going to be much juicier than it was. \n- 4lb Sirloin topped w/foie gras and a bone marrow au jus: It was good, but not amazing. The flavor was all there, but I found it to be a little dry. \n- We also ended up ordering almost every dessert on the menu and nothing was disappointing. \n\nOverall, our experience at Cockscomb was not bad. My only gripe is the long wait in between the bacon chop and the sirloin which killed our appetite. However, I'm still giving Cockscomb a 4 star review simply because our waiter was nothing short of amazing. The menu was 2nd nature to him and he gave each dish such a mouthwatering description that it was extremely difficult to not order every single thing.", "author": "Tiffany U."}

They were quite busy and we had to wait a very long time for a table (with a reservation), but they were friendly and apologetic about it, which made it better.  They also served us a complimentary plate of melon & prosciutto right when we got our table as they must have known we'd be starved by then.\n\nI liked the ambiance and the decor of the restaurant, but the food fell short for me.  We had the Halibut Crudo, Grilled Cheese, Meat Pie, Duck Fat Summer Squash and Escarole & Anchovy.  The plating and appearance was nice but the food was mostly a bit bland and unexceptional. The Halibut was good, the Grilled Cheese was also, but the Meat Pie although adorable, was lacking in flavor. The squash dish, although I could taste a bit of the duck fat was also quite bland and boring.\n\nAll I can say is that they were very nice, it's a cute place, but the food won't bring me back.

In particular, the Pin Bone Steak was terrible. It is a dish to share, priced at $125. Our waitress said it would feed four of us. It arrived at the table looking and smelling great, pre-sliced on a larger wooden platter. However, almost a quarter of it was bone, fat and gristle. The actual meat was tough, by which I mean, hard to cut with a steak knife and somewhat rubbery to chew. It came with peas and carrots, both of which were extremely al dente, almost uncooked. Our side dishes of gnocchi and duck fat cauliflower were equally disappointing. The gnocchi were mushy and the cauliflower was almost raw and poorly spiced. Our two appetizers: grilled cheese and Kale salad were okay, but nothing special. The only part of the meal I enjoyed was the Fort Point IPA, but they also compromised that by charging $9 for a diminutive twelve ounce pour. I left the restaurant feeling annoyed and still hungry.\n\nIn my opinion, the place is overpriced and pretentious with mediocre food. We will not be going back.", "author": "Duncan L."}

To make things worse, this dish took FOREVER to come out. We would have canceled it if we weren't so hungry.\n\nAll in all, I just didn't leave very satisfiedl I'm giving three stars instead of two because I guess it would be a cool spot to stop at for drinks if you're in the area, but there are plenty of better spots around if you're looking to eat as well.", "author": "Estelle C."}

We asked if it was fish sauce but nope. Nonetheless I devoured the whole plate. The beef heart tartare was also good but the thing I like most about that dish is the bread. That bread is so good.

We are both the type who like to go out and try new places and she mentioned Cockscomb. I didn't know about the place and did my research. I was so busy during the entire week I forgot to call the reservation line at 3PM. We decided to be rebellious and go on a Friday night and try our luck. Oh boy did we luck out! We didn't have to wait because there were seats upstairs by the bar that overlooked the entire lower dining room. Sick view, great food, good drinks and amazing company. \n\nIt was Friday so we started with some cocktails. I got the Pisco Punch and A got the Boothby. Both drinks were good. Mine had a nice tartness to it that I really enjoyed and the boothby was nice if you enjoyed a tropical coconut type flavor. \n\nWe decided to go all out on food and try everything that stood out to us. We started with the \"Hot Mess\" - seared foie gras. This was my first time having foie gras since they lifted the ban here in SF. It was definitely melt in your mouth, but not sure how we felt exactly about it being cold since it was seared. Good, but could have done without.\n\nNext up was the grilled cheese with honey and shaved truffles. Now this was a palate pleaser. The cheese and the honey complimented each other so well and the saltiness of the truffle was a little undermined but still a nice touch to the classic sandwich.\n\nFor our main courses we had the Quail Tetrazzini and the Coulotte Steak.\n\nThese two by far were our favorite dishes of the night. The quail had an amazing flavor to it and was complimented with this delicious white wine sauce with mushrooms and had some crispy noodle pieces to really give it that extra texture. The steak was seasoned to perfection and had a great charred taste to it. My taste buds were singing of joy. \n\nThe restaurant has great service.

Good thing we only came for happy hour, which is located upstairs at the bar.

I'm not sure if the back room applies to happy hour as well, but here's hoping it does for the next time I come back. Servers were really nice and attentive to our needs.

The lime juice, chili, and garnish complimented the fried pig ears really well!\n3) $4 Crispy Potatoes: (4/5) Crispy potatoes is right.

You haven't had grilled cheese until you've had this! Oh my goodness, its like a sweet french toast with hot and stringy cheese melted in between.

I mean. Come on now. The animal consists of more than steaks and ribs!\n\nWe started off in the drinks area, and the bartender was super nice. I, per usual, had no idea of what alcohol I'd like other than...alcohol. He made me an aviation that was really delicious. And super alcoholic. I win. We then meander to our table, which was very spacious. They have 2 levels here, with the bar being upstairs. We went slightly further up for our table. The food:\n\nPigs head: Really yummy. If you like pig skin in many forms, this is the perfect dish. I'm pretty sure I had pig skin in any cook-level I wanted. And it was sooo good. Though, no one was brave enough to eat the eye. I'm sorry, eyes aren't something I eat despite my heritage. \n\nPinbone steak: GIANT portion, and HELLA good. I'm easily amused, and that cow jus holder just amused me. My friend commented that I don't go to American steak houses...which I don't. Steak was really nicely done, and sliced for us! Though a knife was provided for extra slicing\n\nPot Pie: The pot pie that night was escargot, pork belly, mushrooms, and escarole. It was really good, though I'm kinda thinking the escargot could have been replaced with something else. It got a bit too...fishy for me. But still good. The pastry was super flaky and good\n\nPanna Cotta: Get this. I don't care what flavor. The panna cotta here is yummy. Texture alone is worth it.\n\nChocolate: I can't remember what exactly this was, other than chocolate with marshmallow. It was good, though I prefer the clean taste of the panna cotta. \n\nOverall, it was a great meal. The staff were amazing, and very friendly.

She said: don't worry, I will make you one right away, before your entr\u00e9e comes out.\n\nIf this special, Hot Mess is available, ORDER it!!!! Sorry for all those against foie gras, but for all the foie gras lovers:  trotter pieces in broth, herbs, saut\u00e9ed dates & mushrooms, bread smothered with date puree accompanied with a perfectly piece of seared foie gras!!  Need I say more? Best dish of the night, hands down. (glad the server couldn't ruin it for us yet....)\n\nBavette Steak-cooked perfectly, deliciously charred carrots lightly flavored to bring out the flavor of the meat\n\nDuck fat cauliflower- no taste, reminded me of freezer burned vegetable\n\nQuail tetrazzini- first time it came around, the skin was soggy, and when I cut into the breast, it was raw!!!! And where was our waiter 5 minutes later?? \nWe would STILL waiting........AGAIN, Chef Sasha saves the day and asks if everything is ok.  We show her the quail and she apologizes as well as the nice chef next to her and brings it back to the chef who made it so he can finish cooking it.  When we finally get it back, it is perfectly cooked and super juicy, with beautiful saut\u00e9ed crispy angel hair pasta and mushrooms. Yum!\n\nAt this point, maybe I might have given our overall experience 3.5 stars....THEN...\nOur server misunderstands me and brings me the bill, which I say no, I would like to see the dessert menu and apologizes....then disappears for 15 minutes and never returns!!!! Finally as I am trying to flag him down, he realizes, he never brought over the dessert menu and asks a fellow staff member to do so. SERIOUSLY???? After forgetting an order, not check on our entr\u00e9e which is severely under cooked, you forget to bring us the dessert menu?  Where is the attention to detail or energy to attempt to make up for your previous mistakes?  If it wasn't for Chef Sasha, our night would've been ruined and this restaurant may have gotten 1 or 2 stars from me.", "author": "Nguyen L."}

Upon entering my boyfriend said to the hostess \"Hello, we have a reservation for 8\", but knowing that might have sounded confusing he corrected himself and said \"I'm sorry, a reservation for 2 at 8\". The hostess then replied in a condescending way \"yeah,\nI know\". We noticed how unnecessarily rude that was but brushed it off. Then, once we sat down, she said to me \"Let me take your coffee cup. We don't allow outside beverages\" (I had a paper coffee cup). I gave it to her and said \"If you would have told me you didn't allow it, I would've finished it outside\", she then said, \"well it looks tacky in a paper cup, so let me take it and put in another glass\". How was I supposed to know that's what she was going to do with it?! She made it seem like she was going to throw it away! For whatever reason that you don't except outside beverages, you DO NOT indirectly insult a customer by telling them that it looks tacky. I don't know why she felt the need to validate herself by being rude to the customers she is paid to serve, but it's really disappointing receiving such terrible service as soon as you walk in the the door. We couldn't help but feel bothered the entire time. I would return to eat here, but I would hope they would do something about the hostess. It looks like others have had similar experiences with this hostess, so we aren't being dramatic. Once again, I hate giving 1 star, but we just wished for a more well rounded experience.", "author": "Ashley E."}

I had the grilled cheese and the oysters which were decently priced! ($6 for grilled cheese and $1 oysters)\n\nThe grilled cheese had a mild flavor and the honey on the toasted bread gave it a nice twist, but I wasn't super sold on it. Perhaps it's because I am a loyalist to strong nutty cheeses but it was good nonetheless. The atmosphere definitely plays a big part at this restaurant: swanky and slightly industrial with moody lighting and close seating. I ate on the upstairs area which was fairly limited (I also think they should get hooks for bags and coats when sitting at the counter)\n\nThe thing that slightly annoyed me was the service- it was TOO MUCH actually. I was having a conversation with someone and a server asked us if we were done with the oysters at LEAST 5 times. Other times, he would hover around and peer over our shoulder to see if we were finished. The last time, the hostess actually came by to try to take our tray but we had two oysters left. I don't get what the rush/urgency of this matter was, but it was distracting to have them consistently interrupt the conversation lol.\n\nThey have good prices and interesting cocktails here though, I would come here again for some small bites with friends and to try some of the dinner creations.", "author": "Amanda K."}

I am a big fan of Chef Chris Cosentino after watching his innovative style on Top Chef and of course his restaurant Incanto. The appealing menu includes interpretations of SF's classics, ranging from pork, quail, green goddess dressing on little gems, crudo variety at the bar.\n\nReservations are highly expected. \nThere are two bars: one is on the main floor, and there's another on the upstairs mezzanine. The layout is like a loft, has a clean and universal look. Has an open kitchen and a long wood counter. Spacious and modern. Menu is seasonal, so expect some items to change.\n\nFood: 3.5 only because some certain items I wasn't too thrilled about.\n\nGrilled Cheese w/truffle & honey-YUM!!! and not your average home cooked sammich but they did deliver.\n\nBeef Heart Tartare- grilled bread fries & greens- Yes I like it raw with no complaints!\n\nLittle Gems-green goddess, radish & cracklins-Refreshing \n\nDuck Liver Terrine-pickled fruit & grilled bread- A little bit gamey for me. Acquired taste.\n\nDuck Fat Cauliflower-red fresno, garlic, caper & mint- I didn't like it. Kind of soggy and was bland.\n\nBroccoli Rabe-garlic, lemon, chili & breadcrumbs-Reminded me of Chinese Broccoli and kind of bitter. Not a big fan.\n\nBone Marrow-hay smoked fried oysters, watercress & horseradish. The star of the show! I was very pleased and I'm a sucker for it.\n\nToasted Oats- maitake mushrooms, kale, poached egg & button mushrooms-I guess I'm a snob because I did not like this dish at all. I believe toasted oats is a breakfast item and the mixture did not like my palate.\n\nBacon Chop-apples, brussellskraut & mustard-HUGE!! but where was the bacon? lol the pork chop itself was cooked to perfection, tender and grilled on point. My only complaint was the large amount of fat on it. \n\nI would like to give Cockscomb another chance and try other items on the menu, but for now 3.5 stars.

Glad I tried it as I think it's a unique restaurant which says a lot in SF. They do clearly care about quality here.\n\nBeautifully designed place that is casual but upscale and has a lively atmosphere.\n\nFor two people we got the little gem salad, beef heart tartare, and the pigs head. We had too much food and could have ditched the salad cause the pigs head came with a huge side salad.\n\nThe little gem salad was nice and surprisingly light given it has crispy pigs ear. The beef heart tartare actually tastes like a normal steak tartare but was still very tasty. \n\nThe pigs head is half a head and still maybe too much for two mostly cause of grease and fat. It's very tender but you get overwhelmed by the fat -- my girlfriend in fact felt physically sick after. I felt a bit too greasy myself. Maybe if you split it with 4 people it'd be okay.\n\nThe side salad helped balance the grease out as it was nice and a little bitter. It may have helped more to include bread.\n\nI was surprised they don't have tea after such a heavy meal. I ordered a cappuccino and it tasted off -- like the very acidic espresso had a topping of milk foam but it didn't add up. They replaced it with an americano which was also very very acidic. They didn't have regular drip coffee. They were nice enough not to bill us for that.\n\nService is nice and they definitely don't rush you.", "author": "Victor W."}

Lol!)\n\nMy friends and I have been waiting for a chance to go to Chris Cosentino's new restaurant Cockscomb. Who doesn't want to eat a whole pig's head?! Thank you Peter L for arranging the reservation and making this happen! We had a party of 5 people.\n\nDrinks:\n*Big trouble in little China ($11): dark rum, coconut milk, pineapple, mint\n*Boothby ($11): pomegranate infused bourbon, sweet vermouth, bitters & sparkling wine\n*Milk punch ($11): pisco based punch with a combination of rum, citrus & exotic spices\n*Bullitt ($15): old potrero rye, cynar, grapefruit bitters\n*The martini ($11): old Tom gin, noilly prat dry vermouth served up, finished with lemon disk\n*Cascina roccalini: barbaresco, italy, 2010 ($68)\n\nI had been nursing a hangover all day, so I really only had my drink which was the Bullitt. Dark and boozy and not too sweet. I had a sip of the red which paired nicely with our dinner selections.\n\n*Bruschetta ($19): uni and lardo\nThis was my favorite appetizer. The bread was rustic and crusty. And the uni with lardo was delicious!\n\n*'Eggs, eggs, eggs': salmon roe and tarragon aioli ($14)\nMy gf really liked this. She loves eggs. This was great on their toast. The egg yolk was like liquid gold! So rich and creamy.\n\n*Pickled sardines: giardiniera ($13)\nThis provided a salty contrast to our other dishes. I loved the veggies that came with this.\n\n*Duck liver terrine: pickled fruit and grilled bread ($14)\nDeliciously creamy! I love liver pate and this didn't disappoint.\n\n*Grilled cheese: truffle and honey ($16)\nI love truffle so I would have really enjoyed this without the honey. I only had a couple of bites since I'm not a huge fan of sweet and savory.\n\n*Wood oven roasted pig's head: endives, capers, parsley & lemon ($50)\nThis is a thing of beauty to look at! If you can't stand looking at fat, I'd say stay away from this. The dish is definitely like digging for moist delicious pieces of meat through layers and layers of fat! Due to richness of the meat, I could only eat so much of this. The crispy skin however, I kept picking at. It was like delicious pig chips! Yum!\n\n*Bone marrow mixed grill: watercress and horseradish ($20)\nThis was actually a huge disappointment. The big bone marrow barely had an marrow in it. And it was quite difficult to dig marrow out of the smaller bones. We basically gave up.\n\n*Bavette steak: roasted carrots, onions, thyme and kombu butter ($33)\nYum! Tender and cooked perfectly! And the serving was enough for each of us to have a slice. Definitely my favorite main.\n\n*Broccoli rabe: garlic, lemon, chili and breadcrumbs ($6)\nI love having veggies with dinner, so this was a great side! We needed some contrast to all the richness.\n\nWith all these dishes, we were stuffed! There was a party next to us who had ordered a delicious looking seafood tower. I may have to come back just for that. It looked amazing!\n\nI saw Chris Cosentino upstairs saying hi to a table and downstairs while they were closing up. But I was too shy to ask for a picture.

The little gem salad which was nicely dressed and had a great porky crunch from the pig ears (I wish there was more of it though). The grilled cheese could have had more cheese but the shaved black truffles added a great luxurious earthiness. If you like oozy yolk porn, the eggx3 is a must order!\n\nThe beef heart tartare was one hearty dish (great for sharing) especially with the deliciously crispy fried potatoes. The trio of bone marrow was slightly disappointing as we found it hard to dig out marrow from the other non-beef bones. The pairing of uni (sweetly briny) and iberico lardo (pork buttah) was pure ambrosia but would have been better with a less carby bread and sans the radish and greens.\n\nE N T R E E S\n*Bacon Chop w/ apples, brussellskraut, mustard ($32): http://bit.ly/12jWDJ4\n*Bavette Steak w/ roasted carrots & kombu butter ($33): http://bit.ly/1v4pFmX\n* Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head w/ endive salad & salsa verde dripping sauce ($50): http://bit.ly/1CygR2B; pig ear: http://bit.ly/1tv8zz8\n\nThe bacon chop is a must order for carniwhores! It's 2 lbs of succulent, meaty deliciousness. There's a thick layer of fat lining the chop which keeps it incredibly moist. The bavette steak was uber tender and had a subtle umami flavor from the kombu butter. The pig's head was a wondrous sight that would make most carniwhores cream...and vegetarians scream. I expected it to be uber crunchy like Chinese siu yuk or Filipino lechon but the skin was fatty and gelatinous. To get into the prized cuts of meat like the cheek, you'll have to pry through the thick layers of fat. We barely made a dent into it so I have the leftovers (carcass and all) in the freezer to make pozole at a later time. The leftover salsa verde made with the pig's drippings makes for a great crusty bread dipper. \n\nD E S S E R T\n*\"Classic\" Mandarin Orange Mille Crepe Cake ($7): http://bit.ly/1pH6wvE\n It was too soggy and wet for my liking. \n\n~ * ~ S E R V I C E ~ * ~\nYou would have never known it was their soft opening because the staff was spectacular!

As much as  I liked it, getting to Incanto and parking was always a pain. Being near the train and in an area that has plenty of parking during the late night makes it an ideal upgrade to me. Dropped in w.ith some friends for a last minute dinner before I left town. \n\nNice list of Amaro to start with. Pork Belly Chop, Meat pie, Benton's country ham and sweetbreads rounded out the savory. Everything was delicious though the salsa verde on the sweetbreads unfortunately cooled them down too much and the dish was lukewarm. The chop is huge and is the bacon from the meat pie with snails really brought on the carne. Country ham was solid but not in a tremendous portion like the others. Next time Im bring a large group and we need to tackle the pigs head and pin bone steak and make like Bengal tigers. 4.3 stars", "author": "Kim N."}

I liked the open kitchen and the lofty ceilings. We were seated on the second floor balcony overlooking the seating area below. Great place for a special occasion or a night on the town.\n\nHalibut crudo was a fun starter, and I especially liked the huge, homemade circle of rice cracker to go with it. You could crush it into the crudo or use it more as a cracker, which I chose to do. The flavors all complimented each other nicely and the cracker definitely added a fun crunch and flavor.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Cornish Game Hen, which was very tender and juicy. The skin had a bit of crisp in it, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The persimmons and molasses also went great with the chicken. We also ordered this really fatty pasta dish that I can't remember the name of (and I don't think it's on the menu any longer). It was basically fat that was rendered into the shape of pasta noodles, which was extremely heavy. It was fun to try, but don't think I'd order a full order of this again.\n\nDuck fat cauliflower was a solid side that you can't really go wrong with. They were nice enough to give us an order of the duck liver pate on the house, which was so tasty and really put us over the top. \n\nEscape from Alcatraz was a great drink -- love elderflower pretty much any cocktail! \n\nThe food here is definitely very rich and servings of meats and oysters are not for the faint of heart.", "author": "Audrey L."}

A thin, tall and erect man in a dark sports jacket and stripe shirt, with dark jeans to complete the mandatory SoMa biz look was waiting outside of the restaurant. The last sentence I said out loud was \"banana bread and pot brownies.\" Just a lovely way to impress the man in a dark sports coat. I bumped into him on purpose for I lacked the usual grace. He informed me there seemed to be a lot of Asians who just walked in. Our reservation was for 6:45. The maitre de led us to a counter space facing the kitchen. We both said, \"Dining at the counter was my favorite\" and then caught ourselves agreeing about something unintentionally. He scooped my stool closer to him so that we could find a suitable distance to discuss the comings and goings. \n\nCockscomb has been my secret obsession ever since it showed up in an Urbandaddy review. Any friend of mine who dined with me recently would know that I could not shut up about it. It was only a matter of time I'd come here. After canceling the prior two reservations, we made it finally. \n\nI noted a man I knew was sitting two stools down, I did not greet him for I was lazy. We caught up on our lives. His cousins were in town. He's headed to New England for a trip before New Years, and his father's 90th birthday was coming up and his flight to his Midwestern town required a mandatory stop over in Chicago. I asked about the timing for I had always wanted to check off several midwestern states that I had never been to and never intended to go: Nebraska, Iowa, Indiana, the Dakotas.  You know, the bucket list that says \"Those midwestern states you swear that you'd never set foot in but you did anyway.\"  He laughed and invited me to a future trip on that account. \n\nHaving accomplished that, I started to review menu. Really good selection of odd yet familiar items. The bone marrow three way, the spicy tripe, the little gem with fried pig ears. The entire pig's head. The steak that is big enough to share with the entire village. Difficult choices but I all of sudden realize why so many Asians. We love that shit. The strangely familiar items on the menu spoke to Asians. The strange sounding comfort food that you'd see served in a different way in a Chinese restaurant, The ingredients that made some cringe and others jump up and down for joy. I'm the other. \n\nWe had a few things but I was not hungry as I should. The man to the left of me, the one I recognized but failed to say hello to earlier, was sharing a two pound pork chop with his lady friend, who could not have been his wife, so I wondered. The man to the right of me, the companion who was waiting for me outside earlier, was impressed by the tripe, but not so impressed with the aged ham. He claimed that back in his home town they knew how to really do the hog right. I reserve the right to get smarter and will hold him to it. \n\nYou don't need to be a Asian American person who grew up on pig's head or an Iowa Irish pig farm boy to appreciate the unusual combination of other worldly goodies Cockscomb cooks up.  It is a new age comfort food concept done right.\n\nI have a a few more friends that I'm anxious to drag into this scene. I'm also just plain juvenile. Any chance I could say Cockscomb with a straight face, I'd be gunning for it.\n\nNext up, the pork chops and the pig's head.", "author": "Victoria E."}

Nothing offal eaten and no presence of a cock in the building except for the male species enjoying their liberations or the picture icon on our plates. And not as offal as Incanto but as tasty as expected from a Chef Cosentino restaurant. \n\nSince this restaurant is \"hot and new\" it's highly recommended to make reservations. Can be tough getting a time slot of your liking. Parking it's that bad but do not expect front door parking. Service is pretty good but I felt a little rush when waitstaff kept coming by wanting to take your plate away when you are still \"nibbling\" away. And most importantly, THE FOOD, was pretty good. However, wish the plates had better presentation to be Instagram worthy because in no way it was foodporn quality. Still happy to get a table here and experience the food. I mean, What should you eat the night before lent... MEAT!!!\n\nOYSTERS - check the chalk board. price varies depending on type. They were very fresh and already disconnected for you. Just slurp as I did! The servings come with 3 type of dressings, but oyster lovers know not to coat the oyster because stand-alone quality raw form is what will speak to your palette. \n\nBACON CHOP - apples, brusselskraut, and mustards. The side serving of veggies blanket my bacon chop making it's photoshoot tribute for Instagram not too worthy. However, the dish itself was super delicious. The chop was very fatty and only saw a sliver of bacon on one side of the chop but I still enjoyed each bite. It was tender, juicy, and \"meaty\". The portion was huge and can possibly be shared. I highly recommend this dish. \n\nBONE MARROW - hay smoked fried oysters, watercress and horseradish. From what I've gathered, it was just OK. There's better out there. \n\nPANNA COTTA - perhaps I'm bias because my favorite dessert is panna cotta and when the waiter came by to show us the desserts... I went tunnel vision. The panna cotta had a very nice firm yet silky texture. Pretty good panna cotta but not as rich and silky as I've had at his other restaurant. \n\nWill I be back? Sure.

We ordered the day's special - tuna collar, along with spaghettini, sausage, cauliflower cooked in duck fat, crispy potatoes and grilled cheese with duck egg. I would give solid recommendations for the grilled cheese, tuna collar and crispy potatoes. The grilled cheese is extremely simple, but the bread was crispy and fluffy and sandwiched a light white cheese that set off the runny duck egg. I would not recommend the two main dishes we ordered - the spaghettini was dry and tuna hearts don't have much flavor and the sausage wasn't very well seasoned (the side salad was delicious though). I am neutral on the cauliflower...perhaps my palate was just overwhelmed by the heaviness of the duck fat. I would give this restaurant another try though - I thought the dishes were creative and the chef was certainly adventurous.

I've been wanting to try this place out for a looooong time. So, when my anniversary was coming up I thought it would be the perfect place to take my boyfriend. \n\nWe had the following: \n\nLittle gems 3/5: We both actually thought this was the crispy pig ears by itself but it actually came as a topping to a salad.  It was still good, but we both felt the buttermilk ranch dressing was a little too much.. too much dressing and a bit salty. \n\nBeef heart tartar 5/5: This dish was delicious. Everything about it was perfect. The seasonings, texture, flavor, and even the crusted bread that came with it. Highly recommend!! \n\nWood oven's pig head 5/5: Although this item was really rich (as everyone says), I feel like it was still really good. Great crispy skin and flavor. People who complain about the head being too rich and knocking off points for it is being unreasonable. I feel like this dish isn't meant for just 2 people to eat it.. and it isn't a MAIN dish.  Because it's so rich, it should be shared and even having a little portion of it is enough.  My bf and I decided to get it because we just had to. You can't find anything else like that in the city. \n\nOld Fashion 5/5: The bartender made this drink perfect. \n\nOverall, we had a great anniversary dinner here. We were seated by the bar in front of the oven, which was fine because we got to see them cook and they were kind to answer any questions. One thing I loved was that Chef Chris Cosentino was there and checked every single plate before it went out. It's nice to see a successful chef still hang around and work in his restaurant.

Yeah don't come here.\n\n*** In Depth ***\n\nAh, this is an hard review to have to write. I was definitely on the hype train for Cockscomb, given all the great things that I'd heard from friends about it. We came as a group of six, and, unfortunately, had to limit our pork options since one person in our party didn't eat it, leading to orders of the:\n\n* Squid... something - Probably the tastiest dish of the night, which is unfortunate because there were six of us, and one of this little appetizer/side. And, yet, oddly, none of us remember exactly what it was we ordered: I'm inclined to think it was a pasta dish, but don't quote me on that.\n\n* Pig Skin Noodles - My hearing must not be what it once was, because I completely misheard/understood how this dish was prepared, after asking our waiter, thinking it was pig skin inside a noodle dish. But nope, the noodles themselves are actually made from pig skin :o Tasty, and, as you'd expect, incredibly rich and fatty. The texture of the \"noodles\" is, well, chewy and squishy, so prepare yourselves.\n\n* Pin Bone Steak - So, this was the centerpiece. Some tables went with the pig head, some with this, and others with both. Given the aforementioned pork limiter, we opted for the steak, and... any disappointment I had lay almost entirely in this dish. Yes, the quality of the meat was quite good, but our medium rare steak ended up coming out more as a rare steak, and one that seemed unseasoned, almost. I'm not usually one to complain about bland food, since I eat lighter than most, but EVERYONE in our group thought this was bland, even with the provided jus and bone marrow dip. It was bland enough that we had to bust out the salt shaker, which I haven't done since... 15 years ago?\n\n* Panna Cotta - Not something I usually order because, well, I'm lactose intolerant, but that I've somehow probably had more of than any other fancier dessert. And theirs was QUITE delicious, creamy, and rich.\n\nSide dishes aren't enough to save a restaurant, and, while I rarely given two star first experiences a second chance, there's a good chance I will with Cockscomb, since my friends insisted that this was probably a one off fluke. So, until then, 2.5 stars for the place.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - I can't speak for the main floor of the restaurant, but they do have an elevator that goes up to the second floor, where I'm guessing the larger parties are seated. Given that, I can't imagine the ground floor posing much of a problem.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try.", "author": "Johnny W."}

Regardless, I still felt the need to dust off my Yelp account (literally I haven't written a review in 5 years) to warn folks of this place....\n\nI give it 1-star for our experience of having to hear Mr. Cosentino BARK constantly at the cooks which is incredible off-putting to hear while dining. The kitchen is open and we were seated very close to Mr. Cosentino who stands on the outside of the kitchen near the bar seating and just constantly BARKS out orders and demands to his staff. Those seated in other parts of the restaurant probably couldn't hear it and honestly, I'm certain other restaurants are just the same. But maybe take a moment and realize that people coming in don't want to hear you sound like a COCKS....(the restaurant name is all too fitting....) Perhaps leave those few seats, right next to your loud and obnoxious voice, empty so everyone dining can have the same pleasant experience. \n\nSo a tip for those going. Request NOT to sit near the kitchen. Unless you like to hear demands and watch the staff look anxious. \n\nAs for the food.... We had the Impossible burger there at lunch. It's one of two places you can currently get it in SF other than the food truck. Thus we didn't have much choice in order to try it. The wait was not long and the burger is quite good.

I have also had great service the few times I have been here. \n\nBut today I came for lunch with my coworkers and a candidate we brought out to lunch as a part of our interview process and it was a terrible dining experience that I would expect a lot better from a place of this quality. Our server was super awesome and sweet and I don't think the mistake that happened was at all his fault.\n\nThe candidate and I ordered the EXACT same burger and my two coworkers ordered something else. The candidate's burger came out at 12:40pm.... They brought no one else's food. We told him to just eat as obviously a burger isn't the same cold. After 10 minutes pass I get up to inform our server that only one persons meal came out and no one else's. I worked in fine dining for years with Chefs like Thomas Keller, so yes I have high expectations but this was beyond me having high expectations. The rest of our food did not come out until 1:05....\n\nTHAT'S 25 MINUTES LATER...!!!!!\n\nThe only reason why I know the times was because it was SO AWKWARD.... to have the candidate we barely know feeling like he didn't know if he should eat or not and us just twiddling our thumbs until he finally gave in and ate because his food would have for sure been cold. He finished his ENTIRE meal by the time we finally got our food. Normally, I wouldn't be this upset but it caused me SERIOUS anxiety and I couldn't enjoy our meal or carry a normal conversation. Having worked in the food industry it's worse than nails on a chalkboard to have this happen. 25 minutes is NOT acceptable.\n\nBut here is the kicker.... Even after I very kindly mentioned to the server none of our food came out except one person, the manager thought an acceptable way to make this better was to just bring him out another burger for him to have something to eat while we ate. ?!?! He JUST ate an entire burger there was no way he was going to be able to eat a second so when they brought it he was like well.... can you wrap it up togo, cause I am pretty full.\n\nI honestly was flabbergasted that he not only didn't comp the burger but didn't send us any extras or comp anything at all off the bill. We had to pay the full bill. There is no way in any world that this is acceptable. Again, I am speaking from restaurant management experience. We paid $40/each which obviously the whole dining experience goes into that price. We still got charged for a super shitty dining experience. \n\nTo management: I would have let this all slide and not have written a review if you had righted your wrong but the manager on duty hardly even apologized he just said it was weird and shouldn't have happened. The server on the other hand did apologize profusely even though it wasn't his fault. This makes me feel terrible for the servers that have to work here. Most people blame all these problems on the server and tip poorly because of it. Fortunately, I knew he still deserved his full 20%. But by the managers not supporting their servers and comping things that 100% should be comped makes me think they treat their servers pretty poorly and I don't support business' like that.\n\nThis is my first ever review on yelp so that can give you an idea of how much this really irritated me... I didn't even have to pay for the meal so I honestly don't even care for free things I just wanted the manager to make an effort to fix our dining experience instead of me leaving with a terrible taste in my mouth. :/", "author": "Olivia c."}

First off there have been multiple reviews stating the long wait for food so I can confirm that piece. They cook large pieces of meat that take multiple steps between the brick oven and fire pit so it does take time. \n\nFor the food, I had the ceviche, bacon chop, tripe, mushrooms, and heart tartare. All of the food was fantastic except for the tripe. I had high hopes for this one but whether it wasn't cleaned right or the quality, it had a gaminess to it. The bacon chop was well rendered and very tender. The heart was well flavored with a good organ flavor.

Really odd that it was so empty, but the place did get packed by 7pm. Also odd that they have me bar seats for reservations in an empty place. They were nice enough to switch it for a table. Service here is good. The couple next to us tried to sit side by side for a tiny table that is meant for sitting across from each other. They squished into me on the booth side, but the manager/hostess noticed right away and told them they had to sit across from each other or move to the bar if they wanted to sit side by side. I thought that was a nice touch since there was obviously not space for them to sit side by side.\n\n The food, I thought was just ok. To eat we shared the broccoli appetizer and grilled cheese sandwich. But were just ok. For the main course we had the branzino, which I was very excited about since it's hard to find Branzino on the west coast. Actually chose this place for the branzino. Problem was, the fish was tiny and didn't taste very fresh. We also had the basil creme brulee, which was just ok. I did like that they had calicraft buzzerkely on draft though.

My friend and I are huge truffle fans so we could not resist the grilled cheese with shaved truffle on top (yes, please, the truffle was such a nice sweet balance against the cheese) and of course, as soon as the waiter said, \"Now I know you know that foie gras is now available again in Calfornia....\" My friend and I eagerly asked, \"Do you have any??\"  He said, \" Yes, we have a....\"  \"We'll take it!!\"  Do you think we have been deprived?  I say yes.  Haha, when the foie gras arrived, I cut myself a piece trying not to be too greedy because I was sharing the dish with two other people....mmm, I closed my eyes and savored its flavor.  I know it's a controversial dish and it is not completely ethical but I just can't help myself.  Why does it have to be so good?  \n\nAnyway I digress - we also ordered the pig skin spaghetti (my friend didn't care for the sauce, a little to salty?, I didn't mind at all, I thought it was tasty) and the bone marrow (creamy smooth, yummy).  All of the above so far was tasty but not necessarily all good for the heart so we also ordered some sauteed chard - that was a good balance (well, let's just say it was).  \n\nFor dessert, we had cheese with honey and walnuts and a layered crepe cake with fruit.  I'm not a big dessert person but I liked what we had.  \n\nChef Chris Cosentino came by and took a picture with us after dinner - now who couldn't love that after I had seen him on TV with Anthony Bourdain a number of times!!

It was very exciting to see the chefs in action in the open kitchen. Chris Cosentino, of course, lead the action. \n\nWe started with the 'Eggs Eggs Eggs', the Beef Heart Tartare and the Bone Marrow. An egg is something that seems so simple yet can be prepared exquisitely, as Cockscomb did. Of course, the flavors of the salmon oil and tarragon aioli added to the well-cooked eggs. The heart beef tartare was a wild adventure in my mouth. Slimy yet firm and flavorful at the same time. It was perfect on top of grilled bread! The Bone Marrow was a combo of beef, pig and lamb marrow.\n \nFor the main show, I got the quail tettrazine. Absolutely heavenly! The quail was deliciously tender and the creme fraiche was perfect with it. My sister got the Bacon Chop which was humongous! It's definitely a dinner for two light eaters like me. It looked pretty porkingly overwhelming, but boy was it delicious!!\n\nChris was gracious enough to come over and say hi as well as to take pictures.

Everything is tasty except for the ground pork shoulder burger which was completely void of flavor. The fried potato accompaniment was very good... but it is nearly impossible for fried potatoes to be bad.\n\nRoasted pepper appetizer was tasty as was the hot mess. Both needed some bread however to soak up the flavors.\n\nBeef heart tartare was very bland, really needed capers or something acidic to bring out some flavor.\n\nThe medium sized oyster platter also fell flat. Tiny gritty oysters apparently shucked with a hammer. Whoever was responsible for the oysters really needs to reconsider their career choice. Three so-so clams when the menu states six, and their tombo tuna poke which was overly salted. The hot mussels in wine were good, but oddly enough planted in the middle of the ice covered platter. It was not possible to get through the mussels before they had chilled far too much.\n\nSpaghettini with tuna heart was decent, but really just one flavor note. Three bites and one is ready to move on.\n\nFinally there was the bacon chop. While it was a good sized piece of pork, it was bland and a little dry.

It was the day before New Years Eve, so there was a lot of prep going on for that night. The room is beautiful, rustic, earthy, and just right for the foods being served.\n\n First, it's way more convenient to park, at least the night we went, compared to Incanto.  Second, the happy hour was phenomenal!  We had a dozen fresh and tasty oysters, a big bowl of crispy potatoes (a melange of cream, cheese, bits of whatever, a crispy creamy potatoes) and a bowl of crispy pig ears.  I had a delicious cider, and my partner had a white wine.  Divine, and too much for snacks, but too good to miss.  We sat on the balcony overlooking the kitchen, where we could see all the prep.  \n\nWe then had dinner at the kitchen bar, and could watch the careful attention to detail and all the various dishes coming out of the kitchen, and the woodburning oven, and grill created a wonderfully warm ambience and excitement.  We had four dishes:  heart tartare, (a wonderfully rich helping, with bread); the cockscomb terrine (how I miss the charcuterie platter from Incanto), and wood fired mushrooms in beef broth, and the highlight, a pig-skin pasta in ragu that must be tasted to believe (really, pigskin cooked and forced through a pasta machine to resemble a translucent pasta). The meal overall was leisurely, exciting to watch, and memorable.  \n\nAfter seeing several \"pinbone steaks\" coming off the grill, I'm coming back with a larger party to try that... the care in preparing a huge cut of meat was amazing... just to get the doneness just right!\n\nCan't wait to come back...

Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with those, but sometimes you want to step away from that ambience and step in to a night of sharing and devouring meat without feeling like at any moment a waiter is going to come over and wipe a crumb from your cheek. Cockscomb embodies this, in my opinion. It holds the fancy up-scale feel but with a more rustic-casual touch (if that even makes sense). \n\nThe restaurant is located in an unpretentious area and you could very easily miss it. Parking will probably be close to impossible on a busy night but on a random weekday, we found parking just down the alley.  \n\nWe were seated at the very top of the restaurant, snuggled right into a corner booth. Our waiter, whose name I really wish I remembered, took our drink orders: inside out (gin/cranberry/egg white) and a beer. \n\nWe started off with oysters and the charcuterie platter. The oysters were a mix of local (T. Bay) and Washington (go huskies!). All were, not too big and not too small, and a good balance of sweet and salty oceany flavor. The charcuterie platter was a great size to share for two-came with slices of bread and pickles! The meat choices themselves had a variety of textures and levels of saltiness. My one gripe is that the edges of the bread felt like it was cutting my mouth because it was really toasted. \n\nWe were going to do the pigs head but I read too many reviews stating it was pure fat- then we moved on to the pin bone steak but our waiter (thankfully) said that it would be way too much and is usually for a group of 4+. We settled on one of the shareable specials: ribeye with whole crab served with veg. Not only was this the perfect size for us but the presentation was on point as well. I was scared I was going to be flinging crab shell everywhere but the shell was so soft! The meat inside was cooked perfectly and had amazing crab flavor/texture. Our steak was seasoned nicely but just wasn't as tender as we would have expected. The veg (brocolini?) stood out to me because the added lemon juice or citrus on there helped cut the meat/crab/butter. Usually sides of veg are just bleh in flavor but this was really really good! \n\nFor sides- we just ordered the gnocchi per waiters suggestion. This was literally melt in your mouth. Other gnocchi I've had in the past usually has a bite to it but these.. wow. Had to pack it up to take it home but still delicious! \n\n We didn't have room for dessert so ended our night there. Incredible service and food, a lovely change up from our normal anniversary dinner setting.

The honey grilled cheese was not your typical grilled cheese. It was made with what seemed to be possibly goat cheese with just the right amount of honey on top, a great pairing and a delight for grilled cheese lovers everywhere. The salad was presented well. We ordered the Coulotte Steak and Cornish Game Hen for the main portion of our meal. The steak was sliced into small pieces and was delicious, just the right portion for a small person such as myself. The Cornish Game Hen consisted of a much larger portion than the steak, enough so that we were able to eat until satisfied and have enough for lunch the next day! The hen may appear to be burnt in the pictures on yelp but it has a lot of flavor and a good amount of meat! Don't let the pictures deter you from ordering it.

It really pained me to write the previous one, as angsty as I sounded, I swear, I didn't want to go to a negative place. All that being said, I gave it another go and returned for lunch last week. \nI made a reservation and was seated right away even though my lunch date hadn't shown yet. I was sat at the bar as I requested in my reservation. I ordered the impossible burger and it didn't disappoint. It was great! I loved the addition of the gruyere and caramelized onions and all the other toppings were spot on. The patty itself was interesting, in a good way. It didn't really taste like anything else I have had. I think the best part is how much it resembled a pink, medium cooked beef patty. It was juicy and tender, it was kinda bizarre but wonderful at the same time. \nOur server was wonderful, very attentive and let us linger after our meal without making us feel like we needed to hightail it outta there. \nI'll come back again for dinner and chalk up my first time as just bad luck on my part.", "author": "Sarah M."}

I opted for the negroni and it was well made - only thing is it was served on ice cubes so I had to fish out several of them to prevent my drink from getting diluted too rapidly.\n\nFor bar snacks, we shared some $1 oysters and the crispy pig ears ($3).  I forget the oyster variety that day, but they were fresh and creamy (and also huge!) and served with a lightly sweet celery mignonette.  But onto the crispy pig ears... wow.  There were two types of texture - crispy and gelatinous, and they were slightly spicy and served with fresh herbs (cilantro, basil, chives) and with a little bit of lime juice, it was divine.  I will definitely order these again and again on subsequent visits!\n\nLastly, when we came for HH on a Thursday (on a non-Giants game day) it was not too crowded - I guess not many can make the Mon-Thurs 5-6pm HH.

Now I'm a fan of offal, and I've tried all sorts, whether it was at Incanto or just with traditional chinese cooking. The duck liver was really livery and irony. It definitely wasn't to my tastes, nor the taste of the other diners at our table. We even tried the liver on the toast with the picked peaches. It helped with the flavor a bit, but didn't save it much. \n\nGrilled cheese with truffle. Wasn't amazing either. I think the cheese wasn't gooey enough and the bread wasn't butter/fried enough. The truffles were a nice taste, but I didn't think it complemented the dish well. \n\nThe special sausage plate was the best part of the meal.

I made a reservation via seat me yet for both occasion did not seem to be necessary on a weekday night. Our group ordered their special 4lbs pinbone steak, topped with foie gras. We also ordered a few sides to accompany the main dish. I was really drawn to this restaurant due to he circulation pigs head pic I've been seeing on some friends' Instagram. Coming to he restaurant with a Jewish person was not the best situation in trying to order it though. Anyway, the pin bone steak was great. Perfectly seared foie stop a massive peace of meat. We asked for it to be cooked medium, yet the steak came mostly medium rare. It actually worked in my favor since I do like my steak medium rare, but if you're the type that is particular with bloody steak, i suggest you go a little more cooked than your usual. The sides were good, I think the mushrooms were my favorite. For dessert we shared the Chocolate cake and a dessert with citrus fruits with whipped cream. Quite honestly, the desserts where a little underwhelming. \n\nThe following night, one of my other friends texted and we decided to go back for the sole purpose of the pigs head. if you like chicharon, crispy skin, this is your meal. I do enjoy crispy skin but as an entree, with all the fat, and barely any lean meat, it got too much. Although I'm glad I went for the experience. Come on, how many people can say they ate half a pigs head? To top that dinner, we had a couple of dessert again, we had the creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e infused with lime and the apple tart. The creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e is definitely the best dessert there, although it's a shame that the sugar br\u00fbl\u00e9e did not crack at first strike.\n\nAll in all, it's a great restaurant to experience food.\n\nI forgot to mention that on the second, I met the chef, Cris Cosentino.

The table was setup for the shared supper format, the courses  included fish collar , Liberty Duck, the spring Lamb, whole seabass and pig's head.  The addition of  the Asparagus (absolutely amazing love the Bearnaise), rainbow chard and duck fat Cauliflower were our accompaniments. The lamb was definitely my favorite but the seabass and fish collar were out of sight as well.

I didn't comprehend the name until he broke it out into syllables: Cock as in chicken and comb as in a hair comb.  After that, it was easy for me to Yelp it and grab the address.  Cockscomb is located on the corner of 4th and Freelon but the more familiar streets would be either Brannan or Bryant.  Street parking is your friend and usually there's a good amount of metered parking on Bryant Street.  There's two floors available and I personally think the top floor is slightly quieter than the bottom floor.\n\nThe waiter is friendly but extremely animated when it's his turn to describe in detail the various offering of today's menu.  I'd say he has a mutant power of memorization because he recited all of the little bells and whistles of each and every item.  We had to ask about a few items due to allergies and the waiter alleviated our concerns with confidence.  Anyhoo, here's the feast we ordered:\n\n- Pig Head = Half of a pigs head cooked for 45 min in their secret oven.\n- Bone Marrow = Bone marrow with bread\n- Bacon Chop = Pork chops\n- Grilled Cheese = sandwich\n- Hot Mess = Foie Gras special\n- Duck Fat Squash = Squash drizzled with fat from a fowl\n- Little Gems = Salad.  The only veggies we ordered.\n- Apricot dessert\n\nThe pig head is the signature thing you want to set your eyes on.  It's half of a pig's head braised for hours? (or days?) and cooked in the oven for 45 min before served to you.  The meat is extremely soft and tender.  The ears are crispy and chewy.  You may want to save them ears for your dog at home because it's a great treat.  This item serves 2-3.  The other notable items I want to point out are the Hot Mess and Duck Fat Squash.  The Hot Mess isn't always on the menu (it's a special) but it's basically Foie Gras.  If you're a fan of this delicacy, you don't want to miss out on it.

Based on my visit last night, fairly, the experience was more of a 3.5 stars but I am a big fan of the Chef Chris Cosentino, and there were several things that were 4 stars worthy last night.. so lets just say I'm being generous and I'm rating this 4 stars\n\nWe walked in around 5:30 on a Wednesday without a reservation & the bar area upstairs looked crowded for \"Happy Hour\" but the dining area downstairs was still empty & Chef C was briefing some of the kitchen crews before someone, presumably \"also a chef\" friend walked in and Chef C took her around to check out this new restaurant (we later spotted Chef Traci Des Jardins walking in).\n\nWe decided to  sit in the dining room since my hubby was not too crazy about $1 happy hour oyster & $3 crispy pig ears (he's not that adventurous *sigh!).\n\nThe waiter was cordial but not personable. He gave us one of those vibe of a salesman who tries to sell us what we don't need with the attitude, \"oh, you never been here before, really?\". The two female hostesses were certainly very kind and sweet & gave us that warm welcoming feelings as we walked in (and patiently waited for us as hubby & I discussed about whether we would take the bar seating or the dining room). So, in terms of service, it was a bit of a mixed bag!\n\nThere were lots of OFF the menu/specials that the waiter verbally informed & described to us. While the waiter did a great job describing every single off the menu dishes verbally, it was hard to keep track of as there were like 5-7 different things (lamb heart salad, blood sausage dish, pig skin spaghetti, shared surf&turf dish, and a couple other things that I can't remember! too much verbal information!). My suggestion to Cockscomb is to have the dishes WRITTEN down, especially since the dishes come with fancy \"gourmet language\" components.\n\nWe ordered the \"last supper\", an appetizer size dish that comes with a slice of toasted bread, a sunny side up egg, a blood sausage, 2 poached oysters and and pinch of greens tossed in vinaigrette dressing with some broth-like sauce. There were several component in this dish, enough to get my hubby (a non foodie) confused how to eat it (I had to think how to tackle the dish!) perhaps, instructions from the server would have helped. What I did was, I cut and spread the blood sausage on the bread, topped it with some of the greens, fried egg and a bit of the oyster and then using the spoon, pour the sauce on top. It truly was a delicious dish! I was a bit worried as the sauce alone was very salty. However, after putting all the components together, the sauce was just right. The oysters were perfectly poached, not over- cooked (a bit fishy, but tolerable), very creamy, even the non-oyster-eater-hubby liked it. This dish was $22, not cheap, but I gave the chef kudo for the \"creativity\", bold flavors and the fact that he made blood sausage, as gross as it sounds!, tasted good. fyi, this was words from my non-adventurous husband!\n\nFor main course, I ordered Coulotte Steak which to my surprise, came out as if it was a steak salad. The Beef was very tender and flavorful but I wasn't fully in love with the fact that the steak (already sliced) was served on top of cold fresh tomato & green salad. Although, the tomatoes, actually made the plate \"worked\" as I wasn't too crazy with the flavor of the vinaigrette dressing with the beef...but the sweetness from the tomatoes (they peeled the skin off) made the dish delectable. I also wish, it was a bigger sized dish... there were perhaps about 6 oz of beef on the plate. The price tag for this dish was $32. \n\n Hubby ordered what he thought a regular hamburger (beef patty) but it was a \"pork\" burger! The burger was thick & big, I appreciate the portion was big for $15 (this was the most bang for your bucks on their menu). The pork was very tender, not dry,  & thick (lots of meat!). BUT, it lacked flavors, wish they would salt it a bit more. There was a bit of caramelized onions, & too few greens to even taste them & it was hard to get all components in 1 bite due to the thickness (the bread was also thick). The burger was served with crispy fried potatoes, good but also very fried. the sauce that came with it was some kind of garlicky cream cheese, yumm. Hubby didn't finish his burger and the buss boy packed it to go for us. To my surprise, he also packed the sauce, awesome!!!\n\nFor dessert.. the menu was again just very short.. \"Chocolate, Fruit, Cheese\" $7 each was very surprising as everything else was pricey! We opted for \"chocolate\" which was like chocolate ganache thing with sea salt, orange marmalade & mascarpone cheese. Yummy but not spectacular, not overly sweet, a good ending to our dinner date in the city.\n\nOverall, this is not a traditional fine dining place. The place screams modern new-cuisine restaurant & suitable for those who are adventurous with no dietary restriction.\n\nI would like to come back when I feel adventurous again.", "author": "Yun C."}

We came on a Wednesday night at 6:30 PM and the restaurant was already full. For all you meatlovers and daredevils, this is heaven. The meal was so meat-heavy that I didn't crave meat for days. Actually, I ate so much that the thought of meat made me uncomfortable. The menu offers pretty much any part of the animal that you can think of. Like pig skin, pig trotters, beef heart tartare, tons of liver, and pig head so get ready for an adventurous meal! \n\nThe setting works perfectly for large groups especially when you're trying to share a whole chicken, a 4 lb. sirloin, and 10 other dishes. But this is not to say that you shouldn't come here on a date night. Just be prepared to eat and unbutton your pants after 15 minutes. \n\n-- Orders --\n----------------\n- Special: 4 Lb. Bone in Sirloin [Recommend - Best dish of the night!] \n- Special: Whole chicken (including the feet and the head) in a pot with potatoes, carrots, and shallots\n- \"Hot Mess\" Pig Trotters with Foie Gras & Strawberries [Recommend]\n- Halibut Crudo\n- Oysters\n- Roasted eggplant\n- Bacon Chop with peaches and greens [Recommend - very nicely spiced]\n- Oven Roasted Beets\n- Summer Squash\n- Butcher's choice: Pig skin spaghetti (which actually had a chewy texture like spaghetti) \n- Dessert: Fruit \"Cobbler\" [Recommend - Perfect conclusion]\n- Dessert: \"Panna Cotta\"\n- Dessert: A type of \"Chocolate\" Mousse\n----------------\n\nAll the \"Supper\" and \"Shared Supper\" items were huge. The 4 lb sirloin is a must-get if you have a big enough group to finish it. They included foie gras and something that resembles fermented and spiced cabbage. We had eight people in the group to devour this and paired it with veggies like the eggplant and the squash for a more balanced dinner. The foie gras with the strawberries was succulent!! I loved the strawberries..It worked really well with the foie gras and the trotters. Everything melts in your mouth. \n\nOh, and you have to get a dessert, no matter how full you are. The fruit cobbler was soooooo good! There were some granola or oat crumbs with a variety of baked fruit. It was my second favorite thing after the sirloin which left a lasting impression. Because not only is the meat good...but the desserts are also spectacular. \n\nI regret not ordering the bruschetta, pig head, beef heart tartare, and the grilled cheese. But I'll be back!! Plus the butcher's choice and the bruschetta changes so there's always something new to try.", "author": "Ingrid C."}

I'd imagine the Impossible Burger tastes like real beef...if you're a vegan. For me, the only thing \"impossible\" about this $19 \"burger\" is that I'll choose to eat it again when I can enjoy a better burger at In-N-Out (and for a fraction of the price). Yes, I compared a plant-based meat burger at a restaurant run by a celebrity chef to a beef burger at a fast food restaurant. Why shouldn't I when there's such a huge price-to-enjoyment disparity?\n\nI had higher hopes for the grilled cheese sandwich, but despite the addition of honey and a duck egg, I wasn't impressed.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-06-19", "description": "Chef Cosentino what more do we need to ask for? The menu at Cockscomb is filled with wonderful goodies. I had the pleasure of going to Cockscomb right after foie gras was back! I was able to try a variety of dishes. The great thing about this restaurant is a lot of the dishes rotate on the menu depending on the season/day and you can often get treated with a surprise item on the menu.\n\nThe bone marrow with smoked fried oysters and watercress was cooked to perfection and maybe one of the top bone marrows I have ever eaten. The ingredients in this dish come together very well.\nThe Bavette Steak with roasted carrots, and onions was perfect. The meat was cooked perfectly to temp and the vegetables were also very well prepared.\nThe Wood oven roasted pigs head was the star of dinner. Served with chicories, capers, and brainaise (mayo + pig brains). The skin was crispy and  the meat was mouth watering and pulled apart. The vegetables helped to cut the fat but every bite was perfect. Everything was hot so the meat was not overly greasy or what some may think it would be like eating a nice fatty head of pig. I would order this again in a heart beat! \nHot Mess pig trotters, foie gras, and grape jam this dish was great. The pig trotters were probably my favorite component of this dish.  Foie gras is always great but to make pig trotters shine is a great thing. Every component of this dish works together flawlessly.  If you have a chance to order this dish I would recommend it also.\nMandarin Orange Mille Crepe Cake, and the other dessert I ordered was great. Nothing was too sweet and the flavors all worked together. \n\nThis was enough food for 3 people to eat. We were all able to share the food and have left overs. From service, location, food, ambiance I have to give Cockscomb 5 stars. If you're in SF and want a great unique experience try Cockscomb!", "author": "Alex V."}

The sweetness of the honey...the richness of the egg...the saltiness and melty texture of the cheese.  It's really well balanced.    \n\nThe albacore collar is huge!  I thought we were getting a small piece of fish collar like what you'd get at a Japanese restaurant, but this seemed like the tuna's entire collar!  The herbs and peppercorns that it's roasted with taste really good even without a bite of fish.  The meat is tender, fatty, tasty.  This is a must try if you see it as a special again.  \n\nThe portion of mushrooms was a little smaller than I had expected but they were good.\n\nWhat carnivore doesn't want a massive board of steak?  The pin bone steak has both the bottom and top sirloin.  I'm a medium rare guy, and it was cooked to perfection.  On the side you have an au jus that's good, but I really loved the bone marrow sauce that also comes on the side. Spoon a little bit over your steak and you're living the dream!\n\nThe bacon chop...a giant, roasted slab of pork belly.  Wow!\n\nThe blueberry cobbler wasn't your standard heavy cobbler.  You get a lot of fruit topped with some granola and a thick quenelle of a lemon cream.  It's not very sweet.  I would have preferred a little more sweetness but everybody else at the table really enjoyed it.  \n\nThis isn't a true profiterole...I just don't remember what they called it.  This dish had a profiterole-like texture but was shaped like a thin bagel, cut in half and filled with chocolate and whipped cream.  This was definitely sweeter than the blueberry cobbler and I loved it.\n\n4 hungry people ate this meal.  I'm glad that my wife and I didn't eat much during the day because this was a massive amount of awesome food.   We had enough leftovers to feed a 5th person, but that was on purpose.

I would not feed that steak to my worst enemy or my dog. Tons (I mean literally, COVERED) in fat. Of the ~25 pieces of meat, maybe 1 was edible. And even that 1 piece tasted awful. Mushy and had a very odd taste. Also, the steak was basically charred beyond recognition. There was a layer of black char measuring at least 1-inch thick.  It is insulting that somebody could be OK with trying to charge me $125 for that pathetic excuse for a steak\n\nWould be better off buying steak from wal mart and cooking it myself. I complained and they gave us 50% off, and I still feel like I was ripped off. They asked if we wanted to pack it to go which we obviously had no interest in doing. Also FYI if they tell you they only have \"1 left\" of any of the pricier specials, don't fall for it lol\n\nFor as bad as the steak was, I'm amazed they did not offer to remove it from our bill entirely. Any legitimate fine dining establishment that is willing to put its $ where it's mouth is would have immediately offered to make this right.

Pretty much, this is the seat where I was drooling over all the items I didn't order, but wanted to... like this MASSIVE pin bone steak with bone marrow dip.\n\nThis is Chris Cosentino's latest restaurant in San Francisco. He's the winner of Top Chef Masters and even had his own show on the Food Network (Chefs VS. City).\n\nFor all you meat lovers and red-blooded carnivores, this is where you NEED to be. Trust me. The menu reflects Cosentino's background in butchery and his love of offal is obvious: there's even a wood oven-roasted pig's head on the menu.\n\nSide: The HUGE pig head kinda freaks me out, so if I'm feeling a bit more ballzy next time... I might order it.\n\nNow moving onto the food, here's what we had:\n\n+ Beef heart tartare is unlike anything I've ever had ($16). It comes with a helping of arugula and seasoned potatoes which were so on point! The quality of the meat was super fresh and it got me really excited for everything else to come. It's probably one of the best appetizers on the menu.\n\n+ Crudo of the day ($16) was dressed similar to a ceviche style, using lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos were added for a nice kick, and cucumbers brought a crispness to each bite.\n\n+ OMG this bacon chop ($32). Ok, so.....this thing is huge! Every bite was super tender and it's perfectly grilled and juicy on the inside. We couldn't finish half of it since the other dishes were pretty large as well.\n\nIt was honestly one of the best bacon chops ever, but I found it a little toooo fatty (I had to remove the fat to prevent next-day bloating and meat sweats).\n\n+ This quail tetrazzini ($35) is absolutely heavenly! The quail was deliciously tender and the creme fraiche went perfect with it. I thought it was the best thing of the night: juicy, flavorful, melted off the bones. The garnishes also added a nice crunch to each bite. This is a MUST GET.\n\nAnd if you happen to come here with a vegetarian (not sure why you would), but this whole roasted branzino ($35)  is a great option.\n\nTo sum it all up:\n\nCockscomb is the kind of place where you go with friends (meat lovers). And when the food comes out, everyone stops talking. It's time to eat.\n\nI made the mistake of coming here with only my boyfriend. So we ended up sitting at the counter while drooling over everyone else's food.\n\nThe tartare and quail are MUST GETS.

Did you read any notes on OpenTable? \nMaybe I am just spoiled but generally I at least get a welcome \"Happy Bday\" or a nicer table due to the event. \nOn to service.

I would gently suggest that they need to ease off the heavy-handed loading up of the \"Impossible Burger\" with way too many grilled onions way too much cheese, way too much mustard, etc.  But having said that, the \"Impossible Burger\" is terrific.  And the bun is off-the-charts perfect.  Great job!  I need to not-so-gently say that Cockscomb needs a complete re-work of their approach to service.  We waited 20 minutes after being seated at lunch for the waiter to make his first appearance -- not acceptable.  Our drinks arrived AFTER our food arrived -- not acceptable.  The people next to us nearly got up and walked out because the wait for their food was so long (they were already seated when we arrived, and they still hadn't received their food when we were done with our food!).  Employees are busy running around but don't seem to be focused on the very customers they are there to serve.  The service needs to be raised to the high bar that the \"Impossible Burger\" brings to the table.  Because the \"Impossible Burger\" is sooooo good, I'm giving five stars in the hope that Cockscomb will do a major tune-up on their service, because what they are doing is not worthy of the amazing \"Impossible Burger.\"", "author": "Thomas M."}

I was glad the waiter suggested a starch, and who doesn't like potatoes with steak?\n\nI was disappointed when we arrived and I didn't see Chef Chris Cosentino, but on the way out I saw him.  He was so busy, and I really felt bad interupting him to ask for a picture, but I worked up the courage to approach him.  He asked me to give him a few minutes.  A few minutes later he walked over and took a picture.  I told him the food was awesome and we really enjoyed ourselves, and he was super friendly.  I love when you admire someone, and have this image of who they are as a person & they live up to your expectations.

Pricing fair.\n\nI think our server was waaaay more interested in flirting with girls at neighboring tables, and with them you could observe him being extremely professional while also being proactive, prompt, and charming. He was notably more interested in tables with groups of at least 2 girls; then he was all interest, energy, etc. Working for that tip I guess. My table, with a male friend; and eventually the couple that arrived next to us -- not such attentive service. Had to literally flag/wave him down. We tipped generously, but he definitely didn't deserve it. \n\nEspecially because I told him at the start it was my friend's birthday. No effort was taken at the start to wish him a happy birthday, to offer a little something in celebration (free drink? extra app? scoop of ice cream? SOMETHING?), or to even SAY \"Happy Birthday.\" He just shrugged and said, \"Okay.\" Yeah, you know what, now that I think of it, I'll just say the guy was a bit of a dick, if you want to add it all together. Stop trolling for girlfriends and fat tips and get over yourself.\n\nAnyway, to the food -- it was \"good,\" but kind of on the 3.5/4 line and then the service just took it down to 3. Pate came to the table with literally 3-4 thick baguette-stubby slices of bread. The pate was the size of a sandwich slice. Does that make sense to you? I appreciate getting more pate but perhaps you should provide more bread, or halve its size (the pate) and offer thinner crostini-thick slices of carb to better facilitate the pate?\n\nAll the dishes kind of blurred together as rich and meaty. Shepherd's stew (I think that was the name) was pretty good. \"Chef recommends that you break the crust on top down into the stew before eating.\" Perhaps, but, we are nibbling on this and if we did that at the beginning this would make our crust soggy, which is sacrilege my friend.\n\nDesserts were pretty good, especially the crema fruit thingie that was all whipped -- reminded me of a dessert featured on Top Chef that Chef Colicchio said was his \"all-time favorite in the history of the show.\" Nice texture, very light play on textures and layers and crunch and air.\n\nProbably won't return again. I do love meat but rarely, and if you add on the attitude/service issue, just isn't worth it. Better food and service elsewhere.", "author": "Miriam W."}

Showed up for lunch wanting to try the impossible burger. Im some what a strict vegetarian, I don't eat dairy or eggs but after looking at the menu it had no where listed this burger would have cheese, ordered it and it came with cheese, I can honestly look past that though, scraped it off. For the impossible burger each chef has their own interpretation/presentation, this one looked great and each component was great too. This was the kinda burger you see at your local gastro pub. \n\nThe patty itself was composed of shredded like meat? The texture was like a burger, the taste was exactly like a burger. However the patty sorta fell apart. Along with that was a greasiness that the sign of a good burger, a surprising feature for a reverse engineered burger. \n\nThe bun was what we all hoped for in a burger, soft, but structurally secure.\n\nas far as the stuff between the buns, not a fan. It seem that a lot of gastronomical cooks and chefs love adding shredded lettuce in a burger, but in all honesty it is just gross, the bun cooks the frail lettuce creating a sort of steamy sad salad in the middle of a burger, the sauce was a bit strong competing with the burger itself. As for the pickle, loved it.\n\nAll in all a great burger, probably the best Veggie burger I ever had, but in the end it was quite heavy for a veggie burger, I felt sick walking back to the bart station, but it could just be me being weak over a burger.

At one point, my friend poked her finger into the pig's face, and it was mushy and fat juices just squirted all over the place. I'm one of the largest advocates of fatty dishes and it was way too much for even me. We were a group of 4 and only made our way through 1/4th of the pig's head. By the end of the meal, we all felt like we were sweating pig juices and felt uneasy and slightly disgusted. \n\nWe also ordered a few appetizers, including the beef heart tartare, and although they were certainly better than the pig's head, they were still only OK -- nothing to write home about.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-03-02", "description": "With all the mixed reviews, I came here slightly hopeful--but with a somewhat of a low expectation. My dining mate and I had reservations but we came early and were able to be seated right away. We came around the beginning of dinner service so we were one of the few patrons there, however when we left, it was really crowded. The ambiance and the music was really good. Tables are really close together as most SF restaurants are so that was pretty understandable. Our server [Justin I think?] was really on point in describing the specials and gave us a thorough run down of the menu. Coming in with an idea of what we wanted-- we ordered barely any of those because of his great recommendations.\n\nOysters: For $3 each and a minimum of 1/2 a dozen, we stuck to the west coast oysters because  I generally like the smaller ones more. Nothing really stuck out about the oysters so I'd probably recommend skipping it. Its very easy to find fresh oysters in the city so you're probably better off saving room for other yummies.\n\nCrudo: The crudo of the day was a white fish in the mahi mahi family which the name totally escapes me right now. It was dressed similar to a ceviche style with nice lime juices to bring out the flavors. Thin slices of jalepenos for a nice kick, and cucumbers to bring a crispness to it. A good dish, but again, not something I'd order again only because you can find this almost anywhere in the city.\n\nBeef heart tartare: YUM. Get this. I was pretty disappointed that ours didn't have a quail egg that I've seen boasted everywhere online/yelp. Ours came with a mustard-y sauce that didn't really add anything to the dish except make it easier to mix? This dish comes with two pieces of crostini/toast so my dining mate and I each got one. I went for the route where you slab a heavy layer of the beef heart tartare on and spread it then top it off with the arugula. The arugula was seasoned really salty by itself, but together with everything it was a beautiful dish. This is probably the best way to approach this dish. It comes with a helping of their seasoned potatoes which were also on point! The crispy skin was so nicely seasoned and not over powering. The potatoes were cooked just right so they still had a nice texture without being too starchy. \n\nLittle Gems: Needing some greens to go with our meal we opted for this salad with fried pig ears. I let my mate eat most of the pig ear because they weren't that special to me. I really enjoyed the salad and munched on that. The dressing was really nice and I don't know if its because I haven't allowed myself to have salad dressing in a long time, but I couldn't put my fork down! However towards the bottom of the salad it was pretty drenched making the salad lose its crisp. Maybe opt for the dressing on the side next time.\n\nGrilled Cheese with Truffles: My mate loves grilled cheese. He loves cheese, period. When looking at the menu the night before he said he was probably going to pass on this dish, but upon hearing about how it is there most popular dish, he changed his mind. I am so happy he did! It ended up being a really good dish and one of the top dishes of the night. Judging the pictures doesn't do this dish justice. The beautiful art of having the right consistency for a grilled cheese is really important. Cheese ratio-- not valid because the more the better. The toast complimented the cheese in its beautifully browned texture. The secret to this dish is not the truffles that are on top, but the honey that is used. With a taste in every bite, it was well rounded and delicious. Not overpoweringly sweet, but made a beautiful sweet symphony with the cheese. This portion of the meal was quiet due to the lovemaking of the sandwich and I. \n\nButchers Choice: Clam linguine with pork belly-- This dish was okay. I have been craving pasta for awhile so I thought this dish would help satisfy that craving. Sadly it did not. The texture of the linguine noodles were definitely different and was borderline udon noodles. The sauce was a lime citrus sauce that was really one note. I had to ask for some crush red peppers to give this baby a kick. The clams were okay and I didn't really find any pork belly. Pretty oily and would probably recommend skipping.\n\nButchers Choice: Hot mess-- YISSSSS. YES YES YES. Foie gras on top with a beef patty/croquette it seemed. My mate found the beef patty to have too much going on with a strange consistency, however when he spread the foie gras over it, turned his world upside down. Like, moment of silence, put your fork and knife down good delicious. This ritual happened after every single bite. I don't need to write much on this dish to convince you to get this because you know when theres silence at a dining table, theres magic.\n\nThough we left room for dessert, none of the options were really that impressive. The crafted cocktails were really good and but they need to lose the paper straws!", "author": "Crystal V."}

Stay away if you hate the sweet smokey smells of a wood fired burning oven. Run for your life  if you hate dark and rich charcuterie boards, the freshest shellfish, including oysters, crab, clams, and lobster, iodine rich and smelling of the sea. \n\nBut if you do like any of these things... Then this place is for you! \n\nEarlier this week we sat down to one glass each  of Mumms Brut Champagne & Mionetto Prosecco while we perused the straightforward yet innovative menu. The prosecco was dry and crisp, while the Mumms balanced dry with a hint of butter. \n\nWe started with a cherry tomato salad ($12), served with fresh herbs and an interesting celery vinaigrette. Light, refreshing, and bursting with summer-garden flavor, we both agreed this dish was a winner. \n\nNext up came the charcuterie ($25 for a platter $45 for a board). Dark, sweet prosciutto, terrine, and njuda, which is a spicey spreadable salami. Curiously perfectly,  good bread had been brushed with olive oil and toasted.. in advance - so by time it got to us it was cold, slightly stale and a bit tough. \n\nDuring all this, we were seated at the bar overlooking the open kitchen, a front row seat to all the action. And what action! Sous chef plunking down a 1.5 pound lobster in a saute pan for the night's special? Check. A truly gigantic lamb shoulder, bone in, being prettied up with herbs before serving in it's own all clad roaster for service? Check. Pin bone steak, cooked rare, being sliced on a board for service? Check. After spying the lobster and seeing it plated for customers, we asked, 'why don't we know about this?' Turns out our server never mentioned the night's lobster on special, you can add it to supplement a steak or bacon chop, ($65) or have it on it's own. \n\nIn the end we opted for the bacon chop with lobster side with summer corn/king trumpet mushroom succatash. Then we had to choose, the double chop or single. Seeing the portions coming outta there I knew the double could feed 4 people not 2, so we opted for the single. Good call, 'cause that single chop was humongous. Lobster served pan roasted with spices and a dipping sauce that was both spicy but low in actual heat. \n\nMoving on from our bubbles we each had a glass or two of the Pertinace Nebbiolo ($12) which pared well with the rich and abundant fare. \n\nFinishing off, we ordered a peach tart, made with a butter crust and fresh whipped cream. Impressed, the host came over with two small glasses of brandy, on the house. \n\nI can whole heartedly recommend Cockscomb, somewhat pricey but you get what you pay for 10 times over.

We both noted how well the lobster was cooked, sometimes can get that rubbery/chewy texture when the overcook it.. this was anything but.  Served on the side of this was sauce that seemed like an Asian themed savory bean sauce that tasted great on the lobster.  Get ready to roll up your sleeves, put on your lobster bib and get into some shell cracking for this one though... you will have to work for all the little pieces of meat in those claws too.  \n\nThen, right below it, on the same \"platter\" if you want to call it that, was a fantastically cooked pork tenderloin that was huge, I thought we would be filled up eating just a third of it (both of us) but it had a surprisingly light/braised texture to this piece, almost like they braised it first and then they put it under what I thought was a salamander.  I was corrected by the waiter, when I inquired: \"No, they put it in the wood fired oven to finish it off.\"  However they did it, it was crispy on the scored skin top of the loin, a mostly rendered layer of fat below it that kept the braised portion below nice and moist and you could almost skip eating it (the fat).  Instead, I would eat the crispy skin and then the braised meat so that I didn't get that \"just ate a whole chunk of fat\" sensation that I get sometimes with other cuts of meat.  \n\nWe also had an appetizer that was a play on foie gras, not as spectacular, but the home made mayonnaise was well done.  The Hitachino Nest beer from Japan was excellent.. a light wheat beer that paired perfectly with the appetizer.  The classic dessert was not very memorable, but we took that pork loin home with us (we surprised ourselves and made it through half of it) for a second meal and the skin was still crispy and delicious the next night!  \n\nThe ambiance of the place is pleasant, it has a bit of a rustic feel to it that goes well with the theme of the restaurant, its a bit chilly downstairs, so don't dress too light in the afternoon/evening.  This place is a bit hard to find, I am not sure what kind of destruction the city is wreaking on fourth street outside, but the signage and fact that its behind a construction zone on their side of the street made me miss the place and drive right by the first time.

Coming with a larger group will make it a much more enjoyable experience.\n\nThe item everyone wants is the pigs head. Pretty amazing to see this on a menu and even more surprising to see it in person. People walking by stop and ask to take pictures of it. It is huge and incredibly fatty, we had most of ours bagged up to take home. The waiter said it goes great with eggs. The crispy ears that it comes with are amazing. I wouldn't recommend ordering this as everyone's main course, it is just too fatty, but a very fun and unique dish.\n\nBeef heart tartare was another original dish that I have never seen anyone else do.

Full of flavor. This was my favorite dish of the night.\n\nThe duck liver terrine was incredibly strong. If you are a big liver fan you will enjoy it, but if you are at all on the fence about such things it might be a pass. It comes with some jammed fruit and thick toast to help balance it, but the ratio leaves not enough bread. Had to ask for additional slices to finish it.\n\nThe pin bone steak was huge and would have fed four people as a main entree. The cool factor in this dish was it being served with a chefs knife; very empowering. It was good, but not remarkable as far as on the bone large cuts go. It comes with some toppings which were tasty additions. The steak knives were very sleek Shun knives, which made the meat like a cloud to cut through, really excellent cutlery. \n\nThe desert was phenomenal, and was only $7. An olive oil cake with a lemon cream and br\u00fbl\u00e9ed blood oranges, which were fantastic.\n\nWine by the glass was a bit lacking in variety, only about four choices for red. There were some good reasonably priced options tho. The wine was served in Spiegelau glasses.\n\nAs with most new restaurants, the price of eating there soon after opening is dealing with some hiccups. None of them major, but for the price of the restaurant they added up. We arrived on time for our reservation but had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table. With the larger items on the menu it is unclear how much to order and I feel our waiter made the pigs head seem like less food than it was. I've never left a restaurant with so many leftovers.  Ordered a coffee after dinner and it hadn't come by the end of desert, so we just canceled it. Also we ordered an additional side of bread to finish the terrine and they charged $1 for it. It seems petty to see a one dollar line item for bread on a $300 bill. On the plus side, there was a miscommunication on what we ordered for one of the dishes and they took it off the bill, nice touch.\n\nOverall would recommend this place out of the sheer uniqueness of the food.", "author": "Michael S."}

Given that it was Chris Cosentino's restaurant, there was a greater expectation than usual. \n\nWe ordered/shared the chef's special which was Pork Belly with Alaskan King Crab. The pork belly came in a big slab in which you had to cut in to pieces. This was shared amongst 3 women. I had a bite of the pork belly and was sickened by the fat. Had the pork been seared a little longer and the fat was more of a crisp, I think it would have been more edible. \n\nThe Alaskan King Crab was a little overcooked for my taste. The meat wasn't smooth and soft, which is what I usually expect from crab meat. But this dish was served on a large skillet so I assume the crab was cooked more from the skillet. In this case, the chef should've undercooked the crab a little so it could be cooked to perfection on the skillet.\n\nThat plate was $105. I'd rather go to a Chinese BBQ place to get roast pork for a fraction of the price and probably steam my own whole crab!\n\nI gave it 3 stars because we did have their Chef's special appetizer, \"Hot Mess\" which comprised of foie gras and orange marmalade. It was delicious. I'm assuming we just ordered the wrong main dish. We should've definitely tried their Boar's Head or something!\n\nNonetheless, I'd probably give this place another shot.

I know, disappointing; but mild disappointment would be the theme of our evening.\n \nThe asparagus (green goddess, fingerling potatoes & radish) was fine but ordinary. The soft shell crab (deep fried), the same. The oysters were excellent, but the accompanying mignonettes were forgettable. The gnocchi (pecorino & black pepper), how could it go wrong? Well it didn't go wrong, it was just...ordinary. Well what about the oeufs mayonnaise (foie gras & crispy chicken skin)? Couldn't taste any of the foie and the skin was too minute to matter.\n \nFor whatever reason I expected everything to be more heavily seasoned. All great restaurant food has to push the salt boundary.\n \nSo what do I mean by ordinary? When you spend as much money (as you will) at the 'trendy' restaurant of a trendy chef, you don't expect to eat food that tastes like something made by a very good home cook.\n \nThat pork belly and lobster? Low flavor, the pork belly could have been tenderer, and the lobster was both overcooked and slightly fishy tasting (i.e. not tasting like lobster).\n \nDid I give this place a fair shake considering that I was directed away from something more 'representative,' like the pig's head? Possibly. But here's the thing, as adventurous as that would appear on the plate, would it *taste* any good? Would the meat be perfect? Would it be seasoned aptly?

Our dinner at his last restaurant Incanto was probably one of our most memorable, and this evening's dinner at the chef's table was on par.\n\nWe started with a half dozen oysters and the pulpo. The octopus was just right, and I swear there was duck fat somewhere. The mignonette with the oysters was very innovative, even though naked oysters are my favorite.\n\nMain course... Could have had everything, but the special did me in, and I had the Hot Mess (aka foie gras and trotters) and Ranjit had the \"Bacon Chop\". For the daily requirement, we shared escarole with anchovies. There is nothing better in my world than a beautifully seared, melt in your mouth, buttery foie gras. But with the trotters and the house jam, Divine! The escarole cut through the buttery fat with the acid from the lemon and the salt of the anchovies. Perfect. Ranjit's chop was moist and probably the best we have had in years.\n\nFor desert, we had the eclair, which had cherries nestled within the chocolate cream filling.

Maybe this is why we don't usually eat the udder, but I'm definitely not inspired to try it again.   \n\nI do have to give kudos for TRYING.  \n\nBut the second, more disturbing issue is the execution -- the milk-braise liquid was very bitter, with a strong flavor of almost-burnt garlic.

Amazing company =] We ordered the famous 100% vegetarian (vegan without the cheese) Impossible Burger (with a side of potatoes) to see what all the hype was about. With regard to presentation, portion, and overall flavor: flawless. It really delivered and really looked and tasted like a burger! The potatoes were decadent and came dressed in a decadent, seasoned aioli. My one gripe is the veggies on the burger + the bun = all soggy. The bun was not at all toasted, which soon turned into a sponge of grease and condiments with every bite. The (butter?) lettuce and pickle chips quickly wilted and lost their crunch under the hot burger patty. Otherwise, the Impossible Burger is quite inventive and flavorful.

Then comes the beef heart tartare,I am not sure if this dish is really raw beef heart but it tastes great! it goes really well with the grilled bread. after that we had the bone marrow, I am not a big fan of it but my friends really enjoyed it. \n\nThen the waiter clear the table and about 20 min wait, comes the roasted pig head, they say it is for 2 to 3 people to share but we had plenty of left overs after we were done with it. I think maybe I was expecting a lot, since this is kind of like their signature dish, but sadly I only took couple bites of the skin and meat then that was it for me, any more I would throw up. I guess it is the greasiness...The skin was not that crispy, and it kinda stick to your teeth, for me I had to scrape off the fat attached to the skin, otherwise I don't think i can eat it. The other part is that you have to dig through all the fat under the skin in order to get to some lean meat and the digging part is kinda of... I don't know, it is just not for me. The dish came with some dipping sauce, it is pig's brain mixed with mayonnaise or they called it brainaise, not a big fan of it. There is also some sauce that dripped off the pig's head when roasting it, the chef mix it with some herbs which you can dip the skin or meat with it, again not a big fan of it. To be honest I wish the chef used the hoisin sauce as one of the dipping sauce, it would take some of the greasiness away... just a suggestion. The pig's ear that came with it was deep fried a bit, therefor very crispy and I like it a lot.\n\nAlmost all the meat dishes come with some good portion of veggies. My wife had the little gem salad and it was pretty good. She also had the quail with mushroom (she was not too fond of the pig's head), and she loved it, I tried it too and I would choose the quail over pig's head. \n\nI think I will be back couple more times just to try other dishes on the menu.

My criticism is more about the style of service then the slightly too salty fare. It did not feel like a restaurant that has been open for three years. We were asked repeatedly about ordering before being able to enjoy our time out as a family or fully decide on our shared meal. We felt rushed and had bussers trying to take food away that we hadn't touched. As well as being asked multiple times within a few minutes if they could clear. The waiter was friendly but no one seemed relaxed. It felt that the push to turn tables was stressed so hard by management that the service style was not creating an experience of being there but one of to how to get you out. At the same time empty glassware lingered on a table that couldn't fit all the food ordered. Having food come as ready also means as it fits on the table which it did not and I had to actually hold plates and bowls to take the food off and serve to then hand it to a busser.

It is with great regret that I cannot continue that trend.  Sometimes restaurants can fool the senses with superficial beauty, and that is what I believe Cockscomb did to me.\n\nI made reservations for a birthday dinner and was promptly seated.  Service was impeccable but a tad impersonal...borderline cold.  We ordered:\n\n1.  duck liver on toast: 2/5.  I can handle liver in small doses (unless fois gras), and while duck liver is a level up in decadence, they piled too much on the toast where it was just not savory.  The bread was delicious, however, the amount of liver just overpowered it.  We had to ask for extra toast to divvy up the liver.  \n\n2.  grilled cheese: 4.5/5  This was the best dish of the night.  A simply grilled cheese with duck egg and honey.  The cheese was very rich...i am not sure the blend.  A duck egg topped it off.  $11 for a grilled cheese is pretty redick in its own, and while this sandwich was good, it wasn't heavenly by any means.  The honey was a nice touch.  \n\n3.  pin bone steak: 3/5  This is what I came here for, and in terms of presentation, it did not disappoint.  The steak was perfectly medium rare and the bone marrow dip and au jus were ono grindz to the extreme.  However, beyond the presentation, the meat was a little too chewy.  Pin bone cuts are the most succulent of the sirloin steaks, however, this dish did not meet that billing.  I left Cockscomb -$110 for this steak as well as a jawache.  \n\nWe got some other dishes like halibut and some desserts.  To me, the dessert did not even qualify as a dessert.  One was an apple covered in a mountain of cheese...ehhhhh.  The second was some blank cake.  \n\nI really wanted to like Cockscomb.  The decor and motif of this place is super legit.  However, the food was lacking to me, especially for that price tag.  When you leave an eatery with a very light pocket and bummed out taste buds, that is pretty much the worse combo.

My friends ordered the zampini (a fennel and pork sausage) which was a generous portion & came with 2 fried oysters, along with a separate side order of roasted sunchokes. My only complaint: the dishes were very oily--the kind where you feel slightly guilty and sick for eating so much rich food afterward, so I recommend eating slowly (or ordering tea).

My companion was compelled to tell me in drastic terms what I obviously refused to acknowledge up to that point.\n\nDisclaimer -- if you into this \"whole animal\" thing, or think that any SOMA joint is worth a visit because it's the chic thing to do, this might be right for you.  If you believe that eating animal organs like liver that is filtering out toxins for years might be problematic, do not come here.  \n\nWhat she was referring to is pasta made from pig skin, in tomato sauce and olives, which led to some initial denial / indifference on my part, mainly because it really looked and tasted like pasta.  It was pure fat, and a cheap one (pig!) at that.\n\nThe signature dish we went there for in the first place, squid and watermelon salad, would have been delicious if they hadn't lit on the spice fire ruining any flavor that squid barely has to begin with.\n\nThe steak (beef, for a change) just came with arugula lettuce, but the disappointing thing for a meat place was that it was very chewy = low-cost supply.  Plus, our red wine (by the glass) was watery.\n\nAll this points to low-cost ingedients (what's the cost of pig skin and liver?) and cutting corners to maximize margins, which on the other side of the equation means we spent $140 for an experiment with fat, skin, and chewy meat.\n\nOne extra point for great service and an excellent table.", "author": "Peter D."}

I had never eaten at Incanto and offal honestly makes me kind of squeamish, so the dishes that we ordered were a little more on the timid side of things.  \n\nFor drinks, I had a negroni which was very good and also an Invasion of the Bodysnatchers.  The Invasion had gin and some sort of fernet type drink with blood orange.  Was good but a little musty tasty at first.\n\nFor food we ordered:\n\nThe Bruschetta which had a bunch of stuff on it.  There was crab, uni butter, some type of fatty lardon type of stuff, some greens and radishes served on top of Tartine bread.  Was really good, but if you didn't get a chunk of radish with every bite, it was a bit rich.\n\nThe hot mess which was foie gras, pig trotters, dates, some other stuff (who knows) on top of some bread thing.  Some bites were a bit too rich for me, but overall, I appreciated the creativity that went into the dish and it didn't taste like anything i had had before.\n\n\"& chips\" is basically a dish that consists of some meat with these delicious potato wedge-ish type things.  The potatoes tasted like they were fried in some sort of animal fat.  beef maybe?  I don't know, but they were NOT vegetarian and they were GOOD!  The sausage was served in a coil, and i forget the name of it, but it was made with pork and was really really tasty.  It reminded me of when i make breakfast for dinner at home, but so much better.\n\nservice:  this is where they still have some kinks to work out.  Our drinks took a very long time to come out and it took our server a long time to take our order for food.  Normally I don't mind, but I was really hungry!  I think this will improve over time, so I am not going to really fret about it, since the service was nice and hospitable.  \n\nI enjoyed sitting at the bar near the kitchen.  It was highly entertaining to watch them cook.....it was really intense.  I also happened to be sitting right where the dishes came out, so I got to see everything on the menu.

I had a couple of friends that had come here beforehand and tried the pig's head and said it was too big, but an experience to have. Therefore, I wanted to try this place with someone who loves food as much as me. \n\nObviously we were going to try the grilled cheese (#57 on the 7x7).  I told my date to choose the other items so he decided on the beef heart tartare and then we were going to go big and try the pig's head. It was a lot of food as expected, but it was all delicious. \n\nGrilled cheese:  grilled cheese with an egg on top. I know it's popular just to put an egg on top of things, but the egg makes it interesting. Not to say the grilled cheese was the best thing I've ever had, but it was a damn good grilled cheese and the egg was perfectly oozy. \nBeef Heart Tartare: Honestly, if no one told me that it was beef heart, I wouldn't have known. The texture was just slightly more chewy than regular beef tartare, and it was interesting.  I will admit I saw it on Top Chef Masters as a part of his final episode he had some beef heart tartare.\nPig Head: Wow this thing was impressive. It comes with two sauces - one that was like an aioli made from the brain apparently and the other was a chimichurri sauce.  The meat was tender and really delicious, but I will admit there was a lot of fat. The skin was nice and crispy as well.   The snout was an interesting feature, and I even tried a bit of the eye. All and all, interesting experience. Definitely worth it. I would definitely suggest having more people before you order this, but it's great!\n\nOverall, we had a great time.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2016-07-23", "description": "Crowing about Cockscomb!\nThe place: is small and rustic - the kind of slightly weird floor plan that you see in old San Francisco buildings. It feels comfortable and not at all designed. It's off an alley and the whole set up makes you feel like you're going somewhere 'insider.' The chef works in the open and is right there - which adds to the feeling of being someone special going somewhere cool and a little undergroundy.\nThe service: is the tops. Our server steered us away from a meal choice that wasn't going to be as good as what we had. She risked making her opinion known and we were smart enough to take her advice. She knew her menu like she was born with it. She made excellent recommendations on cocktails and wine too. And it wasn't just her, but the rest of the team who were helpful and super professional. All of these people could work at Quince or wherever they wanted - they are that good. \nThe food: Oh good God. You have to like meat. What Cosentino can do to protein and fat will make you think you will never want a piece of bread again (though the bread they serve is delicious too). We had the porchetta and it was the best porchetta I have ever had in my whole life. I'm pretty sure I am eligible for a heart attack today but if it happens, I will die happy with my last meal. And it came with some lightly grilled romain, unbelievable tomatoes, and we got the cauliflower (in duck fat I think) and all were equally heavenly. So, a little sweetness from the tomatoes, somehow a little sweetness from the porchetta (I don't know enough about cooking to know why this is) and that balanced the salt and richness of the rest of the dish perfectly. Seriously. Perfectly. I am so happy I got to eat this. You should probably eat this too.\nCocktails: Everyone has already remarked on this but know it's all true. I'm a gin drinker and this is a gin bar. Our server knew about gin (actually knew stuff) and I got some crazy blue gin that was incredible. Drink cocktails here. The wines are nice too - and you can rely on the server to choose well for you.\nThis is probably the most decadent and calorie rich food I have had in any restaurant. Walk there. Walk home. Work out all week before you come and eat here. Cockscomb will make all your worries disappear in a meal of over-the-top self indulgence that can put your life into proper gracious perspective! Let Cockscomb make you an even happier person too through outrageous, meaty food, inspired cocktails and the best service.", "author": "Margaret G."}

We tried a bunch of stuff but the highlight of the night for me was the Grilled Cheese that everyone's been raving about, the Hot Mess which is my number 1 favorite and the Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head. Talk about melt in your mouth meat! The duck fat cauliflower is also really good as well as the gnocchi. I'm definitely coming back here to try their other menu items. Oh!

Wasn't thrilled at first but that changed quickly after experiencing the sights and smells of being so close to the action. We were able to get descriptions of all the dishes coming out before we ordered and suggestions from the chefs. Plus, with the interaction with the Chef, it was like being personally served by Chris Consentino for a private meal. \n\nWe wound up ordering the mussels and chips and the sweetbreads to start. Mussels were OK. Not sure if I would order them again. Sweetbreads were really good though and tasted nice with the peach slices. \n\nEntrees were the bacon chop and the Zampini. Bacon chop was delicious. Zampini was undercooked though. This wasn't an issue since the chef next to me immediately ordered another one to be fired and gave us some ham (prosciutto?) and melon to enjoy while I waited for my replacement. When I did receive the Zampini, it was tasty. \n\nOverall, food was enjoyable and service was excellent. Bonus getting to be in the middle of the action watching the staff taking care of the guests.

Had a short wait until taken to our table on the 2nd floor dining area, which is invisible from the main room.  \nGreeted immediately by our gregarious and gracious server.  Explained specials eloquently.   We ordered 2 of them, pig skin spaghetti and steak tar tar bruschetta, as well has Medium oysters/clams/crab platter for $48.  Pig skin was cut into long thin strands and sauteed in tomato and some greens.  It was ok.   \nBruschetta took a long time to get to our table over 20 min.   It was tasty but there was so much topping it was impossible to cut into pieces that you could pick up with your fingers.  It was a knife and fork dish. \nOysters were delicious, clams tasted good, but the raw bar chef, either needs a new knife or needs to be trained on how to open clams b/c they all were a mangled mess. \n\nEntrees:  Roasted Pig Head - $69, Sausage $18 and Steak coulotte $32\nPigs head tasty, but mostly bone and fat, not surprising, but probably not worth that kind of money unless you love pig fat. Sausage was tasty, Steak was delicious. \n\nHad Chocolate cake for dessert, classic super dense, yummy.\n\nService was great, except for after we finished our crab/oysters/clams our hands were dirty, sticky mess - and no hot towels came or were offered, so I had to go downstairs and wait in line for restroom for 10 minutes.", "author": "Jay K."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2015-07-16", "description": "Warning: This review has been rated PG-13 for sexual language.\n\nIt's risky going to a restaurant with a celebrity chef. Is the celebrity chef a figurehead who never sets foot in a kitchen and is an absent owner? Or is the chef actively running the kitchen and we truly experience what they are about? No such worries at Cockscomb as chef Chris Cosentino was working hard on both sides of the pass to produce satisfying and comforting food.\n\nIt's hard enough to get people to eat raw beef. It's harder to get people to eat raw cow heart. Definitely need to attract daring diners to order the beef heart tartare. But those who take risks get the rewards. As my favorite dish of the night, the tartare mixture nicely balanced the \"pow\" of the heart with enough acidic \"zing\". The \"duck liver croquet en bouche\" starter had incredibly flavorful duck liver piped into a baked puff. I would have loved the dish except it had entirely too much sweet strawberry jam that buried the superb liver.\n\nThe entr\u00e9es were slightly homey. The tetrazzini included an entire roasted Cornish game hen topped with mushrooms, crunchy fried fideos, and cream sauce. Typically, scant and dry, this hen was meaty and tender. It surprisingly didn't loose its crisp skin in the sauce. For my entr\u00e9e, I ordered a \"zampini\" without knowing what it was. (I later did a web search. Google directed me to a Brazilian actress and Wikipedia to an Indian village. This means I should have eaten a sexy starlet or an entire Asian village like Godzilla.) What I actually ate was a grilled sausage with plenty of corn on the side. Topped with two gutty fried oysters, the ingredients never felt cohesive and the dish was oily.\n\nWe didn't have dessert because I was full from cleaning our plates. I don't like to waste food. Speaking of waste, we saw a couple of orders of \"pin steak\" which was served on a board that barely fit the table. I don't know how many pounds it was, but it's a roast that would probably serve six people. Unfortunately, I saw two boards go back to the kitchen only half finished. I sure hope the restaurant has a good plan for sizable amounts of uneaten meat otherwise that was a shameful waste, but they should consider serving a smaller portion.\n\nThe red wines by the glass were curiously South American, but appropriate given the amount of heavy red meats.\n\nThe menu had a \"Butcher's Choice\" of \"Daily Fall Offs\". Considering they have beef heart, I was expecting some crazy and fun parts like lamb brain, pig pancreas, boar dong, or anything with the word \"knuckle\" in it. Basically, something that would rival the banquet in \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\". Sadly, the leftover cuts were the premium foie gras. Furthermore, if someone from PETA heard that the force feeding of fowl yielded what is considered a fall off, it would likely anger them even more.\n\nThere was a 4% pretax surcharge for \"San Francisco employer mandate\", although I'm not sure why some places charge this while others do not. Parking in this seemingly industrial area was oddly high at $7 per hour due do \"event parking rates\" when no major event was in sight.\n\nThe name of the restaurant is a little personal. How someone combs their privates is not my concern (hence the term \"privates\"). But since it's San Francisco with hairy hippies, they probably carry a cockscomb unlike most of us from Los Angeles with a pornstar shave.", "author": "Brian U."}

All of us had worked out previously, so saying we were starving hungry is an understatement. I'm sure we ordered enough for 8-10 regular people haha. I can't recall everything we ordered, and the menu does change a bit, but the pig head and pin bone steak were fantastic entrees to cap off the meal. The brain-o-naise or whatever they call the sauce for the steak was pure indulgence, like pouring liquid fat over the tender, perfectly cooked beef. I also learned an interesting thing, which is that a pig's head is comprised of many huge chunks of fat. I consider myself adventurous, so I tried my best to eat said fat, but after a few mouthfuls of what's essentially pig butter, I had to give up. My mouth was completely coated with pig fat, so much so that we had to order extra whiskey to help rinse it out. Mind, I'm not complaining, just letting people know in case they think it's just skin and meat - you get TONS of fat in the pig head.\n\nThe second time I went here was for my company's holiday party, for maybe 12-15 people. We spent, no joke, something like $2k hahaha. Getting to expense that was great, I love free miles.\n\nFrom the beginning cocktails we had while waiting for the table to be set up, to the appetizers and shots and wine, to the huge array of meats and veggies, and to the final massive desserts, Cockscomb hooked it up amazing. I was beyond full, in the best way possible.\n\nSo overall, this place rocks, it's not cheap, but if you are feeling spendy and want some amazing meat and seafood, it might be SF's #1 spot. The interior is also very cool and unique, and their drink menu is extensive.", "author": "Sm L."}

The restaurant is located in SoMa and as we walked in I immediately loved the place, the ambience, which to me felt like rusty industrial meets modern chill. We sat on the top floor by the windows and before we got started, thoroghly enjoyed watching dishes getting served to the large/long table next to us, one of them being a huge slab of medium rare steak which looked amazing. We each looked through the menu and ended up ordering the following: Beef Heart Tartare, Raw Halibut with Jalapeno Peppers, \"Hot Mess\" Seared Foie Gras, and the Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head. Delicious!\n\nI'm just going to dive into ranking and reviewing the dishes: 1. Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head: this dish was HUGE, and both me and Lorrie loved it. The pig's head was so crispy on the outside, especially the ears, and soooo tender on the inside. Probably the most tender pork I have tasted in a long time. 2. \"Hot Mess\" Seared Foie gras: you can never go wrong with Foie gras - it was delish as usual. Not sure about the beef patty/cake on the bottom though. 3. Raw Halibut with Jalapeno Peppers: it was sooo tasty and refreshing! There is something about raw fish and olive oil, lemon/lime juice, and peppers. 4. Beef Heart Tartare: it was good but not amazing, and it really was nothing special. \n\nOverall, it was a great dining experience and delicious food. Although the dishes were a lot for 2 people.

I took my boyfriend here for his birthday so it was a No-Holes-Barred experience.  Cocktails to start, appetizers, a bottle of wine and a ton of offaly good food.  (See what I did there?)\n\nI'm going to get right into it.  After finding the front door (which is actually the side door, but who cares), we walked into a modern rustic space which was bustling and very lively for an early (6pm) Wednesday evening.  (I later found out they have one of the BEST happy hours in the city!)  After checking in, we were graciously escorted to our table on the second level which was quieter and more conducive to putting your face down and \"pigging out\".  (Meh meh meh ... You'll understand why I think that's funny in a minute ... )\n\nUnfortunately, I can't remember what cocktails we had (It was a good night - what can I say?), but for an appetizer we ordered the Beef Heart Tartar with a raw egg.  I may have been a teeny bit apprehensive about the flavor before I tried it, but once I did, all fear and dignity flew out the window.  I scarfed down about half a cow's heart with some unfertilized chicken ova like nobody ever did before.  A bit gamy in the sense that it had a slightly metallic flavor, not quite as pungent as liver ... along those lines.  But I like liver too.  \n\nOnto the mains.  It hurts a little bit to think about how much we ate and how rich it was but you'll get zero complaints from this gal because tasty, rich and filling was what we were going for.  And it was all very tasty.\n\nWe ordered the Chef's plate de jour, which was Foie Gras, Pig Trotters and Pickled Green Strawberries served with crostini.  Yes.  Everything you could wish for and more.  Foie Gras.  That is all.  No wait - that's not all because it was cooked to perfection and had the perfect Melt-In-Your-Mouth consistency.  The pig trotters reminded me of pulled pork but bathing in Foie Gras glory and then complimented by the tartness of the pickled green strawberries.  What?\n\nNow onto the real main dish.  We ordered the Half a Roasted Pig's Head.  It's a shared supper - I would say for more than 2 people ... Possibly, OH about 6 to 8?  Yeah, I know.  What were we thinking?  It was huge.  I was obviously in denial about how big pigs can be.  This was NOT your everyday teacup variety.  But delicious!  It was like a huge platter of pork belly ... with a snout, teeth and a crispy fried ear.  Yum!  I think there was some salad on the platter ... But we didn't dabble in the frivolous items.  We took a LOT home and my wee maltese doggy had pig face for  d a y s.  (Don't judge me - She's 11yo and has earned it).  Btw, she's still VERY happy and has a clean bill of health.  No animals were harmed in the making of this review.\n\nWe had dessert too.  Something chocolate that we couldn't finish.  It was his birthday - I had to order cake!  Ugh.  I'm full thinking about it.  We stumbled out of there, said a quick hello and thank you to the Chef Extraordinaire and drove home as fast as we could so we could lay ourselves out to nurse our bulging bellies.\n\nAnd that's about it.  We will go back for sure.  Probably with at least 4 more people so we can try the shared steak, the bacon chop and definitely everything else on the menu.  Thank you.  That is all.", "author": "Cindy H."}

Originally I made a reservation for 9 via yelp, but we had two unexpected guests show up and the staff quickly brought out more seats to accommodate them. Since I've read about the pin steak and pig's head, those were going to be my go to. However they were out of the pig's head, so the server suggested I get the pork tenderloin special. She even suggested I order two of them to sufficiently feed everyone. Boy am I glad I listened to her, that dish was everyone's favorite! She also helped by communicating my intentions of doing everything family style, but turns out one of the unexpected guests at the other end of the table was a vegetarian and she took his additional order of salad. I loved that our server, Jasmine, didn't try to upswell the more expensive pin steak and was honest about how delicious the pork tenderloin was. Not only was she spot on with the dish suggestions and awareness of the entire party, she was honorable with gratuity. I didn't check of gratuity was included so left additional gratuity on accident, to which she kindly thanked me for but did not take since it was included. I'd definitely recommend this place for both large parties or a hip dinner date. I didn't even go into details about the drinks, but I hate writing reviews.

I've been wanting to eat at a place with really great and fresh ingredients, and kept looking for a farm to table type feel. I made reservations to Cockscomb because of the great reviews, availability for a reservation, and also the fact it's owned by Chris Cosentino (rockstar chef). And it definitely did not disappoint. \n\nWhat we ordered:\n- Shaved vegetables - I wanted something fresh and earthy, and that's exactly what I got. Shaved radishes, daikon, carrots, arugula etc. in a light vinaigrette. So delicious and light.\n- Tombo ceviche - I loved the flavor in this dish. I reminded me a lot of a Thai dish with the very strong lime flavor with the Thai red pepper. Very delicious and fresh.\n- Roasted milk fed chicken - The bf ordered this, and it was the \"best chicken he's ever had\". It was so juicy and flavorful. It also came with a side of asparagus, which complimented the chicken well.\n- Coulette steak - loved my steak. Coming from Texas, it's hard for me to find good steak. It was very well cooked (medium-rare), and tender I could use my fork to cut it! I also really loved the vegetables it came with (radishes, pearl onions, etc.)\n- Duck fat cauliflower - We were being pigs and our waitress had to tell us \"this should be enough\". But this was a great addition, and we were happy we made it! Very tender and flavorful. \n\nOverall, a really great meal. I think the other thing that impressed me about this place is that nothing was overly salted. I was almost expecting everything to be super salty, but everything was well seasoned and tasty.

The wines by the glass list was a bit light but 5 reds is probably adequate. The malbec was pretty weak though, the Turnbull acceptable, and although the Sanford Central Coast/Santa Rita Pinot Noir was very good - I would like to see it served in the proper pinot noir glass (this is SF after all - and an important personal crusade for me). \n\nThen, there is the (half?)

To cut a long story extremely short, we made the decision to leave at 9:35pm after still not being seated. There was no approach or apology, the hostess would simply blame the patrons that were at the table that we were meant to occupy for taking too long. Hello? Not our fault, not their fault. 100% attributed to poor planning on the restaurant staff.\n\nIt's a shame the bar was able to squeeze $250 out of us whilst waiting for our table that we never got. It's a shame the GM couldn't proactively come over and address us. It's a shame the GM was utterly useless (tip for HR, please performance manage him, when we asked what he could do for our inconvenience, he offered free dessert - ha! We don't have a table yet and your solution is free dessert??).\n\nAlso, a family member that couldn't make the birthday dinner had requested a bottle of champagne be sent to our table. At 9:15pm they brought it over to us in the bar area AS IF IT WAS A KIND GESTURE TO APOLOGIZE!!!! So now I have to call and make sure she gets that charge reversed on her credit card seeing as she was not provided with what she had bought - a bottle of champagne to accompany her brothers birthday dinner.\n\nI know San Franciscans are very particular about making sure they go to the right places and will tolerate this BS, but if I have dinner reservation at 8:45pm and you haven't managed to seat me in 15 minutes, there are already issues.

A definite must try!\n\nMy boyfriend made reservations for our 4 year anniversary and I immediately looked it up on yelp.  With a soft opening in December it already had LOTS of great reviews given it was only January.  We arrived early, and the hostess invited us to wait upstairs in the bar/lounge while our table opened up.  The restaurant itself looked housed in an industrial building but its walls had a lot of unique art, and an open kitchen, which I love! I love seeing the chefs cook food. Dim lighting, and had a hipster-ish vibe, but still romantic :)\n\nCocktails: While we waited for our table, my bf had the Bullitt and I had the Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  Now, I'm not a fancy shmancy cocktail expert but the Bulllitt tasted much like whiskey on ice (it was bender's rye, cynar and grapefruit bitters) but Invasion of the Body Snatchers was right up my alley!  YUM! The menu read that it contained genevieve genever, averna, blood orange and maple sugar.  Not overly sweet and was just delicious.\n\nAppetizers: Before we ordered our appetizers, the bf wanted to get a beer. I loved that our waiter gave him a sample to try, despite the restaurant being so busy! \n-Bruschetta:  Our research revealed that they offered Uni Bruschetta.. unfortunately our waiter explained that the Uni that they typically ship from Japan was no longer fresh so instead they made it into a uni butter. They offered two types of bruchetta but after he described the uni butter/dungeness crab bruschetta, I didnt hear anything else that came out of his mouth lol!  This appetizer was generous and so, so YUM.\n- Beef Heart Tartare: Came with quails egg on top, with a lightly dressed salad, and some potato crunchies (i think the menu called these fries, but these were so, so much better than fries).  I loved the salad and potato crunchies, but i'm sure wouldnt have tasted as good without the beef heart tartare.\n- Bone Marrow: the bone marrow was mixed with bay smoked fried oysters and topped with watercress.  I love when chefs \"dress up\" the bone marrow - it gives it so much more flavor and dimension!\n\nOK at this point we were getting full. But the star of the dinner was yet to come...\nShared Plate: Wood Oven Roasted Pigs Head: oh lawd.  This is not meant to be shared between two people, who just had three appetizers. It was served with sheeps brain aoili, and a verde sauce made with the pig's drippings.  The head itself was crispy on the outside and gelatinous on the inside.  We threw in the towel after two or three bites.  It was just too much, and we were too full!  I think the overabundance of fat just had us retreating in a corner, waving a white flag....\n\nThe service was impeccable and I truly look forward to coming again!", "author": "Rosanna B."}

After trying Incanto I was under whelmed, but I figured maybe we just got a bad night, so I was willing to give him another shot when he opened Cockscomb in Incanto's wake. Again, I came away feeling his \"odd animal parts\" cooking is just a gimmick. sure there is beef heart tartar, pigs head and butcher \"fall offs\" (read kitchen trimmings that they're selling at a premium) to be had, but maybe while a bit eccentric, it's just nothing to treat your taste buds to. The pigs head seemed under seasoned, the meat pie was chunks of fatty meat with one oyster, a marginal crust and weak sauce and the duck fat cauliflower was limp. The liver terrine was very good...but I find it hard to F up foie gras. \n \nAll in all to me the food all just seemed to be missing fine tune seasoning details. Oh, speaking of one huge detail over looked in this restaurant...sound level! On a 1 to 10 scale, the top floor dinning room is like a Pantera concert. It's just a damn shame so many restaurants over look noise level. We had 2 six tops right behind us and tables on either side close enough to eat off their plates...all evening we were treated to the pros and cons of the iWatch and stories of the difference between Tinder hook ups in SF vs. San Jose, from the bros next to us.

Ok ok, so yes, I may have a little chef-crush on Chris Cosentino from Top Chef Masters, but even without the fan photo I took with him, I'd give 4.5-5 stars. \n\nThe only downside is that I think you miss out if you go with a small group. I mourn the fact that I can't just go in by myself and order a bacon chop. But then on second thought, maybe I can. \n\nI went with a group of 3 -- not idea, but we made it work. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share family style: \n\nStarted out with the crudo special. This changes frequently, but the dish we had was excellent. We got the cauliflower side dish, which was a bit oily but flavorful. For main dishes, we had the bacon chop and the meat pie. I loved both. The meat pie was a cross between a beef bourguinon and chichken pot pie. Think, substitute the chicken pot pie inside with beef bourguinon. Why didn't I think of that? The pie crust was flakey and substantial, added the sweet touch to the hearty stew inside. The bacon chop was huge, and the rhubarbs that came on the side were also delightful. \n\nFor dessert, we had the strawberry shortcake and chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was our only disappointment -- too dense / dry, not very good flavor. Hazelnuts were overpowering and the cake was almost too bready. The strawberry shortcake on the other hand blew me away. The light whipped cream wasn't too sweet and complemented the tart / sweet strawberries so well. The cake / shortbread was moist and soft. Yum yum. \n\nThe staff were friendly and knowledgeable. Attentive throughout the service and when one of them saw me sparking at the sight of Chris Cosentino, he arranged a special photo session for us. \n\nI'm a huge fan and will be back to try the pinbone steak and the pig head!", "author": "Michelle K."}

We finished off with the chocolate dessert. \n\nThe pate wasn't entirely what I was expecting, but it was absolutely delicious. The consistency was more like a soft salami than a typical liver pate, but the flavor was tremendous. The \"ham\"burger was fantastic. At first bite, I wasn't sure about the consistency. But on second and all the other bites, I felt that the blend of salt, creamy and a little sweet with just a hint of green was exquisite and highly craveable. I guarantee that I will be thinking of that burger in coming weeks. My partner's steak was tender, juicy and cooked perfectly. \n\nThe one thing that could have been done better was the acorn squash which had a lovely blend of pumpkin seeds and green herbs, but was otherwise bland and not cooked long enough to be soft. I like a little sweet with squash as well and was expecting just a hint of that. Alas, it did not come through.\n\nWe capped off the meal with a chocolate dessert that was perfectly decadent and great to split... Not too big for one person, but very rich. Overall a splendid meal.

I was a little ambivalent because I don't consider myself the most adventurous eater, but I was wowed by almost everything we ordered (granted we didn't go too adventurous). Here's what we got:\n- Half dozen fresh oysters - Fresh and yum! I'm not even that big of an oyster fan\n- Butcher's special which was a foie gras torchon - This was delightful. We asked if they sold this in jars, but unfortunately they don't. Few places have as good foie gras as we had here. We even saved some to spread on the grilled cheese later, which was heavenly.\n- Grilled cheese with poached egg and honey - SO GOOD. I am requesting my hubby to make this for me sometime. Why have we never thought of this. Honey on anything is pretty delicious.\n- Bacon chop - My god this was massive. I can't believe it's supposed to be a serving for 1. My husband and I shared this and we barely made it through a 3rd. My only complaint with the bacon chop was that it was a bit too fatty, and this coming from someone who likes her meat fatty.\n- Classic dessert: banana cream pie - Definitely respectable, although not as good as the best banana cream pie I've ever had, which was at Monkeypod in Maui.

But last night we celebrated two birthdays of good friends of ours. We had a reservation for 10 and when we arrived the host announced that our table was ready, even before everyone was present. Most places will tell you that they won't seat you before your full party is there. The service here is top notch. In fact, some of the best I've had the pleasure of experiencing. Everyone from the bartender, to the host, to our waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, patient, and helpful.\n\nAs for the food, I had the \"hamburger\" with fried potatoes which was quite good and filling. Several others shared the pin-bone steak which was plentiful between 3-4 people. The pictures really don't do the food justice. I thought I was going to leave the place hungry, so while you may be paying some hefty change for the food you will definitely be full by the end of the night.\n\nMy only complaint was that the table they seated us in was quite small, to the point all of us were sitting shoulder to shoulder.

Keeping Chris Consentino's philosophy in mind to use the whole animal, I was so excited to try this place. We chose family style that we we could try everything. The restaurant is actually much bigger inside than what it looks like outside. We were seated in a cozy corner on the top floor. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and made us great recommendations.We ordered the following:\n\n -uni bruschetta - one of my favorite dishes. i really liked the contrasting textures and balance of flavors.\n -a raw fish plate (I forgot what it was exactly) - it had hearts of palm, tomatoes, bell peppers and mahi mahi. I really enjoyed this light dish to start with\ndates - another favorite dish of the night! I think the dates were pan seared and glazed with some sauce and topped with little fish. great balance of flavors (salty/sweet)\n-grilled cheese - also another one of my favorites. there was honey on the grilled cheese and it was topped with a sunny side egg!\n-bacon chop - this was huge! I'm glad we had 5 people to share the dish. Sadly, this dish was just okay. I found myself liking the vegetables and rhubarb on the dish more. The fatty portions are really fatty so you need to be sure to get a balanced portion of fat and meat in your bite.\n-steak - this was also just okay. And again i liked the peas and carrots on the plate much better\n-sausage dish - this was also just okay. I was hoping the sausage had more snap to it.\nduck fat cauliflower w/ jalapeno - favorite side dish of the night. we loved it so much we got 2 orders\n-asparagus - it was good and i liked the bits or lemon on top\n-carrots were outstanding. the Ethiopian spice was delicious and I liked the yogurt it came with.\n\nSince we came earlier the ambiance was great.

Out of those dishes my favorites were probably the grilled cheese and cauliflower. Except compared to others I have, it just wasn't as great as it could have been. I get that everything is cooked in their wood-fired oven, but it still fell a bit short. The tartare has an unpleasant gaminess to it and the beets were paired with a cheese that had the texture of a pink eraser and make an awkward sound when rubbed against your teeth.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad we came to try it.

Please understand, I really wanted to love this place, but I'm left genuinely cheated. I read the reviews and researched the photos setting up our 5-year anniversary dinner with much anticipation. Did I miss the bandwagon (and I'm all for reppin' this city)? I'm just utterly disappointed.\n\nThe grilled cheese. For $20, this was not the best I've had in my life. I love smelly, good cheese. What I don't like, smelly, bad cheese. I've never been so offended. Mind you, we're a Filipino and Thai household. We love, bagoong, patis, and deep fried fish head, but this sandwich was rough. I saw the truffle shavings, but its essence was no where to be found. Honey was lacking and was not enough to balance out the audacity of the cheese.\n\n3 pieces of Uni on a plate of salad. Need I say more?\n\nEggs, eggs, eggs -- exactly what it sounds like. The house, and by that I mean my house can produce better yolky porn than all the rave going on here. Its like they tossed a soft boiled chicken, duck, and qual egg with some salmon roe, a pinch of greens and drizzled an aoli-based sauce. Call it a day.\n\nOne of the more redeeming dishes was the pig-skin linguine with clams. The richness of the pig skin (and think more gelatinous than crispy skin) played well with the oceany clams. A solid duet.\n\nLastly, we ordered the bacon chop, moist and flavorful. It comes with a salad. A solid dish for my paleo only friends. However, it was too fatty I had to spit out a mouthful of it because I couldn't chew it enough into pieces to save me from possible aspiration.\n\nAn awesome segue: I spit it out the piece onto my napkin and left it aside on the table. The waitress grabbed my napkin too quickly before I could finish my \"I'm sorry...\" sentence and folded it neatly all the while my chunk of fatty chop flung out onto the dinning room floor. No one noticed or was insulted so I kept my mouth shut. Their service was great. Our waters were refilled halfway before bottoms up could make an appearance and requests for more cocktails were asked before delirium tremens could kick in. Excellent customer service!\n\nDrinks. We ordered something with egg whites and fizz, the pisco punch, boothby (upon first sip, I thought I hadn't rinse my mouth well enough after a toothbrushing session. On the second sip I realized it was the cocktail), and invasion of the body snatchers. The body snatchers was my fave of the four.

Here they were superb, which is just one example of the attention to detail at the restaurant.  \n\nGiven that it just opened, what is even more surprising is that the service was excellent.  Not always easy to serve 9 people at a large table, but it was not a problem for the excellent staff.\n\nDef recommend this place for the food, service and fun vibe.  Dont miss it.", "author": "Alexander L."}

What drew are attention the most was the pin bone steak. The reviews say that it's for 4 or more and believe it. My wife and I barely ate half. The outside of the steak seasoned well with salt and pepper. It was garnished with some parsley with a side of bone marrow and au jus. If you aren't a medium rare/ rare person you might want to tell the waiter/waitress. We also tried the beef heart tartar. Once you get past the idea of eating a heart you'll enjoy every bit of it.  We had a few drinks and they taste pretty clean. When I say clean I mean fresh quality ingredients. We had the Fresca Kid with I liked the most. I'm not a fruity drink kind of guy so this was right up my alley.  My wife had the Funny People and it was more on the fruity drink category, but it taste good. The restaurant had a rustic look to it. The tables were made of what looked like reclaimed wood. The light was a warm lighting and the walls had slender mirrors where if you were facing the wall you can still see the restaurant behind you. I was angled in a way I can see the flames in the kitchen. I would imagine that it's the flames used to char the meat on the pin bone steak. The over all experience was great. I would like to come back to have the bacon chop. I'm glad we didn't order it this time around, because we would of been stuck with pounds of meat.", "author": "marco m."}

It's your typical pate, foie gras, bone marrow, etc  type of joint, but I very much enjoyed my time here.\nThe foie gras was actually good here.  I wasn't excited about having foie gras back.  Everyone is just hopping into it.  I feel that a lot of restaurants have foie gras on their menu just to have it but can't execute them.  I really enjoyed it here at Cockscomb.\n\nMARROW was good.\nDUCK TERRINE was also very good.  Can't go wrong right?\nBEEF HEART TARTARE  was extremely salty.  Didn't enjoy that one at all.\nGRILLED CHEESE yessssssssssssss .. honey and truffle.  This one was actually quite memorable.\nMEAT PIE was good.  Everyone loved the crust.  The broth was delicious.\nSAUSAGE AND CHIPS i absolutely love the chips (potatoes)\n\nWe had a bunch of other stuff, I can't remember them all.  \nbut one dish I was looking forward to was PIG EARS, which they didn't have on the menu tonight :(\n\nMy boyfriend brought to my attention that many restaurants like this one are popping up everywhere with similar menus.

Highly recommend reservations as it was packed during the soft opening (especially for large groups as there's limited space).\n\nI loved Incanto and was excited to see Chef Cosentino open a new restaurant. Heard they were finally open and immediately booked a reservation. Similar atmosphere as Incanto but more livelier. Absolutely love the open kitchen and how there's bar seating if you wanted to chat with the chefs as they prepare the meals.

At Incanto you weren't charged for additional bread, but here you only get 2 pcs and get charged  $1 for 2 additional pcs. The same applied to the bone marrow. I ordered the quail and loved how juicy and tender the meat was. I also loved the variety of mushrooms included in the dish as I'm a huge mushroom lover. My BF had the & Chips which he thought was decent. It was a long and narrow pork sausage with a skin casing that had a great snap to it. The fried potatoes came in large wedges with just enough salt sprinkled on top. Don't ask for ketchup though because they don't carry it (my BF's a huge ketchup fan so he was disappointed about that). I tried my friend's Calf's Liver and it surprisingly didn't have that strong of an iron taste that most livers have and was tender. Very glad I tried it. My other friends said they enjoyed their dishes as well, especially the Bavette Steak as it was perfectly cooked.\n\nService was fantastic. Watchful eyes constantly had our waters filled and napkins folded when we walked away. Empty plates quickly cleared away. One of our friends had all his drinks and dishes picked by our waiter and he enjoyed his choices. Definitely an interesting experience for him.\n\nChef Cosentino was there prepping many of the meals that night and showing the other chefs what to do. It was thrilling to watch him work! Our server found out that I was a fan of Chef Cosentino and checked to see if he would be willing to take a picture. He was busy but our server wouldn't let me leave until I got a picture (he actually blocked the door!). I'm super shy so one of my friends was able to get Chef Cosentino's attention to get a picture. Awesome that he's willing to step away and take some time with the clientele.\n\nAmazing experience and food. Highly recommend!", "author": "Kitty K."}

I was lucky enough to score seats at the chefs counter, and it was definitely a great experience. There is a wood fired kitchen which my date and I was seated in front of, overall I enjoyed it but for some others (like my date) was a little too HOT for him. He asked how I can stand the heat and I told him that although my makeup might be melting, I felt like I was right in the action. (Fan girl moment) NOT TO MENTION CHRIS WAS PREPPING DISHES RIGHT NEXT TO ME!!! EEEEEK!!!  All the chefs are amazing, not to mention extremely busy and under pressure, and Chef Cosentino made sure that all dishes were warm and up to par before going out to diners. \n\nThe cocktails were equally as delicious as the food. Must try the CLASSIC GIN AND TONIC, the countless amount of smells this cocktail came with just blew my mind away.\nThe BACON CHOP is also a delicious, huge piece of pork any meat lover would enjoy. Not too salty, juicy and tender, cooked to perfection. \nI decided to go for something different and ordered the PIG SKIN SPAGHETTI from Butcher's Choice in the Offal and Butchers Cut section of the menu. Very different and out of this world and I am glad I got to experience that. \nHad a few appetizers and side dishes, the DUCK LIVER TERRINE was absurdly good and paired very well with my wine. It came with some sort of jam (pickled fruit) and grilled bread. The UNI BRUSCHETTA was enjoyable with a bunch of different flavors and textures going on with the creamy uni and decadent silky lardo.\nThe only thing that I could've done without is probably the MARKET VEGETABLES. I ordered this since there wasn't much greens involved throughout the meal and upon seeing a good review of it from someone else who dined there, I ordered without hesitation. The vegetables were drenched in oil and nothing about it really stood out to me. (Possibly because this restaurant specializes in Offal?!) - Although it is a DAILY REQUIREMENT, I will be skipping this requirement next time. \n\nMy date enjoyed the duck liver terrine so much that he ordered one to take home to share with his mother and I ended up ordering the GRILLED CHEESE with truffles and honey to take home to share with my sister. It was a hit. They were very generous with the truffles and was still delectable when I brought it home.\n\nI kept seeing orders of the pin bone steak being prepared and although it is too large of a order for a party of two, I will definitely be back to share it with a party of four.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2014-11-29", "description": "We have a contender for best new restaurant of 2014/2015.  Some of the food harkens back to San Franciscan classics, lots of meats, a nice fire pit that is put to good use, lots of things that you will see at other restaurant but damn does Cosentino know that what really matter is flavour!\n\nTL:RL: pricy but totally worth it meatfest with good seafood too. Not the best place for a vegetarian but they would be happy here. Very noisy space that's a bit too hipster/early 90's skater for my personal tastes but in keeping with current trends. \n\nLonger review: We went during the soft opening and normally I wouldn't review it completely as most places are getting the kinks out but Cockscomb was already a smooth well oiled machine that did not disappoint in terms of service or food.\n\nDishes we tried:\n\n1. Eggs, Eggs, Eggs: chicken eggs, duck egg and roe-probably our least favourite dish. Surprisingly it was served cold, the herb dressing was delicious and tied it together into a nice cold egg salad. The eggs sadly were not all soft poached which they were suppose to be but they replaced our harder ones with some softer one.\n\n2. Tombo Crudo: chunks of tombo with a very little coating of chili and acid served with wontons wrappers. very nice quality fish, wish the wontons had been warm.\n\n3. Little Gems with green goddess and crispy pig ear- this was a classic salad with green goddess dressing and tiny crispy bit of pig ears. It was a lovely combo of salty and crunchy and herbaciousness. I would have loved for the pig ear to be freshly cooked.\n\n4 We started the meal with 1/2 dozen  oysters, they had a selection of four including ones from Virginia, Washington and Oregon. The selection was good and they were served with a choice of three sauces, a mustard oil, a traditional mignonette and an avocado cream.\n\n5. Grilled cheese with brioche bread and black truffles. I am not a \"comfort food\" person or someone who loves it when a chef \"elevates\" some thing simple and then charges 20 bucks for it. However this is freaking delicious. Sweet light brioche, pungent cheese, a thin layer of honey and a healthy portion of black truffles on top. I would happily come back just for that even if it was over 10 bucks.\n\n6. I had butcher's choice which was calf's liver and onions. Just like mom made it if mom was able to make a demi-glace and had an open fire to cook it. There were few tough bits but for the most part it was perfect cooked with a velvety texture and the onions and jus were great additions.\n\n7.  We finished with a Mille cr\u00eapes which instead of pastry cream between layers had a been soak in syrup of some kind. It wasn't overly sweet which I appreciated and the French Spouse declared it pretty good for a non-French person.\n\n8. They serve espresso but don't have cream only milk.\n\nService: I made a reservation so I was a bit surprised when I got there to be seated at the chef's bar. I expect to be given a choice of a table when I have a reservation. The hostess said there were no two-tops downstairs and the only one free were upstairs in the back dining room. We choose to stay at the low counter that was directly in front of the grills and enjoyed it there but when we left there were still two two-tops that had been free the entire time we were eating. Other than that the service was extremely good with a very friendly knowledgeable server who was responsive about things that didn't work for us and the rest of the serving staff including busers were on point.\n\nAtmosphere: While the restaurant is listed as being on 4th street, it's on a corner with the entrance is on the side street. The decor is pure hipster even if the chef would hate that term. Taxidermy on all the walls and Edison bulb as well as not a soft surface in sight means this is a loud place and the lighting is poor for reading the menu. It's ok for ASL but could be hard for the hard of hearing. There are two floors but there is an elevator and the bathrooms both unisex are on the ground floor. Most tables are wheelchair accessible as are three seats at the chef's counter.  There is one communal table downstairs. Upstairs there is small lounge area with perhaps the best seats if you like to hold court with a curved dining bar overlooking the lower space, there was also a bar and then a back dining room which looked great for a private event or dinner. The spouse kept telling me what late 90's music we were listening too and it had that feeling of a middle class skatepunk all grown up with the firewood stand made with BMX folks.\n\nWith entrees in the 30's, starters in teens, expect to pay at least 45-55 a person without drinks. They have some amazing shared meats like a whole pigs head that the folks next to us got that looked and smelled amazing and that I will try to find a carnivore friend to share it with in the future.\n\nAll in all Chris Cosentino has a really nice menu and staff happening here and there is no reason why it shouldn't be quite successful.", "author": "DeathandFood H."}

Upon entering the space, we fell in love with the warm and rustic decor balanced with the trip hop and cool chef's counter bar with sparks flying from the stove. As we were seated, a glance at all our fellow diners overflowing tables assured us that we were in for a treat. Now the biggest issue we would have would be not ordering everything on the menu. \n\nAfter much discussion, we settled on the grilled cheese with duck egg and honey, the hot mess (an off menu must try foie Gras gustatory sensation), the duck liver croque en bouche, the bone marrow mixed grill and finally the Roasted Pig's Head. We thought the bread of the grilled cheese was perfectly toasted and the honey added just the right amount of sweet. We could have done without the egg though. The duck liver puffs we thought would have been better warm but it would be challenging to keep the filling cold and exterior warm on a restaurant scale. The hot mess was exactly as advertised and it was served with the bone marrow and we found ourselves mixing and matching grilled bread, marrow, foie gras and the residual jus on the hot mess plate. Nothing prepared me for the pig's head though. I didn't expect to see teeth but yes I could count them on the detached mandible of our porcine companion. The gold flakes and accompanying chicory and sauces complemented the falling off its face oh so tender meat. Needless to say, we didn't quite finish it all.

The foie mousse made it super rich and heavy but the heaviness was cut with the lemony herb sauce underneath. The fried pig ears were delicious with lime and mint and various herbs and spices.

Two of my buddies went to J and W with Cosentino, and both were big fans of Incanto. However, I was not overly impressed with Cockscomb. \n\nThe wife and I had a 9 pm rez for my bday dinner. Hostess and upstairs bartender were very friendly and attentive. We had a couple drinks while we waited. We were seating pretty close to 9 and the place was pretty busy. Cosentino was also there and greeted us and asked how things were. Nice guy. He even cleared an area in the bar when a patron complained of it being wet...anyway, our waiter was also very attentive and friendly. \n\nWe decided to order a few appetizers: Raw oysters (delicious), Duck liver terrine, and Baked oysters. The raw were great with several sauces to try along with the traditional lemon and hot sauce. The baked oysters were a bit on the bland side and not very impressive. A dash more salt and pepper may have saved it. I enjoyed the terrine, but the wife found it a bit too \"mineral\" tasting. Well, it's liver...guess getting her accustomed to Foie may have ruined the liver experience. For dinner we decided to share the Bavette steak. For me, this was the highlight. Well seasoned and cooked to a perfect mid-rare. \n\nOverall, the experience was a decent one. Will I go back?? Maybe not seeing that there's a multitude of other restaurants I'd like to try when I visit the bay area.", "author": "B G."}

We came with a high recommendation from a friend chef, to go to Cockscomb. Day one, we had reservations. The place is small and has an open kitchen full of action. Service is great. The ambiance is fun and modern. We saw that two seats opened at the kitchen counter, so we asked if they could move us. Very graciously and promptly they accommodated our request. We sat right next to Chris Consentino, owner  and Top Chef masters winner. He was very welcoming and keep talking to us throughout dinner making sure we were pleased. My husband had the two-pounds bacon chop, I had the ravette steak dish. Both were wonderful. For dessert we had a orange crepe cake, that was amazing. After that,  we saw how they make their grilled cheese drizzled with honey and topped with white truffle and we ordered it too. Delicious!  This was a very special dinner for us on a very special trip. We highly recommend Cockscomb!!!!!", "author": "Mili H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-08", "description": "TL;DR: Hipster loud-environment date.  Food was very good and unlike any unoriginal \"fancy date\" places.. Service started slow but ended well with needs being met.  Chef Cosentino is the man.\n\n----\n\nWe arrived about 15 minutes before my reservation and were seated right away at the counter facing the kitchen.  The ambiance was dress casual, seating is pretty cozy as my elbow bumped into my neighbor on occasion during the meal.  It can be loud too so if you're looking for an intimate evening, I probably wouldn't suggest this.  That being said, it's still a good date place, or even a small group date.  We saw Chris Cosentino walking around and even got a picture with him!\n\nService - While it took a few minutes for the waiter to finally come take our order.  The service started slow but ended up being pretty good.  Our waiter was probably overworked... The attentive-ness was the good side side of the border between good and not-good.  I'd say getting the waiter's attention was along the lines of, \"I'm really starting to wonder where my waiter was\"  And just before you start to get impatient he shows up.  Once the orders went in though, things ran smooth, and the waiters and other servers made sure we were happy.  Our waiter was very friendly and helpful despite the slow start.  Sitting at the counter and watching all the action in the kitchen was also a great way to wait.  We saw our food getting prepared and everything!\n\nFood - Between my date and I, we had:\nGrilled Cheese with Honey and Truffle - Cheesy, buttery, sweet. Apparently it's the thing to get at cockscomb.  I'd say it's probably the best grilled cheese I've ever had.  [But I should probably caveat that in saying... it's probably the first \"gourmet\"/fancy grilled cheese I've ever had... unless you count Kraft singles as fancy cheese]\n\nBacon Chop - Man that's one huge hunk of meat.  When I first got it, it looked normal size with some salad on the side.  But nope, brush off the salad to reveal the whole other half of the bacon chop.  The salad was good, had some thin carrot slices, parsley and some other stuff.  I suppose that \"balances\" the meal ever so slightly with me eating the 2 pounds of bacon chop.  Although I admit i \"saved\" some weight by not eating all the fat that's part of the bacon chop.  Speaking of, the taste of the chop was great with the sauce.  The chop itself was cooked right, a touch of very light pink and very juicy.  This bacon chop is why i suggest a \"small group\" date because 2 lbs of bacon chop is a lot.  \n\nButchers Choice - Pork-skin spaghetti.  So apparently you can make pasta out of pork skin.   Very good pasta actually.  I would describe it as a better tasting udon noodle.  I will say though, personal preference is for pasta sauce to be light and \"barely there\"  This was definitely not that.  But the sauce was tasty, but once we ate all the spaghetti, there was definitely a surplus of the sauce leftover.\n\nChocolate Dessert - We had the brule'd marshmallow on top of chocolate pastry brick (I don't know what to call it, it's like a brownie but way more dense) with a chocolate mousse thing on the side.  The added salt on the top was key in making the dessert great.  The brownie thing probably could have been smaller or the marshmallow could have been bigger... cuz we definitley wanted more marshmallow to go with the brownie.  Otherwise it was a good dessert, though not earth shattering.\n\nOverall - Food was different than your standard date-meal fare and new (\"avant-guard?\" is that a term i can use?)  I mean you see why Chef Cosentino is a celebrity chef.  While an initial look at the menu wasn't super impressive, once the waiter described the food, we wanted to order way more than what we could eat.", "author": "Kevin N."}

When they turned on their neon sign, my stomach flipped for joy!  We had our first taste last night and Chris Cosentino did not disappoint.\n\nFirst, I had to start off at the upstairs bar with the draft Negroni, which was totally spot on.  Once at our table, we immediately eyeballed the Truffle Grilled Cheese...I mean  duh, of course! To round out the apps we ordered a half order of Dungeness crab, which was served with crab \"butter,\" and the little gem salad with crispy pig ear.  My only complaint there was that I wanted more pig ear. \n\nFor dinner we ordered the quail tetrazinni, sweetbreads, and duck fat cauliflower - I mean, seriously?  To die for!  Truly, there wasn't a missed note among the meal, from the wait staff to the dessert, so I'd say Cockscomb is off to a great start.\n\nThe only downside?

We followed chef Cosentino from Incanto, which we loved and where we ate often. Cockscomb is a terrific place to share with friends - it's a feast, not a dinner, with giant portions meant to be split and passed across the table. But last night just my wife and I shared a spectacular-looking yellowtail (hamachi) collar - fire-roasted, big fin hanging off the platter, loaded with whole cloves of garlic, roasted greens, chilis and red peppercorns. You hunt around with a large serving spoon, digging through openings in the one for the fatty meat. Amazing at $30, and plenty for two after a few oysters served with unique house-made condiments, and a couple of generous salads and sides with strong, perfectly balanced dressings. No shy flavors here - we are not talking refined - just the essence of hearty good food.", "author": "Charles D."}

A must-try if you like tripe. I prefer it to the similarly sauced pig-skin dish.\n\nPickled sardines great, very close to a traditional Venetian pesce in saor. It's seriously acidic, probably would go well with a sweet-sour cocktail.\n\nDuck liver terrine was simple and pure, perfect texture, clean liver flavor.\n\n\"Hot mess,\" a little toast topped with a lot of foie gras, trotter, trotter gravy, and grapes. Delicious. Had to order bread to sop up the gravy. I couldn't detect the grape jelly that is reportedly in there (the dish was not sweet).\n\nBacon chop was really, really good. I was afraid it would be a \"I could have cooked that at home\" dish, but they do a better job than I can. The brussels sprouts that come with it are great, I would order extra if that was possible.\n\nThe celery Victor was a surprise, instead of the traditional marinated braised hearts it was shaved braised root, shaved raw stalks, leaves, and crisp chicken skin.

The only thing he seemed to contribute to the kitchen was anger and resentment, and a few dishes of food. Granted, the kitchen had been moving a little slowly, but the restaurant had just opened and they didn't have many customers. Easy for us, the customers, to understand.

It was great to see all the action taking place in the kitchen and hear Chef giving directions. The cocktails were nice and the service was incredibly attentive and knowledgeable. We ordered:\n- 2 of each oyster: Delicious and probably our favorite part of the meal. The brother-in-law's comment was \"best oyster's I've had in the United States', which is high praise from someone who used to work in one of the best restaurants in Sydney!\n- Grilled Cheese w/ Duck Egg: Absolutely amazing and I would come back just for that. Second best part of the meal, by far! A can't miss.\n- \"Ham\"burger: didn't blow me out of the water, but wasn't bad. Not sure either of us cared for the hammy flavor, which was our fault for selecting that.\n- I believe he ordered the \"Beef Culotte\" and also wasn't that impressed. \n- For dessert, despite being completely stuffed, we ordered a decadently chocolate-hazelnut item.

They have opened up and brightened the upstairs space Zuppa neglected. Lots of raw wood, industrial lighting and playful decor. The walls are hung with taxidermied... umm, cocks. So they are owning the restaurant's awkward name. Respect.\n\nThe service was excellent. Tyler was charming & helpful but mostly left us alone, and the bartender upstairs filled us in on the San Francisco movie-themed cocktails. I started with the Big Trouble in Little China, of course. The drinks were not cloying or oversweet. No sugar-bomb disguised with menu terms like \"agave syrup\" or \"maple.\"\n\nThe menu is right on the edge of hipsteraunt, with the requisite \"quirky\" post-comfort plates like bone marrow and grilled cheese. (Yawn.) However there is plenty of honest adult fare and offal there as well.\n\nWe started with a raw platter that showed off a perfect crab. The mustard oil for the oysters was a nice touch. The little gem salad was unremarkable and good, but maybe a bit small.\n\nThe grilled cheese was good. Again, if you like that sort of thing. It was gruyere-y, sweet and with a barely-there touch of black truffle. The sweetbreads were buttery and a little chewy. In other words, perfectly prepared.\n\nThe bacon chop was fatty decadence, too much for us to finish. The petrale sole was the surprise star of the meal. A superb piece of fish, in a butter sauce with pickled grapes. These \"grapers\" could have been more sour, actually. The cauliflower in duck fat also good.\n\nOur chocolate mousse for dessert (\"terrine\") was surprisingly chocolatey, not just brown and sweet.

First of all, the restaurant is cold--stone, wood, industrial high ceilings, hard surface floors and an open front door. (Also a giant taxidermy, buffalo head overlooking the entire restaurant. Second, I bought lunch for my husband, 3 sons and me @ $165 including tax and tip which is ridiculous for 4 ala carte sandwiches, the coulotte steak lunch (a few slices of steak and a few wilted cabbagy type leaves w/blue cheese), 2 sides of potatoes and 2 sides of cauliflower, one miniature latte, and one dessert. My vegetarian son thought the impossible burger was the best vegetarian burger he's had. I am confident I could make a better one with zero wheat gluten, and rather...actual food (!) like portobello mushroom, grilled onion, porcini mushroom powder, decent seasoning, maybe a little grain, vegetable or nut flour, etc., instead... Anyhow, they have no seasoning there. Seriously. Everything needs salt and pepper, and some other seasoning e.g., fresh garlic, rosemary, tarragon, whatever! There's no salt and pepper on the table or apparently in the restaurant. I asked for pepper for my sliced coulotte steak (properly cooked), and not only no pepper grinder to be found but they had to scramble around the kitchen finally settling on a small soup bowl with 3/4 teaspoon of black pepper powder dumped in. I ordered a tall latte because it was freezing in the restaurant and they brought me a miniature teacup filled 3/4 full (tasty though!). Afterward, I asked if I could have a plain coffee refill. Nope. No coffee whatsoever. Except another miniature latte. For $165, five people could have had a field day at any number of lunch places.

Like Zuppa used to, the restaurant that preceded it.\n\nBut, my boyfriend and I have been here a few times now and it's just...underwhelming. We ordered the duck fat cauliflower to start, which was undercooked. I make allowances for different textural preferences but I just don't think a cooked cauliflower dish should be crunchy in a raw way. The flavors are great, and we've replicated it amazingly in our own kitchen (subbing in bacon fat; bacon is better - long live bacon!), but almost raw cauliflower is a deal breaker for us.\n\nFor the main course, I ordered the Zambini sausage plate, and my boyfriend ordered the oyster omelet. My sausage was raw in the middle - is this a thing now? I love a nice, rare steak but seriously, my sausage needs to be fully cooked. It was hard to cut through the casing because it wasn't cooked. And, I could overlook this even, but the sausage also didn't really have a flavor. (Not to get nostalgic but Zuppa had some awesome fennel sausage - so flavorful, so delicious, so cooked! I was a vegan when I tried their sausage and it blew my mind right back into being an omnivore. Why can't you blow my mind, Cockscomb?).\n\nThe side of coleslaw of great, though - just the right balance of creamy and tart, with a little spiciness - and I don't even like coleslaw. \n\nMy boyfriend's omelet was fine, he liked the texture but felt like it was missing something.

We were told that there was only one left and after a minute of discussion, we frantically flagged down the waiter and told him we'd take the last one. It came with a giant slab of pork belly and a crab. Kind of an alternative version of your usual steak and lobster.\n\nExcept usually the lobster comes with all of its bits. We only got an empty crab shell and a few legs. The pork belly was very fatty - which was good but it was unbalanced in proportions toward the pork belly. And that much pork belly is simply really really hard to eat.

Just kidding, Chef Cosentino was humble, helping his staff provide the best food/service you could ask for. He spoke with us throughout the meal, he was excited about what he's doing at Cockscomb and it was our pleasure to be his Guest. \n\n  Take two things away from this review,\n\n1) Eat the oyster with Bone Marrow.\n2) Mash the Meat Pie crust into the pie.\n\n  The one thing you don't take away from Cockscomb is Chef's ceramic Pie Bird you thieving degenerates!", "author": "Doug R."}

Ambience of this place is very cool. It's a loud place but good enough to talk with people you're with. The Pin Bone Steak is just delish, especially with that bone marrow dip! (I love me some meat!) Have had the bacon chop here twice--the first time was ehhh...the second time around was really good. It was tastier than it was the first time. Not sure why or if they changed something with the recipe. Another taker for this place: late at night on weekdays (M-F 10 to 11), they have happy hour drinks and a late night menu for food, that include $1 raw oysters and a few other selections. One of my faves during happy hour aside from the oysters are the crispy pig ears! Def a must try!", "author": "Elke S."}

I figured my best bet to get in, w/o a reservation, was a Monday evening and I was right.  I slid in to a seat at the bar without a wait.  I started off with the daily special of steam mussels ($8 that night).  They were fresh and a good size and portion.  The sauce was a simple butter and white wine from what I could tell and wasn't distracting from the mussels themselves.  Since foie gras is now legal in SF I had to get an appetizer that contained that.  I was recommended to try the \"Hot Mess\" (picture uploaded) and my mouth is still drooling over this.  It sounded a bit funky but the taste was amazing.  The Hot Mess is grilled sour dough bread covered with strawberry jam/preserves, topped with grilled foie gras, smothered in melted duck fat (and I think some duck meat, but I'm not sure on that).  Granted mine wasn't as picturesque as some of the others I've seen posted here on yelp but that didn't detract from the flavor.  Was a meal, a desert, or both?  I'm not sure but it was damned good.  I decided not to get another Hot Mess but instead try something different and went for the Quail Tetrazzini.  It looked like the smallest, size wise, entry I could order as I was getting full from the 2 appetizers but wanted the chance to try one more thing before I called it for the night.\n\nI loved the open kitchen concept as well as the farm to table style dishes.  For a new, trendy place in SF the prices weren't outrageous and I think fell in line with the quality of the food.  \n\nThis place is about the food - the quality, the freshness, and the vegetable pairings.", "author": "Ben F."}

We ended up waiting an entire hour, and they didn't offer us any comp on our drinks or a free app or anything. The hostess was apologetic, and we know it wasn't her fault, but that was extremely frustrating. During this time, they sold out of the pin bone steak, which we were hoping to order. Extra frustrating.\n\nWe ended up ordering the 1) eggs eggs eggs, 2) sea urchin bruschetta, 3) bacon chop and 4) pig skin spaghetti.\n1) eggs, eggs, eggs would have been great but the minute we cut into the egg, the yolk stared back at us - fully cooked, not runny at all. What a total bummer.\n2) They gave us the wrong bruschetta, but at this point we were so hungry that we weren't going to wait for them to get the order right. This was pretty good though.\n3) bacon chop was disappointing, pretty bland\n4) pig skin spaghetti - we barely finished half - would say skip this completely.\n\nI think this restaurant has potential, and I would have given it 3 stars were it not for the horrible wait and lack of thoughtfulness in the service.

Even though it was greasy and was as expected, that head was cooked to perfection and EVERY bite is that perfect bite of fall off the bone/melts in your mouth goodness. Besides the pig's head that I recommend everyone to try it at least once in your life, we ordered the pate, bone marrow and steak. The pate is just whatever, could have skipped that. Bone marrow was good, but definitely shouldn't be ordered with the pig's head because of grease overload in your palate.

I really wanted to try the pin steak which is very visually appetizing.  However, the portions for it was more for 4 people and I just came with my date.  We order the lamb shoulder and this was also incredibly delicious.  The Chef behind the kitchen did an INCREDIBLE job firing off the dishes.  My boyfriend and I decided to sit at the counter by the kitchen to watch the food being made and from the Chef to all the Sous Chefs in the kitchen, you can see they all worked incredibly well as a team.  The great thing about it is watching how they all worked to put the dishes together.  My favorite was the grilled cheese, duck fat cauliflower, lamb, and the special they had that night for the appetizer which is a tripe dish.  Now this tripe dish was like no other and nothing like what you think tripe would be.  Because it was so appetizing for a cut of meat that most people would not order, my hats go off to the Chef for putting it on the menu.  This is a place that if you are a risk taker and adventurous with eating, you must come and try the dishes on the menu.  Every item we ordered was well seasoned and cook to perfection.  I would return to try the pin steak dish. One of the better culinary experience I have encountered.  On top of the great food, our wait staff was awesome making sure out water glasses were refilled and our waiter, Ian was so knowledgeable about the food and wine.  I will definitely be returning.  The only thing I was bummed out was not being able to see Chris Cosentino there.  With or without him, his team of Chefs ran a tight ship.

Cocktails were solid, and service was friendly, but not attentive--I mean when 5 barely entrees are picked up without the server or chef checking in, that tells you something about the poor quality control.

Chris Cosentino is a solid top chef and his food is a true testament of his talents.\n\nMy friends and I ordered drinks as soon as we were seated.  Sweet November is an unforgettable cocktail so much so that I've been trying to recreate it at home! Now on to the food.  Everything we ordered was so rich (in a good way) and delicious.  It was very MEAT heavy, but that's what this restaurant is known for, right?\n\nEats:\n+ Country Pate:  So yummmmy.  I'd come here everyday just to eat this.  Pistachios in my pate? YES PLEASE!\n+ Country Ham: Served with chicharrones.. basically pork on pork but the asian pear was a great contrast to the saltiness of the ham and the chicharrones.\n+ \"Ham\"Burger w/ Egg and Foie Gras:  This dish could very well feed at least 2 people.  When I ordered this, I thought I was going to get a juicy beef patty but boy, was I wrong.  \"Ham\" = lamb.  It was cooked well, although, I should have left out the foie as it got a little overwhelming after a few bites.\n+ Bacon Chop: Disclaimer: not actual bacon, but a HUGE portion of thick cut pork.  It was tender and well seasoned.  My friend was surprised at the size of the meat and ended up portioning it out to 3 others.  Besides the pork, the true highlight was the charred onions.  They had a lot of flavor and paired well with the pork.\n+ Cornish Game Hen:  My favorite dish of the night.  It was juicy and the pomegranate sauce was amazing!  Everything about this dish was well balanced.. the taste, the textures, and the color of the ingredients. \n\nI definitely would come back here again just to try their other menu items, perhaps be a little more daring.", "author": "Anne D."}

If I had time to write my review a month ago right after the first visit, it would have been a 3.5-4 stars.\n\nA month later, we decided to return with a bigger group for birthday celebration. The planning is such an awful experience. We spoke to a couple people and the GM. None of them were customer friendly. We read some of the Yelp reviews knowing that they tend to run out of food items, so we tried to reserve a pig head, but they refused (not even with a credit card charge for the pre-order).

We made late afternoon reservations for two with the only seats left at the counter.  When we arrived they found us a table and we were very happy about that.  The staff are very friendly and welcoming.  The place seems very hip and was full, great layout with an open kitchen, dining area on the ground, a lounge on the second floor and an additional dining area.  We found the tables were a bit too long for two as we could barely reach each other across the table and the noise level made it difficult to hear each other.  I would recommend getting counter seats or a corner table that you could sit next to each other if you want to have any conversation.  The menu was interesting and had a few things we were eager to try.  We started with the Country Ham which was delicious.  Thinly sliced ham, almost like prosciutto, served on top of crispy chicharones, pears, and a bit of greens.  My wife had the chicken tetrazzini which was delicious, with a side order of the eggplant which she loved.  I tried the bacon chop.  This is one of the biggest pork chops ever seen on a serving plate.  Cooked perfect and very flavorful.  I also thought it had ALOT of fat.  Some may enjoy that, but I prefer leaner cuts and found the fat portions made it difficult to find meat I enjoyed and difficult to cut and separate.  I would not order this again but would try the sausage or \"ham\" burger instead.  They had several dishes that sounded appealing but were for shared portions which we would try if we came with a larger group. I would give it a 4 star except for the noise level and the fatty chop.  I would still give it another try if I was dining in the neighborhood.", "author": "Steven B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-18", "description": "3.5 stars\n\nMy brother, a fan of chef Constentino and of eating odd things wanted to try this place and since I knew he was going to be free, we made the reservation to give it a try.  \n\nThe restaurant is located on 4th street, across the street from the Well Fargo.  Anyway walking in, the restaurant has a warm feeling.  Maybe it's the open kitchen on a cold winter night and the big animal head that hung over head (I think it was a moose) but has a cabin like kind of feeling.  Once we checked in we were seated right away in a communal like table where they used a few jars of buddha hands to divide up the two parties.  Since my brother and I have been eyeing the menu for a bit, we knew what we wanted to order and our parents are pretty easy so we ordered uni butter with crab bruschetta, greens and herbs, little gem salad, beef heart tartare, medium shellfish platter, pin bone steak, sole, quail, and 18 layer crepe (I think it was 18).\n\nThe bruschetta was good but it was not worth $19.  I didn't taste too much crab or uni and the bread was too chewy for our liking.  The beef heart tartare was a good dish both in portion and taste.  Again the bread that came with it (since they use the same bread) was a bit too tough and chewy.  One thing I didn't appreciate was when we asked for additional bread, they charged us for it which is a bit absurd (2 slices for $1).  The two salads I thought were actually pretty tasty as it wasn't over dressed and decent in portion.  The medium shellfish platter at $48 was enough for us.  A combination of clams, oysters and crab and the few dipping sauces it came with makes this something I will order again.  \n\nFor the entrees, I thought the quail was ridiculously over priced.  Two small pieces of meat for $35 was a rip off.  It was good but not worth $35 good.  We had a quail a few weeks ago at another place, while I don't remember the price (it was close, may be a bit less) there was definitely more meat to it.  The sold was a little bit more filling but could have used more seasoning I thought.  The main attraction, the pin bone steak was actually very generous in size.  There was more than enough for all of us but my brother and I both agreed it needed more flavor.  The beef jus that came with it was average and the bone marrow sauce was pure oil.  While I understand that eating meat on the medium rare side is generally how it's supposed to be, I would have appreciated if the waiter asked if that is okay.  \n\nOverall service was above average as they checked in on us often, made sure we had enough water.  One minor complaint is that if you have a special or something that says market price, let us know the price and don't wait for us to ask.  It's not a big deal but just something i appreciate.\n\nFor dessert the crepe had just the right amount of sweetness but it could be too much for one person as we shared it.\n\nWhy am I giving it 3.5 stars and rounding it down to three?  Overall I think the restaurant is a bit over priced.  We ended up paying $100 a person and I think at a $100 a person, we can probably do fine dining.  I did like this place better than Incanto (chef's last place) and I wouldn't mind giving it another try.", "author": "Pierre L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-12-26", "description": "I hate to slam a restaurant during the holiday season, but the treatment my friend and I received on Christmas Eve was truly shameful. First, you should know that the restaurant had an $85 prix fixe menu for that night. We were seated promptly and ordered. My friend and I both had the persimmon and walnut salad. I had the tartare with foie gras, my friend had the scallops. For our entree, I had the goose comfit while he had a vegetarian risotto. Finally, we each ordered one of the two dessert selections. I also ordered wine and champagne by the glass to accompany the courses.\n\nIt seems the restaurant had miscalculated the food orders, because they apparently ran out of a bunch of stuff. The persimmon salad had two little pieces of persimmon and a scant amount of walnuts. They had compensated by adding pomegranates, but it seems they were even running out of the pomegranates. However, the coup de grace was the entre. After making us wait quite a long time, the entrees arrived, but my friend was presented with, literally, a half-portion of risotto, which was moreover half cooked. Now I know the new trend is to serve risotto al dente, but crunchy? And the whole thing had been disguised, badly, by adding a bunch of chopped red cabbage on top. \n\nEveryone makes mistakes, even at a high-end restaurant, and I would not have been so incensed if the waiter had simply told us that they had run out of X and recommended a substitute. But to serve bad food and expect that we wouldn't notice?? That's just humbug. On any other night, I would have asked to speak to the manager, but I chose to respect the spirit of the season. \n\nAnd the food was not all that amazing, either. The tartare was under seasoned. The salad greens were not cut properly. The goose leg was a bit dry. The best part of the dinner was the desserts; they were scrumptious.\n\nYeah, I won't be going back.", "author": "Ara K."}

Overall: very good experience, and once they get everything really dialed in I think this could be great. \n\nGin Jam cocktail: Fine, but nothing special, lacking a bit of punch/vibrancy. Nothing wrong with it, but I'd prob stick to beer or wine here (which imo accompany this food better anyway).\n\nUni butter, lardo, and dungeness crab bruschetta: Disappointing only because they said uni butter and there was absolutely zero uni taste at all. If they hadn't said that, would have been very happy with a tasty bruschetta with a great combo of crab and lardo.\n\nDuck fat cauliflower: very good, exactly as expected.\n\nRoasted pig's head: This was almost as epic looking as the whole beast at Incanto. Giant pig's head with a ton of meat to dig into. Tender, flavorful meat from all parts of the head, lots of delicious crispy fatty skin, and an extra-tasty ear. We tackled this with two of us, but I'd probably recommend this as a better dish for 4-6 people with other mains alongside. Great dish, and apparently they run out pretty early. Only minor issue with this dish is it comes with some endives that get a little oily on that plate and don't end up contrasting enough with this intensely rich dish, but that's a small nitpick about an excellent dish.\n\nThe dessert menu was like we got transported to a minimalist tasting menu restaurant - entries were \"chocolate, classic, (something else), cheese\" with no other info, so it was useless without having them explained. No big deal, just seems silly. Was totally stuffed at this point anyway.\n\nService was good. Sat at the bar, bartender was very nice and pretty knowledgeable about the menu. Rest of service staff was very good, everything went smoothly.\n\n$80 each with not much drinking.

There was some adventure for sure. We had a great shared appetizer with the tuna collar. The lemon and aromatics really complemented the star of the show and it was somewhat \"fun\" to find where all the tidbits of tuna were hiding. For an entree I had the bacon chop with a side of the fried cauliflower. The cauliflower was the highlight of the meal. The bacon chop - not much. It came on the plate with fresh and cooked apples and what I think was arugula but milder. I expected it to have that traditional roasted pork loin flavor. What I got was a muddled dish where most of the chop was unrendered pork fat. I did expect there to be alot of fat given the name, but thought it would be rendered down giving the remaining meat that special deliciousness you can only get from pork fat. Since we were at the counter of the kitchen we asked a couple of the line chefs about it. They all said it was prepared the way it was intended but would be glad to cook it more.  At this point I was full and really didn't feel like trying to find more meat through all the raw fat. I wouldn't recommend this dish. \n\nWine list was average.

I tried the Zampini and my wife the \"ham\"burger. My fennel sausage, though attractively presented and cooked well, lacked flavor , and I was unable to detect the fennel. My wife's burger was more ground pork than ham, and she was a bit uneasy about the temperature. At any rate we got to meet Chris who was super gracious host. In all, a delightful experience and a very popular restaurant, but maybe not the most memorable food", "author": "MC B."}

He's such a hard working man, gotta respect that.  The highlight of the meal was the pig's head and it was to die for.  The skin was super crispy and the meat was so soft and tender and all the fat and collagen leaves your lips with that savory sticky film.  If you're afraid of fat, you probably shouldn't order this.  I lost the bet to eat the eye ball, but in retrospect it was a total win!!   The eye was so tendony and juicy, hot damn I wish there was two.  5 stars just for the pig's head!!", "author": "Amy C."}

Every dish we ordered was laced with nothing but fat and and grease. The foie gras was overcooked and soaked in a sweet and fruity sauce. The nightly specialty of ribeye steak and dungeons crab was the biggest let down. The steak was tough and chewy with little beef flavor and the crab was cold and half cooked, laced with again grease!! It was so awful that we ended up sending it back to the kitchen!! The spiced chicken and squash waffle was again laced with grease, with the chicken thigh barely cooked and waffles were soggy and soaked in fat!! The only acceptable dishes were the kale and cauliflower for sides!! \nWhat an absolute shocker. Chris Cosentino, please  go back to the drawing board and revamp the menu by cutting down half the fat and grease!!

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2015-07-28", "description": "I went to this restaurant with my parents last week and was very excited to try this place out.  I have been to Chris Cosentino's former restaurant, Encanto, a couple times and also was there for the annual \"Snout-to-Tail\" dinner - such creative dishes with bold flavor that I will probably never forget.  Unfortunately, this experience wasn't anywhere near that of Encanto.  The main issues were dish quality and service time.\n\nTo start on a positive, the drinks that they serve here are great.  They have really creative gin and tonics (they add juniper berries and other gin components to the glass, adding a nice aroma and look).  However, the gin and tonic was $15! Way too expensive for a drink.\n\nI ordered the beef heart tartare as a starter and was surprised by how bland it was - I have eaten normal beef tartare with much more flavor.  I followed that up with the \"ham\" burger - a burger with pork shoulder as the meat, along with caramelized onions and potato wedges.  The meat in the burger reminded me of shumai at a cheap Chinese restaurant - very pink pork with some gristle/toughness to it.  The potato wedges were good, but didn't make up for the dish.  My parents ordered the sweetbreads and squid risotto as appetizers and were not impressed (risotto was \"OK\").  They also ordered the pig skin spaghetti and the \"ham\" burger - the pig skin spaghetti had clear noodles that you normally see in Asian dishes and very little to no pig skin.  The sauce also had a strange ketchup taste...\n\nTo top this off, we waited about 1.5 hours for our entree!  We noticed that other folks were waiting a while for their food, but not the large tables.  Cosentino came out to expedite the dishes, but it seemed to be only for the larger parties (more $$$).  He also spent a lot of time taking pictures with the diners.  He then moved into the kitchen area to help with the dishes, but we only saw the Pig's Head, large steak dish, and other large party-based dishes coming out.  The waiter apologized to us, but for an hour and a half wait we expected to get a small dish or app on the house - which is typical for higher-tier restaurants in the city.\n\nPossibly will come back - so many other restaurants with equally creative dishes, more flavor, and less wait.", "author": "Brian C."}

Dining at Cockscomb was a very enjoyable experience but could have been better.\n\nThe food was excellent, but, as other reviews state, a lot of meat.  For our main course the table ordered both the pig's head and the pin bone steak.  The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly, definitely the best part of the meal.  Highly recommended.  The pig's head was an interesting item and offered some unique flavors, but probably wouldn't be something I would order again.  It seemed like it was more of a novelty item and didn't really provide all that much quality meat for $65.  The appetizers we had were all delicious and top quality -- in particular I enjoyed the beef heart tartare.\n\nA negative part of the evening was the service and pacing of the meal.  There was a large break between the appetizers and the main course.  That, and the kitchen brought out the side dishes we ordered for the table a good 15 minutes before the meat came.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-12-13", "description": "I gave it a 3 star rating because I had built up a lot of expectations for this meal and it didn't quite meet my expectations.\n\nWe ordered the meat special which was a giant T-bone steak with foi gras, foi gras butter, and au jus, a pig's head, a hot mess, the pate, and beef heart tartare. We also had cocktails beforehand and ordered two sides with our meal: mushrooms and foi gras cauliflower. \n\nThe beef heart had a creaminess you wouldn't expect and was very pleasant. Not overly flavorful but very mild. If you didn't know it was beef heart, you'd never be able to tell. The pate was okay. It had more texture than I'd expect but flavor wise, it wasn't bad. The hot mess was delicious. The trotters were perfectly melt in your mouth. There were some bones left which I didn't mind at all. \n\nThe steak was to be cooked medium rare but we all agreed it came out more rare as some of the beef appeared to still be breathing. It wasn't well seasoned but it was still good. I don't feel like the foi gras or the foi gras butter or the au jus added much to the meat other than more richness which it really didn't need. I definitely rate this dish an okay and would not be ordering it again. \n\nHowever, the biggest disappointment was the pig's head. It smelled heavenly and it was cooked to perfection. The skin was super crispy and the meat was fall off the bone melt in your mouth. But it was not seasoned!!! At all!! I looked around the table for salt and pepper shaker but did not see any. I normally never add salt to my food at restaurants. Never. But I needed some desperately for this meal. The head came with two \"sauces\": a white sauce made with brains and a salsa verde made with drippings. I didn't try the white sauce but the salsa verde was a complete fail. It too had no seasoning, just a tanginess and oiliness which was totally not necessary considering the pig's head is pretty much all fat. \n\nI came into this meal knowing it was super rich and fatty but had it had flavor, I would not have been disappointed. I understand that the inside of the pig's head would have been hard to season but the skin was bland and the accompanying sauces were bland. It was bland fat on fat. \n\nThe mushrooms, on the other hand, were utterly divine! Simply delicious. I could have eaten a tub of that. The cauliflower was also delicious. \n\nWe were also very pleased with the cocktails. Best cocktails I've ever had and we had the special house made ones which usually aren't great but these were really really good, especially the Sweet November. It was sweet with a slight but pleasant bitterness. \n\nThe service was a bit on the slow side but it was a packed house. Our meal took 3 hours to finish. \n\nOverall, I'm not sure I'd go back. We've had the leg of beast at his other restaurant that closed, Incanto, and we loved it. So we really expected this meal to be on par and it just didn't live up. \n\nThe sides and cocktails are what made this a 3-star experience for me. Otherwise, it would have been hard to give it even 2 stars.", "author": "Mee V."}

Unconventional selections throughout the menu caused me to go out of my comfort zone on a few of them.  So glad I did.  We started with the Tombo Crudo - a first for me.  It was bursting with wonderful flavors of Vietnamese herbs that complimented the tuna. Next came the Beef Heart Tartare.  Perhaps due to rising expectations, it seemed a little lacking in flavor compared to traditional tartare I've had elsewhere.  For our main courses, we had the Bacon Chop and Coulotte Steak along with a side of the \"Dirty\" Crispy potatoes.  I'm at a loss for superlatives in describing the flavors that we experienced in both dishes.  Both were expertly prepared and complimented with sauces that made me want to slowly savor each bite. I was sad when I took my final bite.  And the potatoes were so unique and tasty with pickled peppers and country ham pur\u00e9e.  These are a must with whatever you decide to have for a main course.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-05-18", "description": "I am in absolute confusion on how to rate this place. I came here for an anniversary dinner with my girlfriend on the trusty reference of our good friend and this place definitely lived up to the hype. In retrospect, I am disappointed in not ordering the foi gras that we were advised to must get, but because we didn't see it on the menu, we didn't know that was an option. So we went on and ordered other stuff, listed below soon. What I am confused about on how to rate this place is not between good or bad, but why I can only rate it at 5 stars and how to describe the night we had here. \n\nFirst off, service is perfect. Made a reservation, showed up a few minutes late, and we were instantly seated at a table set aside for us even when the place was super packed and there were people waiting. The server was amazing and friendly and recommended a lot of good food options to us, however, we went away from the recommendations and went ahead to ordering the whole pigs head and 2 side dishes as well as champagne for our celebration. We were expecting something small and nothing crazy. \n\nThe pig head comes out and is the size of our table. We didn't see anyone else order it so we were a little scared and when it came out, well it did was hard to miss. It was half a pigs head (1 side only) and it was in a giant wok like plate. This thing is huge. We proceeded to take pictures and what not but we had no idea how to attack this monstrous head. We tried to butcher it but the skin was so crispy and thick it was a little hard. We had some trouble so the 2 tables to our left and right tried to give us help and instructions but it was hard and we needed our server. Our server saw us struggle and came over to cut the head properly. He pointed to which parts had all the meats and which parts were best to eat. The skin was definitely crispy for those that likes it. The meat was limited under the cheeks and was extra tender and fatty (delicious!!!). One thing that some may try and may not, is the eye of the pig. If you are Asian the story is that fish eyes are good for your eyes and green onions make you smarter, but what about the pig's eye? Well my girlfriend gave that a try and it was an interesting piece to the pigs head indeed. Overall it was too much for us and we failed to finish the whole pigs head. However, we did take it home! :) The champagne was great accompaniment. \n\nAfter pictures and attacking this, the service, the price, the quality, the ambiance, we will definitely be looking to going back!  This place is very casual and a bit loud. The kitchen and bars were perpendicular to each other and you can see the chefs cook as well as walk up to the bar to grab a drink to wait for a table if you need it. \n\nThis place is great and I am looking forward to going back to try this giant steak and foi gras that was recommended to us. \n\nTips: \n1) Make a reservation\n2) The front door is in the ally (hard to find if you walk down the street towards the sign\n3) Pigs head (3-4+ people portion)\n4) Try the pig's eye if you get the pig's head \n5)Have a few drinks\n6) Enjoy!", "author": "Kevin W."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-01-08", "description": "I became a huge fan of Chris Cosentino after rooting for him on Top Chef Masters so I was really excited to check out his newest venture, Cockscomb. \n\n3.5 stars for the food. \n\nThe standouts:\n-fried potatoes served with & Chips and the \"Ham\"Burger: the side crispy potatoes that accompanied these dishes were outstanding. Chunky, twice-fried nuggets of potatoes that are impossibly crispy on the outside and creamy inside. These should be made into their own side dish. They were soooo much better than the side dishes we actually ordered. \n\nPretty good:\n-BACON CHOP apples, brussellskraut & mustard: not a Tomahawk size, but the pretty damn biggest serving of meat that I've had in awhile. I dug into it immediately and barely put a dent in it. But that's probably because I had to cut through 2-3\" of fat to get to the meat. If you're not okay with fat and gristle (which you don't have to eat, but which I did sneak bites of), you may be disgusted by the Bacon Chop. Bacon is ideal name for this chop as there are several thick layers of fat interlaced with meat. As I was cutting through the fat & gristle, I had a flashback to that scene from The Great Outdoors where John Candy gnaws and sweats his way through a 96oz steak. This pork chop was not on that level, but definitely reminiscent. The THICK layers of fat do serve a purpose tho. The resulting meat is enveloped in juicy layers of fat, self-basting itself with juices and super tender and juicy to the bite. The chop was probably brined as well to up the juicy-quotient. The apples/brusselskraut seemed more of an afterthought for me and it didn't stand out. I wish this dish came with a starch b/c the meat portion was daunting and needed something to contrast/offset it. I barely ate a third of it and I couldn't even bring myself to finish the leftovers for lunch because of all the fat. \n\n-COUNTRY PATE pistachios, cornichons, butter: one of the better country pates I've had in awhile. the pate was rustic and meaty and you could really savor and taste distinct pieces of meat in it\n\n-LITTLE GEMS green goddess, radish & cracklins: a nice beginning to the meal. the lighter, sweeter pieces of the romaine variety were a nice contrast to the crisp radish and the crunchy, slightly saltly cracklin pieces \n\n-\"HAM\"BURGER grilled onions, gruyere cheese, Dijon & fried potatoes: the server described it as as a ground pork patty, but it tasted and felt more like a salty bits of ham cold cuts that had been ground up and re-fashioned into a patty. The doughy bun, grilled onions and melted cheese made for a tasty sandwich, but it definitely doesn't pack the beef \"meatiness\" that you crave from a traditional hamburger. \n\n-\"& CHIPS\": a fancy version of traditional British bangers and mash, or sausages and mashed potatoes. The pork sausage itself was meaty, but the texture left something to be desired. It was slightly dry and I was craving a bit more fat content. The taste is interesting as well: super herbaceous, bright, and citrusy. \n\n-MARKET VEGETABLE weather dependent: roasted acorn squash \n\nOkay, but I would pass: \n-'EGGS, EGGS, EGGS' salmon roe & tarragon aioli: a creamy poached chicken egg, 2 poached quail eggs, and salmon roe atop a creamy, herbacious tarragon aioli. The combination of the luscious broken yolks, delicate egg whites, and aioli made for a light, yet decadent mouthful. The bright pops of saltiness from the salmon roe were an interesting side  note. However, it came with one hard piece of table bread. This would've been better if more thought was put into the accompanying bread, like if it were a buttered, toasted brioche. \n\n-CRUDO OF THE DAY: while crudo and ceviche are very similar, we felt that this was more of a ceviche preparation because it was served with tortilla chips. Pretty non-descript. \n\n-BROCCOLI RABE garlic, lemon, chili & breadcrumbs\n\n-DUCK FAT CAULIFLOWER red fresno, garlic, caper & mint\n\nI would like to give Cockscomb another chance and try other items on the menu (especially the shared suppers), but for now 3.5 stars for the food.", "author": "Monelle A."}

The ham looked beautiful on the plate and along with the Asian pears, complemented it well.  For dessert I got the chocolate cake which melted in my mouth.

My friend had been raving about this place for a while, so we made plans to go here a month in advance and made a reservation.\n\nService was perfect. Very friendly, knowledgable about the menu, and always kept our water filled.\n\nFood:\n\nAsparagus Starter - very acidic, green, fresh, crisp salad. Almost like taking a mouthful of grass.\n\nButcher's Choice for the day - Morel Mushrooms + Cow Udder in a creamy white sauce. The morel mushrooms were delicious, but the cow udder was basically lightly fried fat. It got sickening really quickly.\n\nBacon Chop - 80% fat, 20% meat. The fat was good (fat is always tasty), but it got really really sickening.\n\nMeat Pie - Ingredients change daily. Mine had oysters, beef, carrots, and collared greens. Beef was tough and chewy. The pie was very disappointing. I was expecting an actual pie with a thick meat filling, but it was just a piece of crust on top of a bowl of watery soup, with no crust around the filling. The filling was, like mentioned, watery soup filled with oysters and unchewable beef.\n\nAt this point, we were disappointed with the meat pie and completely sick of all the fat from the bacon chop, so we decided to order the grilled cheese to get some carbs in.\n\nGrilled Cheese - Brie-filled grilled cheese sandwich perfectly fried, drizzled with honey, and topped with a sunny side up duck egg. In my opinion, it was the best dish of the night.\n\nFor desserts, we got the chocolate and the fruit desserts:\n\nChocolate hazelnut ganache cake topped with clotted cream - absolutely perfect. Moist, delicious, not too sweet.\n\nStrawberry Shortcake with mint leaves and rhubarb - the shortcake wasn't moist. It felt kind of old and dry. The mint was very refreshing though (the whipped cream seemed to be infused with mint as well), and the strawberries were tart and tasty.\n\nHere's the not so fun part. As soon as I finished eating, I had an upset stomach. After I got home, I threw up, and the morning after, I had uncontrollable diarrhea for hours.\n\nSo, in summary, this was my experience with Cockscomb:\n\n- Good service.\n- Tons of things not listed on the menu, such as Surf & Turf and Hot Mess. Pretty damn annoying. I know the ingredients change every day, but at least put the name of the dish on the menu. I don't want to be repeatedly asking the waiter for the specials (\"Hey, can we have the thing you mentioned that has cow udder in it? Oh that's called Butcher's Choice? Okay yea I want that.\").\n- Everything just has WAYYY TOO MUCH FAT. Like solid cubes and globs of lard.\n- The only dishes I truly enjoyed were the grilled cheese and the chocolate cake.\n- I got some kind of indigestion or food poisoning afterwards.\n- After tip, the bill came out to $75 per person (2 people total).\n\nI might come back to try out the pinbone steak instead sometime, but for now, I don't think I even want to look at meat.", "author": "Michelle H."}

But make sure that everyone in your dining party has the same taste because there are no \"safe\" alternatives for someone who would like to opt out.  (No pasta dish, no chicken, not even a typical hamburger.  Instead, they offer quail, fish with sea urchin salsa and a burger made out of ham.)   I like piggies, but the menu was a bit much, even for my adventurous tastes, and I felt like they were pushing the offal a bit too much.  \n\nOur server was very, very slow.  We waited 45 minutes for our meals (while other tables were served around us), and although I hate to say it, he came by to top up our wine glasses so often that between this and the delay, we felt like it was a ploy to get us to finish the bottle, so we'd order another with dinner.  We also had to wait twenty minutes after the dessert menu before he took our order for dessert.   Minus a star for service.\n\nPricey, but that's to be expected in SF.

This time around, since it was just the two of us; unfortunately we weren't able to try their shareable dishes,which included the lamb shoulder, pig head and pin bone steak. We had the beef heart tartare to start which was delicious but some of the bread it came with was burned. Good balance with the arugula dressed with olive oil and lemon juice. Next course was the udder and escargot special. Really fatty and really delicious.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2015-02-27", "description": "Right now, in this moment that I am typing on my 'puter: I JUST read Chris Cosentino's Wikipedia page. Prior to this evening; I had NO idea that he was a Celebrity Chef (I knew he was a SF Chef, but really NO clue about the rest), no idea that he grew up in Rhode Island and no idea that he's an entrepreneur with a sausage outpost at San Francisco's Ferry Building. I didn't know about Iron Chef; i simply didn't know about the brainstorm behind the experience I had tonight that I am about to share with all of you. All I knew was this was a place to get great meat, great drinks and Cherrystones. Being from MA, I crave a little bit of home every now and then. Cockscomb is THE PLACE for lobster, clams, oysters, real meat on the grill, potatoes cooked just like Grammy used to...THEY USE REAL BUTTER! The entire thing, everything...its done with love. The ambiance, the music, the little tongue-in-cheek labels on the hand drier in the bathroom...the line of (mostly super smokin' hot men) cooking, burning themselves, sweating their balls off; literally...all in the name of great food for YOU, Me...and everyone that walks through the threshold of this glorious masterpiece.\n\nThere are 3 ways that captivate my heart and create loyalty; authenticity, the little details and great food. From the moment I opened the door to this amazing venue everyone on 'Team Cockscomb' was attentive, courteous and professional. My friend and I were seated at the bar, which is perfect for 2 single girls enjoying the open kitchen and everything else that is sensory overload for a good solid hour. I was welcomed by a wonderful man that let me know just as part of my conversation where the bathroom was located and where the 'hooks for your purse' are located. PHENOMENAL. It's not that I don't ever leave my home and people aren't nice to me; it's just awesome to experience great attention to the 'little things' when you aren't expecting it. The Yelp reviews lead me to this place, but don't do any justice when it comes to really, truly experiencing what it's like to dine here. \n\nOur Server knew my name, he knew it was a Birthday Dinner for me (which was not necessary, I have generous friends). I liked the guy so much I hugged him twice...once at the beginning of our meal and at the end when he told me how great we were. HE was the great one. I mean this guy Gabriel...he gave us a tour of the menu, explained the details, helped us feel at home and everything...was PERFECT. We tried the oysters, the cherry-stones (which were fabulous). The avocado enhancement was killer, I wish I knew exactly what that was because it's creamy and so yummy on the raw shellfish. Never have I had that, and I love it much more than a mignonette. We also asked for the beef heart tartare with roasted/pan fried/buttered potatoes (I want a bucket of them so I can be in a carb coma); whoa! you have to order this. The foie gras...best I've ever had. The bacon chop; it's enough for 4 people. The thing is HUGE and yummy, bacony...again, I'd never had this cut of meat and I hardly eat pork. You must get this. We also tried the chocolate...and yes...the cheese. Chocolate was decadent, rich, chocolatey...I much preferred the cheese. Bleu, honey, walnuts, jam...yum. We left with a doggie bag. I left with a new found love for a slice of my home in San Francisco. The entire evening I felt like I was in the company of an old friend and now it makes complete sense why. Thank you for a wonderful memory.", "author": "Sherie R."}

Low and behold, right when we walked in, we saw Chris Cosentino looking super involved in everything, which we took as a good sign.\n\nThe menu features a lot of more unusual animal part and offal and has slightly less options for non-meat eaters (I liked the pastas at Incanto a lot).  \n\nWe started with a bottle of Barbaresco that was pretty tannic, and it was really unexpected for a Barbaresco, but after some decanting it was ok.  I also had a Bullit, which was rye, cyanar, and bitters, but it was basically an Old Fashioned in the end, and it was still a little sweet for me.\n\nOnto food: We definitely did this family style.  Things are pretty rich, so it's better for sharing..\n- Grilled cheese with truffle: the truffle was very subtle, but I loved the honey with it, and in the center, it was quite generous with the melted cheese\n- Celery Victor: a non traditional play on the dish with celery root and celery with chicken skins\n- Toasted oats: probably my favorite dish - it was like a risotto made with oats, mushrooms, and a soft cooked egg.  It had a nice black pepper kick to it\n- Butcher's choice: calves liver - loved the mushrooms with it, but liver just isn't my thing\n- Meat pie: pork belly, snails, black mushrooms.  Broth was very flavorful, and the crust on top was good, but the broth could use some more bread (they do have Tartine bread for $1)\n- Escarole with boccarones: so we could feel less guilty about all the meat; but this was still pretty rich\n- Pig's head (reserved ahead of time): An entire pig head, served with poached pig brain and aoili (\"brainaise?\") and another herb oil.  This was very impressive in presentation, but you have to love all the gelatinous and fatty stuff.  The pig skin was really good and crisp on the outside, but even with the greens, it was too heavy for me.\n\nService is pretty spot on considering they just opened.  Prices ended up being pretty reasonable since the food is very filling.  If you like meat and offal, definitely come.  The layout is nice, and it's always good to see the chef there actively involved.  However, if you're not big on animal parts, then it may not be the place for you.", "author": "Marilyn T."}

The location is great, one of those tucked in areas of SOMA surrounded by loft like restaurants and businesses. We started with a pork skin putanesca with capers and olives ! It was marvelous! I'm really picky about the cuts of meat I like. The pork skin was cooked very tender and wash slice was coated with a great tomato, garlic, caper sauce. It was like I was eating the best noodles !! We also ordered the beef heart tartare which I have to admit I was reluctant. I don't care for organ meat, boy did this change my mind. A very mild taste that was so tender. Topped with a mustard sauce. ( I think that was mustard) during our visit Chef Cosentino  was ever present. We finished our meal with the Bacon Chop , this isn't your regular pork chop. It is a hearty pork chop bone in with pork belly attached. The best cooked pork chop ever, the pink ring that surrounded the chop is a telltale sign of a perfect cook.

The atmosphere-- fun, loud, and very unique with the open kitchen. We were seated at the bar, right in the thick of all the action. Instead of ordering two big entrees, we ordered four appetizers-- the grilled cheese with truffles, uni and lardo bruschetta, beef heart tartare, and the hot mess (foie gras with strawberries and trotters). The food was AMAZING. The foie gras was by far the best-- just out of this world delicious. I was surprised how much I liked the tartare, never having eating raw meat before. And the uni and lardo bruschetta was delectable, something that I would have never thought I would have liked. Out of the four, i guess my least favorite dish was the grilled cheese because i found it slightly too salty and would have preferred it without the egg, but that is just personal preference because my husband loved it. All in all, it was a fantastic experience. I highly recommend it and we will be back again. We met Chef Chris Cosentino on the way out, and he just seemed like a sweetheart-- someone that is just really happy with the work that they are doing.

Both were delectable!\n\nOnce at our table, chef Chris Cosentino (yeah, the super famous guy!) started sending out a barrage of courses, each one topping the others. He started us with a huge tower of oysters, lobster, crab, mussels, and urchin.  The five of us left no shell untouched. \n\nNext came the \"pork chop,\" which was a 3 lb. pork rib roast that basically still included the bacon on it. Soooooooo tender. \n\nFollowing the chop, Chris sent out the....wait for it.... PIG HEAD. Literally a half a pig head roasted to perfection. Who knew pig cheeks were so tasty and tender. It was like fire roasted butter!\n\nFinally, we were delighted by the \"Pinbone Steak\" -- another HUGE cut of meat (this time beef -- 96 oz. of it).  \n\nWhat made every course so special was its slow roasted treatment in the kitchen's wood oven.  It gives everything that comes out of it a rich, smokey flavor, a crisp exterior, and an oh-so-tender core. \n\nAll-in-all, Cockscomb far exceeded my wildest expectations, even given Consentino's reputation.

Pork shoulder and another part, which escapes me.   The crispy fried potatoes that accomany this should be a menu item on it's own.....delicious.   Truly handsdown one of the best burgers in the Bay Area.  Believe me, few, very few places have met expectations.  Not only did this burger do that, it went over and beyond.\n3. & chips.  This particular evening, it was a sausage, and oh how fresh and lovely this was.   \n4. House draft Cider.   This is my new thing, cider.  Irish, English and lately American.   This one had the perfect balance and went down quite nicely.\n5. Dessert.  Hmmm, where to start on this wonderful treat?   We ordered the \"Fruit\" plate and it came with a cake that was made with olive oil.  I can't say enough about this because it was a 2nd time order and just as terrific as before.\n\nStop by if you don't have a reservation, sit or stand at the bar.

He was also nice enough to say bye and thank us from behind the counter when we left. \n\nDRINKS:\n1) Pisco Punch - My fiancee loved it.\n2) Vertigo Fizz - I thought it was tasty. Would have been better if it had a little more fizz though.\n\nFOOD:\n1) Crudo of the Day - This was very good. We decided to add this onto our menu for the night last minute. No complaints here.\n2) Gems salad - I loved this dish. The pig ears added a nice crunch to the salad. My fiancee didn't care for them, but that just means more for me!\n3) Grilled cheese - THE BEST GRILLED CHEESE YOU WILL EVER HAVE! Gotta learn to make this at home.\n4) Hamburger - My fiancee said it was the best burger he's ever had. Even better than the one he had at Gordon Ramsay's Burgr in Vegas. I had a taste too and it was heavenly. I think if this came on toasted sourdough, it would be my dream sandwich. \n5) Pizzani (?) - It's the sausage dish. This was the least exciting of the night. I felt the sausage was spicy, but bland. Could have used a tad more salt and char. The salad was dressed in a sort of creamy dressing, which became difficult to eat when paired with the sausage. I would have been happy with a green salad dressed with just lemon juice and olive oil. \n\nOverall, it was great. Would definitely return, especially for that delicious grilled cheese!", "author": "L M."}

Two of us had birthdays in the same week and decided to do something really different with our accompanying friends on what can only be billed as a taste safari.\n\nThis menu is really different. \n\nI say that as a compliment because it delivered exactly what we were looking for - the novelty of experiencing exotic and unconventional-to-the-American-palette dishes in a pleasant setting. We skipped the more traditional entrees and went straight for the jaw-droppers: the towering melange of a seafood platter, the pigs head, the snail shepherd's pie, etc. I can't tell you whether the food was properly prepared because I have nothing to compare it to, except to say it was a memorable and fascinating experience. We had people from a nearby table request to take pictures of our plates, which only added to the surreality of what we were eating, but perfectly titled for a birthday dinner adventure. You won't otherwise hear me say this about a restaurant, but I really didn't care if the food was delicious - I was more interested in just experiencing it - savoring each bite and trying to evaluate my own visceral impression of \"do I like this?\" and checking to see what my tablemates thought as well.\n\nFor that, this restaurant gets four stars. I don't know that I would order those dishes more than once a year (they are inherently rich foods) so when I return for a non-birthday, I'll have a chance to sample the less eye-catching fare that would normally be the highlight of your better dining establishments but at first can't compete here with the rest of the edible cirque du soleil on this menu. \n\nI applaud the chef for attempting something bold and unique and entertaining and pulling it off. For that alone, I'm going to suggest you try it at least once this year. Maybe twice just to make sure.", "author": "Christian V."}

The other 3 of us, got the pinbone steak which is meant to feed 4 people. Our waiter though still encouraged us to get an appetizer. We already thought the steak and an order of cauliflower was more than enough for just 3 of us and the friend who got the special was planning on dessert so we politely declined. \n\nThe Lobster and Pork Belly special came out and the portion was huge. It could've easily fed 2-3 people if not 4. Combined with the pinbone steak, we had WAY TOO much food. Granted we didn't ask how big the special was, but knowing the portions why would the waiter still encourage us to order more food, unless only to up the bill/tip. Sufficed to say we were surprised at the portions and then of course dreaded the cost of the bill, with a ton of food leftover.

I admit, probably not the smartest idea to get both of those to share with the lady, but we had to try them both and while they were both top notch, it was almost like it was too much of a good thing. Looking back, with just the two of us there, I wish we had tried something else for variety's sake. Also got the grilled cheese with white truffles and honey (read: REALLY good, but then again white truffles sort of makes EVERYTHING better), and the pig skin spaghetti with puttanesca sauce. It had a bit of a weird texture (after all noodles made of pig skin probably would), but it was really flavorful, and the acidity and brightness of the sauce definitely balanced out the richness of the noodles. Followed that up (I know right, somehow we still had space in our stomachs) with the crepe cake with yuzu marmalade and citrus, which while I thought it was good, just seemed a bit too tangy/acidic. Really wish it had some chocolate sauce to balance it out and it probably would have been perfect. \n\nAll in all, pretty dang close to a perfect meal, Chef Chris also stopped by the table at the end of the meal and it was really nice to shake his hand and thank him for an excellent meal. Definitely give this place a try if you're in the area!", "author": "David H."}

The small restaurant oozes \"hipster foodie cool\" from half a block away.  I booked a reservation here with the intent of entertaining some out of town guests, and I was not disappointed!\n\nAmbiance:  Very cool and industrial space, but warm lighting and cool decor that is very animal-centric.  I love the open kitchen and the staff was super friendly (everyone looked as though they had been awaiting my arrival all night :-P)\n\nCocktails/Beverages:  Decent beer and wine selection with a nice cocktail list.  This is pretty standard in all restaurants of this caliber in SF, so no complaints here\n\nApps:  Started with the oysters, which were served with varying sauces/oils.  I really liked the avocado green tomatillo salsa!  OH. MY. CHEESE.  The honey truffle grilled cheese app was PHENOMENAL.  Somehow still golden and crispy even though it was drizzled in sweet honey...perfectly topped with shaved black truffle.  I think this was the best thing I ate at Cockscomb.\n\nMains/Sides:  We ordered the pig's head (to share between 4), the Meat Pie, and a side of broccoli rabe and duck fat cauliflower.  The pig's head was cooked to perfection...crisp, light skin with juicy pulled-pork style meat underneath.  The flavor was incredible.  The Meat Pie of the evening was pork belly and clam.  Interestingly enough, the server described this as a stew with a crust on top, but it was more like a soup.  The pie was mostly a rich, delicious broth with some juicy bits of pork and veggies inside.  It tasted like home.  The sides were good, though nothing to write home about.  We basically just ordered them as obligatory fiber additions to our fat kid meal.  \n\nI definitely recommend Cockscomb for those who want to do something a little different and interesting for dinner!", "author": "Vivien M."}

My buddies and I came out here with our expectations being met by the end of the night.  The restaurant is located in SOMA and a convenient pay parking lot can be found right across the street. The place is welcoming and the staff is excellent  with the waiters always attentive .  The interior of the restaurant is very simple and modern with a large bar on the first floor, another mini bar on the second and plenty of tables on both. Bathroom was OK although you would have to wait in line - could be better. Reservations are a must as it gets packed, definitely a good place to go to if you're going out with a group of friends. Not sure how I would feel though on a date night as the place can get a bit loud.\n\nThe menu was promising. Starting off with the grilled cheese, beef heart tartare, and foie gras. The grilled cheese and beef tartare was delicious but the foie gras is must if you're a fan. The combination of the three was definitely enough for 4 grown men. \nFor my entree I ordered the Bacon Chop and  shared with the guys on the Pig's Head. The Pig's Head was roasted near to perfection coming out hot from the wooden oven, watch you're fingers! The best part was definitely the cheek, melting like butter in your mouth. The skin wasn't too over cooked but just at the right crunchiness, mm-mm! The Bacon Chop, unfortunately, was a bit of  a disappointment as most of it was all fat but nonetheless the flavor was excellent and the dip that came out with it made you want more. I would suggest ordering more bread if its gets too porky or meaty for you. I will note though that my two other buddies came out with better chops as theirs were not as fatty. The dinner ended with some coffee and chocolate which was satisfying. \n\nOverall, the place was  good but what made the place stand out I think was the service and the portion size. Our sever David did a very good job always meeting my groups needs. The waiting time for our food was conveniently fast. Drinks were always asked for which was great. I would  definitely come again.", "author": "Alvin T."}

The bacon pork chop was so amazing, that it made me question why I haven't ordered pork chops for every meal that I've eaten before. It was the best pork chop I've had, and it changed my mind on pork chops going forward. \n\nThe duck fat braised cauliflower was a perfect complement to the main course. And the meal was rounded out by a light salad to start and a light dessert to end. \n\nI am terribly sorry to have never had a meal at Encanto before it closed, but I count myself so lucky to have caught a meal at Cockscomb now.", "author": "Quan L."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2015-02-20", "description": "Ambiance is nice, very much like other hipstery joints in vogue right now: cheeky details referencing the name, lots of wood, vintage light bulbs. Drinks were solid but their drinks menu was heavy on the gins which I personally don't like and found disorienting. Paper straws are awesome in general but didn't work when hanging out in a cocktail for a while. I had to navigate giant icecubes to get to my drink after  the straws stopped working. Beer menu is pretty good. We ordered the grilled cheese, salad of the day, the pork skin pasta, and the pig head. Portion sizes seemed average except for the pasta. Listed as an entree it was the tiniest bit of skin pasta I've ever seen. I know the pig skin gives it a mouth feel and weight that makes this the perfect size but it just didn't match up. The pigs head is a great visual dish but the ratio of edibles to solid fat and bone is skewed against the edibles, and my party was the kind that digs to find everything, including what we think was the dark, minerally larynx.   Also loses some points for not offering the brain as is. The brain aioli is a joke. Finally I felt that the head would be better cooked rotisserie style because the current cooking method leaves a bunch of the skin floppy and inedible. Desserts were meh. Service was ok.

Small restaurant, but the tables are well placed.  You MUST be a carnivore, since this place is all about meat.  The service was good, but slow.  The food, well...we walked out $600 later (albeit 2 bottles of nice wine), and overall not happy with what was served.  The meat pie sounds yummy, but we didn't care for it.  It had red meat, kale and oysters.  The fish smell overpowered the dish (and they looked/tasted like OLD oysters).  The quail was smothered in rich sauce, which took away from the taste of the bird.  I've had amazing quail in the past, and this was just a soupy mess.  I love grilled cheese, and we did try this as an app for the four of us.  The two bites each was enough...there is honey on the bread, which is just a little sweet for everyone at the table. I'm glad we tried it, but sadly we won't be going back.", "author": "A H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-12-21", "description": "I really wanted to like this place. It has a great ambiance and a generally nice vibe at first glance. However, the experience was so lackluster I can't really imagine going back.\n\nOur reservation did not get off to a good start. Due to a serious \"texting while walking\" problem (and just generally being late), I walked past the \"FOOD AND DRINK\" sign on 4th St. (indicating the whereabouts of the actual alley-way entrance), costing me a very valuable and important minute. Alas, I had arrived at 8:46pm for an 8:30pm reservation. With little emotion and certainly nothing registering anything close to sympathy, we were informed that there is a 15-minute policy that was to be enforced vigorously, and thus the wait for our table will now be up to 30 minutes. Okay, fine - there is a policy; a policy that makes sense, and my party was certainly not above the rules. However, the draconian application was both off-putting and ironic given that Cockscomb fails to meet (maybe even set?) deadlines in preparing and serving food to the very guests it worries so much about seating within a particular time frame.\n\nAlthough the food was definitely good, the manner in which it was served left a bad taste. We had placed an order for an entree to share between three people while upstairs in the lounge, but were sat at our table immediately after doing so. Re-thinking our decision, we asked to cancel it to re-assess our overall dining strategy while at the table. We were faced with another policy prohibiting our actions, but this time an exception was graciously made and the order was purportedly canceled. \n\nMany moons later, our appetizer order is taken. A long time after that, our entree order is taken - at which time, the server verbally re-confirms our appetizer order, strongly suggesting it still has not been put in. During both of these conversations, we re-confirm with him that our upstairs order has in fact been canceled. Our server \"hadn't heard anything about it,\" which was enough to allay our concerns.\n\nBy the time we received our appetizers, the couple who had sat next to and also after us had already eaten and left. In a flurry of activity, we receive in a flash all four appetizers at once, including the oysters - which, in my experience, are served a) almost immediately after ordering and b) separate and apart from other appetizers. Accompanying these appetizers is NOT the grilled cheese I ordered (which I assume for space reasons will come later), but the canceled entree in question. \"I told them that we ordered that entree and I wanted to make SURE you got it,\" says the server. I cannot tell if this is vindictive or just evidence of confusion.\n\nTime passes. No grilled cheese.\n\nEntree silverware is placed. No grilled cheese.\n\nEntrees finally arrive. I ask about the grilled cheese.  I am met with a blithe and toally unconcerned: \"Oh, it didn't come out?\" No, it did not. Obviously. Because I am asking about it. Several minutes later, it appears, borne by the manager who admittedly does apologize and says by way of explanation that they \"have several large parties upstairs.\" I do not know what this explains, as our server is stationed downstairs and the restaurant has by this late hour mostly cleared.\n\nThe rest of the meal was generally uneventful, although the server seemed more than done - with us specifically or his shift, I'm not sure, but I swear all comments contained in this review were kept to myself at the time so it would be undeserved if it were aimed at us.\n\nThe grilled cheese was still on the bill, which felt like a slight after a meal that took almost 3.5 hours and was served in a very stop-and-go, inconsistent fashion (and given it had been ordered as an appetizer, was forgotten and added only after a reminder during the entree course).\n\nAny one of these things might not in and of itself been enough to make me feel annoyed, but overall I feel I did not enjoy my experience here as much as I should have. In short, it feels like Cockscomb was put together by people who really know restaurants, and then run by people who really don't.

I took a friend for our mutual birthday celebration; she'd never been there before.  We ordered a LOT of food for two girls, and it was all wonderful.  We started with the Green Goddess salad with pig ear cracklins, then to Scotch Oysters, moved on to bone marrow topped with uni bottarga, Bruschetta with ricotta cheese and Morels was next; by this time we were verging on sensory overload, in the very best way possible.  Next was the Hot Mess, oh man.  It was a hot mess of goodness!  Seared foie gras on toast, topped with pulled pork belly, pickled green and red strawberries and a delicious sauce. The bread absorbed all the flavors and so it was a perfect bite every time. That dish was the winner of the evening for me.  We did share the surf & turf but it proved too hard to crack the crab (surf & turf was spicy crab on top of a slab of pork belly, oh my..) so after getting some help from the waiter, we were able to take a stab at it but by then we were honestly getting too full.  We took most of that dish home.  My only criticism of it was that the crab wasn't partially pre-cracked.  I recently had hand surgery and don't really have a good grip right now so it would have helped to have it made a bit easier.  That isn't a criticism of the dish itself, because it was delicious.

But then the waitress told us that the pigs head was not that big and that we should get three appetizers with it and also encouraged my husband to go for a medium seafood platter. This was much too much food for two people, and by the time we got to the pig we were too full to enjoy it. We ended up taking most of it home, a very expensive doggy bag. I really don't appreciate this kind of dishonesty on the part of the waitress.", "author": "Naomi G."}

Cockscomb's space is nice, the hostesses are friendly, the china is cool, and we had a good table. The good pretty much ends here. We've done the animal parts thing in SF and in LA, as well as overseas. There is nothing distinctive about the Cockscomb version. If you haven't partaken, then you may be happy & surprised, hence a great review. If you've been there before, you get why Cockscomb is just meh, average, and verging on boring. We went on a holiday, for dinner, it was 2/3 full at best, the entire time we were there. Waiter was overly solicitous in a bad way, and the manager paces around frowning. They were really over-staffed the evening we went, also in a bad way. And the food, it's average fare for animal parts. The thing about this trend is that is has to be surprising & fun & a WOW factor. Cockscomb is not wow. It's not a distinctive menu. And the plating is beyond minimal, to careless. Crudo scooped from a ice cream scoop with a few chips, burger with nothing on the plate except fries, sole with nothing citrus, bare vegetables...maybe the regulars get some nice flourishes? If you are into this cuisine, you can find it elsewhere in SF with less attitude. If you're really into this cuisine, or looking to get into it, do yourself a favor and head to LA, to Animal. Animal has been doing this cuisine for years, it has the best vibe, it's a fun evening with fellow diners sharing which makes for superb spirit, and every plate is fab looking & unbelievably tasty, not too heavy, and engagingly described by the wait staff as well. Cockscomb reviews are either endorsing (which must be from animal parts newbies) or meh, from folks like us.", "author": "S S."}

SF has so many other places to offer, so save your time and go some place else. And, if you reserve a table, you might end up at the chefs counter, which to me isn't exactly a table.", "author": "Trusty D."}

Also loved, loved , loved the grill cheese sandwich. Petrale Sole was the favorite entree on the table. Bacon chop sounds better than it actually is, and btw it s a huge piece of meat. Not exciting. We would probably return for appetizers and cocktails.", "author": "D S."}

I'm lucky enough to live across the street and was hoping his place would be delicious out of sheer convenience...boy did they deliver.  Had the sea urchin and lardo bruschetta and the truffle grilled cheese to start. Both were very solid. Shared a Bacon Chop and Sole for entrees.  Why no one else is leaving the belly attached to a pork chop is mystifying, the bacon chop ROCKS!  Decent selection of beers available, and the cocktails were very tasty.  The look and feel of the space was inviting and the service was actually flawless. Not just great for a restaurant that just opened either, but actually outstanding. Not sure where they found our server(think his name was Dave?) but he was very knowledgeable of the menu, anticipated our every need, and seemed genuinely happy to have us there. Hope this place stays a secret for as long as possible, but would've felt guilty if I didn't share it's awesomeness with the rest of the world.", "author": "John L."}

Have watched Chris Cosentino make delightful meals on TV and now my family and I actually experienced it in person.  We took the CalTrain from the South Bay and arrived early...had drinks at the bar (the bartender did NOT disappoint).  Staff and waiters (we actually were served by the bartender's hubby...how fantastic is that??) were exceptionally helpful, polite, and wonderful...really made our first time here so memorable.  We started with oysters, pickled sardines and bruschetta...DELICIOUS!!  Our main course was the Wood Oven Roasted Pig's Head and Bacon Chop...Oh my...words can not explain how delightful that was!  Ended with a delicious chocolate dessert and coffee/espresso.  Not only was the food scrumptious and the staff friendly, but Chris was so welcoming and even took some time to talk with us and take a quick photo.  BEST Christmas ever!!  We will definitely eat at Cockscomb again...really want to try the Pin Bone Steak next time (will have to come with more people).  Thank you Chris and staff.", "author": "Mary G."}
