Even today, with the influx of some new businesses further east on Haight St, the Grind is still one of the only places that is reliable for all your coffee, tea, and breakfast needs. \n\nAs a vegan, there is unfortunately not a whole lot of options at your disposal. However, you can find a tofu scramble, some hummus and bagel type offerings, as well as soy and almond milk on the menu. I believe they also occasionally have some vegan baked good selections, although I didn't see any last time I was there.\n\nAlthough the vegan options aren't stellar, it's about on par with most of the rest of the neighborhood (or even SF, for that matter.) But I personally really appreciate that they have a large selection of teas. For some reason, it's rather difficult to find hot tea offerings in the area. Most of the cafes in the neighborhood tend to be very coffee centric. The Grind carries Mighty Leaf and have all of your staple varieties (plus a little more.)\n\nFinally, the Grind is a place you actually want to hang out at and spend a little bit of your morning and afternoon. The staff is friendly and they have a good amount of seating both indoors and out. If outdoors, you get the bonus of people/bike watching on Haight St.", "author": "Jon T."}

I guess three visits makes me both a local and a regular. \n\nI would argue that a true Sunday requires three key ingredients: cheap mimosas, delicious brunch foods (though I could eat brunch daily), and happy people. The grind has the perfect trifecta. \n\nA plate of almost anything tends to come in at around $11 and the mimosas are about a fiver. I've had the scramble a few times and it's huge, at least, by my standards. The Benedict was grand, although my memory for how good is poor. I'm pretty sure I enjoyed it. I have decided next time that I'll pass on the homefries, since I just can't ever get through all that food. If you're a hungry one, know that you'll be fed. And fed.\n\nThe inside-outside seating is a good vantage point for looking at cute neighbourhood dogs (and their owners, I guess) and I've seen plenty of cool characters walking by.

Spousal-Unit ordered the steak and eggs, medium rare. Counter-girl repeated \"medium rare\" and Spousal-Unit repeated \"medium rare.\"  I asked for a burger. \n\nThe food came out within a reasonable period. \n\nMy burger was really good. Spousal-Unit's steak was small, but not a bad deal at $13.50. He took a small bite of it. Then he cut and offered a bite to me as he was still chewing. I took the bite he proffered. As we were chewing it, we looked at each other...\n\n\"Is this medium rare?\" I asked. I then looked at the steak and saw it was clearly past medium-rare into medium / medium-well territory. Still good, but clearly not what he asked for. So, after a little hemming and hawing, we settled on returning it. \"Don't feel bad. It's not what you ordered. Send it back.\"\n\nSpousal-Unit took steak up to the counter. He went up to the bearded-hipster-barista, the only person who didn't have a line of people in front of him. \n\nBearded-hipster-barista first disputed that the steak was improperly cooked. After losing that round, bearded-hipster-barista claimed spousal-unit ate too much of the steak - that it was \"half gone\" and he couldn't possibly have it remade. \n\n(in case you lost count - Spousal-Unit had one bite and I had one bite - \"half gone\" would mean a steak that lasted four bites, right?)\n\nAfter several seconds of angry glaring, bearded-hipster-barista finally relents and says they will remake the steak. \n\nSteak came out ten minutes later. The new one was about 25% bigger and perfectly cooked. \n\nWe were not upset about the original screw up. Anybody can overcook a steak. The steak they gave us was small, and small steaks are *easy* to overcook. We don't blame the cooking staff. \n\nBut what really RUINS A MEAL is getting attitude from waitstaff for making a complaint. It's hard enough to start that conversation. Nobody wants to be that guy who says some variant of \"hey, you did this wrong.\" I think it's worse to say it than to be told it. \n\nSo, already one point down, and then we get some really stinky attitude and it's just impossible to appreciate the rest of our meal. God knows we tried. The food was good. But we just couldn't shake the after effects of what should have been a conversation but was, instead, a confrontation. \n\nWe're both iffy on ever going back.", "author": "Tim W."}

When I got my coffee I nearly spit it out. It was so gross, sour, yet bitter. And it nearly costed me ten dollars. I wasn't about to throw my money down the drain so I went up hoping that they would trade it in for a different one. With some eye movements from the barista, they changed it out for one with less expresso. (Hence that is why I gave them a two star and not a one) But when I got the second coffee it nearly tasted the exact same! Their coffee is just horrible and tastes burnt. So-- I then took the loss and didn't drink it. When my\nBreakfast burrito came I was quickly disappointed. Although everything that was in it was explained on the menu, no where did it state that is an extremely spicy burrito. \"Salsa\" does not mean spicy. This burrito was just almost intolerable. Then it just got worse the more I ate it. The cheese in it tastes like the cheese you would spray out of a can. The sour creme was hot and runny. The eggs had no salt and tasted like the kind you would get in a subway breakfast sandwich. Everything in this burrito was god awful. How do you mess up an egg burrito? Even the sausage was gross and too big for the burrito. I had to pick them out. And I'm not even a picky eater. This place made me feel like I was when in reality everything was just so gross.

I understand the restaurant does not have waiter service, so by slow I mean the lines always seem to be long, and it takes a longer time for food to come out than most places I am used to. This is especially true during weekends and lunch time, obviously (I have never been here in the morning).\n\nI get it; they are always super busy. And there are very few brunch options in the area.

The Grind has been my reliable, go-to spot for the last 5 years since moving to SF (it certainly helps practically living upstairs).  When I was working, I'd stop in more frequently for coffee on my way out. It's usually the first meal I eat after returning from any vacation and not having food in the fridge.  I even find myself coming here after I've gone grocery shopping and unpacked the massive load of food (in efforts to reduce my eating out habits) and not having the energy to cook. \n\nFaves on the menu --  all breakfast items (though I usually end up with a scram), the pear salad with tuna, the eggplant sandwich, the Reuben. One roommate loves the bfast burritos. \n\nLines can get a bit long on the weekends, but if you order to go or just want a quick coffee/drink, they now have a 2nd register closer to the kitchen where you can bypass the line.", "author": "Shahrzad K."}

Who cares that we were hungover from the night before?  Obviously what we needed was some champagne in our veins to brighten our spirits.  Unfortunately, after the aforementioned mimosas were gone, we realized that what we *really* needed was brunch -- and it had better be close, because there was no way that we were going to stumble through San Francisco traffic in our tragic state.\n\nThe easiest thing to do was walk down the block to the Grind, which is an absolutely charming cafe where hippies and yuppies alike can nosh on hearty casual fare.\n\nWhat could be more San Francisco than that?\n\nAnywho, after placing our order at the counter, we sat down on the comfy patio, which is a prime spot for people-watching.  I'm partial to the guy with the face tattoos who had an uncanny resemblance to the dalmatian that he was walking.\n\nOh right -- the food!  Can't forget about that.  I had a chicken pesto sandwich, which was absolutely superb!  It was so light and flavorful and full of herb-y flavor (and even though it is SF, I'm not talking about *that* kind of herb).  The salad was a perfect side, though I would've opted for the fries if I hadn't felt so guilty about the mimosas.\n\nMy brunch companion opted for the veggie scramble, which looked totally magnificent -- and huge!  This was enough food for 2, methinks.  Perhaps the only complaint was a lack of spice on the eggs.  Nothing that a little salt and pepper couldn't fix.\n\nThe service here was fabulous too.  Our food was in front of us mere minutes after placing our orders.  Water glasses were topped off all the time.  Love the attention that we received here.\n\nIn sum: I heart the Grind, almost as much as I heart getting toasted on mimosas.", "author": "David G."}

We thought the popularity of this place was an attestant to the quality of food, but we were wrong. \n\nAfter a long wait and an order, we got our coffees and found an empty table. We waited... and waited... and waited, until we finally got our food. By then, our normal ceramic cups of coffee were almost gone. Free refills? Nope. $.50 cent refills. What breakfast spots charges $.50 cent refills on coffee? Apparently this one. \n\nThe food presentation is as bland as it gets. Rectangle omelette, rectangle serving of hash browns, english muffin. No sprig of parsley or anything to visually enhance the plate. Pancakes, fried eggs, home fries, and again, no thought to presentation.\n\nOk, now to the food, because hey, it's brunch, and we are too tired to really care much about the wait and presentation. Omelette was ok, nothing spectacular. Had avocado and bacon, and a hint of cheese. Overpowered by avocado, but if you love avocado, then you'll like this omelette. English muffin was barely toasted. More like warmed up. Hash browns were standard greasy fare. \n\nEggs were ordered over-medium, but came out soft. Fine. Ham was actually good, so no complaints there. Home fries were hard and bland. Pancakes were the worst pancakes I've ever had at a restaurant. Do NOT order the pancakes. They are like rubber frisbees, but probably taste worse than an actual frisbee.

Some items are better than others. For example, you get a potato option with a few items, always get the home fries (otherwise you get french fries or unimpressive hash browns). The homefries are real chopped potatoes with some veggies! The omelets and scram dishes are yummy! I love the Haight Scram. The egg sandwich is surprisingly good too (choose the english muffin as your bread and see). If you like a sweet breakfast, treat yourself with the croissant french toast!\n\nCoffee is basic and good - they also have great smoothies. Overall, a nice place. It can get super busy, with a line going out the door. I always have a moment where I freak out and think I won't get a seat by the time I order, but that's yet to happen. Sometimes I come alone and bring a book to read while I finish my coffee, great place to do this :)\n\nI think you  may be able to fit up to a group of 6 here, if you squish some tables together - just keep in mind you order at the counter.", "author": "Eli P."}

Based solely on the food I would only give them a two or three star rating.  I had the BBQ Bacon Burger and it was OK and not very big.  My wife had the Turkey Burger and I would say the same thing.  Neither were very juicy or had great flavor either.  I got mine with the Garlic Fries, while my wife had the Spicy Curly Fries.  I think the Spicy Curly Fries are much better.  The Garlic Fries are small, matchstick fries which aren't bad, just nothing very special.  Because the fries are so small they don't do a very good job or holding the garlic seasoning.\n\nSo, why did I give them three stars?

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2011-12-08", "description": "I came here for brunch with a friend after a lazy early morning. Walking in, we checked out the menu on the board on the wall. I ordered the oatmeal with mixed fruit and my friend ordered the Belgian waffle and bacon. We just got waters from the self-serve dispenser and went outside to the covered patio area to wait for our food. \n\nThe inside has a really laid-back and airy feel about it. For a Wednesday at around 10:30am, this place was pretty busy. There were friends grabbing food with a group, smaller meetings of people, and people doing work on their laptops. I loved the atmosphere of this place because it was busy, but not crowded and loud.\n\nAbout 5-10 minutes later, a guy brought our food out. My oatmeal was a good-sized helping -- enough to finish, but still satisfying. Slightly disappointed by the amount and selection of fruit (slivers of strawberries lining the edge of the bowl and about half a banana's worth of slices on top of my oatmeal), but it added a good, healthy sweetness to it. Normally, I don't go out to breakfast and order oatmeal (it's cheap and easy to make at home), but I was felt like being healthy that day. My friend's waffle was about average-sized for a Belgian. It came with three slices of thick-cut bacon and a mini-pitcher of syrup. I tried a small bite of the waffle and it was pretty good.\n\nWe bussed our own table and were off for the rest of our day. I'd come back here because the prices were reasonable, the staff was friendly, and the food was pretty good (although not amazing). A solid place. If I lived closer, I would probably choose to study here.", "author": "Leana L."}

Their menu is enormous, and the lunch and dinner sandwiches are pretty good, but breakfast at The Grind is really where it's at. The omelettes are totally delicious, and I take my eggs very seriously. Excellent toast and I love the hash browns, too (but not so much the home fries). Great bagels, smoothies, they have beer...the list goes on and on and on. Oh, and the staff is really friendly, too.\n\nI should temper my enthusiasm with a disclaimer that I'm very biased; their breakfast is perfect for me, for the way that I like breakfast, which is very very hearty. If you're way into baked goods, then you can do a lot better, and i didn't eat enough eggs cooked any other way but scrambled or in omelette form to have a strong opinion on different preparations. I usually got a Denver omelette or something similar, with hash browns and a bagel, and this breakfast was spot-on for me!\n\nIt would merit five stars if it had better lunch which, again, is perfectly fine but not exceptional. Other than that, I'm not huge on their coffee, and I got totally spoiled on fresh-squeezed orange juice in SF so I wish they had that, too.

Quick service, strong cold brew and house coffee, provide soy milk with no extra fee, omelette variety is great and I have had 2 which have been delicious. The Sicilian is a must (pesto and sun dried tomatoes). They offer mimosa for $4 a glass and I was introduced to a new style mixed with a splash of lemonade. They have a cute front patio to catch a nice breeze or people watch down the busy haight street. I live in the neighborhood as well and can say parking is typically pretty easy to find.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-02-09", "description": "Let's start with the premise that you want some good food close by in the Lower Haight - lunch, brunch, or an early dinner - or just a coffee, tea, or smoothie. This is a place that does all of them well, in a neighborhood where most people want them sometimes, and sometimes many people want them at the same time. The result is: not enough space during peak times. Just remember that all the tables close together, inside and out, are necessary. You'll appreciate them more if you have to wait. In general though, people don't dawdle too much after they've finished and it's really busy. \n\nJust so you know: Order at the register, go up your drinks from the counter, and eventually bus your table...*but* you'll have food brought to the table thanks to the little numbered sign. \n\nTheir breakfast burrito is big and darn good. Really enjoyed the omelette too. Good-sized portions for all plates, whether or not you're hung over. Good coffee and DIY water. OJ was fine. I've also had the jungle juice smoothie, which is a solid green but has a fruity-banana flavor - it's excellent. \n\nIf you need wireless, be warned that it can be slow with several users at once. Just play nicely (be considerate of your usage) and everyone should get along fine.", "author": "Mike H."}

(Are you following?)  So what else to do on a \"Friday night\" but go grab a bite on the town.  By town I mean an emerging from slumber, cloudy San Francisco.  By bite I mean breakfast, naturally.\n\nThere was a sports bar I wanted to check out for some NFL action in the area, so luckily I also came across The Grind Cafe to get my fill ahead of time.  This place is a hub of activity on a Sunday morning.  Families with their kids, students with their notebooks, young adults knocking out the cobwebs, SFPD officers on their break and guys like me just looking for something new.  A patchwork of people coexisting in a big city.\n\nThis is one of those places where you pay in advance and then they bring you your food.  You might want to study the menu ahead of time.  It's vast and you can feel rushed trying to decide what to get at the counter with a steady line of folks behind you.\n\nI went with the croissant french toast, a couple of scrambled eggs and a glass of apple juice.  The juice seemed natural with that darker, cloudier look rather than that pretty almost clear stuff you get in a bottle at Safeway.  Eggs cooked to perfection, though I could have used some shredded cheese on top.  French toast was a couple of big croissants sliced in two and cooked in the classic batter.  All very good.  It's not too cheap but you can get what you need with less than $20 in your pocket.\n\nI'd definitely come back here and try some other stuff on the menu.  Friendly service and a definite neighborhood feel.  Plenty of tv's tuned to NFL pre-game show too, so that's always a plus.", "author": "Bennett L."}

After a few minutes looking over the huge menu, we went for breakfast dishes. He had the corned beef hash with hash browns and I had the veggie scramble with home fries. The veggie scramble was made with mushrooms, onions, and tomatoes and covered in melted cheddar cheese. I thought it was pretty average, but it was nothing special -  did the job though! The boy liked his corned beef hash but wished that he had gone with the home fries, which were really delicious! \n\nOverall, I would definitely come here again.

Every once and a while they might forget something on my order but are always quick to fix it.  They also don't get mad when I order specialized coffee drinks from the bar.  Very accommodating.  Just keep in mind it might be crazy on the weekend, especially for brunch, and you might have to wait in line and wait for a table, but that certainly doesn't keep me from coming back.", "author": "Lauren B."}

So it's a nice meeting place to go with friends, with some fabulous covered outdoor seating incorporated into the front of the restaurant, which is very pleasant.\n\nThe Grind was recently renovated, and so the flooring, etc. are all new.  I'm not sure, but I think they also repainted, and replaced some of the seating.  Generally speaking, though, it's a pleasant atmosphere, with a lot of natural light pouring in from that front porch.\n\nOverall, there's nothing special about the menu here or the food in general...but it's clean environment, always has a table available when I go there, so I am happy to continue to give this place my business.", "author": "Amy L."}

I don't drink coffee. \n\nNow, moving on to what's important... FOOD.\n\nI ate breakfast here twice in the two days I was in town. Day one, I got the breakfast sandwich (egg, sausage & cheese on a croissant) which you can pretty much customize to have whatever you want. That's pretty hard to mess up since it's got exactly what you want on it but it was quite tasty. The hash browns are also quite yummy.\n\nSecond day, I had the Grind Combo (I believe that's what it's called), and although it wasn't a fancy order at all, everything was quite tasty. The french toast was quite good, which is impressive because I think most places overdo it with the egg then cover them in powdered sugar like we're at Cafe du Monde or something. This place did them quite nicely. The country potatoes were also good. \n\nI also must say this about the staff; they are really nice. They may be granola-crunching hippies (let's face it, they're everywhere around here) but they were super sweet and very quick with the drinks and the food.", "author": "Edgar S."}

I was there this morning with my friend who has a small service dog. We were sitting on the patio portion with the dog when a woman who works there came out and told him the dog had to leave. He said he is a service dog and she said he still had to go. My friend pointed that it is illegal for them to not let him have his service animal with him. The woman claimed that it didn't matter and because of the health code. They calmly went back and forth over it again and again until she got mad and walked away. He pointed out that the sign they have hung up even says service dogs are ok, but she wouldn't come back out of the restaurant to look at the sign.

Rather than being impatient, awkward or otherwise inappropriate, the staff here are pleasant, normal and manage to do their part to make every interaction as seamless as possible.  They act like it's the most natural thing in the world to watch someone write down their order or point to it on the paper menu simply because the person can't verbalize the order. \n\nNow, perhaps your thinking c'mon, who would be rude to someone with obvious speech difficulties?  Or mobility issues?  Or pragmatics and weird eye movement problems?  Sadly, the answer is: plenty of people!

I met my friend here today for brunch and ordered a chicken ceasar salad. We were waiting for a little bit, probably 7 to 10 which is normal, then her food came. I was still waiting for mine. I gave them another few minutes and still nada. I don't want to be a jerk, but how hard it is to make a salad? Even Toby Young would agree with me. A salad that takes more than 20 minutes to make has to be a fuckin good gourmet salad. This is just a regular chicken ceasar, nothing gourmet about it nor it is made with liquid nitrogen and other fancy shit. \n\nSo I came to the counter and asked the girl who took my order to check on it, and she just brushed me off. She said they were busy and told me to wait for another couple minutes. I don't have a problem with being a little patient. I'm not one of those assholes who need to get what they want right that second, but the fact that she didn't even take the time to go to the kitchen and checked real quick, that what turned me off the most. I have worked at a restaurant before and I still work in customer service business. Following through a customer's concern is just one of the things you should've known! It's not that hard to take 5 steps to the kitchen and asked the Cook. If you're busy, ask your co-worker to do so. Come one people, am I the only one with common sense?\n\nSure enough, after I had waited for another 10 minutes, my food still hasn't come. My friend almost finished with her food, and I just lost my appetite. I came back to the counter and just asked for my money back. Of course, they were just busy trying to figure out what happened.

My co workers and I would usually call an order in expecting it to be ready when they say \"see you in 15 mins\", and usually it is. There is no \"pick up only\" counter but usually the guys behind it would say \"pick up? I can ring you up\".\nExcept these (Daria looking - described by another reviewer) girls behind the cashier who doesn't grasp the concept of calling orders in. I asked to pick up an order I called in 15 mins prior , she huffed at me and said ... \"I guess i can squeeze you in\".  Confronted with this attitude, I repeated that I was just picking up but she rather have me wait in line, while people in front of me took their sweet time picking what they want from the menu asking her recommendations. Really ... ring me up while they choose between white or wheat! \n10 mins later ... Hot pastrami turned into cold cuts, hot soup into gazpacho and crispy fries into mashed potatoes. \n\"Thanks for waiting\" she says ...

A very good cup of coffee with just the right amount of greasy breakfast. I had the Grind scramble with house fries ( little roasty tubers) and wheat toast. The scramble was artfully bound by 2 pieces of american cheese which turn it into an egg, cheese meat burger.

We got fast service (the line moved fast, that is, and the food came out fast) and the place was clean and inviting, but the food was mediocre at best- we got Joe's scramble and a breakfast burrito.  Neither had a lot of flavor- the burrito only had what little spice comes in the chorizo, and Joe's scramble was topped with two slices of what looked like Kraft american cheese.  We're not crazy cheese snobs, but the cheese squares melted on top of the scramble looked like something for a child's menu.

I stood and watched poker on their flat screen (yeah, no playoff game. It's THAT kind of place).\n\nthe sandwich was pretty tasty. The fries were ok, but they stuck a pickle into the box which dripped all over the fries. I gotta say, pickle juice on french fries is fucking gross. It makes the fries taste like they were rotten.

This could be quite the adventure when the place is busy.\n\nNo more since they redesigned the place.  Along with the new look is better cooking and a much better attitude.

Not that I notice since I am taken and everything.\n\nThe menu has not changed much since the bad old days but there is much greater attention to detail.  There is now table service.  The omelets and scrambles are piping hot and everything seems fresh.  It used to be that you had to come in before nine AM on the weekends to beat the influx of Castro interior designers who would take over the place at ten or so.  May I use your chair?

I give them that credit. And I'm not really sure how to solve the waiting time because the kitchen doesn't look big enough for a couple extra prep cooks. Any breakfast joint has a bit of a wait on the weekends. I guess the only alternative is to not go during brunch time. Maybe its my elitist \"i only live 3 doors down i should'nt have to wait for this shit\" attitude that I need to flip. Hehe.\n\nThe food IS decent. But I feel like 7 times out of ten my order is missing some ingredient like avocado, or the cheese in my omelette is barely melted; its the little things that add up, you know? I know they're in a rush to complete the order but hey, I pay attention to avocado. That's why I order it.

Very filling.\n\nI think that with the makeover they made some changes I don't necessarily like all that much.

It's not bad, and it's presented really beautifully, but on your walk home, you always find yourself wondering whether you should start spending less time here and more time at a grungier-looking restaurant that understands your needs better.\n\nBut hell, I'm a sucker for a pretty face, so I'll keep enjoying The Grind's mound of hash browns and a sunny-side-up egg.

Bland, overpriced food.  The kicker?  There was a group of probably drunk girls next to our table who let their dog walk all over the table and drink from their cups.  No one from the grind said anything to them.  Really appetizing.  I saw a brilliant bumper sticker recently:  \"Dog people are the new crazy cat ladies.\"  Couldn't agree more.\n\nUpdate (5/28/09)\n\nI am taking away an additional star because against my better instincts, I recently went there again.

I was stoked for the idea of a divey, nasty, greasy spoon with an assertive, short-tempered wait staff that had been working there for a decade.\n\nSo I approach the place from the west, slowly, sizing it up; looks alright, so far. I see hipsters and students and art kids smoking on the patio. This is usually a good sign, at least for my tastes and general comfort level.\n\nOnce inside, however, surprise! Exposed duct work, track lighting and the ubiquitous gigantic fucking chalk board menu. The offerings looked good, though, so I chose to forgive them and let bygones be bygones while some coked out dude started yammering at my friend.\n\nI ordered the two eggs, scram, with hash and subbed an English muffin  for the toast. I also split a short stack with my friend. For a drink, \"Orange juice, and lots of it, please.\" The wait staff was perky, chipper and did not at all look amused... or hungover. This was a problem.\n\nBut the food was good. Really good, actually, and the short stack reminded me of home, so damn that's gotta be worth at least one star... and the eggs were yummy and there was ample hot sauce at the table (although just Tabasco... when will people get it right? ANYTHING but Tabasco!), and pretty soon I was happy and full, and I didn't have to give up 30 minutes sitting on the curb waiting for a table (that's you, Porkstore... that's what you sound like).\n\nSo, damnit, a reluctant 3... but well earned.

Popped in and checked out the menu. I had been thinking I might get a burger, as they use Niman Ranch beef. But then I noticed a \"Crispy Chicken\" sandwich on the menu. Described as a fried chicken breast on a bun with lettuce and mayo. $7.50 with fries.\n\nI grabbed a seat and as I waited noticed that they've nicely modernized the cafe's decor. Finally my food was ready and I walked it over to Duboce Park to enjoy in the sunshine.\n\nI was disappointed to find that the chicken sandwich consisted not of a single fried chicken breat, but 3 limply fried, generic, previously frozen chicken fingers. I took a bite hoping to find something worth liking, but the chicken fingers weren't even adequately fried They weren't raw, just not very golden. Limp and pale. Bleh. I ate a few fries which were ok, but decided to ditch the entire meal.\n\nGrabbed a burger at Burger Joint down the street. It's not the greatest burger, but at least I knew what I was getting and it's tastey enough.\n\nI can't vouch for any of the other food at The Grind Cafe, but I definitely wouldn't recommend the crispy chicken sandwich.

And there's nothing more annoying then getting a smoothie that melts while it's in your hands or you can drink in its entirety in 3 minutes.  My first suck from the straw produced a frown and various veins bulging from my forehead.  This smoothie was THICK and JUICY and SWEET and good!  I'm big on drink-to-food ratio so this accompanied my bagel perfectly.  I don't know why I've never had lunch there.  I mean I actually go during lunch and just opt for my bagel.  But if it's any consolation, I've gone with friends who have the audacity to order lunch during lunchtime and it always looks scrumptious.  I feel like I should give 5 stars alone for just the damn bagel, latte, and smoothie.  I mean if a restaurant is making me convulse with those random things then how much more for an actual meal?!  Contrary to other yelpers, I've never had a run in with a snooty cashier or anything like that, thank God.  I'm not one to hold my tongue if someone is giving me attitude for no damn reason.  The service has always been great, albeit a tad slow.  But other than that, I love this place.  It also seems like a great neighborhood hangout with locals.", "author": "Andrea B."}

I did every debaucherous thing I possibly could and took bodily abuse to new levels.  It was fabulous!  At several points, however, I realized that my body needed nourishment.  As different groups of friends suggested eating here, I had the opportunity to dine two days in a row.  Day one saw me and a hot Austrian trying to force our e-xhausted bodies to consume nourishment.  He managed an orange banana smoothie while I was able to choke down the Pear Salad and some coffee.  I have to say that this was a super tasty salad and largely proportioned with a generous side of fresh sourdough.  Best of all, I survived to roll on to the Polk Street Fair!\nDay two saw me roll in after a terribly strung out night after the Polk Street Festival which saw me greet the day at 7:30am before calling it a night.  I ordered the French Burger with fries and found it to be okay but nothing noteworthy.  The french fries were decent but I think it was a poor choice to order this variation of a hamburger as the addition of french bread makes for a heavier meal.  I couldn't finish the other half of my sandwich.\nMy friends who brought me here both days highly endorse the French Dip as being the best in the city.  I'll have to give this place another go-round and find out if that's true.", "author": "Jill D."}

I feel like I am in a San Francisco version of Sex in the City when I'm here with my friends. The only thing I didn't enjoy was my mocha... it wasn't quite as good or chocolate rich as lets say Pete's Coffee or Starbucks. They have a great breakfast menu and all my friends enjoyed the atmosphere and they enjoyed their meals. If I am ever in the area again I'll walk... finding parking took about 5-8 minutes just like everywhere else here. Next time it will be a good walk...", "author": "Evan T."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-06-29", "description": "Wow.  After hearing great things about this place I was seriously disappointed.  I went there for breakfast to find that the prices and quality of the food left much to be desired.  First of all, a breakfast sandwich, egg, meat and cheese will run you $8.  Yes, $8.  You can get a cheap one at Lee's for $2.85 or just about any other place in the city for less than $5.  There is nothing special about the food, average at best, and about 50% overpriced.  There is no reason a coffee and small breakfast should cost over $10, especially in the lower haight.", "author": "Eli Z."}

This was my first time back in SF in almost 10 years and I was very excited to head for the Height section of the city, everyone is so creative and fun.\nWe were driving up towards Ashbury and this place looked so cute and friendly we just had to stop.\nYou go up to the counter and order then find a table on your own and sit. This is normally cool except there were no tables to sit at, for a half an hour. Which didn't matter I guess because we still hadn't been served by then. So we finally find one that has just been abandoned out on the patio and continue to wait another half hour or so for our food. \nI had the French Toast with Hash Browns and a side of scrambled egg, my man had the Corned Beef Hash on Toast. I don't know how long it took altogether about an hour and a half, but for average food this was a really annoying experience. \nThe people were all nice and even fellow customers, it is tiny and it was new years, but come on guys pick up the pace a little!", "author": "Sydney C."}

The staff are lovely, the food is not out of this world but it does the job and sometimes a bit more. I've eaten here a hundred times and maybe only once been disappointed. They do a solid burger and the Grind Combo is a hangover cure from heaven - eggs, sausage or bacon, pancakes or French toast, what's not to like. So the omelets are a bit rubbery but dude this ain't Paris and the portions are grand. And it's big enough that you have a chance of getting breakfast without waiting a lifetime at the weekends.", "author": "mefloquine x."}

It gives me a salad I really like in a location where there are not too many options.  Plus, I always run into people there.  All the salads are good, my favorite being the veggie delight with chicken.  French Dip sandwich is good.  I'm not totally sold on their breakfast.  Omelets are too thin.  Otherwise, I dig the art, I dig the people watching, and the staff is much nicer than they seem once you get to know them.  They kind of have that East Coast roughness, which can rub some San Franciscans the wrong way.", "author": "Michael M."}

Really cool looking on the outside, unsavoriness on the inside. Coffee is average coffeeshop fare, baked goods are REALLY good. But, Im trying to think up the ways to fuck up an iced chai. I ordered a large coffee, and my friend ordered an iced chai. What she got was a HOT chai, with a shot of espresso. o.0 Neither one of us noticed that she put the espresso in, but it was obviously hot. \"Excuse me, she ordered an iced chai.\" The nice girl says, \"No she didnt, she ordered a chai with a shot of espresso.\" I was like...\"I dont know how, but i think you heard her wrong.\" Shes all snottily \"No, i didnt, but ill make another.\" I was like \"Dude, she doesnt even drink coffee, and why would you put a shot of espress..urgh...fine.\" She flipped her hair, and said \"Well, you wanna make sure she doesnt want espresso?\" So i turn 3 degrees to the left. She shakes her head no. Turn back to girl. \"No she doesnt.\" Yikes. Coffee girl rolls eyes and sighs like a teenager at family game night.

The person taking my order rolled her eyes and stated that this is only for kids eight and under and you can not order the Kids Plate.  Age for placing a kids order was not stated on the menu so I bribed her an extra dollar to have a taste of this world famous Kids Menu plus with some extra attitude on the side. She was glade to take the bribe and I soon was sitting with my world famous Kids Plate, but I saw that I did not have my juice box.  Back at the counter I asked on the juice box but the workers said we do not have a jukebox.  I restated the question, but they did not know what a juice box was or what it even looked like.  I did not carry the argument any further because I wanted to get back to my world famous Kids Plate.  It was just like I had dreamed; the fries had the taste of hot oiled paper and the nuggets were shaped like small dinosaurs just like the ones from Costco.  I think I will not order the famous Kids Plate again and just go to Costco and pick me up 1000 pieces of dinosaur and on the way out a hot dog and drink.", "author": "jon f."}
