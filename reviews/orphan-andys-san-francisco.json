I loved all of the stained glass, light fixtures and ceiling decor. This is a quaint diner with limited seating, so expect to wait for a table or bar top if you get there around busy hours. 2 of the 3 staff we encountered were lovely. The third must have been having a bad day or tired because she was very grumpy. We witnessed her behavior while we were waiting in line -when she asked us to move a few times - but otherwise didn't see her again after we had been seated.\nWe sat at the bar stools closest to the kitchen and ordered almost immediately after sitting down. Our server was nice, helpful and quick to get our drinks and waters. He even made the malted chocolate shake we ordered himself.\n\nWhat we ordered:\nFish and chips - they were decent but were overall a poor value compared to the combo options with steak and shrimp. My boyfriend wished he had gotten a combo instead.\nMozzarella sticks - great! Order these!!\nPatty melt - really good. Unlike many diner patty melt's, the hamburger portion was huge and it really tasted homemade. I would replace the cheese with American next time, but otherwise it was tasty.\nChili - it came with raw onions and cheese on top which was a nice touch. The chili itself was good but needed a few drops of hot sauce to bring it good flavor.\nFries - good and crunchy.\nMalted chocolate shake - amazing! Highly recommend.\n\nA lot of menu items looked and sounded great, and we will return to try them! So great to know that Orphan Andy's is always open after a long flight, a night out, or just because.", "author": "Bri T."}

Both times the food has been decent, exactly what you would expect from a diner-ish place.  The portions are huge which most would consider a great deal for the price. However, they do not have too many healthy options. \n\nWe have tried the Big 2 (bacon, sausage, pancakes) and it was good. The pancakes are quite large and you can get chicken sausage and egg whites as a substitute which is a plus.  We have also tried the sloppy joe omelet (I know, but I just had to) which was decent but I do not see myself ordering it again.  It was a big sweet and was just sloppy joe meat topped with scrambled eggs. I preferred just eating the meat on the toast without the eggs (guess I should have just gotten a sloppy joe).\n\nThey are open 24/7 which is a plus if you happen to be hungry at odd hours.  We have only come for breakfast and the service here both times was very slow. It is a small place so I am assuming the kitchen must be just as small. The servers are always nice, just might not want to go here if you are in a hurry.  We have sat at the bar and at a table and the food takes equally as long to get to you.\n\nWe will definitely be back when we are in the mood for big breakfasts and possibly again to try the burgers that everyone posts on yelp.", "author": "Danielle B."}

Although it is not for me, it may suit you just fine.\n\nAt $13.75 the Grilled Chicken Breast on a Sourdough French Roll did not meet my expectations in any way whatsoever. Generally speaking when I order a grilled chicken breast sandwich it is one of the healthier choices on a menu, not here.\n\nAccompanied by a mountain of their signature potato salad, I found the sandwich almost inedible.  With just the sight of it I could imagine my arteries clogging. The chicken breast was very, very greasy and tasted somewhat gamey. The French Roll appeared as though someone drenched it with grease or butter.  Its desirability plummeted even further when I discovered the soggy roll was heavily coated with mayonnaise as well.

However, I had three big issues with it when I went last weekend.\n\nFirst, I was really frustrated with the pricing of an omelette I ordered. I ordered an egg-white omelette ($9.50) with some chicken. Turns out I was charged $10.75 for some chicken in my omelet. That was more expansive than the omelette itself! How is that possible and why did I not get a warning about this? \"Hey, by the way, that side you're adding to your omelette will literally double the price.\" Nope didn't get that. Even Chipotle warns you when you get guac, and that's only $2.50! I was told it's because it's considered an entire chicken breast on the side (which it wasn't even that much chicken.) But even so, who charged that much for a piece of chicken?\n\nSecond, we were seated at the bar initially and wanted to switch over to a regular table seat once it become available. We were told we couldn't do so because they were \"technically\" separate restaurants, which of course doesn't make sense. What he really meant was - if you switch to tables, I won't get my tip.

Including lots of sweet options and even a \"healthier meals\" section as well!!\n\nWe mainly ate here at breakfast time before kicking on with the day. Their three egg omelettes are amazing!! They're huge and delicious. The fillings are also quite generous and tasting fresh. On another note you have a choice of an included side of either hot cakes (AKA pancakes) or toast with fries. Had hot cakes each time and the amount of food put in-front of you, you will have a surprise reaction!! The hot cakes are like a whole another meal in themselves.... which you also receive fountain maple syrup. \n\nWe've also had the fresh toast for something sweeter later in the night. And was just as delicious!! Once again was generous and cooked amazingly. Very soft and sweet and well satisfying. \n\nTruly love this place. The staff are very friendly and sometimes quite entertaining. There is also a jukebox in the corner to request your favourite songs. The only downfall about the place is it's a very small space with limited booths, so if it's busy you may have to wait in a queue to be seated, unless there's space at the bar.

At some point in your life, you should definitely wind up at Orphan Andy's, and take in one of the last bastion's of un-gentrified, un-filtered, crazy San Francisco. Get packed into a tiny room with all manner of eccentrics, kooks, and drug fiends. The food is authentic greasy spoon, and the breakfast is delicious, thanks to unspeakable volumes of butter. Don't come here looking for an artisanal burger or seeking a pristine lettuce experience. The staff is tired, from having their compassion tested on a daily basis, but they're all genuine sweethearts. The only thing preventing 5 stars is that it's worn and a little dirty, as all busy 24/7 diners tend to be.", "author": "Gregory F."}

Very reminiscent of a New York diner, with a little bit more sass. Nice owner who was present and very attentive, and really great service from the rest of the staff. We were there for about an hour and saw them constantly busy tidying, prepping and taking care of customers. Clearly a small and efficient business with people who work there to give great service.\n\nSeats about 40 people, maybe. Mostly in booths plus an additional 10 seats at the counter. Menu is pretty broad and diner-tastic, and food came out really quickly. We had a couple versions of grilled cheese, a turkey club, and the tuna melt. All really great classic fare. Highly recommend the tuna melt...no funny business in the tuna salad (ugh: relish is the worst)... just good old-fashioned tuna, mayonnaise and celery.\n\nGreat Yelp find and we will definitely be back.", "author": "Shannon E."}

With that freedom there were several areas I wanted to see for the first time. Among them was the Castro District.\n\nMy friend and I took the Muni streetcar from downtown to the end of Mission. By the time we got there it was already late morning and we were both hungry. We saw Orphan Andy's as soon as we got off the Muni but we wanted to walk the main section of Castro Street before deciding on a place to eat. Frankly I was surprised how few there are.\n\nSo we headed back to where we started. Orphan Andy's serves breakfast all day and by now it was after traditional breakfast time.\n\nTheir menu is pretty stock, not much in the way of specialties and nothing at all that couldn't be found in any breakfast diner in America.\n\nI opted for French Toast stuffed with cream cheese and apple compote, dusted with powdered sugar.\u00a0 Since I'm a meat-eater I ordered a side of sausage links.\u00a0 While there's not a lot to say about the French Toast other than it was good, it was hard for me not to notice the size and thickness of the sausages.\u00a0 I imagine they must be a very popular menu item. I actually imagined a lot of things about them, not overlooking in any way that there were four of them, all equally huge, meaty and juicy. And tasty ... especially tasty.\n\nI was convinced I couldn't handle them all but we were in no hurry and after relaxing for a while I managed to stuff them all in.\n\nWe were serviced well, friendly and with a smile and I had all I could drink.\n\nThe cost was just slightly on the high side but I don't mind paying if I'm satisfied.\u00a0 I'm ready to come again.", "author": "Todd H."}

Found the place had not change all the same as usual the food really good and plentiful but the service was very bad. After I arrive the young waiter kept going by me totally ignoring me so he could go and chat with his friends or tricks he was trying to pick up. Finally the older gentleman came and ask if the other waiter had waited on me and I said no he been ignoring me, this waiter did take my order and he was very pleasant, to be honest for the 45 minutes I was the the only one working was the older gentleman the young guy was way to busy trying to pick up tricks. I did not know you could pick up a hustler pretending to be a waiter at the restaurant with or without ordering a meal. This is the first time I saw such disrespect to customers that I saw today by the younger waiter he needs to be terminated and they hire another down to earth waiter like the older gentleman.", "author": "Dennis C."}

In the past, the staff have been friendly and accommodating to any substitutions to orders (and the menu clearly states substitutions means adding $1 to an order).\n\nBased on this experience, I was looking forward to my preferred meal, indicating it to the person taking my order. \n\nThe service has gone RIDICULOUSLY DOWNHILL. Why? Because apparently substituting a *tomato* in place of some *fruit garnish* is a crime against humanity. \n\nI explained to the server I've done this a few times (it was even suggested to me by a server the first time!!!). The server insisted that this was impossible and asked me to name names. LOL, as if I'd know. \n\nI looked at her, confused, wondering what on earth could be worth arguing over a tomato, for goodness sake. \n\nOH, AND WHAT NEXT? WHY THE TERRIBLE REVIEW?\n\nThis, um, INCREDIBLE person called me a LIAR over a TOMATO!!! Yep, you read that right! \"It's your word against mine\" to be specific. Beyond offended, I got up and immediately left, my desire to eat or bring my business had dissolved. \n\nWhy on earth would I want to give money to a restaurant that treats its customers like this? Ridiculous and offensive. LOL, and just so STUPID. STUPID, jaw-dropping, MIND BLOWING loss of business. OVER A TOMATO.\n\nUnles you enjoy absurd, power tripping servers who're ready to die over a $1 or a tomato, vs. say, losing a neighborhood customer ready to purchase an $18 dollar meal, be wary of eating here.  \n\nDon't be surprised if you're told ketchup doesn't come with french fries because some insane lady decides you're lying about all those times you ate something which she just can't believe ever happened.\n\nSHE CALLED ME A LIAR OVER A TOMATO. You can't make this stuff up. I'll never visit this establishment again... unless there's ***anyone ELSE*** serving that isn't a tomato Nazi!!! Then again, I'd bet 1000 fruit garnishes that this Tomato Nazi is the owner and is eagerly yelling at her staff as I write this so as to make clear: NO TOMATOS EVAR. Wow. Just.

Most of my meals there have been lunches and breakfasts, so I'm can't comment on their dinner offerings. Portions tend to be rather large, so I often have to take a \"doggy bag\" home for later consumption.\n\nOrphan Andy's is often quite busy, but the noise level is not obnoxiously high even when the place is full. Prices at this restaurant have risen quite a bit during the past several years, thanks to the influx of high-paid techies into the city, but are not at all outrageous.\n\nMy favorite dishes? Meatloaf. Biscuits & Gravy. Tuna Melt Sandwich.", "author": "Clayton L."}

I mainly love the sausages they made for us, it had a nice spicy kick to it. \n\nIf I got no where to go at 4am and need some breakfast I'll probably drop in here.

Waited by the door 10 minutes before any of the servers acknowledged us. When finally seated we ordered a veggie burger (no vegan option on the menu at all) and a meatloaf.

When we got our food my fries were lukewarm and I have very little good to say about the veggie patty) . My friend's meatloaf came with chicken soup (he said it was good with plenty of veggies and chicken); his meatloaf was also nice but it came with a rather disgusting biscuit; a below average potato mash and runner beans which looked straight out of a can and cooked for hours.

The attitudes in this place are ATROCIOUS! On Sunday night November 1st at around 10pm, my friends and I ran into this shanty for a quick bite to eat. We were not at all drunk but we were giggling and having a great time talking. We were told by our waiter that were too loud and of course, we obliged to this request by lowering our voices and  keeping it down. \n\nAbout 20 min later, our waiter, who started to become increasingly nasty over basic interactions such as \"Can we have more fries\" came over to our table, picked up our food, asked us to \"Look At This\" (to which we had no idea what was going on) and then threw our food in the trash! FURTHERMORE he demanded for us to pay and threatened to call the cops if we did not. I understand if he wanted us to leave, that is his right and his prerogative, but he could have simply given us boxes, presented us with the check and sent us on our way.... but randomly THROWING AWAY OUR FOOD AND DEMANDING WE PAY FOR IT? Thats taking it to a level of disrespect that just doesn't need nor should ever be crossed. \n\nQuite frankly I think the man has some pre connived prejudices, and needs to find another line of work.

I ordered a hot chocolate with whipped cream and chocolate syrup (delicious!) to warm me up, and a Hawaiian Cream Cheese burger. The burger sounds weird right? I thought so too, which is why I wanted to try it. \n\nBasically, instead of regular cheese, they give you cream cheese and the sliced pineapple gives the burger its \"Hawaiian\" touch. It comes with the standard lettuce, tomato and onion on the side. Although really heavy and fatty, the cream cheese was unique and the combination of cream cheese and pineapple gave the burger a really sweet, island flavor. I surprisingly liked it. \n\nMy friends ordered the onion rings (yummy but verrry oily - dab with napkin first!) and chili cheese fries for us to share and a country fried steak, hotcakes (or what the rest of us call it: pancakes), and french toast for their entrees. I even ordered a root beer at the end to help me digest all of the food. \n\nWith huge portion sizes, the food was waaaay too much but perfect if you come hungry! Even as hungry and exhausted as we were, we had trouble finishing the food and had leftovers.\n\nLocated in a fun cross-section of the Castro (aka party central with people dancing on the sidewalk!), there's always something going on and people to watch. \n\nAnd as a cherry on top, the Creme Brulee cart is parked right across the street and open until 2:30 AM for a great dessert option! We skipped dessert at Orphan Andy's and opted to get creme brulee instead. Basically, a great way to cap off a great night :).", "author": "Chival N."}

I specifically chose the counter as it is historically known for faster service.  The waiter put his initials on the check, asked me if he could bring me water, I told him I wanted water and chamomile tea.  I got the water.\nI looked over the menu, made a choice, put the menu back, and waited for the waiter to return.\nHe began to sniff the coffee pots and got highly engaged with other patrons.  One told him that he looked like Drew Carey.  He talked with the other waiter behind the counter and they chatted about the relationships they have with their mother.  During this time, the man who washes the dishes was putting the clean dishes and silverware away.\nAt no time was I acknowledged as being there.\nAfter 10 minutes of not being served or spoken to I looked towards the door.  At that moment a man who presented as a woman emerged from the back of the restaurant and said, \"Goodbye boys.\"  The waiter left his post to get a goodbye hug.  As the person was leaving, new people were arriving.\nAt that moment, I left (without a tip for the water).\nThe restaurant was not crowded and the prices were not particularly reasonable.\nThe service was non-existent and I would never return to a venue that has such disregard for its patrons.\n....\n11/2017 \nI returned and ate there twice.

Michael, our server, was rude and condescending for the entirety of our meal. I was mocked for wanting a rootbeer in addition to my coffee, and our server made comments under his breathe (but clearly audible) when we needed additional time to order our food. When we paid for our meal, Michael grabbed our cash and said \"this looks almost correct\" and then proceeded to verify the amount of money on our table table top. Keep in mind, two of us were paying with credit cards and signing our receipts, so no one was rushing out to stiff the bill. When told that he was acting extremely unprofessional, Michael refused to provide his last name or the contact information for the general manager. He continued to engage in a conversation from behind the bar emphasizing, \"look at where you are at. What do you expect.\"", "author": "Stephan F."}

After many visits to this place over the past several months, I'm now convinced that the bitchy, condescending and generally disinterested attitudes of the wait staff (numerously cited in other reviews) is not such a coincidence, but rather an ongoing trait for which they must be proud.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to pass the once-over approval scan by the waiter without being told he's too busy to merely record a take-out order for you, you may possibly be graciously served after a long while standing out in the cold...and maybe not.\n\nNo doubt there's plenty post-night-of-drinking clientele to satisfy the financial appetite of this little beacon of belly-bomb satisfaction so many of us seek late at night.  But if you care at all about patronizing a local establishment with your hard earned money and being treated with respectful gratitude for the honor of that humble patronage, I suggest you go elsewhere.\n\nSparky's 24 Hour Diner is the alternative option just a few blocks away on Church Street just south of Market.\n\nPeace.", "author": "Dana G."}

After another place closed its kitchen, a couple guys on the corner suggested Orphan Andys. \n\nWe walked in wanting some good old H20 and a solid late night dinner (after a long day of venturing around the bay). The guys said we could sit anywhere so we chose the cozy round table by the window. Here's the rundown:\n\nFood: I ordered the turkey club (fries, wheat bread, no mayo), one friend ordered the fish 'n chips, another ordered two eggs with hot cakes, and another just went with a cup of hot cocoa. The hot cocoa came in a metal canister along with a mug and spoon topped with whipped cream -- cute presentation. My friend's eggs and hot cakes were just as expected, and pretty good sized. My other friend devoured his fish 'n chips, which came with a giant helping of tartar sauce on the side. This is a diner, so I didn't expect fresh fish 'n chips, but it was a little weird to see the guy pull the box of breaded fish out from the under-the-counter fridge. My turkey club was pretty good. Turkey meat, crisp (but not too crispy) bacon, fresh tomatoes, lettuce, and onion, all sandwiched between slices of toasted wheat bread. The fries were pretty good. Crunchy exterior, soft interior.\n\nService: The guys that work in this place are really nice (and not too bad on the eyes either...). They took our orders with a smile, delivered our food in a timely manner, and kept our water glasses full.\n\nI wouldn't mind coming back if I wanted something other than pizza late at night in the Castro.", "author": "Leana L."}

Not the hangover \"churning\" but the sickening feeling like your intestines is trying to digest a tub of Crisco. \n\nWe (I) walked into Orphan Andy's heavily inebriated. Wait was 15 minutes for a table. Too drunk to Yelp something, I ordered the Fried Chicken with Pancakes ($12.95) which sounded like a good idea at the time. WORST. IDEA. EVER.\n\nI know you can't expect much from a 24-hour diner but what I got were three pieces of shriveled up pieces of fried chicken that looked more like chicken strips rather than real chicken pieces. I would have taken a picture but I couldn't aim and shoot at the time. The fried chicken was disgustingly overbreaded, overfried, and greasy. I normally inhale my food when I'm drunk but several bites which tasted like a fried batter-dipped sponge made me want to puke so I went for the pancakes. They were mediocre and were on the thick side. Simply put, the food was overpriced, ingredients were low-quality, and execution was poor. \n\nSeriously, I was better off polishing a tub of lard because that's what I felt like afterwards and when I woke up. At least, lard itself has NO carbs. \n\nI can stand inattentive service but what I can't stand is rude, bitter, and condescending service.

We were greeted & seated with smiles =) 3 to be exact; the entire staff at that eerie hour. (and when I say eerie, I mean its QUIET in the 'STRO' whoa). This was a spontaneous 'I NEED BREAKFAST' outing, so the open 24hrs schedule worked for us. Parking at the corner (near Hot Cookie) was easy.\n\nUpon entering, you will step back into time. Its got that retro diner feel for sure. Decor is on point. 'Red light special' - lights are dim and red/maroon-ish leather at every booth. (booths have a 2 person limit btw). At every blink of an eye, you've got Marilyn and Orphan Andy tidbits of art; oh wait there's more - fit the kitchen and the counter/bar into those blinks, too. Music softly plays whatever the manager feels, I guess. (those cute tabletop jukeboxes - just for looks). Not good for groups; its tight in here!\n\nNow time to read about...the FOOD:\n\nWe ordered steak & eggs (added 6 egg whites to please the hubbs obsession), their special side of biscuits & gravy, and stuffed french toast. No coffee, just water. \n\nThe steak was cooked the way we ordered it; medium well. The egg whites were nice & fluffy. Nothing glorious, tho. \n\nBiscuits & gravy - those deserve a 'wittle' bit of glory! Of course the gravy makes this dish; thick creaminess and bits of sausage - UM YUM *in my southern accent*...The best I've had yet. Huge serving...huge!\n\nStuffed French Toast - if you love cream cheese, you'll ALWAYS want this. Its like they put a brick of cream cheese in the middle of two thick slabs of toast, and topped it off with innards of a warm cinnamon apple pie. Had not experienced anything like it before. Pretty delicious and creative. This too, was a lot for one person. \n\nOh! Can't forget about the money part.

There was poop or vomit on the floor (I didn't inspect it that carefully). And it turns out that the sink to wash your hands is outside the actual bathroom. It made me wonder if the staff really bothered. The state of the kitchen also seemed pretty iffy. It almost put me off of my hunger, but I pushed through because we knew of no other place to go. \n\nThe omelet I was served was about the worst omelet I'd ever had. It was overcooked, dry, and flavorless. Y'know, it's pretty hard to mess-up an omelet. The home-fries were also bland, soft, and mushy. What is it with places that don't make crispy home-fries?! Does anybody actually ~like~ non-crispy home fries?!\n\nThe only reason I'm not giving this place one star is that our server (an older gay gentleman) was kind of a hoot.

Both dishes were $7.75.\n\nWe were able to share, and I have to say that the pancakes were quite tasty this morning whether that is an anomaly or not. I know It's Tops gets the glory, but Andy's does give them a run for their batter. And the ham in the scrambled eggs were actually julienned, so there was a hefty amount of protein in them eggs.

Tonight was my first time visiting and my expectations were met. I don't necessarily like when my expectations are met, especially for a restaurant in San Francisco. \n\nFor my meal I ordered the super chicken sandwich, and it was essentially chicken fingers, cole slaw, lettuce, one tomato slice, mayo, and two pickle chips sandwiched between two excessively large pieces of bread. I understand this is only a diner, but San Francisco is home to so many restaurants that it becomes essential to add something else to stick out from the rest. The meal was hot but my french fries were over cooked (VERY crispy and crunchy, I don't like that). My friend ordered the reuben which he seemed to enjoy.\n\nAs for service, our waiter was very nice but he seemed aggravated/pissed off when I only wanted to drink water. He even came back and asked me if I changed my mind and wanted to order another beverage. Why can't I just have water? My friend got coffee and they never let him see the bottom of his cup, that was quite nice. It took a while for us to get our food (despite the fact the restaurant was pretty empty) but what I like about Orphan Andy's is that you can scope out the inhabitants of the Castro while waiting for your food. There was one server (blonde hair) who thought he was smoking hot or something, like settle down, you're not. \n\nOverall, when I went to pay our meal it came to $21 which was less than what I expected. The food was cheap, greasy, but I was definitely full afterwards. It's cool how they're open 24 hours but unless I'm drunk in the Castro at 3am, I don't know if I'll come back.

They hired a new cook and when ever he's at the stove, I get sick. The waitstaff has really gone down hill, too! Really wish Richard wasn't on the morning shift or else I'd come in for something safe like french fries. \n\nI was in there yesterday after a routine doctors appointment. As always, I grabbed a menu and sat down in my usual spot - corner table in the front so that all the tourists can stand there and take secret pictures when they think you're not looking. The waiter - a tall, short dark hair - guy walked over and asked, \"anymore in your group?\" and I said no. Great, I should have said there were 20 in my group because it just went down hill from there - it was instant attitude. He made a point of setting my silverware (when he came back) across the table - as if I might squirt estrogen on him so, he better stay as far away as possilbe. He took my order which, I very politely gave him - 1 overpriced Ceasar Salad ($7.45 for lettuce, a glob of cheap Parmesan cheese in the middle and a couple of croutons with a drenching of Ceasar Dressing), a side of bacon and a Red Bull. I got a glass or water which, I had not ordered (apparently they don't watch the news - only serve water when requested). Still, no Hi! or How are you? You could feel the attitude as he made a point of no eye contact or speech. If you're having a bad, then check it at the door and paint on your happy face! \n\nI got my overly wilted salad and ate what I could because my mouth was starting to burn from the over abundance of Ceasar Dressing, drank my Red Bull and ate my bacon. My meal was served with my check (never had that happen before nor, did I see anyone else eating with a check on their table). WTF is wrong with you people? What happened to this place? Why all the attitude, especially to faithful and heavy tippers (I personally tip based on service, not percentage - people have walked away with a tip equaling the bill or more before). I got up, paid my bill - I really didn't want to leave a tip but, left a $2 tip on a $14 check which, I felt was more than fair. As I walked out the door I got a very catty \"Byyyye\" which, I have heard on many occasion from Chad and then proceed to piss and moan about their tip. \n\nWant better tips people? Work on the attitude. Want better customers? Work on the quality of food - you all are slipping and making your customers sick, or are the sick customers selective? I said to myself when I made it out the door - I'm done with this place, I don't pay for attitude and discomfort. Sorry folks, there are better places in the area with better service and cuisine that matches the price.", "author": "Jamilah A."}

My favorite is the banana chocolate chip hot cakes...they're to die for! I mean it's a huge stack of banana, and chocolate chips and pancakes. They're especially good at 2 am after a long night. Other notable dishes are their burgers. They're all delicious especially if you pair them with nice crispy onion rings! My other go to dish is the typical breakfast dish - 2 eggs, toast, bacon and breakfast potatoes. The servings are massive so come prepared to feast!!! Tip: the weekend line is crazy, come prepared to wait. I normally head over before I'm hungry, get my name on the list and then hang around outside and enjoy the sunshine a little. That way I'm not starving while I wait and instead generally am seated by the time my hunger really starts kicking in!

I personally think Andy's has a ton of character and personality, and that goes a long way in my book (there's nothing that bores me more than a cookie-cutter dining experience, which is why I'll never leave SF). So yes, maybe the food is \"greasy\", but sometimes that exactly what I'm looking for. Don't judge me.\n\nIt had been at least 5 years since I'd been here (until this weekend). Although I do remember from my last visit that my pancakes were perfectly fluffy and delicious. I returned again this weekend with my two sisters, and was surprised to find the same older gentleman taking my order. That doesn't happen very often, especially in big cities like SF where people come and go so frequently. So that was a sign of good things to come :)\n\nWe sat at a booth towards the back and were promptly greeted. I went with the turkey club with a side of potato salad (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6BMxNLbCSQIe72nYGiJBXA?select=Jb04Lrxo7Msmw791u-epFg). My sisters ordered burgers (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/6BMxNLbCSQIe72nYGiJBXA?select=_Hham08Lgev-OFUnQq_Xlg). My turkey club came out and it was STACKED. Half of it was turkey (score!). The club was cut into four pieces, and the bread was toasted perfectly and wasn't too crispy so as to make it hard to take a bite out of the sandwich. But the big shocker was the potato salad...it was freakin' delicious! It must have been the seasoning, because potato salad is really nothing without it. I think I tasted paprika. In any case, I wished I could have ordered a pint of it to take home with me!\n\nI also like that the staff was appropriately attentive - my sisters and I were yammering on and on, so they took that as a queue that we would be there for a while and just came by occassionally to offer up drink refills. It's a small place and I know seating is hard to come by, especially on a Saturday afternoon, so I was pleased that the staff didn't make us feel rushed at all.

But, alas, the last 4 times I have eaten here, it's just been a waste of my time and money.\n\nThey claim it's still the same cook it has been for 6 or 7 years, and maybe he's too comfortable, because this morning when I got my \"omellete\" it was a welllllll-done pile of egg on top of a pile of chewy non-edible bacon (and I can always eat BACON!) and I literally had to use a KNIFE to cut thru the egg!  It was so disgusting! 1 bite and I was done.  \n\nAnd if that's not bad enough, the SERVICE!  OMG!  Since the 1st time I went to Orphan Andy's the service always mortified me.  I literally couldn't believe that these 2 assholes that run service in the mornings could be so condescending to me and to everyone!  I still came back because I liked the food.\n\nI couldn't take it anymore after today.  They were SO rude to my table - as usual- and to a nice old man who came in to order take-out.  His food probably took 30 min to get (and ours took almost 40 min to get!) and they just kept telling him he was in the way and to move - instead of offering for him to sit at the EMPTY bar.  I couldn't handle it anymore, so I asked if he'd like to sit at our table while we both wait for our really bad food with our extremely bad service.  I also think they don't like women/lesbians - because they tend to be very nice to cute little gay boys that come in - seating them immediately and giving them a warm smile with a menu and a glass of water, whereas, we had to ask for a menu and had to ask for water twice!   \n\nThese guys have got to be some of the most bitter human beings I've ever met in my life.

Less than half the seats at this cramped diner were occupied with single individuals.  Short of being greeted by ANY of the wait staff, I grabbed myself a menu and started browsing.

Before he could utter anything polite like 'How are you?'  or 'What can I get for you?', he barked \"Put your foot under the table, PLEASE!!\"  I was seated at one of the table/booths along the wall and had my left foot inched toward the center isle.

Gross.), the service is okay, as long as you don't get the Bitter Old Queen whose surliness is less than entertaining. The bitch actually kicked my foot and told me to get out of her way!  If I had been dining alone I would have charged the server with assault. I've forgiven myself for being slow to respond to operant conditioning; but, I've finally moved on.   Prices have gone up, and the quality of food and service seems to be sliding. It's a little difficult to slide too far, when you are already nearing rock bottom.", "author": "Cullen H."}

After \"thinking about\" a couple of places that we saw, we happened upon Orphan Andy's.  I had seen this place some years before, but never went in.  The prices were a bit cheaper than some of the other spots, so we went in.\n\nNice.  This is a greasy spoon in the best sense of the word.  Yup, the hamburgers and fries are wonderfully oily and delicious.  Not the kind of place you go to for health food, but if you're in the mood for a great burger or sandwich (like my wife's terrific reuben) no matter what the time of day and night, this is the place.  My daughter didn't like the salad--she said there was too much garlic, vinegar and lemon.  She did like the chicken tenders though, as did we.\n\nGreat ambiance and service here.  The tables are OLD, the pictures on the wall are cool, and the bathroom is really tiny but spotless.  Awesome spot to eat and well worth a repeat visit.  I haven't yet found a restaurant in this neighborhood that I didn't like and Orphan Andy's continues the trend.", "author": "Matthew D."}

I had an omelette, my wife had a salad.  Nothing fancy in either dish that would take special preparation.  \n\nA few minutes later, two guys took the next two stools to the left.  In the next 20 minutes they ordered (regular lunch entrees), ate, paid and left.  We still hadn't been served and apparently the waiter wasn't paying attention.  I finally asked him where our food was and he said that, yeah, he should go check.  He went into the kitchen (about 5 steps away) and came back and said that something on one of our orders needed special prep and I'm thinking like, maybe the eggs or the lettuce?  \n\nAnyway, our plates finally showed up about 5 minutes later.  The food was good, the portions generous, the prices though a little high not unusual for SF.  But clearly the kitchen wasn't processing orders very well and our waiter, though he was serving just a few feet of counter and could see whose plates were coming out of the kitchen and whose weren't, wasn't paying much attention.  \n\nBased on this experience I'm not sure I would go back.

Topped with powdered imitation parmesan and boxed baby \"croutons.\" The chicken part of the salad was dry and awful. Overall it was a salty mess. It's not bargain-priced but even if it were we'll be staying far, far away. I suppose the 2am crowd is the only reason this place is still around.", "author": "Kevin S."}

Slide on over to a stool at the counter at Orphan Andy's on weekdays, say about 7 in the morning. The Salvadoran cooks in the back are standing around not doing much. The waiter, tall, older gentleman gray hair and glasses wearing shorts. He walks around imitating a short order cook and he even has the nerve to say \"babe\" at the end of his sentences. \"Babe\" as in \"hon\" or something folksy or sassy.\n\nOrdered the diced ham and scrambled eggs, home fries and sourdough toast on a crisp Friday morning. Got coffee too. Maybe it's because I wasnt too much into the morning chatter or maybe I didnt say \"no thanks\" when this guy came barreling in with his coffee pot for the refill later, but he didnt seem to like my atttiude,\n\nI didn't like his food. The eggs were supposed to be runny or \"easy\" and they had clumps of egg whites so they werent properly mixed or scrambled. The home fries were dry as chalk, with absolutely no moisture as if they had been air dried, and no seasoning. An occasional slice of bell pepper is going to add zilch flavor!\n\nThe toast was cold and piled on top of the ham, and this made the ham --by the way, of the Oscar Meyer variety-- seep into the bread. All this for about $7.95, a total gyp since I eventually left much of the food there.\n\nMiss Thang then tried to upbraid me a little later on when I waited possibly 10 minutes for my check. She was doing some clean up, dumping out oil and lard, throwing out garbage and when he finally appeared, I said \"Check please\", then he shouted \"Yes, I heard you!\"  He was this close to snapping.\n\nWhen he got closer I also said \"can I get a glass of water\", I suppose I forgot to say \"please\". Geez. Sister girlfriend then yells out to me \"S'il vous plait\", a curiously fey and mannered response to someone who may or may not know what she is saying. Well it just so happens I do know and I do speak French very well. So I launched into a \"Oui, monsieur, s'il vous plait! C'est tres tres gentil\". He looked a bit confused as if his bitchiness had been exposed. I can play this game too and still cannot understand why this person decided to be so petulant with me.\n\nSo am I expecting much with this dump of a place? At this hour of day? This is a place you probably come to at 4 am after a bender of booze and pills at the clubs across the street. Or you know --you're just about 10 feet away from this new corner on 17th and Castro with the benches where men have deciided to just drop trou (completely)  to the amazement and camera clicks of all tourists.\n\nSave your cash; go somewhere else.", "author": "Alfonso L."}

Andy's is small in size, enormous in spirit, quality, fun and community history.  Sit at the counter and participate in the creation of your chow, a booth where you can hear sordid stories from drunk or hung over queens suffering endless broken hearts and heels or the coveted window tables where the people watching is as good as it gets with the new mini park and the trolley's loading and off loading all day and most of the night.\n\nOrphan Andy's has survived and thrived through some amazing times in the gateway to the Castro and has always been a symbol of the best qualities of our community and all we do for each other and all of San Francisco, our home of choice.  The bacon cheeseburger here is what a classic American cheeseburger is all about, timeless, delicious and so tasty, add some rings or the fries and you'll exit with a cheek to cheek grin and walk with the gambit of proud gluttony.

He was obvious being very rude and trying to piss us off for some reason. I discreetly ask the other waiter if they share tips, (he was very nice and I didn't want to screw him over with a bad tip.) our original waiter comes over, SITS DOWN, and hostilely asks, \"What was wrong with my service?\" And I said, \"I'm sorry, We just felt you were kind of aloof and gave us our service in passing.\" And he scoffs loudly to cash my payment, (I still tipped 10%,) and he FOLLOWS US OUT and yells at us, \"Remember, Castro is for the gays.\" And I said, excuse me? Not even believing that that was what he hated us for.\nI asked for a manager's number, and he writes it down angrily and says that we will get an earful for disrespecting him. We leave and he follows us AGAIN and calls us homophobes and says \"we is why they need the castro to protect them from straights.\" We talk and I explain that I had no problem with his sexuality and that we love the castro because it is inclusive and loving, and he is just an arrogant, piece of shit asshole. He then says, \"fine, if you're sorry, give me a hug.\" He swoops at me and I say, don't touch me, (he's obviously hostile and unstable,) and he screams, \"NOT A HOMOPHOBE, RIGHT? SHE DOESNT WANT ME TO TOUCH HER, I'M TOO GAY,\" causing a scene and I start crying because he literally is just set on being volatile and caustic and is profiling us as HOMOPHOBES. We are both liberal, accepting, loving people who speak out for rights of all kinds and this cannot be FARTHER from the truth. He then calls me, \"venomous,\" and says I \"need to learn how to communicate.\" I walk back inside and ask the nice waiter for the managers number and he apologizes and gives it to us. Super sweet.

It was late and most places weren't open anymore. Luckily Orphan Andy's is 24 hours and in the Castro so it was still lively in the area. I'm not big on walking around a quiet area. \n\nThe strawberry milk shake was really good, but a bit too sweet and this was after the guy said he was going to make it less sweet for me already. It was almost $6 just for the shake, but it was worth it. It was also not as big as other places like Mel's where they give you the glass and the extra in the tin; all of it fit in one cup. But that is a-okay with me because I still couldn't finish it. Nothing special about the fries, but he did offer me different sauces. I love honey mustard. \n\nOverall, great place to get that milk shake/ french fries fix.", "author": "Angela T."}

I handed him a 20 and he tried to give me back a dollar and all I ordered was the breakfast bagel, which is 7.20+ tax he tried to say I only gave him a ten but I only had 2 twenties that I had just got from the bank. He gave me 10 after our brief conversation but that still didn't equate to the correct change. I should have gotten another dollar even to begin with had I given him a ten the change was not correct.  I come in here fairly regularly as I work across the street and this guy never seems to have that great of an attitude. He kind of a bigger guy and always where's a hat.  Next  time I won't even allow him to take my order. it's extremely obvious that he is not happy with his job and on top of that I'm sober and thus know that my change was wrong.... how about the drunk ppl that come in?

He seemed broken at such a young age.  I think he realized that he was rude, but instead of admitting his mistake, he tried to lobby for support from another table instead.  It failed, because they came over after their meal and offered us his name.\n\nIt's sad to witness this type of change - the transformation of a once amiable individual into someone so irreverent and impolite.  Is this the result of the restaurant industry?  Life?  Time?\n\nBut there's hope!  Our actual server was perfect.  He was friendly, efficient, attentive, kind, and apologetic.  I think he's new, and I sincerely hope that he doesn't suffer the same fate as the server before him.\n\nRegardless of last night, I still like Orphan Andy's overall (just one star less).  I'll return and hope for at least 4-star treatment during my next visit.  I guess I have more faith than my dining companions who swear never to return.\n\nPrevious 4 star review:\nChicken fried steak with eggs over medium.  This is my standard order after a full night of drinking in the Castro, and it always hits the spot!  It's greasy enough to soak up the alcohol, and the semi-liquidity of the gravy and runny eggs helps it to go down easily.  Hey, after that much drinking, you're too tired to chew, right?\n\nThe servers are pretty amazing, and the cook is the sweetest.  One night, I asked him to put extra bacon on my order on my way to the bathroom (which is through the kitchen and down the stairs), and he did!  Yay for extra bacon!  They're pretty fast at clearing tables too - the last thing you want to do that late at night is to wait for a table.\n\nThe food is better than some of the other greasy spoons nearby, and definitely more flavorful, probably because they don't skimp on all the fatty goodness.  For the price you pay, the food is good and the portions are perfect.\n\nThe Orphan Andy character (on all menus) also rocks!

I came here a few years back to get a burger for lunch and remember being very pleased by the experience.  I came here two days ago after my yoga class with some friends for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the huge breakfast portions.  I had the 2 eggs special with french toast (only $1.25 extra), orange juice (freshly squeezed and very sweet, though I'm guessing they must have added sugar), and green tea.  We all cleaned our plates!  The waiter was super friendly, had just the right amount of sass, and was very accommodating when we asked to split the bill on three cards.\n\nThe booth seating is really cute and the ambience is perfect.

It is a place to watch and be watched, to hook up (if you're into that sort of naughty thing), and to put it simply, to be gay, bitchy, and utterly fabulous.  Do yourself a favor and before you walk into OA, take a look at the waiters and customers.  Do they look conservative and business-like?  No.  Does the place look like a high-end restaurant with imported decor that was professionally designed?  No.  Do the waiters look like they give a fuck?  Definitely, NO.  And that's the beauty of OA.  This place is a 24 hour diner that caters to drunken and obnoxious fags and dykes at all hours of the day and night.   If you're not a fellow homo, you may not understand the magnitude of that previous statement.  Queers are in a species of their own.  We are not easy to please.  The staff at OA knows this, so they don't even try.  And I love them for it.  Case in point:  I ordered oatmeal and a bagel with cream cheese for breakfast.  They forgot the oatmeal.  When the waiter asked if there was anything else he could bring, I said, \"Yes, the oatmeal I ordered.\"  He replied, \"May I have my oatmeal please?\" to which I responded, \"May I have my oatmeal please?\"  Then he brought me my oatmeal.  If that doesn't tell you how wonderful these guys are, then you're a complete tard.  My advice: eat there, don't expect to be treated like the princess that you think you are, and give them very generous tips.  They deal with queers all day.  For fuck's sake, show them some mercy and gratitude.", "author": "Bobby D."}

I had a polish dog that was pretty darn yummy. Anyway, once we crossed the street the waiter tapped me on the shoulder and said, \"You forgot your coat, love!\" and I was very impressed! \n\nThe second time I went I was with my boyfriend. We went for some breakfast. I had a hankering for French toast with bacon and hash browns BUT when I tried to substitute eggs for hash browns the same British waiter said no. Sooo I just got French Toast with a side of bacon and the boy got some omelette with home fries. Mr.Belvedere came out right away with my munchies but, unfortunately, my date's came out 5 mins later (I won't eat until everyone is served). I kinda wish Jeeves kept it under the heat lamp but being the fat kid I am I dove into my syrup orgy without complaint the moment my boyfriend's food arrived.

Then harassed by the manager or who I think was the manager on your way out.\n\n After pointing out the bacon I took from my mouth with a napkin to realize there was more on the veggie patty the waiter replies: \n \"Oh, yeah that's bacon.\" continues to wipe the table next to mine as he later adds: \"I'm sorry hon, we can take it off from your check.\" I get up and wash my mouth and hands in their filthy bathroom, gather my belongings and leave. \n\n  A short young woman intercepts me on the way out, blocking the exit: \"Are you the one freaking out about the bacon on your veggie burger?\" I lowered my eyes wondering why she blocks the exit and nod. Then she raises her voice and adds: \"Well, you know you should not be hating on my people, It wasn't the waiter's fault, it was the cook's fault, you know..\" At this point I went from being sad to very upset. #1 I never said anything to the waiter and who was this troll? why the tone?.

Rolling into my clothes and running out of that scene, I made it to Market and Castro and into Orphan Andy's. It was the middle morning so any sort of a rush was over. Being a thin, whippish little thing--and preferring to stay that way-- I kept away from the very tempting breakfast meals listed in the restaurant's menu and chose instead the rather simple breakfast sandwich. It came simply enough; unadorned and plated quaintly. Four slices of bacon, fried eggs, cheese on sourdough toast: perfection. I looked torn and frayed from the previous night and received a decent welcome from the lovely gentlemen behind the counter. I felt like I belonged, if only for my one lowly sandwich.\n\nI could rant and rave about the burgers I've had here, or the to-die-for mashed potatoes, but I much prefer to talk about the place that's there even on the mornings when last night's regrets are still floating like a cloud above me.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-02-03", "description": "So ... Last night my date, her friend, and myself had wandered about the Castro, just drinking and dancing and chatting and all that good stuff.  Bars started closing around the predictable time and we were on the sidewalk.  A good buzz was floating around in my noggin and I flagged down a Peachy Puff Girl for a quick pack of smokes (totally not realizing that I could have saved $3 by just purchasing at Walgreen's (24 hours).  Oh well.  It was at that point that somebody said, \"Anybody as hungry as I am?\"\n\nAt 2:15 in the morning, all somebody really has to say when you're standing on the sidewalk amidst all the last minute-hooking up and squawking and hurling and bouncing is one of three things to get you really, really hungry:  \"Food?\", \"Hungry?\", or \"3-Egg Omelet?\"\n\nI realize that all I've had to eat today was a banana, two slices of left-over pizza, and a lot of slices of cheddar.  My golly, I was freaking FAMISHED.  My date said, \"Orphan Andy's -- it's right around the corner.\"  I solemnly agreed that a greasy spoon was in order (seeing as my fridge at home has (you guessed it) a bunch of bananas, some left-over pizza, and a block of aged cheddar.  (I have food-food, too, but damned if I was actually gonna MAKE something.\n\nWord of warning for those who go to Orphan Andy's on a weekend night at 2:20 in the morning:  You're going to wait for a while.  There's what -- only about 5 booths, 2 tables, and a counter-top?  Yep, my friends, you're gonna have to wait.  And the longer you wait, the hungrier you get watching those people inside through the windows stuffing their little faces off.  People were sitting on the sidewalk.  Some crude jokes about genitalia were thrown into the ether.  We waited.  I needed to go to the bathroom.\n\nWord of warning to anybody who goes downstairs to the only bathroom whilst generally intoxicated and hungry and is impatient to use it:  Watch your head.  That door frame is so low (and hard), that if you just walk on in (and you're about 5' 10\" or taller) you're going to hit your head on the fucking thing.  And it HURTS.  Ow!  Some girl said, \"Didn't you see the sign that says, 'Watch Your Head?'\"  I said, \"Yes, and funnily enough, I've been staring at it for five minutes while those 3 hipster girls were in there snorting coke.\"\n\nSo the three of us finally get seated.  It's about 2:50 at this time.  Our waiter joins us and we tell him that we are totally ready to order, you you just take it now?  So he does, but he doesn't write it down and then when he repeats what you ordered, he always leaves something out.  We go through it about four times until he gets it right, and then we wait some more with very mediocre coffee and water that tastes a little silty.  But it's almost 3:00!  I'm not going to complain.\n\nWhen the food comes (I ordered a bacon, mushroom, cheddar and sour cream omelet with home-fried potatoes and a side of sausage links), I just can't hold back anymore ... and I eat it all.  Every fucking bite went down like a gilded prize.  And tasted good!  And was just perfect at that particular time in that particular place.  I was foodified.\n\nThen we parted ways, and I took the Luxor chariot back to my 'hood, and then I lay down in bed.  That's when that little brat Orphan Andy kicked me in the stomach.\n\nMy God, man.  My tummy was making sounds that brought to mind Marilyn Manson's most gloomy groans.  I felt itchy and hot and cold.  I tossed and turned like a leaf in a hurricane.  My cat got grouchy 'cos I wouldn't hold still for him to lean up against.  Oh my, I felt like SHIT, and it was all my fault for eating it so fast, I know -- but I knew, deep down in the cockles of my heart that Andy was culpable as well.  Why is the food so greasy?  My tummy seemed to be full of the stuff, and my guts were pressing up against my insides, feeling, as they were full of red hot lumps of lead.\n\nGroan, groan, groan.  I made it through the night.  Oh, Orphan Andy ... you tried to off me from this Mortal Coil and YOU FAILED.  I'm still kicking!  And next time I am there in your general vicinity, and somebody says, \"Anybody hungry?\"  I will remember you and I will think twice.  Peace out.  See you in another couple of years.", "author": "Thomas B."}

My boyfriend ordered the steak and eggs which was huge but still edible by my hungry man in one sitting.

The waiter got really testy when this one group decided to hover over a table when it wasn't cleared. I felt bad for the guy, because I've done the whole waitress bit, and the last thing you want is someone watching you while you clear a former group's table.

And well the day I had one of those $5 milkshakes (maltshake in this case) from Orphan Andy's reminded me of that specific scene in the movie that went something like this:\n\nMia: A five dollar shake.\nBuddy Holly: How do you want that shake: Martin and Lewis or Amos and Andy?\nMia: Martin and Lewis.\nVincent Vega: Did you just order a five dollar shake?\nMia: Ummhh.\nVincent Vega: That's a shake . . . that's milk and ice cream.\nMia: Last I heard.\nVincent Vega: That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?\nBuddy Holly: No.\nVincent Vega: Just checking.\n\nNow in this case, I was Vincent Vega and my friend was probably Mia despite the gender switcheroo. My friend was so convinced that Orphan Andy's had in the words of Kanye West \"thee best milkshake of all time... of all time!\" and me, never being a skeptic decided to take his word for it. At first I was little reluctant, I mean really? $5 for a milkshake? Why not just go to In & Out and throw down the same crinkled five dollar bill and get a cheeseburger, fries AND a shake. That would sound like a more reasonable and realistic action for a cheapskate to do, wouldn't you say? But my friend definitely knew what he was talking about. This milkshake was NOT frothy, fluffy, painstakingly sweet, thick as a poodle, you get what I'm saying-- it was just right. As a matter of fact it was delicious, sweet, almost close to perfection. It was also very chocolately because I did happen to order the chocolate malt while my friend got the vanilla, which also was just as amazing.\n\nNow the only thing I could disagree with is the price. The Vincent Vega in me definitely was not pleased to throw down $13 for two shakes and tip. AND there was no bourbon in the shake?\n\nNote to Self: The next time before dropping by to Orphan Andy's, remember to drop by the closest liquor store and buy a personal bottle of bourbon so I can slip some into my shake.

Admittedly, the food is nothing to write your dear, beloved, field-hockey-playing+ Aunt Francine about, but for around $7-8 a head, it's nothing to get in a huff and call in the Navy+ over, either.

Their maple syrup, on the other hand, is on the thin and runny side - not rich, sweet and thick+ like one would normally like.\n\n\n All joking and innuendo aside, Orphan Andy's is a solid place to pick up some greasy American food at decent prices at any time of the day, with the added bonus of getting your groove on to a snazzy jukebox.

Basically this is your friendly, Castro-neighborhood diner with food to match.\n\nI do have to take one star away for the absolutely abhorrent state of their bathroom. YECH.  Gross, cramped, and reminds me of a gas-station toilet I vaguely remember being taken into when I was a wee tot.  Even at that age, I was too finicky to go in there.

I looked over and saw the kitchen empty and my food sitting on the serving ledge.  I called attention to it before getting it myself, and it was brought over with no apology or acknowledgment.  The eggs, ordered over easy, were raw inside.  I'm not talking runny.  I can deal with runny.  I don't know how the cook managed to get the outsides cooked enough to stay together and have the insides remain raw.  The potatoes, obviously boiled in advance, were burned one side and cold on the other.

We said hi to him as we walked in and sat down at one of the wet booths. (Apparently the tables had all just been wiped down with a wet cloth.) he ignored us. Not so much as a glance or a \"someone will be with you shortly\". After about 5 minutes a female server appeared from somewhere in the nether regions of the diner and came to our table with menus. When she came back to take our order, they were out of the cheesecake we had come in for. She brought us ice cream and coffee instead. When it came time to leave, she brought us our check, but never returned to take our payment, so after waiting for awhile, we decided to pay at the register. The guy who had ignored us initially stood there, about 6 feet away from us, stacking plates. Even though he knew we were ready to pay and leave, he continued to stack the plates, ignoring us again. My partner asked him if someone could please take our money. He continued to stack plates. We were getting a little agitated at his complete indifference to us and he finally said \" is there a problem?\" I said\" yes, there's a problem. You seem to think it's more important to stand there and stack plates than take care of customers. We'd like to pay for our food.\" He told us that our server would be with us in a moment, again, there are no other customers that this guy is helping. He's stacking plates 6 feet away from us, while facing us. I started to tell him what poor service he was giving us as the female server finally appeared again to ring us up. As we left, he followed us out, telling us that we needed to \"get some class\" and that actually he was on his lunch break. He followed us out of the diner to tell us this, shouting at us as we walked away from him. Perhaps the place was empty for a reason. We won't be going back.", "author": "Michael W."}

I've certainly noticed it before but never had a reason to stop in.  The fact that Orphan Andy's is a 24-hour establishment gave me reason.  That's the first good thing about Andy's- I wish all establishments were open 24/7 but most places are simply too inconsiderate.  I ordered the omelettes, and what can I say?  They were good, that's for certain, but then it's pretty hard to screw up omelettes.  Likewise, the toast was satisfactory.  My friend also got breakfast fare and from what I could see it was similarly generic- very good but not difficult to make well.  Continuing this trend of generally well-rounded typcality, the price was reasonable and they didn't skimp on portions.  Just know that is isn't the most spacious of places, the booths holding about four people each\n\nI guess what I'm saying is I haven't tried enough of the menu to give a thorough review but as far as breakfast food goes, it was quite good.  Much better than Denny's, that's for sure.  At least my friend claims to frequent the  place often.  I'm certainly coming back next time I'm out late.\n\nIn summary the place was well rounded, but nothing seemed to stand out about it.  Yet it certainly couldn't be called mediochre.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2010-08-17", "description": "I came to Orphan Andy's in San Francisco's Castro district about a week ago for breakfast.  It was aesthetically pleasing, with San Francisco history and other pieces of Americana decking the walls with grace and no pretension.  I was there with two friends of mine, and we were waited on by a wonderful gentleman who did not hesitate to call us \"loves,\" \"fabulous,\" and \"fantastic\" (all comments were greatly appreciated).  His attitude was great, but I felt like the speed of service could have used some adjusting (but maybe this was because we were being metered and had all of forty five minutes from ordering to checking out).  Our primary server was very nice, however there was a rather muscular employee who made no attempt to soften his expression when looking our way (awkward).  \n\nThe food came out after what seemed like a short eternity, but a pleasant one.  The furniture, the lighting, and the music overheard led to nice early morning contemplation and conversation which made the time pass smoothly.  The refills on the water and coffee were a little slow, but when they came our server was very charming.  Beware of the half and half, if you're a little drunk or kind of sleepy, you'll fail to see that there is no obvious spout and your coffee and your table may end up with a bit more cream than you'd anticipated as my friend found out five minutes in.  \n\nI thought the food portion was very generous, but despite that, I still felt that things were rather expensive.  I managed to take a close look at three dishes: 1.) The Monte Cristo, which was pretty much a generous helping of breakfast ham lodged between two slices of french toast, complete with a snowcap of powedered sugar served with fries and pickles, 2.) a Hawaiian something or other sandwich that had ham and a piece of grilled Pineapple served with fries, and 3.) The Spanish Omelette with mushrooms, salsa, and two hotcakes.  Nobody finished their entire plate.  I managed to try the Monte Cristo, it was delightfully bad for your health, and the sandwich paired nicely with the tableside jam and I could see myself craving it after a night of drinking.  The omelette left a lot to be desired.  It was a well done omelette by any standards, but it seemed to lack a bit of life.  It tried to compensate for this with a healthy dollop of salsa, but the salsa tasted like I came straight out of mild Pace Picante.  This wasn't bad per se, but it definitely wasn't the \"salsa\" I had envisioned.  The pancakes were good and large, but they too were pretty standard.  Apparently, the chocolate chip pancakes are to die for, so I think I'll have to go back for those.\n\nIn all, it was a decent experience at Orphan Andy's.  I think I'd appreciate the place more if I were out late and wanted something other than Denny's or Lucky Penny.  The service was both good and bad, depending on what you're looking at, so that balanced out into a solid passing grade.  If it were a bit cheaper, I think I could overlook some of the issues I had with the food, but in these times with this economy, I feel like there are other places I'd rather dine.", "author": "Matthew H."}

It's funny, but I thought I was being too critical - until I started reading others. It seems like Civic Duty to review this place.\n\nThe food: greasy diner food. It is what it is. The potatoes are disgustingly greasy. They're actually transparent with grease! The only other time I dined here, my omelet almost slipped off the plate when the waiter set it down because of the brown-yellow pool of sludge it was floating on. Liked my biscuits and gravy, though.\n\nThe price: $35.00 for hearty breakfast for two (!!!), with juice and coffee. Not counting tip, but nobody earned one, so that's a moot point. It's cheap diner food that doesn't fit the prices.\n\nThe service: I really wish I hadn't supported this place with my business, It wasn't the absolute worst I've had, but I'll certainly put it in my bottom five. I go to a restaurant to eat, not to hear inappropriate catty commentary from the wait staff. Our order came fast enough, coffee was fine. In terms of crowd and such there was no problems for a weekday mid-morning.  I ordered an omelette with potatoes and biscuits/gravy.

Since we didn't feel like driving too far, I suggested the Castro.  I used to live right around the corner from the castro on 17th street.  I was about 3 doors down from Orphan Andy's and maybe went there once or twice simply because it was close and cheap.  I had very slow service before, but since I had all morning I decided why not.  The food's not that bad.  So we go, manage to grab the last booth available and the cool guy with the glasses (and adorably gay) comes over to us, greets us very friendly, and asks us if we would like something to drink. I order coffee, and my bf orders orange juice.  It takes about 7 to 8 minutes but we finally get it.  The coffee was disgusting, tasted like heated dishwater but the oj was delicious.  All pulpy, just the way i like it.  Another ten minutes goes by, and he finally comes to take our order.  I get some kind of chili pepper omelette and the bf ordered steak and eggs.  I swear, the food came up in about 10 or 15 minutes, but the server did not bring it around for an additional ten or fifteen.  So by the time we got our food it was lukewarm.  The omelette was ok, chili peppers tasted straight out of a can.  Potatoes were extremely greasy.  The steak made me want to vomit just looking at it.  Greasy, a large amount of fat, and extremely small and thin.  Once cut, it was hardly cooked inside.  But the saving grace of my bf's breakfast were the pancakes.  So fluffy and big, and deliciously buttermilk-y.  \nWe finished, and waited around for the check for 15 minutes, finally I saw the guy with glasses walk by and I asked him if we were supposed to pay.  In a rather annoyed way, he told me I could do whatever I wanted.

Two gay dudes up front and a Latino guy doing all the grunt work in the back. I sit down. No eye contact. Silly me for wearing my I-AM-A-LESBIAN button today. I order and everything's fine so far (except for the button wearing.) I got coffee but I'm a pussy and I need milk. I ask for it. And Younger Dude says, \"it's right there in front of you\" and pointed like a librarian in a foul mood.  I had to tell him, \"really, it's not here.\" So, YD does that rolling eye, exhaling thing that gay guys do! Hmph! Well, he comes around and sees that it is indeed not there. So he fills up another creamer to the brim and puts it in front of me.  It was so full that it spilled when I poured it. He didn't even try to help me. Thanks. A. Lot.\n\nThe phone rings. Older Dude answers it and talks at length and finally turns around to the Latino Dude and yells, \"I'M TRYING TO HEAR THE PHONE, STOP BANGING AROUND IN THERE! GEE.

I started going to OA when it opened and have had many enjoyable encounters with the food and staff. Today marked the last time I will ever set foot in this sad sad joint. Sat down around 2:00 pm and had to wait some time to give our order - that's not a biggy. Our youngish waiter finally took the time to take our order. Two tables were seated after us - they were served their food and were eating. Our food -who knows where it was. We had to re-feed the meter. The food arrived. I ordered the hamburger steak medium rare - made a point of saying that twice, with two eggs over easy. I cannot believe how over cooked the hamburger was, inedible. I guess that is what took so long for our food to arrive -that alone would have take twenty minutes. The home fries actually had blackened burnt parts. The eggs were cooked over easy -really over easy the eggs were basically raw. The toast was soggy, I am hoping that was from way too much butter, My partners food had obviously sat under a heat lamp while my burger was being burnt.\nWhen I told the waiter I would pay for the two eggs and toast but not the rest he was obliging and took my entire breakfast off the check. However it would have been better to offer to have my breakfast remade ... oh well. It does make me sad that this destination is off my Castro map of restaurants.", "author": "Sam L."}

Inflexible seating means groups of more than 4 will be split up (unless you can crowd into a booth designed for 4 average-sized people).  At busy times (weekend breakfast and late night) you will be asked to wait outside until you can be seated (cold?  rainy?  we're so sorry, but we do have an awning).  These are also the times when errors are sometimes made by the one frazzled cook in the tiny kitchen.  The single-person unisex restroom is located through the kitchen, down the stairs (past the dragon and don't wake up the troll if you know what's good for you).  Obnoxious twits who wander in at peak times with a sense of VIP entitlement and a bad attitude will meet a waitstaff who have been there, done that, and won't hesitate to give as good as they get.  Distressed vegans will be reminded that the menu was posted at the door.\n\nTHE GOOD NEWS:  Patient omnivores who come to Orphan Andy's alone or with one or three friends are in for good, solid comfort food with a few very special highlights.\n\nI think the housemade chicken vegetable soup is one of the best kept secrets in SF.  Maybe not haute cuisine, but Mama wishes she could make it like this.  Big chunks of meat and lots of veggies.  You can choose it instead of fries with your sandwich or burger.  Or the (also housemade) minestrone.\n\nOrphan Andy's is one of the few places I've seen a Monte Cristo sandwich in SF.  It's like ham and swiss cheese on french toast.  Spread it with jam or pour on some syrup.\n\nThe space is \"intimate,\" and at the counter, people sometimes strike up conversations.  If you came in by yourself, you might make a new friend.\n\nIf you can accept Orphan Andy's limitations, it's a great diner to dine in.\n\nDISCLAIMER:  I'm not and have never been employed at Orphan Andy's, nor do I have an interest in the business.  But I've been a regular there for decades and have become friends with some of the waitstaff and the owner.", "author": "Charlie G."}

The food was acceptable as always, but the floor show was really the attraction that day. I have never seen someone so tweaked out of their mind, who was not in a cheap motel room with all the bed coverings draped over the window. The waiter was literally bouncing around the place at warp speed. He came over to the dirty unwiped down counter (the whole counter was sticky with the days spills) to take my order, but then threw the order pad down on the counter and went rushing out on the sidewalk to socialize with some people he knew? As I was just left sitting there I noticed that there were piles of dirty dishes on the other side of the counter, about to fall off on the floor. He came back in and bounced off the walls a bit more, before he finally came back to the pad, to take the order. I thought he was gong to chew his lips off as he wrote down the order, but luckily they stayed attached. Anyway got what I wanted and was just careful not to touch the dirty counter.", "author": "Kevin S."}

I find that most diners tend to lack good service and push the rushed service.\nI happend upon Orphan Andys on a saturday night. My friends and I had been out drinking and decided to get some food at this castro establishment. There was about four people total in my party. The crowd was so large that they told us to wait outside in the rain for a table. This seemed a little strange to me but it was a small diner and I assumed this was normal. We were getting take out so I didnt understand why we couldnt wait inside. After a half hour passed, our food was ready. I wasnt impressed with any of it to be honest. The fries were cold and tasted like they had been out for quite some time. The turkey burger was nothing impressive. It cost about $25.00 for two of us to eat and we thought the food was terrible. I understand that a diner is not going to be culinary cuisine but come on! It was a turkey burger and bacon burger...how hard is it o mess it up?

Open 24 hours a day and it's not a Denny's = awesome. The food is hearty and your typical diner fair. Nothing fancy and mind blowing could probably only describe the characters that step into this place. Of the past various visits, the sloppy joe, breakfast plates and buffalo wings were all hits so I'm guessing you really can't go wrong with anything else on the menu. And really, when does anything taste bad when you're starving after your $$$ dinner just a few hours prior to your drunken stupor? The place is small though so if you're looking for something as soon as you stumble out that bar door, be prepared to wait.... outside! The guy who works there late night is a fairly adamant about this point and quite a quirky fellow but hey, I'd be annoyed with drunk people as well.", "author": "Jonny Bobby G."}

Desperate, on the 29th day he rented a studio on an upper floor in the building adjacent to Orphan Andy's.  Unfortunately, his windows overlooked the restaurant's roof, which had a huge exhaust vent spewing grease fumes at him 24/7. As I recall, he lasted three months there, not surprisingly never eating at Andy's. I did once . . . and once is enough.  This is the kind of place that's fabulous when you've got the 4:00am munchies and downright dismal in the daylight when your head is clear.  How has it lasted as long as it has, with far better options just around the corner?  Only if you're absolutely famished between midnight and 6:00am, and even then you've got Safeway a few blocks away. A nuked burrito at home has to be better than anything you'd order here.", "author": "Gourmet G."}

He was a Bears fan, had a moustache, glasses, was about 20 pounds overweight and wore alot of brown suits. He had a wife named Linda and a daughter named Katie. He drove a light blue Nissan Altima, and listened to talk radio. When he did listen to music, he listened to easy 90's and listened to Creed when he wanted to rock. He had a house in the suburbs, which Linda decorated witha  country flair, in alot of magenta and fiorest green, but the garage was reserved as \"his\" space. In it, he had a couch, a big screen TV and a fridge always stocked with longnecks of Bud and Bud Light. On the other side of the garage was his wife's gold Honda Accord, storage boxes and a fake Xmas tree. Steve and i got pretty close hanging out, so he gave me the code to his garage, to just open and go in, help myself and chill. Id like to say something weird happened to make this story interesting, but it didnt. Basically, its boring and normal, but wiith nice people. Like this diner. Everything is brown, average and normal, and is brought to you by nice people. *sigh* I at least wanted to see an iron maiden in his garage or something.", "author": "Mick F."}

So seven of us stumble over to Orphan Andy's for an post-party meal.  Surprisingly, it was easy to get a booth, which only seats 4 comfortably, 6 if you're ambitious--and we were.  Our server was not eager to please, he probably thought drunk people like us wouldn't tip, so why bother.  Well, we tipped him generously even after he threw straws at us and wanted to spend as little time as possible at our table....not very welcoming.  I get it, who wants to serve obnoxious drunkards at 2 am, I'm just letting you know not to expect smiling faces when you come in.

It was just about the worst breakfast I've ever had. The staff is friendly and i was approached right away but it was a good 15-20 minutes before my combo omelet showed up. Missing inside was the swiss cheese I'd ordered. I let the waiter know, he took it to the back and I heard the microwave start. A few min later it came back. The toast had been microwaved too (after being toasted) and the potatoes tasted, well, like nothing I've ever had before. Greasy, greazzzy, like they'd been on the griddle for HOURS. The omelet was pretty bland except for the grilled GREAZZZZY onions and the eggs, well, they'd been microwaved to get the cheese to melt.

My mom puts together a poetry journal called Diner and she asked me for some pics so I've been doing a diner tour of the city. I sat at the counter at Andy's and ordered a side of frys and a coke and just snapped away. The frys were of the skin attached variety and fried to a pleasant golden hue. The plate was large but so is my appetite for frys and I got all the way through it. Obviously I can't speak to what Andy's, or the Gay Diner, as I like to call it might be like at 3am or during the breakfast rush but I had a very pleasant experience here and would definitely come back.
