Their salad bar is AWESOME.  \n\nBased upon my negative experiences with their deli, I figured I'd try the salad bar instead.  No complaints there.  \n\n+ Lots of variety -- veggies, cheeses, croutons, raisins, dressings, everything\n+ Some bread (usually a roll or mini baguette) is available as well.\n\nJust grab yourself a container and fill it up as you wish.  You're charged based upon weight.  Utensils and napkins are available as you exit.

After coming here with my coworkers for lunch, I was surprised to find it to be quite large with a full salad bar and deli. There were lots of people here during the lunch hour so the lines did take a bit to go through, especially with the deli which requires one line for ordering followed by a separate line for paying. They have a sandwich special of the week that goes for ~$5.50 which is quite a deal while other sandwiches go for ~$7. The sandwiches aren't all that bad, but really not great as well, feeling rather bland and plain after eating the first half. The dutch crunch bread lacked the crunchiness I would expect from it. Overall, I found Bayside Market to be a convenient place to drop by to pick up a simple sandwich or salad for a good price in the area.", "author": "Joshua M."}

There's a lot of refrigerated items, like whole pickles, pre-prepared deli sandwiches, yogurt, and these are great for grab-and-go noshing. The deli has a variety of sandwiches available on breads, rolls, and wraps, plus an impressive complement of cold salads and other deli staples. \n\nI ordered a turkey sandwich, and was pleased to discover that there were at least three styles of turkey from which to choose (smoked, deli-style, and something else). I ordered my sandwich on a sourdough roll, but I wish I'd known it was a Boudin-style crunchy sourdough chewtoy, rather than a softer variety. Then again, given Bayside Market's proximity to Bakery Boudin, I could have anticipated. \n\nThere's a nice little cache of black wrought-iron tables and chairs right outside, which makes this a great eating spot, as well.

On Saturday may 29th we stopped by this corner store to buy some Advil . We were both well dressed because we had a reservation for a yacht cruise . The service was lackluster but I didn't pay it any mind . After the cruise ended around 5pm on our way back I really had to use a restroom . Since we had already been customers there a few hours prior and its proximity we stopped by this store to use their restroom . I was told by a young man that the clerk at the counter had the keys . I asked this clerk and he proceeded to tell me the rest room is closed , just like that  . I looked at this man in disbelief because at this point i had been holding it for a little while and didn't want to demean myself by urinating in some bushes in public . This man clearly did not care . I expressed to him that I really had no options at this  point and I really needed his help . He just looked at me and refused even after we told him we had been customers there earlier . I decided to leave because I had to use the rest room really badly and low and behold just around the store there were restrooms . No lights in the room and had no time to find a switch because I was too busy trying to find the urinal.   I had to use the flash light from my phone to see where the urinal was , but atleast I was glad that  ordeal was over  .in the least he could have told me there was one right around the corner. I came back out to see my friend expressing how disappointed she was in the way they treated me . They had tried to intimidate her with an off duty cop who was buying something from the store . Be rude to me all you want but to try and intimidate my loved one because you do not want to own up to your mistake and discrimination  is crossing the line .

This was a late lunch, at like 2pm, but I still think everything should be labeled.\n\nBecause I tried so many things, I ended up with like 5 containers each half filled with different items. I ended up putting them all in a bigger lunch container once outside to make it easier to all eat together.\n\n- Orzo salad - lacking on flavors. Not much to brag about. The peppers were diced too big and detracted rather than added from the salad.\n\n- Tabouli - too much greens, not enough other stuff. Too mushy and too wet also.\n\n- Exotic bean salad with walnts and green cauliflower - nice! Really liked this one. Subtly sweet, good crunch from the walnuts.\n\n- Hummus - liked the slightly chunky texture. And it has chives I think for flavor.\n\n- Falafel -  they should offer to heat this up for you right? Well once I heated it on my own, it was really good. Chewy and a little crumbly good texture and flavors, plus a little kick of spice.", "author": "Ziyan C."}

She proceeds to make my sandwich, very aggressively pulling out the bread, slapping fixins on it, etc.\n\nI work too hard for my money (actually, I don't), and I thought to myself, \"you know what?

That's a benefit I really love is the \"make your own\". It costs $6.99/lb, a pricey penny for a salad. But usually my salads come out to $4-5 on average. Then again think about getting a salad at a restaurant they're never cheaper than $7 and at Bayside you can make it to however you like it, and it's a lot for $7. \n\nThey also have a deli with some hot foods, pre-made salads, packaged sushi that you would get at Safeway, desserts, and made-to-order sandwiches. I've never had any of the hot foods or sandwiches, but from what my co-workers all say they like it and it's good. \n\nOnce again it's all about convenience though.

To that base, I added peppers, onion, croutons, kidney beans artichoke hearts, boiled egg slices, avocados and sun-roasted tomates with a raspberry vinagrette dressing. I added a sourdough roll and I was good to go.\n\nI took it outside to a courtyard area with tranquil views of Bayside Village, where meandering pathways and water fountains abound.
