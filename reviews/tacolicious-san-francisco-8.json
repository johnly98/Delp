If you arrive before 6pm, you can catch some happy hour specials ($7 guac, $7 margaritas) at the bar while you wait. \n\nI'm surprised that each taco now sells for $5.50 so it's not a cheap date if you head here. But the group easily killed several huge taco plates and got a whole variety of tastes to choose from: baja style cod, pastrami tacos (add $1), house special chorizo/potato, carne asada, guajillo braised beef and carne asada. I ordered a side of beans and rice and their cauliflower \"al pastor\" to complete the meal. \n\nI prefer the NB location a bit more than the Marina one, as it is more spacious and the bar is just gorgeous!

Completely delicious.\n\nI would skip the tomato-watermelon salad (queso fresco, basil, sciabica olive oil), which was with yellow watermelon that was too watery and way too sweet. I added some salt, which helped to provide some contrast.\n\nThe habanero-tamarind glazed pork ribs were a great snack - not too hardy of a rib, but just enough to make you crave more.\n\nThe service was fairly light - we had to continuously wave down our waiter where we wanted a water refill or to get our check, but I would come back strictly for the tostadas!", "author": "Christina S."}

About $6 per taco and it feels much especially because I love just the street tacos you can buy at taquerias. \n\nAnyway what makes this unique are their drinks and the 3 salsas that come with a wooden spoon that range from mild to really spicy.  I love getting the cod fish tacos fried, the carnitas, and the veggie one. As for drinks, sangria or margaritas are good. We usually end up getting a pitcher but regretting it because of the cost.

I think the Marina location is far better in terms of food in both quality and taste. A few differences I noticed were in the salsa and queso. The salsa here seems to have mint in it which made the taste reminiscent of mojitos. The queso here also had large slices of red peppers and less spice. The taco meat is also much \"wetter\" than other locations -- almost too much as the tortillas were nearly soggy upon arrival. I think the quality of the food was fine, but the taste was noticeably different compared to the Chesnut/Marina location.

There was no wait and the menu seemed pretty standard with traditional \"Mexican\" fare options. \n\nI ordered the michelada and their breakfast tacos. The portion of filling in the tacos was very generous and I was completely full after having one and a half of the tacos. They bring out chips and salsa when you sit, which is great! I always love it when Mexican places bring you free chips and salsa. The salsa had a nice flavor and wasn't overly spicy. The michelada itself was pretty decent it definitely had the kick of spiciness that I enjoy, I would have preferred a Dos Equis or Pacifico instead of a Tecate but that is just me being a little bit of a beer snob. \n\nThey also have a cool combo which I did not get but if I go back again for lunch on a weekend or dinner on a weekday I would absolutely try it. It is a taco (or maybe two or three can't exactly remember) plus a shot of tequila plus a beer for $12. Not a bad deal at all. I would definitely go to this place again.", "author": "Stephanie A."}

The beets were perfectly ripe and the combination with the orange and queso fresco was amazing. \n\nMy taco choice was the butternut squash taco (I wasn't feeling meat that night).

Prepare to take a seat at a dirty table, because it won't be wiped without asking. Also, be prepared to have to go look for your server when you want another taco, another drink, or you simply want to pay your bill because once the food \"eventually\" arrives at your table, you'll never see your server again. \n\nI was hesitant to write this review because I'm local to the neighborhood and believe that any restaurant can have an \"off day\", but I've been here many, many times, and the service is terrible every songletime.

I chose the tacos above, but I'm not sure if I got the right plate as one of my meats was super sweet. I think it was the beef? It was hard to tell as everything ended up melded together in the take out container. I ended up liking the chicken the best as it was tender and had the best flavor. The cod was disappointing. Mostly batter and not much fish. A coworker of mine ordered the Chile con Queso ($9.95) which I was really excited about. But it was rather thin and not very cheesy. Kind of like a thicker soup. I was disappointed as I wanted it be cheesier. I asked for lots of sides of salsa, but they didn't include much, so not sure if they give you complimentary salsa with your tacos or not. I like A LOT of salsa with my tacos.\n\nI've been to the Tacolicious in the Marina and I remember thinking it was pricey for what it was. I felt the same way about this location.

Finally we were greeted and got seated 15 minutes later even though there was no wait and the restaurant wasn't busy. Once seated we sat, with our 3 small children while no one came to our table for at least 10 minutes. At this point we had one kids menu and no crayons. Our kids were starving and going nuts after 30 minutes of no progress beyond sitting down at a table. Eventually we got some water and chips and salsa and put in our orders asap. I have food allergies and needed answers to a few questions before ordering but the answers were vague and uncertain so I played it safe with an $18 salad that was so bland. The lights were too dark to see our food and the music was so loud it was difficult to hear each other. We ran out of water part way through the meal and the server never even came back to check how our food was, let alone refill our drinks. Our kids drinks came in the middle of their meal and then we had to remind the server a couple of times to bring out the ice cream. A manager came at the end and said they forgot to make an adjustment to our bill so I assumed maybe they were going to discount it for the horrendous service, but nope, she brought the check back exactly the same as it had been before. \nAlso, we took our children to the bathroom and the toilet paper and paper towels were both gone and the floor was littered with garbage. \nAll-in-all this restaurant fell very far short of the modest expectations we had.

I ordered the plate of 4 tacos. I had the steak, chicken, and carnitas. The steak was cold and not worth eating. The carnitas was hot and really delicious. The chicken was luke warm and seemed to be way too moist of some sort of juices. The hot sauce was good along with the carnitas tacos. I would probably not come back due to the lack of service and cold to warm food.", "author": "Jason D."}

Despite our large party of 8, we were immediately seated (we called ahead which helped!) We were greeted by endless bowls of chips and a not-so friendly waitress who seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else...\n\nWe each ordered two tacos and were served a bowl of guacomole for the table. Since none of us ordered the guac we assumed it was complimentary and began to eat. It wasn't until we were half way through that we noticed that guac was actually on the menu for $10! \n\nWhile the tacos were delicious, the aftermath of Tacolicious was not so. About an hour after eating there all of us started to feel some sort of way. I ended up getting sick as a result of what I believe to be the fish tacos I ordered... Maybe I have a sensitive stomach, but the fact that we all felt sick to our stomaches was not the best sign...

The place is great for groups of people, which is probably why people from work always recommend coming here. And there is a full bar. Seems like a great place for happy hour if you ask me (except I haven't actually been here for happy hour). It's definitely a great place to socialize over food and drinks. \n\nThe times I've gone here, I've gotten the 'Guajillo Braised Beef' tacos and the 'Traditional Carnitas'. The meat in both of these tacos were very flavorful and tender. Each taco is about five bucks each, which seems a little expensive if you ask me. But you can get four tacos for $17.95 which comes to about $4.50 per taco and ten tacos for $39.95 which comes to $4 per taco-- now this price seems a little more reasonable. The tacos are definitely exceptional and the salsas that come with your meal are great! I usually try to not eat too many tortilla chips so I don't get too full before my meal, but the salsas were so good, they made it hard to stop. Since each taco comes with two corn tortillas, I'm always able to split the two corn tortillas and divide the meat to make my one taco into two tacos since there is always enough meat to do so (am I the only one who does this?).\n\nI probably wouldn't come here on my own.

If you have had real authentic tacos from the various Mexican restaurants in SF you will know why this place doesn't even compare. Like honestly one taco is 5 dollars.... Like what is it made out of? Gold? When I can get 5 tacos for 5 dollars somewhere else. I do have to give it to them that their sauces are really good and also their tortilla chips but that's basically it. The wait was over an hour. I thought it was going to be more efficient and less of a wait since they text you when your table is ready. I came back here after 45 mins and they said that they texted me but I received no text what so ever.. So they gave my table to someone else.. And I received their text after waiting 15 mins inside the restaurant when I came back... So overall wait was an hour and maybe more\n\nFor the food: I didn't think the tacos were that amazing to come back because they are pretty expensive but I did really like the fish tacos (cod) and the carnitas were also good. Their deal was 10 for 40 I think and I still think 4 dollars for one taco is still way over priced. \n\nOverall: servers were really nice but the wait and the cost killed this place for me. I really wanted to like this place since I saw so many yummy pictures of the tacos but overall this place was disappointing.

I'm all for paying $4 per taco, but it better be a BOMB taco. The tacos at Tacolicious were just downright underwhelming, and even inedible for my standards. I came with a group of 4 and we ordered a total of 20 tacos (2 orders of the 10 plates), and within that assortment of 20 we pretty much tried every taco on their menu, including their \"taco of the week\". I liked the carnitas the best, but it was in no means impressive. It was just the best of a bunch of meh tacos. On the other hand, I literally could not eat the fish taco. I'm not sure if they fry all the fish at a certain point of the day and leave them under a heat lamp, but when I bit into the taco the only thing I could taste was stale oil. I'm uncertain of if there was actually any fish under all the batter. It was really bad. \n\nWith all that said, if I could, I'd still give this place 2.5 stars because the service was pretty good, the ambiance was hip, and the servings were pretty generous. But in terms of the quality of the food, I was incredibly unimpressed, and felt very much robbed when I paid over $30 for 5 tacos that were not very good.

Not sure if they marinated the meat at all or just not long enough or maybe the meats were just overcooked. All plausible theories, but also just speculation. As I mentioned I used a hefty amount of salsa to try to compensate lack of flavor and dryness, but to my surprise (not really) the salsas were just mediocre. Not spicy at all and barely any flavor. I don't think I will be trying this place again.\n\nAmbiance: clean, large space, modern and hip decor. Basically the opposite of an authentic or true Mexican hole in the wall restaurant. \n\nService: Inattentive and unpleasant. I don't think the busy boy/waitress woman liked that I kept asking for lime, water, etc. \n\nPrice: When in SF, you just accept high prices, but this was just too much. The food wasn't pleasant, service was equally unpleasant, I really wish I didn't spend so much. \n\nOverall: This place is not authentic at all.

They served my party and I in a quick, polite and efficient manner. The Stockton St. Tacolicious crew was extremely accommodating, (the Valencia location is a kind of all over the place, it takes forever to get seated). \n\nFood:\nTACOS TACOS TACOS. My favorite are the traditional carnitas and Shot-and-a-beer Braised Chicken tacos. They were so filling and ridiculously satisfying. Pricing is as follows:\n\n1 For     3.95\n4 For     14.00\n10 For    33.00\n\nWe were a party of 4 and we ordered 8 tacos, we were all full by the end of the meal. Don't let these tacos fool you, they are packed with meat aka you will get full sooner than expected. If you visit Tacolicious you also have to order the Guacamole even though it's an extra 8 bucks. Trust me, you will not regret.\n \nService:\nLike stated before, I found that this location had a better sense of customer service when compared to my experiences at the Valencia and Marina locations. From the servers, to the chefs, everyone at this location was incredibly sweet and welcoming. Thumbs up for that.\n\nAtmosphere:\nI visited on a Friday night, so it was definitely lively and pretty packed. However, the wait for a table wasn't too insane.

The accompanying salsas were also all delicious and complex, it was really fun to mix/match them with the different tacos. \n\nIf you're nearby and lackluster service doesn't particularly bother you, then I would say that this place is worth a try just because the tacos are pretty delicious. But personally, the only time I'd come to Tacolicious again is if I try a different location in a gamble for some better service.", "author": "Desiree S."}

It was refreshing and just a little bit sweet. \n\nWe had some guacamole to start which was really great too. I'm a complete sucker for tortilla chips and these didn't disappoint. \n\nThen we had tacos. Oh lord, so many tacos. \n\nThe Baja Style Pacific Cod was awesome. Fresh, light, flaky. Guajillo Braised Beef Short Rib was unreal. So well cooked and bursting with flavor. Chicken En Mole Colorado was awesome. I'm not usually much of a chicken fan, but these are moist and delicious.

I like the flaky fish with it's crispy batter exterior but it's well balanced with the cabbage and creamy sauce. No taco meal for me is complete without carnitas and they do it pretty well at Tacolicious but the edge goes to mom and pop taquerias on this one. \n\nThe veggie taco is also really good here with the amalgamation of flavors from the asparagus to the oyster mushrooms to the garlic.

I used to go to the tacolicious in Marina often and got really excited when they finally opened a location in North Beach, but it's not the same. Several issues:\n\n1) way under staffed. The manager has maybe 2 servers during peak eating hours. I understand the trade off by maximizing profit, but the wait times are not ideal.\n\n2) what do you do to compensate for the lack of staff? It seems you make tacos ahead of time to meet demand. So when I order 4 tacos, they're not hot, the tortilla is not fresh and the fried cod is cold. WTF? \n\n3) to make matters worse, you charge 5% for \"San Francisco health tax.\" Okay, cool but now I'm subsidizing the fact you underpay your staff and there is a lack of them, so I feel I am taking the hit twice.\n\n4) you keep raising prices. I am aware of this city's inflation and how businesses have gone out of business due to the lack of rent control. But $18 for 4 cold tacos with cold tortillas? No thanks.\n\n5) margaritas aren't that great either. Sorry staff, but I expected so much more.", "author": "Karl A."}

They do bring out three more additional salsas (mild, medium and hot) with the tacos but my preference was the chunky salsa that came out with the chips. I shared a bunch of tacos which were loaded with fish/meat. We got the following flavors: fried local rock cod, shot-and-a-beer braised chicken, traditional carnitas, guajillo braised beef short rib, and house-made chorizo and potatoes. My favorites were the rock cod (hunk of cod with a crunchy batter) and the braised chicken (moist, super flavorful and saucy) tacos. I wasn't very impressed with the other three flavors but it really depends on what tickles your fancy.\n\nService was spotty. I didn't even realize there was a hostess until we were leaving so I don't think she did a very good job of greeting folks but she at least smiled and thanked us when we left. The bartender just simply took our order and gave us the bill.

We witnessed a male line cook on his phone showing his co-workers Instagram or Snap videos, without gloves (as a dude, I have a hunch that phone has made a trip or two to the can with him), then go back to prepping food\n\n-On one visit, we asked three different employees very politely to please turn on the Warriors game, and then basically we were ignored (i.e. never got the game on and it was not busy. No one was watching anything else that would have taken precedence). PS...It's SF, you have three TV's in there. Make an effort to know when your local teams are playing. The fact that you have multiple TV's is your only advantage over Don Pisto's (another taco place around the corner that's great) especially when a local team is on.\n\nThis all being said, I'm lazy and live close by so I'll probably end up here again at some point.

Just don't bring the kids. \n\nI also had my first Spicy Beer here. I wanted a Michelada -- a real one with just beer, lime and salt -- but they didn't have that version, so I went for something different and ended up breathing fire for the rest of the night.

I finished my tacos and waited...and waited.\n\nMy tacos had been finished for a good 15 minutes, he finally came back and asked if I needed anything else. I told him what I would LIKE is a lime for my beer and the salsa from back when I ordered my food, but what I NEED is my check because it had been over an hour and 10 minutes and all I have to show for it is two tacos, and I had to go. Got my check, he said the beer was on him and apologized for how long things took (the kitchen was lightning fast, only he took long). In reality the beer was not on him because I was leaving, and did not end up having a beer, or water, or any beverage of any kind. Ironic because I was sitting at the bar!!\n\nThis location has a couple of solid servers, but the bar is always an awkward place to sit because it is always just the staff socializing in full earshot of the customers. Your not there to hang out, your there to work. \n\nThe food is great though, that's the only thing the North Beach has in common with the other locations.", "author": "Jeff C."}

The seating here is \"modern\", personally I don't think their stools are comfortable or the way their tables are so high. Anyway, to start off we ordered guac and we ordered I think 13 tacos. From reading reviews and hearing how sometimes you have to wait over an hour to eat here, I wasn't impressed. Don't get me wrong, it was good but it wasn't amazing where I have to come back. \nWe also had desert, churros and I think the flan.

I opted for the sangria roja (red wine + fruit + spicy apple salsa wuuut?) which was sweet and lightly spicy.\n\nFree chips + salsa right when we sat down. Oh haaaaaaail yea. These are thicker corn chips which are my FAVORITE and they are fried in-house, even better! Thick corn chips FTW! This is going to be my new fav spot mainly because of the chips itself. Hahah.. Yummy salsa and chips which just kept coming even when we didn't ask. Woot. They have hella worker bees!!\n\nThe place may get loud but not annoying-ly so. Tall tables with tall chairs (as a short person, I love this!) Lots of menu items at decent prices. Salads for the health conscious as welll!\n\nAt first glance, $14 for 4 tacos was expensive.. (c'mon if you go to ACTUAL Mexican restaurants they're like $2 each). They really stack up the filling here though and it IS slightly fusion food. In the end it was pretty worth it since I got started getting full after 3 tacos (WELL, maybe it was because I gorged on the chips too, lol). We got 8 tacos (1 of each + the special).\nMy favorite was the rock cod and and chorizo with potatoes. The chicken one was a close third (super juicy + flavorful) and my LEAST favorite was by far, the short rib one (it was a bit dry and overcooked, didn't help that we ate that one last too..)\nOverall, pretty awesome.

Everything---from decor, vibe, flatware, napkins, plates are the same as the other locations except, to my utter delight, they don't blast the music here like they do on Valencia. The clientele is also different, a mix of tourists, older locals, and less of the hipster scene.\n\nTacolicious doesn't dish out authentic tacos although they are tasty. We pretty much get the same thing to see if they are consistent with quality. They don't disappoint!\n\n*Grilled rock cod tacos: always love the tangy spicy sauce. But for the first time we're offered the \"grilled\" option, which was not available previous on Valencia or Chestnut. Fish was very fresh.\n\n*Shot-of-beer Chicken taco: I think this is their signature item. It actually tastes a bit like the chicken taco at Lolo. I always get this when I'm here. \n\n*Guajillo-braised beef short rib tacos: very strong favored, but tender short ribs in tacos. Perfect with the yellow hot sauce. This has been a hit-or-miss at the other locations but the new location seems to have got this right. Not overly salty and no spices caked on the meat.\n\nOverall this is a nice alternative in North Beach if you're not into pretentious, touristy Italian and mediocre Chinese food.

I would tell everyone to AVOID this location.\n\n1) THE FOOD IS HORRIBLE\n- So, so, so SUPER salty! It was as though I was sucking on a salt shaker! \n- DRY, DRY, HELLA MUTHA EFFIN' DRY! How old is the meat in these tacos? The short ribs were simply dry chunks of yuck. The duck was made up of hard strings of meat chips! WHAAAATHEFUDGEEEEE?!\n\n2) ZERO, NON-EXISTANT, BEYOND HORRIBLE SERVICE\n- Our waitress, a younger blond woman, was totally oblivious to customers. She was going to look for an extra chair. Never looked for one. Never mentioned it. One person in our party ended up leaving.\n- Sat there for a good 10-15 minutes without any acknowledgement after being seated. I had to ask several times if I could give her my order! WHAT THE HELL?!!!\n- Asked for water, 20 minutes later, had to ask again...and again. WTF?! The food was so incredibly salty, I probably needed buckets of water!\n- I was given a MAC lipliner (by a woman who wasn't my server) to sign off on my credit card receipt! This was actually pretty funny and the highlight of my experience here.\n- I don't know how busy they were inside, but the quality of the service outside sucked beyond words. If they were understaffed, then they have management issues which still deserve a sh:tty review. No matter what, they are deserving of a negative review. \n- I will say that there were a couple of guys towards the end, who stepped in to help some of the customers, and they were far more efficient than the ladies that work there--THE LONE STAR IS FOR THEM.\n\n3) THEY WILL OVERCHARGE YOU\n- I was with my 90 year old grandmother. I asked if they could make a Virgin drink, basically, soda water but with the fruit juice and fruit added to it...they charged it as a full cocktail--$15!!! ALCOHOL is what drives drink prices to what they are. To charge $15 for soda water with some pomegranate seeds thrown in is so F-CKING RIDICULOUS! WHAT THE F-CK B1TCHES?!!! THEY CAN HAVE THAT $15, BUT THEY ARE NEVER GETTING ANOTHER PENNY FROM ME NOR ANYONE WHO WILL HEED MY ADVICE TO AVOID THIS LOCATION!\n\nDespite their sh:tty @ss service, I still tipped my personal minimum of 15%, because that's how I roll as someone who worked as a food/beverage server in my teens and early 20's, but I totally cringed at writing that tip in. They are very lucky for Yelp, because I was able to hold my temper and tip them, with the satisfaction of knowing I would leave them a negative Yelp review later.\n\nI HATE THIS RESTAURANT. THE PLACE SUCKS FAR WORSE THAN ANY PLACE I HAVE BEEN TO IN THE PAST 10 YEARS!

It's an upscale, hip, but casual place to get tacos and drinks basically.\n\nThe 4 taco combo is quite filling, especially if you load up on the free chips and salsa. I recommend the carnitas tacos and the chicken tacos. The short rib tacos are pretty rich and heavy while the fish taco is deep fried and way heavier than I imagined it would be. The agua fresca is quite refreshing too.\n\nService is a bit hit or miss here.

There are plenty worthy places for that in the Mission.\n\nReasons to like:\n\n- Menu is broad (not just tacos) and ingredients are fresh. I highly recommend the squid appetizer and the kale salad. The spice options (hot, mild, chipotle only) are well done. The tacos are tasty and fill you up more than you'd think from the size.\n\n- Cocktails are great- the piccante margarita is a love it or hate it drink (try it).\n\nIssues:\n\n- If you're on the high stools, the seating isn't that comfortable.\n\n- It can get very, very noisy in here. More of a party atmosphere than a date-destination. And yes, the crowd can get a bit douchy (it's better than the Marina location).\n\nTo my mind the main question is whether you feel you're getting bang for your buck here.

To be clear, nothing was amazingly bad; but, the overwhelming mediocrity of the place combined with slightly overpriced offerings will most likely send me straight to the Mission instead of Tacolicious when I'm looking for taco satisfaction.\n\nTwo of my friends and I sauntered in (yes sauntered) on a Saturday afternoon and it was completely empty, which I thought was amazing.  However, I've heard the place gets super packed for happy hour/night time drinking and it's clear by the set up this is what they're catering for (high tables with stools, lots of standing space). \n\nService was....odd. Everyone was friendly and our waitress helped suggest menu items and got us more chips/limes/etc without complaint, but they were so fast to clear our table and provide the check that it felt like they were rushing us. Clearly, since there were only two other parties in the restaurant, they were most likely not trying to get rid of us. I can't tell if they were just super bored or if they normally are trying to provide fast turnover during high traffic times. They also are very stingy with portions of free stuff (they gave us two lime wedges for ten tacos and roughly a Tablespoon of each salsa for 3 people). Admittedly, the waitress had no problem getting more for us and this way we didn't waste food, but I would have liked to not have to ask for extras of everything and feel even more annoying than I already am.\n\nAnd for the most important thing, the food: Meh, with a capital M.\n\nWe tried amongst the 3 of us: fish taco, chorizo taco, short rib taco, carnitas taco, cactus taco, and guacamole.\n\nThe fish and the short rib were by far the best tacos and the only ones we would actually reorder. They were very filling, good quality of meat, and had a huge portion of protein for a street taco, but they still were a little bland. I slathered them with our guacamole, the lime and their salsas and they were still missing some spice. I think if their salsas were better, it would be more enjoyable, but the tablespoon of spicy habanero salsa they provided for the three of us tasted like nothing. The chorizo and carnitas and guacamole were just alright, but nothing special. (and the guacamole was $9 for maybe a cup of dip :/ ). The cactus taco was downright bad, and I highly suggest not ordering it. At the end of the meal, we paid $19 each for three tacos and some guacamole. Not sure if that was worth the price.\n\nIn conclusion, I think you're supposed to come here for the drinks and then after a few you'll be less finicky about the value/quality of the food.", "author": "Christina R."}

They have some weekly tacos, which I always add to my order. The tacos are quite cheap but they get pricey fast when you add chips and guacamole and some margaritas.  Its an easy $50 plus bill with me and a friend or two.\n\nEven though I think the guacamole is over priced, it is really good. The fish tacos are amazing and also their taco of the week and I say that in faith. \n\nMy friends like to order several tacos and then cut them in half. Why?

They do have other fun inventive flavored ones but why go against the best?\n\nYou don't really go there too much for the ambiance. If you go to the one in North Beach, you can people watch if that is your thing. The one at Chestnut is uber tiny and does have a small section for outdoor seating. You also get to see what the cooks and bartenders are doing behind the counter and ensure they are not doing anything weird to your order. At Valencia, they do have outdoor seating, its not to the street but looking at other tables to see what they've ordered. Plus, the place is dimly lit there that you may go home with people you didn't come in with.\n\nThe most horrible thing about it is that they don't have locations outside of SF.. cause guess what I want when I'm not in the city..

The braised short rib was very tender and flavorful! And they piled that beef on. No shortage there!\n\nI'm a HUGE fan of chips and salsa and their salsa is awesome! They add mint (!) to their salsa, which gives it a nice refreshing kick. Never had that before so it was a great surprise. Definitely loved that taste.

Here goes nothing:\n\nLOCATION: Right in the heart of North Beach (pro and con). It is within one block of the 45, 41, 8X, and 30 bus lines. NOT good for driving/parking (it's non-existent). If you do not take public transportation, Lyft/Uber/Sidecar/Flywheel/Taxi is HIGHLY recommended\n\nAMBIANCE: It's a small dining area and bar, which can get crowded quite quickly, especially during happy hour and weekends (not atypical of ANY North Beach establishment). The noise level can get quite loud, but would not attribute it to the music. People start drinking and start yelling and the tile floors do not help. \n\nSERVICE/STAFF: Generally, everyone is really great. If it's busy, you can tell they are hustling and trying to accommodate everyone. I'm a realist and don't need them to wait on me hand and foot, although I do get antsy when my chip bowl gets empty ;-) I have been fortunate enough to hit the restaurant at the right times - have not had to wait more than a couple minutes for a place to sit.\n\nDRINKS: Mmmm, the Sangria and Margaritas are delicious! It's on my list to try the Chupitos next!\n\nFOOD: The go-to for me and my boyfriend is 4 tacos (for $14, $2 off v. single tacos) and Chile Con Queso (TO DIE FOR). All the taco varieties are heavenly, but my party and I generally stick to carnitas and shrimp. If we're in the drinking mood, we'll go for the Prix Fixe which is: one taco, one generous shot of tequila, and one can of Tecate ($15 value)\n\nTO-GO: I have periodically ordered to-go and service is incredibly fast.

We return approx 30 minutes later and are told the same thing.\nUmm okay. . .\nThe game game is on so we visit another one of of our fave bars in the area and this time return 45 mins later.\nAt this point it is blantantly obvious the guy that talked with us in the begining is lazy-eyed drunk(along with most of the staff at the bar) and slurring his words \"another 15 more minutes\" There was no way we were waiting around again to be served by this crew.\nHey, if you're closed just say so. Show some respect for your customers.\nWon't be returning. . .", "author": "Kia B."}

The food is good, but poor service made it the worst dining experience I've ever had. \n\nThe waitress who served (Ella) us was very condescending and we felt like we were intruding rather than being her (paying!) guests. She seemed to be annoyed by the fact that a colleague had a special dietary requests (dairy free). She walked away from our table in the middle of taking our order, because we had questions about the menu, promised to be right back, but in fact she returned over 5 minutes later and in the meantime managed to take an order from another table. The same happened when we requested the check - another table requested the check after us and got it immediately, we had to wait for our check much longer and then another 10 minutes to for someone to run our card. Our drink order was mixed up (we specifically ordered everything with no ice, when the drinks arrived with ice and we asked to have them replaced, the waitress did not apologize and only seemed to be annoyed by that) and we were continuously neglected during the stay (she was approaching all other tables, but not ours, and since she was not even looking in our direction, it was impossible to attract her attention). \nThe waitress only had a couple of other tables in her section, so I really can't find an excuse for her to neglect us in such a way, and there is absolutely no excuse for her to be rude and condescending. \n\nNeedless to say, we will not be coming back. The area has a lot of other workday lunch options and Tacolicious lost 3 potential regulars.", "author": "Ela P."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2014-06-22", "description": "On Saturday, 6/21/14, my girlfriend and I decided to go eat at Tacolicious in San Francisco located in North Beach for lunch. I've heard a lot of positive things about Tacolicious and I've really been craving Mexican food so we made it happen. Read on to see how it went. \n\nAtmosphere/Decor:\n\nTacolicious is located right next to Tony's Pizza which is in a nice area. When you walk up to Tacolicious you will see outdoor dining tables. This is a great option especially when the weather is nice or when you want to sit outside and eat on a nice summer day. The interior of the restaurant is pretty nice. It has a nice open floor plan. Once you walk in to the restaurant you will see a nice sized bar to the right with plenty of alcohol options. The tables are pretty modern. Each table is set up where one person will sit on a large sized grey stool structure and the other person will sit on the the other side which is more like half of a booth seat. The wooden tables felt a little bit unstable. I only saw a few tables where you could sit about 4 to 6 people. They also play pretty loud music but you can still hold a conversation without the music taking over. The music playlist was mixed with various types of songs. I also liked how you can see into the open kitchen located towards the rear of the restaurant. Overall, the restaurant was well designed. \n\nFood: \n\nMy girlfriend and I decided to go with the 10 tacos for $33. We ordered 3 guajillo braised beef short rib tacos, 3 traditional carnitas tacos, 2 shot-and-a-beer braised chicken tacos and 2 house-made chorizo and potato tacos. All of the tacos came with the traditional cilantro and onions. Let me start off by saying that each and every taco was packed with a lot of meat! These tacos aren't skimpy at all! The short rib tacos were okay. I've had better shredded beef tacos. They were good but lacking in flavor. A little bit of added salt would have helped. The carnitas tacos were good. They didn't taste like traditional carnitas to me but they still had a nice simple flavor. The beer braised chicken tacos were my favorite. Too bad my girlfriend and I only ordered one each. The shredded chicken was packed with a lot of flavor and the chicken was very tender. The chorizo and potatoes were my least favorite. The chorizo didn't taste like traditional chorizo. There wasn't that much flavor to the chorizo nor was it spicy. It actually wasn't spicy at all. The tacos weren't bad at all it's just certain tacos lacked flavor. We also ordered a side of semi-traditional refried beans with cotija cheese and a side of rice-o-licious with mojo verde. The beans and rice were pretty good. All of the food was very fresh and I felt clean after I ate it. Usually when I eat Mexican food I get really bloated and feel heavy. I didn't feel that way after eating at Tacolicious.\n\nService:\n\nThe service was really good. Our waitress actually greeted us when we walked in and sat us down at our table. She took our order within a few minutes. We were brought chips, salsa and water very quickly. All of the employees seemed very friendly. \n\nOverall: \n\nTacolicious is a pretty good place to get a variety of fresh tacos. Each taco is loaded with a lot of meat. It's different compared to authentic Mexican or American Mexican food. In my opinion most of the tacos were lacking flavor except for the carnitas and chicken tacos. If you're craving tacos and are in the North Beach neighborhood, give Tacolicious a try.", "author": "David R."}

I had just received the Tacolicious cookbook from my mother-in-law, so naturally coming here with her was really special.  We were seated right away at their bar tables and were approached by a waitress almost immediately. Baskets on baskets of tortilla chips and salsa were provided within sitting down as well, and it turned into this basket that never seemed to have a bottom. Since there were 7 of us, we ended up ordering a fair amount of food...as in, 30 tacos, two orders of guacamole, and an order of the grilled squid veracruz. As always, my favorite taco here is the carnitas.  Surprisingly, the taco of the day was probably the most disappointing despite it having bacon in it. We passed on dessert because everyone left here absolutely satisfied and insanely full. Tacolicious is fairly consistent when it comes to delicious tacos, and its North Beach establishment is no different than the other two places I had been to before.  I loved here and wouldn't mind going back!", "author": "Lisa I."}

The quality of service just isn't there and both times we ended up waiting rather awkward lengths of time without drinks (nothing puts a damper on tacos like empty margarita glasses). The sound is also pretty atrocious here. On a busy night, you can hardly hear the person sitting across the table from you because there's just nothing to absorb the noise. \n\nHowever - when we've gone on slower nights and sat at the bar, the experience has been great. The barstaff is friendly and charming, they know their tequila and the service is on point. Plus, you can actually carry on a conversation with your date!\n\nI love the ceviche here, and the fish tacos are pretty great as well.", "author": "Caroline M."}

(I love me some Tacolicious but the one in the Marina is always so crowded and while the location in the Mission is nice, we just don't venture that way very much anymore.) \n\nFast forward to yesterday when I officially received a job offer and couldn't think of anywhere else I'd rather celebrate than the new Tacolicious location. Delicious margaritas and tacos? Yes please.\n\nMy guy and I arrived around 8ish for dinner and were seated right away. Chips and delicious salsa were placed in front of us as we perused the menu. We started off with a pitcher (probably not necessary) of margarita picante (a favorite) as well as the albacore tuna tostadas \"contramar-style\" per our waitress' recommendation. We decided to go with the 4 for 14 deal and ordered 2 fried local rock cod tacos, 1 house-made chorizo and potatoes taco and 1 guajillo braised beef short rib taco. While the fried cod is always delicious, we decided that the chorizo and the short rib tacos were definitely the winners. The fried cod seemed to have a higher batter to fish ratio than we prefer, but it's still tasty.\n\nWe decided that this is definitely our favorite location not only because it's within walking distance of our apartment but also because of the size and layout of the restaurant. It feels much more spacious and open than the others. We definitely plan to make many return visits, there's a lot of delicious looking eats and drinks that I still want to try.", "author": "Emily S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-07-13", "description": "Reasons for the 3 stars:\n\n- 1 for the lack of tables. It's a big restaurant, but you'll notice that there are a lot of 2 seaters that they put together for larger groups. IMO, a few more tables can easily be added to reduce the wait time.\n\n- 1 for the bar service while you're waiting to be seated. During my experience, I was waiting at the bar to get two beers. Two of the three bartenders were working on table orders leaving one dude to man the bar. Took about 8 minutes before the one bartender could get my drink, but when I was seated, I ordered a drink and literally got it within a minute. Here's a suggestion - people that are seated can wait a little bit for their drink since they're already seated. Keep the people waiting for their tables happy since the wait takes a while.\n\nOther observations from a Friday night:\n\nFood: The food was great. The only taco that seemed a little off was the Chorizo taco - it just didn't have that much flavor.\n\nAtmosphere: I couldn't tell if the music was loud, or if the crowd was louder. Just be prepared to talk loudly, or repeat yourself during a conversation.\n\nWaiter Service: Excellent, no complaints.\n\nNote: This has nothing to do with the restaurant, but let me just say...Blondes, blondes everywhere.", "author": "Alfonzo J."}

Great chips and salsa trio. Great beers on tap. Great service. The tacos are very solid as well. They are sized somewhere between street tacos and full-size tacos, but are very tasty and satisfying.

I asked the hostess a table for 4, she said it would be one and a half to two hours, which looked strange considering that there were many empty tables and just a few people standing, but I said ok, let's wait and see if maybe it gets faster. After 10 minutes I got the text message saying that my table was ready. How can you misestimate the wait time that much? What if I had decided to go somewhere else and get a drink while I was waiting for my hour and a half? Whatever... As I went to her, I discovered that she put down a table for 2, although we clearly said that it was for 4, but she was only able to say that we would need to wait again for a new table for 4 to open up! The funny thing is that there were at least 3 tables for 4 empty at that moment and no one waiting for them, and she couldn't fix her mistake by giving us one of those tables... Besides the hostess, we also had some other unpleasant incidents with other employees, which makes me think that this place needs to reevaluate how they treat their guests.

Let's see, in short these were the major issues:\n\n1. Seated right away due to a pretty empty restaurant, so food will come out fast right? Nope, 2.5 hrs later and we finally get our 10 tacos.\n\n2. Tacos were lukewarm. Maybe they microwaved them...in 2.5 hrs. The beef short rib tacos are my favorite, I've had them at least a dozen times at various locations. They came out rock hard/dry, cold, and fatty with no seasoning. \n\n3. Chips were stale.\n\n4. Service--- doesn't exist, it took only 30 min to get a menu and we never saw our server again. They didn't even get the order correct, but our party was so done by that point to care. We just wanted to GTFO.\n\nWTF is going on at this place. If I was blindfolded and served the food, I would have never guessed I was eating at tacolicious. One of our friend's said \"this is just like Yabo's tacos in Columbus\" as a compliment...that's when you know it's bad, Yabo's is horrible. Tacolicous should never be compared to such a place...\n\nThe mission is insanely busy on weekends, but at least the food is great. Just go on a Sunday if you can or a weekday. In fact I went the very next day given my experience here, to get my taco fix and make sure I wasn't dreaming. It was like going to an entirely different restaurant. Sure we had to wait for a table for 15 min, but at least it was worth it....unlike this location. I normally give places two tries (in case it's an off day), but this one is out in one when there is no shortage of other locations.", "author": "Puneet S."}

Service- Very poor. Our food came out promptly but was just dumped on the table by a food runner. There was no explanation of the different tacos or salsas. We didn't know whose order belonged to who. The food was cold. We wanted to get it heated up but couldn't find our server, she never stopped in after to ask how the food was. It took 20 mins to find someone to run our card. I had to ask the staff to remove dirty plates. I think only 1 server was working and the food runners were not being quite helpful. There were two guys behind the bar hanging out, not sure why one of them couldn't help her out.\n2. Traditional carnitas was very greasy and lacking flavor. Probably would have been better hot. The fish tacos were also generic. The huevos rancheros was satisfactory as was the short rib. \n3. The margs were disappointing. Not worth the $10. Visit Nopalito, or the Chestnut tacolicious for better margs! \n\nI will never return, so many better options", "author": "Lisa M."}

The patio is great for eating outside and the bar is always vibrant and lively Thursday-Saturday night. It is a super trendy spot filled with Paul Madona artwork.

They recently had a vegi taco of the week that was perfect for my roommate (in addition to the vegi taco permanently on the menu). The taco of the week rotates - every one I have tried has been unique and tasty :) The marina girl salad is a great lighter option as well.

It's a roasted tomato salsa with mint added, which takes it to a really special place.  The rest of the food was good.  Unusual things to try, mostly well-executed.   There were a couple vegetarian options, and they were good, but a place like this could easily have more than the couple.  I thought the only vegetarian option for beans was good but a bit boring.  Cocktails were good, we tried a couple of their signature drinks and enjoyed them.  Table are very close and it gets loud.  Service was okay, not great, though our bartender was very personable.  The food was good and I would definitely go again.  Tony's Pizza next door is a huge draw and doesn't take reservations, and the waits are usually 1-2 hours.  For now, Tacolicious is much less crowded and we spent some time at the bar there waiting for our table at Tony's.  We also diverted there for lunch instead of Tony's on one visit, and it was a nice alternative.  Definitely follow your meal at either place with gelato from Naia across the street - best gelato anywhere!!", "author": "Robyn B."}

I've been here a couple times already and like most of the food (and service the previous time was 'ok') IMO, the ambiance and atmosphere are exactly what this neighborhood needed.\n\nBUT the service at the bar?  Are you f r e a k i n g kidding me?? \n\nThere were two young male bartenders on duty (Monday night) I simply couldn't believe the complete lack of service and attention to ALL the customers, not just us.  These guys clearly didn't care about their customers at all.  Ordering seemed to be a privilege that bartender #1 reluctantly granted to me.  Once the food arrived, not ONCE did they ask if any of our food was ok or if we needed anything.  In fact I really wanted to send one thing back because it was cold but I couldn't get their attention, so I just ate it cold!  We would have also drank a lot more but they never noticed our empty glasses or asked us what we'd like next.  Imagine that, at a bar!?  They don't even make eye contact with the thirsty customers or notice when glasses are completely empty!  Wow.  One customer next to me was trying to pay their bill for at least 15-20 mins, poor girl.  It was good to see though that the bartenders enjoyed several shots shared and cheered between themselves during this time.  I guess they were toasting mediocrity, indifference, or the fact that they were so lucky to con somebody into giving them this job.\n\nNote to Management:  You have a great restaurant in a great location.  Don't screw it up by hiring such ungrateful non service oriented d-bags for \"bartenders\".  This kind of service might fly in the marina, but to adults in North beach, it's offensive.", "author": "Kyle K."}

Whether coming with a huge party at night or for a business lunch during the work day, the ambiance allows for any type of rendezvous. \n\nBeing a vegetarian can make it challenging to find filling and delicious mexican food that isn't drowning in sour cream and guacamole. However at Tacolicious there are a number of options for vegetarians that actually have flavor and can fill me up. They switch up the combination/flavors of the vegetarian tacos seasonally and they are always out of this world.\n\nThe Queso with their warm chips is sinfully delicious...because it is liquid gold, and that is always one of the first things to get devoured when I go with groups.\n\nLet's not forget to mention the drinks...the Nopal pitcher is a personal staple however you cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Nothing is from a mix, all of the cocktails are fresh because they use fresh fruits and amazing combinations (so no hangovers!) I literally watched them cut over 50 blood oranges for their fresca once!\n\nIt is hard to put into words what makes this Tacolicious in particular stand out against it's peers in the mission and marina, but I think it can be attributed to the service. The servers always makes sure to personalize each group's experience and continually check in to make sure everyone in your party is well taken care of/having a great time. \n\nThere is so much more to say about this wonderful place that a review can't do it justice, but after writing this I'm officially hungry and heading there for dinner again tonight!", "author": "Alison G."}

When we finally got our menus, they ignored us and did not even offer water. Nevertheless, hunger propelled us further into the dining experience. After ordering our meals, we were highly disappointed by the quality of the food. The tacos were drenched in grease, the sangria was worse, and we were all wondering why it was that we were spending $5.00 per taco. We couldn't even finish the six tacos, so I mentioned to the bus boy that we were honestly disappointed and whether we could do something about it. He proceeded to tell me that I could take the tacos I was complaining about home. After I asked repeatedly to speak to someone, he went ahead and decided to speak about me to his coworker in Spanish, obviously unaware that I could understand him ( including the moment he called me a bitch).

Best decision! We both had an order of the Lone Star Tacos and they were fantastic! It was like a breakfast burrito in a flour taco. The tortilla seemed homemade, not exactly sure, but it was great. The peppers added with the egg, melted Oaxaca Cheese, and other ingredients really pumped up the flavor. We also shared a Margarita with coconut water and that was also good. The chips are quite basic, as well as the salsa, but overall, not bad at all. I'm not too sure how the other restaurants are like, but because this one is in a fairly busy touristy area, the place can be a bit crowded, but not overwhelming.

The chips and salsa were fantastic - there was some Indian type spice in the salsa - cant pin point what it is - but tasty. Wasn't in the mood to drink liquor so I had a Silas - lemon, lime, mint, fizzy water - hit the spot.    Side note - good music - would be a good bar to visit and get food. Would have been a five if they had a wider menu with a few more taco options. Service  was friendly and  prompt.", "author": "Paras P."}

I walked in with a friend and we both stood there for a good 5 minutes before anyone even thought about saying anything to us. Actually, my friend had to walk up to someone to get any service. Then the hostess seats us at the bar and as we go to sit a group of drunk girls run up and say things like \"oh! Are you pulling my seat out for me?! I'm sitting there.\" So I say \"sorry, this is just wear the hostess sat us. See the menus?\" So I have to ask a group of guys if they would move over from where they were standing so we could sit and have dinner. Then a waiter drops chips and salsa directing in front of us. Awesome! Some food! As I dip my chip into the salsa one of the guys yells \"no no no don't do that!\" So I stop and turn looking confused. He says \"that's ours! Did you order chips and salsa?\" And I said \"no...\" But don't they typically come before the meal? So they actually grabbed the plates from us. My friend and I were shocked. We tell the hostess what's happened and we didn't even get an apology. What I got was a couple cold tacos. Get it together! I work in the service industry and what I experienced tonight is just ridiculous.", "author": "Chloe H."}

We have gone to tacolicious in North Beach twice, the second time leaving before we even ordered and the first regretting our decision to stay. Unlike the friendly (and kid-friendly) experience on Chestnut) the north beach restaurant is unpleasantly loud, holds a happy hour which doesn't include wine (??), and employs staff which are rude (we had to ask one of the wait people to stop swearing in front of our ten year old(f-bombs rained !!). Why we went back a second time you ask ? We'd gone to Chestnut a few months back and had such a great experience, that we chalked our first one up as bad luck. Not the case. We will never go back. Fortunately, Cafe Divine is right across the street, and welcomed us happily, wine included :)", "author": "anita w."}

The chip were stale, the refried beans tasted like they came straight from a can, and the tortilla soup could have used more salt or spice. The tacos, the Micheladas, and the ambience were the higher points.", "author": "Mary C."}

This review is specific to this location.  If I was rating the food alone I would give this place 4 maybe 5 stars.  If I am sitting down and have time to enjoy a casual meal also 4-5 stars.  On two occasions I have sat at the bar while I ordered food to go and on both occasions the bartender has blown it.  Same guy, shorter hair and tattoos.  Both times I saw our order sitting on the counter for 15+min while he looked at it multiple times and just moved on.  He even moved it cause it was in the way still couldnt make the connection....come on bro figure it out its not that hard.  Only when we asked about our food did he finally realize it was the right one.  I would still recommend this place for causal night out where you're not worried about service and just want good tacos.", "author": "Rick J."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2013-09-12", "description": "Visited Tacolicious North Beach while walking from the ferry to downtown.  I have been a fan of these outlets from the beginning. This one does not disappoint.  The service was excellent although admittedly I arrived at 1:45 p.m. so after the lunch crowd.  I sat at one of the side tables in the main dinning room and could watch the Giant game while eating lunch. The music was a little frenetic but not so loud that it distracted.  The decor is upscale, roomy, clean and excellent.  The waiters were very attentive and the service was outstanding.  I ordered the old standby, two carnitas tacos for $3.95 each.  They were terrific.  The meat was seasoned perfectly and seemed of high quality. The tortillas were soft, two for each taco. This gives you a little bonus as you can peel the second tortilla away and turn two tacos into four, given the amount of carnitas filling in each of the two.  The tacos are served with three mouth watering salsas -- including the basic for the day which was a tomatillo/tomato/mint salsa.  In the three were also an mild avocado salsa and a yellow/habinero salsa that would sizzle the toughest palate.  The tacos are served with piquante pickled vegetable slices that you can add to the mix.  \n\nI asked the waiter if they did crispy tacos and he said \"no.\"  I know that at the Marina restaurant they sometimes do crispy tacos as a special one day a week, maybe Tuesdays. That option -- well executed --would vault Tacolicious to five stars in my opinion. \n\nOther features that make Tacolicious so good are such details as providing you with really thick white napkins, as many as you want, given the tacos are juicy.  They provide you with a small dish of special salt to sprinkle on your food as needed. This place is well worth visiting.", "author": "Bill L."}

We tried the Albacore tuna tostadas which were good but nothing like the portrayed on TV. They didn't make my knees buckle but they were yummy. A little pricey for what you get but not bad. The disappointing part was that they were out of the shrimp tacos which was the featured taco of the day. It was only 4:00 in the afternoon so either these are that good or it was bad planning to run out so early. We then wanted to try the chili con queso aka Mikes Cheese Dip. Strike two! They were out of this too which leads me to believe it was just bad planning to run out of two of the most popular items that they are known for. We then tried the braised beef short rib tacos. Not quite strike three but pretty close so let's call it a foul tip. The final strike out was that we waited a long time to get out check. If you live in the city it might be OK to stop in but if you plan to take a drive to visit this over hyped place featured on the FN skip it.

I had been told how great the food was so I decided to grab a bite before work. I was greeted by a very pleasant host who told me that I should place my order at the bar and the order should come up pretty quickly. I went to the bar and stood with my menu in hand  and watched as 2-3 people shimmied behind the bar. After standing for about 3-4 minutes I see the host enter the bar area and I am encouraged because I'm thinking he will surely inform the staff that I was waiting. Nope....the host poured himself half a beer, took a sip and chatted with one of the bartenders. They continued to chat and catch a glimpse of the football game. The bartender never looked up or even seemed to be aware that I was even in his periphery. Just as the host took a sip and looked up at me, I let my menu slip from my hand, land on the bar and proceeded to exit. I might visit another location but most likely not here although it is convenient to my job.  In any case, not a good first impression", "author": "Renee L."}
