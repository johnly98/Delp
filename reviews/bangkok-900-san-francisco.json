Just overall felt... Dirty and old. We were there for takeout food. Glanced over the menu and was initially impressed by the price range for the dishes, but knew why the price was so low as soon as we got the food. Portion actually wasn't small, but the taste is just not there. I got the pad Thai, and I only had two shrimp in the whole dish. It also tasted super bland, no pad Thai sauce or flavoring whatsoever ( i.e. fish sauce, tamarind, etc). Noodles were oily but still stuck together in clumps - not sure how that was achieved. Friend got some chili shrimp with rice, and he only had 5 shrimp in his dish. Rest were onions, bell peppers, and other filler vegetables. Oily again and not very flavorful. \n\nOverall: C+", "author": "Susanna C."}

This place is 2 blocks away and I can picture it being a part of our rotation of restaurants for this season. While neither of us were particularly impressed with our food, you can't really beat the price and convenience. \n\nA and I were sat in the back corner of the restaurant and at this particular time (6pm), the sun was shining directly in my eyes for the duration of the meal. The restaurant wasn't full and we could have been sat anywhere else and this wouldn't be a problem. We didn't say anything but it definitely put a hamper on our meal. Anyways, we noticed how cheap the alcohol was with the most expensive BOTTLE of wine being $20. They even had a liter of wine for $10 but I am sure you get what you pay for there. A bottle of Singha was $3.50. In any case, this is really really cheap for alcohol at a restaurant but I could not partake due to medication. A, however, had a Singha. We also didn't eat any appetizers since we had spent the whole day getting loose on Filmore with Yelp. We had:\n\n-Pad Won Sen ($8.50): This was mine and it was fine. I am currently treating an ulcer so bland Thai noodles were exactly what I needed. I would never order this if I was healthy though, especially considering that there were only 2 pieces of shrimp and not that much chicken. I was kind of upset with how much onion was in the dish considering the menu only mentioned scallions since I am not really supposed to be eating them. In any case, it got the job done even if I had to eat around a bit of the dish.\n\n-Kaeng Phed Ped Yang ($10): This was A's which he ordered because it was the only red curry he could find on the menu. He liked it! I did not try it due to spice but it seemed there was a good amount of duck/pineapple in the curry. He ordered rice along with this which definitely seemed necessary in order to make this meal \"enough\".\n\nOverall, I do think we will be back but more due to convince/price rather than food. It is a solid option if you're in the neighborhood but don't expect a particularly upscale or innovative dining experience. Also, the bathroom is TINY and made me feel a bit claustrophobic so if you have issues with that, maybe hold it and go elsewhere.", "author": "Carrie W."}

There were four of us. There were three shrimp in the dish, shrimp not prawns. I complained about it and they said they would have to raise the price if there was another shrimp. So we shared three shrimp like rats sharing a piece of cheese. This place cares more about saving a penny then they do about their food quality; which is terrible.\nThe iced teas was not good at all either. The other dish we shared was duck over broccoli, (I think). They sheisted us again; the duck was just strips of fat. No meat. Looked and tasted old. \n\nI would spend the extra $1.50 per dish and go to the place lower Haight on Waller. I am guessing that the owner owns the building and they do this just to stay busy.

Since this is my last work trip, I put Bangkok 900 on my list of must dos. \n\nI had the tod mun - patties made from fish emulsion. Wonderfully delicious. I use this as a measuring stick for authenticity of a Thai restaurant. If it is not on the menu, it's not real Thai. If it taste like chicken, it is a Thai fusion. No regrets here. Dish came out piping hot and the peanut sauce with cucumber slices complemented each bite well. \n\nTried the kiew tiew gai koor from the lunch menu. It was a simple fish - Pan fried rice stick with chicken, eggs and bean sprouts served over a bed of crunchy lettuce. Most places would have messed this up but not Bangkok 900. The sprouts were fresh and crunchy, the lettuce was crunchy and not soggy. Light sauce to show that you are eating rice sticks. Eggs mixed well with the noodles and not chunky or isolated.  A dash of scallions on the top gives it a pop. \n\nDon't be turned off by the white crocheted linens lining the windows. If you   are reading on your smartphone when food arrives, put down the phone and enjoy the steaming hot food. I have not found another Thai restaurant that serves piping hot food like here. \n\nEat here, don't take out. The heat will be gone by the time you get home with the food. Dig in! Enjoy the free flowing tea. They pay attention to you and top up the tea before you realized the cup is empty.\n\nI almost forgot.

Most things are under $10!!\n\nI can't believe I've been living up the street from this place for 3 years and have never bothered to try it!\n\nAlthough \"Bangkok 900\" sounds like a Crime Noir novel, it always appears to be empty, though I know a good amount of their business is takeaway. \n\nI went in with my SO yesterday evening and was very pleasantly surprised (and also sad, about the amount of times I could've already been enjoying BK900's delectable entrees).\n\nFirstly, the decor is really cool. You can tell this place has been around a long time and is from another era in San Francisco. This is a very good place if you want somewhere quiet and charming to eat dinner. There is a second floor for seating, which, as per usual, was deserted last night. My only gripe about atmosphere would be the Top 40 hits playing quietly in the background. Personally, I'd prefer something more traditional with such an old beauty of a restaurant.\n\nThe food was great. We had the crispy rice paper wrapped shrimp appetizer that came with sweet and sour sauce. The shrimp tasted fresh and had a great crispy texture with the deep fried rice paper. He had a dish with duck and spinach, I ordered the yellow curry with chicken. We both added a side of steamed rice ($1.50) each. \n\nHis duck was great, very succulent and flavorful with the sauce. But my yellow curry, oh my goodness! The chicken was not at all dry or overlooked but very tender and delicious. The curry was the perfect amount of creamy with a slight spice, it's honestly the best Thai yellow curry I've had in a good long while. And at $7, you really can't beat the price.\n\nOur server was great, the hot tea we ordered was constantly being refilled. We also, admittedly, ordered 15 minutes before close, and offered to get our food to-go just so we didn't hold them up from closing. He said it was alright, no problem at all, and did everything out of his way to accommodate us. We still did our best to finish up in a timely fashion and took our dessert to go.\n\nWhen we got home and tried the mango sticky rice, it was heaven.

The pad thai had sparse trimmings, I counted 4 pieces of shrimp, a couple slices of fried tofu, bean sprouts and some green onions.  I liked the generous serving of their papaya salad and the pad ka prow was tasty, thanks to the amount of oyster sauce used. \n\nSurprisingly, I still had room for dessert.

I've called, left my house immediately, and it was already sitting there - do don't waste anytime if you call for pick-up or it might get cold. \n- Curries are very flavorful. They use the perfect amount of ingredients in all their curries. Proportions of meat to veggies to broth is always spot on. I like that. \n- The little guy who is always working is cool. He remembered me after about the third time I ordered here. At this point he already knows who it is when I'm calling and he grabs my order as soon as he sees me walk in the door. \n- Best Thai food in the neighborhood.\n\nThe Bad:\n- Not spicy enough. I always order VERY spicy and it's never spicy enough. But no place in SF ever is. \n- $10 an entree is 10 times more than what I'm used to paying in Thailand. \n- Dining room.

I ordered my usual dish: Chicken Pad Kee Mow ($8.35 at pick up).  \n\nI've always noticed how drab the place looks and how there's only ever one table in use, but it's got potential--I really wish they'd do away with the dark lighting and kitchen curtains.\n\nTo the food:\nThe first thing I noticed about the dish was the lack of bamboo shoots, my favorite part, but that's okay, it's not really for the American palate.  However, I was disappointed with the dish overall.  It was waaay too salty--had a lot of soy sauce.  It also didn't seem fresh because there was a slight fishy taste (not comparable to fish sauce).  I've only made it through a third of the dish so far, but it's too salty to continue.\n\nIt seems that what people rave about is the curry.  I usually make my own curry, but I'd give it a try at Bangkok 900 before writing off the restaurant completely.", "author": "Linda H."}

For a Beef plate, we had the Panaeng Curry Beef for $7.25. For poultry dish, we had the Gai Yang Chicken, which is a marinated chicken pieces with Sweet and Sour Sauce. For seafood, we had a $10.00 dish that had Prawns sauted with baby corn, mushroom and green-onions (don't know the name). And finally we had one of the chef's special: the Pad Ta Lay ($10.00), which is mixtures of seafood covered in Hot Chili Sauce. Each of us had a plate of rice and Thai Iced Tea. \n\nIt sounds like a feast, right?\n\nIndeed it was for three of the big boys with a huge appetite.

I have been to many places like Osha, Ler Ros, Baan Thai, and so forth and nothing comes close to this place. The key ingredient is that the papaya is crushed with palm sugar and you can taste the richness of the sauce that goes with this salad.

He seemed eager to help but I think there was a little language barrier issue that left him a little self conscious. I was ok with it. I mean, I'm ordering Thai food from a dude from Thailand is he supposed to sound like someone from jersey shore?\n\n I went with some kind of curry. It had shrimp, cucumber, bell pepper and egg plant. First, everything was delicious. Secondly everything they approached with a knife it looked like they did so with a dexterity of a seasoned surgeon. A skilled surgeon who who has a passion for running hole in the wall Thai spots. Back to the flavor. I don't know exactly how to best describe it. Subtle spiciness that builds a little. Your nose will likely start running before you realize your mouth now resides in hell, in the best kind of way. We ordered shrimp wrapped in egg roll wrappers as an app and my girl got some kind of fried noodle dish. I think she liked hers. I think I forgot to ask as I was distracted by food. \n\nExpect to pay from 7-9 bucks for dinner. Add an app and a Thai iced tea and your closer to 16. Still very worth it for what you get.

But my beloved Mussamun as described below in my original review:  no.  It still had the glob of oil in the middle, and this time not only wasn't the sauce as flavorful as last time, but the meat didn't look great (\"mystery meat\"?) and too fatty.  I couldn't finish it.  As there are so few restaurants in SF that serve Mussamun, I'm gonna have to stick with Suriya for that from now on.  Also, not much different from a lot of Thai restaurants, but their \"to go\" cups for Thai Iced Tea are embarrassingly small.    Three stars for the sate, plus, since my review below, they appear to have come to their senses and lowered their prices -- it was very reasonable this time -- and the interior has a nice warm feeling and the service is good.  So, all is not entirely lost.  But, in the end, it's all about the food, and for this main dish, it ain't happenin' anymore, and I'm afraid this probably will continue to not be a \"go-to\" Thai place for me.\n\n---------------------\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nI was torn between giving Bangkok 900 a 3- or 4-star (where is 3-1/2?  lol), but will have to settle for a 3.  I came away from this place with few fond, lingering memories, but there were two:\n\nFirst, unfortunately, is the bad memory: it seemed a wee bit expensive for where it's located on its lonely corner and with minimal atmosphere.\n\nBut, the good memory:  Mussamun Beef Curry!  I first had this dish in LA (the capital of Thai food in the U.S.) and it was amazing -- essentially, it's beef stew, Thai style, with potatoes and peanuts.  The traditional way is using cubes of beef that melt in your mouth and are easily cut with a fork, same as in good American beef stew.\n\nThe majority of Thai restaurants I've been to in SF don't even have the item on the menu, and I've subsequently found out that it's a very regional dish.  But of the ones that do have it on the menu, they use sliced beef which, if I haven't been led down the wrong road, is simply not the way it's supposed to be made, and I can certainly tell you that the dish is not very special without the cubed beef.\n\nSo this restaurant is the first one I've been to here that not only carries it, but generally makes it the right way.\n\nNow, that said (and the reason I say \"generally\" above)...\n\nSomeone else here mentioned that they had a curry dish there and there was a big glob of oil in  with the sauce, as if it hadn't been mixed properly (or shouldn't have been in there in the first place).  I'm afraid that that is the case with the mussamun too.  I did my best to leave the oil in the serving dish while carefully spooning out the best of the sauce.\n\nOk, yeah, I know, why bother.", "author": "Merrick W."}

The thing is it took us years to realize how great it is, because it always looks so vacant inside that I thought that might bode ill for the food.  Well, they do a thriving take-out business, so it's not like people are avoiding them.  Finally I realized, that with 3 kids, the lack of people in the dining room suited our needs perfectly.  That's when I realized the gem I'd been missing out on.  It's  now my kids' favorite place.  The gentleman who runs the place quickly got to know who we were when we started coming back again and again, and gives us excellent, good-humored service--even has our order memorized.  In addition to the chicken sates the kids devour, my husband and I always get the calamari salad, and they serve a beef dish with the most amazing dipping sauce for the steamed vegetables, ever.  It was so good the next time I came back my whole order was  vegetable plate with that sauce and I'm not the biggest fan of vegetables. (I wish I knew what it was called to recommend it.)

Order some delivery from Bangkok 900 and you'll find out.\n\nI have lived 2 blocks away from this restaurant for over four years.  I pass it every time I go for a run in GG Park.  I have NEVER seen anyone inside, and decided it was either a front for the mob or... well, I thought it was a front for the mob.  Well, I would never consider ordering from this place until I was checking Yelp for a Thai restaurant that would deliver.  Against my better judgment, I put my faith in the previous reviews from Yelpers.  And to be fair, I was so lazy tonight that I weighed the convenience of ordering delivery (from 2 blocks) or driving 10 blocks to Marnee Thai.  \n\nNeedless to say, I'm totally regretting ever ordering from Bangkok 900.  First, it took nearly an hour to get my food.  I live 2 blocks away! I could have crawled there and back in an hour.  Whomever raved about their fast service must be used to the pony express.  Second, the food was just bad.  I ordered a tofu appetizer, vegetable green curry, and pad thai.  The tofu, well... I don't think it's tofu.  I need to have a carnivore test it for me, but it tastes like something that was once alive.  The peanut sauce was so oily, at first I thought it was like natural peanut butter - but you shouldn't have to mix up your peanut sauce!  The cucumber salad that accompanied the appetizer was the size of my thumb.  Since it might be the only part of my meal that didn't totally suck, that didn't help matters.  The green curry had no curry.  It really reminded me of the blue soup that Bridget Jones made - just green instead of blue.  There was one, ONE, piece of tofu, which would have been more upsetting if it hadn't been such a bad piece of tofu.  Oh, and there were other things in the curry that I could not identify - even after I had a bite of one.  This food was so bad that I wouldn't even leave it outside for a homeless person to find.  That would just be cruel.\n\nI could go on and on, but this restaurant has already taken so much from me...   It has, however,  taught me a valuable lesson.

(And like several of the other reviewers, I'd noticed that the place was never full at peak times and didn't even bother (or dare?) to check it out until I'd been in the 'hood for over a year.)\r\n\r\nI guess the best way to summarize BKK900:  It is what it is.", "author": "Dennis H."}

I noticed that every time I go to the there, that is the dish everyone orders.  The service is excellent, the Thai waiter is so nice.  I would give this restaurant a 4 star but the portions are small.  I usually have to order 2 in order to be full.", "author": "Eva E."}

I like recommending this place for take out.  The restaurant is too quiet for my liking, but it's really wonderful to bring something so superb home and share it with whoever.  Great eggplant dishes as well as spicy green curry coconut chicken.  Try it.  I'm not shitting you.", "author": "Amy M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-10-24", "description": "Two, two-word phrases are deserved of all 5 stars in a Bangkok 900 review: First: The_Sauces. This place has got it going on when it comes to their sauces. Full, rich, flavorful! Insofar as the general reviews of this place and seeing so many one star ratings insinuating food poisoning, I feel like maybe I'm getting a little lucky here...but in all honesty I've walked in this place and seen it for myself. I looks clean but there's hardly ever a crowd. Mostly I order delivery from this place. I find 5 shrimp to an order of something toted as the chef's special disappointing but I've never been disappointed when ordering vegetarian and again worth the mention are the sauces. The customer service is the other two-word 5 star recognition but the portions are slight on good stuff (Meat, Shrimp) and only fair with the vegetarian choices.", "author": "Mystery X."}

They are always very friendly and the food is pretty good. I recently had my birthday dinner here and everyone was very impressed. I was a little worried having so many people in a place that usually has very few. They did an excellent job, the food was super delicious (even better than I remembered), and you can't beat the price.", "author": "Melissa N."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2007-01-22", "description": "Biggest plus about this place is that they deliver almost always in less time than they tell you its going to take. The Kang Deng curry is spicy hot in a \"I can breathe fire\" kind of way. Friendly staff and excellent food make this place a fantastic little local resteraunt.", "author": "Brendan M."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2008-05-26", "description": "Great to for take-out.  Their curries are good and their salads too.  Portions are normal - as opposed to small or big.  The restaurant's decor leaves much to be desired, but I eat here occasionally with friends and family because I like Joe and Lek (two of the main managers/waiters/take-out delivery guys) who are really friendly, really Thai, really genuine people.", "author": "Maria S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2008-06-10", "description": "3 stars for location, hours, tom yum soup that's to die for, and decently good everything else....pad thai is the stickiest ever (depends on what you like) but tasty and reliably satisfying. Yellow chicken curry&steamed rice are good standbys, makes for delic leftovers too. Quick delivery and near instant to-go/pick-up...10 min every time, not bad! Food quality is so so.", "author": "s m."}

This place has the best panang curry I have ever had!\n\nMost of their business is take out so if you choose to eat in you will often find you have the place pretty much to yourself.", "author": "Slimm S."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2012-06-22", "description": "I am glad Bangkok 900 is here, especially tonight when my friend and I were gonna go to Siam Lotus but it was almost a half hour and the waitress still had not taken out order but we went over to Bangkok 900. I have only ate there a few times but it's been consistently delicious with fast service from good people. Having been to Thailand I would say this is the most authentic Thai food place I know of in the city. Sure there's great Thai restaurants with creative specials but this place makes Thai food that reminds me of Thailand and I conquer with others that the curry is great, we got  coconut curry with prawns. Everything was cooked perfectly and the tea was traditional thai tea and it made me feel all warm and cozy. The prices are also a little better than the Thai places on Haight. I will make it a point to come back more, I think I tend to forget it's there because of it's poor location. You should check it out too.", "author": "Solenne V."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2007-12-11", "description": "not a fan.  being that it's in my hood and delivers, i came here for lunch with a friend to check it out.  we were the only table in there, which always freaks me out, but i rationalized it by saying, well, it's the middle of the day, this is a pretty residential neighborhood, etc.  so i order my \"safe\" pick whenever i'm at a thai place i'm not sure about - tom kha gai and pad thai.  they were both just really mediocre, like if you were in a shopping plaza in some janky suburban town, you'd be like, oh, this isn't so bad, but in SF, come on.  there are just so many better options.", "author": "brian g."}

I wouldn't call it 5 stars only because it's pretty bare bones as far as a restaurant goes, but the food is pretty much exactly what I want when I want to eat Thai and I want to either carry out or have a quick sit down meal.", "author": "Lawrence W."}
