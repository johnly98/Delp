{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-18", "description": "I've been eating here 1 to 4 times per week for the last 5 months, since my company moved to the neighborhood.  JB's gets a lot of my lunch business because it's literally the closest restaurant to my office.  Staff is very friendly (I suppose being a regular helps!) and the sandwiches are good.  They also have some hot specials every day, so check the board.  They are quite good.  I've had the fried shrimp, the spaghetti, fettuccine alfredo with chicken, pesto salmon, a few others.  The hot lunch specials come with a side salad.  I usually get a cold sandwich; they have all the meats (ham, turkey, roast beef, mortadella, pastrami, etc.) and all the fixins (lettuce, tomato, sprouts, mayo, mustard, pickles, various cheeses and breads to choose from.  Sometimes I'll get oil and vinegar on my sandwich to make it taste all east coasty.  They also have a variety of burgers and hot sandwiches including meatloaf (which is cold by request, if you like) and chicken breast sandwiches.  And OMG their fries, which come with the hot sandwiches, are delicious, always very hot and crisp.  They also serve breakfast (the sausage for their breakfast sandwiches is super delicious) and have a bunch of fresh baked goods (muffins, donuts) if you just need to grab and go.  JB's doubles as a convenience store, with several large wall coolers filled with beverages and a counter stacked with candy and chips.  This is particular useful because when I worked downtown there was always a Walgreens or 7-11 nearby and now there isn't; for a quick 3pm snack there is really only JB's in the area.  Overall I love this place but one of my co-workers and I agree that their chicken salad is terrible.  Avoid.  But I really like everything else, and have been very happy with their service and smiles.", "author": "Dave M."}

Just around the corner from Jackson park and walking distance from the Anchor Steam brewery and what was formerly Potrero Hill Middle School (now ISA).\n\nServing up everything from incredible breakfast plates, sandwiches and burritos to deli sandwiches (get the dutch crunch, it's amazing), hearty salads and daily lunch specials. All done with love and care like you are being served by your own family. If you come in often you will be greeted by name and the staff will remember your standard order and will hit you with a \"would you like the usual\" when you enter. Kinda like a deli version of Cheers. \n\nDo yourself a favor and order a breakfast burrito, you will NOT be disappointed!

I've wanted to try JB's for quite sometime, but whenever I'm in the area during the noon hours the place is usually super-packed.  Whenever I've gone later (around 3 PM) they're getting ready to close up shop.  I guess it was around 2 PM when I stopped in the other day.  There were just a handful of customers inside at the time.  I walked up to the sandwich counter, was greeted by a friendly hello, grabbed a menu and studied it.\n\nBacon cheeseburger?  Maybe.  Avocado cheeseburger?  Sounds good too!  The JB Burger - double bacon avocado cheeseburger!  Oh my!  Yes, I'll have that!  All of JB's burgers come with a massive order of shoestring fries on the side.  I placed my order and paid for it along with a soda at the cash register where I was greeted by another friendly hello.  The wait wasn't too bad either as my burger and fries were ready to go within ten minutes.\n\nNot only did I get a humongous portion of fries in the take out box, but the sandwich itself was huge too (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/bJNVd1HqilRD3F9RO3t20g?select=PUtDBz_likDKx2zeV1jrhA).  It's not always just the juicy, flavorful beef patties but often it takes a combination of things to make a great burger.  The JB Burger was drip all over my hands delicious.   Piled high on a soft and chewy sandwich roll were two hamburger patties, two slices of cheese, several slices of tender-seared bacon, thick tomato slices, super thin rings of red onion, crunchy pickle coins, creamy ripe avocado and shredded lettuce.  As I bit into the burger and juices ran down both of my hands all of these ingredients screamed out, \"This is an incredible burger!\"\n\nJB's is a bit of a hike from my workplace, but with a burger this good I'm definitely adding this restaurant to my lunch rotation.  The restaurant serves up breakfast until 11 AM and has an extensive list of sandwiches, burgers, soups and salads.  I've scanned and posted their current menu in the photos section.

But it's been several years since I lived there.  It was a surprise to see JB's Place just around the corner from the park.  Having a banner instead of a real sign made me think the place is new (though it's actually been there for quite a few years now), and the smell of fried onions and other greasy yumminess drew me to the door.  \n\nSandwiches have generous portions, and they can get pricey if you have a lot of additions (bacon: $1, avocado: $1, cheese, $0.50).  At least they give you quite a bit for the extra dough - I had several strips of bacon, a half cup of mashed avocados, and two slices of cheese.  You can add an order of fries to your sandwich for only a dollar, which is a decent deal.  Sandwiches start around around $5 and go up to $7.25 for the club sandwich.  Great place to pick up a sandwich, whether one of their set ones or a build-your-own.  Nice staff too.\n\nOne limited time plus: they have Girl Scout cookies!

I like my fries a 3 to 1 ratio of crispy to soft. There also needs to be salt on the fries right when it comes out of the fryer so that the salt is a part of the fry.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2010-06-22", "description": "I only recently discovered this great back-to-the-basics deli, but I've been going bi-weekly ever since, each time finding some new unaccounted gem to appreciate either in food or experience.  JB's is somewhat off the beaten path in the Portrero district, but the 22 bus rolls right past (although I would not recommend riding for even one stop on this hell-bound cesspool of degenerate fifth, especially if trying to build an appetite,) and also nearby are the California Culinary Academy and Whole Foods.  (Connecticut Yankee and Thee Parkside are also within a few blocks if you need a beer on the patio to wash down your sandwich.)  \n\nI must admit that I cannot really offer the most encompassing review of JB's, since I get pretty much the same sandwich every time, but damn is this sandwich good!  Turkey on dutch crunch with provolone and everything-- boom.  This is now my deliciously simple and plain lunch hour favorite.  It always comes perfectly wrapped and intact, the veggies and meat evenly distributed, no frilly toothpicks or any of that. A sandwich is such a simple thing that it's really the subtleties that distinguish a great one.  At JB's they have a way of assembling theirs so that it's the perfect union of care and chaos; you can tell they were thrown together quickly, but with attention to proportion and arrangement.  One time I made the mistake of requesting light on the mayo, like I was going to crack a dent in my 4,000 calorie/day diet with that small and random revision, and it actually tasted dry.  I still could see little traces of white though, so I knew it was there, they didn't just disregard the ingredient altogether like most places.  I like that attention to detail, and the lack of pretentiousness.  No herby aioli spreads, no foreign cheeses I can't pronounce-- just a good old turkey sandwich.  \n\nThe staff is also extremely friendly, the lines move fast, and my food has always been ready in less than the time they've promised.  A nice clean interior with a good drink selection too.", "author": "Dana C."}

When you enter you get corralled along like you would at the short order grill at some college dorm eatery, ahh the memories of rubbing up against various folk in my quest for burger.  The prices are pretty spot on for San Francisco with the big burger (it has some name that I forget) and a beverage running me on the high end of 10 dollars.  The burger came with a Huge amount of fries that are also pretty damn tasty, but it is most likely that you can not finish them all.\nThe burger itself was really good, much better than I expected with lots of fresh toppings and a sublime balance of meat to cheese to bacon to avocado to whatever else was slathered up there.  The bread was the perfect amount of chewy and moist to absorb some of the juicy juice.\nThey do sandwiches as well and although they seem to have quite a wide selection of foods I have to say that the burger is where its at.  Love JB's and most certainly will be returning.  Oh, yea they don't have that much seating inside but there is a really nice park just down the block that works well for picnic style burgerizing (bring napkins)", "author": "Kenneth H."}

And some of the specials are definitely suspect.\n\nSo why three stars?\nFor one, the people running the place are incredibly nice. But the main reason is that they've saved me from losing my job! Their breakfast sandwich (try scrambled egg and ham on whole wheat toast) is the ultimate hangover cure.

Strike one was the caesar salad, which came dressed and with warm chicken on it altho I definitely ordered it NO chicken.  It made the whole salad warm and slimey.  Btdubs, who dresses a to-go salad?  Strike two is the mysterious cobb salad that has been different both times I've ordered it.  Of course chefs can take creative license on what they use in their dishes, but doesn't a cobb salad have avocado, egg & blue cheese?  I'm confused as to why you're calling it a cobb if it doesn't come with any of those things.  You're close to work, that's really the only reason I went back after the greasy caesar.
