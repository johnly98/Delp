{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2018-08-14", "description": "Last Saturday, I needed to grab an early lunch before my volunteer shift at Glide in the Tenderloin. Luckily for me, Taqueria Castillo Mason was one of the few (affordable) places in the area that were open before 11am. \n\nOut of the 2 locations in the city, I ended up stopping by the one on Mason Street since it was just a block from the church. Right as I walked in, I couldn't help but smile since Castillo pretty much epitomized Bay Area taquerias. The restaurant was quite small, they had a giant TV playing soccer, and you could get a bird's-eye view of the kitchen. Surprisingly, there were already some customers lining up for food so I didn't feel like a noob. In terms of options, Castillo had the usual: Burritos, quesadillas, tortas, tacos, and several plates. As far as meat options went, this place also had most of the usual (e.g. asada, chicken, chorizo) ... except for tripe unfortunately! Interestingly, prices at Castillo were not the \"usual.\" Like one normal taco was almost $3, which was much more expensive than what I'd like to pay for. Although ironically, burritos were still pretty average ($10 for a Super).\n\nNevertheless, I was already here so I ordered an Asada, an Al Pastor, and a Carnitas Taco. Here's what I thought of the experience:\n\n-- DESPITE PRICE, DAMN GOOD FOOD --\nThough I would normally not pay $10 for 3 tacos, I have to say that they were really delicious. I especially enjoyed the Carnitas Taco, which had really flavorful, juicy, and crispy pork meat. The Asada was also juicy, but I wish it had some crisp like the Carnitas. My least favorite of the three was the Al Pastor, but even that one was okay still. Across all the tacos, I loved that they gave a healthy helping of onions, salsa, and cilantro. The fact that each one came with lime was a nice bonus too!\n\n-- VERY FRIENDLY, EFFICIENT SERVICE -- \nOne of the best features about Taqueria Castillo was the amazing service. Both the chef and the cashier were SUPER amicable. I really appreciated how courteous the cashier was. Like, he would call me \"my friend.\" Food also came out SO FAST, which I definitely needed in order to make my volunteer shift. \n\n-- CHILL ATMOSPHERE, ENOUGH SEATING -- \nThough pretty basic, the restaurant was cozy for casual eating. There was enough seating between the tables and the counter. \n\nFor the good food and better service, I give Taqueria Castillo Mission a \"Nice-su, you can take your parents here and they'll be happy\" rating. If only the prices were a bit lower, I'd give it a perfect review. Nevertheless, I highly encourage a visit here!\n\nEat well and prosper,", "author": "Bryan W."}

The location is definitely sketch, homeless right outside the restaurant, but if you don't bother them, they won't bother you. I asked for two super tacos (al pastor, pollo con salsa verde) while my husband ordered three (carne asada, al pastor). The minimum pay for credit card I believe is $10 (?). The wait wasn't bad at all. These tacos are LOADED. The chicken one was extra messy to eat since it was covered in sauce. The cook must have heard wrong because I got a taco de asada instead of al pastor, but since my husband ordered one as well, I still got to try it. Overall, they were good, not great. They had flavor, but I think I was expecting something AMAZING based on its high ratings and what others had commented. I've definitely had better tacos. If I find myself hungry and around the area again, I'll give the burritos a chance instead of ordering the tacos again.", "author": "Jocelyn B."}

So, even though I took a semester of Spanish the only thing I recall was \"No Hablo Espa\u00f1ol\"... yet until this day I still get the \"are you\" look when ordering tacos...\n\nTaqueria Castillo Mason!\n\nOn a recent Tuesday I found myself in downtown San Francisco jonesing for some tacos, but I didn't want a tourist trap and Yelp app came to my rescue. As I peruse the \"tacos in downtown San Francisco\" I come across a name that sounds pretty legit... Taqueria Castillo Mason, sans the Mason part as I already knew the Mason is from the street it is located on. The photos screamed legit as the workers \"looked\" the part, so next stop...\n\nTaqueria Castillo Mason!\n\nAfter only a couple blocks from high-end Union Square to the seedy part of town I arrive. And the exact location isn't exactly poodle friendly, yet as I walk in I enter a warm, charming & very lively taqueria! It's the typical type where you order at the counter & pay the cashier. Of course, I'm spoken to \"rapidly\" in Spanish, but a smile, a finger of one moment is universal, so after a few moments I order my tacos (no Tuesday taco specials, tho it's cheap enough, FYI) of Carne Asada (grilled steak) & Pollo Asada (grilled chicken). I also notice the myriad of drinks too, so I add a Pineapple Agua Fresca (fresh juice of the day) and Anchor Beer (San Francisco Brewing, since 1896). \n\nTaqueria Castillo Mason!\n\nI am offered a paper plate of fresh Tortilla Chips as I wait. And after a couple minutes I am called up, of course in Spanish again, but I knew what she meant jajaja.

I was really craving some after a long night and saw that this placed served Menudo, which I hadn't had since I was in SoCal. So, against the better judgement of everyone else getting burritos, I decided to get the menudo.\n\nIt came out quite a bit bland. They had already put the dried herbs in, and the red peppers weren't freshly crushed, it came out of those jar shaker things that you usually have at pizza places. The broth was really boring though, the flavor was really weak and I was quite disappointed in how unseasoned it was.\n\nUsually there some rich flavor from the tripe, and its a bit spicier and heartier, but this kind of just tasted like some clear broth with some chili pepper flakes tossed in.\n\nOverall it'll be a pass, unless I'm really craving Menudo and can't find another option in SF to have some.", "author": "Tyler T."}

I'm aware that it might also be considered the Tenderloin, but from Powell Bart/Muni station to this taqueria it only takes you about 2 minutes, and I consider Powell station the Union Square area. It's kind of right where the down town / Union Square area starts to transition to the TL, if you want me to over explain it, which I always tend to do. \n\nBe forewarned that they are cash only, and it is indeed in a kind of sketchy area. But you're out of the sketchy area in like one block. \nI always order the super carne asada burrito, and my husband often gets the carnitas dinner plate. Both are nice hearty portions. They offer avocado opposed to guacamole on your super burrito, and have a few different salsas. Your food comes with free chips and salsa, which is starting to become unheard of in these expensive San Francisco times. The evening cashier guy is super nice and the cook is nice as well.

It really made me want to come back here in the future. I was super hungry, so I got the two mini taco place. It came with 1 chicken taco, 1 carne asada taco, and rice and beans. I decided to go with black beans for that extra protein boost, but they also have pinto and refried. I also got a small horchata and the cashier gave me packaged salsa verde. They seem stingy with their salsa since it was a choice of that or pico de gallo. They probably don't feel comfortable having a salsa bar out because of the area. \n\nThe carne asada taco was a lot better than the chicken one! The chicken one wasn't bad, but it was a bit dry. Besides that, everything was pretty good for a hole in the wall type place. It was the perfect amount of food for me because I was really hungry! Not sure I would get the horchata again. Wasn't really fresh, in my opinion. \n\nThis is a much better option than going to the mall. The Mexican food in the food court is plain sad and this place is cheaper, too. Also, cash only!

Wrong. \n\nMy friend and I both ordered our burrito at the same time, I got a super burrito with refried beans and grilled chicken. Still, wanting that delicious burrito in mind.

Couldn't read any reasons as to why it was a lower score than I would like but I could read the date it was given, October 27th and I was in there on the 28th. Great.\n\nAs he is making the burrito, I start watching him put all the add ons and condiments on it. Avocado, he used the knife to scoop it out of the shell, but then used his fingers/hand to take it off the knife. Gross. He wasn't wearing any hair caps and looked a little sweaty from being over the grill and making the food. As he made our food, I noticed that he put the wrong beans on the wrong burritos. I ended up getting my friends pinto beans and not refried beans. Not the end of the world, but thought I would mention it. \n\nIt was also a cash only place, so BRING CASH!!! Luckily my friend had cash, so I Venmo'd him money portion of the food.\n\nIt took about 10 minutes for the burrito to be made, a little long in my opinion. Once I got it, it was a decent sized burrito. Sat down, opened it, and it was barely warm, even though I saw him \"warm it up\" on the grill. At that moment, I knew it wasn't going to be that amazin burrito I was hoping for. Took a few bites and the burrito itself was falling apart, almost peeling and kind of flaky.

I had a chicken burrito but I just found it pretty bland, it really didn't impress me. That being said, I'd go back because Jonny Q says the prawn burrito is the one to try so maybe that's where I went wrong. \n\nOk for a quick meal when you're hungry but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.", "author": "Briony C."}

Place looks old and was kind of empty.\n\nMenu wasn't very clear. We ordered a regular burrito with chicken and a super burrito with steak (carne asada). I would recommend anyone to get the super burrito instead of a regular since it brings guacamole and sour cream apart from everything else. Regular only brings rice, beans, cheese, and choice of meat. Chicken was a little undercooked. \n\nGotta say that the size of those burritos were unique!

When he came back, he didn't acknowledge me, and then the cashier told me to go to him so he could ring up my order. While my companion thought his super burrito ($11) was tasty, it wasn't anything special and not that filling relative to a super burrito you would get elsewhere. I was super disappointed with my chicken fajitas. For $13, I got plain black beans (tasted canned), salad (chopped lettuce and tomato bits), and thin strips of chicken and bell peppers. I felt very deceived and robbed since their wasn't a lot of food on the plate, and I was still hungry. Because of the price, I thought it would have been better quality, and was expecting more meat and toppings like salsa, avocado, cheese, etc. In terms of flavor, it was super salty.

It's not for everyone unless you're hustling to get to Mikkeller or Farmerbrown the hard way. Me? I was just looking for another place to get menudo on the weekend, and I found it (photo: http://bit.ly/1cUGWcz). I assume it's related to the Taqueria Castillo on McAllister since they look similar, but I have to say that service here is more on the surly side.

She just kept standing there letting the greasy drippings land on the worn linoleum indifferent to those of us waiting to order.\n\nWelcome to the Tenderloin. At least I could look at the colorful murals that covered the walls (photo: http://bit.ly/1j2E4PI). I particularly like the couple dancing up a storm somewhere in the Sonora desert, she in white high heels that must have been a bitch to clean afterward (photo: http://bit.ly/1lTvC5e). Oh, it's my turn now. The $9.50 bowl of Menudo...to go, por favor. Yeah, I ain't staying in there. Not sure when the next turkey leg will come in. Regardless, the menudo was pretty good (photo: http://bit.ly/1lTw2J1), about the same in quality as the other Taqueria Castillo with the requisite tortillas in one foil pouch an the lemon wedge, chopped onions and oregano flakes in the other. Nothing noteworthy in the execution, but it still hit the spot when I got it home. I love this stuff.\n\nFOOD - 3 stars...passably decent bowl of menudo, will likely go to the Mission the next time\nAMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...4 stars for the wall art but all else is...well...\nSERVICE - 2.5 stars...like I said, surly\nTOTAL - 3 stars...menudo in the 'Loin...it's an option, I guess", "author": "Ed U."}

Stopped by today after my flight from Honolulu and munched down on the pastor super-tacos.  Hawaii's got their culinary strong suits but Mexican food is definitely not one of them.  Castillo filled the void nicely.  It's good to be back.\n\nA funny side note, I placed my order with the guy at the counter first instead of the person cooking.  Probably should have done that in reverse order.  Counter guy relayed the order to the cook but it was sort of lost in the shuffle of orders and people.  After waiting around I asked the counter guy about it, and he repeated it to the cook.  She then said something in Spanish that sounded suspiciously like \"That chinito didn't tell me nothing\".  Just a heads up to the good people of Taqueria Castillo Mason:  I'm not offended, and I had a good laugh even if that's not what she said.  If she did indeed say it though, keep in mind this is California.  Even the white people have some sort of grasp of Espanol.  If you're going to throw shade on the low, you guys are going to have to pick a more obscure language.", "author": "Alex S."}

Even back in the UK I eat a couple a week and it's always with great anticipation that I come to California and get as fat on 'south of the border' delights as I can. \n\nSo this place is pretty much as rustic as you get. It was full of Mexicans huddled around the football match which is obviously a good sign and it's a place to settle in and hangout or simply take it away. A really good selection of burritos and tacos is available with me going for the super sized and super tasty prawn burrito ($10)\n\nNow I'm not in the habit of leaving a burrito but if any one meal was going to get me to contemplate it, it was this whopper. Layered with tasty cheese, sour cream, guac and with a choice of wraps (tomato, spinach and plain) I reckon I could keep coming back and try something new every day. They also give away free nachos, guac pots and tap water on a counter. \n\nYou can tell this place was properly authentic by the range of meats they do. Offal and tongue burritos and taco's were also on the menu but for me it's all about the seafood - you just don't get much seafood Mexican back in the UK. \n\nOverall this was freaking amazing. In fact it nicely lined my stomach for a few pints in the Mikkeller bar next door afterwards. Based on this burrito, if it was my last meal then it would be a good way to go (sorry about being so morbid today...)", "author": "Jonny Q."}

Grilled with seasoning. It's on top of two corn tortillas that have melted jack cheese. Fresh avocado slices on top. I liked it so much yesterday I came back for it today. \n\nVegetarian has whole pinto beans, rice and avocado plus lettuce, melted cheese on the tortilla. Also a huge taco, and not because it has a fistful of lettuce on it - it has lots of beans and rice, but no grilled veggies (if you are looking for a vegetable taco). I loved this taco anyway! \n\nIncredibly friendly people working the mom and pop joint with yellow walls and murals depicting random mission corridors with turkeys in the hallway. \n\nBig jugs of agua fresca - looks like horchata and tamarind \n\nLots of bottled beers and drinks. Awesome containers of green salsas and salsa fresca to take with you, and freh radish too. \n\nFive stars for having some righteous tacos. I actually prefer this fish taco to Garaje's, and Garaje's is the law in my house. The grilled chicken and carne Asada looked legit but I haven't tried it. They also had pork belly which I haven't dug into yet either.  \n\nMy friend lives right next door and I drop my dog off there everyday. I see myself eating my way through their menu.

If you're looking for a fresh, cheap, HUGE freaking burrito, you've found the right place.\n\nMajor brownie points for pillow-sized dollops of avocado on top of it all. The toppings and ingredients are always so fresh.\n\nA couple downfalls: First being the neighborhood. Now it's not as terrible as some of these little porcelain dolls on Yelp are making it out to be, but no, it's not a great area.\n\nSecond, the meat isn't always clean and can be pretty fatty. There were some gooey bits in my carnitas the first time I visited, which can be gnarly, but isn't a deal-breaker. Also, they're SUPER heavy on the cilantro and onions, so you better holler if you're not interested in that.\n\nLastly, they're cash only, so be prepared for that. Other than these few things, if I'm in the mood for a massive burrito that's a bit out of the norm, I'll come here.", "author": "Tyler H."}

You take a bite into the burrito that gets some of the rice, MEAT, onions and cilantro, salsa, and then a cool ultra yummy piece of avocado.  No beans for me.  I always ask to nix those. They grill the meat on the spot for you so it's nice and hot in the burrito.  Super fresh!  \n\nSo if you're downtown and you want a real burrito, get your booty to Taqueria Castillo.

I found myself in this situation, jetlagged and starving here for a conference at Moscone from NYC. I didn't think such a place existed near all these malls and big box stores but I'm glad I saw their 4 star review on Yelp. \n\nI agree with all the reviews saying that this place is friendly, fresh and tasty. A tad more expensive than I expected but worth it. The place is in a rather large space, echoing with Mexican folk songs and families enjoying good grub. It saved me.", "author": "Jin J."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2007-03-27", "description": "Average taqueria food at average downtown prices in one of the scummiest corners around, one block and a lifetime in the wrong direction from the tourist hotels.  Breakfast and lunch only.  There's a juke box with 100% Mexican music.  It's cavernous and a little run down.  From inside you can look at the construction and destruction and destitution, catch a wifi signal from somewhere, and feel relatively safe and insulated.\n\nThey also have a bunch of colorful original landscape paintings and an ambitious wall mural by the same artist, and a couple Diego Rivera posters, love here amidst the chaos.", "author": "Gil S."}

It's right on the border of Tenderloin, so if roaming through the heart of dicey neighbourhoods isn't for you, you're less than a half block from safety. I'm happy to say that I did not witness any sketchy behaviour during my visit. \n\nAnyway, we came for a late lunch and ordered fresh horchata, fresh melon juice, two Mexican Cokes (can't get these in Canada), two huge dinner platters, and a fish taco, plus complimentary chips and salsa, the tab was only $24. This would be a $50 meal in my native Toronto. \n\nThe green chile enchilada platter was delicious, and while I found my tamales a bit dry, I was able to remedy that with some fresh, spicy, chunky salsa. The fish taco was lovely as well, loaded with chunks of avocado and onion. Did I mention astronomical portions? No? Okay, the portions are astronomical. I'm a big eater and we had a busy day of walking uphill planned and I was good until late at night. \n\nThe staff is extremely friendly and authentic, offering up samples without prompting.", "author": "Steve J."}

Not the best locale (on the western cusp of downtown), but such is life in San Francisco. The fare is quite good and consistent; and service is efficient. $2.75 gets me a fresh, loaded vegetarian taco; an unbeatable value for a healthy and delicious lunch. Really glad to have them as neighbors.", "author": "R R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2010-12-28", "description": "This place makes the best carne asada burritos! The server is always really nice and makes the burrito exactly the way you want it. As soon as you pick your meat, he lays out the tortilla on the grill, sprinkles cheese over it and grills the meat before throwing it on top of the melted cheese. He even cuts fresh slices of avocado into your burrito! I've never had a bad burrito here. The meat is very tasty and not too salty like some other places I've been to. There is abundant seating which is always a plus! I definitely recommend this place for a quick meal!", "author": "Danielle W."}

Whether it's huevos con chorizo, burritos, ultra-mega stylee quesadilla or a carne asada plate - the folks at Castillo Mason are always on point.\n\nThe ingredients are always fresh, the food is prepared right in front of you to your liking, huge portions and best of all it's CHEAP!  Super good bang for your buck.  The hombres making your burritos are artists.  They move so fast even Bruce Lee (R.I.P.) would be jealous.   Serious skill on da grill.\n\nIf you wanna get a serious and delicious grind on without the hit to the pocketbook, step inside Castillo and get busy!!!\n\n*note - doesn't seem like they have weekend/evening hours.  Hit up the McAllister Street location.  Same great food/prices and people.", "author": "J. V."}

I was kind of worried coming to California that I wouldn't be able to find anything that satisfies my desire for good Mexican food, but this place definitely exceeded what I could hope for. The quesadilla castillito is particularly good, if not mis-named. It's much more like a burrito in that it's burrito shaped and cheese isn't the main ingredient.", "author": "Seth H."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2009-10-08", "description": "I work in this neighborhood and most of the food options within short walking distance are in the mall across the street, which is actually kind of horrible.  There are good spots deeper into the Tenderloin, for sure, but for something quick around the corner, it's slim pickins.  I came across this taqueria once while debating which of the 6 different Indian restaurants on the corner of Turk and Eddy I should frequent...and went that direction instead.  And it's solid - I've had the veggie tacos, a veggie burrito, and quesadilla at different times and they're all tasty and pretty cheap.  The block is, indeed, a little grim and the restaurant is no-frills, but it's a good, dependable option that allows me to avoid eating Sbarro or some other skanky mall food.  As someone who tends to load up on the salsa verde, I appreciate the unlimited salsa to-go.", "author": "Stacey M."}

I couldn't believe the amount of chicken he threw down, after two scoops, I was like, OK, is that it? Nope, one more scoop. Walking back to the office, I actually think I sprained by shoulder the weight was so intense. And when I got it home tonight and reheated for a post-gym, pre-Mighty meal, it was delicious. The size of this thing is worth the trip alone, making this above average burrito a perfect five stars.", "author": "Jason B."}

I of coarse added a little refried on it, I always suggest this on a torta. They have fresh carrot juice  but it was a little expensive.

They melt the cheese to the tortilla which is a really nice touch. The al pastor was really good, much like El Castillito on Church St. (Hum, I wonder if they are related.) They aren't the giant more than you can eat at once tacos, and 1 won't be a meal for most people. However, for $3.10 out the door, it was satisfying. The neighborhood isn't that bad. It's just off a quite section of Market, but only a block from the Po", "author": "V M."}
