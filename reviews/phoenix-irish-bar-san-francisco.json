While they do show games here, it's not the best place to watch games if you're specifically going out to watch the game.

And while places like Phoenix aren't my first choice (I prefer lounges over pubs and sports bars), they certainly serve up some cheap, tasty drinks here (albeit nothing as fancy as you'd find at, say, Rickhouse or Zero Zero).\n\nAnd while the venue is fairly large, it's mostly long and narrow, which means that once 10 or 11pm rolls around, the place gets pretty packed, and pretty loud, which I suspect is even crazier on actual game days. Oh, and while I'm not normally one to comment on service, our waitress was SUPER bubbly and friendly.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Given the above about the long and narrow setup of the venue, you're better off somewhere towards the front.

Came again this year (1 hours ago) and felt the same way until SHE started her shift.\n\nI will find out her name soon enough and warn you about her, but until then, you should take time to read this.\n\nSo today is the primary day in the city to celebrate SPD. Dolores was packed, which means any bar within one mile should expect degenerates. Enter: me and my idiot friends. Definitely drunk, but based on multiple random accounts, coherent and friendly. At 5.30p comes one bartender who literally just started her shift and immediately comes to me and my buddy at the bar and responds to our request for two Irish coffees and a picture with her with and her cool glasses with:\n\nBartender: \"I will kick you out of this bar if you keep up your attitude. I've had enough of you!\"\nMe: \"Wait, what?\"\nBartender: \"No drinks for you!\"\nMe: [Curse words to myself, and maybe outloud] \"Good talk\"\n\nWe end up getting drinks from another bartender and we're ok for a while. We move to the side tables and hang out. But, I'll be honest, I'm annoyed. I used to be a bartender so I don't respect people who don't respect customer service.\n\nAfter an hour or so, I go back to the bar. Again, to be honest, I go back to where the same bartender was working to figure out whey she was so mean. As she approached me, she starts saying \"You think I'm going to serve you?!\"\n\nHer colleague, another bartender, is close by so I ask her for two drinks and if I'm being mean or loud or degenerate. She shakes her head as though this is par for the course. She serves us a few more and we enjoy the next hour or so.\n\nCome 7p, we call an Uber to leave the bar. Again, I'm super annoyed. This bar was solid and fun with the exception of one bad apple. I'm curbside with a sight-line to the bar and I'm looking back inside to see if that same bartender will see me (pretty aggressive move by me, I will admit) and she sees me and starts yelling at me from behind the bar. So I walk back inside and, again according to my friends, pretty calmly ask her why she is so mad. Here is what transpires:\n\nHer: \"You have no idea what I've been through today. You don't know me! You don't know my struggles\"\nMe: \"I don't care, you're a bartender. I've been one too. Your main job is to shake that $hit off!\" Sure, maybe I could have been more polite, but given how aggressive she was, I was not in a place to be calm. I'll take blame for that.\nHer: \"I have no problem kicking you out of here!\"\nMe: \"I've literally already paid our tab.\"\n\nIf the goal of this bar is to provide solid drinks and get you drunk, mission accomplished. If part of the goal is to make people want to come back, I'd say they failed miserably. She is terrible and I will find out her name and let you all know so you avoid her.", "author": "Preetesh B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2013-05-17", "description": "I come here for 2 things: the ball games and the pork loin sandwiches.. and Boddington's on tap. OK, 3 things. \n\nPhoenix is one of the few decent sports bars in the Mission IMO. The other one would be Giordano Bros (review pending). There's a real shortage of them in my hipster-filled, taqueria-lovin neighborhood. \n\nBut first, let me tell you about that pork loin sammy. OMG is it delicious. What I love about it is that they don't scrimp on the meat. They put 3 or 4 succulent slices of perfectly roasted pork loin in there and serve it with a side of aioli. I like to treat it like a french dip, only I'm dipping it in garlic-infused mayonnaise instead of au jus. They never give you enough aioli so be prepared to ask for a second serving. It's a massive sandwich, and for $10.50, totally worth it.\n\nHappy hour is between 4pm to 7pm Monday to Friday. What makes Phoenix stand out among the rest of the hh spots is their garlic fries for $2. The fries aren't bad. For $2, you'd think they would just buy fries from McDonalds and serve it to you on a plate (although that wouldn't be such a bad thing coz I love me some Mickey D's fries). Nay. The fries taste like $6 fries and are also served with their house aioli (but just between you and me, I think it's just mayonnaise and garlic powder). \n\nAs for beer, it's $1 off drafts. Pretty standard but they are one of the few places that have Boddington's Pub Ale on draft. If you haven't tried it, I like to describe it as buttermilk pancake in a glass. So buttery and creamy. Yummeh. \n\nThe only gripe I have, and this is why they lose a few stars, is the service. Their servers are pretty standoffish and the bartender isn't that friendly either. Sure she looks good and that's why they hired her, but she has the snobbery of a Russian supermodel. Trust me honey, you ain't all that. It wouldn't hurt to smile sometimes. It's a minor gripe but I notice these things.\n\nSo Phoenix old friend, you get 3.4 stars from this yelper.", "author": "Angelo B."}

Some time later she came back and asked if we wanted to order, but by then  we decided not to because we just were not happy with how things were going.  She was like oh I thought you wanted something sorry... Again we had to wait ..... She never brought our card back...my husband had to ask for them to return it.   A few minutes later the bartender came back with our card.  We then left.  We really would have stayed to have dinner and more drinks, but instead left very confused as to why the service was so bad. Do any of these people know what they are doing?  Was anyone in charge yesterday?  Does the owner know there service sucked on the day of the St. Patrick's Parade.  Thank goodness it was raining because this crew would never have been able to handle a bigger crowd.. Get more help or help that knows how to do their job.  I left very disappointed... And too bad for them, spent my money at two other establishments that were. Happy to have us.", "author": "Denise G."}

Trying to find parking is a nightmare though per the usual for the streets of SF no matter the night. Phenomenal Shepard's Pie but be warned this is a very heavy dish. I've had it before at basically every Irish bar I've ever been to in L.A. but this was by far the heaviest version I've yet to encounter. I ate about half and had to pass it off to my guy friend who will eat all leftovers happily. All the apps are great too especially the fried everything platter with \"Tayto chips and Skins\". Friends raved about the chicken wings though I skipped them due to my weird thing about meat off the bone. \n\nFun spot to meet a group of friends and get a little rowdy. We had our eye on the list of desserts we saw scrawled on a chalkboard in the kitchen entry way so using the leftover cash after everyone pitched in for the group bill we ordered two desserts and the total including tax was something ridiculous like $6! We expected dinky bite size portions to come out but we were floored to see the large size of each dessert, enough to share amongst the table of about 6 people.", "author": "Amber B."}

Their happy hour also kicks ass. Cheap half - pints if you want to try a few different beers, and cheap (I think $5 - 7) appetizers. My boyfriend and I have been here a handful of times, and we've tried the fish and chips, bangers and mash, vegetable pot pie, and a good selection of appetizers. The jalepeno poppers are the best. \n\nAs far as ambiance goes, like I said, it is not the most \"Irish\" Irish bar, but it is Irish enough. It's very warm and cozy, with families and children sitting side by side with drunken college kids, and top 40 music on the jukebox. \n\nI really like the Phoenix.

For some reason, I expected the potato pancake to be more of a hashbrown consistency or like a latke, but it pretty much was a potato-flavored short stack of pancakes. Never had boxty before, and didn't realize it was like that. \n\nThe parts of the boxty short stack that didn't get drizzled with Hollandaise and refused to soak up any when dipped in the remaining puddles of sauce, were rather dry. Ended up leaving about a third of the potato pancakes uneaten. \n\nThe bacon was wider and thicker than your typical bacon. Pretty good. \n\nI liked our pixy-ish waitress a lot - she was attentive and quickly righted an issue when my boyfriend received the wrong sandwich without having to be told.

Nothing too crazy, as I wanted to get to the gym the next day.  \n\nThey have some killer deals- I ordered the blonde (the beer, not a woman), wings, and Irish nachos.  The wings were good and appropriately messy.   The nachos were okay, but I really wish PLACES WOULD TELL YOU WHEN THEY PUT GREEN ONIONS ON THINGS.  \n\nIn any case, the company I kept more than made up for some pesky quasi-vegetable that annoys me.  Got to see many of my old favorites, met some new people, managed to get drunk enough to tell people things I probably shouldn't have, as well as drunk dialed people who probably wish I didn't.

They're generous with the horseradish and it's garnished beautifully with a slice of lemon, lime, a couple pickled green beans, and an olive and cocktail onion. Some might say it's a complete meal!\n\nTheir Irish Coffee is delicious as well. I'd be careful, though, they are stronger than you'd think!\n\nI especially like their brunch. If it's on the specials board, get their NY steak. For $15, you probably won't find a better steak at that price. Try their soda bread too. It's as good as they say it is. It looks kind of dry and nondescript on appearance, but the taste and texture is just wonderful. I'd compare it to eating a nutritious slice of cake.\n\nNice place to get a weekend day started.

Otherwise, M-W during HH it's chill, but T-F its pretty crowded, so get there early if you want to sit.\n\nHH:\n$4 big buffalo wings. Not many  places w  big wings in this city, so I like them.\n$1 garlic fries - nothing special, wish they were more garlicky, but what can u expect for $1\n$3 black bean quesadilla  - looks big and yummy\n$3 Irish Nachos- instead of chips, they build the normal nacho toppings on potatoes - pretty yummy and big, although probably really bad for you\n$2.50 sliders- a yummy burger (well, half of it). I pretty much get one every time. Definitely best cooked MR, but I guess that depends on your taste.\n\nSo the beers are $1 off during HH. They have prob 8-10 on tap...and Franziskaners yumm. They also have $5 margaritas during HH.\n\nRegular hours: I've only went for breakfast besides HH, and the first time I went when I didn't live in the city, I thought their Eggs Benedict was amazing. They also serve you thick pieces of Soda Bread when you dine in. After living here for a bit, and trying out other eggs benedict (Circa-yum), I think its good, but not great.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2009-10-04", "description": "I came to this bar last night just in time to watch the Cal game and was very fortunate to find an open booth right by the door. The place is not very big considering it got really crowded as the night wore on. The ambiance was filled with young groupies with a full bar and a few tables and booths at the front, followed by a pathway to the back where there were a few more tables to complete the layout. It was difficult for me to consider the visit a \"sports bar experience\" since most people were there for drinks rather than to watch the game. I don't remember seeing too many sports memorabilia and depending on where one sits some of the hanging lamps can be obstructive to the view of the flat screen TVs. Since the place is already small, it is understandable why their tables would be undersized, but this also led to numerous accidents where people either spilled their drinks or lost their beer glass to the floor. \n\nMy order of roast pork sandwich ($9.50) with \"taytoes\" was smaller than expected. The sandwich came nice and warm with soft French rolls but only three slices of hand carved roast pork at the center. Although the roast pork had a nice hint of smoke surrounded with spicy aioli, the sauce did not have enough spiciness to inspire while the few pieces of greens did not distinguish.  The side of taytoes did not come in the thick cut fashion described by the server. They turned out to be homemade potato chips and were tasty at first but too greasy to finish it all. Overall, I don't mind paying more for food at  sports bars since I'll be occupying a table for a few hours, but the sandwich could be much better if the meat and greens were more fulfilling.\n\nService was friendly and attentive the entire time. There were two servers constantly checking on me and overall there was a lot of energy and enthusiasm from their wait staff. I might stop by again if I happen to be in the area in need of watching a game, but there's something obviously missing with all the TVs on mute while the game was on. Not bad, but hardly anything to cheer about. 3 stars for the decent experience.", "author": "Daniel L."}

He watches everything he can, including college football. He dresses up to go to the games. His iphone case is the color of his team. He bets with passion.The thing is that I adore him and found myself being happily reinitiated to this different world. I guess that The Phoenix had to do with it.\n\nOn a Thursday night, watching football at The Phoenix was a pleasant surprise. In spite of the tvs, it didn't feel like a sports bar, but more like a casual and fun Irish pub. Many people were just chatting in groups, some couples were having dinner and a few paying attention to the screens. They had some electronic music on, and although I am not a fan of that type of music, it did help the casual pub atmosphere even more. And seeing him playfully dancing sitting on his stool put a big smile on my face no football could erase. \n\nWe had the fish tacos (chicken and fish) and they were pretty delicious. I saw people having other dishes and everything seemed really good. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive, always refiling our water.

The crowd here was extremely knowledgeable, and we had some good football chatter going.  Definitely appreciated.  I even won a bet with another bar patron about where Dashon Goldson was from.

They make strong and spicy bloody marys, and the crowd is loud and exuberant.\n\nTwo minor complaints:\n1) The bar staff seemed overwhelmed during yesterday's game. While I can understand it being early, two bartenders and a busser for a packed bar just doesn't make sense. People were visibly refraining from ordering more drinks so that the bar staff wouldn't be so overloaded. \n2) Look, I am all for everyone and their mother bandwagonning onto my childhood love.

I recommend the Irish classics: both the meatloaf (packed with flavor, topped with Guinness gravy and Iris bacon, served off course with mashed potatoes and veggies) and the shepard's pie (with delicious braised beef) are outstanding.

I had ordered 2 beers originally and the tab was given to me with 2 jameson shots on the bill I never ordered, but a friend drank them so I decided whatever since I knew them and we paid for it. Then I ordered garlic fries and prepaid for them so we could stay at the bar to watch the game. \nThen some girl down the bar and the bartender start fighting about something and the girl gets so angry she throws her beer at the bartender and gets kicked out. \nThe bartender then accuses us of being friends with that girl who I'd never seen before. Then she tells me I owe her for the beers I drank earlier to which I reply that I already paid for them. She gives me a funny look and walks away. I then notice that from the scuffle she had with the girl that there was glass in my fries so I said hey I know this isn't your fault but I barely touched these and there's glass in them. She replaces them but then brings me a bill for them after I had already paid for first order with glass. When I complain that she had also forgot to bring me my soda and side sauce for the fries, she tells me that I owe her for my beer and fries. I'm like lady are you drunk? We already had this discussion and I already paid. \nThen she starts ranting and accuses my friend of never paying for her drinks too! When we start arguing with her some dude at the end of the bar starts screaming at us calling us names and telling us to get out. My friend gets offended and starts yelling back, which resulted in us getting kicked out while the bartender was just smiling in the corner.

If you have never worked in the Insurance Industry (Health Insurance particularly), you don't know how insane January is. People (including me) NEVER read their benefits pack from the HR. They always insist on a play by play by calling their insurance company. So in January, there is no scheduled PTO for any employee (except for Dr. appts.). \n\nThe place is pretty roomy w/ a bar on your left side, booths to the right when you enter. A couple of big screen TV's hang over the bar. In the back, there are more tables and the bathrooms, more TV's. When we went, there was a Monster Truck Rally playing. Awesome. \n\nHuge plus's: \n1. Bartenders were very attractive. Adam makes a very good point that calling a girl \"hot\" makes her seem unattainable, but very attractive is still in the ballpark. Also \"hot\" is so 2000 late. \n2. They take plastic (maybe this is also a minus as I have signed away an entire paycheck before). \n3. The food!!! I thought I knew what good bar food was until I ate at The Phoenix. I was moded! I just had the Irish Nachos and the buffalo wings but they were amazing. Buffalo wings were huge, moist, gooey, w/ enough heat. Irish nachos were basically steak fries covered in cheese, guac, sour cream, black beans; ohh so good. \n4. I got there too late but I heard that the apps are 1/2 off during happy hour. Must make it back there to confirm. \n\nThe only problem that night was when a drunk asshole \"demanded\" we sit down as we were blocking his view of the Golden State game.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2009-09-25", "description": "The Phoenix is a great place.  It is my local, local and there are my great things about it that I'll divide in groupings:\n\nFood-\nFood is actually pretty good for bar food.  Should have the spicy wings (best in the City in my opinion) at least once.  Potato nachos sounds like a weird concept but they are very tasty here.  The Chipotle burger is the burger they have there.  They give you 2 big slices of chicken it comes w/ caramelized onions and mushrooms!!  For dinner entrees have the Chicken Pot Pie, chicken is really well made and the pie is so good and creamy.  My favorite is the breakfast.  You should get the Huevos Valencianos w/ Sausage (has avocado, salsa, eggs, beans and good tortillas), Phoenix Scramble is always a safe call and my personal fav is the Skirt Steak w/ eggs & potatoes (it is a special on weekends so look out for it!) which has caramelized onions, mushrooms and a yummy sauce on top.  Don't expect anything fancy w/ the food, just solid good bar food at decent prices.\n\nDrinks-\nNever have mixed drinks here to be honest but the Bloody Mary's are extremely popular w/ patrons, it is a must to try once.  Beers are not too expensive but they stopped serving Carlsberg which is a bummer.  Freshly squeezed OJ on weekends is always a good call.  Also try the Irish Coffees but good whiskey pls.  \n\nPeople-\nThe bartenders and servers are very nice.  Never had a bad experience w/ them.  The owner usually hires pretty chill girls as bartenders/waitresses (sorry ladies no eye candy for you).   They are all very nice and if you sit at the bar you can easily strike up a nice convo.  sadly there is always big turnover but they always seem to hire cool ppl.\n\nFootball/sports-\nThey have about 8 or 9 flat screen, HD TVs which are great for sports.  Place has become an absolute mad house on Sundays.  Get there early if you want a seat to watch the games.  If you get a good seat in the back you can watch like 4 to 5 games at once!  As long as you POLITELY ask the waitress to put your game on she'll do.  Just don't be rude to them and yell out stuff.  If you get there late, it will be standing room only.  For the Euro Cup finals, Champions League final or World Cup of course the place gets REALLY packed!!  As in people over flowing to the sidewalks trying to catch  glimpse of the game.  Good spot for Giants games esp now that they won it all..surprise, surprise...\n\nAtmosphere-\nThey have a bunch of Irish posters, pictures, paraphernalia all around the bar.  I've struck a bunch of interesting conversations w/ random strangers there.  It's nice and relaxed on the mornings (expect for Football of course) and at nights it becomes a good crowd/scene.  Folks that frequent the place are pretty cool too.  It'll never be a lounge or club (i hope!) but it's still great to go out to on Fri/Sat night.  \n\nBest advice is to sit at the bar.  Met some pretty nice/interesting folks in the 4+ years i've been coming here.  place attracts way chill people.  check it out!", "author": "Ivan M."}

Not quite a medium in juiciness, but still tender.  The house potatoes were golden brown and perfect conduits for ketchup.

Mia ordered the boxty, which was poached eggs and bacon on top of a potato pancake, covered in hollandaise.  The seasonings were really good, but I agreed with her that the dish would have been better if they put soda bread as the bottom layer instead of the potato pancake.

My vote was on Buffalo Wings, because really, who doesn't crave a little deep fried, spicy lovin after some culturetastical libations?\n\nAnd so we Yelp Mobiled \"Buffalo Wings\" and a few places came up, but none of them were really rocking our socks, so my boy Michael suggested just getting some \"Irish Gathering\" food...actually he said, \"Pub\" food but that was clearly the wrong terminology for this place...at The Phoenix. So we hopped on the BART and went down to this place.\n\nWhen we walked in we spotted a few seats at the bar between an old drunk man, and what do you know, another old drunk man. That is a great sign for a good Irish Gathering place! I then saw a table in the back and we grabbed it. After looking at the menu my eyes zoomed in on Hot & Spicy Phoenix Hot Wings!! Hell yes, it was as if the chicken wing Gods were smiling....and later, laughing....at us.\n\nSo we ordered a plate, along with our din din choices and when it arrived, oh yum, did it look good. I greedily grabbed the first one, spooned up some blue cheese on my plate and went to town. Only town, only took about 5 seconds before the \"Hot & Spicy\" description of the dish hit my tongue, roof and throat, and Sweet Jesus on a bike, these little bastards are HOT!! But so damn good!!\n\nAs for the rest of my meal, the fish n chips, they were hugely disappointing. The fish and the batter just didn't have any taste to it which was a bummer since F&C is usually a fun bar meal to order. Oh well, the pot roast looked really good and the side of mac n cheese was okay, but in no ways a home run. I think next time I come here, I will order those wings with the sauce on the side so i can monitor to level of third degree burns I get on my mouth :)", "author": "Stephy S."}

He chose this morning to continue a conversation we've been having on and off for awhile: brioche french toast or challah french toast?\n\nThis is a conversation that's much more dangerous for me than Arnold, since Arnold hasn't had either, but I've had both.  Arnold, in the meantime, is trying to figure out where to be initiated into the deep rich mysteries of eggy-bread French toast heaven.  When I make French toast myself, I always get challah bread.  When I see brioche french toast at a restaurant, I need to get it.  That's my distinction.\n\nSo, I had planned to go to Ritual and just get a scone or something quick with a coffee, and then get down to serious reading.  However, after the conversation with Arnold, I was craving some serious food.  Enter Phoenix Bar.  No French Toast, but Belgian Waffles.  While waiting for my waffle, they gave me a couple of slices of soda bread.\n\nA large disc of a waffle with strawberries on top and 3 slices of bacon.  The waffle was okay, nothing special.  But let's talk bacon.  It's unlike any bacon I've had; it might not even be bacon.  Thin slices of fresh pork with slivers of fat clinging to it, salty and fresh.  It looked like the pork was grilled very quickly, so there's a smoky charred flavor.  Dip it in the maple syrup. \n\nThe wait staff is cheery and attentive.  In the forty minutes I was there, my coffee was topped off about three times.

You can have a french fry eating contest ($1 a plate), an Irish Nacho eating contest ($3 per plate - a potato skin covered in cheese, bacon, sour cream, and green onion), or, like me and my fat fuck coworkers, you can have a buffalo wings eating contest ($4 per plate).\n\nSo, I don't know how you guys out there have your buffalo eating contests, but when we rolled, we were aiming for quantity here, not velocity. The wings here are at least twice as meaty as the \"wings\" from New Yorker's down the street, and they have a pretty decent amount of kick. You get eight wings/drums and a side of the usual accouterments. \n\nTrue, gluttony is a sin. True, gorging yourself isn't healthy. And yes, competitive eating is just another symbol of what's wrong with the country today. Nonetheless, I'm proud to report that I dominated the competition, 16 to 10 to 8. That's right bitches, I ate almost as many as my two \"competitors\", Tramaine Lott and Daniel Dorman did. Not only that, but I got nicely buzzed on the three and four dollar happy hour beers they had there.\n\nThe Irish waitresses are all very cute (accents: hot), they have sports on TV that ironic hipsters hate unless it's Albanian velodrome racing,  the drink selection is solid, and again, the Happy Hour is amazing. The only thing I can tell you not to do is say \"I just ate so much, I can't possibly get drunk.

I was sadly disappointed.\n\nNo, I didn't expect to see the man himself here; I came to watch the Eagles-Bears game with a friend... who happens to manage the fantasy team I'm going head-to-head with this week. Westbrook was a last-minute scratch from the Eagles' roster, much to my friend's delight, but Phoenix was a great place to watch the game and catch up anyway. \n\nThe service was quick and friendly, despite them being so full that we had to wait for a table. Draft beers (at least a dozen, $5 each) are served in 20oz glasses, so be prepared! The beer went well against the appetizers we ordered--calamari, fries, and wings. The calamari was a bit overcooked and under-flavored, but the wings (spicy!) and particularly the fries (complete with 3 dipping sauces) were very good. \n\nParking nearby is a bear, but it's a reasonable walk from 16th/Mission BART so you should be able to fly over with no problem. Just don't take your eye off the ball.\n\nTRIVIA: The phoenix has its origin in ancient Egypt, where it was depicted as stork-like, and is believed to have been based on a flamingo.

A symbol of rebirth, the phoenix is found in the mythologies of nearly all of Europe, North Africa, and even loosely in China and Japan.", "author": "Bill B."}

I'm not an alcoholic and that is not my choice of bar.\n\nThe second to the last time I was there was the first time I went actually being 21. Before that, it was almost a year since I was there. There was a book reading of Alexander Cockburn and my friends wanted to go to the Phoenix and I didn't. There was only two of us out of six that wanted to go somewhere else, so we lost and went. \n\nThe bartenders that were there before I turned 21 were well aware that I was under 21 when I used to go more frequently. The only reason they would serve me drinks because I would go with a few of their alcoholic customers that pracically keep the place running. Those alcoholic customers were now out of my life and they were well aware of that.\n \nSo I went with my new friends that are more suitable for my safety. I was still new at ordering drinks from any bar and I was still unsure what is a cool way to act ad not make it obvious that you don't have drink ordering experience. But  did went and got an old-timer bartender that did a few of my drinks when I was under 21 (and she was well aware of that).\n\nHere is our conversation:\n\nMe: I'll like a margarita.\n\nHer: ID?\n\nMe: (take it out and give it to her)\n\nHer: (doesn't even look at the ID) Last time you were here you were under 21.\n\nMe: That's correct. It was almost a year ago and I had something called a \"birthday\" during that time. If you look at my ID, you'll see that I am 21 now.\n\nHer: (looks at the ID, rolls her eyes, and goes make the drink)\n\nMe: (gets the drink and turn to make a comment) It's funny how that time almost a year ago you were well aware I was under 21...and yet, you still made my drinks.\n\nHer: (face of furry and pretends she doesn't hear me)\n\nMe: (don't tip)\n\nThe other bartenders were normally nice and I would tip them the rest of the night. I have nothing against this bartender, but she obviously has something against me. But I wont take it personally...she's only a bartender. I was perfectly legally there that night and I was not being obnoxious, so it would have been a waste of time for her to start a fuss and not serve me.\n\nI went one more time after this incident and I don't think she was there. But who cares. This is not my bar of choice, but if friends want to come here, I'll go.\n\nTHe drinks are ok to go an get one or two if you're buying, but not when youre budgeting. Don't expect much from the service since they do take forever with the drinks  and food. I do recommend going to order your drinks from the bar than from the waitresses. It's quicker. The food is not worth the money.", "author": "Daisy A."}

Their strong point was their kick. It was the best kick I have had in SF. It wasn't a make-you-drool burn, but a lingering spice that never breached the comfortable level. The flavor of the wing sauce gets points for originality. It had a sweet touch but never strayed from the wing flavor. Personally, I am not big on the sweet sense, but the flavor was still good. And Kevin Youkilis apparently signed off on it which is cool. The crisp was the weakest part of the order. It wasn't completely missing, but they could have been fried longer. The crisp layer was thin. Ahhh, the dipping sauce was actually the weak spot. It was some house dip which had a garden veggie feel. It was good for the carrots and celery, but it was sweet, which didn't go well with wings that had a sweet touch. Next time I will request bleu cheese and then I think this order gets ridiculously good. The vibe of the place was cool and the vibe is upscale. The order was on the small side with 8. The wing size was small, which I love, and the sauce was poured a little too liberally, but nothing agregious (see Giordano Bros.)\nOverall: A-\n\nThe Phoenix (http://www.phoenixirishbar.com/) order is amateur.

My mate, much more visually stimulated, can't look away from the sign saying \"fish and chips\".

A Mission bar that not only treats cider a notch or two above wine cooler, but offers a rather good brand ON TAP.\n\nThe fish and chips are excellent.

Mayonnaise, pure mayonnaise with maybe a dried oregano flake in it.\n\nOk, so maybe food isn't what the Phoenix is all about.

Went to the bar to watch the game on a Thursday night with a buddy.  Got there during happy hour and basically ordered everything on the happy hour menu!  The wait for the food was a little on the long side, but the place was full so maybe it's to be expected.  The fish tacos were great and so was the sliders.  The Irish nachos were fantastic and you can't beat the happy hour prices.  The prices do go up quite a bit after happy hour.  If you have to order from the regular menu, I'd go with the shepards pie.\n\nIt's a cool place to watch a game - they have plenty of TVs, expecially in the back, so every seat is pretty decent.  I'm a beer guy, so I can't comment on the quality of mixed drinks.  I sometimes wish they had more servers because things can get hectic, expecially during dinner time, but the servers are friendly and helpful when you get their attention.\n\nSo if you are bumming around the Mission and looking for some pub grub, a drink and maybe a little TV viewing, this may be the spot for you.", "author": "Ed W."}

The fish was crsipy  and not greasy- great fish & chips.

Good with latkes, not in curry.  \n\nWe also had the wings. They tasted as close to reall Buffalo wings as I have had in this city. I lived in Buffalo & so I know wings well- its really all that city has going for it. really. They were spicy and tangy Wonderfully close to a Buffalo wing- but too vinegary tangy and not enough heat, although it would have been fine if they let off the vinegar.  They were also fried well.

Silly me had a chardonnay in a a beer pub. One mistake for the books! The environment is what you expect of a pub with a long bar, tv's, fairly loud acoustics and wooden booths. We sat in a booth and my bum hurt by the end of the night. Therefore, the seating can be a bit crammed and not the most comfortable.\n\nHowever, I did try the comfort food they serve up. I ordered a Chicken and Mushroom Pot Pie and also tried a bit of my friend's Bangers and Mash  and they were both delicious. The Chicken Pot Pie came with a flaky pastry puff placed on top of it and the creamines and texture of the puff with the chicken and vegetables was really yummy. The sausage in the bangers and mash were very tender and flavorful.

I've never heard anyone complain.\n\nFrench fries are $3.80 with tax and come with a side of mayonnaise. Good fries. Definitely enough to keep me happy while I'm sitting at the bar watching World Series of Poker.\n\nIt's dog-friendly, so you'll occasionally have puppies poking around at your feet. Like every other dog-friendly bar in the Mission, they always seem to be super cool and under control.\n\nMy only issue is that people seem to be super wasted super early, and then they want to interfere with the conversation I'm trying to have at the bar. I'm not interrupting you and your friends - it would be nice to have the same respect for me and mine. Also, it's usually pretty loud, so I'm just nodding and smiling as you're talking, because I can't hear anything you're trying to tell me. Take the hint.", "author": "Jen R."}

Enjoy. \n\nDear Hot Girl at the Phoenix,\n\nSo there you sat conspicuously perched atop the epitome of counter culture casually sipping a beer when I noticed you drifting into my universe. As the stars smiled at the heavens and the interstellar dust began to part it became obvious that no one in our newly formed solar system noticed how well your designer jeans and Louis Vuitton's complimented your boyfriends \"Blinger\" hoodie and Vans cargo shorts. Certainly not the two gentlemen engrossed in a heated debate over the likely outcome of tonight's stick and ball games. And doubtful that the walking tattoo portfolio that escorted you to this pub-crawl paradise was able to break concentration from the pint of beer he was fixated on to pay you any homage. The ego takes one on the chin. It is worth noting that you did however receive a few catty-eyed glances from not only the wait staff, but also by a woman on her way to the lavatory. Just thought I should mention that.\n\nWell, you probably don't notice much beyond the ten layers of eyeliner you feverishly pasted on before this romantic night on the town, but sitting tangential to the royal you was of course me who at the time happened to be enjoying a delicious meal at our favorite neighborhood bar on a sunny and optimistic Saturday afternoon. And as luck would have it without warning you presented a conundrum like a shovel to the face. So I ask no one in particular,\" Is it the lack of life-long ambition or the complete unadherence to the laws of fashion that allow third-rate skater punks to pull highly refined trust-fund babies such as yourself ?\". Never the less, I reached for a frosty beverage to quench my thirst for knowledge as you pretend to be entertained by the proverbial mirror hanging behind the bar and I wondered how hard it must be to for a small town girl living in a lonely world.\n\nDon't stop believing.\n\nSincerely,\n\nSteve Perry", "author": "Chad L."}

I had opened a bar tab and needed to spend 8 more bucks to reach the credit card minimum and close my tab (don't judge me, I'm broke!) so I asked this bartender to recommend something in that price range. She just asked me what kind of alcohol I'd prefer, then whipped me up a delicious specialty drink and took extra effort to charge me 8 bucks in the computer. Totally friendly and helpful, when bartenders can sometimes be super rude. Plus I got to try a new drink I never would have thought of on my own. SO APPRECIATED.

The tasty bloody marys, mac and cheese with pulled ham and pot roast also are known to add to your comfort level.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2008-01-28", "description": "You know, it really pains me to write this review.  Prior to yesterday I had awesome experiences at the Phoenix.  In fact, I would regularly brag to my friends from out of town that I knew of a Irish pub that made their own condiments.  Beat that, out of towners.  The sad truth is that the service sucks almost as bad as the mean check out lady at Harvest and Rowe.  When the server at the Phoenix took my table's order she didn't really pay attention all that close to what we were saying.  My friend ordered some Huevos rancheros.  This was a dire mistake and mid way through she gave him a long \"huh?\".  When I ordered my skirt stake sandwich I thought everything was cool.  I asked for some goat cheese on it to give it that extra, well, you know, zing.  My friends and I gobbled up their awesome Irish soda bread while we waited.  The server did come back to clarify my order.  She asked: \"did you ask for the rib eye or the skirt steak?\"  She caught me with a big hunk of Irish soda bread in my mouth so as best I could I answered, \"skirt steak\".  Our food comes.  My friend, who also ordered a skirt steak sandwich, received his first, then the girl who brought out the food (not our server) tried to hand me a breakfast plate. I was at that point completely in a lunch mood so I shuttered at the plate.  I told her I ordered the skirt steak sandwich.  She looked like I'd done something wrong.  She grabbed the server and the server said, \"I asked you if you wanted the skirt steak\".  That she did, but I ordered the skirt steak sandwich.  The skirt steak breakfast special was actually what she ordered me.  It was a tough skirt steak covered in mushroom sauce.  I hate saucy food and saucy people.  It came with eggs that were floating in the gross mushroom sauce and also potatoes.  After awkwardly holding that plate near my head, and not backing down on the plate of food, the server graciously forced the plate on me.  She made it seem like it was my fault.  I backed down out of embarrassment and also starvation.  Oh, also, my goat cheese was no where to be found.  When our server cleared my partially picked at plate she made the mistake of asking if I liked it.  It was awkward.  I said, \"well, no, I didn't really like it because it wasn't what I ordered\". I thought for sure I wouldn't have to pay for a meal I didn't want (and didn't like), but no she charged me all right.  \n\nI'm pissed off and I don't know if I'll go back to the Phoenix for food.  Perhaps, I'll go for the bar and the Irish soda bread.", "author": "K B."}

We got a salmon boxty appetizer, which was pretty standard (though the creme fraiche, capers, scallions, and pan-fried potato base were a nice touch).

I bring a book, snaffle a booth and have a leisurely meal.  The waitresses are friendly, helpful and know to pour me an iced tea with lemon as soon as I sit down.  You read that right--I don't drink alcohol but really like the atmosphere, food and TVs so I go there frequently.  If it's soccer season, they are always happy to put a game on for me.  If I don't want to look at other sports, I read my book while I eat.  During the day it's quiet enough to do that or even have a conversation without shouting.  Now for the food.  Their Irish soda bread is the best I've had in San Francisco.  In fact, I can't even make it as well as they do.  I like their salads which are well dressed and contain interesting lettuces.  I love the burgers, especially the turkey and lamb burgers.  The lamb burger appears on occasion as a special.  I've had many of the specials including pork loin, fajitas, ribs; all have been delicious.  Since the food is cooked to order, it doesn't appear as quickly as a fast food restaurant but the time between ordering and digging into my meal has never been an unreasonable wait.

This burger screams for a thick slab of extra sharp cheddar, much as I'm not really a fan of orange cheeses. Skip the house made sauces- they all taste the same shade of not-so-great to me but say \"yes, please!\" to the crispy fries. They do brunch foods on the weekends that never really appeal to me but the ex loved the fish and chips and I must say their crabcakes are the real deal.

The Phoenix was recommended to me by my favorite Irish barkeep in Portland (County Cork) - hooray!", "author": "ray e."}
