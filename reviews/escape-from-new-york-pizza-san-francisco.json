This has to be the cheapest happy hour deal in FiDi. You can get a slice of peperoni or cheese pizza and a drink for $6 with tax.\n\nTheir pizza is the New York style hand tossed thin crust pizza. To my surprise I found that it is really close to the original, but only when it is freshly made. I get a slice only if I see a new pie laid out as the reheated variety is not good. During happy hour they have a steady flow of new pies so most times I've managed to get a slice. There aren't too many choices for the beer. You can get a larger (Anchor Steam), pilsner or IPA (Racer 5). I generally get the IPA even though I'm not a fan of Racer 5. Service is hit or miss as I've found very friendly servers and completely standoffish ones here.\n\nAll things considered the freshly made pizza's here are good and comparable to the original. Happy hour is definitely good value for money while service can improve. 3.5 stars rounded up to 4 is how I'd rate this place.", "author": "Ahmad J."}

They heated both and the wait wasn't long, but I have to say that the presentation of pizza choices was unappealing. \n\nThe pizza was average at best, and I'm wondering why slices of potato were on my mushroom pizza? The pesto pizza was very greasy and lots of oil dripped off it.\n\nThe place is gritty and dirty looking. Not much done to clean up as patrons leave.

This applies when seeing through walls in a video game, reheating leftover pizza in a waffle maker, or chaining hangers together to preserve closet space. The available hack at Escape from New York Pizza is simple and richly rewarding.\n\nAssuming you are uninterested in battling the throngs that evacuate at noon, you must resort to choosing between cold and limp orphaned slices that populate the trays at the beginning and end of lunchtime. Instead of pining for a better pie while chewing through a stale crust, simply identify which pizza is not represented on the trays and ask if that combination is coming out from the oven soon. At this point, you will be informed of a wait time and be guaranteed a fresh slice in return for your patience.\n\nBiting into the piping hot slice overloaded with cheese and toppings quickly erase any memory of the minor wait. You are even given an oversized slice to compensate your sacrifice. You Say Potato is definitely Escape from New York's signature slice.", "author": "Andrew M."}

I'm surprised that I have yet to pay my Yelp tribute to them, so here it goes! \n\nYou'll get the same steamy cheesey excellence at any location, but this one has helped me out the most. They are wonderfully receptive to huge delivery orders - the size that would make a pizza-mongering megladon crave something different, like, a nice salad; so they have my catering standards met. \n\nOn top of that, their website offers a beautifully simple yet comprehensive way to order online. I used to call and probably scare the pants off whoever answered the phone - \"Hi, my name is Chelsea, and I need to order 114 pizzas please.....yes, 114.\" Now, I can avoid that by going online and wreaking havoc on the interwebs. \n\nMany will tout the magnificence of the You Say Potato, and I am here to not surprise you. That combination of un-skimped pesto, potatoes, and obese pieces of garlic is truly a winner. I will also speak for the other pesto related combinations - the one with tomatoes and mushrooms is darn tasty. \n\nCrust crust crust - this is the tipping point where people's pizza opinions can be determined. EFNY's crust is a happy medium that can please eaters of both the thick crusted and thin crusted preferences. It's crispy and cooked enough to tickle the thinnies, and full and doughy enough to tickle the thickies. \n\nI may have had better sauce-speriences in the pizza department, but the sauce is another one of those pizza opinion dividers.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2011-08-23", "description": "Going to a restaurant or using a service on at least two occasions before I write a review is the right thing to do. Everyone can have an off day. Everyone deserves a second chance. That's part of being fair to the business, to myself and to the people who read my reviews on Yelp.\n\nI've gone here twice in the past two weeks, and was dissatisfied both times. I didn't find the staff to be user friendly. Today I asked the staff member not to make my slices too hot, but they came out much hotter than I would have preferred, and I had to wait for them to cool during a truncated lunch break. Once the temperature was to my liking, the slices were only so so. On my previous occasion I had the temerity to stand in the wrong place and place my order with the wrong person, and was admonished for doing so by another staff member. Then I didn't hear a \"thank you,\" not even a plastic one, when I paid. That's inexcusable. The tenor of the times demands, if for only economic reasons, that people maintain the veneer of gratitude and civility. Of course, I would prefer that people would come from a more loving, gentler place. \n\nI believe we have an investment in and a commitment to each other. Kindness costs nothing and says everything. If a business does not afford its staffers the opportunity to sincerely thank its customers then it is either poorly run, inadequately staffed, improperly trained or its priorities are off kilter. A woman I admire and respect says it best for me when she stated \"each time you buy something you get to vote.\" I don't like the way I'm treated here.\n\nI think I'll take my vote somewhere else.", "author": "Michael J."}

Today was probably the first time I've eaten there.  A few co-workers and I had planned to go, and to ward off Friday doldrums, I perused the online menu at 8:30 this morning.  I do get that bored sometimes.\n\nLong before I got there, I decided against pizza.  I am going to get the hot sub!  While standing in line, I thought about asking how long it would take, but the menu board suggests informatively: \"It takes 3-5 minutes, but worth the wait!\"  Well, if you say so.  The chicken parmesan hot sub that I got was delectable.  Bonus point: I thought the wait was no less than 3 minutes.\n\nPizza itself, based on past consumption (can I review based on future consumption??), is also quite scrumptious.  The BBQ chicken is reminiscent of CPK, and yet the crust has more bite than the think crust CPK offers.  Other types are just as delicious: potato, pesto, spinach-artichoke-sundried tomato-feta, etc.  Needless to say, I'm not a NY pizza purist.  Definitely Californian.

The slices are pretty gigantic and filling, I usually get two and its plenty for dinner. Make sure to get a punch card, getting a free slice after you purchase 7 means essentially a free slice every 4th visit if you usually get two slices like I do. They have all the usual condiments such as italian seasonings, hot peppers and parmesan on hand, though hot sauce would be a welcome addition. 4 stars because although it's a good deal and tasty i'd feel pretty silly giving a place 5 stars for basic pepperoni pizza.", "author": "Gannon M."}

Horrible service none the less. \n\nI go in and order a cheese slice and pepperoni slice. They hand me a luke warm cheese slice and tell me to wait a few minutes for the pepperoni. I wait and wait and see people who ordered after me get thier pepperoni slice with no problems. Finally the guy who helped me comes up and says they are out of pepperoni and if I want anything else. I order something else and they dont bother to warm it up so now I have an expensive piece of cold cheese pizza and an expensive piece of some other pizza both ice cold. The pizza is ok, the service is non-existent. The ordering system has to be the dumbest thing I have ever seen. I wouldn't waste my money again at this place....", "author": "Tom M."}

And that leads me to ponder the semantics of this restaurant's name. Is it \"Escape from New York :::pause::: Pizza\" [as in you are escaping from the city?] or is it \"Escape from  New york Pizza\" ? In alignment with my previous thoughts about the greatness of it, I cannot imagine that the latter would be the correct phrase. Like, why would anyone want to escape from the yum that is New York pizza. That's like naming a restaurant Good Riddance to Maine Lobster.\n\nIn any event, I should have known better. You can't just stick the words \"pizza\" and \"New York\" in the same sentence (or in this case phrase) and hope to replicate the very essence that makes pies from the Big Apple so damn delectable.\n\nYou can be good. You can certainly have better, more efficient and polite service standards. Your delivery can be faster. You can even trump the East Coast on value. But quality, taste, flavor?

Don't worry, I am not the guy holding the door for you at McDonald's hoping for a handout.  I had just come back from a long a trip, and I needed to grab a quick bite before teaching my 6 pm class.  \n\nApparently, every establishment in the area closes early.  The halls of Crocker Galleria were empty.  I was running out of time and out of options.  Just when I thought I had to settle for a McDonald's Quarter Pounder with Cheese, i saw the light.  Literally.  I saw the light inside Escape From New York, which was my only indication that the place was actually open.  There were no customers inside, and the only cashier was almost hiding behind the counter.\n\nI walked in and ordered 2 slices of what appeared to be Big Meat Combo.  The girl at the counter, visibly unhappy with all this extra work she had to do, put 2 giants slices in the oven for reheating.  I also got a small fountain soda, which meant that I was out about $10.  Boy, since when do 2 slices of pizza and a small soda cost you ten dollars?  Ouch!\n\nWhile waiting for my pizza to be reheated, I looked around.  The place didn't remind me of New York, but it sure did remind me of a place I wanted to escape.  The only difference between the decor at this location and the decor of your local Panda Express was the abundance of old movie posters and abstract renderings of the Manhattan skyline.\n\nThe pizza itself was \"New York\" in name only.  It was a big, greasy slice of thin crust pizza and sub-par toppings.  The sausage wasn't very good, the rest of the toppings were OK.  Even when covered with crush red peppers and grated Parmesan, the pizza wasn't the best.  It just didn't have that kick of flavor one would expect in a New York style pizza.\n\nThe place gets a few bonus points for being open long after the lunch rush and major bonus points for cleanliness.  The place was absolutely spotless, a definite plus for a pizza establishment.", "author": "Yan G."}

I will go out on a limb and say that their meatball slice is the finest slice of pizza to be found in San Francisco, beating even the mighty Za.  Really.  Meatball slices rule.\n\nThe only knock against Escape From NY is that it closes way too early.  If I'm working late (like I ever leave work before 7pm anyway) and I want a slice, I'm hosed!  Escape From NY closes at 7, and even if I'm in an enterprising mood and wander out there at 6, all that's left are the shriveled, dried up, hours-old remainders of lunchtime glory.\n\nSo this is primarily a lunch spot, no doubt about it.

There were a few free tables and not wanting to get to Irish Bank and find it packed, we decided to just sit down right there.  We were happy that we would be able to get a table outside.  We were even happier when we saw it was happy hour and beers were only $2!  Where in the financial district is there a $2 beer happy hour?  We were so stoked and ended up sitting at our little table enjoying the warm weather and watching the world go by for an hour!  \n\nWe will DEFINITELY be going back when it's warm and we actually want to be able to get a table outside.  Six beers and an hour at a table outside in the financial district for only $15?  What's not to love?  Just don't get their pizza.", "author": "Jen S."}

And the fact that I spent $3.50 on a slice was a litte disappointing, but it is in the heart of the Financial District, so I was expecting it...\r\n\r\nUpdate: Finally tried the Potato Pesto Pizza. It was actually really good. I still prefer the red sauce over the pesto, but this unique pizza is worth a try.
