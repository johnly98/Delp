I'm doing a review on their eggs since I'm on an extreme low carb diet and one of my best friends was feasting on baked goods that day.  \n\nThe three eggs in a bowl is awesome, dare I say life saver.  One of my weakeneses is biscuits and we all know how good the biscuits are here.  I was almost about to cheat when I saw the eggs in the bowl order.  I then happily ordered that and added cheddar cheese, avocado, bacon and their garlic-lemon-aioli.  WOW! that was good.  It's one of the best scrambled eggs I've ever had.  Good bite on the eggs an enough seasonings and flavor.  The avocado was good and the bacon and cheddar shines.  \nI would come back just for this order and would suggest this for others even when they have no diet restrictions.  Good work Devil's Teeth for having this option.  FYI this can be a vegetarian-gluten free option as well.  Amazing and I'm a happy Yelper!!!", "author": "John G."}

The biscuit itself was well constructed, flaky, buttery and held up the ingredients well. However, the contents of the sandwich were rather lacking in flavor and my bacon was downright burnt. The bacon was charred to the point of being inedible. I was aghast that they would deign to serve that to a customer. I don't think this place is worth the hype anymore. The quality has definitely declined over the years and overall, I don't think it's worth the trek to the Outer Sunset.", "author": "Laura Y."}

I found Devil's Teeth Baking on Yelp and decided to stop by for breakfast and some coffee. The line was out the door at around 9:30AM on a Sunday, but the wait was not too bad. \n\nThey have an awesome selection of pastries, breakfast and lunch options (which are served all day), and $1 beignets only on Sundays! I ended up ordering the special breakfast sandwich (which is their regular sandwich + bacon + avocado for an additional dollar) and a beignet in addition to a latte. \n\nThe wait for the breakfast sandwich and the beignet was longer than the wait to order, which was a bit frustrating. However, I do appreciate that everything is made to order, even the beignets. The beignet was soft, pillow-y, and quite doughy in the middle, which is exactly how I like them. I thought it was kind of weirdly packaged though, in a brown paper bag with powdered sugar just sitting at the bottom and not actually sifted on to the beignet. The breakfast sandwich was decent, I particularly enjoyed the bacon but I wish I had the option to order it with something else other than the biscuit. \n\nI will probably be back at some point to try all the different cookies and more of the items on their breakfast/lunch menu!", "author": "Sherry L."}

I recommend coming early (we went around 8am and the line was very manageable but when we left 30-40 min later it was down the block). We came here on a Sunday morning and was very pleased because it's the only day of the week they make fresh beignets (made to order). Needless to say, they were warm and incredibly delicious.\n\nWe came for the special breakfast sandwich, called \"the best breakfast sandwich\" by the infatuation, which is my go to spot for all things food. This little piece of heaven is served on a buttermilk biscuit and comes with scrambled eggs, lemon garlic aioli, pepper jack cheese, avocado and bacon. I came all the way from New York to try this breakfast sandwich and am so happy I did! Definitely worth making the barge out to the Sunset to get this sandwich. The biscuit was buttery and flakey, and all ingredients were well balanced and plentiful.\n\nI also got a coffee which was great - they have a full espresso bar and iced coffee too, as well as a chocolate chip cookie for later. It's a bakery so there are endless tempting treats that I couldn't help but try. Make the trip here and get the best breakfast sandwich of your life!", "author": "Courtney B."}

The line was out the door because it was beignet Sunday. After waiting for about 10-15 minutes, we were able to place our orders. \n\nI got the strawberry muffin, and my friend got the biscuit and cinnamon roll. The muffin was good, but nothing that totally knocked it out of the park. It was fluffy with a light banana taste to it. The strawberry flavor was good since it was fresh strawberries instead of artificial, but I didn't think it was distributed throughout the muffin that well. I had a bite of my friend's biscuit, and while I expected the fluffy and flaky traditional biscuit consistency, I was surprised with a dense and thick one instead. It wasn't bad, I just prefer the other kind of biscuit. The cinnamon was good and had a strong cinnamon taste - I would have enjoyed this with coffee I think. \n\nI don't think I would come back here since it's pretty far out in the Outer Sunset. But on the other hand, I do think if I happen to be in the area, I will come back and try the special breakfast sandwich which sounds great. I can see how the biscuit would totally work in the breakfast sandwich. Overall: good, but not really anything that special enough for me to trek all the way out to the area for.

This Outer Sunset bakery brings in a lot of people, especially on the weekends, and after tasting their goodies, I can definitely see why!\n\nStandouts --\n- special breakfast sandwich: SO bomb, probably one of my favorite breakfast sandwiches. The aioli is such a nice touch, and the biscuit was super fluffy and satisfying. I waited around 15 minutes for this, but it was worth it! \n- beignets: only $1! I believe only served on Sundays. This came out pretty quickly, and came out piping hot! We had to wait a couple minutes before diving in. The beignets are super worth it, definitely surprised at how big they were since they were only $1! They were fluffy and delicious. A little denser than other beignets I've had, but I actually enjoyed this.\n- focaccia bread: a huge piece, very yummy. A perfect pick for me who likes more savory bakery goodies.\n- cinnamon roll: Nathan got the cinnamon roll and loved it. I think that's another crowd favorite and I can see why!\n\nI stopped in recently on a Sunday around 1PM and the crowds had actually died down a bit by then! There was no line to order, but definitely a lot of people waiting for their food.

The owner's husband is a San Francisco Police Department officer! She opened the rustic-ish cafe in the outer sunset district  to make her famous breakfast sandwiches that her husband loves... that simple! And simple is the mantra here. Keep it simple, fresh, quality, & it'll taste good! This was over five years ago and today there's a cult like following when the doors open!\n\nFor me, I really wanted to get my paws on the Special Breakfast Sandwich! So on a weekend (I heard lines get insane at times) early morning I head to the Devil and see what it's all about... it's on Noriega St. and in the Outer Sunset like many mention, so expect fog if coming here early! \n\nI arrive to maybe five people in line, another eight waiting on their orders, and at least five employees pumping out the goods. The crowd seemed mixed, from surfers, to professionals pretending to be skaters, mom, and a couple silver foxes. After a few minutes it's my turn (line really moves fast)! I order the Special Breakfast Sandwich (buttermilk biscuit, scrambled eggs, lemon garlic aioli, avocado, topped with crispy bacon & melted pepper jack cheese), I add... A\u00e7ai drink, Strawberry Muffin for later. A few minutes later my name is called... \n\nThe cafe was smaller than I imagined, yet it worked, and had that hippie communal vibe, a couple small tables were inside, a counter with stools, and the beach benches on the sidewalk. Eclectic decor. If you come early more \"nature\" chairs can be found next-door at the surf shop - where I found a seat.\n\nOne bite into that Special Breakfast Sandwich was orgasmic and more! Yup, it was HEAVENLY! Like others mention believe the hype for this one item... its heart-thumping DELICIOUS! The A\u00e7a\u00ed drink was a perfect compliment to the Sammy. I held off on the Strawberry Muffin 'til later. The Muffin was good, but not off-the-hook like the Sammy! \n\nAll in all, I highly recommend Devil's Teeth Baking Company.

When told that there would be a 15-20 minute wait, and that 15 minute wait turns into an 70-80 minute wait, that is rather annoying.  I mean yeah, it's good, but I do not think it is good enough to wait more than an hour.  Heck - If I knew there the 20 minute wait actually meant 80 minutes, I would have just left.  But once they have your money, I guess you are kinda stuck.  That happened twice.  Once was a breakfast sandwich, and the second time was a grilled cheese.\n\nIn a couple other incidents:  They have bread.  I like their bread.  I am wiling to give them money for the bread based on the price on the menu board.  But the workers have to get authorization to sell the bread.  On one hand, that is amusing and comical to watch them walk around asking for authorization; on the other hand it is kind of like WTF?  Is this communist USSR...Remember the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld?  They are like the bread version.  I mean stood in line for 15 minutes to buy bread, not for a chance that I might be able to buy bread.  Why do they need authorization to sell the bread.   It is some weird thing  really need to sort out!  If they do not want to sell bread, do not put that on the menu board.\n\nAdditionally I find it weird that they tax EVERYTHING.  Even to go foods and foods that are not heated because that is not the norm, especially baked goods items.\n\nThe ready made stuff is good if you do not want to wait after ordering.  Unless it is bread.  I like the cookies.

My two gal pals and I had a calligraphy class at 10 am in Hayes Valley and decided to swing by DT to check out the breakfast sandwiches my friend Jacque C. raves about.  We lucked out and found parking right outside and just a few other people in line.  It was an unusually sunny day and there were plenty of people seated on the benches right outside.  \n\nThe crew at DT works really efficiently and we placed and received our order of sandwiches in what felt like less than five minutes.  After snapping some pics in front of the shark painted on the right side wall, we were off to our class.  \n\nOn the way there I began tucking into the special breakfast sandwich and HOLY...

The biscuit is moist, flaky and buttery without having any artificial flavor or feel (you know that coated feeling that sometimes lingers on the roof of your mouth after eating movie theater popcorn?).  The bacon was perfectly cooked as well and added some crunch to go with the smooth, rich slices of avocado, the melted pepper jack cheese, scrambled eggs and the lemon-garlic aioli.

The shop itself is bustling and charming with the volume of people necessary to tell all passers-by it's a good place to eat - but the food really didn't live up to that. \n\nWe didn't try the famed breakfast sandwich because I'm more of a sausage breakfast sandwich person, but we did get the lemon bar, cinnamon rolls, and a sourdough loaf. The lemon bar was par for the course - not stunning but a good enough lemon bar. The sourdough loaf was tasty with a chewy texture but not the structure and air holes you'd find in a traditional loaf. \n\nThe biggest disappointment was the cinnamon roll - it clearly would have been good while fresh, but was cold by the time we bought them at 10am - and they don't reheat them so your options are to eat it cold or take it home and heat it yourself. As such, it was SATURATED with butter, and not in the good way. I also missed the traditional cream cheese icing, which they don't offer. \n\nReally wanted to love this place, but while it was \"bad,\" I definitely won't be back.", "author": "Kim B."}

Altogether, my choices came to $14.10, which is definitely not the cheapest option, but was it worth it? Yes.\n\nWhen the guy originally handed me my coffee in a to-go cup, it came without a cardboard coozie and yes, it was piping hot. I immediately turned and set it down on the benchtop behind me and when I turned around, he had actually come from behind the counter with my lemon bar packaged in a little brown bag. Considering how he could have just set it on top of the pastry casing, I really appreciated this little touch of added customer service. After setting up camp, my breakfast sandwich came out maybe 5 minutes later... \n\nDelivered nice and hot with ooey-gooey cheese and aioli spilling out, it looked absolutely delectable! And yes, it tasted just as divine as it looked! I definitely appreciated how much avocado they added to the sandwich given the price of those dang things these days (plus...I know places charging $8 for avocado toast that maybe gives you a quarter avocado...totally no bueno). If I had any complaint about the sandwich, it was that the bacon was little overdone. It didn't really have any meatiness to it given how brittle it was. Still, I can't complain because my favorite part of the sandwich was done perfectly. Yes. It's the biscuit if you're wondering. It was buttery and fluffy just as a biscuit should be in my opinion.\n\nDefinitely would have this again.\n\nCoffee was standard, nothing to write home about in my opinion.\n\nI opted to save my lemon bar for later in the day and it held up surprisingly well.

We arrived around 9am on a Sunday morning and there was a line out store. We actually got lucky and found parking almost at the front of the bakery, although I can imagine parking get harder later in the day since you'll have to find street parking. The store is very small and intimate, which is why there most likely will be a line out the door. Besides the area where you order, there are tables along the wall where you can sit and stand. There are also a lot of people who just eat right outside of the bakery. \n\nThe Special Breakfast Sandwich at Devil's Teeth Bakery is a MUST get item. There are two breakfast sandwiches so make sure you specify you want the \"special\" version. The differences between the sandwiches are really pepper jack cheese instead of cheddar cheese, the lemon garlic aioli, and the avocado. While the regular breakfast sandwich also sounds good, I think the lemon garlic aioli both really adds to the eating experience. I personally think the $1.25 difference in cost is totally worth it. To my surprise, when we ordered the sandwiches, we were actually told that we would need to wait about 20min for the sandwich (probably because of the amount of orders they're getting). The sandwiches are pretty big, and was plenty of food for my sister and I to share. \n\nWe also ordered a beignet for each person, since they have $1 Beignet Sundays! The beignets were super warm and fluffy. They basically put them in a bag and throw a bunch of powdered sugar in the bag, so you'll see a lot of people shaking the brown bag cover their beignets with powder sugar (just be careful since it might get all over the place). \n\nOverall, I had an amazing breakfast experience at Devil's Teeth Bakery and would definitely try to come back if I'm in the area.

We were looking for a quick to go breakfast option and thought this might be the place.\n\nWe were wrong. Line was out the door and many people sitting around also waiting for their orders, this is definitely not a quick option for breakfast.  We didn't feel like waiting so, we decided to head across the street for breakfast burritos. Surrounding businesses must get s lot of business from people giving up on waiting at DTBC! \n\nAnyway, while we were eating across the street , the endless line got us more then curious , so I decided to go ahead and stand in que. it took about 15 minutes to get the counter. I asked the lady what she would recommend from the baked goods under the glass. She hesitated for a brief moment before replying that  they're \"known for their biscuit sandwiches.\"  Ok got that. So it was up to me to pick out a few goodies. I ended up ordering a couple of the bacon beer cheese muffins, a strawberry muffin, lemon bar, and a peanut butter chocolate chip cookie to go. Order came out to 15$ and some change.  \n\nI couldn't wait to eat my gluten rich purchase, so when I got in the car,  I took a bite out of everything! Afterwards, I decided I could have waited longer.  Everything was just ordinary. Nothing tasted particularly fresh baked. Everything was cold and flavors were muted. \n\nThe strawberry muffin looked like it was going to be amazing, but it was very doughy and I didn't get a very berry note at all.  The beer bacon cheese muffin was too salty and again it was cold and had a very odd dense and heavy texture . It just wasn't all that good.  The peanut butter cookie was huge and covered in chocolate chips and I had high hopes for the cookie. The cookie did not deliver. It did have an intense peanut butter flavor, but the texture of the cookie was not to my liking . It was very granulated, like it was sugar heavy and less flour. It didn't have that toothsome bite you expect in a large chewy cookie.  The lemon bar was the last item i tasted. The Lemon filling was ok , but the crust part was not that great . It was not flaky and lacked in flavor . \n\nWhat a let down! Non of the prepared baked goods lived up to the hype of a 5 star establishment ! I don't feel that \"baking company \" is an appropriate name for DTBC. In my humble opinion , they are not an expert full on bakery, based the handful of items I got to taste. If the biscuit is all their known for , they should think about changing their name to \"Devils Teeth Biscuit Company \" or identify as a cafe, which would be more accurate. \n\nAnyway, if I was in the area again and there was no line , I guess I will have to order one of their biscuit sammies.", "author": "Brenda B."}

I moved to the area and I have been here enough to share my opinion. \n\nThe breakfast sandwiches are popular and do not disappoint.  I only order the breakfast sandwich and somehow every visit, it needs clarification 2-3x that I only want or ordered the breakfast sandwich and not the \"special.\"  They always imply that you want or ordered the special so you have to fight this battle every time. That's frustrating. \n\nThe bacon cheddar muffin is delicious. I'm hooked on those at the moment.  The banana strawberry muffins are dense and lacking in flavor.  The cinnamon rolls are best served warm. They'll microwave it for you if you ask. Zucchini fig bread is also good. They're inconsistent in their servings though (thin or thick).  I have yet to try other pastries but some aren't very appealing. BTW, they bake at night, so nothing will be fresh out of the oven, just the assembled breakfast sandwiches. \n\nLet's talk about service, which will probably explain a little about the long line. There's the person who takes your order - sometimes they comprehend, other times they don't. Are they even paying attention?! You move on to the cashier and repeat what you just told the person who packed your pastries - sometimes they comprehend, sometimes they don't. This has happened just about every time I've gone in. Weekday, weekend.  Giving change was a little difficult for one cashier. She just couldn't get it right...and I bought one item. \n\nI think it's time to de-stress and give this place a break.

Then, filled to the brim with thick rustic cuts of bacon, scrambled eggs, avocado and a generous spoonful of sausage gravy. This is so good. I love biscuits and gravy, making this in combination with all the other ingredients a perfect pairing. It's huge too, so you'll be able to share with another person if you can't eat something the size of your fist on an early morning. \n\nStrawberry Muffins: made with fresh strawberries! None of the preservatives, just fresh fruits. It's delicious, a little tart, and not too sweet! Reminds me of summer on the farm.\n\nBacon and cheese scone.

I understand the TLC is needed, but one skillet and one grilled cheese at a time? with the washing and reseasoning in between... longer than it should take. The sandwiches get made SO slowly. I noticed that the cook waits for multiple sandwiches at once, but assembly time was SO slow. I would have liked to see one sheet pan in the oven with sandwiches moving on and off the pan.

There aren't many breakfast sandwiches made on biscuits where I come from.\n\nThe biscuits are immense, and they are excessively stuffed. Of the more decadent options is their Special Breakfast Sandwich that has two eggs, pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, avocado and lemon-garlic aioli. Or you can keep it simple and have the Breakfast Sandwich with two eggs, cheddar cheese and applewood smoked bacon. \n\nThe prices are reasonable. The Special is $6.75 while the Regular is $5.50.

It is best known for the breakfast sandwich-- quite good, the extra-special version with bacon, avocado dressed in an incredible lemony aioli.  If you like biscuits, you will love it.  Dough-nut muffin was alright.  I possess a less exotic palate though.  So...\n\nMy menu move at Devil's Teeth is the \"Bowl of Eggs\".  It did not arrive in a bowl, but rather a brown take-out box carton.  No matter.  Simple well-executed and YUM.  I add avocado, which was two small scoops.  YUMMER.  Super-generous portion of savoury perfectly seasoned scrambled eggs (definitely more than three) easily share-able.  Goes great with the nice hearty bacon cheese green onion muffin, chock full of excellent bacon.\n\nFood orders seem more rapidly delivered than the coffee.  We were half-way done with our breakfast items when the coffee-- just simple pour, brewed stuff, not even espresso drinks-- was finally ready.\n\nAs far as seating, there are only several stools up against the window or the wall with shallow counters.  Tight squeeze to plant yourself inside to chow down.  Outside has more bench seating, but that becomes crowded too.\n\nWarning:  the line gets long, best to try and hit during off-hours (i.e. not on a week-end morning).  It's nice to have someone to hang out with if you do get stuck in a line, so maybe invite a pal along.  Customers are friendly and plenty bring their dogs.

I know they're famous for their breakfast sandwich but I thought their pastries were amazing. What I recommend you try: \n\n1. Cinnamon bun: The buns here are HUGE as definitely tastes better after microwaving for 10-15 seconds. I normally don't like cinnamon buns due to the texture and overly cinnamon taste but this place does it right. I love the doughiness of the center and the delicious glaze on the top. \n\n2. Breakfast muffin: I forgot what it's actually called but holy crap this muffin is like crack. There's huge bits of bacon in it and its the perfect size for a quick breakfast snack. Again, it tastes a lot better after being microwaved for a few sections. \n\n3. Breakfast sandwich with avocado: This is what this place is famous for and I thought it was pretty good but didn't wow me. The mixture of bacon, egg and biscuit went well together and I loved that they cooked each egg fresh in the back. It wasn't some premade scrambled egg mixture that they make in bulk. \n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall, this place is a must try and I like that there's usually parking around. Warning that this place gets really crowded on weekends especially from 11am-1pm. I'd recommend coming earlier or later if you don't want to wait 30 mins for your sandwich.

Even if your date is lackluster, the pastries will make sure the entire morning isn't a wash.\n\nRating Breakdown:\n1.5/2 Stars for Taste --\nI came here mostly for the $1 Sunday beignets, but when I saw the monster cinnamon roll behind the glass, I knew I needed to one of those as well. I'm not usually a huge fan of cinnamon rolls but this was AMAZING. I had my doubts because it wasn't fresh from the oven, but the compact thin layers crusted thickly with cinnamon sugar made me shed a single tear. Delicious. My beignets (I got three...for myself) almost paled in comparison. I thought the beignets were simply aiite, but for $1 each, they weren't terrible.\n\nMy date offered me a single bite of his breakfast sandwich (even though I gave this stingy mofo half of my cinnamon roll AND he ate one of my beignets. I'm not bitter or nothing) and the biscuit was buttery and delicious. However, I don't think I have enough data to speculate about the deliciousness of the fabled special breakfast sandwich (I do, however, have enough data to say for certain that this boy ain't gettin' another date, nuh uh.) I guess I'll just have to come again to try that sandwich.\n\n0.5/1 Star for Value --\n$1 for a beignet sounds like a steal, but the beignets aren't actually that big. I thought getting three for myself might have been overkill, but they're like...two mouthfuls each. I think I could have easily eaten half a dozen by myself (note: could, not should). Also, paying $5 for a pastry kind of kills my soul a little bit, but I guess that's the going price of pastries in San Francisco these days.\n\n1/1 Star for Customer Service --\nThe workers here are super fast and friendly. The line is always out the door, but they keep it moving. Fair warning though, we had to wait almost 30 minutes for the breakfast sandwich. The beignets came out super quick though.\n\nBonus star because I'd definitely come back when I'm craving pastries...and definitely to try that sandwich! \n\nTL;DR: $1 beignets on Sundays, crack cinnamon rolls, long but worthwhile wait for breakfast sandwich", "author": "Abby W."}

That movie with Chris Rock as a gangsta rapper, but we all know what the move was really about... the Big A** Biscuits! Well, Devil's Teeth Baking Company has these biscuits and they are so dang good. \n\nSpecial Breakfast Sandwich ($6.75) - Craving an awesome breakfast sandwich? This is it. A large buttermilk biscuit packed with bacon, scrambled eggs, pepper jack cheese, avocado and lemon garlic aioli.  It looks big, but not that big, but once you start eating, it fills you up really quick. I could barely finish mine. The biscuit is butter and fluffy on the inside, toasted shell on the outside, just the right mix ingredients and textures. Two fist bumps and hug for this sandwich!\n\nBreakfast Sandwich ($5.50) - Buttermilk biscuit, bacon, scrambled eggs, cheddar cheese. \n\nCinnamon Rolls - Decadent. A large roll spun in thin layers that is rife with cinnamon and sugar throughout the tender insides. A sugary glaze on top compliments this perfectly. \n\nOther mouthwatering baked goods I saw:\n\nCoffee Cake\nShark Cookie (shaped like a shark!)\nPeanut Butter and Chocolate Chip Cookie\nGinger Cookie\nOatmeal Cranberry Cookie\nDonut Muffin\nBacon, Beer, Cheddar, Green Onion Muffin\nQuiche\n\nLunch items: \n\nBLT \nLasagne \nChicken Curry \nGrilled Cheese \nSoup of the Day\nTamale pie\n\nThey have a coffee and full espresso offerings. \n\nIf you are in the vicinity, hit up Devil's Teeth for some great breakfast treats!

Snacking on a beignet and hanging out on the bench seats of the public parklet is a pretty relaxing way to spend a Sunday afternoon in the Sunset.\n\nBeignets:\nTo be honest, I wasn't too impressed with the beignet upon first bite. Like any other beignet, it is just a doughnut covered in powdered sugar. But after a few bites, I began to appreciate how light and airy the beignets are. Each of them are as puffy as a pillows, filled with air pockets, and leave a trail of powdered sugar all over my lips and clothing. \n\nDoughnut Muffin:\nI did not care for this muffin-shaped doughnut. It was surprisingly dense. Plus I don't like anything covered in hard crystal sugars, because I find the granules too rough on my palate.\n\nChocolate Chip Cookie:\ndecent choc chip cookie, what more can I say?\n\nCinnamon Roll:\nrather interesting square cinnamon roll. The sugary layers seem as if they were bruleed. This is something you can really sink your teeth into. The ridiculously sweet and moist swirls are really sugar overkill.\n\nKale Parmesan Scone:\nI liked the flavors of parm and kale together. But like most scones, this had a dense, somewhat dry, crumbly texture.\n\nSpecial Breakfast Sandwich - two eggs scrambled with pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, lemon-garlic aioli on homemade buttermilk biscuit:\nMr. Joy picked this up for me when he asked if I wanted breakfast and I said sure. When I unwrapped it, I came upon a monster of a sandwich. I thought no big deal, I can finish it. It was really quite hefty. To say it filled me up is an understatement. Perhaps I felt that way because I don't usually have a big appetite in the morning.\nI thought the eggs and avocado could have used a little more seasoning. It needed more flavor. The biscuit was nice and buttery, but it was crumbling under the weight of all the ingredients in the sandwich. \nIf I were to get this again, I would really need to share it with someone. Or prep for a high-cardio day.\n\nOverall, I really like this bakery. Most of the baked goods are tasty and it has a friendly, home-y feel.", "author": "Joy W."}

I spent about an hour an a half here and during the entire time, there was not one moment when there was not a line, and usually the line was out the door. Tbh, after trying this place, I'm a little surprised. \n\nI tried the special breakfast sandwich, beignets, lasagna, chocolate chip cookie, and banana walnut bread. The better items were probably the special breakfast sandwich and beignets, but to be honest, nothing I tried really blew me away. When I ordered the special breakfast sandwich, they informed me the wait would be 25 minutes, but really, it was more like 45 minuets. The special breakfast sandwich has scrambled eggs, bacon, avocado, pepper jack cheese, and lemon garlic aioli sauce all in a tasty buttermilk biscuit. It was pretty good, but my only complaint is that the ingredients were not spread out enough. The bacon was squished in one corner and I could only taste the aioli in one bite in the center. But it is the item that most people come here to order and it is good. \n\nThe beignets are $1 on Sundays and they came out fresh and warm. They are plain beignets covered in powdered sugar (shake them in the paper bag). If you like beignets, you will probably like these. And for $1, its hard to go wrong.\n\nThe meat (turkey) lasagna was good, but not very special. It was smaller than I expected and the side was all burnt and super hard to chew, making the edible half even smaller. \n\nThe banana walnut bread and chocolate chip cookie did not impress me much. The banana walnut bread was cold and a pinch too dry. The cookie was kind of bland and not delicious. I shared the cookie with 3 people and no one really liked it either. I was surprised cuz so many places have pretty good chocolate chip cookies (Butter Love, Cookie Connection, even Peet's coffee and Starbucks!)\n\nDuring the entire hour and half I was there, there was a lady shouting out names to pick up their order. Her voice was loud. There are no tables, just a small counter with a few counter chairs and an area to hang out outside with wooden benches. It's very SF hip. It's also located a few blocks from the beach. Street parking can be hard to find. \n\nDevil's Teeth Baking Company is a good, hip bakery in SF, very close to the beach. If you come here, I would recommend trying the special breakfast sandwich (if you have the time to wait) and the beignets for $1 (on Sunday).", "author": "Jean S."}

Sorry not the same. The missing avocado may be part of it, but the biscuit was bland and tasted like there was something missing. \n\nThe line goes out the door and there's many people lounging outside for their orders or eating their food but the line goes quick. You can order a cup of coffee to sip on while you wait. They forgot to make my friend's drink but after a little reminder they were quick to get to his order. My friend got the cinnamon roll which is pretty big and rather chewy/sticky from the caramelized sugar on the bread. The chocolate chip cookie could almost be the size of your face and really buttery. \n\nOverall, the experience was mediocre.

We're from the south east and biscuits are something we miss all the time. \n\nWhen we got there is was slammed (to be expected), but we decided to give it a try anyway. I ordered the special breakfast sandwich and a cinnamon roll for later. It took about 45 minutes to get our food which was the first turn off for me. I've been to many places just as busy that can get their food out much faster. And when we finally got the biscuits I was very underwhelmed. It wasn't very buttery, flaky, or tender. If you don't have a lot of experience with biscuits you might enjoy it more, but for me it left a lot to be desired. I also thought the lemon aioli was a strange flavor combination with eggs and bacon. \n\nOverall, nothing was horrible and if it took 10 or 15 minutes to get in and out (like most order at the counter places) I would probably be back pretty often.

Let's not get into how much butter is in this fella, or how it has so many layers it'll make an onion blush, or how one piece is really meant for two...or not.  It has a decadent cinnamon brown sugar butter glaze baked into every nook and cranny. The glaze is a bit hard on top so I like to take it home and warm it up in the toaster. So delicious! \n\nThe donut muffins rolled in cinnamon sugar are a tasty staple and are pretty much what you'd expect - a cross between a fluffy raised donut and a soft cakey muffin. Perhaps they could have named them duffins? Mufnuts? Monuts..?

The breakfast sandwich tastes like heaven.... But I'm sure it has the nutrition facts of hell (Devil's Teeth is such an appropriate name). The ingredients encompass the guiltiest of breakfast comfort foods: \n- Buttermilk biscuit: Delightfully soft texture and butteriness at Goldilocks level--flavorful without being too rich\n- Scrambled eggs: As good as gourmet brunch scrambled eggs. I don't think I can ever go back to those tasteless pre-made egg patties in breakfast sandos at fast food chains\n- Applewood smoked bacon: Thicker than normal bacon and mildly caramelized. Indulgent. \n\nWe got the *special* breakfast sammich, which adds:\n- Pepperjack cheese: Could have used more pepper, but melted cheese always makes breakfast taste better\n- Avocado: Excellent addition, though with the disappointingly small amount and heterogeneous distribution, only a few bites contain avocado\n- Lemon-garlic aioli: Omg so good. This is an aioli that compares with upscale restaurants. The zesty drizzle packs a punch and does a good job balancing out the intense biscuityness\n\nDelicious and memorable, but the $6.75 price tag is pricey especially since it doesn't include tax. However it's still somewhat reasonable-ish considering how everything is housemade, and the fact that breakfast sandwiches in bouge SF brunch places can be more expensive, less tasty, and in smaller portions. \n\nThe bakery features a number of interesting items that look like the playful experiments of a creative and skilled baker: the famous ginormous cinnamon rolls, kale parmesan scones, donut muffins, even a bacon beer cheddar green onion muffin.\n\nOh and they have complimentary dog treats, because it's SF where there are supposedly more dogs than babies--so of course they would have freebies for dogs but not people.\n\nI'm almost glad Devil's Teeth location in the Outer Sunset is out of the way; otherwise I would be tempted to always come here, and I'd be selling my wallet and my soul to the Devil ('s Teeth).", "author": "Edna C."}

Some customers can be rude, impatient, and disrespectful, and it makes working with a smile on that much harder. But the solution/response from employees should never be to react with general apathy and annoyance to each customer who comes through the door.

I ended up sharing it with Christie L. and it was definitely enough for the both of us since we also got a beignet each. \n\nWe also tried the kale scone and bacon/cheddar muffin.

Plenty of street parking that's free, but only one hour. I hear the weekend can get really cray with wait times, but today it was okay. Enter through the left door if looking at the store front and you'll find some pressed orange, carrot, or lemonade at $3 each and straight behind the counter are all the delicious baked goodies. \n\nI got the cinnamon roll ($4.50?) and I have to say I could have passed on it. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't really what I expected of a cinnamon roll. It was more of a crescent like bread cinnamon roll. A little dry and way too much for one person to handle by themselves. I would rather much share it if I were to get it again. I also got an oatmeal cranberry cookie ($2.50) which was absolutely bomb. Just the right amount of oat to craisin ratio. I have to go back to try their other goodies like carrot cake, peppermint cake (seasonal), and their cheddar beer muffin that I read about in so many reviews. \n\nI so highly recommend the special breakfast sandwich made on their delicious flakey scone like bread. Yum. Although the sauce on it was a bit too much for me, it was one of the most delicious breakfast sandwiches I had! Granted that's what the line is for and the wait. Everyone is waiting for that delicious sandwich. You gotta listen hard for your name though since they yell it out. Only downside if you are waiting outside since there is limited seating. \n\nGreat little spot with an ocean view and def very community friendly.

The flavor was great, and it had a very generous amount of avocado which was much appreciated. The most interesting thing about the sandwich is the biscuit bun, which is fairly large. The consistency has a nice buttery flakeyness to it. The only thing I would say is that because the biscuit was so large, it was the dominant taste, and as a result I didn't seem to notice the eggs as much. I'd prefer a slightly smaller biscuit and more eggs.

The biscuit was a bit crunchier than I wanted and not as flaky, but the egg and cheese were nicely cooked and the biscuit did have a great buttery inside. I also got the cinnamon roll, which is HUMONGOUS! The cinnamon roll didn't have any icing on it but rather had tons of cinnamon sugar gooeyness, and flaky layers that reminded me of a croissant.

I called 8 times before driving over Saturday and no answer. \n\nWhen we arrived they not only didn't have the chocolate monkey bread, but the staff member who was helping me said they hadn't had it for weeks. I told him I had been calling to see if they had it before making the hours drive, and he told me with a snarky laugh \"Yeah, we don't answer the phone, especially on the weekend.\" Really? That's your response? Rude! The place wasn't busy when we arrived, really no good reason for that. My friend called while we were there and we didn't even hear it ring. \n\nThere really wasn't much to pick from. I chose a slice of zucchini and fig bread. The staff member said it would be sweet, when I asked. It wasn't sweet at all. It wasn't even moist, sadly it was the worst I'd ever had. I do not recommend it at all!\n\nI also bought a cheese, bacon and beer muffin. I asked if it had much of a beer taste and was told you couldn't even taste it it was so little beer. After trying it, I spit it right out, it tasted like beer, like bitter crunchy beer. Awful! \n\nThe last thing I bought was their cinnamon roll, I hear they are known for it. I bought this one for a friend. He said it was good, but he only ate half because as he got close to the center it wasn't baked all the way through and was filled with powder.....WOW! \n\nHorrible experience, I would not recommend this place.

I picked up carrot cake for my friend visiting from New York, a peanut butter and chocolate chip cookie for my sis and a lemon bar for my mom!! Everyone was raving from Sunday to now (Wednesday!!) how out of sight these treats were!! The scene was gorgeous, the breakfast sandwiches looked amazing, and the verrrrrrry loooooooong line moved fast!!  I tried the beignets myself, two of them, glad I got two because one was very donut like but the other was hollow; but maybe I should've gotten more to share because it was a crazy amount of powered sugar; I couldn't have put the powdered sugar in my coffee though because the only size coffee is actually pretty small!! All in all, I loved it and the tiny things I would change that I just mentioned, I'd throw out as long as they always offer the cheddar beer bacon muffin!!!! OMG out of this world!! I loved it!!

After extensively stalking the Yelp page, my friend and I--undeterred by the long MUNI rides to the Outer Sunset--trekked over for brunch.\n\nTHIS PLACE IS REALLY, REALLY, REALLY GOOD. You might see a line going out the door, but this is nothing compared to the line at Tartine (it is 1) shorter and 2) moves much faster). I arrived close to 1 PM, and a few minutes before I got to the front of the line, a staff member came out to tell us they were out of beignets for the day. This was devastating at the time, but in retrospect, it wasn't such a big deal because it meant we had room to try other things.\n\nWe ordered two special breakfast sandwiches (we came back for the second one... it was that good), a cinnamon roll, and a donut muffin. I was tremendously impressed with all of the items. Everything about the special breakfast sandwich is just right: the fluffy biscuits, the scrambled egg, the garlic-lemon aioli, the bacon (thick and crispy!!!), the avocado half... I will be dreaming about this sandwich tonight. The cinnamon roll to me is almost a cinnamon roll/sticky bun/monkey bread hybrid--definitely ask them to warm it up for you if you plan to eat it on the spot. My friend was not impressed with the donut muffin, but I thought it was amazing. For $2, you get a deliciously soft, cinnamony, dense but fluffy donut-muffin lovechild. How could that possibly go wrong?\n\nPlanning my next trip to Devil's Teeth right now TBH.", "author": "Kelly R."}

However, on my recent trip to Devil's Teeth they took 20 minutes to get 2 sandwiches to me and all the while they were giving people who ordered behind me theirs. I didn't make a fuss about it because their sandwiches are that good. The bad review comes from their VERY POOR HAND HYGIENE. While I was waiting I noticed two guys handling money, touching the pastries, and cooking the pieces for the breakfast sandwiches. They NEVER washed their hands in between. I even noticed one guy scratch his head, handle garbage and continue to touch the pastries with his bare, UNWASHED hands. I don't normally write reviews, especially bad ones but in this case I felt a social responsibility to get this public service announcement out.\n\nSorry Devil's Teeth, but even the best breakfast sandwich in the world isn't worth potentially getting sick due to dirty hands.", "author": "Venice L."}

Stopped by at around 9 am on a Friday and there was no line. Ordered a special breakfast sandwich bc after seeing all those reviews, how could I not????\n\nSat and waited about 15 mins for the sandwich, which I didn't mind because they're literally made to order. You can see straight into the kitchen from the counter, so I saw the dude working on the sandwiches in the back. It finally came out... I unwrapped it and OH. MY GOD. THE STEAM. COMING OUT OF THE SANDWICH. THE LAYERS OF BUTTERY FLAKY GOODNESS OF THE HOME MADE BISCUIT. I DON'T EVEN LIKE BISCUITS!!!!! I BUT I LOVED THIS ONE!!!!!!!!!! And the cheese and the eggs and the bacon COOKED. TO. PER. FECT. ION. And the avocadoooo and the aioli my goodness I'm dying just thinking about it. What more could you possibly want in a breakfast sandwich????? \n\nSpecial breakfast sandwich? VERY special indeed. Singlehandedly THE BEST breakfast sandwich I've ever had in my life. The biscuit was holding its own... Usually biscuits fall apart under the slightest pressure but not this biscuit. No sir. This biscuit was dense but not heavy. Don't know how they managed to do that. I'm not even a huge fan of breakfast sandwiches because most of them end up soggy and sad and the eggs are weird and rubbery or the cheese is chalky or the avocado isn't ripe or you take a bite of the bacon and you chew it for an eternity because it wasn't cooked properly but NOT THIS SANDWICH!!! Every component of this sandwich was made perfectly and when combined, it naturally made the perfect breakfast sandwich. Granted, she's not a looker (check out the pic I took), but she's definitely a keeper. They should rename it \"The Only Breakfast Sandwich You Will Ever Want to Eat For the Rest of Your Life\". \n\nThis sandwich changed me. I am a changed woman.

Seating is great outside on a nice day, and there are a couple stools inside to wait for your food.\n\nAbout the food... I actually ate the donut muffin on the way to see him, so it didn't even make it out of the car LOL. Basically a muffin-shaped donut with cinnamon sugar topping. Delicious! It had more of a dense texture--think more cake donut and definitely not krispy kreme. But I loved it!\n\nWhen I finally got to his house, I opened the foil wrapped special breakfast sandwich... It was glorious. The huge heaping of fluffy, perfectly scrambled eggs, the generous portion of avocado, and the crispy bacon peeking out of the freshly baked buttermilk biscuit was so appealing to me! (Did I just make you hungry?) It was still warm thankfully so I took my first bite and was soooo happy. The lemon garlic aioli made a huge difference in the sammy and wasn't too lemony for my taste! In my opinion, I would definitely TREAT YOSELF with the special breakfast sandwich instead of the normal one... Once you try it, you'll never go back hahaha.

I'm known for getting hangry rather quickly, but was promised one of the best breakfasts of my life. We both ordered the Special Breakfast and a drip coffee, then proceeded to wait even longer for our food to come out. The coffee was tasty, and the sugar/cream station wasn't too congested. While we waited, we hung out by the stack of books near the front door. I really like the idea of being able to grab a book while you eat or wait. \n\nOnce we sat down with our food, I had to constantly remind myself to chew and swallow instead of inhaling the entire breakfast sandwich at once. I have to admit, the Special Breakfast was delicious. The giant biscuit alone was worth the wait, and the aioli was especially tasty. There was a generous helping of everything, including the avocado, which people tend to skimp on. It was a big sloppy mess and I loved every minute of it.

This place is kid friendly and has colorful chalk for children to draw on the city walkways with.\n\nThey also serve savory dishes, sandwiches and sourdough bread. So, if you aren't in the mood for something sweet, there are plenty of other options to choose from at this bakery.\n\nThe only excuse I have for going on such a sugar crazed frenzy is \"The devil made me do it.\" Yeah, that's it. \n\nMeanwhile, I'll think about repenting later just to sin here all over again. \n\n*Throws holy water on myself*\n\n*shudders*", "author": "Ann S."}

This is what took me all the way out to outer sunset to try Devil's Teeth Baking Company. I think I may have built this sandwich up a bit too much in my mind though, because it didn't quite live up to my expectations. \n\nSpecial Breakfast Sandwich - 3/5 - The biscuit was decent, but average overall. It was quite large though, as was the sandwich itself. This thing was loaded with avocado which I enjoyed. There was a good amount of bacon, although it was very thin cut and could have been thicker. The egg in this sandwich was scrambled which I didn't care for. I would have much preferred it fried and runny. There was a small layer of pepperjack cheese which was good, but got overpowered by the avocado. It was altogether a decent breakfast sandwich, but I do think there are better and I don't really agree\n\nApple Turnover - 4/5 - Very nice flaky crust with some sort of added seasoning. Together felt light and airy.\nChocolate chip cookie - 2/5\nPeanut butter cookie - 2/5\nZucchini fig bread - 4/5 - This was unique and interesting. Unfortunately it is being discontinued.\nLemon bar - 3/5\nSeasonal coffee cake - 3/5 - The seasonal flavor was pear, but it wasn't really noticeable.\nBacon beer cheddar muffin - 4/5 - Great savory combination of flavors. \n\nDonut muffin - 5/5 - Amazing. The texture was perfect on this one and the taste was great as well.\nCinnamon roll - 5/5 - This was very, very good. It also was not what I was expecting. It is much more dense and chewy than your average cinnamon roll and it definitely made it turn out better.\n\nOverall, I liked Devil's Teeth a lot, but it wasn't for the breakfast sandwich that made the 2015 7x7 list.

What I think they gave me instead was some sort of potato soup, which tasted fine, but was a letdown in terms of paring with the grilled cheese. \n\nThe second point of disappointment- they gave me the vegetarian lasagne, which I wouldn't have minded, except that it was swimming in grease (refer to photo).

Today I found myself near the beach and this was going to be my breakfast spot.\n\nAs foretold by many that I know, there was a line out the door. There were also plenty of people waiting for their food seated outside as well.  I walked in line and waited patiently. The first thing I noticed was the pastry case. Lots of pastries behind the glass. Clearly there was a rush this morning because most of the shelves were empty. \n\nThe menu is very straight forward. From pastries, breakfast sandwiches, coffee, tea, etc. The offer what most breakfast/brunch places tend to offer. \n\nThe inside of this place is rather small and compact. There are several stools for sitting but not enough space to move around. Put it like this, the line descends into the sidewalk because the distance from the pastry case to the sidewalk is less that 8 feet, roughly! The nice thing about this place is that they have an order and pickup sign. That makes a huge difference. There is not uncertainty when you arrive where you need to be in order to get your food. \n\nThere were about 6 employees working today. I guess that is the normal amount of employees to have. This definitely made a difference in expediting the line. THAT IS COOL!!! \n\nCustomer service is good as well. Greeting followed by an order request is always a plus! CHEEE. I ordered the Special Breakfast Sandwich because I have heard enough comments about it that I had to try it myself. I also got a chocolate chip cookie just to see if it passes MY COOKIE test.\n\nAfter placing my order I waited and just took in everything from this place. The books, the kitchen, customer engagement, speed of service, and overall experience are things that I monitor when determining how well a business functions.\n\nAfter waiting for 5 to 6 minutes I received my food and was on my way. Excellent. \n\nWhen I got home I opened my food and examined my sandwich. Not the biggest sandwich in the world but decent. I saw the eggs and could smell the avocado. NICE!! First bite, good! Not sandwich that I rave about but more of a snack. I finished eating the whole sandwich in under 3 minutes. I mean, it was good but gone to fast. The reviews that I had heard made this sandwich seem like the GODZILLA of breakfast sandwiches, NOT THE CASE! Quality sandwich yes but not the GOLIATH that is made out to be. If the sandwich was doubled in size then this would be a TOTALLY DIFFERENT REVIEW. But hey, if you like the special breakfast sandwich go and have a great SNACK! \n\nAs far as the Chocolate Chip cookie. It passed the texture test. It has passed the chip test. The only discrepancy is that the cookie was not as soft as I thought it would be. Maybe I got the a bad cookie or something but mine was too hard. That does not fly for me. The appearance and size was great but the taste was just NOT GOOD. I expected so much better from this place based on the reviews and recommendations. If this can be fixed then this review can be updated to a 5 star review.\n\nOverall, I would come back here if I happen to be in the area but I would not come back because I craved something from here. It is nice that this place is close to the beach. For all the surfers that build up an appetite after being out in the water all day this place is convenient. Also, for the locals in the area this place probably makes getting that cup of coffee in the morning a little easier because of the location. \n\nNuff said, your turn!", "author": "Robert F."}

Came here on a Saturday around 10:30am. I sampled a wide variety of things; a few thoughts below:\n\nSpecial breakfast sandwich: clearly the bestseller, but I didn't think it was worth the 30 minute wait. (Also, a little frustrating that the woman who took our order didn't inform us of the extensive wait; we only learned about it after hearing a few other people order after us and get warned of the wait. PLUS, it's a scrambled egg sandwich and the biscuits are already cooked - how on earth does it take so long to make these??) Very thick cut bacon but I thought it was overcooked (very hard.) Avocado and cheese worked well in the combination.\n\nParmesan kale scone: probably my favorite! The cheesy flavor and light, fluffy texture make this one a winner.\n\nBlueberry scone with lemon glaze: strong fruity flavor and nice texture (and the blueberries within were nice), but $5 seemed a little steep.\n\nBacon beer cheese muffin: very dense, so not my favorite texture, but the flavor was great - cheesy, with large bacon bits throughout.\n\nChocolate chip cookie: okay. It didn't really stand out to me in either butteriness or chocolatiness. The chocolate chip cookie at Arizmendi is a much stronger contender in my opinion...\n\nKale/bacon/garlic quiche: not great. It just tasted really eggy, and none of the other flavors came through (where's the cheese??)\n\nDonut muffin: pretty much a moist coffee cake rolled in cinnamon sugar. Sure, it was a decent muffin, but it didn't have a lot in common with donuts. \n\nCinnamon roll: not only gigantic, but delicious! This is definitely something they've perfected and I can see why it's a crowd favorite. The inner layers are sweet and fluffy, and the edges are crisp and caramelized with the sugary glaze.

Instead, ours were thin and doughy. Secondly, there definitely was only two slices of bacon on the sandwiches (there used to be three). My son says he asked somebody at the counter about that recently, and they told him it was because the price of bacon has gone up. Fair enough, but so have the prices on your sandwiches (20% since you opened). I'm fine with paying more for a prepared meal when the cost of ingredients goes up...but not so much with paying more for less.\n\nThere is also a noticeable inconsistency in the size of the breakfast sandwiches. We got three sandwiches. Two of them had maybe 1-1.5 eggs in them and the third had about 2.5 eggs in it. I noticed others with regular breakfast sandwiches varying noticeable in size. I hope Devils Teeth works on better uniformity in their breakfast sandwiches.\n\nLastly, and this is a big thing for me, I watched a person in the back doing food prep. He was cutting up 3-4 large blocks of cheese using his bare hands (ewww!). Maybe he washed his hands; maybe he didn't. That isn't the point. Plastic food prep gloves don't cost much...people handling food for others to consume should be wearing them.\n\nNow $6 and of lesser quality than the signature item which put them on the map and made them a destination, I still think Devils Teeth breakfast sandwiches are OK. It's a few blocks away, so it's convenient. However, I can't see myself continuing to recommend Devils Teeth as a destination to my friends in other parts of SF for an average sandwich and questionable food prep hygiene.", "author": "Michael W."}

So, I asked for less mayo and less mustard. What happens? The BLT comes out literally dripping of mayo and mustard. The mustard was so intense I couldn't eat more than a few bites and had to toss the rest. It's a bummer for sure because I love this place. I'll also add whenever a friend orders the BLT they forget to make it. So weird but it has happened every single time to them as well as a few times to me.

You can taste the butter in each bite.  But the most incredible part is the candied sugar crust that adds an amazing crunch which is lacking in a typical cinnamon roll.  At $4.25, this roll is humongous (more appropriately sized for 2 people) and worth every penny and is hands down one of my favorite baked goods in SF.  Oh and we came at 11:15am on a Saturday and they had not run out.  \n\nOn my second visit I also tried the breakfast sandwich and it too was good.  The biscuit was soft and buttery with a crisp edge and the eggs, bacon, and melted cheddar were great.  I wolfed it down and 20 minutes later felt insanely full.

How ironic.\n\nThis wasn't my first time at Devil's teeth, so I was excited to try something new once more! I've had their chocolate chip cookie, ginger cookie, and a mini pie back in the day. The other day I was able to try their Blackberry Crumble Cake and their Bignets! I didn't know they had those!\n\nThe Blackberry Crumble Cake actually wasn't as sweet as I had hoped it to be. Although I normally like my crumble cakes with a combination of coffee in one hand, this pastry was easily edible without it. The crumble on top did not fall apart like other places would but it was not as flaky as I normally liked either. The cake itself was moist and heavy but the large blackberry's definitely had their chance to make an appearance. \n\nThe bignets came out to be small miniature donuts that was slapped in a bag of powdered sugar. We ordered two and shook the crap out of the paper bag until the powdered sugar started to release into the air. We ripped open the bag to only see that only one was covered entirely though. Still, I thought it was a good chance to see what the hubub was about. The bignet bread itself was very fresh and hot. It was lightly crusted on the outside and thick and soft on the inside. The powdered sugar was a definite MUST to make this bignet complete. On the other hand, the bignet without minimal powdered sugar was not as succesful. It literally tasted like a plain unflavored donut. I would've preferred some glazed icing.\n\nI loved their outdoor seating and the community that this small bakery brings together. The bakers in the back are very kind and very honest of their favorites. So if you don't know what to choose, it doesn't hurt to close your eyes and point, because all of them will hit your taste buds just as good as the next!", "author": "Linda K."}

I have heard great things about this place and was excited to try it out. \n\nI don't know if they've had a rough morning or anything but from the first look of it, I must doubt the cleanliness. Honestly if the reviews weren't so great, I'd walk straight out. I could see a bunch of dirty towels next to the espresso machine, the beignet dough wasn't covered and it was just sitting on the countertop with everything going on. \n\nLong story short, the reg girl was rude, every staff in the store (except for one dude) act like everyone owes them money. The special sandwich was good, the pastries were ok, and the beignet was dense, it was fried dough with sugar so it was still good. I know it's only $1 but don't call it a beignet when it is clearly not. \n\nIm pretty positive that I'll not be coming here again.

My grandmother confirmed the delivery in advance the week prior via both email and telephone, and she and my mother began calling the bakery when an hour had passed since the cakes were supposed to be delivered. \n\nNo one picked up the phone at Devil's Teeth for three hours during which the bakery was open (noon - 3pm). My mother saved the celebration by driving to Ambrosia Bakery, which quickly prepped a substitute chocolate cake and custard tart with my grandfather's name. Thanks, responsible bakers of Ambrosia! You saved my grandfathers birthday today.\n\nAs the celebration was winding down, we finally receive a phone call from Devil's Teeth. What followed was pitiful. The bakery promised a full refund, but said they'd still deliver the order (too little too late). \n\nThe catch? They couldn't even deliver the lemon bars OR raspberry bars because \"they were under cooked today,\" so instead, they brought some brownies and muffins from (I assume) their storefront's morning display. The chocolate cake arrived (remember, too late to count!) squished. The second cake, a buttercream white cake, was only slightly less damaged.\n\n\"You had just ONE job\" sums it up. Funny how their website claims they specialize in cakes and catering. This review won't overcome the effusive praise that this place's cinnabuns and expensive sandwiches have somehow earned it, and it looks like DTBakingCo has glowing approval from many well-respected hipster websites. But do not count on this place to take an expensive, important order seriously - or even answer your calls.\n\nUPDATE: Devil's Teeth dutifully returned my grandmother's $122 today, as well as a few lemon bars. \n\nI'll just quote her here: \"However, guests had travelled a distance for the occasion.  The hostess had worked months arranging the event in his honor-- and not to have the cakes--high point of the festivity not appear broke the spell of the work and the festivity.\n\nNo good will can return that rising happiness.\"", "author": "Levi G."}

At this point I was not having it because it was a surprise to us that we had to wait that long on top of the line.\n\nProps to the lady on the register who handled everything smoothly.

I had gotten their donut muffin, chocolate chip cookie, scone, and a couple of other items. All of them failed to impress me. I have a huge sweet tooth so as it is, my expectations were high and they were most likely set even higher with everything I heard about this place from newsletters, reviews, stories, etc. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but nothing that I couldn't have a) made myself at home or b) gotten at some other bakery.\n\nHOWEVER, their savory items... WOW oh WOW.... I am a huge breakfast person so when I find a breakfast sandwich that literally makes me salivate, I know I am in heaven. Their special breakfast sandwich is what will make me come all the way here from SOMA because it is that good. I thought it would honestly be too much with the amount of ingredients that are in there but shockingly, it worked. Now, I have to warn people that when it is crowded, it can take up to 15-20 minutes to get this sandwich so do not come here if you are in a rush. However, if you have the patience, then absolutely get one. I also got the savory muffin. Now I don't usually like \"savory pastries\" aka bacon scones, bacon/chive biscuits, ham croissants, but this muffin... AMAZING. I don't remember what was in it but it was just as good and filling as the breakfast sandwich.\n\nAgain, not a huge fan of the sweet items, but I will DEFINITELY be coming back for the breakfast sandwich and/or savory muffin!", "author": "Kunal N."}

But today, my first experience, was wrought with errors. \n\nFirst, they were out of everything by 10am. They close at 4pm, so to run out if so much before the halfway point in their day is kind of rough. A bakery should have a better handle on inventory. Other established bakeries in the area don't seem to have that problem.\n\nSecond, we waited a very long time for our food. People behind us in line were getting their orders before us. So I asked the girl at the counter and she just handed me my sandwiches. They were just sitting there. \n\nThird, they messed up our order. Because what we ordered was more expensive, she charged us again.   We ended up paying $31 for three breakfast sandwiches and a cup of coffee. When we asked the cashier, he said, \"sounds about right.\" But I think he's wrong.... The sandwiches we ordered are only $6.75 each and a cup of coffee is $2.75. Math.\n\nFourth, when we asked to get our correct order, the cook threw a major tantrum and was hate cooking!!! We ate HATE SANDWICHES. And their kitchen is in plain view, so to see all that anger then be handed the food was a little disheartening.\n\nAnd last but definitely not least, I saw one of their employees handle food without gloves. That wouldn't be a problem, but she was on her cell phone, touching other stuff, bringing food to people  in the front of the restaurant, and I didn't see her wash them again before returning to touching food. Oh the unsanitary! \n\nAnyways, I love their food though, so I'll likely return, but not before considering other places before. Donut muffin. Special breakfast sandwich.

While the menu is not extensive the items are pretty good. The portions are big  - I liked the BLT most.\n\nThe breakfast bars and cinnamon roll are rich and sugary, definitely needs to be shared.

The coffee is strong so careful if you're not a regular drinker. I also like they carry coconut water and fresh juice to go.\n\nAlmost strictly to-go as the only seats are a few high stools facing the street. The parklet outside is nice to sit on a sunny day - it does get crowded.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-08-24", "description": "Out of everything I've tried, the cinnamon roll is the best thing here hands down. Not only is it big, but it's super good. How can you argue with both quantity and quality? I love how it's composed of numerous thin layers rather than a thick piece of rolled up dough. This makes the flavor more homogeneous instead of having thick, distinct zones of cinnamon sugar and dough. I think the flavor of the cinnamon roll is a lot more cohesive this way. Because the layers are thinner, its more condensed and heavier. If you really want a soft, fluffy cinnamon roll, this is not what you're looking for. The cinnamon rolls also have a wonderful caramelized sugar glaze on top. It kinda has that burnt caramel flavor, which adds an intense character. Along with adding flavor, the glaze also gives the top a terrific, sugary crunch. These might be some of the best cinnamon rolls of all time. \n\nA lot of people come here for the beignets too. I like that they're freshly fried and hot. The crust is crispy and generously covered in powdered sugar. They're a bit too dense for my liking though. I prefer beignets that are more airy and fluffy.

So... I've attempted to be a loyal customer by being fine with waiting in line 45 minutes to enjoy Devil's Teeth's really good breakfast sandwiches (did I mention they're really good?).  \n\nHowever, today I wanted 10 of their really good biscuits (to bring to a get-together).  After waiting 20 minutes in line, I was told: \"We are not selling biscuits today.\"  Here's where I get irritated. Are you not a bakery?  I've bought your biscuits in the past, why are they not being sold today? I'm asking for 10, not 50 or 100.  I don't think my proposed transaction is unreasonable.  I'm sure you would have sold me 10 breakfast sandwiches; but that isn't what I want today, and it only occurred to me after I left to order 10 breakfast sandwiches--hold the eggs & bacon...  Biscuit shortage solved by purchasing them from Elite Cafe (they make awesome biscuits too), but I'm not cool with being turned away from my neighborhood joint.\n\nI'll be back waiting in line 45 minutes for biscuits + eggs + bacon soon enough (I'm sufficiently irritated to ask: why does it take 45 minutes for biscuit + egg + bacon...), but I'm disappointed/irritated at the lack of flexibility.", "author": "Ben T."}

It was, after all, 1PM on a beautiful and sunny day, and frankly the last thing I wanted was a breakfast sandwich that includes cheese and buttermilk biscuits.  So in going down the sweets path, I chose to try the Donut Muffin, Almond Swirl Muffin, and Chocolate Chip Cookie.  Out of the three, the Almond Swirl Muffin was my definite favorite.  With a twist of citrus in it, this was absolutely delicious.  I really wanted to like the Donut Muffin, but it was dry and crumbly (maybe it had been out for awhile?) and I wasn't determined to try any more of it after it fell apart in my hands.  The cookie wasn't anything to write home about, and wasn't compelled to finish it either.

The three sandwiches were delicious and the fresh greens (arugula +) in the BLT didn't wilt and it was all still good several hours later. Very very tasty with great bacon. Biscuits for breakfast sandwich. A hearty and crunchy sourdough(?) bread for the others. I tried two out of the three and our little girl of the group said she loved her egg+ sandwich. \n\nThe vibe and service are way better than average for SF. For me, it's the way they projected competence with an efficient and tightly run operation. Or it could be the serious but kind demeanor, salt&sun kissed hair and skin, and busy-but-not-loud character of it all. \n\nSandwiches were a 20-minute wait and few flinched when given that news -- like it was to be expected. Honestly, I wasn't expecting to have to wait that long; the big difference here was that VIBE. I was happy to hang loose because I could feel the wait would be worth it. It was.

Neither me nor our other friend have dietary allergies so we could have ordered something, but didn't feel right supporting a company who hires rude employees with poor customer service skills.

Special biscuit breakfast sandwich $6.75.  The better of the 2 sandwiches and Hubby agreed as we went home and cut them in have and shared the 2 sandwiches. This one has avocado, less eggs but jack pepper cheese and a special aioli sauce which makes the sandwich flavor so much better.\n3. Cinnamon bun - a large bun smothered with carmelized sugar so crunchy on the edges and moist inside with good cinnamon flavor.  I would have preferred less sugar in it.\n4. Parmesan kale scone - A very good tasting scone with kale in it that you can't really taste.\n5. Cheddar bacon onion muffin - if you like savory and salty, this is the one. It sort of reminds me of the baked bacon green onion buns you buy at Asian bakeries but this has more texture and a lot of bacon bits. \nAll the above for $29.

We were being respectful of what seemed like busy, and not trying to get in the way of all of the workers being flustered that there was a lack of biscuits...they continued talking about the lack of it to each other. Anyway, apparently our order was mistaken for lasagna. Not sure how lasagna and quiche get mixed up verbally, but it did. We finally did get the free space to ask the woman at the register - who did not look happy to be there or for me to ask her about the status of our quiche; she sighed and turned around asking who took our order. Someone did come over and said he forgot, mistakenly rushed our \"order,\" lasagna (Which had been out for about 15 mins), opened the fridge, threw two pieces of quiche (small I might add) in to a Togo container into the microwave, pulled them out after reheating them, took one out of the box, places one in another Togo box, gave one to each of us and said here you go. \n\nHe insincerely offered us a cookie or a muffin to compensate for our lengthy wait.

Oh sweet symphony of dense yet soft crumb goodness dusted with sweet sugary heaven. Ahhhh. Perfection. \n\nWe also ordered a veggie lasagna and soup (white bean) and grilled cheese combo. This is where I had to take a star off. The grilled cheese had too little cheese for the thick slices of bread, the soup was a little bland, and the lasagna, while flavorful, was a bit gloppy--too much cheese here. We didn't finish any of the lunch items. Others comment on the breakfast sandwiches, and I can say I kept looking at the perfectly toasted, plump, puffy biscuits resting on a tray in the front--they looked amazing.

This is one of the best bakeries in SF. I live in San Mateo and work in Downtown SF, so I am rarely out at Noriega and 45th avenue. This place is worth the trip to me for three things: Special Breakfast Sandwich, quiche, and the cinnamon roll. Their special breakfast sandwich is quite possibly one of my favorite things I've ever eaten. When I was a kid my favorite thing to eat was a bacon, egg and cheese biscuit from McDonalds. This is similar, but made with real food. The biscuit is ridiculously and the sauce they put on it makes me absurdly happy. The quiche is one of the best I've ever had. It's only rival in my opinion is Tartine's quiche. The cinnamon roll is extremely rich and I can't finish one on my own, but it's good for snacking on the rest of the day. \n\nThis is a small place with little seating inside, but outside (which can be a bit cold due to fog) there is lots of seating.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2014-03-18", "description": "My fiance was born and raised in the Sunset.  He takes much pride in it and loves and has a soft spot for all the old businesses in the area such as Polly Ann's.  I think he's open to change, but not necessarily gentrification.  But then again, pretty much if you're a hipster you'll love it, otherwise, not so much.  Hipsters already invaded the Sunset with Outerlands, and now it's Devil's Teeth Baking Company.  I had to do some convincing, but I finally got him to go with me to try their breakfast sandwich, since I've heard it's so good.  \n\nWe got there around 8:40 this past Saturday and there were already people inside and eating outside, but no wait in line, and not too busy looking.  It picked up right before 9 though.  We placed our order, we shared the Special Breakfast Sandwich ($6.50) and I got a lemon bar ($3) for later as well. The Special Breakfast sandwich is two eggs scrambled, with pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, and lemon-garlic aioli on homemade buttermilk biscuit.  The regular breakfast sandwich just has cheddar instead and doesn't come with avocado and the aioli sauce.  Save the extra $1 and get the original.  They make the sandwiches to order, which is great, but the wait was so long!  We waited for at least 20 minutes for our one sandwich.  That's like a restaurant wait time!  The buttermilk biscuit is so moist and flavorful, but that's all you taste in the sandwich.  We couldn't taste the aioli, the bacon, the avocado or the cheese!  They put out samples of their brownie which I must say I tried and was so moist and decadent.  \n\nLater on, I finally ate our lemon bar which was great, but just like the breakfast sandwich, we felt it was a little overpriced for what it was.  I think it's safe to say that customers should just stick with their sweet baked goods.  Sorry, but there's so many other bakeries that serve savory eats that are worth the calories and the cash (i.e. Craftsman & Wolves).  I may come back to grab something sweet, but was so disappointed on the overly hyped breakfast sandwich.  2.5ish solely for the lemon bar and sample of the brownie.", "author": "Cat C."}

They have almond milk and used another independent coffee roaster. Bicycle coffee??? I forget. I got an almond mocha. They use Scharffen Berger chocolate. Nice taste, not too sweet and you could still taste the coffee flavors\n\nPastries - beignets were piping hot and scrumptious, only Sunday's though. Cinnamon Roll reheated at home the next morning was outrageously delicious. Also had Choco cake, moist and loved the icing. I could tell they use quality ingredients. Next time trying the pie.\n\nBreakfast sando. Nice buttery biscuits nicely seasoned with salt and pepper make the sando. Plus the bacon they use is good quality.\n\nMeat Lasagne - yes, after all this I bought the meat lasagne to go because I did not want to cook later on this lazy Sunday, plus it's playoff Sunday! fresh vegetables and good quality meat they use in this lasagne were well balanced and after reheating in toaster oven at 325 for 25 min, perfect!!!!

Yes, this was for two so we definitely ate with our eyes first  but I can't lie, everything was delicious and we finished everything!!\n\nThe SPECIAL breakfast sandwich was insanely good and that garlic lemon aioli simply MADE this sandwich! eggs scrambled, with pepper jack cheese, applewood smoked bacon, avocado, and lemon-garlic aioli on homemade buttermilk biscuit. Makes your mouth drool doesn't it?? Everything compliments each other so well, you want to finish the whole thing, but honestly, look at the picture... the sandwiches are huge!! And worth every penny. The sandwich comes out hot, and if there's a line, fair warning, you'll prob have to wait a while for it. But like how it was worth every penny, it was worth the wait.  In one bit, you'll taste the nicely, perfectly crisped up bacon, with the cheese melted beautifully with the scrambled eggs, with a nice bite of the avocado and tying it all together with the light taste of lemon and strong taste of garlic from the aioli with a biscuit that you can honestly just eat on it's own, really, just get the sandwich.\n\nNow, the bacon muffin is every bacon lover dream, it's bacon and cheddar mixed in a muffin batter so you can have the wonders of breakfast to go!\n\nCinnamon bun fits perfectly in this to go box, perfectly baked with a nice texture and definitely not too sweet and you will not finish it in one sitting.\n\nI will be back to try everything else. BTW 7x7 recommended their beignets and I had every intention on getting it, but I got distracted by everything else. Lol. I'll be back!", "author": "Hepsie C."}

Not your average cinammon roll that's smothered with a bunch of sugary cream cheese topping. It's just straight up cinammon roll-- dense middle but fluffy and a little bit of crunchy goodness that continues to wrap around into a delicious bun.  I think the little bit of crunchiness comes from the brown sugar crystals they use in between the layers. It's really big though so I usually have to finish one in two sittings. Half for breakfast, and the rest for dessert after dinner :)  \n\nI really liked their soup of the day, which was cream of broccoli!  So yummy and savory.  The coffee is good here too. I was surprised that I had to wait for 20 minutes there for the coffee, but I think I might have just been unlucky and was in between the times when they were waiting for the next batch of coffee to finish brewing.

This is not artisan fare, a la Tartine, this is fulfilling, substantive goodness. \n\nSundays they offer hot, fresh beignets for $1. You can't beat the delicious, warm puffs on a drizzly day. The breakfast sandwiches are made on the best biscuits I can remember. Don't forget to add the house-made hot sauce to the sandwich biscuits, the sauce is tucked away above the water pitcher and utensils. There will be a wait for the sandwich - but don't you want your eggs hot and fresh?!?\n\nThe warm cinnamon rolls are fantastic as well, just gooey enough without being sugar-laden like the mall varieties. We liked the coffee cake, even a day old it kept its moisture. \n\nDon't be deterred if the line goes out the door, they move quickly. The service was friendly and the cashier thanked us for waiting in the light rain. We will be back and you should make a date with the devil too.", "author": "Jason M."}

The beignets perhaps were the better ones we've had in a while, although not the best.\n\n\u00a4 Special Breakfast Sandwich (3.5*). There was a lot going on in this sandwich. Fluffy whipped eggs with bacon, cheese & many other ingredients in between buttery country biscuit buns. I'm not so much into country biscuits, so that dinged some points off for me. But overall, the complex flavors worked & was good.\n\n\u00a4 Beignets (4*). One of the better beignets we've had. It was light & airy with an almost sourdough chewy texture without the sourdough taste. And of course the deep fried doughnut exterior. The powdered sugar adds a slight sweetness. Good stuff.\n\n\u00a4 Cinnamon Roll (2*). Had to try it since so many reviewers were raving about it. For us, it was just too hard & way too sweet. It's hard & slightly dry. The top browned sugar crust is very sweet. As if a large amount of sugar coated then baked until the sugar caramelized on top. If that sounds good & not too sweet to you, then perhaps it's your thing. I'll pass. It's also very dense. Almost broke our plastic fork trying to eat it. So be extra careful with that plastic fork.", "author": "Daniel T."}

Wrapped in foil and put in the oven to melt the cheese.  Delicious.  It's worth the few minutes you have to wait for it.  \nI've been raving about it and I don't know why I haven't gone back.

You don't put mayo and curry powder to chicken, mix it up and call it chicken curry. Zero stars for taste and dry. They didn't even put butter or olive oil when toasting the bread. \n\nLets get to the soup. We had the bean and tomato soup. No flavor and cold right from the fridge. What a waste. \n\nNow the dessert. Got the carrot cake. Yogurt frosting. Yucks. Where is the cream cheese. And if you put yogurt at least don't overdo it. \n\nChocolate cake : Bitter.

For me, those things are the breakfast sandwich, donut muffin, chocolate cake, carrot cake, and cinnamon roll. But what am I saying? You can get these things anywhere, can't you?? No. First, homemade biscuits with deliciously seasoned eggs, thick bacon and cheese is hard to find that's done well. The donut muffin is a light muffin with a good dusting of cinnamon and sugar. I like the chocolate cake here because it's a good, homemade cake, not fancy, just like I would make at home. The size is generous too. The cinnamon roll is carmelized on top, pretty sweet and a perfect size to share. Oh, and the lemon bar is moist and tangy.

We also ordered the regular breakfast sandwich but I think it is definitely worth adding $1.25 for an upgrade.  For some reason the regular one was really bland, and since it came with the delicious biscuit, it was a bit dry without the avocado or the sauce added to the special version.\n\nThe donut muffin melted in your mouth!  I couldn't tell whether it was a fried muffin or a baked donut rolled in cinnamon sugar, but anyways it was THAT good.\n\nThe cinnamon roll was a bit pricy, but it was HUGE.  I think they made a good call not adding any cream cheese frosting so it was not overly sweet.\n\nI also ordered the slow dripped coffee.  I guess it was actually the only thing I didn't enjoy as much.  It has a more \"sour\" after-taste that perhaps would be just right to some people, but not me, since I always drink my coffee black.

It might seem out of the way, as it's tucked away deep into the Sunset near the beach, but it's worth it. No question about it. \n\nI love the openness of the store, as you can see directly back into the kitchen and watch as the staff cooks, bakes, and prepares different foods. The majority of the staff are young adults, so the atmosphere has a pretty young and laid back vibe. This is not to mention that the staff ifs incredibly friendly and helpful as well, so there's another bonus. It's a fairly small shop that can get very crowded during peak hours in the morning and especially on weekends. Also, try not to show up moments before they close because they'll most likely have run out of just about everything!\n\nTHOSE CINNAMON ROLLS THOUGH. Hearing great things about them was what first brought me here a few years back. And yes, I've been coming back ever since. Those cinnamon rolls just melt in your mouth and can satisfy any sweet tooth. They're so big too! So you can always pass it around to let others try a bite (or not if you really want it for yourself...no one will judge, don't worry). \n\nAside from their cinnamon rolls, I love their bacon scallion cheddar muffins. YUMMM. Their breakfast sandwiches are SO GOOD too, so definitely choose either of those two things if you're craving something that's more savory and breakfast-like because you'll be a happy camper. Other favorites of mine include the lemon bars and the carrot cake.\n\nMaybe you're coming here after a long day at the beach with your family, or perhaps you're stopping by here on a weekday morning on your way to work, or maybe you're just choosing to spend your sunny Saturday morning reading a book while sitting right outside of Devil's Teeth with a cup of their coffee and a few of their pastries.

Last Sunday I really needed to use the restroom and had to yelp some type of coffee place that was open around that time.  (It was around 6:50AM).  This location popped up and I figured with the walk I'd be here around opening.  Then as I was walking here I decided to read up on some of their items and got excited on some of the recommendations I read.  I ended up ordering a Special Breakfast sandwich, a lemon bar, 4 beignets, a cafe au lait, and a hot cocoa.  The drinks didn't stand out but the food did.  beignets and sandwich were made to order.  Beignets weren't cafe du monde quality but it was good stuff.  Apparently only on Sundays and $1 a pop.  I opt for the Special Breakfast sandwich (regular was around $5.50 and Special around $6.75?  Something along those lines).  The special was the way to go.  That garlic aioli and avocado, yum.  Bacon was perfect.  The biscuit was ok...my only other memory of biscuit sandwiches were from Pine State Biscuits in Portland and that place blows everything outta the water so it was an unfair comparison.  Lemon bar was tasty.\n\nWe came back to go crabbing this past Sunday again.  This time we did not arrive until 9AM and there was a hefty line.  And since most things are made to order it took a good 30 mins from ordering to getting my sandwich.  Once again got the special breakfast sandwich, lemon bar, two beer bacon cheddar muffins, veggie quiche for my friend, two coffees, a latte and a chai latte.  I didn't care for the chai latte.  My friend said the quiche was tasty.  The breakfast sandwich was still as good as ever.  Opt out of the beignets which I later regretted.  I ate the muffins later in the day (around 5PM) and they tasted good.  I can only imagine how great it would be fresh.  You can taste the beer, I'd imagine this would be bomb with chili.\n\nSince I needed to use the restroom again I returned solo around 3PM.  No lines this time.  They close at 4PM so most of their items were sold out.  No more beignets, no more biscuits so whomeever came for a breakfast sandwich had to get it with sourdough bread, no more coffee cake or carrot cake.  They had plenty of lemon bars and beer muffins.  I instead opt to try to chicken curry salad for lunch.  It was tasty.

Unfortunately, I had to dock off one star because the coffee isn't very good here. Baked goodies are your strength, coffee not so much. I got a single cup drip coffee yesterday morning, and it tasted so weak and watered-down. It also took at least 5 minutes to wait, and I understand since it's a busy Sunday morning. But I could make a stronger cuppa Joe in 3 minutes with a bolder taste and not watered-down. My sister ordered the latte the last time she came here, and she was very unimpressed with the taste of the latte.

So we went and I thought the food and ambiance location etc was really a 4 star.  OK food, friendly enough staff, OK prices, prompt enough service.  Very crowded when we were there.  Can't really figure why this place is so very popular. It was fine, but not super 5 star fine.  Just fine.\n\n I had to deduct a star for 3 reasons. \n\n First they have a very strange procedure when you get your food. The food order taker and the cashier have NO communication.  You HAVE to remember what you ordered so the cashier can charge you the right price.  I forgot what my date ordered so I took a guess and the cashier had to look up my order to charge me. So, in other words, either order something expensive if you are dishonest and announce a cheaper purchase to the cashier, OR memorize exactly what your date ordered or else you look like a fool.  \n\nThe second, and bigger reason for me removing a star, is the staff have no idea what is in their food.  I suspect they cook with hydrogenated oil and/or hydrogenated oil is in their pre-ordered breads and muffins.  Note that hydrogenated oil makes processed food taste habit formingly heavenly, but kills Americans (but not Europeans, Canadians or Japanese because it is a banned substance in these more advanced countries, look it up in the internet).  If they knew whether this substance was in their list of ingredients, I would be tempted to give them more stars.\n\nFinally, since the place is crowded and the music is very loud, the server either needs to shout really really loud when they call your name, or turn down the music. They can save a lot of time and aggravation.", "author": "alfredo n."}

I never make a trip here without getting at least one.  I bring em home for my family and they love them too.  The muffin is like eating a cake donut, always soft and moist.  They're rolled in cinnamon sugar, which also reminds me of churros!  I love churros.  If you haven't been to Devil's Teeth yet, you need to get going, NOW.  If nothing else on the menu entices you, just get a donut muffin.  Get two.  Get three.\n\nThe cinnamon rolls are also to die for.  They're buttery, gooey, sticky, sweet.  The rolls fill up the entire box they come in.  I can't eat one of these by myself.  My family and I shared one roll.  I ate my 1/4 of it in pieces, it just tasted better that way.\n\nLemon bars are also amazing..and they're bigger than your hand.  \n\nAnother reason to try Devil's Teeth?  THE BANANA CREAM PIE CREAM PUFFS!  Okay I know not a lot of people like banana cream pie, but I do.  So seeing them in a cream puff blew my mind.  When I saw these I knew I had to get one for my dad to try since he loves banana cream pie, too.  I had a few failed attempts at picking some up though, they sell out quick!  When I was finally able to get them I was so happy.  My dad isn't big on sweets but he ate the whole puff!  They don't skimp on filling either!  The creamy custard filling is sweet, but not too sweet, lots of bananas, too!  The cream puff its self was nice and fluffy, not dense at all.  I hate dense cream puffs.\n\nAND TRY THE BREAKFAST SANDWICH.  I had no idea what I was in for when I ordered this monstrosity of a sandwich, seriously..its the size of a soft ball.  I saw other people sitting outside eating it so I figured it HAD to be good.  And oh is it good.  The sandwich comes on a hot, fresh biscuit with thick slices of bacon, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs.  I love anything with cheese and bacon to be honest.  The biscuit was SO goooood....sweet and buttery, crumbly but not TOO crumbly.  \n\nI've yet to make it for beignet Sunday.  I tried once but they were all sold out.\n\nDevil's Teeth is truly a gem for the outer sunset.  The staff is extremely warm and friendly.

Twice I have ordered something and the other two times, it was because my friends really wanted to see what it was like. I really like how there is outdoor seating. However, it is still super packed in AND out. And super busy. With so many people filling orders, kudos to them for being able to match the pace. \n\n- Iced Chai - super, super yummy. It has a really nice kick to it so for people who really hate ginger or any form of spicy, this isn't for you. I really like how the flavors are all there and it's a well rounded drink. Have ordered it twice and have not regretted it. \n\n- Cinnamon Roll - This...is a monster of a cinnamon roll. It is about the side of an average coaster (for cups). I don't think I could close the lid on my container because it was so big. It was really good and it could definitely be shared with friends. However, since I was so greedy I ate the whole thing and after the...fifth? bite it was too sweet for me. Almost cloyingly so. For my palate, I usually like things less sweet. \n\nBEIGNET - I had one...so...beignet. It was good. I really liked how I had to shake the powdered sugar in the paper bag to get it covered. It wasn't...amazing. But it was good. It had the right sweetness. Texture was good. However, I noticed for one of my friends because she got six of them, she had to double bag (which costs an extra 10 cents). So in terms of being able to travel with a lot of them or saving them for later...probably not a good idea. \n\n--\n\n-1 star = overly sweet cinnamon roll + pastry containers.

Their staff is always friendly, courteous, and have warm smiles.  My complaint is the lengthy time to get breakfast and go.  This morning I ordered two breakfast sandwiches and 35 minutes later I was still waiting.  I was forced to drive my 8th grader across the park to school, WITHOUT our sandwiches in order for him not to be late.  Thanks to 7-11 on the way, my kid was able to get something to eat before school; of coarse, it was lower quality than Devil's Teeth.  \nSeveral minutes later, after dropping my son at school, I came back to Devil's Teeth and picked up the sandwiches I ordered an hour earlier.  \nSo here's a suggestion, if the sandwiches are going to take longer than usual, give us a \"heads up\" when ordering.  Had I known, I would've pick up something like their yogurt parfait or even a pastry for my kid.  The cashier did apologize and said they \"had huge orders before [mine].\"  So let me know that when ordering.  I'll make a different choice, appreciate the warning, and keep coming back as a happy customer.  \nActually, I'll still keep coming--just never again in the morning!  Understand that this is not a matter of not giving myself enough time--which I did!  It was just inordinately long to have to wait 35 min for two breakfast sandwiches.  But their great tasting food and cheerful attitude will bring me back.\nIf you want to avoid crowds, don't come at peak hours because their clientele has been steadily growing.

It was good, but nothing earth shattering. However, today, the Manpanion and I dropped by after an early morning rendezvous at the Japanese Tea Gardens (gotta love free admission, gotta hate that you have to be there around 9-ish to take advantage).\n\nWe ordered the special breakfast sandwich (for him), ham and bacon quiche (for me), and a cinnamon roll (for us). Oh my, where to begin... His breakfast sandwich was delicious. Since it was the day's special, it consisted of bacon, eggs, pepper jack cheese, and avocado that was lovingly embraced by a buttery biscuit. The Manpanion has a healthy appetite and isn't much of a breakfast person. However, if he says he loved this sandwich, this should give you an idea of how hearty  and satisfying it was.\n\nI had the ham and bacon quiche and it was pretty hefty too. Granted, it wasn't as big as the breakfast sandwich. However, it was really meaty - I'm talkin' chunks of bacon and ham. It wasn't too eggy or dry. The meat, eggs, and veggies were all nicely balanced. Also, it wasn't over-doughed! It's a total winner in my book!\n\nFinally, we split a cinnamon roll. I'm not usually big on these things, but since the reviews claim that this is all the rage, I figured it wouldn't hurt to try. HOLY JEEBUS! This roll is unlike any other roll I've had. When I think cinnamon roll, I'm thinking overly sweet frosting on top of dried cinnamon bread. This is definitely NOT the case here. The roll was soft and buttery (you must get this heated up) and the glaze was absolutely perfect! It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet and it simply melts in your mouth.

I love local roasters where they generally use smaller beans and a lighter roast.

Also love their Cafe au lait.\n\nOh and of course the banana cream puff, beer muffin that is made with cheddar, bacon, beer and green onion were both delicious.\n\nMy friend who introduced me to this bakery found out I didn't try the cinnamon bun and was nice enough to go out there and got me the gigantic delicious rock candy style sweetness!

A pleasant addition to the neighborhood is Devil's Teeth!  I came here with my dear friend Jonathan W. to indulge our sweet ol' teeth on their $1.00 Beignet's during what they call Beignet Sunday.  \n\nUpon walking up to this new spot, I first noticed a chalk-colored sidewalk just outside of the bakery.  There are benches on both sides of the entrance door, and buckets full of jumbo chalk for little kids and big kids alike to enjoy! What a cute little idea!\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elgE2cUhKotsLoBUdghexQ?select=u6hi_2E4mG3g5g-k20RmVg\n\nDevil's Teeth has such a cute beachy feel to it, with a company-name surfboard mounted on the wall, to the uneven wooden counter tables. I love the laid-back feel.\n\nSo Beignets!  Freshly baked Beignets made to order for only a $1.00.  We ordered 4 between the two of us.  They arrived pipping hot in a brown bag, and coated with powdered sugar. Anything covered in powdered sugar is a plus for me!  However, I prefer my Beignets to be lightly sprinkled on the top with sugar, rather than having them completely drowning and overpowered.  There was a tad bit too much powdered sugar complimenting my order, and at times it became hard to enjoy the dough itself.  But none-the less, I very much enjoyed these sugary sweets! And for a buck each, I will definitely be coming back on Sundays! \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/elgE2cUhKotsLoBUdghexQ?select=aJv2mCV-jzADNb4HdaAQxw\n\nI also ordered a Banana Cream Puff and Lemon Bar. The puff itself was very light and airy, as was the cream inside.   I would have liked if the banana was incorporated into the cream or as a custard instead of just being what it was...which was just sliced banana in the middle.  Lemon bar was delish, with subtle hints of lemon, and definitely not over-powering at all.   \nhttp://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=_D5iURFvYU2VSoWfkn5TnQ&userid=uMpWu7hSowxC2v25Nv9wbg\n\nA nice little touch, Devils Teeth also offer free doggie treats to their customers! And the really terrible thing about this, is that the doggie treats looked and smelled just as good as all of their other treats! I was so tempted to steal me one of them doggie treats for myself also.  =X \n\nLol...*Calm Down Cassie!, There's plenty of sweet treats to go around, no need to dig into the doggie sweets just yet!* \n\nIn the end, 4 Beignets, Banana Cream Puff, and Lemon Bar set us back about 10 bucks. Not bad, not bad at all...I will definitely be back!   Thank you dear Jonathan W. for yet another fun time rotting our already cavity-infested teeth!", "author": "Cass J."}

The food is good, the location is wonderful and employees are nice. I really like the funky vibe. Great biscuits. However, the crew always looks dazed and confused. I don't usually mind since this is a service job, but am guessing there is no consistent system in place so that people know what they're supposed to be doing and exactly how. For example, my soup is consistently cold, which I've pointed out a few times already, but it never changes. Most places know exactly how long something needs to be heated. Some employees tell you soup comes with bread, some tell you it comes with bread or biscuit, some say no biscuit and no one actually offers either unless you ask. Sometimes your sandwich comes out right away, sometimes it takes 30 minutes. I get that occasionally it's really busy, but 30 minute for a grilled cheese? Ok, that's all I've got to say.", "author": "Moonbird G."}

This is definitely one of them!\n\nI have come on two separate occasions and tried 3 different items. First I came in and the chocolate cake with peppermint frosting caught my eye. I ate the first bite and it was so moist! The peppermint frosting wasn't too sweet and the cake itself was just right in taste and texture. Not too much chocolate, just enough of everything. If I had to nitpick, I would want the peppermint pieces a little more fine instead of big chunks, but that is being super nitpicky. \n\nThe second time I came in and had to try the donut muffin and the cinnamon roll. The donut muffin is like a donut on the outside with sugar and cinnamon shaped like a muffin and with muffin-like consistency baked inside. DELICIOUS. I wish it was bigger! The cinnamon roll that everyone raves about was good, but surprisingly for me was my least favorite out of all 3!

Yes we have places I've \"heard amazing/mixed\" reviews about that have long long lines and rude service, but why I ask you, would I go there when I know what is good at Devil's teeth.\n\nLet us start with this.\nOne-Accessibility. I don't care how good you are if I can't actually get parked and inside, you don't exist. Devil's Teeth has decent street parking, at most you may have to walk a block. \n\nTwo- Service...this place has the service of a wonderful mom and pop bakery. Because mom and pop are involved. They are there and they train their people well. Counter staff are helpful, go out of their way to be helpful. \n\nThree- Charm...who doesn't love a parklet in front and a chalk assortment to color on sidewalk. I don't have a dog but I'm pretty sure I've seen water bowls as well. The tiny inside has a neighborhood indie bakery feel.\n\nFour- Food you might actually bake yourself with it's comforting goodness, but would rather find made for you already so you don't eat a whole batch of anything in one sitting...safer if you ask me.\n\nFavs- Peanut butter chocolate chip. Big luscious chips not overly sweet. Just the perfect amount of saltiness. Never hard...perfect crumb.\n\nApricot (not sure second word? oatmeal? almond?) Scone. Again the crumb is just right. I've even had one in a bag I forget til two days alter and it was still mighty good despite the age. \n\nFresh soups are amazing. Pies are delicious. Chicken Pot pie is decent. And while I haven't had one in a long time, at one time I adored their raspberry bar, not too sweet, good crumb topping and their blondies. Not even sure if they still make the blondie. \n\nNearby other great spots, Overland One hair, Noriega Produce etc.\n\nNeeds no improvement. not anywhere.", "author": "Susan F."}

You can see the bakers and their kitchen right behind the display and cashiers.  Definitely a family-style operation, with their kids watching sometimes too! Their cakes are done with a homemade casual flair. You can see that in the icing.. Cute!!\n\nOf all the items that I've tried so far, I love their $5 breakfast sandwich the absolute best.  Served on a modestly sized tender flakey muffin you will find a big mound of fluffy scrambled eggs, a slice or two of bacon and a bit of cheese.  PERFECT. YUMMY.\n\nSeating isn't plentiful on the inside, unless you add in the benches in the street outside. The benches are a nice touch on a sunny day, but you'd best come prepared for foggy overcast in this part of town!\n\nUnlike most of the reviews here, however, I am not a fan of their trademark cinnamon rolls.  Maybe my expectations were sky-high, but the rolls just seemed far too greasy and slathered in butter for me to like.  Imagine a cinnamon roll with the tender thin-layered flakiness of a croissant, lots of butter and a brown sugar crust.  Sounds great, eh?  Unfortunately, it still tasted to me as if was drowned in a vat of melted butter.  OK.. Did I say BUTTER?? sure, I know croissants are made with lots and lots of butter, but I only got 20% through their roll, and I am usually a fan of the greasy/sugary stuff!  Well, sadly, this roll ain't for me, but enough people seem to like this.  \n\nFor my fourth visit, I tried out their $5 Turkey Sausage Lasagna. I took it home to eat for dinner. Delectable.

I prefer the regular version with their own hot sauce.\n\nThe ginger cookies are good and worth trying.\n\nThe carrot cake is the best I've had in San Francisco.  I order carrot cake everywhere I can, and it's usually cold, dense, and rubbery.  It's quite different at Devil's Teeth.  The frosting isn't too sweet.  I don't recall there being nuts or raisins in their version, and that's too bad.  I also like a little more spice in my carrot cake.  It's still good though.\n\nThe cinnamon buns are popular too.\n\nAs another reviewer noted, the checkout process is a little slow.

But I went on Tuesday of this week and realized they weren't making the sandwich fresh as usual. They just added the toppings already cooked and heated it in the oven. This time around. My bacon was burnt to a crisp. Sandwich was drenched with aioli which I love aioli but when it's literally all over the outside of the biscuit. It's overwhelming. On top of that. They usually give a hefty amount of eggs. I barely got any. If this is their new way of making their sandwiches. I won't be back again it's not worth the 30 min wait.  They also got a new cashier that's really rude. I'm not sure if it's intentional but I heard a customer explain they only got 3 sandwiches and the cashier said very snarky \"yea that's why I asked you\". Not even a smile and sorry. I've been going to this place because of the nice welcoming atmosphere and great sandwiches. But if this is the new direction. I won't be going back. Not worth the half an hr wait for ..come on guys..a sandwich? If it was still made fresh. Maybe.

The biscuit was indeed very moist but yet too moist....it just mushes up when you bite into it. It was missing the flaky texture and most importantly it was bland/tasteless!  Would I order it again? No. \n\nThe beignet was just OK. It was very doughy and not fried long enough. Maybe that's the way it should be? Not sure since this is my first time having it :P But I'm willing to try it again! \n\nThey have a row of seats facing the street for customers that opts to eat  their goodies there...but I would recommend not as it's somewhat chaotic since they have an open kitchen with a very small space. The workers there seem to be scrambling around doing multiple things at once, other customers standing right next to u waiting for their food...so eating there would not be ideal.  \n\nOverall 2.5 stars.

All in all, the store didn't give me an overly-cramped vibe though it was small and would be a nice spot to down a cup of coffee along with your pastry of choice.\n\nI expected the donut muffin to taste like a donut in the shape of a muffin, but it pleasantly surprised me by being crumbly and rich on the inside like a buttermilk cinnamon muffin and crispy like a donut skin on the outside. The ginger cookie was soft, thin and of a generous size. You could really taste the bits of ginger infused in it. It was really fresh but nothing mind-blowing.\n\nThe banana cream puff was my least favorite. The outside tasted rather stale and the inside had too much whipped cream and not enough banana flavor. Mine had a chunk of chocolate in it but it would've been nicer if it was spread evenly throughout.

These bastard children of the traditional breakfast plate are the handheld versions of the classic combinations of eggs, cheese, bacon, bread and anything else you want in there. \n\nI've read up on my fair share of food science and there's an entire technology industry behind the experience of eating, and typically it's implemented and geared toward what and how children eat. Take the Lunchable for instance. (Reported recently in New York Times Magazine.) When figuring out how to move into that moment when the Mom is too rushed in the morning to build a brown bag lunch, Kraft looked at what brings joy to a child's eating experience somuchso they'd then request the Lunchable over the brown bag, which is a win-win for everyone. That joy they had derived from the snap of the crackers on the top & bottom of their mini sandwich, and it was determined the two part handheld & crunch, along with the sound of eating the cracker with the hearty parts of it, created a complete experience that some think is behaviorally addictive. \n\nSo guess who ate Lunchables four days a week in grade school? The behavior and allure of sandwiches isn't going away. I look at a plate of eggs, bacon, toast, and maybe a tomato or avocado and I think it's dull, and the fork is a weapon of mass consumption -- and I also fear that dreadful possibility of the fork catching a gum or tooth. Thus, the breakfast sandwich is right where I want to be. The breakfast sandwich at Devil's Teeth is right within my want, and around the corner. In-house buttermilk biscuits split open with scrambled eggs, thick cut bacon, pepper jack cheese, some sort of sauce, tomato and avocado evokes the very early days of nourishment for me. Even the grease from the biscuits is appreciated. \n\nFrom construction workers, to children, to cops, to walking couples sharing it, to me, this damn thing goes way back and is a staple of the Outer Sunset. And we haven't even talked about the Donut Muffin.", "author": "Jon A."}

Looks like I was not the only one inquire about the Beignets because others were asking the same time I was asking (about 4 other people). Sunday = Beignets. Since it was Saturday and there were no Beignets being served, it would be rude to walk out without trying their delicious looking pastries.\n\nHEFFER-STYLE STATUS.\n\nApricot Oats Scone ($3.25) - of all the fresh pastries, I went with this one. Wasn't too thrilled with the price of the scone and was shooting for a buck cheaper - thinking i could get a few organic vegan scones for about that price. I've had all kinds of scones but never an apricot oats scone. Very picky with my scones and they have to be very fresh and crumble in the mouth on each bite. SCORE! Loved the scone. I'd be willing to fork over $3.25 for another one of theses anytime!!!!\n\nGlad to have found a great pastry spot near Ocean Beach to get a little something something sweet.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2014-09-13", "description": "As the kids say these days, \"Yum!\"  I finally got a chance to try this place with the cool name that I've been driving past for quite some time now.  Honestly, I thought it was just a bakery, not a place with \"real\" food, so I hadn't made an effort until my dining buddy gave me the full scoop.\n\nOur attempt to get a quick breakfast sandwich was foiled by the 15-minute wait that we were greeted with on a late Friday morning, but it was well worth it.  I ordered the basic breakfast sandwich, which comes on a light, albeit flatter than normal, biscuit and includes very crispy bacon, the crispiness of which is unparalleled in other breakfast sandwiches.  Seriously.  It was completely crunchy, not crunchewy like most bacon, without being overcooked the way it turns out for me when I attempt the same feat at home.  The biscuit also held together through the entire consumption of the sandwich.  Often biscuits just start crumbling as you eat and make a mess, so kudos for getting it right.  Highly recommended!\n\nI also got a couple of pastries to go:  a hefty slice of zucchini bread (visually beautiful, but a little less flavorful than I expected), and a substantial slice of chocolate cake (also visually beautiful and very tasty, though it doesn't taste any more special than generic chocolate cake with canned icing on top.)  This isn't meant as a criticism; it's just that when I buy something \"ordinary\" from a specialty shop, I expect it to taste different than what I could find elsewhere or what I could make at home (hence four stars instead of five).  While I wouldn't order these two pastries again, I'm eager to try some of the other items in the case.\n\nTheir coffee is also really good (not sure what brand it is).  I would have preferred there to be more than just one size (a medium, by most standards), but the wait for the food gave me time to finish one and order another, which was $.50 cheaper since I now had my own cup.  The price and quantity of two coffees roughly equaled  a single larger size at other shops.\n\nThe convenient parklet out front went through a couple of cycles of packed/half full/packed while we were waiting, but not wanting to eat off of our laps, we instead drove a few more blocks to the beach and ate standing at the sea wall with a perfect view of the ocean and a large number of surfers.\n\nI'll definitely be back to try more yumminess from Devil's Teeth!", "author": "Tim D."}

Yep, after going to Weight Watchers I headed right to the bakery.  Sort of the \"Do and Undo\" weight loss plan, but I digress..\n\nI'd heard all about the killer cinnamon rolls, raspberry bars, and brownies.  I decided to try the breakfast sandwich.  A buttery, flaky biscuit overflowing with melted cheddar, fluffy scrambled eggs, and perfectly crisp bacon.  YUM!  It was the perfect morning sammie for me!  Oh yeah, did I mention it's 5 bucks??  BARGAIN!  I also ordered the \"donut muffin\".  That little nugget was heaven in a bag...it's a buttermilk donut covered with cinnamon sugar and baked in the oven (I think).  \n\nI'm glad I don't live in the Sunset...this place is a bad habit in the making!

But alas, I am here and am ready to order. \n\nNormal choices of drinks to choose from and I go for my usual glass of milk. I got greedy and ordered a breakfast sandwich and a special breakfast sandwich. For a moment, I felt embarrassed ordering two sandwiches to eat. But I justify it by me working out the carbs during Kickboxing later and for my awesome opinion to form so I can put it on Yelp. \n\nLet me start with the location- \n\nNice little bakery with wooden bars and stools. I appreciated the Green Apple books for sale for $5 at the store. The glass case is filled with pastries and cakes and bars. What I was dying to try but resisted was the cinnamon sticky bun and the lemon bar. But my goal was for the sandwich, so maybe ill do a review of those next time. \n\nDrinks range from coffee drinks and in the fridge I saw some fresh squeezed orange juice, a berry/mango juice, coconut water, carrot juice, and some other drinks that didnt catch my attention. I was tempted to grab the orange juice, but I went for the milk instead. \n\nThey also sell T shirts, and sweaters representing the bakery. \n\nNow onto the Main Attraction....\n\nBreakfast sandwich- melt in your mouth, buttery, cheesy goodness. The biscuit was so flaky and delicious. It reminded me a toasted croissant, but much denser and delicious. the eggs were perfectly made- basically a heaping cooking spoon of eggs that was cooked I assume in low heat with melted butter. The biscuit, cheese were cooked in the oven and bacon was pre-made on the side. It would have been nice to have crispier bacon for added texture, but hey, it is still delicious. Solid Solid Sandwich. \n\nSpecial Breakfast Sandwich- Its what the breakfast sandwich is made of plus avocado and this ranch type sauce with a bite and pepperjack cheese. This sandwich had rich flavor with the sauce and the pepperjack cheese. It compliments the biscuit and gosh, I feel like I cant go back to any other breakfast sandwich out there. \n\nIll be honest, I ate those sandwiches driving home. I didnt gorge myself though, I ate half special breakfast sandwich and part of the regular one. It was truly delicious and Im glad I found this place. \n\nI assume the lady who I briefly talked to was the owner. She seemed very welcoming and like any true San Franciscan, seems to know everyone and anything about SF. She seems to have very good relationships with her customers and I assume that the \"regulars\" that frequent her bakery become more than customers. They become friends. \n\nAnyway, I feel bad for not introducing myself, but eventually I will go back, tackle the sweet portion of the bakery and maybe have a nice conversation with the owner. Good Job for having an awesome bakery in the neighborhood and I wish the cook a good job and good luck at the Fire Academy.", "author": "A L."}

I have heard great things about their $1 beignets (every Sunday) and so my boyfriend and I made the trip over to outer Sunset.  We came probably around 10:30 a.m. and the place was packed- the line was literally out-the-door.  (The place itself isn't huge, so out-the-door means at least 10 people in line). The line did move pretty quickly, so we ordered a few beignets and a coffee.  \n\nThey serve bicycle coffee, and a regular coffee was about $2.  It was good- not amazing, but pretty good.  The coffee was a good balance to the decadent beignet.  The beignets are freshly made and so they come out hot!  They're served covered in powdered sugar, and in a brown paper baggie.  It can get messy, so beware.  I ate it in their nice outdoor seating area, in front of the shop and so the extra powdered sugar just flew away onto the street. \n\nIt seemed like there was a delay in the beignets because it took about 15 minutes for them.  I was getting a little bit impatient towards the end of the waiting, but it was very much worth it.  I'd order them again.

It's darker than your typical cinnamon bun and I was a bit worried it was overcooked.  Nope, not in the least.  The caramel is just dark, providing a rich, deep flavor to the light yeasty dough.  I didn't find it overly sweet at all, which is a plus.  Since I wasn't eating it right away, they recommended I heat it up int he microwave for 30 to 40 seconds and I wouldn't regret it. Heed that man's words if you get the bun to go!  \n\nThey carry an assortment of savory and sweet pies, cheesecakes, cookies, brownies and bars, muffins and beignets along with a breakfast sandwich.

And the devil sure as hell knows how to make a crazy ass muffin. \n\nOn a side note, don't eat one an hour and a half before a cycling class. The muffin likes to \"linger\" to remind you that no matter how hard you peddle, it says \"You still ate me, I'm not gone yet!!

You were the only place I insisted on eating at during my short visit to SF.  I've literally dreamt about your BLT on a biscuit since we last met.  And I sit here, almost a week later longing to taste you again.  I'm okay with us having this long-distance romance because I know you're bad for me, but I can't resist.  \n\nYou once again deny me a taste of your beer/cheese muffins, I guess it's just not meant to be.  But you do accommodate me with that big crispy buttery biscuit substituted in the BLT that keeps me wanting more.  I generally hate lasagna as they are usually such a mushy mess, but your turkey lasagna is beautiful with distinct layers of flavor.  I'm a texture person and your goods thrill me with the right stuff. \n\n I remembered how last time I did not get much because everyone inhaled all your goodies before I could have more than a sample.  This time I did a shameful thing.  I turned my back from my husband, shielding away my little cardboard treasure box that cradled the richness of your chewy caramel sticky roll, I ate quickly but my small sighs and mmmmms did not go unnoticed.  He asked me \"whatcha got there?\" with curiosity and suspicion.  panic creeping in as I replied in a voice too high \"nothing!  I got nothin!\" and I further tried to shield the roll from his view.  It was too late.  He saw the sticky bun and snatched it from my hands, I tried to explain this was the only way I felt that I could have some before it was all gone, but I could tell he felt betrayal.  This is what you've done to me Devil's Teeth!  I don't even know who I am anymore!  I bought a donut muffin for the husband (I don't care for donuts, even when they masquerade as other pastries or baked goods) but he had to have both. hmmmpfh!\n\nI also enjoyed your big molasses-ey ginger cookie, but I would actually warn it is kind of too big.  It took me 3 days of nibbling to finish it.  It was delicious to the last day, stayed chewy and the little pockets of ginger chunks were a welcome surprise.", "author": "Sj C."}

It's perfect.\n\nThe traditional bakery (a neighborhood place that makes bread, pastries, sweet things, and special-occasion cakes, on a daily basis) is harder and harder to find, at least in my home city.

Grabbed a beignet (one of the cheaper menu items) and my friend snarfed one of their enormous breakfast sandwiches. Both of us liked their coffee. Friend ended up sharing the breakfast sandwich with her girlfriend since it was large enough to be a two-person item.\n\nA bit of a line snaked out the door, but it moved quickly, and more importantly, the counter staff were fast and friendly with handling each of us in line. Given it was a sunny day with little wind, we made use of their sidewalk seating and played with everyone else's puppies. Would easily recommend a visit to here. I'd like to go back one more time to be able to give it 5-stars. Street meter parking was decently available.", "author": "Paul F."}

The free samples up by the register are a great idea, and as far as I could tell, they put out their best products - good for them! I love the logo, so I was surprised to find myself a bit disappointed by the bakery's aesthetic. The open kitchen was interesting, but the industrial-sized cans of spices and tomato sauce are not so appealing. A stereo was tuned to a bad, bad oldies station instead of the typical hipstery Pandora station I would have expected. I was pleased with the variety of offerings, but they did seem variable, to my taste at least.\n\n***** Donut muffin - perfect. The muffins are on the small side - more like what I make at home, rather than those coffeeshop monstrosities. For the donut muffin, this provides the perfect surface:interior ratio to provide enough sugar&cinnamon on the outside to flavor the luscious donutty inside. This brought back memories of cinnamon-sugar cake donuts at childhood apple pickings. Spot on.\n\n**** Breakfast sandwich - superior biscuit with made-to-order eggs - great. I would have preferred the cheddar cheese to be shredded, which would allow it to melt rather than sit lump-like on the eggs. The bacon was undercooked for me.\n\n***Lemon bar - this was unlike any other lemon bar I've had, and not really in a good way. It was almost entirely crust with a very thing layer of lemon on the top, dusted with powdered sugar. I would have preferred it to be more lemony, both in volume and flavor.\n\nChocolate cake - this came in slab form, with a thin layer of chocolate cake topped by a thick layer of chocolate frosting. The frosting was very chocolatey and rich, while the cake was fairly forgettable. I would have preferred if this cake were a little fancier and layered.\n\n** Cinnamon roll - tough dough without much going on. I'd have preferred it to be fluffier and richer. We actually tasted this and promptly abandoned it, which is pretty unusual.\n\nIf I were in the neighborhood I'd stop by, but I won't go out of my way for it again.", "author": "Lisa K."}

I tried their breakfast sandwich and a cinnamon roll.  The breakfast sandwich is as good as everyone says it is.  And I'm not a fan of biscuits much.  They usually tend to be heavy, salty, dense and not very tasty.  But this bfast biscuit is awesome.  Light and flaky and tasty.  It comes with eggs, bacon (thick and very little fat), and cheddar cheese.  Yummm....for $5.00.  I will go back for sure and become a regular from now on. \n\nTheir cinnamon roll ($4.00) was not very good.  Too dense and heavy, though the cinnamon is quite good.  It is thinly rolled dough wrapped into a large square (over 4 inches across).  The icing is bland and doesn't add much to the overall product.  I will be sure to try some of their other pastries in the future.  Even though I really went for the cinnamon roll, and it was disappointing, the breakfast sandwich more than made up for it.\n\nThe service was fantastically speedy and polite for being so early in the morning.

But that won't stop me from recognizing that Devil's Teeth, too, deserves five stars.\n\nAfter doing the 1.5 mile swim from Alcatraz and a 7 mile run over the Golden Gate Bridge and back, my sister drove me out here on the way back to her house. Still with my running shorts and race bib on, we parked on the street and got in line. It was an Outer Sunset type of line, too, squeaky clean people in fleece and young beach bums with smiles, everyone standing about a foot apart, no one in a hurry but the line naturally moving fast on its own. With nowhere to sit and dine in, there was no din of conversation, no clacking of computer keys, no extra crowding from people hovering around looking for butt parking. This In word, perfect. \n\nThere were trays and displays of endless pastries and breads that the city is known for churning out, like the fantasy factory in the clouds that it is. Soup steam and eau d' quiche also wove through the air, but powdered sugar, floury contours, and tantalizing aromas didn't distract my focus. All I wanted was a scrambled egg, bacon, and cheddar breakfast sandwich in a biscuit. \n\nIn the middle of a line, a man started chatting to us, with a young boy and girl tucked in under his arms, and his smiling wife steps away. He asked me what event I'd just finished. He congratulated me, saying he was training for this or that run or swim or bike or all three...I told him my sis was going to run the marathon the very next weekend for the fifth time, and the whole family went into ululations of admiration. \n\nAfter that healthful socialization, we were up to bat. Soon, I had two heavy biscuit sandwiches in foil in my grubby fists, and we raced home. Risking the cooling of the sandwich, I raced to shower the salt crystals of the bay water and my own sweat off my body before devouring the gigantic biscuit sandwich.\n\nI was clean, relaxed, and satiated, savoring every last savory composite crumb of four perfectly balanced elements (fatty meat, dairy, more dairy, and carbs). The total effect also had a hint of sweetness, whether imagined or residual from the bakery's sugar dusted atmosphere or from interaction of the ingredients with the Pacific see breeze blowing and into every corner of the house. \n\nPerhaps the elation of finishing a race, seeing my sister, and being in an awesome area heavily biases me towards my praise for Devil's Teeth. Then again, that the business enhanced my already perfect day, is a big deal when most transactions at heavily demanded businesses often bring you crashing down to Earth. \n\nIf someone asked me to choose between Devil's Teeth and Java Beach (separate review), I would give the same reply I do when someone asks me to choose between McDonald's and Burger King: Mickey D's for breakfast, and Burger King for lunch.  \n\nNext time, I'll sample some sweets and coffee drinks, which I know will be great based on smell alone.", "author": "Jia J."}

Awesome! They were delicious!!!!!!!! Aside from that I ordered a Brownie and a Blondie. The brownie was made perfectly! Decadent semi-sweet chocolate that was soo heavenly to bite into! And the powered sugar generously sprinkled on top made it even more enjoyable! Yummm... The Blondie was sweet, soft and crunchy all at the same time. Inside were crunchy walnuts and white chocolate chunks. I felt the white chocolate chunks really complimented all the elements in the Blondie. For both treats came out to $6, worth it! And 4 cinnamon buns for free, deal! Very yummy! Apart from the awesomeness of being offered the free cinnamon buns, the staff were welcoming and very helpful. \n\nDefinitely going back!", "author": "Fran M."}

First of all, their portion sizes are Claim Jumper-sized, which is awesome. Another key to their success is their variety of savory and sweet options.\n\nThings I've had so far include their blondie, breakfast sandwich, and cinnamon roll. Also, several samples of their chocolate chip cookies. Their blondies are great--they make them the old-fashioned way, with pecans and white chocolate chips. But I think the cinnamon roll really takes the...cake? (I know you all hate me.)\n\nTheir breakfast sandwich is pretty much an egg bonanza. Truth be told, the buttery biscuit slices have a tough time holding the thing together. But don't let that get in the way of how good it tastes--just use a fork and knife. Veggie tip: You can get sliced tomatoes on it as a substitute for bacon if you wish. \n\nThis cinnamon roll is different from any other one I've ever had. You'll have to accept the fact that there is no icing or any form of frosting on it. After regaining your equilibrium, take a closer look. You'll realize that it doesn't need any frosting because the entire thing is caramelized--giving each bite a sweet, crispy start before diving into the buttery dough. And believe me, what they lack in matters of frosting, they make up for in butter. Oh, and make sure you get it heated up. You would be a fool to think otherwise.\n\nWord to the wise: use caution if you're enjoying your treats while sitting outside in the parklet. Those pigeons mean business, and will get right up in your face.", "author": "Rachel F."}

Oh, did I mention they're available during ALL hours, none of this \"Available until 10:30 a.m.\" crap? *swoon*\n\nDesserts: \n-Cinnamon roll: this thing is massive, incredibly sticky and delightful. \n-Raspberry bar: you will smell the butter from the topping as soon as you go 1 ft. near it, and the raspberry filling is chunky, sweet and tangy. And it's so rich and huge it took me half a day to finish. Unless you're fat. I wish I was fat, so I could finish it in one sitting.\n-Scones: flaky and flavorful.\n-Cheddar bacon biscuit: very peppery and flavorful, but on the dry side.

Delightfully dense, with a semi-sweet cream cheese frosting that neither overpowered the subtle carrot flavor nor cast me into a sugar coma.\n\nBiengets (sample): 5 Stars. Airy, flavorful, and covered in powdered sugar, these were some of the best I've ever had.\n\nBreakfast Sandwich: 3.5 Stars. Nestled between a gloriously dense, buttery and flaky biscuit lay scrambled eggs, a slice of sharp cheddar cheese and  two slices of thick bacon. While I could have used the temperature of all the ingredients to be warmer (the cheese was barely melted) the thick bacon helped to carry the day, providing necessary salt and outstanding crispness.  Nothing to complain about here.\n\nSightglass Coffee (French Press): 4 Stars. An upgrade from Blue Bottle to be certain, well nuanced and subtle, with a faint flavor of chocolate and citrus notes. It probably could have used a bit more time brewing, however this minor flaw did not detract from the overall experience.\n\nLocation is pleasant, close enough to the beach to be walkable, yet with plenty of seating in case you're not into dealing with the potential for sand as a condiment. \n\nService was quick, and efficient, especially considering the number of customers present. \n\nI look forward to returning and sampling more of their menu.", "author": "Casey U."}

I end up here at least once a week, usually for a quick breakfast or fresh lunch I can take down to the beach.\n\nPastries: All of them are fantastic, and they rotate things out frequently enough to always have something new.\n\n-Raspberry bar: perfectly sweet and chewy, and really filling. You get a huge bar and its really dense, good for a few servings.\n-Donut Muffin: Delicious and self explanatory.\n-Lemon Bar: One of my favorites - not too sweet, perfectly tangy, great crumbly crust.\n-Shark cookie: a well made cookie and something I can rarely resist.\n-Cinnamon roll: HUGE, perfectly moist, very very tasty.\n-Carrot cake: another favorite - moist, great spice, fantastic cream cheese frosting that balances the sweetness of the cake\n-Scones: all are great, especially with a cup of their strong and flavorful coffee.\n-Ginger Cookie: Super chewy and wonderfully full of ginger.\n-Pies: again, all are amazing. You dont get the biggest slice, but that just makes you savor each bite more.\n\nThe coffee is strong, dark, and delicious. Their juices are refreshing, fresh, and not too sweet. I like the purple one, whatever flavor that is :P Great for hangovers :X\n\nThe breakfast sandwich is usually my reason for ending up here: fresh baked buttery biscuit, eggs, cheese, and thick bacon. $5 only, and you will be stuffed. Made to order every time.\n\nThe BLT is also one of my favorites - mixed greens, thick bacon, a thick slice of tomato, and some mayo/aoili that brings it all together on fresh chewy bread.\n\nMade to order beignets for $1 each on sundays. Simple and classic and surprisingly large.\n\nAnd of course, one can't forget their famous Beer Bacon Cheddar Chive whatever else Muffin. We usually stock up on these just to have them around the house. Ask for it to be heated up a little, its awesome.\n\nOn top of it all, the staff is always super friendly and attentive, the prices are more than reasonable, and theres an awesome little patio area out front where all the locals and their kids and dogs and the neighborhood pigeons all sit and hang out and chat and have breakfast on sunny Sunset mornings.

NIRVANA.\n\nWhen I die I hope I can enjoy pastries and desert treats this great. No bullshit, this place is LEGIT, BELIEVE any and all hype! But why?\n\nWell for one, the prices are SUPER CHEAP for the quality and size of portion. Let me give you a good example. If you have eaten their treats here I'm sure you have sampled some at Tartine Bakery (another amazing place for pastries, and deserts)...Devil's Teeth Baking Co. is just as good if not a tiny bit better but WAY CHEAPER. For example...at Devil's Teeth Baking Co, you pay $3.00 for their Cinnamon Roll but if you were to buy a comparable pastry at Tartine... guarantee it would be $8 or $9. \n\nCinnamon Roll: ABSOLUTELY THE BEST! So good that every time you take another bite, you can't help but \"omg so good\". That is how you know it's SUPER LEGIT!\n\nCheesecake: VERY VERY GOOD and HUGE. Has a delicious lemon cream icing and the texture of the cheesecake is smooth. The crust is great as well, not overly sweet, but sweet enough to give it that yummy taste!\n\nBreakfast Sandwich: EPIC! I never would have thought egg's could be so fluffy. Very big sandwich to fill you up the right way for the rest of your day.\n\nI would like to end this review with...did I mention how CHEAP these AMAZING OUT OF THIS WORLD deserts are?

(I don't mind sharing with the dirty sea birds)  The coffee was great, but I was more interested in getting to the beignets. I  have been a lover of beignets since my first trip to New Orleans when I was a kid. I am always on the lookout for a good beignets, and sadly I am frequently disappointed. Not this time.

Devil's Teeth does the BLT justice.  Delicious bread lightly toasted, appropriate amount of mayo and mustard (which they asked if I wanted for first) and great fresh greens and tomato.  Basically couldn't ask for more.  It was 5 bucks, which is a total steal. \n\nAlso, as I started to write this, I just remembered I still have a chocolate chip cookie that I ordered this morning.

Beignet Sundays!\n\nI come here practically almost every Sunday I can to get a fix of their light, puffy, FRESH, powdery beignets in a brown bag. I love sinking my teeth into the fresh, soft dough as powder sugar collects all over my lips including my nose. Just don't breathe in... the sugar will choke you!\n\nTheir bacon quiche is delish. I've tried their spinach quiche, but can live without it. The boyfriend enjoys the breakfast sandwich because they overdose it with scrambled eggs, just as the way boys like it.\n\nEveryone knows how much I normally hate lemon flavored pastries and cakes, but I am in love with the lemon squares. There were tiny pieces as samples to try. I had one crumb and decided to buy an entire square. Chocolate chip cookies are big... healthy tasting. \n\n\"Small\" lasagna was HUGE and very filling. I'd still choose the quiche over the lasagna.\n\nEverything is reasonable priced for breakfast. I think I've tried everything on the menu throughout the weeks except for their coffee.

Beignet Sunday - made fresh to order - fried dough dropped into a powered sugar-filled brown paper bag with my name written on it... Lovely. Not too greasy, not too heavy, perfectly coated. Yum. \n\nWhile I was waiting, I threw in a cup of coffee & bought a lemon bar (a recent craving) and a ginger cookie (which I'm a sucker for) with the thought that I'd share them with Dad who is dropping by later.  I will say that I prefer stronger flavors - BOLD coffee, DARK chocolate, Darker beers - follow? This being said here we go - \n\nI LOVE citrus, and like my lemon goods more on the tart side than most.   I'd agree with another reviewer's take on it - not too sweet, not too tart. It was a nice lemon bar - generous size, gorgeous shortbread base, nice crunch. For my palate, I'd like a bit more ZIP and POP of LEMON - so this was lacking for me, but nice nevertheless. This one was easier to walk away from than the next item... \n\nThe ginger cookie snuck up on me.  Bakesale Betty has the most GORGEOUS ginger cookie. It is my gold standard. And THIS ginger cookie gives Betty a run for her money. \nThe full flavor experience didn't hit my palate for a few moments. It's sneaky like that. I'd like more bits of ginger, but it was chewy & delectable. And I'm being a VERY good daughter leaving half for Dad.\n\nIt was a good first visit, I'll go back to sample other treats  (and another ginger cookie). \n\nLimited seating inside a very small shop.

Also tried several dessert and breakfast pastries. The donut muffin was not my cup of tea. Basically, it's a dense cinnamon sugary muffin. I guess I was hoping it'd be more donut-like than muffin-like. The lemon bars had just the right proportion of crust and filling and tartness. Cinnamon roll was so sweet and rich that it should be made candy size, or just make sure to share! But the caramelized brown sugar and butter flavor is amazing. The brownie is pretty standard, more on the dense cakey side than fudgey side, if that makes sense. Lastly, the cheese cake has become one of my favorites!

Alas, I needed to show some self-restraint in front of my breakfast companion, so I just had the cinnamon roll. \n\nBut what a cinnamon roll it was! I had it warmed up like everyone here has suggested. I loved the top of the roll--kind of gooey but with crispy caramelized-like bits at the same time. Soooo good!!! And it wasn't cloyingly sweet, either. I thought it was perfect. I wish I had bought another cinnamon roll to take home with me for later. Mmmm....!!! \n\nI did buy a ginger cookie to take home to my husband and a piece of chocolate cake for me. The cake was a huge square and a bargain at $3! I thought that overall the flavor was good, but the cake part could have been a little more moist. I took a bite of hubby's ginger cookie before giving it to him, and it was excellent.

But my son was really craving a special breakfast sandwich and so I went and waited 15 min in line and 45+ min. for food. I was so impressed by the cheerful attitude the lady at the counter had, consistently with each customer. Our food was delicious and fresh, meeting my expectations. We talked to her and she was so gracious. She is a gem. They were making a masterful effort to keep up with a line that never diminished, not for hours. My hat is off to Devil's Teeth for their calm under fire and great attitudes. Oh and food was excellent.", "author": "Lisa B."}

It's a huge pastry and even he couldn't finish it.  It had great flavor and a dense sugary coating.  Inside it was a tad dry... would probably have been better warmed up.\n\nInterior is very clean.

After polishing off the massive breakfast sandwich, I ordered some beignets to enjoy, which were cooked perfectly, and perfectly coated with plenty of powder sugar.\n\nWhile there was plenty of other delicious breakfast items to choose from, as well as Blue Bottle drip coffee, I will have to save that for my next trip to this devilishly good breakfast spot.", "author": "David M."}

Because our baby decided he didn't want to sleep in beyond 5 on a nice lazy Saturday morning, we thought we'd take advantage (or make lemonade out of lemons so to speak) and get breakfast at Devil's Teeth that we have been wanting to try.  \n\nThe place, as we had hoped, was pretty empty.  I got a cinnamon roll, my husband breakfast sandwich.  He munched on it, as I and my son watched the two girls working the kitchen, prepping baked goods, sweeping,etc.  At some point, my lazy sleepy self started to wonder how long it takes to warm up a cinnamon roll.  Eventually my husband finished his sandwich and we went up to the cashier register asking to pay, and asking about my cinnamon roll.  The girl gave us a quizzical \"what cinnamon roll\" and then quickly realized that it's been sitting in the microwave the whole time.\n\nShe apologized and I got my roll, which was especially delicious after waiting for so long.  It was really really rich and decadent though.  I felt like I was pouring butter and sugar straight into my mouth.

I liked the quiche overall except the crust was a bit too salty for me. The potatoes were delicious.\n\n-Spiced cider: hot with well-rounded spices.

We had breakfast sandwiches...handmade, tasty and filling. Also bought an assortment of treats, which were all great: blondies, scones, muffins, gingersnaps (with real pieces of ginger!). Good Blue Bottle coffee made fresh by the cup. They also sell quiche, pie, cake, bread, drinks, and soup. It's a real boon to have this bakery in the neighborhood.", "author": "Colleen B."}

The breakfast sandwich served between two buttery biscuits is drool-worthy. Get the special with avocado and you wont regret it.

I went with the intention of only buying an apricot scone, but...I ended up halving a scrumptulicious breakfast sandwich.

We only got Beignets, but everything else looked quite homey - They won me over with love for their display and atmosphere. I liked how I could see how everything was being made, how everything functioned like Santa's workshop - it's a cooking channel's dream! \n\nUnfortunately, the beignets were a disappointment. It was very doughy - like doughnuts than the light airiness of true beignets that I've gotten in Disneyland or the kind my cousin got in New Orleans. They'd be good as a new kind of dessert - not a beignet though. \n\nThe service is really great. I saw another customer return their banana pie because the cream hadn't set, so the owner gave them a new piece and offered to exchange for anything else. He also greeted each customer new or old and thanked them.\n\nDevil's Teeth is hip (iPad cashier for the win!) and child-friendly, I have high hopes for their other goodies. They're quite cheap and the portions are large. I like the atmosphere and I'm willing to come by again for another try.", "author": "Christal Y."}

The worst thing I have to say about this place is I had the unfortunate rare miss on my breaky sandwich one day; limp sad tiny bacon, burnt eggs, unmelted cheese, and dry biscuit.  But that was maybe one out of dare I say twenty or so breakfast sandwiches I have experienced. Don't judge me people, yes I share with my friends too so it's not just all me eating breaky sammies all day every day!! \n\nAside from this one miss I feel like I really lucked out and had an amazing experience that made up for that one sad sandwich. Here it goes....One day, I asked if they had cinnamon buns because I didn't see any in the happy pastry window. The friendly counter dude was like Oh they are baking right now and should be done in TWO minutes. Exciting. Basically. I was so lucky I got my fresh scalding hot amazing sugary happy goodness cinnamon bun and the bf and I got DOWN (ahem, on the cinnamon bun). It was probably one of the best things that has ever happened to me : )  really. It was that awesome.\n\nAnd.... one time i ventured off of my sweet tooth and tried the potato leek bacon quiche. It was also absolutely killer! I think I should venture out and try more of their savory dishes in the future.\n\nTo sum all of this up. I love this place. It makes me feel warm and happy. I still religiously go for the brownie which fits to my brownie heaven taste buds to the tee. I also never stray far from the donut muffin. I have heard other people rag on this little guy but for some reason that damned muffin of donut REALLY gets me! Maybe I should add that I'm not a fan of raised donuts. I like them cake donuts. So this is probably why I am possibly fanatical about the donut muffin. All and all. Thank you Devil's Teeth for being there and doing a fabulous job.

I want to wake up early on Sundays, wait in line in the dreary cold fog, thankfully receive my precious parcel, and scarf them down whilst wishing I'd ordered more. I imagine myself taking visiting friends and family here, sharing a secret (ok, not that secret) SF spot. I imagine sitting on the curb while the dog keeps trying to steal the goods, powdered sugar going everywhere, and grumpily going back to wait in line (we came all this way, I'm eating some beignets dammit).\n\nProblem is, you are ruining the beignets. \n\nI think maybe it's because you are trying to serve them too quickly? Whatever the reason, please make the following two changes:\n\n1. Dry and cool the beignets for a little while after frying. They should be warm - not insanely, holy shit, how do I hold this thing? - hot. Also, they need to be dry before you apply the sugar. Otherwise, it absorbs the oil and turns to a sort of sticky glaze which is totally not the thing at all.\n\n2. Why are you serving them in paper bags? The presentation is a major part of the fun. I should feel like scarface being served a huge pile of coke with a dainty side of doughtnut. Serving them in a bag, I feel more like a cheap smack addict instead. And the bag has the side-effect of steaming the doughtnuts, contributing negatively to their fluffiness, and adding to the glaze problem described above. You should serve them in small bowls. If people want to ruin them in paper bags, they should have to do that themselves.\n\nTo be clear, I'm not going to stop visiting. I mean, what you have here is basically dough, oil, and powdered sugar. Kinda hard to go wrong.\n\nBut I always feel a little disappointed. And it would be so easy to do right.", "author": "Aaron B."}

This two star review is for one item only, the apple pie we got for Thanksgiving. \nThe ordering and pick up process was pretty good. There were no mistakes for us and it was ready when they said it would be. The price was $20 for the whole pie, which I think is reasonable. \nThe crust on the pie was fantastic. Truly. I wish I could make pie crust like that. So far this sounds like a five star review, right? \nBut then when we cut into the pie it all went down hill. The filling was made from a green skinned apple and they left the skins on. Gross! It looked like baba ganoush or some smushy vegetable filling. The appearance was very unappetizing. And the skins also gave the filling a bitter, astringent flavor that just tasted flat out bad. The texture was off as well because the apple flesh was tender and the skins were tough and chewey. Nobody really liked it and we threw most of it away. Bummer. So please, for next time, would you peel the apples?\nThanks,\nF.B.", "author": "F B."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2011-08-22", "description": "FINALLY, those of us who live in the Western half of San Francisco don't have to drive 30 minutes to the other side of town in order to wrap our hands around some awesome pastries! (Tartine, anyone?) The gods of sweet confectionaries have finally shined some sun down onto our foggy existence!!\n\nWhen we went to Devil's Teeth for the first time last weekend, everything looked so good we just HAD to try as many things as possible. Here's the breakdown of what we tried (in order of our favs):\n\n1) Currant Scone: One of the best scones we've EVER had (if not the best)! Rich, soft, buttery perfection. I dare say better than Arizmendi's, plus you don't have to spend 10 minutes looking for parking. They also had apricot scones for those who aren't into currant.\n\n2) Banana Blueberry Muffin: For the past 8 years, I've prided myself in baking the best banana bread around. I'm afraid I've been dethroned. This muffin is moist, dense and packed with sweet, fresh blueberries. My husband just asked me if I can start adding blueberries to my banana bread as well. Darn them. \n\n3) Cinnamon Roll: THANK YOU for not ruining this with a bunch of sickly sweet frosting! (The reason you'll never find me anywhere near a \"Cinnabon\"). Just the right amount of cinnamon & buttery sweetness, with a nice caramelized crust. Needs to be warmed up first though, or else the crust is too hard. And did I mention it's large enough to feed 4 people?\n\n4) Donut muffin: Has more of a cake-like texture than a donut, which is perfectly fine with me. Super moist, cinnamony deliciousness. Ever-so-slightly too sweet though, which places it 4th on my list. You also have to like cinnamon, as it's even more cinammon-y than the cinnamon roll. \n\n5) Oatmeal Raisin cookie: Also slightly too sweet for my taste but nevertheless one of the best oatmeal raisin cookies I've ever had. Has a nice roasted, fresh-out-of-the-oven after-taste too. \n\nOne theme you'll notice... EVERYTHING is super-moist, even the next day. (I couldn't tell you beyond that because it would never survive that long in our house). The supernatural moistness of all their pastries makes me suspect they add loads of butter, but then if you're trying to be healthy, why bother going to a bakery?\n\nOh and they only serve beignets on Sundays and unfortunately, they ran out when we got there & we would have had to wait 15 minutes to get them. Will have to go back again next Sunday to try them. =) \n\nWe ended up paying $24 for 9 items. So... to top it all off, it's very reasonably priced. What more could you ask for?? (Probably more seating, if I was to name one thing. But hey this is S.F. we're talking about).\n\nAlright all this writing has made me hungry. I think I'm gonna have to head back and buy some more scones now. LOVE IT!", "author": "Rachel M."}

There's usually a daily rotation of hot soups.  I can personally recommend the coconut daal, and the sweet potato and apple soup.\n\nMy daughters crave the doughnut muffins, banana muffins, chocolate chip cookies, and brownies; and these items are almost always in the case. There's a rotating selection of pies, and other delicacies. I've had the banana cream pie, strawberry rhubarb pie, and just today, I tried the green tea layer cake with whipped cream frosting.  I recommend each and every one.\n\nLove the counter which was made by the Woodshop, just a block away.

There's single cup Blue bottle coffee to the left, and a little nebulous line over to the right. We tasted the oatmeal cookies, and lemon bars which were delicious. We ordered a breakfast sandwich and a cinnamon roll to go. \n\nThe sandwich is a large biscuit piled high with fluffy scrambled eggs, crisp bacon, and a slice of cheese. It's big, and was delicious. \n\nThe cinnamon roll is also large and tasty. Jason(?) at the register told us to heat the cinnamon roll before eating it. I had to try it in the car though, and the dough was nice and toothy and the coating is sweet but not overwhelmingly so.\n\nI'll definitely go back and try more of their baked goods.

Nice to be able to get a variety of tasty baked goods and a cup of Blue Bottle. I really came to check out the beignets, since a few people mentioned this place to me, given my roots in New Orleans. First of all, beignets are only on Sunday. What the **? They are available almost 24/7 in the Crescent City (OK, Cafe du Monde closes about 2A). So, I waited until Sunday and I was disappointed. They were rather chewy and dry. Rather than perky rectangular pillows of fry dough, they were potato shaped--but that's OK since the place clearly makes everything by hand and does not use a machine like the New Orleans joints. Still, they put the beignets in a bag with powdered sugar then shake before handing it over. The powdered sugar should be served on the side so you can sugar as much or as little as you want. I saved some for other family members, and by the time I got them home, the powdered sugar was a cakey mess!\n\nI also tried their cinnamon roll, and it was just too large and bulky for me to handle. It was also rather sticky and a bit stale. I tried the doughnut muffin on two different occasions, and while tasty, it was nothing to write home about. They did serve these tiny alfajores, and while not like the ones in Argentina, they were quite tasty. Their cookies are also yummy. The coffee was dripped fresh, but a but too strong for me--probably perfect for coffee aficionados.\n\nI thought the service was fine and friendly. The place has a nice ambiance, with neighbors and police officers taking a short break from their morning routine.

Maybe someone forgot the cheese? I know the poor girl at the egg station was pumping it out as fast as humanly possible and I have lots of respect for her, but QC just can't really be maintained at that pace maybe. For $5, it's a very healthy portion especially for SF. I picked up my sandwich and started walking towards the beach while eating it.

Flaky crust, lots of good spinach flavor, not overcooked, rich enough without being too cheesy.\nThe lemon bar: delicious, sweet-tart, and super-rich.\nThe chocolate cake: almost better than mine.

On a sunny summer day, before you walk through the doorway of this bakery, you can glimpse the blue ocean and feel the cool breeze. As you enter the bakery, you're met with a display case full of tiny muffins, decadent cakes and pies, sumptuous bars and crispy-chewy cookies. \n\nThere's a counter with some stools along the window on the inside, where you can enjoy your food and desserts. If it's sunny, you can grab a couple of the chairs outside and bask in the warmth of the sun's rays or the heat of your freshly-fried beignets. So as much as I would have liked to love this place, I can only remain lukewarm to it. I tried a few of the cookies, the beignets, and the chocolate cake. The ginger-spice cookie was nice and chewy with a good dash of spice. The beignets, although very airy and piping hot out of the oil, left something to be desired compared to the pillowy beignets they have down south. That's possibly an unfair standard to hold it to. The chocolate cake was moist and topped with a rich layer of chocolate-fudge icing. I like my cake a bit thicker, while this cake seemed more fit for a sheet cake. While I would have tried some of their interesting muffins like the donut, I couldn't justify $2 for a tiny muffin that I could have finished in two bites, three bites max. If they had the banana-blueberry muffin, I might have considered it. I believe they also have lunch-type fare, although I didn't see any of it. \n\nThe service was decent, although it seems that they have yet to work out a very efficient system. Their register is an iPad. How modern. \n\nI think it's a good place to pick up some dessert if you're headed down to the beach to enjoy a day in the sun or are headed to a dinner party in the area.", "author": "Saunders C."}

Fresh baked taste and delicious.\n\nNot a fan of the coffee setup with Blue Bottle coffee because they use those funnels to pour hot water and brew per cup. See my review on Blue Bottle Coffee. Again, it just takes too long for a cup of drip coffee. There was only one person ahead of me who ordered 1 cup of coffee. But the lag in brew time took so long that they forgot who ordered what and ended up handing him two cups of coffee (and he took both!) Somehow, I got lost in the coffee queue because they started handing coffee to the guy behind me who ordered coffee as well. One star off for that setup.\n\nBUT 4 stars for an awesome breakfast sandwich that came with their baked biscuit, egg, chedder cheese and bacon. It wasn't overly greasy and actually had a hard time finishing it.\n\nI will continue to support this establishment especially after getting wind the upstairs neighbors knowingly moved into a commercial/residential block and are now complaining about bakery smells and whatnot.

Me and my man went in on a Saturday morning, not really knowing what to expect, and were pleasantly surprised. The place seemed packed from outside, but the line to order had subsided. Our order was taken right away, and our server let us know to expect a 10 minute wait for our breakfast sandwiches. So, we asked for a couple of coffees and a donut muffin and made ourselves comfortable. 10 or 15 minutes later, our name was called and we were handed breakfast sandwiches wrapped in foil. From bottom to top: biscuit bottom, egg, bacon, cheddar, biscuit top. Great. The biscuit was flaky, the eggs and bacon hot, the cheddar cheese melted. I'm a huge fan of the egg&cheese on a roll ubiquitous to bodegas and street carts in NY, and am always looking for something on this coast that compares, and this breakfast sandwich certainly does. Plus, its only $5! With 2 sandwiches, 2 coffees and the muffin, I think we spent a grand total of $16. Next time I'm out in the outer Sunset early in the morning (...) I'll definitely be eating a Devil's Teeth breakfast sandwich.", "author": "Piper A."}

I recently moved here from Atlanta and have really been craving an awesome biscuit.  I placed my order for a bacon, egg, and cheese biscuit only to be told that was a breakfast sandwich.  A biscuit is just a biscuit.  I've never in my life heard of a biscuit being called a breakfast sandwich (must be a west coast thing).  My wife ordered a grilled cheese and we also got two coffees.  25 minutes  later I had to check to see if my order was being processed because numerous other patrons came in after us and received their order before us.  We finally received our order and were completely disappointed.  The biscuit was similar to a canned biscuit and  it was thrown together.  The grilled cheese was extremely bland.  I could not believe an order that basic took that long to make.  I had high hopes for this place and was very let down.

As we approached the front of the line to order we were overcome with views and smells of cinnamon rolls, scones, cupcakes, cookies, cakes, etc.  My eyes were bigger than my stomach and I wanted to order 1 of each item.  We ordered the breakfast sandwich and the breakfast sandwich special.  While waiting for our food we tried their beignets, holy moly are these things dangerously good.  We drove a few minutes and parked at the beach to eat our breakfast sandwiches, it was great because our dog was with us.  BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICHES OF ALL TIME... SERIOUSLY!  We probably could have shared 1 sandwich because they are huge, but wanted to indulge so we got our own.

THEY MAKE THEM RIGHT THERE, just dip them in oil and powder 'em up, and there you go: a one-dollar dollop of heaven. The other stuff is good, too, but holy lord. The coffee is Blue Bottle, a nice touch, but mine could have been made stronger and hotter. Haven't heard that complaint from others, so I'll let it go. I just moved to the Sunset and have been trying to think of excuses to get people to visit...and I just found one.", "author": "Hillary R."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 3}, "datePublished": "2011-07-18", "description": "3.5* - As much as I want to love this place, I don't understand the reviews here. Nothing is bad - but it is all homemade goodness that I can make at home as well. However, there is convenience and variety which enhance the desire for it. I did enjoy $1 beignets sunday - can you ever go wrong with a beignet? (well I guess you could.. this is not a new orleans beignet from cafe du monde, but it is good). The business is family-run and has a cute interior although I will say the whole operation of watching them bake is a bit distracting because it isn't always cleanly organized.", "author": "Jeannette L."}

Just sampled the cinnamon roll, incredibly tasty but so intense I would probably only share one. Blue bottle coffee was good. Spinach quiche was just so-so, a little too cheesy and crust was soggy. Hubs' breakfast sandwich was good, but very crumbly. Everything looked very tasty, homestyle baked goods with quality ingredients. Hope they make it! Wish they had a couple more savory vegetarian items, otherwise would give 5 stars!", "author": "L J."}

But this review is for the woman working the register. My wife and I ordered 12 beignets today and went to pay.  The place was packed with a big Sunday crowd and was noisy.  We heard her say $13 dollars and we handed her the cash.  She then said in an irritated voice \"$13 dollars\".  My wife asked her how much did we give her and she said it was $13 dollars.  So what was the problem? We're confused.  So it turns out that it was really $13.02 but she didn't explain to us that she needed two more cents.  She just repeated \"$13 dollars\" and looked pissed off.  All she had to say was that we need to pay two more cents.  I don't know if she was stressed out from the crowd but being rude with a customer who just wants to pay for their food was a turn off for us.  We're not interested in going back.", "author": "Jim T."}

The pastries, sweets, homemade bread (you can buy a half loaf!), chicken salad, and delicious coffee are all winners.  So glad they are in our neighborhood!", "author": "Heidi S."}

Sunday beignets, the breakfast sandwich and the donut muffin are awesome. Staff are very friendly. They seems to still be trying to work out efficient systems, but that's understandable since they are new. Here's to more hip food options in the Outer Sunset!", "author": "Charlie B."}

(minor addiction)  i've always been a fan of breakfast sandwiches to start the day off right, but devil's teeth does it better than any other place in the bay area hands down. staff is chill, baked goods are always amazing (reccomend the doughnut muffin, not too sweet like a lot of their goodies) but nothing compares to that buttery buiscut with chewy bacon, warm cheese and delicious egg. i've considered applying for a job here just so i can stop spending all my money on god-forsaken breakfast sandwiches. keep up the good work devil's teeth, i really love what you guys have going on.", "author": "Aaron S."}

I finnaly got my chance last weekend and I was rewarded. The items 3 items I purchaced were the  blackberry muffin, lemon blueberry cake with cream chesse frosting and a breakfest sami. The muffin and cake were azaming. Neither were overly sweet which really allowed the flavor to come though. The cake was a b day cake for my girlfriend. It was so good she only let me have three bites of it, but every one was worth it. The only disappoint was the the sami. All the elements except for the eggs were great. The eggs were kinda runny which put a damper on the whole thing. I will still be coming back and know for next time to make sure the eggs are cooked the way I like em. Also I am gonna order my own piece of cake!!!!(one for the gf too)", "author": "Brian P."}
