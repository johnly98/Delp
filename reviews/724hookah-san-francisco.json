They definitely know how to pack a bowl and the quality of smoke is fantastic compared to most places in town. Service is okay but most service at hookah lounges leaves something to be desired. I think hookah maintenance would be immensely improved if they could give people tongs but I can also understand why *most* people should not be trusted with managing coal rotation. \n\nMy biggest qualm with this place is the seating arrangements. There is a lot of space and seating, but every time I've been in here, it's really hard to actually navigate in and out of wherever it is you're seated. There isn't a lot of legroom and it's easy to bump into and knock over coals or entire hookahs, especially if you're seated in the booths where you have to crawl through a maze of legs and hookahs to get out. It's just not super safe and makes for an uncomfortable \"lounging\" experience. Also, a lot of the seats themselves aren't very comfortable (too upright) and some of freestanding benches aren't stable either, which isn't safe when you're getting around hookahs. \n\nThis place could probably use a new layout design and probably more people on the clock for better service, but it's still a solid place to come in for hookah on the off hours when you can navigate more comfortably.", "author": "Nikki I."}

I walked in and was greeted by a familiar face I was my guy Ivan I had been to a different hookah spot that he was working at and I knew if he was working here I was going to be taken care of. We talked to the guy at the register his name was Oz or Ozzy but man this guy was cool took really good care of us was on his toes and kept the energy in the room he brought us out his hookah mix I think it was a Gun mint mix but it was good and smooth! They changed out our coals and even tho they don't hand out tongs to everyone they let us get one. I ordered a black tea and I was piping hot the way it should be ! Ozzy was telling us that they are doing renovations and it's looking really nice only down side it was a tad bit too hot in there but other than that they put me in a good mood I was happy and singing along to the music and felt relaxed !

That's what really sold us, thank you Yelp! It was empty when we first got there and the service was great.\n\nI asked him what type of coals they used and they said Coco naras and they had both starbuzz and fumari tobacco. Starbuzz is mid quality tobacco but fumari is that top notch stuff.\n\nWe got the white peach with ambrosia and the flavors mixed really well. The amount of clouds you get was good so you know the packing of the tobacco was done well.\n\nThey don't get four-five stars because as it got a little busier then older clients got a bit neglected. We didn't get any coal refills at all until we asked and we had to ask multiple times. They don't offer water that is not bottled. The music was a bit low for a hookah joint. The seating area is also a bit weird and looks sort of dirty.

Because of that, coming here the other day to accompany my date, I had no idea what to expect, or what to compare the place to, but I WILL say this: my first thought upon entering the bar was that it reminded me of the opium dens you'll see in movies from time to time, with Snowpiercer standing out in particular. Not dirty, albeit a bit dingy, and quite dark, but mostly because of all the cushy seating spread throughout the place, and people lounging and relaxing all about.\n\nOne of the major complaints in other reviews was in regards to the service, and I will agree that after getting your initial drinks and hookah, service tends to fall off the radar: attention is hard to get, and even once you do, they take forever to bring you whatever you've asked for. Service, for the most part, is friendly at least.\n\n***Accessibility Info***\n\nVenue - Due to all the seating throughout the place, accessibility is a bit hit or miss. There's a walkway down the center of the bar that's on the narrow end, and if some of the seats are moved around, space can certainly be made, albeit limited.\n\nBathroom - Didn't try them.", "author": "Johnny W."}

I own three Maya's and frequent smoke shops in the east bay regularly. Brought my girl from Atlanta to try this place out. We came on a Sunday night and it was relatively quiet. We bought one hookah, one green tea and a bottle of water - $32 total. Would say this is definitely on the pricier side for hookah but again, was really excited to try it given the reviews. I got a white peach/vanilla/blueberry mix. Everything came out okay and our server was hospitable. Unfortunately, ten minutes into smoking I got very nauseous. Like, nauseous to the point where I had to tell the server. I've NEVER had that reaction to shisha before and I'm not new to this. I let the server know that the hookah made me sick shortly after smoking and kindly asked if there was anything they could do for the inconvenience (i.e., a refund because I legit threw up). He told me that there was nothing he could do and \"different people have different reactions.\" I thought that was super inconsiderate given that literally no time had passed from the time I received/smoked the hookah to the time I started feeling sick. So sadly, I can't recommend this place. They should look into possibly how clean their materials are/how they are packing shisha because I'm not sure why else this would've made me sick. \n\nAnd no, I didn't eat anything weird or out of the ordinary before coming.

At the end he brought it down to $78.\n\nAll I can say is wtf - from $15 for a hookah to $35???!! Not cool at all.

I've been to many hookah spots in the US and internationally, and this has to be the 2nd worst one I've been to. \n\nFirst, it looks nothing like pictures which means to me that maybe it has gone down in quality since folks have been here. \n\nSecond, we are all crammed in on leather sofas in a dark not-very-well ventilated room that is the hookah bar. Whatever happened to tables and private seating like a restaurant? \n\nThird, the kids they got working at the counter are a little snappy and distracted by friends who come in instead of attending to their paying customers. We asked if we needed to seat ourselves and the kid snapped back \"I'll sit you after we finish our transaction.\" So we finished the transaction and right after he started talking to one of his friends, ignored us for about 2 minutes and then I had to ask again if we could be seated, because half of the place is roped off for VIP I guess? \n\nForth, the 2 of us ordered a hookah about 10 minutes before a group that came in after us and they received theirs before ours. Strange. \n\nFifth, we ordered a mix flavor of peach/rose/lemon and we were served something with mint. And when I went to ask about it, they asked me if I ordered a completely different flavor. After getting the second one, it tastes like lemon /peach and...you guessed it: mint!\n\nI'm not a picky person when it comes to my establishments of entertainment. I mean, I've been to a hole in the wall in Bali but this place- not so bueno.  \n\nI give it a one based on the proximity to our hotel. The only reason we are still here attempting to smoke our hookah is because we paid for it and I don't think we'll be able to get a refund.

Was hesitant about coming because hookah in other lounges gave me a migraine, well not this hookah lounge. The guy at the front register, I think his name is Osman suggested a flavor that was fruity and sweet. The hookah hit so well, and tasted amazing. Osman was very nice to us, he had sparklers for my friends bday and his customer service was perfect. My friends hookah was harsh and he came by and we asked for a refill but he suggested us not to get a refill and that he will fix it, all he did was blew in it and it was smooth like it just started.

But this is probably the only hookah lounge I'd go to an would totally recommend it to friends. The music is usually chill; sometimes ethnic and sometimes modern day r&b artists. (First time was totally a Drake night)\n\nI think the first flavor we had was Sex on the Beach and it was smooth! I used to have asthma and it's hard to inhale any time of smoke but this was alright after a few hits. \n\nToday we tried the white gummy and it had a fruit, yet, minty flavor to it. Not bad. Still wanting to try more flavored tho! \n\nThe pro's is that it stays open late and you can usually just get situated and attended to right away. Seeing that it's a family owned business and the OG's come in brings a slight grin to my face. You go uncle! \n\nOverall, this is a great place to hang with friends after dinner.

The high level overview:\n\n-Music is too loud and you end up shouting over it.  Maybe this depends on where you sit.  I'm usually sitting in left front corner of the place, so maybe the right side is better with acoustics.  \n-Music choice is also not what I prefer, but it's not horrible.  Top 40 with an urban influence...sometimes the music videos are playing on the TVs.  Again not my first choice and certainly not at the volume it's at, but you come here for the conversation anyway (which is more difficult when the music is blasting, making it a con, not a pro)\n-Service is very hit or miss.  I've been here when they replace the coals more than you need, and this time was the complete opposite of that - I had to get up once to ask for the metal tongs, and then again when our coals had almost burned out to ask for a change.  This is not cool in a hookah bar - I should never be requesting a coal change.  \n-Drinks are nothing special - would be nice to have a fresh juice or a smoothie rather than just basic tea and soda choices.  \n-I've had good hookah flavors and bad ones - the 'special combo' with 2 flavors mixed together was actually one of the highlights because of the uniqueness of it. \n\nI'll come back here because it's within 15 minutes walk from my place, and it's $15-20 per hookah (enough for 2 people for 2 hours).  I wish there were better options, but this one suffices as the baseline option for late night hookah.", "author": "Ben K."}

I am happy to say that 724 is that happy medium. \n\nOpening at 6, it sets it at the perfect time for a relaxing, and de-stressing,   after work smoke. Or, going a mere three-four hours after opening, it becomes a very fun and very welcoming hotbed of community and culture--usually Thursday, Friday, and Saturday.\n\nThe staff is knowledgable and friendly and the hookah flavors are fantastic, particularly ambrosia; white gummi, ambrosia citrus mint; orange; and rose mint. The staff are a friendly bunch of guys who always strike up genuine conversations with customers while never forgetting tasks at hand. \n\nThe price range is great and the ability to choose cash OR card trumps the neighboring lounges in convenience. I recommend this hookah lounge to anyone who is an experienced hookah smoker or someone who is curious or wants to get his/her night out going with something that isn't the usual per-game.", "author": "Cody R."}

I'd probably go back if I was in the area in need of something to do.  Here are my pros and cons:\n\nPROS:\n-  Good price ($15 per hookah)\n-  Nice seating arrangement, couches were pretty comfy.  The square cushion seat things didn't look as comfy but I didn't try them.\n-  Good variety of flavors\n\nCONS:\n-  It was freezing inside this place!  At first I thought it was so cold because the door was open, but I looked and it seemed to be closed, so I'm not sure what the deal was.  My friends and I would have had a much better time if we weren't freezing our asses off.\n-  The music was way too loud.  I can understand music being that loud at a club where people are dancing, but nobody was dancing here. Everyone was sitting in groups, trying to relax and talk with their friends.  It was really hard to hear our conversations with the music that loud.", "author": "Lauren S."}

I've tried several different flavors and none of them hit very well.  Service is slow and inconsistent - I constantly have to get up and request changing of coals, problems with the hookah, etc.  I don't mind the staff socializing with friends and smoking but please don't let that detract from your attentiveness!\n\nI think I've had enough.

This place is really unorganized and shitty quality. Anyways the \"manager\" with the glasses is rude and very unprofessional. The other guy who claimed to be the next thing close to a \"manager\" was very nice and understanding of the situation. We ended up not getting our refund but received a voucher for next time.. But why would we come again, after having a bad experience. If you want cheap & shitty hookah and bad service this the place to go!!", "author": "Christy N."}

However, in this case, I feel the need to warn everyone away from this place for issues ranging from incredibly slow service, broken hookahs with chewed off mouthpieces (gross!), and the cherry on top, sketchy hidden costs imposed after-the-fact (such as a minimum # of hookahs for a group and clean-up fees).  \n\nAfter being passed over for a seat multiple times, then waiting over 30 minutes for 2 hookahs, we finally received our hookahs (one of which had the aforementioned mouthpiece that was so mangled we couldn't fit the plastic piece into it).  \n\nOnly a few minutes later, we were informed by our server, then by the owner (!) that we would now have to buy one more hookah because we were a large group despite the fact that the table next to us had the same number of people and hookahs.  This started the general impression that we were arbitrarily being hit with price hikes.  Also, being pestered with servers every few minutes, after being ignored for so long was pretty obnoxious.\n\nThis only continued as a friend of ours started feeling very light-headed and moved to go outside.  He tried to make it outside, but started to vomit as he went out the door.  Without hesitation, our server approached him and tried to hit him up for a cleaning fee of $25 dollars.  We brushed past the server to follow our friend outside and make sure he was ok. Another employee came out several minutes later and informed us it was now $30 for clean up.\n\nIn addition to the bro-y, cheap club ambiance, the repeated poor service, rude treatment, and price-hiking ensure that I won't be back. Steer clear of this place!", "author": "Jillian C."}

Saw the reviews figured I'd give it a shot, walk in no hostess to seat you, just a dude in the back with glasses couldn't be more  than 23 yrs old and clearly overwhelmed. He was helpful in recommending a decent flavor and the hookah was ok, but everything was a complete disaster from there. You pay up front for what you order, i paid for a Moroccan Tea to go with my hookah which never came. How long does it take to prepare a tea? I asked where the restroom was same ass clown manager points to the back but said someone was using it so i need to wait. Fine no problem, i wait about 10 min see the door slightly open so i decide to knock and not burst in. \"WHAT!!!!!!!!\" Jerk Manager screams from inside the bathroom.... I respond back i didn't realize someone was in here the door is open??? No answer i go back to my table still no tea......

These two guys and their entire staff took outstanding good care of me and all my guest (and there were a lot of us).  Don't think I've ever been accommodated by an establishment like this before. From the time I called 724 Hookah and spoke to Adul I felt like I was in good hands. You were willing to work with me on everything I wanted to have a successful birthday and made sure we had a good time. Don't think I ever heard a \"No We Can't Do That\" from you guys.\n \nEVERYONE really enjoyed themselves and raved how yummy and smooth the flavors of the hookahs were. We ordered at least seven different flavored Hookahs which everyone rotated. My favorite was a house special that had guava and rose in it. One of your staff members came around very often to make sure our coals were always hot. We never had to ask. \n\nI was also blown away of how nicely you set up a private area for us to hold my guest in. There was enough space to fit us all. The atmosphere was very nice and chill. The music was great!!! I think I learned a few new dance steps from your regular guests too\nWe are looking forward to coming back very soon. I really appreciate you guys for making everything run so smoothly for us. This will be a birthday to remember for a long time!!!", "author": "Carolyn D."}

The staff was immediately welcoming and courteous, and the comfortable couches, soft lighting, and internationally eclectic music all lend themselves to an overall relaxing atmosphere.\n\nAnother plus is 724 has many flavors to choose from, both classic and experimental.

And I've been to every hookah bar in the city (and bay area), this place ranks at the top.  The only other place where I've seen as good a service is SmokeThis is SJ (which I think is partially owned by the same person.. so go figure)\n\nThey carry the usual fruity mixes people love, and they also have Nakhla's Double Apple that us old arab fogies love.\n\nThe prices are very reasonable, very nice decor, seats are plentiful - and they dont play musical chairs with their customers... moving people around to seat others, they always try to accommodate.
