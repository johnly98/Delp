{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2018-08-22", "description": "As an avid foodie and a pop-up restauranteur, I'll probably say some things that sound harsh but hopefully they utilize my feedback. \n\nThere were several things I identified that could use some work. I breakdown noodle soup into three main components. The first is the broth, second is the noodles, and lastly is the toppings. Ill start with the soup. I ordered the Niku Udon. The broth is claimed to come from fish and beef. At first sip, I felt it lacked a true depth of flavor. It wasn't salty enough nor was there enough beef or fish flavor. It also was extremely sweet which might have overpowered any natural beef or fish sweetness. The noodles are precooked and rolled into batches. When you order, they do a quick parboil to reheat the noodles. Since the noodles sit on a rack, the internal temperature and external temperature is different. Even after the parboil, the noodles aren't completely hot. One thing I did like about the noodles was the texture. It was chewy and bouncy at each bite. You've got to eat fast though or else it will start to soften and crumble. Lastly, the niku beef was so overcooked, it was like chewing beef jerky. Kagawa-Ya separates the beef and broth in different heated containers; however, this just allows the cooks beef to continue to cook which brings it to the point of over cooking. In addition, since Niku beef is supposed to be braised, they should probably use meat that has more fat content. \n\nAt $14 a bowl of Niku Udon, I expected a lot more. I've had plenty of experience eating in asian countries where Maragume Udon is like their McDonalds. I don't think I'll venture back here to eat unless they change the process they make their beef and broth. And for those that want extra udon, it is $3. So at $30 for my two Niku udons and an extra portion, I don't think it was quite worth it. The food they presented to me more closely aligns to a price tag of $6 per bowl. Save your money and go get poke at the Twitter market. I have attached a picture from Kagawa-Ya with the dry beef :(", "author": "Jason W."}

Among my numerous trips to Japan the one thing I truly missed was a good bowl of udon noodles.  The place is in an economically upon and coming area - but is new & clean inside.  The staff was nice and smiles!  The portions good sized, but pricey for udon.  The taste wasn't quite like Japan (maybe a little sweeter broth - could quite finger it) but good for the states. I tried the beef with a shrimp tempura piece.  Tempura wasn't life changing - in the US the batter is almost always too heavy & such was the case here.  But all and all my noodles tasted good for my American pallet. And that's what really counts.  You'll never get an actual Japanese taste in the US as the chemical composition of water is different (for starters) which impacts almost everything served.  But if I found the place delicious and am very likely to return.", "author": "Robert C."}

What's really lacking here is the broth flavor and dry, unpleasant, flavorless, beef. The broth is too mild to deliver any flavor to the noodles, maybe a bit more dashi? Beef was horribly cooked (or possibly the wrong cut of meat is chosen here) and absolutely did not warrant the $14 base price of this bowl.\n\nFish cake tempura - Added to my bowl, tasted very delicious while lightly soaked with the broth. Didn't have any excess oily bits. Their tempura is probably the real star here.\n\nChicken skewer - Flavorful and juicy. Nothing unique, but tasted amazing in comparison to the \"ok\" udon.\n\nSpam musubi - They've folded in a lot of furikake, not sure it does much though. It's salty meat and rice, you can't really screw this up.\n\nNiku rice ball - Okay, I'd just like to clarify that had I known the meat in my udon was going to be dry and gross I would have avoided this entirely. This only gets its own section still because this was the weirdest rice ball I've ever had in my entire life? Again folded in with furikake, but the meat, instead of being in the center, was also folded in with the rice? It was literally all over the place and just made the entire thing taste like college ruled paper. Disgusting.\n\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if I'm in the area I might pick up a piece of tempura or something.\n\nEdit: To the owner, thank you for responding so quickly.

Kagawa-Ya is a cafeteria style udon restaurant in the heart of SF.  It has a good variety of udon choices as well as tempura.  I was even surprised to see spam musubis!  \n\nWhile the pricing isn't all that cheap, the portions for their udon are pretty large.  The tempura is about the right price at $1.50 per piece (regardless of vegetable or shrimp tempura).  Spam musubi is quite pricey at $3.  I ended up going with the Kitsune Udon which came in at $9.5.  The only udon under $10 just fyi.  Anyways, it was alright.  The broth had a great dashi flavor, noodles were cooked great.  The inari was just ok, a bit too big, would've been nice if it had been cut in half or something.  The inari also felt rather thick.  The shrimp tempura was okay, seemed like frozen pre-battered kind.  The vegetable tempura was great, I was glad they had pumpkin tempura available.  As for the spam musubi, it was good, the rice was seasoned with furikake which added some extra flavor.  It didn't appear to have any kind of teriyaki sauce like you might find in some musubis.\n\nOverall, it is no Marukame Udon, however, it is a good attempt at the cafeteria-style udon restaurant.  The food here is great if you're craving udon, especially since there aren't many restaurants in the Bay that specifically specialize in udon.  Personally, I wish the udon had a small-sized available, that way I could eat more tempura.  The udon portions are quite large.", "author": "Bryson L."}

At least it's famous for something?\n\nEven though I had plans to visit Kagawa-Ya later this week, I decided to stop by yesterday to give it a try. Kagawa-Ya's specialty is their housemade udon which is served 5 different ways ($9.50-$14): warm dashi broth, cold dashi broth, braised beef, beef curry, and kabocha. You can add a side of tempura (shrimp, kobocha, sweet potato, broccoli rabe, or tamago) or an soft boiled egg for +$1.50 each. If you're not feeling noodles, they have a curry rice option (beef or vegetarian). They also have sides like spam musubi, inari, and onigiri. For those with MSG sensitivities, the staff told me that the curry contains MSG but the dashi and creamy kabocha doesn't. \n\nIt's a fast casual eatery - line up, grab a tray, order by number, watch your order being assembled, grab a plate and pick out your choice of tempura under the heat lamps, grab your udon/rice bowl, and pay. I appreciated that the tip choices were 5%, 10%, and 15% unlike some fast casual spots who program the tip choices as 18%, 20%, and 25%. I always tip for fast casual but you shouldn't expect customers to pay the same tip as a sit-down restaurant when they're having to serve and clean up after themselves. \n\nI love kabocha so I naturally gravitated towards #5 Creamy Kabocha Udon w/ roasted kabocha, dashi broth, cream, nori, green onions, bonito ($11) and added tempura shrimp, kabocha, and sweet potato (+$1.50 each): http://bit.ly/2p66i5C. Since the udon just contains noodles and broth (no kabocha), I highly recommend adding tempura for a full meal. \n\nI really enjoyed the creamy kabocha broth which was deliciously creamy with a good savory sweetness. The housemade udon noodles were al-dente but were missing that toothsome chewy bite. The tempura was nicely battered and fried producing a light, airy crunchy exterior. It was perfect for dipping into the creamy kabocha broth. I just wish the tempura was warm. Even though the tempura was sitting under the heat lamp, it was tepid.  \n\nService was friendly and fast. I was in and out in less than 20 minutes making it the perfect quick lunch spot. My only suggestion is to place the water dispenser out front so the cashier doesn't have to be bothered with filling cups when they're ringing up a customer.  \n\nFormerly Happy Donuts, the new space is spacious and contemporary. There's seating for about 40 - two-tops and communal tables. I like that there's an open kitchen so everything is transparent.  \n\nKagawa-Ya is a great addition to the Mid-Market lunch scene especially on cold, foggy days that call for a piping hot bowl of soup. But, just like with most of the new fast casual eateries in the city, it's not cheap. It was $18.50 out the door for lunch (no drink).

You grab a tray, tell the person which udon you want (menu on the board) and within 1 minute, the noodle, broth, meat and topping is all scoop inside a bowl and passed to you. You can then proceed to add a half boiled/poached egg and grab individual fried tempura ($1.50/piece) to your liking. Katsu, tempura sauce on the side when you're down paying.\n\nI got #3 Niku udon, which was essentially beef + onions. The broth was very rich and flavorful. They were pretty generous with the amount of beef, to the point where I couldn't finish it. I added a half boiled egg, and it was the perfect consistency.  Additionally also got some tempura-- which were still crispy regardless of the fact that we got the last pick of the last batch. \n\nEven though you don't get direct table service, the customer service here was excellent. The dispenser was out of tempura sauce, and they were unable to make a fresh batch since we came right before closing. Came back around and they poured out what was remaining in the dispenser for us to use. \n\nTLDR; Fast food style udon with fresh ingredients. Overall good food and would definitely come back again. Great service!", "author": "Jenny N."}

I've never really been into Udon, but I know every time I see one of my friends in Hawaii eating Marukame, I want tempura. What's not to love about tempura? \n\nIt can be on the pricey side, I think I ended up paying $20+, but I got a kitsune udon (beef sounded too heavy at the moment) with a bunch of tempura and a spam misubi and poached egg. Very tasty, and now I like udon, but probably only from places that have tempura (since tempura is awesome).\n\nIt's too bad this place is so far away.

Seemed like comparable quality to Ramen Bar.  A strangely huge space given the sparse seating; hope they aren't being gouged in rent.\n\nNiku Udon: The udon noodles were large, firm and delicious.  The broth had a heavy ginger streak with some beefiness mixed in.  The meat was just ok.  It was like something at Yoshinoya, but clumped together and not as thinly sliced.  I kinda prefer the Yoshinoya beef more, though everything else in the Niku Udon was better.\n\nCurry Potato: A creamy curried potato mash deep fried in the shape of a hash brown.  Quite filling and bursting with texture/flavor contrasts.\n\nShrimp Tempura: Pretty much what you'd expect.  Compared to the Curry Potato, it wasn't as good for being at the same price point.\n\nBeef Niku Onigiri: Interesting presentation where the seaweed was wrapped in plastic and then wrapped around the rice/beef mixture.  The pro is that you are guaranteed a crispy non-soggy seaweed wrap.  The con is that you probably can't wrap an onigiri like a professional.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 5}, "datePublished": "2018-04-21", "description": "You know, I can't believe my unbelievable luck of having two new udon places open up in SF during the past year. Udon is one of my favorite foods, and to have smacked right on Market Street makes it even better. I was very excited to try out Kagawa-Ya, and I came here on a weekday evening with a friend to satisfy my hunger for udon. I was expecting it to be really crowded here since it's smacked right in the middle of where all the tech companies are and we came during dinner hours but was surprised when it was at 20% capacity. The good thing about that was that we got to choose our seats, and we decided to sit on the stools by the window peering outside. \n\nWe then went up to the line and ordered our respective udon dishes. I decided to go for the Beef Curry Udon and for the tempura I got the sweet egg tempura, vegetable fritter, and the curry potato. They have a wide selection of tempura and I like how you're able to just choose one of whatever tempura you want instead of having multiple of the same tempura. I sampled the beef curry udon first and was very pleased with my choice, as the curry tasted fantastic and the tender beef just falls apart once I bit into it. What I like even more than the beef personally was the potatoes, and curry is always better with potatoes. One thing about the curry udon is that it wasn't as thick as I would have liked, and this was honestly more personal preference than anything. I moved onto the tempura next, and I started with the sweet egg tempura. I think the sweet egg tempura was alright, but to be honest, I never had a sweet egg tempura before, and I think it's more likely that I just don't like sweet eggs as a tempura in general. The vegetable fritter, on the other hand, was to my liking, and it was pretty crunchy and was a nice meld of vegetables. However, my favorite tempura was the curry potato, since it had a soft crusty exterior and a very soft interior. The curry flavor wasn't strong in the curry potato, but that could be because I was eating the beef curry udon at the same time, which probably overwhelmed the subtle curry flavor in the curry potato. Nevertheless, I felt very satisfied with the curry potato.\n\nOverall, I was very pleased with the meal, and I really like how they gave a generous helping of beef and potatoes with the udon. One thing about the price is, it's actually more than what I would expect to pay for udon, and the curry udon alone was $14. I can somewhat justify this since there were very generous portions of udon, and I did feel really bloated after eating it. I would definitely come back here again, and I could see myself ordering the Creamy Kabocha with Chicken Udon, or the Cream of Clam & Leeks Udon the next time I come here. As an aside, I wish they had more cold udon options besides the regular Cold Udon, and hopefully, they would expand their repertoire of cold udon. Other than that, I would highly recommend Kagawa-Ya for anyone with a craving for good udon in SF.", "author": "Nelson X."}

I came here tonight on this very rainy evening craving something warm and soupy and this fit the bill in every single way. I ordered the clam and leek broth with my udon and it was incredible. If you love clam chowder, you're going to love this broth, as its thick and creamy, and shares a lot of the same flavors as your typical bowl of chowder. The broth itself has small bits of clam scattered throughout. I'm not sure if bacon was the best topping to put on the udon (it seemed kind of random), but as somebody who likes bacon, I'm not one to complain :) The udon noodles themselves are cooked to order in front of you so you can expect them to be the perfect texture and consistency. After I picked up my ramen, I selected a few pieces of tempera - the sweet egg, the chicken, and sweet potato. Each piece of tempera was light and crunchy on the outside with no sign of soggy oil. Definitely grab one or two with your udon.

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-05-13", "description": "Overview: Kagawa-Ya is a Japanese casual-eatery specializing in udon noodles located under UberHQ between 10th and 11th on Market St. Its dishes are simpler than the equivalently priced Ramen place but they offer a wide variety of tempura pieces a-la-carte for people like me who need more variety of texture and flavor in every meal.\n\nThe Establishment: Kagawa-ya's interior is spacious and beautiful with 3-story high ceilings, modern furniture, and a clean, open look. It's almost a cafeteria style system where you start at one end of the kitchen and pick up a tray/bowls and request what you want from the chefs/staff.\n\nThe Food: I have both high praise and high criticism for the food here at Kagawa-Ya. Individual aspects of their food are excellent. The udon has a excellent chew, texture and flavor, the broths have just the right balance of sour and savory, the tempura pieces are battered and fried with a good level of crunch without being oily, and the imported drink choices (nectar and teas) are fun to sample. On the flip side, Kagawa-Ya needs to increase the complexity of its meals or increase its value to compete with the well-established ramen places nearby such as Marufuku and Iza. The last time I was here I felt that the beef was overcooked and chewy. \n\nThe Service: This is a order-up-front then bus-it-yourself establishment so I would consider tip being optional here.\n\nConclusions: Kagawa-Ya is a beautiful, spacious, casual Japanese udon shop with high potential. I suspect that in 2 years, it will either be one of Mid Market's new cornerstones or be out of business.", "author": "Andrew H."}
{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-12-08", "description": "I was really excited to eat at Kagawa-Ya because I had hopes that it would be similar to or match up to Marukame Udon in Waikiki, Oahu, HI...but man, was I was disappointed. \n\nTo be fair, the concept here is similar to what I was looking for. An fresh udon bar with selections of tempura and yakimomo (pan-fried appetizers). In essence, I think Kagawa-Ya achieved that but San Francisco ruined this one for me. First off, the location is slightly unappealing. While it is in SOMA, close to Uber HQ and Twitter HQ, the neighborhood around it makes me uncomfortable to walk around at night (near Civic Center/Tenderloin). That said, the inside of the restaurant looks clean and modern. The quality and flavor here was mediocre in comparison to what I have had before, lackluster and oversalted at its worst. \n\nYou line up at first to select from their preset menu of udon styles (warm soup, cold udon). After they heat the udon noodles, combine it with broth and toppings, you can take a plate and pick any tempura from a line of selections; ranging from tempura shrimp, carrot, broccoli, curry croquette, spam musubi etc. This style of serving is very similar to Marukame Udon. Overall, the style is similar but the price is 2x as expensive as its counter part in Hawaii. In comparison, the tempura here was poorly made, lukewarm (not nice and piping hot, freshly fried), oily and very heavy to the palate. I really like properly-made Japanese tempura, which seems to be so hard to find in the SF Bay Area.  I guess compared to the average Japanese restaurant, the tempura here is alright. But again, not as fresh tasting or light as the restaurant in Oahu, Hawaii. \n\nI will say two of their udon soups were more inventive, going for fusion flavors like cream of clam and leek udon, and spicy tomato udon with roasted shiitake. I was quite excited when I saw them and ended up choosing the cream of clam and leek broth. One thing that I definitely surprised me was that the quality of their udon noodles was very underwhelming. It honestly tasted like frozen udon noodles from Japan. It didn't have the nice bouncy al dente texture and freshness from homemade udon, which it actually really quite nice and more alkaline. I don't know where their udon is made or sourced, but they didn't have a noodle chef making it and it also didn't taste homemade to me. \n\nNow onto the broth. I'm going to be honest, I might be more harsh and critical about broth and taste because I often cook Japanese food at home, eat out at mostly Japanese restaurants, and have stayed in Japan for 2 weeks recently. I expected the broth to taste light, clean, ungreasy and well-balanced. It was the exact opposite of that. The clam and leek broth was oversalted, heavy and did not have a single clam in it! It makes me wonder if they used clam juice/clams in a bottle instead of real clams cooked down. The broth did not have depth and was overly heavy. I couldn't finish my dish, which is actually REALLY rare for me.  My husband ordered the classic niku (beef) udon, which was slightly better. However, it too was oversalted and lacked depth and complexity. For the price of about ~$15-18 per bowl of udon, I was pretty disappointed. The spam musubi was pretty standard and nothing to write home about. Because the tempura was lukewarm, fried in a bad batter, it tasted greasy a lack of crispy texture. Tempura, when done well, does a great job at highlighting the freshness of the vegetables, which was not executed well here. \n\nOverall, it was not a pleasant experience. While seating was plentiful and clean, the environment felt sterile. It reminded me a dormitory cafeteria but without the liveliness and chatter of a college campus. The food was mediocre- broth, noodles AND tempura. I know I am a food snob when it comes to Japanese food, so I understand that my review is low and disagrees with others. That being said, I think even if you do not eat Japanese food much, there are still better options for udon in San Francisco. Maybe they are a bit further, but they'll be a better bang for your wallet and it will taste noticeably better. \n\nI will try to come back next year to see if there was been improvement.", "author": "Jenny Z."}

Although I think this is a solid contender, the menu options are fewer and of course SF pricing are always going to be bumped up a bit. Then again, well worth the 3 block journey versus a 5 hour flight for an udon fix.\n\nThe breakdown:\n\n1) Start by ordering your base bowl, there are 5 options: Kitsune (classic), Cold, Niku (Beef), Curry Beef, a Vegetarian option, and Mushroom Curry (Rice). These base bowls range from $9.50-14\n\n2) Add on as many soft poached eggs or pieces of tempura your heart desires. They are $1.50/each. I was disappointed that the pumpkin tempura were on the small side but the shrimp were big enough to satisfy.\n\n3) Grab a spot and chow down.\n\nI was pretty impressed by the solid umami broth in my kitsune bowl.

I could eat a whole plate of just tempura with the tempura dipping sauce.\n\nFound street parking nearby.\n\nNice way to warm the body and soul on a windy nippy SF day!

The portion is perfect for a nice lunch but I suppose the extra tempura options would be perfect if one were to be hungrier. The udon noodles are made in house and when I was there it looked like a lot of workers were eating there for lunch. \n\nI guess if you can afford the $12-15 lunch then this would be a good spot to frequent. My experience ordering was extremely efficient and simple. The menu is small with only about 6 different types of soup. The order starts by grabbing a tray, letting the cook know your order, and then scooting over to choose additional tempura munchies for $1.50 a piece. To make the bowls the cook simply puts a portion of noodles in a bowl and ladles in the soup of choice. It took about 2 minutes to get my food and pay. \n\nHere's what I tried:\n\nKabocha udon- 3/5. Ever since I went to marugame Monzo in LA I've been dying to find another creamy udon dish that would be up to par. So this dish is really what drew me to try this restaurant anyway. In the end all I have to say is that they're different. Kabocha is a Japanese pumpkin and so the kabocha soup has an earthy, sweet, seaweed taste to it. It was good, but I think I was expecting something else. This dish was $13. \n\nBeef udon -4/5. What the classic beef udon should taste like. It had thin slivers of beef and some green onions. Not bad! $13 was a bit steep though. \n\nCurry udon-4.5/5. Definitely my favorite of the three. The udon came with tender pieces of beef stew cubes, carrots, potatoes and some red pickled vegetable. After eating it a while the spice of the curry begins to creep up on you, but it's the perfect amount to leave your nose a little runny. Sometimes curry udon comes with thick kind of gloopy soup and it doesn't really feel like you're eating udon anymore. I really think kagawaya perfectly brings out the Japanese curry flavor I love and balanced it with a really nice broth that is just thick enough to coat the noodles. This dish was also $13.", "author": "Jennifer S."}

This place is an insult to Japanese Udon. niku udon in the original Kagawaya is priced around 490 yen. That's $4.3 in today's conversion. The niku udon as of today is priced around $14. That's an insult to anyone who knows that a good udon can't only be good, but it also has to be cheap. I would understand if their portions are larger. I feel full after eating Orenchi ramen where their main ramen is priced around $13. This is not the case for this place, their portions barely makes me full. The tempura prices are alright.\n\nSo until they start pricing their niku udon around 8 to 9 dollars and their kitsune around $6 I am not going back. I'm okay if they keep their price but double the portions that is also acceptable. If you're feeling like eating Udon, pack instant kitsune udon from nijiya priced around $1/$2 and skip this place. I guarantee, if they keep their price and portions of today, they'll be out of business in around 6 months.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI'll change the review if they wake up and realize they're not in the ramen business.

There's not many places that make Udon fresh and this is one of the 3 prominent ones I'm aware of that do make it well. Noodles have a nice chew to it and the broth tastes freshly made with real ingredients.\n\nI've only had the Sanuki udon but do like the broth here. Its light and crisp tasting with just enough flavor for a light meal on a hot day. Will try the kitsune udon next time but the rest aren't as interesting, seems like they're just to round out the menu with more options palatable to the demographic.\n\nOne thing they could improve on is not making everything in one big batch. The noodles start tasting old and they lose that springiness near the end of the day. Hot crunchy tempura is a real treat with the sauce but degrades much quicker and starts getting chewier, stale as they turn room temp. It would make a huge difference if they fried to order or at least every hr or two.\n\nIt isn't really the place or kind of food that 'must be had' but rather if you already have a taste for it or crave it. The location isn't bad but the restaurant itself feels too much like a cafeteria. If it weren't for places like The Market down the block, it would feel more awkward.

I like the potato and curry potato croquette. But other good ones include a veggie medly patty, pumpkin slice, and zucchini fan. The spam musubi and onigiri are $3 each. Pretty good portion and tasty. I like the kitsune udon best because it's savory and I can add tempura without feeling guilty. The cold udon comes with an egg and has a clean, simple taste. Niku udon has tons of beef. I can eat this one without adding tempura. Creamy kobocha is okay. Tastes buttery, creamy. The tomato udon reminded me of red pasta sauce. Not bad, but not my favorite.

The menu was actually nice and clear that even without my glasses I saw it.\n\nNow, the only issue was the quality of the food for the amount I paid. When I came in, I asked the chef, what can he suggest for me. I was thinking about getting the Niku udon but since it's something new for me, I went to trust the chef suggestion. I had it go since there was not much chair. Like I said, it's just a huge space with a kitchen/counter. The suggested the curry udon as it's one of the best selling they noodles, which I find weird but ok, might as well. I would've thought he'll suggest a classic udon with miso soup. I got my order really fast and the lady handed me over the plastic. I took a peek of the bag since I thought for the amount that I just paid, I will be getting a lot more. I was so tempted to ask the lady if this is the $15 Beef Curry Udon I ordered. I swear, I thought there was more like. Yes, it was the typical take-out with a small container for my food. I was so disappointed coz I just paid with $15.  I went back to our office and I was hoping that the tastes weren't that bad. There was nothing but noodle and curry. There was some few pieces of meat and definitely not more than 4 small pieces. Not even that good either.\n\nFor that price and quality, seriously, I have experienced better.", "author": "Marvic R."}

Don't get me wrong, the udon i've had there the last few times have been delicious but $14 for beef udon is too much for the size you get. You can get a bigger bowl in Japantown for the same price, not like the \"to-go\" size bowl here at Kagawa. If it were more in $11-12 range that would make me come back more often for lunch on a regular basis cuz I love udon.", "author": "victoria y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 2}, "datePublished": "2017-06-20", "description": "I was hoping that this place would be like the Marukame Udon in Oahu. San Francisco is well-overdue for a good old cafeteria style Japanese noodle place offering variety of tempura and rice balls to go with noodle soup.  The place fell short in a few aspects that are fundamental for a good casual Japanese noodle place.  First of all, their broth lacked umami.  Second, it is overpriced for this type of eatery.  Yes, this place is located in a building that houses Uber in now trendy and pricey Mid Market area.  However, there is no excuse for a cafeteria style place to charge $10 + dollar (the most basic option starts with $9.50 plus tax) for a mediocre tasting bowl of soup.  If you are looking to try udon noodle soup, I recommend Udon Mugizo in Japantown.", "author": "Ryoko M."}

When I went there virtually no line and there were tables available. I had the curry beef Udon. The flavor was great. The amount of meat provide was plentiful. For me this was four stars. I also order shrimp tempura and the croquette. They both were cold to luke warm and this was at noon. Serving cold food is not acceptable two stars (if warmer it would have been four). Portion size is small but for me this wasn't problem, in terms of being full. The reason I am not a fan is the cost. I understand SF is expensive, so the price is not surprising, However, I  wouldn't add it to my go to place for lunch. For others, I thinks it's a great place for  lunch if you want a quick bite to eat and don't mind spending $15 for lunch.", "author": "Yaya H."}

I had the curry udon, and the curry was exactly what I needed it to be. There were good size chunks of meat and the curry was the correct spicy level. The only mistake I made was thinking the eggplant tempura was sweet potato, so I definitely need to come back to grab the correct thing next time.", "author": "Belle Y."}

{"reviewRating": {"ratingValue": 4}, "datePublished": "2017-11-18", "description": "This place looked like the food would be very good, and since me and my friend were craving some form of noodles, we went to this udon place. The first thing we noticed was the style of how you order- its different from most places, in that it is reminiscent of a school cafeteria. You grab a tray, place your order, and move down a line to get your bowl and then choosing tempura if wanted. Then you pay at the end. I don't think tips are required. I got the creamy kabocha chicken udon, while my friend got the kitsune. The chicken one was pretty good, with a nice portion: it doesnt leave you starving, but you don't get too full either. The kitsune was not as creamy as the chicken udon, obviously, but was equally as good with a giant fish cake and nice salty soup. The kabocha's soup was a little bland, and was not exactly salty. However, everything else balanced out to create a harmony. If you are looking for something not as salty, I would recommend the kabocha, and for the ones craving something saltier, the kitsune.", "author": "Melody Z."}

I got the Kitsune udon ($9.50) and added a piece of fishcake tempura ($1.50 per).  And I agree that it's a little pricey, especially for the non-meat (what is fish considered?) version.  Flavor is okay.  It had a lot of oil, and I felt a little greasy (and yeet hay) after. Tempura wasn't the crispest, but it's also been sitting out for a while.  The portion sizes worked for me. I'd probably just add more tempura pieces on hungrier visits.  I'm not opposed to going again, but I'm also not rushing back.", "author": "Glo T."}
